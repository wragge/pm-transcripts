PRNME I1INISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA FRIDAY, 22 OCTOBER 1982<br />
CIVIC RECEPTION, PORT PIRIE<br />
Thank you for your welcome and you hospitality and I wi. 3<br />
take note of you offer of land and services for the uranium<br />
enrichment industry. It has been exciting to see how p]:&amp; role<br />
here in the Iron Triangle want to graspthe development<br />
opportunities that I hope are there just waiting to be<br />
grasped. We went for a long while in the 1.950' s and 1960' rbel. iev. ing<br />
development and program just happened, that the economy<br />
would just grow, that jobs would automatically be available<br />
and our standard of life would automatically inc: rease, but<br />
then iwe came into some more difficult times and the world<br />
itself is in a difficult phase, maybe the worst since before<br />
the World War. We now know that the future is only going<br />
to be secure if we go out and grasp it and take advantage<br />
of the opportunities that are open to us, as and when they<br />
come, and as and when we can jointly make those opportunities<br />
come. There are opportunities ahead of South Australia, opportunities<br />
ahead of the Iron Triangle and the possibility of real developme-nts<br />
that would mean an enormous amovnt for this part of the<br />
state and indeed, as I believe, to the whole state. The<br />
developments at Roxby Downs themselves would be enormously<br />
important. Doug Anthony gave some of the figures in Parliament<br />
this week. The expected expenditure is nearly $ 1,500 billion,<br />
up to 18,000 jobs during the construction phase, about<br />
8,000 or a little better during production and up to<br />
$ 650 million in each year's annual production. They are big<br />
figures, it is big money, it is a lot of work and a lot of<br />
opportunities not only for the people who are directly involved<br />
in that kind of project but also for all the service industries<br />
and other people who participate in that kind of venture.<br />
As you know there has been the uranium enrichment study<br />
which has been operating under Commonwealth auspices, and<br />
David Tonkinand the State have been co-operating very closely<br />
in that. . They have come out with a report which said<br />
they believed the site for an enrichment industry should be<br />
in South Australia or somewhere in Queensland. Now thai. puts<br />
me immediately between David Tonkin and his arguments and<br />
Joh Bjelke-Petersen and his. For a while at least I have to<br />
be impartial in relation to that, but I can say that the<br />
arguments that South Australia has put are very strongly based, </p>
<p>PORT PIRIE -2-22.10.82<br />
they are very forcefully argued and they are ones that<br />
obviously carry a great deal of weight. It doesn't need<br />
emphasising that they will be given full consideration<br />
when the matter finally comes for the Federal Cabinet<br />
to determine. But to know that there are areas that want<br />
the industry, where there is a local community that would<br />
welcome the industry, of course all of that is paramount<br />
because you cannot force industries on a district, you<br />
cannot force industries on a local government. An industry,<br />
and especially an important one which involves large investment,<br />
wants to be in an area where it is going to be welcomed,<br />
where it can become part of a co. anunity and where the two<br />
can go ahead together. To have been able to see the warmth<br />
and vigour of your. own advocacy and not just yours Mr Mayor,<br />
but of other people in this part of the State for that<br />
industry is a good thing, and it obviously is an attitude<br />
that advances South Australia's claims to the ultimate site<br />
of the enrichment industry.<br />
Having said that I hope you won't mind if I make one or<br />
two other com. ments because there was some reporting some<br />
time ago about alleged changes in the Australian Labor<br />
Party's policy to the uranium industr-y. Mr Hayden<br />
made it perfectly plain that there had in fact been no<br />
changes because he made several statements saying our<br />
commitment to end the uranium industry is as strong as<br />
ever it was, and that is one the record and it is undisputed.<br />
If you read the words of the policy it is very plain. The<br />
industry would be ended. Now if an industry is going to be<br />
ended where it already exists in the Northern Territory or<br />
in other parts of the Commonwealth does anyone believe that<br />
people committed to that objective would allow Roxby Downs to<br />
start to operate because so much of it would be dependent<br />
on processing of the uranium in the mine. Or that they would<br />
allow or encourage an enrichment industry to be established<br />
in South Australia or Queensland or anywhere else in the<br />
Commonwealth, it just wouldn't happen. Private enterprise,<br />
the people who are going to put up the dollars and cents for<br />
this kind of industry are not going to do it unless they know<br />
that governments are in a full-blooded way in support of the<br />
development and that they know they are not going to be<br />
frustrated by policies of obstruction.<br />
It is also worth noting and recalling that this industry<br />
in other countries has now operated with a remarkable safety<br />
record over a long period of years. Itis one in which the homes<br />
and the factories of millions of people in Europe and the<br />
northern hemisphere are dependent upon nuclear power for their<br />
livelihoods. To keep their factories operating and to be able<br />
to light and heat their homes. We in Australia need to understand<br />
that. Most Australians do understand it and it is obvious<br />
that here, you understand it completely. / 3 </p>
<p>PORT PIRIE<br />
I hope that it has been demonstrated that the Commonwealth<br />
Government in recent times and together with the State<br />
Governments which is represented by John -Olsen here today,<br />
have sought to work closely with local government and<br />
indeed assist local governments to meet some of the problems<br />
and challenges that they have had in front of them.<br />
When we first came into office we had an option of supporting<br />
local government through specific programs when somebody in<br />
Canberra would say we want to do certain things and then to<br />
be in part. of the progam, every local government in the<br />
Commonwealth, all 900 of them, would have had to do the same<br />
thing. But we rejected that approach tota. ly and determined<br />
on a policy of making a proportion of all your income taxes<br />
available to local government and that is now a substantial<br />
sum of several hundred million dollars a year available to<br />
local government to be-spent as you Mr Mayor, your Aldermen<br />
and your counterparts in all other municipalities to determine.<br />
We believed in the end that that was the best way for the<br />
Commonwealth to support local government because it is not<br />
we, or public servants in Canberra who know your priorities,<br />
you know them and if there are some dollars from the Federal<br />
tax bill which should go towards local government, it is<br />
you who should determine how those dollars should be spent.<br />
The other thing that I would like to mention is the Bicentennial<br />
Road Development Program which I think is-an imaginative one<br />
as we work towards 1988. I hope that we can cast our eyes<br />
to the future and have in mind the number of things that can<br />
and should be done to help mark Australia's 200 years.<br />
The Commonwealth has approved in principle and also the money<br />
involved to back up the principle, in the Bicentennial Program<br />
that the Authority under John Reid has recommended to us.<br />
That program is now going around to the states to see if they<br />
also agree and if they do then the draft program can be published<br />
and local government, everyone else will know where they fit<br />
into it. There are Commonwealth funds for important and<br />
national projects but we also ope that many things can be done<br />
as we cast our eyes ahead to that time and givena particular<br />
bicentennial focus, and they might be things that have been<br />
done in any case, but perhaps done a bit better in a more<br />
imaginative way because we are leading up to the bicentennial.<br />
To give one example, we provide funds for buying paintings<br />
and works of art for the National Gallery but for the funds<br />
that will be provided between now and 1988, we have said this<br />
is how much it will be, it will be the Bicentennial Collection<br />
and it is something that people can look forward to putting<br />
together. If we look around at all levels of government, whether<br />
it is local, state or federal, therearemany things which I<br />
think are going tobe able to be given a bicentennial focus<br />
and that will help us all celebrate a very significant year for<br />
Australia but at a cost that all our taxpayers can reasonably<br />
afford. / 4<br />
-3-22.10.82 </p>
<p>PORT PIRIE<br />
One of the programs that we are funding separately and<br />
distinctly from the program recommended by the Authority<br />
is the Bicentennial Road Development Program which will in fact<br />
have about $ 2,500 billion spent on it and governments are not<br />
going to be able to snitch the money afterwards and put it into<br />
the qeneral tax iool because the general legislation runs out'<br />
in 1988. But by that time we hope there will have been an<br />
enormous advance in the construction of national highways,<br />
the basic National Highway Program should have been concluded.<br />
There will be significant increases of funds for arterial<br />
roads, urban arterial roads and if the state wanted to support<br />
urban transport systems also. Of course additional funds for<br />
local government for roads distinctly under the control of<br />
local government. This is going to mean greater resources<br />
for local government in the five years ahead of us, much<br />
greater than would otherwise have been the case and I think<br />
we will see a transformation of Australia's road system.<br />
That doesn't just help people who live in provincial cities<br />
and country towns, it is going to help all Australians, help<br />
all our commerce, it will lower transport costs and I hope<br />
it will reduce the road tolls and help Australians get about<br />
this country to be able to see and learn something more about<br />
Australia. This also is one of the bicentennial programs that<br />
the Commonwealth is supporting and it is one thathas been<br />
fairly warmly support around the Commonwealth.<br />
I would like to thank you for your hospitality. Against I<br />
am glad to not and thank you for your offer to find a paddock<br />
for the enrichment industry. I will advise John Carrick of<br />
that and I hope that it is not going to be all that long before<br />
final decisions can be made. It does offer great opportunities<br />
for this part of the State indeed for the whole of South<br />
Australia and we need those opportunities if young Australians<br />
are to have the opportunities they need and the jobs that they<br />
want to look after themselves and their families; when their<br />
turn comes. -4-22.10.82 </p>
