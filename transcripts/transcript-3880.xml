PRIME MINISTER Press Statement No. 553<br />
8 September 1975<br />
LOCATION OF AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT EMPLOYMENT<br />
The Australian Government has decided to transfer a<br />
number of units of Australian Government employment to the<br />
regional growth centres of Albury-Wodonga, Bathurst-Orange and<br />
Geelong. The transfers will commence during 1975/ 76 and continue<br />
to 1978/ 79, and will involve up to 1,200 Public Servants.<br />
The Units to be transferred to regional growth<br />
centres are<br />
TO ALBURY-WODONGA<br />
The Health Insurance Commission, Central Office<br />
The Schools Commission, Central Administration<br />
The Children's Commission<br />
TO BATHURST-ORANGE<br />
The Division of National Mapping<br />
The Australia. Police College<br />
TO GEELONG The National Biological Standards Laboratory<br />
The Government has previously announced decisions to<br />
establish the National Authority on Road Safety and Standards<br />
and the Australian Heritage Commission in Albury-Wodonga and<br />
the National Animal Health Laboratory in Geelong.<br />
The Government has also decided that certain Central<br />
Office staff will transfer from Melbourne to Canberra. During<br />
1975/ 76, some 50 positions will' be transferred, and studies<br />
are being undertaken in connection with the possible transfer<br />
to Canberra of other Government units in policy areas. It is<br />
expected that these studies will be completed in the near future.<br />
/ 2 </p>
<p>The departments chiefly involved in the moves from<br />
Melbourne to Canberra in 1975/ 76 are Housing and Construction<br />
and Transport, both of which currently have their Central<br />
Administrations split between the two cities.<br />
In reaching decisions about transfers to the regional<br />
growth centres of Albury-Wodonga, Bathurst-Orange and Geelong,<br />
the Government was fully conscious of the significance of such<br />
moves for the people who will be concerned. It has not taken<br />
its decisions lightly but has also had in mind furthering its<br />
objectives in regional development.<br />
The effect of the decisions will be to provide a<br />
major stimulus to the development of growth centres, which are<br />
an important part of the Government's urban and regional<br />
development policy, and at the same time to ensure that Public<br />
Service units which have critical functional linkages to<br />
Parliament and major national institutions are located in<br />
Canberra. Details of transfer time-tables and the conditions<br />
under which the transfers will take place have yet to be<br />
determined, pending the outcome of discussions with the<br />
development corporations concerned and with interested staff<br />
groups. Staff associations have already been assured that<br />
a minimum of 12 months notice will be given to'staff when the<br />
compulsory transfer of positions is involved.<br />
Details of new criteria for the location of<br />
Australian Government employment in Canberra and other growth<br />
centres, which were the basis for these decisions, were<br />
announced in a Prime Ministerial press statement of<br />
14 April 1975.<br />
