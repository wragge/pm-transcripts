IA<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 9 JUNE 1989<br />
The Australian Government stands ready to provide an<br />
immediate grant of $ 200,000 to help Chinese people who are<br />
in need of humanitarian assistance following recent events.<br />
Discussions are taking place between officials and the<br />
Australian Red Cross Society on ways of providing<br />
assistance. Governments and Red Cross have often worked together to<br />
ensure that humanitarian relief reaches people under<br />
difficult circumstances.<br />
Right now Red Cross is exploring acceptable ways of reaching<br />
those people. It is vital that the humanitarian work of<br />
organisations like Red Cross continues without disruption.<br />
Government officials will maintain close contact with Red<br />
Cross about needs in China as the situation evolves.<br />
Should an Australian appeal be launched, I call on all<br />
Australians to give generously and in this context very much<br />
welcome the initiative taken by Wayne Goss on 7 June to<br />
focus attention on this humanitarian matter. </p>
