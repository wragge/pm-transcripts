STATEMENT BY THlE PRIME MINISTER, THE HION P J KEATING MP<br />
COMMEMORATIVE MISSION TO FRENCH BAT1TLEFIELDS<br />
On this anniversary of Armistice Da I am pleased to announce that the Federal<br />
Government will fund a commemorative mission to the French battleficlds in 1993.<br />
1 envisage this journey involving a number of FirstWorld War veterans as a national<br />
tribute to the sacrifices of Australian service personnel.<br />
The visit, likely to take place in August or September next year, will be a forerunner to the<br />
anniivcrsary of thc end of the First World War, in November 1993.<br />
Thbousands of young Australians participated in WWI, and therefore thcrc was a great<br />
impact on most Australian families. The casualty ratc was very high, particularly in France<br />
in the final years of the war.<br />
Of the 313,000 soldiers who embarked from Australia, 53,00X) died in France and<br />
Belgium. About 18,000 have no known grave.<br />
Because of the success of the pilgrimage to Gallipoli in 1990, we now propose that a<br />
limited number of veterans travel to theSomme, an area where Australians fought with<br />
valour in 1918. The number might be of the order of onc or two from each Statc. The<br />
delegation would be accompanied by administrative and support staff.<br />
Thc mission will coincide with the anniiversary of Australian attacks onMiont St -Quentin.-<br />
and Peronne in 1918. This fighting is held by many historians and Australian veterans to<br />
be a brilliant action which effectively removed five German Divisions from the fighting. It<br />
resulted in 3,000 Australian casualties.<br />
It is expected that the group will also travel to Ville rs-Bretonneux and Bullecourt, where<br />
Australian veterans have longstanding links with the French people.<br />
This year's Fedcral Budget provided $ 2 million for support of military commemorations<br />
for the period 1992-3 to 1995-6.<br />
