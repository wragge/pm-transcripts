" THE JROTH OF A NATION"<br />
Transcript of Election Telecast by the Prime Minister,<br />
Mr. Harold Holt<br />
I want to say something to you in the iroad about<br />
our domestic programme for the next three years. You have<br />
no douot read much of the detail; jut before I talk about<br />
our programme, let me remind you that how we are to carry<br />
on with the development of this continent and how best we<br />
can make our country secure is the very core of this election<br />
campaign. How we do these things is the great issue of this<br />
election. ( Film Sequence on Security)<br />
It is not possible, in the space of a few minutes<br />
to talk fully about the growth of this nation of ours. But<br />
the truth, of course, is that you can't grasp the story of<br />
Australian achievement in recent years through statistics<br />
alone. The real discovery is to feel in your bones what<br />
is happening in a country oursting into rich, adult<br />
nationhood with its greater tomorrows ahead.<br />
Seventeen years ago, when we came to office, we<br />
resolved to do one thing above all else to produce our way<br />
to prosperity. This plan, quickly realized, evolved into<br />
our long-term objective of national development with<br />
national stability. I'ithin that time more than half the<br />
homes in Australia today have been built.<br />
An expanding economy, full employment, a rapidly<br />
growing population all these things have helped to give<br />
us one of the highest living standards in the world.<br />
All this is worth preserving.<br />
, fie oelieve that our domestic and foreign policies<br />
are right for Australia at this point of time; we are<br />
certain they are more in tune with the national outlook<br />
than the policies of our Labor Party opponents.<br />
Naturally, we give our constant attention to our<br />
national security in a changing and dangerous part of the<br />
world. But our primary aim is to push on with our development<br />
at home, to make Australia not only a bigger and<br />
stronger country but a good country for men and women and<br />
their children to live in, to prosper in, to be happy in.<br />
Back in 1963 we oroke new ground, particularly on </p>
<p>education and housing. Education is of vital importance<br />
to every parent and child and to the nation itself. Ours<br />
is not a uig country in numbers, so we must be big in quality.<br />
And that's why education looms so large. Under our Federal<br />
Constitution education is one of the subject matters reserved<br />
to the States but we as a Federal Government are willingly<br />
doing more and more to help.<br />
In my Policy Speech I have proposed new and important<br />
Commonwealth assistance to education. Our decision<br />
to appoint a Commonwealth Minister for Education is further<br />
evidence of our good intentions.<br />
We made notable advances in the housing policies<br />
we announced in 1965. The Home Savings Grant Scheme and<br />
the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation have played their<br />
part in making Australia a great home-owning democracy.<br />
lready we have the highest percentage of home-ownership<br />
in the world. But ours is a continuing programme. We<br />
now propose a special effort to give more help and comfort<br />
to our older citizens.<br />
In the field of social justice we have looked again<br />
at the means test and gone further along the road of<br />
liberalisation. There isn't time to go into detail tonight about<br />
the plans we have for the further development of our great<br />
primary industries and the development of our vast northern<br />
areas. The central government of our country has become<br />
both demanding and complex. There are great and farreaching<br />
matters constantly before us. The business of<br />
government is certainly not for our Labor Party opponents<br />
in their present condition. They have frequently shown<br />
they can't ue of the same mind for one week on end.<br />
On the larger questions of national security and on<br />
the equally important questions of national progress,<br />
economic stability and the well-being of the individual,<br />
we have put before you principles and a programme which<br />
we firmly believe are in the oest interests of our country<br />
and of you, its people.<br />
You have a clear-cut choice on Novemoer 26. Cast<br />
it wisely for yourself and for Australia.<br />
