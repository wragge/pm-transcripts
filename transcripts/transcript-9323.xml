PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING MP<br />
DOORSTOP, AFTERNOON BREAK, COAG, PARLIAMENT HOUSE,<br />
DARWIN, FRIDAY, 19 AUGUST 1994<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
PM: In the early afternoon, as you know, at lunch time, we hadn't made<br />
much progress here. The States wanted a fundamental realignment of<br />
Commonwealth payments to the States before they would discuss the<br />
Hilmer recommendations. For the Commonwealth's part we said well,<br />
we wouldn't agree to that, we would be prepared however as we said<br />
this morning to try and quantify the benefit to the Commonwaath<br />
budget flowing from competition policy changes, but this is not, of<br />
course, economy wide changes on the Federal budget. And, were that<br />
not to be agreed by the States, we, the Commonwealth, would go back<br />
to the drawing board and think about what position we should take<br />
ourselves ie, whether we would legislate ourselves.<br />
At that point, I think, the States thought that, well frankly, thought<br />
better of ht and said that for their part, a number of them NSW, OLD,<br />
WA, the ACT said that they could actually agree to some of the core<br />
matters if, indeed, we sought to quantify the funding, the extra revenue<br />
the Commonwealth might receive from the Hilmer competitive<br />
changes. So, we said that's fine, ok, we are prepared to think about<br />
that, but we have to have agreement to the core issues and, of course,<br />
I then started to move down them.<br />
Now, the primary one is the first point. Council agreed to a package of<br />
reforms that comprised<br />
the revision of the conduct rules of trade practices legislation<br />
and their extension to cover business and state and local<br />
government business enterprises and unincorporated<br />
businesses.<br />
That is your essential core Hlimer principle. The second dot point </p>
<p>2<br />
establish a national system to carry out surveillance and to<br />
provide access to essential facilities such as electricity grids,<br />
pipe lines, airports, rail networks under an agreed set of<br />
national principles.<br />
That was agreed by the same group of States. The establishment of<br />
an Australian Competition Commission has been agreed. So, those<br />
core bits are there. Now, there is many more elements of them, but<br />
they are ancillary to, they tend to round the points out. They are the<br />
core points. Now, if we get throughout the balance of the day, further,<br />
if you like, written confirmation of the agreement of a majority of States<br />
to these points, we will then look at the legislation, amend it where<br />
necessary and then circulate it for discussion with the States so that<br />
when we come to our next meeting, by that stage we'll also have a<br />
financial offer on the table based on some quantification of the value to<br />
the Commonwealth of competitive changes.<br />
Now, what all that means is we are making progress. This is a very big<br />
issue and it is hard to make progress on. The States authorities are<br />
one of the last places left where monopolies exist and where free<br />
competitive disciplines are curtailed. It was never going to be easy to<br />
crack that nut, this was the way to do it I think. And, we were, sort of,<br />
giving the nut a bang all morning and we got a crack through It in the<br />
afternoon.<br />
J: Why did it take five hours to come to the point which the States<br />
already wanted? Why did it take five hours to nut out?..<br />
PM: Because they thought they would stare us down on the claim that half<br />
of future gains to Commonwealth revenue would go to the States.<br />
Nothing to do with Hilmer, just general economy wide revenue<br />
changes. And, of course, we were not going to agree to that.<br />
J: Prime Minister, the States say that they have got from you a guarantee<br />
that they'll get a percentage of the revenue gains. Is that right in<br />
principle?<br />
PM: What I've said to them is that we are prepared to share with the States<br />
the benefit to the Commonwealth budget that might flow from<br />
competition changes as a consequence of these discussions.<br />
J: On a fixed percentage though?<br />
PM: but that is a whole lot of difference than half of the future growth of<br />
total Commonwealth receipts to the States.<br />
J: But how do you guarantee them fixed a percentage share? </p>
<p>PM: No, no, it Is not a fixed percentage. It is a matter of us trying to assess<br />
what the value to the budget is. Now, let me just repeat the point<br />
again. This is a tough set of issues and the first thing the States did<br />
was walk away from the communique and say well, that was only our<br />
officials. Well, you know, the Commonwealth has been encouraged by<br />
the fact that States officials have agreed broadly with the communique,<br />
but the Premiers are making it clear, no, well, officials say one thing<br />
and we say another. OK, well we understand what an argy bargy is all<br />
about, but let's try and get some national progress here. Now, I think,<br />
we are going to get that, but we are going to get it around some decent<br />
principles because the thing you do in here, I mean, I'll sit here all day<br />
and night if I have to to screw the points down and get them out of<br />
there. Just like we did at subsequent meetings of COAG and I hope<br />
that we can get enough core principles adopted here to say that one of<br />
the last bastions of privilege and position in commercial terms in this<br />
economy is going to be opened up.<br />
J: Prime Minister, do you concede that the revenue share that you are<br />
now considering will be more than the $ 700 million that you originally<br />
offered the States?<br />
PM: No, it may not be, but It may be.<br />
J: Prime Minister, are you saying that some States haven't signed on for<br />
this yet?<br />
PM: That's what I'm saying. Just-like that.<br />
J: Which States Victoria and Western Australia?<br />
PM: Godi I like your questions. ( Fran Kelly, ABC Radio)<br />
FK: I'm glad.<br />
J: Prime Minister, they've all said It was a fairly acrimonious meeting.<br />
PM: There hasn't been a tough word exchanged all through it to be honest.<br />
J: No voices raised?<br />
PM: No, no. in fact it's what shall I say. I'm searching for adjective. It is<br />
very, very polite. It's a very polite meeting. It is exceedingly polite. It<br />
is insufferably polite.<br />
J: Is there any great ( inaudible) for the general revenue sharing or is<br />
that what you think you've knocked on the head this morning?<br />
PM: Well, we have knocked that on the head. Look, bear this in mind and I<br />
think this Is an important point. You might remember after the </p>
<p>February meeting of COAG we said the States have agreed in<br />
principle to Hilmer, they've not adopted it, but they have agreed in<br />
principle to the issues. Therefore, we will show some bona fides at the<br />
Premiers Conference financial meeting when we consider<br />
Commonwealth payments to the States. We did that. We gave the<br />
States a completely new deal, real terms per capita which will cost us<br />
about $ 1 billion. So, we've actually made a commitment already about<br />
revenue sharing and we are happy to make it in the context of cooperation.<br />
But, we are not about to say, when we've now got five per<br />
cent economic growth In the economy, we'll hand to the States, here's<br />
half the revenue and what, for the Hilmer changes because they are<br />
not going to come through for a couple of years, but as from now, we<br />
were never going to agree with that.<br />
J: But, do you believe you will reach a figure today?<br />
PM: No, not today, but look, there is going to be some consequential<br />
benefit at the Commonwealth budget. We are quite happy to share<br />
some of that, quite happy to, but that is a world of difference in saying<br />
to the States well, here's half of our future revenue growth. I mean,<br />
we've got to bring the Commonwealth budget into surplus and the only<br />
way we are going to be able to do it is to make sure that when the<br />
economy does pick up and the revenue yield does rise, that it gets<br />
devoted to turning the deficit Into surplus.<br />
J: And what are the implications to the States that didn't sign onto the<br />
agreement today?<br />
PM: Well, I think, their position is not very strong because they have got a<br />
majority of states signing on, we'll have a national Act and if they are a<br />
co-operating State under the Act they get a whole lot of benefits<br />
including money. The first thing the State doesn't get who doesn't sign<br />
up is money.<br />
J: Who hasn't signed on?<br />
PM: Well, there's Victoria and Tasmania and South Australia at this stage<br />
to some of things but, some are on some points and others are on<br />
others.<br />
J: Western Australia has signed.<br />
PM: Western Australia has on the main point, yes.<br />
J: Is the political reality that the agreements you are getting now on these<br />
substantive points are conditional on this money being sorted out in<br />
February? </p>
<p>PM: Yes, I think that is fair enough. I mean, how do you know and how<br />
could you accurately access how much the Commonwealth budget will<br />
benefit from this. Well, that is pretty hard to say, but we can make a<br />
good guesstimate at that.<br />
J: Did I hear you say that Western Australia was one of the main<br />
PM: No, no, Western Australia is part of the agreed on the principle<br />
point, is one of the agreeing States, but on other points is not. You<br />
see, some agree on some points and not on others.<br />
J: Mr Keating, can I ask you what you think of the new Parliament<br />
House?<br />
PM: I think it is a very nice building and with a wonderful view too.<br />
