PRIME MINISTER<br />
OFFICIAL OPENING OF " CONSTRUCTION HOUSE<br />
CANBERRA 27 APRIL 1971<br />
Speech by the Prime Minister, The Rt Hon. William M~ c~ ahon, C. H. g, M. P.<br />
I would also like to thank Mr. W-illiams and Mr. Box on your<br />
behalf, and on behalf of my wife and myself as well, for inviting<br />
us today. It i-s most appropriate that the building and construction<br />
industry should decide to build this magnificent national head.-'<br />
quarters building in Canberra. it's hard to imagine a more apt way<br />
for the industry to display its presence in the national capital.<br />
Thi~ s city which is as much a tribute to the construction industry<br />
as'-' it is * oour own planners, architects and engineers. There are<br />
three industry organisation partners here in Construction House.<br />
Firstly, the Master Builders' Federation of Australia which is well<br />
known and respected in Canberra. It has been submitting the views of<br />
the industry to the Federal Government on a wide number of matters<br />
of industry concern for a long time. And last year, my Government<br />
was pleased to co-operate with your industry in sending an official<br />
sur-vey mission to South East Asia to help Australian contractors try<br />
to win competitive contracts in that developing region.<br />
During the last three or four years, Australian consultatts<br />
have been successful throughout the South East Asian region. It<br />
would be natural for Australian building and construction companies<br />
to be looking for a similar trend in the export of their skills.<br />
This region is virtually on Australia's doorstep, and it is one<br />
where Australian building could make an important contribution in<br />
applying the world standard of competence it has reached.<br />
I will be visiting Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore myself<br />
soon, and my Government attaches very great importance to our<br />
relations with these close neighbours to our north whether in<br />
defence, in aid and development programmes in cultural relations,<br />
or in the growth of trade. We would like nothing better than to see<br />
private enterprise doing more in backing up and developing the<br />
Government's efforts to strengthen our ties with these nations. ./ 2 </p>
<p>The Australian Institute of Building is a newcomer to<br />
Canberra. But its vital role in establishing and maintaining<br />
standards is wcll known in the building industry. The third<br />
member of the triumvirate occupy" ing this buTIlding, the Master<br />
Builders' Association of the A. C. T. deals with the day-to-day<br />
industry problems in Australia's fastest growing city. And it<br />
does that well, as the evidence of our eyes shows.<br />
In a short ten years, building in Australia has grown from<br />
a modest to a very large industry. It is now an industry which<br />
helps significantly in setting this nation's growth pattern. And<br />
much of the credit for Australia's development in the past twenty<br />
years must go to it. its influence in Australia's growth,<br />
development and standard of living are, of course, visible everywhere.<br />
Let me elaborate Investment in physical capita. is one<br />
of the mainsprings of economic progress: It has nlhyed a key role<br />
in Australia's strong rate of economic and population growth.<br />
The building and construction industry is responsible for<br />
something over half of total fixed investment and about 14 per cent<br />
of gross national expenditure in Australia: But its importance<br />
does not end there. Through its demands for materials the industry<br />
affects output and investment throughout many sect6rs of manufacturing<br />
industry. It is also a very large employer of 430,000 people,<br />
or 9 per cent of the national workforce, according to the last<br />
census. But if you take account of related industries, building<br />
and construction could be said to be responsible for employing<br />
about 15 per cent of the workfcrce; you hIave rapid growth as well.<br />
In those ten years, total spending on building and<br />
construction has gone up by about 140 per cent. That compares with<br />
an increase of 12o% in gross national spending generally, because<br />
your industry is such a mass user of scarce resources, j. t has an.<br />
important responsibility to make a maximum contribution to growth<br />
by making the best and most efficient possible use of those<br />
resources thus both your industry and our own economic-policymakers<br />
have a strong interest in the soundly-based growth of<br />
building and construction activity.<br />
Continuity in building and construction operation raises<br />
productivity, encourages technological innovation and facilitates<br />
longer-term planning. Stability in your industry makes it easier<br />
for us to maintain stable growth and full employment in the<br />
economy as a whole. That's why we are very pleased to see the<br />
development of, and increasing professionalism in organisations<br />
1like the Master Builders' Federation.<br />
The Federation and its affiliated bodies have also found<br />
themselves increasingly involved in industrial relations, and<br />
Master Builders' Associations have recently featured prominently<br />
in major industrial disputes in the industry. I can recall some<br />
recent disputes in New South Wales which have proved very costly<br />
both to employers and individual employees# One particular<br />
building union resorted to the use of physical violence and<br />
caused damage to property in pursuing its demands. ./ 3 </p>
<p>But I am confident that under the guidance and co-ordination<br />
of your Federal organisation now established in Canberra, industrial<br />
relations in the building industry will bring increased employeremployee<br />
harmony. I would not want to leave such a distinguished<br />
audience as you are without some comments on how we in the Federal<br />
Government see our role in relation to your industry, ? articularly<br />
in relation to housing.<br />
It has become almost a cliche of the political scene that in<br />
Australia we enjoy the highest level of home ownership in the world<br />
and one of the highest rates of housing construction. Put no matter<br />
how well accepted and commonplace those statements may seem to some<br />
observers, they show a solid record of achievement against which<br />
current problems and criticism must beweighed. TVere will always be<br />
problems to be overcome. But we are not resting on our record in<br />
this vital area of housing which is so closely identified with the<br />
everyday life and aspirations of Australians. On the contrary,<br />
we are carrying on and improving the record of successive Liberal/<br />
Country Party Governments, in the increasing involvement of the<br />
Commonwealth in housing.<br />
Housing is one of the few portfolios that I have not held<br />
during my minlsterial career and that's mainly because it was<br />
established in comparatively recent years. I seem to have had my<br />
chance in just about all the others. The total is thirteen portfolios,<br />
they tell me. Our position as a Government with respect to<br />
housinq is that we believe every Australian family should be well<br />
houseWdA nd housed in a fashion of its own choice. We recognise<br />
that Government assistance is necessary to achieve this aim. But<br />
we believe such assistance should be implemented in a co-operative<br />
rather than in a domineering and bureaucratic way.<br />
We take the approach that we can co-operative successfully<br />
with private enterprise, and this new building and this national<br />
caDital are testimony to the success of that approach. We also<br />
believe we should co-operate with the state Governments in helping<br />
them to fulfill the housing needs of the reople as speedily as<br />
practicable. More recently, we have taken a number of decisions in the<br />
housing area. For example, last December we made new arrangements<br />
for Commonwealth financial assistance to the states for housing.<br />
As a direct result ther ' havo been substantial reductions in the<br />
interest rates charged by all state authorities. They represent<br />
the greatest reduction in hcusing interest rates in a quarter of<br />
a century. The interest charged on dwellings sold by the state<br />
housing authorities and financed by co-oerative societies have<br />
been reduced substantially, and the benefits of these reductions are<br />
being passcd on to home buyers. We have also relieved the States of<br />
the need to provide housing for members of the armed forces. This<br />
has released additional funds for civilian and welfare housing.<br />
We are also paying the States $ 1.25 million a year for the<br />
next five years towards rental reductions for the really needy. </p>
<p>Since the last Budget, the maximum advance under the war<br />
service homes scheme has becn increased by $ 1000, and interest<br />
charged by our housing loans insurance corporation has been reduced.<br />
At the Premiers' Conference in February, we provided additional funds<br />
for state works, and a number of states have stimulated their home<br />
building programmes as a result.<br />
These are all decisions taken to assist housing, but another<br />
problem the industry faces is the rising costs of land. This<br />
problem can only be solved by co-operation b tween all levels of<br />
Government and private enterprise.<br />
As for the future. You can be. . assured that we will.. continue<br />
to improve and undate Government asistance in the housing area, as<br />
we have dcne in the past: We are proud cf our record. But we<br />
acknowledge that there are still many policy aspects of housing<br />
which we should be looking at. Having said that I want to thank<br />
you again for inviting us here today, and I have much pleasure in<br />
declaring construction house officially 6pen. </p>
