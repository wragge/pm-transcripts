~ PRIME MINISTER 141/ 92<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, TIlE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
CHRISTMAS APPEALS AND ADDITIONAL FUNDS FOR EMERGENCY<br />
RELIEF I announced on 6 December 1992 that the Government will match dollar for dollar cash<br />
donations by the Australian public to major voluntary agencies for their Christmas<br />
appeals. I am pleased to announce today that the Government will also provide_ an additional<br />
$ 2 million for the EmergencyRclicf Program. This money is in addition to the<br />
$ 7.6 million provided for Emergency Relicf in Dccembcr.<br />
Thc Emergency Relief Program makes it possible for some 700 community welfare<br />
agencies with around 1,000 outlets across Australia to provide assistance to people in<br />
need.<br />
The additional funding will ensure that smaller agencies which currently provide<br />
emergency relief to individuals and families are able to offer extra assistance in the<br />
Christmas period.<br />
Many of these smaller agencies focus on special needs groups, such as Aboriginal and<br />
Torres Strait Islandcr peoples, or are able to deliver assistance to rural and remote areas.<br />
Only those organisations which do not receive matching Christmas appeal funds will be<br />
eligible for the additional Emergency Relief Funding.<br />
Eligibility critcria have also bccn dctcrmincd for the Christmas appeals matching funds.<br />
Eligible organisations which benefit front the matching funds will be national<br />
organisations or major players in a State/ Territory with an extcnsive coverage in the areas<br />
of Christmas need. Organis-ations must have a sound record in material aid and Christmas<br />
assistance so that the funds can be distributed as quickly as possible. Organisations must<br />
be incorporated with Taxation Exemption Status ( Public Benevolent Institution) and must<br />
also have had a Christmas appeal in operation at the time of the initial announcement on 6<br />
December 1992. </p>
<p>L<br />
My objective in establishing there matching arrangements was to encourage those of us<br />
who are bcttcr off in thc community to reach out to our fellow Australians who are less<br />
well off so that they can celebrate Christmas in the way that many of us take for granted.<br />
I hope that the Australian community will follow the Government's lead and increase<br />
donations to the voluntary agencies so that all Australians can cnjoy their Christmas this<br />
year. Further information on the guidelines and application details for Christmas appeals<br />
matching funds can be obtained from thc Dcpartrment of Health, Housing and Community<br />
Services telcphone ( 06) 289 5100; fax ( 06) 289 1076 or the Department of the<br />
Primc Minister and Cabinet tclcphonc ( 06) 271 5278; fax ( 06) 271 5107.<br />
Canbcrra 11 December 1992 </p>
