PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF DOORSTOP ON DEPARTURE FOR TURKEY, RAAF BASE<br />
FAIRBAIRN 22 APRIL 1990<br />
E OE PROOF ONLY<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, an emotional time for you the next<br />
week or so?<br />
PM: For everyone I think.<br />
JOURNALIST: How important is it that the Government, the<br />
Opposition and the Diggers are going to be there?<br />
PM: I think it's the indication of the way in which all<br />
Australians, irrespective of their politics or their age,<br />
understand the significance of Anzac. And it's something<br />
which I think all Australians now are coming to<br />
appreciate was fundamental in the formation of the<br />
Australian nation and an understanding of ourselves as<br />
one nation. And although it was a military defeat, it<br />
was the occasion of an exhibition of unbelievable heroism<br />
and determination by those young men who were prepared to<br />
go across the world and lay down their lives on the first<br />
occasion as Australians.<br />
JOURNALIST: How do you think you're going to feel during<br />
the service?<br />
0 PM: I think like everyone we'll all feel very emotional<br />
about it. You wouldn't be human if you didn't.<br />
JOURNALIST: On another issue, the floods have been very<br />
bad in Queensland and NSW. Is the Government going to<br />
give any assistance in this area?<br />
PM: I'll be looking for a detailed report on it. I<br />
p3 bbably will get that while I'm away. But the normal<br />
provisions will come into effect, the natural disaster<br />
provisions in which we co-operate with the States to meet<br />
the problems for the people who've been devastated in<br />
this way. I take this opportunity of extending my great<br />
sympathy to them.<br />
JOURNALIST: What's your reaction to the Coroner's report<br />
on the state of the Pacific Highway and the need for </p>
<p>2<br />
PM: That will be studied by our people. We indicated<br />
during the election campaign our preparedness to make<br />
additional money available. There is under the existing<br />
provisions, provided NSW is prepared to co-operate, the<br />
capacity to extend a fair amount of additional money in<br />
that area. But clearly a detailed examination will need<br />
to be undertaken of the report.<br />
JOURNALIST: So that the two cents a litre extra<br />
that Mr Willis suggested has been ruled out?<br />
PM: I'm not going into that. I'm saying we'll look at<br />
the report. But I've indicated that, much earlier than<br />
the report, we'd undertaken the availability of<br />
additional money for expenditure in that area.<br />
