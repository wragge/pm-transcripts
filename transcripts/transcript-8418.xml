TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING, MP<br />
DOORSTOP CANBERRA, FEBRUARY 26 1992<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
PM: I think the Statement will be a turning point in our<br />
history. It's about bringing on recovery in jobs but<br />
it's also a Statement which will demonstrate very aptly<br />
the vast: gulf between the Labor Party and the Liberal<br />
Party, between the party of believers, the party of<br />
builders, the builders of hope, the party of the big<br />
national projects, the party which has always pushed<br />
Australia forward. Between the Labor Party and the<br />
Coalition it wants to tax the food you put in your<br />
mouth and the clothes you put on your back. I mean,<br />
that's what the vast difference will show tonight.<br />
J: Mr Keating, how can people take much comfort when<br />
unemployment is still expected to rise at least in the<br />
short term?<br />
PM: Wait and see what the Statement says, but we will be<br />
back to a recovery and will see the 1990s come as a low<br />
inflationary period of growth for Australia.<br />
J: Do you concede you got the Murphy analysis wrong<br />
yesterday?<br />
PM: I'll handle that in the House today.<br />
ends </p>
