    <content><![CDATA[<p>I have today proposed to Premiers and Chief Ministers that we discuss at the forthcoming COAG meeting on 3 June, that we work cooperatively together to develop a genuinely national approach to apprenticeships.</p>
<p> I want to work closely with my state and territory colleagues to achieve a more flexible and responsive training system, underpinned by four key principles:</p>
<p> ú</p>
<p>Employer-specified training</p>
<p>ú</p>
<p>Nationally accepted qualifications</p>
<p>ú</p>
<p>Flexible training that meets individual needs</p>
<p>ú</p>
<p>Competition between training providers</p>
<p> There are too many confusing inconsistencies across the country that cause delays in starting or continuing work in a trade.</p>
<p>  A qualified carpenter in the Australian Capital Territory has to undertake additional training and registration if he/she wants to work five kilometres away in New South Wales. A young woman who qualifies as a hairdresser through a private course in Victoria cannot practise in New South Wales unless she does a full apprenticeship - but she could practise in London.</p>
<p>  These are problems that we cannot afford when we have unprecedented economic growth and strong demand for skilled labour in most industries.  Australia needs a national apprenticeship system that responds quickly to the needs of industry. It should also offer flexible and rewarding opportunities for all Australian workers.</p>
<p>   Prior work experience should be recognised and tradesmen and women should be able to use their qualifications regardless of which state or territory they choose to work in. Training must be flexible and be able to start, stop or be changed to suit the individual requirements of apprentices and employers.  In some states, for example, it is not possible to do a school-based apprenticeship in a traditional trade.</p>
<p>  I want to work closely with Premiers and Chief Ministers to develop a national approach to training and apprenticeships. To do this we first need to recognise the problems and inconsistencies and then cooperate to iron out the irregularities between states and territories.</p>
<p>  I hope to see a lot of progress over the next six months. All governments have to work together to help our nation remain competitive and productive and to provide rewarding work opportunities for all Australians.</p>
