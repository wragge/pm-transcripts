OPENING OF THF 4TH ANNUAL CONFERENCE<br />
OF<br />
THE CONFEDERATION OF ASIAN<br />
CHAMBERS OF COMM-ERCE AND INDUSTRY<br />

PERTH, W. A. MAY 8, 1972.<br />
Speech by the Prime Minister, the Rt Hon. William. McMahon, CH, 14P<br />
President Park of the Confederation of Asian Chambers of<br />
Commerce, Delegates and Ladies and Gentlemen,<br />
Welcome to Australia and in particular a welcome to Perth<br />
one of our most attractive cities; and thank you, Mr. Blyton, for<br />
your warm introduction, and your kind remarks; and thanks to<br />
C. A. C. C. I. for holding its fourth conference here in Australia.<br />
It is a source of pride to the Australian Government to have this<br />
meeting here as a tangible demonstration of the importance of our<br />
relations with Asia and of the role of Chambers of Commerce in<br />
complementing the activities of Governments in the business and<br />
communercial are<br />
It is not really necessary to stress to you, as distinguished<br />
Asian business leaders, the vital connection between trade and<br />
development. All of our countries are linked together in the search<br />
for greater growth and development, and for growing and worthwhile<br />
mutual trade. But as you know these matters have to be seen against<br />
the background of the world economy as it exists and as we expect<br />
it to develop. In the last twelve months, international economic<br />
relationships have been disorganised and distorted by the monetary<br />
crises; established trade patterns have been distrubed.<br />
As a result of the Smithsonian Agreement late last December,<br />
the immediate threat relating to parity realignments has passed.<br />
But, clearly, not all of our Problems have been resolved. There<br />
remains the problem of whether, -and if so to what extent, longer term<br />
reform of the international monetary system is necessary. There<br />
remains the problem of maintaining a high rate of growth of output<br />
in the major industrialised countries. There is also the related<br />
world wide problem of the increase in the rate of inflation. Unless<br />
the advanced countries succeed in resolving these problems of<br />
stability and growth, they are not going to contribute in the most<br />
effective way to helping the problems of the developing countries. / 2 </p>
<p>Not only could aid policies be nullified, hut advanced<br />
nations would be oreoccupied by their own problems, rather than<br />
those of the It is obvious that in some of the rich<br />
countries there has been disenchantment with foreign aid, and there<br />
has been a sense of weariness that the problems of development are<br />
more intractable than had been widely supposed. I am happy to assure<br />
you that this is not the case in Australia. I believe the<br />
Australian people fully support the Government's view that we must<br />
have a strong foreign aid programme, and evidence of our goodwill<br />
is clearly established by the facts. The cumulative total of<br />
Australia's bilateral economic aid to Asia now is close to 400<br />
million dollars, But a sound and increasing aid programme does not<br />
mean that we cannot learn from the exoerience of others. Part of<br />
the disenchantment about aid has arisen from exaggerated expectations<br />
about its effect. Some have seen foreign aid as a kind of magic<br />
panacea to close the gap in living standards between countries.<br />
In reality, the problems of growth are much more complex;<br />
and foreign aid should properly be seen as a supplement to the<br />
efforts of the less developed countries. There should be an element<br />
not only of trust but also of modesty in our expectations for<br />
foreign aid. As well, I hope, as being modest we must be practical<br />
about what we can do. I do not want to exaggerate the role Australia<br />
can play. Australia does not presume to tell Asian countries how<br />
to run their economies. We leave such advice, if it is to be given<br />
at all, to the international institutions, if and when Asian<br />
countries ask them for it. Advice is much more easily taken from a<br />
relatively anonymous multilateral institution than from an<br />
individual country, however friedly and even indulgent. Here<br />
and nQw I want to mention the Asian Development Bank, which is<br />
growing steadily as an important influence in the region.<br />
Australia is giving the bank full support and legislative<br />
steps are now being taken to enable us to take up our share of the<br />
increase in the bank's authorised capital. Associated with this is<br />
another point I wish to emphasise strongly about our aid policy. It<br />
is that we have long been conscious of the debt problems of less<br />
developed countries in Asia, and so we have provided essentially<br />
grant aid. We have not asked for the payment of interest and we<br />
have not asked for our money back.<br />
The basic problem confronting donors remains. It is to<br />
adjust the terms of their aid to the repayment ca t. es of<br />
individual recipients. I find it distrubing th:. nnu:'. average<br />
growth rate of 10 per cent in debt service payl: ts is coni. erably<br />
higher than the rate of growth of the export earnings of the less<br />
developed countries. This means that debt repayments are mopping<br />
up an increasing share of hard-earned export revenue. It is not an<br />
irretrievable situation, but we have the impression that mnny<br />
countries have not really faced up to it. In too many cases the<br />
countries of the Asian and Pacific region face more inward looking<br />
trading policies by the industrialised countries and they face<br />
the development of trading blocs and the growth of tariff and<br />
non-tariff barriers to traditional products. / 3 </p>
<p>3.<br />
Turning to markets and trade, Asia offers an expanding<br />
market for certain raw materials and capital equipment, essential<br />
to the continued growth and diversification of its economies. Its<br />
imports twenty years ago were 6,750 million dollars Australian.<br />
In 1970 they were worth 40,700 million dollars Australian. This<br />
growth in import demand has brought an increased interest by<br />
Australian businessmen. Australian exporters once looked almost<br />
exclusively to the United Kingdom and Europe. But since the early<br />
1950' s there has been a pronounced trend towards increasing trade<br />
between Australia and Asia. In 1948/ 49, total two-way trade was<br />
only 310 million dollars Australian. Last year it was more than<br />
nine times greater. We now sell over 43% of our exports to Asia<br />
against only 15% in the late 1940' s.<br />
Almost a quarter of Australia's total imports now come<br />
from Asia, compared with less than a fifth in 1948/ 49. Japan is<br />
Australia's major overseas customer. Whilst we recognise that<br />
whilst aid has an important role to play in the development of the<br />
region, in the final analysis trade is preferred to aid as a means<br />
of attaining economic maturity. To help two-way trade, the<br />
Australian Government has entered into some bilateral trade<br />
agreements which recognise special features of trade between<br />
signatories and provide for Government-to-Government trade.<br />
Agreements are current with Japan, Malaysia, and the Republics of<br />
China, Indonesia, Korea and The Philippines.<br />
We have also supported realistic world commodity<br />
arrangements for many products which provide the bulk of export<br />
earnings for Asian countries. Within the total trade complex and<br />
the desirability of world commodity arrangements, we recognise that<br />
the nations of Asia are dependent on expanding exports of primary<br />
products to developed countries, and we share the concern of many<br />
Asian countries about the need for improved access to international<br />
markets for them. But commodity agreements are not in themselves<br />
enough . to solve the problems of the primary producing countries.<br />
A greater liberalisation of trade in agricultural<br />
products is required and this has been sadly lacking up t. ill now.<br />
I add that Australia warmly welcomed the declarations in February<br />
this year by the United States, the E. E, C. and Jctp.: n to work for<br />
freer trade in agricultural as well as industrial podcts. We are<br />
also aware that expanded trade with Asia will cpE. ldn i..-e.~ gly-upon<br />
the ability of the region to export profitably. hve . n<br />
prepared to back our beliefs and as early as we a system<br />
of non-reciprocal tariff preferences for manufact;:" red End semimanufactured<br />
goods and handicrafts from developing countries.<br />
A review has recently been completed and my colleague,<br />
the Minister for Trade and Industry, has recently announced at the<br />
UNCTAD Confecsnce in Santiago that some 200 additional items are<br />
to be added to the list of manufactures which benefit from this<br />
system as well as a number of other handicrafts. Providentially the<br />
countries of Asia have proved to be the major beneficiaries of this<br />
system. Last year some 80% of the imports entering under the<br />
preferential arrangements came from the region. </p>
<p>4.<br />
I emphasise, however, that the quotas are not being<br />
filled and that you as businessmen ensure that maximum<br />
advantage is taken of the system by the exporters of your countries.<br />
Equally, you should be aware that the Australian Government is<br />
willing to look at requests for existing quotas to be extended and<br />
for additional products to be included in the system.<br />
May I turn now to investment. I am pleased to note<br />
that the conference is devoting some time to the question of<br />
investment in Asia, which necessarily goes hand in hand with any<br />
discussion of trade and development. From our own experience,<br />
we in Australia, recognise the importance of foreign investment as<br />
a means of promoting growth, and even though Australia is still a<br />
net capital importer, we readily give approval for Australian firms<br />
to make direct investments in developing countries, especially in<br />
Asia, and I hope to see more firms doing so.<br />
We believe that direct investment accompanied by exports<br />
of technical know-how and managerial skills is a major means by<br />
which we can contribute to the development of the region. We<br />
recognise the natural preference of host countries for joint<br />
ventures as distinct from wholly foreign owned investments, and we<br />
must strengthen the transpcrt links and means of communication.<br />
Like some of our northern neighbours, Australia is an island nation.<br />
Our international commerce is carried almost entirely by sea. It is<br />
appropriate therefore that delegates to this conference should be<br />
examining this subject. Shipping technology has made tremendous<br />
advances in recent years. Mew types of ships, improved methods of<br />
Shandling cargoes and new concepts in transportation have been<br />
developed. You will be reviewing these requirements, assessing<br />
the role of both the Government and private sector in developing<br />
these facilities. It is from the decisions of business that these<br />
needs arise. I am sure we can expect a continued and accelerating<br />
growth in trade within the region and increasing contact between<br />
the businessme. of Asia and of Australia.<br />
There are already business co-ooeration committees<br />
involving Australian businessmen and those of Japan, Korea an3<br />
Indonesia. Exchanges of ideas within these committees and at<br />
conferences such as this will lead to a greater understanding of<br />
the trading problems confronting us in the 1970' s. Thank you again<br />
for inviting me and I have much pleasure in now declaring open the<br />
4th annual' eonference of the Confederation of Asian Chambers of<br />
Commerce and Industry. </p>
