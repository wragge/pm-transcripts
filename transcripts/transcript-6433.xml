PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT -SUNDAY PROGRAM 28 JULY 1984<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
JOURNALIST: It's just two weeks since the Labor Party<br />
National Conference ended in Canberra and the Prime Minister<br />
returned bathed in glory to the task of drawing up a pre-election<br />
Budget. It seems then that the only thing left to do was to<br />
chose a H~ ate for the early election. This week the Government wen-t off the<br />
rails somevhat the Mick Young affair which at first seemed under<br />
control blew up into a major political liability. It's a test<br />
of Bob Hawke's leadership now and especially when the inquiry<br />
by Mr Black QC reports next month. The Prime Minister joins<br />
us in our Canberra studios today. To interview him Richard<br />
Farmer, political correspondent of The Bulletin, Paul Kelly<br />
of the Sydney Morning Herald and Sunday's Robert Haupt.<br />
HAUPT: Thank you Jim. And thank you for joining us this<br />
morning Prime Minister.<br />
Thank you Robert.<br />
HAUPT: Well as you know to your this is the second time!<br />
round for Mick Young. Justice Hope found that he'd leaked<br />
national security information and left it to the Government to<br />
decide what to do. Now if Mr Black finds a Customs breach will<br />
Mick Young be allowed to stay on in the Ministry?<br />
There are two stages in this and let me be quite clear<br />
about them. On the Friday the 20th July when I received the<br />
report through the Minister for Customs, or the Minister for<br />
Industry and Commerce responsible for Customs, Senator Button<br />
on the basis of that report which expressed complete satisfaction<br />
as far as the Comptroller-General of Customs was concerned<br />
the Minister reported to me that he was satisfied and I accepted<br />
that. So was I. Now the matter as far as we were concerned was<br />
closed then. And that included the disclosed action of Mr Young<br />
and the treatment of it by the Customs. And let me remind you<br />
Robert that when Senator Button had reported this matter to mie<br />
on the day it occurred, the 5th of July, he had told me that he<br />
had instructed the Comptroller-General of Customs that Mr Young<br />
was to be treated no differently from anyone else. And I<br />
confirmed that that was the case and that it had to be. It was<br />
on the basis of no different treatment from anyone else that<br />
when the final report came to us on the 20th of July that the<br />
decision that no further action should be taken against Mr<br />
Young stood. Now that's to that point. Now on the Tuesday<br />
the 24th at 7.15 p. m. that evening Senator Button received </p>
<p>P. M. cont.: further information through Ihe Comptroller-General<br />
of Customs. He came to see-me at 9.30 at The Lodge. On the<br />
basis of that information we initiated interviews, brought pecople<br />
to Canberra the next day Wednesday the 25th and sent people<br />
to Adelaide. And therefore the answer to your question is that<br />
as a result of the inquiry that has now been initiated by us<br />
into a situation where there is now a conflict of evidence thEre<br />
must be, out of that inquiry into that conflict of evidence, there<br />
must be a clear -vindication of the actions and the statements of<br />
the Minister a fact which I think that he recognised in his<br />
press conference last Friday. There must be a clear vindication<br />
of his actions and statements. There can be no room for doubt: and<br />
associated with that there can be the emergence of no relevant<br />
information now which was not conveyed to the Minister, that's<br />
Senator Button, or myself.<br />
HAUPT: What you're saying is that the inquiry must exonerate<br />
Mick Young. But if there's some sort of an open finding or<br />
continued confusion that that simply won't be good enough for<br />
Mick Young. Yes there must be a clear exoneration and I believe<br />
that Mick in his statement on Friday made that clear. I mean<br />
I obviously can't go into all the details that have to examined<br />
by Mr Black. But there already is the case that in regard to<br />
one matter that has been canvassed in the press-since Thursday,<br />
an allegation made, and in respect of that allegation a very<br />
explicit repudiation of that that is in regard to the Customs<br />
form, a possible second Customs form nc-w Mr Young has clearly<br />
repudiated to the leadership of the Party that any such thing<br />
occurred. Now that's merely an example. But it's not proper<br />
for me to canvass those issues. I just give that as an<br />
illustration.<br />
FARMER: In that same press conference that Mr Young gave to<br />
which you referred he drew attention to what he thought was<br />
the position that if you set too high a standard for members<br />
of Parliament there wouldn't be any members of Parliament left<br />
of if there were any members left they'd all be crooks. I was<br />
just wondering what your view of that is.<br />
Well I think on the question of standards Mick will have<br />
to live by the standards which he himself set in his speech<br />
to the Parliament last year 1982 I riean on Mackellar/ Ploore.<br />
Mick set out the standards there and I guess people will say<br />
that they are the standards that should apply. But that's in<br />
a political sense. I am not at this point concerned with going<br />
to that area. This Government has acted impeccably on this issue.<br />
We've now referred the new information to Mr Black. You will<br />
appreciate that once we received that information on the Tuesday<br />
night, and then on the Wednesday got in -the results of those<br />
interviews, and we were faced with a conflict of evidence, it would<br />
not have been fair to anyone to make a judgement then. It would<br />
not have been fair to Mr Young. Importantly, it would not have<br />
been fair to certain officers of the Commonwealth Public Service,<br />
including those in Customs, to make a judgement for or against<br />
them. And it wouldn't have been fair to the public. So we had<br />
to create the situation where someone else could examine all those<br />
/ 3 </p>
<p>P. M. cont.: facts which we were not capable-of doing, and then<br />
make that judgement. I would just if I could make this point about<br />
the whole affair it has been said in respect of Mick Young t: hat<br />
he has not learnt from his experience during the Combe Ivanov<br />
Royal Commission. Now that's to be decided by an inquiry of<br />
Mr Black. One thing you don't need an inquiry into to determine<br />
where there hasn't been a learning is in respect of the Opposition.<br />
You will recall that in the period of the Cornbe Ivanov Royal<br />
Commnission Mr Peacock and others around him were going qff in<br />
the Parliament and outside attacking the Government saying here's<br />
a cover-up etc. Now, of course, it was not true then and there<br />
was a complete vindication of our actions. of course in their<br />
hopelessness now they are accusing Senator Button and myself and<br />
the Government of a cover-up. There has been no cover-up and it's<br />
a pity that they wouldn't learn from their-own mistakes.<br />
KELLY: Mr Hawke, I wonder if you've learnt from what happened<br />
last year. In particular do you believe that you made a mistake<br />
bringing Mr Young back to the Cabinet last year after a fairly<br />
tough finding against him by Mr Justice Hope. You told us then<br />
that Mick Young had learnt his lesson. Do you still say that<br />
today? Well obviously the answer to that Paul I mean it is so<br />
obvious I'm surprised you ask it I have put to you quite clearly<br />
in answer to the previous-questions that as of Tuesday night new<br />
information, including allegations, became available. How can<br />
I answer your question when I have appointed an inquiry in the<br />
person of Mr Black to investigate those allegations. Now if<br />
it is found, and I stress if, if it should be found by Mr Black<br />
against Mr Young, then I'd be in a position to answer your question.<br />
And it would have to be yes. But that's obviously until we get<br />
the report of Mr Black hypothetical.<br />
FARMER: Prime Minister are you satisifed that Senator Button<br />
acted thoroughly enough when he was first told by his<br />
Comptroller-General of Customs that there was this problem with<br />
Mr Young's return. It does seem remarkable that new evidence<br />
should have come up. How could that happen if the intial inquiry<br />
was Well1 you understand the mechanics of these things. He,<br />
as Minister for Industry and Commerce, has Customs under his<br />
control. The Comptroller-General who is also the Secretary<br />
of his Department has an independent authority as you appreciate<br />
as Comptroller-General of Customs. Now Senator Button not only<br />
acted properly but he behaved absolutely impeccably throughout<br />
this. As soon as he was told on the 5th of July that this<br />
problem had arisen his first direction to the Comptroller-General<br />
was, as I have said, that Mr Young should have no special<br />
treatment. He should be treated as any other citizen. That was<br />
what was done. Now the next step as it were was that there<br />
were questions to Mr Young conducted, not by Senator Button, but<br />
through the Comptroller-General of Customs where it had to be done.<br />
There was then the necessary delay until the 11th of July befor<br />
Mrs Young returned from overseas. And then following that further<br />
inquiries. And on the 20th of July the delivery to Senator<br />
Button of a report which concluded, the report concluded, that<br />
the Comptroller-General regarded the matter as closed. It was ./ 4 </p>
<p>4.<br />
P. M. cont.: not until he got that report from the Comptroller-<br />
General that Senator Button made his judgement, conveyed it tc'<br />
me and I concurred in that judgement. Now his behaviour till<br />
then was impeccable, absolutely ensuring no preferential<br />
treatment. And then on the Tuesday, it was at 7. l5, that in<br />
a telephone conversation it was conveyed to him by the<br />
Comptroller-General that new information had come to the<br />
Comptroller-General.<br />
FARMER: That me-ans that the Comptroller-General hadn't been<br />
far enough into<br />
Well it doesn't necessarily mean that. I mean as a matter<br />
of logic, please Richard, understand that. I mean if the<br />
Comptroller-General had done the best he could to follow it<br />
up and then for some reason which the Comptroller-General would<br />
not be aware of some officer then makes another statement, then<br />
as soon as he became aware of these new statements the Comptroller-<br />
General immediately contacted Senator Button. Now the Senator<br />
when he was contacted at 7.15 p. m. Tuesday night, he contacted<br />
me and came to The Lodge at 9.35. And together we immediately<br />
initiated the action to get the people to Canberra and to send<br />
people to Adelaide so that the investigations could be undertaken.<br />
Now that was starting at 9.30 at The Lodge on the Tuesday night.<br />
The enquiries and the interviews were taking place then on<br />
Wednesday, the 25th, and it was by the end of the 25th that I<br />
was then able to have the four Leaders together, which obviously<br />
included Senator Button who is also one of the Leaders as well<br />
as being the Minister and we were then proceeding to deal<br />
with it. We'd made a prima facie conclusion as to the necessi~ ty<br />
for an inquiry and standing Mr Young aside. We talked with hi _ m<br />
the following morning and that was the course of action that<br />
was pursued. Now the action of Senator Button at all points<br />
has been impeccable. 1<br />
HAUPT: At that point, Mr Prime Minister, when you made the<br />
decision to appoint Mr Black to a special. inquiry, you were<br />
treating Mr Young in way that an ordinary citizen would not<br />
have been treated. An ordinary citizen would have had this<br />
new evidence assessed either by-the Customs Bureau.. or Customs<br />
investigators or. by the Federal Police.<br />
Well in respect of the ordinary treatment of Mr Young<br />
vis a vis another citizen, that was done in regard to the<br />
information up until the 20th he paid his penalty. Now what you<br />
had at this point, after the Tuesday evening, were two sets<br />
of considerations and I'm sorry Robert but if you think it<br />
through, and you've got a good logical mind, you'll see that<br />
what you're spinning around on is not accurate. There are<br />
two things that have to be dealt with and they are being<br />
dealt with absolute propriety. The first. is that Mr Young<br />
was a Minister and there needed to be an inquiry in regard to<br />
what had happened to him. So he had to be stood aside. He<br />
couldn't stay as a minister while that inquiry was going on.<br />
So he was stood aside. Now in regard to anything that may<br />
involve or require action against Mr Young or anyone else<br />
as a result of those enquiries that will be done in respect<br />
of Mr Young or any other person in exactly the same way as<br />
it would be in regard to any other citizen. </p>
<p>RAUPT: But what you're assessing here is the-propriety of Mr<br />
Young continuing in the Ministry..<br />
Now wait a minute you are partly right but there is<br />
more than that. The question of his propriety and the properness<br />
of him staying on as a Minister is in issue. And so he stands<br />
aside while the inquiry is going on. But there is also the<br />
question involved in the allegations and the evidence that<br />
has been put forward not only as to whether Mr Young has<br />
done something improper but there's also the questions that<br />
arise as to whether other people might have done something<br />
improper. It's not just Mr Young. And so out of this inquiry<br />
there might have to be recommendations for action against a<br />
number of people. Now this is the perfectly proper and normal<br />
way of going about this.<br />
KELLY: Mr Hawke I wonder if we could just quickly look at two<br />
other areas of policies. First of all aboriginal land rights.<br />
Yes.<br />
KELLY: You said during the election campaign that you were<br />
committed to uniform land rights bill. Do you still stand by<br />
that. And secondly, would you reaffirm your commitment which<br />
was endorsed by the recent Labor Party National Conference to<br />
phase out funds for wealthy private schools.<br />
The first question is quite clear and the Minister has<br />
been pursuing since we've been in Government the process which<br />
he promised the Australian people-he would do. That is we were<br />
not going to be a Government which was going to rush in and<br />
impose our will without consultation with all the interests<br />
involved. And those interests involved include the aboriginal<br />
people themselves, that includes the mine owners, it includes<br />
the rural interests and it includes the States. And my Minister,<br />
Mr Holding, has in fact been painstakingly engaged in those<br />
processes. We're not going to rush into it but we retain an<br />
absolute commitment. And as distinct from the Opposition we<br />
won't be walking away from principle. It's going to be<br />
very interesting I may say to see whether Mr Malcolm Fraser is<br />
going to disown his successor on this abandonment of principle.<br />
We won't be walking away from ours. Now in regard to the<br />
question of funds for education we have been engaged in<br />
detailed discussions with represenatives of all interests in<br />
the education system. That is the Government schools, the<br />
teachers, the Catholic systemic school area and the non-Catholic<br />
private school area. And I'm saying to you that I believe tha~ t<br />
the decisions that will be announced in the very near future<br />
by Senator Susan Ryan will meet the proper requirements of all.<br />
Australians in regard to education. And that is that irrespective<br />
of the creed or the income positions of their parents every<br />
Australian child should have the right to the development of his<br />
or her talent. That will be achieved.<br />
HAUPT: Mr Prime Minister thank you very much for joining us<br />
this morning. Thank you very much. </p>
