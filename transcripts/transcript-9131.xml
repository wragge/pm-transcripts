C. PRIME MINISTER<br />
MEMBERSHIP OF THE COUNCIL OF AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENTS'<br />
CENTENARY OF FEDERATION ADVISORY COMMITTEE<br />
The Government has finalised today the membership of the Centenary of Federation<br />
Advisory Comnmittee.<br />
The Council of Australian Governments ( COAG) agreed last year to establish a<br />
broadly based National Advisory Committee to advise it on goals and strategies for the<br />
centenary of federation in 2001.<br />
COAG decided that the Committee should comprise representatives of each State and<br />
Territory, a Commonwealth appointed Chairperson and such further persons,<br />
appointed by the Commonwealth, as might be needed to ensure that the Committee as<br />
a whole was broadly representative of the community.<br />
The Committee will be chaired by the Hon Joan Kirner, AM and will have as members<br />
the following:<br />
Commonwealth appointments<br />
Mr Phillip Adams, AO broadcaster and Chairman, National Australia Day<br />
Council Ms Robyn Archer actor and writer<br />
Ms Marilyn Beaumont Federal Secretary, Australian Nursing Federation<br />
Ms Michelle Grattan Editor, Canberra Times<br />
Ms Marcia Langton anthropologist<br />
Ms Helen Patsikatheodorou child-care and community worker<br />
Ms Lesley Podesta management consultant<br />
Ms Dana Wortley education consultant and education editor, the Adelaide<br />
Advertiser 4651 </p>
<p>2<br />
State and Territory appointments<br />
The Hon Sir Max Bingham, QC ( Tasmania)<br />
The Hon Jennifer Cashmore, MI-A ( South Australia)<br />
The Hon Mr Justice Sir James Gobbo, AC ( Victoria)<br />
The Hon Bill Hassell ( Western Australia)<br />
Mr Robert Maher ( New South Wales)<br />
* The Hon Jim Robertson ( Northern Territory)<br />
Associate Professor Marian Sawer, AO ( Australian Capital Territory)<br />
Mr David Williams ( Queensland)<br />
Under the terms of reference agreed by COAG the Committee will provide an options<br />
paper for consideration by COAG setting out possible goals and strategies for<br />
centenary-related activities in the years leading up to, and including, the centenary.<br />
The Commnittee has been asked to draw on the views of the community through wide<br />
ranging consultations. The paper is to be completed by July 1994.<br />
The Committee is to take as an over-riding objective the building of a better sense of<br />
national identity and purpose among Australians and is to give emphasis to activities<br />
that will have enduring and worthwhile results that go beyond simply marking the<br />
occurrence of the centenary.<br />
The commemoration of the centenary of federation, and the events leading up to it, is<br />
an opportunity for all Australians to celebrate the achievements of the first hundred<br />
years of federation and to reflect on the challenges facing our nation as we approach<br />
the 2 1st century. I hope the entire community will participate whole-heartedly in it.<br />
A Secretariat for the Committee is being provided by my Department. The Secretary<br />
is Mr Gavin Fry and the Secretariat can be contacted on ( 06) 271 5128.<br />
