11 April 1997 TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME M[ INISTER.<br />
THE HON JOHN HOWARD MP<br />
ADDRESS TO THE NSW DIVISION OF THE LIBERAL PARTY<br />
FIRST ANNIVERSARY DINNER SYDNEY<br />
E&amp; OE<br />
Thank you very much Rod for those very gracious and extremely generous remarks.<br />
To Michael Osborne, the President of the Liberal Party in NSW; to my parliamentary<br />
colleagues Federal and State, and particularly I acknowledge the presence of the<br />
Leader of the NSW Opposition Peter Collins, and could I also acknowledge the<br />
presence of two other people -the recently preselected new Senator from NSW Mahse<br />
Payne who is replacing Bill Heffernan ( sic), and also my predecessor as leader of the<br />
Federal Parliamentary Liberal Party, John Hewson.<br />
It is a great night of celebration, you are absolutely right there were numerous<br />
occasions Rod when I thought I'd never make it. There were numerous occasions<br />
when a lot of people in this room thought I'd never make it, and there were many of<br />
those occasions when they had good reason to believe that I would never make it.<br />
And it is one of those occasions when all of us are entitled to take a deal of quiet<br />
satisfaction in what has been achieved over the last year. To be out of office for 13<br />
years between 1983 and 1996 and given the pace of modem life is the equivalent I<br />
guess of having been out of office between 1949 and 1972. And as the first few years<br />
rolled into five or six years and then ultimately doubled into a decade or more, there<br />
must have been many people in this room who wondered whether they would ever live<br />
to see the election of another federal Liberal Government and I do want to say first and<br />
foremost to all of you and my heartfelt thanks for the tremendous loyalty and support<br />
that you have demonstrated over the years in very difficult and often trying and<br />
challenging and frustrating circumstances to the Liberal Party cause.<br />
I think it is very important on an occasion like this that those of us who are lucky<br />
enough to hold elected office, and I do regard it as a privilege and I do regard it as the<br />
greatest privilege that could come the way of any Australian to be Prime Minister of<br />
this magnificent country. It is an occasion, an occasion like tonight to acknowledge on<br />
behalf of all of my colleagues, the tremendous support that you have given. And I also<br />
want to thank those in the room who have worked so hard over the years to raise<br />
resources for the Liberal Party. I've always been very sensitive to their problem. I<br />
Fawx ~ 13/ 84/ 97 12: 25 Pg: 1 </p>
<p>Fax from 13/ 04/ 97 12: 25 Pg: 2<br />
can understand how hard it must have been to raise a dollar for the Liberal Party over<br />
the last few years and there must have been occasions where you wondered whether it<br />
was really worth it. I've always tried to sort of synchronise my own efforts with those,<br />
and although there are limits that one has to draw, I've had on several occasions to tell<br />
Liberal Party f'undraisers, that I can't sell any nights in either the Fraser or Whitlam<br />
bedrooms at the Lodge, but I can nonetheless say that a close conjunction between the<br />
Parliamentary party and the organisation is tremendously important.<br />
But tonight most importantly of all is an occasion to reflect on some of the things that<br />
we have been able to do together over the last year. And I emphasise the word<br />
together because it has been a team effort. I've operated on the principle that a Prime<br />
Mnister is nothing more than a first amongst equals and I want to thank all of my<br />
cabinet and Parliamentary colleagues. There's one person I will single out for special<br />
mention and that is the Deputy Prime Minister and Leader of the National Party, Tim<br />
Fischer. Tim Fischer is a remarkably loyal and decent deputy. Hie stood up for some<br />
very diflicizlt decisions of the government and I have particularly in mind the decision<br />
we took about uniform gun laws, often in the face of some very difficult circumstances<br />
within his own immediate constituency and I particularly wanted tonight as he wings<br />
his way to Goondiwindi for the National Party conference in QLD, I particularly<br />
wanted to acknowledge the magnificent contribution that Tim has made to the stability<br />
and strength of our government and also the magnificent job that Timi has done as the<br />
Mnister for Trade and Deputy Prime Minister.<br />
There were a number of key things that we talked about in the lead up to the election<br />
campaign and what we've tried to do in the twelve or more months that we have been<br />
in office. I think if you reflect on those weeks and months leading up to the election,<br />
you will remember that we placed a great deal of emphasis on industrial relations<br />
reform. I guess of all things that I've argued for over the last ten or fifteen years, none<br />
has been more prominent than my belief that this country needs a fundamentally<br />
different industrial relations system, and although it is true that because we didn't have<br />
control of the Senate, we weren't able to get through in its entirety all that we would<br />
have wanted in the area of industrial relations and I don't dissemble about that and I<br />
don't pretend. We were able nonetheless to achieve the fundamental changes that we<br />
wanted to make and I believe that over time those changes, particularly in the small<br />
business area, will deliver a different and fundamentally changed industrial relations<br />
system. We've not only got rid of those very silly unfair dismissal laws that were the<br />
bane of the existence of so many men and women in business for so many years under<br />
the former government, but we have finally got rid at a federal level of the last vestiges<br />
of compulsory unionism. We have brought back the rule of law in the area of<br />
secondary boycotts to the ordinary courts of Australia. We have entrenched into the<br />
industrial relations law of Australia the notion that the best arrangement between an<br />
employer and an employee is the arrangement voluntarily forged at the workplace level<br />
based upon their common interest in the enterprise being successful. We have begun<br />
to entrench that in the industrial relations laws of Australia. And as I look back over<br />
the last 13 months I can feel very well satisfied, not complacent, not smug, but satisfied<br />
that we have achieved that essential objective. I talked a lot, also during the election<br />
campaign, about the importance of the family unit in our society, not in any moralising<br />
or sanctimonious sense families come in different forms and different shapes. Not all<br />
fhmilies are happy, not all families are successful, but that doesn't gainsay the fact that </p>
<p>Fax from it remains the most important and the most cohesive institution within our society, and<br />
it remains the role of' governments, not in a hectoring or moralising sense, but in a<br />
positive sense, to implement policies that support families and most particularly<br />
support families in the choices that they make. And I'm very proud of the fact that we<br />
delivered on time to the very last dollar without any qualification the family tax<br />
initiative that I promised during the election campaign.<br />
We also talked a great deal in the election campaign about the role of small business<br />
within our community. Small business has been politic-ally something of an obsession<br />
of mine and as a lot of you know it is because of my own background, because my<br />
father ran a very small business for a long time and worked very hard and as a result of<br />
that he gave to his four children a far more comfortable start in their lives than had<br />
been his situation many many years ago, and that is very much the story of so many<br />
men and women in Australia and we have tried very hard, without seeing the business<br />
arena as a confrontation between big and small businesses, but recognising that if you<br />
can create a climate of risk taking, if you can create an entrepreneurial climate, an<br />
atmosphere for small business, you are far more likely through invigorating them than<br />
any other approach over time to do something about dragging down our<br />
unemployment levels.<br />
We have set about implementing all and indeed in one area more than what we<br />
promised at the time of the last election for small business. We've not only given them<br />
the provisional tax relief, the industrial relations reform, the relief from the unfair<br />
dismissal laws, but in the area of capital gains tax from the first of July this year, it will<br />
be possible for any man or woman operating a small business in Australia, either solely<br />
through a partnership, through a trust, or through shares in a company to sell that<br />
business and invest up to five million dollars of the proceeds of that business in any<br />
other kind of business, it doesn't have to be a like kind of business, without incurring<br />
any liability at all for capital gains tax. And there will be many of you in this room who<br />
will know that over time that particular reform will draw into the small business<br />
community of Australia, the investment and the commitment and the talents of<br />
increasing numbers of people who will see that particular approach to taxation as being<br />
very attractive.<br />
We also, in the lead up to the election campaign, talked a great deal about the<br />
importance of having a balance between development and the environment. As not<br />
only a participant in Australian politics, but I hope something of an amateur political<br />
scientist and something of an observer of the political scene as well as a participant and<br />
you can in a sense be both, one of the big changes that I have seen over the last<br />
years is the way in which concern for the environment has become a mainstream<br />
political issue. 20 years ago concern for the environment was still looked upon rather<br />
suspiciously by many people who supported the Liberal Party. It was regarded as a<br />
trendy issue, perhaps on occasions an issue that had been taken over by the left wing of<br />
politics and really not something that resonated with the business and free enterprise<br />
principles and commitments of the Liberal Party. But over the years that has changed<br />
and I think concern for the environent has become a mainstream issue for all<br />
generations of Australians, and that is why in the lead up to the election we determined<br />
that we would have very strong environmental credentials. We said that we would sell<br />
one third of Telstra and we would use one billion dollars of the proceeds of that sale to<br />
Faro m13/ 04/ 97 12: 25 Pg: 3 </p>
<p>Fax from establish the Natural Heritage Trust of Australia and I am very happy to say that we<br />
were able to achieve that.<br />
The Natural Heritage Trust of Australia will be established this year, the legislation has<br />
gone through and I'll have the opportunity early next month to launch the Natural<br />
Heritage Trust of Australia appropriately enough in the Blue Mountains just west of<br />
Sydney in the electorate of Macquarie, which was one of the electorates won by the<br />
Liberal Party from the Labor Party at the last election. And what we have been able to<br />
do in thi s area I believe, and it is very important to the long term strength and health of<br />
the Liberal Party is that we have been able to disabuse our critics of the notion that we<br />
are disinterested in environmental protection, but we've been able to do it in a way that<br />
resonates with our business and our other obligations and trying to have a balance<br />
between the environment and business concerns is very very important to the future<br />
development of Australia,<br />
Now, ladies and gentlemen, they are just some of the things that I recall that we talked<br />
loudly and strongly about in the lead up to the election campaign. I don't intend to<br />
weary you with a long and detailed list but they are a sample of the things that we<br />
regarded as important and examples of the things that we have remained true to in the<br />
thirteen months that we have been in government. But a government is more than just<br />
a series of promises kept or programmes delivered-A government is very much about<br />
a style and an approach and an attitude and one of the most important things that I<br />
have endeavoured to do, I don't know whether it has been entirely successfiul, I hope it<br />
has, but I'll continue to try and do it, and that is to try and restore a greater sense of<br />
civility in political life in Australia. I think for a long time we were going down the<br />
path of losing all civility in public life and in politics in Australia and I do have to say<br />
that nothing disillusions the young in our community more than a sense that public life<br />
lacks any sense of civility and any sense of if' you like, call it in old-fashioned words,<br />
good manners and a proper respect for the other pers on's point of view. And the<br />
remark that I am about to make I hope nobody thinks for a moment that after being<br />
Prime Minister for 13 months that I've gone soft or in any way lost my commitment to<br />
the cause of the Liberal Party, but one of the things that I feel pleased about that I have<br />
been able to do over the last 13 months is to preserve a capacity when it is ini the<br />
national interest to do so to have a rational discussion with the Leader of the<br />
Opposition. I think it is important.... ( applause)... and one example that I can recall<br />
recently, we found ourselves sitting at the same table at a dinner in Melbourne to mark<br />
the 10th anniversary of the establishment of Care Australia, and it was a the height of<br />
the difficulties in Papua New Guinea and we were able to for a period of time to have a<br />
serious discussion about the problems that that particular crisis presented for Australia.<br />
Now, as I say that is not an indication that the rules of politics have changed, it is not<br />
an indication that I regarded the advice that I received as being superior from the views<br />
that I had formed, but I hope it is the role always of a Prime Minister in a country such<br />
as Australia to recognise that however emphatic a victory may have been it remains the<br />
case that something between 40 45% of the Australian community voted for the<br />
alternative. And I2th ink Prime Ministers and leaders who lose sight of that lose touch<br />
with the reality of life in Australian politics. They deserve the description of arrogant,<br />
they deserve the description of being out of touch, they deserve the description of<br />
Fa rom13/ 04/ 97 12: 25 Pg: 4 </p>
<p>Fax from~ 13/ 64/ 97 12: 25 Pg:<br />
elitism which is on past occasions in relation to others and I hope not about in the<br />
future myself; or any members of the Liberal Party, those allegations that will be made.<br />
When I reflect on the events of the past year, I reflect as I said earlier with enormous<br />
pride in the great degree of loyalty and the great degree of strength and support that I<br />
have received from my colleagues from the business community and from the Party<br />
organisation. Tonight does comprise quite understandably a very large number of men<br />
and women from the business community here in Sydney. I value the links that I have<br />
with the business community of Sydney. I value the links that I have with the business<br />
community all around Auistralia. We are not, as the Liberal Party, we are not unlike<br />
our opponents, we are not beholden to any one section of the Australian community.<br />
We are not owned by the trade union movement, we are not owned by the business<br />
community either large or small, we are not owned by individual pressure groups, but<br />
we do have a broad coincidence of views with the business community. The values<br />
and the priorities of the business community are similar to the values and the priorities<br />
of the Liberal Party. We won't always agree. Over the past year, some of you have<br />
had occasion to criticise us on some issues and that is how it should occur in a<br />
democracy, and it is foolish even at a gathering like this where everybody thinks in<br />
such positive terms and reflects with such gratitude on the past year, it is natural that<br />
people should be like that, nonetheless I acknowledge that there are things that over<br />
the last year we have done that you would have wished we hadn't done.<br />
I'd be deluding myself for example if I didn't acknowledge there'd be one or two<br />
people in this room who disagreed with our decision, for example, to impose that<br />
superannuation Surcharge. I'm not wrong I understand that, and I think it is<br />
important that I acknowledge that, I think it is important that I know by the reaction<br />
that you really expected me to acknowledge it, and also for me to say that I know that<br />
decisions like that displease people. I hope you understand that in putting together last<br />
year's budget we felt that one of the measures which would give to it within the<br />
broader Australian community a feeling that the pain had been shared around equally<br />
within the community, was that particular measure. I know it is not popular, I<br />
acknowledge that, but I ask you to accept and to understand that within the broader<br />
context that I have just described that that particular decision was needed in order to<br />
convey that overall sense of fairness and that overall sense of balance.<br />
I've spoken, ladiet and gentlemen, very much of what has happened over the last year.<br />
We have before us at the present time, several issues of a degree of complexity and an<br />
order of difficulty that few governments in Australia have faced for a long time. I can't<br />
think of an issue which any government in Australia in recent years has faced which is<br />
a complicated as the difficulties thrown up by the decision of the Nigh Court of<br />
Australia in the Wik case. If I can just say for a moment that this particular issue<br />
confronts the government and the Australian community with a need to take a choice<br />
that will respect two apparently conflicting objectives. One of those is to respect<br />
profoundly the desire I think of most Australians to see justice done to the original<br />
inhabitants of this country. I have little doubt that most Australians believe as is the<br />
cowe that as a group the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people of Australia<br />
remain the most underprivileged section of the Australian community as a group. I<br />
equally have little doubt that many Australians are angry and frustrated that the very<br />
large amounts of money which have been committed towards relieving that </p>
<p>Fax from disadvantage appear to have achieved so little, and they have questioned the priorities<br />
and approaches which have been involved in the provision of that money. And they<br />
ask questions about whether the methodology which has been employed in the past is<br />
really the appropriate methodology to be employed in the future. And the negative<br />
symbolism of such issues as that disgraceful saga over the Hindrnarsh Bridge in South<br />
Australia, where believe it or not because of a vote in the Senate only a few weeks<br />
ago, we faced the real possibility of yet another inquiry because of the requirements of<br />
the law passed by the former government. I can't estimate and I don't think any of the<br />
observers of this scene can estimate the damage that has been done within the attitude<br />
of the general Australian community to the cause of the genuine relief of the<br />
disadvantage of Australian Aborigines as such things as the Hindiuarsh B~ ridge. It<br />
represents a disgraceful symbol of political correctness doing its worst in the area of<br />
indigenous affairs in Australia. But on the other hand, the Wik decision has presented<br />
or the pastoralists and the miners of Australia an intolerable and unacceptable level of<br />
instability and uncertainty. The notion that the occupation and ownership of land<br />
which has often been in a family for several generations, might with the stroke a pen,<br />
even of such as imminent body as the Hi1gh Court of Australia be rendered uncertain<br />
and under a cloud is something that quite understandably has produced a wave of<br />
instability, concern and even anger throughout the rural community of Australia and it<br />
is the responsibility of my government and the responsibility of my Cabinet and the<br />
Parliament within the very near future to produce a response to that particular decision<br />
that respects the desire of the Australian community to do justice by the Aboriginal<br />
people of this country, but also gives to our pastoralists, to the mining industry and to<br />
other people affected, a proper measure of security and predictability, because I can<br />
think of few scenarios involving a greater nightmare than the possibility that virtually<br />
block by block over years to come, litigation will be waged over ownership of<br />
something over 50% of the land mass of Australia and that according to some views of<br />
the implications of the Wik decision is the kind of difficulty that we face. That<br />
particular decision will challenge all of the sense of justce and the sense of<br />
commitment to fair outcomes that we can as a government and as a Party muster.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen on a personal note, of course tonight is a night of personal<br />
celebration and personal satisfaction but it is a night that does very much belong to<br />
people other than to me. I would never have been leader of the Liberal Party and I<br />
certainly would never have been Prime Minister of Australia had it not been for the<br />
Liberal Party organisation. It is common when you get elected to a position like Prime<br />
Minister of Australia for people to say nice things about you and you appreciate them,<br />
for them to compliment you on what you've done. It's common for people to speak of<br />
the qualities that you may or may not have. But as somebody who has committed all<br />
of his adult life to the Liberal Party cause through thick and thin, somebody who has<br />
spent many years in the Liberal Party organisation, I do owe an enormous debt of<br />
gratitude to a very large number of people who are in this room. People who in a<br />
sense they represent who helped me on earlier occasions, And the sense of<br />
comradeship and the sense of teamwork that I have always found in the Liberal Party,<br />
even in its more diffcult times and even when there have been occasions when perhaps<br />
I thought it hasn't made the right decisions in relation to both policy and personnel, has<br />
been one of the sustaining things of my adult life. Fa om13/ 04/ 97 12: 25 Pg: 6 </p>
<p>Fax from It has been an enormous privilege to lead the Liberal Party and even more so over the<br />
last thirteen months to be the Prime Minister of Australia. There are many happy<br />
recollections I have of the last 13 months, but I think probably the one that I have<br />
found the most enduring is the fact that when Janette and I and our family again<br />
journeyed to Hawks Nest at the beginning of this year, determined to repeat an annual<br />
pattern of the last fifteen or sixteen years, and I went walking along the beach early in<br />
the morning and I seem to see the same faces and I seem to receive most of the same<br />
greetings that I had received on earlier occasions and they were very friendly<br />
greetings, most of them. But I am pleased to report that one or two of them were<br />
most unfriendly and it was that sort of sense of reality and a reminder that there's<br />
something about this country which enables that sort of interrelation between people<br />
and Prime Minister that you simply wouldn't receive in any other society.<br />
I said when 1 was interviewed for an ABC programme before the election when I was<br />
asked the question " How did I want Australia to be in the Year 2000?" and I coined a<br />
phrase which like other politicians has hung around my neck. Ben Chifley had ' the<br />
light on the hill'; Howard McMillan had ' the winds of change', and ' you have never<br />
had it so good'; Malcolm Fraser had ' life was not meant to be easy'; and I coined the<br />
expression that I wanted Australians to feel ' relaxed and comfortable' about<br />
themselves. I really did mean it, and what I meant by that was very much that I think<br />
this is a country that ought to be relaxed and comfortable in the sense that what it has<br />
achieved since its existence began has been immense by comparison with other nations.<br />
The degree of social justice in this country. The degree of egalitarianism still, although<br />
it is not as great sadly as it once used to be, and the respect in which the country is<br />
held in other parts of the world and that was driven home to me very strongly during<br />
my recent visit to China, when I realised what immense advantages Australia brought<br />
in a relationship with a country of that size. We bring with us the gifts of being part of<br />
western civilisation which we clearly are, but we don't bring as others might, some of<br />
the disadvantages of a previous history which has not been as positive in our relations<br />
with China as other countries and that experience of only a week or ten days ago, was<br />
a reminder again of the tremendous potential and the tremendous opportunities that<br />
this country has.<br />
So when I talk about being relaxed and comfortable, I talk about a country that can<br />
feel proud of what it has achieved although recognising that there were and remain<br />
blemishes, A country which is confident of its current identity, and a country which is<br />
also positive that whatever formal shape that identity may take in the future and that in<br />
our appropriate style we can debate those issues as we will increasingly as we draw<br />
towards the constitutional convention and we'll debate them in a tolerant harmonious<br />
respectfuli fashion. We'll recognise that there are many amongst us who believe that<br />
the current constitutional arrangements remain very effective and very relevant. There<br />
will also be many amongst us who have another view and one of the great strengths of<br />
the Liberal Party over the last year in government is that it has been able to manage<br />
some of these issues and encompass within our ranks people who have different views<br />
on issues of that kind without those differences becoming matters of public discord and<br />
matters of public division.<br />
So they were the sort of things that I had in mind when I spoke 14 months ago of<br />
Australians feeling relaxed and comfortable. It wasn't the clarion call of a complacent<br />
Fa om13/ 84/ 97 12: 25 Pg: 7 </p>
<p>Fax from person. It was rather som~ ebody who was endeavouring to describe in his own<br />
language what he sees as some of the enduring and distinctive characteristics of being<br />
and Australian.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen, can I again thank all of you for tonight. Can I thank all of you<br />
for the tremendous financial and other support that you have given to our Party over a<br />
long period of time. Can I especially thank my wife Janette who is with me tonight and<br />
all of the other people who have played such a very important and close personal role<br />
in my life over the last year. It has been a year of tremendous achievement, a year of<br />
great satisfaction but most importantly and I am grateftul for Rod having said it, most<br />
impor-tantly we have endeavoured to conduct it in a way that we have laid a solid<br />
foundation for I hope to be many years into the future. We waited long years in<br />
opposition, they were very frustrating, they were very demanding, they were very<br />
debilitating and it made the achievement of office all the greater and all the better and<br />
all the more to be savoured and all the more to be used for the greater betterment and<br />
for the good of all of the Australian people. I thank all of you very much for your<br />
support, your loyalty, your understanding and you commitment to. our common future.<br />
Thank you. Fafrrt13/ 04/ 97 12: 25 Pg: 8 </p>
