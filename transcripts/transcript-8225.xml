CHECK AGATNST DELIVERY EMBARGOED UNTIL. DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOREIGN CORRESPONDENTS' CLUB<br />
SYDNEY 10 DECEMBER 1990<br />
I very much welcome the opportunity to speak to you today.<br />
From our different perspectives I, as the Prime Minister<br />
of a country profoundly concerned with international<br />
developments and you, as correspondents reporting on those<br />
developments we share a deep interest in the fascinating<br />
and crucial transition underway in international relations.<br />
How that transition is managed and where it comes out will<br />
provide the international backdrop for all the objectives<br />
Australia must pursue in the 1990s economic, social, even<br />
environmental and will have a major impact on our lives.<br />
Now these issues have a very broad sweep. But there is no<br />
more relevant starting point than the immediate crisis at<br />
the top of the international agenda right now. For in the<br />
crisis in the Gulf are encapsulated many of the more general<br />
lessons and challenges crucial to international affairs in<br />
the last decade of this century.<br />
My friends<br />
In my statement to the Parliament last week I listed a<br />
number of reasons why Australia's interests warranted our<br />
active involvement in efforts to resolve the Gulf crisis to<br />
the point a most grave and serious point of military<br />
involvement in a possible conflict. I said then that the<br />
interest which stood higher than all others was the<br />
establishment and maintenance of an international order<br />
based on the principles enshrined in the Charter of the<br />
United Nations: that international disputes must not be<br />
settled by force; that national borders must be respected;<br />
and that aggressors must not be permitted to prevail.<br />
This was no effort to cloak in the language of principles<br />
some other Australian motive in the Gulf. It was not a<br />
rhetorical exercise in giving our involvement<br />
respectability. Above all, it was not some abstract,<br />
intangible and. obscure objective of which I was speaking. I<br />
was talking here about concrete, vital Australian interests. </p>
<p>Of these Australian interests the more narrow and direct is<br />
this that if this geographically vast country of only 17<br />
million people were ever to be threatened we would certainly<br />
want the international community, through the United<br />
Nations, standing resolutely with us. And the same is true<br />
of our friends in the region should any threat to them<br />
emerge. If Iraq is expelled from Kuwait whether peacefully, as we<br />
most earnestly hope, or otherwise through the resolve of<br />
the United Nations to stand up for its principles, an<br />
immensely important precedent will have been set. This<br />
country all countries can feel more secure. Were the<br />
outcome to go the other way, with the world acquiescing in<br />
invasion, occupation and annexation of one country by a<br />
powerful and brutal neighbour, then this country all<br />
countries must feel less secure.<br />
The broader but no less concrete reason for standing up in<br />
this crisis for the principles of the United Nations is that<br />
those are the principles which must govern the new<br />
international order which is emerging. With international<br />
relations in a state of tremendous flux with an imperative<br />
need to mould and shape the outcome the United Nations<br />
principles provide our guideropes for moving forward, the<br />
sure footing for the steps we take.<br />
Let me go further. Our guideropes are not just the<br />
political principles enshrined in the United Nations<br />
Charter. They are also the principles of fair and open<br />
international trade which form the foundational objectives<br />
of the GATT. They are the principles of economic<br />
development and sound, market oriented economic management<br />
which govern the World Bank and the IMF. They are the<br />
principles of a better quality of life in so many fields<br />
which provide the fundamental rationale for the United<br />
Nations Specialised Agencies.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen,<br />
We will face in the 1990s both an immense opportunity and an<br />
immense challenge to have those principles implemented in<br />
practice. The opportunity arises because the many<br />
beneficial changes in the world in the past couple of years<br />
justifiably give us heart. The challenge arises because<br />
very significant problems in the world remain to remind us<br />
how difficult the task will be.<br />
Despite the difficulties and dangers in the new world which<br />
is emerging, and to which I shall refer in a moment, none of<br />
us in our right minds would want to go back to the old one.<br />
The journey the world is now making is not only one we<br />
cannot avoid; it is one we should never want to avoid.<br />
The transformation of East-West relations would be reason<br />
enough not to go back. </p>
<p>It is now more than twelve months since we shared that<br />
euphoric sense of satisfaction when the Berlin Wall came<br />
tumbling down. In seeing those photographs and hearing<br />
those news reports of the triumphant crowds of Germans<br />
surging around and over the wall, many of them singlehandedly<br />
starting to dismantle it with their own hammers and<br />
picks in seeing those images of the tearful reunions of<br />
East and West we became direct witnesses of history in the<br />
most dramatic and moving way.<br />
That single event encapsulates the whole drama of Eastern<br />
Europe the popular demands for freedom and justice that<br />
swept away the old regimes that had for decades oppressed<br />
not just the people of East Germany but also the people of<br />
Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland and Romania.<br />
But this has not just been of immense humanitarian<br />
importance for: the people of those nations. It has been of<br />
fundamental geopolitical importance. The strategic fault<br />
line in the Central European theatre has been bridged with<br />
the reunificaltion of the two Germanies. And in Paris last<br />
month leaders representing most of Europe met under the<br />
auspices of the CSCE to sign what amounted to a formal end<br />
to the Cold Weir.<br />
The two superpowers for so long deeply antagonistic, armed<br />
to the teeth, capable of global nuclear annihilation, and<br />
engaged in competition and rivalry for the highest stakes on<br />
a global chessboard have utterly transformed their<br />
relationship. That the spectre of nuclear holocaust has<br />
thus faded and that superpower tensions are no longer<br />
engaged in virtually every regional trouble spot provide<br />
ample reason for the rest of the world to applaud.<br />
For us in Australia these events are important not just for<br />
their effects far away in Europe they will increasingly<br />
alter the strategic picture in the Asia-Pacific region. And<br />
they occur against the background of profound and beneficial<br />
change already underway.<br />
We no longer live in a region characterised by underdevelopment,<br />
instability and conflict, but overwhelmingly by<br />
economic dynamism and political stability. The attitude of<br />
Australians towards our region, twenty years ago<br />
characterised by uncertainty, apprehension and even fear,<br />
has changed fundamentally. Many Australians would once have<br />
wished to keep the region at arms length. But today our<br />
declared policy of enmeshment with the region is accepted<br />
within the community.<br />
But, my friends, despite all the initial euphoria about the<br />
end of the Cold War, despite all the confident talk of the<br />
Pacific Century, despite all the revitalisation of the UN,<br />
we still face questions that are deeply troubling. They are<br />
questions, in -their way, as profound and as challenging as<br />
the ones that preceded them. Indeed some of the new<br />
problems though not all have their seeds in the very<br />
accomplishments to which I have already referred. </p>
<p>The disintegration of the Soviet economy, conceivably even<br />
of the Soviet Union itself, places a very large question<br />
mark over the direction of future events. And the ousted<br />
Eastern European regimes have bequeathed to their democratic<br />
successors huge problems of economic management and social<br />
and political adjustment.<br />
Developments in our own region have not been universally<br />
benign. To take only one example, China's progress towards<br />
modernisation and liberalisation came to a jarring halt in<br />
Tienanmen Square. And five of the seven avowedly communist<br />
countries left in the world are in our region.<br />
Again, who can take as read an optimistic prognosis for the<br />
world economy in circumstances of economic downturn in a<br />
number of key countries? Who can be optimistic about the<br />
economic structure itself given the crisis in the Uruguay<br />
Round of trade negotiations? At worst but far from<br />
fancifully we must fear the possibility of a global slide<br />
into trading blocs with all the political as well as<br />
economic tension which that implies; a new autarky of which<br />
I have consistently warned.<br />
And let me say here that the fact that blame for this crisis<br />
lies directly with the European Community could put the<br />
single European market planned for 1992 into a totally new<br />
light. The process of European economic integration has been one of<br />
the great and beneficial acts of statesmanship of our<br />
century. I do not say this lightly. I mean that it has<br />
been instrumental in breaking a pattern of conflict between<br />
the nations of Western Europe which has lasted literally for<br />
centuries. It has been integral to West European<br />
prosperity. So I have no negative views about the European<br />
Community as such; on the contrary.<br />
But if European leaders were unable to show the political<br />
courage to withstand their farm lobbies; if they were<br />
unable to do this even though the interests of their<br />
consumers and of their industries would so obviously be<br />
enhanced by trade liberalisation; if they were unable to do<br />
this where the insanity of protectionism was so forcefully<br />
and logically argued by the international community, what<br />
conclusion is the rest of the world meant to draw? If<br />
Europe will sacrifice GATT to protect agriculture, how can<br />
we fail to fear that Europe ' 92 will be Fortress ' 92 a<br />
self-seeking and powerful trade bloc where it could and<br />
should be an outward-looking and constructive world leader. </p>
<p>As well as these new problems, profound global problems of<br />
long-standing remain. The problem of economic<br />
under-development in much of the Third World is still with<br />
us. We still have the tragedy of hunger in Africa, a<br />
continent which has the capacity, with appropriate economic<br />
policies, to be an exporter of food. Population pressures<br />
increase. Global environmental degradation threatens<br />
humankind in ways which are ultimately as significant as,<br />
albeit more gradual and insidious than, the nuclear threat.<br />
And last, of course, the crisis in the Gulf brings home to<br />
us that the new world order will not necessarily be a<br />
peaceful and safe world order.<br />
Ladies and genrtlemen,<br />
We must not, -therefore, be naively optimistic about future<br />
international relations. My belief is rather that while the<br />
challenges in a new, fluid, multipolar world are different,<br />
they are no lesser challenges for our foreign policy than<br />
those of managing the static certainties of the old bipolar<br />
world order.<br />
Now I do not wish to press this argument to the point of<br />
saying that the decades of stability -albeit stability<br />
founded to some extent on mutual fear -since the Second<br />
World War will give way to fragmentation of the world order,<br />
to political and economic chaos. A new order of some sort<br />
will emerge. But we should worry about what the nature of<br />
that new order will be. That it will be good for our<br />
interests and good for the world is not pre-ordained we<br />
must act to make it so.<br />
I put it to you that the challenge of 1990 is analogous to<br />
the challenge of 1945. Just as the generation of 1945<br />
restructured the world after the devastation of war, so we<br />
are faced today with the challenge of building a new<br />
architecture in the aftermath of the Cold War.<br />
The challenge this time is to ensure that peace will be<br />
guaranteed not through a balance of power between East and<br />
West but through international co-operation the<br />
application of enlightened self interest in an<br />
interconnected world.<br />
The challenge this'time is to make sure that the eloquent<br />
principles of the United Nations concerning respect for<br />
sovereignty and peaceful dispute settlement are enshrined<br />
not just in the Charter but in the real world by giving them<br />
concrete backing.<br />
The challenge this time is not to build new global<br />
institutions for peace but to make a concentrated effort to<br />
resolve the key regional conflicts. </p>
<p>The challenge this time is to ensure that vertical and<br />
horizontal escalation in weapons of mass destruction gives<br />
way to the most rapid possible de-escalation consistent with<br />
stability.<br />
The challenge this time is to ensure that peace is founded<br />
on democratisation, political and social liberalisation and<br />
a shift to the efficiencies of the market system in the<br />
Soviet Union, Eastern Europe and even, in time, China once<br />
again and throughout the world.<br />
The challenge this time is to understand that it is not only<br />
pointless, but massively hypocritical, to insist upon market<br />
economics in the former command economies and the Third<br />
World if we do not heed exactly the same injunction in the<br />
international trading system.<br />
And the challenge this time is to achieve a higher<br />
collective global intelligence among nations in dealing with<br />
new agenda problems such as the environment.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen,<br />
The key to translating this list of challenges into policies<br />
for tackling them is to recognise the assets which we can<br />
bring to bear.<br />
The first, I suggest, is the international institutions<br />
bequeathed to us at the end of the Second World War. The<br />
United Nations, the Specialised Agencies and the<br />
international institutions of Bretton Woods represent, at<br />
their heart, the finest and most wise aspirations of those<br />
who sought, when peace came in 1945, to rebuild a world<br />
without war. Far from being redundant, they are now more<br />
essential than ever as we try to structure a new and better<br />
international environment.<br />
But we cannot take these assets for granted we need to<br />
make them work.<br />
This is why more is involved in Security Council Resolution<br />
678 than an effort to resolve today's crisis in the Persian<br />
Gulf. It is exactly because we are on the edge of a new era<br />
that the precedent of resolute, collective response to naked<br />
aggression must be established.<br />
It is why more is involved in the present crisis in the<br />
trade negotiations than whether or not the Uruguay Round<br />
fails or succeeds. It is exactly because we are on the edge<br />
of a new era, in which prosperity will depend critically on<br />
support for the GATT and its principles, that failure now<br />
would constitute such a tremendous setback. It is not that<br />
we are at some blockage along a road; we are at a crossroad,<br />
and which way we turn will carry profound implications for<br />
better or worse for the whole international economic system<br />
of the future. </p>
<p>The second asset which I suggest we have is the habit of<br />
co-operation and the common values and objectives of the<br />
West. A grouping of nations formerly preoccupied with military<br />
security now has the need to re-think its collective<br />
priorities: to show that its members shared not just a<br />
common fear of the Soviet bloc, but a positive set of<br />
ideals. And to show that the West is not prepared just to<br />
fight to preserve those values; it is prepared to work to<br />
propagate them.<br />
That would serve Australia's interests. It is in our<br />
interest that the democratic system should expand throughout<br />
the world the track record shows that democracies do not<br />
wage war on one another. It is in our interest as well as<br />
in line with our most deep-seated convictions that<br />
concepts of individual liberty and human rights should take<br />
hold in places where they have long been denied. And it is<br />
in our interests as well as those of people who yearn for a<br />
better life in many parts of the world, that market economic<br />
systems should be adopted.<br />
These are pre-eminently the values of the West and should, I<br />
propose, unite the Western community in the new era, as the<br />
fear of military threat fades. I would like, in short, to<br />
see the collective sense of purpose which was earlier<br />
directed to military security now be directed as well to the<br />
challenges which I listed earlier.<br />
It is pre-eminently the West which can assist change in the<br />
Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. It is pre-eminently the<br />
West which should show leadership on international trade<br />
because the free market is a Western invention. It is the<br />
West which can lead in giving effect to United Nations'<br />
principles either through the United Nations itself or<br />
outside it because these are essentially Western<br />
principles. For example, the West ought to be able to make a greater<br />
impact collectively than it has in the past in the search<br />
for peace between Israel and its neighbours and in<br />
facilitating the transition to a post-apartheid regime in<br />
South Africa.<br />
If this asset is to be effective, the role played in the<br />
coming years by the three key components of the Western<br />
community the United States, the European Community and<br />
Japan will be of critical importance.<br />
I do not say that United States foreign policy has always<br />
been perfect but, on the whole, from the far-sighted and<br />
enlightened example of United States policies in the<br />
immediate post-war period up until the Persian Gulf today,<br />
the international community owes much to America's<br />
contribution. </p>
<p>We do not want that contribution to wane; but equally the<br />
task of shaping a new world order cannot be left solely to<br />
the United States. And because of the relative shift of<br />
economic power, the scope for others to bear more of the<br />
burden and the responsibility is clearly with Western Europe<br />
and Japan.<br />
This was the wider framework in which, on my recent visit to<br />
Japan, I called for that country a country now committed<br />
to democracy, the rule of law, market economics not to<br />
hold back but to take on a more constructive international<br />
role more commensurate with its economic power. And this is<br />
the wider framework in which I call upon the countries of<br />
the European Community to avoid every temptation of inwardlooking<br />
complacency and narrow short term self-interest and<br />
to stand for something in the world as the United States,<br />
notwithstanding its imperfections, has so clearly done.<br />
If the West Europeans would put into the quest for a better<br />
global world order only one tenth of the extraordinary<br />
vision and boldness they put into the development of their<br />
own Community the cause would be greatly advanced. If the<br />
Japanese would put into the global effort only one tenth of<br />
the amazing determination and innovation they put into their<br />
own economic reconstruction our confidence in the outcome<br />
would grow.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen,<br />
A third asset which we have in facing the new challenges and<br />
realising the new opportunities is regional confidence in<br />
Asia and the Pacific.<br />
Our region can, through its own internal behaviour, help set<br />
an example in the world. If Germany and Japan were the<br />
economic miracles of the 1950s and 1960s, countries<br />
elsewhere in Asia were the economic miracles of the 1970s<br />
and 1980s. And, from the outset, one of the objectives of<br />
APEC has been the encouragement by the region of fair and<br />
open international trade as a key to global prosperity.<br />
But beyond that, our region is capable of demonstrating the<br />
capacity of countries not so long ago torn by conflict,<br />
countries with traditional rivalries, countries at different<br />
stages of development, and countries of great cultural<br />
diversity to cooperate together.<br />
Now in all of these contexts the UN and other<br />
international institutions, the Western community of<br />
nations, the Asia-Pacific region Australia is well placed<br />
to play a role. There are a myriad of specific interests<br />
which Australia must pursue and protect in bilateral<br />
dealings with other countries. And this will always be<br />
vital in our foreign, defence, trade and international<br />
economic policies. But in terms of contributing to the<br />
larger reshaping of international relations it will be by<br />
working with others that we will work most effectively. </p>
<p>This commitment to multilateralism must be a guiding<br />
approach in our foreign policy in the decade ahead. At any<br />
time that would make sense for a middle power. But at a<br />
time of international flux and change unequalled since the<br />
late 40s it is crucial.<br />
And, ladies and gentlemen, this is exactly the course on<br />
which we have embarked.<br />
Our rapid and firm support for the United Nations' stand<br />
against Iraq testifies to our commitment to multilateralism.<br />
Our initiative in establishing the Cairns Group of likeminded<br />
agricultural exporting nations, which has been<br />
critical in having agriculture recognised as the lynch pin<br />
of the Uruguay Round, testifies to that. So does APEC. So<br />
does the effort with others to find a formula for peace in<br />
Cambodia. So does our effort with France to persuade other<br />
Antarctic Treaty countries to seek a permanent ban on mining<br />
in Antarctica. So does our leading role in the campaign to<br />
abolish chemical weapons, to achieve a comprehensive Test<br />
Ban Treaty and, in our own region, to establish the South<br />
Pacific Nuclear Free Zone. So does our work with our<br />
neighbours in the South Pacific Forum on issues ranging from<br />
economic development to environmental protection.<br />
And in the Commonwealth we have led from the front in the<br />
campaign for change in South Africa through strategies now<br />
unambiguously vindicated by events.<br />
Let me make this important observation. In facing a<br />
situation of rapid and unpredictable change in the world,<br />
one major advantage Australia has today not the case a<br />
couple of decades ago is that foreign policy is no longer<br />
perplexed by a national identity crisis.<br />
Some issues then thought interesting, even important, are<br />
seen as utterly anachronistic today: Is Australia part of<br />
the developed country OECD " north" or do we in fact have<br />
more in common with the developing country, commodity<br />
exporting " south"? Are we part of Asia or an outrider of<br />
Europe? Should we get closer to the Non-Aligned or place<br />
ourselves squarely in the Western Alliance? Should we opt<br />
for Forward Defence or Fortress Australia?<br />
We have, as a country, fortunately put these issues behind<br />
us. We know now that such choices were too simple. We are<br />
a developed country but in no way precluded from working<br />
with Third World commodity producers in pursuit of shared<br />
interests. We are part of Asia and the Pacific and this is<br />
certainly the region of our foreign policy priority but<br />
Europe has given us much and we can gain much from it. We<br />
can be unambiguously a part of the West, but still<br />
collaborate with and respect countries whose posture is<br />
non-aligned. We can have a defence policy geared to<br />
protection of the Australian continent but still be involved<br />
with the security of regional neighbours. </p>
<p>As Australians we are now comfortable with a greater<br />
complexity in our view of the world and of ourselves.<br />
Simplistic thinking which led us to terribly costly mistakes<br />
in the past as in Vietnam will no longer plague us now<br />
as we face the challenges of a world in flux. Our analysis<br />
is far more sophisticated, our policy responses far more<br />
mature. My friends,<br />
I am deeply proud of this Government's foreign policy<br />
record. It has been clear-sighted, ahead of the game in a<br />
rapidly changing world, well-informed and creative. But<br />
perhaps most importantly we are, under this Government, no<br />
longer content passively to watch the world go by.<br />
I do not proclaim on behalf of my Government that Australia<br />
can deliver a new world order foreign policy without<br />
realism is futile. But I do proclaim on behalf of my<br />
Government that we shall contribute at this exciting,<br />
challenging and vital time in world affairs for foreign<br />
policy without activism is empty.<br />
And we shall play our part not just because we seek a better<br />
world order for its own sake. We are not embarked on some<br />
merely idealistic crusade. We will as well play our part<br />
for a much more direct reason that only if we succeed in<br />
shaping a better world can we hope to achieve at home the<br />
aspirations we have for the Australian people security, a<br />
better quality of life, above all greater economic<br />
opportunity as we approach the next century. </p>
