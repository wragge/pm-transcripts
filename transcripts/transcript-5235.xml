PRESS OFFICE TRANSCRIPT MONDAY, 14 JANUARY 1980<br />
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS FOLLOWING ADDRESS TO YOUNG LIBERALS<br />
CONVENTION, LA TROBE UNIVERSITY, 14ELBOURNE<br />
Question Prime Minister, one issue which we may be debating later<br />
in the week concerns whether or not it is an appropriate<br />
response in regard to the Russian situation with Afghanistan<br />
that Australia and other nations should boycott the Olympics.<br />
Could I ask your own opinion please?<br />
Prime minister<br />
Well, I can tell you the position of the Government at this<br />
point. We are assessing what a number of other like-minded<br />
countries think about this particular issue. A number of Heads<br />
of Government have either stated that the Games should not take<br />
place or that they should take place somewhere else. I think<br />
we need to look at the issue very seriously indeed. I said<br />
coming in here that we used to try and keep-politics and sport<br />
entirely separate, but then there are many people who told us<br />
that we could not keep politics and sport separate. There<br />
were some countries who ran their sport on the basis of race,<br />
and apartheid was the obvious answer. The critics at the<br />
time were directed to apartheid and they did not want Australia<br />
to participate in sporting events which could give any support<br />
of any kind to that alien and most unpleasant philosophy. A<br />
number of governments have therefore introduced politics into<br />
sport. By the decisions that my Government made in recognition<br />
of the Gleneagles charter.-the Commonwealth document in<br />
relation to apartheid in sport we have recognised that the two<br />
cannot be entirely separated, that there are some elements of<br />
politics and sport, and however much we might regret it, that.<br />
plainly applies to the Olympic* Games-zas much as ' it doe's to<br />
other sporting events, Maybe more so to the Olympic Games.<br />
There is not the slightest doubt that the Soviet Union intends<br />
to make the Olympic Games great internal successv all<br />
nations in the world coming to Moscow, competing, and in the<br />
Russian's view hopefully being defeated by Russian"-Athletes.<br />
Well, recent events have given us all I think some stimulus to<br />
try and make sure that we and many others do better than the<br />
Soviets if the Games do take place.<br />
There have been one or two interesting suggestions. One, that_-<br />
there should be a permanent home for the Games in Greece and<br />
that could well be appropriate and it could well prevent what<br />
might otherwise be a very unfortunate politicisation of the<br />
Olympics. Another suggestion which I believe is worth<br />
consideration and these things of course are all at the moment<br />
in the hands of the various Olympic committees and the Internationall<br />
Olympic Federation and I am well aware that their Chairman<br />
has said something this morning but another suggestion might<br />
well be that the Games should not take place in any one country<br />
but that it should take place in four or five or six countries<br />
at any one time. The reasons for that would be that a larger / 2 </p>
<p>-2<br />
Prime Minister ( continued)<br />
number of countries could participate in mounting the<br />
Games. The cost of mounting the Games is becoming prohibitive.<br />
Lesser numbers-of countries would feel inclined to embark<br />
upon that path and put out the enormous sums that are now<br />
required and indeed demanded for a successful mounting of<br />
the Games as a whole.. That second suggestion is not entirely<br />
novel, because some aspects of the Games are held in separate<br />
places now. It would be an extension if you like, of that<br />
principle. I think it is very important for the Olympic committees, and<br />
for governments, to do what they can to see that the Games<br />
continue into the future free of political interference.<br />
I think either of the suggestions that I have put might well<br />
give a greater opportunity of that occurring than the Games<br />
continuing largely being held in one place, and therefore<br />
capable of being used for political purposes.<br />
But, so far as these Games are concerned, the Australian<br />
Government has not yet made any firm decision. We are consulting<br />
with other countries. Quite plainly, the Games are an<br />
international event. While the Russians mount them they are<br />
not a Russian event, and therefore we look at the Games in a<br />
different light and other aspects of the bilateral<br />
relationship is'strictly between the Russians and ourselves.<br />
So, they are different in that context. It is important I think.<br />
What a number of other countries do, we will have to be assessing<br />
that. I look forward to learning what the views of the<br />
Young Liberals are after you have passed, changed or amended<br />
what various resolutions you have.<br />
Question I congratulate your Government on introducing training and<br />
education schemes for young unemployed people, but do you maintain<br />
that in spDite of technological advances in the future<br />
economic growth will provide jobs for all. If-not,-mn other<br />
words, if there will be a permanent pool of unemployed what is<br />
your Government doing to come to grips with providing their<br />
social needs, their social role, their-needs, and. determining....,-<br />
what place they will play in the future of Australia?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
The best thing we can do to help people who are unemployed<br />
is to re-establish the sound basis of economic growth taking<br />
Australia forward into the future, because whatever the lev -elof<br />
unemployment might be, with a substantial level of economic<br />
growth it will plainly be much less than it would be without<br />
that growth. I think everyone could accept that. If we can<br />
take much as agreed, I think we then have to recognise that<br />
we are going to go through a much more difficult environment<br />
than we have over the last 20 or 30 years. A number of jobs<br />
have disappeared. Not so much because of modern technological<br />
changes, but because of dramatic changes. in wage structures<br />
which have forced people to do things differently if they are<br />
to be done at all. When you have average wages, or award wages, </p>
<p>-3<br />
Prime Minister ( continued)<br />
going up 38 per cent in one year alone and that is what<br />
happened in the year March to 1975 arnd all of that had to<br />
work its way through industry. It hit industry 9 months before<br />
we came into office. It had to work its way through before<br />
you could get back to a competitive Australian industry which we<br />
are now establishing again. But the impact of wage increases<br />
of that kind does lead to some permanent changes which is<br />
very difficult to overcome, especially the very great increase<br />
of wages of young, unskilled people where a lot of the jobs<br />
that might have been available just now are not there, or<br />
machines do the work instead. So it is not just a question of<br />
technological change. You have got to look at the other changes<br />
within society, within our own economy, to see how they have<br />
been affecting things.<br />
Modern technology I think, I am certain, has got to be embraced<br />
as a challenge and as an opportunity, not looked at in any<br />
sense with defeatism or despair, because technology enables you<br />
to produce things more cheaply and better, and if you do that<br />
you are going to sell more. You will employ more than you<br />
otherwise would. If you do not use that technology, your<br />
competitors in some other countries certainly will. And then<br />
we in our industries will be left with old technology;<br />
inefficient, high-cost, not able to compete overseas, not able<br />
to compete in Australia except under higher and higher tariffs<br />
and protectionisms which carry their own problems with it.<br />
So embracing modern technology, and using it to Australia's<br />
advantage, is the only sensible course that we have available<br />
to us.<br />
I think that in this kind of environment, taking the domestic<br />
changes and other changes into account, we are going to<br />
more difficult employment situation than we have had for a<br />
long while. But the policies we have set in train will<br />
minimise those difficulties.-In addition, I believe. that.. ther:<br />
has be-readier access to training throughout life, partly*<br />
because of the changes of technology. It is not good enough<br />
to have somebody trained at.. the age-of 17 or, 18 or 19,. r<br />
early 20' s and then that training is the be all and ' the end of*<br />
it for the rest of life. If technology makes that.-particular<br />
skill unnecessary or outdated, the person should have an<br />
opportunity for later changing and moving into the additional<br />
technology. A number of firms do do this with their own<br />
employees, and I think it is essential for the smooth and quiet<br />
and happy introduction of new technology. So we cannot get<br />
over the fact that we are living in a world of greater change;-<br />
greater need for education and training opportunities. The<br />
trade unions could help us greatly if they would accept more<br />
willingly adult training and adult apprenticeship, if they<br />
would accept re-training. That is one of the great<br />
conservatisms in the Australian environment, one of the great<br />
reactionary forces which does place difficulties in the way of<br />
people who time might otherwise pass by. So we have to work on<br />
a broad front. There are problems, but ouir policies are<br />
designed to minimise those problems. / 4 </p>
<p>-4<br />
Question Mr. Fraser, it seems fairly clear that there has been a good<br />
deal of public unease about the Government's health insurance<br />
policies and the relatively frequent changes that there have<br />
been in them from time to time. Is it likely that we will<br />
see any more substantial changes in the near future, during<br />
this election year, or we acknowledge the presence of the<br />
minister for Health as well are we likely to see the scheme<br />
settle down in its present form.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I would not like to pre-empt anything that the Minister for<br />
Health might propose or be wanting to propose -which might well<br />
be just a continuation of what is. That is always one of the<br />
options. I think we need to understand the background of<br />
the problems that we confronted in the health arena. The fact<br />
that there has been more than one set of changes we have not liked,<br />
but it only I think emphasises the extent of the problem.<br />
Many countries around the world have lost control of their<br />
health expenditure. They really have. We were doing that in<br />
the Hayden time under Medibank. One particular aspect of health<br />
expenditure went up. I think it was hospital costs to the<br />
Commonwealth, Micheal, went up 113 per cent in one year-under<br />
Mr. Hayden. That is the so-called architect of the only<br />
economic responsibility that Labor ever had. It gives a measure<br />
of what they regard as economic responsibilty. Quite plainly,<br />
the changes that we have introduced have been introduced against<br />
two elements, two things we wanted to preserve and to establish:<br />
adequate health care for Australians, and especially for<br />
disadvantaged Australians, for pensioners, and for people in<br />
special need but at'a cost that the community can entertain,<br />
at a cost that the community can stand. It is easy to say everyone<br />
will -get free health care. if--you-are. not going to~ care<br />
how much people have to pay out of their Pockets to do it<br />
through taxation and all the rest. But afL" ter what Labor did, to<br />
be able to continue with reasonable, proper health carg, but . to.<br />
do within a budgetary position which is overall responsibly<br />
managed, is obviously difficult. That is the challenge. That is<br />
why there has been more than" one change, and I make , no apology<br />
for that, because it has been necessary in the meeting ofthose'<br />
twin objectives. If Micheal wants to recommend further changes<br />
of course the Government will be looking at those closely in<br />
the pursuit of those further objectives.<br />
I must say that in some areas, especially in New South Wales,<br />
we could be much better helped and the taxpayer could be much<br />
better helped if the Health Minister did not want to play.<br />
politics with hospital finances to quite the extent that he<br />
has over the past 12 months. With a 60 per cent occupancy of<br />
beds, with a very large part of the total health costs in the<br />
hospital area, quite plainly we have got to make sure that<br />
enough beds are available for everyone, but you do not want a<br />
whole lot of beds, fully staffed and operational, but nobody<br />
to be in them. The rationalisation of hospital facilities, in<br />
the medium term, is going to be quite essential to get the<br />
total cost of health care under control. I agree it is a<br />
difficult area. I agree that there has been an element of </p>
<p>Prime Minister ( continued)<br />
concern, but I also believe that people understand the<br />
basic objectives that we have been pursuing.<br />
Question Mr. Prime Minister, this morning, recently this morning,<br />
we re-endorsed one of the Liberal Party's 1955 election policies<br />
and that was to end the 48-hour blackout prior to an election<br />
on radio and television, including comment. Could you give<br />
a commitment to end that for the 1980 Federal election?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
By that particular Wednesday I think the general public<br />
havebeen so bombarded with political propoganda that there are<br />
quite a large number of people out in the community who are<br />
able to get back to their normal programs with relief, and not have me<br />
or Bill Hayden coming out, or Micheal MacKellar or somebody<br />
else coming out with an advertisement, and giving them a little<br />
relief in which they can make up their own minds quietly,<br />
without people who think they know so much better than all the<br />
rest of us telling them what to do from that box.<br />
