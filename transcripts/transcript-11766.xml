Subjects: Lleyton Hewitt's magnificent US Open victory. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST:<br />
Prime Minister, what did you think of the win? </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:<br />
It is absolutely fantastic. I mean this is a great achievement. I mean it was against the odds to beat Sampras so convincingly at Flushing Meadow. It's just great. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST:<br />
Do you think he's a good ambassador? </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I think he's a great tenacious tennis player. We first saw him play wonderfully in the hundredth Davis Cup tie in Boston two years ago in a hundred and one degrees -o years ago in a hundred and one degrees - in the old language -  and he was fantastic. And good on you Lleyton, you've done us proud. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST:<br />
And what did you think of the game? </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:<br />
The game?  Well I've seen the last game - you know, juggling  diplomacy and sport is always challenging.  Thank you. </p>
