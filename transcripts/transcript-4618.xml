FOR PRESS 7 FEBRUARY 1978<br />
URBAN PUBLIC TRANSPORT<br />
The Prime Minister, Mr Fraser, gave details today of new Government<br />
initiatives in the urban public transport area. The new initiative,<br />
which provides for a non-repayable grant to the States of<br />
million a year over the next five ye ars will commence from<br />
1 July 1978.<br />
The Prime Minister said that he had written to all State Premiers<br />
informing them that the Commonwealth assistance programme will<br />
provide grants equal to two-thirds of the approved cost of projects.<br />
Cities-eligible for assistance under the new scheme are -those with<br />
a population of no less than 40,000.<br />
Legislation will be enacted during the Autumn Sittings to give<br />
effect to new arrangements which substantially reduce Commonwealth<br />
involveme ' nt in the implementation phase of the programme-and..<br />
which will pro * vide greater flexibility to the States inith-e ordering<br />
of expenditure. The legislation will contain provisions allocating<br />
an annual minimum entitlement to each State, which in total will be<br />
million a year. Allocations to States from the balance of<br />
million will be determined annually in accordance with<br />
needs as reflected in States? submissions.<br />
The Prime Minister added that the new programme initiative by the<br />
Commonwealth would make a substantial contribution to the<br />
upgrading of urban public transport in Australia.<br />
The Commonwealth Minister for Transport will shortly be seeking<br />
from State Transport Ministers initial programme submissions<br />
within the guidelines of the new scheme. </p>
