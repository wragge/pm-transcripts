    <content><![CDATA[<p>
JOUWIALISTY Mr Hawke, would you prefer to go into the<br />
election without Mtr Dowding an the Premier?<br />
PK: I'd prefer to go into the election with the leader who<br />
is the choice Of the Parliamentary Party in this State.<br />
IVeG mad. it clear that I was asked a question about this<br />
that Night be and obviously must be that I have<br />
confidence in and give support to the leader of the Party in<br />
each State. Now clearly at this time there are some<br />
question about that leadership. so one suspends ones<br />
Position in those circumstances. I understand the<br />
Parliaety Party will be meeting on rnday, that Ur<br />
Dowding will be calling a meeting. But it's not for me to<br />
interVene in this matter. I haven't to this point AMd I<br />
won't. ? 44s is a matter for determination by the Party.<br />
When it MOMe its decision then I will give the Partys<br />
decision my support.<br />
JOUALST: I&amp; Hawke how much do you know about Carmen<br />
Lawrence and what's your assessment of her?<br />
PK: Wll I had the opportunity of helping her in her<br />
campaign oni a couple of occasions. F&amp; ro what I know of<br />
Carmen 10a very favourably impressed. she strikes me an<br />
being a no-nonsense person, knows what she'. about, says<br />
what she thinks and I have a very high opinion of her.<br />
10O3LIST: Kr Hawke, would you agree that the present<br />
position in Western, Australia is unhelpful to federal Labor?<br />
PM: Well the most unhelpful position is that there is<br />
uncertainty about the leadership and that's why I believe<br />
that it* a good thing on the part of a party and in term<br />
of Xr Dowding, his response. They sem to be at one ina<br />
saying this matter should be resolved and resolved quickly.<br />
Once it* s resolved that will be a plus for the Party<br />
generally both State and federally. </p>
<p>j mouLBt: If there is a change of leadership Sir, would<br />
that help the federal Labor Party Overcome the stigma Of NA<br />
PK: Wll as I Just indicated it's not for me to intervene<br />
in the decision making processes of the State Parliamentary<br />
Party and-I-need to be careful-in that-anything I may is no<br />
taken an an intervention. Theref ore I simply say carefully<br />
that there is not doubt it's a matter of record that as far<br />
am the West Australian scene is concerned, I think certainly<br />
the State Party seema to be suffering to some extent from<br />
the develownts in regard to Va Inac. Yours is a<br />
hypothetical questioni if there were to be a chnein<br />
leadership would that mean some change in percepti: o I<br />
guess perhaps it would. I can't really develop that point<br />
and I don't intend to because I adhere to my position that<br />
this matter is a matter f or the State Pai1 iametary Party.<br />
JOURNALIST: But there has been suggestions that federal<br />
Vest Australian Labor politicians were involved in moves<br />
against Xr Dowding.<br />
P112 Well there may have been but I've been in politics that<br />
long to know that long that I hear allegations about all<br />
sorts of things on both sides of politics and an far as I<br />
understand thin in an essentially internally generated State<br />
matter. 7OUsnALIST: Ufr Hawke, from what you know has the fallout<br />
from. W6nc. had anything to do with the latest<br />
PH1: I would've thought that developments in regard to VA<br />
I= c. have obviously had something to do with it. But I<br />
haven't been involved and I don't intend to be involved in<br />
thes internal processes. Now what things have moved and<br />
what the has been in the minds of memers of the State<br />
Parliamentary Party, I simply don't know and I don't intend<br />
to intervene or attempt -to find out.<br />
S JOUNAST: Prime Minister, what about what's in the minds<br />
of the voters, how concerned are you about in term of<br />
Thomastown that people can distinguish between State and<br />
federal issues?..<br />
111Å Yes I've got no doubt they will because any suggest ion<br />
to the contrary really involves a very considerable insult<br />
to the intelligence of the electorate here.* It means that<br />
those who would argue that the West Australian electorate<br />
would seek to punish, if you likel1 the State Governrment-by<br />
an adverse vote against us, means that they would put at<br />
risk thei' interests as an electorate in havin a decent<br />
health scheme, for instance, a decent educationm eyet the<br />
future of Australia and for each individual elector in<br />
Western Australia, his or her future in terms of having a </p>
<p>3.<br />
decent health schem depends upon whether they vote for the<br />
Hawke Governen or for this tattered Opposition which<br />
cannot produce a health policy. A voe, in the federal<br />
election determines whether we're going to have a<br />
continuation of the massive social engineering that's taken<br />
plwAe wnder my Goenet in the area of education. JUSt<br />
z emeber the facts there that our opponents who awe deep in<br />
rhetoric about concern for families, but horribly short on<br />
action had 7 years before we came to office to do something<br />
about education for the kids of Australian-families. And in<br />
the 7 year. before we cam to office they lifted the<br />
retention rate by 2 miserable points trom 340 to 36t.* So<br />
that in Australia you had a pattern imposed upon this<br />
country in educational terms that if your kids cam from the<br />
privileged suburbs,. the wealthy suburbs, if you came from<br />
Dalkeith your kids vent on into education. If you cam from<br />
oae of the poorer suburbs, it's a good-chance of not. Only<br />
one in three vent on. Now they lifted it by We have<br />
massively changed one of the most important pieces of social<br />
engineering in this country's history, it's nov 62% of kids<br />
S staying on in the education system. It you want to look at<br />
the question of what' 4s important for families, in the end<br />
there's nothing moe important than ensuring that kids<br />
indepnde! ty of their income level of their pants,, are<br />
gjoing to have a chance of staying on in school. Now we've<br />
lifted it an I say frou 36 to 62 and our policies will<br />
continue that. Their's won't. That's education. In<br />
health, we came to office 2 million uncoverzed by insurance<br />
medical health insurn. Nov we have in this country a<br />
system of Mdicare which in characterised by two features u<br />
it is universal and it is fair. Now these people had 7<br />
Years in Opposition and on the eve of the election they<br />
stand up and confess we have not got a health policy. So<br />
0hese are the issues. You see this is essential to yoaw<br />
question. It's these issues which are going to determine<br />
the welfare of Western Australian voters and their kids and<br />
I think it' an ' Insult to the intelligence of West<br />
Auastralian electors to say that-bacause-they may -be<br />
disappointed with some aspects of the West Australian State<br />
Labor ovement they are cping to deliberately prejudice<br />
themselves and their kids in terms of education, health,<br />
wages policy, the economy, by voting for Peacock and his<br />
crow as a Protest against Western Australia That's an<br />
Insult to their intelligence. I don't believe it will<br />
happen. JOLUNALST: Ur Hawke, if re-elected will you serve a full<br />
UWEm? PM: Ye. I've made that clear and despite -let me be<br />
quite clear about this the gratuitous and incorrect<br />
observation of senator Button, I wi1l serve a full term.<br />
JOUNAIST: tso there'I. no secret agenda </p>
<p>PK: There is not, as I said. It was a gratuitous and<br />
erroneous observation by senator Button.<br />
JOUUMAIST: Have you told him that?<br />
P31: I have observations to his in the quietness Of the<br />
Cabinet room yesterday.<br />
JOURNALXST: Mr Hawke, what are your feelings for the<br />
entrepreneurs of Australia, particularly in Western<br />
Australia who appear to be collapsing left, right and<br />
centr?<br />
13: Well now let's get it into perspective. I mean<br />
got in this country record profits and record investment.<br />
Investment in this country in absolute term and as a<br />
proportion of gross domestic product is higher than it,'<br />
every been.* That is not an accident. * it is the outcome of<br />
the deliberate policies of economic maaeet of my<br />
Government.-what we have done and this goes to the core<br />
Of the issues of the West Australian electorate as well an<br />
the whole Australian electorate ve'll1 have to face -what ve<br />
have done is this, let me quickly encapsulate it because it<br />
goes again to the heart of your question, when we came to<br />
office, simple fact, we inherited the worst recession in<br />
years, that was after 7 years of conservative Government.<br />
They have achieved what had never been achieved before in<br />
the history of this country, simultaneous double digit<br />
unemployment and double digit inflation and the central<br />
factor in that historic achievement by the conservatives of<br />
the worst recession in 50 years, the central feature in that<br />
was their inability to control wages. They had no wages<br />
Policy, We had a wages explosion and everything f lowed from<br />
that. The economy collapsed, businesses collapsed left,<br />
right and Centre into the position of the worst recession in<br />
Years. Now we came to office and we said we are going to<br />
chagethat and what vs have done is. by having the accord<br />
and a deliberate wages policy which Mas recognised this<br />
simple fact, that the income of workers is not solely<br />
derived from wages.* We said there are other ways of<br />
managing the remuneration and the income of families in this<br />
country than simply trying to do it by exces. sive money wage<br />
increases. So look at the I just give you the last two<br />
Year and the prospect for this year which goes to this<br />
point. It is the came that earnings have increased at a'<br />
slightly lesser rate than the CPX. So if you look at it in<br />
terms of real wages there-' s been a slight decline in 1987/ 88<br />
-Cl! 1 up by 7.3 and earnings up by 6.6 and for the last<br />
financial Year 1988/ 89 the CPI 7.4 and earnings by 7.0. But<br />
at the same time real household disposable income in each of<br />
these two years vent up, the first year by 3.* 60 and the<br />
second year by Now what that represented was the<br />
dynamics of economic policy and wages policy. in other </p>

profits, record investment. Nov that's the overall pattern<br />
of sccrmiC management and achievement under this Government<br />
and the contrast with our opponents. Now in those<br />

steel industry. We said no, ve're not going to allow that<br />
to happen. And right today you-Ire getting the whole thing<br />
revisited because what mwP seem in the Opposition'sa proposal<br />
is the possibility of the re-emergence of that precise<br />
situation of the beginning of the 80a which brought about<br />
the collapse of the Australian economy in general and the<br />
particular consideration by DMP as to whether they'd close<br />
down the steel industry. Is it little wonder that SMsays<br />
to the coalition, well it may be that you can't learn from<br />
Your mistakes and want to re-visit on Australia the disaster<br />
of your previous term in office, but we, BHP, understand and<br />
we don' t want a bar of it -nor shoul1d fthe.<br />
JOMUINLST: Mr Hawke, in the past you been regarded as<br />
an admirer of Brian Burke would you support him rett~ ning<br />
to politics sometime in the future?<br />
FE: That's an entirely hypothetical question. I'm not<br />
going to Intervene into that. He is Going an excellent job<br />
now as Ambassador for Australia in Ireland and to the<br />
Vatican and that's where he is.<br />
JOUIIAIS: ZDo you agree with John Dawkins and Peter Walsh<br />
vho'lve gone on the record saying that his style of politics<br />
is no longer needed in the ALF?<br />
pU: Iove got no coinnt to mke about Brian Durke's style<br />
of politics. I simply say that he is doing an excellent Job<br />
for Australia as Ambassador to Ireland and the Vatican. </p>
<p>J0MUALIS!: Mr Hawke the last Morgan Gallup Poll has<br />
support for Labor in Western Australia as down to 321.<br />
PK: Well, that was not today'. poll but that was a long<br />
time beck. I Smen I would think if you're talking about<br />
polls there are a couple of polls around today that are more<br />
curraent. I think that when people come to cast their vote,<br />
this goes back I don't want to regurgitate the answer I<br />
gave before but I have faith in the intelligOONc of the<br />
people of Western Australia. After all, Ifs one of then.<br />
So I'm not going to knock West Australians, I an West<br />
Australian and I think we're intelligent people. And whly<br />
would West Australians, just ask a simple question -why<br />
would West Australians vote against theseves to reimpme a<br />
wages policy which gave you the worst recession in 50 years,<br />
which is what the Liberals and the country Party want to<br />
revisit on this country. WMy would West Autalians wnt to<br />
visit upon themselves the disastrous 7 years of Conservatism<br />
that preceded us in regard to health policy, where Nedibenk<br />
was abolished and you had 5 successive changes in Nedibank<br />
and its detuto. Why would West Australians want nov to<br />
say we'd give government to Xr Peacock and Nr Shack who<br />
can t produce a health policy, who produce nothing now but<br />
the promise of additional expenditure of something up to<br />
$ 2.6 billion, with a $ 6 billion gap in their economic<br />
credibility. Their Economic Action Plan absolutely<br />
destroed. Why would they want in terms of education to go<br />
back to people who are promising the same in education.<br />
Under the conservatives how many additional places did they<br />
create, as well as just going from 341 to 36% in retention<br />
rates and what we've done there, but look at the tertiary<br />
area -in 7 years how many additional places did they<br />
create? 27,000, 27000 additional places. At the end of<br />
this triennium we're now, there will be between a<br />
140,000 and a 150,000 additional places under myGoenet<br />
So in the vbole area of education, health, budget Policy,<br />
why do you believe your fellow west Australians are going to<br />
say Its going to be so silly but because Vsm a little bit<br />
disappointed with some aspects of the West Australian State<br />
Government I'm going to inflict misery upo= myself and my<br />
children to somehow or another express disapproval of what<br />
night happen in the state. I simply don't believe that the<br />
West Australian electorate would be that silly.<br />
IWO LLIST well you've got 9 seats here, how many do you<br />
expctto hold on to?<br />
PN: Wall I expect to hold then all. Now let Us may On<br />
this, I'm not being cocky or complacent about this election.<br />
it is the case things seem to be running well for us now and<br />
I's pleased about that. But I don't take these things for<br />
granted and I certainly don'It take Western Australia for<br />
granted. I have the responsbility together with mY<br />
colleagues to explain thee things that I ' a explaining to </p>
<p>7.<br />
you there today and 1011 do that, 1' ll be hame and V11l<br />
ae back and lot me just say this I's fascinated to see<br />
Andrew Peacock in the Press today saying that I'm frightened<br />
to face up to the Press. He's talkng about contrived<br />
debate, that I ' s frightened to face upto the press.* I<br />
onsistently have conferences like this. I do it today and<br />
when I come back to Western Austral ia agjain and when I come<br />
back again I'll be doing th~ at. 10amuaXdngmyself available<br />
to you, you can throw any questions you vant to at ne about<br />
my economic policy, wages policy, international policy,. 18m.<br />
here to be questioned by you and through you to people of<br />
MWtern Australia. Anything that you vent to ask me anbout<br />
our policies, I'm here. I ask you to if you just talk<br />
to yawr colleagues over there about the availability of Mr<br />
Peacock to answer questions about wages policy, health<br />
policy. = AT-ST: Xr Hawke, do you seriously expect to hold all 9<br />
seats in VA. Is that just optimism?<br />
PK: Obviously we've got a difficulty in regard to one<br />
S because of the redistribution, that's Allen Blanchard's seat<br />
of Moore. The redistribution certainly vales that<br />
difficultg I acknowledge that. There's a difficulty the" e<br />
not because of inadequacy o In Xr Blmnchard's part, he's been<br />
an excellent representative for the constituency. But since<br />
the last election there has been a redistribution and it<br />
makes that seat difficult. So I put that I'd love to<br />
hold Moore and will be trying hard to do it. But that one<br />
will be difficult. But apart from that I expect that we<br />
will hold the rest. But I repeat and I want the people of<br />
Western Australian to understand I ' m not saying that in a<br />
cocky or c lacent way.* I realise that there have been<br />
som concerns over here.* We'l11 address thea.<br />
JOMULUS?: inaudible I<br />
P3: Wll-I don't regard it as a happy hunting ground. I<br />
feel at hams in western Australia, it is and Ii ' ve always<br />
regarded is as you know, I regard it as my ham State., I<br />
feel at home when I come back here. Mow it is a bit more of<br />
a challenge this time. That's well and good and I'll be<br />
here to face the challenge.<br />
jimngLisTs can we expect to see a bit more of you through<br />
this election campaign?<br />
P3' 10' ll get over as often as I can. I amen there is a lot<br />
of Australia that I've got to go to but I'll be here as<br />
often as I can.<br />
JOUnsaLISTi Nrl Hawks, what's your impression of the job<br />
dONe by Peter Dowding? </p>
<p>4 PM: Look, if there were not a question on now about the<br />
leadership, that may be a fair question, that ay be a fair<br />
question. But it's quite unfair for me to be intruding into<br />
that issue and the question of leadership, you know I've<br />
said that before, it's not for se and I think you would<br />
understand it's not proper for ae to cae over here and<br />
intrude at a timae when the State Parliamentary Labor Party<br />
is to make a decision about the leadership. It's not proper<br />
for as to They've got to make their own mind up about<br />
that. JOURNALST: Prize inister, have you this week discussed<br />
the leadership with Brian Burke?<br />
PM: Have I discussed it with Burke? I wouldn't think it<br />
was proper for ae to say what discussions I've had with<br />
anyone. I can say this with absolute accuracy, that I have<br />
played no pert, I have played no part directly or indirectly<br />
n the event.<br />
JUOUMLIST: Rave you spoken to Mr Burke in the last week?<br />
PM: Well I'm not going to talk about what people have<br />
spoken to me because as I say that directly I believe<br />
that whether Z have converuations or not with anyone within<br />
my Party is a matter for me. I've always taken that view<br />
and I don't intend to change it.<br />
JOMMUNLIST: Kr Peacock said yesterday that WNA Inc. has<br />
blown up in your face.<br />
PM: Well of course as is true of just about everything that<br />
Mr Peacock says, that is wrong. WA Inc. has nothing to do<br />
with me or the federal Goverrment. I can understand Kr<br />
Peacock in his desperation at the present tie making these<br />
wild accusations. I guess we'll get plenty of then.<br />
ends </p>
