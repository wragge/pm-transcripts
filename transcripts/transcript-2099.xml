COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA<br />
SPEECH<br />
The Hon. C. E. BARNES, M. P.<br />
ON<br />
BOUGAINVILLE COPPER DEVELOPMENT<br />
( Ministerial Statement)<br />
[ From the ' Parliamentary Debates', 12 August 1969]<br />
Mr BARNES ( McPherson-Minister for<br />
External Territories)-by leave-Mr<br />
Speaker, this statement is cOncerned with<br />
the recent incidents near Kieta, Bougainville,<br />
in the Territory of Papua and New<br />
Guinea, in connection with the provision of<br />
land for the Bougainville copper project.<br />
On 31st July a lease was issued to Bougain-<br />
Dville Copper Pty Ltd under the Territory<br />
Mining Ordinance over 175 acres of land<br />
at Rorovana. On 1st August, surveyors cornenced<br />
marking the boundary of this land.<br />
-) tview of reports that there might be<br />
~ violence 100 police were sent to the area in<br />
_) three groups. A group of approximately 20<br />
women crowded around police guarding a<br />
concrete survey peg. The police did not use<br />
force and eventually the peg was removed<br />
and carried away by the women. Clearing<br />
and marking of the area continued on 2nd<br />
and 4th August without interference. On 5th<br />
August a bulldozer clearing scrub for the<br />
survey team was confronted by a group of<br />
approximately 65 men and women. There<br />
were approximately 70 police present. The<br />
officer in charge warned the people to disperse<br />
on at least two occasions. He then<br />
ordered a group of 15 police carrying<br />
shields and batons to move in front of the<br />
bulldozer and attempt to push the crowd<br />
away with their shields. There was a general<br />
melee and at this point the officer in charge<br />
decided to attempt to disperse the crowd<br />
with tear gas. The tear gas used is non-<br />
20644/ 69 toxic. It was only partially effective. After<br />
further warnings police were ordered to use<br />
their batons about the legs of the natives<br />
and after a very short time the crowd dispersed.<br />
There were no injuries other than<br />
one man who appeared to have grazed his<br />
leg falling over a log. No-one was injured<br />
by the police. Minimum force was used.<br />
The members of the Papua and New<br />
Guinea constabulary acquitted themselves<br />
with distinction in these incidents, behaving<br />
with the greatest restraint and discipline.<br />
Their actions were at all times fully in<br />
accordance with the fine traditions of this<br />
force. These are the facts of the incidents.<br />
I turn now to the situation behind them.<br />
For many years there has been some<br />
knowledge of the mineral wealth at<br />
Bougainville Island but it was not until 1960<br />
that an Administration geologist reported<br />
the possibility of a major low-grade copper<br />
deposit. Conzinc Riotinto of Australia Ltd<br />
began prospecting the area in 1964. In 1967<br />
after more than 12 months of negotiation an<br />
agreement was signed between the company<br />
and the Administration. This agreement was<br />
tabled in the Commonwealth Parliament. It<br />
was debated in the Territory House of<br />
Assembly and a ratifying Ordinance was<br />
passed by the House. The House consisted<br />
of 54 elected and 10 official members. The<br />
House also amended the Territory mining<br />
legislation so as to provide that 5% of all </p>
<p>royalties for minerals should be paid to the<br />
owners of the land from which the minerals<br />
were taken. This was accepted by the<br />
Government. in June of this year the Territory House<br />
of Assembly ( now consisting of 84 elected<br />
and 10 official members) debated a comprehensive<br />
White Paper on the Bougainville<br />
project and again endorsed it. The motion<br />
passed by the House on -this occasion<br />
described the project as ' a major and<br />
essential development in the economic<br />
future of the Territory'.<br />
In relation to the situation at Rorovana<br />
as well as . at Arawa, the Administrator consulted<br />
the Administrator's Executive<br />
Council, which has a majority of elected<br />
members of the House of Assembly. The<br />
Council gave unanimous support to the<br />
Administrator's proposals for further direct<br />
consultation with the people, to be followed<br />
if unsuccessful by leasing under the Mining<br />
Ordinance . or by compulsory acquisition<br />
under the Lands Ordinance, and endorsed<br />
the employment of police if necessary to<br />
ensure protection of those going about their<br />
lawful business in the area. The Council<br />
also expressed an earnest wish that the<br />
Rorovana and Arawa villagers would sell<br />
their land to the Administration.<br />
The Bougainville copper project offers<br />
gigantic benefits to the Territory as a whole.<br />
These benefits will include jobs for 2,500<br />
New Guineans within the next 5 years, a<br />
township of 10,000 people, a $ 2m training<br />
programme for indigenous people during<br />
the period to 1973, revenue to the Administration<br />
of between $ 200m and $ 300m in<br />
the first 10 years of operation, and export<br />
income in excess of $ 100m per annum.<br />
In addition, the Administration, on behalf<br />
of the people of the Territory, has the<br />
option of a 20% equity interest in the project.<br />
CRA has indicated that it may also<br />
provide opportunities for individual equity<br />
participation by. the people of Bougainville.<br />
The project therefore offers a tremendous<br />
opportunity for the Territory to lift itself up<br />
out of the field of competition of low priced<br />
tropical products in international trade, and<br />
to make a giant stride towards economic<br />
self-reliance.<br />
, In view of its importance to the Territory<br />
and in view of the nature of the problems<br />
involved, the Government and the Administration<br />
approached this whole question with great and careful consideration of the problems<br />
extending over many months. Advice<br />
regarding particular aspects of the attitude<br />
of the local people from expert anthropologists<br />
and psychologists has been carefully<br />
examined and the whole matter has been<br />
the subject of the most careful study.<br />
Certain difficulties were experienced in<br />
1966 and 1967 in the actual area of mining<br />
operations at Panguna, where the open pit<br />
mine, the concentrate plant, the mine town<br />
and a location for stacking waste rock will<br />
be sited. The 10,000 acres of this land<br />
covered by a special -mining lease.<br />
The people of Guava, Moroni and<br />
Dapera who occupy or own land in this<br />
lease, were originally antagonistic to the<br />
project as are the coastal people of Rorovana<br />
and Arawa now. The problems were<br />
handled patiently and sympathetically.<br />
These inland people are now reconciled to<br />
the mining operation. They are receiving<br />
full compensation for loss of housing and<br />
gardens and there will also be annual cash<br />
payments for the loss of use of land and<br />
for royalties. In summary there are about<br />
1,000 men, women and children involved<br />
and when ' the. mine is fully in operation<br />
cash pavments are expected to total approximately<br />
$ 100.000 per year. Not all the compensation<br />
for loss of houses and gardens.<br />
et cetera, has yet been determined by the<br />
mining warden but some fifty people in the<br />
villaee of Moroni have been awarded cash<br />
and kind compensation valued at approx'<br />
mately $ 40,000.<br />
Oiher leases required for roads, disposal<br />
of tailings, sources of aggregate and limestone<br />
, et cetera may total up to 40,000<br />
acres. Much of this area will be swamp. It<br />
is not expected that village dwellings will<br />
be involved.<br />
The incidents on 1st and 5th August that<br />
I have referred to above relate only to requirements<br />
for the port. The company had.<br />
however, proposed that the town be sited on<br />
the coast in an area of some 2,000 acres<br />
south of the site proposed for -the port.<br />
This location would have deprived some<br />
650 villagers of their houses, gardens and<br />
economic crops. To avoid this the Administration<br />
decided to locate the town at Arawa<br />
plantation of 998 acres and to supplement<br />
this area with some 640 acres of adjacent<br />
sparsely planted: village land which contained<br />
no village houses. </p>
<p>The arrangements for land for the port<br />
and for the town that were decided upon<br />
were chosen so as to cause the least disturbance<br />
to the minimum number of native<br />
people. The land is uninhabited. No homes<br />
are lost. No villages are displaced. The<br />
people have other land. Full compensation<br />
will be paid. If need be, however, the<br />
Administration will also make other land<br />
available. In providing land for the port or for the<br />
town associated with the copper project the<br />
Administration is acting first and foremost<br />
in the interests of the Territory. The Territory<br />
gets more out of the copper project<br />
than the company does. The project will<br />
not be on full stream until about 1980.<br />
When that happens, however, the following<br />
points apply:<br />
50% of the taxable income goes to<br />
the Territory Treasury;<br />
royalties are payable to the Territory<br />
Treasury in accordance with the<br />
Mining Ordinance scale;<br />
if the Administration's option on<br />
of the equity is taken up then<br />
one-fifth of the dividends paid or<br />
profits accumulated but not distributed<br />
will accrue to the Territory.<br />
Quite apart from these financial considerations<br />
and the indirect tax benefits<br />
flowing from the huge payroll that will be<br />
financed by the project there ' are the jobs,<br />
training' and development benefits I have<br />
Salready referred to. The people of Bougainville<br />
have known for years that the project<br />
would require substantial areas of land but<br />
until the detailed investigations were completed<br />
it was not possible to specify the<br />
particular areas. In March of this year the<br />
company applied for its special mining lease.<br />
This brought into operation ma; or aspects of<br />
the Agreement, including the obligation by<br />
the Administration to'pr6vide land. For over<br />
3 years the Administration has used all possible<br />
means' to explain to the people of<br />
Bougainville the nature and implications of<br />
the. mining project. The construction of<br />
Radio Kieta was expedited in 1967 to facilitate<br />
communications with the native<br />
people. Since mid-1966 over forty Administration<br />
patrols have been made in the area<br />
affected by the mining project: A primary<br />
objective of these patrols has been to<br />
explain to the people the nature of the project and how it would affect them. In addition,<br />
individual officers have spent in the<br />
aggregate hundreds of days visiting villages<br />
and individual families for this same purpose.<br />
The Administrator himself visited<br />
Bougainville earlier this year and spoke to<br />
the people and talked over Radio Bougainville.<br />
Last month an Assistant Administrator<br />
led a special mission to the Island and<br />
held meetings in the villages most affected.<br />
This mission included indigenous ministerial<br />
members of the House of Assembly and all<br />
three Bougainville members of the House.<br />
Radio and news sheets have been used<br />
extensively and the elected members for<br />
Bougainville have been given every opportunity<br />
and encouragement to inform themselves<br />
and their people of the project and<br />
the consideration it had been given by the<br />
House of Assembly.<br />
As an example of the detailed and painstaking<br />
effort on the part of the Administration<br />
to achieve communication with the<br />
local peoDle I refer to the fact that the<br />
Assistant District Commissioner of the area<br />
visited Rorovana four times in the past 4<br />
months and the peonle of Rorovana themselves<br />
visited the District Headquarters at<br />
Kieta 12 times in the past 5 months for discussions.<br />
There have' also been frequent<br />
discussions with the Councillors of the<br />
Rorovana Council and the Council President.<br />
It appears that the opposition of the<br />
Rorovana people to the sale of their land to<br />
the Administration is not related to'lack<br />
of information nor, indeed, to the amount<br />
of compensation offered to them. Some 175<br />
acres of Rorovana land is required for the<br />
port area. The Rorovana people number<br />
some 450 and they ' have total land of<br />
aporoximately 1,600 acres. The loss of this<br />
175 acres will not seriously affect their<br />
economic livelihood. They have been offered<br />
a good price and alternative productive<br />
land; There has never been anry real indication<br />
that they would sell at any price. On<br />
the other hand, not all the native people ' are<br />
opposed. At the village of Lonsiro only a<br />
few miles from Rorovana, one native landholding<br />
family concluded arrangements with<br />
the Administration un'der which they were<br />
paid $ 5,600 for a 42-year lease of 49 acres<br />
of land.<br />
The ' Administration's cositibn in relation<br />
to negotiations for land for such public<br />
purposes as ports,' town sites, airfields and so </p>
<p>on has to take account of the' need for these<br />
public facilities throughout the Territory.<br />
The proposed port for which the Rorovana<br />
land is required will be for public and not<br />
just for company use. The legal authority<br />
for compulsory acquisition or lease of-land<br />
exists in the Territory as in other countries<br />
to avoid the need for excessive payments<br />
out of the public purse, that is, to serve the<br />
interests of the public as a whole.<br />
Compulsory acquisition is an essential<br />
power in all communities. It is used in Australia<br />
more freely than in the Territory.<br />
Individuals or small groups are not allowed<br />
to hold the whole community up. In the<br />
Territory as here the amount of compensation<br />
is in the last resort subject to law.<br />
The Agreement between the Administration<br />
and CRA which the Commonwealth<br />
Government is backing is modern in its<br />
approach and enlightened in its ideas. There<br />
will be adequate return to the Territory<br />
Government in terms of taxes, royalties<br />
and dividends from the profits of the operation.<br />
There are those who would accept the<br />
merits of the Bougainville Copper Agreement<br />
but who would criticise the way in<br />
which the Government or the Administration<br />
had handled the matter. This is easilv<br />
done. Nevertheless it ignores the tremendous<br />
difficulties of communication and of<br />
comprehension which have confronted the<br />
Administration in this matter. I have explained<br />
the painstaking nature of the Administration<br />
communication activity. There<br />
has been no effort spared. The basic difficulty<br />
has been that people of this area are<br />
living in one world and the problems of<br />
development and the requirements of development<br />
confront them with another<br />
world. In the absence of skill arid patience and<br />
moderation on the part of the Administration,<br />
especially its field officers, we could<br />
easily have had a much worse situation<br />
than that which confronts us. As it is we<br />
cannot expect easy solutions. We must<br />
understand that what -happenedat Rorovana<br />
and what may happen elsewhere reflect<br />
the problems of transition into a<br />
modern world and a modern society. These<br />
cannot be sidestepped by an Administration<br />
that must act in the interests of the Territory<br />
as a whole. The Government, however,<br />
is grateful to the officers of the Administration<br />
for the extent to which their<br />
efforts have so far contained the problem. The Government makes no apology for<br />
the Agreement. It considers that the Agreement<br />
is a spectacular contribution to harnessing<br />
the interests of private capital and<br />
the skills of the large corporation to the<br />
development requirements of the Territory.<br />
Not many developing countries are fortunate<br />
enough to have the prospect of so<br />
large and so remunerative a development<br />
within their boundaries. In this, confidence<br />
plays a major part. The investment of<br />
$ 300m demands confidence. In this case<br />
the investors are showing their confidence Ji<br />
not only in the Commonwealth Government<br />
but in . the people of the Territory<br />
themselves because the mining project looks<br />
ahead to the time when the people will be<br />
running their own affairs. In this respect the<br />
projected investment is an act of imagination<br />
and confidence. There are many who<br />
seek to knock it but it has the backing of<br />
the Territory people through their House<br />
of Assembly. It will survive.<br />
The Government considers the Administration's<br />
actions are fully in accordance<br />
with the law. Action has been taken in<br />
Papua and New Guinea to test the law. The<br />
Government will welcome an authoritative<br />
and definitive judicial interpretation of the<br />
legal position.<br />
Since 1964, the Government has made<br />
available to the Territory by way of grant<br />
in aid sums totalling S400m. The Government<br />
and the House of Assembly have last<br />
year jointly backed a 5-year $ 1,000m development<br />
programme for the Territory.<br />
The Bougainville project offers a unique<br />
opportunity for the Territory to make a<br />
dramatic advance towards these objectives<br />
of development. The attitude of a handful<br />
of people may attract our sympathy, and<br />
we may go . to considerable lengths to resolve<br />
their problems. But in the last resort<br />
we cannot allow them to block this great<br />
prospect and thus throw into doubt the<br />
noli-ies on which the futures of more than<br />
2 million people depend.<br />
In the structure of ignorance, superstition<br />
and prejudice, persuasion and explanations<br />
are not easy but with other expatriate<br />
influences working in the opposite<br />
direction-some not without prestige in<br />
native eyes-difficulties become great. The<br />
present choice before the people of this<br />
Territory is whether to drift in a primitive<br />
and backward situation in close dependency </p>
<p>on the generosity of the Australian taxpayer<br />
to provide a modicum towards health,<br />
education and the preservation of law and<br />
order and burdened by their ancient customs<br />
or whether to advance as a modem<br />
state financed substantially by its own<br />
resources. These resources lie dormant and will continue<br />
that way under traditional attitudes.<br />
Developed they will provide the revenues for the hospitals, the schools, the better<br />
standard of life and most important a<br />
nation not only able to stand on its own<br />
feet economically but able to opt for a<br />
meaningful independence should this be desired.<br />
This progressive transition has been<br />
the way chosen by the people of the Territory;<br />
its achievement needs sympathy and<br />
understanding from us in Australia as well<br />
as our continuing support.<br />
