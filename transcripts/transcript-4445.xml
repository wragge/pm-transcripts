PROME MINISTER<br />
FOR PRESS 18. JULY, 197 7<br />
ADDRESS AT KOQYONG ELECTORATE COMMITTEE BANQUET<br />
It is ' very good to be here tonight and a particular pleasure to<br />
speak at a dinner organised by Andrew Peacock's Electorate<br />
Committee. Andrew is a very effective and hard working Foreign<br />
Minister. He was so heavily engaged in the drawn out final<br />
stages of the negotiations at the Conference on International<br />
Economic Co-operation that at one point he got only one hour's<br />
sleep. But then he has had a very hard act to follow Mr. E. G. Whitlam.<br />
Mr. Whitlan as you will remember said of himself " I have been the<br />
greatest Foreign Minister that we have had for a generation."<br />
Mr. Whitlam was in some respects the Mohammed Ali of Australian<br />
politics. He knocked out the ALP. He left the Australian economy<br />
reeling, and he gave the Australian political system a battering.<br />
He recently retained his leadership of the ALP on points<br />
two points. When someone asked him whether he was a spent<br />
force, he answered modestly " I am one of the driving forces<br />
of the party as I have been for some years and I suppose I shall<br />
continue". Mr. Whitlam is certainly trying to make a comeback<br />
at the Perth ALP Conference, he made an astonishing speech<br />
promising that he would henceforth be economically responsible.<br />
Mr. Hayden said that the speech must have been written on the<br />
road to Damascus. It got wide press coverage, but when an<br />
important ALP delegate was asked what he thought of Mr. Whitlam' s<br />
new found responsibility he shrugged and said " I don't bother to<br />
listen to him any more". But perhaps Mr. Whitlam will lead the<br />
ALP a little longer.<br />
One of the chief contenders, Mr. Hawke, goes around making such<br />
statements as " My heart says no, but my head says yes," and<br />
refuses to throw his two hats into the leadership ring unless<br />
he is guaranteed victory. What a vote of confidence in Mr.<br />
Whitlam that is.<br />
The Government is currently considering one of the most important<br />
and far reaching problems which any Government has had to face.<br />
Whether to permit the mining and export of uranium, and, if so,<br />
on what terms. This is not a simple yes or no issue. There are<br />
a number of inter-related issues, all of which require the most<br />
careful consideration. one thing is clear a large number of<br />
countries have reached the conclusion that to satisfy their / energy<br />
F77/ 153 </p>
<p>2-<br />
energy requirements over the next two decades, they must<br />
increasingly rely on the use and development of nuclear energy.<br />
Already many European countries are heavily dependent on nuclear<br />
energy. They have indicated that their reliance on nuclear<br />
energy will increase substantially within the next few years.<br />
Australia holds 20% of the world's uncommitted reserves of<br />
uranium. We must seriously consider whether we have the right<br />
to withhold such significant supplies from a resource-hungry<br />
world. The benefits of uranium mining would of course be<br />
considerable, particularly in relation to the economy of the<br />
Northern Territory. But, before making any decision on mining,<br />
the Government must be absolutely satisfied that the interests<br />
of the aboriginal people are fully protected. We must be<br />
assured that the environment will be protected.<br />
The Government has already decided that if new export contracts<br />
for uranium are permitted, they will be subject to the most<br />
stringent set of safeguards announced by any country. There<br />
will also be a continuing effort to find ways of strengthening<br />
these safeguards, and we have indicated that we will participate<br />
in the international nuclear fuel cycle evaluation programme.<br />
We are satisfied that this policy represents a practical,<br />
reasonable and effective package of measures.<br />
The Government appreciates the significance and complexity of<br />
the uranium issue, and is giving detailed consideration to all<br />
the argument on both sides of this debate.<br />
At Perth, the ALP decided in 45 minutes to place an indefinite<br />
moratorium on the production and export of uranium, and to<br />
repudiate any uranium contracts entered into by a non-Labor<br />
Government. This was not a moral decision, not even a victory<br />
for hearts over heads. Morality does not change overnight<br />
the stand taken by the ALP in Government was diametrically<br />
opposed to the one it has now adopted.<br />
When the ALP was in government, its thinking on uranium was<br />
dominated by commercial considerations. Labor's uranium statements<br />
were punctuated not by moral dictates, but with dollar and cent<br />
signs. In October 1974 the Minister for Minerals and Energy said<br />
the ALP would " ensure that our major trading partners, Japan,<br />
Italy and West Germany, obtain an equitable share of the uranium<br />
we have for export." In October 1975, the Minister for Aboriginal<br />
Affairs stated that " International assurances have been provided<br />
by Ministers that Australia will meet the uranium requirements<br />
of our major trading partners which could amount to about 100,000<br />
tons of uranium". In March 1975, the then Deputy Prime Minister,<br />
Dr. Cairns, and the Minister for Agriculture, Senator Wriedt,<br />
issued a joint statement with Iran that " Iran would be given<br />
access to supplies of uranium from Australia under favourable<br />
conditions". On 2 June 1975, the present Shadow Minister for<br />
/ Minerals </p>
<p>3<br />
Minerals and Energy, Mr. Keating, said " Japan is interested<br />
in moving into nuclear power and enriched fuel. We are prepared<br />
to give the Japanese any amount of fuel that they need..." " The<br />
only thing is that we would like to do the enriching. Instead<br />
of sending just yellowcake at bargain-basement prices, we want<br />
to get the profit that comes from enrichment." At Terrigal in<br />
February 1975, ALP delegates stood and cheered as the then<br />
Minister for Minerals and Energy urged the go ahead for<br />
uranium mining.<br />
At that conference, the ALP decided to develop Australia's<br />
uranium resources and build a uranium enrichment plant. The<br />
conference totally rejected a motion to halt * uranium development<br />
for twelve months while a full scale government inquiry into<br />
nuclear technology was conducted. At that time Mr. Dunstan,<br />
the Premier of South Australia, one of the men who now advocates<br />
an indefinite moratorium, was promoting the establishment of a<br />
uranium enrichment plant in South Australia. Mr. Dunstan admits<br />
that he has changed his mind " quite markedly" on the issue of<br />
uranium. Whatever else may be said about Mr. Dunstan, no one<br />
would question that he has mastered the craft of understatement.<br />
On October 28, 1975, Mr. Whitlam signed a Memorandum of<br />
Understanding with representatives of Peko Mines and<br />
Electrolytic Zinc for the development, mining and sale<br />
of uranium from the Ranger area in the Northern Territory.<br />
Mr. Whitlam said, that " The Government believes that the Ranger<br />
project will be a major export earner and it will be working..<br />
to bring this mining project to fruition."<br />
In Government, the ALP's stand on uranium was based completely<br />
on commercial considerations. In Opposition, it was the<br />
product of cynical political manoeuvre. Those who think<br />
the ALP's position was based on moral considerations should<br />
ask themselves " what morality is there in a decision that<br />
ignores the world's energy needs?" / What morality </p>
<p>What morality is there in a decision that ignores the fact that<br />
it would accelerate the move to the plutonium economy?<br />
What morality was there is taking a decision that reversed<br />
established A. L. P. policy in 45 minutes, and on which none of the<br />
A. L. P.' s leaders spoke their mind? Mr Hawke, Mr Whitlam and<br />
Mr Hayden, all sat silent during the debate. Some people may be<br />
uncharitable enough to regard this as the great achievement<br />
of the A. L. P. conference. Perhaps the fact that Mr Hawke's<br />
heart said no, while his head said yes left him temporarily<br />
paralysed. Mr Hawke found his voice after the debate was over,<br />
after The resolution was passed.<br />
The mining and exporting of uranium does raise moral issues<br />
of fundamental importance Labor has always evaded them.<br />
My Government's steadfast position has been that decisions on<br />
uranium will not be based on the commercial considerations, that were<br />
so transparently at the heart of Labor's approach. our<br />
consideration of the issues has begun, and we have given first<br />
priority to considering the impact of mining on the welfare of<br />
Aborigines and on the natural environment, which is, in some<br />
cases, both beautiful and exceptionally fragile. These are<br />
basic issues, and there are many others including the adequacy<br />
of international safeguards to prevent nuclear weapons proliferation;<br />
the problem of the disposal of nuclear wastes, and the fact that<br />
Australian uranium can defer the move to the plutonian econony<br />
a deferal which would provide greater time for an international<br />
solution to be found to the hazards of plutonium and high level<br />
wastes; our obligation under the nuclear non-proliferation<br />
treaty and particularly Article IV of the Treaty; the urgency<br />
of the world's needs for uranium, to provide energy and the ethical<br />
question of whether we are entitled to withhold them; the<br />
world tension which would be created if we refused to supply uranium.<br />
Our decision will form a proper and considered response to these<br />
and to other complex moral and technical issues which uranium<br />
involves.<br />
Uranium was always the first issue European heads of Government<br />
raised with me during my recent visit to Europe. This was<br />
understandable since the Europeans like the Japanese are almost<br />
totally dependent on imported energy resources to generate the<br />
electricity necessary to keep their industries going and their homes<br />
operating. I emphasised during my visit to Europe the need to<br />
have major high level discussions on our trade relationships.<br />
We desire to broaden the relationship between Australia and the<br />
E. E. C. and Mr Peacock has already undertaken some moves to achieve<br />
this result. There is a need for Australia and Europe to<br />
recognise the common interest between us. It is these<br />
considerations which provide the broad background against which<br />
our trading relationship should be re-examined. </p>
<p>For some years, Europe has excluded Australian agricultural<br />
products from her markets, and disrupted our traditional markets<br />
in third countries by subsidising exports of her food surpluses.<br />
Recently, these policies of exclusion have been applied not<br />
only to agriculture but to Japanese manufactured goods and<br />
steel from Japan and South Africa. The attempt was also made<br />
to make Australia reduce our exports of steel to the E. E. C.<br />
by 25 percent on the grounds that Australia was an unfair trader.<br />
I would not voluntarily comtemplate such cuts and the request<br />
has since been withdrawn.<br />
The E. E. C. with its 260 million people is the world's largest<br />
trading bloc, accounting for 40 percent of the world's trade.<br />
If the problems in our trading relationship are to be adequately<br />
resolved, Australia has to be represented at a high level on<br />
a continuing basis. As you will have read, Mr John Howard<br />
has been appointed Minister for Special Trade Negotiations<br />
with the E. E. C. The appointment of a Minister for Special<br />
Trade Negotiations, rather than a senior official, will indicate<br />
to the Europeans the seriousness with which we regard the<br />
negotiations. A sthe Constitution requires that a Minister should head a<br />
Department, Mr Howard will head the new Department of the Special<br />
Trade Negotiator, comprised of between 20 and 30 people<br />
seconded from other Government Departments. Mr Howard<br />
will be involved in high level negotiations with the nine member<br />
states of the E. E. C. and the Commission in Brussels, on the<br />
totality of Australia's trading relations with Europe,<br />
a , ricultural items, industrial products and the supply of raw<br />
materials. He will keep under close consideration the question<br />
of developing and formalising a structural framework between<br />
Australia and the E. E. C. in order to further the development<br />
of trade between the two sides. And as a result of Mr Howard's<br />
appointment there will be closer consultation with the E. E. C.<br />
on matters of great Common interest. He will work closely in<br />
conjunction with the MI'inisters for Overseas Trade and Foreign<br />
Affairs, have immediate access to myself and have the full support<br />
of the Government.<br />
Finally, I would like to say something on racism. At the<br />
Commownealth Heads of Government Conference, I strongly opposed<br />
the policies of apartheid and white supremacy in Rhodesia/ Zimbabwe.<br />
The Liberal Party's opposition to these policies is not new<br />
in 1961 the Right Honourable Member for Kooyong said in the<br />
House of Representatives: " I am against apartheid, because it offends the conscience,<br />
against it as a basic policy, because it seems to be<br />
to be doomed to a terrible disaster".<br />
" The day will come when, conscious of their own human<br />
dignity, their capacity and their strength,<br />
( the blacks) will no longer tolerate the status of<br />
second class citizens." </p>
<p>" And when that day comes they will demand their due,<br />
not in an atmosphere of evolving friendship, but<br />
with hostility, and for all we know, violence."<br />
The ultimate conflict, as I said in London, may be bloody<br />
and devastating. The doctrine that one race is superior to<br />
another is repugnant to the basic beliefs of liberalism<br />
an affront to human decency. Such doctrines provide the conditions<br />
which communism can exploit, and every day that Mr Smith<br />
delays majority rule strengthens communism and increases the likelihoc<br />
of disaster in Southern Africa. If this is to be avoided, it<br />
is important that the opposition of countries like Australia be<br />
well known.<br />
And one of the important ways of bringing this point home is<br />
through our policy on sporting contacts with South Africa.<br />
On this matter I would like to say that there is no question of<br />
Australia introducing politics into sport. It is the Government<br />
that tells a black that he cannot play cricket with the whites<br />
just because of the colour of his skin which has introduced politics<br />
into sport.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen, you have as your local member an energetic<br />
and dedicated Foreign Minister. Andrew's efforts are serving<br />
Australia's national interests well, and I am sure that<br />
despite the fact that his duty takes him out of Australia frequently,<br />
he is serving his electorate as well as he is serving the country.<br />
