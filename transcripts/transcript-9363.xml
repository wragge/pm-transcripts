TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING, MP AND<br />
THE PRIME MINISTER OF IRELAND, MR ALBERT REYNOLDS, TD<br />
PARLIAMENT HOUSE, CANBERRA<br />
TUESDAY 20 SEPTEMBER, 1994<br />
PM: Let me begin by saying what a pleasure it is to have the Taoiseach with<br />
me in Australia and to be able to repay some of that exceptionally<br />
generous hospitality he extended to me just a year ago, almost to the<br />
day. We've had a very useful discussion about our bilateral<br />
relationships, about development in Europe and the Asia-Pacific area<br />
and I also had the benefit of the Taoiseach's view on the peace process<br />
in Ireland, in Northern Ireland, and I thought I would just take this<br />
opportunity of saying that a very large measure of the congratulations<br />
for this development go to his very courageous role and the risks that<br />
he has taken to promote peace within the island of Ireland and<br />
Northern Ireland. I think I can discern from his remarks his appreciation<br />
of the positive role that John Major and the British government played,<br />
and I think that all Australians hoped that there will be a genuine and<br />
lasting peace and reconciliation in Northern Ireland and this is a matter<br />
of great interest in Australia as such a large proportion Of the naiorn<br />
has Irish ancestry. I told the Taoiseach that Australia will offer<br />
assistance wherever it can you might recall Sir Ninian Stephen's role<br />
in the process, earlier process, in 1992 and naturally our moral<br />
support for the process which the Taoiseach has undertaken.<br />
So, on our bilateral relationship could I say that it is continuing to<br />
improve, we are seeing more investment in Australia from Ireland and<br />
vice versa. We're both in very advantageous positions, Australia<br />
relative to the Asia-Pacific, Ireland relative to Europe, and we are<br />
attracting investment and doing things because of those two factors.<br />
So, for me this is a matter of great personal joy to have the Taoiseach<br />
and his wife in Australia and, I think, the Australian people will get a<br />
chance to see him and talk with him, and to renew this friendship and<br />
acquaintance which the people of Australia have with the people of<br />
Ireland. It is a very timely visit and I am sure that, as a consequence,<br />
Australians will get to know Ireland better and, most particularly, at this<br />
important time, in this very significant moment in history in which the </p>
<p>Taoiseach has been so critically involved, himself. So, I would just<br />
invite him to make some introductory comments, should he wish to and<br />
then I am sure we'll both take questions.<br />
Thank you very much, Prime Minister. I certainly have enjoyed my visit<br />
to Australia, in the first few days I have been here. There is a<br />
traditional warmth and, as an Irish Prime Minister coming here, I feel<br />
like I am coming home because that is the type of warmth and welcome,<br />
indeed, that has been extended to me and, indeed, here today by<br />
your own Prime Minister.<br />
It is just a year ago, as he said, and it seems a very short year but a<br />
very momentous year as far as events in Ireland are concerned, in that<br />
both the Irish and the British governments have been involved in<br />
negotiations to try and bring peace to the island of Ireland after<br />
years of non stop violence and armed conflict. It is a centuries old<br />
problem in Ireland that we are trying to address and, first of all we had<br />
the success of the Downing Street Declaration which addressed all of<br />
the concerns of both communities, which, indeed, looked at the<br />
uncertainties for the future, as both communities saw it; which set out a<br />
set of principles on which a future agreement could be constructed;<br />
and, indeed, it has received overwhelming support from the Irish<br />
people, North and South, and, indeed, has been tremendously well<br />
supported by governments throughout the world as well.<br />
We, of course, because of our historic links here going back to the<br />
early days of settlers, indeed, people who came here not voluntarily<br />
and some of them who tried to get away in a hurry out of here, I am not<br />
one of those. But, I think that it is important that we're here, to explain<br />
to the Australian people who have a deep and abiding interest, indeed,<br />
in seeing peace return to Ireland after centuries of conflict and I believe<br />
we're well on the way to do that. We had, of course, a momentous<br />
decision by the IRA to stop violence for good and we're now entering<br />
the third week and despite provocation it has not broken down and it<br />
will not break down and it will be there. And I think we can build on that<br />
position and hopefully as the others who are involved in armed conflict<br />
in the other community will see the way to join the peace process and<br />
make a reciprocal decision on their part.<br />
So, I am delighted to be here, indeed, with Prime Minister Keating, I<br />
know that he enjoyed going to Ireland to seek out his roots as, indeed,<br />
so many Australians do, we have seen a development on the economic<br />
front, between Australian companies coming to Ireland and Irish<br />
companies coming to Australia. Because, we're both part of areas of<br />
the world where trade is expanding, where economies are expanding,<br />
and, indeed, the Australian economy is now growing as the Irish<br />
economy is growing. And, there is a lot more to be gained by bilateral<br />
cooperation, by economic cooperation and both of us, indeed are<br />
strongly of the view that as world trade expands the market is a global<br />
market. We indeed, manage an economy that has to export 70 per cent </p>
<p>of what we produce to make our way in the world. It is a very<br />
successful economy in Ireland, at the moment one of the most<br />
successful in the OECD, with a growth rate of about five and a half per<br />
cent, a low inflation rate of between two and two and a half per cent,<br />
very strong balance of payments and balance of trade situations all<br />
building a good situation to expand as Europe, indeed, begins to come<br />
out of recession. And, of course, down here in this part of the world it is<br />
the same where world trade is growing, where the Pacific rim, indeed, is<br />
very strong economically. The development of trade always, at the end<br />
of the day, comes back to provide a better quality of life and a better<br />
standard of living for people and I think that is what both of us are in<br />
politics for. Thank you.<br />
J: Mr Reynolds, could I ask you today we've heard Gerry Adams and<br />
Sinn Fein reject the notion of a referendum as put by John Major saying<br />
it's premature and inappropriate do you have any reaction to that at<br />
the moment?<br />
AR: Well, it's implicit in the Downing Street Declaration that when and if we<br />
get an agreement, you know, a broadly structured agreement in a<br />
balanced constitutional manner, I have always said on behalf of the<br />
Irish Government that we would put to the Irish people in a referendum<br />
possible changes in the Irish Constitution that it would make its own<br />
contribution to a just and lasting settlement to the problem in Ireland,<br />
and that the British Government indeed have intimated on a number of<br />
occasions that they would be holding a referendum in Northern Ireland<br />
concurrently with the one in the South. So, what both Governments<br />
want to do is to transfer the decision making process for the future of<br />
Ireland to the people of Ireland North and South, and take away the<br />
Governments from getting involved. As you know, the Government of<br />
Ireland Act of 1920, section 75, is really the Constitutional basis on<br />
which partition was imposed in Ireland. That's their constitutional basis<br />
our constitutional basis is Articles 2 and 3 of the Irish Constitution.<br />
We have said that in a balanced constitution and overall settlement, we<br />
would be putting the case to the Irish people, and they would be doing<br />
the same. That's the way forward and at the end of the day, the people<br />
will be the deciders, and not politicians and not governments.<br />
J: Prime Minister, you spoke about offering help to the peace process<br />
whatever help you can give did you discuss with the Taoiseach the<br />
possibility of giving financial aid to Northern Ireland?<br />
PK: I did, and I'll be saying something further about that tonight.<br />
J: Mr Reynolds, did you ask the Prime Minister about the question of<br />
Visas to Sinn Fein people coming to Australia?<br />
AR: I explained to the prime minister in relation to our overall discussion on<br />
the peace process and how it's developing, and in relation to possible<br />
applications I understand he doesn't have any applications for Visas </p>
<p>from any members of Sinn Fein at the moment that the position of the<br />
Irish Government was that we now treat Sinn Fein as a fully<br />
constitutional party. I have personally met Gerry Adams, I have<br />
personally involved them in the negotiation process because one of my<br />
obligations under the Downing Street Declaration is to set up a forum<br />
for peace and reconciliation in Ireland. Recognising that you must first<br />
of all reconcile the people that have been driven apart by the last<br />
years of Irish conflict. That you must get people to unite in mind and in<br />
soul and in heart before you can talk about territorial reunification, and I<br />
believe that is the way forward. And to do that I am setting up<br />
hopefully by the end of October a forum for peace and reconciliation<br />
in which all parties are invited to participate, and that includes Sinn<br />
Fein because I have made it clear all along that if Sinn Fein, IRA and<br />
the Republican Movement were to make a decision to leave behind<br />
violence for good which they have done I was prepared to make way<br />
for them and find a place for them in the political process. I have done<br />
that, and they're now a constitutional party in so far as the Irish<br />
Government is concerned. But at the end of the day, if they make<br />
applications to come to Australia, it would be a matter for the Australian<br />
Government to make their own decisions in that regard.<br />
J: Mr Keating, what would be Australia's response?<br />
PK: Well, as the Prime Minister said we have not had applications at this<br />
point but, obviously, we will take account of the changed climate in<br />
Ireland the ambience there. Our interest always was the likelihood of<br />
some sort of discord here in the past in the event that the ambience has<br />
changed, and changed to the point the Taoiseach has made clear that<br />
he regards Sinn Fein as a constitutional party the mere fact of him<br />
saying that makes a difference, I think, to the attitude we would take<br />
were an application by a representatives of Sinn Fein to be received by<br />
us.<br />
J: Would you go as far, Mr Keating, to say that we could draw from that<br />
the inference that in principle representatives of Sinn Fein are now<br />
welcome?<br />
PK: No. Well, we'll see what happens if we get an application at this point<br />
we haven't got any.<br />
J: Mr Keating, the ALP National Conference is expected to consider the<br />
question of British troops being withdrawn from Northern Ireland do<br />
you believe they should be?<br />
PK: Well, I think the Taoiseach has made very clear to you today that this is<br />
a matter that should be left to the people of the island of Ireland. That<br />
the matter shouldn't be resolved, in a sense, by the politicians in<br />
parliaments as has sought to be done now for so long, unsuccessfully.<br />
And that if that sovereignty is restored and returned to the people<br />
where decisions can be made by referendum in Ireland or by change to </p>
<p>an Act of Parliament in Britain, and referendum in Northern Ireland<br />
then those events can pave the way to a settlement here. The<br />
important thing, I think, is that life returns to as near as normal in this<br />
environment, and that would, I think, tell me that troops would be better<br />
withdrawn as this position of trust improves, and where I think,<br />
particularly the British Government take the view that this is a durable<br />
cease-fire.<br />
AR: I think to add to that the reason the British Army are there is to support<br />
the security forces, and it's because of the conflict over the last<br />
years between the 2 communities, and between para-militaries on both<br />
sides. So if you get a situation where a definitive decision has been<br />
made on behalf of the IRA to cease violence and hopefully that<br />
decision will emanate from Loyalist para-militaries in due course then<br />
the need for the British Army in the large numbers that they are present<br />
on the streets of Northern Ireland will be no longer required. And I<br />
have no doubt that the British Government will be only too delighted to<br />
withdraw troops back out of Northern Ireland as soon as the security<br />
threat as they see it de-escalates. And it has been de-escalating over<br />
the last couple of weeks, and as days and weeks go by, I have no<br />
doubt that they will be assured that there is less and less need for<br />
British Army on the streets, and possibly the first step in that would be<br />
when they feel that the security threat is gone from para-militaries on<br />
both sides, that they would withdraw the troops to barracks as a first<br />
step, and after that it is a matter for them to withdraw them in the<br />
numbers as they see the threat de-escalate.<br />
J: Prime Minister Reynolds, could I just direct your mind to the APEC<br />
issues for a minute. There's been a lot of concern among the European<br />
community about the way APEC might go and develop. In your talks<br />
today have you been reassured about the way APEC is likely to evolve<br />
in terms of European relations with Australia?<br />
AR: Yes, we have had a good discussion on APEC and how the Prime<br />
Minster and the other members see it developing, and what both of us<br />
want to see is that whatever groups whether it's APEC and the<br />
European Union, NAFTA on the other side of the world, and all the<br />
others that in the end, we all contribute to the development of world<br />
trade, to continuing growth in the various economies around the world,<br />
and if that can be the end result, it can only be good for this part of the<br />
world and for Europe as well.<br />
ends. </p>
