The Australian Government welcomes the adoption of UN Security Council Resolution 1973, which importantly calls for the imposition of a no fly zone over Libya and demands the immediate establishment of a ceasefire and a complete end to violence. </p>
<p>The resolution also authorises member states to take all necessary measures to protect civilians under threat of attack while excluding an occupation force.This is an important step by the international community towards stopping the Qaddafi regime's attacks on the Libyan people.</p>
<p>The broad-ranging package of measures adopted by the Security Council includes a ban on flights by Libyan aircraft, including Libyan commercial flights.</p>
<p>These measures strengthen enforcement of the UN arms embargo and broaden the reach of the financial sanctions.</p>
<p>The Australian Government was among the first to call for decisive action by the international community, including a UN-mandated no fly zone.</p>
<p>Through this action, the UN Security Council has invoked the Responsibility to Protect for the second time in three weeks and has taken decisive action to protect civilians in Libya.</p>
<p>UNSCR1973 provides a clear legal mandate for the imposition of a no fly zone.The Council has now responded to the calls from the international community, in particular the Arab League, for the imposition of such a zone.This is particularly timely given our fears for the people of Benghazi, who are facing attack from Qaddafi's forces.Qaddafi has warned Benghazi's residents that his army is coming with full force and that there will be no mercy, and Qaddafi's son Seif Al Islam has threatened rivers of blood.Australia has already fully implemented UNSC1970 and adopted autonomous sanctions measures against the regime. </p>
