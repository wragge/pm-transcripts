INAUGURAL ADDRESS BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE RT.<br />
HON. R. G. MENZIES TO TME AUSTRALIAN COLLEGE OF<br />
EDUCATION, ADELAHP. FRIDAY, 19TH MAY, 196,.<br />
THE CH-, ', ENGE TO EDUCATION<br />
It would perhaps ' e prudent to say, at the very outset,<br />
that I am not here as the lead of a government making a policy<br />
speech outlining new poli ies or forecasting future financial<br />
benefits and burdens. 1 ' ave been honoured by your invitation<br />
to make the Inaugural e at the second annual meeting of<br />
the Australian College ucaton. That very great teacher,<br />
Dr. Darling, wrote to me . e wo. 1d like you to speak on the<br />
theme of Australia in th rnext t,-enty years and what you, as the<br />
leader of the country, expect or desire from us the teachers."<br />
This opportunity I have accepted, if I may say so,<br />
not as one who seeks to express a Government or a party point of<br />
view but as one who has been privileged to have something to do,<br />
small enough in all conscience, with recent educational<br />
advancement in Australia, something which had the support of all<br />
parties; and as one with a profound belief in the tremendous<br />
significance of the teacher's calling. What I have to say will<br />
therefore be more philosophical, in the non-technical sense,<br />
than political, in the narrow and partisan sense.<br />
For indeed, your voluntary responsibilities are very<br />
great. You have established this College to help you to<br />
discharge them better and better. You have made it clear that<br />
you look on teaching not mer,. ly as a means of earning a living<br />
but as a vocation which will enable you to contribute to the<br />
fullness of life,<br />
To do anything to help or to stimulate is therefore a<br />
singular privilege. Education and educators are beyond doubt confronting a<br />
great challenge both material, intellectual and spiritual.<br />
At a later stmgo I will endeavour to bring these<br />
elements into association For the present, however, I will<br />
speak of the material cLa challenge which is to be<br />
heard all round the world,<br />
It is calculated by the statisticians that in 1950<br />
the population of the world was 2,500 million; that in 1975 it<br />
will be 3,800 million; and that in 2000 it will be over 6,000<br />
million! These forecasts are, of course, based on present trends<br />
and the absence of massive catastrophe. To produce food, shelter,<br />
clothing, and a decently ordered life for such growing myriads is<br />
a vast problem. There is a strange irony in this reflection; that as<br />
what is called the " space age" begins to what end and for what<br />
human purpose most of us cannot understand tim " FRrth Age"<br />
approaches the most acute problems it will have ever confronted.<br />
The solving of those problems should be our first priority.<br />
Clearly the population problem will be insoluble, and will<br />
therefore produce the most frightful struggles for survival, with<br />
wars and pestilences their regular accompaniment, unless the<br />
earth's productivity is onormously increased, and/ or the rate of<br />
population grcwhis slowed down.<br />
If productivity is to be increased in economically<br />
backward countries, advanced countries will need a growing sense<br />
of international social and economic responsibility, and will,<br />
both directly and indirectly, need to increase efficiency and<br />
skill all round in production, transport, and distribution. </p>
<p>There must also be immense improvements in organization, in<br />
political and civil administrati on, in scientific research and<br />
in the application of th?/ roso-ech to the provision of human<br />
needs. Not one of tho rosul. ts c;. i reasonably be achieved<br />
by the ignorant, the unskil. ful, * r by the socially<br />
irresponsible i. e. the lay:<br />
In general, ppr. aching crisis presents a<br />
dramatic challenge to . tio. : p. o who enjoy pence,<br />
order, good government, nii u . Ii. al tr:--dards. It is a<br />
rebuke to those who, Lc. oo. a: brd,;-s for international<br />
assistance, remind us oi Yhat proverb, that " charity<br />
begins at home."<br />
But in particular -it is a challenge to us, as a<br />
nation, to play our pa-rt in incirasing the world's resources.<br />
And, in essence, that is a challengo to us to improve our<br />
education; for it is only by constantly improving education<br />
and skills that we can discharge our world duty.<br />
Improvements in a. ricu1 trein pastures, in stock<br />
breeding, do not come about by acr-ident. They are the products<br />
of research, of scientific application, and of concentrated<br />
skill. The storing and d-. stribution of water calls for<br />
engineors, surveyors, and a host of technical people. Moreover,<br />
much available skill will. be wasted without intelligent and<br />
trained managers and organisers. Without increasingly educated<br />
people and political ad: inistrators, material potentialities<br />
may be either unrealised or partly frustrated by confusion or by<br />
a lack of imagination. Those are obvious and elementary truths.<br />
It should be equally obvious that without growing<br />
numbers of trained and dedicated teachers, we cannot meet the<br />
demand in Australia and elsewhere, for the scientific,<br />
technological, and managerial and administrative skills demanded<br />
by the task and the time.<br />
Yet this does not mean that if, in the homely phrase<br />
we could " write our own ticket", we would concentrate upon<br />
producing technicians and specialists destined from their<br />
earlier days to the particular technique or specialty. We would,<br />
I hope, want to do bet-or than that. For, as I shall remind you<br />
later on, a specialist '--Ithout some reasonable degree of basic<br />
education of a humane kind can do more harm than good.<br />
We must do our best to avoid early specialisation. In<br />
an educated man or woman, specialisation will come soon enough.<br />
It will come more effectively, valuably, if it is the<br />
product of a judgment enli. htoen-d by broad and basic studies.<br />
In 1959 Admiral Rickover, famous for his driving work<br />
in nuclear propulsion, evidence before the United States<br />
House of Reprosentati-s' Coi:. tt. oo on Appropriations. He had<br />
some good things to say, ixhi. clhl take leave to quote for my<br />
present purpose. " A liberal , ation tends to liberate the mind from<br />
the narrow confines of pcrs. ona-l observation through one's<br />
senses. " A liberal education also lays the foundation of<br />
knowledge upon which professional education is built."<br />
" Too many people here think of a liberal education as<br />
a luxury, something of no inmediate usefulness. It is true<br />
that a liberal education does not in itself prepare one<br />
to earn a living. For this one needs in addition some<br />
specialist skill". </p>
<p>3.<br />
We know that there are difficulties, not all of them<br />
financial, in the way of achieving this ideal, One of those<br />
difficulties is the parent wlbo sys: ' I want i-. r son to earn his<br />
living in a specialised and i, ,, b2. y-pad or craft. I want<br />
no time wasted on frills. What is not cilearly and immediately<br />
relevant to the main end is un--i.._,. rtajt. and a waste of tine".<br />
The good teacher, who wants to help to produce not just<br />
a good scientist or engineer, but also a good and wise citizen<br />
will resist these basically uncivilised ideas to the very limits<br />
of his capacity. This does not mean, of course, that all must<br />
be educated in the same way; that there will be merit in<br />
uniformity. If, as I hope and believe the grand objective is an<br />
educated personality, and personality Is of all elements the most<br />
individual, we must not bow down and worship a false equality.<br />
For education, though. it has a mass aspect, since we<br />
must aim at certain basic training which all should have, is not,<br />
properly considered, a riass matter. It is not the business of<br />
today's educators to turn out the 1961 model, with automatic<br />
mental transmission gears. Once we get above the rudiments,<br />
education is the business, I repeat, of produc1ng an educated<br />
personality. The wo: k of organising a coinaunity educational<br />
service is therefore a complex one, requiring great skill,<br />
devotion, and understanding. What is to be aimed at is a<br />
general system, producing individuals of great variety.<br />
In Australia, I. believe that we tend to carry unifon'ity<br />
too far. Even in the drafting of the Commonwcalth Constitution<br />
the fears of the self-governing colonies, fears that one prospective<br />
State might secure some advantage over another<br />
produced a series of requirements of " uniformity" which have not<br />
always been of advantage. For example, Section 99 of the<br />
Constitution provides, reflecting the fears of the Nineties, that<br />
" The Commonwealth shall not, by any law or regulation<br />
of trade, commerce, or revenue, give preference to one State<br />
or any part thereof over another State or any partthereof".<br />
Though this promisiorj has pcrhaps been splendidly<br />
ignored in the special tax prov: ii ra0 1! ting to remote areas,<br />
it is clear to many of us that slIa] Lisc. b or trade treatment<br />
of particular parts of thc; Comnn x tt rnay ' rove to be vital to<br />
a true and balanced n dov 0 passion for<br />
uniformity can be carric?, much far,<br />
I return to my subject, education, whore this same<br />
passion can do great harm. Except in broad physical<br />
characteristics, men are not uniform. They all want education,<br />
but they do not all need the same kind of educa-tion. I oppose<br />
early specialisation at sdool, for it serves to narrow the mind<br />
and restrict the full development of personality. But in the<br />
later stages before matriculation there nust be some room for a<br />
consideration of the life which the boy is expected to live.<br />
What is good for the prospective University student is not<br />
necessarily identical with what is good for a prospective wheat<br />
farmer. Each should know something of language and literature<br />
and history, to take some examples, for these are part of the<br />
essential furniture of his mind. But when it comes to special<br />
subjects, each should be given his chance.<br />
When I first met them, years ago, I was much<br />
impressed ( as I still am) by the Tasmanian Area Schools, with<br />
their special studies for boys who were going to live and work<br />
on the land. I saw great cono. on sense in this, so long as it<br />
did not impair those general studies which seem to me to be<br />
essential for education of any kind. </p>
<p>It is just because I think that too much uniformity in<br />
education is bad, and philosophically considered, self-defeating,<br />
that I do not believe that the constitutional power over<br />
education should be transferred to the Comnonn. alth Parliament.<br />
In a continent like ours, with i: rnohse vari. et.~ e-s of physical and<br />
humrian characteristics, variety bu ( i'volopod. Men are<br />
different. It is just because they are differmnt that our<br />
parliamentary democracy survives. For the greatest of all<br />
liberties is that which exists in a nan's own mind. It is a<br />
liberty of which he alone is master, and it makes him to that<br />
extent a master, not a servant. Produce in a nation a generation<br />
of men and women with liberty in their own individual minds, and<br />
dictatorship becomes impossible.<br />
Montesquieu, who has had such an influence upon organic<br />
political science, had no respect for uniformity. He looked for<br />
a system of government ( which the United States and Australia to<br />
Sa degree adopted) where there is a division of power, where<br />
power checks power. He firmly believed that the idea of<br />
uniformity appealed to little minds, who found in it a species of<br />
perfection. Whatever brand of politics the student nay some day<br />
profess, or reject or ignore, the educator must look at him, not<br />
as an economic unit some day Lo be recorded by a statistician,<br />
but as an individual, to be sent out into the world some day as a<br />
better individual. For the better the individual the more<br />
conscious will he be of his responsibilities to his neighbour and<br />
to society. But learning and skill are not all. One of the aims of<br />
this College is " to uphold within the profession and to proclaim<br />
in the community the higher values of education". This is<br />
supremely important, if bad money is not to dkive out good, and<br />
lead to a general debasement of the moral and intellectual<br />
currency. I take leave to adopt, with acknowledgement, the wise<br />
words of Father J. P. Gleeson at the Founders Convention, when<br />
this aim was under discusion<br />
" All knowledge is grist to the mill of the educator;<br />
but unless he conctrms himself Tith his pupil's character he<br />
remains an informer, a source of fLicts piled upon one<br />
another and imparted to a mind both immature and untrained<br />
in their proper use."<br />
This idea that character, a proper conception of<br />
life, is the element most necessary to be achieved, runs right<br />
through every aspect of life. As Charles Morgan said in his<br />
" Liberties of the Mind" a book which should stand<br />
alongside Sir Richard Livingstone's " Education for a World<br />
Adrift" near every educated man's fireside<br />
" Everything, including democracy, is destroyed by its<br />
own extremes: personal rule by absolutism; oligarchy, or<br />
bureaucracy, by closeness, rigidity, and centralisation;<br />
plutocracy by avarice; democracy by a watering of its only<br />
valid currency of self-discipline and self-respect."<br />
I seek your indulgence when I quote another passage<br />
from the same book which I have for years found quite haunting<br />
" Immortality is not to be voted at a political meeting.<br />
Posterity will not stay in any man's school. We are wilful<br />
and enchanted children, by the grace of God He whom we<br />
love and remember is not he who thrusts upon us his own </p>
<p>dusty chart of the Supreme Reality, scored over with his<br />
arguments, prejudices, and opinions; nor he who will draw a<br />
nap of heaven on the blackboard and chastise us with<br />
scorpions if we will not fall down and worship it; but he<br />
who will pull the curtain away from the classrocm window<br />
and let us see our own heaven with our own eyes. Añ d this<br />
enablement of mankind I take to be the function of true<br />
education for the very word neans a leading out, and to<br />
lead out the spirit of man, through the wise, liberating<br />
self-discipline of learning and wonder, has been the glory<br />
of great teachers and of great universities since<br />
civilisation began to flower".<br />
In other words behind, inspiring and making a good<br />
use of skills, there must be an increasing awareness of the<br />
ethical aspects of life. For without such awareness, and the<br />
individual attitude which it will produce, all of our educational<br />
efforts can bring us to ultimate disaster.<br />
I use the word ethics in a general way; not as<br />
denoting " Christian ethics", th. ugh to nany of us these are the<br />
highest; not in any discriminating sense. Christianity remains,<br />
as a Scottish preacher once said, dramatically, in my hearing<br />
" the greatest ninority movement in the history of the world".<br />
But there are other religions with their own ethical rules and<br />
moral compulsions. The main thing is that education must notbaso<br />
resolutely utilitarian as to be pagan and degrading. Secular<br />
education must not come to mean selfish education.<br />
I an convinced that if our approach to education is<br />
( in the popular " practical" way) " how much can I get for myself<br />
out of it or how much can my family get out of it in terms of<br />
financial advantage or social position?" then we shall see the<br />
material advancement of the nation matched by moral decay, and<br />
ultimately destroyed by it.<br />
I have stressed the point of ethics because I believe<br />
that the most important thing to consider and learn in this<br />
world is the nature of man his duties and rights, his place in<br />
society, his relationship to his Creator. This is why as Sir<br />
Richard Livingstone says in " The Rainbow Bridge" " history<br />
and literature must enter into any education; for they are our<br />
chief records of man and his ways."<br />
This is, of course, not to subtract one thing from<br />
the immense importance of the teaching of science and technology<br />
to which, quite clearly, we must devote more and more effort and<br />
attention. For the world reasons to which I have referred, we<br />
have a moral obligation to promote all of those practical<br />
studies which will help to solve the population and production<br />
problem. But this is not to obscure the truth that, whether our<br />
education is to produce scientists or engineers or doctors, or<br />
lawyers or teachers or preachers, there are basic studies which<br />
are essential for educated people, and the absence of which can<br />
make a man of technical skill a social menace.<br />
It is perhaps unfortunate that a notion has obtained<br />
some currency, that there is an educational conflict between<br />
the study of science and the study of the humanities; that<br />
students should be put to their choice of one or the other.<br />
This is quite wrong. We live in a material world, the forces in<br />
which it is the business of sciance to understand, and the<br />
business of technology to harness and direct. But this world,<br />
of matter and physical dynamism, is a world in which men live;<br />
in which the fate and welfare of men must be the prime<br />
consideration. </p>
<p>It is in this sense that " the proper study of mankind<br />
is man". I believe that the greatest scientists are well aware<br />
of this; are conscious of the duality of their task. We must<br />
not achieve a lop-sidedness in our education. L scientist who<br />
was unaware of literature and history or of the principles of<br />
social responsibility would be dangerous. A humanist who turned<br />
his back upon the discoveries in natural science, who did not<br />
know something of their impact upon life and living would be<br />
conder ming himself to a socially fruitless lifo in a non-radioactive<br />
ivory tower.<br />
I come back, therefore, to those basic studies which<br />
are essential for educated people. In Australia, Latin and Greek<br />
appear to be on the way out, to the impoverishment of our<br />
understanding of our own language, and of our historic sense.<br />
We must seek to repair this position, not by a vain attempt to<br />
restore the old classical learning, but by insisting, in all our<br />
educational plans upon some reasonable knowledge of our language,<br />
of history, and of the processes of thought. This last is<br />
important, not as some separate subject for the class-room, but<br />
as something which pervades others. After all the business of<br />
the educator is to teach students to think, ana to think for<br />
themselves. The neglect of the English language, both in writing<br />
and in speech, seems to me to be quite seriois. I have known<br />
Doctors of Philosophy in Economics, for example, whose disregard<br />
of clear and grammatical Ehglish and whose subservience to<br />
jargon add to the natural difficulties of the reader, and make<br />
one regret that J. M. Keynes is no longer with us. There are<br />
some men of great mental ability and equipment who struggle to<br />
find utterance through obscurity " you know what I meanl"<br />
Perhaps we have not fully realised that the more<br />
complex life becomes, and the more the business of discovery<br />
goes on, the more important is clarity and persuasiveness of<br />
speech and writing.<br />
Knowledge, to be of use to others, should be<br />
communicated to others. I remember, many years ago, saying to<br />
the late Sir John Monash, after hearing him put a case to the<br />
Victorian Government in relation to the State Electricity<br />
Commission, of which he was the founding Chairman " you know,<br />
Sir John, everybody knows you as a very great soldier and a<br />
notable engineer. But I think of you also as one of the<br />
greatest advocates I have ever listened to." He smiled and<br />
said " These things are, after all, not unrelated. I doubt<br />
whether I could have done what I did in France, or got my ideas<br />
put into operation, if I had not acquired and practised the<br />
great art of expression!"<br />
Clearly we neglect the treasures of our language at<br />
our peril and, on occasion, to the loss of others.<br />
As for the treasures of our literature, perhaps the<br />
richest in the world, we owe it to ourselves and to others<br />
constantly to refresh our minds and our memories by<br />
enthusiastic reading. May I illustrate this by a reference to<br />
an art of which I must by now have learned something; the art<br />
of politics. Nothing has so widespread a significance for the<br />
daily life of a nation as the decisions taken by goverrnments.<br />
Small errors can do harm; great errors can inflict grievous<br />
injury. The statesman therefore has the initial responsibility<br />
of close study and concentrated thought leading to a decision<br />
in his own mind. </p>
<p>But the problem does not end there. Ho must<br />
communicate his ideas, to a Cabinet, to Parliament, to the<br />
people. He must do this as well as he possibly can. His<br />
language must be such as to arrest and sustain interest, He<br />
must not condescend. He must seek to instruct, to oxplain, and<br />
to inspire. The vocabulary he employs must be rich afid flexible.<br />
He must not under-estimate the public by thinking that the<br />
comon-place is good enough. I am no great example in these<br />
matters, but having prepared my ideas and my arguments for an<br />
important speech, I find it a good thing, tho night before, to<br />
read poetry. To some, this sounds silly; but it can make a<br />
great difference in the choice of words and in the weight and<br />
balance of sentences when the time to speak comes.<br />
I turn now to what I will call some specific<br />
challenges in the field of education.<br />
There is, of course, a great challenge to our<br />
university structure, brought about by the fantastic rate of<br />
increase in the demand for higher education. This is the most<br />
remarkable feature of the post-war years.<br />
I remember, just after the war, brooding gloomily upon<br />
the future of the great public schools, many of them Church<br />
foundations. Could they survive what was likely to be a<br />
prolonged period of high taxation? Could parents face<br />
increased fees under such circumstances? My brooding was wasted;<br />
these schools have doubled and trebled in size, and have long<br />
waiting lists. The same is true of the universities. The end of the<br />
war saw a great rush of new students. Accommodation became<br />
hopelessly overcrowded; classes became too big for effective<br />
work. The Murray Committee writing in 1957, when actual<br />
university enrolments were 6,50Q, forecast an enrolment by<br />
1960 of 4+ 8,000. In fact the figures turned out to be 53,0001<br />
Murray thiought he was entering the realms of phantasy when ho<br />
gave 71 000 as the prospective figure for 1965. But the present<br />
Universities Commission estimates that the figure will be just<br />
on 90,000. In the face of these figures, at once so stimulating<br />
and so mienacing, are we to go along the old paths of the 19th<br />
century university conception, or must we devise new and varied<br />
instruments of tertiary education, some more advanced and<br />
costly than others, some simpler and cheaper? Can we make more<br />
effective and economic use of the facilities we now have? My<br />
Government is about to set up a special and powerful committee<br />
to advise the University Commission on these questions. It will<br />
" consider the pattern of higher education in relation to the<br />
needs and resources of the nation and make recommendation on<br />
the future development of higher education in Australia".,<br />
A similar investigation is being conducted in Great<br />
Britain. The demands of education at all stages are tremendous.<br />
Socially, this is good. But we shall do badly if we ignore ( as<br />
I fear rmany do), the inexorable practical considerations which<br />
must be taken into account.<br />
Money is not unlimited, even in the Commonwealth<br />
Treasury. I find it constantly necessary to point out that<br />
governments have no money of their own. Governments are trustees<br />
not independent capitalists. Every effective pound of their<br />
expenditure must be worked for and earned by the people, and<br />
transferred to government by means of taxation and loans, </p>
<p>Yet, within the limits of their capacity thus<br />
created? governments in. Australia have been both aware and<br />
responsive, In university education, the student aspects of which<br />
I have-just mentioned, the financial involvements are huge. in<br />
my own time as Prime Minister the Comonwealth without direct<br />
constitutional responsibility save in its own territories, has<br />
found, 9for State university grants, rapidly incraasing sums.<br />
From 150, when our first special grant was made, until and<br />
including 1957, the total was al. gm In the Murray trienniiuma<br />
1958-59-60, it'was œ 21.843m. In the current period 1961-2-3<br />
it rises to œ C40.809ml Great and growing though these figuresare,<br />
they are very greatly exceeded by the amounts found by the<br />
States themselves. On the forecasts of student population, it is clear<br />
that even with a " Inew look" at the structure and instruments of<br />
tertiary education, the Budget burdens will continue to grow<br />
greater and greater.<br />
In education, including primiary and secondary, State<br />
Governments have, I believe, dlone remarkably well, assisted by<br />
the Commonwealth-States financial arrangements for taxreimbursement<br />
and loan works programmes. In 1950-51 total<br />
expenditure on education by the States was œ C+ 6m. Expenditure<br />
for 1959-60 was over œ C160m.<br />
It becomes clear that gYovernments of all kinds are<br />
aware of the challenge of education and are striving manfully<br />
to meet it. But even more onerous than the financial burden<br />
which the nation will cheerfully carry as it sees the national<br />
benefits accrue, is the problem of maintaining the supply and.<br />
the standards of professors, lecturers, and teachers. We must<br />
in large measure produce these ourselves for the demands of<br />
education elsewhere are no less insistent than our own.<br />
Standards and quality are vital. If the pressure upon our<br />
trained human resources grows too g; reat, higher education will<br />
suffer a grievous and perhaps a fatal blow,<br />
And there is another challenge, to teachers of all<br />
grades, primary, secondary, tertiary. You may exercise<br />
yourselves, not unnaturally, about your rights. I understand<br />
this. For a good teacher is a good man, and he ought to be<br />
paid as such. Every man of intellect and responsibility who<br />
chooses the noble vocation of teaching should not have to devote<br />
too great a share of his timie to the problems of physical<br />
living. Right through the whole structure of teaching, salaries<br />
should be adequate,, There have been, in modern times, great<br />
improvements in this field. No doubt, there is still room for<br />
improvement. But a sense of vocation has its own compulsions. And<br />
the greatest of these compulsions is to seek out and expound the<br />
truth. There can be no room for the slipshod or the tendentious.<br />
The old rules hold good; that " references should be verified",<br />
that facts should be ascertained with care and presented wit<br />
precision. An educated man is one who, In addition to a<br />
reasonable stock-in-trade of factual information technical or<br />
otherwise, has learned to think for himself and to form<br />
objective judgments. " Read not to contradict and confute, nor<br />
to believe and take for granted, nor to find talk and<br />
discourse, but to weigh and consider".. </p>
<p>Thcre is still agoo) deal of mental dishonesty in the<br />
world; it is perhaps more prevalent than larceny from the<br />
person. " Arrive in advance at your conclusion, guided by emotion<br />
or prejudice; then force the facts into the pro-determined<br />
mouldi" No man can be a great, or even a good teacher, who<br />
yields to this temaptation. Yet there are those, in schools and<br />
universities, who do. To teach history, for example so as to<br />
justify some current and porsonally held political theory, is to<br />
deface history and obscure the lassons it can teach to the<br />
uninhibited and unbiassed mind. The -ood teacher has a great<br />
power and a great glory. As we all know, looking back, he<br />
achieves though he may not know it at the tim, a species of<br />
honourable immortality with his students. Butl this is because<br />
he is a true teacher, not one who worships false gods.<br />
I fear that in this address which, you will have no<br />
difficulty in understanding, I have had to prepare in stolen<br />
hours in a period of great political pressures my remarks have<br />
been unduly discursive. But it may be at least not harmfiul if I<br />
sum up my own thesis.<br />
Education in Australia has two great tasks. One, which<br />
it would be aloofly academic to ijizore or to disparage is to<br />
train as many students as possible in bodies of knowl eage which<br />
will make them more competent to deal with the practical affairs<br />
of life. We must train and equip more competent workers in<br />
every branch of every industry; more and bettor sciontists and<br />
technologists; more and better admr~ inistrators engineers,<br />
doctors and lawyers; m~ ore trained and dedica ed educators;<br />
more and. more equipped and responsible electors and those they<br />
choose for the duties of government. This is a great and costly<br />
task, To the extent that we fail in it, we will imperil our<br />
own material advancement. But the other great task is even more<br />
important. It is a anmon, but attractive error, to think of<br />
modern advances in applied science, from the telephone to<br />
television, from the motor-car to aircraft to rockets and space<br />
vehicles, as in themselves the proof of advancing civilisation.<br />
These are among the mere mechanical aids to civilisation, They<br />
may be wisely or wickedly used6 Civilisation is in the hearts<br />
and minds of men. It will advance or fall back according to the<br />
use we make of knowledge and of skill. In spite of all we have<br />
had to our hands, the twentieth century has seen more of greed<br />
and inhumanity, more of war and barbarism, more of hatred and<br />
envy and malice, than any of us could have foreseen when we were<br />
young and hopeful. We have seen great skill employed with hatred; science<br />
with envy; diplomacy with threat and blackmail; the distraction<br />
as I pkjrsonally believe, of too many skilled people from<br />
improving the lot of mankind upon earth to a tremendous<br />
competition in space, in which prestige threatens to out-match<br />
usefulness, We must recapture our desire to know more and<br />
feel more, about our fcllowmen; to have a philosophy ol living;<br />
to elevate the dignity of man, a dignity which, in our Christian<br />
concept, arises from our belief that he is made in the image of<br />
his Meker, The tasks of the educator in this century have not<br />
ended. Properly and thoughtfully considered, they are only<br />
beginning. </p>
