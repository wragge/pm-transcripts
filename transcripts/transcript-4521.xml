    <content><![CDATA[<p>EMBARGOED AGAINST RELEASE: EXPECTED AT ABOUT 5.30 p. m.<br />FOR PRESS 19 OCTOBER 1977<br />STATEMENT IN THE HOUSE: JOINT DEFENCE SPACE RESEARCH FACILITY<br />The House will recall that on 9 December 1966 the Australian and<br />United States Governments entered into an agreement regarding<br />the establishment of a Joint Defence Space Research Facility.<br />This Facility was subsequently set up at Pine Gape, outside<br />Alice Springs.<br />The 1966 Agreement was for ten years and has been terminable<br />at one year's notice by either party since 9 December 1975.<br />Failing such notice the Agreement continues in force indefinitely.<br />The present United States administration has recently asked<br />if the agreement could be extended for a further period of ten<br />years, with either party being able to give one year's notice<br />of termination after nine years from the date of extension<br />or at any time thereafter, failing which the Agreement would<br />continue indefinitely.<br />My Government has considered this matter. Having regard to<br />the importance ( acknowledged by both sides of the House)<br />of the Joint Defence Space Research Facility to the interests<br />of Australia and the United States, to the importance of the<br />cooperation of our two countries under the ANZUS Treaty, and<br />having regard to the requirements for security of tenure at<br />Pine Gap to protect substantial investments in buildings,<br />machinery, skilled manpower and effort, and the requirement<br />to support long term planning in these respects, we have<br />decided to accede to the U. S. Government's request.<br />We believe that this arrangement will be helpful to the<br />U. S. Government in planning its long term financial commitments<br />for this facility. My colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs,<br />and His Excellency, the U. S. Ambassador, have today signed notes<br />extending the 1966 Agreement for a further period of ten years.<br />I now table these notes for the information of the House. / 2</p>
<p>The House will notice that the opportunity has been taken to<br />transfer responsibility as cooperating agency for the project<br />from the specialist area of the Defence Research Projects<br />Agency to the general administration of the U. S. Department<br />of Defense.<br />-I have referred to the importance of the facility; the House<br />will know that for security reasons I cannot elucidate on this.<br />I do want to say that a sound and cooperative relationship<br />with the United States is fundamental to this Government's<br />foreign and defence policies, and that the Government, and I believe<br />the great majority of the Australian people, welcome this<br />opportunity to extend our collaboration with our American<br />friends and allies.</p>
