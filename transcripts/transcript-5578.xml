-AUSTRAL( A<br />
PRIME MIN* ISTE~ R<br />
FOR I1IDIA SUNDAY, MAY 3 1981<br />
ELECTORATE TALK<br />
With the Premiers' Conference to be held in Canberra tomorrow,<br />
the decisions announced last Thursday following the review<br />
of Commonwealth functions could not have been more timely.<br />
The review of Commonwealth functions has been mo re than a<br />
mere cost-cutting exercise. It-has demonstrated that the'<br />
Federal Government is determined to be more efficient.<br />
* The various decisions in every area of Government set the<br />
example to the States to follow our'lead in the mostsignificant<br />
and far-reaching Ministerial review ever<br />
undertaken by a Federal Government.<br />
What the Federal Government has done is not just a shift<br />
of emphasis from the bureaucracy to private enterprise, or.<br />
from the Commonwealth to the States, but proof . that smaller<br />
Government can be. achieved. These decisions reflect our.<br />
great pride and confidence in Australia. We are determined<br />
not to see Australia undermined by inefficient bureaucracyA<br />
and higher taxes as has happened in some other countries.<br />
Australia has a great future ahea ' d of it provided wq act*<br />
with commonsense and determination.<br />
One of thie most important things to realise about the decisions<br />
I announced last week is that they are part of an approach<br />
which is producing major benefits for all Australians-<br />
* these are th&amp; benefits of higher economic growth, leading<br />
to higher incomes, lower prices, more jobs and lower tax rates.<br />
Special care has been taken to protect those underprivileged<br />
and disadvantaged in the community. M4ore-limited government<br />
-is now encouraging massive job creation. Economic growth is<br />
. on the rise and that is why the review of Commonwealth functions<br />
was crucial if this trend was to be maintained, and the benefits<br />
are not to be lost simply in expanding bureaucracy.<br />
Three basic elements of Government activity have been concentrated<br />
on the size of public expenditure and tax ' ation, the size of<br />
the public service, and the extent of regulation. As a result,<br />
some 350 decisions have been made.-<br />
The Commonwealth has not only reviewed its own regulatory<br />
activities. Areas which could be easily or better done by<br />
private enterprise or the States are to be offered for sale<br />
or transferred. The States, have, if anything, even nore considerable<br />
responsibilities in these areas, and I hope that the measures<br />
that I have announced will act as a stimulus to the States to<br />
review their own extensive regulatory provisions. o / 2 </p>

One area where functions presently being conducted by the<br />
Commonwealth are being. transferred to the States is health.<br />
The Commonwealth will continue to provide substantial financial<br />
support for hospital facilities and community health services,<br />
but from now on overall funds will no longer be tied to<br />
particular purposes.<br />
State governments will have the right to decide the appropriate!.<br />
balance of health care services, the level of services andt<br />
the exte * nt to which health care has priority over the provision.<br />
of other public goods and services.<br />
Not only has the Government decided on major reductions in its<br />
own capital works area as an example of its expenditure<br />
restraint,. but it also believes that the most rigorous<br />
controls must continue to be exerted over spending by<br />
Commonwealth Departments and authorities.<br />
For instance, there will be a three per cent reduction in<br />
real terms on the current level of expenditure of<br />
administrative and operational items for the coming<br />
financial year.<br />
The re-allocation of functions between . the Commonwealth and<br />
States, between Government and private sector, together w * ith<br />
decisions in relation to the Commonwealth's own activities<br />
will result in a reduction of 10,000 to 11,000 Government<br />
employees. There will also be a 2% reduction in the number<br />
of Commonwealth Government employees in the areas subject<br />
to staff ceilings, to be effected over the next two years.<br />
To achieve a total reduction in staffing in the order of<br />
17,000 over the next two years, a very large re-deployment<br />
operation will be necessary.<br />
" Obviously, the review of Commonwealth functions has been much<br />
more than. an expenditure review; exercise. Nevettheless, the<br />
Government has regarded the review of Commonwealth functions<br />
as making an important contribution to the objective of further<br />
reining in Government spending to make room for private sector<br />
growth and pave the way for significant reduction in the<br />
burden of taxation.<br />
-The decisions taken will mean an eventual savinq in Budqet<br />
~ outlays of the order of $ 560 million. Government revenue-_<br />
will be boosted from the. sale of assets and a reduction<br />
in industry tax concessions saving $ 130 million.<br />
This Government's attitude to expenditure restraint again will<br />
be. firmly evidenced in its approach at the Premiers' Conference<br />
tomo-rro; Pand the forthcoming Loan Council Meeting, and in our<br />
determination to hold down outlays in the lnl/ 82 Budget.<br />
The decisions that have been announced from the review of<br />
Commonwealth functions will benefit all Australians. They are<br />
a significant further expression of the Government's broad strat~ egy<br />
to achieve more jobs, lower taxes, lower infl. ation, higher economic<br />
grovwth, higher wages and salaries and less centralised Government.<br />
The se decisions will strengthen Australia. They will make a significanl<br />
contribution to the important task of streamlining Government in the<br />
1980s and beyond. o 00---</p>
