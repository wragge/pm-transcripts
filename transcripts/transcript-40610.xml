    <content><![CDATA[<p>I am pleased to welcome Their Majesties King Abdullah Il Ibn Al Hussein and Queen Rania Al Abdullah of Jordan to Australia this week from 22-25 November 2016.</p>
<p>Jordan is one of Australiaâ€™s closest friends in the Middle East, and our ties date back to the Great Arab Revolt of early twentieth century.</p>
<p>This state visit, at the invitation of the Governor-General, is an opportunity to reflect on the depth of our longstanding relationship. Our countries approach regional and international issues with shared values and perspectives, which is a strong foundation for ongoing future cooperation.</p>
<p>In a significant step forward, His Majesty and I will witness the signing of a Joint Declaration on Enhanced Cooperation to elevate our bilateral cooperation. The Joint Declaration is a framework for enhanced consultation on strategic issues. It will facilitate greater economic ties and strengthen security and defence cooperation, including in the fight against Daesh/ISIL. The Declaration will also improve cooperation to provide humanitarian assistance to those affected by the conflicts in Syria and Iraq.</p>
<p>We will also enter into a Memorandum of Understanding on countering money-laundering and terrorism financing.</p>
<p>This week Their Majesties will travel to Canberra and Sydney marking their first official visit to Australia and I look forward to welcoming them.</p>
