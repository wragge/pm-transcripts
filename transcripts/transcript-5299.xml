PRESS OFFICE TRANSCRIPT WEDNESDAY, 19 MARCH, 1980<br />
PRIME MINISTER INTERVIEWED BY GEOFF MEDWELL, 5DN, ADELAIDE<br />
PHONE INTERVIEW, CANBERRA<br />
QUESTIONS NOT AUDIBLE<br />
Question Prime Minister-<br />
Yes, it has. It is quite a while.<br />
Question Prime Minister<br />
Stopped, in an arbitrary sense, is the wrong word, because<br />
we have said we will not withdraw passports. But I hope the<br />
Australian Olympic Federation and the Olympic Federations of<br />
many countries will heed the views of governments when we say<br />
that getting the message through the Soviet Government and people<br />
is important, and if teams are absent and flags are absent and<br />
countries are absent from the Moscow Olympics, that will do more<br />
to express the general abhorrence with what has been happening<br />
in Afghanistan than almost any other single act. If we want<br />
to make the world a slightly safer place we need to get that<br />
message through.<br />
Question Prime Minister-<br />
I do not think they would be allowed to attend.<br />
Question Prime Minister-<br />
Oh, the officials would stop it, yes. There was an incident<br />
of that kind once before I think, involving some black American<br />
athletes do you remember?<br />
Question / 2 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I have forgotten what Games they were at.<br />
Question Prime Minister<br />
Yes. If all Australian athletes wore quite apart from the<br />
fact that a black could be taken for Australian there could<br />
be some misconstruction-aboutt-that. But, a sign of mourning for<br />
those who have died and been killed and gassed in Afghanistan,<br />
obviously that would be one thing. But there is no way the<br />
Soviet officials, I believe, or Government, would allow that<br />
to occur.<br />
Question Prime Minister<br />
I would like it to be a year of industrial peace. But if<br />
trade unions and powerful companies are together agreed-that<br />
a small independent operator is to be denied the means of<br />
livelihood, is to be denied fuel, can we be accused of engineering<br />
the Transport Workers' Union and AMOCO into that position?<br />
Once they have taken that position, are we to do nothing about it?<br />
If anyone it is confronting, it is the Transport Workers' Union<br />
and also, in a sense, AMOCO, confronting Mr. Laidely and the<br />
people of Australia; if you like, the little people of Australia.<br />
So far as we are concerned, that just is not good enough. Whenever<br />
the Federal Government stands up against the union movement,<br />
Mr. Hawke or other people in the union movement say that we are<br />
seeking confrontation. Well in fact they are trying to ride<br />
roughshod over the people of Australia. If Governments, State<br />
or Federal, do not stand up to protect the rights of the average<br />
citizen, nobody else will.<br />
Question Prime Minister<br />
I do not know that that is right. I think that when we do not<br />
take action in a serious matter, the average person does get<br />
concerned. The average Australian is concerned about the<br />
excess and the excess use of union power. But when we do take<br />
action what you find is that some trade union leaders, or<br />
Mr. Hawke, condemn us, or some members of the Australian Labor<br />
Party condemn us. I do not think you find the condemnation<br />
comes from the average person in the street, because I think they<br />
want to see Governments stand up to the great and brutal use<br />
of union power that so often occurs.<br />
Question / 3 </p>
<p>-3-<br />
Prime Minister-<br />
Absolutely. There is no way that that judgement, I do not think<br />
there is any way that judgemeunt will be altered. for quite some<br />
time, for quite some years into the future.<br />
Question Prime Minister-<br />
If we are I would like to know about it, because I announced<br />
an intention to substantially expand the army reserve. Now, if<br />
there a particular unit or a particular area where people are<br />
being rejected I would like to know about it and I will look<br />
into the reasons for it.<br />
Question Prime Minister-<br />
You are counting people who are in the army reserve but<br />
are also unemployed. You are referring quite specifically<br />
to that category?<br />
Question Prime Minister<br />
Well, I will look at that quite directly. That has not been<br />
put to me before, and you might well have a pint that needs<br />
looking at. But if I could just make the point: the Minister<br />
for Defence has been conducting a progranures with the great<br />
support of employers over the last year or two, which are<br />
designed to encourage employers to release army reserve people<br />
for the proper and full periods of training, and to do so in<br />
a way in which they are encouraged. We do want to encourage people.<br />
Question<br />
-Prime Minister<br />
I have said we will look at that situation. That has not been<br />
put to me before. We will look at it.<br />
