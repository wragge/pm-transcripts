SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER JAPAN/ AUSTRALIA SOCIETY RECEPTION:-<br />
TOKYO 16 MAY 1986<br />
PROFESSOR SAITO, MEMBERS OF THE JAPAN-AUSTRALIA SOCIETY,<br />
DISTINGUISHED GUESTS.<br />
MEMBERS OF THE JAPAN/ AUSTRALIA SOCIETY KNOW VERY WELL THE<br />
IMPORTANCE OF THE ECONOMIC RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN OUR TWO COUNTRIES<br />
A ND THE CLOSENESS OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE AUSTRALIAN AND<br />
JAPANESE GOVERNMENTS.<br />
I HAVE DISCUSSED OUR ECONOMIC RELATIONS IN DETAIL IN AN ADDRESS<br />
EARLIER TODAY, WHAT I WANT TO EMPHASISE TO YOU THIS EVENING IS<br />
A COMMENT I MADE AT A SYMPOSIUM HELD EARLIER THIS YEAR IN MELBOURNE.<br />
I POINTED OUT THEN THAT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN OUR COUNTRIES Is<br />
NOT JUST A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN TRADERS IN THE MARKET PLACE OR<br />
BETWEEN GOVERNMENTS IN THE ARENA OF FOREIGN POLICY , IT IS ALSO<br />
A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PEOPLE, To ME, ONE OF THE MOST HEARTENING<br />
DEVELOPMENTS IN AUSTRALIA/ JAPAN RELATIONS HAS BEEN THE lIlvCREA3ING<br />
STRENGTH OF CONTACT AND UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN AUSTRALIANS AND<br />
JAIPANESE. TOURISM FROM JAPAN To AUSTRALIA PASSED THE 100,000 MARK LAST YEAR.<br />
CULTURAL EXCHANGES ARE NOW TAKING PLACE AT ALL LEVELS. A GROWING<br />
NUMBER OF AUSTRALIAN ARTISTIC GROUPS AND INDIVIDUAL ARTISTS ARE<br />
VISITING JAPAN. JAPANESE PERFORMER'S AND EXHIBITIONS ARE<br />
INCREASINGLY SOUGHT FOR CULTURAL FESTIVALS IN AUSTRALIA. THE<br />
APPRECIATION OF JAPANESE CULTURE IN AUSTRALIA HAS NOW REACHED A<br />
SOPHISTICATED LEVEL. -WHAT COULD-BE A BETTER SIGN'THAN THAT YOUTH<br />
EXCHANGE IS A GROWTH AREA? MORE AND MORE YOUNG AUSTRALIANS STUDY<br />
JAPANESE AND ONLY A FEW DAYS AGO AN AUSTRALIAN STUDIES CENTRE WAS<br />
OPENED AT NANZAN UNIVERSITY~ IN THIS COUNTRY, AUSTRALIAN STUDIES<br />
ARE TAUGHT AT TOKYO UNIVERSITY AND FIVE OTHER UNIVERSITIES IN<br />
THIS CITY,<br />
IN THESE WAYS WE ARE BUILDING WITH JAPAN THE SORT OF RELATIONSHIP<br />
WHICH SHOULD CHARACTERISE AUSTRALIAN RELATIONS WITH THE COUNTRIES<br />
OF ASIA GENERALLY, FOR THESE COUNTRIES ARE AND WILL ALWAYS BE<br />
AMONGST OUR NEAREST NEIGHBOURS. </p>
<p>-2-<br />
I WOULD LIKE TO TELL YOU THAT THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT HAS<br />
RECENTLY TAKEN A MAJOR INITIATIVE WHICH WILL GIVE VERY TANGIBLE<br />
AND PRACTICAL EXPRESSION TO OUR COMMITMENT TO BUILD MATURE,<br />
BENEFICIAL AND LONG TERM RELATIONS WITH ASIA. I AM REFERRING TO<br />
* THE GOVERNMENT'S DECISION TO ESTABLISH AN ASIAN STUDIES COUNCIL<br />
TO PROMOTE THE STRENGTHENING OF ASIAN STUDIES AT EVERY LEVEL OF<br />
THE AUSTRALIAN EDUCATION SYSTE, AND ALSO TO MEET THE NEEDS OF<br />
INDUSTRY WHICH MUST BECOME INCREASINGLY INTEGRATED WITH ECONOMIC<br />
GROWTH IN THE REGION. WHAT WE ARE SEEKING IS PRODUCTIVE INTER-,<br />
DEPENDENCE BETWEEN AUSTRALIA AND ASIA, I REPEAT THAT WHAT HAS<br />
BEEN HAPPtEING ' RrTh JAPAN TS IN MANY WAYS A MODEL FOR THIS LARGER<br />
ASPIRATION. IN FOREIGN POLICY AND INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS, AUSTRALIA AND JAPAN<br />
START FROM A SOLID BASE OF SHARED INTE-REST$ WHICH INCLUDE, BUT<br />
EXTEND WELL BEYOND, THE SECURITY AND STABILITY OF THE ASIA-PACIFIC<br />
REGION. WE ALSO HAVE A FUNDAMENTAL INTEREST IN GLOBAL SECURITY<br />
AND STABILITY IN CASE IT MIGHT BE THOUGHT THAT THAT IS RATHER<br />
ABSTRACT LET ME SAY THAT IT Io THE FOUNDATION OF THE ROLES<br />
AUSTRALIA AND JAPAN EACH TRIES TO PLAY ON CURRENT ISSUES OF GREAT<br />
MOMENT, RANGING FROM THE PRESERVATION OF AN OPEN INTERNATIONAL<br />
TRADING SYSTEM TO ENCOURAGEMENT OF PEACE AND DISARMAMENT AND THE<br />
COMBATTING OF TERRORISM.<br />
IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF OUR RELATIONS YOUR SOCIETY HAS LONG PLAYED<br />
A ROLE OF WHICH YOU CAN BE PROUD, AND BEFORE CONCLUDING,<br />
1--IPRRE SIDENT, I WANT TO THANK YOU" FOR YOUR LATEST UNDERTAKING.<br />
THE SOCIETY IS PROVIDING THE SECRETARIAT FOR THE FUND WHICH HAS<br />
BEEN ESTABLISHED TO ENABLE THE JAPANESE PRIVATE SECTOR TO CONTRIBUTE<br />
TO THE AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL BICENTENARY SCIENCE CENTRE AS PART OF<br />
JAPAN'S. PARTICIPATION IN THE AUSTRALIAN BICENTENARY IN 1988. I AM<br />
DEEPLY APPRECIATIVE OF TI-E EFFORT-THAT THE JAPANESE GOVERNMENT<br />
AND BUSINESS WORLD ARE MAKING TO COMMEMORATE THE BICENTENARY AND<br />
OF THE EFFORT OF THE SOCIETY ITSELF. I VERY MUCH HOPE THAT MANY<br />
OF YOUR MEMBERS WILL HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO VISIT US IN AUSTRALIA<br />
IN OUR BICENTENARY YEAR. </p>
