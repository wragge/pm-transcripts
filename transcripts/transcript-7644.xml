TRANSCRIPT OF DOORSTOP, SALLE VICTORIA, VILLERS-BRETONNEUX,<br />
FRANCE, 18 JUNE 1989<br />
9 &amp; 0E PROOF ONLY<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister Mr Cousteau indicated this<br />
morning that the French Government are now on board on this<br />
Idea of a Wilderness Park for Antarctica. Are you pleased<br />
with that?<br />
PM: Well that's the indication he gave'-to me. I'm certainly<br />
pleased if that's the case. I'll need to obviously have that<br />
confirmed when I see the Prime Minister and the President<br />
tomorrow but the indications are good.<br />
JOURNALIST: Are you confident you can win other support<br />
around Europe and in America?<br />
PM: The fact that we've moved from being one out to now<br />
having France and India is a very significant improvement and<br />
of course the merit of the case is overwhelming. So I hope<br />
that we will get further support. It may not be immediately<br />
forthcoming but I think as time goes on people will come to<br />
realise the responsiblity that we've all got for saving the<br />
Antarctic and the Australian proposal is really the only way<br />
of getting there.<br />
JOURNALIST: Jacques Cousteau indicated today that even the<br />
New Zealanders may not sign the Treaty.<br />
PM: Well I think that's possible but we'll wait and see<br />
about that.<br />
JOURNALIST: Can you get Jacques Cousteau to help you in your<br />
campaign against nuclear testing in the Pacific?<br />
PM: He shares our view on that and he's made his position<br />
known as have we. But I don't think there's any Immediate<br />
prospects of change there but we live in a rapidly changing<br />
world, you never know.<br />
JOURNALIST: Are you expecting any further in talks<br />
tomorrow with the French on the question of nuclear testing<br />
or do you think that it will just be a restatement of views<br />
on both sides?<br />
PM: Obviously we will state the position clearly and they<br />
will state theirs * and we're not going to change one anothers<br />
position I wouldn't think tomorrow.<br />
ends </p>
