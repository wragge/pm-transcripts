STANDARDISATION WESTElN AUSTRALIAN RAILWAYS<br />
KWINANA TO KALGOORLIE<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, the Rt. Hon. R. G. Menzies<br />
In my statement on 21st February, 1961 on economic<br />
policy I said that the Commonwealth Government had under<br />
consideration some large public works which seemed likely to<br />
contribute in a substantial way to the development of our<br />
national resources and, particularly, to the expansion of<br />
export production. It would not be possible I pointed out,<br />
for the Commonwealth to provide during 1961 largo additional<br />
amounts for these works. However, I went on to say, so that<br />
there would be no avoidable delay in having these works put<br />
in hand when circumstances permitted, lowcre prepared to do<br />
what we could to facilitate prompt detailed planning. To<br />
this end, we proposed to put ourselves into touch with the<br />
relevant State Governments at an early date.<br />
We have done this and have made good progress. Of<br />
course, much detailed planning remains to be done but<br />
practical results have already boon achieved. For example an<br />
early start is being made by the Queensland Government on the<br />
Normanton to Julia Creek Road in the beef cattle country of<br />
Queensland. Moreover, following discussions between the Commonwealth<br />
and the Western Australian Governments at both the Ministerial<br />
and official levels, it has now been agreed that the Government<br />
of Western Australia should put in hand immediately the work<br />
of surveying the route that a standard-gauge railway line from<br />
Kwinana to Kalgoorlie would follow. Although the Commonwealth<br />
still has to give further consideration to the State's proposal<br />
for the standardisation of the line, it is prepared to make<br />
available to ilestern Australia the funds required to meet the<br />
cost of this survey. The survey is, of course, essential to<br />
the planning of the project and the Commonwealth is happy to<br />
facilitate the matter in this way.<br />
