PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR PRESS9 January 1976<br />
CHOU EN-LAI<br />
It was with deep regret that I learned today of the death<br />
of the Premier of The People's Republic of China, Chou En-Lai.<br />
Premier Chou was one of the" outstandig men of his generation.<br />
As Premier of China, Chou En-Lai stood willing to discuss<br />
with candor his'country's position with visiting Government<br />
leaders, and other dignitaries. These explanations of China's<br />
role made a significant contribution to world understanding.<br />
History till remember Chou ' En-Lai as a statesman and as a<br />
major figure of this era who served his country with sacrifice<br />
and dedication over a span 6ofyears that has few parallels.<br />
On behalf of the Australian Government and people I express<br />
our sincere sympathy and condolence at the loss sustained<br />
by the people of China. 00000000oooooo000000 </p>
