I would like to thank Karl Bitar for his leadership of the organisational wing of the Australian Labor Party over the last two and a half years.</p>
<p>He has been a tireless worker for Federal Labor during that time and his efforts, calm demeanour and leadership under pressure helped us be re-elected in 2010 allowing us to deliver our plans to make Australia a stronger and fairer society.</p>
<p>Karl brought many attributes to the job including his strategic thinking and his desire to broaden Labor's interaction with its supporters and the wider community by overhauling our online capacity.</p>
<p>I thank Karl for his strong commitment, leadership and professionalism and he will be missed by the ALP.</p>
<p>On a personal note I wish him, his wife Joanna and his children all the very best for the future.  </p>
