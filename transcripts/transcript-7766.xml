PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 5 OCTOBER 1989<br />
I wish to announce details of the membership and initial<br />
work program of the Prime Minister's Science Council.<br />
The creation of the Council was one of the measures<br />
announced in the joint statement ' Science and Technology for<br />
Australia', which I and the Minister Assisting for Science<br />
and Technology, Mr Jones, released in May of this year.<br />
In that statement, Mr Jones and I said that the Council<br />
would be ' a major new national forum for consideration of<br />
science and technology issues'. The Council will meet at<br />
least twice a year to consider issues of national importance<br />
in science and technology.<br />
The membership of the Council is attached.<br />
The Council will meet for the first time on Friday 6 October<br />
in the Cabinet Room of Parliament House. There will be two<br />
principal items for discussion: global climatic change and<br />
the issues it raises for Australia, and Australia's<br />
scientific and technological resources and their<br />
utilisation. The Council will be joined for each discussion by scientists<br />
and business people familiar with these issues, some of whom<br />
have been invited to present papers to the Council. These<br />
papers will be published after the meeting.<br />
O I also wish to announce that the Coordination Committee on<br />
Science and Technology had held its first meeting under its<br />
Chairman, Professor Ralph Slatyer. The Committee, which<br />
comprises senior officials from Commonwealth departments and<br />
agencies engaged in the conduct or funding of research and<br />
development, was also created as part of the strategy for<br />
science and technology announced in the May statement. The<br />
Committee is expected to hold about four meetings a year.<br />
The Committee provides a means for departments and agencies<br />
to share information on their research activities and<br />
coordinate * their views on matters* requiring the attention of<br />
the Government.<br />
At its first meeting, the Committee held preliminary<br />
discussions on two major issues: human resources for<br />
research and development and the related question of career<br />
structures for scientists, and ways of selecting priority<br />
areas for research.<br />
The Committee will meet again in October to consider papers<br />
on both these issues and on other matters raised by members.<br />
