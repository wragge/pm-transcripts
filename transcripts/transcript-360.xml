Statement by the Prime Minister, the Rt. Hon. R. G. Menzies<br />
The Prime Minister announced today the composition of<br />
the Committee which the Government has established to inquire<br />
into the future of tertiary educetion. The Committee would be a<br />

In announcing the composition of the Committee the<br />
Prime Minister recalled that the recommendations of the Murray<br />
Committee and, more recently, those of the Australian<br />
Universities Commission had been accepted by the Commonwealth and<br />
State Governments with the result that vastly incru~ ased grants<br />
ha~ ve beon made available for universities since 1958. However,<br />
the rapidly increasing number of students who may wish to take<br />
advantage of tertiary education and other factors, such as<br />
student wastage, staff shortage and the pressure on universities<br />
generally, make it imporative that we investigate the best way of<br />
making the most efficient use of available and potential resources.<br />
The Government has decided, therefore, to establish<br />
this Committee to consider the pattern of tertiary education in<br />
relation to the needs and resources of Australia and to make<br />
recommendations to the Commission on the future development of<br />
tertiary education. The Prime Minister said that the Committee would make<br />
a wide-ranging investigation and it was hoped that it would be<br />
able to complete its work and submit its rocommend~ ations before<br />
the end of the 1961/ 63 triennium.<br />
Committees of enquiry in this field have already been<br />
created by the State Governments of New South Wales and Victoria<br />
and close association between the National and State Committees<br />
would be of the greatest value. In the United Kingdom a Committee<br />
with similar responsibilities had been established under the<br />
Chairmanship of Lord Robbins.<br />
The Prime Minister cxpressed the hope that the<br />
Committee would have the benefit of advice and co-operation from<br />
the Australian Vice-Chancellors' Committee, University staff, the<br />
Commonwealth Office of Education, State Departments of Education<br />
and other Commonwealth and State Departments and instrumentalites<br />
