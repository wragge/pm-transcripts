PRIME. MINISTER<br />
CO-ORDINATION IN WOMIEN'S AFFAIRS<br />
The Prime Minister announced today that he is<br />
proposing to establish formal machinery for the co-ordination<br />
of Federal Government activity in women' s affairs.<br />
Earlier this year he wrote to the Ministers for<br />
Aboriginal Affairs; Education; Environment, Housing and<br />
Community Development; Health; -Social ; Se-curity and the<br />
Attorney-General asking that they consider setting up units<br />
within their Departments to give proper consideration to<br />
women' s issues. More recently he has written in the same<br />
vein to the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs.<br />
Several Ministers have now followed up the Prime<br />
Minister's suggestion, in keeping with the Government' s<br />
policy that the special concerns of women equality of<br />
opportunity, freedom from discrimination, eqlual status in<br />
society should be stressed within the framework of<br />
individual policy areas.<br />
The Prime Minister pointed out that the units could<br />
be comprised of existing Departmental officers.<br />
With the generally favourable response, the Prime<br />
Minister considers it timely to initiate more formal<br />
consultations betwieen interested Departments, and is moving<br />
towards the establishment of an interdepartmental working<br />
group on women's affairs.<br />
It is expected that participating Departments and<br />
authorities will include those with well-established units as<br />
wvell as those who are now in the process of setting units up.<br />
Departments with special functions relating to women's affairs<br />
would also be inv&amp;' -yed. </p>
<p>2.<br />
I will also shortly be making a further announcement<br />
about consultations that will be proposed with a<br />
wide range of women's groups throughout Australia<br />
with the objective of establishing a Womens Advisory<br />
* Committee. 00 0o0o0o 0 </p>
