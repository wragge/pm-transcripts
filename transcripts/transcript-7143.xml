CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
INAUCURAL RAURICE BLACKBURN MEMORIAL LECTURE<br />
COBURG 28 MARCH 1987<br />
Ladies and gentlemen, friends.<br />
On 31 Narch, 1944 forty three years ago, almost to the day<br />
Maurice McCrae Blackburn died.<br />
With Blackbvrn's death, at the age of 63, the Labor movement<br />
lost one of its most articulate and tireless advocates, and<br />
the people of Australia lost one of their most dedicated<br />
representatives.<br />
Maurice Blackburn was " one of the great servants of the<br />
people of the Commonwealth of Australia".<br />
That was the judgement of the then Prime Minister, John<br />
Curtin, when he moved the Parliamentary condolence motion<br />
after Blackburn's death.<br />
It is too easy, with the passage of time and the constant<br />
rush of pressing problems, to let the achievements of our<br />
predecessors slip from mind.<br />
But we must I believe resist that easy amnesia not in<br />
order to induLge in nostalgia, which can often be<br />
self-deceiving, but to rescue from the past its hard-won<br />
lessons and to reappraise and reapply them, where we can, to<br />
the problems we face today.<br />
That is why I am happy to be here today to deliver this<br />
inaugural address in memory of Maurice Blackburn.<br />
Blackburn's political career spanned some of the most<br />
turbulent times this nation has ever experienced.<br />
It was in 1914 the first year of the First World War<br />
that Blackburn was first elected to the Victorian<br />
Parliament. When he died, after more than two decades as a<br />
member of the Victorian and Federal Parliaments, the Second<br />
World War was within a year of its conclusion. </p>
<p>These war and depression years were years which challenged<br />
the nation's economic and military security and which<br />
moulded the Perty's deepest philosophical underpinnings.<br />
That Maurice Blackburn left his stamp on the way the nation<br />
and the Party responded to these crisis years is I think a<br />
striking lesson about the influence one man can have on his<br />
times. Labor peoplo this part of Melbourne can be particularly<br />
proud of Blachburn since it was this region that he<br />
represented throughout his Parliamentary career.<br />
After his de~ ath his widow Doris, who was in her own right a<br />
formidable anid early advocate of women's rights and<br />
aboriginal advancement, was herself elected to the seat of<br />
Bourke which her husband had represented.<br />
She was only the second woman elected to the House of<br />
Representativos and of course it was as a result of her<br />
legacy that this lecture series could be established.<br />
Maurice Blackciurnls greatest contribution to Australian<br />
politics of MiG day was his intellectual contribution. He<br />
was not the hind oZ Party member who blindly followed or<br />
mutely acquicocced.<br />
He was in fact twice expelled from the Labor Party over<br />
matters of ") rinciple and after the second of these<br />
expulsions, when he was sitting as an Independent Labor<br />
member of Pairliament, he further alienated himself from the<br />
Labor Governont over Curtin's plans to introduce<br />
conscription i for military service in the South West Pacific.<br />
Curtin hissolV had been prosecuted for his anti-conscription<br />
stance during world war 1. it is a measure of the greatness<br />
of his wair-timne leadership that he came to regard<br />
Australia's atiore serious military position in 1943 as<br />
obliging him to support the introduction of conscription.<br />
Maurice Blackburn, however, refused to change tack and when<br />
it came to a vote he stood quite alone in opposing the<br />
proposal. Hence when Curtin came to move the condolence motion I have<br />
already quoted, he perhaps ruefully acknowledged of<br />
Blackburn that " however unpopular he might become, however<br />
discomforting his attitude might be to his colleagues, the<br />
divine monitor within him impelled him to stand for what in<br />
his soul he believed."<br />
But it would be wrong to imagine that this " divine monitor"<br />
forced Blackburn to spend his life in barren and solitary<br />
isolation frong the mainstream of the Party and the nation.<br />
Indeed, in 1921 Blackburn demonstrated for all time that his<br />
sense of principle was capable of being very well attuned to<br />
the mainstreanm of the Party's and the nation's opinion. </p>
<p>I refer of course to Blackburn's crucial intervention in the<br />
debate at the 1' 921 Federal Conference about how the party<br />
should express its Objective.<br />
At that Conference, the delegates had before them a proposal<br />
to express tho Objective with these now familiar words: "' the<br />
socialisation of industry, production, distribution and<br />
exchange." The debate about the Socialist objective became one of the<br />
great debates of our Party's history.<br />
Supporters of the Objective believed the Party needed an<br />
unambiguous statement of its goal to prevent it straying<br />
from a straight and narrow path.<br />
Opponents saw the word " socialisationt as too vague and<br />
likely to deter more voters than it would attract.<br />
Blackburn was prominent among those opponents, and as he<br />
always did, he summed up his position with clarity and<br />
conciseness including with this aphorism: " The Objective"<br />
he said, " must be so clearly worded that he who runs will<br />
read. But the ( proposed) objective is such that he who reado<br />
will run."<br />
Although tho Objective was voted into the platform,<br />
Blackburn rofused to give up the fight. Later in the<br />
conference 1-c returned to the issue and successfully moved<br />
the motion that has gone into history as the Blackburn<br />
Declaration. 0<br />
It is worth quoting in full:<br />
" This Conferen-ce declares:<br />
that the Australian Labor Party proposes collective<br />
ownership for thz purpose of preventing exploitation,<br />
and to whatever extent may be necessary for that<br />
purpose;<br />
b) that wheiever private ownership is a means of<br />
exploiteation it is opposed by the Party; but<br />
c) that the Party does not seek to abolish private<br />
ownershiqo even of any of the instruments of production<br />
where such instrument is utilised by its owner in a<br />
socially useful manner and without exploitation."<br />
The fact that the Declaration, as outspoken as it is by<br />
today's standards, was seen at the time as a moderating<br />
influence in the Party, underlines just how different was<br />
the party, and indeed the nation, in 1921.<br />
In the wake of5 the First World War and the Russian<br />
Revolution, no one could tell for certain how far the<br />
revolutionary spirit would spread or how many ancient<br />
regimes would topple. </p>
<p>In the Labor Party, some of the most deeply held convictions<br />
were for White Australia and blatant protectionism.<br />
So the simple nostrums of that day should not be seen as<br />
having an automatic relevance to today's Party or to today's<br />
issues. But the test of the objective should surely be whether it<br />
was relevant to the problems which faced the Australia of<br />
the 1920s. That certainly appears to have been Blackburn's<br />
test. For the duty of each generation of Labor Party members is to<br />
endeavour as best it can to make the Party relevant and<br />
responsive tc the challenges of its day.<br />
The Labor F1_! rty has been successful where it has learned<br />
that lesson -where it has learned to identify and to<br />
articulate principles of operation which are relevant and<br />
responsive to contemnporary tasks.<br />
Look at our history. Each of our post war Labor governments<br />
has had a unique challenge and each has solved it in ways<br />
which were relevant to its times. The Curtin Labor<br />
Government h~ ad to guide the nation through the crisis of<br />
war. Chifey had to build the edifice of peace-tine<br />
Australia. WThitlam had to solve the legacy of wore than two<br />
decades of conservative neglect.<br />
And today w2 face a task which is a unique challenge of our<br />
time. It is to car!: y out the most sweeping reform in our history<br />
of our nat!.: il economic institutions and attitudes.<br />
We must cope with the collapse in our commodity prices<br />
and the consequent fall in our national income now amounting<br />
to more than $ 6 billion. we need to learn to compete on<br />
world markets with new exports. we must face the<br />
imperative o-1 making our economy more flexible through the<br />
removal of unnecessary regulation. We must retain the<br />
internation;) l competitiveness we have won through freeing<br />
the dollar and we must exercise restraint in wages. And<br />
we must fully' understand and accept that the world does not<br />
owe us a li. ving.<br />
This task of economiic reconstruction has been dodged and<br />
fudged by decades of irresponsible conservative governments.<br />
Had we in thc! Labor Party followed those conservative<br />
governments Did proven ourselves unable to develop relevant<br />
and workab). i. answers to our economic problems, we would have<br />
failed both o-ur supporters and the whole nation.<br />
But this ha-: to be clearly understood. Meeting the stringent<br />
dweamy ancdosn troaf diaccotnso mouicr Lmaabnoarg empheinlt osiso phnyo. t a policy which in someI </p>
<p>Indeed in thase difficult times it is the only path<br />
available to uo which leads to the traditional Labor goals<br />
of helping the underprivileged and supporting the less<br />
well-off.<br />
Like previous Labor governments, we are commuitted not only<br />
to relevance in responding to our particular tasks, but also<br />
to compassion and redistribution in doing so.<br />
So as I said I-ecently at Bathurst in a speech to celebrate<br />
our fourth anniversary of government don't let us have any<br />
of this noflsof3e that we are not a real Labor Government.<br />
Don't judge u5 by whether we have blindly adhered to the<br />
standards o th e past or uncritically observed tho<br />
shibboletts oC the past.<br />
Judge us by o-cr ability to take our inherited principles<br />
thoce we inhorited from a great line of predecessors like<br />
Maurice Blackburn and breathe new life into then:, applying<br />
them anew to the task we face today.<br />
We have, thtough the Accord, forged anew the traditional<br />
links between the industrial and political elements of the<br />
Labor movement.<br />
we have, to tle maximum extent possible in the economic<br />
circumstance~ s, worked to help the poor and protect the<br />
battlers of the Australian community.<br />
in fact wie hiave made something of a virtue of the need to<br />
limit governint spending. Rastraint has forced uo to<br />
scrutinize our priorities so we can direct what resourceo we<br />
do have to those who need them most.<br />
This has meant, for example, applying an assets test to<br />
pensions to disqualify millionaires from drawing on the<br />
public purse. As a result we have been able to increase<br />
pensions for those who need them, by more than 6 per cent in<br />
real terms, compared with a paltry 1.5 per cent in the<br />
entire seven years our conservative predecessors spent in<br />
office. it has meant_ reforming the tax system to disqualify the<br />
wealthy fromo ripping off the system through tax-free capital<br />
gains and fringe benefits.<br />
As a result wo have been able to cut income tax rates, lift<br />
the tax free threshcld for those at the bottom of the income<br />
scale, and, ' from 1 July this year introduce a series of<br />
measures to alleviate poverty traps for pensioners and<br />
beneficiaries. It has meant exempting low income families and individuals<br />
from the medicare levy. We have ensured that needy students<br />
are not hurlt by the tertiary education administration<br />
charge. </p>
<p>6.<br />
Now this may sound less bloodstirring than the battle cry of<br />
the Socialist objective. But it is in the l980s proof of C<br />
our commitment to, and our success in achieving, effective<br />
and measured redistribution.<br />
For us, it is action rather than words which achieves real<br />
improvement in the lot of the traditional constituency of<br />
our Party.<br />
Let me briefly outline some other examples where we have put<br />
our traditional Labor commitment into action.<br />
In the knowledge that the best route to the abolition of<br />
poverty is through employment, we have created three<br />
quarters of a million new jobs in our four years in office.<br />
In the knowledge that workers who have exercised restraint<br />
in wage claimns have a right to expect restraint in prices,<br />
we have boosted the Government's efforts to put the lid on<br />
unfair price rises.<br />
In the knowledge that in many Australian families both<br />
parents need to and want to work, we have created a network<br />
of child care centres around the nation.<br />
In the knowledge that school children must gain an education<br />
if they are to find worthwhile work in the future, we have<br />
moved to ensure that more children stay at school longer.<br />
When the conservatives came to power, only 36 per cent of<br />
children wero staying on to Year 12. This year, more than<br />
per cent of them will be staying on.<br />
And in the knowledge that many Australians still have<br />
difficulty finding adequate accommodation, we have expanded<br />
our spending on public housing by 42 per cent in real terms;<br />
and we have helped nearly one-quarter of a million low<br />
income families buy their first home; and we have increasedI<br />
the number of youth and women's refugees. I<br />
In the knowledge that when the poor get sick they have least<br />
resources to afford necessary health care, we have<br />
introduced medicare and introduced a scheme to limit the<br />
pharmaceutical bills of the chronically ill.<br />
most fundamentally of all, we have pursued Labor goals<br />
through our reconstruction of the economy.<br />
We have sought to increase productivity, remove inefficient<br />
regulation, create a more competitive and diverse<br />
manufacturing base, foster an economy capable of exploring<br />
the horizons of high technology production.<br />
Economic reconstruction is not a notion plucked out of some<br />
economics textbook. I<br />
It is the only solution to the challenge we face; it is the<br />
only genuine means of securing higher living standards and<br />
increased employment for all Australians. </p>
<p>Let me explain this economic reconstruction in this way.<br />
I said earliez that the sixty-six years since the 1921<br />
Conference had seen enormous change in the Labor Party and<br />
in Australia as a whole.<br />
It is hard not L o accept that the next 66 years will see<br />
even greater change and even more shifts in the assumptions<br />
and attitudes which shape our lives.<br />
if in those next six decades Australia is unable to<br />
restructure the economy, the prosperity of what used to be<br />
called the Lucky Country will be irretrievably gone.<br />
Let me just read you the list of Australia's top ten exports<br />
today. They are: coal, wheat, wool, iron ore and<br />
concentrates, alumina, beef and veal, crude petroleum oils,<br />
refined petrol. eum products, aluminium, and gold.<br />
All of these exports are based on agriculture or mining.<br />
All but two ef them are unprocessed primary products. I-ost<br />
of them are susceptible to the dramatic slumps in world<br />
prices which we have seen recently in the commodity markets.<br />
in 66 years time, the Australian Prime Minister, whoever he<br />
or she is, miust not be leading a country so heavily<br />
dependent as vic arc today on what we can dig up or grow or<br />
shear off the oheep's back.<br />
Australia's great farms and mines will doubtless continue to<br />
be major export earners. But they m~ ust not be our sole<br />
export earnercs.<br />
We must make sure that manufactured goods and service goods<br />
and knowledg~ '. ntensive industries play a much greater part<br />
in earning our national income, and that we find and exploit<br />
new overseas m~ arkets for them.<br />
So this task of economic reconstruction lies before us as<br />
the first and principal task which my Government is pledged<br />
to fulfill not just in the lead-up to the next election<br />
but as the country enters the 1990s and beyond.<br />
There are three other elements to our Labor strategy which<br />
will guide Australia into the future.<br />
The first of these is this: we will continue to manage the<br />
economy with fairness and compassion. Where sacrifices are<br />
necessary, they wilTh-e shared fairly; where gains are made,<br />
their benefits will be passed on, with fairness, to the<br />
whole comnmuniity.<br />
The second element is this we will continue to manage the<br />
economy, and manage the task of reconstruction, with<br />
strength and </p>
<p>8.<br />
We will continue to co-operate with the union movement and<br />
with businc. sz to ensure economic stability; we will continue<br />
to support Australia's established and relevant system of<br />
centraliseE wage fixing which the conservatives are pledged<br />
to demolish'; vie will continue to protect the mainstream of<br />
Australian society from the wreckers of the New Right.<br />
The final clement of our strategy for the 1990s is this : we<br />
will continue to ensure that today's policies not only<br />
achieve goals for today but are so geared as to protect the<br />
interests of future generations of Australians.<br />
That is why we must continue to protect our unique<br />
environmental heritage. That is why we must continue to<br />
seek the bost educational and employment opportunities for<br />
our children. That is why we must continue to create a<br />
multicultural society in which all Australians have equality<br />
of opportu. Aty. That is why we must continue to seek real<br />
peace and cficctive disarmament without which all our hopes<br />
and plans car. founder.<br />
These then are our aspirations : reconstruction of the<br />
economy, fairness in the protection of livin~ g standards,<br />
stability in Government, and care for the future of our<br />
nation. I draw the ccntrast with the opposition parties. They have<br />
not of late covered themselves with glory in the area of<br />
informing tile Australian electorate about their policies.<br />
But the reckless and reactionary nature of the policies they<br />
have revealed shows us at least this much : they not only<br />
cannot provide the answers to Australia's plight, they do<br />
not even understand the problem.<br />
So, sure, ve would love to have been able to do more, and to<br />
achieve our g~ oals more rapidly.<br />
But I'm proud of what we have in fact done, in the difficult<br />
circumstances imposed on us by the collapse in our export<br />
prices and the consequent fall in our national income.<br />
Moreover I'm totally certain that our record stands in the<br />
starkest possible contrast to the conservative forces, with<br />
their spurious promises and disunited leadership and<br />
single-minded determination to restore the privileges for<br />
the well-off few in place of the shared benefits we are<br />
delivering to the whole Australian community.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen.<br />
we have many tasks still ahead of us. Many challenges lie<br />
ahead. </p>
<p>After Maurice Blackburn's death, John Curtin described him,<br />
justly, as ' a ran of strong character and of great<br />
independence of mind, direct and fair in the expression of<br />
his views and forceful in the advocacy of those things which<br />
he considered to be right and just regardless of whether or<br />
not they were popular."<br />
While the LaboL Party continues to attract to its ranks mon<br />
and women of Raurice Blackburn's calibre, we will remain<br />
strong and capable of meeting those challenges and solving<br />
those probler3o<br />
But we must not lock ourselves into the past, nor should we<br />
don the straitjacket of rigid ideology.<br />
That courso iay produce great internal debates and memorable<br />
phrases. It does not always produce answers which the Party or tho<br />
nation needs. </p>
