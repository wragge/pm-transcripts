    <content><![CDATA[<p>Australia’s Cyber Security Strategy sets out my Government’s philosophy and program for meeting the dual challenges of the digital age—advancing and protecting our interests online. We do not view our security and online freedoms as mutually exclusive. To the contrary, they reinforce each other. A secure cyberspace provides trust and confidence for individuals, business and the public sector to share ideas and information and to innovate online.</p>
<p>There is no infrastructure more important to our future prosperity than an open, free and secure Internet. The security threats we face are real and they are growing in severity and frequency. Although we make advances in cyber security so do our adversaries. </p>
<p>This Strategy addresses how we can continue to protect ourselves and be more resilient to malicious cyber activity—as individuals, businesses, governments and as a nation. </p>
<p>If we are to fully realise the social, economic and strategic benefits of being online, we must ensure the Internet continues to be governed by those who use it—not dominated by governments. Equally, however, we cannot allow cyberspace to become a lawless domain. The private sector and government sector both have vital roles to play.</p>
<p>The Strategy complements the key elements of my Government’s Economic Plan—helping the transition to a new and more diverse economy which is fuelled by innovation, the opening of new markets and more investment in Australian enterprise.</p>
<p>Cyber security is already providing unique opportunities for innovation and the sector will allow many Australian businesses to grow and prosper.</p>
<p>With the Innovation and Science Agenda and the Defence Industry Plan, this Strategy will help bring more Australian technologies to market, prepare our children for the jobs of the future by boosting science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) participation and support and create innovative Australian companies.</p>
<p>We will increase our international cooperation and influence, and foster genuine partnerships between the Australian public and private sectors.</p>
<p>The Cyber Security Strategy will deliver improved cyber security for the nation through 33 new initiatives, supported by over $230 million in Australian Government funding directly resulting in more than 100 new jobs to boost the Government’s cyber security capacity and capabilities. This investment complements the $400 million over the next decade - and roughly 800 specialist jobs -the Government has committed to improve Defence’s cyber and intelligence capabilities through the 2016 Defence White Paper.</p>
<p>We will do this though:</p>
<ul><li><strong>A national cyber partnership</strong> between government, researchers and business, including regular meetings to strengthen leadership and tackle emerging issues.</li>
<li><strong>Strong cyber defences</strong> to better detect, deter and respond to threats and anticipate risks.</li>
<li><strong>Global responsibility and influence</strong> including working with our international partners through our new Cyber Ambassador and other channels to champion a secure, open and free Internet while building regional cyber capacity to crack down on cyber criminals and shut safe havens for cybercrime.</li>
<li><strong>Growth and innovation</strong> including by helping Australian cyber security businesses to grow and prosper, nurturing our home-grown expertise to generate jobs and growth.</li>
<li><strong>A cyber smart nation</strong> by creating more Australian cyber security professionals by establishing Academic Centres of Cyber Security Excellence in universities and fostering skills throughout the education system.</li>
</ul><p>By working together we will build and strengthen a trusted online environment and unlock Australia’s digital potential.</p>
