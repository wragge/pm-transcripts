    <content><![CDATA[<p>I received this morning a personal message from President Clinton asking myÂ agreement to delay by 24 hours our meeting in Washington next Monday.Â He explained this had become necessary because of his desire to hold aÂ large-scale ceremony at the White House that day to mark the formalÂ conclusion of the agreement on Palestinian self-rule between Israel and theÂ Palestine Liberation Organisation. Other circumstances mean the PresidentÂ has no choice with the timing of the Middle East ceremony.</p>
<p>The President reassured me of the importance he attaches to our meetingÂ and the relationship with Australia, and offered to help rearrange other events in my Washington program.</p>
<p>In response, I have told the President that Australia warmly welcomes theÂ exciting and historic breakthrough which has been achieved in theÂ Middle East process. The agreement on mutual recognition between IsraelÂ and the Palestine Liberation Organisation will end 30 years of unbrokenÂ hostility. Australia congratulates the parties to the agreement and commendsÂ the consistent support the United States has given to the peace process.</p>
<p>I have assured the President that I understand perfectly the need toÂ reschedule our meeting and that I look forward to seeing him on Tuesday</p>
