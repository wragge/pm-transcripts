    <content><![CDATA[<p>PRIME MINISTER 111/ 93<br />STATEMENT BV THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HION P J KEATJNG, MP<br />MABO NEGOTIATIONS<br />I have spent most of today with Aboriginal Land Council and ATSIC representatives<br />over the Mabo issue.<br />The talks have been positive and constructive from both sides.<br />Encouraging progress was made the original 20 or more outstanding issues between<br />the Commonwealth and Aboriginal representatives have now been narrowed to three<br />or four.<br />While there has been progress, I remain concerned that two or three of the outstanding<br />matters are currently incompatible with elements of the position now emerging in the<br />useful discussions with the States.<br />On these points the Aboriginal leaders have undertaken to provide a detailed written<br />response as soon as possible.<br />-As I said yesterday, it is the Government's intention to seek passage of the<br />Commonwealth legislation before Christmas this year and to introduce the Bill this<br />month. Given the progress made ovcr the past 48 hours it is worth exploring every avenue of<br />potential settlement on these outstanding points rather than bring the negotiations to a<br />premature halt.<br />The Cabinet also met this evening and agreed on a number of details arising from<br />discussions between State and Commonwealth officials today.<br />I think it is important to note that some Aboriginal leaders who have tonight made<br />statements about the Commonwealth's position were not in any of the meetings over<br />the past 48 hours, and have not accurately reflected the const~ ructive approach of the<br />Commonwealth, nor the significant progress made.<br />CANBE'RRA 7 October, 1993 TEL 8. Oct. 93 8: 12 No. 005 P. 01/ 01</p>
