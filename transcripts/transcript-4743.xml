FOR PRESS 25 JUNE 1978<br />
ELECTORATE TALK<br />
What the Federal Government put before Premiers this week<br />
is the result of deliberate judgement of the Government as<br />
to what is necessary for continuous and sustained economic<br />
recovery in Australia.<br />
Inflation was 8.2 percent for the twelve months to March.<br />
It is now on a downward trend. It will stay on that trend.<br />
Management of the Australian economy still requires the<br />
most'rigorous expenditure control by the states as well<br />
as the Commonwealth. This control is a prerequisite to<br />
a responsible economic management and essential if we are<br />
to return to full economic health.<br />
The states know we will continue to maintain the utmost<br />
restraint on all components of our spending this coming<br />
financial year. Every state has the potential and capacity<br />
to make a contribution to recovery in Australia by following<br />
this lead.<br />
States can help us lower inflation and inflationary<br />
expectations by contributing to cutting the size of Government<br />
and the Budget deficit.<br />
, It is time to re-emphasise the strong gains we have made in<br />
the economy and not to risk going back to the mad " helter-skelter"<br />
years of Labor.<br />
My Government is going to make certain that expenditure is<br />
controlled and the creeping growth in Government is halted.<br />
We are going to do this so that private industry again has<br />
room to move forward and so that interest rates will<br />
keep coming down.<br />
I was surprised that the Premiers failed to focus in any way<br />
on the importance of low interest rates to Australia's economic<br />
recovery. A continuing reduction in interest rates would be the<br />
best possible news for every small business in Australia, for<br />
every farmer, for every homeowner.<br />
We have a clear policy of creating conditions where interest<br />
rates will fall. We will not take advice or pursue policies<br />
which reverse that trend. That downward trend has started<br />
because of our policies and it will continue. </p>
<p>-2<br />
If we had taken the advice to spend money given to us over<br />
the last two and a half years by the Premiers I have not<br />
the slightest doubt that inflation in this country would<br />
be raging again as it did in the Whitlam years.<br />
It is not only Australia's experience which draws us to that<br />
conclusion. It is the experience of country after country<br />
which has been seduced into an easy path and which has<br />
thought it can get out of its problems by re-inflating at<br />
the wrcn-; z time. That kind of approach is no way to economic<br />
recoveryv, to re-investment and to creating new jobs that<br />
will last. That kind of approach would be disastrous.<br />
Premiers have often called for cuts in taxation and cuts in<br />
interest -rates. These goals are both incompatible with their<br />
calls for i--creased government expenditure. It is our<br />
policies of restraint and reduced government spending that have<br />
allowed us to cut taxes and have interest rates and<br />
mortgage rates fall.<br />
The Australian people have twice rejected the notion that<br />
Governments can go on spending a larger proportion of gross<br />
national product year after year.<br />
Australians kn~ ow the damage that excessive government<br />
expenditure causes to small business, to farms, to investment.<br />
It is easy for governments to have big spending programmes.<br />
It is easy introduce new programmes, but that does not<br />
necessarily m2ea n they will advance Australia's cause.<br />
Spending taxpayer's money to put people on the Government<br />
payroll cannot, and will not, solve unemployment. It will,<br />
however, affectL the confidence that investors have'in<br />
Australia's economic management and it can lead to more<br />
overall unemployment as a result.<br />
Experience here and overseas has shown the utter folly of<br />
undisciplined expenditure and the unrealistic expectations<br />
that creates. As we know from the past, this inevitably<br />
means printing money which leads to high inflation and high<br />
interest rates. It is the kind of policy that hits families<br />
in all circumstances and in all walks of life. Printing<br />
money is a short way to disaster. It is not a path my<br />
Government will entertain.<br />
What will get Australia moving again is a revival in private<br />
industry, a revival in investment, and confidence in this<br />
country from within and from overseas. To maintain this<br />
confidence we are now re-establishing, we have to be certain<br />
that inflation keeps coming down. To do this, expenditure<br />
must remain under tight control.<br />
In the months ahead, the healing process now underway in the<br />
economy will be confirmed and strengthened. We are determined<br />
not to throw away what we have already gained through a<br />
relaxing in our economic management policies. ./ 3 </p>
<p>-3<br />
We have some rare opportunities in Australia because we have<br />
great natural resources. The-world will want access to those<br />
resources. They will therefore be interested in investing<br />
in Australia, in partnership with Australians.<br />
By making ourselves more attractive, by running a sterner<br />
economy, by making sure inflation comes down and therefore<br />
that interest rates come down, we will attract that investment<br />
and beable to better withstand the difficulties faced by<br />
the tr-adiing world and at the same time take advantage of<br />
whatever opport-unities may be open to us.<br />
My Goverment will not be side-tracked from firm economic<br />
management. We will not be pushed off course. Our strong<br />
stand was right for Australia. We certainly make no<br />
apology -for it. 000---</p>
