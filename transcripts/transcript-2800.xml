STRICTLY EMBARGOED UNhTIL 5 P-M EASTERN SLMIER MM,<br />
FRILDAY 26 JANUJARY 1973 NATIONAL ANTIM<br />
AUSTRALIAN DAY BROADCAST BY TH{ E PRIME MINISTER<br />
During the election camapaign, I undertook that the<br />
Labor Government would seek a new I-ational Anthem for our<br />
country. I promised that the peopl~ e of Australia would be<br />
invited to help choose the Anthem. On this Australia Day,<br />
it is appropriate that I tell You of the Government's plans<br />
for fulfilling this promise to the people.<br />
First let me explain whly my colleagues and I believe<br />
that a new National Anthem is needed. We feel it is essential<br />
that Australians have an Anthem that fittingly embodies our<br />
national aspirations and reflects our status as an independent<br />
na1, tion. We need an Anthem that uniquely identifies our country<br />
abroad, and recalls vividly to ourselves the distinctive<br />
qualities of Australian life and the character and traditions<br />
of our nation. These aims are particularly important to the<br />
Labor Government which I lead. It has been one of tile central<br />
ambitions of my administration to foster a fresh and distinctive<br />
reputation for Australia overseas, and to encourage in our<br />
domestic affairs a greater spirit of shared purpose and national<br />
unity. My Government does not believe that our present National<br />
Anthem is adequate for these purposes.<br />
It is not thle Government's int ention to impose its own<br />
choice of an Anthem on the Australian people. This is clearly<br />
something which the people must choose for themselves. A new<br />
Anthem will belong to the nation. I have therefore asked the<br />
Australian Council for the Arts to confer with Government<br />
departments and other organisations and to assume responsibility<br />
for bringing together a number of suitable compositions from<br />
which a choice can be made by the people.<br />
We propose, during a period of three months, to invite<br />
any members of the public who are interested to submit the words<br />
and music for an Anthem. We hope that prominent writers and<br />
composers will wish to collaborate in this task, and a small<br />
number of established writers and composers will be specially<br />
invited to do so. At thle end of the three months a judging<br />
panel will select several works from those submitted. These<br />
will be played on radio and television and in other ways<br />
throughout Australia. The public will then be asked, withl the<br />
help of the national media, to vote for the composition they<br />
would wish to see adopted as the new National Anthem. </p>
<p>-2-<br />
There are, as you know, several popular songs which<br />
already have some claim to being accepted as our Anthem. Many<br />
of them have a long and colourful history. An opportunity will<br />
3be given at the time of the national vote for these to be<br />
considered, and voted upon, along with the entries selected<br />
or invited by the judges. An award of $ 500 will be made for<br />
each of the works invited and for each of the compositions<br />
selected by the judging panel. The public's final choice<br />
will receive an award of S5,000.<br />
On the advice of the Australian Council for the Arts,<br />
similar arrangements will be made to select a short fanfare and<br />
a more formal composition, without words, which may be useful<br />
on o*' her public or official occasions. These works, however,<br />
will be used more rarely, and will not have the status of a<br />
NIational Anthem0 In addition, as a member nation of the<br />
Commonwealth, we will continue to use " God Save The Queen"<br />
on occasions when 11cr Majesty is present, or when it is<br />
especially important to acknowledge our links with -the Crown.<br />
The details of this scheme will shortly be announced<br />
by the Australian Council for the Arts, whose advice on this<br />
question has been of great value to the Government. I hope<br />
the scheme will result in some distinguished collaboration<br />
between our composers and poets, and some imaginative entries<br />
from members of the public. I know that all Australians will<br />
welcome an opportunity to express their personal view in a<br />
matter which concerns us all. I am aware that many people<br />
and organisations have been active in this matter, in some<br />
instances for many years, and I believe this plan will enable<br />
the results of their work to be taken into account. A new<br />
Anthem will be a symbolic expression of our national pride<br />
and dignity. It is long overdue, and I have no doubt thl-at<br />
it is fervently desired by the great majority of Australians.<br />
After 72 years of Federation, it is astonishing that we are<br />
among the very few nations in the world without an Anthem<br />
of our ownm. It, is timie we reminded ourselves and the rest<br />
of the world of what Australia stands for.<br />
