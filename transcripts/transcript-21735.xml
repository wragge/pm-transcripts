    <content><![CDATA[<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister have you spoken to Tony Blair?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes, I telephoned Mr Blair a short while ago.  I congratulated him on winning his third term. It's the first time a Labour Prime Minister in Great Britain has done that. The relations between Australia and Britain are of course more long-standing and deeper than relationships we have with any other country and I therefore look forward to working with Mr Blair closely over the time ahead.</p>
<p> My natural sympathies in British politics of course do lie with the other side, the Conservatives, and I wish them well. But I have long regarded Mr Blair's courage on the issue of Iraq as displaying strong leadership. He had to fight very strong opposition within his own ranks and the steadfastness and commitment he displayed on that issue certainly impressed me and I believe many others who shared his convictions and my convictions on the issue of Iraq. Conservatives have won a number of seats and it provides a very good base for them as a very strong opposition and alternative Government over the next four or five years.</p>
<p> JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>That makes it three in a row now the Australian, US and British Governments all returned despite significant opposition to the war, what do you read from that?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well there are a combination of reasons in each country as to why the Government was returned. It has to be said that in arguing the case of the participation of his country in the campaign in Iraq, Mr Blair had the tougher call because of strong internal opposition within his own party.</p>
<p> JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>He's lost possibly around 100 seats though - it was a massive majority to begin with though wasn't it?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I'm not here to give an analysis in political science. I congratulate him on his victory and I've spoken to him, I've wished him well and I'm very ready as the elected Prime Minister of Australia to deal in the time ahead with Mr Blair.</p>
<p> Thank you.</p>
