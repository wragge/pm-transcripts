TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING, MP<br />
INTERVIEW WITH PAUL LYNEHAM, 7.30 REPORT<br />
2 SEPTEMBER 1992<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
PL: Prime Minister, welcome again to the program.<br />
PM: Thank you Paul.<br />
PL: Dr Hewson has been talking tough about the Japanese today. He says we have<br />
opened our markets to them, yet they have not reciprocated. Do you agree with<br />
that?<br />
PM: Well they are our largest trading partner. They would have a fair point if they<br />
made that point. We run a large balance of trade surplus in our favour with them,<br />
so they are not that bad. Dr Hewson is out of step with everybody. This week he<br />
attacked the nurses, he attacked the teachers, he said if you drive down an<br />
Australian street you can pick all the houses where the renters are, he is into<br />
renters. He is Into BLIP, Toyota and Ford, the Reserve Bank, the Tax Office, the<br />
Treasury, thc Japancsc.<br />
PL: And you're into portraying him as a cold hard ideologue, a frightening figure.<br />
PM: No, no, I am just saying he is very strange. He is now saying the fcllow who drove<br />
into Parliament House came to gct me, that's how important I am. Somcthing<br />

which was violent and repugnant apparently amuses him. He is going to bury me<br />
in thc flag, he is into rentcrs, nurses..<br />
PL: What are you saying, hc is a bit odd, are you?<br />
PM: He doesn't understand the limits of the political debate, where it sensibly starts and<br />
fintishes. Hc is getting more thrill, more strident and more abusive of almost<br />
everybody is out of step but him.<br />
PL:-Well many Australians are going to think that his comments here about the<br />
Japanese nmarkets strike a chord, won't they?<br />
PM: Well would you prcfer, instead of running a large-trade surplus with them, we run<br />
a trade deficit?<br />
PL. But what about our access to their property market, for example. He says that they<br />
have come in hcrc in mining ventures, they have got banking licences, foreign<br />
exchange licenes.<br />
PM: Let's not kid ourselves Paul, no Australian developers would have been in Tokyo<br />
in the last half dozen years. They wouldn't have had the money to start in the<br />
game, and would be now very glad about the fact that they were not because of the<br />
crash in property values. Companies which can market, that take marketing<br />
strategies and take their tiruc to develop distribution systems within Japan, can get<br />
in there. And they have improved access for beef, reduced the barriers. Improved<br />
access for beef and other commodities. Now, they have always hung back. Part of<br />
our general criticism in the GATT round is-opening up markets and including in<br />
Japan. But let's understand the weight of the relationship and let's not be abusive<br />
to them like Dr Hewson is with everybody else.<br />
PL: But he says he is going to run this line a lot more up to the election. He could end<br />
up sounding like he is forging his own sort of nationalism here.<br />
PM: I am sure the Japanese will be just absolutely frigiited to death by that. They will<br />
be just trembling.<br />
PL: What, we are such small fry we shouldn't speak our mind?<br />
PM: No, no, have our say. We arc the ones who have run the structured case to gol the<br />
GATT round into place. It is the Liberal and National Parties which want us to bo<br />
closed out of Britain, closed out of Europe. They always took no for an answer.<br />
We arc the people who do not take a no for an answer. But again, running around<br />
abusing the Japanese Government in Australia, just like he abuses everybody cisc,<br />
is not going to help. </p>
<p>TEL 3<br />
PL: All right. Burke, Cain, Dowding, Hawke and now John Bannon, are we seeing<br />
more then simply a generational change of Labor leaders, or are we sccing the tide<br />
turning against Labor across Australia?<br />
pm: I don't think so. In each case the people wecaround nearly a decade. In this day<br />
and age this is a very long period to serve in the political system.<br />
PL: But you could have a situation by late next year, the Goss Guvcmment is the only<br />
Labor Government left in the country.<br />
PM: Well I don't think we will, but if there is a tide against Labor then presumably the<br />
Goss Queensland situation denies that case.<br />
Pb: You could hardly deny though, that Labor's house nationally is not in very good<br />
repair at the moment?<br />
PM: Obviously we have been in better shape in other times in Victoria arnd South<br />
Australia.<br />
PL: And after all those losses, people loosing life savings in some cases, won't some<br />
voters agree very quickly with Dr Hcwson's claim that in the end-ILabor<br />
Governments can't be trusted with rnoncy?<br />
PM: How could you say that Paul? This Government has produced for the first time<br />
ever Budget surpluses in Australia. Not one dollar was ever lost from a<br />
Commonwealth supervised bank, not a dollar of a depositor's funds. And not a<br />
dollar of depositors funds have been lost in the South Australian States Savings<br />
Bank.<br />
PL: Meanwhile, last night's Cabinet meeting pep talk suggests doesn't it, by its very<br />
nature, that the Government has run out of puff a bit?<br />
PM: No. It says we arc not going to havc distortions put across any more. This sort of<br />
technique by Dr Hewson and Mr Reith when they get asked they won't do pres<br />
conferences in Parliament House. All of us Ministers subject ourselves to<br />
questioning by the press gallery for half an hour, three quartcrs of an hour.<br />
PL: It has been a while since you have had a good sit down press conference..<br />
PM: No it has not, it was only a matter of weeks. The last time Dr Hewson had a sit<br />
down press conference in Canberra where he could be scrutinised by people that<br />
have a memory of these things was last November. He does doorstops with the<br />
fire engine chases who are covering television news, who arc not in a position to<br />
ask him follow up questions, and the stock answer is it's in Fightback. Well the<br />
answer is it's niot in FightbacX. T2ELS: ep. 92 18: 56 NO. 012 P. 03/ 08 </p>
<p>TEL: 2. Sep. 92 18: 56 NO-012 P. 04/ 08<br />

PL: Well let me ask you a follow up question. if the Government is really on the ball,<br />
bow could Bob Hogg have been urging Ministers to fill the political vacuum? I<br />
mean surely a confident robust Government doesn't leave a political vacuum?<br />
PM: Well until two weeks ago wc were putting a Budget together for six or seven<br />
weeks. It is Budget time. We were as all Governments have to, governing the<br />
place as well as represent our views and explain policy. But that phase is over and<br />
now we will be out there telling Australians that the economy is picking up, that<br />
the ' 9Ns do look good for us with a low inflation environment, that exports are<br />
going gangbusters, that basically Australia is going to be trading its way out of its<br />
troubles. And that a lot of the things which Dr Hewson is saying arc simply<br />
doomsaying things, where he is trying to beat down the exchange rate, beat down<br />
confidence and beat down the rest. We will be up there putting the right<br />
construction on things and not simply sitting in the Cabinet room putting policy<br />
changes together, as we were bound to do in the Budget process.<br />
PL: You talk of high exports, and they were In July record level I concede, but<br />
shouldn't wc-N5-Wofed about record imports so early in this recovery phase?<br />
PM: Well it depends whethcr it is a spike or whether it is a trend.<br />
PL: What do you think though?<br />
PM: Let's just take the first thing. If it is a trend it means that the recovery Is coming on<br />
much hotter and much stronger then we think.<br />
PL: Worryingly so.<br />
PM: Why would you think so?<br />
PL: I would. Record imports at this stage, the economy is still groggy.<br />
PM: No, no, no.<br />
PL: Not up off the stretcher yet,<br />
PM: No, no if imports are coming in a trend way, there's a lot more demand in the<br />
Australian economy. So all Dr Hewson's rhetoric that we're ruined, that nothing is<br />
happening, will bc dead wrong. Now if it's a spike it will wash itself out of the<br />
system, if it's just one month's aberration or two it will wash itself out of the<br />
system. The main point is that exports are as you say, at record levels by value.<br />
Given thc fact that prices for commodities are now very low again, it just implies<br />
that the volumes must be astronomic. We are going gang-busters In exports and<br />
it's exports in the end which will save the day for Australia and its trade accounts. </p>
<p>TEL: 2. Sep. 92 lb: bb No. U12<br />
FL: But look, we imported $ 560 million worth of motor cars in July, Imports in the<br />
first seven months of thiis year are up 25 per cent cars.-<br />
PM: Dr Hewson says we ought to havc a zero tariff, so how many motor cars would we<br />
have under his policy? That is, with tariffs at 35. per cent for cars and coming<br />
under Labor's 15, he wants a zero tariff which you and I know would wipe the<br />
Australian motor vehicle industry out, it would wipe the city of Adelaide, South<br />
Australia out in ternms of manufacturing.<br />
PL: But how bad docs it have to get before we start thinking about a pause in these<br />
tariff cuts? Is it totally off your agenda?<br />
PM: Hang on, you're jumping subjects here, are you worried about import volumes or<br />
tariffs?<br />
PL: rm worried about, for example, as tariffs come down on cars in come those<br />
imports.<br />
PM: If you're worried about import volumes, what I say to you is let's wait and see how<br />
the trend goes, and secondly the markets already taken a decision, In the<br />
adjustment of the exchange rate, in the face of those lower commodity prices and<br />
higher import volumes. A large adjustment has already taken place in the<br />
-exchange rate which will make imports dearer, exports cheaper.<br />
PL: All of our Asian neighbours though have tariffs, quotas or in some cases closed<br />
doors to protect their local industries. How come it's good for them and bad for us<br />
this idea?<br />
PM: What we have done is to take tariffs down in a measured, structured careful way<br />
from 1988 to 1997 in a phase down and the result is, the proof of the pudding is in<br />
the eating, we are exporting our heads off. The competitiveness in Australia has<br />
risen, the efficiency of companies has risen, but there's got to be levels, end points<br />
where an industry may survive. In the car industry, we've said when those tariffs<br />
travel to 15 per cent, thcn at that point we don't believe that given the low volumes<br />
of the Australian market and a glut of cars in the Northern hemisphere that<br />
marginally priced imported cars, we believe it will simply wipe our industry out.<br />
PL: How do you know 15 per cent is right though? Maybe that's too low.<br />
PM: They are judgements which are made by John Button, me and others in 1991 and<br />
1988 when we spoke to the car companies, when we tried to get the right.<br />
PL: Does that necessarily mean they are right, these judgements?<br />
PM: I think they are, Governments have got to make these decisions. Blut the notion<br />
that it ought to be zero, that basically the economy, the country only bc-longs to </p>

economic athletes, this is the sort of Hewson view, that you sort of socially<br />
impoverish the place and you wipe industry out and what riscs from thc ashes is<br />
athletic and strident and able to survive. He's been told and Mr Mc~ achlan has<br />
been told by ' I'oyota, Ford, General Motors zero tariffs no motor industry. Yet<br />
the city of Adelaide and the city of Melbourne would suffer enormously under his<br />
policy which Mr Mc~ aehlan just reaffirmed last week. They arc serious about it,<br />
they would in office take the tariff to zero and decimate the Australian motor<br />
vehicle industry.<br />
PU But what if even at 15 per ccnt our industry looked like it was getting swamped,<br />
would you act then as Primnc Minister?<br />
PM: I don't think it will.<br />
PL: If they couldn't cut the mustard, to use a phrase you're fond of.<br />
PM: Thc answer is I don't think that will happen because one's got to make a judgement<br />
about whether Australians gct lower priced cars or whether The difference<br />
between us and the Coalition, we've said we shall have a motor industry, we<br />
believe we can't leave car demands of Australia to be satisfied by imports.<br />
PL: That would blow out the current account if we did wouldn't it?<br />
PM: Exactly and thc world car makers would charge what the market would bear.<br />
We're saying there should be an Australian motor vehicle. Hewson and<br />
Mcb-chlan are saying look it's a matter for them, if they can exist fine, if they can't<br />
bad luck.<br />
PL: Did you notice the State Bank of NSW has put up its three year loan rate a quartcr<br />
of a per cent, longer term rates, wholesale rates soon to be locked in there now<br />
about a point and a half up?<br />
PM: I saw that ycs, that's for three year fixed. But on the short end nothing has<br />
changed. That is, the variable rate mortgages, nothing has changed.<br />
P'L: And nothing will change?<br />
PM: The Government is not going to be tightening policy.<br />
PL: What happens if the current account does blow out though between now and the<br />
election? That's your big nightmare isn't it?<br />
PM: The current account is half of what it was three or four years ago, it came in way<br />
undcr the Budget target for last year, we got a spike in imports. I know you are<br />
trying to go potty about it but let's wait and sec whcther it's a spike or it's a trend.<br />
As long as those export volumes stay there but again, I remind you the market </p>
<p>TEL 7<br />
has already comprehended all this and made a quite substantial adjustment on the<br />
exchange rate.<br />
PL: And where do you come down in the middle of this slanging match now between<br />
Gough Whitlam and Bob H-awke?<br />
FM: I'm basically not an " AM" listener so I didn't hear it all, any of it in fact.<br />
PL: Just to bring you up to date the story so far Whitlamn, says H-awke was a Prime<br />
Minister with no purpose and no policies other than the Accord.<br />
PM: That's for them, they are big enough to look after themselves and they will.<br />
PU But it doesn't say much about you, you were the lieutenant there for all those years.<br />
PM: That's right, I can look after myself.<br />
PL: I mean only a few years ago you described the Whitlam years as a period of<br />
failure, notable mainly for doling out funds in an economic collapse.<br />
PM: I also said of Gough Whitlani and his Government, that he put the Labor Party<br />
back together and made it relevant again and he did. After nearly a quarter of a<br />
century out of office he put it back together. And it was that period, even though<br />
there was Some confusion of means and ends in his period of office, the fact that<br />
Labor was relevant again gave us a chance in the<br />
PL: Do you agrce with John Hewson that this is going to be thc most important and<br />
clear cut choice type campaign since the War?<br />
PM: I do, because basically what Labor developed in Australia is an open market<br />
economy and efficient economy with a nice social policy wraplied around it. Thlat<br />
is, all the social balances, access to education, access to health, support for women,<br />
women's policies, aged care, child care, occupational superannuation. What he's<br />
saying let's turn hack a century of social advances, industrial advances, let's have a<br />
policy of social impoverishment and the economic phoenixes, the self made<br />
peoplc will rise from the ashes.<br />
PL: He is saying this hasn't worked, you've got to change the whole game, that's what<br />
he's saying.<br />
PM: A whole bunch of little Hcwsons will rise from the ashes. He sees himself as some<br />
sort of economic athlete. That's why he attacks large businesses, he thinks they are<br />
not legitimate. If you haven't owned a restaurant and been an out-rider to a<br />
merchant bank, you're illegitimate. If you happen to run the bilggest company in<br />
the country and it makes steel or you make cars, you're a fat bloated bureaucracy<br />
and you're illegitimnate. If you haven't made it yourself you're illegitimate. That's<br />

the hard-hearted view, harder than the Thatcherite views of the ' 70s. So yes, there<br />
will be a choice between a party which is the Govcernt, which has had to, for<br />
the frst time a Labor government, give Australia a true open market economy,<br />
that's had both the pride and the pleasure of stitching together one of the best<br />
social policies in the world. And we're about keeping it; Medicare, support for the<br />
aged, pensioners, child care, aged care, the rest, and not taking the view that<br />
survival of the fittest and devil take the hind most and if we havc a whole lot of<br />
little economic athletes bouncing through there, self made people, well that's<br />
Nirvana. It's not Nirvana, and that's the choice Australians will have.<br />
PL: Is it going to be a dirty campaign do you think, personal?<br />
PM: Not from me, but almost every remark Dr Hewson makes about mc is personal.<br />
PL: But you call him Gordon Gecko and all that sort of stuff.<br />
PM: No, but that's a mild blandishment on the scene. He'll say almost every day this<br />
man will lie, deceive, do anything, it's all that vicious stuff. Well let people judge<br />
him, if he wants to participate in that sort of campaign, that sort of debate, fine. In<br />
the last month we've just set up a new vocational education system, In the last<br />
month..<br />
PL; So you're the gentle good guy are you Mr soft touch?<br />
PM: In policy I am, certainly and in the debate. But he won't be having a free ride in<br />
the debate, I won't be that gentle. But I don't need to get down to the level he's at<br />
to articulate my policies or speak with pride of the policies of this Government or<br />
its achicvcmcnts.<br />
PL. Prime Minister, thanks for your tim~ e.<br />
PM: Good Paul.<br />
