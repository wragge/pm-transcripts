<p> PEDDLESDEN</p>
<p> And time to introduce my special guest. Good morning,</p>
<p> Prime Minister John Howard from his Sydney office. Prime Minister good</p>
<p> morning.</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER</p>
<p> Good morning Ross, very nice to be with you and your</p>
<p> listeners.</p>
<p> PEDDLESDEN</p>
<p> And it's our pleasure and we've got plenty</p>
<p> of questions so I should get straight into them. We've heard this</p>
<p> morning on the ABC program ÂAM' the story of the Becker family,</p>
<p> the Kosovo refugees going back to basically nothing, three days in a transit</p>
<p> camp and a burnt out home. Some in Tasmania will feel that the government's</p>
<p> been unsubtle and pre-emptive in dealing with the Kosovo refugees sending</p>
<p> families back to basically nothing. What is your response to that?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER</p>
<p> Well, my response is to say that I understand why people</p>
<p> might think that but I ask them to remember the circumstances in which</p>
<p> the Kosovars came here last year. They came here as a safe haven when</p>
<p> their lives were at risk, when there were no NATO forces in Kosovo, when</p>
<p> they had been driven out of their homeland by the Serbian forces. Now</p>
<p> however unhappy they may be with their lot back in Kosovo an enormous</p>
<p> amount of that has changed. There are now tens of thousands of NATO forces</p>
<p> in Kosovo. There has been a complete change in the security situation</p>
<p> and I ask people to remember that they were invited here and Australia</p>
<p> responded far more generously than most other countries given that we're</p>
<p> a long way from Kosovo and we're not a European country and we had</p>
<p> no direct stake in the conflict. We did respond none the less very generously.</p>
<p> And I ask people to remember that they came here on a certain basis, we</p>
<p> fulfilled our end of the bargain. If we had decided on an adhoc basis</p>
<p> to allow all who wanted to stay beyond the safe haven period to stay then</p>
<p> we would have been putting them ahead of others who've been patiently</p>
<p> waiting in the queue, whose humanitarian claims on a place in our refugee</p>
<p> program are as great if not greater than some of the Kosovars. You've</p>
<p> got to remember that there are people whose lives are at daily risk around</p>
<p> the world and we have to take those people into account. Well now it's</p>
<p> never easy and I can understand why in individual circumstances people</p>
<p> say oh gee why can't they stay but you have to take into account</p>
<p> the impact on the program.</p>
<p> PEDDLESDEN</p>
<p> And of course you've got an individual circumstance</p>
<p> of one lone young man, 19 year old, Akeif Ludvia who's on the run</p>
<p> in Hobart because he's got nobody in Kosovo and he's basically</p>
<p> saying he'll only go back to Kosovo in a coffin. I mean that's</p>
<p> extreme but that's the way he feels. He's been apparently tortured</p>
<p> while he was there. In that circumstance, that sort of circumstance, can't</p>
<p> you simply make an individual exemption?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> Well there are lots of people who claim individual exemptions</p>
<p> Ross and once you make one exception you have to make a whole lot of others</p>
<p> and I repeat, the circumstances in Kosovo even though they're far</p>
<p> from ideal and they're not the sort of circumstances that anybody</p>
<p> is happy with they are infinitely better, more secure, more protected</p>
<p> than what they were when we first took the refugees and that is the valid</p>
<p> comparison.</p>
<p>  There are desperate situations all around the world and</p>
<p> there are competing claims on the available places in Australia's</p>
<p> humanitarian program and we have to make judgements. And it's very</p>
<p> easy to just look at it in isolation but a government doesn't have</p>
<p> that luxury. We have to ask ourselves well if we make an exception in</p>
<p> relation to this person then somebody else who can claim equally desperate</p>
<p> circumstances but at the moment is kept out say, what about me?</p>
<p> PEDDLESDEN</p>
<p> On another issue, the Tasmanian government is absolutely</p>
<p> adamant that it will retain its state ban on imported salmon. You've</p>
<p> been critical of that. Will you take the Tasmanian government to the High</p>
<p> Court in order to protect Australia's status with the WTO?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER</p>
<p> Well the thing that I'm most concerned about is</p>
<p> the overall trade interests of Australia and the difficulty that we as</p>
<p> Australians face is that if we don't take appropriate notice of the</p>
<p> World Trade Organisation position we risk a ban being placed on our exports</p>
<p> into other countries.</p>
<p> PEDDLESDEN</p>
<p> So to pre-empt that will you take Tasmania to the High</p>
<p> Court?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER</p>
<p> Look please let me finish. That is our position. We are</p>
<p> concerned about preserving Australia's international trade and I</p>
<p> would say to your listeners that we have more to lose than we have to</p>
<p> gain by ignoring the World Trade Organisation on this issue because the</p>
<p> rules of that organisation which we didn't write were really forced</p>
<p> upon countries like Australia by the larger trading groups, they're</p>
<p> not particularly benign towards Australia but I have to deal with the</p>
<p> reality. All parts of Australia export a great deal to countries like</p>
<p> Canada and if we don't take some notice of the World Trade Organisation's</p>
<p> position then we will end up suffering more than we will by taking notice</p>
<p> of what they've got to say. I mean we, Tasmania potentially could</p>
<p> lose exports if the attitude of the Tasmanian government on this issue</p>
<p> prevails. Tasmania will be worse off if the attitude of the Tasmanian</p>
<p> government prevails. That is the point that I don't think Mr Bacon</p>
<p> and others, they just focus on one issue, they forget that Tasmania exports</p>
<p> things other than... I mean there's more in it than just salmon</p>
<p> there are other exports as well.</p>
<p> PEDDLESDEN</p>
<p> So in practical terms what will you do?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER</p>
<p> Well in practical terms I like to keep discussing these</p>
<p> things with state governments and not get drawn into provocative declarations.</p>
<p> PEDDLESDEN</p>
<p> In practical terms let's talk about Bass Link. There</p>
<p> are very practical plans now being drawn up for Bass link. They include</p>
<p> above ground pylons in south Gippsland which the proponents say are essential</p>
<p> to the viability of the project. One of your ministers has had a very</p>
<p> vocal campaign against those pylons in a situation where you promised</p>
<p> to expedite the project. Where do stand on it?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER</p>
<p> Well the government supports Bass Link.</p>
<p> PEDDLESDEN</p>
<p> Including the above ground pylons which the proponents</p>
<p> say are vital.</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER</p>
<p> Well whatever is needed we support.</p>
<p> PEDDLESDEN</p>
<p> So you're prepared to go against the campaign by</p>
<p> one of your ministers?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER</p>
<p> Oh look...</p>
<p> PEDDLESDEN</p>
<p> Well he has been very vocal.</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER</p>
<p> I know, well look I've given you the indication</p>
<p> of the government's position OK.</p>
<p> PEDDLESDEN</p>
<p> OK another resource issue is the gas pipeline which the</p>
<p> government will be making an announcement about today from the Bass Strait</p>
<p> basin to Tasmania will you also expedite that project?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER</p>
<p> Well I'll wait and see what the Tasmanian government's</p>
<p> got to say. I'm not... I mean...</p>
<p> PEDDLESDEN</p>
<p> I mean in principle are you supporting those sort of</p>
<p> things? It is regarded as vital for Tasmania.</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER</p>
<p> Well we have been through a whole range of programs incredibly</p>
<p> supportive of Tasmania. I mean Tasmania has done better out of the sale</p>
<p> of the first two sections of Telstra than any other part of Australia.</p>
<p> I'm regularly told that by other state premiers as recently as the</p>
<p> Liberal Party Convention at the weekend. I mean if Mr Bacon and all those</p>
<p> Labor members from Tasmania who sit in the federal parliament really care</p>
<p> about the future of Tasmania they would be whole heartedly in support</p>
<p> of the sale of the rest of Telstra because Tasmania's done extremely</p>
<p> well out of the sale of the first two bits of Telstra.</p>
<p> PEDDLESDEN</p>
<p> All right that's something we'll come back</p>
<p> too. But let's go to calls. And our number is 1300 36 1688. If you</p>
<p> can't get through keep trying because we'll try to get through</p>
<p> calls as quickly as we can. And Peter is first. Good morning Peter.</p>
<p> CALLER</p>
<p> Good morning.</p>
<p> PEDDLESDEN</p>
<p> Yes go ahead.</p>
<p> CALLER</p>
<p> Ah, Mr Prime Minister you have introduced a plan to help</p>
<p> families more. I think the first thing that should be the first cab off</p>
<p> the rank is the Family Court, it is destroying families. Prominent solicitors</p>
<p> make huge profits out of it. It is generally anti-man and they're</p>
<p> making laws, which are often against the constitution and against international</p>
<p> law. Now this is because one man plays God and often there is an attempt</p>
<p> to force bankruptcy by back door means. This has happened in my case.</p>
<p> The system needs to be scrapped. Solicitors need to be put out of it.</p>
<p> Let them do the property conveyancing they make plenty of money out of</p>
<p> that. Do it by tribunal so you don't get one man playing God and</p>
<p> the Judge sitting in as an advisory... in an advisory capacity. Now</p>
<p> when are you going to do something about this. Stop fooling around with</p>
<p> minor issues and get onto the major one or is everyone in parliament too</p>
<p> frightened to prod the sacred cow.</p>
<p> PEDDLESDEN</p>
<p> Thank you Peter. Prime Minister?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER</p>
<p> Well I understand there's a lot of unhappiness with</p>
<p> the Family Court. I would offer the view, Peter I think it is that no</p>
<p> matter what system you have because marriage break down involves very</p>
<p> strong human emotions on both sides you're going to have people unhappy</p>
<p> with the system.. For your information when the family law act was first</p>
<p> put through parliament, it was just after I came into parliament and we</p>
<p> had a free vote on it and it wasn't just Labor against Liberal it</p>
<p> was a mixture of Labor and Liberal people supporting the new family law</p>
<p> act and a mixture of predominantly Liberals and Country Party people and</p>
<p> some Labor people opposing it. I was one of the people that opposed the</p>
<p> thrust of the family law act, I still think there were errors contained</p>
<p> in that legislation. You ask me whether we're going to change it.</p>
<p> We normally deal with these things on a free vote issue. I don't</p>
<p> think it's simply a question of replacing one system with another</p>
<p> and imagining that you're going to abolish human unhappiness with</p>
<p> family law procedures when you have a breakdown of a formerly loving relationship</p>
<p> and you have personal emotions involved people lose reason and you do</p>
<p> have very unhappy outcomes. I sympathise with you but I don't think</p>
<p> there's an easy way out of it by just changing the way you deal with</p>
<p> it.</p>
<p> PEDDLESDEN</p>
<p> Thank you Peter. Tony's next.</p>
<p> CALLER</p>
<p> Oh good morning Mr Howard.</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER</p>
<p> Yes Tony.</p>
<p> CALLER</p>
<p> You'll probably get a lot of agro here this morning</p>
<p> but I can tell you there are a lot of people out here who've been</p>
<p> applauding your team, you've done a wonderful job since you came</p>
<p> into government.</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER</p>
<p> Well Tony that's very nice to hear that, it's</p>
<p> really nice indeed.</p>
<p> PEDDLESDEN</p>
<p> Did you have another issue to talk about Tony.</p>
<p> CALLER</p>
<p> Well I was thinking in terms of such things as the gun</p>
<p> laws and Timor, funding to Tasmania, industrial relations and tax reform</p>
<p> and even what's been brought up today, the Kosovars. I think we've</p>
<p> done the right thing. They made an agreement and our people, Mr Ruddock</p>
<p> have been firm and fair.</p>
<p> PEDDLESDEN</p>
<p> All right Tony thanks very much.</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER</p>
<p> Can I just pick up one thing that Tony mentioned and</p>
<p> that's industrial relations. This is an area where I think the government's</p>
<p> reforms have been very beneficial. I mean apart from anything else unemployment</p>
<p> has gone down. Tasmania on a trend basis has the lowest unemployment now</p>
<p> for ten years. We've generated throughout the country 660,000 more</p>
<p> jobs. I noticed this morning in the press that Mr Beazley has announced</p>
<p> that if he becomes Prime Minister he's going to abolish individual</p>
<p> contracts. Now that represents a weak capitulation to the influence of</p>
<p> the union movement on the Labor Party. We now live in a society where</p>
<p> approximately 20% only of workers employed by private companies in the</p>
<p> private sector belong to a union yet effectively Mr Beazley wants to hand</p>
<p> 100% of the industrial relations power under a Labor government back to</p>
<p> the unions. Individual contracts are an important choice now available</p>
<p> to Australian workers and after a big battle inside the Labor party the</p>
<p> unions have won, Mr Beazley has been rolled, the attitude of people like</p>
<p> Simon Crean the former president of the ACTU has triumphed and this will</p>
<p> be a very important issue for the Australian people to contemplate over</p>
<p> the next eighteen months. I mean when the Australian people are turning</p>
<p> their backs on unions Mr Beazley is wrapping his arms around them. I mean</p>
<p> it doesn't make sense.</p>
<p> PEDDLESDEN</p>
<p> Let's move onto another Tony, this time in [inaudible].</p>
<p> Hello Tony.</p>
<p> CALLER</p>
<p> Hi Ross, hello Mr Howard.</p>
<p> PEDDLESDEN</p>
<p> Hello.</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER</p>
<p> Ah Tony.</p>
<p> CALLER</p>
<p> About four years ago Mr Howard you made a speech where</p>
<p> you said you know there was more room for free speech in Australia and</p>
<p> less political correctness and I agreed with that entirely but soon after</p>
<p> that you denied, you and your government denied David Irving and Gerry</p>
<p> Adams access to this country on the grounds that they were allegedly of</p>
<p> bad character. I think not too long ago when Mr Adams visited here you</p>
<p> refused to meet with him and yet we've heard in the media about how</p>
<p> you're willing to meet with Yassar Arafat who has been one of the</p>
<p> masterminds behind the PLO and their atrocities including the cowardly</p>
<p> massacre of Israeli athletes and coaches at the Munich Olympics. I'm</p>
<p> just wondering if there's a logical argument.</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER</p>
<p> Well I think there is a logic in that. We did deny Irving</p>
<p> a visa for character reasons and that position continues. Adams did come,</p>
<p> I didn't see him. The reason I didn't see him was a personal</p>
<p> decision on my part, I took the view and I think it's been vindicated</p>
<p> by subsequent events that the peace process had not moved far enough in</p>
<p> Northern Ireland to... and certainly his role in it had not been sufficiently</p>
<p> positive to justify my seeing him.</p>
<p>  I have a great admiration for two figures of the Northern</p>
<p> Irish peace movement, the Catholic leader John Hume and the Unionist Leader</p>
<p> David Trimbull. They were the joint recipients of the Nobel Peace Prize</p>
<p> and I think they've contributed an enormous amount to the peace process</p>
<p> in Northern Ireland and I hope and pray like most Australians that we'll</p>
<p> finally have a positive outcome.</p>
<p>  But on the subject of Arafat a few years ago I wouldn't</p>
<p> have met him but times have moved on.</p>
<p> PEDDLESDEN</p>
<p> He is now a head of state of...</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER</p>
<p> Well no he's not quite a head of state, he enjoys</p>
<p> the status as the leader of the Palestinians and they're not an independent</p>
<p> state yet but he talks with the Israeli government on a regular basis.</p>
<p> And the gentleman who asked the question reminded me of the slaughter</p>
<p> of the Israeli athletes at the Munich Games and I remember that tragic</p>
<p> event very well. But I'd also point out to you that I have been encouraged</p>
<p> by local Jewish leaders in Australia to see Arafat and when I announced</p>
<p> on Melbourne radio that I was going to see him during my visit to Israel,</p>
<p> and that was queried by the interviewer, later on the same program two</p>
<p> leaders of the Jewish community in Melbourne went on that programme and</p>
<p> defended my decision and said it was entirely appropriate that I should</p>
<p> go to Garza and see Arafat because there is now a welcome improvement</p>
<p> in the peace process in the middle east. But the Israeli Prime Minister</p>
<p> and Arafat have met on a number of occasions and there is a recognition</p>
<p> in Israel of his role so there's quite a logic. I understand the</p>
<p> question and I am grateful for the opportunity to explain my position</p>
<p> because there is a lot of logic in the attitude I've adopted on all</p>
<p> of these issues.</p>
<p> PEDDLESDEN:</p>
<p> All right, lets move on to yet another different issue</p>
<p> from Josephine. Hello Josephine.</p>
<p> CALLER:</p>
<p> Good morning. Prime Minister I would like to ask you</p>
<p> about Collins Class Submarines. First of all, how did we get into such</p>
<p> a mess with it? And secondly do you think the time has come for Australia</p>
<p> to switch to nuclear powered submarines?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> Well the Collins Class Submarine project was first established</p>
<p> back in 1987, when I think Mr Beazley, the current Opposition Leader was</p>
<p> the Defence Minister and we've had a lot of difficulty with that</p>
<p> project, and a lot of people argue that the concept was too ambitious</p>
<p> to start with but as a nation, as a result of that decision we've</p>
<p> sunk billions of dollars into the project and the Government wants it</p>
<p> to work for the benefit of the country and for the benefit of our Defence.</p>
<p> And we are embarked upon a process of getting control of the project to</p>
<p> ensuring that they are bought up to operational readiness and that they</p>
<p> can make a very significant contribution to our defence efforts. It's</p>
<p> very important that in the sort of strategic arc above Australia, we have</p>
<p> a capability of this... of some kind and the decision was made some</p>
<p> years ago. And you can understand with these big defence projects that</p>
<p> once you make a decision if you want to change it it's like trying</p>
<p> to turn around an ocean liner ten times the size of the Titanic.</p>
<p> PEDDLESDEN</p>
<p> So have there been times when you wish you'd never</p>
<p> heard of the Collins Class Submarine?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> Oh well look it's been a very, very tragic, I mean</p>
<p> there's been a litany of errors and difficulties yes and the government</p>
<p> is very unhappy with the way the project has gone. But I am interested</p>
<p> in the now and the future as well as in the past. I mean it's a very</p>
<p> interesting debate as to whether the original decision should have been</p>
<p> taken but that was not taken by this government it was not... it was</p>
<p> taken 13 years ago when Mr Beazley was Defence Minister.</p>
<p> PEDDLESDEN:</p>
<p> Lets move on to Jim in Alderston. Hello Jim.</p>
<p> CALLER:</p>
<p> Oh good morning Ross. Good Morning Prime Minister. My</p>
<p> question is on the GST [inaudible] in to place by Morgan and Banks, about</p>
<p> four thousand people. How many of these people who have been employed</p>
<p> that are over 50? Why have accountants, tax officials and businesses been</p>
<p> overlooked in the over 50 bracket? And is it not true that many of the</p>
<p> people employed are under 30-35, have only got bank or commercial experience</p>
<p> and no legal or accounting qualifications?</p>
<p> PEDDLESDEN:</p>
<p> OK Jim... Prime Minister?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> You're talking about the people employed by the</p>
<p> ATO aren't you? I thought you said Morgan and Banks?</p>
<p> PEDDLESDEN:</p>
<p> Yes I thought I heard that as well.</p>
<p> CALLER:</p>
<p> Morgan and Banks were the agency they used to employ</p>
<p> them through.</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> Who the Australian Tax Office?</p>
<p> CALLER:</p>
<p> Yes.</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> Well look I am not sure that your figures are correct.</p>
<p> I'm not saying they're wrong. I don't have the details</p>
<p> of the age profile. We certainly don't have any policy I can assure</p>
<p> you, promise you of discriminating against people over 50, certainly not.</p>
<p> People over 50 have an enormous amount of experience to contribute that</p>
<p> people under 30 and 35 can never remotely have. So let me assure you there</p>
<p> is no policy of doing that. As to the details of the age profile, I don't</p>
<p> know without asking the tax office about that because the tax office is</p>
<p> an independent unit of the government and we don't monitor their</p>
<p> day to day decisions on employment practises.</p>
<p> PEDDLESDEN:</p>
<p> It is though a reminder of the situation which you do</p>
<p> face. You've spoken to your backbench about the difficulties leading</p>
<p> up to the 1st of July and presumably after. The whole idea of the GST</p>
<p> was that you had a simpler and easier to administer tax system. Since</p>
<p> you compromised with the Democrats, there've been a range of amendments,</p>
<p> there've been tax rulings and apparently that process is likely to</p>
<p> continue. What happened to your simpler system?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> Well, there's nothing inconsistent with having a</p>
<p> simpler system and the introduction of it being a major exercise. I mean</p>
<p> it's what happens after it, years ahead, months ahead that will determine</p>
<p> whether it's a simpler system.</p>
<p> REPORTER:</p>
<p> And years ahead, months ahead will you still be having</p>
<p> rulings as to you know whether cooked food is under it...</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> I don't think you'll be having it years ahead.</p>
<p> No, the point I make is, look it could have been simpler still if the</p>
<p> Senate had not rejected what the people voted for. It wasn't only</p>
<p> the Democrats, I mean the Labor Party voted against every single thing</p>
<p> that the Australian people had voted for in relation to the GST, yet they</p>
<p> are going to keep it. I mean this is sort of the great fraud of their</p>
<p> position, they're saying it is terrible, and it's shocking and</p>
<p> it's confusing and yet they are going to keep it.</p>
<p> REPORTER:</p>
<p> Well they said this morning they will roll it back subject</p>
<p> to the situation of the budget, which Simon Crean says, is precarious.</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
