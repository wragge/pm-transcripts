P. M. 11/ 1959<br />
MEETING OF COMMONWEALTH AND STATE OFFICIALS<br />
ON OVERSEAS INVESTMENT.<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister.<br />
The Prime Minister announced today that a meeting of<br />
Commonwealth and State officials would be held in Canberra<br />
next Monday ( 6th April) to discuss action being taken in<br />
Australia and abroad by the Commonwealth and State Governments<br />
to attract private investment from overseas.<br />
Last September Mr. Menzies announced that the Commonwealth<br />
would review, co-ordinate and, where necessary, improve the<br />
facilities and information provided through its overseas<br />
agencies to prospective investors.<br />
" We recognise that Commonwealth activity in this field<br />
should be developed in co-operation with the investment<br />
promotion activities of the States and private business<br />
interests," Mr. Menzies said today.<br />
" The meeting next week will discuss ways of arranging<br />
continuing co-operation between the Commonwealth and the<br />
States."<br />
CANBERRA A. C. T.<br />
