    <content><![CDATA[<p>LYNEHAM:</p>
<p>Prime Minister welcome again to Nightline.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Pleasure Paul</p>
<p>LYNEHAM:</p>
<p>How optimistic are you tonight that Australian troops will not</p>
<p>   have to see action in Iraq?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>More so than last night. We have to wait and see what is in that</p>
<p>   document. We also have to put the commitment to that document to</p>
<p>   a proper field test. But I am obviously feeling happier tonight</p>
<p>   than I was last night. But it is to early to say that we have really</p>
<p>   got a deal.</p>
<p>LYNEHAM:</p>
<p>UN Secretary General, Kofi Annan is certainly very enthusiastic</p>
<p>   and very publicly so?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes he is.</p>
<p>LYNEHAM:</p>
<p>It is an old hand?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes, but old hands have tripped up before, but I hope that is not</p>
<p>   the case. I hope that his ebullience in public is fully justified.</p>
<p>   But I have not seen the fine print, nor at this moment have the</p>
<p>   Americans, and until it has been examined and everybody is satisfied</p>
<p>   that it will be delivered in practice you can't really start</p>
<p>   talking about a military wind down.</p>
<p>LYNEHAM:</p>
<p>So nothing to say tonight to the families of our troops wondering</p>
<p>   when are they coming home?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I will. I will say that the prospects of Australian forces</p>
<p>   not being involved in military action are obviously higher tonight</p>
<p>   than what they were last night. I hope, I fervently hope, as I have</p>
<p>   from the very beginning of this dispute, that it won't be necessary</p>
<p>   for Australians to go into action. And could I also say, that if</p>
<p>   military action is avoided it will have been overwhelmingly due</p>
<p>   to the willingness of Australia, Britain, the United States and</p>
<p>   others to put a military option on the table and to send forces</p>
<p>   to the Middle East. Because without that military build up you would</p>
<p>   never have got as far as you have with a possible diplomatic solution.</p>
<p>LYNEHAM:</p>
<p>Why are we starting to hear again now about the Government's</p>
<p>   desire to sell more of Telstra?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well people keep asking me questions about it. They keep asking</p>
<p>   me questions about it because the sale of one third was such a terrific</p>
<p>   success.</p>
<p>LYNEHAM:</p>
<p>Too successful say the Democrats. You have lined the pockets of</p>
<p>   investors, you have thrown away a public asset.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Isn't it terrible that 600,000 average Australians have invested</p>
<p>   in shares for the first time and they are on average a thousand</p>
<p>   dollars better off already through a capital gain? Isn't it</p>
<p>   dreadful that 92 per cent of the employees of Telstra thought it</p>
<p>   was such a good deal that they bought shares? Isn't it terrible</p>
<p>   that Telstra now has 1.2 million Australians owning it? Shocking.</p>
<p>   If that is terrible policy give me more.</p>
<p>LYNEHAM:</p>
<p>So it is likely that one of the things you will be putting to the</p>
<p>   people at the election is: let us sell more?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>That is very, very possible Paul. But I promise that we won't</p>
<p>   sell any more until we get the permission of the people at the next</p>
<p>   election. But it is obvious what I have said and what others have</p>
<p>   said that we are favourably disposed towards it. And in any event</p>
<p>   it makes sense.</p>
<p>LYNEHAM:</p>
<p>Some of that money went into the Natural Heritage Trust, about</p>
<p>   90 per cent of that has gone into improving the environment in Coalition</p>
<p>   electorates.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes but there is nothing wrong with that, I tell you why.</p>
<p>LYNEHAM:</p>
<p>But the environment doesn't stop at the city limits Mr Howard?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, no hang on. The things that the Natural Heritage Trust were</p>
<p>   intended for, and I said this before the election, were things like</p>
<p>   the Murray Darling Basin. Now you don't clean up the Murray</p>
<p>   Darling Basin by investing money in Balmain and Moonee Ponds, because</p>
<p>   you don't have salination problems in those suburbs. Any more</p>
<p>   than you want to have a better cities programme, you spend the money</p>
<p>   in Coonabarabran or Tallarook. You don't you spend the money</p>
<p>   in the cities.</p>
<p>LYNEHAM:</p>
<p>So it is all fair dinkum, you haven't borrowed Ros Kelly's</p>
<p>   old whiteboard?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I tell you what makes it fair dinkum, you know at the present time</p>
<p>   the Labor Party only holds, in land mass terms, 2 per cent of Australia.</p>
<p>LYNEHAM:</p>
<p>Are you still determined to put your Native Title Act back to the</p>
<p>   Senate?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>LYNEHAM:</p>
<p>And if they trigger all that double dissolution prospects...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I don't want a double dissolution, but what am I to do?</p>
<p>   The Native Title Act has got to be fixed up, you can't leave</p>
<p>   it as it is. And under the Constitution if the Senate again rejects</p>
<p>   the legislation the only way I can get it through is to put it to</p>
<p>   the people as a double dissolution and have a joint sitting. Now,</p>
<p>   I say to the Senate again, the Australian public is fed up with</p>
<p>   this issue, they want it behind them. The Labor Party is trying</p>
<p>   to string it out, to drag it out, to keep it going, to squeeze a</p>
<p>   few votes out of it. I don't think the Australian public wants</p>
<p>   that, the Australian public wants to get this thing behind them.</p>
<p>LYNEHAM:</p>
<p>Finally Prime Minister, Michael Kroger has been promoting his mate</p>
<p>   Peter Costello again as your successor are they trying to give you</p>
<p>   the hint or something?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, they are making a big hash of it if they are.</p>
<p>LYNEHAM:</p>
<p>It is not very subtle?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Look Michael is a good, enthusiastic bloke and so is Peter, and</p>
<p>   a very, very good Treasurer and I am enjoying the job immensely.</p>
<p>   And I think at the end of the day the future of all of us as politicians</p>
<p>   is in the hands of the voters and our own parties.</p>
<p>LYNEHAM:</p>
<p>Sometime between July and October this year?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>What, guidance?</p>
<p>LYNEHAM:</p>
<p>The election?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>What guidance, oh the election. Well that is a possibility but</p>
<p>   I don't really have to go to the election until March/April</p>
<p>   of next year. I would be happy to go the full term, the only thing</p>
<p>   that would stop tl term, the only thing</p>
<p>   that would stop that occurring would be if we had to have a double</p>
<p>   dissolution.</p>
<p>LYNEHAM:</p>
<p>Thanks for your time.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Pleasure.</p>
<p>[Ends]</p>
