    <content><![CDATA[<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>There's been the expected upturn of violence in Iraq, are you concerned that average Iraqis may stay away from the poll out of fear?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I certainly hope not.  There's an enormous amount at stake and I admire in an enormous way the courage of the Iraqi people in embracing democracy in the face of these fearful odds.  And if anybody wanted a demonstration of the justness of our cause in Iraq they should look at what is happening.  You're seeing a determined attempt by terrorists and murderers to deny people the opportunity of a democratic way of life.  The worst thing in the world would be to postpone the election.  I hope that there is a big turn out.  Bear in mind that in many democratic countries the turnout is barely 50 per cent, so let's not get too sensorius and moralistic about voter turnouts.  The important thing is that a ballot is being held and from this could emerge the first democratic Arab state and that is a hugely important historic development in the Middle East and of long term significance to the stability of the region.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>How heartened are you by the arrest of al-Zarqawi's main bomb maker?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I'm encouraged whenever the ringleaders of this grizzly mob are brought into custody but there's a long way to go.  There is an epic fight going on between the enemies of progress and democracy and freedom and those who want that way of life.  And what it demonstrates to the world is that democracy is something that can be embraced by Arab states as well as by other states.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Is that arrest a morale boost in breakthrough though?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Look I'm not going to use superlatives like that.  It is good news and more power to the arm of the Prime Minister of Iraq, Mr Alawi, more power to the arm of the Iraqi security forces who are trying to protect people as they go about their democratic right. I mean we take it for granted.  You don't need armed guards around polling booths in Australia; we take it for granted.  We ought to pause for a moment and think of what this means to the people of Iraq and instead of, as some do, cynically sitting on the sidelines and pointing at the terror and the bombings, they ought to be applauding the courage of the Iraqi people in carrying on in the face of these fearful odds.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, you've often indicated that you think Kim Beazley is the most capable MP on the Labor side.  Do you still hold that view?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes, I haven't altered my view just because he looks as though he will win.  I'm not going to enter into the debate about what the Labor Party should do, that's a matter for the Labor Party.  But if he becomes the leader I'm not going to automatically retract things I've said in the past but let's wait and see what happens on Friday. And I just want to take this opportunity of sending a little bit of a warning to Liberal Party supporters around the country - let's not get complacent.  The Labor Party is always competitive in this country, they've obviously gone through some dark days and a lot of travail over the past few weeks but anybody who thinks that the Labor Party will be an automatic pushover at the next election is kidding themselves, there is no such thing as an unlosable election, the next election will be very hard for us to win because it will be our fifth attempt to gain the confidence of the public, it's a long way off, we've only just had one so let's not talk too much about the next one. But I just want to send a general warning to Liberals around the country; don't get complacent, don't imagine that because we look as though we're doing well at the present time and the Labor Party's going through a lot of internal strife that that's going to last forever, it won't.  The Labor Party will get its act together, it'll get competitive and it'll be a tough fight over the next three years.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>And are you the best one to beat Kim Beazley given you've beaten him twice?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>What's the next question?</p>
<p>   JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Is Kim Beazley Labor's best chance at winning?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Look I'm not going to express a view, I was asked whether I still held views I'd previously expressed about the man and I answered that question but I'm not going to buy into whether he should or should not be chosen, that is a matter for the Labor Party and it always sounds self-serving for leaders of opposition parties, that is opposition to the Labor Party that is, to be giving him advice.  They will decide who they want and whoever they choose I will treat carefully, I will treat not in a light hearted manner, I always respect my opponents, no matter who they are, and whenever you stop doing that you ought to give the game away.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>How do you feel Prime Minister about once again facing Mr Beazley as an opponent?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I know Mr Beazley.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Do you encourage backbenchers to speak out publicly on issues of policy and (inaudible)?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I encourage people to think and speak their mind in accordance with the practices and usages of our party.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Will the Government consider scrapping the surcharge on superannuation for high income earners?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well we have a policy to reduce it, and if we have any extension of that policy or any change to that policy then that extension or change will be announced.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, just back on Iraq, what developments have there been in the move for plans to relocate the Australian Embassy into the green zone in Iraq, has that been...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I'm seeking some further advice on that. I'd like it accelerated, we would like that to happen and I hope to be talking to the Foreign Minister about that now that I'm back on deck after just a couple of days off and I certainly would like to see that move accelerated.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Are you concerned at the length of time it's taken to...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes I am concerned but I do understand that it's a pretty fraught situation.  We're not living in normal circumstances; things like that often take a long time in well ordered societies but in a country that's going through the pain and trouble that Iraq's going through it's taking a bit longer.  But I would like to see the move completed because it would add to the security and the safety of the people concerned.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>(inaudible) Prime Minister, why couldn't it be fast-tracked before given Iraq has always been...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I beg your pardon?</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>If it can be fast-tracked now, the move to...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well my understanding is that maximum pressure has been exerted to date and we're just going to continue to exert more pressure.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>On a more trivial matter, you'll be meeting the Australian of the Year finalists later this morning, are you disappointed Nicole Kidman is not turning up?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Look I don't want to comment on that, no.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, there are reports that June Bronhill has passed away, have you got any comments to make?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I heard that just a few moments ago and I am very sorry to hear that news, she was a great artist and somebody who we always identified with the cultural success of this country and I know that brings a lot of sorrow to many people and many opera and other fans around Australia.</p>
<p>   JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>How is Mrs Howard feeling after her hospital stay?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh she's great, she's terrific.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>She's been given the all clear?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
