PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA SUNDAY 28 SEPTEMBER 1980<br />
DEAFNESS AWARENESS WEEK(<br />
Seven out of 100 Australians suffer from serious hearing defects.<br />
This figure includes those who were born deaf and those who<br />
lost hearing through accident or illness.<br />
Last year at this time, I was pleased to launch the first<br />
WAustralian Deafness Awareness Week. It has been most heartening<br />
that a recommendation from Australia was accepted by the World<br />
Federation of the Deaf and that today commences the first<br />
International Deafness Awareness Week.<br />
This has certainly been a positive step to encourage wider<br />
understanding of the particular problems faced by the deaf. In<br />
Australia, a considerable amount of work is now being undertaken<br />
on how to introduce what is called a " closed captioning system"<br />
on television to assist the deaf.<br />
The Minister for Post and Telecommunications, Tony Staley, has<br />
asked a number of organisations if they will meet within a few<br />
weeks to explore the best ways of introducing such a system.<br />
These groups include the Australian Centre for Visual Television,<br />
the Broadcasting Council, the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal,<br />
the Australian Broadcasting Commission, Special Broadcasting<br />
Service and the Comm~ rercial television industry.<br />
I am very hopeful this meeting will lead, as quickly as possible,<br />
to a closed captioning system being introduced into Australia<br />
for the first time. There is no doubt that this will open up a<br />
whole new world for the deaf.<br />
This week throughout Australia the Deafness Awareness Council<br />
has arranged a wide programme of events to make us all aware<br />
of the severe handicap of deafness.<br />
In launching Deafness Awareness Week for 1980 I hope that all<br />
Australians go out of their way to show the deaf special care<br />
and understanding. 000---</p>
