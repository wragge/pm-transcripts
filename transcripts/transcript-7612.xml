EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
PARLIAMENTARY LUNCHEON FOR THE<br />
PRIME MINISTER OF PAPUA NEW GUINEA<br />
THE HON. RABBIE NAMALIU<br />
CANBERRA 24 MAY 1989<br />
It is always a great pleasure to welcome a visiting Head of<br />
Government from a neighbouring country. It is, however, a<br />
special pleasure when the visitor happens to be the Head of<br />
Government of Australia's closest neighbour, Papua New<br />
Guinea. I, therefore, most sincerely and warmly welcome<br />
you, Rabbie, your wife Margaret and members of your party to<br />
Canberra today on this, your first official visit to<br />
Australia as Prime minister.<br />
Mr Prime Minister, the ties of history and sentiment between<br />
our countries, and the personal relationships between our<br />
citizens, are strong and binding. We have known each other<br />
for some time, of course, and Hazel and I have very warm<br />
memories of the times we have spent in Papua New Guinea.<br />
I know that the Leader of the Opposition also has a long<br />
standing interest in your country.<br />
one of the many real virtues of a visit such as yours is the<br />
opportunity given to all of us to reaffirm and to strengthen<br />
those already strong and close links.<br />
For Australia and for Papua New Guinea, the South Pacific is<br />
a region of the highest significance for our foreign,<br />
economic and defence policies. We share fundamental<br />
interests to encourage peace and stability throughout the<br />
region, to foster trade and economic development, and to<br />
maintain vital and robust democratic institutions.<br />
It is in pursuit of these interests that Australia seeks to<br />
develop and maintain partnerships embracing all Pacific<br />
Island countries. It goes without saying, Mr Prime<br />
Minister, that of these partnerships, Australia's ties with<br />
Papua New Guinea are particularly warm and enduring.<br />
These common interests are, of course, summed up in, and<br />
encompassed by, the Joint Declaration of Principles signed<br />
by our two countries in December 1987. </p>
<p>This Joint Declaration is important at a number of levels.<br />
It provides an overall framework for the development of our<br />
bilateral relationship a framework of mutual respect<br />
between sovereign nations.<br />
It enjoins our governments to consult on all matters of<br />
mutual interest.<br />
The Joint Declaration recognises that by virtue of both<br />
history and geography, Papua New Guinea and Australia will<br />
always be vital to each other's strategic interests.<br />
Over the years the focus of the defence co-operation program<br />
that Australia maintains with Papua New Guinea has moved<br />
from direct involvement in Papua New Guinea's defence effort<br />
to training, advisory and material assistance.<br />
The essential thrust of our defence co-operation today a<br />
program that accounts for around half of Australia's entire<br />
defence co-operation effort seeks to assist Papua New<br />
Guinea develop its capacity to field independent operational<br />
forces. In recent years we have had brought home to us the fact that<br />
in our region we cannot take for granted the continued<br />
maintenance of democracy and democratic institutions.<br />
At times as with the recent tragedy of the senseless<br />
murders of Jean-Marie Tjibaou and Yeweine Yeweine we see<br />
evidence of an undercurrent of potential challenges to peace<br />
and stability in the Pacific.<br />
Even so, the region's political evolution has, overall, been<br />
relatively peaceful; even, when compared with other areas of<br />
the globe, exemplary.<br />
One of the principal vehicles of that evolution has been the<br />
South Pacific Forum.<br />
Through the Forum our two countries, and our neighbours in<br />
the region, have created a valuable process of consultation<br />
on all the issues we face, and we have achieved substantial<br />
gains in social and economic development, including in<br />
fisheries and communications.<br />
The South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone is another<br />
internationally significant regional achievement.<br />
Mr Prime Minister,<br />
Our shared trade and economic interests are manifest and are<br />
indeed central to your visit. In your discussions over the<br />
next few days, Australia's business community will be<br />
listening very closely to what you have to say. </p>
<p>we also share broader trade and economic interests. We are<br />
both vulnerable to the uncertainties of international<br />
commodities markets. In a world where commitment to free<br />
trade is too often eroded through short-sighted<br />
protectionism, countries such as ours have to -work that much<br />
harder to safeguard our legitimate interests.<br />
Papua New Guinea is not a GATT member, and thus is not<br />
participating in the present Uruguay Round of trade talks.<br />
However, your support in pursuing the objective of a fairer<br />
and freer world trading system is always most welcome.<br />
Australia will continue to work with Papua New Guinea to<br />
bridge the trade gap between our two countries. Papua New<br />
Guinea already enjoys virtually obstacle-free access to the<br />
Australian market. we will continue to assist you to<br />
develop your export capacity to take full advantage of the<br />
market opportunities which already exist, and to develop new<br />
opportunities, including through the current review of our<br />
bilateral trade agreement.<br />
Papua New Guinea faces a most significant challenge in<br />
transforming its huge potential wealth of natural resources<br />
into sustainable and balanced economic growth.<br />
I am optimistic that Australian capital and technology will<br />
be able to continue making a contribution to your<br />
development. My own Government's commitment to assisting your development<br />
is symbolised by the Treaty on Development Co-operation,<br />
which we signed this morning.<br />
In that Treaty, we have agreed to continue the present level<br />
of budget support for a further two years beyond the<br />
previous three year commitment and, then, to taper it off as<br />
Papua New Guinea's own proclaimed objective of fiscal<br />
self-reliance is realised.<br />
Mr Prime minister,<br />
Economic prosperity engenders its own pressures. In the<br />
closing years of the 1980s these pressures in many areas of<br />
the globe have been manifested in enormous social change, in<br />
threats to the environment and, at times, in dislocation and<br />
upheaval. Papua New Guinea has had its own share of challenges of late<br />
particularly of course, on Bougainville.<br />
Yours is a diverse and complex society, but since<br />
independence, Papua New Guinea has shown itself capable of<br />
negotiating periods of difficulty with flexibility and<br />
commonsense. </p>
<p>Like Australia, Papua New Guinea is immeasurably<br />
strengthened by the resilience and vitality of democratic<br />
Government. This is an achievement of which all Papua New<br />
Guineans can justifiably be proud and I am confident it<br />
will stand you in good stead for many years to come.<br />
Mr Prime Minister, last November the first meeting of the<br />
Australia/ PNG Ministerial Forum took place in Wewak. That<br />
meeting itself a product of the Joint Declaration of<br />
Principles was an outstanding success substantive and<br />
mutually productive but also marked by great informality and<br />
friendship.<br />
These, of course, are the hallmarks of the Australia-PNG<br />
relationship, and they were abundantly evident in our<br />
discussions today.<br />
Mr Prime Minister,<br />
Let me reiterate, on behalf of the Government and of the<br />
Australian people, the sincerity of our welcome to you and<br />
your party. Rabbie, you could not be more welcome here. We<br />
wish you well, in the knowledge that your visit will be both<br />
successful and constructive. </p>
