<p>Well thank you very much for those words of welcome and it is nice</p>
<p> to be back. And I've come here today to announce that the Federal</p>
<p> Government will provide financial support for the activities of the</p>
<p> Integrated Cancer Programme which of course is a joint activity of</p>
<p> the Centenary Institute and the Cancer Centre. There is no audience</p>
<p> in Australia better aware of the fact that cancer leaves virtually</p>
<p> no family in our nation unaffected. And although medical advances</p>
<p> have contributed immeasurably to the relief of suffering from cancer</p>
<p> and the longevity of life of people affected by cancer, much more</p>
<p> needs to be done. And in recognition of that, successive federal governments</p>
<p> of both political persuasions have given assistance to a variety of</p>
<p> programmes.</p>
<p>The National Cancer Control Initiative was announced by the present</p>
<p> Government in the last budget. We've provided new funding for</p>
<p> prostate and other cancers, continuing funding of the National Breast</p>
<p> Cancer Centre, and the National Screening Programme for breast and</p>
<p> cervical cancer. And through the National Health and Medical Research</p>
<p> Council we provide $23 million in the current year for cancer research.</p>
<p>But I want to announce today that the Commonwealth Government will</p>
<p> provide support for a new programme to implement that approach in</p>
<p> Australia. And the programme will undertake laboratory and clinical</p>
<p> research and apply those results through</p>
<p> multi-disciplinary cancer treatment and education. As you know the</p>
<p> proposal for the Integrated Cancer Programme comes from the partnership</p>
<p> between the Sydney Cancer Centre and the Centenary Institute. And</p>
<p> the programme will provide an integrated research and care role for</p>
<p> cancer sufferers and move cancer research in Australia into the next</p>
<p> century.</p>
<p>The partnership between these two groups is well established and well</p>
<p> known. The centre was established in January 1996 at the Royal Prince</p>
<p> Alfred, King George V, and Concord Hospitals. And the centre is the</p>
<p> largest cancer treating centre in Australia, admitting in excess of</p>
<p> 22,000 cancer patients and treating over 70,000 out-patients every</p>
<p> year.</p>
<p>The institute was established in 1985 to commemorate 100 years of</p>
<p> research and clinical excellence at Royal Prince Alfred Hospital and</p>
<p> the University of Sydney Medical School. And the institute was established</p>
<p> to provide both New South Wales and Australia with a research centre</p>
<p> of excellence at the forefront of advances in prevention, diagnosis</p>
<p> and treatment of life threatening diseases including cancer.</p>
<p>The Integrated Cancer Programme has been established as a joint venture</p>
<p> between those two groups to bring together an optimal mix of basic</p>
<p> cancer research, applied laboratory research and clinical research.</p>
<p> And more importantly this mix will allow the rapid introduction of</p>
<p> new cancer research discoveries to be directly applied to the clinical</p>
<p> care of patients fighting cancer. And the sight chosen has close links</p>
<p> with the Faculty of Medicine at the University of Sydney, as well</p>
<p> as to population, health, cancer screening, high technology imaging</p>
<p> and the NHMRC Clinical Trials Unit.</p>
<p>The laboratory based cancer research will deliberately focus on existing</p>
<p> areas of research showing the greatest promise for significant advances</p>
<p> in the understanding and the treatment of cancer. And these will include</p>
<p> genetic changes leading to cancer cell growth, a gene therapy programme</p>
<p> to identify abnormal genes, and ways to circumvent cancer cell resistance</p>
<p> to anti-cancer drugs.</p>
<p>There will be close monitoring of the results of new treatments identified</p>
<p> by research. And the Cancer Clinical Trials Programme will develop</p>
<p> and evaluate new cancer therapies on a large scale in partnership</p>
<p> with international cancer organsiations and the pharmaceutical industry.</p>
<p> And this will include world-wide acquisition of the most promising</p>
<p> new anti-cancer products. The injection of federal funding will allow</p>
<p> the Integrated Cancer Programme to continue to develop this approach</p>
<p> and to recruit back to Australia high profile Australian cancer specialists</p>
<p> and researchers currently working overseas.</p>
<p>I'm delighted that in the past year, six world leading Australian</p>
<p> cancer specialists have been successfully recruited to work in the</p>
<p> new Integrated Cancer Programme. And the Commonwealth is providing</p>
<p> initial support to this very worthwhile venture to ensure that cancer</p>
<p> sufferers have access to the best and latest available treatments.</p>
<p> We believe that following this initial Commonwealth investment that</p>
<p> the success of the venture will encourage funding from other funding</p>
<p> agencies and from commercial and international pharmaceutical and</p>
<p> biotechnology companies.</p>
<p>Cancer, as I said at the beginning of my remarks, is a disease that</p>
<p> touches just about every Australian family and has a major impact</p>
<p> on sufferers and those close to them. It touches us all and the Integrated</p>
<p> Cancer Programme devised by the institute and the centre seeks to</p>
<p> relieve some of that suffering.</p>
<p>The total cost of this very worthy endeavor is $6 million. The Commonwealth</p>
<p> announces today federal funding of $3 million and I have every reason</p>
<p> to believe that this will be matched by the New South Wales Government</p>
<p> so that the total amount will be made available. Ladies and gentleman,</p>
<p> this is in every sense of the well worn but very apt expression, a</p>
<p> very worthy endeavor.</p>
<p>I have long said that Australia has scientists, medical researchers,</p>
<p> doctors, and others working in the area of preventative health, in</p>
<p> the area of treatment and the area of the relief of suffering which</p>
<p> are not exceeded in ability by people anywhere in the world. The 21st</p>
<p> century will be very much a century in which those who are at the</p>
<p> forefront of research, and most importantly those who are able to</p>
<p> match the results of research immediately with clinical treatment,</p>
<p> will be those who will make the greatest contribution to the relief</p>
<p> of human suffering.</p>
<p>The intellectual capital of Australia is one of its most precious</p>
<p> assets. Sometimes in the past we have not done enough to preserve</p>
<p> it and we have not done enough to fully exploit it and take full advantage</p>
<p> of it, not only for the benefit of our citizens but also for the benefit</p>
<p> of the citizens of the world. I admire the work of people who work</p>
<p> in any field of research. I admire those who work in the medical profession</p>
<p> in Australian and I admire the work of this institute and of this</p>
<p> centre. And I hope the announcement I have made today lays the foundation</p>
<p> for ongoing support both at a State Government and a private sector</p>
<p> level for what is a project that I believe will bring great relief</p>
<p> of suffering and will provide an inspiration to the research efforts</p>
<p> of many Australians and will continue the process of people of great</p>
<p> ability previously enticed overseas, returning to work in their homeland</p>
<p> and to give to Australia the benefits of their great intellectual</p>
<p> and research capacity. Thank you very much.</p>
