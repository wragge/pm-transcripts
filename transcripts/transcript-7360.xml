PRIME MINISTER<br />
CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
CITIZENSHIP CEREMONY<br />
PRESTON 19 JULY 1988<br />
At the outset, I want to offer my congratulations to the<br />
true guests of honor of today's ceremony the 103 people<br />
who are about to become citizens of Australia.<br />
As a group, you represent an enormous diversity of people<br />
and nations. You have come from twenty five different<br />
countries from Europe, Asia, the Pacific and the Americas;<br />
from countries as large as the United States and as<br />
small as Mauritius;<br />
from a country as old as democracy itself, Greece, and<br />
from Italy, one of the cradles of Western civilisations;<br />
from places which have been the source of Australian<br />
settlers for all of our two hundred years of continuous<br />
settlement, that is the United Kingdom and Ireland, and<br />
from our newer sources of immigrants, such as Korea and<br />
Lebanon.<br />
Let me, for the record, list the background of all the<br />
people here today. There are nineteen Yugoslavs, sixteen<br />
Italians, thirteen Britons, ten Greeks, and people from<br />
Argentina, Albania, Chile, Cyprus, East Timor, Fiji, India,<br />
Ireland, Korea, Lebanon, Malta, Malaysia, Mauritius, the<br />
Netherlands, New Zealand, Portugal, the Philippines,<br />
Romania, Turkey, the USA, and Vietnam,<br />
So you represent most of the major ethnic communities in<br />
Australia and a large number of the smaller ones.<br />
In short, you represent in your diversity the diversity of<br />
the world.<br />
But for all your diversity as a group, you have all as<br />
individuals arrived at the same decision.<br />
For all your different ages and backgrounds and lengths of<br />
time spent in Australia, you are all about to make the same<br />
commitment by taking on the same rights and<br />
responsibilities as citizens of Australia. </p>
<p>And it is for that reason that tremendous decision you<br />
have taken and you are about to implement that I offer you<br />
my most sincere congratulations.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen,<br />
I want to take the opportunity of this citizenship ceremony<br />
to say something about my Government's thinking on the broad<br />
issues of citizenshipabout<br />
what it means to become citizens of Australia, and<br />
what it means to Australians to welcome newcomers as our<br />
fellow citizens.<br />
Last week in Canberra I had the pleasure of playing host to<br />
the Prime Minister of Ireland, Charles Haughey, who was<br />
visiting Australia as part of our Bicentennial celebrations.<br />
A very large number of Australians of course proudly claim<br />
an Irish heritage. In the Parliamentary dinner held in honor<br />
of Mr Haughey's visit in the Great Hall of the new<br />
Parliament House, I said that like so many people who had<br />
come to settle in Australia from overseas, Irish Australians<br />
retained as they should the love of their land of<br />
origin.<br />
But for the Irish-Australians, as it is for so many new<br />
settlers in Australia, what is paramount is the commitment<br />
to their new home, to Australia.<br />
in a similar vein, I had the memorable experience in Sydney<br />
earlier this year of speaking at a dinner of the Lebanese<br />
community. Present at the dinner were representatives of the entire<br />
spectrum of Lebanese Christian and Muslim groups, meeting<br />
together in an atmosphere of harmony and community spirit.<br />
The point is that they, too, have left behind them the<br />
bitterness and divisiveness which so tragically afflicts<br />
their homeland, and have devoted themselves, together, to<br />
building a better Australia.<br />
As I put it in my speech to the nation on Australia Day<br />
Australia's bicentennial day it doesn't matter whether<br />
your family has been in Australia for 40,000 years or for<br />
seven or eight generations, or whether you have just<br />
arrived. What does matter is whether you are committed to Australia.<br />
we are, and essentially we remain, a nation of immigrants<br />
a nation drawn from 130 nations as well as from one of the<br />
world's oldest cultures, the Australian Aboriginal culture.<br />
It is this very diversity that makes us special among the<br />
nations of the world, and that makes us a strong and<br />
resilient community. </p>
<p>Because from the day the First Fleet arrived through the<br />
fever of the Gold Rush through the growth into nationhood<br />
and the sacrifice of two world wars through the massive<br />
surge of immigration after 1945 as we built the foundations<br />
of a modern economy and through the trauma of the Vietnam<br />
War and its aftermath Australians for the entirety of our<br />
two hundred years of national development have had to accept<br />
the fact of our racial and ethnic diversity.<br />
I do not pretend that diversity has always been fully<br />
appreciated, or that newcomers have been made as welcome<br />
among us as they deserved.<br />
But I do assert that, fundamentally, what unites us is far<br />
greater than what may seem to divide us. We are united by<br />
sharing a common land, sharing a common loyaltjiyto the<br />
institutions of our society, and sharing a common aspiration<br />
to build a future of peace and prosperity for our children.<br />
Throughout these two centuries the key to Australia's<br />
growth, the secret of Australia's success, has been the fact<br />
that regardless of their origin, people have continued to<br />
identify themselves as Australians as you are doing today.<br />
And for two hundred years these people have made good that<br />
commitment to Australia by devoting their labor to the<br />
protection of our peace and the enlargement of our<br />
prosperity. Ladies and gentlemen,<br />
In pinpointing what makes us distinctively Australian we<br />
acknowledge the enormous debt we owe to Britain.<br />
Britain has given us the basis of many of the institutions<br />
of our free society: our system of Parliamentary democracy,<br />
the principles of rule by law and the protection of the<br />
rights of the individual under the law, our system of<br />
liberal education.<br />
English is our national language and we provide the means to<br />
those from different language backgrounds to acquire skills<br />
in English. British migrants continue to come to Australia<br />
in large numbers and to be very welcome among us.<br />
And we also need to acknowledge the great enrichment our<br />
society has received from people of other nations and<br />
civil isations.<br />
I have mentioned the Irish, whose great contribution goes<br />
back 200 years. And I want to pay tribute to those who have<br />
come here, particularly since the Second World War, from<br />
such countries as Italy, Greece, Yugoslavia, the<br />
Netherlands, Malta, Poland, Germany, Lebanon, Turkey, and,<br />
more recently, from Vietnam and other Asian countries, and<br />
Latin America.<br />
We should recognise that circumstances have often been<br />
difficult for such communities. But notwithstanding<br />
residual pockets of racism and prejudice, those communities </p>
<p>are now widely recognised as having made a tremendous<br />
contribution to Australia and are very much welcomed here.<br />
On behalf of the Government, I want to say that they will<br />
continue to be welcome here and their fellow countrymen and<br />
women will continue to be welcome here.<br />
In surveying Australia today, it is perhaps invidious to<br />
single out the contribution of particular immigrants for<br />
mention. But some names readily spring to mind.<br />
Names like that of Dr Victor Chang, the eminent<br />
transplant specialist, who has devoted himself to saving<br />
the lives of his fellow Australians, whatever their<br />
background; Or Franco Belgiorno-Nettis, who not only has played a<br />
major role in the development of Australian industry,<br />
and in patronage of the arts, but who now, in his<br />
support for the Australian pavilion at the Venice<br />
Biennale, is proudly proclaiming his adopted country to<br />
his country of origin;<br />
Or Alex Tzannes, the eminent Australian architect<br />
responsible for the design of the Bicentennial pavilion<br />
in Centennial Park, Sydney; or Imants Tillers who<br />
painted the mural within it;<br />
Or Jenny Kee, whose exciting and innovative designs have<br />
introduced Australian motifs and colour to the world<br />
fashion scene; or Judy Cassab, one of Australia's most<br />
distinguished artists, twice winner of the Archibald<br />
Prize; or Dr Alessandra Pucci, Qantas Businesswoman of<br />
the Year.<br />
Or in the field of sporting prowess, an area of<br />
passionate interest to so many Australians, where<br />
immigration has had a tremendously beneficial effect on<br />
our country. What Australians of diverse backgrounds<br />
can achieve together has been shown in the past few days<br />
by the likes of Frank Arok and Eddie Thomson, Charlie<br />
Yankos and Paul Wade, Vlado Bozinovski and Scott<br />
Ollerenshaw, Frank Farina and Graham Jennings,<br />
Oscar Crino and Alan Davidson, wearing the green and<br />
gold of Australia with pride and distinction.<br />
Being Australian is not determined by where you come from,<br />
or how you dress, or what you eat, or what sport you play.<br />
It is not determined by the language that you speak at home<br />
or the religion that you practice. It is not determined by<br />
the colour of your skin.<br />
It is only determined, as the contribution of so many new<br />
settlers proves, by your commitment to Australia.<br />
What is that commitment? </p>
<p>The ultimate expression of commitment is contained in the<br />
oath or Affirmation of Allegiance that is about to be made<br />
by one hundred and three people.<br />
The words of this undertaking require a declaration of<br />
allegiance to the Queen not the Queen of Great Britain but<br />
the Queen of Australia, th~ iHead of State of a mature and<br />
independent nation.<br />
The words of the undertaking also require a promise to<br />
observe the laws of Australia and fulfil the duties of an<br />
Australian citizen.<br />
Last year, that commitment was made by nearly 75,000 people<br />
and we applaud their decision. But remarkably, there are<br />
still an estimated one million Australian residents who are<br />
qualified to become Australian citizens but who have not<br />
done so.<br />
We do not seek to make citizenship compulsory, and we will<br />
not make it so.<br />
But I do want to use this opportunity to urge as many people<br />
as possible to follow your example to express their<br />
commitment to Australia by taking on the rights and the<br />
responsibilities of Australian citizenship.<br />
Such a commitment is entirely consistent with our policy of<br />
multiculturalism: accepting and celebrating our diversity<br />
and forging it into a unified Australia.<br />
A multicultural Australia is one in which Australians have<br />
an equal right to participate in all aspects of the nation's<br />
life. Just as importantly, it is one where all Australians<br />
are encouraged to take up an equitable share of the<br />
responsibilities for the country's future.<br />
This concept of multiculturalism has come in for some<br />
ill-informed criticism in recent times; ill-informed<br />
criticism that is sometimes accompanied by crude<br />
stereotyping.<br />
The policy of multiculturalism is not, as is frequently<br />
alleged, an attempt to fragment Australian society or to<br />
create ghettos. It recognises the fact of diversity in<br />
Australia and the socially enriching value of diversity.<br />
But our policy of multiculturalism. also insists that all<br />
Australians, of whatever origin, accept the overarching:<br />
principles and institutions which make us one single nation.<br />
Multiculturalism does not seek to import or entrench<br />
division into the Australian community. And I reject<br />
utterly any suggestion that it has in fact done so.<br />
It is unfortunate that much of this criticism has followed<br />
on from the release of the FitzGerald Report on Australia's<br />
Immigration Policies a Report which was commissioned as </p>
<p>part of the Government's continuing monitoring of the role<br />
of immigration in the development of Australia.<br />
Let me emphasise that the Report has not even been<br />
considered, let alone adopted, by the Government and in no<br />
way constitutes " a blueprint for Government policy" as it<br />
has been described in the press in the past couple of days.<br />
The Government is currently undertaking a wide series of<br />
consultations on the Report's recommendations, and it would<br />
not be proper for me to pre-empt this process by discussing<br />
the Report or its recommendations tonight.<br />
But it is right, indeed it is necessary, that I say this.<br />
If those who, for whatever reason, have embarked on a<br />
deliberate campaign of misinformation about our policies on<br />
immigration or multiculturalism hope that they will thereby<br />
overturn them, then they are badly mistaken.<br />
There will be no return to the past. The white Australia<br />
policy is dead and buried.<br />
The central principles of our immigration policies are<br />
non-negotiable. Immigration will continue to be based on<br />
our national interest. It will continue to be<br />
non-discriminatory. Family reunion will remain a vital<br />
component of it. We will continue to play our part in<br />
meeting the great humanitarian obligation to provide a haven<br />
for refugees fleeing oppression overseas.<br />
Despite all our history of immigration, despite all the<br />
contributions to Australia by immigrants, despite all the<br />
promise the future holds, there are those who want to be<br />
taken seriously when they say Australia should turn its back<br />
on many of its rich sources of immigrants.<br />
But who would dare tell me that this very electorate of<br />
wills which is one of the most ethnically diverse in<br />
Australia is not distinctly Australian? who seriously<br />
claims it is not as some would have it " authentically"<br />
Au s tral1i an?<br />
Let us face facts: The idea that Australia would be-somehow<br />
better off if it had drawn new settlers from some countries<br />
alone is absurd and repugnant. We should all proclaim this<br />
loudly and without hesitation.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen,<br />
Let me conclude as I began by addressing some comments<br />
directly to the 103 people who are about to become<br />
Australian citizens.<br />
Each of you brings to these offices in Preston a life story<br />
which is the stuff of human drama.<br />
You come from different backgrounds and different individual<br />
circumstances. when you leave you will go to different<br />
homes, different jobs. </p>
<p>But to put these individual differences to one side for a<br />
moment, it is clear you have all come for basically the same<br />
reason.<br />
You have come because you seek the special qualities of<br />
peace, prosperity and harmony which characterise the<br />
Australian lifestyle.<br />
As Prime Minister of Australia I sincerely and<br />
wholeheartedly welcome your decision to take up Australian<br />
citizenship.<br />
As the local member for Wills I express my pride at your new<br />
commitment to Australia.<br />
And as a citizen of Australia I welcome you as my<br />
fellow-citizens.<br />
When you leave today, you will be taking with you all the<br />
rights and all the obligations of Australian citizenship.<br />
I urge on you the task of helping ensure Australia remains<br />
peaceful remains prosperous remains harmonious so that<br />
it remains what I assert it is simply, the greatest nation<br />
in the world. </p>
