Business and union leaders in the resources sector have committed to work in partnership with the Australian Government to increase productivity and competitiveness, create jobs and improve the skills of workers in the sector. </p>
<p>Prime Minister Julia Gillard and Minister for Jobs, Skills and Workplace Relations, Senator Chris Evans, industry and union representatives today discussed the challenges of labour and skills demand, attraction and retention of employees, enhancing productivity and collaborative workplace relations.</p>
<p>The Australian resources sector is facing a number of significant challenges at a time when there are historically high levels of capital investment.  Many of these challenges relate to employment in the sector.</p>

<p>The Council will meet twice per calendar year and will have the ability to develop recommendations to inform government and industry as appropriate.</p>
