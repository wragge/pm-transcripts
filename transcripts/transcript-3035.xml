STATEMENT TO THE HOUSE BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
I inform the House of the following Ministerial changes.<br />
The new Ministers were sworn in by His Excellency the Governor-<br />
General earlier today.<br />
Senator the Hon. J. L. Cavanagh has been appointed Minister for<br />
Aboriginal Affairs. The Hon. Gordon Bryant has been appointed<br />
Minister for the Capital Territory. The Hon. Les Johnson has<br />
been appointed Minister for Works and the Hon. Kep Enderby has<br />
been appointed Minister for Secondary Industry and Minister for<br />
Supply. I inform the House also of the following additional Ministerial<br />
changes not yet in effect but intended to be given effect in the<br />
near future.<br />
The Hon. Rex Patterson, who is at present representing the<br />
Australian Government at the International Sugar Agreement<br />
Conference and. who will return to Australia during next week,<br />
will after his return be sworn in as Minister for the Northern<br />
Territory. Also. after my visit to Japan where I am to represent<br />
the Government as Minister for Foreign Affairs as well as Prime<br />
Minister, and my -visit to ChinaSenator Willesee, who is<br />
himself now abroad representing Australia at the United Nations<br />
General. Assembly and other international meetings, will be<br />
sworn in as Minister for Foreign Affairs.<br />
The new arrangements will produce a more even and better<br />
balanced distribution of the workload within the Cabinet.<br />
In particular, some portfolios having common interests will be<br />
brought together under one minister and the ultimate<br />
amalgamation of the departments concerned thus facilitated,<br />
I have already in one instance -the Department of Supply,<br />
foreshadowed to the House a proposal for it's amalgamation<br />
with another department. The rearrangement will also reduce<br />
the heavy durdens previously falling to some senior Ministers.<br />
As honourable members will be aware, the Minister for Repatriation<br />
Senator Bishop, is ill. During his ansence the Minister for<br />
the Capital Territory, Mr Bryant is acting Minister for<br />
Repatriation. Mr Bryant is also representing the Minister for<br />
Aboriginal Affairs in this House.<br />
Canberra, 9 October, 1973 </p>
