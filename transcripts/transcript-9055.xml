PRIME MINISTER<br />
STATHMRNT FROM THEl OFFICE OF THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
FAIRFAX The Prime Minister has never given mr Black any promise<br />
to support an increase to 35 per cent in his holding of<br />
John Fairfax Limited.<br />
During a meeting in November last year Mr Black made<br />
clear his preference to achieve the highest possible<br />
stake in Fairfax. In this context he indicated he would<br />
prefer 35 per cent rather than 25 per cent.<br />
The Prime Minister made it clear to Mr Black that while<br />
the Government could not, of course, prevent him from<br />
making further applications to increase his holding,<br />
per cent would be the maximum achievable level.<br />
This was borne out in the Cabinet decision of April<br />
this year, when the ceiling was set at 25 per cent, and<br />
when the Treasurer announced that no further increase<br />
would be countenanced. This remains Government policy.<br />
The stark difference between the positions of Mr Keating<br />
and Dr Hewson is that the Keating Government has not at<br />
any time contemplated allowing foreign interests to gain<br />
majority ownership of Fairfax ( that is, a shareholding of<br />
per cent or more), while Dr Hewson is reported by Mr<br />
Black to have said he was " very relaxed about what our<br />
( Black's) level of ownership would be."<br />
