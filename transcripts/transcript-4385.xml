PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR PRESS 4 MAY 1977<br />
REFERENDUM CAMPAIGN OPENING<br />
On May 21 we will all have an opportunity for a say in our<br />
own future.<br />
Four questions will be put to all of us, affecting the<br />
Constitution. As you know, it is the Constitution that sets<br />
the guidelines for the way Governments operate in Australia.<br />
The questions that are being put to us all are, in our view,<br />
fair, sensible and just. They will make the Constitution<br />
work better.<br />
In the past, people have had a tendency to vote No when<br />
Constitutional questions and ref erendtns have been put. In<br />
the past there may have been good reason for this. It has<br />
often been a case of Federal politicians asking for more power<br />
for themselves. People are a little suspicious of politicians<br />
who ask for more power. People tend to think that politicians<br />
have enough power.<br />
But the questions being put on May 21 are quite unlike that.<br />
Nobody is asking for more power for themselves. Nobody is<br />
asking for more power for Canberra. The questions do not take<br />
anything away from the States. That is important, because the<br />
States have a vital and continuing role to play in our system<br />
of Government.<br />
The questions being put are fair. They are sensible and they<br />
are just. They will make the Constitution work better. There<br />
are other differences from what has happened in the past. There<br />
was a Constitutional Convention at which representatives of the<br />
Federal Government, State Governments and local government<br />
discussed these matters in great detail. The principles lying<br />
behind the questions gained great support at that Constitutional<br />
Convention. We have all political parties in the Federal sphere<br />
supporting these questions. I believe they are going to be<br />
successful because they are fair, they are just, they are<br />
reasonable, and they will make the Constitution work better.<br />
/ Let us </p>
<p>-2-<br />
Let us look at the proposals. The first proposal concerns<br />
simultaneous elections for the House of Representatives and<br />
for the Senate. Surely this is simple common sense, because<br />
otherwise we could have four elections over the next four years.<br />
A Yes vote cannot reduce the powers of the Senate or of the<br />
States, but what it does mean is that when you go to vote in the<br />
Federal area you will be voting for the Government of Australia.<br />
The second proposal concerns the Senator you actually elect.<br />
Should he die or resign during his period of office, we believe<br />
that he ought to be replaced by somebody from the same political<br />
party and thaL. the replacement Senator should serve out the<br />
remainder of this term. That means that the party balance<br />
determined at one election will be maintained until the next.<br />
The third question concerns the right of voters in the Australian<br />
Capital Territory and Northern Territory to vote at referendums.<br />
At the moment they are denied that right. We believe it is<br />
only fair and proper that they should be able to vote as can<br />
other Australians. 150,000 people are involved. We ask you<br />
to give th'em that right.<br />
The fourth question concerns the retiring age for Federal judges<br />
to be appointed in the future. We believe that after the age of<br />
it is only fair and reasonable that responsibility should be<br />
handed on to younger people, and this is especially important<br />
with the new development of a -Federal system of Family Courts.<br />
A Yes vote will make this possible.<br />
The four proposals then are these: simultaneous elections to<br />
be held for the Senate and the House of Representatives:<br />
casual Senate vacancies to be filled by a person of the same<br />
political party as the Senator chosen by the people: electors<br />
in the Territories to be allowed to vote at referendums to<br />
alter the Constitution: and retiring ages to be set for High<br />
Court judges and judges of other Federal Courts.<br />
We recommend a Yes vote on all questions. They . re fair, they<br />
are reasonable, they are just, and they will make the<br />
Constitution work better. They are supported by all Federal<br />
political parties. They represent plain Australian common<br />
sense. They give us a real opportunity to reform the Constitution. </p>
