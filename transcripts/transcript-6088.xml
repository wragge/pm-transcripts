SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON R. J. HAWKE A. C. M. P.<br />
T0 THE VICTORIAN AUSTRALIAN LABOR PARTY CONFERENCE<br />
MELBOURNE<br />
17 APRIL 1983<br />
DELEGATES, THIS IS THE FIRST CONFERENCE OF ANY BRANCH OF THE<br />
AUSTRALIAN LABOR PARTY AT WHICH I HAVE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY<br />
o TO THANK EVERY MEMBER OF THE PARTY FOR THEIR WORK AND<br />
THEIR DEDICATION WHICH CULMINATED IN THE GREAT TRIUMPH<br />
THE SWEEPING VICTORY OF OUR GREAT PARTY ON 5 MARCH,<br />
AND I DOUBLY APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO<br />
THAT IN MY HOME STATE, VICTORIA THE STATE WHICH MADE THE<br />
BIGGEST SINGLE CONTRIBUTION TO THAT VICTORY.<br />
AND IT WAS A CONTRIBUTION WHICH BEGAN LONG BEFORE<br />
THE CAMPAIGN.<br />
o No BRANCH OF THE PARTY HAS HAD TO CONTEND AGAINST<br />
GREATER DIFFICULTIES OVER THE YEARS THAN VICTORIA.<br />
Wt HAVC SUFFERED TOGETHER TREMENDOUS PROBLEMS AND<br />
DIFFICULTIES. HERE WAS THE VERY CITADEL OF THE POWERFUL<br />
CONSERVATIVE ESTABLISHMENT THE JEWEL IN THE LIBERAL PARTY<br />
CROWN. </p>
<p>FOR YEARS THE DEMOGRAPHIC BALANCE -OR<br />
IMBALANCE -SEEMED TO CONSPIRE AGAINST THE EXPRESSION<br />
OF THE DEMOCRATIC WILL OF THE PEOPLE.<br />
BUT WE HAVE WON THROUGH IN SPITE OF ALL.<br />
AND WE ARE NOW IN THE UNPRECEDENTED POSITIONSOMETHING<br />
THAT HAS NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE IN THE HISTORY<br />
OF OUR PARTY OR THE HIS :-ORY OF THE FEDERATION THAT WE<br />
HAVE AS MANY FEDERAL MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT FROM VICTORIA,<br />
0AND INDEED PROPORTIONATE LY, MORE THAN NEW SOUTH WALES,<br />
THE TRADITIONAL HEARTLAND OF LABOR IN AUSTRALIA,<br />
THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN REGARDED<br />
AS INCONCEIVABLE TEN YEARS AGO.<br />
BUT THROUGH YOUR WORK AND DEDICATION AND LOYALTY,<br />
IT HAS COME TO PASS.<br />
AND OUR AIM IS TO KEEP IT THAT WAY TO KEEP<br />
VICTORIA A GREAT LABOR STATE.<br />
BUT THE TRANSFORMATION WHICH HAS OCCURRED IN THE<br />
VICTORIAN SCENE . HAS BEEN PARALLELED THROUGHOUT THE NATION.<br />
AND WE CAN TAKE PARTICULAR SATISFACTION IN THE<br />
FACT THAT THE GREAT DRIVE TO VICTORY BEGAN IN VICTORIA,<br />
AND IN A VERY REAL SENSE, BECAUSE OF VICTORIA. </p>
<p>-3<br />
THE TRUST WHICH THE PEOPLE OF VICTORIA<br />
. AND THE PEOPLE OF AUSTRALIA HAVE PLACED ON US<br />
IS SOMETHING WE CANNOT ESCAPE, AND SHOULD NOT WISH<br />
TO ESCAPE, EVEN IF WE COULD,<br />
AT SUCH A TIME AS THIS, I THINK IT IS<br />
NECESSARY TO CONSIDER THE FUNDAMENTAL REASONS FOR OUR<br />
EXISTENCE AS A PARTY, AND THE REASONS FOR OUR<br />
SURVIVAL As AUSTRALIA'S OLDEST AND GREATEST PARTY.<br />
AND I BELIEV/ E THAT THERE ARE TWO FUNDAMENTAL<br />
PROPOSITIONS WE HAVE TO CONSIDER; THAT WE EXIST AS<br />
A PARTY TO PROMOTE CERTAIN GREAT PRINCIPLES,<br />
POLICIES AND PROGRAMS.<br />
AND SECOND, WE EXIST AS A PARTY TO FORM<br />
ELECTED GOVERNMENTS BY ACHIEVING THE SUPPORT OF A<br />
MAJORITY OF THE VICTORIAN AND THE AUSTRALIAN PEOPLE.<br />
AND THESE TWO THINGS ARE REALLY INSEPARABLE.<br />
BECAUSE IN THE FINAL ANALYSIS, THE BEST<br />
PRINCIPLES, * THE BEST POLICIES, THE BEST PROGRAMS,<br />
ARE IRRELEVANT UNLESS WE ARE ABLE TO FORM GOVERNMENTS<br />
WHEREBY WE CAN PUT THOSE PRINCIPLES, POLICIES AND<br />
PROGRAMS INTO PRACTICE, $ 14 </p>
<p>/ 1<br />
-I-4-<br />
IT'S JUST ONE YEAR AGO THE THIRD OF APRIL 1983<br />
THAT JOHN CAIN LED THE PARTY TO ITS MAGNIFICANT VICTORY.<br />
UNTIL THAT DAY, WE HELD ONLY ONE MAINLAND<br />
STATE NEW SOUTH WALES.<br />
SINCE THEN, THE VICTORIAN LABOR PARTY HAS<br />
STRENGTHENED ITS POSITION EVEN FURTHER, AND WE HAVE<br />
WON GOVERNMENTS IN SOUTH AUSTRALIA, WESTERN AUSTRALIA AND<br />
OF COURSE, THE GOVERNMENT OF AUSTRALIA,<br />
A TRANSFORMATION ON THIS SCALE HAS NOT<br />
OCCURRED IN AUSTRALIAN HISTORY SINCE 1943.<br />
IN THE HISI<br />
TRANSFORMAT FOR US ALL, THIS YEAR HAS BEEN INDEED THE ANNUS MIRIBILIS<br />
ORY OF AUSTRALIAN LABOR.<br />
Now DELEGATES, THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS<br />
ION FOR THE FUTURE OF AUSTRALIA ARE ENORMOUS,<br />
BUT EQUALLY SIGNIFICANT ARE THE IMPLICATIONS<br />
AS MEMBERS OF THIS GREATEST OF ALL PARTIES. </p>
<p>AND DELEGATES, WE SHOULD NEVER FALL FOR THE LINE<br />
THAT THE PURSUIT AND RETENTION OF POWER AND HOLDING TO OUR<br />
PR* INCIPLES ARE INCOMPATIBLE,<br />
THERE IS NO COMPROMISE OF PRINCIPLE INVOLVED<br />
IN COMING TO TERMS WITH REALITY.<br />
AND I THINK THE TRUTH OF THAT IS WELL ILLUSTRATED<br />
BY THE PROCEEDINGS AND THE OUTCOME OF THE SUMMIT CONFERENCE<br />
IN CANBERRA LAST WEEK.<br />
IT IS TRUE THAT ALL THE PARTICIPANTSGOVERNMENTS,<br />
UNIONS AND BUSINESS WORKED TO REACH A<br />
CONSENSUS; AND TO A QUITE REMARKABLE EXTENT, THEY<br />
SUCCEEDED IN DOING SO.<br />
BUT NO PARTY TO THE CONFERENCE WAS OBLIGED TO<br />
ABANDON ANY BASIC PRINCIPLE.<br />
THE UNION LEADERS IN PARTICULAR CARRIED OUT<br />
THE JOB -IN SPIRIT AND IN DEED -THE JOB FOR WHICH THEY(<br />
HAVE BEEN ELECTED BY THE UNION MEMBERSHIP -AND THAT IS,<br />
TO ADVANCE THE TRUE INTERESTS OF THE MEMBERS. </p>
<p>I,<br />
K -6-<br />
AND IF THE CONCLUSIONS REACHED ALMOST<br />
UNANIMOUSLY BY THAT HISTORIC CONFERENCE CAN BE MADE TO<br />
WORK EFFECTIVELY, THEN EVERY TRADE UNIONIST IN AUSTRALIA,<br />
EVERY AUSTRALIAN WORKER, WILL REAP THE BENEFIT THROUGH<br />
MORE JOBS, LOWER INFLATION AND BETTER STANDARDS.<br />
AND AT THAT CONFERENCE, THE TRADE UNION MOVEMENT<br />
DEMONSTRATED, FOR ALL AUSTRALIA TO SEE, THAT UNITY OF<br />
PURPOSE, AND A PRINCIPLED, BUT FLEXIBLE APPROACH TO BASIC<br />
ISSUES CAN ADVANCE THE INTERESTS, NOT ONLY OF THE MEMBERSHIP,<br />
BUT OF THE COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE.<br />
AND I BELIEVE THAT THAT IS THE APPROACH WE,<br />
AS A PARTY, HAVE TO BRING TO OUR OWN AFFAIRS, AND WHICH WE,<br />
AS LABOR GOVERNMENTS, HAVE TO BRING TO THE AFFAIRS OF<br />
THIS STATE AND THIS NATION.<br />
WE MUST NEVER ABANDON OR COMPROMISE ON OUR<br />
PRINCIPLES. ON THE CONTRARY, OUR TASK IS TO WORK TO ENSURE<br />
THAT THE BASIC LABOR PRINCIPLES THE BASIC PRINCIPLES OF<br />
REFORM, PROGRESS-AND EQUALITY ARE ENSHRINED NOT JUST IN<br />
THE PLATFORM OF OUR PARTY, BUT IN THE ATTITUDES AND NATIONAL<br />
CHARACTER OF OUR COUNTRY; AND TO ENSURE THAT THE IDEALS<br />
AND ASPIRATIONS OF THE AUSTRALIAN LABOR PARTY ARE THE IDEALS<br />
AND ASPIRATIONS OF THE AUSTRALIAN PEOPLE AS A WHOLE. ./ 7 </p>
<p>' 1 -7-<br />
AND I BELIEVE, THAT IN THE SPACE OF A SINGLE YEAR<br />
SINCE OUR LAST CONFERENCE, WE HAVE MOVED TOWARDS THAT<br />
GOAL MORE DRAMATICALLY, MORE RAPIDLY, MORE CLOSELY,<br />
THAN AT ANY TIME IN OUR PARTY'S LONG HISTORY.<br />
BRIGHTER THE LIGHT ON THE HILL BECKONS US ALL,<br />
THAN EVER. IT BURNS<br />
DELEGATES, ONCE AGAIN, I TAKE THIS EARLIEST<br />
OPPORTUNITY TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT, FOR YOUR WORK,<br />
FOR YOUR SERVICE TO OUR GREAT PARTY, AND THROUGH OUR PARTY,<br />
YOUR SERVICE TO OUR GREAT NATION.<br />
