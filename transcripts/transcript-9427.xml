SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING, MP<br />
OPENING OF THE OECD CONFERENCE " CITIES AND THE NEW<br />
GLOBAL ECONOMY"<br />
MELBOURNE, 21 NOVEMBER 1994 CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY<br />
Well, let me start by welcoming you to Australia.<br />
And let me say how pleased I am that this major OECD conference is taking<br />
place here in Australia.<br />
It's a welcome development not just because it provides us with an<br />
opportunity to showcase Melbourne and our many other great cities cities<br />
that some have called the most livable in the world but because it is one of<br />
the very few occasions that a major OECD conference has taken place in this<br />
part of the world.<br />
And clearly, it's the sort of thing that should happen more often.<br />
Over the years, the OECD has been criticised for being too Eurocentric in its<br />
focus, that it hasn't paid sufficient regard to the economic dynamism of the<br />
Asia Pacific region.<br />
And I think there has been an element of truth to the criticism.<br />
So the decision to hold this conference here in Australia, in the Asia Pacific<br />
region, is very much the right one because world attention is now well and<br />
truly focused on the Asia Pacific region.<br />
And in a way that it has never been before.<br />
Last week's historic APEC Leaders' Meeting in Bogor has made doubly sure<br />
of that.<br />
33154 </p>
<p>And while the full ramifications of the Bogor Free Trade Declaration won't be<br />
felt until well into the next century, I think history will come to judge the Bogor<br />
Meeting a most significant event.<br />
The fact that APEC has travelled so far in such a short period of time<br />
indicates the wish of this region to become the world's economic powerhouse.<br />
That, and the fact that the region already accounts for half of the world's GDP<br />
and almost half of world trade, makes this the right area of the world to hold a<br />
major OECD conference.<br />
Another reason why the location of this conference is right is because it's a<br />
conference on cities.<br />
Governments in this part of the world, and the Australian Government in<br />
particular, have a strong sense that building livable and sustainable cities is<br />
one of the greatest challenges we face.<br />
In fact, no region in the world has faster growing cities.<br />
From 1970 to 1990, Asian cities accounted for half of the world's total urban<br />
population growth.<br />
And they now total more than half of the world's 30 largest cities.<br />
Beijing, Bombay, Calcutta, Jakarta, Seoul, Shanghai, Tianjin and Tokyo<br />
already have populations close to 10 million or more.<br />
And they're set to grow even larger.<br />
One estimate has it that 80 per cent of Asia's economic growth this decade<br />
will take place in its major cities.<br />
This has staggering implications for urban population growth.<br />
For example, between now and the year 2000, China is estimated to add<br />
more than the entire population of the United States to its cities.<br />
Developments like these place an enormous responsibility on governments<br />
and urban designers throughout the region.<br />
Making sure you have cities that are functional seems to me to be<br />
fundamental to participating in the region's growth.<br />
But theres a bigger challenge and it is more than just making cities work.<br />
It's about building cities that will endure through the next century. 33,5 </p>
<p>And that, in many ways is a creative adventure, for, as the Australian artist<br />
Lloyd Rees once put it " Cities are the ultimate work of art".<br />
We may well wonder as to what makes a great city, or for that matter a world<br />
city. I think it's an almost indefinable thing.<br />
But you certainly know a great city when you're in one.<br />
Perhaps it's cities that are friendly, cities with generous public spaces and<br />
street faces that are welcoming.<br />
Cities like Melbourne and Sydney.<br />
Or perhaps it's cities that give their dwellers a sense of joy and involvementcities<br />
that are engaging.<br />
Whether it's the boulevards of Paris, New York's skyline, the buzz of Hong<br />
Kong, the raw energy of Shanghai or the splendour of Sydney Harbour,<br />
places of beauty and function really strike at the heart.<br />
A great city gives off its own resonances.<br />
A great city above all else has a soul.<br />
A city without a soul is a barren landscape that draws its sustenance from its<br />
people rather than the other way around.<br />
A great city nourishes one's sense of self, gives one a peace and a<br />
communion with the built environment.<br />
It creates a milieu which encourages endeavour and creativity, and<br />
achievement and peace.<br />
A great city's power comes from the power of its people, the intellectual life,<br />
the business of its people, their attitudes to one another, their attitudes to<br />
others, their principles their sense of mission.<br />
These are indefinable things but they are as real as the cityscapes<br />
themselves. The human relationship with cityscapes and the architecture is, I think,<br />
central to the chemistry of fulfilment and belonging.<br />
Ugly cities affront one's eyes and dull one's faith in the enlightened progress<br />
of our civilisation.<br />
3356f </p>
<p>Huge cities of cold monuments slashed by expressways depersonalise life<br />
and reduce one's self esteem.<br />
Inefficient cities wear people down and diminish the community's capacity for<br />
growth and wealth.<br />
By contrast cities of structure and beauty lift people up, engage them and<br />
encourage them.<br />
Planning has such centralised connotations these days yet without<br />
planning the developers often ignore the streetscape and sometimes leave<br />
their indifferent product and its problems to another generation.<br />
The traffic flows, the reliance on automobiles, the short half lives of buildings,<br />
the altered balance, the alienation lies in the wake of private reward largely<br />
unencumbered by civic pride or commitment.<br />
It seems to me that we have to consider our cities. Think about them, care for<br />
them, be proud of them, adapt them plan for them.<br />
Not sterile conformity to plan but enough structure to provide the form for the<br />
natural bacteria of the city to etch its pattern.<br />
This sort of approach informs the way we think about our cities in Australia.<br />
We want cities that are special places to live and great places to do business.<br />
You can see it in projects such as Southbank which lies just across the Yarra<br />
River here in Melbourne.<br />
As you will see, one of the best things about the Southbank development is<br />
that it provides a spectacular platform from which to view the city of<br />
Melbourne in much the same way that the Champs Elysee allows you to view<br />
Paris and the Statue of Liberty New York.<br />
It wasn't so long ago that this was a dilapidated industrial and commercial<br />
area. Those of you visiting our other cities will get a chance to see similar<br />
rejuvenation projects right around the country.<br />
I think it's also important to understand that despite the postcard images of<br />
Australia as a vast continent, we are in fact one of the most urbanised nations<br />
in the region with our cities accounting for 85 per cent of our total population.<br />
And not only is our population concentrated in the cities, it's also<br />
concentrated in a few major cities. 3 3 57" </p>
<p>Sydney and Melbourne alone account for almost half our total population and<br />
provide the great bulk of the nation's employment.<br />
These two cities which aspire to world city' status however you might<br />
define it are critical to the long term future of our nation.<br />
Increasingly, we are coming to realise that it is the quality of our cities, and<br />
our city networks, that are key to our ability to generate wealth.<br />
The growing recognition of just how important our cities are is borne out by<br />
some of the major Government programs now underway.<br />
There is the Better Cities Program and the Australian Urban and Regional<br />
Development Review which the Deputy Prime Minister spoke to you about<br />
earlier today.<br />
But there is another reason why we are now embracing our cities in a way<br />
that we never have before and that has something to do with a new and real<br />
sense of confidence.<br />
It's a confidence in our long term future, a confidence that, if we put our minds<br />
to it in the century coming, Australia could be one of the best places in the<br />
world to live and do business.<br />
And at this stage in our national history in the run up to the centenary of<br />
our nationhood I think it's also important that we step back a little and take<br />
a big picture perspective on how we can best tackle urban environment over<br />
the long term.<br />
That's certainly something that I have an interest in and it's part of the reason<br />
why late last year I decided to establish an Urban Design Task Force<br />
involving some of the nation's most eminent architects, planners, landscape<br />
designers and academics.<br />
My purpose in setting up the Task Force was a simple one: to find ways how<br />
we might improve the urban environment.<br />
The Task Force has just completed its report and I'm very pleased to formally<br />
launch it today.<br />
It's a good report which I know will be of great interest to the many people<br />
involved in urban design in Australia.<br />
I think the main reason it's a good report is because of what it will do to really<br />
push the national debate on how we can best foster quality urban design in<br />
this country.<br />
As I see it, the debate will be a very necessary and healthy exercise and one<br />
which I am looking forward to participating in.<br />
3358 </p>
<p>So, thank you very much to each of the Task Force members many of<br />
whom are here today for all you've done, particularly because you have<br />
given your valuable time on a voluntary basis.<br />
Let me also express my very deep personal appreciation to John Mant, the<br />
Convenor of the Task Force, who had the major task of bringing together the<br />
views of this diverse range of creative professionals.<br />
I trust our international visitors will allow me the indulgence to take up three<br />
key points from the report.<br />
First, to achieve excellence in urban design it's imperative that we draw<br />
together all those responsible for urban design, and I mean at every level of<br />
government. As the report points out, the fragmentation of responsibilities for urban<br />
planning at the local level makes it very difficult to allocate clear<br />
responsibilities. It's a case of everyone, and therefore no one, being ultimately responsible.<br />
And that makes it virtually impossible for the community to demand<br />
accountability for the management of its urban spaces.<br />
That, of course, is inimical to excellence in urban design and it, therefore,<br />
raises the big issue of whether we need a major restructuring of government<br />
agencies if we are serious about achieving high quality urban design<br />
outcomes that benefit all Australians.<br />
This is, of course, an issue that extends beyond the sole responsibilities of<br />
the Commonwealth Government and I will be writing to Premiers and Chief<br />
Ministers to see how we might work together on this issue.<br />
Second, at its heart, good urban design is a multi-disciplinary activity.<br />
I think this is something that not everyone involved in urban design fully<br />
appreciates. For too long, good urban design in this country has been frustrated by<br />
competing disciplines, professions, and government agencies which have<br />
approached the issue in a narrow way thereby leading to a less than optimum<br />
outcome. That needs to change.<br />
But I'm pleased to day some are getting it right. 33a59 </p>
<p>An excellent example is the Design Studio that will run for a week at the end<br />
of this month in Sydney.<br />
The Design Studio, which will develop urban design schemes for Homebush<br />
Bay for both the Olympics and up to the year 2020, is the largest design<br />
workshop of its kind to be held in Australia and the first ever for the Olympic<br />
Games. The Studio will take an integrated multi-disciplinary approach incorporating<br />
leading national experts and specialists from around the world some of whom<br />
are attending this conference.<br />
The third comment I wish to make is that we need to give appropriate<br />
recognition to the joint efforts that produce inspired and creative urban<br />
design. For this reason the Government intends taking up the Task Force's<br />
recommendation to establish an Australia Prize in Urban Design.<br />
This is a first in that it will reinforce the multi-disciplinary nature of quality<br />
urban design.<br />
Thats why the award will be not about individual projects but about places.<br />
It will recognise excellence in the building and sustaining of urban<br />
communities. It will recognise the achievement of the many individuals who create places<br />
that provide significant benefits to the environment and the community.<br />
Further details of the award will be announced in due course.<br />
So, those are some of my initial reactions to the Task Force report but, as I've<br />
said, you can rest assured I'll be having a few more words to say over the<br />
coming months.<br />
So how do we pull all these threads together'? What lies at the core of good<br />
urban design? How do we create livable cities in a global economy? How do<br />
we create great cities that people want to live and do business in?<br />
I think the best way we can answer these questions is to start by thinking of<br />
our cities and imagining something better.<br />
We want cities with both efficiency and beauty.<br />
Quality of life is just as much bound up with the development of cities as is<br />
economic advancement.<br />
3360 </p>
<p>Our cities must enable us to respond effectively to developments in the global<br />
economy. But they must also offer us a quality of life that enhances our work and<br />
recreational well being.<br />
They must be great places both to live and do business.<br />
The two go hand in hand. They're self -reinforcing, a virtuous circle if you like.<br />
Therefore, the way we manage and develop our cities is crucial to our<br />
economic future.<br />
It's crucial to our social future.<br />
And it's just as crucial to the quality of our environment.<br />
Getting it right is primarily a question of striking the right balance.<br />
We don't want cities that are monuments to Mammon but neither do we want<br />
cities that are museums of the past.<br />
We will try to strike the right balance in Australia.<br />
I am quietly confident that, with sufficient will and imagination on our part, not<br />
too far down the track people throughout the region will come to see<br />
Australian cities as ideal places both to live and do business.<br />
To an extent, that's already happened with the many international firms which<br />
have already set up their regional operations and regional headquarters here<br />
in Australia.<br />
Corporate executives in the Asia Pacific are coming to realise that if you live<br />
to work you'll work anywhere in the region, but if you work to live there's a<br />
good chance you'll choose to live in Australia.<br />
There's already many that have come to Sydney and Melbourne and there<br />
are an increasing number finding their way to Perth and Brisbane.<br />
This move is just starting to build up a head of steam and I'm sure that, come<br />
the next century, there will be many many more because our cities offer some<br />
things that our competitor cities never will and that's likely, I believe, to make<br />
our cities more sustainable over the long term.<br />
We have some great cities, but we want to make them even better.<br />
We want our cities to be more even hospitable, to be even more inviting. ~ 3U I </p>
<p>9<br />
We want cities that preserve the best of our past, that celebrate the best of<br />
the present and give a sense of the future.<br />
Cities that people live in because they want to and not because they have to.<br />
Organic cities, breathing, changing, living cities whose progress is infused<br />
with memory.<br />
So let me wind up by saying what a pleasure it is for Australia to host this<br />
major OECD conference on cities<br />
I am sure the conference will promote a greater understanding of how we can<br />
all build better cities in our respective nations, cities linked to the global<br />
economy but cities which are great places to live in cities by and for the<br />
people. Thank you. </p>
