SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
WORLD CONFERENCE ON RELIGION AND PEACE<br />
MELBOURNE 22 JANUARY 1989<br />
Your Excellency,<br />
Your Eminence,<br />
Your Grace,<br />
Honourable Presidents of the WCRP,<br />
Respected visitors and fellow Australians.<br />
On behalf of the Australian Government and people may I<br />
extend a very warm welcome to participants in the Fifth<br />
Assembly of the World Conference on Religion and Peace.<br />
Australia is honoured that you have chosen Melbourne as the<br />
site for your Conference, particularly as, after previous<br />
Assemblies in Kyoto, Leuven, Princeton and Nairobi, this is<br />
your first Assembly in the South East Asian and South<br />
Pacific regions.<br />
I have no hesitation in asserting that you will find in this<br />
city and this country an atmosphere which is most conducive<br />
to discussion of the difficult but vital issues summed up in<br />
your theme for this meeting " Building Peace Through Trust<br />
The Role of Religion"<br />
I say that with pride because there can be few countries<br />
that display a greater commitment to peace and tolerance, at<br />
both the official level and in the daily lives of its<br />
citizens, and both in international and domestic affairs,<br />
than does Australia.<br />
A formal demonstration of this fact was evident in the<br />
unique religious service which was held as part of the<br />
opening of Australia's new Parliament House in Canberra last<br />
year. It was a moving and important affirmation of the<br />
multicultural nature of our society that, in one of the most<br />
significant ceremonies of our Bicentenary Year, senior<br />
representatives of Christian denominations, along with<br />
leaders of the Jewish, Islamic, Buddhist and other faiths,<br />
and with representatives of Aboriginal Australians joined<br />
together to bless the new House and its proceedings. </p>
<p>Official ceremonies such as this are important in that they<br />
are a reflection of the realities of our society. And<br />
indeed Australia today is a multicultural and tolerant<br />
society in which people of many faiths and ethnic<br />
backgrounds live and work together in harmony.<br />
Four out of ten Australians were born overseas or have at<br />
least one parent born overseas half of them from<br />
non-English speaking backgrounds. Our population is drawn<br />
from over 130 nationalities and cultures. Almost all the<br />
major world faiths are established and practised in<br />
Australia, complementing the profound spiritual traditions<br />
of our country's original inhabitants.<br />
Churches and temples, synagogues and mosques, worshipping<br />
places and sacred sites play a significant part in the daily<br />
lives of many Australians.<br />
More broadly, Australians have shown themselves remarkably<br />
successful at building a society which is capable of finding<br />
peaceful means to deal with potential conflicts.<br />
Differences of opinion are of course as they should be<br />
firmly entrenched and vigorously expressed not least in<br />
politics. Cultural diversity is proudly maintained and<br />
articulated. But we have been much better at resolving those differences<br />
through peaceful and constructive means than we are at<br />
building barricades and shedding blood.<br />
I do not pretend that dark and divisive forces and<br />
under-currents do not exist in Australia, as they do in all<br />
countries. But I take pride in the capacity of Australians<br />
in daily life to find the common ground, the mutual<br />
interest, and to build on those shared values, rather than<br />
perpetuating differences in a way that advantages no-one and<br />
disadvantages everyone. In that way we are giving daily<br />
meaning to those traditional and justly famous impulses of<br />
the Australian character towards egalitarianism and a fair<br />
go. This capacity is as apparent in our international<br />
relationships as it is in our domestic arrangements. We<br />
have not been afraid to fight in defence of freedom. But we<br />
are proud too of our record of contributing to the<br />
negotiations of the great international councils, our role<br />
in keeping the peace in trouble spots around the world, our<br />
efforts to achieve disarmament.<br />
Over the last twenty years your members have also carried<br />
out valuable work in pursuit of world peace and in the<br />
protection of human dignity. Your mission is all the more<br />
impressive because it has brought together representatives<br />
of the world's major religions, united in these common<br />
causes of crucial importance to the improvement of human<br />
existence and, ultimately, to the survival of life on this<br />
planet. </p>
<p>3.<br />
So as Prime Minister I am grateful for your invitation to<br />
open this Conference. It provides an opportunity to welcome<br />
you to Australia as individuals and representatives of<br />
groups that are deeply concerned about important issues<br />
facing mankind; it allows me to offer the perspective of the<br />
Australian Government on some of those issues and to compare<br />
our views with yours; and it provides the opportunity<br />
perhaps to suggest ways in which we can do more to achieve<br />
the goals we share.<br />
The first thing that has to be noted before such an audience<br />
is that, since the last meeting of the World Conference on<br />
Religion and Peace, held in Nairobi in 1984, there has been<br />
a considerable improvement in the international environment<br />
in which we operate-.<br />
No one should pretend that all of the rivalries and tensions<br />
that have characterised the international political and<br />
economic systems since the conclusion of the Second World<br />
War have been resolved.<br />
Nevertheless, there are grounds for viewing the current<br />
world outlook with some optimism.<br />
In many dimensions, peace is being built through trust.<br />
Between the superpowers, we have seen the gradual emergence<br />
of a constructive relationship which has led, for the first<br />
time, to negotiation of an arms control treaty which<br />
eliminates an entire class of nuclear weapons.<br />
Within the Soviet Union itself, we have seen with President<br />
Gorbachev's programs of perestroika and glasnost a long<br />
overdue and still incomplete, but nevertheless very<br />
encouraging, movement away from the repression and<br />
inflexibility that for too long characterised the Soviet<br />
system.<br />
Noteworthy improvements in human rights, including the<br />
fundamental right to profess and practise religious faiths,<br />
are in train. We acknowledge what is being done to improve<br />
the lot of Soviet Jews and Christians. We look to further<br />
progress. Of course much remains to be done by the Soviet Union and<br />
its allies, and their current levels of performance are<br />
variable. We in Australia, as I have said on a number of<br />
occasions, will judge the Soviet Union by its deeds, not<br />
words. The same applies to the East European allies of the<br />
USSR. Yet these developments are starting to bear fruit in a<br />
number of areas. The Soviet occupation of Afghanistan is<br />
coming to an end. The Gulf War is over. The Vietnamese<br />
occupation of Cambodia may be drawing to a close. </p>
<p>With all this, we now look to resolution of that most<br />
intractable of regional disputes, the Arab-Israeli dispute<br />
in the Middle East.<br />
The super-power relationship provides a favourable<br />
international background.<br />
Important regional participants, particularly Egypt and<br />
Jordan, are demonstrating flexibility and good will.<br />
The recent statements by the Chairman of the PLO are major<br />
steps in the right direction.<br />
We hope that the new Government of Israel will respond<br />
positively to the improving environment.<br />
All of us here, I am sure, want to see the day when Israel<br />
and its neighbours can live in peace and constructive<br />
harmony, and when the Palestinian people in the Occupied<br />
Territories achieve the self-determination and human rights<br />
which are legitimately theirs.<br />
In all this, Australia has sought to play an active and<br />
constructive role. We do not pretend, as a middle-ranking<br />
nation, that we have a decisive influence on dangerous and<br />
complex global issues such as these.<br />
But because the goals of world peace, arms control, human<br />
rights and social justice are of fundamental importance we<br />
do have a responsibility to act to the limit of our<br />
capacities. This we proudly claim to have done.<br />
We have been actively involved in making an effective<br />
contribution to the cessation of the nuclear arms race and<br />
to the reduction in the size of the nuclear arsenals.<br />
We have actively supported initiatives to end all forms of<br />
testing of nuclear weapons; to ban chemical weapons; to<br />
prevent an arms race in outer space; and to encourage<br />
restraint in the international arms trade. We gave high<br />
priority to observing the International Year of Peace in<br />
1986 and in this we were joined by many Australian<br />
churches and we are still seeing the fruits of those<br />
labours. I quote with pride the words of the Secretary General of the<br />
United Nations Conference on Disarmament, Mr Komatina, who<br />
told me in Geneva in 1987 that the cause of international<br />
peace and disarmament would be further advanced if other<br />
nations had shown the same political commitment and<br />
technical expertise as Australia.<br />
The Australian Government has also attached high priority to<br />
the protection and promotion of human rights. Human rights<br />
know no boundaries; we regularly raise our concerns about<br />
human rights abuses with a wide range of countries,<br />
incluidng our regional neighbours and close allies as well<br />
as countries further afield. </p>
<p>The standards we espouse are established by international<br />
instruments such as the Universal Declaration of Human<br />
Rights. We actively participate in the monitoring of<br />
existing human rights standards, and their future extension,<br />
by international agencies such as the United Nations. In<br />
calling on all countries and governments to observe these<br />
internationally-accepted standards, I know I speak with your<br />
full support. The role of churches throughout the world in<br />
advancing the cause of human rights, often in situations<br />
where churches and church people themselves face repression,<br />
has been an inspiring and constructive contribution to<br />
individual freedoms.<br />
I want to take this opportunity to welcome the recently<br />
concluded East-West " agreement covering human rights<br />
negotiated in Vienna. This positive development is a sign<br />
of the importance of Human Rights in international affairs<br />
today, and of the growing improvement in relations between<br />
the world's two major ideological camps.<br />
Maintaining an active human rights policy is not an easy<br />
course for any government. There are dangers of seeming to<br />
interfere in the internal politics of other nations, or of<br />
giving offence to those with whom we wish to maintain<br />
friendly relations. But our end objective is to help<br />
individuals suffering from abuse, and I believe that<br />
Australian involvement in human rights issues does have this<br />
effect. Ladies and gentlemen,<br />
Within this broadly optimistic overview, there are of course<br />
a number of persistent and intractable problems which will<br />
continue to engage our attention in the years ahead. Let me<br />
deal with one of the most important ones today: the tragedy<br />
of South Africa.<br />
I want to express a special welcome to the large<br />
representation at this Conference from Southern Africa and<br />
the attendance by such strong exponents of justice in that<br />
region as Archbishop Trevor Huddleston.<br />
The Australian Government stands proudly at the forefront of<br />
nations opposed to the abhorrent regime of apartheid, which<br />
continues to impose fundamentally unjust measures on the<br />
majority of South Africa's people on the untenable basis of<br />
race. The continuing political polarisation in South<br />
Africa, and the repression and violence that result from it,<br />
are both morally unacceptable and, ultimately, can only work<br />
to the disadvantage of all South Africans, white and black.<br />
Successive Australian Governments have condemned the<br />
policies of apartheid and called for the initiation of a<br />
genuine process of negotiation between authentic<br />
representatives of South Africa's people and the<br />
establishment of a non-racist democratic system. </p>
<p>In this, we recognise the vital role played by the South<br />
African churches. Names such as Desmond Tutu and Alan<br />
Boesak have become synonymous with courageous and principled<br />
moral leadership in the face of threats and repression.<br />
In the absence of the South African authorities coming to<br />
the negotiating table, the Australian Government believes<br />
that comprehensive mandatory economic sanctions are<br />
necessary. Australia has been urging South Africa's major<br />
trading partners to adopt such a policy since the<br />
effectiveness of sanctions depends very much on their widest<br />
possible adoption.<br />
In the meantime, Australia has put into effect the full<br />
range of sanctions adopted by Commonwealth countries and,<br />
through the Commonwealth Committee of Foreign Ministers on<br />
Southern Africa, is examining ways to widen, tighten and<br />
intensify economic and other pressures on South Africa.<br />
We also decided last year to increase substantially our<br />
program of assistance to Southern Africa to a total of $ A100<br />
million over the three year period 1987-90.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen,<br />
It would not be appropriate if I limited my comments in this<br />
address to the international scene. As host country to this<br />
Conference, Australia can expect to come under scrutiny for<br />
the way we manage our domestic affairs. I have already said<br />
that you will find a positive atmosphere in this country for<br />
your discussions. I want to pay tribute to the positive<br />
role the Australian churches have played in creating that<br />
atmosphere. In countless thousands of ways the churches of Australia are<br />
working to create a fairer and a better society.<br />
From the earliest colonial times churches have played an<br />
important part in the development of Australian society.<br />
Their early involvement in teaching laid the foundations for<br />
our dual education system.<br />
Today, with their hospitals and nursing homes, their<br />
services for the homeless and disabled, their charitable<br />
work on behalf of those who cannot help themselves,<br />
Australia's churches are proving through their actions the<br />
depth of their commitment to social justice.<br />
My Government proudly acknowledges that service and<br />
commitment as an essential adjunct to its own programs, and<br />
to those of the Australian States.<br />
This is a very appropriate occasion too, to place on record<br />
my thanks to those Australian churches which suggested and<br />
developed last year's important Parliamentary initiative on<br />
behalf of Australia's Aboriginal and Islander population. </p>
<p>At the start of our Bicentennial year, just over twelve<br />
months ago, the Heads of the Australian Churches issued a<br />
statement entitled " Towards Reconciliation in Australian<br />
Society". This excellent initiative led directly to the<br />
first action of the Australian Parliament in our new<br />
building the passing of a resolution acknowledging the<br />
prior occupation of Australia by Aborigines and Torres<br />
Strait Islanders and their subsequent dispossession and<br />
dispersal, and expressing the determination of the<br />
Parliament and of the Government to promote reconciliation<br />
with those people.<br />
Finally, and of great importance, I want to recognise the<br />
vital role of the Australian churches in promoting the<br />
values of racial equality and tolerance in Australia.<br />
In a Statement to the Nation in August 1988, the Uniting<br />
Church in Australia affirmed:<br />
We rejoice in the vision of a multicultural society<br />
where peoples may live together in unity and<br />
diversity, maintaining different cultural traditions,<br />
yet forging a common destiny based on commitment to the<br />
ideals of equality of opportunity, tolerance, justice<br />
and compassion."<br />
Those words would find endorsement in the hearts of all<br />
Australians of good will.<br />
There are, regrettably, racist elements in our community who<br />
have tried to poison the atmosphere of our community life;<br />
some churches and individuals have at times been victims of<br />
these unacceptable and ugly extremists.<br />
However the articulate moral leadership provided by the<br />
churches has been an important factor in encouraging the<br />
maintenance and growth of cultural tolerance throughout the<br />
community.<br />
Australians are simply not prepared, as a community, to<br />
adopt or endorse racist practices and procedures in any area<br />
of our public life. The churches can take special credit<br />
for the endurance of this fact.<br />
So in this international forum I want to pay special tribute<br />
to the outstanding and forthright defence, by the Australian<br />
churches, of the values of tolerance during the recent<br />
debate on immigration and multiculturalism.<br />
My friends,<br />
There are many great challenges that still lie before us.<br />
In too many parts of the world, too many people still live<br />
under appalling conditions of poverty and hunger.<br />
Too many innocent civilians suffer in too many senseless<br />
regional conflicts. </p>
<p>And, despite recent progress in arms control and<br />
notwithstanding the promise of further reductions in the<br />
arsenals of nuclear weapons, we still face the awesome<br />
prospect that all our achievements, and all the achievements<br />
of those before us, may be obliterated in nuclear<br />
armageddon. To some, these challenges seem insuperably complex.<br />
But that must not be our response.<br />
We must not succumb to the paralysis of despair; we must not<br />
shed our obligation to ourselves and to future generations<br />
because progress towards building a saner and a safer world<br />
seems unattainable, or glacially slow.<br />
Progress will be slow. But we must learn never to abandon<br />
the gradual, hard, grinding task of constructive<br />
negotiation, positive collaboration, peaceful growth.<br />
Today I have spoken a great deal about what this Government<br />
has done, and about what you and your constituent members<br />
have done, to build peace through trust.<br />
Let me now declare this Conference open by expressing the<br />
hope that where, in the future, you feel political leaders<br />
can and should do more, you will not fail in your obligation<br />
to make your views known.<br />
Equally, it is my hope that where we see eye to eye we will<br />
be able to continue working towards those precious goals<br />
that we share. </p>
