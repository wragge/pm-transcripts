FOR MEDIA TUESDAY 22 JANUARY 1980<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF DOORSTOP INTERVIEW TREASURY PLACE MELBOURNE<br />
Question Do you expect any decision to be made either today or this week?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
We will be reviewing the context in which both Andrew Peacock<br />
is going to Asia, India and Pakistan, and I am going to America<br />
and Britain, and we will make any decisions that are necessary<br />
for that. It may be that some decisions ought to wait until we<br />
both return. So, I am just giving you caution. We are both<br />
embarked on important consultations and some decisions would...<br />
clearly be better made after we both return from this visit.<br />
