PRIME MINISTER<br />
VISIT TO INDONESIA, SINGAPORE AND MALAYSIA<br />
SINGAPCRE PRESS CLUB LUNCHEON<br />
Soeech by the Prime Minister, The Rt Hon.<br />
' illCiam Mchon, CH, MP. JUNE 1972<br />
SMr Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen of the Press and Guets<br />
I am honoured to address the Singapore Press Club today. I am<br />
your guest in opulent surroundings and I now believe what I have often<br />
suspected that at least here pressmen live better than politicians<br />
in Australia. Thank you for your welcome. It is good to be here. I do not<br />
need to tell an audience of your experience that the world is moving<br />
pretty fast under the impulso of technological, economic, social and<br />
political changes. These changes are grist to the mills of the oress.<br />
And through your craft, you mirror the times ir which we live.<br />
The changes are new-. s for you. They are basic problems for the<br />
politician. The factors external to one's country are among the most<br />
difficult for a Prime Minister to contend with, so foreign affairs<br />
and defence policies tend to be high on the list of my preoccupations.<br />
And for that reason I have welcomed the talks I have had with<br />
Mr Lee and his Ministers on these matters. They were frank and<br />
free, and I found them tremendously helpful and informative. So, today,<br />
I want to put to you some thoughts about recent international developments.<br />
I want to define Australia's policies in the light of some df<br />
these developments. It is a truism that the -ctions and policies of the larger<br />
powers have, since the last ,. orld war, and particularly in the past<br />
few years, brought about an extremely fluid political situation in<br />
Asia. The European countries, and the military strength with which<br />
they protected their colonial assets, have in large measure withdrawn.<br />
China, consolidated under communist rule, and for long intent upon<br />
internal problems, has rightly taken its place in the United Nations.<br />
Peking has been visited by the Presi. e'nt of the United States. And<br />
this has been followed by a visit by President Nixon to Moscow. / 2 </p>
<p>Japan is developing rapidly and has become a major industrial<br />
and economic power. The Indian Sub-Continent remains beset with<br />
unique problems, and a new member of the community of nations,<br />
Bangladesh, has been born. Australia gave early recognition to<br />
this new nation. The Soviet Union has shown increasing interest in<br />
the Sub-Continent, in South-East Asia and the Indian Ocean.<br />
The United States, beginning with the Guam Doctrine, and its<br />
progressive withdrawal of ground forces from Vietnam, has given<br />
clear notice to countries of the region that there is a limit to<br />
the burden that American will carry alone. So we have to ask how<br />
these developments affect Australia, where do we stand, and what<br />
initiatives have we taken and what we will do.<br />
Mr Chairman, it is hardly necessary for me to say that we encourage<br />
and welcome the independence and freedom of countries of Asia and the<br />
Pacific. That is a cardinal principle with us in our foreign relations.<br />
I digress here, if I may, to emphasise two matters of special<br />
importance to us.<br />
One is that Australia has recently joined with several newly-<br />
Sindependent South Pacific countries and New Zealand in the Pacific<br />
Forum. Here, at the highest political level, the many problems of<br />
the South Pacific area will h. regularly discussed and mutual solutions<br />
devised. The other matter is that, in accordance with the wishes of its<br />
people, Papua New Guinea ( which embraces an Australian Territory and<br />
a United Nations Trust Territory will very shortly become internally<br />
self-governed and, perhaps not much later, independent.<br />
We hope that other countries will recognise the needs of this<br />
emerging country and will be nreDared to assist the products of Papua<br />
New Guinea to enter international markets more freely.<br />
To return to my main theme, Australia has welcomed the signs of<br />
some thaw in the relationship between China and the United States and<br />
Sof China's readiness to play a fuller part in international affairs.<br />
While Foreign Minister of Australia, and well before President<br />
Nixon's significant and praiseworthy visit to Peking, I had made a<br />
critical re-examination of Australia's China policy, and had announced<br />
our objective of starting on the road to normalise our relations.<br />
We welcomed the seating of China in the United Nations and supported<br />
its accession to permanent membership of the Security Council. At<br />
the same time, we made it clear we were not prepared to abandon our<br />
friendship with Taiwan. l<br />
We are, through various contacts, seeking to establish a dialogue<br />
with China designed to load eventually to the normalisation of relations.<br />
We are also active in the development of two-way trade. In<br />
all this, of course, Australia's national interest is paramount.<br />
We are watching closely China's actions and policy statements,<br />
especially relation to tts declared support for so-called " Wars of<br />
National Liberation". But if we could be convinced by actions as well<br />
as words that China is willing to live at peace with countries with<br />
different social systems, then the uncertainty and anxiety of Australia<br />
and other countries of the region would undoubtedly be reduced. / 3 </p>
<p>The recent visit of President Nixon to Mosco and the results which<br />
so far have been made known also give support to the idea that the<br />
great powers are moving away from confrontation to negotiation and<br />
detente. It is too early, however, to predict with any confidence the<br />
effects of " The Summit" on the various trouble spots in the world<br />
like Vietnam and the Middle East.<br />
Perhaps the most important conclusion is that both sides appeared<br />
to recognise the over-riding importance of not allowing commitments<br />
to third parties to prejudice the vital national interests of both<br />
sides. I<br />
So far as our relations with Russia are concerned, the Australian<br />
Government wants to develop a more normal relationship with thd Soviet<br />
Union. We want to expand mutually beneficial areas of co-operation<br />
such as trade and scientific and cultural exchanges, and the interchange<br />
of visits with Soviet officials. So far the trends have been<br />
somewhat favourable.<br />
Despite these trends, and recognising the legitimate interests of<br />
the Soviet as a world power, we have watched with some concern the<br />
increasing Soviet interest and influence in the Indian Ocean. We do<br />
not think that 1eir oresence constitutes -an immediate and hostile<br />
threat from their naval ships in that ocean. But the increasing<br />
Russian presence is a fact of growing importance to Australia.<br />
Strategically, the Indian Ocean links us to our nearest neighbours<br />
to the North, the coutnries of South-East Asia. We do not want to<br />
see naval or any other form of military competition develop between<br />
the great powers in the area. But we think the Russian activity in<br />
the Indian Ocean is sufficiently significant for us to consult with<br />
the United States and Britain. We believe these two countries share<br />
our concern.<br />
This brings me to Australia's relationship-with the United States<br />
of America. We continue to enjoy what I believe to be a very cordial<br />
and beneficial relationship. The United States has given powerful<br />
leadership in the free world. It has shown courage and determination<br />
in Vietnam, and it has shown clearly that it will not desert its<br />
friends, S<br />
We regard -our own relationship with America as of crucial importance.<br />
This is in no way incompatible with our pursuit of an independent<br />
policy in this region or elsewhere. In fact I believe it is<br />
heloful to the stability of the region that we have this close relationship.<br />
The ANZUS Treaty, as you know, joins us with the United States and<br />
New Zealand in an intimate defence relationship. It is one enduring<br />
expression of the mutual trust and goodwill between us.<br />
Our experience in two world wars, and the events of the 1930' s<br />
and 1960' s brought home to us, as a medium-sized power, the concept<br />
that countries, like people, have a right to security, and that<br />
people and nations are stronger through collective action taken<br />
under and in accordance with the principles of the Charter of the<br />
United Nations. We have, since World War II, demonstrated, through<br />
collective security arrangements under the Charter of the United<br />
Nations, our beliefin this concept. / 4 </p>
<p>I believe also that we should be flexible in pursuing defence<br />
assistance and co-operation under the arrangements we have made with<br />
Singapore, Malaysia, Britain and New Zealand. The five Governments<br />
agreed on measures appropriate to their respective needs and interests<br />
in 1971. It was understood then, and is understood, now, that the forces of<br />
the three external countries will remain in Singapore and Malaysia<br />
for so long as the Governments concerned see this as in their interests.<br />
Australia will at all times honor its obligations. My Government<br />
believes that the Five Power Arrnaements will contribute to stability<br />
here, and fill a vacuum. I would stress the continuing relevance and<br />
importance of these Arrangmenets and the significance of the physical<br />
presence of our forces in Singapore and Malaysia.<br />
It goes without saying that Indonesia, Singapore and Malysia and<br />
other countries of South-East Asia to our immediate north are of great<br />
strategic and security interest to Australia. Our concerns are related<br />
less to the immediate security situation than to the fact that the<br />
long-term peace and security of the South-East Asian region is important<br />
to Australia. It is imortant, too, that 7ustralia should maintain an individual<br />
and constructive interest in the politico-economic development of these<br />
countries, and especially to develop relationships with them which<br />
Swill promote economic growth and increased opportunities for mutual<br />
dev-lopment.<br />
My Government accepts and, within the limits of our resources, has<br />
for a number of years been oursuing policies d. signud to achieve these<br />
objectives. I think I can fairly say that we have, as a result,<br />
developed a particularly close bilateral relationship with each of<br />
the Governments of Indonesia, Singapore and Malaysia, a relationship<br />
which encompasses a web of mutual concerns and interests across a<br />
wide range of official and non-governmental activities.<br />
ASu stralia has since 1950 provided many millions in aid to development<br />
countries. This has been not loan aid but grant aid, and aid<br />
without strings. We do not ask for debt payments. Let me say frankly<br />
that we have developed such aid programmes not solely for humanitarian<br />
reasons nor through a fear of communism.<br />
I Our basic motivation has been our belief that Australia's stability<br />
and prosperity are closely tied to the stability and prosperity of our<br />
neighbours, and that this in turn depends to a large extent on economic<br />
development and the satisfaction of the needs and wants of the peoples<br />
concerned. Looking at the general field of international trade and economic<br />
development, we have closely watched the evolution of the ' European<br />
Economic Community. With the development of that Community and the<br />
entry of Britain into that Community, Australia has, in its own<br />
interest been seeking for some years to diversify its export trade<br />
and particularly to build up markets in Asia.<br />
We have been successful. Now about 42 per cent of our exports go to<br />
Asia. As part of this orocess, there has been a steady expansion of<br />
mutual trade with countries of South-East Asia, as well as agreement<br />
on joint projects and Australian investment. </p>
<p>In the reverse direction, there has been some investment in Australia,<br />
and I am sure that these reci~ rocal trends w,-ill intensify during the<br />
coming years. A11s a t%. rFding natioin, Piustralin has traditionally followed<br />
policies designed to encourage liberal multilateral trade, but we have<br />
also recognised the speci al problems of the develoning countries in<br />
seeking tro gain markets for theii products, and hava acted to give<br />
prefor--ntial access in tho 1Au-tralian market to a '&amp; road range of<br />
thoso products.<br />
T'Aere: are othar areas of mutual interost I could discuss such as<br />
civil aviation, telecommunications nnd tourism, education, cultural<br />
and sporting exchanges. In rill of these, Australia is becoming more<br />
closol:&gt; involved in the affairs of South-East Asia.<br />
MyIcnldei hswy I want to stress the imoortance<br />
Austr '. JAa attach-es to the growth of regional co-operation. Coopiaration<br />
on the basis of goodwill and mutual understanding.<br />
We ar. members of several rgiona-l organisrati., r') s, all of which in<br />
their own way are d~ signed to contribute to economic progress and<br />
stability in the region. They include the Colon'bo Plan, theAsa<br />
Develonment Bank and the Economic Commission for hAsia and the Far<br />
East. ( ECA2FE).<br />
1, Caiirman, while I have2 bh'n here, I have se~ en thie impressive<br />
building . which houfao the Regional English Lanquage Centre, and also<br />
Othoe Jurong Vocational Instituta. These arre the result-of the<br />
practical and far-sighted schomo e volved by the South-East A-' Sian<br />
Ministorsof Education, to whlich 17ustralia has lent cffoctive support.<br />
More broadly, we will -ritch with interest and will do what we can<br />
to encourage the activitie s of countries of Sout-East P. sia in seeking<br />
to bu~ ld1 new and more effectiv-: forms of co-operation.<br />
Win Australia, havoe also tzaklen an interest in prooosals being<br />
discus : cd by the ASFAN countries.:-F teo evolve arrangements which might<br />
leaed to the South-East Asian area being declardd a zone of peace and<br />
neutrality. T" ime will show the 1. est way, to-_ se. curPe stability and peace, and<br />
Lustrali~ i stands ready at all time-_ s to discuss . n-ea sures to help achieve<br />
thcsE! obje-ctives.<br />
0In conclusion, Gentlemen, I would repeoat thlat Australia is and<br />
must rnmaln involved in the ouh-as Asia~ ri area. Your security and<br />
stability affect our own security and ztability your prosperity<br />
affects our Prosperity.<br />
I hone and oxncct that we ccontinue to build and develop the mutual<br />
ancd1 friendly relationshins bet-we: n our Governments and between our<br />
neo-, Ies.<br />
The results can Le really rewarding. The conse-quences dramaitic;<br />

<p>QUESTIONIS ANJD ANSTWJ2:; S<br />
SINGIAPORE PRESS CLUB LUNCHEON-10 JUNE 1972<br />
Q. You have spoken of Australia's role in South-East Asia and<br />
of your interest in ASEAN. Do you think it is practical for<br />
Australia to seek members hip o~ f 1\ SEan or at least more closely<br />
associated with it C.<br />
PM'~ So far the~ intentions and obj e-ct'vus. of the ASEAN nations<br />
are to keep it clearly within the bounds of the South-East A7, sian<br />
countries themselves. They 4 ve not sought to invite us to<br />
beacome a membar, and althouglh we have taken a very definite<br />
interest in the activities of the ASEAN countries, and of ASEAN<br />
itself as an institution, we have not positively sought to<br />
berome a member and whon wyc h,-) ve asked various countries for<br />
thne reasons -% hy they blvethey should ? eon thcoir pre3sent<br />
meibershirn, we have boon nrenared to accept th~ kt. I believe<br />
it is Proper that tho~ countries thl-emselves sho-uld make up their<br />
own minds and I do not think it would bE prudent in our own<br />
interests if we tried, as it were, to exert on influence on them<br />
tI-o permit us to become a member.<br />
Q. The ALP immigration policy now is that 7people who migrato<br />
to Lustralia they do sc on a ba! is free of consideration of<br />
race, creed or colour. Do you agree with :. this principle<br />
PM only yesterday, talking to the Prime Minister of Singapore,<br />
I informed ' him that I had not come h-3re to take nart in Pa--rty<br />
politics in his country. That I hbelieve is a policy that ought<br />
to be ado'nted not only -by myself but by members of the<br />
Oppcsition as well. I have no intention of becoming embroiled<br />
in this sort of ;,' olitical struggle in Singapore. I like the<br />
place too much and I woant to comae back again.<br />
Q. If understand correctly, you consider your first line of<br />
defence is South-East Asia. Yo-u referred to what you called<br />
11ou generous offer" of military aid to Indonesia is this<br />
part of it<br />
PM I think31 there are many miore influences Involv,; ed in our<br />
relationshipT-with South-FstA, and aruicularly withi<br />
Singanore, Indones: LiI an tCnh ay~ dae fence ones. Because<br />
there is not only defence and security that are important I<br />
believe the relationshins therc are mutual and that our<br />
security is inextricably bound up, the one with the other, so<br />
we want the South-East 7I. sian countries, and narticularly those<br />
witil which 1we have co--onerated very closely in the ' past, to<br />
remain. -rec_ and inde. p-,-ndent. of course, security is one of<br />
the prirmary considerations. But equally, too, based on an<br />
araof peace, we want the whole of South-East Asia to develop.<br />
We wa-nt Indonesia 1we-waant the other countri es that I have<br />
mentiotibd !;-tha'Filininnes, the Thais, the Malays, we want<br />
them to be able to rnrovide decent standards of living, to be<br />
able to have a just and, I believe, a truly humanitarian society.<br />
We have tradD, and becaiusc with trade will also flow great<br />
wealth, so we want our trade relationshiPs to be improved. 12 </p>
<p>6 0 8 L<br />
And it, too, is a better means of being able to understand one<br />
another, and a better means of being able to understand the<br />
psyches and the motivating forces that move the various countries<br />
of South-East Asia, we want the cultural relations between our<br />
two countries to be improved as well. So, looking at this<br />
subject, I can't isolate any one element. I have to look at<br />
it in the most general way and then to be able to decide where<br />
our best interests lie. l1y colleague, the Minister for Foreign<br />
Affairs, said only yesterday " Our destiny is inextricably<br />
bound up with yours, and yours with ours", and I think in those<br />
words you will find a crystallisation of all that I think and<br />
all that I feel. And as my feelings in these matters are just<br />
as important on many occasions as the thinking process, could<br />
I say this to you again that there is one thing that I have<br />
found in the few days I have been out of Australia, in Indonesia<br />
and in Singapore, and that is the respect that is held mutually<br />
and the confidence that there is between the two groups of<br />
countries. I believe I go back _ refreshed and I use that word<br />
deliberately and I use it again I go back refreshed with<br />
the discussions I have had here because they have given me a<br />
great deal of confidence in the future security of this area<br />
and its destiny in terms of development and the future I hope<br />
it will offer to the neoples of the various countries I nave<br />
had the good fortune to sea.<br />
I have been based here for a couple of years, living in<br />
this region, and during those two years, the auestion that<br />
has been raised is the question that Asians always put to<br />
Australians about Australia's immiaration policy. I have been<br />
in some very embarrassing situations trying to explain our<br />
immigration policy. LToaving aside the party politics side<br />
of it, I am sure there are a lot of people here who would like<br />
to hear the Prime Minister of Australia say a word or two<br />
about the present immigration policy with regards to Asians.<br />
This is a subject that requires very sensitive handling, and<br />
I hope I will be able to handle it in precisely that way. I<br />
believe, first of all, in terms of conitutional principles,<br />
that every country has the right to determine its own policy<br />
whether it be us, whether it be India, whether it be France,<br />
Germany or any other country. Secondly, I have got to make<br />
it abundantly clear tha. t what we want in Australia is not<br />
only a big immigration programrme, because we have absorbed, well,<br />
certainly well over a million migrants in the course of the<br />
last few years I don't like to specify the exact number of<br />
years but it has takan place. And, consequently therefore,<br />
migrants from other countries have been welcomed in Australia.<br />
But we welcome them on t: is basis, and we want to be sure that<br />
migrants who come to us European, non-European or of partially<br />
non-European stock are capable of being integrated into our<br />
society and of becoming true Australians within a period of one<br />
generation. That is our policy. We have certain....<br />
Jwe try to determine the oace of ncn-Euroreans..... we have<br />
certain conditions we apply. I can't go any further than the<br />
statements I have made, not only in Australia but I made in<br />
Indonesia a few days ago. They are set out vely fully in a<br />
document that has been prepared by my I'inister for Immigration. / 3 </p>
<p>And if you want any further explanation of that policy, I will<br />
get copies of the document as many as you want sent to you<br />
so that there can be a full explanation given to the people<br />
of Singapore. We have our policy. We think it is humanitarian.<br />
We regard it as selective, but it is certainly not racist<br />
because la. st year we did nermit non-Eurooeans and part non-<br />
Europeans to come to Australia to the order of about 9 ,000<br />
people, clearly showing that it is a liberal policy and one<br />
designed to achieve the purpose I have mentioned and that is<br />
to ensure that those who come fit into our community, are<br />
good Australians and play ". their part along with the people<br />
who are there today in ensuring we move along steadily, progressively<br />
towards developments and towards policies that we<br />
regard as not only right and sensible but in the long term<br />
destined to help our own people and are humanitarian in<br />
content. In your discussions here and in Djakarta, what role have you<br />
and the representatives of both Governments been assuming that<br />
Japan will be playing in South-East Asia over the next decade<br />
Australia's attitude and I don't think it is up to me to<br />
be recording the attitudes of other c~ vernments that is for<br />
their Presidents Or Prime Ministers to do so you will forgive<br />
me for not entering into any controversy about this other than<br />
to say that I believe their attitudes on a wide variety of<br />
international affairs are much th; e same as my own and my<br />
Government's. Japan, undoubtedly, is a great power, a great<br />
eo-nnom. c power, and must in time assert increasingly powerful<br />
political influence throughout the Asian theatre, but I do not<br />
believe, at least in the foreseeable future or as far ahead as<br />
we can see that Japnn will become a military power. Second,<br />
we believe that is in the deen interests of Japan, the fundamental<br />
interests of Japan, that it must increasingly take its place<br />
as one of the agencies for develoment in the Asian theatre.<br />
And, consequently, not only must it increase trade in that area,<br />
but lend its material and its financial resources towards<br />
develonment projects there. We feel, too, that due to the Nixon<br />
initiatives not only in Peking, in the People's Republic, but<br />
also in Moscow that the whole of this area becomes as it were<br />
in the cauldron again. But I w-uld liTk to use-the words of<br />
Mr Lee Kuan Yew when he said " It is far too early at this<br />
moment to work out . what the impact of the rapprochement and<br />
detente between these three countries might mean in the Asian<br />
theatre. W'it until the winds have died down. Wait until the<br />
storms and tempests have abated a little bit.." and, particularly<br />
when the dust has abated, we can then have a look around<br />
and find out where it lies in our best interests. Of this I<br />
can assure you that in both cases, we have looked very carefully<br />
to think what the consequences might be, but as yet we look at<br />
various areas where we feel that progress might . be made and<br />
none of us is orepared to make a forecast at the moment of what<br />
the future is likely to hold, certainly in the immediate<br />
future in front of us.<br />
You said in your sneech you believed in collective security<br />
arrangements under the Charter of the United Nations. At the<br />
same time, you say you would like to have the South-East Asian<br />
area declared a zone of peace. Do you mean in the Asian<br />
context, Sir .4 ( C 63<br />
PC,-, x Z_ </p>
<p>to<br />
a-tL Z_<br />
PM Q. PM Q PM Yes. If the people of the ASEAN countries want peace and<br />
neutrality, yes we would give them whatever support we were<br />
capable of giving. But I , ant to emphasise that our attitude<br />
here is therefore directed towards the ASEAN countries seeking<br />
peace and neutrality. From my own point of view, I have to make<br />
this statement that when we are looking at this problem, of<br />
neutrality or zone of neutrality and peace, we would also beconsidering<br />
in which direction our vital interests lay. And<br />
under no circumstances would we be considering the renegotiating<br />
or the termination of such treaties as the ANZUS Treaty on<br />
which our future depends. But of course if it became a<br />
historical fact that we were asked to give direct support to<br />
the ASEAN countries in order to try and ensure that they were<br />
able to obtain a satisfactory and effective guarantee, international<br />
guarantees of security and integrity and right to live<br />
in peace and freedom, of course we would be willing to consider<br />
what kind of support we could provide in helping to achieve<br />
their objectives.<br />
Sir, you described your Government's immigration policy as<br />
being one based on humanitarian and non-racism. Can you tell<br />
me, Sir, why your Goverrnment discriminates against non-Europeans<br />
in its assisted passage programme.<br />
I don't like to use the word " discrimination", and frankly<br />
I think it is not a term that exactly defines our attitude at<br />
all. The second noint that I want to make about the policy of<br />
assisted nassages is thir. It is designed to ensure that we<br />
get people with the right type of technical background for the<br />
development of our own country. And it was designed at a stage<br />
when it would be critically imnortant that we try and encourage<br />
people with special skills to come there. That is the basis f<br />
of it, and it is in no sense discriminatory in terms of race,<br />
creed or colour. The second noint that I would have to say to<br />
you is this, that having put that as the basic policy of it,<br />
I am not the Minister for Immigration. While I can enunciate<br />
to you what general policy is, I am not an authority on details<br />
associate dwith that our assisted passage programme. What<br />
I do know is that while Biritain will be somewhat reducing,<br />
perhaps in time her contribution to assisted passages, we at<br />
least will be keeping up cur contribution at least as far as<br />
. it happens to be at the moment.<br />
What are your views on the current situation in Vietnamr<br />
please I do keen a pretty careful look at the cables that come<br />
through on Vietnam, and my mood changes between unadulterated<br />
pessimism and then slight optimism. I believe that the North<br />
Vietnamese have carried out an attack which at least in terms<br />
of intensity and severity is as great as the Tot Offensive.<br />
And they have had successes in Phuoc Tuy Province and in Kontum<br />
and An Loc, and makes it extremely serious and doubtful whether<br />
the northern provinces can be held and whether these territories<br />
could be retained by the South Vietnamese. But with the massive<br />
help of Americans supported by the strength of the American<br />
Administration under President Nixon, the South Vietnamese look as<br />
though they are turning the tide back. The centre of Kontum has<br />
now been cleared and is free of North Vietnamese troops. </p>
<p>Supplies are continuing to be given to them. The.. third<br />
division which was the source of all their trouble in Kontum<br />
and the approaches to Hue, has now been re-established and at<br />
least we can think this way. The South Vietnamese are now<br />
doing pretty well, much better than we cruld have expected a<br />
month ago. All I can do is t: o join with your own Prima<br />
Minister when he said he hoped the day would come when there<br />
could be a negotiated settlement. I hope that, too. When<br />
America could withdraw and withdraw without dishonour, and<br />
particularly those that remain in South Vietnam will be able<br />
to carry out our most precious ideal to determine their own<br />
future free from interference from outside and able to conduct<br />
their lives internally in the way the people themselves choose.<br />
Q The Straits of Malacca has become of late a fairly hot topic.<br />
The countries in the region, particularly Indonesia and<br />
Malaysia would like some form of control of the Straits to<br />
naval vessels. Some major maritime powers notably Japan and<br />
the Soviet Union, have ixpressed strong opposition to such<br />
restrictions. What, if any, is Australia's position on this<br />
issue<br />
PM I did have some very useful discussions with President<br />
Soeharto about the Indonesian's attitude to the Straits of<br />
Malacca and I think I know their attitude very well, so I<br />
understand the attitude of the Singaporeans, not only with<br />
regard to the limit of the territorial sea and the extension<br />
of jurisdiction from three to twelve miles, but also associated<br />
with the problems of nollution. Our attitude is a clear one.<br />
As yet, we have not made up our minds definitively as to what<br />
our policy should be but we are watching the problem very<br />
carefully and we think it is a matter when the United Nations<br />
Conference reconvenes on the law of the sea, that that is the<br />
annrooriate nlace for this nroblem to be discussed and where<br />
the final resolution sho. uld be made.<br />
Q Your Foreign Minister is saying that you have to see that<br />
in the Indian Ocean if the Russians do have a presence there,<br />
you would like to see the Americans have a counterbalance.<br />
Would you care to comment on that Ovr ~ c. R<br />
PM I would have to start off with this preface to you that the<br />
Indian Ocean, of course, is vital to us as it is vital to the<br />
United Kingdom and is of major importance to the United States<br />
as one of the two superpowers in the world. And what we want<br />
to ensure is that the Indian Ocean can remain an area where<br />
people can ply their trade and carry on their rights to a<br />
peaceful passage through that Ocean in accordance with their<br />
own national interests.<br />
We have, it is true, a feeling that we would like to see<br />
therefore, competition reduced to a minimum, knowing always that<br />
the great powers would never be prepared to give up their rights<br />
to move their navies into those oceans Ywhen they felt that<br />
their political interests were involved or their trading had<br />
to be supported. So what do we think We do not believe at<br />
the moment the presence of the Soviet fleets at any given moment<br />
of time present an immediate threat to the security of my own<br />
country. </p>
<p>PM ( cont'd) But we do know that they are capable of rapid mobilisation<br />
and think they could increase the strength of their merchantgoing<br />
fleets pretty rapidly and can support them by a float<br />
suonort and can let them carry on for a considorable period<br />
of time. So what can I say about this I, of course, would<br />
like to see the area in which neople can move freely without<br />
a great deal of worry or inconvenience from anyone else. I<br />
can't go any further than that at the moment. We are<br />
anxiously watching the position. We cannot see a position<br />
immediatley arising where this idea of the neutrality of the<br />
Indian Ocean is a likelihood, but nonetheless we will keep<br />
this under pretty careful control and will see whether in time<br />
we can't co-ordinate some efforts towards a greater degree of<br />
or a greater reduction of tension and uncertainty than we have<br />
at the moment. </p>
