    <content><![CDATA[<p>E&amp;OE....................</p>
<p>Prime Minister and Mrs Obuchi, other ministers of the Japanese Government</p>
<p> and other distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen.</p>
<p>Can I say first of all on behalf of my wife and myself and all of</p>
<p> the other members of the Australian party how very grateful we are</p>
<p> for your great courtesy and your great hospitality. Not only in affording</p>
<p> us this splendid dinner tonight but also the friendship that you have</p>
<p> extended to us since we arrived from Australia last night.</p>
<p>The relationship between Australia and Japan does have a very special</p>
<p> quality. It is a magnificent model to the rest of the world of how</p>
<p> two countries with vastly different cultures and very different histories</p>
<p> can come together and achieve through the pooling of their common</p>
<p> objectives and their common goals a great and broadly based friendship.</p>
<p>Japan is Australia's best customer. We value your custom. We strive</p>
<p> on all occasions to be reliable suppliers. We like to provide good</p>
<p> after sales service and if there are any customer complaints we like</p>
<p> to hear about them. But the relationship is more than an economic</p>
<p> relationship. It is also a deepening cultural and political relationship.</p>
<p> There are now literally tens of thousands of young Australians every</p>
<p> year in our schools who are learning the Japanese language. And through</p>
<p> that coming to know the culture of your country, the mysteries and</p>
<p> the intrigue and the fascinations of Japanese life. And that linkage</p>
<p> particularly through our young people is really the foundation of</p>
<p> the further growth and the further development of the relationship</p>
<p> between our two countries.</p>
<p>It is a relationship now which is very mature but there are a number</p>
<p> of people in this room tonight as there were at the luncheon today</p>
<p> who worked together in those years immediately after World War II</p>
<p> to build the foundation of the modern bilateral relationship. And</p>
<p> particularly the businessmen who worked so hard and produced such</p>
<p> very good results. And those of us who enjoy the modern maturity of</p>
<p> the relationship pay tribute and give due credit to so many of those</p>
<p> who trailblazed more than 40 years ago.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister and I today have talked extensively not only about</p>
<p> our bilateral relationship but we have also talked about the goals</p>
<p> that we share in common in our region. The importance of achieving</p>
<p> ever expanding trade horizons. The importance of helping the less</p>
<p> fortunate countries in our region rebuild from the adverse effect</p>
<p> of the Asian economic downturn. And I had the opportunity today, Prime</p>
<p> Minister, to say to you how much I admired the work that you in particular</p>
<p> have done to strengthen and revive the Japanese economy. And it is</p>
<p> clear already that benefit is being enjoyed by Japanese industry and</p>
<p> the Japanese people from the measures that your Government has undertaken.</p>
<p>The strength of the Japanese economy is not only important to the</p>
<p> Japanese people but the strength of the Japanese economy is of immense</p>
<p> importance to the region and the entire world. Japan is the second</p>
<p> most powerful economy in the world. Japan has played a major role</p>
<p> in the wealth and the prosperity not only of our region but of the</p>
<p> entire world over the last 30 years. And we follow very closely and</p>
<p> very encouragingly the leadership that your Government is giving in</p>
<p> bringing about a strengthening of the Japanese economy.</p>
<p>We have, as you know, undertaken a number of reform measures in Australia</p>
<p> and we are pleased with the strength of the Australian economy in</p>
<p> 1999. It is stronger now than it has been for more than 30 years.</p>
<p> We have the lowest number of industrial disputes in Australia for</p>
<p> almost 90 years. And we are an increasingly attractive country in</p>
<p> which to invest.</p>
<p>I do remember my discussion with Mr Takeshita at Kirribilli House</p>
<p> in Sydney. It was late in October, we did talk in a very lively fashion</p>
<p> about the goods and services tax. It was not only a lively discussion</p>
<p> but may I say from my part it was a relaxed discussion because it</p>
<p> was after the election and we had been returned. But that particular</p>
<p> meeting brought home to me the continuity of the relationship between</p>
<p> our two countries not only at a political level but at other levels</p>
<p> too because your colleague - and I know how close you have been in</p>
<p> political life - your colleague had served with very great distinction</p>
<p> in a large number of posts in the Japanese Government over a long</p>
<p> period of time. And I know that when he conveyed to me your personal</p>
<p> good wishes it was no mere diplomatic formality but it was a very</p>
<p> keenly felt personal communication.</p>
<p>So, Prime Minister, it is a real privilege to be here. The relationship</p>
<p> between our two countries continues to deepen, it continues to get</p>
<p> better. But importantly you never take those relationships for granted.</p>
<p> And today we have agreed on a number of things including a millennium</p>
<p> conference involving not only our political leaders but also our business</p>
<p> figures and our academic leaders to reflect upon what the character</p>
<p> of the bilateral relationship should be as we move into the next millennium.</p>
<p> And I am very grateful for your immediate and spontaneous endorsement</p>
<p> of that particular proposal.</p>
<p>So in thanking you, Prime Minister, and thanking you Mrs Obuchi for</p>
<p> your gracious hospitality to Janette and to both of us can I invite</p>
<p> all of you to join me in another toast. This toast will be to his</p>
<p> Majesty, the Emperor of Japan, to you Prime Minister, to your wife</p>
<p> and beyond that to the enduring friendship between the people of Japan.</p>
