PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR PRESS 26 JANUARY 1978<br />
PETROLEUM SUBSIDY SCHEME<br />
The Prime Minister announced today that Commonwealth legislation<br />
to provide for payment of a fuel price equalisation subsidy would<br />
be introduced shortly after the commencement of the forthcoming<br />
Parliamentary session. Because of the need for complementary<br />
State legislation he has written to the State Premiers seeking<br />
their cooperation in this matter and in making subsidy payments<br />
on behalf of the Commonwealth to the oil companies.<br />
The Government indicated in the election campaign that it would<br />
take action immediately after the election to implemen-t a proposal<br />
to subsidise the. freig-ht differential on motor spirit, power<br />
kerosene, aviation fuels and automotive distillate sold in<br />
country areas. The scheme proposed will be along similar lines<br />
to the one which operated from 1965 to 1974.<br />
Initially, the scheme will bring down the price of these<br />
products to less than one cent per litre ( 4 cents per gallon)<br />
above relevant city prices. It is further intended to lower this<br />
margin to less than half a cent per litre ( 2 cents-pergallon)<br />
in the life of the present Parliament.<br />
Preliminary discussions have-taken-place between Commonwealth<br />
officials and the oil industry marketing companies who have<br />
indicated general agreement with the scheme proposed by the<br />
Government. The actual date-of commencement of the scheme is dependent on<br />
necessary amendments to the complementary legislation being<br />
passed by the State. Parliaments.<br />
The Government is anxious that the scheme should commence as soon<br />
as possible so that the people in country areas will receive<br />
the benefits of reduced petroleum products prices.<br />
The Prime Minister looks forward to the cooperation of the<br />
State Governments in achieving this aim. </p>
