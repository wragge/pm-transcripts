PRIM MINISTER<br />
FOR PRESS+ 22 APRIL 1977<br />
ADDRESS TO THE AUSTRALIAN PROVINCIAL PRESS ASSOCIATION, ADELAIDE<br />
I am happy to be here tonight, talking to newspaper proprietors<br />
on a public occasion. I make the point about a public occasion<br />
because I am sometimes accused of spending too much time'<br />
talking to newspaper proprietors in private. Some people appear<br />
to believe I have a great deal of influence over what<br />
newspapers print. They have good grounds for this belief.<br />
You have only to look at some of the highly favourable headlines<br />
that regularly appear in our daily newspapers, editorials<br />
which are almost invariably full of praise for the government' s<br />
actions, or exceptionally flattering cartoon characterisations of<br />
me or my government, to gauge the full extent of my influence.<br />
This evening's function is also the kind of opportunity<br />
that politicians shiould gratefully accept a chance to talk<br />
directly to a large number of proprietors of newspapers<br />
that are published and printed in country areas all ove~ r<br />
Australia. In many ways, a newspaper is the single, most important institution<br />
in a country town. It informs, enlightens entertains; it<br />
often acts as a social conscience; it is always an integral<br />
part of a rural community. You know better than I that<br />
newspapers in rural areas are read as closely and eagerl. y<br />
as a letter from a friend. Their columns touch the personal<br />
lives of their readers much more than a large City Or na-tional<br />
paper could ever hope.<br />
Actually, I have made a contribution or two to the<br />
editorial columns of country newspapers over the years. Generally,<br />
I believe the quality of country newspaper has improved in both<br />
techniques and in terms of reporting.<br />
Newspapers, of course, are not meant to make politicians happy.<br />
There is not a politician alive who would admit that his<br />
only real enjoyment left in life was waiting for the morning<br />
newspaper to arrive. To plagerise some political words of<br />
wisdom, I think I have seen somewhere newspapers are niot meant<br />
to make life easy for politicians. On the other hand, I<br />
sometimes think that politicians were made to make life easy<br />
for newspapermen. </p>
<p>No newspaper can claim not to have had important political<br />
news to write in the last week or so. And it has not been<br />
just surface political controversy, but events which have<br />
been of historic importance. It is a rare occasion when the<br />
seven heads of government, of all political allegiances, canhowever<br />
fleetingly reach beyond partison politics and find<br />
a consensus on an issuc of national importance.<br />
The call last week by myself and all six Premiers for a three<br />
month halt in price rises and a matching halt in wage riseswas<br />
such an occasion.<br />
It had then, and I believe it still enjoys, the overwhelming<br />
support, of the Australian people. There is a national consensus<br />
that the fight against inflation and unemployment must be won.<br />
A price/ wage halt if, of course, only a supplement to the<br />
anti-inflationary strategy which the Commonwealth Government<br />
has pursued since taking office. But there can be no doubt<br />
that such a halt would hasten the success o'f that fight.<br />
The Commonwealth has played its part. We have sought support<br />
from all mnajor employer and employee organisations. We have<br />
halted all price rises by our own departments and authorities.<br />
We have asked the P. J. T. to defer all applications for price rise*<br />
Initially, the Premiers cooperated well, by conferring with<br />
employer and employee groups to encourage compliance,<br />
by authorising their consumer affairs departments and bureaux<br />
to monitor price rises, and by freezing state charges of all kinds.<br />
The -reaction from employers was excellent. There has been<br />
substantial compliance by all price-setters in halting price<br />
rises throughout Australia. At a meeting I had with twenty five<br />
national employer organisations, there was unanimous support for<br />
the call by the heads of government. The-Arbitration CommissioW<br />
last Tuesday recognised that employers had generally agreed to<br />
the price halt.<br />
All that was needed the last link that would have ensured<br />
the success of this popular initiative was some measure of<br />
support from the unions. But instead, what happened? In his<br />
appearance before the Arbitration Commission, Mr Hawke refused<br />
to support the agreement made by all the* Governments of Australia.<br />
Instead he made four proposals -you can judge for yourselves<br />
the merit they have.<br />
1. He wanted amendments to the P. J. T. In fact, the Government<br />
had agreed to appoint a special committee of employers, employees<br />
and the P. J. T. to advise on the implementation of the heads of<br />
government agreement, including examining whether amendments to<br />
the P. J. T. Act were necessary.<br />
2. He wanted a national conference to examine the whole Australian<br />
economy this had already been rejected by the Premiers<br />
Conference. 3. He offered to defer an application for a wage rise based<br />
on producitivty increases this was irrelevant in the next<br />
three months. .13 </p>
<p>4. Finally, he wanted a cut in direct taxes equivalent<br />
to the effectof the March C. P. I. increase in wages. This<br />
last proposal was clearly impossible. To use tax cuts to<br />
compensate the December quarter C. P. I. increase would have<br />
cost $ 1,600 million in tax cuts. It is impossible to give<br />
tax cuts of this magnitude and Mr Hawke knew it.<br />
Mr Hawke wanted a price freeze and enormous tax cuts.<br />
And what did he offer in return? Nothing, except caliling<br />
a union conference to consider whether the unions should<br />
forego the March quarter C. P. I. increase.' And even then<br />
he said he could not deliver the goods.<br />
It was reasonably clear at that stage that Mr Hawke only wanted<br />
to break the agreement. After all, in 1973, he and the ACTU<br />
had opposed the Labor Government's prices/ wages referenda,<br />
and taken the position that under no circumstances would the<br />
union movement accept a wages/ prices freeze.<br />
Sadly, and incredibly, Mr Dunstan and the two other Labor Premiers<br />
supported Mr Hawke despite the agreement they had signed the<br />
previous Wednesday. We tried hard to get Mr Hawke's su-3port.<br />
If he had been prepared to give an in-principle commitment to<br />
the objectives of the income prices freeze, there would have been<br />
a national conference. If Mr Hawke and his colleagues could<br />
not speak for their unions, I said I would accept a personal<br />
commitment. He would not even give that. Clearly there was little<br />
point in proceeding since he could not even give this minimal<br />
commitment. The initiative we have now taken is to ask the states to join with<br />
us in an approach to the Arbitration Commission. And we will be<br />
con ' sulting with the states about this in the next few days.<br />
Two Premiers have given their support, and we are consuLting with the<br />
other'heads of government.<br />
All business and other price-setters should hold prices until<br />
the outcome of this approach is known. One company Leyland<br />
announced price increases despite the call for a prices paulSe.<br />
The company's principal distributor Bryson Indulstriesis<br />
however, reported as not intending to pass on the price<br />
increases. This is most encouragi ng.<br />
The Government is nonetheless disturbed at Leyland's attitude.<br />
We think it should be known that. under the Prices Justification<br />
Tribunal Act there is a power to conduct an enquiry into the<br />
prices changes by a company. During this enquiry the company<br />
is not permitted to make any price increases at all. This shows<br />
that the P. J. T. is an effective instrument.<br />
In the national interest, the prices-income halt, must work.<br />
The wages/ prices halt would allow uis to overcome our economic<br />
problems more rapidly. That being so, it i~ s no substitute<br />
for sound economi~ c management. It is no Substitute for actions<br />
that we are taking in other areas of economnic activity<br />
where we have direct control. BUt it was an opportunity that<br />
was presented by the Premiers Conference that had to be<br />
grasped. An opportunity to break\ the inflationary wage/ price spiral.<br />
4 </p>
<p>The move has been supported right through the country by<br />
government, employer organisations, business firms, families,<br />
housewives, trade unionists people from all walks of life.<br />
The wage/ price pause does have clear and strong national support.<br />
Because it has this national support, it can still succeed.<br />
Given events such as the price/ income freeze and the importance<br />
of the economy, it is little wonder that economic issues<br />
are to the fore in newspapers. This however, distracts attention<br />
from government initiatives in other areas. Action, which is<br />
important, but less dramatic.<br />
In just seventeen months, the government has made a number of<br />
significant reforms enhancing the position of Australians<br />
as individual men and women. And moving towards a situation<br />
where Australians can realise their capacities to the full.<br />
We seek to increase the capacity of people to make their own<br />
decisions to choose. We do not seek to increase the power<br />
of government. We seek to give meaningful and effective assistance<br />
to-the disadvantaged in the community and not just to throw<br />
money at a problem andhope for some instant solution.<br />
In the matter of civil liberties, we have acted on a number o f<br />
fronts. A Human Rights Commission will be established.<br />
Its broad purpose is to promote individual rights and to make<br />
sure our laws are in line with the United Nations International<br />
Covenant on Human Rights.<br />
We will introduce a Freedom of Information Act that will give<br />
as a basic and fundamental right access to certain categories<br />
of government information.. The Attorney General plans to<br />
introduce this legislation which will lie on the table of the<br />
House for some time to allow for full and open debate.<br />
The Government has also decided-to implement the report of the<br />
Law Reform Commission on Criminal Investigation. This is<br />
a particularly important advance in civil liberties-for people<br />
detained for questioning, or arrested and charged with a<br />
Federal criminal offence.<br />
There have also been references to this Commission on the<br />
protection of privacy; the law of defamation; and investigation<br />
into the possibility of applying. Aboriginal Customary law<br />
in criminal matters to Aborigines living in the traditional way.<br />
An Administrative Appeals Tribunal has been set up, and the<br />
Commonwealth has appointed the first Ombudsman. The Government<br />
is also negotiating with the states so that legal aid is<br />
provided in the most effective manner possible. We believe<br />
this to be a fundamental right.<br />
Aboriginal land rights legislation for the Northern Territory<br />
has been passed a most significant advance for Aborigines.<br />
Cur predecessors spoke about Aboriginal Land Rights, but we acted. </p>
<p>All in all, this is an impressive list that demonstrates<br />
our commitment to maintaining the freedom and dignity of the<br />
individual. Importantly, it also demonstrates our capacity<br />
to effectively carry out our policies. We are determined to<br />
provide assistance to those most in need in a way that does<br />
not make people more dependent on government. T'o make people<br />
more independent to enhance their self-respect and<br />
dignity, not to destroy it.<br />
The indexation of pensions, for instance, automatically retains<br />
their real value. The family allowance scheme is of incalculable<br />
benefit to about 300,000 Australian families who did not<br />
get the full benefit from the old system of tax deductions<br />
merely because their incomes were too low.<br />
There has been. a re-orientation of child care programmes to<br />
give children of working mothers and single-parent children,<br />
adequate care. In this often controversial area, what we are<br />
seeking to do is to simply provide the circumstances in. which<br />
children are properly cared for.<br />
Our housing voucher experiment scheme that enables people<br />
eligible for assistance to choose their own housing is another<br />
example of our concern for individual freedom and choice.<br />
Realising that quite often government bureaucracies are unable<br />
to provide the kind of personal aid necessary, we have placed<br />
great emphasis on the work of voluntary organisations.<br />
We have for instance, initiated two significant experimental<br />
programmes with migrant communities.<br />
Migrant resource centres have been set up in Sydney and<br />
Melbourne to see if we can get more effective contact with<br />
migrants and get a better delive Iry of government services to<br />
migrants. I emphasis the programmes are experimental, but I believe<br />
they are well worthwhile and I am sure we will learn much from<br />
them. This Government will continue to apply this kind of<br />
approach to individual liberty and to those in need.<br />
We are also taking significant initiatives in the field of<br />
Constitutional reform.<br />
On 21 May, all Australian voters except those resident in the<br />
Territories will have the opportunity to vote on four referendum<br />
proposals to amend the Constitution. Unlike previous referendums,<br />
these proposals do not mean more power for Canberra; they do not<br />
diminish the power of the States. Rather, they are sensible,<br />
practical reforms to meet inadequacies in the Constitution which<br />
have become apparent over the years. / 6 </p>
<p>The first proposal is that there be simultaneous elections for<br />
both Houses. It is commnonsense that House of Representatives and<br />
Senate elections be held together. If this proposal is carried, j<br />
there will only be meaningful elections at which the country's<br />
government is at stake.<br />
If the proposal is not carried, we could have four Federal elections<br />
in the next four years; two of which could not alter the<br />
Government. The power of the Senate will be maintained all the<br />
States will continue to have an equal number of Senators; the<br />
Senate will retain the same power as it now possesses to defer,<br />
amend or reject ill-considered legislation.<br />
Simultaneous elections will mean that the Senate will more<br />
accurately reflect the latest will of the electorate. Thus<br />
conferring greater authority on the Senate to review government<br />
decisions. If the Senate uses its ultimate power to force the House of<br />
Representatives to a poll, at least half the Senators will,<br />
themselves, face the voters. The Senate will not be. immune from<br />
the consequences of its own actions.<br />
Some of our opponents claim that this referendum is unnecessary. 0<br />
That if I could only persuade the Governor General to call an<br />
early election for the lower House, elections for both Houses<br />
would be back in alignment. Even if a premature election for<br />
the House of Representatives was in the national interest which<br />
might not be the case this referendum is the only way to ensure<br />
that elections are always held simultaneously in the future.<br />
The second proposal is that a Senator whose seat falls vacant<br />
should be replaced by a person of the same Party and for his full<br />
term. This proposal ensures that your Party choice at a Senate<br />
election cannot be altered.<br />
The balance of the Parties in the Senate can be changed only by<br />
the voters, not by accident or manipulation. Because replacement<br />
Senators will be appointed for the full term of the Senator<br />
replaced,-room for manipulation will be curtailed. There will W<br />
be irio more Gair Affairs.<br />
This proposal has long been a convention. This referendum seeks<br />
to make that Convention law; to ensure your choice at each election<br />
is maintained. The next proposal is that voters in territories be permitted to<br />
vote at referendums. By historical accident, voters of the<br />
Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory are<br />
presently denied a basic democratic right. The right to vote in<br />
referendums, all of which affect them just like all other<br />
Australians. This proposal will overcome this anomaly. At Federation,<br />
Australians living in what are now the Northern Territory and<br />
the Australian Capital Territory, had the right to vote at<br />
referendums. This proposal simply restores that right which<br />
was taken away when the territories were created. 150,000 voters<br />
in the territories should not be treated as second-class citizens.<br />
7 </p>
<p>The fourth and final proposal is that High Court Judges should<br />
retire at the age of seventy; and that Parliament should be<br />
empowered to set a retiring age for other Federal judges.<br />
Most jobs in our community have retirement ages, for good reason.<br />
All State Judges are subject to a mandatory retiring age, in<br />
recognition of the fact that old age does impair ability. Judges<br />
are as affected by old age as everyone else. The independence of<br />
the Judiciary is still guaranteed; because judges will still have<br />
guaranteed tenure.<br />
They cannot be forced to resign just because their judgements may<br />
be unpopular with the government of the day. No one suggests<br />
that State Judges who are subject to a retiring age are not<br />
truly independent.<br />
Some have asked why did we oppose simultaneous elections in 1974?<br />
In that year, the simultaneous election proposal was part of a<br />
package designed to change the whole system of government in<br />
Australia as we know it.<br />
Labor then tried to control methods of electing State Parliaments;<br />
gerrymander electorates; control local government from Canberra;<br />
and enable amendment of the Constitution without the approval of<br />
a majority of the States.<br />
Because the majority of Labor's proposals was disastrous, we<br />
didn't want a split-ticket. We felt at that time, that the<br />
only way to ensure defeat of these proposals was to oppose the<br />
whole package. There is every reason to vote " 1yes" on all four<br />
proposals. The States are protected; the Senate is protected<br />
and strengthened.<br />
These proposals were fully considered by representatives of the<br />
States at the Hobart Constitutional Convention and were approved<br />
without a dissenting voice. To sum up: All four proposals are<br />
sensible and practical; supported by all the major Parties;<br />
and were supported overwhelmingly in principle at the Hobart<br />
Constitutional Convention.<br />
They are considered and necessary Constitutional reforms.<br />
