Blecker M4r. Pruiser,. what about the' cost of living,_ I. mean,_ it* has. jus*' t'<br />
gone up, and up and'' up. so<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Btwages have. gone up by about the same amount as.. the co t of<br />
livirqj and in addition to that ' if ycku look at total disposable<br />
f amily income per capita, or if You look at%_ 46isehold consumption.<br />
* expenditure per capita, bo th of these hAve one up:. over.-the last<br />

<p>Sbcker But whdt about interert. rateq?<br />
Rrimlu Minister<br />
It taker. aJll these: things, into account.<br />
Uvcker<br />
Well, . I'd j. 11-t-ike to'qgote you.<br />
Prime-Min~ ister<br />
lnt. tne, look,. at, soraethinq. 01' ue. if. ypp think* interest rates are<br />
high) now, bec-ause wel have manaqjed the. economy better than mny..<br />
otheri count ries,... over this last year they went-to 20. iper cent In'.<br />
the Unlitedl Stditer,..-They are far higqher. 1n. the United l( ingdom,<br />
There have bee6n difficult world economic circumstances*,<br />
y: do understand that.'<br />
Pkimce Minister<br />
HUt I ( 1o not try, to suggest-: that it isaleanyt because T know<br />
-i'is not. But -if ' you. are criticising. ouir po icier, as. severely.<br />
as% y ott have, you ha've got. to looX at what other-policies would<br />
do to Australia.<br />
ILeckeram. qLueryinqg, Rr. raser, the singlte income family earner, becatise<br />
for instance, if he: earning. this $ 200 a week and he-borrows..<br />
$ 25,000 to. tiry. and get a honie and. it-is fair enough for a young.<br />
couple to-want -a home It' is-qolrt to take him * over a perioa<br />
of 25 years to'pcay that interest back. He is going to pay<br />
at. current interest rates*,<br />
Prime Minister<br />
do not know how you worked that out. Let's as. un that you<br />
have worked that t<br />
Decker I am correct on that..<br />
Prime Minister<br />
W -ll, you migh4t be. Because if you are talking about home<br />
aunership. f or families with. chil1dren, we ha'je increased the home<br />
sav; ings. grant..<br />

only do what it is:: prepared to tav the people for. Now, it isvery.<br />
easy to * offer additiorial concessionis, but if you are going to<br />
do that and if yoU al-8 ClOiTI to ta% ! people for paying for.<br />

Blut), 1* wanted to gol; back to. the original point. Wages have gone<br />
up . by about the same as the Consumer Price Index. Disposable<br />
family income has risen over the laat f ive years. Consumption<br />

matters have been raised in.-the Senate by Tatsmanian * Senators<br />
Brian flarradine, Shirley Walters, Senator Tate, _ ard I think<br />
Senator Archer. </p>
<p>ABC .1obart( 72R)<br />
P~ rim~ e Minietr<br />
: I am concerned about some of these things, but at the same tim~ e:<br />
there is a wide view in. the Australianl comMUntY that there shouil&amp;<br />
be * a n, inimwn of censorship. There have been a * lot of discussions<br />
in, the televisilon area about selt-requiationt. about maintaining<br />
community standards. 1I think sometiinez,, ttie points You make are<br />
vwr-y,, zeal obnes and' I have-a -sympathy. for them..<br />
Cdaller bir. -Fraser, )-there is'nothing being donIe. I don't really . believe<br />
that ' yo understand the depth' of feeling kn. the community. and<br />
this. is. wlta4 ,' concerns me.<br />
4 Culler Well then I thiinlkyout'd be doing l. sornetirncI pore about it.<br />
Pr im6 miinis-ter<br />
Well,, it:' is -aquestion as to.. how f ar a Covey-iiel Should go in..<br />
censoring what does -appear. on the-television screenis or, on the<br />
f i Irn screens f or.. that matter<br />
Cal3l er<br />

that it Is requiked int family: viewing timhe.<br />
primle minister<br />
Well again, -there are many discussions in-the Broadcasting<br />
Tribunal about these inatters-and about the Pxogramnles that are<br />
appropriate.; Can I just say -that I -take the Poin tayo have.<br />
