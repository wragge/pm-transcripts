FOR MEDIA 5 JUNE 1991<br />
Heads of Government have agreed that the next special<br />
Premiers' Conference will be held on 30 July 1991 in Sydney.<br />
The Conference was originally scheduled to be held in May,<br />
but was deferred at the request of the Premier of New South<br />
Wales because of the election in that State. July 30 was<br />
the only date that could be agreed by all Premiers.<br />
Unfortunately, I will not, therefore, be able to attend the<br />
22nd South Pacific Forum to be held in Pohnpei, Federated<br />
States of Micronesia, on July 28-30. Senator Evans, the<br />
Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, will represent me at<br />
the Forum.<br />
The series of special Premiers' Conferences, which I<br />
proposed in my speech to the National Press Club on 19 July<br />
1990, represents a major initiative to promote a close<br />
partnership between the Commonwealth, States and Local<br />
Government. The first Conference, held in Brisbane on 30-31 October<br />
1990, set in train review processes involving a wide range<br />
of intergovernmental issues. The July Conference will be<br />
the opportunity for Heads of Government to receive the<br />
initial reports of these reviews.<br />
Important issues will be addressed in the areas of<br />
regulatory reform, road and rail transport and the<br />
interstate electricity network in South Eastern Australia.<br />
Heads of Government will also assess progress and guide<br />
further work in areas such as the review of t<br />
Commonwealth-State financial arrangements where reports on<br />
options for reform are to be provided to the third special<br />
Premiers' Conference scheduled for November.<br />
The issues being considered in this process are wide ranging<br />
and of major importance for the future of Australia. They<br />
include: the need to develop a more integrated domestic market<br />
for Australian industry with a better coordinated<br />
regulatory framework and more efficient transport links<br />
to improve efficiency and international<br />
competitiveness; and </p>
<p>2.<br />
the need for better integrated service delivery in the<br />
public sector to enable it to deliver better services<br />
to clients.<br />
I have written to Forum leaders advising them of my regret<br />
at being unable to attend the Forum. </p>
