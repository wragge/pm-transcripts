U<br />
PRIME MINISTER N<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING, MP G<br />
HOWARD FAILS THE TULLY-MILLSTREAM TEST P1<br />
Earlier today I issued a challenge to Mr Howard to unequivocally rule out the A<br />
Tully-Millstream hydro-electric project which will flood significant areas of WorldA<br />
Heritage listed rainforest in the Wet Tropics World Heritage area. T<br />
Mr Howard has now failed this most fundamental test of his born-again green N<br />
credentials. When asked by a journalist to respond to my challenge, Mr S<br />
Howard refused to rule out the dam, saying: p1<br />
" As far as the Tully-Millstream is concerned, I give you an undertaking, H,<br />
that we will ensure, in considering that proposal, all of the environmental<br />
concernis that ought to be taken into account will be taken into account<br />
and that it will not go ahead if it is going to do significant damage to the SU<br />
environment". eq<br />
Mr Howard knows that this project cannot be built without significant damage to -7<br />
the environment, including to World Heritage values.<br />
And yet he has refused to rule it out. 11<br />
re<br />
His response reveals the John Howard of old. The same John Howard who<br />
was implacably opposed to the use of Commonwealth powers to protect the M<br />
Franklin River. V<br />
The only thing that has changed is John Howard's willingness to say what he1<br />
really believes.<br />
He has now proven conclusively that if elected, he will allow the fabric of e<br />
environmental protection that Labor has put in place, in the national interest, ha<br />
over the past 13 years, to be torn apart. 1<br />
John Howard will sit on his hands while the National Party and conservativein<br />
State governments unravel years of work by Federal Labor and communitiesIc<br />
across Australia to protect our rich environmental heritage for the future.<br />
Environmentally concerned voters should take the Tully-Millstream as a<br />
warning. Don't trust John Howard on the environment.<br />
