j', AUS TALIALFOR<br />
MEDIA Monday 22 April 1985<br />
Cabinet decided today that the Government would present a major<br />
statement on expenditure to the Parliament in May.<br />
The statement will cover major expenditure savings decisions,<br />
contributing to a reduction of at least one billion dollars in<br />
1985-86 Commonwealth outlays.<br />
The statement is to be made in May rather than in the August<br />
Budget to secure savings over the full financial year commencing<br />
1 July 1985.<br />
The statement will not cover matters related to Federal-State<br />
financial relations, which will be the subject of Premiers'<br />
Conferences in May and June.<br />
Together with further savings to be announced in the August<br />
Budget, and the outcome of the Premiers' Conferences, the<br />
measures covered by the May statement will allow the Government<br />
to meet its trilogy commitments for 1985-86.<br />
The trilogy commitments require us to reduce the deficit in money<br />
terms and Commonwealth outlays and tax revenue as shares of Gross<br />
Domestic Product.<br />
It is likely that the recent depreciation of the Australian<br />
dollar will lead to upward revisions * of expected revenue for<br />
1985-86, in excess of upward revisions of the costs of on-going<br />
priority programmes.<br />
Part of this net revenue benefit to the budget will occur through<br />
the crude oil pricing decision taken today.<br />
The Cabinet today decided that none of any increased crude oil<br />
excise revenue resulting from today's decision will be used to<br />
support new spending programs, or to avoid spending cuts which<br />
would otherwise have been made. These receipts, and any other<br />
net revenue benefits flowing from the $ A depreciation, will be<br />
applied to strengthening the economy and preserving the<br />
advantages won by the depreciation, through either the reduction<br />
of the deficit or subsequent reductions in taxes and charges.<br />
The recent depreciation provides Australia with a great<br />
opportunity to boost production and employment in export and<br />
import-competing industries. To seize this opportunity, we must<br />
avoid the dissipation of our improved competitiveness through a<br />
new inflationary cycle.<br />
The Government is determined that a firm fiscal policy will play<br />
its full part in the national effort to sustain recovery and<br />
preserve the benefits of depreciation. </p>
