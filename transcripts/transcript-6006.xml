AUSTRALIAN OLYMPIC FEDERATION<br />
APPEAL LAUNCH<br />
In 19,84, Australian athletes will be taking part iii the<br />
Olympic Games to be held in Los Aingeles. our team will<br />
also compete at the Winter Olympics which will be held<br />
in Yugoslavia in February of the same year.<br />
The Olympic Games are the most famous of all international<br />
sporting competitions. I know that the most important part<br />
of the Olympic ideals is to compete. But I also know that<br />
when Australians compete, they are determined to win. That<br />
determination is the essence of competition. The determination<br />
of our sportsmen and women to win has over the years, brought many<br />
great triumphs which are not only satisfying to the athletes<br />
involvcd but have been a cause of tremendous pride and a<br />
sense of achievement for all Australians.<br />
We all felt that during the Commonwealth Games when we<br />
saw Raelene Boyle win the 400 metres, when Robert de Castella<br />
wion the marathon and our swimmers won gold medal after gold<br />
medal. The Brisbane Commonwealth Games were a watershed for<br />
Australian athletes. Those Games marked the rebirth of<br />
the Australian sporting tradition. I know every Australian<br />
has high hopes that our successes in Brisbane can be<br />
repeated at the Olympic Games in Los Angeles.<br />
As always, money will be needed if our athletes are to do<br />
that. The Australian Olympic Federation estimates that<br />
S4. 5 million will be needed if we are to have a really<br />
ef f-ctive team in Los Angeles. Already the Commonwealth Government<br />
has committed( a total of $ 1.4 million to that target.<br />
But the Olympic team is Australia's team, not the<br />
Governmcnt'! S team. on its shoulders it will carry the<br />
hopes and the pride of millions of Australians.<br />
Very few of us will be able to participate directly in<br />
the Olympic Games. But we can help the team in a very real<br />
way by., con~ ftributing to its financial costs. By doing<br />
that, Australians will be able to watch with pride when<br />
members of our team win medals, knowing that they played<br />
some part in the victory.<br />
Australia is a great country with an unequalled sporting<br />
tradition. All of us can help make sure that tradition lives on. </p>
