    <content><![CDATA[<p>I welcome the agreement by Iraqi political leaders, announced on   26 August 2007, on major political issues.  </p>
<p>The Australian Government has been urging Iraq's leaders to work together to advance political reconciliation and to progress crucial legislation.  </p>
<p>I congratulate Prime Minister H.E. Nouri al-Maliki and his colleagues on advancing agreement on key legislation as well as critical political and security initiatives.  This is a demonstration of their shared commitment to Iraq's future and that of all Iraqis. </p>
<p>While this is a positive outcome under difficult circumstances, more remains to be done.  </p>
<p>When the Iraqi Parliament resumes in early September, leaders will need to continue to work together to secure progress on critical issues including the passage of oil and revenue sharing legislation and the constitutional review.  </p>
<p>I have written to Prime Minister al-Maliki to welcome this positive step and encourage further progress.  </p>
