October 1996 TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
THE HON JOHN HOWARD), MP<br />
INTERVIEW WITH KERRY O'BRIEN 7.30 REPORT<br />
E&amp; OE<br />
O'BRIEN I'm joined now from Canberra by Prime Minister John Howard. John Howard do you stand rock<br />
solid behind your Industry Minister tonight?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Yes and I don't believe that he's breached the guidelines but I think what that little commentary<br />
demonstrated and what Brian Gibson's very unfortunate circumstances, demonstrated is the need<br />
for me to examine the introduction into Australia of the concept of a blind trust. I mean, we get<br />
into the situation where any body who has a substantial share holding is going to be fightened out<br />
of going into politics through fear that quite easily, when you start talking in thousands of shares<br />
and cross holdings and so forth, it's very easy to create the impression that there is chicanery<br />
when there is not. And I'd like us to look at the situation whereby if you have a substantial share<br />
holding and you go into politics and you become a Minister you can put that share holding into<br />
the hands of tr-ustees. They do this in America, Canada and I believe also in Britain and you can<br />
be kept at arms length from your share holding and you can do your ministerial job. You're not<br />
involved every day in making a calculation as to whether you may or may not be in breach of a<br />
particular obligation. Now, I mean, I've never had any shares since I've been a Minister. I<br />
haven't owned shares for twenty years. But I don't expect to impose that attitude on other<br />
people. At present if you own a farm or you own a block of flats you can keep them and you can<br />
make money out of them and remain a minister. Now I'm not saying there's anything wrong with<br />
that. But if you own a parcel of shares, historically, Governments on both sides of politics have </p>
<p>Fax rom16/ 10/ 96 10: 12 Ps: 2<br />
taken a different view and the guidelines that I'm operating now are the guidelines that were<br />
operated by the Keating, Hawke and Fraser Governments.<br />
O'BRIEN: Didn't you enhance them a little?<br />
PRIM MINISTER.<br />
Only in a little respect Kerry. I mean, the tragedy of all of this is that you've had two men who<br />
have had to drop out because they haven't complied with the guidelines not because they've<br />
earned a cent or a dollar or been dishonest or been duplicitous, but because they through<br />
inadvertence and carelessness, and I have to say that, they didn't pay enough attention to the<br />
detail of the Ministerial guide and they had to go.<br />
O'BRICEN: Why is their carelessness any different from John Moore's position?<br />
PRIME NE TR<br />
Quite different because they were in technical breach of the guidelines and John's not.<br />
O'BRIEN; Why not?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Because the guidelines say you've got to get rid of shares in a company that's operating in the<br />
area of your portfolio responsibilities.<br />
O'BRIEN; But what about the demonstration...<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
No that's not, that's not, that's not operating in the area of the portfolio. He can't divest shares<br />
in those high tech companies because he doesn't own any shares in them,<br />
O'BRIEN: But he has a substantial share holding in a company that he founded which... </p>
<p>tax ram16/ 10/ 96 18: 12 Pg: 3<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
But Kerry it's not the parent company. It's an entirely different matter from Boral and Boral.<br />
O'BRIEN: Does or does not the company in which he has shares stand, potential, to benefit from the<br />
successes of those companies in which...<br />
PREIE MINITER:<br />
No Kerry, look at the guidelines. I mean, we're talking here...<br />
O'BRICEN:<br />
Let's talk about potential conflict of interest...<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
No, no, no, no, no. Well we'll talk about potential conflict of interest, we'll also talk about the<br />
guidelines, O'BRIEN: You've made much, going into the election campaign, of public trust and restoring trust in<br />
politicians... PRIE MINISTER:<br />
I continue to do that and I am making the point that we need to look at the desirability of having a<br />
situation where people who've got share holdings are not frightened out of going into politics and<br />
I think it's very, very important that that be examined...<br />
O'BRIIEN: Sorry before you go on can I please ask you couple of questions that relate specifically to the<br />
issue of perceptions of conflict of interest? That is at the heart of this.<br />
PRiMfE MINISTER:<br />
Sure sure. Ab, yes. </p>
<p>n-an . jro 16/ 10/ 96 10: 12 Pg: 4<br />
O'BRIFN: That is at the heart of it. John Moore has a substantial share holding in Bligh Venture Capital<br />
Company. PRIME MINSTER:<br />
Yeah, he has two to three per cent. I'm sorry, you call that substantial?<br />
O'BRIEN: Well in terms, what are the values of the shares?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
No, no, no I am told, I was told before I came on to this programme that there are seven million<br />
issued shares in Bligh Ventures of which be holds 43,000...<br />
O'BRIEN: So the principle relates to how much you've got, not whether you've got any or not?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
No, I'm applying your standard of a moment ago. You were talking about controlling interests...<br />
O'BRIEN: I'm suggesting that there are many people in Australia who would find the value of that please...<br />
PRIE MINISTER:<br />
No, no, no, you please, you asked me the question.<br />
O'BRIEN: You've made the point.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I don't think you've allowed me to. Two to three per cent is hardly a controlling interest. </p>
<p>Fax from O'BRIEN: I'm not suggesting it's a controlling interest, I'm talking about the value of those shares and I<br />
would suggest to you that for most Australians the value of those shares is substantial.<br />
PRIME M1NISTEIL<br />
Look, any share holding of that is substantial but that is not the point. The point is whether you<br />
control the company in such a way that you can benefit. And if you bold two to three per cent,<br />
which I understand to be his percentage, and bear in mind that he's been trying to sell them, he's<br />
been trying to sell them since May. But I just go back again to the guidelines, the guidelines don't<br />
require them to be divested,<br />
LYNEHAM: I'm sorry, I understand that and you have made that point. Would you please let me just in return<br />
ask the question, the clear question about conflict of interest. ' I would have thought it's not just a<br />
question of control, it isn't a question of potential profit, I don't want to cast any aspersions on<br />
John Moore...<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, I hope you don't.<br />
O'BRIEN:<br />
But we're talking about perceptions.<br />
PRIME MINSTER:<br />
I hope you don't.<br />
O'BRIEN: We're talking about the potential for perceptions. And in this instance does he not stand<br />
potentially to profit via his investment in Bligh ventures from decisions that the Government is<br />
making with him as the Minister that relate to bounties, and to other to research and<br />
development assistance and so on?<br />
PRIM M1MITER:<br />
But you could equally say that somebody who has a superannuation policy with the AMP stands<br />
to benefit if the Government takes a decision to give a tax advantage to a company in which the<br />
AMP has invested.., and it is the same formal corporate linkage. Now, if you applied that<br />
principle you'd be asking questions of a very large number of members of both sides of the<br />
Farxo m16/ 18/ 96 18: 12 Pg: S </p>
<p>Fax from Parliament. I mean, that is why the guidelines are drawn in a way where what has to be looked to<br />
is the shareholding of the Minister concerned. You can't, if you invest shares in a company which<br />
in turn has minority holdings in other companies and you have only 2 to you can hardly be<br />
said to have a controlling interest in those other companies. Nobody has produced to me any<br />
evidence of a conflict of interest so far as John is concerned. I mean, the Opposition today were<br />
talking about decisions taken in the R&amp; D area, I mean, the only decisions that have been taken in<br />
the R&amp; D area are decisions which in fact have reduced the benefit. So if we apply...<br />
O'BRIEN: The point about the computer bounty is that the computer bounty was retained for at least a year<br />
in the budget where other bounties went in your last budget.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Yes, but there wasn't an additional benefit given.<br />
O'BRIMN: But there was a benefit retained.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
But you could say to them if you don't remove a tax concession,... I mean, where does it end? I<br />
mean what this exchange has really highlighted Kerry is the desirability of looking at the blind<br />
trust. I mean, you said at the beginning you are not making any allegations about John Moore<br />
and neither should anybody make any allegations against Jim Short...<br />
O'BRIEN: There isn't a clear allegation against any of them. It's all the issue of perception of conflict.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Can I say there is no allegation against any of them of dishonesty or impropriety.<br />
O'BRIEEN:<br />
That's understood, that's understood.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I have accepted the resignations of Short and Gibson because they breached the guidelines. I am<br />
not requiring a resignation of Moore because I don't believe that he's breached the guidelines and<br />
nothing the Labor Party has done today has demonstrated that to me. I have additionally said that<br />
Fa rom16/ 10/ 96 10: 12 Pg: 6 </p>
<p>Fa rom16/ 10/ 96 10: 12 Pg: 7<br />
out of this whole exercise where I have enforced very very tough guidelines and some people may<br />
even argue unfairly tough in relation to rm Short and Brian Gibson, but nonetheless I have, I<br />
think out of all of it, one of the things that does need to be examined is this whole concept of<br />
blind trust. Because if we get to the stage in this country...<br />
O'BRIEN:<br />
But the concept of blind trust has been around for a very very long time...<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
But it has never been introduced.<br />
O'BRIEEN:<br />
But there are those who might say that if your ministers don't fit the guidelines then you change<br />
the guidelines to suit the ministers.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, I haven't changed any guidelines but do you think it is fair...<br />
O'BRIEN. But aren't you raising that prospect of introducing blind trusts?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I am raising the prospect, I mean, they could be added to the existing guidelines.<br />
O'BRIEN: Okay, John Howard, thanks very much for talking with us.<br />
ends.<br />
