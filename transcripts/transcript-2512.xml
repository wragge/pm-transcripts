FOR PR~ LESS: PM. No 3/ 1972.<br />
STATEMENT BY THlE PRIME MINISTER, ZIR WILLIAM McMAHON<br />
RELEASE OF SHEIKH MUJIBUR RAHMAN<br />
We welcome the decision of the Government of Pakistan<br />
to release Sheikh Mujibur Rahinan.<br />
The Australian Government has sent several messages to<br />
the Government of Pakistan designed not only to ensure the safety<br />
and welfare of the Sheikh, but also to promote direct negotiations<br />
with Awami League leaders, including the Sheikh in particular.<br />
This was done in the interests of promoting a settlement<br />
in the region which would lead to the return of the refugees and<br />
the restoration of normal conditions of life.<br />
We hope that the return to Dacca today of Sheikh Mujibur<br />
will prove to he a significant step towards achieving these<br />
objectives as well as a stable political environment and<br />
Government administration.<br />
CANBERRA January 1971. </p>
