PRESS OFFICE TRANSCRIPT 21 AUGUST 1978 ? O<br />
INTERVIEW WITH PAUL DAVEY, ABC<br />
Question: Are you now categorically saying that the Bulletin article<br />
is wrong?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
It's wrong in its thrust, in its substance and that's<br />
been said all along.<br />
Question: And yet there were discussions on August 7 and 8 which you<br />
said in* your statement, which included the matter of<br />
Mr. Robinson's evidence concerning the evidence of January 17.<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
Eric Robinson raised these matters when he was reporting to<br />
Ministers, refreshing Minister's minds on what had happened<br />
and as it makes plain, he had reported then that it was the<br />
fact of the phone conversation and not the substance, or contents<br />
that had been conveyed in my office on the 17th. Now, in putting<br />
it in that way, I was obviously interested in it because one<br />
of the things that had always puzzled me in a sense was why<br />
Eric Robinson had a clear recollection of the matter being<br />
mentioned and why I had none. Now, if a Minister comes into my<br />
office and says he has a conversation with his Permanent Head,<br />
I'm not going to find that remarkable, it would have to be the<br />
nature of the conversation that would make it remarkable or<br />
alternatively, if he came into my office and said he hadn't<br />
spoken with his Permanent Head for three months, I would find<br />
that remarkable and what the Minister said, in my mind, appeared<br />
to offer an explanation for that to me, for myself, and I had<br />
asked myself this on a number of occasions and that's the way<br />
the matter fell out.<br />
Question: What did you then say to Mr. Robinson?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
I said, well if that is your recollection, can you write me a note<br />
about it? But it was also pointed out that he ought to refresh<br />
his memory about the evidence given at the Royal Commission<br />
which he did and even though a note was drafted, by Eric Robinson<br />
which I didn't see until today, it wasn't sent for reasons<br />
that are plain. / 2 </p>
<p>( Paul Davey) -2-<br />
Question: Would it be fair to say that Mr. Robinson, what he said in<br />
evidence to the Royal Commission, was if you like a little<br />
more forceful, a little more direct than what he has in this<br />
draft statement which you have now released to the press?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
I think you've got to take his evidence in total. There<br />
are a number of questions on this subject and I think<br />
you need to look at them all.<br />
Question: Mr. Robinson told you in the statement which you've released,<br />
that he recalled Senator Withers on January 17, amongst other<br />
things, making reference to a telephone call that he had<br />
made to Mr. Pearson. Do you, Prime Minister, see any<br />
inconsistency in that fact and the fact of your telling the<br />
Parliament that the first time you became aware of the situation<br />
was on April 16.<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
No, because that is the first time I became aware of it.<br />
I've got no recollection of having been told of it on other<br />
occasions. Now, that's as it is. I mentioned that'fact to<br />
you that if it was the fact I recall and not the substance,<br />
that could have been an explanation in my mind about Eric<br />
Robinson's recollection and my recollection. But that's not<br />
as it is. He re-read the evidence, I re-read his evidence,<br />
in terms of his evidence in relation to that point I accept<br />
it and I've never sought to belittle it.<br />
Question: One must ask, with respect, Prime Minister, why Mr. Robinson<br />
should remember that January 17 meeting better than you do?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
Well, that might be one of the mysteries that will never unfold.<br />
I had thought that this particular matter might give myself<br />
an insight into it because again I make the point that if it<br />
was the fact of the phone call that in itself is a very<br />
unremarkable event, and it can only become remarkable if the<br />
substance and the substance I would believe, combined with the<br />
motive that the judge. attributed to it, and that of course<br />
didn't unfold until a very much later time.<br />
Question: Given the looking at the overall situation of the past week<br />
given the tremendous political flak that you have received,<br />
why have you, if you like toughed-it-out, stone-walled, refused<br />
to answer direct questions on this? / 3 </p>
<p>-3<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
Well, I answered the substance let me just make that<br />
point again I answered the substance and in my understanding<br />
Eric Robinson answered the substance, but I do place a<br />
very great importance on the confidentiality of discussions<br />
amongst Ministers, of discussions that take place in a<br />
Ministerial meeting, for example, and in these circumstances<br />
I felt that however important I believe that confidentiality<br />
should be, that the matter needed explanation and I discussed<br />
that the Deputy Prime Minister and with Eric Robinson and<br />
that's why this statement is being made, a statement in a<br />
sense which is against convention; against convention of<br />
confidentiality of those discussions.<br />
Question: 1though<br />
Do you think your credibility you could have saved, if you like,<br />
or your credibility might have been overly damaged by not doing<br />
this last week?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
Well, maybe I am overly concerned about maintaining appropriate<br />
confidentiality in discussions amongst Ministers and in my<br />
own mind and in my own heart I know absolutely that the discussions<br />
in their intent and in their purpose were completely innocent<br />
and completely clear and to that extent I suppose I was surprised<br />
at the degree of political flak that that in part's the name<br />
of the game isn't it?<br />
Question: Are you quite confident now that the issue is dead, that is<br />
is finished?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
I've got no doubt that the Australian Labor Party will continue<br />
to try and revive the issue, but they will want to do that<br />
because they've got no thought to offer on the Government of<br />
Australia. They've not over the last two and a half years had<br />
a constructive word to say about the management of the economy.<br />
They know the economy is starting to run well. They know quite<br />
well that we are facing a 5 percent rate of inflation, within<br />
the 12 month period, and they also that in spite of some of<br />
the newspaper headlines, this Budget out in the countryside and<br />
where people gather in the cities and the countryside has been<br />
much much better received than the headlines would lead one<br />
to believe.<br />
Question: What about your own Government members, though, Prime Minister.<br />
There has been a lot of talk, open talk, by many of them that<br />
they wanted a categoric expl. anation from you that there were<br />
eruptions within the parties the-2oint Government parties<br />
are you happy now that this will silence them, that you are<br />
going into this coming week with a united front? ./ 4 </p>
<p>4<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
Open talk, I don't know who open talk about any discussions<br />
with me have always been very constructive and sensible<br />
ones. Question: I'm just trying to ( inaudible) backbenchers the feeling<br />
in the backbench?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
I think that members in the total circumstances have a right<br />
to know the nature of the discussions and now they know.<br />
Question: And are they happy do you think?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
I would hope so, and believe so.<br />
