<p>E&amp;OE................................</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>How confident are you that the economy has turned around?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well there are some very good signs. The retail figures yesterday were very encouraging. I have thought for a long time that the fundamentals of the Australian economy are very strong. I know Mr Beazley is hoping that the whole economy weakens and thereby thinking that that will boost his electoral prospects. But I don't believe the Australian people want that. I think the Australian people want a strong growing economy and they want people in charge of that economy who know what they're doing, and that's the Coalition.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>[inaudible]</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh look opinion polls are bad at the moment for us. And that doesn't surprise me at all. I think they will remain fairly indifferent for the Coalition for some time.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>[inaudible]</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well they've been ordinary for a while haven't they? There's nothing new about ordinary polls for the Coalition at the moment. But we have a long way to go before there's an election and we've got a lot of governing to do and increasingly people are going to ask what my opponent stands for. I heard him talking about Ben Chifley yesterday. Well I didn't agree with much of what Ben Chifley stood for but at least Ben Chifley stood for something. He believed in things, he believed in certain things according to his values system. Now I rejected many of those things but at least he believed in something. His successor Mr Beazley believes in nothing other than political opportunism.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr Beazley says Labor is more united than it ever has been in its 100 year history. How does that contrast with the Coalition considering the week you had last week?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well you'd expect him to say that at his centenary Caucus meeting. If he can't say it at that he can't say it anywhere. Just look at his attitude on issues. Mr Beazley is an Opposition Leader devoid of any commitment to a set of political, economic and social principles, he's somebody who is behaving in a completely opportunistic fashion. He hopes to feed off the inevitable difficulties the Government faces in bringing about major change. Now the public will decide whether to reward that opportunism. Unlike his predecessor Ben Chifley, he doesn't believe in very much.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>What can you offer HIH shareholders?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>That matter will be talked about this morning. And until it's talked about, I don't have anything further to say.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Does the 1% levy plan have merit?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>That matter will be talked about this morning and until I've talked about it I don't have anything further to say.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Are you worried about New Zealand's changes to its defence forces?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>What New Zealand does with New Zealand's defence force is a matter for New Zealand. I've made that plain privately and publicly in my discussions with Helen Clark. However every time a country takes a decision about the size or the readiness of its defence force that decision has both domestic and international consequences. And every Government makes these decisions according to its assessment of the national interest and having taken that decision you must accept the consequences of it.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>What are the consequences?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>That is a matter for New Zealand and New Zealanders to assess. I do not give public advice to the people of an independent country as to how to run their affairs, particularly a friendly democratic country such as New Zealand.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Is Australia prepared to share more of the burden for regional defence matters?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Australia will continue to play a very strong role in regional defence.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>[inaudible] no longer a member of ANZUS. Does Australia regard New Zealand as being a member of ANZUS?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>The call on New Zealand's defence status vis a vis the United States is a matter for New Zealand and the United States. It is not a matter for Australia.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>The 'A' for ANZUS stands for Australia sir.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I'm aware of that. Thank you for the history lesson. And I think we've done enough.</p>
