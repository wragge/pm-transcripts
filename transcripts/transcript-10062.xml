    <content><![CDATA[<p>My wife, Janette, will be admitted to a Sydney hospital early this week for a major operation. Naturally I wish to spend as much time as possible with her. </p>
<p>I will, therefore, not be able to proceed with my planned visit to Japan and Indonesia which was to have commenced on the 7th of August.</p>
<p>Yesterday I telephoned President Soeharto personally to advise him of the situation. As the Japanese Prime Minister Mr Hashimoto was not contactable over the weekend I have sent him a personal message. </p>
<p>Arrangements are already in hand to find alternative dates for my visits to both countries. I hope that such visits can take place in the very near future. </p>
