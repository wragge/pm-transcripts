    <content><![CDATA[<p>PRIME MINISTER<br />FOR MEDIA 27 November 1989<br />The Government has finalised the terms of reference for the<br />Resource Assessment Commission's inquiry into forests and<br />timber resources. I have written to the Hon Justice<br />D G Stewart, Chairperson of the Commission, formally asking<br />him to commence the inquiry. A copy of my notice to the<br />Commission setting out the terms of reference for the<br />inquiry is attached.<br />The Resource Assessment Commission was established by the<br />Commonwealth Government this year to conduct independent<br />inquiries into major complex resource issues. The<br />Government's intention to refer the issue of Australia's<br />forest resources to the Commission as its first topic of<br />inquiry was announced by the Minister for Primary Industries<br />and Energy, Mr Kerin, in May this year when he introduced<br />the Resource Assessment Commission legislation into<br />Parliament. I have consulted with State and Territory governments and<br />other interested parties on the terms of reference for the<br />inquiry. I am satisfied that the terms of reference and the<br />requirements contained in the Act will enable the Commission<br />to consider all aspects of forest resource use and<br />management that it considers relevant. In the Act, use in<br />relation to a resource includes use for conservation, and<br />the Commission is required to assess the environmental,<br />cultural, social, industry, economic and other implications<br />of all possible uses of the resource, including long-term,<br />uncertain and intangible implications.<br />The Governor-General has appointed Dr David James and<br />Dr Graeme Caughley as special Commissioners to the Resource<br />Assessment Commission for the purpose of this inquiry.<br />Dr James is an economist with considerable experience in the<br />field of resource economics. He was formerly Associate<br />Professor of Economics at Macquarie University.<br />Dr Caughley is Chief Research Scientist with the CSIRO's<br />Division of Wildlife and Ecology and has extensive<br />international experience in the field of applied ecology.<br />Because of the. complexity and importance of this issue I<br />have specified a period of two years for the Commission to<br />complete its investigations.</p>
