PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA TUESDAY, 15 DECEMBER 1981<br />
STATEMENT BY PRIME MINISTER<br />
DEPARTMENT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS<br />
The Federal Executive Council has today approved the appointment<br />
of Mr M. Codd as Secretary to the Department of Industrial<br />
Relations. The appointment will date from 1 February 1982.<br />
Until then, Mr Codd will be Acting Secretary to the Department.<br />
Mr Codd was formerly Under Secretary of the Department of the<br />
Prime Minister and Cabinet and has served in a variety of<br />
capacities in that'Department for the past 12 years.<br />
The Administrative Arrangements Order is to be amended-to<br />
define more clearly the role of the Department of Industrial<br />
Relations in promoting better industrial relations and in<br />
the co-ordination of policies on wages and labour costs and<br />
in relation to disputes involving Commonwealth employees.<br />
The Government believes that sound industrial relations<br />
policies in all sectors of industry and employment are central<br />
to national growth and prosperity. Immediate steps are to<br />
be taken to transf er the Central Of fice of the Department of<br />
Industrial Relations to Canberra in recognition of the<br />
Department's importance as a source of policy advice in an<br />
area of significant Government interest. This re-location<br />
will enable enhanced communication and interchange between<br />
the Department of Industrial Relations and the Government<br />
and other elements of Commonwealth administration.<br />
The Department of Industrial Relations will retain a significant<br />
presence in Melbourne to ensure maintenance of close liaison<br />
between the Department and representative employee and<br />
employer bodies-located in Melbourne.<br />
Transfer of the Central Office of the Department of Industrial<br />
Relations to Canberra will be accompanied by strengthening<br />
. of the Department's capacity to advise and assist the Government<br />
in presenting its view at arbitration hearings of major<br />
national importance. -The Government will also be looking<br />
to the Department for advice on ways to improve industrial<br />
relations practices and institutions, and on wages and labour<br />
costs and the co-ordination of Government industrial relations<br />
policies. The Department will give greater emphasis to its<br />
industrial relations research functions, including arrangements<br />
f or consultation with employer and-employee bodies and<br />
machinery for dealing with industrial disputes.<br />
