PRIME MINISTER<br />
EMPLOYMENT OF THE HANDICAPPED IN THE<br />
COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC SERVICE<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, the Rt. Hon.<br />
William McMahon, CH, MP<br />
The Government has approved a recommendation of the<br />
Public Service Board, made after consultation with other interested<br />
Commonwealth authorities, for a further relaxation of the basic<br />
medical standard for permanent appointment to the Commonwealth<br />
4 Public Service. Subject to maintenance of the requirement of efficiency<br />
for the duties to be performed, greater flexibility will in future<br />
be observed in assessing the medical fitness of candidates for<br />
permanent appointment.<br />
At present the general practice is to expect appointees<br />
to the Service to meet a medical standard designed to ensure a<br />
Period of at least seven years' efficient service.<br />
In future, a three-year minimum * period will be used as<br />
a general guideline. This guideline will be flexibly administered<br />
according to the duties to be performed and any other relevant<br />
factors so as to allow consideration, on their particular merits,<br />
of borderline cases. on the other hand, as at present, a longer<br />
period may be required in some cases -for example, where lengthy<br />
Utraining as a Cadet is involved.<br />
This decision represents the second general relaxation<br />
of the basic medical standard.<br />
Until 19621, the general rule was that permanent appointees<br />
to the Service ( other than returned soldiers) should be in sound<br />
health and likely to remain so until retiring age. In May 1962,<br />
the Government approved a recommendation of the Public Service Board<br />
Which gave opportunities for many handicapped people to be<br />
permanently appointed. These people contribute to the Provident<br />
Account. / 2 </p>
<p>Upwards of 10,00Y handicapped people have been<br />
accepted for permanent aopointment as a result of the 1962<br />
decision. The manner in which the handicanpped can be employed<br />
in the Commonwealth Public Service has received continuing<br />
attention by the Public Service Board. In its 1971 Annual<br />
Renort, the Board indicated that an officer in each of its<br />
Branch Offices in the States and Territories had been<br />
nominated to assist with the placement of handicaoped persons.<br />
The revised standard to be followed in the future<br />
will significantly increase the emnloyment ooportunities in<br />
the Commonwealth Public Service for the handicapped, a<br />
development which should be well received by all interested<br />
in their welfare.<br />
