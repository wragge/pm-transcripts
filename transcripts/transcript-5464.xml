TALK~-BACK(<br />
Adcock-Now, it'is ih' very great pleasure to have in the studio the<br />
Prizae. Minister of Australia, Rr. Ralcolm. Fraser. 1Ielcome<br />
Mr,, Fraser.-<br />
Prime MLinister<br />
Thank you very much.<br />
Adcick..<br />
We -talk-t o ' you abo-ut. once -a month -arid wea0vr ga od so,<br />
and it is nice to have you in the studio in person.<br />
' Prime MIUnister<br />
Well, I welcome thei opportunity of speaking with you and through<br />
the station to yout Jisteners.<br />
Adcock A3Md-of bourse-we are on line to the goldfields tonight,. so you<br />
will have a lot of Kalgoorlie listeners. Pnd w~ e will reverse<br />
charges if they wouldl like to phone in. -I suppose we get -so much<br />
discossion about the individual issues, that I thought I would<br />
like to get you to talk for a little while at the beginning of<br />
our time4 tonight about the basic different philosophy between Say)<br />
your Governmrent and the Liberal Party in particular# and say the.<br />
Labor Party: you know, behind the sort of package deal that you<br />
axe off ering as incentives for people to vote and the L-abor Party<br />
doing the same. Obviously there is a philosphy behind the two.<br />
Your philosophy would be different from that of Mr. Bill Hayden,<br />
for example, Could you perhaps just briefly ' outline w~ hat you<br />
see as the basic difference between those two philosophies?<br />
Prime . Minister<br />
In dom~ estic policy, a very essential part of the diiferan-e i6a<br />
that we believe that what Governmrenta can sens. ibly do in<br />
that we have got to try and keep taxes as low as possible so that<br />
individuals will have as imuch to pursue their own lives their<br />
own way, and as msuch to look after their families aa possible.<br />
When Governments need'to act, we should direct our resources<br />
to areas of specific need. But we should not try and do Ithose<br />
things that either individuals or corporations canf do very mruch<br />
better than Government. Govern~ ment shoiuld not get in hhic<br />
of competin~ g wit-h private enterprise. it sholuld not 9,, t in the<br />
bvsiness oi interfering unnecessarily with uhat individua-t8 ' nd<br />
ccmparties might want to do right a ound Austr~ alia. We elso<br />

Prime I'Lnister ( continued)<br />
.4.<br />
a being quite critical about that, if... the Labor Party sees a problem,<br />
Iu st ins yt ey ettheGoermen slv i1 1thro<br />
some money at the problem,. and then hope'it will disappear. But<br />
often-in throwing the money at the problem,-. you canmake it worse'.<br />
AdcockA At the same time, there have. been quite a . nwnber of times during<br />
the course of-your ' Government when you have had to step iihand<br />
say place controls on governments, -or you have been interested<br />
of courge in conswnmer af fairs because: . you believe that free<br />
enterprise perhaps let go can have some problerL.*<br />
Prime RiUnister<br />
Well, we recognise there Is a role-for Government in many, many*-<br />
-areas,] but do not believe in Governwent intrusion just for<br />
th s-eof c-3nte oeoGoverrnment;-J'. at-for-the-sake..<br />
of. inozeasing the influence of people in. Canberra or the influence<br />
of politicians in Canberra. Yes, -we support restrictive trade__<br />
practice legislation. We support consumer legislation. ObviLously,<br />
sensible companies legislation. B~ ut, let me give you a clear*<br />
examnple.' I n all the arguments that went on for years about the<br />
powers '' offshore, and the High Court gave control of Jurisdiction<br />
offshore'to the Comvionwealth, well the Labor Party have said th-at<br />
they* would n~ ova in and exert total Commronwealth control put<br />
their. LoWn departments out into the States to do all the things.-<br />
that-the States have. done by and large quite well for a very long<br />
period.-,-Well, we took quite a dif ferent view. Yven though. we. had<br />
the power, we have negotiated and now legislated for a range of<br />
agreements with the States in which we voluntarily shared the<br />
powr that the High Court had given to us. we did this because<br />
we-zecognise, that there are State admninistrations that have done<br />
these-things for many years, and that that kind of extension of<br />
Canbherra-basedl power is. just plain urecessary. You could give<br />
another example of it: I was speaking with Sir Charles Court<br />
tonight and, he was moaking the point that if it had not been for<br />
the Whitlam years the North West Shelf project would have beenquite.<br />
a distance -along the way. As everyone in Western Australia<br />
L-am sure--knows, everything was signed up just a day or,. two ago..-<br />
Uanpdrr 6tceh hattheLabr Prtywould want toadopt,<br />
they would be wanti-ng. to make all the decisions which Sir Charles<br />
and -his. G overnment have made, as I would believe, to the advanitaqie<br />
of this s; tate. I do not believe Canberra has got ary business<br />
interfering in that sort of bvsiness.<br />
Adcook<br />
Every. now.. and again you get into a bit of trouble where there is'<br />
say a policy as far as the Federal Government is concerned which<br />
seens -to.._ Conflict. with what is happening in th-e States-you know,.<br />
the case in point weas the Noonkanbah situation, and you -have had<br />
a.. bit-problezm with Mr.. Bjelke Petersen in Queenislai~ d ovsx -POlce<br />
regarding . briiNucoew, s . I -guess what *-Vu try to do is to<br />
* negotiate with the. State over that,., buL . if -the State sort of tli gs<br />
its heels in,' you -are reluactant to use Coin. onwealth powers<br />
to over-ride them. </p>
<p>6PR, 5/ 10/ 80._-3<br />
Prime tKinister<br />
Well, thefe is one thing I think that is sometimes overlooked.-<br />
If the cause of Aboriginals is going to be advanced and I think<br />
it has been enormously in recent years the Commonwealth and<br />
State Governments do need to act in co-operation, in harrmony.<br />
If you are going to have the. State admihistration and the Federal<br />
administration having differing views and a differing approach,<br />
then that is -going to frusb~ ate and hinder the developmaent of the<br />
normal serviceswhich flow out to the -Aboriginal people,' quite<br />
apart from hindering all the special progra3~ es which are very<br />
specificallyldirected to Aboriginal people. The Commonwealth does<br />
bel. ieve and this was the case with Aurukun that we ought to get<br />
to a negotiated position with Queensland, which we did. I do not<br />
want to add to anything that has been said in relationi to<br />
Noonkanbah. But I amt-q uite sure that everygne hopers that these<br />
matters can be properly. solved by negotiation on future<br />
occasions.<br />
__ Adcock Thank you very Touch. We would like to invite. listener$ to phone.<br />
in. -The lines are now wide open, if you would'like to put a<br />
question . to thf Prime Minister, or m~ ake a point.<br />
Arnette is -the first. Hello Annette.<br />
Caller Hello. . Good evening Neil and fir."-raser. I would Just like to<br />
say hatI'm a parent and I think it is dis usting what your<br />
Government has done to the teenagers of this country.. You've<br />
made them really for A pittance, You've done nothing, you'vye<br />
done nothing to help them and encourage them, even though' they<br />
had good educations, some of them. And I think that unles's your<br />
change your policy, you are going to be the loser, and well as<br />
the children of this country. Avstralia's a lucky country, but<br />
for all -the youngsters loo)~ ing' for work, it's very unlucky,<br />
Pri-ne Minister<br />
Well, I think we have done a very great deal for the young people<br />
of this country. We have introduced a number of programmes which<br />
are specif ically' designed to give training opportunities to youn~ g<br />
people. This year, indeed, 230,000 or nore people will be assisted<br />
under those training programmes. Ismtmstikta ' me<br />
of theoin wouild not really b~ e necessary is schools wer8 doing<br />
e ve r yt ing that they ought to do. But, be'that as it may, twe are<br />
establislhing with teStates---dditional programas to help young<br />
Aus~ ralians who leave -school-with inadequate skill * s or train~ ing<br />
to get jobs and we are also goinbg to introduce a new training<br />
allowance which will encourage eligible unermployed Aistraliais<br />
-young Australians to go into a training OPPOrtunity. we are<br />
workin~ g with the States to provide much greater funds ' for technaical<br />
educat ion, -vocational -education. I think 1 is Is an area whicb has<br />
been vexy. much-weail, it has been the poor cousinl in eduoati; Dm,<br />
not I hin-so much over the last thiree Or " Our Years, but efr<br />
that I certainly think it was. 3 </p>
<p>6PR, 4-<br />
Adcock Greater stress has been placed on academic education rather<br />
than technical education.'.<br />
Ptilue H4inister<br />
I think the, secondary schcols have placedl much to6omuch stress<br />
on academic education, and I think they have given many students<br />
who j ust do -not cope with academic wr but probably have<br />
other; skil1gwhjch should be drawn and encouraged a sense., of<br />
frub&amp; tiation,_. a sense of failure which then, if they do not: get a<br />
job' when they leave school, is just compounded. I really do believe<br />
* that it. is the job of. every school to find something that every<br />
stu dent can do well. * I do believe there are things that every<br />
at~ ident can do well and to the-extent that schools do not achieve...<br />
1~-Vr egard the school as having failed the studenttnc mr<br />
t -ha-nh e student as having failed at school, Butlover the last<br />
year-there are a record nuiberof eprni-ee. a an<br />
thveare willI . U'a ry a r. i int ake' this . com ing year. I think it. is<br />
not ' generally realised that total employment over the last year<br />
increased by over 200,000 -and that is the largest. increase for<br />
ten years&gt;, Hr. Hayd-en-Is offering to provide only 100,000 jobs.<br />
at-a -very* considerable cost to taxpayers. something which in a<br />
sense is' exciting, teenage, employment has gorwn over the last<br />
12 months more than it has for 15 years. I think that single figure<br />
is areal sign that the policies -that we have to assist your g<br />
People -are. in Ifact working, and working effectiv~ 1y.<br />
Call16r Good evening tyou.-both, ApThe Liberal Governmentpurchase3<br />
the VIP aircraft in spite of public controversy over the cost to<br />
the taxpayer of $ 42 million,, plus maintenance, -etcetera.<br />
Press reports tell us that in f ive years of Government, the Liberal<br />
Party's overseas trips in the VIP aircraft have cost the taxpayer.<br />
over $ 12. million infspitiL of our pledge not to be a tourist<br />
Prime M. inister. .14ay. I ask 14r. ? raser who sanctioned the use of<br />
the ' VIP aircraf t at-a cost of 000 to the taxpayer for<br />
Mr. Anthony to fly to t4. S. W. in order to be a character witness<br />
tzravel-on-a commercial flight for his own personal business..<br />
This phenomenal cost to the poor--tax~ ae f~, 0 for Just a few<br />
minutes in a court of law.<br />
Prime M'inister<br />
Xr. Sinclair. is a collegeau of Mr. Anthony's.. Mr-AnthonY had'_<br />
been on business that he had to do because he was Deputy Prime<br />
Kiiister and Min ister for TJrade.-When he was askL: d to be a<br />
chairacter witness for Ian Sinclair, he obviously-wanted to be, and<br />
it hatd to be fitted with other schedules and other engagements, : 1<br />
* regard the ' use, of the aircraft as a completply proper one, I think'.<br />
the way that Ian Sinclair had been pilloried-through the Parliamnent,<br />
evidence that had comne out of that Corporate Affairs-C-otruission<br />
into'the-Parliament to denigrate his name, part-heard, was'tota). y<br />
disgraceful and a denial of natural justice in Pustralia*. And every<br />
rmemberof the Labor Party from Mr. Hayden down shouild be totally<br />
S of A -the e~ L' . bc c~ ur -t Om3tt<br />
ir: that-particula r matter. That would be the genteral view, I an </p>
<p>6PRI 5/ 10/ 80 SPrime<br />
Minister ( continued)<br />
certain, of the Australian community, Mr. sinclair was founcd<br />
to-be totally innocent of trumped-up and politically based<br />
charges laid by the NSW Government, by the NSW Corporate Affairs<br />
Comission ' under the Director of the NSW Attorney-General. i an<br />
very glad that Mr. Anthonfdid go to act as character witness for'<br />
M4r. Sinclair. But I would tlike to say something if I could.<br />
I was not asked a question,-the other things were stated as facts.<br />
The cost of those aircraft is only a mere fraction well, -it'<br />
certainly was not $ 42 million 1 think it was about $ 7 million an<br />
aircraft. They do a great deal of work for the Cefence forces.<br />
They are defence aircraft. They ar'e not in the VIP fleet. ' They<br />
have been carrying ref uqeea from Australia to this couritxy. ' They<br />
have been carrying-Australian troops to Butterworth on many<br />
occasions. They have been carrying Austral * ian military personnel<br />
to the United. States, who have to go on defence purchase missions.<br />
F'or many of these tasks, if the defence transport 707s were no t<br />
available, defence-yould. havke had to charter aircraft as they used<br />
to before they owned them. -' So far PieIiiser4<br />
conaerned, one of the considerations in purchasingte aic t<br />
was the security advice which-1 ad been. givens that I do travel<br />
* internationally on a commercial aircraft, I am putting-tlfti 300 or<br />
400 other passengers at an unreasonable. level of risk. 1 cannot<br />
emphasise too strongly that point, it would be'alittle -late<br />
to apologise to the relatives of those 300 or 400 passengers if<br />
ant aircraft went down because an Australian Primne Hinister happened<br />
to be on the aircraft. This is a very material point, and the<br />
major point apart from the defence use, in the purchase of the<br />
aircraft. The only other thing that I would like to say is that<br />
if the Parliamentary record is read out accurately, it will be seen<br />
that in ' current day prices the number of visits on an annual<br />
basis by my Ministers has been muach less than that under the<br />
Labor years, and it will also be seen that the number of vistsby<br />
Prime Ministers were less on an annual basis and the cost<br />
overall was a fraction of the cost in the Labor years. I would<br />
also say -I am sorry about this, but the question had a slight<br />
political tmfotivation in it, I think I ought to give the answer-<br />
I tbink. there Is all the difference between looking at Creek<br />
ruins'and contributing to the Comonwealth resolving the very<br />
difficult racial problems in Zimbabwe. I think the recent meeting<br />
I was--at in New Delhi wbere 16 members of the Cor~ Ofwealthregional<br />
cou) ntries al1l met together to discuss practical<br />
prolem -I make no apology for this, it is to those sorts of<br />
mneetings where practical co-operation is advanlzed, where racial<br />
tensions are eised, and the possibility of war in Southern A~ frica<br />
grea2tly xeduced; they are very productive results from<br />
Australia's foreign policy in recent years and fromn Trhy<br />
participation in it. Whatever the cost ' has been, it has been<br />
very, very much worthwhile in the interests of Australia and of a<br />
wider community.<br />

Cong-ratulations. And very best wishes for your election.<br />
Could-I ask you though, is ther Government goinAg to introduce<br />
conscription in. peacetime. if not, where are the rumours<br />
cozfingff rom?<br />
Prime Mini ster<br />
The rumours ' are coming from the Australian Labor Party. Let<br />
metef-yousomthin tht hppened in the parlianent in the last<br />
week; Wran said we were going to introduce conscription..<br />
I'said we were not, KiXff-said we were not, tat it was<br />
not' Government. policy.-r. Hayden said we were going to introduce<br />
conscription, and he said he had a document to prove it.<br />
Kr. Xillen to double check, werit to.-the Chief of the Defence*<br />
Force Staff,: to-the Secretary of Defence, to the Service Chiefs,<br />
atheof had bseen doing any wvork wich he as Minister<br />
ht~ niof'boenn eaOf ut shbldhavei'betn iriormed, on; Th<br />
all saia -no, they had been doing no work) there was no Defence<br />
Department document on the subject of conscription and the<br />
preparation for conscription. Teso-called exeroise was given<br />
a somwhat * dramatic and Draconian term, operation Manhaiulw.<br />
I think-that-shobld have, made people cautious to start with, because<br />
if you were undertaking that operation, I am sure you would not<br />
bcel -In t*" Operatiort Hanhaul". But the Defence people vent on<br />
look-ing.* Theyfouna that some CMI' Reserve of ficers. and these are<br />
part-time people who'do a wonderful job of servIce to the country<br />
had set themselves * an exercise, in their own way, as to ' h t wuld<br />
happen if there-had-to be conscription at some tins in ~ the future.<br />
Reserve-officers set themselves exercises all the time all<br />
around the country. But that does not make what they do<br />
Goverrnment policy. -It appeared that this particula-r exercise,'<br />
and the document that Mx. Hayden-claimed he had, or thought he had,<br />
camre out an--exercise of this kind. In other words, it was a<br />
classroom operation, a schoolbook pperation, whicb had nothing<br />
whatever to do with defence policy.--I have not the slightest<br />
doubt that Mr, Hayden, knew that, -and Mr. lWran knew that, when they<br />
first ra-ised the question. It was a cruel and base deception,<br />
Mdooch<br />
f reported in tohight's news that because some of the polls recently<br />
. f I-seem to have been going against the G~ overnment and f avouring the.<br />
J~ * i~ 7 Labor Party, that there was A possible switchi your errphasiis<br />

It is not a switch. I have-been speaking about defence matters<br />

There is increased surveillance and patrolling Of the Indian<br />
Ocean, so this is a logical place erth to talk about<br />
defence. I had always intended to do so, but it is not a new<br />
tack or. a change or whatever.<br />
Adcock* What about the polls that have been coming out. othey<br />
distuxrb you?-<br />
Prime Minister,<br />
They do not disturb me, because I thinX they are really<br />

adequate majority, * and a majority in the Senate, ibecaue I ust<br />
cannot belifeve-that thib'Australian-people are going to, throw away<br />
the gains of the last five years and go back to re-cycled Whitlam<br />
policies . whicki is what xr. liayden is offering.<br />
Caller Itru a. spokesperson for the Social Welfare Action Group in<br />
Western Australia, so my questions obviously are going to be<br />
relating to social welfare. 1' would ' like ' to put to you, IMr,. Praser,<br />
that the. non-Government welfare sector is i~ a situation of slow<br />
death; that in the Lieraj party policy platform there has been<br />
the promvise to give continuedlsipport to the noni-Governm~ ent welfare<br />
sector. In reality these groups have not had-their grants<br />
indexed since 1975, so this means in effect there has been a<br />
50 per cent cut. For instance, ACOSS, which you know IRr. Fraser<br />
-is the Australian Council Of Social Services, they are at present<br />
experiencing the effects of this funding cutbacl
being near bankruptcy. At present they are still awaiting on<br />
renewal* of their Government grant. One of the results of such<br />
cutbacks is that the'voluntary welfare agencies are now facing an<br />
enormous emergency relief bill. They are pic~ king up the tab for<br />
the Government. due to the inadequacy iin the amuts -provided for<br />
pensions and benefits, Xr. Fraser, you tnentioned the isas~ of<br />
unemployment with one of the previous callers. I would like to<br />
dra'W to your attention that uneployment is now about 180,000 more<br />
in nuz &gt; ar than when your Gove4rnment came into office. And, I also<br />
would like to draw to your attention the latest figures as pr-oduced<br />
by tZhe Brotherhood of St. Lawrence and confirmed by Pxofe~ so<br />
Henderson* show that there are approximately 2 million Australi"-ns<br />
living below the poverty line. This figure includes. faziiie3.<br />
with young childriEfi-I'ahszkf-r y ou, Rr. FraSer, Whether yoza<br />
will. give an unequivocal undertaking -firstly to provide adequate<br />
funding for the voluntary welfare sector, and by adequate I menan<br />
incdev. ed funds-, and secondly, whether you -will bring the anokint<br />
f~ Ct~ h ~ iArid b_-enef its to -above the ~ pover~ y line. </p>
<p>6PlP, 5/ 10/ 80 -0-<br />
Prilize Minister<br />
. We-are. giving miuch greater funds to welfare and to non-government.<br />
ozganisations. -1 would-have to ask Senator Guilfoyle. about<br />
the. -particular grants to particular organisations, but the funds<br />
we -are giving, and the co-operation that. we are pursuing, with<br />
non-governmnt-organisations is very -very substantial indeed.<br />
nl Dut~ thexe axe a number-of. things that.-I would like to say-<br />
Pensions * during the ' past i-hree years have reached * a higher<br />
proportion of average weekly earnings because of our policies of<br />
-indexing penisions-twice a yerto. the ConsumrPieIne. Te<br />
arew a-higher proportion of average weekly earnings than. they _ have..-<br />
ever been. NoCw, 1. know Nr. IMayden in, his policy rpeech said that<br />
i n the Budget he introduced pensions got to 25.2 per cent of<br />
average.. weekly earnings-and that they had fallen since. But the<br />
f igure. that. he gave, I am af raid was not re al ly an accu?. ate~ one.,<br />
because he took the peniolelastwa goin to be in<br />
N~ ovember of 1975 and put it over the average weekly earning figure<br />
as it was in June of 1975, when be should have put the pension<br />
-fi-ur jN ove'ber-. 19-7-5. over -the Novembe. r. 19.75., avcrag! e wely<br />
earnings to get an. accurate f igure. In the years Since 1975,<br />
pebsioiis -have come'to a-higher proportion of average weekly<br />
eazrings. the. n it-ever d~ d during the Labor years. So that ' does<br />
not-seem to indicate--increasing difficulty as your. question would<br />
~ imply-.---And also, in. the, last Budget, We introdu-ed. substantially I<br />
increased benefits to.-assist I think well over halt'a millio?----<br />
between half a million and three quarters of a million childrenwh,<br />
6-are. the children of welfare beneficiaries.' That was a very<br />
substantial increase overall costing significantly' over<br />

Ina Sense, I am sorry that the question is put in the terms<br />
that AIt is, because I do not think it is in accord with the<br />
facts and the actual record of the Government. And one other'<br />
small thing that we are going to do is to establish a small but<br />
hope large In its impact a national children's foundation<br />
in co-operation with the States and with voluntary organisations,<br />
to helti-cope with the problems of child abuse, to have a better<br />
education of~ the whole community that this is a real problem;~ that<br />
there are a lot of cases that do not know get reported, and thereis<br />
miuch t-hat the community and more that some voluntary<br />
or-ganisations can do to help that. The only other comnment<br />
that 7 would like to make is one that Professor Henderson himself<br />
made-in his report on poverty. That is, that inflation does more<br />
harm to poor people and ink a sense, more than discounts any<br />
benefits that particular programmes ' might have for people. Hie said<br />
that the control of inflation is terribly. Imprtant f'r-the poor<br />
peoleir ' the c6ommunity. Our efforts-in that regard should not<br />
be overlooked. That is not something that just helps business, it<br />
helps people.<br />
Adcock, It might be an idea, since Sebina has sort of put her case in<br />
writing, Ibecause she stated it quite concisely, that perhaps she<br />
might, like to send that information to Senator Guilfoyle and<br />
ask for specific answers.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Well, if we have it in writing here I would bp-very happy to<br />
get an answer, and 1-will give you a copy of the answer also,<br />
because if you are ; asking about the I do not carry in my mind<br />
the precise _ funding arrangements for every individual organisation,<br />
and I am sure Margaret Guilfoyle would have a very precice and<br />
effective answer to the precise question about ACOSS for example.<br />

I.: th inrk th at is a fair enough question. There is not really wage<br />
-control through. the. Arbitrat-ion Commission because the Government<br />
1' certainly cannot, control it. what there is the Arbitration<br />
Commission" is, ina sense, the third man, or -the wnpirie, Ehat<br />
settles arguments between-employers arid employees. It is not-,<br />
controlled,. in the strict sense, that arbitrary limtits are placed<br />
on-wmages as a result of ' the PArbitration Commission. It-does, in<br />
any etermination of the Commission,; establish. a minimum-whichemplyerp.<br />
a cnlneos thn tat inium. But trade unions<br />
and 1-think not always to their ' own advantage often negotiate<br />

-Commission establishes.. I think.. that is one of the things* thathelps<br />
sometimes to dissuade companies from employing more pe.-ople,-<br />
but nevertheless it happens. Aknd so it is -jot really wage contrl<br />
-it is a-way of settling an argument... There is the PriceJstfct<br />
" Tribunal which do-es-cana arnd it does -report on price cbanges<br />
-in a~ -nuber of areias, in a number of industries' The -patrol<br />
industry is one. which is subject to continuous reporting, and I<br />
thn for. very-obvious reasons. ut pric-es -pre aiso restrin. b<br />
was -in another. case on another subject,* which I had becorae<br />
involved in. I think the whole commnunity must be concerned about<br />
those * who are less well off. it is tight -_-and proper that<br />
Church -orgarijeations and voluntary organisations. should show ' a<br />
great. concern in these areas. But one of the things that people<br />
sometimes forget is that if we are-to look after the disadvant-aged,<br />
if we-are to look after the old, if we are to establish the<br />
oir Iumstances where all people at all times can live i. n dignity<br />
and -teiifesteem, we have to build a more properous and wealthier<br />
country. All of this takes great resources.. I think it is about<br />
$ 1010.00 ' Million a year going in* welfare payments through the<br />
Departm~ ent of Social'Security. _-It is an enormous sum It cannot<br />
bei plucked-. off a cargo cult tree. If we are goin~ g to improve. the<br />
services to the poor, to -the old, to the disadvantaged, to the<br />
sick,, then we need a country that it groing in wealth and<br />
p;, sperity so that not only families and individuals have the<br />
resources for their ownr needs Government-will also have the<br />
resource . s to enab -" it-to provid'e th-e kindof -services-that: parple--<br />
want in a modern society. 1 think people sometimnes. forget that<br />
we -have a particular-concern in these welfare areas; that a<br />
Government. tha does not pay attention to the grow th in the<br />
economy to the expans ion -of the economy, is not really acting in<br />
thei best interests of people who need help in the community,<br />
because if you do not pay attention to a growiflg economy ultimately<br />
you -are-not going . to have the resources to provide the sorts of<br />
services to establish the sorts of programes that,% you teart.<br />
Caller*-What I would like to bring up is a-double.-question. First of all<br />
concerning wage and price control, is that the Goverment has<br />
an arbitration system to control the wages.-. you know, the prices<br />
to'take their own couxse. When we are trying to balance your<br />
income a-nd your income expenditure you would have to take the<br />
two-sades into account.-</p>
<p>6PR, 5/ 10/ 80 1<br />
Prime Minister ( continued)<br />
there is vety relcompetition between the different<br />
manufacturers. They are doing. everything they can I know to<br />
keep prices * as'' low as possible because one manufacturer wants to<br />
pinch-. sales off another mraiufacturer. This sort of competition<br />
out in the commercial world again puts a very real ceiling on<br />
the kind of price levels that people can ef fectively ask, So, it<br />
is not really, accurate to say that there is wage control and<br />
nothing that can help to bring down the prices, You have got to<br />
look at the sort of circumstances that exist in wages.<br />
negotiations and the kind of market circumstances which make it<br />
very difficult* sometimaes for companies or businesses to put Lip<br />
prices.. Caller M -Prize Minister, would -it -he feasible. o. veneftf....<br />
re-elected, to reduce the taxes payable by ernployers-by a certain<br />
amount f or every new person they employed, For this to work<br />
without the Governmrent having to find. extra funds for this: scheme<br />
the amount redifced per, petson would be equivalent to that of the<br />
unemployment, benefits, thus, in effect having two main goals.<br />
one, a ssistin~ g employers in increasing staff as arsl fmr<br />
money from less tax payable; and, two, decreasing the numbers<br />
unemployed. ' Could such a.-scheme be considered?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Schemes of that kind have been considered. I think you would find<br />
it very hard to make them work effectiVely, because what would<br />
happen is that reducing the payroll tax-which is a State tax<br />
anyway it is not a Colmmonwealth tax reducing the payroll tax in<br />
that way would end up by subsidising a. lot. of employment which was<br />
going to take place anyway,_ LBecause even if an employment<br />
situation is static within a State not going to change over<br />
the course of the year when you -looked at the position. of<br />
individual firms, the firms that were doing well you would find<br />
would be expanding employment and therefore they would be getting a<br />
payroll tax rebate if that is what you called it and the6 firms<br />
that were doing badly would be reducing employment siinPly because<br />
So, over a period of time you would end up with a Government<br />
subsidy for a lot of increase in employment for all those firns<br />
that were doing well and that increase in employment probably % would<br />
have taken place anyway. I -think the on~ ly way xreal te; P-~<br />
employment is to do what we ate doing: to get Australian businesses<br />
profitable so that we sell more Austral ian-made goods in Australia<br />
and we sell more Australian-made goods overseas, Manufacturipg<br />
exports increased by 30 per cent, last year, and that obviously<br />
mca~ s those fir-is are employing more people. over the whole of last<br />
Year, we . got m~ ore than 200,000 more pepe. in employment than.<br />
12 months ago. Tihat is the best. qrotthof employmnent for 10 yar.<br />

and everyone I have spoken to, and I guess anyone who has been<br />
watching TV recently, they are bewildered by your speech followed<br />
by. Mr. Hayden's speech in which the economy and what the welfare<br />
and all the other things that you are both promising revolves around<br />
how much it is going to cost. * You argue with Mr. Hayden that<br />
his is going to cost more than he says, and he on the other hand<br />
argues that yours is going to cost more than you say. Now,<br />
Mr. Hayden has challenged you -' or shall I Just put it asked you,<br />
to appear together on TV and discuss the matter in a sensible<br />
manner so that the whole of the electorate of Australia can make<br />

that woul1d have costed $ 800 million for 50,000. jobs.<br />
$ 600 million for 50,000.-Ta was accurately. costed on the basis<br />
of experience that the p evious Labor Government had had. So, if<br />
we were taking those figbtres, we would have said the 100,000 jobs<br />
would have coat double that: $ 1,600 mhillion. Well, we were very<br />

because it is, just part of current policy. if you went through<br />
that N. S. W. document, the whole thing was a farce and obviously<br />
th-rows Mr. Wran's credibility into jeopardy. ' The OAS thing I<br />
think might br-ing it hope to people a little bit, is that the<br />
cost of those six major programmes of Mr. Hayden's will be ni'ore<br />
than $ 8 a week for ever. y. talxpayer in the country. That is what<br />
it would cost, qjuite apart from all the other programmes that<br />
have not been costed.<br />
There is just one other point that I would like to make, because<br />
I think this shows-that Kr., Hayden himself has admitted really<br />
that the cost of his programmes will be well over $ 2 billion;<br />
because he said that his progra. es would benefit families to the<br />
extent of $ 20 a week. Now, if you work out for something like<br />
2.3 billion or 4 billion families, at 20 a week, that comes to<br />
well over bilo.' o f your promises are going to benefit<br />
fatmothlieee xtnt f $ 0 aweek, the co~ st has to be very much<br />
over $ 2 billion. Now, that is pretty much the costing that we<br />

East. Ther-is no guarantee that suppli * es will be available. It<br />
-wold be-very easy for this war-to result in the Straits of Hormuz<br />
being blocked. if they were blocked you have something like<br />
per cent of the world's oil production going through those<br />
Straits_.' It just would not. be able to get to the consuming<br />
countries of the world. Then the difficulties for many, many<br />
nations would be immense. Now we owe It to our children.. to pur~ sue<br />
polcie to g9i~ va. e. th. em th e s. aame -ki. n, d in -depen de. n , ce-a nad<br />
self-sufficiency in oil as. we have ourselves. You have got a local<br />
example of what happens with the right policies. The North West<br />
Shelf is an engrgy project: a massive one, the biggest thing<br />
ever undertaken in Australia. But it would not go if there were<br />
not the right pricing poiis fthere were not the right<br />
encouragement for investment. But it is going to give<br />
Western Australia, because they are the right policies, a great<br />
source of energy. it will give Australia exports and it will also<br />
mean a very large number of jobs. The great mining and<br />
development projects will be one of the things which will provide<br />
a -very real boost to employment in the years ahead of us.<br />
So, there axe very solid xeasons why we should stay with the<br />
policy. Adcock If -that Is the case, then Mr. H-ayden, who says that if he gains<br />
Goverrnent he is going to freeze petrol prices for 12 Toonths,<br />
what effect will that have?<br />
Prine Minister<br />
I think the policy, 1 am afraid, is a bit of a fraud, because<br />
he has riot really said he would freeze petrol prices, He wouald<br />
fre-eze the price of petrol out of Bass Strait. But 30 per cent<br />
of what we buy still comes from overseas.-There is no way he can<br />
freeze. that price. You would have to g0 on. payi-na 1whatever the<br />
world price is for that. ' That is just another way of<br />
devionstrating that if we let it go on just usina up Bass Strait<br />
so that we do not have 70 -per cent of our own, you then have<br />
then 40%, then 20% until it runs dow-n until almost nothing,<br />
you are forced t'. o pay the . world price whatever it is. And the fact<br />
that we have got our own oil or a substantial part of it enables<br />
us to use as a bench-mark the lowest world bri-c-e is the Saudi.<br />
A-rabian light crude price, and that is keeping our petrol a..<br />

Prima, Z'nister 7<br />
Well, there has been a'bit of scare talk recently about this.<br />
Now, if the-war between Iran and Iraq had not taken place,, we'<br />
would have been able to say quite categorically that '_ thei latest<br />
* price--increase from Sauidi Arabia at $ 2.00' a barrel would have had<br />
aiv. impact-if we had'applied that price* in-the normlz * course of'<br />
events f-rom the* first of January-we would-be making the decision<br />
SUppO~ e-. sO'etiMein Dec eim1-er--i t-would have had'an irnqc~ a<br />
of significantly less-than a rcent a litre.' And it has that;<br />
that ' impact. because of our strengthening dollar. It is a technical<br />
matter,* but that' is just adjusting the ' Price as it -has been over<br />
the-last couple of years'-less than a cent a-litre. Now, that<br />
is* not a fright ening'change. That puts intU-perspectiveI1 think<br />
the -sorts of claims that Mr." Haydent has been making that it is<br />
going to po to 45 cents, almost in a matter of -weeks he suggests.<br />
But the Middle East war has made it unpredictable. If that war<br />
is controlled, if it ends, well then that probably will be the<br />
position. Saudi Arabia is producing m~ ore to make up for the<br />
shortfal.. But if the war did happen to * extend ' and I am not<br />
predicting that -it will,-I tend to think that it will not but if<br />
it-didl, and. if -there was major disruption instead of just<br />
disruption from Iran and Iraq-,. then the worla would get into a<br />
s rious position, Lahb or Party is the only political party<br />
that.-I know of in the world, in the f ace of what--is -happening inthe-<br />
Middle Last, that is going-around tryin~ g to suggest to people<br />
that. they could get cheaper petrol... It is Just not on.<br />

We can do without people like her. I have two sonts and they<br />
have never been out of work because they. are hard workers, not<br />
lazy.<br />
Prime mi4nister<br />
I have been saying in the last day or two that about a year or<br />
two ago we $ ntroduced cheap air fares to Britain and to Buzope<br />
* and to the" Uie States. We were obviously doing it for<br />
tourist reasons, and to help people travel, and to help people go<br />
and visit relatives and friends in"' other countrie's. But I have<br />
been saying in a jocular way that it was really all part of a<br />
*.-. deep-laid political plot, because : 1 wanted as many people as<br />
possible to see wfiat Is happening in Britain, to see what is<br />
happening . n Europe,* and the United States, end-then-they will know<br />
very well that Australia is the best country in the world, and<br />
we ae m31oh,. riuchbe t ter -off than people_ nmos t-pl ce.-<br />
Caller I have great difficulty i n believing what you are aupposed to be<br />
trying-to do for me.* I have worked very hard since I caine to<br />
Australia. Every timte I see the average Australian wage, it makes<br />
me laugh., My husband and 1, between us, do not earn that wage.,<br />
Adcock What is the average weekly age as it was last given by the<br />
Bureauo7f Statistics. Can you rememnber it Sheila?<br />
Caller-Something like about $ 200<br />
Adcock It's $ 200 and something i-sn'It it? About $ 230 or something.<br />
Caller No, well we don't earn that -betw een us. We both work hard.<br />
On top of that, I've got a teenage daughter that vl have struggled<br />

<p>6PRI 5/ 10/ 80 -22-<br />
Caller Probably that was wrong to say that, but she was told that if she<br />
stayed until she was I8 anid she wasn't going to go on through<br />
university, it was better for her to try, and get a job then.<br />
Pri'me Minister<br />
Well,! would have thought that that was very bad advice.*-<br />
Caller.<br />
Would you.<br />
Prime' Minister<br />
Yes I would have. I think it is much better for somebody to be<br />
at. a-school -a year lAorcjro&amp; r to get particular* training to help to<br />
geotba Tatexrabit.. o f.-education can sone-tirne&amp; S-make-quite<br />
a difference. We have introduced a number of special training<br />
. progra: 1nmes. We have introduced a number, with the Statels'<br />
co-operation school-to-work transition ptogrammes and a very<br />
large number of people are being assisted by thoseprogrammes.<br />
If you would like me to mak~ e some inquiries for your own daughter.<br />
i1' vouid be very happy to do so, and to get In touch with you<br />
about it within the next day or two to see what possibilities and<br />
-openings there might be that would help, because I re-ally think<br />
pursuing training, 1 pursuing * education, is much better, especially<br />
-if. you-carinot get a job. ut I would be ' quite happy to try and<br />
make some inquiries on behalf of your daughter to see if what is<br />
available,. but if somtething is not available, I would really strongly<br />
urge that she try and get into some form of trainin~ g which will<br />
give-her additional qualifications which would help.<br />
Adcock Could I suggest -perhaps, before sheila hangs up, she leaves her<br />
name and address and perhaps phone number at the board and we will<br />
pas3 this on to you at the end of the programmne.<br />
Prime M4inister<br />
