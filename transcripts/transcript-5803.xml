PRESS OFFICE TRANSCRIPT FRIDAY, 30 APRIL. 19-82<br />
NEWS CONFERENCE WITH VICE. PRESIDENT BUSH.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
We welcomed the opportunity for discusssions with Vice President<br />
Bush and also the emphasis that the President has placed on<br />
consultations not only with Australia but with countries in the<br />
western Pacific, and the Vice President has been taking in Japan,<br />
Korea, Australia.-And New Zealand and going back through China<br />
at a time when there is so much interest and attention being<br />
focused on the Western Alliance and European affairs. it is<br />
certainly good to know that discussions with Pacific countries are<br />
given the proper place. We have had very useful discussions<br />
this morning, there is no need to say that they have been warm<br />
and friendly discussions, because that would be expected, and<br />
there are a great many issues in which there is a real measure<br />
of agreement between the United States and Australia. We<br />
have discussed matters-that have arisen during the Vice President's<br />
visit, problems with the Western Alliance, prospects for the<br />
United States economy, the Australian economy and obviously<br />
we have also discussed the Falkland Islands and the problems<br />
there. This is just to say publicly how much we welcome you<br />
and Mrs Bush and your party being here.*<br />
Vice President Bush<br />
I would like to thank you and memibers of your Cabinet. We had<br />
a long fruitful meeting, frank discussions and in our view<br />
and I know I speak here, with confidence for the President, which<br />
I normally don't do, but on this subject I will, he has great<br />
confidence that the Prime Minister is taking the problems<br />
of mutual concern, the relationship between our countries is<br />
strong and viable, where problems exist we can sit in there and<br />
talk about them very frankly across the table with no holds<br />
barred and that is exactly the way it should be. So I am just<br />
grateful to the Prime Minister for all of his personal timd and<br />
the time of his various ministers who have accorded us on this<br />
quick visit. The other thinq I want to say is that our President<br />
has invited the Prime g~ inister to meet with him in Washington DC<br />
on May 17. . The Prime Minister agreeing to this and<br />
I think your last visit I noted was on June 30, so it is most<br />
timely and the President is looking forwaxd to an opportunity<br />
to exchange views with Prime Minister Fraser.<br />
Question<br />
Does that obviously mean you will miss the Federal Council of your<br />
Party, is that important?<br />
Prime.. Ainister<br />
No I will not be missing the Federal Council-of my Party, but I<br />
obviously will value the opportunity to continue discussions on<br />
some of the aspects we were talking about this morning, with the<br />
President, especially so when it comes at a critical time before<br />
the various meetings taking place in Europe in June. While we<br />
are not a participant of those meetings we are obviously affected<br />
by their final outcomes, juast as all countries-will be affected by thew~<br />
so I value that opportunity very much indeed. </p>
