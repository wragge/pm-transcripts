TRANSCRIPT OF JOINT NEWS CONFERENCE WITH SENATOR THE HON<br />
GARETH EVANS QC AND SENATOR THE HON GRAHAM RICHARDSON,<br />
PARLIAMENT HOUSE, 22 NAY 1989<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
PM: I apologise that Senator Richardson has been delayed,<br />
but we understand that you've got some other timetable and<br />
deadline and schedule that you want to adhere to so we<br />
decided it best to start.<br />
The Cabinet considered the question of Antarctic<br />
environment at its meeting this morning and we have decided<br />
that we will not sign the Minerals Convention, but instead<br />
will pursue the urgent negotiation of the comprehensive<br />
environmental protection convention within the framework of<br />
the Antarctic Treaty system. We recognise that the proposal<br />
to have such a Convention could offer something better than<br />
the existing situation or no Convention at all, but we<br />
believe it wasn't acceptable to us in terms of the absolute<br />
commitment that the Australian Government has to no mining<br />
in the Antarctic.<br />
So we will be pursuing, as we've indicated in our joint<br />
Press Release, in the relevant forums the attempt to create<br />
such an expanded and comprehensive Convention to protect the<br />
environment there. Within that context to attempt to secure<br />
the establishment of an Antarctic Wilderness Park.<br />
Let me make the point in regard to the concept of an<br />
Antarctic Wilderness Park that this is to be pursued within<br />
the extisting framework of the Antarctic Treaty system which<br />
provides a context in the framework for such an<br />
international regime to be established.<br />
We recognised, and the whole Cabinet understood, that to<br />
achieve what we want to do, this comprehensive protection of<br />
the environment in the Antarctic is not going to be a simple<br />
process. Putting it the other way, it's going to be<br />
extremely hard row to hoe because there is, as we understand<br />
it, a fair degree of opposition to that approach.<br />
Nevertheless, we believe that there is a growing perception<br />
around the world of the responsibility that governments have<br />
to protect these fragile environments. That is a generally<br />
growing perception we believe and it has been enhanced more<br />
recently by the disastrous oil spill in Alaska. So we<br />
intend to try and muster within the international community<br />
all the support we can for this approach. </p>
<p>As I say with my colleagues in the Press Release in the<br />
visits that I arnd Gareth and Graham Richardson will be<br />
undertaking in the near future, we will use those visits as<br />
an opportunity to press the Australian Government position.<br />
So let me sum it up by saying the Australian Government is<br />
opposed to mining in the Antarctic and because of that firm<br />
position that we have we do not intend to sign the<br />
Convention and instead will pursue the concepts, as I say,<br />
the comprehensive Antarctic Environmental Convention and<br />
within that context the hope to establish an Antarctic<br />
Wilderness Park.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime minister, from statements from Senator<br />
Richardson earlier it would seem that the Government wasn't<br />
going to end up on this course. What's swung the Cabinet<br />
and the Government around to this position?<br />
PM: Well, let me go to it. There was a view which in part<br />
of the comment I've made that goes to that. There was a<br />
view, an understandable view, that the Moratorium which<br />
exists down there is a Moratorium which is expressed as<br />
being in place until such time as a local minerals<br />
Convention was signed and an attitude that the Convention<br />
would be necessary and desirable to have a regime within<br />
which you would be able to control, regulate and possibly<br />
prevent mining. Now in our consideration of this matter, we<br />
have come to the view that we want to have Australia in a<br />
position where, not only are we opposed to mining, but in a<br />
sustainable international position, can be said to be<br />
opposed to mining and acting in that way. Now there is no<br />
way, as we studied the matter in terms of international law,<br />
that you could sign the Convention but with a reservation<br />
which said you were opposed to mining because as a matter of<br />
international legal convention and interpretation such an<br />
unqualified reservation would, in fact, be not acceptable<br />
from a signatory. And as that became clear and as we were<br />
firm in our position that we were opposed to mining that<br />
course of action was not possible.<br />
JOURNALIST: How strong was the vote in Cabinet?<br />
PM: As in nearly all positions in my Cabinet there was no<br />
vote and we don't only have consensus in the community we<br />
have it in the Cabinet.<br />
JOURNALIST: Well, was it overwhelming view of Cabinet<br />
members that this should be<br />
PM: Let me say that there was no vote, because we don't<br />
have votes in the Cabinet, and in the end, there was no<br />
expression of opposition to the course of action.<br />
JOURNALIST: [ inaudible] </p>
<p>PM: Well I have addressed that point and we've indicated<br />
that it could be in that sense some improvement, but what we<br />
are saying is that as we discussed this matter and wanted to<br />
sustain a position of the Australian Government being<br />
opposed to and being able to be opposed to mining, the<br />
advice clearly was that you couldn't sign the Convention and<br />
at the same time enter a reservation which said that you<br />
were opposed to mining and would stop mining. Now you can't<br />
have that position sustainably with our opposition to<br />
mining. And so we've also taken the view in that context<br />
that there is a possibility of a changing attitude amongst<br />
nations who have hitherto expressed views on this question.<br />
We think there is a changing world climate of opinion, if I<br />
can put it that way, which is a function both of the general<br />
increase and awareness of the responsibility of governments<br />
in this generation to protect the planet generally and most<br />
particularly in regard to the Antarctic, because of the<br />
experience of the recent oil spill in Alaska, an increasing<br />
understanding of the absolute fragility of that environment.<br />
So while we quite frankly acknowledge that there will be<br />
difficulties in attempting to change views of government<br />
towards the position that we are adopting we nevertheless<br />
believe that Australia has a responsibility to take a lead<br />
in this matter.<br />
JOURNALIST: Well Mr Hawke, what if the worst comes to the<br />
worst and you aren't able to get the support you want for an<br />
Antarctic Wilderness Park? Where does that leave you<br />
PM: We are not going to be consumed at this point by what,<br />
in the sense that you put it, is a worst case scenario.<br />
What we are committed to now is to exercise as much<br />
influence as we can both at officials levels and at the<br />
level of Ministers with Gareth, myself, Senator Richardson,<br />
to try and get the sort of outcome that we think is<br />
appropriate, and we think the appropriate outcome is a<br />
commitment to no mining. We are not satisfied that the<br />
alternative course of action that had been intelligently<br />
analysed, looked at, we are not satisfied that pursuing that<br />
course is consistent with that unqualified opposition that<br />
we have to mining so we are going to use all the resources<br />
that we have at the official and governmental level to try<br />
and change attitudes on this point.<br />
JOURNALIST: What sort of reaction do you expect from<br />
international do you expect any adverse<br />
PM: Let's be quite straightforward about it, there will be<br />
many significant players who, on the basis of their known<br />
positions on this point, will be opposed to the Australian<br />
position. But Australia, under this Government, has not<br />
been a country which just wets its finger to the aura of<br />
international opinion and says well that's what determines<br />
Australia's position, if we believe that something is right<br />
then we have been prepared to pursue it. That's been true<br />
whether you look at questions of nuclear testing, South<br />
Pacific nuclear free zones, some quite critical questions in </p>
<p>PM ( cont): the disarmament area where this Government has<br />
believed that a course of action is what is necessary in the<br />
best interests of the world then we have been prepared to<br />
pursue it. Now we are quite aware of the fact that in<br />
pursuing this course of action there will be opposition but<br />
I go back to the point that we don't live in a static world<br />
and if the attitudes of governments today, in regard to<br />
environmental issues is markedly different, to what it was<br />
even 12 months ago. Gareth has attended, I think it was in<br />
March, the 11th of March in the Hague, the Conference there<br />
that was called by three nations, the French and the<br />
Norwegians and the Netherlands, and the range of attendance<br />
that you got there is something that I think perhaps 12<br />
months ago before that you wouldn't have been regarded as<br />
possible. So we don't believe that we are acting, as I say,<br />
in a static environment which is incapable of change of<br />
attitude and opinion and we think we have got a<br />
responsibility to try and change attitudes.<br />
JOURNALIST: attached to this strategy that we could end<br />
up with no Minerals Convention, a Moratorium which doesn't<br />
hold up if, as some people fear, there are nations out there<br />
who are determined to go ahead and explore?<br />
PM: There are risks in all strategies that one adopts,<br />
whether it is in domestic affairs or international affairs.<br />
What you've got to do is to say ' well what is the basic<br />
objective that you want to achieve?'. Now the basic<br />
objective that we want to achieve is no mining in Antarctic.<br />
We think we have got time to pursue that course of action,<br />
we think there is a chance of persuasion although, as I have<br />
said at the outset of this Press conference, we don't<br />
underestimate the very considerable difficulties through<br />
that course and we will conduct ourselves in a way which is<br />
directed towards achieving that goal. If you have got to<br />
consider a position at the end of those processes as to<br />
where you think the world's best interests and our best<br />
interests are served, well that will be the time to do it.<br />
But we are going to wholeheartedly and without qualification<br />
pursue this course of action now.<br />
JOURNALIST: [ inaudible]<br />
PM: Well one can't be certain of the French position.<br />
Certainly there have been expressions of opinion from<br />
authoritative quarters within France which have expressed<br />
points of view which are similar to the one that we are<br />
expressing. The obvious point to make therefore in response<br />
to your question is that when I meet Prime Minister Rocard<br />
in Paris next month I will obviously be discussing this<br />
matter in very considerable detail with him and hoping to<br />
get French support for our position.<br />
JOURNALIST: Senator Richardson, you've made it clear in the<br />
past that you're pro-convention and so is Senator Evans.<br />
Has it been a case today that you've been converted to the<br />
cause or is it going with the Cabinet flow? </p>
<p>RICHARDSON: Well I've been saying for some months actually<br />
that it was a pretty marginal decision but I favoured<br />
signing. But having said that, there's a good case that we<br />
ought to try to do better as we tried last time, so the<br />
Australian Government's going to try it. That's the<br />
appropriate course of action.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke will World Heritage Listing be a<br />
considerable<br />
PM: No I made the point in an earlier comment that there is<br />
in existence an international Antarctic Treaty system and<br />
that provides the framework within which we are convinced<br />
that the concept of an Antarctic Wilderness Park can not<br />
only as a concept work, but there is a structure there an<br />
international structure which can give effect to it. See<br />
what you've got to understand that is under the World<br />
Heritage concept that the management of an area listed for<br />
World Heritage devolves upon the country in which that area<br />
listed exists. Now you haven't got that situation in the<br />
Antarctic. There's no country which has sovereignty,<br />
exclusive sovereignty or any sovereignty in a sense. You<br />
claims to sovereignty in the Antarctic. So the concept of<br />
World Heritage Listing in that sense doesn't lend itself to<br />
what we are about, but you don't therefore have a vacuum,<br />
you have a situation of the Antarctic Treaty system which<br />
lends itself to both the concept and the supervision and<br />
working of the concept.<br />
JOURNALIST: [ inaudible]<br />
PM: We couldn't do it unilaterally because no-one's got<br />
sovereignty there and so by definition the World Heritage<br />
concept can't apply.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, nobody's going to South<br />
America, or no-one's scheduled to go to South America<br />
PM: Not that I know of. I haven't signed up for anyone to<br />
go to South America.<br />
JOURNALIST: We could expect a lot of this significant<br />
opposition to listing those areas of<br />
PM: Yes, but there's the meeting in Paris in October of the<br />
Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting there. These<br />
countries will be represented there and we're not confined<br />
in terms of communication with these countries simply to<br />
sending Ministers off there. So at both officials level and<br />
in a day to day sense but then in the meeting in Paris in<br />
October there'll be the opportunity to put our views to<br />
these countries.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke is there any possibility ever of being<br />
forced to resurrect the Minerals Convention or do you regard<br />
it now as dead and buried? </p>
<p>PM: Well, you can't say it's dead and buried. It's out<br />
there, it exists and it's part of the international<br />
discussion. So it's not within Australia's province to kill<br />
and then bury something which is the property of a whole<br />
range of people. But as far as Australia is concerned we<br />
are not going down that line. we are saying, ' here is the<br />
decision that we've made, this is what we're going to pursue<br />
and going to concentrate all our resources on trying to<br />
achieve that objective'. Australia will be taking the lead<br />
to try and get a more comprehensive Convention and as part<br />
of that a Convention which involves no mining that's what we<br />
are about.<br />
JOURNALIST: internationally on this. Do you think it<br />
is going to damage our credibility in international<br />
quarters? SENATOR EVANS: I don't think so. We have always made it<br />
clear that we have got an intense and overriding concern for<br />
the protection of the environment. We haven't committed<br />
ourselves to support for this particular Convention, we have<br />
committed ourselves to support for an effective<br />
environmental regime. We are acting consistently with that<br />
and in a way in which I think will not in any way undermine<br />
our credibility.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, are you aware-<br />
SENATOR EVANS: Can I just add to that that we did float the<br />
idea last week in the Paris preparatory meeting of a<br />
comprehensive environmental convention as perhaps an<br />
alternative way through this and it was a proposal which<br />
while meeting with opposition from two or three countries of<br />
a predictable kind US and UK particularly also one a<br />
measure of support including from some South American<br />
countries, conspicuously Chile, and so the item is accepted<br />
as a legitimate one for international discussion and that is<br />
the base on which we will be building as we carry the<br />
initiative forward.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, are you or Senator Evans concerned<br />
about the escalating level of violence in Bougainville and<br />
is the Government looking at any<br />
PM: Yes, of course we are concerned with the evidence of<br />
escalating violence there which tragically is involved with<br />
shooting of an Australian citizen and as I understand from<br />
some information just before I came in here, some gunshots<br />
at workers travelling by bus to the mine. of course we are<br />
concerned about that we are concerned for two fundamental<br />
reasons and they are both of importance the safety<br />
of Australian citizens there are some three to 4,000<br />
Australian citizens who are in the region and whose welfare,<br />
of course, is a matter of considerable concern to us and<br />
secondly, of course, the welfare of Papua New Guinea because<br />
this is a dispute, an issue which goes not merely to the<br />
question of land and so on, the question of shares of </p>
<p>PM ( cont): royalties as distributed between local people,<br />
the provincial government and the central government, but it<br />
goes also to the very fundamental questions of the stability<br />
of the country and the capacity of the central government to<br />
conduct its affairs peacably in the way it wishes to. So<br />
obviously we are concerned. We are monitoring the situation<br />
very closely. The Prime Minister of Papua New Guinea is due<br />
to arrive here on Wednesday and obviously this will be a<br />
matter which will be very much at the top of the agenda of<br />
matters that I'll be discussing with him.<br />
JOURNALIST: So are we looking at contingency plan to<br />
protect Australians in Bougainville, Mr Hawke?<br />
PM: In what I said before about monitoring the situation<br />
closely and that I referred to the welfare of Australian<br />
citizens, obviously without being alarmist about it, and I<br />
don't intend to be, but obviously our people in watching<br />
these issues will have in their mind what, in a worst case<br />
scenario, could be necessary to protect those interests.<br />
JOURNALIST: Senator Richardson earlier in the debate on the<br />
Antarctic area you said that you thought mining there was<br />
inevitable. Do you<br />
RICHARDSON: Well I have always believed that the chances of<br />
mining in the Antarctic depend largely upon what's found and<br />
what breakthroughs there are in technology. Having said<br />
that that doesn't prevent any nation, in particular ours,<br />
from doing its best to prevent it. Because while you said<br />
I've always said it is inevitable, I've always said that I<br />
was against it and would do anything I could to prevent it,<br />
and what we are doing today, hopefully, is going down that<br />
path. JOURNALIST: Were you worried about the recent having no<br />
protection, no regime set for mining that go ahead as a<br />
0 result of<br />
RICHARDSON: What we are trying to do is to get in place a<br />
better protection for the Antarctic environment than<br />
exists now, or would exist if the Convention was signed.<br />
That being the case I'm hardly in a position to object.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke do you support Senator Richardson's<br />
suggestion that there could be a referendum on the question<br />
of the Commonwealth overriding the States powers concerning<br />
certain environmental controls?<br />
PM: I haven't yet had the opportunity of discussing this<br />
matter with the Senator because I understand from what he<br />
said it wasn't something he was talking about tomorrow or<br />
the next day but as something like 10 years down the track.<br />
I just make this point that obviously we have worked as hard<br />
as any government possibly could within the existing<br />
constitutional division of power, to protect the<br />
environment. It is a matter of record that that's been very<br />
difficult in getting the support of Tasmania, matters </p>
<p>PM ( cont): concerning them and in Queensland concerning that<br />
Government and so it would be the case that if you didn't<br />
have that sort of constitutional division power, if there<br />
was a clear head of power our task in the past would have<br />
been easier than it has been. But I believe that we have<br />
demonstrated the capacity and the commitment and the<br />
tenacity, if you like, of working under the existing<br />
arrangements we'll continue to do that. Let me say that I<br />
would hope that with, what I believe, is an increasing<br />
awareness within this country of the importance of<br />
environmental issues, that States have hitherto wanted us to<br />
bow at the shrine of States rights. Something which I have<br />
always regarded as rather difficult to comprehend that a<br />
citizen has some interest and rights because he lives within<br />
a State border which is different from his rights and<br />
concerns as a citizen of this country and of the world. I<br />
have never been quite able to understand that. Now I think<br />
that those who want to worship at the altar of State rights<br />
are going to find a diminishing congregation witnessing<br />
their worship.<br />
JOURNALIST: Is it a referendum that you could win not in<br />
ten years but in a much shorter time frame<br />
PM: Let me say this. I've said just in some brief<br />
conversations I've had with different people this morning in<br />
my office when there was a reference to Graham's idea of<br />
perhaps something down the track, that I would have thought<br />
that this is an issue in which the way things are going you<br />
would have a much better environment for acceptance than you<br />
would on many other issues.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, are still confident<br />
PM: Although one would have thought that on some other<br />
issues that we put to them last year that a consideration of<br />
their own interests would have led to that conclusion too.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, are you still confident of<br />
achieving significant reform of the waterfront in time for a<br />
statement in Parliament next week?<br />
PM: Yes I wasn't and I suggest neither should you be<br />
carried away by headlines of a newspaper. I know that we<br />
saw the message of doom on the front page of the Australian<br />
Financial Review but as predictors of events they have got<br />
something less than an entirely impeccable record over the<br />
recent 12 months or two years. I wasn't led to believe from<br />
reading this morning that they were improving their record.<br />
JOURNALIST: Senator Evans could you tell us the main factor<br />
in your change of heart on the<br />
EVANS: No The matters that really have been detailed<br />
by the Prime Minister and my concern all along, has been to<br />
get an effective environmental protection regime. I<br />
certainly was pursuaded as we say in the joint statement<br />
that the present Minerals Convention is better than no </p>
<p>EVANS ( cant): protective regime at all. But if there is a<br />
chance of doing much better than the existing Convention I'm<br />
very happy and keen to support it. There is evidence not<br />
minister of an international environment growing in which<br />
there might be more fertile ground to pursue and more far<br />
reaching approach than that which I'd previously thought was<br />
possible. JOURNALIST: So was the French thing the main factor in your<br />
change in the position?<br />
EVANS: That's a relevant factor. Another factor was that<br />
identified by the Prime Minister when he said that to make<br />
clear our position if we were to sign the Minerals<br />
Convention we really would have to accompany it by a<br />
statement which made clear that we would exercise the veto<br />
right which is effectively given to parties to the<br />
S Convention in a way that we'd stop mining. But if we were<br />
to make a reservation in those terms it would as a matter of<br />
international law be so much at odds with the underlying<br />
concept of the Convention that we wouldn't get away with it.<br />
So we were caught in that bind, a bind which frankly I have<br />
to acknowledge the logical difficulty with. And combined<br />
with the other factor I mentioned I think that did create a<br />
situation where it's worth going down this track.<br />
JOURNALIST: If you were really not interested in Party<br />
politics on the issue of immigration, wouldn't you have<br />
moved exactly the same motion on immigration in the<br />
Parliament this week that you moved last year<br />
PM: There is a very simple answer to that question. It's a<br />
matter of Standing Orders that you are precluded from moving<br />
a motion in exactly the same terms as one that's previously<br />
been passed. So there is nothing sinister, mischievous,<br />
or JOURNALIST: The only reason is<br />
PM: It's not a question of getting around. It's not a<br />
question of getting around. The simple fact is this. That<br />
as far as Australia's interests are concerned in the region,<br />
the region very much wants and understandably wants a<br />
resumption and a stated resumption of the bipartisanship<br />
on this issue which has characterised Australia's approach<br />
for the last twenty years. And Australia's interests are<br />
served by achieving that position. There is nothing<br />
involved, there is no attempt here to take advantage of the<br />
Opposition or the change of leadership. Indeed in the blood<br />
and gore and chaos that's characterised the change of<br />
leadership there is one thing in all that which has stood<br />
out like a beacon and hopelessly you might say for this<br />
country and that is a clear and unequivocal statement of<br />
Mr Peacock which I've welcomed and which is consistent<br />
with what I've said in the Parliament and that is that<br />
no-one would be happier than the Prime minister, no-one<br />
would be happier than the Prime Minister, if we could get a </p>
<p>PM ( cont): return to that bipartisan position. I've said<br />
that at the time, I meant it at the time, that's what I<br />
wanted to see as soon as the opportunity for achieving that<br />
has arisen then you're going to get it. It's not for the<br />
interests of the Government, it is very much for the<br />
interests of this country and of the region.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke isn't there a danger though that by<br />
re-opening this debate that you..<br />
PM: I would think not. I would think that so many people<br />
in the community who will welcome what Mr Peacock has said<br />
and people within the Liberal Party and the community<br />
generally, they want to see a return and a known return to a<br />
bipartisan position and certainly I can assure you from my<br />
visits in the region and I know that the Foreign minister<br />
can tell you the same thing that the region profoundly<br />
wants to have a position where it is known that as far as<br />
this country is concerned we will have a return to<br />
bipartisanship on this issue.<br />
EVANS: Can I just say on that that straight after Peacock's<br />
statement I went around to the PM's Office and said that<br />
this is an ideal opportunity to start to run that particular<br />
motion again and I found that the idea had already taken<br />
hold there, entirely for reasosns in my case of Foreign<br />
Affairs and getting on the record bipartisan support for<br />
that resolution which is a tremendously important part of<br />
our regional credibility. I can assure you that the<br />
motivation within the Government is wholly as the PM has<br />
described it.<br />
JOURNALIST: while on the region Senator Evans, how will the<br />
Government be viewing the Democrats proposed motion in the<br />
Senate supporting the latest protests in China support<br />
of democracy<br />
EVANS: well I think our present position on the Chinese<br />
situation is best explained in the statement I put out today<br />
which makes the point that it's very much the Australian<br />
Government's strong hope that the situation in China can be<br />
resolved without violence and with respect for fundamental<br />
human rights. I think beyond that it would be premature for<br />
us to make any further comment. I'll deal with the<br />
Democrats motion when I see the terms in which it's<br />
expressed. JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke on a seperate issue, the Australian<br />
dollar has fallen by over 1.5 cents today.<br />
PM: Against the United States dollar.<br />
JOURNALIST: Yes and the<br />
PM: But very, very slight fall against the pounds sterling,<br />
the deutschmark and the yen. </p>
<p>11.<br />
JOURNALIST: Well financial markets are indicating that<br />
they're not happy with the outlook for the Australian<br />
economy. They're considerably concerned about the fact that<br />
Mr Keating yesterday said commodity prices had peaked<br />
providing a balance of payments over the next six to<br />
twelve months. Do you think that provides any scope for an<br />
easing of policy or tightening of policy?<br />
PM: I've nothing to say other than what Paul Keating and<br />
Bob Hawke have been saying for some time now that we will<br />
keep the instruments of policy this tight for as long as is<br />
necessary to deal with Australia's economic situation. Now<br />
Paul has said that, I have said it and there is no reason in<br />
the light of anything that's happened today or the last 48<br />
hours, or the last 72 hours to change that clear statement<br />
of our position.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke Nauru has taken Australia to the<br />
International Court of Justice over the issue of<br />
rehabilitation phosphate. But what's your response? Is<br />
Australia going to strongly defend this case?<br />
PM: Yes we've made that clear. I've made that clear to the<br />
Chief, Hammer Deroburt. I made it quite clear when he'd<br />
been here that that is our position. We have got nothing<br />
that we have to apologise for or to explain in terms of the<br />
action we've taken. If they regard it as in their interests<br />
to pursue this course of action we will vigorously defend<br />
Australia's interests.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke on the waterfront is this<br />
consensus the correct way way to approach these issues and<br />
with the Cabinet being seen to impose overall plans for the<br />
waterfront if their..<br />
PM: Well there are some greater degrees of difficulties<br />
which have emerged in respect of some matters that had not<br />
been anticipated in the first place. The Minister is<br />
engaged in discussions with the parties on that. I<br />
indicated my response to an earlier question, don't get<br />
carried away by your journal having got it wrong yet again<br />
there will be a statement and a meaningful one. If part<br />
of your question, ' is it better to go by-consensus or some<br />
other way', obviously it's best if you can negotiate by<br />
consensus. The worst thing to do is to go by way of<br />
confrontation which not only doesn't improve the situation<br />
it's likely to make it worse. I mean we've had let's look<br />
at this nonsense. This sudden embrace by the opposition<br />
about micro-economic reform in general and the waterfront<br />
and the maritime industry in particular. it is a load of<br />
nonsense. They had their time and their time in Office was<br />
characterised by total inaction in regard to these areas in<br />
particular and in regard to industrial relationships and<br />
management generally, you the confrontation which made<br />
things worse. You know what the overall position is in<br />
regard to their period and our period? And in our period in<br />
Office if you look at industrial disputes generally, 58% </p>
<p>12.<br />
PM ( cont): reduction in time lost under the processes that<br />
we've followed. Now if you want a certain recipe for<br />
exacerbating the situation on the waterfront and the martime<br />
industry and in the economy generally, let's pick up this<br />
concept of what we'll do is get out the great big stick and<br />
start belting employers and belting trade unions around the<br />
ears. It doesn't work. So what you've got to do is to try<br />
and make them understand that their own interest and<br />
certainly the interests of the nation will be served by<br />
change and change there will be.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke back on the Antarctic, the working<br />
party that you established recently to advise you on Can<br />
I ask you what they were<br />
PM: Well you can but there's not much point in the question<br />
because all we were wanting to do was to say, ' well now give<br />
us the issues that are involved, the sort of processes that<br />
we'd need to think about following'. Now that's an<br />
exploratory sort of piece of work and as a result of what<br />
we've done and today we'll take that further. We'll now<br />
have further work done on what needs to be done and part of<br />
that has been reflected in an answer I've already given in<br />
the we won't be talking about a world park as such. We'll<br />
be talking about an Antarctic wilderness park and that<br />
essentially reflects the sort of considerations I gave in<br />
answer to an earlier question that you've got to have a<br />
process which is capable of being given effect to. Now if<br />
you talked about a world park which may carry with it<br />
concepts of world heritage listing and so on and United<br />
Nations, involvement by definition it's a path that can't<br />
work. So what we will want our people to do now is to as<br />
quickly as possible to firm up now that we've made this<br />
decision as a Cabinet the sort of framework with which we'll<br />
be going to other countries.<br />
JOURNALIST: At this stage it would seem encompassing<br />
all mainland Antarctic surrounding oceans?<br />
PM: Yes that would be the concept, yes.<br />
