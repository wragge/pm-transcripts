    <content><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday I saw first-hand the damage caused by the bushfires in Tasmania and Victoria. I pay tribute to all the people involved in fighting the fires and those contributing to the relief efforts.</p>
<p>Given the particular hardship faced by those who lost their homes in Tasmania I have authorised additional Commonwealth support in the form of cash payments to people who have lost their principal place of residence or had it rendered uninhabitable. The cash payments will amount to $1000 for each eligible adult and $400 for each eligible child. Tasmanians who are entitled to this assistance will now be able to apply immediately to Centrelink on 1802233.</p>
<p>I am also pleased to announce that the Commonwealth will donate $50,000 to the Australian Red Cross Bushfires Appeal launched in Tasmania yesterday. The Red Cross does a tremendous job in circumstances such as these and I encourage Australians to support this appeal.</p>
<p>This will be over and above the support that will be given by the Commonwealth to the Tasmanian Government under the long standing Natural Disaster Relief Arrangements. Through these arrangements, the Commonwealth assists the states with the costs and resourcing of response and recovery in relation to large scale natural disasters.</p>
<p> I am having discussions with Premier Lennon about what additional assistance can be provided under the enhanced Natural Disaster Relief Arrangements that I announced yesterday. In the near future, I expect further announcements on how we will continue to work together to support the relief and recovery effort.</p>
<p>I'd like to make it clear that should other states now battling bushfires face similar loss of property, like Commonwealth assistance will be available. I have personally communicated this to the Premier of Victoria Steve Bracks in a telephone conversation with him earlier today.</p>
