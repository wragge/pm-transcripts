AUSTRALIA AND SOME WORLD ECONOMIC ISSUES<br />
A SPEECH BY THE PRIME MIIl! STER OF AUSTRALIA,<br />
THE RT. HON. MALCOLM FRASER, M. P.<br />
TO<br />
THE ECONOMIC CLUB OF NEW YORK 0N 4 JANUARY, 197<br />
It is a great pleasure to be In the U. S. again and have the<br />
opportunity to address this very important group of American<br />
business leaders, 7 am also pleased to have the opportunity<br />
to try to collect my bet with Arthur Bu. ns, a bet about which<br />
I think, some of you may know.<br />
When we met In Washington In June, 1977, he made one of his<br />
few errors of judgement and bet me that Australia would not<br />
get its inflation rate aown below this country's by the June<br />
quarter of 1978. Well, we did., Doing so has not been easy<br />
It never is.<br />
I am sure that the anti-Inflationary measures announced in this<br />
country two months ago by President Carter were not easily<br />
arrived at either.<br />
To announce measures of that kind shortly In advance of the<br />
congressional election must have required considerable political<br />
courage. And If I may say so, we In Australia have greatly<br />
welcomed the policy decisions Involved,.<br />
The contribution they are making towards stabilizing the value<br />
of the U. S. dollar has as much; or more significance, for the<br />
rest of the world as it does for the United States. / The </p>
<p>2<br />
The absolute magnitude of U. S, tradeeans that even small changes<br />
in the value of the dollar have large effects on the trade of<br />
smaller countries.<br />
In reflecting upon our own fight against inflation, I must say it<br />
has taken us three years of hard slog to make the progress we<br />
have made.<br />
Throughout that period our poli: ies have been designed to reestablish<br />
the pre-conditions for sustainable economic growth.<br />
We have approached the task of economic restoration in a mediumterm<br />
framework.<br />
After the economic turmoil through which the Australian economy<br />
passed a few years ago, it takes time to eliminate economic<br />
distortions and imbalances, to provide a settled framework of<br />
expectations within which business en and consumers can take<br />
decisions with confidence.<br />
America has recently been swept by initi&amp; tives such as<br />
Proposition 13 designed to restrain the growth of public sector<br />
spending.<br />
I am told that the eIections ; sst rlo,: ember showed that this is a.<br />
political winner a&amp; C-cs the U. S3<br />
Well, the basic phillsophy reflected in Proposition 13 has been<br />
alive and well In Austfalia for-the past three years.<br />
We have rejected the nction that an economy can be kept moving<br />
by continually bioating the public ector.<br />
We have cut the growtn in Federal Government expenditures from<br />
the astronomirl figure of 46 per cent in 1974-75, to less than<br />
8 per cent. We still think that's a bit too high.<br />
We have used some of the resultant savings to reduce taxes,<br />
to put spending and decision-makinrg power back into the hands<br />
of businesses and private individuals where it more properly<br />
belongs. / We </p>
<p>3<br />
We have legislated to keep Gaves-nment honest by providing for<br />
indexation of personal income tax,<br />
To encourage continuing economic groath we have provided tax<br />
incentives for private investment.<br />
We have not been abie to pass on all the expenditure savings to<br />
the private sector because vie inherited an enormous budget<br />
deficit over 5 per cent of n. D. P. We have set about reducing<br />
it, and this financial year the deficit should be about 2.8 per<br />
cent of GDoPo<br />
We have cut back the rate of growth in our money supply. The<br />
rate of growth of oUr M3 which incidentally corresponds more<br />
nearly to your M2-has been reduced from around 20 per cent per<br />
annum in the second half of 1975 to 8 per cent in 1977-78.<br />
Let me now tell you briefly about how these policies have been<br />
bearing fruit.<br />
Our major success hs been in pushinq our annual inflation rate<br />
down from about 17 per Cent in 1975 to about seven and a half<br />
per cent. This is lower than the average for the O. E. C. D. area<br />
as a whole and it is trending downwards,<br />
In the light of the recent wage decision the Treasury has revised<br />
its budget forecasti and anticipates that inflation will be under<br />
6 per cent by the midle or this year,<br />
Lower inflation is encouraging consumers to spend a higher<br />
proportion of their disposable incomes. And this is reflected<br />
in the fall of the personal savings tatio from its peak of a few<br />
years ago,<br />
Business investment, by both domestic and overseas enterprises.,<br />
has been rising strongly, partly because of the greater business<br />
certainty flowing from lower inflation, and also because of some<br />
although not yet enough recovery in corporate profitability.<br />
At the same time as we have been pursuing our anti-inflationary<br />
strategy, we have had a growth record which stands up well<br />
enough by international comparison, I do not want to give the<br />
impression that we think all our economic problems have been<br />
overcome. We still have some way to go, and this is most<br />
obvious in the area of unemployment-/ There </p>

We in Australia are determined to meet the challenges posed by<br />
our enormous resource potential and the dynamism of our region.<br />
To do so effectively, we shall need the help of overseas capital.<br />
I cannot emphasise too strongly that Australia welcomes overseas<br />
investment to supplement its already high level of capital<br />
formation from domestic sources.<br />
Development of our resource potential is going to require<br />
considerable capitai funds from overseas. The total investment<br />
finance required for that purpose over the next three years<br />
could be nearly $ US 7 Billion and a major proportion of this<br />
estimated requirement will need to be sought offshore. Figures<br />
such as these are necessarily speculative but they will give you<br />
an idea of the opportunities which are opening up in Australia<br />
as we bring our own economy into better shape. Those opportunities<br />
are, we believe, enhanced by the great markets opening up in the<br />
countries immediately to our north.<br />
We are a " natural" importer of long-term capital and are likely<br />
to remain so as far ahead as one can reasonably foresee.<br />
We are determined to create, through our general economic pblicies,<br />
conditions which are favourable to the emoloyment of capital in<br />
Australia, whether derived from the savinas of our own people or<br />
from overseas investment.<br />
We have laid down clear guidelines for foreign investment-and<br />
they are being administered flexibly and fairly. I believe this<br />
general approach is now widely recognised and supported by foreign<br />
investors. it is increzsingly apparent that the chief deterrent<br />
to investment is not sc much rules or guidelines in themselves,<br />
but any suggestion that those rules may be subject to violent and<br />
arbitrary change. Ours will not be.<br />
Austral. ja has unlimited prospects and offers excellent opportunities<br />
for investors. For its part, the Government is determined to<br />
pursue the steady, sound economic policies which will make the<br />
1980' s a decade of achievement. </p>

Anti-inflation policies are the best way to shift the balance<br />
