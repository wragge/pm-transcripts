-A<br />
PRIME MINIStER
FOR MEDIA -26 APRIL 1991<br />
The Government, the Unions and Employers are each party to<br />
the Waterfront Industry Reform Package.<br />
The Reform Package involves agreement by the parties to:<br />
Finalise enterprise based agreements.<br />
Implement a new skills based award classification<br />
structur7e at an enterprise level.<br />
Where appropriate develop productivity based wage<br />
schemes at the enterprise level.<br />
The Government has supported these developments on the<br />
understanding that substantial increases in productivity are<br />
achieved in which the community is a significant<br />
beneficiary. The Government is not prepared to see Unions, Employers or<br />
the IRC stand in the way in implementing these objectives.<br />
The issues involved in this matter, while of course being of<br />
great importa~ nce to the parties immediately involved, have a<br />
profound significance for the whole Australian community.<br />
Out of discussions that have been held with the parties and<br />
taking into account their various legitimate concerns the<br />
Government is: therefore indicating that this issue should be<br />
resolved by the unions and employers acting in the following<br />
manner: To implement a two year contract from 16 May 1991. The<br />
agreement to be closed except for any national<br />
adjustments supported in Accord Mark VII and employer<br />
initiated productivity based enterprise arrangements.<br />
The first adjustment shall be $ 12.00 per week from the<br />
first pay period on or after 16 May.<br />
The $ 12.00 is to be paid only after agreement on the<br />
classification structure which must be finalised prior<br />
to 16 May.<br />
The second adjustment shall be the reclassification<br />
increase of 4.0% from 1 July. </p>
<p>The 4% increase would become available on an enterprise<br />
by enterprise basis from 1 July 1991, but only when:<br />
an enterprise agreement has been finalised and<br />
approved by WIRA; and<br />
employees have been reclassified under the new<br />
structure.<br />
Employees accepting the WIRA package are not eligible<br />
for reclassification as they will have left the<br />
industry once the enterprise agreement has been<br />
implemented. The 4% increase represents an aggregate wage cost<br />
outcome. There will be different percentage increases<br />
for different classifications in accordance with the<br />
new classification structure.<br />
There shall be a further adjustment arising from a<br />
valuation of the new classifications. This shall be<br />
phased in two parts the first not to be payable<br />
before 1 January 1992, the second not before 1 July<br />
1992. If the parties cannot reach agreement on this valuation<br />
of the classifications within the new structure they<br />
agree to accept the outcome of an independent<br />
assessment referred to in para<br />
If the IRC is not available to make such assessments<br />
the WIRA shall employ a person or persons agreed<br />
between the parties for this purpose or in the absence<br />
of such agreement nominated by the Minister.<br />
WIRA will be asked to report on the further training<br />
requirements necessary to implement these arrangements.<br />
The Government will ensure the maintenance of the award<br />
system within this industry.<br />
This process of resolution must be implemented immediately.<br />
I and Minister Collins will be available during next week to<br />
assist in this matter if required.<br />
