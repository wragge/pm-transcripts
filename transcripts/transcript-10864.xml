    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Commonwealth and Queensland Governments today reached agreement</p>
<p> in principle on the five year Australian Health Care Agreement to</p>
<p> commence on 1 July 1998.</p>
<p>This agreement is worth almost $5.5 billion to Queensland over</p>
<p> five years, including a first year value to Queensland in excess of</p>
<p> $1 billion, compared to the $4.3 billion over five years</p>
<p> provided under the current Labor Medicare Agreement.</p>
<p>Specific new funding elements of the five year Agreement for Queensland</p>
<p> include $24.5 million waiting lists funding programme in 1998-99</p>
<p> and $45 million from the National Development Fund for infrastructure</p>
<p> reform and development.</p>
<p>The people of Queensland will benefit immediately from extra money</p>
<p> available under the Commonwealth's Critical and Urgent Treatment</p>
<p> (CUT) Waiting Lists Incentive programme, and from the additional flexibility</p>
<p> that the Agreement provides to improve the quality of care and encourage</p>
<p> greater innovation in delivering health care services.</p>
<p>The Queensland Government will be able to use the immediate availability</p>
<p> of $15 million in this current financial year to further build</p>
<p> upon the achievements of the Surgery On Time strategy.</p>
<p>This determined approach has already lifted the proportion of urgent</p>
<p> (category one) patients that receive treatment within 30 days from</p>
<p> just 51% in 1995 to 99%, and is now aiming to provide treatment to</p>
<p> the 95% of all semi-urgent (category two) patients within the clinically</p>
<p> accepted 90-day period by 30 June 1998.</p>
<p>This would surpass the achievements of every other public hospital</p>
<p> system in Australia, and equal world-best practice in elective surgery</p>
<p> clearance times.</p>
<p>Queensland has a proud tradition of free public hospital treatment,</p>
<p> having been the first State to establish comprehensive free services</p>
<p> to the community in 1947.</p>
<p>The Australian Health Care Agreement will allow Queensland to build</p>
<p> on the strengths of its health care system and to enhance the availability</p>
<p> of important programmes in mental health, palliative care, veterans'</p>
<p> care and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health.</p>
<p>In recognition of the special and particular demands on the Queensland</p>
<p> health system arising from the Torres Strait Treaty and the proximity</p>
<p> of the border with Papua New Guinea, the Commonwealth will provide</p>
<p> $11 million over five years for further action in this area.</p>
<p>Additionally, in recognition of Queensland's early preparedness</p>
<p> to enter into an agreement, the Commonwealth is prepared to guarantee</p>
<p> immediate payments under the Critical and Urgent Treatment (CUT) Waiting</p>
<p> Lists Incentive program of $15 million in 1997-98.</p>
<p>The Commonwealth's offer has been adapted from the $933.5 million</p>
<p> base offer made at the Premier's Conference on 20 March 1998</p>
<p> to provide increased certainty in funding and to recognise Queensland's</p>
<p> health care priorities.</p>
<p>Queensland has been assured that it will not be disadvantaged by early</p>
<p> entry into the Agreement and will be treated on the same basis as</p>
<p> other States and Territories.</p>
<p>This undertaking guarantees that Queensland will receive its proportional</p>
<p> share should the Commonwealth subsequently decide to increase the</p>
<p> global funding that is offered under the Australian Health Care Agreements</p>
<p> to States and Territories.</p>
<p>A similar undertaking was provided to the ACT Chief Minister, Mrs Kate Carnell,</p>
<p> MLA, when her government signed an in principle agreement earlier</p>
<p> this year, and was honoured when the Commonwealth subsequently increased</p>
<p> its global offer at the meeting of Health Ministers on 10 March.</p>
<p>Queensland and other States which signed early during the negotiations</p>
<p> over the 1993 agreements were severely disadvantaged when the Keating</p>
<p> Government, in order to bribe the largest States into signing at the</p>
<p> eleventh hour on 30 June, gave NSW and Victoria an extra $150 million</p>
<p> a year and promptly reduced the Financial Assistance Grants to the</p>
<p> smaller States by the same amount.</p>
<p>The Commonwealth will also be moving to pay the full cost for treatment</p>
<p> provided to veteran Gold Card holders in Queensland public hospitals.</p>
<p>Dr Wooldridge and Mr Horan will hold further discussions to resolve</p>
<p> detailed issues and settle the wording of the Australian Health Care</p>
<p> Agreement to be signed by our governments.</p>
