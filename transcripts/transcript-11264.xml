    <content><![CDATA[<p align="left">I warmly congratulate Mr Abdurrahman Wahid on his election as president of Indonesia.</p>
<p>This is the first democratic election of Indonesiaâs president in thirty years and therefore a very important and welcome step.</p>
<p>For many years Mr Wahid has championed the values of tolerance and decency in public life. As a leading religious and public figure he has been a strong supporter of political reform in Indonesia.</p>
<p>Australia and Indonesia are neighbours. We share important common interests. Australia has always extended the hand of friendship towards Indonesia.</p>
<p>The Government will aim to build a good working relationship with the new President and his government.</p>
<p>I can assure Mr Wahid of the goodwill of the Australian government, our readiness to open a new chapter in our relationship on the basis of mutual respect, and our support as he faces the huge challenge of leading Indonesia through political transition and achieving economic recovery.</p>
<p>20 October 1999</p>
