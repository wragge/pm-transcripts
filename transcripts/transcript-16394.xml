    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Rudd Government today announced additional assistance to residents in Far North and Northern Queensland seriously affected by the floods.</p>
<p>Those eligible will be able to receive a one-off lump sum payment of $1000 for adults and $400 for each child to help support their recovery. </p>
<p>This will be available through Centrelink.</p>
<p>The Australian Government Disaster Recovery Payment will be made available to those people adversely affected by the flooding that commenced in the Far North/Northern Queensland regions on 31 January 2009.</p>
<p>The Rudd Government will continue to work with the Queensland Government and community organisations to support those people and families affected through this difficult time. When the flood waters recede, a fuller assessment of the impact will be possible.</p>
<p>The Australian Government Disaster Recovery Payment will provide financial assistance to people who have been seriously injured, or whose principal place of residence has been destroyed, significantly damaged or is inaccessible for 48 hours or more as a direct result of the floods.</p>
<p>Over the coming days and weeks there will be further work to do for these communities to fully recover.</p>
<p>Information on the Australian Government Disaster Recovery Payment will be available through the Australian Government North Queensland Floods Hotline on 180 22 22.</p>
<p>This assistance is over and above the support being provided by the Commonwealth Government under the long standing Natural Disaster Relief and Recovery Arrangements.</p>
<p>Through these arrangements, partial reimbursement is provided to the Queensland Government to provide assistance such as grants for food, clothing, accommodation, emergency housing repairs and for expenditure on public infrastructure restoration.</p>
<p>More information on Australian Government assistance will be available at <a href="http://www.disasterassist.gov.au">www.disasterassist.gov.au</a></p>
