    <content><![CDATA[<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, what can you tell us about the death of a Special Forces soldier?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Let me express my great sorrow at this tragic accident.  I extend my condolences to the man's wife and children and other family members and friends and record the valiant efforts made by a number of his colleagues to give first aid in order to try and save him. As to the details of it, the Chief of the Defence Force has already spoken about that and I don't wish to add anything, except to say that the death of any Australian soldier is a cause of great sadness to me, to the Government and I know to all of the people of Australia.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Obviously the injuries were very, very serious.  What sort of first aid, what was the situation?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I think that is something you should pursue with the military.  It is appropriate that all the details of this be provided by Defence.  It's appropriate that I speak for all of my fellow Australians in saying to his family how very, very sad we are at the death of this wonderful member of the SAS.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>He has been described as one of the ADF's finest and a long-serving Special Forces soldier.  Is the death felt all the more keenly because of that long service, that longevity?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>The death of any man or woman in uniform of Australia is felt very keenly.  This man had a wonderful career with the SAS and he was an outstanding serviceman.  The loss of anybody in these circumstances is very tragic and I am very saddened by what's happened.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
