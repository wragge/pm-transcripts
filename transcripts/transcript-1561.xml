OPENING OF A. SSCCIATED CHAMBERS OF COMMERCE<br />
BUILDING, BARTON, CANBERR. A<br />
Speech by the Frime Minister, Mr. Harold Holt APRIL, 19 67<br />
Mr. President May, Mr. President of the Senate, Your Exfcellencies,<br />
D-stinguished Guests, Ladi. es and Gentlemen<br />
Thank you, Mr. May, for the kind things you have said about<br />
the basis of co-operation which has at all times exlisted between the<br />
Commonwealth Government and this Chamber or Associated Chambers of<br />
-Commerce of Australia. 1 would just like to make it clear that close though that<br />
associaton, and warm though that co-operation has been, no ulterior<br />
significance is to be drawn from the fact that you have established your<br />
building in close prox'. mity to the headquarters of the Liberal Party.<br />
You mentioned that there have been occasions I am glad to<br />
hear you say they were rate occasions when you found It necessary to<br />
disagree publicly with us, but of course there have been occasions when you<br />
found 4. t necessary to disagree publicly with I won't say'thet rival party"<br />
but that other very important Chamber the Assoz: iated % Chamberso f<br />
Manufactures. And yet these days such is the :: e--rvas've and diversified<br />
influence to be found in the Australian economy, many members, I know,<br />
of this Chamber are also members of the other Chamber, ald similarly : n<br />
a sense, while from time to time you look upon us if not as tiatural enemies<br />
at least as a pi-evailing force to be contended with, so no dodbt you entertain<br />
the same views to the other organisation.<br />
But happily for Australia and ' t is a feature of the<br />
Australian democracy there is through all levels of the social and economic<br />
structure a degree of friendly co-operation which I think it would be difficult<br />
to match in any other country of the world. Undoubtedly our national strength,<br />
our national progress and our prosperity owe a great deal to that co-operation<br />
which we have been able to establish at all these levels. W~ e, like you, have<br />
found value in the talks we hold from time to time and for my part, I can<br />
assure you that these will be a continuing feature of our Administration.<br />
Certainly the talks have important influence upon the final economic judgments<br />
that we come to. I congratulate you on the establishment here in Canberra of<br />
this fine building. It is, of itself of course, a tangible sign of the progress of<br />
Canberra, the recognition of Canberra as a firmly established national<br />
capital, and a sign also of your own confidence -n the strength of your<br />
Associated Chambers and of the part you will play in the future of the nation.<br />
The Chamber serves the nation well in a variety of ways. I<br />
pay public tribute to it, and as wie see our own burgeoning economy and our<br />
own advancing nation progress, so we will anticipate the need in the future<br />
to perhaps an even greater eXtent than in the past of a body equipped as yours<br />
is, to service its members with information, to make public and private<br />
representations for them in official quarters from time to time, and to give<br />
articulate expression to the particular purposes for which the Chamber stands. </p>
<p>Wte can see in the years perhaps not so distantly ahead<br />
new problems) new opportunities arisiing for Australia. Traditionally<br />
over the past years, much of our trade has been with the United Kingdom.<br />
Through no desire of ours, but through the progress of economic events,<br />
that has been at least in percentage a declining factor in our trade and<br />
perhaps if Great Britain enters the European Common Market, there will<br />
be less emphasis in the future upon the trade here than i'n the past. I<br />
hope not, because it is our wish to maintain a continuing expansion of our<br />
trade with the United Kingdom and, indeed, with the other countries of<br />
Europe generally. Vlhatever may be the result in that direction at least we<br />
can feel reasonably confident that if we turn our eyes northwards, there<br />
will be growing opportunities for Australia in the countries of Asia, and<br />
there will be new problems for men of commerce to face in their dealings<br />
with the economies and gove:: nments of these countries. W~ e have only to<br />
consider the amazing development that has occurred in Australia's two-way<br />
trade with Japan over recent years to see an illustration of this. From a<br />
position shortly after the war when there was virtually no trade between us,<br />
Japan has now become, as you know, the largest purchaser in value of<br />
Australian exports. We are currently the third largest purchaser in value<br />
of Japanese goods. What is occurring and has already occurred in Japan<br />
may not be repeated on the same scale in the other countries of Asia, but<br />
certainly from my own recent journeys to that area over the last twelve<br />
months, I am convinced that we do face growing opportunities there.<br />
On this most recent visit, for example, both in Taiwan, a<br />
country of thirteen million people, and Korea, a country of just on thirty<br />
million people, where they both possess annual growth rates ranking<br />
amongst the highest in the world, there are, I am sure, potentialities for<br />
development of Australian trade which have yet scarcely been scratched.<br />
In Korea I saw the largest fertil ser factory, as they claimed it, in Asia,<br />
and a petrol refining establishment. They told me they have already a<br />
consortium established for the creation of an iron and steel industry and<br />
would be looking for Australian i~ ron ore in order to service the steel<br />
industry of that country. They were looking to us, they said, for plywood,<br />
since sources of plywood previously available to them were drying up.<br />
And these are only illustrations.<br />
In Taiwan, there was a similar indication to us of a very<br />
substantial growth of their purchases of Australian raw materials and goods<br />
over the years ahead. Now these are growing economies, but the problems<br />
there may not necessarily be the same as those with which you have to<br />
contend in Europe. There are the undeveloped countries of the world which,<br />
while their progress at the moment may seem slow, yet as more<br />
enlightened policies apply and more generous aid can be provided from the<br />
growing economies of more favoured countries, again there should be an<br />
expansion of demand which commerce will be able to put to its own<br />
advantage. And so I think we can take a bright prospect of the future<br />
and, if only peace can be restored in this area of the world, that process<br />
w~ ll be greatly accelerated. / 3 </p>
<p>There are other developments which will occur to you.<br />
Australia, as one of the great trading nations of the world, relies very<br />
heavily upon transport by sea and to a growing extent by air, for the<br />
carriage of goods. We have been watching and do'ng what we have been<br />
able to encourage the new developments in the f. eld of containerization of<br />
goods and the modernization of ports and greater efficiency in the handling<br />
of goods at the waterfront, and in these and other ways trying to assist you<br />
in the task of marketing your products abroad, or else importing the goods<br />
for sale here in Australia. So from these few illustrations we can see not only-good<br />
prospects ahead, but a continuing need for the kind of co-operation which<br />
we have already established. And I say in appreciation of what you<br />
have already been able to do w4th us that we look for that continued goodwill<br />
and teamwork in the years ahead, and in that spirit and with best wishes<br />
the continuing growth and success of the Associated Chambers of Commerce<br />
/ A. ustralia, I now officially declare this building open and shall have pleasure<br />
in unveiling a plaque. Well, gentlemnen, with best wishes from my Government<br />
to you all and may this bu'lding long continue to serve efficiently the<br />
purposes for which you have combined together. </p>
