AJUSTRL IA L<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 227A TURDA,<br />
ADDRESS TO SOUTH AUSTRALIAN STATE COUNCIL<br />
DELIVERED BY HON. A. A. STREET.<br />
MINISTER FOR INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS*<br />
I welcome this opportunity to visit South Australia yet again<br />
in the wake of the stunning victory by the Tornkin Government<br />
on September 15. I am even more delighte~ d because I have the<br />
opportunity today to speak to those peCople who were the<br />
architects of this success.<br />
The victory of David Tonkin and his team was not only a<br />
confirmation of the need to put economic growth first in<br />
South Australia, but also it was an emphatic assertion-by<br />
the electorate here that under Labor significant progress<br />
had been denied to South Australians,<br />
The memories of the Playford era are still present amongst<br />
those of us who desire progress from Covernemnt. Under Playford<br />
rule, South Australia experienced a degree of industrialisation<br />
that it had not known and has not since experienced.<br />
In the manufacturing sector it had unparal~ leled success in<br />
keeping costs low making manufactured goods attractive to<br />
Eastern Australian markets. The tight control over Government<br />
expenditure under Playford, placed the onus on. private<br />
enterprise and personal achievement.<br />
Under his Government, population grew and South Australia<br />
experienced a rise in the standard of living comparable with<br />
its growth.<br />
The Tonkin victory means the end of the Dunstan era, but riot<br />
the end of the problems created by the Dunstan era. It is the<br />
beginning of the challenge of re-building the economy of<br />
South Australia.<br />
The Dunstan-Corcoran legacy is the legacy of all Labor<br />
socialist governments. We are all too familiar with the fact<br />
that unemployment in August under the Corcoran Government was<br />
running at 8.2% of the ful~ l time work force, compared to<br />
the Australian figure of 5.8%. / 2 </p>
<p>2<br />
The Dunstan era saw employment in the Government sector<br />
increase by 26,500 while employment in the private sector<br />
remained almost at a standstill with an increase in the<br />
same period of only 1,800. Firms, strangled by Government<br />
regulation and control began to move to other States.<br />
The defeat of the Labor Government came it a time when<br />
South Australia with 9% of the national population could lay<br />
claim to less than its fair share of investment in mining<br />
and manufacturing in Australia which is either committed<br />
or in the final feasibility stage.<br />
South Australia under Dunstan and Australia under Whitlam. are<br />
classic instances of what can happen to an economically<br />
advantaged country when high spending proponents of big<br />
Government are voted into power.<br />
Yet today, by his own admission, Mr. Hayden would do it all<br />
again. He argued in March this year that: " There was nothing<br />
revolutionary or even particularly radical about the<br />
Whitlam programmes."<br />
We must all be warned. The labels on the prescription may<br />
be different but the Labor medicine is still the same.<br />
The recent A. L. P. Conference here in Adelaide offered us<br />
a socialist blueprint for the 80' s, no different in substance<br />
of style from that of the Whitlam days. It must be analysed<br />
and rejected: debated and defeated. It advocated<br />
Government intervention in typical socialist style through<br />
nationaisation and extending public ownership.<br />
It advocated a return to big spending by: " The abolition of<br />
staff ceilings" in the Public Service; the re-incarnation of<br />
the R. E. D. Scheme as a Community Youth Corps, which could cost<br />
$ 600 million, raises phoney short-term employment expectations<br />
but makes little contribution to long term job creation;<br />
employer subsidies which on some calculations could cost<br />
$ 1,000 million or more a year, would largely subsidise staff<br />
who would have been employed in any case. Yet again, such<br />
a Scheme merely acknowledges that there is no short term<br />
solution which will rectify imbalances in the economy. The<br />
promise to re-introduce Medibank I would return us to the<br />
extravagant days when health services were abused at a<br />
cost unacceptable to the taxpayer. In the last financial<br />
year in which Mr. Hayden was Treasurer the Commonwealth<br />
Government's contribution to health costs in Australia rose<br />
by 113.6%. Such an advocacy of big spending has won predictable<br />
support from leading union spokesmen.<br />
At a tire when we are at last seeing the benefits of reducing<br />
the deficit to manageable dimensions namely a new confidence<br />
in Australia, here and abroad the Budget submission by peak<br />
union councils, including the ACTU, advocated a Budget deficit<br />
of $ 3.5 to $ 4 billion. </p>
<p>-3<br />
Mr. Hayden's own shadow Budget could lead to a deficit<br />
of $ 4 billion or more. There just seems to be no<br />
understanding by Labor spokesmen of the inevitable effect<br />
this would have on inflation; on wages and jobs; on<br />
interest rates; on the Australian currency; on confidence<br />
in Australia and on willingness to invest in Australia' s<br />
future. To add to this, the Labor Conference not only accepted<br />
the principle of full wage indexation but affirmed the<br />
right of Australian workers on top of this, to " collectively<br />
bargain and strike". It is impossible for the<br />
Leader of the Opposition to deny his commitment to these<br />
Conference demands. In all the Conference, nowhere was<br />
there any debate about the role played by increased<br />
Government expenditure in promoting inflation.<br />
Labor increasingly boasts a commitment to high expenditure<br />
and more taxes but more taxes minimise individual freedom<br />
and increase the Government's direction over people's lives.<br />
Mr. Hayden stated clearly in the F. E. Chamberlain Lecture<br />
in March this year that:" The challenge to socialism is<br />
the rapid spread of philosophies based on lower taxes and<br />
smaller government...". It is no wonder that the opposition<br />
Leader was subsequently able to protest " that considerable<br />
suspicion of the Labor Party and of Labor Party Governments<br />
remains in the electorate."<br />
For there is no fundamental difference between Mr. Hayden's<br />
economic madness and that practiced by the Whitlan Government.<br />
It is valid to remember that during three years of Federal<br />
Labor rule taxes from personal income increased 125%.<br />
The Adelaide Conference told us, we are to have " taxing<br />
of accumulations of personal capital". We are told<br />
that " this is to be reviewed regularly".<br />
People need constant reminding that the Labor Party is the<br />
Party of high taxation and new taxation. But this time we..<br />
can at least say we have been warned.<br />
In February this year, the Opposition's spokesman on<br />
economic matters, Mr. Ralph Willis, when asked " What is<br />
your attitude towards taxation?" replied: " We haven't<br />
just talked about increasing Government expenditure, we've<br />
talked about alternative policies of raising revenue as<br />
well we'ye talked about the need for new taxes..<br />
resource rent taxes or super profits taxes and some form<br />
of tax on capital". In fact in June 1978 Mr. Willis<br />
committed himself to the " mammoth task in re-building the<br />
public sector in convincing the electorate that it should<br />
pay a higher level of tax to enable us to do so".<br />
Such measures assert the view that the Government knows best<br />
what we should do with our money. This economic thinking must<br />
be firmly resisted. / 4 </p>
<p>-4-<br />
When taxation measures, specifically p-rmsed by the<br />
Labor Party, seek to redistribute resources from individuals<br />
to Government, the capacity of individualsito make<br />
decisions is severely restricted. Because of this we have<br />
effected reforms in the taxation scales.<br />
In this financial year we will collect $ 4,000 million less<br />
in income tax than if the Hayden tax scales had applied.<br />
Put another way, a taxpayer with a wife and two children on<br />
average weekly earnings will be over $ 1,000 a year better off<br />
after the 1st of December this year than he would have been<br />
under the Hayden tax scales. Such a move towards lowering<br />
the taxation burden enshrines our Liberal pr ' inciple that<br />
Australians must be given the capacity to determine their<br />
own priorities in life.<br />
The Labor Party seeks to move in the opposite direction.<br />
To add to this the Labor Party is bent on increasing union<br />
power and will legislate to that effect.<br />
Its platform from the Adelaide Conference specifically commits<br />
a Labor Government to " Supply information gathered by the<br />
trans national copporation monitoring agency to the relevant<br />
trade unions and appropriate international trade union<br />
organisations". It further argues that a future Labor Government<br />
will allow unionists to " strike in the course of ( their)<br />
activities immune from any pain or penalties directed against<br />
unions or unionists." This is simply capitulation to the<br />
union movement and a prescription for community chaos.<br />
The complicity of the Labor Party in industrial chaos can no<br />
longer be tolerated. On the 20th of September this year the<br />
Leader of the opposition was reported as arguing that the<br />
Labor Party and the unions were " two separate bodies",<br />
that he " could not possibly endorse" the " foolish behaviour<br />
of some unions". Yet confronted by serious strikes and<br />
disputes in recent months the Telecom dispute, Australia Post<br />
disputes, the current Queensland power dispute, the<br />
transport strikes in South Australia, Victoria and New South<br />
Wales Mr. Hayden Was silent.<br />
How often do we hear Labor leaders defend the community<br />
interest when it is being undermined by militant union<br />
leadership. The usual silence of Mr. Hayden and Mr. Hawke is<br />
a most forceful commentary on the relation between the<br />
Labor Party and the unions. They are not separate bodies<br />
at all. They seem hand in glove in attempting to distort<br />
the social and economic face of Australia. Any doubt that<br />
this is so was dispelled by the response of the opposition<br />
parties to the Government's recently amended legislation<br />
designed to minimise industrial disruption. </p>
<p>Mr. Clyde Holding, the Member for Melbourne Ports, by his<br />
own admission, based his speech in Parliament on material<br />
provided by the A. C. T. U. Does this mean that the union<br />
movement is now writing some of the Opposition's speeches?<br />
This is a tangible-demonstration of the subservience<br />
of the Labor Party to the needs of the union movement.<br />
We should not be surprised by this. Mr. Hayden is on record<br />
as saying of the union movement: " They are very important<br />
to us historically. Without the financial support they give<br />
us we would wither and go into extinction or we would have<br />
to obtain funds from other sources."<br />
Labor's attitude in recent weeks is consistent with its<br />
approved policy. The Adelaide Conference yields untrammeled<br />
rights to union leaders to bend their own members, employers<br />
and the public to their will without reprisal. This leads<br />
to justifiable fears that Labor in Government would be<br />
the mouthpiece of the union movement just as Mr. Holding<br />
was the mouthpiece recently of the A. C. T. U.<br />
So much for Mr. Hayden's claim in September this year that<br />
the connection between the Labor Party and the union<br />
movement was " largely an illusion". We will always assert<br />
that Governments must be accountable to the community at<br />
large not to powerful sections of it.<br />
Indeed Governments' responsibility is to create a suitable<br />
economic climate in which goods and services are produced,<br />
where jobs are available and incomes can be spent by people in<br />
accordance with their own wishes. It is not the function of<br />
Government to set specific goals for all Australians: to<br />
prescribe for society what it believes society should have.<br />
These decisions in the end must be taken by Australians<br />
themselves. Everything a Government does must aim to place economic<br />
activity at the service of people not Governments. To<br />
secure continued growth and individual freedom in the<br />
we need to win the fight against authoritarian planning<br />
advocated by socialist governments throughout the world.<br />
Woodrow Wilson summed up the continuing position well when<br />
he said, many years ago: " Liberty has never come from<br />
Government. The history of liberty is the history of the<br />
limitation of Government power not the increase of it."<br />
We must strive in the 1980' s to write another chapter into<br />
that history.<br />
We enter this period with a record of Australia becoming<br />
economically healthy once again. over the last four years of<br />
Liberal-Country Party Government in Australia, the objectives<br />
for re-establishing economic growth have been maintained. </p>
<p>-6<br />
The Government's consistent policy has been to keep<br />
downward pressure on the rate of inflation. As a result,<br />
inflation in Australia is now lower than in most other<br />
Western countries and there has been a greater increase<br />
in our international competitiveness. Labor inherited<br />
in 1972 an inflation rate of 5.8 per cent, their legacy<br />
to our Government was an inflation rate of 15.1 per cent<br />
which we have been able to reduce to single digit<br />
figures. We have controlled the size of the public sector.<br />
We have held Government spending over the last three<br />
years to a near constant in real terms. By contrast,<br />
in one year 1974/ 75, under the Whitlam Government,<br />
Commonwealth outlays rose by 46 per cent. The domestic<br />
deficit this year of $ 875 million is less than half that of<br />
last year. In 1978/ 79 the volume of manufacturing exports<br />
was up 21 per cent. Real private business investment<br />
rose by 9.7 per cent.<br />
The Australian Government has been in the vanguard of major<br />
industrialised countries in espousing the view that the<br />
defeat of inflation is a fundamental pre-condition to<br />
lasting economic growth. Only this way, can business<br />
confidence grow and profitability increase and then,<br />
and then alone, will long term increases in job<br />
opportunities occur. There is rno room for complacency.<br />
Much remains to be done.<br />
To go forward into the 80' s with vigour and vision we<br />
must capture the innovative and competitive spirit of<br />
all Australians. Through Liberal Government, individual<br />
Australians have the chance for success born of initiative,<br />
the utilisation of resources and hard work.<br />
If we maintain our quest for excellence in fields of<br />
scholarship, business, the arts, and sport we enhance<br />
our capacity to strengthen national morale-and confidence.<br />
Much is being said internationally about resources<br />
these days. Let that debate not obscure our faith in<br />
Australia's human resources. The capacity to strive to<br />
seek to find, and not to yield, is possessed by all of us.<br />
No doubt, from time to time, there will be those who dampen<br />
our creative impulses by cynicism; who obscure our<br />
enthusiasm with negative thinking. But we must rise above<br />
these obstacles. A Liberal Government will always aim to<br />
push the frontiers of individual achievement further<br />
and further out.<br />
Any Party can assert its dedication to individual freedom.<br />
But a Party expresses that freedom only when it recognises<br />
that individuality and diversity are central to the human<br />
make-up; that from them stem fulfillment and self esteem. / 17 </p>
<p>For South Australians this is not a time to be timid and<br />
tentative in the steps we take. There is cause for confidence<br />
and already the first signs have emerged. Now that the<br />
South Australian election is behind us, the development<br />
of Roxby Downs can proceed. The project is no longer being<br />
blocked by a Labor State Government: the Liberal State<br />
Government in South Australia stands behind it.<br />
For its part, the Commonwealth, under its foreign investment<br />
policy, has approved B. P. and Western Mining undertaking<br />
exploration and development of the prospect. Of course,<br />
there will have to be environmental studies, but the way is now<br />
open to explore the possibilities of this unique resources.<br />
The Roxby Downs project could be of the size of Mt. Isa,<br />
a $ 600 million a $ 1,000 million copper, uranium and gold<br />
investment that could, when developed, add to the workforce<br />
some 4,000-5,000 jobs.<br />
All this means that South Australia is now firmly placed to<br />
complement the progress being achieved at a national level.<br />
The decision made last September 15 by the South Australian<br />
electorate has given a further impetus to the developing<br />
momentum of Liberalism in this country. The onus is on us<br />
all, with resolution and commitment to defend unapologetically<br />
what our Party stands for and the principles to which<br />
it gives expression. 000---</p>
