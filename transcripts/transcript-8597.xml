TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP,<br />
DOORSTOP, JOHNSTONE SHIRE COUNCIL CHAMBERS, INNISFAIL,<br />
29 JULY 1992<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
J: Mr Keating, what's your reaction to Opposition claims<br />
that you are deliberately avoiding Cairns in the lead<br />
up to the election?<br />
PM: I was in Cairns two weeks ago on a private visit, and<br />
you can't be everywhere at once, can you? I was in<br />
Townsville this morning and Innisfail today with Rob<br />
J: So Mr Gayler hasn't told you to stay away?<br />
PM: Mr Gayler is always wanting me to come there, and I<br />
will whenever I can. But as I say, I was there two<br />
weeks ago, that's reasonably recent.<br />
J: So why visit Innisfail?<br />
PM: Well, why not is the question. It's an important<br />
district in North Queensland. It's not only important,<br />
it's a very pretty district, I might say. And one gets<br />
a feel of the local community, the agriculture. I've<br />
just been to the Northern Iron and Brass Foundry and<br />
presented some awards for aprentf gshlps'. -With ' the<br />
focus this week onyouth trainnn arnlolrmentL, ntdh is<br />
was a good thing to be doing. And Rob ( Hulls) and I<br />
are going to be meeting representative members of the<br />
community. I've Just been out to see some of the<br />
structural adjustment things we funded with the Shire<br />
here, Warrina Lakes, which is a lovely thing.<br />
J: How would you gauge the Far North's response to your<br />
visit?<br />
PM: Well, I had 1 think a reasonable reception last night<br />
in Townsville, a very warm visit to Townsville. While<br />
there I opened the reclamation on Townsville Harbour,<br />
with a $ 20 million program from the Commonwealth under </p>
<p>the One Nation package, and announced a further<br />
million under the BetrtiJrOrD for Townsville.<br />
And that, of course, was exceptionally well received,<br />
as has been the funding which the Commonwealth has<br />
spent here in Innisfail in the structural adjustmenit<br />
package. The Commonwealth is relevant to North<br />
Queensland. And in the spirit of One Nation, no place<br />
in Australia Is not part of it all.<br />
J: Prime Minister, the 0.3 per cent fall in the cost of<br />
living, is there any case at all for a national wage<br />
increase this year?<br />
PM: Well, the Treasurer will be talking about this today,<br />
but it's a marvellous result minus 0.3 per cent. It<br />
gives us 1.2 per cent inflation for the year. It Means<br />
Australia is pinning in, bolting in that low inflation<br />
rate. And most particularly, the survey of<br />
inflationary expectations has come down yet again,<br />
which will give Australians interested in Australian<br />
competitiveness, I think, a very clear view that we<br />
have broken the inflation stick. That is, that<br />
inflation is down, to stay down. This is a great<br />
national achievement.<br />
3: What about the implication for wages, though, Prime<br />
minister?<br />
PM: The Treasurer should answer this.<br />
J; What about monetary Policy. Obviously this beds down<br />
the easing<br />
PM: Again, that's for the Treasurer to handle.<br />
J: Mr Keating, superannuation, what's your response to<br />
employers using a-looph-o Tto cut 10 per cent<br />
PM: These are the people who should have paid the 3 per<br />
cent in the late 1980s. When the economy was booming<br />
and when they should have paid the 3 per cent, they<br />
didn't. And some of them are now complaining about<br />
needing to pay it when it should have been paid in the<br />
past. And it's for them to pay it. Basically it's a<br />
sort of red-neck response. The fact is, occupational<br />
super is a great reform for Australia, it will give all<br />
Australians a chance to a better retirement income, it<br />
will build a pool of national savings, and It's the<br />
shortest of the short sighted who can't see it.<br />
J: So the employees will just have to bear it?<br />
PM: No, the employees won't. By and large this will be<br />
paid in accordance with national wage arrangements by<br />
the employer as part of the national wage settlements,<br />
without deductions from employees.<br />
J: The Liberal Party says the seat of Leichhardt is </p>
<p>unwinnable for Labor In this next election. What's<br />
Your response to that?<br />
PM: Well, we've won It I've spent 23 years ini the House<br />
of Representatives and I've seen changes take place in<br />
the Parliament, but we've always had a good grip in the<br />
Beat Of Laichhardt, and we will In the future. Look.<br />
this Government has changed North Queensland. I<br />
remember North Queensland in the early 1980.. I<br />
remember it when the coal development stopped in the<br />
sort of middle of Queensland. There was nothing<br />
happening here. We had businesses closing. You've got<br />
now the tourism industry which was developed by this<br />
Government only, which has basically changed the labour<br />
Position and the prosperity of Northern Queensland.<br />
And the competitiveness of other products, be it beef,<br />
or minerals, or sugar, has been guaranteed by the low<br />
inflation, better wage outcomes, competitive exchange<br />
rate. I mean, Labor has changed the face of North<br />
Queensland, and that's why there are Labor members all<br />
the way down the coast. That's why Rob Hulls has taken<br />
his place in the seat of Kennedy in the Federal<br />
Parliament for the same reason that in an area which<br />
the National Party and the Liberal Party could do<br />
nothing with, we've brought back, we've given it<br />
economic life and a future.<br />
J: Are you happy to see John Gayler not standing again?<br />
He's been an opponent o6f your, in the past.<br />
PM: He has not, no, no, he's been a good friend and a good<br />
member. A good member. And somebody who's won the<br />
seat of Leichhardt for Labor, and flown the flag<br />
through the period. It you compare Cairns and the<br />
Leichhardt region in 1983 and look at it today, it's<br />
totally transformed. John Gayler can take a lot of<br />
credit for that.<br />
J: Mr Keating, Innisfail's unemployment has increased<br />
three-fold. What will you be telling unemployed people<br />
this afternoon when you visit Skillshare?<br />
PM: Skillshare is one of the programs which we've now<br />
decided to fund more of in this package during the<br />
week, to try to give people that counselling and work<br />
experience, which is important to them. But the main<br />
thing is growth, the economy is starting to grow again.<br />
when we get the June Quarter accounts, as we've just<br />
had the June Quarter inflation rats, when the June<br />
Quarter National Accounts come out, I think the year to<br />
June will have grown by about 2 per cent. In the year<br />
we are in now to June next year, we expect it to grow<br />
by around 4. This will be about twice as fast as<br />
Europe is growing. Most of the world is in recession<br />
and we're actually growing faster than most places. So<br />
with it will come the employment, and the more we see<br />
the labour intensive industries continuing to grow,<br />
particularly tourism and some parts of agriculture and<br />
service, well we'll see the employment prospects coming<br />
through, as we had them in the 1980.. Thank you.<br />
ends </p>
