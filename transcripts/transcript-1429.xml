FOR P. RESS: P. M. No. 112/ 1966<br />
PRIME MINISTER'S REPLY TO MR. BARTON<br />
The Prime Minister this afternoon sent the following reply to<br />
Mr. Gordon Barton in Sydney:<br />
" I have your telegran; despatched on Sunday, which<br />
reached me at my Melbourne office this morning. Frankly, I find<br />
a~ n ' Alice in W/ onderland' quality about its timing and its terms which<br />
makes it difficult for me to regard it as intended other than for<br />
propaganda purposes. " It invites me personally to make fundamental changes<br />
in my Government's firmly -established defence and external policies.<br />
These go to the heart of Australia's security. You say, without<br />
evidence or justification, that I entertaied doulrs about the Government's<br />
intervention in Viet Nam from the outset and I tolerate what is being<br />
done there against my private convictions and out of what I believe to<br />
be sheer political necessity.<br />
" All this so seriously mis-states my own fully-publici sed<br />
attitude and the position I have consistently adopted on these matters<br />
that it brings critically into question the bona f ides of your approach.<br />
I have repeatedly stated my belief that the decisions the Government<br />
has taken on Viet Nam and on the participation there of National<br />
Servicemen are right.<br />
" You can question, if that is your view and however<br />
wrong-headed I may believe your view to be the wisdom of these<br />
decisions, and if you disagree with them, stand in opposition to my<br />
Government, but you have no cause to question my sincerity. Even<br />
my opponents of the Labor Party have not done that. It is because<br />
my colleagues and I believe these policies to be right that we accept<br />
the challenge of the Labor Party to make them critical issues of this<br />
campaign. If you feel so strongly hostile to these policies that<br />
you and those associated with you are determined to contest individual<br />
electorates, then it would be more honest and less mystifying to<br />
the public if you were to offer yourselves either simply as Independents<br />
or as Independent Labor candidates. To the best of my knowledge, very few if<br />
any of you have been active members of the Liberal Party. By your<br />
decision to support a socialist p arty which would run out on our allies<br />
arid which, in so many other directions, is fundamentally opposed to the<br />
policies of the party I lead, you have revealed yourselves as without<br />
entitlement to include the word ' Liberal' in the description of your<br />
group. " I have noted your denial that you are in any way a Labor<br />
front organisation. There can be little difference in substance if you<br />
masquerade as Liberals and recommend support for Labor in preference<br />
to support of a Government which has led Australia to its present<br />
strength, prosperity and international standing.<br />
" I need hardly add that your offer of withdrawal is<br />
rejected as are the terms on which you state it to have been based.<br />
CANBERRA, 7th November, 1966. o t </p>
