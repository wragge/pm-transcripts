STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, TMHE HON P J KEATING, MP<br />
PRIME MINISTER'S ATTENDANCE AT COMMONWEALTH HEADS OF<br />
GOVERNMENT MEETING AND VISIT TO INDONESIA<br />
20-20 OCTOBER 1993<br />
I will1 be attending the Commonwealth Head.,; of Government Meeting to be<br />
held in Limassol, Cyprus, from 21 -25 October.<br />
Australia values its membership of the Commonwealth, and I look forward to<br />
joining colleagues from around fifty countries for discussions on a wide range<br />
Of Political and economic issues.<br />
I also look forward to meeting individually w~ th a number of Commonwealth<br />
leaders, particularly from Australia's region.<br />
With President Soeharto's agreement, I will also be making a short visit to<br />
Indonesia from 26-28 October. Since my visiit to Jakarta in April last year,<br />
good progress has been made In the development of our already extensive<br />
-bilateral relationship with Indonesia, including the first meeting of the<br />
Austral ia-indonesia Ministerial Forum in Novemiber 1992.<br />
My meeting with President Soeharto will provide a timely opportunity both to<br />
take stock of this progress and to discuss a number of important regional<br />
issues. I will be particularly interested to disc'liss developments in APEC with<br />
President Soeharto before the November ARP-C Leaders' Economic Meeting<br />
in Seattle, to which we have both been invite~ d, and before Indonesia takes<br />
over as chair of APEC in 1994.<br />
