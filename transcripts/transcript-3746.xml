PRIME MINISTER'S PRESS CONFERENCE<br />
BRISBANE,. FRIDAY. 23. MAY, 1975....<br />
Mr. Wvhitlam: I thought I would begin by announcing a decision<br />
we made in Canberra this morning. It was on the Royal Commissions<br />
into the protection of the Great Barrier Reef. You remember<br />
the Australian and Queensland Governments appointed joint Royal<br />
Commissions in May 1970 and the report camne to hand six months<br />
ago. Cabinet considered the report this morning. We decided<br />
that there should be no drilling in the area of the Reef<br />
until more scientific evidence is available about the long term<br />
effects of possible oil pollution on the Reef and its ecosystems.<br />
You might remember there was a difference of opinion between the<br />
three Commissioners on the degree of' risk involved. We came down<br />
firmly on the side of taking no risk at all. All the Commissioners,<br />
all three of them, were agreed that no drilling should be permitted<br />
on any cay, island, reef or national park or marine park when<br />
declared. Two of the Commissioners, Dr. Smith and Mr. Moroni,<br />
felt that with certain strict safeguards, drilling might be<br />
permitted in designated areas around the Reef. The Chairman,<br />
Mr. Justice Wallace, the former President of the Court of Appeal<br />
of New South Wales, felt that this would be an unacceptable risk<br />
and that all drilling should be prohibited until further scientific<br />
inquiries had been made and the degree of risk established. We<br />
accepted Sir Gordon Wallace's view. I wrote to Mr. Bjelke-Petersen<br />
this morning, informing him of-our decision and seeking his<br />
support for our stand, suggesting that our respective Ministers<br />
should consult as soon as possible about carrying out the decision.<br />
To put the safety of the Reef beyond doubt, we on Thursday,<br />
yesterday, introduced a Bill to establish a Great Barrier Reef<br />
Marine Park. This is in accordance with an undertaking I gave<br />
here six months ago. I hope the Queensland Government will<br />
cooperate with us in establishing a joint authority to administer<br />
the Park for the protection of a great natural and national asset.<br />
Are there any questions you would like to ask?<br />
Question: Can Queenslanders expect that you will give the<br />
Barrier Reef better protection than you have given Fraser Island?<br />
Mr. Whitlam: The Barrier Reef in our view, falls within Federal<br />
jurisdiction. Fraser Island does not. Federal jurisdiction<br />
covers the Northern Territory, the Australian Capital Territory:.<br />
there's no doubt about that. We also believe that the seabed<br />
around Australia falls within Federal jurisdiction. You remember<br />
it was on this basis that Mr. McMahon when he was Foreign Minister,<br />
in April, 1970, sponsored a Bill, when Mr. Gorton was Prime<br />
Minister, to declare Australian jurisdiction over the seabed.<br />
That Government, including Mr. McMahon's Government, when he<br />
ousted Mr. Gorton, didn't proceed with the Bill. We passed it.<br />
All theStates have now challenged it in the High Court. We </p>
<p>are confident, however, that we have power there, so we<br />
exercise it. But on Fraser Island, that is State territory<br />
and, accordingly, any authority we have starts at the stage<br />
of exports only. That is, we can't say that people can mine<br />
or cannot mine. We can't say on what conditions they can mine.<br />
All we can do turns on whether they can make exports. Now you<br />
asked me about Fraser Island in particular. You are referring<br />
to the fact that we have said, in effect, we can't stop the<br />
export of minerals under arrangements which were operating<br />
before we came into office or before we passed any laws about<br />
it.<br />
Question: YourcCabinet decision on the Barrier Reef Is<br />
that an attempt perhaps to recoup some of the bad publicity<br />
you received on Fraser Island?<br />
Mr. Whitlam: We have been committed to having a Great Barrier<br />
Reef National Park, Marine Park. I'm sure I promised it in<br />
the 1974 policy speech and I'm pretty sure I promised it the<br />
1972 policy speech. It's a very complicated piece of legislation<br />
because it wants to rely on all the Constitutional authority we<br />
have the seabed, international treaties, and so on. You look<br />
at the Bill we brought in last night. We promised to do this,<br />
we believe we are entitled to do it, now we have done it.<br />
Question:<br />
decision? Wouldn't this seem to pre-empt the High Court<br />
Mr. Whitlam: You can't wait until you get the decision. If<br />
we wait until all the challenges there are about half a dozen<br />
different challenges and each of those is supportedby more than<br />
one State if we waited until the High Court handed down its<br />
judgement in all these half dozen challenges, we would have to<br />
just mark time. We take the view, as the Gorton Government took,<br />
and as I believe Mr. McMahon personally took, that the Australian<br />
Parliament is entitled to pass laws concerning the seabed around<br />
Australia, so we have gone ahead on that basis.<br />
Question: I understand the Queensland Government considers<br />
that the granting of oil drilling permits is within its jurisdiction.<br />
What can the Federal Government do if the Queensland Government<br />
continues along that line?<br />
Mr. Whitlam: When this Act goes through, and I would expect<br />
that it would go through the House of Representatives by the<br />
end of next week and through the Senate by the end of the<br />
following week, that will then, we think, be the law. If any<br />
drilling goes ahead, we would think it would be in breach of the<br />
law. I suppose we would have to wait for the High Court decision<br />
there, but people who would undertake drilling now, and it has<br />
been suspended for some years, anybody whoundertook drilling<br />
now, would do so with the full knowledge that the Federal<br />
Parliament has passed the law and unless the High Court declares </p>
<p>that law invalid, then that's a law which the person starting<br />
drilling would have to obey. He would be committing a breach<br />
of the law if he went ahead. The law has been passed and<br />
therefore they would breach it at their risk.<br />
Question: Is this, legislation then virtually a challenge<br />
to the High Court?<br />
Mr. Whitlan: No, we are going ahead on the basis, partly,<br />
that we do have the legislative authority over the seabed.<br />
There are, in addition, some international conventions covering<br />
it and we would rely on those too.<br />
Question:. Are you not challenging the High Court to find<br />
in. your favour?<br />
Mr. Whitlam: The* States,. all of them, have challenged our<br />
Seas and Submerged Lands Act, which is the same piece of<br />
legislation that Mr. McMahon introduced under Mr. Gorton,<br />
five years-ago last month. The States have challenged the law.<br />
Question: But you could go-and establish National Parks<br />
and then have the High Court rule them as out of order because of<br />
State territories.<br />
Mr. Whitlam: That could be. But in the meantime, I hasten to<br />
say, we offered I think, at least six months ago, we offered<br />
to the Queensland Government.. I wrote to Mr. Bjelke-Petersen<br />
saying let's have a Joint Board or Commission running the<br />
National Park. And under the Bill which we brought in last<br />
night, we would propose to ask Queensland to appoint people<br />
to it. We want a joint one.<br />
Question: Is it true that you expect that ,: cooperation from<br />
the State Government in view of what's happened in the past?<br />
Mr. Whitlam: I'd go no further and say that I hope. The offer's<br />
been there for at least half a year. I think I wrote to<br />
Mr. Bjelke-Petersen just after the elections last year, that's<br />
in May I think.<br />
Question: Will you be very disappointed if he doesn't<br />
give that cooperation?<br />
Mr. Whitlam: I will be disappointed, yes.<br />
Question: Is it correct, that Cabinet has decided against<br />
extending the minimum floor price for wool? </p>
<p>Mr. Whitlam: The decision that the Cabinet made this morning<br />
on this matter will be given by the Minister for Agriculture,<br />
Senator Wriedt, to the Australian Wool Industry Conference.<br />
Question: What reaction<br />
Mr. Whitlam: I don't know that, but that's when it will be<br />
given. Question: What reaction will you get from wool growers, Sir?<br />
: Mr. Whitlam: I've . given an answer to that one.<br />
Question: Will. that be on Tuesday, Sir?<br />
Mr. Whitlam: I don't know when the Australian Wool Industry<br />
Conference is to meet the Minister.<br />
But Cabinet has made a firm decision on it?<br />
Mr. Whitlam: Yes.<br />
Question: Has it rejected it?<br />
Mr. Whitlam: I've given an answer to this one.<br />
Question: Cabinet also today decided to appoint a three<br />
man Royal Commission into pecuniary interests of parliamentarians.<br />
Could I ask you, Sir, why a Royal Commission, why an inquiry<br />
at such a high level?<br />
Mr. Whitlam: The parliament resolved that there should be a<br />
judicial inquiry. That meant an inquiry by judges. Now the<br />
best way, we believe, to have an inquiry by judges is to appoint<br />
them as Royal Commissioners. Once you appoint them as Royal<br />
Commissioners, they can require people to give information in<br />
reference to them. If you don't make them Royal Commissioners,<br />
then they can ask somebody to give them information and that<br />
person can defy them.<br />
Question: inquiry? Can you give us the terms of reference for this<br />
Mr. Whitlam: I haven't got them with me, but they were<br />
substantially stated in the resolution of the parliament<br />
Question: * r </p>
<p>three weeks ago.<br />
Question: Has any decision been made as to who will make<br />
up the Commission?<br />
Mr. Whitlam: No. Even if there had been,* I wouldn't tell<br />
you those, because obviously one has to wait until the<br />
Governor-General appoints them, but I can tell you we have<br />
not approached judges at this stage. After all, we only<br />
decided this morning that it would be a Royal Commission<br />
and that there would be three Royal Commissioners. But: it's<br />
been known for at least three weeks that there would have to<br />
be at least one judge or retired judge conducting it. So.<br />
we decided that there should be three judges, or retired judges,<br />
and that they should be Royal Commissioners.<br />
Question: What about the suggested changes in ministerial<br />
responsibilities for some members of your Cabinet? Is this in<br />
fact true that you will be making--. changes in the near future?<br />
Mr. Whitlan: ' There's one change that I'm going to make. When<br />
the Telecommunications Bill and the Postal Services Bill are<br />
passed by the House of Representatives, the Telecommunications<br />
Commission and the Postal Commission will come into operation<br />
and the Postmaster-General's Department will be abolished.<br />
Senator Bishop will be the last Australian Postmaster-General<br />
and he will take over one of Mr. Enderby's portfolios-<br />
Police and Customs.<br />
Question: What about Housing? Will that be taken off<br />
Mr. Johnson and given to Mr<br />
Mr. Whitlam: You ask me directly: no But frankly there is<br />
no basis whatever for this speculation. It's significant<br />
that this was in the papers earlier in the week and I suppose<br />
I'm asked more questions at question time than anyone and<br />
nobody thought there was sufficient strength in that speculation<br />
to ask me. If they -thought I'd be embarrassed by this in<br />
parliament, they would have asked me, but nobody asked. There's<br />
no strength in that whatever. We created the Department of<br />
Housing and Construction. We created it.<br />
Question: What about Mr. Connor's standing after this<br />
$ 2,000 mhillion loan business that's been causing such a scandal?<br />
Mr. Whitlam: Be more precise. What do you mean scandal? </p>
<p>Question: According to Mr. Anthony it is a scandal.<br />
Mr. Whitlam: Mr. Anthony talking about scandals! Don't<br />
hide behind him. Let him say that to my face. You put<br />
something directly to me yourself.<br />
Question: Did the news of the loan affect Australia's<br />
overseas credit rating? Was that reason, or one of the<br />
reasons why Mr. Connor's authority was revoked?<br />
Mr. Whitlam:" No, I told the parliament yesterday that you<br />
can only raise one" loan overseas at a time and we were raising<br />
a loan in the United States. Now that being. so, you've got<br />
to end any other. negotiations you're carrying on for loans.<br />
There are two big. nations which lend money the United States<br />
and West Germany and each of them makes that requirement.<br />
I stated that . yesterday. 1.<br />
V" , I I<br />
Question:: Will the authority be given back to Mr. Connor<br />
to re-negotiate this loan?<br />
Mr. Whitlam: We'll wait until there's some proposition before<br />
anything like that comes':. up.<br />
Question: Any comment on Mr. Gorton's resignation from<br />
the Liberal Party and his decision to stand as an independent<br />
for the Senate in the A. C. T.?<br />
Mr. Whitlam: I don't come into such painful political questions<br />
as that. You'll be asking me about the split up in Western<br />
Australia next and. Mr. Bjelke-Petersen's visit there. What canI say<br />
about Mr. Gorton? Obviously it is an astonishing thing when a<br />
former Prime Minister leaves the Party he led. That's big<br />
news but I don't want to say anthing more about it. I've<br />
made a couple of references to Mr. Gorton in earlier comments<br />
to you. As you know, I support, always have supported, my<br />
Party's always supported, some of the things for which he has<br />
stood. After all, he was the first Australian Prime Minister<br />
to show any interest in the Barrier Reef. He was the first<br />
Australian Prime Minister to show any interest in the Australian<br />
seabed. He persuaded Mr. Bjelke-Petersen to appoint the Royal<br />
Commission into the Barrier Reef. He got through his Parliamentary<br />
Party federally, the Bill to declare Australian jurisdiction<br />
over the seabed. I support very much some of the initiatives<br />
he took and I'm proud that I was able to consummate those<br />
initiatives. His crowd let him down. We have pushed them through.<br />
Question: What sort of penalties are you thinking of in<br />
this oil drilling legislation? Any special penalties for<br />
people who break the law in that particular regard, with oil<br />
drilling in the Great Barrier Reef?<br />
_ C </p>
<p>Mr. Whitlam: No. I can't remember what the penalties are.<br />
I frankly can't remember. But there are penalties. I think<br />
we should remember that penalties are of three kinds. One is<br />
you can have a jail sentence, one is a fine, one is just getting<br />
the Courts to enjoin somebody from breaking the law,. and then,<br />
of course, if any person breaks an injunction like that, he<br />
goes to Court for contempt of Court. It could be in any of<br />
those three respects.<br />
Question: You mentioned the loan negotiations going on<br />
in the United States. How long had they been going on before<br />
it was realised that you had two negotiations going at once?<br />
Mr. Whitlam: The negotiations in the United States have just<br />
started this week.<br />
Question: Why didn't you continue with negotiations for<br />
the $ 2,000 million that<br />
Mr. Whitlam: You've got to choose which one you go ahead with.<br />
You can't have competing loan negotiations. You have one or<br />
the other.<br />
Question: Can you say what that $ 2,000 million that<br />
Mr. Connor was negotiating was to be used for in Australia?<br />
Mr. Whitlan: In connection with energy matters, that is, to<br />
maximise the development of Australian energy resources.<br />
Question: Could you be more specific, Sir?<br />
Mr. Whitlam: Well, look at the energy resources we have here.<br />
We have natural gas, we have uranium, we have coal, we have both<br />
black coal and Jignite, we have some hydro.<br />
Question: Could you explain a little more explicitly, Sir,<br />
as to why the United States loan negotiations were continued?<br />
Mr. Whitlam: Why they were commenced?<br />
Question: Why you decided to drop these other negotiations<br />
in favour of the United States?<br />
Mr. Whitlam: We decided the United States one was specific and<br />
immediate. </p>
<p>Question: There was more chance of obtaining money from<br />
the United States rather than from this $ 2,000 million loan?<br />
Mr. Whitlam: It was immediate and specific.<br />
Question: Were you happy with the Queensland<br />
Can I ask a question of the poor showing in the<br />
Mr. Whitlam: This is a bit far back now, isn't<br />
six months ago, really. I think it's been much Labor image?--<br />
State elections<br />
it. That's.<br />
improved.<br />
Question: Will the money to be raised in the United States<br />
be of a similar amount to the $ 2,000 million.<br />
Mr. ' Whitlam: . No, no.<br />
Question: Will it be used for the same purposes as you<br />
outlined in Mr. Connor's 3? 1;<br />
I I<br />
Mr. Whitlam: No.<br />
Question: What will it be used for?<br />
Mr. Whitlam: General governmental purposes in Australia, that's<br />
all general ones.<br />
Question: Why have you decided to drop these measures that<br />
you wanted the $ 2,000 million for?<br />
Mr. Whitlam: We aren't dropping those measures at all. We<br />
are intent on doing all these matters in the energy field.<br />
After all, we established the Pipeline Authority, we established<br />
the Petroleum and Minerals Authority, we have expanded the operation<br />
of the Australian Atomic Energy Commission. In all these respects,<br />
it is very obvious that we are pushing ahead with the development<br />
of one of Australia's principal strengths, namely our energy<br />
resources.<br />
Question: Then it is possible that you could re-open<br />
negotiations for the $ 2,000 million<br />
Mr. Whitlam: That's your speculation. </p>
<p>Question: You've told us that you think the Labor image<br />
in Queensland has improved since the election, and yet we<br />
see just recently and because of the Caucus vote on Fraser<br />
Island, a deepening rift between Mr. Burns and his Deputy.<br />
Does this concern you?<br />
Mr. Whitlam: I only know what I see in this afternoon's paper<br />
and I have learned from long experience to look behind the<br />
headlines.<br />
Question: Would you attempt to mediate if you find<br />
Mr. Whitlam: Now, wait a bit. I have stated where there is<br />
Federal jurisdiction.. I want you to get clear what the Federal<br />
jurisdiction is in matters within State boundaries. Why the<br />
Federal Government decided to allow the Fraser Island people<br />
to export the minerals which they've been mining there, is<br />
because they were entirely within the law in what they had<br />
done. They had got the leases within the law. They had been<br />
subjected to a public inquiry on environmental issues. They<br />
had undertaken to comply with the findings of that public inquiry.<br />
They had undertaken operations on those leases in accordance<br />
with those environmental conditions. They had done all those<br />
things before my Government was elected. Furthermore, when<br />
my Government was elected, there was no law preventing the<br />
export of any minerals other than iron ore and uranium. our<br />
predecessors had no laws forbidding the export of minerals.<br />
It was one of the very first things we did. It was one of<br />
the very first submissions before our Government. It came<br />
from Mr. Connor and it was to prevent the export of any mineral<br />
from Australia without the authorisation of the Minister for<br />
Minerals and Energy. Let's get this quite clear. It is true<br />
there are divisions of opinion in the Labor Party purely on this<br />
question Should any Government make something illegal retrospectively?<br />
Should you say that something that was quite legal.<br />
when it was done, is now to be retrospectively made an offence?<br />
And the Government has decided that it shouldn't. Now let's<br />
look on the other side of politics. The mining is going on<br />
there under a State law. The leases were granted by<br />
Mr. Bjelke-Petersen as the responsible Minister himself. In<br />
our parliament, federally, Mr. Fraser, Mr. Lynch, the Leader<br />
of the Opposition, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition,<br />
Mr. Anthony, the Leader of the National Country Party,<br />
Mr. Sinclair, the Deputy Leader of it, have never said a word<br />
of criticism of the mining on Fraser Island or the exportation<br />
of the minerals mined on Fraser Island. They've not said a word.<br />
Some of you may know Mr. Anthony's family has interests on<br />
Fraser Island. Now do at least be a bit relevant. There are<br />
differences of opinion within the Labor Party. I believe that<br />
no Government should make a legal action retrospectively illegal.<br />
We have passed the law now. Anybody who now seeks to mine on<br />
Fraser Island and any new lease where there's been no mining<br />
up till now, knows that we require an environmental impact<br />
statement and a favourable result from any public inquiry,<br />
before we will give authorisation to export the mineral. </p>
<p>They know that. That's now the law, but you can't fairly,<br />
justly make a law retrospective.<br />
Question: Do you foresee a clash between the Unions and<br />
the Federal Government over the Fraser Island sand mining issue<br />
now that the Unions have decided to black ban the company's<br />
operations in Australia?<br />
Mr. Whitlam: Have they? i'<br />
