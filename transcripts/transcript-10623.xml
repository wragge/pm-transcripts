<p>LYNEHAM:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, welcome again to Nightline.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Good evening Paul.</p>
<p>LYNEHAM:</p>
<p>What's wrong with the Democrats' idea of means testing</p>
<p>   the health insurance rebate so that it cuts out after families earn</p>
<p>   $50,000 and singles $30,000?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, a hell of a lot of Australian families now Mum and Dad both</p>
<p>   working, where the total family income is nearly $50,000.</p>
<p>LYNEHAM:</p>
<p>They say you'd get 68% of families...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>But you've got to be out of touch with reality. You only need</p>
<p>   Dad earning $30,000 and Mum earning $25,000 and you are chopped</p>
<p>   out. That is leaving out half of middle Australia and if you want</p>
<p>   to get coverage you've got to, in my view, have a non-means</p>
<p>   tested rebate so that you get as many people as possible taking</p>
<p>   out private health insurance. The name of the game is to get volume,</p>
<p>   to get large numbers of people taking out private health insurance</p>
<p>   to take the load off the public hospital system.</p>
<p>LYNEHAM:</p>
<p>And I'll bet you'd have private health insurance whether</p>
<p>   you got the rebate or not. I would and a lot of people would.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>But I'm earning, by community standards, a very high income.</p>
<p>LYNEHAM:</p>
<p>So are you going to knock back the cheque?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No...</p>
<p>LYNEHAM:</p>
<p>Why should you get it? Why should I get it?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>But that's not the point, because we represent a very small...</p>
<p>   you and I earn incomes which are amongst sort of one or two per</p>
<p>   cent of the community, and there is an enormous number of families</p>
<p>   now who have combined incomes with both partners working, $60,000</p>
<p>   - $70,000 a year. That is an increasingly common thing. Now, if</p>
<p>   you had the Democrat approach, you knock them out.</p>
<p>LYNEHAM:</p>
<p>They say it would also free up about $800 million for things like</p>
<p>   a real push on waiting lists, the dental scheme, all sorts of potentially</p>
<p>   very useful...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well you fix the waiting list, or you reduce them, if you get more</p>
<p>   people into private health insurance because you take the strain</p>
<p>   off the public hospitals. You cannot begin to reduce the waiting</p>
<p>   lists until you arrest the drift of people out of private health</p>
<p>   insurance. Even Graham Richardson, a former Labor health minister</p>
<p>   agrees with that.</p>
<p>LYNEHAM:</p>
<p>And after a couple of years of premium price rises, don't</p>
<p>   you end up back at square one, but with a huge annual bill to pay?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No because you'll always be paying far less if you have a</p>
<p>   rebate. Always.</p>
<p>LYNEHAM:</p>
<p>So the incentive is still there to keep in it.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>LYNEHAM:</p>
<p>So your tax reform package went through the House of Reps today.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>A great day. I mean this is the biggest tax reform package ever</p>
<p>   since federation and I am very proud of what the Government has</p>
<p>   been able to do. We've now got to get it through the Senate,</p>
<p>   which obviously will be harder, but we go to Christmas full of positive</p>
<p>   thoughts about the future of tax reform.</p>
<p>LYNEHAM:</p>
<p>And when it gets to the Senate, those inquiries, isn't there</p>
<p>   the danger they'll get all these experts pulling us to pieces</p>
<p>   and public support will start to fall away?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I don't believe so. I think the public is awake up to the</p>
<p>   fact that the Labor Party goes into those inquiries with a prejudiced</p>
<p>   position. I mean, they've said that no matter what comes out</p>
<p>   they are saying no, and I think the public will discount some of</p>
<p>   the gloom and doom that will come out of the inquiry.</p>
<p>LYNEHAM:</p>
<p>But what about the independent experts who came in?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well there are a lot of independent experts that will come in and</p>
<p>   tell the Australian people how terrific the plan is. I've taken</p>
<p>   this plan through the fire of an election campaign. </p>
<p>LYNEHAM:</p>
<p>On the jobs front, how can we have strong growth at around five</p>
<p>   per cent yet unemployment bouncing back to eight per cent? Isn't</p>
<p>   that a worry?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Look, unemployment is still too high and I didn't get overly</p>
<p>   excited about the 7.7 per cent figure. I thought it was nice and</p>
<p>   it will keep jumping around but the trend is certainly better, the</p>
<p>   trend unemployment level is 7.9% which is a good deal better than</p>
<p>   what we inherited, but it is a slow process and we won't make</p>
<p>   further steps without things like unfair dismissal laws being passed</p>
<p>   by the Parliament and some other reforms that will over time produce</p>
<p>   a better outcome, but it is still a slog. And you need to have sustained</p>
<p>   periods at that level of economic growth to get the benefit.</p>
<p>LYNEHAM:</p>
<p>But can we just wait for growth to provide jobs Prime Minister</p>
<p>   because... (inaudible).. economy, it doesn't look like it</p>
<p>   has been happening really...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>But Paul, there is no artificial way of generating jobs, and given</p>
<p>   the quite proper Australian ethos of not having unacceptably low</p>
<p>   wages, we need to be patient.</p>
<p>LYNEHAM:</p>
<p>Do you think it was also the era in which One Nation's bubble</p>
<p>   finally burst?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh yes I do, I think that was a very significant development. One</p>
<p>   Nation came and started to go in 1998. I don't think it has</p>
<p>   gone altogether, but it has certainly started to go. It's on</p>
<p>   the way out but I don't think people can assume that it is</p>
<p>   finished.</p>
<p>LYNEHAM:</p>
<p>And holidays again this year, same place?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I think I may break the habit of a generation and not go to the</p>
<p>   same place?</p>
<p>LYNEHAM:</p>
<p>Oh God, why?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I'm not changing political parties or anything Paul.</p>
<p>LYNEHAM:</p>
<p>This is deeply significant ...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>It is, yes, it's writ large with meaning. I don't quite</p>
<p>   know where we are going but I think it may well be for a combination</p>
<p>   of reasons, including, I'm sorry to say, the intrusiveness,</p>
<p>   not of Channel Nine I hasten to add, but some other media outlets</p>
<p>   earlier this year... </p>
<p>LYNEHAM:</p>
<p>So you are not going to tell us where you are going?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No. </p>
<p>LYNEHAM:</p>
<p>Well, wherever it is enjoy it.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>And you thank you. And merry Christmas to all of your listeners.</p>
<p> [ends] </p>
