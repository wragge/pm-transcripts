PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 19 June 1985<br />
The Minister assisting the Prime Minister for the<br />
Bicentenary, Mr Barry Cohen, and the Minister for Aboriginal<br />
Affairs, Mr Clyde Holding, today announced the appointment of<br />
Mr Eric Willmot, AM, to the Board of the Australian<br />
Bicentennial Authority.<br />
Mr Willmot brings to the position wide ranging knowledge and<br />
experience, particularly in issues facing Aboriginal people.<br />
" The appointment of a prominent member of the Aboriginal<br />
community", Mr Cohen and Mr Holding said, " is a tangible<br />
expression of the Commonwealth Government's hope that all<br />
Australians will share in the planning for 1988. This is in<br />
line with the Bicentennial theme ' Living Together'."<br />
Mr Willmot has had a distinguished career, both as an<br />
academic and a public servant. He was Principal of the<br />
Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies from 1981 to<br />
1984; he is currently Deputy Secretary of the Department of<br />
Aboriginal Affairs. He will take up the Chair of Education<br />
at James Cook University, North Queensland, in January 1986.<br />
He has received both international and Australian awards in the<br />
engineering field, and was Australian Inventor of the Year<br />
in 1981.<br />
Last-year Mr Willmot was made a Member of the Order of Australia<br />
for services to education and Aboriginal studies. </p>
