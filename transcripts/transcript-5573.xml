P. FOR MEDIA FRIDAY, APRIL 24 1981<br />
OPENING OF THE PAPUA NEW GUINEA HIGH COMMISSION<br />
I am honoured to be invited to participate on this historic<br />
and symbolic occasion.<br />
Hich Commissioner Mr Sapias, thank you for asking me to join<br />
you at your Chancery at your country's High Commission today.<br />
Sir Julius, I have been delighted to welcome you and your<br />
daughter personally to Canberra and to say how welcome<br />
also are your distinguished colleagues and the senior<br />
representatives of your country who have done us the honour<br />
of being here today.<br />
You and I, Sir Julius and our Foreign Ministers will<br />
later today be exchanging views on bilateral and international<br />
issues of current interest to our two countries. I look<br />
forward to being with you again later in the year-at the<br />
Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Melbourne.<br />
Australians are delighted by the fact that this is the first<br />
office which your Government has had specially designed and<br />
constructed in countries where you have diplomatic representation.<br />
This is an honour for Australia an honour which my Government<br />
recognises and very much appreciates. We interpret your<br />
decision as one which deliberately symbolises the importance<br />
your Government places on our relationship. For our part,<br />
my Government will continue to attach the highest importance<br />
to that relationship.<br />
I congratulate all those whose imagination, careful planning,<br />
and practical construction skills have contributed to these<br />
buildings. The use of traditional Papua New Guinea design<br />
combined with functional simplicity has produced a<br />
diplomatic mission of striking beauty and one which contribut~ es<br />
gracefully to the Canberra scene.<br />
You have done us proud. The location of your High Commission<br />
amongst those of our friends and colleagues from Britain,<br />
New Zealand, Canada and Malaysia is symbolic of some very<br />
important strands in the foreign policies of our two countries.. / 2 </p>
<p>2<br />
There is firstly our association in the Commonwealth,<br />
a unique organisation which has long proved its ability<br />
to bring together leaders of a wide range of countries in<br />
consultation and in development of practical co-operation.<br />
There is the priority we both accord to close co-operation<br />
with our South Pacific neighbours.<br />
Prime Minister, High Commissioner: This is a day of<br />
achievement in which we can feel great satisfaction.<br />
It is a day of celebration in which I know all your<br />
Australian friends here are delighted to join.<br />
