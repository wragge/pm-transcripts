FOUR C ORNERS INTERVIEW WITH THE PRIME MINISTER.<br />
THE RIGHT HON. J. G6 G'ORTON<br />
Reporters: John Temple<br />
Michael Willosoe<br />
John Penlington<br />
TEMPLE: Good evening. This last edition of Four<br />
Corners for 1968 is coming from Canberra. An interview with the<br />
Prime Minister, the Right Hon. J. G. Gorton, looking back on his<br />
first year of office. With me are John Penlington and Michael<br />
Will see, Prime Minister, since you camo to office<br />
there have been some quite dramatic changes in the strategic<br />
situation in the area Britain's accelerated withdrawal from<br />
east of Suez, America's scale down in Vietnam and apparent<br />
reluctance to become too involved in future in Asia,~ As a result<br />
of these, how much more vulnerable is Australia?<br />
PRIM4E MINISTER:* Well, I don't think Australia is any more<br />
vulnerable at all, if you're talking in the terms of an invasion<br />
or a likely incursion across the borders of Australia by some<br />
hostile power. I believe without question that the A. N. Z. U.. S.<br />
Treaty covers Australia and New Zealand and we have ourselves<br />
increased our own capacity to defend ourselves. So if that is<br />
the sense in which one is talking I believe we are no more<br />
vulnerable at all. But nevertheless, it would be true to say<br />
that Britain's accelerated withdrawal and the debate going on<br />
in the United States as to the extent of involvement and the kind<br />
of involvement that country should have in South-East Asia, would<br />
have created conditions there less stable than before these things<br />
happened. QUJESTION: Could I ask you what Australia is going to<br />
do in this less stable situation? At your press conference </p>
<p>2-<br />
this week the general assumption seems to be that Australia will<br />
continue to have a role in regional defence including troopq<br />
stationed abroad. Is this a fair assumption?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: What I said at the press conference was<br />
that the Government had taken what I regard as significant decisions<br />
enabling the military advisers of the Government and Defence<br />
Department to plan the sort of advice that they will give us. We<br />
have told them the capabilities we would like our forces to be able<br />
to fulfil. They can then advise on the composition of the forces<br />
to fulfil those capabilities and the kind of arms which would be<br />
provided and do their planning in that way. That is one thing<br />
and the decisions needed to be taken on that. That should be<br />
distinguished from taking at this stage decisions not as to<br />
composition of the forces but as to disposition of the forces.<br />
Not as to capability of the forces but as to the deployment of<br />
the forces at some time in the future. They are two different<br />
things. QUETION: Prime Minister, ltd like to ask why it has<br />
taken Cabinet so long to reach this latest decision?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well, as you said, or as you said, sir,<br />
we were confronted with a comparatively new situation in,<br />
particularly, the aroa to our own near north. We knew, of<br />
course, that Britain was intending to withdraw but the quite<br />
significant acceleration of her withdrawal presented problems<br />
which came before us sooner than * they would otherwise have been<br />
thought to be coming before us. And this required a good deal<br />
of study and a good deal of advice and a good deal of discussion<br />
by the Defence Committee before advice came to Canberra.<br />
QUESTION: Now, your critics have attacked you<br />
because of the delay but has the Australian Government suffered<br />
or made any losses because of this delay? </p>
<p>3-<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I 4ontt believe they have. You see, we<br />
have engaged in Five Power talks as you know in the area directly<br />
to our north as to what is to happen up until the time that the<br />
British withdrawal is completed. Those talks have been going on<br />
and those countries know our views and their own views and I've<br />
already announced that in principle we propose to keep in that<br />
area forces subject to a few details being cleaned up.<br />
QUESTION: Are you aware of any strains in Australian-<br />
Malaysian or Australian-Singapore relations as a result of the<br />
delay? PRIME MINISTER: I'm not aware of any.<br />
QUESTION: We have heard reports of certainly the<br />
Singapore Government pressing your Government for a decision.<br />
Have such measures been taken?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I know of no such strains or no such<br />
pressing coming from Lee Kuan Yew to myself.<br />
QUESTION: Prime Minister, you said this week that<br />
it wasn't a choice between Fortress Australia and sticking all<br />
our troops in Asia. But didntt you start the speculation about<br />
Fortress Australia and add to it by some of your statements<br />
through the year?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I don't know when I can be quoted as<br />
having used the words Fortress Australia but with that rider<br />
let's accept what you've said. What I have been saying is that<br />
in this new situation there are a great number of possibilities,<br />
when we know when this acceleration was going to take place,<br />
there were a great number of alternate possibilities and all of<br />
them needed to be looked at. But Pbrtress Australia is not I<br />
think a phrase I've used, and the connotation of it is not one<br />
that I would support. The connotation of Fortress Australia is<br />
the idea that everybody goes back into Australia, turns their </p>
<p>back on everything outside Australia, draws a line around it and<br />
says, we're inside this line and we're not interested at all what<br />
happens outside it, we just stay here in a fortress. This is a<br />
proposition, in fact, that has been put forward by some opposition<br />
spokesmen, but that is not at all the same thing as, for example,<br />
and I'm speaking of possibilities again, the role that Britain<br />
took, say, during the Napoleonicli~ ars when she was in a sense<br />
fortress-ridden but occupied on the Continent.<br />
QUESTION: These are extremes. I think you put it<br />
this week as" blc and white!.<br />
PRI14E MINISTER: Yes.<br />
QUESTION: But I think a lot of commentators have<br />
taken it as meaning an accent on one or the other and I come back<br />
to this point that you were the person who started saying that<br />
we have to reconsider this forward defence concept and I think<br />
you wore even quoted as using the term ' Foortress Australia' at<br />
the Government Partied meeting.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well, I don't think I've ever used the<br />
term in any public meeting and I won't comment on what happens<br />
inside Party meetings. So there are a number of possibilities<br />
to be examined. I think you're not quite right to say the<br />
commentators have on the whole put an accent on one or the other.<br />
Some of them have. But I think some of them have tended to say<br />
it's either all one thing or all the other thing. And that I<br />
think was quite wrong.<br />
QUESTION: Prime Minister, do you think in fact that<br />
taking the defence situation at the beginning of the year and now<br />
as best we can read it; would you agree there's no major policy<br />
change? PRIME MINISTER: Are you talking of defence situations<br />
from the point of view of the hardware that's supplied to the<br />
forces? </p>
<p>QUESTION: No, I think basically deployment<br />
philosophy. PRIME MVINISTER: Well, the deployment of the f orces up until<br />
1971, subject to what I've said in Parliament in announcing it,<br />
is clearly a continuation of what we did before. A continuation<br />
up until the end of 1971 so in that sense there would be no need<br />
to change.<br />
QUESTION: Prime Minister,, you've said just recently<br />
that we have to face the fact that we've entered a new era and that<br />
we must build up our defences. Does that mean that we can<br />
reasonably expect that conscription will be maintained?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I think if we are to keep regular forces<br />
of the size that we should keep it will be necessary to have a<br />
form of national service in order to keep them up to that level.<br />
QUESTION: Now, another comment of yours earlier this<br />
year that may have given us a clue as to what you were feeling<br />
about that, you said that you'd like Australia to have " a<br />
citizen army ready to go at a moment's notice as the Israelis<br />
were -abl~ e to go at a moment's notice into action". Now, what<br />
did you have in mind that would be different to the sort of<br />
citizen army that we have at present?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I think what one had in mind was a better<br />
citizen army, a better equipped citizen army, a better trained<br />
citizen army, C. MF., than we have had at present. We have<br />
throughout our military history, in fact up until recently when<br />
we had greater regular forces, we have been dependent on a<br />
citizen army and calling it together in times of emergency and<br />
then training it for some time before it can go into action. One<br />
of the possibilities again and one of the things that needs to<br />
be examined is a bettering and a better-equipping and a bettertraining<br />
of the citizen army so that we don't have to have that<br />
long delay should it ever be needed. </p>
<p>6<br />
QUESTION: And a bigger C. 14. F.?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I'd like to wait for the direct military<br />
advice of our military advisers on this before I answer that.<br />
QUESTION: Is it probable that conscription or at least<br />
some form of national service would be enlarged perhaps to the<br />
point of making it universal?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I don't think that we would need to enlarge<br />
it to the point of making it universal. We did once, you know,<br />
make it universal for -a six mronthis period of training, and I<br />
think the armed forces got very little out of it and it did<br />
disrupt a whole lot of civilian activity and development of<br />
Australia. What is needod is a period of time for a national<br />
serviceman to serve which will enable him, first of all, to be<br />
properly trained and then for the armed forces to get the advantage<br />
of that training for the rest of the time during which he is<br />
serving. Now, if that wore to be applied universally, I think it<br />
would be bad for the other requirements that Australia has for<br />
its young men to build Australia.<br />
QUESTION: Could we turn quickly now, sir, to Vietnam.<br />
In June this year, at the National Press Club in fact here in<br />
Canberra, you said that the military objective of obtaining<br />
political freedom for the South Vietnamese poo~ le could be<br />
attained. Do you still believe that?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:-Well, I suppose that would depend on the<br />
outcome of the negotiations going on now in Paris. If the<br />
outcome of those negotiations is that the South Vietnamese<br />
people do get political freedom then I think it should be clear<br />
that that political freedom has been achieved only because there<br />
was military opposition to aggression.<br />
QUESTION: You've also said that the only way the<br />
war could be lost was diplomatically. Do you see dangers </p>
<p>7<br />
therefore in attempts to reach a diplomatic solution?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I see no danger in attempts to reach a<br />
diplomatic solution at all.<br />
QUESTION: The United States has taken some dramatic<br />
steps over Vietnam specifically during your term of office, hasn't<br />
it? The bombing halt for a start, and then the start of the<br />
Paris talks, and looking back over the things that have happened<br />
in the twelve months, is the Australian Government completely<br />
satisfied with American policies?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: American policies in relation to the bombing<br />
halt and the bringing about of talks in Paris?<br />
go Yes.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: We have endorsed what tho United States<br />
Government has done on both occasions. Tho first occasion was an<br />
attempt to show good faith and to bring people to a negotiating<br />
table and to seek to de-escalate the actual war as President<br />
Johnson said. This had no great success with North Vietnam.<br />
But the second decision was based on the Americans' belief that<br />
should that second decision be taken then proper peace talks would<br />
begin because there had been no proper* peace talks until that<br />
stage. All the talks were concerned with whether bombing should<br />
stop on North Vietnam. Their belief that proper peace talks<br />
would take place and that they had good reason to beliove that<br />
the scale of fighting would drop during the period of those<br />
peace talks, and they having that belief and certainly the talks<br />
having begun, we can only do as I indicated in the House myself,<br />
hope that they'll reach a successful conclusion.<br />
QUESTION: You have indicated some discontent on both<br />
those occasions though, haven't you, Prime Minister? </p>
<p>-8<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I think what I have done is to indicate<br />
that it is not certain by any means that a peaceful solution will<br />
be attained at the negotiation table merely because. people are<br />
sitting down at a negotiating table. One hopes there will. There<br />
is no certainty that it will. I mean, as I think you used at the<br />
time, injected a note of caution rather than a note of discontent.<br />
QUESTION: Did you go along with the American policy<br />
of putting pressure on the South Vietnamese Government to attend<br />
the peace talks?<br />
SPRIME MINISTER: Why, we ourselves approached the South<br />
Vietnamese and gave them our advice that we thought it was in their<br />
interest to go and that this of course was also announced in the<br />
House. QUESTION: Now, Prime Minister, weld like, if we may,<br />
0-4Ltoto turn to domestic issues. And one of the most sensitive is the<br />
question of foreign ownership of Australian resources. It's an<br />
(. I2.6area in which youtve personally intervened on a number of<br />
occasions. Why has it been necossary for you to intervene?<br />
UPRIME MINISTER: Well, the only occasion on which I intervened<br />
directly was in the case of the M. L. C. and one was able to<br />
do that because the M. L. C. was incorporated in the Australian<br />
Capital Territory, and one had a constitutional power to do it.<br />
On the other occasion of which you're thinking, I believe, that<br />
is the occasion when we asked the Stock Exchanges to continue<br />
trading in Australian company shares even though the shareholders<br />
of those companies may have sought to protect themselves against<br />
being taken over. That we believed was necessary and when I<br />
say we, the Government believed it was necessary. To prevent<br />
the sort of market raids which have been going on, on good<br />
efficient well-established companies or which was anticipated<br />
might take place on such companies. </p>
<p>9r<br />
QUESTION: I think the critics have warned, Prime<br />
Minister, that you may frighten off foreign capital. Have you<br />
had any indications from foreign investors that they could be<br />
nervous? PRIME~ MINISTER:, Well, certainly the capital inflow up until<br />
this stage from abroad has given no indication of dropping off and<br />
there are obvious reasons for that. But I think that what we<br />
need to have in our minds in discussing this are two things:<br />
first development capital, capital coming into Australia in order<br />
to develop some new industry, some now mine, in order to build.<br />
This we want and I see no indicat~ ion of nervousness. We would<br />
wish to have some Australian participation in such new development.<br />
We would not want debenture capital to be raised inside<br />
Australia for some overseas company development in Australia.<br />
That is one aspect. On the other aspect, that of taking over<br />
established Australian companies, there are, as I said yesterday,<br />
ins tanzces when this could be of advantage but there are also<br />
instances when it could be of considerable disadvantage, and we<br />
wish at this stage to try and stop it. Or try and help people<br />
stop it.<br />
QUESTION: You don't see any nervousness here for<br />
development capital; apparently Charles Court, the Liberal<br />
Minister in W. A. for Industrial Dovelopment, does. He said<br />
this week that your intervention had embarrassed the W. A.<br />
Government and had caused doubts In the minds of overseas<br />
investors. PRIME MINISTER: Ican only state my own belief and that is<br />
that overseas investors will come to Australia if they see a<br />
stable government, which they do see, and if they see a proper<br />
opportunity to profit on the funds which they are willing to<br />
invest in Australia. And those are the two things I think they<br />
make their judgement on. </p>
<p>a. 10<br />
QUESTION: Prime Minister, do you want more power-to<br />
control or curb foreign investment?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: To control or curb it. I think that it<br />
would be good if the Attorney-Generals' Committee could reach<br />
agreement on uniform legislation so that nominees who bought up<br />
more than a certain percentage of a company should have to disclose<br />
who in fact the beneficiaries were, I think that would be<br />
a good step and I suppose that would fall within the category<br />
ofgreater power to curb takeovers. I think it would beif we<br />
could work it out with the States, good to have a selective way<br />
of protecting Australian companies from being taken over and<br />
their assets dissipated and things of that kind. Yes, I think<br />
that would be good.<br />
QUESTION: And you seem to be looking for more<br />
power? PRIME MINISTER: If that's the Interpretation you put on<br />
what I've just said yes.<br />
QUESTION: Do you accept the interpretation?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:* Well,. I think I must because if you make<br />
nominees, if you want the power to make nominees disclose who<br />
the beneficiaries are, then you're asking for more power yes.<br />
QUESTION: Prime Minister, can I take you on to<br />
another sensitive domestic issue this year the financial<br />
relationship of the States with the Commonwealth. You've been<br />
accused in this dispute of being a centralist it's an<br />
accusation that you've repeatedly denied. Just how much<br />
financial power do you want your Commonwealth Government to<br />
have? PRIME MINISTER:, Well, can I go back to the genesis of this<br />
debate, on this matter, and that was a suggestion of mine </p>
<p>11<br />
p repeated in variou, place that it was time I thought the Liberal<br />
Party examined the conocept of Federalism which as a dogma it<br />
accepted some twenty-five Tears ago. Examined it and see<br />
whether they still thought it was exactly the way it should be.<br />
What I think is essential is that the central government should<br />
be able to control the general economy of Australia. That if<br />
there is too much pressure on available resources then the<br />
central government take financial measures in order to reduce the<br />
demand on those resources, that if there is not enough pressure,<br />
if there are resources and men lying unemployed, then the central<br />
government should be able to take financial action of one kind or<br />
another in order to see that those unused resources were used.<br />
SThis must be a function of the central government and I think that<br />
leads one on to the conclusion that if this is accepted then a<br />
central government must have as in fact it has had full control<br />
of the major sectors of taxation. Not only fiscal control but<br />
full control of the major sectors of taxation. And I wanted<br />
those two propositions to be thoroughly examined and for people<br />
to decide whether yes that really was the fact.<br />
QUESTION: Do you think you've convinood the Premiers<br />
U of that yet though?<br />
FFUIMIENISTER: Well, what is going to happen about that<br />
is that the Liberal Party is going to examine the whole question<br />
which at least I believo must be good. But it's not only that.<br />
I think there is also a need for a central government to see that<br />
if there is a national need, that that national need is met all<br />
throughout Australia. If I can give an example of that; if it<br />
was agreed, I think it was generally agreed, that Australia needed<br />
technicians and needed technologists for its future development,<br />
and therefore needed better technical schools and better equipment<br />
for the training of people going through them, if itta<br />
agreed that there was that need then it was reasonable for the<br />
central government to say this is a national need, we will provide </p>
<p>12<br />
Section 96 grants to see that this is met and that it is met in<br />
the same way in Queensland as it is uiet in Western Australia or<br />
New South Wales.<br />
QUESTION: Are there any particular activities<br />
perfformned by the States now which you think as the years go by<br />
will move more into areas off Federal control? Financial control?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I think that's a bit too speculative a<br />
question and...<br />
QUESTION: Well, take education for one which is<br />
something in which your Federal Government and previous<br />
Federal governments have given dollops of money'to the States.<br />
Do you think this is an area where the Commonwealth is going to<br />
take over more control of how the money is spent?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I don't believe that that is likely to<br />
happen and I'm not sure, In fact I think I would not like it to<br />
happen. But it may well be in the future, some time in the<br />
future, responsibility for providing finance for education, for<br />
providing finance for a technical school or ai secondary school<br />
or a primar-y school or teacher training or whatever it has, may<br />
come to be more off a Federal matter I don't see it in my time<br />
but it may well be. But if it did come to that then one would<br />
certainly not want to see, the finance having beon provided,<br />
some central government saying what sort off syllabus would be<br />
taught in a school and what number off teachers and where the<br />
schools would be built or any of these matter which the States<br />
could do much better.<br />
QUESTION: Prime Minister, can we look now more closely<br />
at you, at tho Gorton style. Earlier this year you said that you<br />
did not see yourself as Prime Minister as a Chairman of Committee.<br />
You said that if a Prime Minister believes strongly enough that<br />
something ought to be done then It* must be done, this was<br />
as far as Cabinet was concerned. Have you stuck to this? </p>
<p>* 13<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I think that is still what a Prime M4nister<br />
should do. But, mind you, it would only be in the most extreme<br />
ca8s that it would be necessary for a Prime Minister to put into<br />
action that particular attitude. In nine hundred and ninety-nine<br />
cases out of a thousand it would be a matter as it should be of<br />
discussion and decision by Cabinet but there could be some<br />
occasions when the Prime Minister should say thais is something I<br />
believe in very strongly, that it's got to be done, or you get<br />
someone else.<br />
QUESTION: Has such an occasion arisen this year?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No.<br />
QUESTION: Has this philosophy caused any strains or<br />
lost you any friends in Cabinet or Government?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I don't believo it has at all. In fact I<br />
think that I really do believe that our Cabinet is working as<br />
happy a team as I've ever seen one work.<br />
QUESTION: Prime Minister, on this theme of your more<br />
individualistic approach, your critics seem to imply that they<br />
want a Prime Minister who stops, looks and listens before acting,<br />
but they accuse you of sometimos stopping and looking but not<br />
listening suffIiciently. Not taking all the advice. What's<br />
your reaction?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well, my reaction, I think I can best<br />
express this way, that not only a Prime Minister but any Minister<br />
running a department should get advice, listen to it, analyse it,<br />
argue about it if they're not in agreement with it, and if having<br />
done that the Minister or the Prime Minister believes that the<br />
advice should not be taken then I think the advice should not be<br />
taken because the decision must always rest with the Minister,<br />
the Cabinet or a Prime Minister. </p>
<p>QUESTION: Yes, but the accusation is th~ t you don't<br />
listen to all this advice.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:* Well, I donft think thatte an accurate<br />
accusation. It may be put fforward by some people, I don't know,<br />
who really mean I don't take all this advice which is quite a<br />
different thing.<br />
QUESTION: I think in the case off the Esso-B. H. P. oil<br />
agreement, it appears you didn't take Dr. Frankel's advice and he<br />
was... PRIME MINISTER: Wall, Dr. Frankel was employed by the<br />
Department off National Development to make reports to the Department<br />
off National Development. The Department off National Development<br />
was on the Intordepartmental Committee which made recommendations<br />
to the Government, and they, the Interdepartmental Committee, had<br />
made recoim'ondations and indicated that there was some need for<br />
decisions on these recommendations apparently long beffore they<br />
expected to receive Dr. Frankel's advice.<br />
QUESTION: In the same area but with a diffferent twist,<br />
these same critics sometimes think you're too hasty. Do you also<br />
reject that criticism?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I don't believe I have been too hasty, I<br />
can't think off anything I've been too hasty on.<br />
QUESTION: Could I suggest for one, early in the<br />
year you suggested you would place a ceiling on our commitment<br />
off troops in Vietnam. You certainly watered this downm later.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well, I don' t think so. We have kopt . a<br />
ceiling on the troops in Vietnam.<br />
QUESTION: Yes, but you decline to reaffirm that<br />
wish. </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER: I decline to reaffirm it indefinitely that<br />
we enter the future under all sorts of unknown circuxuatancea but<br />
in fact that statement was made and that statement has been<br />
adhered to. Arid if I may say so that statement was expressing a<br />
view which had been reached by a previous government to mine and<br />
which was known abroad anyway.<br />
QUESTION: Well, what some people may call hasty others<br />
may call decisivenessargway. Do you see this, certainly this<br />
speed of reaction as part of John Gorton or just something you see<br />
a Prime Minister should do?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I don't think that there's any real<br />
advantage in speed of reaction as such, just for speed of reaction.<br />
There may bo occasions arising when speed is necessary but it's<br />
not a virtue in itself. Indeed, on the matter of entering overseas<br />
shipping which. I think is one of the most exciting things<br />
Australia's done in the course of this year, there were long<br />
discussions before the decision was finally taken by Cabinet, long<br />
discussion by Mr. McEwen, by his officials, by myself with Mr.<br />
McEwen, On the oil pricing there was long discussion in<br />
Cabinet, interdepartmental coimmittees.. and so on,<br />
QUESTION: Could I just chip in. When you talk about<br />
Cabinet taking that decision on shipping; was it true in fact<br />
that a London newspaper gave a report of that deal the same day<br />
you put it before Cabinet?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: A London newspaper correspondent gave some<br />
of the aspects of the deal. But the deal, you k. now, was not put<br />
before Cabinet as'this is a deal which has been concluded". It<br />
was put before Cabinet as" Ithis is a proposition which the<br />
shipping companies will agree to if you will agree to. Do you<br />
accept the proposition?"<br />
QUESTION: Prime Minister, you've said several times<br />
this year that you hope for a new sense of nationalism in Australia?<br />
Do you see any-signs of it? </p>
<p>* P * 16<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I think people can only make their own<br />
minds up on that and form their own judgments and their own<br />
interpretations. I believe myself, rightly or wrongly, that there<br />
is a growing feeling of cohesion and nationalism and pride in<br />
Australia amongst Australians. I ' think there is. I hope there is.<br />
I think there should be.<br />
QUESTION: Sir, one of the things that seems implicit<br />
S in some of things you h,, Ive said about nationalism i 3 that it<br />
depends heavily on how much money we get for our enormous natural<br />
~ resources, in some sense we are going to buy a national destiny.<br />
That's not what you mean perhaps is it?<br />
PRIM~ E MINISTER: That's not what I really mean at all, but<br />
nevertheless it must be true, that if we are to develop as quickly<br />
as we want to develop theni we need to get proper development capital<br />
from abroad and as that develo~ ment occurs and particularly if there<br />
is Australian participation in that development, then we will be<br />
stronger and have more opportunities to do the things we want to do<br />
which are not just material things inside Australia.<br />
. QUEST IO : Well, what about the trappings of<br />
. nationalism, Sir? You have alre. 2dy said you fancy Waltzing Matilda<br />
as the National Anthem. You didn't say this?<br />
P. RIME MINISTER: N o. I said we had a National Anthem and<br />
it was God Save the Queen, and that in a monarchy such as Australia is<br />
aL quite satisfactory National Anthem. But I did say I thought<br />
Waltzing Matilda was a ' National Song. And my personal opinion was<br />
it ought to be a ! Xational Song and I would be very happy to see.<br />
it played on such occasions, for example our atheletes winning<br />
something at the Olympic Games or something of that kind, but when<br />
the Governor-General comes or when there is any significant matter<br />
of that kind, then I think we have a National Anthem. But yet<br />

some people do not like Waltzing Matilda, but I do.<br />
QUESTION: PRIME MII-TIST. ER:<br />
QUESTION: have one of' our own? And the flag?<br />
The flag I am quite ha-ppy. 1 with.<br />
You would not want to follow Canada and<br />
PRIME MINISTER: My own belief' is that our flag stands for<br />
so much that I would not like to see it change.<br />
QUESTION: Prime Minister, you have made a relatively<br />
Sbig jump, well from a relatively junior Minister to Prime Minister.<br />
Ihiv you have had twelve months there, have you enjoyed thi~ s year<br />
of power?<br />
O PRIME MINISTER: Yes, I have enjoyed it. It has been<br />
extremely wearing~ very tiring; but subject to occasionally getting<br />
slightly exhausted, yes I have enjoyed tt I am not sure there has<br />
ever been another period when quite so many new things have<br />
* happened; either from abroad. or instigated within Australia perhaps<br />
by ourselves.<br />
. QUESTION: Prime Minister, if you had to single out<br />
one particular achievement this year, that you would take the<br />
greatest pride in, which one would it be?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
QUESTION: Can I single out two?<br />
All right.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well the one I would put down as the<br />
beginnings of' the entry of' Australia into carrying our own produce<br />
in our own ships. We are leasing a couple of' the ships but in fact<br />
we are manning them and controlling them. This I think is the<br />
beginming-of something which I believe will grow and will be great<br />
for Australia. </p>

-QUE ST ION: Can I just butt in there? Isn'tt that<br />
just a little bit adrift from normal Liberal philosophy to move<br />
into an area of what some might see as socialism like that?<br />
PRIME ]~ ISTEP: W'ell I think it depends on how you<br />
interpret normal Liberal philosophy because after all, for a long,<br />
long time the Liberals have been supporting a two airline policy,<br />
twhich involves the running of airlines in competition and this<br />
involves the running of ships in competition. I have never heard<br />
* a Liberal urging that railways for example should be returned to<br />
private enterprise, so no, I don't think it is.<br />
The other thing that I am rather happy<br />
about is that we have lifted the fear, I believe, from people who<br />
might contract a long continued illness and who previously, even<br />
though they were insured, would only be insured for a short period<br />
of time but now will be insured for as long ~ as the illness continues.<br />
Those are two things, there are a number of others that I am happy<br />
Labout, but you only rationed me to two.<br />
QUDSTION: Prime Minister, thank you very much indeed<br />
Sfor giving us your time. </p>
