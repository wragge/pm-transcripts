FOR MEDIA 7 MAY 1982<br />
APPOINTMENT OF ACTING PEP4ANENT<br />
HEADS TO NEW DEPARTMENTS<br />
The administrative changes I have anncunced will require<br />
changes in Permanent Heads appointments, either because<br />
new departments are being created or because there are<br />
substantial changes in the functions of existing<br />
departments. Until the provisions of the Public Service<br />
Act relating to the appoint-ment of Permanent Heads can<br />
be properly complied with which I would expect would<br />
be in a week or so the following acting appointments<br />
will be made:<br />
Mr Currie will be Actinz Secretary, Department<br />
of Industry and Commerce and Acting<br />
Comptroller-General of Customs<br />
Mr Halton will be Actinc Secretary, Department<br />
of Transport and Construction and Acting<br />
Director-General of Works<br />
Mr Freeland will be Acting Secretary,<br />
Department of Aviation<br />
Mr Taylor will be Acting Secretary, Department<br />
of Defence Support<br />
Mr Codd will be Acting Secretary, Department<br />
of L mployment and Industrial Relations.<br />
Mr Hayes, Secretary of the former Department of Business<br />
and Consumer Affairs will, for the tir. e being, undertake<br />
special duties. oco-</p>
