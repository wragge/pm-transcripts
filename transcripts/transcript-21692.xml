    <content><![CDATA[<p>I will visit China, Japan, Turkey and Greece from 18 to 29 April.</p>
<p> During my visit to Beijing from 18 to 19 April I will meet senior Chinese leaders, President Hu Jintao, Premier Wen Jiabao and National People's Congress Chairman,Wu Bangguo.  Australia and China have strong economic complementarities which have seen bilateral trade grow at over 20 per cent per annum over recent years.  Total two-way trade is now valued at over $30 billion.  My visit presents a valuable opportunity to reaffirm the importance the Australian Government attaches to strengthening the bilateral relationship.  I hope to discuss further with China's leaders the possibility of a Free Trade Agreement.  I will also speak at a luncheon hosted by the Australian Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<p>My attendance at the Boao Forum for Asia from 22 to 24 April will be an opportunity for discussions with senior Chinese and regional policy makers on the challenges and strategic economic outlook for Asia and the Pacific region. I will deliver a key note address at the opening of the Forum, and reinforce the need for continued focus on energy issues. I will also speak at a special session on the Australia-China energy partnership.</p>
<p>I will visit Japan from 20 to 21 April and meet with a range of Japanese political and business leaders, including my counterpart Prime Minister Koizumi, and Minister for Economy, Trade and Industry, Shoichi Nakagawa and senior business figures.  I will reaffirm the longstanding strength and future potential of the bilateral relationship which has broadened and deepened over recent years.  Australia welcomes Japan's greater sharing of the burden in maintaining international and regional security, and we will be working closely in coordination on the deployment of Australian troops in the Al Muthanna province in Iraq. My discussions with Prime Minister Koizumi will seek to encourage further growth in trade and investment.  I will also attend celebrations of Australia's national day at the Aichi World Expo.  This event is an excellent opportunity to showcase our nation as a leader in business, tourism, arts and education.  The Australian Government contributed $35 million to mount Australia's presence at Expo and generous sponsorships have added a further $4.5 million.</p>
<p>I will visit Turkey from 24 to 27 April and attend the Dawn Service at ANZAC Cove on ANZAC Day, marking the 90th anniversary of the landings at Gallipoli.  During a special ceremony later that day I will confer an honorary Medal of the Order of Australia on Mr Erol Baycan for his work in preserving war cemeteries on the Gallipoli peninsula.</p>
<p>My visit to Turkey will also provide the opportunity to meet with Prime Minister Erdogan.  These talks will allow me to express the continuing deep appreciation of the Australian people for Turkey's stewardship of the ANZAC area and to exchange views on a range of issues of mutual interest, including the current situation in the Middle East, progress in the international fight against terrorism and ongoing cooperation on ANZAC related issues.</p>
<p>  During my visit to Greece from 27 to 28 April, I will build on the already close ties that exist between our two countries. I will meet with the Prime Minister of Greece Costas Karamanlis and President Karolos Papoulias.  In discussions with Prime Minister Karamanlis, I intend highlighting international and regional issues of mutual importance and ways to strengthen our bilateral relationship, including increasing trade and investment.  While in Athens I will also chair a meeting of the International Democrat Union.  </p>
