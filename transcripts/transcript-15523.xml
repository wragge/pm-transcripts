    <content><![CDATA[<p>Storms in Victoria and rising flood waters in the Gippsland region of the state have resulted in a fatality and widespread property damage.  I extend my sympathies to the family and friends of the man who lost his life after a tree crushed his Mount Macedon home.</p>
<p>Given the extensive damage, I have authorised Commonwealth support in the form of cash payments to people who have suffered serious injury, or lost their principal place of residence or had that residence rendered uninhabitable for a period of 48 hours as a direct result of this disaster. </p>
<p>This will be over and above the support being provided by the Australian Government under the long standing Natural Disaster Relief and Recovery Arrangements. Through the NDRRA, the Commonwealth assists the states with the costs and resourcing of response and recovery operations in large scale disasters. </p>
<p>The additional relief will amount to $1,000 per eligible adult and $400 per eligible child. People who are entitled to this additional assistance will now be able to apply to Centrelink on 180 2211. </p>
<p>I am committed to working with the Victorian Premier, Mr Steve Bracks to support the ongoing relief and recovery effort with additional Commonwealth assistance if needed. </p>
<p>On behalf of the Government I extend my gratitude and thanks to the all those involved in the emergency response.</p>
