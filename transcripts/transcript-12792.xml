The passing of Alec Campbell marks an important moment in the history of our nation.<br />
Alec Campbell was the last known survivor of the Gallipoli campaign, not just in Australia but anywhere in the world.<br />
He was the last living link to that group of Australians that established the ANZAC  legend.<br />
Alec Campbell was 103.<br />
Of all the traditions that Australians hold dear, none is held more dearly than the ANZAC tradition.  It is a story of great valour under fire, unity of purpose and a willingness to fight against the odds that has helped to define what it means to be an Australian.</p>
<p>Alec Campbell was typical of a generation of Australians who, through their sacrifice, bravery and decency, created a legacy that has resonated through subsequent decades and generations.<br />
He enlisted in June 1915 at the age of 16, serving on the Gallipoli peninsula in November and December 1915 with the 15th Battalion.<br />
I had the honour of meeting Alec Campbell on several occasions.  In April 2000 he was honoured at a ceremony at the Australian War Memorial, handing over a flag that I had the privilege of taking to Gallipoli commemorations that year.<br />
On behalf of the nation I express my condolences to his family and my great respect and admiration for the service that he gave and the legend that he helped to create.  As a mark of a grateful nation a state funeral will be offered to his family.</p>
