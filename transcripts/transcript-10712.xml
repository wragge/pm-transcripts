    <content><![CDATA[<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, your concessions to SOCOG re the GST and the Olympics</p>
<p>   - do you think the News South Wales Government should embrace what</p>
<p>   you've had to offer?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, what we've had to offer is a very reasonable thing and</p>
<p>   it will greatly benefit Australians who are going to the Olympic</p>
<p>   Games. I want the New South Wales Government to work with us. We</p>
<p>   want to work with them. We want to make the Games successful. And</p>
<p>   we've made a very reasonable offer and I'm hopeful that</p>
<p>   Mr Carr will see that. And that when we meet some time in the next</p>
<p>   two or three weeks all the outstanding loose ends can be tied up</p>
<p>   and the impression again will be there that people are working together</p>
<p>   to make these Games an outstanding success.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>But since the government hasn't signed the MOU does that make</p>
<p>   you question their commitment?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Look, I'm an optimist. I come to this whole thing with a very</p>
<p>   positive frame of mind. The Australian community wants any suggestion</p>
<p>   that bickering over the Games to end. That's been my view for</p>
<p>   a long time. We've made a very reasonable offer and I am sure,</p>
<p>   in the same spirit of reasonableness, the New South Wales Government</p>
<p>   and SOCOG will agree to the conditions attached to our offer.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>And it's the last offer, no more concessions?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh look, I don't use language like that in something where</p>
<p>   the national reputation of Australia is at stake.</p>
<p> [ends] </p>
<p>  k, I don't use language like that in something where</p>
<p>   the national reputation of Australia is at stake.</p>
<p> [ends] </p>
