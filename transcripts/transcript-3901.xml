STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
J. T. LANG<br />
J. T. Lang's great achievement was to create new<br />
opportunities for the people of New South Wales and by<br />
example for all Australians. His first Government, half<br />
a century ago, pioneered new forms of social welfare for<br />
Australia, notably compulsory workers' compensation and<br />
child endowment. That Government laid the foundations of<br />
modern Sydney as an integrated community from the north<br />
to the west. It achieved electrification of the railways,<br />
the underground, a harbour bridge and the new Parramatta<br />
road. So in a very real sense he was the founder of<br />
modern Sydney.<br />
