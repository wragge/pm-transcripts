PRIME MINISTER PRESS STATEMENT NO. 461<br />
7 MARCH 1975<br />
JOINT STATEMENT BY PRIME MINISTER AND TASMANIAN PREMIER<br />
( Following their meeting in Canberra on Thursday night<br />
6 March 1975)<br />
The following joint statement was made by<br />
the Australian Prime Minister, the Hon. E. G. Whitlam,<br />
and the Premier of Tasmania, the Hon.<br />
E. E. Reece, following a meeting in Parliament<br />
House last night to discuss matters arising out of the<br />
collapse of the Tasman Bridge in Hobart..<br />
" The immediate problem arisir~ g from the<br />
collapse of the Tasman Bridge is to restore as quickly<br />
as possible means of communication between the<br />
Eastern Shore and the main part of the city on the west<br />
of the Derwent River, leaving questions of liability and<br />
financial responsibility to be sorted out later.<br />
This problem can be seen in two parts.<br />
The first is to make temporary and shorterterm<br />
arrangements to keep passenger and vehicular traffic<br />
flowing between the two parts of the city. This task has<br />
been tackled energetically by the State and Australian<br />
Government agencies concerned. Further efforts in this<br />
direction are receiving top priority and are being<br />
intensified. The second and necessarily longer-term part of<br />
the problem is to restore the original Bridge to a<br />
satisfactory trafficable condition. This is a very big<br />
task from an engineering point of view. It is, nevertheless,<br />
the best way of restoring the position in the medium term.<br />
The building of a second bridge of a permanent type at another<br />
location will, in due course, make its contribution to<br />
the increase of traffic between the two sides of the Derwent.<br />
It must be appreciated, however, that the design and<br />
building-of a second crossing will inevitably take longer<br />
than will the repair of the existing Bridge. till, F </p>
<p>We have, therefore, concentrated our<br />
immediate attention at this meeting on how to organise<br />
the clearing of the river-bed in the near vicinity of<br />
the Bridge, with the object of enabling the engineers to<br />
decide finally how best to repair the existing structure<br />
and support the new spans to bridge the present gap and<br />
then to get the reconstruction job going.<br />
To overcome the problems of divided control<br />
and divided responsibility we have agreed to support<br />
the establishment of a Special Joint Commission to<br />
superintend and direct the combined salvage and rebuilding<br />
operation. This will be done through an inter-governmental<br />
Agreement, the mnain points of which we have already<br />
accepted, and this Agreement will, in due course, be<br />
submitted to the Australian and State Parliaments<br />
for their approval. In the meantime we will proceed at once with<br />
the nomination of the Commissioners, and will ask them<br />
to act as an Interim Commission pending the creation<br />
of the substantive body. They will commence their work<br />
immediately upon appointment and will be given wide<br />
powers of decision. The Chief Commissioner will be jointly appointed<br />
by and be responsible to the Prime Minister and Premier.<br />
One Associate Commissioner will be appointed by the<br />
Australian Prime Minister and another by the Premier of<br />
Tasmania. Each of the Commissioners will be highly<br />
qualified in engineering and experienced in large-scale<br />
construction projects. The Commission will have as its<br />
Chief Executive Officer the Tasmanian Director of Public<br />
Works and the Commission will be able to borrow or<br />
recruit appropriate skilled staff as required.<br />
We are happy to be able to announce that Sir<br />
Allan Walton Knight, the Present Chairman of the<br />
Tasmanian Hydro-Electric Commission, has accepted our<br />
invitation to act as Chief Commissioner. Sir Allan is<br />
Widely known throughout Tasmania, and indeed in engineering<br />
circles throughout the world, as a great engineer and<br />
administrator. The names of the two Assistant Commissioners<br />
will shortly be announced, as will the details of the<br />
proposed Agreement between the Australian and Tasmanian<br />
Governments </p>
<p>We express our great admiration for the<br />
work already done in trying to cope with this very difficult<br />
situation by the numerous Commonwealth and State departments<br />
and agencies concerned. Naturally a lot of this work is not<br />
fully seen nor readily appreciated by those adversely<br />
affected by the accident. Nevertheless, the efforts made<br />
have been quite outstanding. Great credit is due to<br />
all who have helped in the initial reaction to the disaster.<br />
We emphasise that the salvage and engineering<br />
problems involved in restoring the Bridge are most<br />
severe. The sulken ship lies in very deep water, and the<br />
river-bed is overlain by a thick layer of mud which no<br />
diver can penetrate. Visability is extremely limited and<br />
strong currents make the work difficult and hazardous.<br />
Much of the visible debris and parts of the ship have to<br />
be removed, and the area probed to locate any invisible<br />
obstructions to new supporting structures, before the<br />
final reconstruction plan can be determined and new supports<br />
built. In the meantime, and with all possible speed,<br />
preparatory work will go on while the underwater site<br />
is being cleared." The Prime Minister and the Premier expressed<br />
their appreciation of the efforts of Sir Roland Wilson,<br />
who had assessed the situation on behalf of the<br />
Prime Minister, conceived the notion of a Bridge Commission<br />
and prepared the comprehensive agreement which was<br />
signed today. Sir Roland, they said, would continue to<br />
act as special adviser to the Prime Minister in respect<br />
of the Tasman Bridge and would consider and advise on<br />
all of the consequences of the bridge disaster. </p>
