    <content><![CDATA[<p>On the fortieth anniversary of Cyclone Tracy, Australians remember the devastation of the disaster and the determination of the people of Darwin to rebuild their city.</p>
<p>On Christmas Day 1974, Darwin was flattened by Cyclone Tracy.</p>
<p>It was a natural disaster almost without equal.</p>
<p>Sixty-six lives were lost. Three-quarters of the city’s homes were destroyed. Thousands of people were evacuated.</p>
<p>Darwin had to start again.</p>
<p>Cyclone Tracy demonstrated that when nature is at its worst, Australians are at their best.</p>
<p>We remember with pride all who evacuated the city and those who undertook the greatest airlift in our history.</p>
<p>The members of the Australian Defence Force have a special connection to Darwin and it is right that we honour their tireless efforts.</p>
<p>The lesson of Cyclone Tracy is that a determined people can rebuild and become stronger than before.</p>
<p>In 1974, Darwin’s population was 48,000 and today it is over 130,000. Darwin is our gateway to Asia and is one of Australia’s great energy hubs.</p>
<p>Four decades on, we remember the courage of all who responded to Cyclone Tracy as well as the determination, resilience and strength required to rebuild.</p>
