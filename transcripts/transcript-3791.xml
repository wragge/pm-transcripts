PRIME MMI4STER Press Statement No. 521<br />
June 1975<br />
TRANSFER OF TASMANIAN GOVERNMENT RAILWAYS<br />
TO AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT<br />
( Joint statement by the Prime Minister the Honourable<br />
E. G. Whitlam., Q. C. and the Pr~ mier of Tasmania,<br />
the Honourable W. A. Neilson, M. H. A.)<br />
The Prime Minister, Mr Whitlam. and the Tasmanian<br />
Premier Mr Neilson announced today that they had signed a.<br />
certificate required to bring into force the transfer of<br />
the Tasmanian Railways to the Australian Government on<br />
1 July 1975. " The transfer of the Tasmanian Railways represents<br />
the first step in the achievement of a truly national<br />
railway system", the Prime Minister and Premier said.<br />
" In 1972 the Australian Government offered to accept<br />
responsibility for State Railway systems which represent<br />
a major problem to all State budgets. The agreement reached<br />
on the transfer of the Tasmanian Railways will confer major<br />
benefits to Tasmania", the Prime Minister and Premier said.<br />
" Apart from the obvious benefits to the Tasmanian<br />
budgetary situation the arrangements entered into also provide<br />
for the Railway system to be rehabilitated. A program of<br />
railway upgrading will be undertaken to ensure that the railways<br />
play their proper role in providing efficient transport in<br />
Tasmania." " The arrangements provide for Tasmania to receive<br />
million this financial year as a first contribution in<br />
consideration for land, minerals and other assets. An amount<br />
of # 3.3 million is to be added to the " base" level of financial<br />
assistance for future years. In addition, the State will be<br />
relieved of capital debts standing against the railways, as<br />
agreed between the Australian and Tasmanian Governments."<br />
" The transfer of the Tasmanian railways will not only<br />
benefit Tasmanians but Australia as a whole for it will enable<br />
greater co-ordination of transport particularly sea and rail<br />
and make more-economic use of Australia's transport resources." / 2 </p>

The Prime Minister and Premier concluded by saying<br />
that it was intended that the Regional office of ANR<br />
in Tasmania will be located in Launceston, the major centre<br />
of the State's railway operations.<br />
