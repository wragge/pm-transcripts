Thank you very much, Ita ( Buttrosc), Annita and I are delighted to be here. We have seen<br />
the film, so the pleasure you had here tonight we had a littlc earlier about a week ago.<br />
And In fact my whole family saw the film and T must say they loved it, all of them.<br />
There are a lot of peoplc to be congratulated the producers, the actors, the director, the<br />
choreographer. I think it is going to havc a marvellous reception and Strictly Ballroom<br />
deserves It for the faith that everyone has had in it., right from its conception.<br />
It's a light hearted film, but of course it springs from deep traditions of Australia which<br />
those who arc old enough to remember would remember. And there's a few of us around<br />
here tonight.<br />
It comes from that old music and dancing tradition of Sydney. And therc was a namesake<br />
of mine called Jack Keating who used to run a ballroom studio in Newtown. Some of you<br />
herc won't remember it. He was really an institution. And whencver you walked in there<br />
it was always thc same sort of hail with thc same sort of trusses across the ceiling, the<br />
same sort of posters on the wall, and the steps and the rest. And old Jack would sidlc up to<br />
you to see what you were made of and you'd do a couple of things, and if you weren't any<br />
good he'd just dismiss you quietly, and if you showed any promise he'd follow you for<br />
five minutes and he would then turn one of his trusted former pupils onto you and they'd<br />
take you on to learn dances.<br />
And T can see a lot of Jack Keating in Barry Fife. The only thing is when Jack was going<br />
he had receding hair, where Barry had a very bad rug on. And Bill reckons he's still got it<br />
on. I think the way rm going, I'm going to need it. But the thing was, I think it came<br />
from that old tradition, and as a rcfugee myself from many a ballroom dancing show, the<br />
scrublands at Marrickvlle, or over at the HurStville Civic Centre where a couple of<br />
thousand would line up every Saturday night with the girls on one side and the boys on<br />
the other, everyone eyeing each other off, not knowing whether one would cross the </p>

2<br />
divide and actually ask the question, and often get a refusal. All of that was in the great<br />
tradition of ballroom dancing. And the great competitions that my own father and mnother<br />
were ballroom dancers and comnpctitors at these various things the Trocadcro, the onc at<br />
the Sydney Showground that's the Harden Pavilion now, and at various othcr places where<br />
It was all done, the old Calais, and all the various spots around Sydney. And it came from<br />
that tradition.<br />
And what I think is wonderful, that wc had that supported by a family which has a great<br />
tradition in Australian entertainment and radio, the Albert family. But it also camne from<br />
NIDA which was another payoff for that long teiiin-vestxnent In the nation's cultural<br />
devclopment. And I think the same can be said of the Sydney Dance Company, with that<br />
brilliant performance by Paul Mccurio and Tara Morice, which of course has sprung again<br />
from the equally brilliant Graham Murphy and his Company. And other Australian<br />
cultural institutions like the Sydney Thcatrc Company, thc Film Finance Corporation, who<br />
benefited again in the Budget last night well if you don't gct a clap for $ 60 million,<br />
you're ncvcr going to get one. T'he Australian Film Institute, the New South Wales Film<br />
and Television Offie.<br />
So therc are many Institutions involved in this. The real heart of Australia is involved<br />
here. And the concept is a peculiarly Australian thing, and it's great to revive that sort of<br />
thing In this year 1992, when not so long ago it was all the vogue. But as we all know,<br />
ballroom dancing has come back, I won't say it has come back into its own because I don't<br />
think It has, but it is coming back as a form of dance, and it's obviously attracting many<br />
peoplc again.<br />
it's a lovely film, a happy film, and a lovely ending, a nice happy ending. The nasty old<br />
bugger who was running the show ended up being sidelined, and Mum and Dad, Dad<br />
came good at thc cnd, and Mum, you could have chokcd her couldn't you? But in the end<br />
be picked hcr up, she decided to bc in it as well, which is a really quite a marvellous thing.<br />
But it's a sweet, sweet show. It's also of course a charity event tonight. And I do need to<br />
say the AIDS Trust in Australia, M A Film Corporation and Ronin Films, thank y'ou for<br />
organising this evcnt. Just as we congratulate those people who made the film, we also<br />
would like to give credit and thanks to those whosc efforts helped so much to restrict the<br />
spread of AIDS in Australia. The Bobby Goldsmith Foundation, to whom the funds from<br />
this event will go, is one I want to pay tribute to.<br />
I also mean those In thc gay community where ALD_$ jemnains largely confined, who, in<br />
the midst of the tragedy, have worked hard to provide education and support, the<br />
Government has been in there helping them. I would like to pay tributc tonight to those<br />
people from the scientife and medical professions and other walks of life who have given<br />
so much time and skill to deal with the complex scientific, social and legal issues which<br />
the epidemic has raised. </p>
<p>TEL: 3<br />
I might also take the opportunity to thank those on both sides of politics who have set<br />
aside differences to deal constructively with the threat of AIDS.<br />
We've done well in Australia, I think, to contain it and better in fact indecd than In most<br />
countries. I know that's very small comfort for those who have lost friends and relatives,<br />
and for those who are suffering from the disease. I doubt if there's anyone here whose<br />
lives have not In some way been affccted by AIDS. Of course, with It the nation's life has<br />
also been affected. We've lost some of our best people.<br />
And tonight I think Is the best possible response-the celebration of an artistic triumph, as<br />
a way of helping the ight to deal with AIDS.<br />
So this is quite an event. It's always an event in Australia to produce a feature film which<br />
has that peculiarly Australian quality to it, and at the same time Is commercial and<br />
attractive and successful, and restoring, bringing ou~ some of the old Australia while we're<br />
doing It, entertaining ourselves with the work of an enthusiastic cast, producers, director,<br />
and backers, and while wc do, help in one of the worthier causes of the nation, fighting<br />
this terrible epidemic.<br />
So congra ul at ions to everyone involved. Thank you very much for having me along.<br />
Arinita and I loved thc film, so did our kids, and I hope it's a huge success for everybody<br />
involved. T2EL0:. Rug. 92 18: 33 No. 018 P. 03/( </p>
