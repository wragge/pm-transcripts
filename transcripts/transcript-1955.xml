GREENSBOROUGH LIBERAL PARTY BRANCH LUNCHEON<br />
BUNDOORA, Victoria NOVEMBER 1968<br />
Speech by the Prime Minister, Mr John Gorton<br />
Mr Chairman, Mr Jarman, newly-selected candidate for this electorate<br />
and Ladies and Gentlemen: The real purpose of my coming here today was to have<br />
an opportunity to meet as many of you individually as possible. It was not<br />
to make a long and involved speech, particularly since most of you are<br />
standing up, and long and involved speeches under those circumstances are<br />
not always received with the greatest bonhomie.<br />
But there are some things that I would like to say to<br />
you sketchily as they must be said at this time and in these circumstancesjust<br />
roughing out some of the beliefs I think you have " 4nd I know we have as<br />
to how this country should be run and as to what is possJL.'.-1 for this country<br />
to attain if it is properly run.<br />
I want to take you back not all of you because we have<br />
so many young Liberals here who at the time were not old enough to be<br />
involved but those of you who remember, I want to take you back to the<br />
time when this Liberal Party first became the Government of Australia<br />
under Sir Robert Menzies. The nation for some time had been suffering controls<br />
of various kinds which appeared to be imposed for no other reason than a<br />
liking for having controls. The nation had been informed that if we attained<br />
the stage where four or five per cent of unemployment was reached, then<br />
that was the optimum that any nation could expect to have, and that was to<br />
all intents and purposes full employment.<br />
We had suffered under an approach which basically,<br />
philosophically held the view that the individual really existed mainly for<br />
the purpose of serving the state, rather than, as is the proper approach,<br />
the state existed to serve the individual. We believe the state should gi e<br />
the individual the greatest possible chance of developing his own personality,<br />
of taking his own risks, of reaping the rewards if his judgment is sound, or<br />
of accepting the consequences if his judgment is bad tc. d the risks turn out<br />
to have been badly based. So we turned our backs on restrictive philosophies and<br />
on the idea that controls were the answer and that such things as price<br />
control, which in effect meant profit control, should be introduced. We had<br />
seen and experienced that profit control meant that if somebody had some<br />
new idea, some new approach and they produced something better than had<br />
previously been produced at a cheaper price but at a greater profit, then a<br />
control would be introduced to see that the benefit from that did not flow to<br />
the man who had those ideas. This we felt and you felt stopped the growth<br />
of a great nation. And so you got together. People came out and asked you<br />
to get together. You got together here and throughout Australia, and you<br />
changed that approach. You changed that type of government, and as a result<br />
over the nearly two decades since then, the growth of this country has been<br />
unparalleled and the opportunities for individuals in this country have never<br />
been greater. / 2 </p>
<p>-2<br />
That is the basis on which Sir Robert Menzies built, on<br />
which Harold Holt built, and on which, given the opportunity, 1, and the team<br />
behind me, will continue to build.<br />
Today, perhaps, the tasks and the problems of applying<br />
this kind of philosophy are different and more pressing than they have been<br />
before in our history, for we live indeed in times of great and basic change.<br />
Up until some very few years ago, we in Australia took little heed of what<br />
was required for the defence of our own country. We lived under the<br />
protection of Britain and the British Navy and then we lived under the added<br />
protection of the United States alliance.<br />
When wars broke out, as they did in 1914-18 or 1939 or<br />
in Korea, we were not found wanting. We sent our contingents, we made our<br />
sacrifices, but in the years between we did little and had no need to do much<br />
in this field. That has changed, with the United Kingdom pulling back from<br />
East of Suez, with no definition with any finite approach as to under what<br />
circumstances and how they might return from West of Suez, with whatever<br />
judgment and assessment one cares to make as to the particular involvement<br />
the United States might have in the future in Asia.<br />
With these things, we have entered a new period in<br />
Australia's history, a time of change, a need to contribute constantly to<br />
our own defence, more than I personally like to contribute because I have<br />
always in my mind the knowledge of what could be done with what must be put<br />
into this defence expenditure. But I have also in my mind, and your<br />
Government and its supporters have in their mind that in this time of change<br />
we must keep up the enormous expansion of resources for our own defence<br />
as an insurance policy, and if we are with some measure of safety to own<br />
what we have and progress in the way that is possible. I<br />
There are great problems and difficulties here. It is<br />
a time of change and that is the first great sign of it I would put before you.<br />
But then we have a better and a happier one in a way,<br />
a time of change in the developmental tempo of this country.<br />
Up until about five or six years ago, development was<br />
going on, yes. It was going on gradually, fairly quietly, and suddenly like<br />
Spring, we busted out all over oil was found in Bass Strait, Hamersley<br />
was developed, manganese was mined in the North, and new industries in<br />
woodchips were developed, and hundreds of millions and thousands of<br />
millions of capital for development was required. This has reached a rate<br />
of growth, a geometrical progression, which again is a sign of a time of<br />
change. It shows, should it be maintained, as I am sure it will be, tha;<br />
we will, in thirty years and thirty years is not very long not be a nation<br />
of twelve million, but be a nation of twenty-eight million. We will be a<br />
nation with a greater industrial potential with the door to the future open<br />
and the future to which that door is open being almost illimitable.<br />
As we accept this time of change and as we take in all<br />
the people we can and as we take in all the capital we need and we need<br />
it we must take that in having regard to our own interests as well. We<br />
must seek to see that in development there is some reservation to Australians<br />
who are prepared to take the initial risk of equity capital in development,<br />
seek to see that if capital is raised inside this country, as distinct from<br />
being brought from outside, then those who contribute that capital in this<br />
country in some way or another should get the benefit of that part of the<br />
ownership to which their capital entitles them. d </p>
<p>-3<br />
This again is a new era of change, but a happy one, a<br />
good one, one that we can look forward to with pride. It does, of course,<br />
bring in its train problems, and you all know what the problems are becailse<br />
what we need here and throughout Australia are more schools, more technical<br />
schools, better roads, better communications you name it, we need it.<br />
But these are problems of growth, these are problems arising from growth<br />
and not from stagnation. This in itself, although at the moment it is difficult<br />
because the manpower we have and the resources we have are fully committed,<br />
at least it is a symptom of optimism, and the problems we must face are<br />
problems raised through our burgeoning growth and not problems through<br />
stagnation. You mentioned one other indication of change, I think,<br />
Mr. Jarman. There is, I believe, growing up in this nation now, and there<br />
will be fostered in this nation now a more conscious approach to seeking to<br />
see that those who are sick, that those who are ill, that, those who are old,<br />
that those who have had little chance to provide for themselves are given by<br />
the community at least a minimum frugal standard of living when they suffer<br />
from the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune. And I believe it is desired<br />
that this be done without a broad hand -out by the government from your pockets<br />
to all concerned, but rather that it is steered to the akeas wlere the need is<br />
greatest to provide the standard required. This is a sign of a change in<br />
attitude. I won't go on. Those things mentioned are just some of<br />
the new problems that we in this country, with your backing, have got to face<br />
and have got to overcome. May I conclude by saying this that over and<br />
above our pride in living in Greensborough, or our pride in living in Melbourne<br />
or our pride in living in Victoria, the nation requires that aid of us feel a<br />
pride in being Australians contributing to the development of a nation, no<br />
matter in what part of the nation that development takes place. Because<br />
wherever it takes place, all of us benefit, all of us grow, all of us can<br />
feel we are giving something towards the future, something towards a better<br />
country for our children, who, wherever they go in the world, will say with<br />
pride and fire in their heart: " I am an Australian.<br />
And if we do that, as I think we will, and at the same<br />
time see to it that not only the material advancement I have spokeni of occurs,<br />
not only that the development and defence needs are met, but also, over and<br />
above everything that the individual in this nation is given the opportunity to<br />
develop his own resources to the utmost, then we will have before us a<br />
shining future. That is why I am so glad to meet today so many people who<br />
will be contributing to it.<br />
Thank you. </p>
