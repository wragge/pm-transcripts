PRIME MINISTER<br />
CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY EMRARGOED UNTIL-DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
COMMISSIONING OF ERICSSON'S AUTOMATED PRODUCTION PLANT<br />
BROADMEADOWS 14 JUNE 1990<br />
From time to time, there comes an event that captures in one<br />
moment the aspirations and hard work of many people over<br />
many years. The commissioning today of this sophisticated<br />
production facility by Ericsson Australia is one such event.<br />
It encapsulates in freeze-frame many of the critically<br />
important changes underway today in Australia changes that<br />
have been sought and envisioned by policy makers in Canberra<br />
since 1983, and changes that are increasingly being<br />
implemented by employers, investors and trade unionists<br />
throughout the national economy.<br />
It know it's traditional for speakers such as me, at<br />
occasions such as this, to express the formal sentiments of<br />
pleasure at being here. But I hope you will understand that<br />
on this occasion, I do indeed feel a great deal of pleasure,<br />
not to mention satisfaction, pride and encouragement, at<br />
what we are witnessing here.<br />
It's an achievement in its own right for Ericsson Australia<br />
to expand its operations in this way.<br />
I'm told by Ericsson's that a robotic cell is a so-called<br />
clever system in that it learns from its mistakes and<br />
automatically takes measures to correct them.<br />
That might be quite handy in politics. In fact it might be<br />
even useful in the media.<br />
I mean to convey a serious point. We are all familiar with<br />
that perhaps traditional and understandable media tendency<br />
to focus on shortcomings in Australian industry. When there<br />
is a strike, a delay or a missed opportunity, you can be<br />
sure that's news. But when something positive is done, when<br />
an Australian firm or union gets it right, when we kick a<br />
goal in a tough international environment, that's rarely<br />
seen as news.<br />
Today Ericsson really is kicking a goal. It newsworthy,<br />
and I hope we read and hear about in the news media. </p>
<p>2.<br />
This robotic cell, in a new plant for the production of<br />
public telephone exchange equipment, confirms Ericsson's<br />
status as a world class producer of telecommunications<br />
equipment, and positions it well for the successful further<br />
expansion of its role in Australia, in our region and<br />
beyond. In all these regards Ericsson's individual achievement is<br />
very accurately to be considered an achievement for the<br />
economy and the nation as a whole.<br />
Because what this robotic cell stands for is years of<br />
research, extensive training, substantial and continuing new<br />
investment, and significant new export potential, in an<br />
industry that is at the cutting edge of new technology.<br />
In other words, it symbolises Australia's emerging identity<br />
as ' the clever country' not content to rely simply on the<br />
bounty of our agricultural and mineral wealth but eager to<br />
diversify our skills and capacities. It is only by becoming<br />
a truly capable player in the world economy a vigorous<br />
exporter of a broad range of products, a confident producer<br />
of sophisticated technologies, a reliable trading partner<br />
and joint venturer that living standards in this country<br />
will be underpinned and enhanced.<br />
From the Government's point of view, developing this kind of<br />
competitiveness and diversity has been the central thrust of<br />
our activity since 1983. In a rapidly changing and<br />
increasingly competitive global environment, we have<br />
provided the lead, through our international diplomacy and<br />
our domestic budgetary decisions, and not least, through our<br />
plans for the reform of the micro-economy.<br />
I've made it clear that in the telecommunications industry,<br />
what we should be trying to ensure is that we get the most<br />
effective service. I'm not wedded to any particular solution<br />
or formula; and I've said that we will not allow any vested<br />
interest to dictate the terms of the final decision we take.<br />
The only criteria can be effectiveness; and that means we<br />
need to look at options that would increase competition in<br />
this area.<br />
The success of the Government's endeavours since 1983 in<br />
creating a positive environment for the growth and<br />
diversification of the Australian economy has relied<br />
ultimately on winning the co-operation of others.<br />
It is up to individual decision makers to respond: to find<br />
new export markets, to invest in new capital, to formulate<br />
more efficient award structures and to develop and<br />
implement new technologies.<br />
So that is why this event today in Broadmeadows has truly<br />
national significance.<br />
Indeed, perhaps the most-exciting aspect of this initiative<br />
is its long-term international significance. </p>
<p>3.<br />
Ericsson Australia is already an established exporter of<br />
telephone exchange equipment to the Asia-Pacific region.<br />
The robotic cell is part of a substantial capital investment<br />
program that will reinforce Ericsson's international<br />
competitiveness. With this new technology Ericsson<br />
Australia will be well equipped to meet the tender<br />
requirements for a major overseas contract the second<br />
digital telephone network in Indonesia.<br />
Ericsson estimates that success in this bid could generate<br />
more than $ 1 billion worth of exports down the track. This<br />
would confirm the international status of our domestic<br />
telecommunications industry.<br />
It is because of this potential that the Australian<br />
Government decided last year to offer DIFF ( Development<br />
Import Finance Facility) support to the Ericsson bid to the<br />
amount of $ 83.4 million. I take this opportunity to repeat<br />
the Government's support for the bid.<br />
In other respects, too, Ericsson is displaying its<br />
commitment to the varied tasks of economic restructuring.<br />
It has been a success story of our new Industry Development<br />
Arrangements for local telecommunications manufacturers.<br />
These IDAs aim to foster the commitment of local<br />
manufacturers to research and development, export and<br />
domestic value adding, and Ericsson's contribution so far<br />
has been outstanding.<br />
Ericsson has also shown that it understands the importance<br />
of people, by sponsoring the establishment of a joint<br />
government-industry training initiative known as the<br />
Australian Electronics Development Centre. This Centre is<br />
unique in Australia in its provision of training for the<br />
electronics industry and shows again the capacity and<br />
commitment of this company to fostering a more capable<br />
Australian telecommunications effort.<br />
The emerging status of Australia's telecommunications<br />
industry is another reason why we should be looking closely<br />
at our existing services.<br />
I want before closing to pay tribute to Ericsson's Managing<br />
Director, Mr Lars Estberger, who is soon to retire. Lars.<br />
has been at the helm of the Australian operation since 1982<br />
and presided as we have seen over a period of<br />
significant growth in the company. His work has made<br />
possible the investment program we are commissioning today<br />
and contributed to the world class standard of Ericsson<br />
Australia. </p>
<p>4.<br />
It takes a significant commitment on the part of an<br />
individual and on the part of all employees to get the<br />
results that Ericsson has achieved. It is the sort of<br />
commitment which Australia requires if it is to compete in<br />
the international environment, and I am proud to be involved<br />
in the demonstration of this commitment today. </p>
