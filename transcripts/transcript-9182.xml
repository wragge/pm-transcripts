PRIME MINISTER<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, TIIE HON P. J. KEATING, MP<br />
STATE DINNER, BANGKOK, 7 APRIL 1994<br />
Thank you for honouring me with this dinner.<br />
1 am delighted to be here in this great city and in a country whose unique and rich<br />
culture and warm hospitality is legendary throughout the world.<br />
It is certainly well-known to Australians, and held in great affection and regard.<br />
For some time now Thailand has been a favourite destination for many thousands of<br />
Australian tourists, aifd increasingly for Australian business people.<br />
I am very glad that, as Australian Prime Minister, 1 have now had the opportunity to<br />
make it my destination.<br />
The friendship between our two countries goes back a long way, at least to 1945 when<br />
the first Australian Mission was established in Thailand.<br />
In the years immediately before that thousands of Australian soldiers had come in<br />
contact with Thailand and the Thai people as prisoners of war on the infamous Burma-<br />
Thailand Railway.<br />
Through the horrors of that experience Australian soldiers came to hold the Thai<br />
people in very high regard for the assistance they gave them and for their courage and<br />
humanity, It led one of them, a very great Australian, Sir Edward Dunlop, to devote a substantial<br />
part of his life to developing medicine in ThailFaind and to promoting a better and more<br />
extensive relationship with Thailand and the other countries of the region.<br />
Weary Dunlop died last year, but his message about Thailand and about Asia has never<br />
been better understood in Australia than it is now.<br />
We are old and good fiends. And today the opportunity exists to build that friendship<br />
into a far-reaching relationship with great rewards to both our countries.<br />
A summary of what we have achieved between us in recent years illustrates the<br />
potential for cooperation, the potential for an expanded Australia-Thailand<br />
relationship. In the past five years, two-way trade between us has reached more than $ 2 billion,<br />
growing at a rate of 25 per cent and making Thailand our twelfth biggest export<br />
market. 9 </p>
<p>Our aid program with Thailand is Australia's fourth largest.<br />
We have an active defence cooperation program.<br />
On a per capita basis, Australia has settled more Indochinese rcftigccs from Thailand<br />
than any other country.<br />
Our education links arc growing rapidly, with over 2,000 Thais studying in Australian<br />
institutions and 50 per cent more Thais seeking visas fbr education in Australia in<br />
1993-94 than inl the previous year.<br />
Since 1991 there have been more than 40 separate ministerial and parliamentary visits.<br />
Nearly 200,000 Australians visited Thailand in 1993 and more than 4,000 Thais are<br />
now visiting Australia eachi month, with the latest figures showing a 50 per cent<br />
increase on the corresponding period in the previous year.<br />
B~ othi our countries recognise that we share interests beyond the bilateral ecollnic and<br />
comnmercial relationship.<br />
Wc recognise that it is in our mutual interest to ensure that the voice of mliddle sized<br />
efonies is heard internationally.<br />
We recognise that we have much to gain from cooperation on regional political and<br />
security issues, as well as developing regional economic linkages.<br />
We recognise these common ambitions and, fiirthcrmore, these days we know we canl<br />
achieve t hem.<br />
Wc worked together on the Cambodian peace settlement.<br />
We worked together in the Cairns Group.<br />
We are now working together with APEC.<br />
It was a great privilege to work with you, Prime Minister, at the historic rnccting of<br />
APEC leaders in Seattle last November. That meeting was concrete evidcnce ofthe<br />
growin$ sense of community in the Asia-Pacific region, and the meeting ill Jakarta<br />
later this year wAil be vital in building the momentum,<br />
By bringing the economics of East-Asia and North America tog'ether in one<br />
cooperative framework, APISC is a key to unlock the region's full economic potential<br />
for the 21st century.<br />
A rapidly growing economy linking thie developing economics of Indochina and the<br />
rest of South-East Asia, Thailand also has a vital role to play aS a leader in ASEAN.<br />
It is for this reason among others that Australia is very pleased to have built the<br />
Mekong River Friendship Bridge a real and symbolic link between the developing<br />
economics of Laos and Vietnamn and the dynamic ones of ASEAN.<br />
For Australia, the Friendship Bridge is a striking symbol of the creative rolc we Call<br />
play in the region.<br />
We are in no doubt that Australia has a very great deal to offer Thailand as an<br />
economic partner and as a source of skills and expertise. </p>
<p>Much is happening within the relationship to demonstrate the truth of this. But we are<br />
far from realising its full potential.<br />
As a first step towards doing so that we must come to a fuller appreciation of the<br />
changes which have occurred in both countries over the past decade.<br />
We must understand present realities particularly economic realities.<br />
For example, I doubt that many Australians are aware of the size of Thailand's<br />
economy over 100 billion, the second largest in ASEAN.<br />
And I doubt whether many are aware that your economic growth is predicted soon to<br />
be the highest in ASEAN.<br />
On the other hand, I am not at all convinced that the dramatic reform of the Australian<br />
economy is widely appreciated in Thailand.<br />
Australia's economy is now highly competitive, open and geared for integration with<br />
the region and the world.<br />
It is the fastest growing economy in the OECD; the lowest taxing country in the<br />
OECD; and with inflation among the veryjlowe in the OECD.<br />
The Australia of this decade is anew Australia. An efficient, productive, competitive<br />
and creative Australia.<br />
An Australia which is a very good place in which to invest, which welcomes<br />
investment, which actively encourages investment.<br />
An Australia whose companies are now constructing Bangkok's tallest building and the<br />
Si-Chang Port Development, bidding for Bangkok's mass transit system, providing<br />
ba-kin services, using Bangkok as a regional aviation hub, helping to build the $ 1.3<br />
billion Muang Thong Tani residential project.<br />
An Australia, in other words, able to play a constructive role in Thailand's future and<br />
the development of the region.<br />
Prime Minister, next year will be the 50th anniversary of the first Australian diplomatic<br />
mission in Thailand, the first step in what has been a most warm and rewarding<br />
friendship. The talks we have had today I hope will mark another step a very substantial step<br />
towards fifty even more rewarding years in the Australia-Thailand relationship.<br />
Thank you very much for extending to me and Annita the privilege of this dinner and<br />
the opportunity to address you this evening. </p>
