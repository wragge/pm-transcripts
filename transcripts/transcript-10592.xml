The hearts of all Australians go out to the families and friends of the two firefighters killed today while battling one of the many bushfires currently burning across New South Wales.</p>
<p>They gave their lives serving the community. Laying down one's life in service of others is the greatest sacrifice that can be made and I want to pay special tribute to their enormous efforts.</p>
<p>The two were part of a vast network of emergency service personnel -- many of whom are volunteers -- who are desperately battling the fires on many fronts.</p>
<p>The people of Australia are grateful for their work today and the established tradition of Australia's gritty firefighting service has been well served once again.</p>
<p>Last weekend I was in touch with the Premier of New South Wales and assured him that all necessary Commonwealth assistance would be made available.</p>
