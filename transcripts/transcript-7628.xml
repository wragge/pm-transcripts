PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 6 JUNE 1989<br />
I welcome the positive response of the air traffic<br />
controllers to the Government's offer designed to end recent<br />
disruption at Sydney Airport and elsewhere.<br />
It is particularly pleasing to see that the Association<br />
unanimously determined to accept the process which I<br />
outlined in my letter of 30 May.<br />
I note the request of the controllers' Association seeking<br />
my further advice regarding the co-operation of the<br />
President of the Industrial Relations Commission in<br />
arranging for a Full Bench hearing.<br />
I have asked that arrangements be put in hand immediately to<br />
seek the establishment of a Full Bench, as proposed in my<br />
earlier letter. </p>
