    <content><![CDATA[<p>E&amp;OE..............................................</p>
<p>  Ladies and gentlemen, this is a marvellous day for jobs in Australia.</p>
<p>   There are two first class pieces of news which are directly beneficial</p>
<p>   to current and future job growth in our country.</p>
<p>  The outcome of the Climate Change Conference in Kyoto represents</p>
<p>   a splendid result and if, as I anticipate, the plenary session approves</p>
<p>   what has been agreed a short while ago, then it will be a win for</p>
<p>   the world environment and it will be a particularly gratifying result</p>
<p>   for Australia.</p>
<p>  I take the opportunity of congratulating and thanking Senator Robert</p>
<p>   Hill, my Environment Minister, and all the other members of the</p>
<p>   Australian delegation, for the really superb negotiating effort</p>
<p>   that they have conducted on behalf of our country. It is a result</p>
<p>   that Australia joins in very enthusiastically.</p>
<p>  For the first time we have an agreement amongst the developed countries</p>
<p>   to bring about a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. It is on</p>
<p>   a sensible basis that allows Australia to participate in circumstances,</p>
<p>   where, although there will still be an 8 per cent increase between</p>
<p>   1990 levels and levels in the year 2010, Australia will, relatively</p>
<p>   speaking, make a greater contribution in reductions in greenhouse</p>
<p>   gas emissions against business as usual amongst the developed countries.</p>
<p>   Our actual reductions against business as usual will be in the order</p>
<p>   of 36 per cent, against a developed country average of 30 per cent.</p>
<p>   And when you bear in mind Australia's faster population growth</p>
<p>   there is in fact a 4 per cent per head reduction on the part of</p>
<p>   Australia.</p>
<p>  We argued all along that we could not accept uniform mandatory targets.</p>
<p>   We said that the course proposed originally by the Europeans would</p>
<p>   have been ruinous for the Australian economy. We fought for Australian</p>
<p>   jobs every inch of the way and the outcome vindicates the Government's</p>
<p>   stance. It is an outcome that will protect tens of thousands of</p>
<p>   Australian jobs and it is also, importantly, an outcome that will</p>
<p>   put the world on a firmer path towards controlling greenhouse gas</p>
<p>   emissions.</p>
<p>  So I do very warmly welcome the outcome. It has not been an easy</p>
<p>   campaign for Australia but it's been a campaign at every stage</p>
<p>   directed towards the national interest. We put our case to the leaders</p>
<p>   of the world and finally, in Kyoto, skilfully led by Robert Hill,</p>
<p>   we have achieved a really first class outcome.</p>
<p>  The other piece of extremely good news for Australia today is of</p>
<p>   course the jobs figures. We had a rise of 71 000 in employment and</p>
<p>   over the past three months we've seen a rise of 145 000 jobs</p>
<p>   in Australia. That is the best quarterly rise in employment in Australia</p>
<p>   for two and a half years. That has been fuelled by the burgeoning</p>
<p>   confidence in the strength of Australia's domestic economy.</p>
<p>   Consumers are spending big this Christmas. Business men and women</p>
<p>   are investing. More staff are being recruited and despite the inevitable</p>
<p>   impact to some degree of the turn down in parts of Asia, there is</p>
<p>   a sense of hope and optimism around in the Australian economy that</p>
<p>   we haven't seen for some time.</p>
<p>  That is a direct result of the policies we put in place in March</p>
<p>   of last year. Always policies that are for the longer term take</p>
<p>   a period of time to bear fruit but the fruit is now beginning to</p>
<p>   appear through stronger growth, continued low inflation, much lower</p>
<p>   interest rates, and most importantly and most welcome of all, a</p>
<p>   sign that we've begun to turn the corner on the jobs front.</p>
<p>   The prospects are for a slow but sustained fall in unemployment</p>
<p>   into next year. It won't be an easy thing to achieve but we</p>
<p>   have begun to see the beginnings of a new period, a better outlook</p>
<p>   for employment, and I am personally delighted that on the eve of</p>
<p>   Christmas we can talk about jobs growth of 145 000 in a period of</p>
<p>   three months because at the end of the day, providing Australians</p>
<p>   with jobs and providing Australian families with hope and optimism</p>
<p>   for the future is the most important responsibility that any government</p>
<p>   in Australia has.</p>
<p>  The other piece of news which is important, be it in a smaller sense,</p>
<p>   or on a smaller scale for jobs in Australia, is that China, or the</p>
<p>   Chinese Government has announced that from now on Australia will</p>
<p>   be an official tourist destination for Chinese citizens and that</p>
<p>   will unlock the capacity for tens of thousands of Chinese citizens</p>
<p>   to visit Australia without having to get and make special passport</p>
<p>   arrangements.</p>
<p>  Ladies and gentlemen, can I again say, that this is a red letter</p>
<p>   day for jobs in this country. A great result, a splendid result</p>
<p>   in Kyoto for the environment, for Australia, for Australian jobs,</p>
<p>   and a continuation of the signs that emerged a couple of months</p>
<p>   ago that the labour market was strengthening with the news of 71</p>
<p>   000 additional Australian jobs.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  Prime Minister in Kyoto land clearing played a very important part.</p>
<p>   What can your Government do to ensure that in Queensland land clearing</p>
<p>   is slowed further?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  There has already been a slowing and I am quite certain that there</p>
<p>   will be a desire - given the first class outcome - there will be</p>
<p>   a desire on the part of everybody to co-operate but this is a, given</p>
<p>   what's been agreed on on tradeable credits and given what's</p>
<p>   been agreed on land clearance, that 8% is a very achievable outcome.</p>
<p>   It's consistent with the advice that we've received from</p>
<p>   ABARE and other organisations. We of course announced some measures</p>
<p>   a couple of weeks ago that brought about a very big reduction in</p>
<p>   what would have been the expansion of greenhouse gases on a business</p>
<p>   as usual basis, and because of credits and because of land use decisions,</p>
<p>   we are very able to sign up to the 8 percent.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  Do you need though to seek assurances from the Queensland Government</p>
<p>   that they will play a part?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well, there are a lot of areas of the community where assurances</p>
<p>   and so forth are needed but I am very confident there will be co-operation.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  Prime Minister, what if the United States Congress doesn't</p>
<p>   accept this arrangement? What will you do then? Where will it leave</p>
<p>   the agreement?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well, we will be arguing of course for the United States Congress</p>
<p>   to do so, that, ultimately of course, is a responsibility for the</p>
<p>   American Government to deal with.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  But if they don't accept it then you have no agreement at all</p>
<p>   do you?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well, that is a problem for the American Government.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  Prime Minister, is our approval conditional on the US Congress endorsing</p>
<p>   the US position?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  You never do that in negotiations with the US.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  PM, do you plan to ratify this treaty as soon as possible?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well, whatever constitutional processes are needed, yes.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  How much pain is this really going to cause us given that emissions</p>
<p>   appear to have stabilised with our 1990 levels as it is, if you</p>
<p>   take into account land clearing, that this really enables us to</p>
<p>   increase our emissions by that without doing anything?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well, I don't think people who are going to be affected by</p>
<p>   the measures that I announced a couple of weeks ago would regard</p>
<p>   that as doing nothing, but what is important to me in areas like</p>
<p>   this is getting an outcome that is good for our country, and that's</p>
<p>   what I've done, and that's been my objective all along.</p>
<p>   No country wishes to inflict gratuitous pain on itself and I certainly</p>
<p>   don't want to inflict any gratuitous pain on the people of</p>
<p>   Australia. We had put forward a very sensible, balanced position.</p>
<p>   We have argued our case consistently. I raised the issue with President</p>
<p>   Clinton when he was here more than a year ago. I raised it with</p>
<p>   the Japanese Prime Minister, the German Chancellor, the British</p>
<p>   Prime Minister twice and we've continued to do it, and of course</p>
<p>   Robert Hill led the team splendidly in Kyoto.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  Do you think that the rate of land clearing in Queensland, up until</p>
<p>   now, has been excessive?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  I am not going to start putting qualitative words of that kind when</p>
<p>   you've got an outcome that is good. Let's not spoil that.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  Prime Minister, on another subject, is it true the Government has</p>
<p>   no intention of apologising to the stolen generation as part of</p>
<p>   its response to the report to be announced...</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  We are discussing that with the indigenous representatives at the</p>
<p>   present time and when we are in a position to make a statement,</p>
<p>   we will, but I can tell you the statement will be generous.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  Is it true that you had legal advice that said that you should not</p>
<p>   apologise?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  I am not going to canvass the legal advice that we have had. We</p>
<p>   are discussing the issue with the indigenous community. We took</p>
<p>   an in-principle decision about 10 days ago and Senator Herron and</p>
<p>   Dr Wooldridge have been authorised to talk to the leaders of the</p>
<p>   indigenous people. I will be meeting some of their representatives</p>
<p>   tomorrow, here in Canberra, and when and where we are ready to make</p>
<p>   a statement we will. I can only reiterate that the statement will</p>
<p>   be generous and will respond in a very practical way to the continued</p>
<p>   trauma and the feelings of the Aboriginal community and the health</p>
<p>   needs, in particular, of that community.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  Mr Howard, before Kyoto you talked about 90,000 Australian jobs</p>
<p>   being at risk, you are now talking about tens of thousands of jobs</p>
<p>   being secured here, can we say that up to 90,000 jobs have been</p>
<p>   secured by this agreement?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well certainly any threat to those 90,000 has been utterly removed.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  Back to the Stolen Generation, the expectation today is that the</p>
<p>   Government is not going to apologise, are you suggesting that is</p>
<p>   still an open question and you could....</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  What I am saying is that when we have finished our discussions we</p>
<p>   will make an announcement, that's what I am saying. I am not</p>
<p>   saying anything more or less than that.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  Prime Minister, on the tax, if you level out the indirect tax as</p>
<p>   10 per cent, as the business community seems to want, does that</p>
<p>   take away any flexibility you have delivering indirect income tax</p>
<p>   cuts.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Splendid try.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  Prime Minister, just on jobs Prime Minister, you said that we have</p>
<p>   turned the corner and you have also set a target for growth...</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  There are signs that we have turned the corner. I think that is</p>
<p>   what I said.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  And you have set a target for growth, why would you not now set</p>
<p>   a target for unemployment?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Because growth governs employment, employment doesn't govern</p>
<p>   growth. It is a question of cause and effect. You can't have</p>
<p>   rising employment and falling unemployment without strong growth,</p>
<p>   so what you do is you secure the growth and the employment dividend</p>
<p>   follows automatically.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  Prime Minister, just following up Barry's question, what do</p>
<p>   you think of the ACOSS view which says that you should not use tax</p>
<p>   reform to change the tax mix?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  We are in regular discussion with ACOSS and as indeed we are with</p>
<p>   representatives of the business community and I don't intend</p>
<p>   to give a running commentary on each newspaper or television or</p>
<p>   radio story about the alleged attitude of those sectors of the community</p>
<p>   in advance of our policy being brought down. You know as well as</p>
<p>   I do that we are addressing this in a very comprehensive, professional</p>
<p>   way and I have absolutely no intention of giving bits and pieces</p>
<p>   out as we go along or responding seriatim to every question</p>
<p>   that is undoubtedly being asked and will be asked between now and</p>
<p>   when we make our policy announcement sometime next year.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  But you are still committed, presumably, to delivering substantial</p>
<p>   income tax cuts as part of your reform process?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  We are committed to delivering within the framework of the statement</p>
<p>   I made in August, was it, when I announced that we were really deadly</p>
<p>   serious about tax reform. That remains the framework and I really</p>
<p>   don't have anything to add or take away from that.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  Prime Minister, why won't you give a guarantee that your Government</p>
<p>   is not involved in the Dubai fiasco?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  What fiasco are you talking about?</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  Well it is certainly causing a lot of controversy in Australia.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well the people who seem to be getting most worked up about it are</p>
<p>   people like Mr Coombs and Mr Tanner. I suggest everybody go and</p>
<p>   take a cold shower. Our situation is very simple and that is that</p>
<p>   we are against violence of any kind where ever it occurs. The only</p>
<p>   industrial violence I can remember in the last couple of years followed</p>
<p>   a meeting addressed by Bill Kelty, Kim Beazley and Jenny George,</p>
<p>   when people tried to bash their way into this building. That's</p>
<p>   the only violence I can remember in the last couple of years. So,</p>
<p>   I think, when it comes to industrial violence, the leaders of the</p>
<p>   trade union movement of Australia have a great deal to answer for.</p>
<p>  We will never countenance as a Government in any breach of the law,</p>
<p>   any thuggery or any violent behaviour anywhere in Australia. That</p>
<p>   is not part of the Australian way.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  Mr Howard, you launched a multi-cultural issues paper this morning.</p>
<p>   A member of your Parliament, Graeme Campbell is getting press coverage</p>
<p>   in Asia, at the moment, on his social good-will visit. Is he going</p>
<p>   to spread the word that Australians are concerned about Asian migration?</p>
<p>   Are you doing anything to counteract any damage that he might be</p>
<p>   causing?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  I have not seen or heard any reports of that and until I do I am</p>
<p>   not going to comment on your question.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  What do you feel about, Prime Minister, some of your Government</p>
<p>   staffers joining a union to negotiate better wages and conditions?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  People can join any thing they like. You see the thing that a lot</p>
<p>   of people all around don't understand about our industrial</p>
<p>   relations policy is that people are perfectly free to join or not</p>
<p>   to join. I don't mind if people bargain individually, or bargain</p>
<p>   collectively, we don't mind. It is a free country for all of</p>
<p>   us. And the big difference is that under Labor you couldn't</p>
<p>   bargain individually, that's the difference. We give people</p>
<p>   freedom of choice.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  Have they got a case for a pay rise?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  I don't know. I haven't looked at the detail of it.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  Prime Minister, does your good jobs news today make you inclined</p>
<p>   to bring the election forward?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  No, I am enjoying the sunshine and I am not inclined to bring anything</p>
<p>   forward. I think we are going to have a good Christmas. I think</p>
<p>   we are going to have a very, very interesting first six months and</p>
<p>   the only reason that there has been talk of an election is that</p>
<p>   the Labor Party and others have refused to pass our Native Title</p>
<p>   Legislation. So if they want to get talk of that right out of the</p>
<p>   way all they have got to do in three month's time is let our</p>
<p>   eminently fair legislation go through and then you can all forget</p>
<p>   talking about elections until it is due, which is any event of by</p>
<p>   March or April of next year.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  What do you think of Michael Costello's suggestion of an outside</p>
<p>   mediator for native title?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Parliaments, Prime Ministers and Governments are elected to solve</p>
<p>   problems, not outsiders.</p>
<p>  Thank you.</p>
