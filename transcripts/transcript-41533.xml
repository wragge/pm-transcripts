    <content><![CDATA[<p>It is with great pleasure that I send my greetings to Australia’s Jewish community at this special time of celebration.<br />
 <br />
For Jewish people around the world, Passover is rich in historical, cultural and religious significance – a time to gather around the Seder table, give thanks for one’s blessings and recall one of humanity’s greatest stories of liberation.<br />
 <br />
The spirit and message of Passover has resonated down the ages, strengthening and inspiring the Jewish people and reminding them of their commitment to one another and to tikkun olam.<br />
 <br />
In Australia, Passover is also a reminder of our great fortune to live in a land of peace and prosperity – the wondrous achievement of generations past whose vision of a better future we now inherit.<br />
 <br />
All Australians should carry forth the ideals of justice, courage, and freedom that made this legacy possible. Together, we should endeavour to make a better world for generations to come, and for all humanity.<br />
 <br />
With these thoughts in mind, I wish all members of Australia’s Jewish community a joyous and uplifting Passover. Chag Pesach Sameach.</p>
