TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING MP<br />
INTERVIEW WITH LINDA MOTTRAM AND DEBBIE WHITMONT, ABC<br />
RADIO NOVEMBER 1995<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
PM: Yitzhak Rabins life was a life that mattered. So it was a very, I think,<br />
moving ceremony to recount his life and some very moving things said<br />
including by K( ing Hussein of Jordan, by President Mubarak, by<br />
members of his staff and family and I hope that his untimely death will,<br />
if anything, spur the peace process along.<br />
J: It Is a high price to pay for pursuing a political policy that you believe<br />
in. I wonder what you think as a leader yourself and also what you<br />
think in terms of world politics, that it has to come to that. Is that<br />
something that goes through your mind?<br />
PMV: I think anyone who Is a democrat knows that there is an attendant risk.<br />
But, you do meet people and you must meet people because, for all<br />
democrats, the life source Is from the public, its from the people, and if<br />
one gets to the point where you don't have that free association, you<br />
can't pick up the bloom from the community, you can't pick up the<br />
buoyancy and the authority whiich a democrat must have. So, I<br />
understand very well what his life and, I think, what his attitude about<br />
that was. How he would have lived his life in this respect. But, of<br />
course, on the evening that he died he had, I'm told, a very successful<br />
rally for peace in what has been a very controversial debate here in<br />
Israel. So, he had a very clear manifestation and some jubilation and<br />
joy at the reception he had been given and it was at the end of that, of<br />
course, he was murdered, he was assassinated. So, he would have<br />
had a charge from knowing that on his most important mission that<br />
there was great support, a crowd of 100,000 or more had turned out to<br />
support him.<br />
I think it may be too that Israeli's will reflect on their own political<br />
process and that the rabid and unprincipled attacks upon him, the<br />
extreme views put against him have created a climate which has<br />
produced his death and it may make people here reflect about that-</p>
<p>TE6L.: Nov. 95 18: 58 No. 007 P. 0<br />
2<br />
That they have to conduct their debate in more moderate terms, more<br />
sensibly.<br />
J: How does it affect your view of Australia and Australia's role in the<br />
world?<br />
PM Australia is blessed because it shares a continent with nobody and it is<br />
a very large nation which has, essentially, been held in trust for us by<br />
the Aboriginal people and which we have now developed as a united<br />
country. When you see old places sharing civilisations and borders<br />
and where old hatreds have been around for a long time Otfortunately,<br />
has been not our lot<br />
J: Can I just ask you also about the issue that is running in Australia<br />
regarding John Howard. He has suggested that you have dealt with<br />
this situation, in terms of his inability to be here, in an improper<br />
fashion, what is your response to that?<br />
PM: I wouldn't for a second diminish Yitzhak Rabin's life or in any way seek<br />
to trivial ise his tragic death by a debat6 about some of the<br />
meanderings of Australian politics. The important thing was, I think,<br />
that Australia should be represented to honour the life of a significant<br />
person who really made a difference in a country that has always<br />
struggled. Arnd that representation can only be by the Australian<br />
Government. Thank you.<br />
