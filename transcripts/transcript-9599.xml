ADDRESS BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
LUNCH HOSTED BY JAPANESE BUSINESS ORGANISATIONS, TOKYO.-<br />
THURSDAY, 25 MAY 1995<br />
It is a great honour to address you today and I thank you for the invitation you<br />
have given me.<br />
This Is not the first time I have spoken to these important organisations and<br />
to many of you in this room, of course.<br />
Among the people here are some who have been active in Australia-Japan<br />
trade for more than forty years.<br />
Having been present at the creation of the Japanese economic miracle, you<br />
know what radical change involves. You know that the need for change goes<br />
on and on so much so that those who have been making the changes could<br />
sometimes be forgiven for thinking that enough has been done. But you<br />
know that this is not a thought a country can ever entertain.<br />
If you have been watching Australia, or dealing with us in recent years, you<br />
will be aware of the radical change which has taken place. The Australian<br />
economy has been completely transformed; it is vastly more competitive,<br />
more diverse and more integrated with the world and the region.<br />
And you will also be aware, I trust, that the changes are still coming that we<br />
have not entertained the thought that we have done enough.<br />
Our old frends here know Australia's story. They have been part of it. A very<br />
Important part of it, because the relationship between Japan and Australia<br />
which has developed steadily over the past 50 years, is an essential thread in<br />
Australia's economic development and, of course, in Japan's.<br />
But it is to those of you who are new to our relationship that I mostly want to<br />
address my remarks today.<br />
Because I think we are entering a new, slightly uncertain, but very exciting<br />
phase in this relationship. </p>
<p>After the war ended fifty years ago, far sighted business people and political<br />
leaders in each country recognised the complementarities, between our two<br />
economies and worked to build those links between us which helped,<br />
fundamentally, to fuel economic growth in both our countries.<br />
Over the years these great business links the iron ore, coal and other<br />
primary products have continued to be central to our trade. But in the<br />
recent past new elements have entered.<br />
Processed food, manufactures, high-technology and services have become<br />
increasingly prominent. Sophisticated products like computers, software,<br />
high-speed ferries and specialised medical equipment have joined the list of<br />
our exports. And more than 20 per cent of all international visitors to<br />
Australia, and 6 per cent of all international students in Australia, are now<br />
Japanese. Our patterns of trade have changed as Japanese companies have begun to<br />
invest elsewhere in Asia, and we have begun to supply them in these " third"<br />
countries. Developments like these clearly point the way to the future of our<br />
relationship. They reflect changes in Australia and Japan which are offering<br />
us new opportunities as our 50 year old partnership enters a deeper, more<br />
complex and rewarding phase.<br />
The liberalisation and deregulation of the Japanese economy is one of those<br />
changes. That process is now underway. and I believe it is irreversible and in<br />
Japan's own interest as well as the world's.<br />
I know many of you here, representatives of Japanese business, have been<br />
at the forefront of the demand for thoroughgoing economic reform and<br />
deregulation. I am sure that it is crucial for our Japan's future. But I have to<br />
tell you frankly that much more needs to be done.<br />
The Keidanren, for example, has estimated that deregulation could deliver a<br />
net extra 740,000 jobs and increase the size of the Japanese economy by<br />
about 40 per cent over the next five years.<br />
In Australia's view, these reforms have not yet gone far enough. But we are<br />
convinced that progressive implementation of reform will be a powerful<br />
catalyst to free dynamic forces in the economy. Japanese consumers will<br />
benefit.<br />
And, reflecting smaller trade and current account imbalances brought about<br />
by higher levels of imports and domestic consumption, the yen will fall.<br />
So when we urge Japan to maintain the momentum of reform we are not<br />
entirely altruistic. We know it will open up substantial new opportunities for<br />
Australian exporters. </p>
<p>Of course, it Is up to Australia, and our business people in particular, to take<br />
advantage of the opportunities.<br />
We know that Australian businesses have been heard to say from time to<br />
time that Japan is " too hard' a market to penetrate.<br />
We would not be urging these reforms on Japan Nwf e did not think Japan<br />
should be " easise. But Australian business would be foolish to turn their<br />
backs on a market of such a phenomenal size and where the rewards to be<br />
had from success are so great. Bear in mind that a percentage point of<br />
growth in Australian exports to Japan equals in value terms our whole current.<br />
export trade to Vietnam.<br />
There are obvious opportunities for our exporters: if Australian firms are<br />
sufficiently hard-working and persistent, and their products and services are<br />
of the highest quality as many of them are they should succeed, most<br />
obviously in such sectors as construction, foodstuffs and health and<br />
education services.<br />
If the very real difficulties of the Japanese market still frighten too many<br />
Australian business people, it has to be said that the Australian Government<br />
does not have an antidote for fear. But the Government can help our smaller,<br />
newer exporters to find niches niches in sectors of the Japanese market and<br />
niches in the regions of Japan. I will be opening a new Australian Business<br />
Center designed to address part of this problem later today.<br />
But the fact remains we will all succeed more often and go much further<br />
towards realising the opportunities inherent In our modem relationship if<br />
Japan further deregulates Its markets.<br />
So what does Australia bring to the partnership?<br />
To begin with, we bring one of the industrialised world's ten largest<br />
economies, a country rich in natural and human resources and a commitment<br />
over decades to a partnership with Japan.<br />
We bring a real friendship for Japan with us.<br />
We also bring creative policies and the determination to implement those<br />
policies. Beginning In the 1980s. we recognised that Australia could no longer live well<br />
enough by exporting iron ore and wool and other primary products to the<br />
world while our manufacturing industries grew inefficient and lethargic behind<br />
high tariff walls. </p>
<p>But we changed. We slashed tariffs, floated our currency, deregulated our<br />
financial markets, eliminated import quotas and liberalised foreign investment<br />
guidelines in all sectors,<br />
All this was done within the context of an unprecedented accord with our<br />
trade unions, under which we moved from a centralised to a more flexible<br />
wage-fixing system.<br />
Some of the results of this revolution because it was a revolution in<br />
Australia are well known.<br />
Last year we had the highest growth rate in the OECD at five per cent<br />
while at the same time corporate profits reached historic new levels.<br />
And while inflation has been running at around two per cent for the past three<br />
years. Some of the other results are less well known. They relate to Australia's<br />
competitiveness in the world.<br />
Our international competitiveness Increased by around 40 per cent over the<br />
past ten years.<br />
We now have one of the lowest overall levels of taxation in the industrialised<br />
world. Prime CBD rentals in Melbourne and Sydney cost less than in Singapore.<br />
Less than in Shanghai or Ho Chi Minh City, as Well.<br />
Living costs for expatriates in Sydney are lower than in any other major city in<br />
the Western Pacific. And, for reasons I hope all of you already know, or will<br />
soon know, Australia's Oquality of life" ranked second out of the 41 countries<br />
measured In the World Competitiveness Report.<br />
And we have not stopped. A country which abandons policy change<br />
abandons its stake in the race for the future. I will give you just three<br />
examples of changes we have made in the past 12 months.<br />
A year ago, we took the decision to make a massive investment in the skills of<br />
our workforce. We directed programs towards training young people and the<br />
long-term unemployed.<br />
We boosted our technical and vocational education system and made it more<br />
responsive to business more suited to the modem economy in which the<br />
knowledge and skills of a countrys workforce and its capacity to retrain<br />
regularly, are basic determinants of economic success. </p>
<p>The increased competition that has flowed from lower tariffs has made the<br />
Australian economy much more dynamic; but the primary influence has been'<br />
on those sectors exposed to foreign competition.<br />
To extend this quite fundamental change to the rest of the economy, we last<br />
month reached an historic agreement with our state governments to boost<br />
competition in our utilities and our ports, in our professions and our<br />
agricultural marketing authorities in water, airports, government services<br />
right across the domestic economy competition will be intensified. The result<br />
will be a much more responsive and dynamic economy and a significantly<br />
lower cost structure for business.<br />
Australia's most single important economic challenge is to lift our savings<br />
performance. The need Is manifest in a current account deficit that has been<br />
too large for the past 15-20 years.<br />
We also need to lift our savings performance because, like Japan, our<br />
population in Australia is ageing: not as rapidly as Japan's because of our<br />
higher rate of population growth. But we stilt may see the proportion of our<br />
population aged over 65 increase from 12 per cent to 18 per cent over the<br />
next 30 years.<br />
There will be a correspondingly shrinking proportion of the population in<br />
employment providing for those in retirement. The appropriate response to<br />
these changing demographic forces, of course, is to save and invest more.<br />
This is what your government has done very impressively over the years.<br />
According to OECD statistics, your public sector gross debt represents about<br />
per cent of GNP. But the corresponding figure for net debt is just 8 per<br />
cent, a difference of about 70 per cent of GNP.<br />
This difference is largely accounted for by the accumulation of assets, in<br />
retirement accounts.<br />
We have taken up the challenge to increase our saving rates through<br />
measures tailored to Australian circumstances.<br />
First, we have tightened fiscal policy. By international standards, Australia<br />
does not have a problem with a large amount of public debt on the books.<br />
In fact, we have the lowest level of public debt in gross terms among OECD<br />
countries, arnd one of the lowest in net terms.<br />
However, the reliance of our economy overall on foreign savings requires us<br />
to go further on the public accounts, and that is what we have done in this<br />
years Budget. Our Budget will return to surplus In the coming financial year,<br />
and be in surplus without relying on asset sales and the like in the following<br />
year. </p>
<p>The second element of our savings strategy is directed at retirement incomes.<br />
A decade ago, we had only 40 per cent of our workforce in superannuation,<br />
or private pension provision. Today, it is590 per cent. Today, our<br />
superannuation funds hold about $ 186 billion in assets.<br />
We are going to increase contributions from around 5 per cent of income to<br />
per cent by early next century. This will mean that every Australian<br />
person will be saving at least 15 per cent of their income. The result will be<br />
superannuation funds, private pension funds, of about $ 2,000 billion by 2020<br />
a pool of savings about double our GDP in today's prices. That is, 200 per<br />
cent of our GDP.<br />
So in one year we have taken major initiatives on national savings, vocational<br />
training and domestic economic competition.<br />
Australia has been for some time a high quality, cost-effective place to do<br />
business. It is becoming a bete place to do business. We expect more and<br />
more Japanese companies to recognise this as many already have.<br />
Toyota, for example, invested some 30 billion yen in its Melbourne plant last<br />
year. Mitsubishi are expanding their Australian operations on a similar scale.<br />
The Shimadzu Corporation, makers of precision medical and laboratory<br />
equipment, chose Australia for its new manufacturing and research operation.<br />
In Japan's financial year 1993, over 30 per cent of Japan's foreign direct<br />
investment in mining went to Australia and 70 per cent of its FDI in food.<br />
Of course, it is much easier to reform when others are doing the same and<br />
against a backdrop of a strengthened international trading system.<br />
That is why APEC is so important to both Japan and Australia. For each of<br />
us, APEC accounts for 70 per cent of our country's trade.<br />
It is worth recalling the weight and seriousness of the historic declaration<br />
made under President Soeharto's chairmanship at Bogor last year and its<br />
boldness. The leaders of all the APEC economies met freely together, and after a<br />
preparatory process involving our own special assistants, agreed to achieve<br />
free trade in the region by 2010 for industrialised countries and 2020 for<br />
developing countries in other words, an integrated market of two billion<br />
people. Japanese business, with your vertically integrated structure in the region, will<br />
be a major beneficiary of this process. </p>
<p>This year, the task of co-ordination and chairmanship falls to Japan. The<br />
meeting being hosted in Osaka in November will be critical to the region and<br />
critical to Japan.<br />
The job will be to give form to the APEC declaration, to guide the<br />
implementation of the Bogor vision.<br />
I am confident Japan will meet this challenge.<br />
I am particularly confident because I know him that Prime Minister<br />
Murayama, who played such a good role at Bogor, understands the historic<br />
opportunity and will do all he can to grasp it.<br />
I believe it is one of Japan's great post-war multilateral opportunities, the<br />
benefits from which can greatly exceed the Uruguay Round outcome.<br />
And, for its part, Japan can be confident that, in its efforts to consolidate<br />
APEC's achievements and contribute to the emerging Asia-Pacific<br />
community, it will have no firmer supporter than Australia.<br />
I am grateful to all of you who came today for the courtesy you have extended<br />
to me.<br />
