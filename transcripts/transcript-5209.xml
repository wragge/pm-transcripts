PROME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 5 1979<br />
ADDRESS TO THE QUEENSLAND BRANCH OF THE<br />
INSTITUTE OF DIRECTORS<br />
Queensland, of course, has always been in the vanguard of<br />
development in Australia, and as we approach the 1938s,<br />
the contribution to be made by Queensland business leaders<br />
in ideas, in innovation and in action, will I hope, have<br />
telling significance for all Australians.<br />
As we approach a new decade, Australians are rightly interested<br />
in the prospects that this period holds for all of us.-I<br />
believe there is a strong concensus in the community that over<br />
the last four years we have been able to haul the economy back<br />
from a position where its weakness was threatening the well-being<br />
of all Australians.<br />
We are now in a position where our economic stability and strength<br />
give us due optimism for the 80s. I want to say something to<br />
you today about the processes that have been at work to effect this<br />
revival and the prospects which are in store for us in the years<br />
ahead. I believe that a combination of factors is now at work<br />
in our economy which will create opportunities for further<br />
economic achievement and social well-being. But to these<br />
opportunities must be added the will of government, business<br />
and industry leaders to see that today's prospects become<br />
tomorrow's realities.<br />
It is little more than four years since Australia and its<br />
economy were wilting under the excesses of Labor government.<br />
No regard had been paid to the size of the public sector.<br />
Commonwealth budget outlays increased dramatically. In fact,<br />
the expenditure of all public authorities rose by 105% in three<br />
years. Welfare costs reached unacc. p able levels and health<br />
costs in one year rose by l13%. All: tiiswas matched by an increa: e<br />
in personal income tax revenue of 125% in three years.<br />
The money supply grew rapidly, as did the level of wages.<br />
Profits fell. These were changes which shook the very basis<br />
of our economic structure. They were changes felt by all<br />
Australians. Understandably, the economy was incapable of<br />
absorbing them. / 2<br />

These factors contributed to an inflation rate in one 12-. onth<br />
period of over 17% more than five percentage points ab. ov the<br />
OECD average. By September this year we had reduced tht rate<br />
by eight percentage points, to alrost 3 points below the United<br />
States' rate; and seven percentage points below that in the<br />
United Kingdom.<br />
This is a significant demonstration of the success of our<br />
economic policies. I present this picture of the Labor years<br />
for two reasons. In the first place the Australian Labor Party<br />
is making a token claim for the right to govern Australia and<br />
manage the national economy through the<br />
Yet its recent ALP conference in Adelaide demonstrated that<br />
its policies on wages, the growth in government spending and<br />
the size of government are not just a translation of the period<br />
when they were in government; in many instances they are more<br />
ambitious, more provocative and potentially more reckless.<br />
Indeed the need to control inflation is not mentioned in any<br />
of their policy statements as an over-riding economic<br />
objective. The second reason I make reference to the Labor record is that<br />
only by having it at hand, can a full appreciation be cained of<br />
the nature of the task we face, and a proper measure mad of<br />
the success that we have achieved.<br />
The objectives I outlined to you in 1976 are still valid today.<br />
* They are central to achieving continuing and sustainable economic<br />
gr wth. Thz Gont ha playd it part. In the lat three<br />
years there has been' little real growth in Commonwealth government<br />
expenditure compared with the three year increase under Labor of 4-.<br />
We have begun initiatives which increase the rewards for effort<br />
and encourage investment. We have simplified the tax scale<br />
which allows for a significant increase in earnings before the<br />
taxpayer moves into another bracket.<br />
This in itself is an incentive to greater effort as overtime<br />
or additional part-time employment can generally be worked<br />
without attracting a higher tax rate. The overall result is<br />
that from this week, 90% of taxpayers are paying tax at tha<br />
lowest marginal rate of 32 cents in the dollar.<br />
As well, we have raised the minimum income level at which<br />
tax has to be paid. Now uo to half a million Australians<br />
on low incomes no longer pay any tax at all.<br />
V7e have abolished federal estate and gift duty. We have introduced<br />
the investment allowance. We have raised the private company<br />
retenticn allowance. Our new energy policy is providing the<br />
necessary incentive to oil exploration.<br />
Our attack on inflation; our seeking of reasonable wage<br />
increases; our reining in of government expenditure; our<br />
success in reviving investment; all have been matched by<br />
an increasing public awareness that Australians in the 3'-j<br />
should continue to reject a disturbing dependence on government<br />
in favour of a greater sense of individual responsibility. &gt; J </p>
<p>3<br />
Many indicators suggest that our efforts of the past four years<br />
have produced significant results. Our inflation rate at the<br />
end of last September was 9.2% compared with the OECD average<br />
of 10.6%, USA 12.1% and the , UK 16.5%.<br />
This has helped make our industries internationally compet<br />
Costs are down. Exports are up. Private capital inflow into<br />
Australia in the last financial year was the highest since<br />
1971/ 72.<br />
Factory production, as measured by the ANZ Bank index, has<br />
increased by 9.4% in the year to September 1979. In fact,<br />
the increases that are taking place are broadly based and have<br />
beenachieved in 26 of the 30 categories measured by the Bureau<br />
of Statistics. This trend is confirmed in other areas.<br />
Real investment by business increased significantly last year.<br />
Civilian employment in the year to September grew by nearly $ 3,000.<br />
Gross value of rural output this financial year is expected<br />
to increase 65% on ' 77/' 78 levels.<br />
We are now placed to enter the ' 80s with prospects for the future<br />
much better than those in most of the industrialised world.<br />
This assessment can be made because of our strength on three<br />
major fronts. In the first place our economy is one of the<br />
strongest in the world at a time when the world economy is<br />
plagued by the problems of inflation and slow growth.<br />
Secondly we have abundant raw materials, materials the world<br />
wants and needs.<br />
Thirdly, our energy resources place us in a uniquely priv. i. lejcd<br />
position. Coal, natural gas, LPG, crude oil, electricity and<br />
uranium represent an impressive total. endowment of energy<br />
commodities. This is true at a time when the threatened extremism of some<br />
countries gives the problem of energy shortage a greater urgency<br />
than might otherwise have attended it. Our objective in the<br />
must be to combine the strength of our internationally<br />
competitive economy; the wealth of our natural resources and the<br />
availability of low cost energy development to secure economic<br />
growth for a long time to come.<br />
The Government is determined to accelerate this process.<br />
We believe we are advantageously placed to undertake a<br />
major national development programme. The first step towards<br />
this was taken last November at an historic meeting of the Loan<br />
Council which approved a new borrowing programme to finance<br />
future national development.<br />
We are determined that the private investment and development<br />
should not be impeded because of inadequate facilities, whether<br />
they be power-generating plants, coal loaders or ports. In<br />
particular with the emerging international energy position,<br />
the Government's responsibility is to capitalise on our natural<br />
resources and secure the future supply of electricity. / 4 </p>
<p>A<br />
The development of coal processing -electificity, projectCs in*<br />
A"-Ustralia is not only central to our energy pol_' v, but a~ so<br />
it enables major processing of our own minerals to be udrae<br />
in Australia which will reap enormous benefits for all p , S 14ins<br />
,' ihthis in mind, we approved, 12 months ago, 12 na-io:-.-<br />
dev. elopment projects e stimated to cost $ 1.7 billion. Of_ a,<br />
alzmost half $ 896 million was for the develozrnent of: Dow., er<br />
genaeration facilities in Queensland, New South Wales,<br />
Victoria, Tasnania and ! W-estc--n Australia.<br />
Four of the remaining seven projects were designed to zfacilitate<br />
either the export of our energy reserves or the domeszic-use ofalternatives<br />

Yesterday, i announced that-for the first time the Corun-c wealth<br />

One of these is a proposal for the electrification of' the<br />

initiative by the Co. mon-. weaIth to create a major transn; or:-<br />

energy resource which we must increasingly take. advantage of<br />
in the next decade.<br />
in fact, the national developmi~ ent pro) grmme must seek. to mk<br />
the use of coal fired electricity forr mnany purposes o-n-e of h<br />
central goals in the ' 80s. Without foreshadowing State<br />
initiatives I can. say that -that princ-inle is embodied in<br />
the proposals for discussion this Friday, where a further<br />
$ 300 million of projects For electricity power generation<br />
and almost $ 200 million for railway electrification,<br />
excluding the Melbourne-Sydney project, will come up for<br />
decision.<br />
As an indication of the momentum that is gathering in tr~<br />
national development progracne, the Comm. onwealth last mnn<br />
invited the Premiers to bring forward further proposals for<br />
coal based electrification projects.-All these programmes<br />

But . Australia has always been rich in<br />
human resources as well. We are going to need these resources in<br />
the years ahead. Our skilled labour; our development and appiication<br />
of new technology; our entrepreneurial skills provenly successful<br />
in innovation, production, programming, managing and marketing;<br />
all these are essential parts of our future plans. The Australian<br />
character itself is no less important. Its competitive instinct<br />
must be encouraged. The competition in the ' 80s will extend<br />
beyond our own shores. But we are ready for these challenges<br />
and will welcome the rewards that can flow from an outwardly looking<br />
competitive. approach. In business and in government we will need<br />
to adopt a truly international approach.<br />
The strategy of looking mainly to the domestic market was<br />
appropriate in the earlier stages of our industrial development.<br />
It is not a strategy which will take us successfully into the<br />
There is no going back to it.<br />
The fears of the 80' s only exist for those who want to meet<br />
the new decade with the solutions of the past.<br />
The changes that have occurred in the world economy: the emergence<br />
of new economic power blocs; the increased export capacity of<br />
developing countries in both manufactures and services; all<br />
require their own form of adjustment by everyone.<br />
None of these changes. are temporary. Those who imagine them<br />
to be so, merely yearn for a past where business and industrial<br />
life was safe and more comfortable. We all know there are no<br />
profits to be made in the past.<br />
Our economic machinery is geared to move us confidently into<br />
the That is not to say there won't be challenges and the nc d-i'r<br />
Change for business and industry in the next decade. But we<br />
must never forget that challenge and change also contain<br />
undeniable opportunities. Australian industry is already<br />
successfully making adjustments in a wide range of areas.<br />
There is already, underpinning many of the industrial projects<br />
of the future, an outward-looking, forward-thinking, progressive<br />
sense of management.<br />
I am not suggesting rapid and dramatic change. Rather,<br />
1 am advocating a continuing adjust; ent that is grad-Ic<br />
and manageable; an adjustment that is already occurring<br />
throughout many'sectors of the economy. One of tomorrow's<br />
challenges lies in identifying the best markets. Rapid<br />
industrialisation has occurred in the economies of East<br />
and South East Asia, and China has emerged as a major<br />
market not only for foodstuffs but also for raw materials. </p>
<p>-6-<br />
This has resulted in a continuing shift in the direction of our<br />
exports. In the last financial year our exports to Asia had<br />
more than trebled what they were at the beginning of the decade.<br />
This trend will continue as real incomes rise in the. East Asian<br />
and South Eastern region, producing a quickening in demand for<br />
consumer goods, industry and development in these areas.<br />
The position with imports is much the same. In the last financial<br />
year they had reached a level more than four times greater than<br />
what it was at the beginning of the decade. This continuing<br />
rise in imports from Asian countries has resulted from the<br />
improved quality and competitiveness of their products<br />
coupled to a conscious effort made by the Government to promote<br />
trade with Asia.<br />
You will recall that last year Australia sponsored and hosted<br />
the ASEAN Trade Fair in Sydney and a second such fair will be<br />
held in Melbourne next August.<br />
There is growing trade between Australia and Asia and this<br />
is to our mutual advantage. Newly industrialising economies<br />
will need for their growing industrial bases a wide variety<br />
of imports coal, iron ore, alumina and aluminium, iron and<br />
steel, agricultural and specialised industrial machinery,<br />
management and technical consultancy services.<br />
Australia has the capacity to meet these demands. There has<br />
been one interesting by-product of the changing international<br />
economic order. The increase in price of liquid fuels wZs<br />
initially thought to have only negative consequences for Australia.<br />
Yet now it offers major opportunities for us which are already<br />
being accepted. For example, as countries find their energy<br />
costs mounting, aluminium smelter projects are moving to<br />
Australia where our massive reserves of coal provide us with<br />
-low-cost energy and the opportunity for processing raw<br />
materials here in Australia. So you can see that. far from<br />
being intimidated by the decade ahead we should be inspired. / 7 </p>
<p>7<br />
Real growth often occurs most rapidly when circumstances<br />
us to face hard decisions; invite us to take opportunities;<br />
invite us to exercise initiative.<br />
Government h. a respo nsibility to create the climate wich<br />
this can occur, so that there will be rewards for risk-taking.<br />
For four years we have dedicated ourselves to the application<br />
of responsible policies. They have been designed to reduce<br />
inflation and inflationary expectations. They have sought to<br />
restore a stable climate in which business can make decisions<br />
and help create employment.<br />
I believe our policies have resulted in strong gains. These<br />
gains have not been easily won. The comp! le: ities of tody<br />
don't admit the simple solutions of the past.<br />
The 80' s in business and industry will be the decade when we<br />
must look outward, not inward; when we must be aggressive in<br />
our market thinking, rather than tentative; when we must take<br />
advantage of our geographical position rather than lament our<br />
geographical isolation.<br />
I am confident that in the 80' s our Government can provide the<br />
climate and the freedom in which business and investment will<br />
prosper. The buzz of debate about the future of our industries has become<br />
incessant. Where we go in the 80' s is essentially up to us as individual<br />
entrepreneurial Australians.<br />
Today I have tried to present to you a prospectus of development<br />

It is full of challenge; rich in potential rewards.<br />
I am sure that business and industry, as in the past, will play<br />
a vital role in securing progress and achievement in the<br />
