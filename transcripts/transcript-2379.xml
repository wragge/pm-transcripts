FOR PRESS: PM N! q. 27/ 1971<br />
NON-DWELLING BUILDING-CONSTRUCTION<br />
Statement by te Prime Minister Mr. John Gorton<br />
The Treasurer and I met this morning for discussions about the growth<br />
in the private non-dwelling building construction area which, as I indicated in my<br />
address to the nation on 29th January last, is one of the matters we have under<br />
examination in our attack on threatening inflationary growth.<br />
The meeting was attended by Mr. 1. K. Campbell., Chief Executive, Hooker<br />
Corporation Ltd., Sydney; Mr. W. M. Leavey, Managing Director, Lend Lease<br />
Corporation Ltd., Sydney; Mr. R. C. T. Baker, Managing Director, Mainline Corporation<br />
Ltd., Sydney; Mr. P. Strasser, Managing Director, Parkes Developments Pty. Ltd.,<br />
Sydney; Mr. E. Graf, Managing Director, Stocks and Holdings Ltd., Sydney;<br />
Mr. T. C. Whittle, Chairman and Managing Director, Whittle C. Holdings Ltd.,<br />
Canberra, and Mr. J. D. Lewis, Managing Director, Concrete Constructions Pty. Ltd.,<br />
Sydney. W~ e were informed that the value of office blocks on which construction<br />
commenced in 1969/ 70 was $ 263 million.<br />
This very high rate of commencement was still in evidence in the quarter<br />
ended 30 September 1970 the figures for which even indicated a slight increase, namely<br />
an annual rate of $ 271 million.<br />
Office block construction of this value, we were advised this morning,<br />
is capable of producing a gross area of office space of approximately 14 million sq. it.<br />
Reduced to a lettable area this would be approximately 11. 2 million sq. ft.<br />
Those representatives of developers and builders with whom we talked this<br />
morning said that this area, 11. 2 million sq. ft., is significantly greater t ha n the annual<br />
demand for new office space throughout Australia, and construction cannot continue<br />
at this rate if a serious over supply situation is to be avoided. We were also told that<br />
a responsible re-assessment of the estimated value of building construction commencements<br />
in 1971 suggests that the lettable areas arising from these commencements in<br />
1971 will be approximately 8 million sq. ft.<br />
It was confidently felt by the developers and builders present this morning,<br />
who would be in part responsible for these commencements, that this figure of<br />
approximately 8 million sq. ft. of lettable space vo uld have to be significantly reduced<br />
becau of the apparent levelling off which had already occurred in the market demnand<br />
for office space. They said that their revised estimates cor~ irmed a most certain<br />
over supply position if the rate of commencements indicated in 1970 continued into<br />
1971 and 1972 / 2 </p>
<p>In view of this advice we concluded that no direct action is required by<br />
the Government at this time to reduce the rate of commencements of new office<br />
buildings. However, the Treasurer and I agreed to arrange regular quarterly<br />
meetings between the Treasury and representatives of those with whom we conferred<br />
this morning so that the matter can be kept under examination. After the first<br />
of these meetings, when the estimated value of new buildings commenced in the<br />
December quarter 1970 become available, the Government will review again the<br />
need for further action by it in this area, and will be prepared to take action if<br />
the forecasts given to us this morning turn out to be not fulfilled.<br />
