    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Australian Government will immediately donate $A10 million to the American Red Cross to assist those most affected by the devastation wrought by Hurricane Katrina.</p>
<p>The Red Cross is one of the leading charitable organisations working directly on the ground with victims to provide urgent supplies of food, water and shelter.</p>
<p>In addition to this, as an immediate first step, the Government is sending a small team of emergency management specialists.  The team will work through our Embassy with the Americans urgently to identify in what fields further practical Australian assistance might be most effective.</p>
<p>The Government has also offered the American authorities a further group of between 15-20 experts to help provide emergency assistance on the ground.</p>
<p>We have offered help in areas where specialist Australian expertise might be useful in public health and in disaster victim identification where our recent experience in our region may be valuable.</p>
<p>Australians wishing to make donations may do so through the Australian Red Cross.  The Government has approved tax deductibility for all such donations.</p>
<p> Australian consular officials are now on the ground at the Astrodome in Houston to receive evacuated Australians and provide consular assistance as required.</p>
