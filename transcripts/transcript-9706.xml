PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
INTERVIEW WITH PAUL BARBER, RADIO 3AW, MELBOURNE,<br />
14 AUGUST 1995<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
PB: Prime Minister, welcome first of all.<br />
PM: Thank you, Paul. It is good to be here.<br />
PB: Now you have seen a couple of the moving ceremonies this morning.<br />
You have seen a lot of the VE ceremonies. You are going to see a lot<br />
more this week of the VP ceremonies. To Paul Keating, citizen, what<br />
sort of impact does it have on you?<br />
PM: Oh a very big impact. I have been very interested as Prime Minister to<br />
underwrite more fully the history of the Second World War in the<br />
Pacific, where the sovereignty of Australia was threatened and where it<br />
was saved. Before 1992, the 50th commemoration of the fall of<br />
Singapore and then Kokoda and the Owen Stanley campaign, much of<br />
the history of Australia at war has been centred around the First World<br />
War the national identity being forged at Gallipoli etc. But it was in<br />
the Second World War where Australia was saved and we are now<br />
getting around in 1995 to the 50th anniversary of VP Day to tell that<br />
story.<br />
PB: To right the wrong?<br />
PM: Yes. Well just to let young Australians know that the place was under<br />
assault, that we could have lost it and yet with our Allies we fought back<br />
and won the day. So I think that is important. The other thing is, of<br />
course, I became Prime Minister in December 1991. Just a month or so<br />
later, was the 50th anniversary of the fall of Singapore. So the period I<br />
have been Prime Minister has been, if you like, 50 years on, the<br />
shadow of the whole of the Pacific campaign in the War. So you have<br />
a mind's eye picture of the time and the events and where they<br />
happened and the sequence and the time between them. You know, so<br />
in these four years I have been able to, in a sense, put myself back into<br />
1942-45. F-C-) </p>
<p>PB: Tell me, do you have difficulty getting a handle on just how difficult<br />
things must have been for people up here in the north? I mean coming<br />
from Melbourne and Sydney, you come up here and you suddenly<br />
realise hang on, you know, Townsville they had three air raids but<br />
they didn't come to anything. But they thought that the Japanese would<br />
invade through this town. I mean to be living here at that time and then<br />
to go meeting all the diggers on Saturday night, it is extraordinary.<br />
PM: Well, I think, that the great sea battles, of course, were decisive. That<br />
was the Coral Sea where the Japanese fleet was turned around. They<br />
were heading, of course, to Port Moresby and had they taken<br />
Port Moresby would have made then unrelenting assaults on the north<br />
east coast of Australia and then, of course, we had the opportunity,<br />
they were then forced back to the north coast of Papua New Guinea<br />
and came over the Owen Stanley's and that is where we fought them at<br />
Kokoda. The other great battle, of course, was the battle of Midway,<br />
where really in a somewhat fluky environment, the United States found<br />
the Japanese squadron and broke it up and these were the two<br />
decisive events of the sea war.<br />
PB: A lot of that here in Townsville.<br />
PM: Yes, I mean it is like the war in Europe. I mean we nearly didn't win it. I<br />
mean that is the point that was nearly if you look at, you know, why<br />
Hitler didn't attack Britain with a maritime campaign after the fall of<br />
France, why he opened up a flank with the Soviet Union. I mean we<br />
won the war, but I think it is worth recalling that we might not have.<br />
PB: Are you surprised that the Japanese, in fact, well they didn't invade<br />
Australia? I mean, are you surprised that they didn't make a greater<br />
effort or attempt?<br />
PM: Well they made all the effort. I mean they got themselves established<br />
in the Solomons. They got themselves established in Indonesia and<br />
they had made assaults on Australia there and had they, of course,<br />
succeeded in the sea campaign to take Port Moresby, they would have<br />
certainly then moved solidly on to Australia.<br />
PB: Can I ask you this one because you and I would be roughly the same<br />
generation, I would think. I know that my relatives, when they came<br />
back from the war so we were growing up in the 50s and early 60s<br />
were very loathe to talk to me about it. You know, say " Uncle, what<br />
happened in the war?" and they didn't want to talk about it. What was<br />
the situation in the Keating family and do you know why they didn't want<br />
to talk about it?<br />
PM: Well my father lost his brother in the death march from Sandakan in<br />
Borneo two months before the war ended and they expected him home.<br />
In fact, they were organising the sort of party for him to come home. I<br />
mean they got the telegram to say he had been killed by the Japanese<br />
on the death march from Sandakan to Ranau. He was the only one </p>
<p>who was enlisted and so it was always, in a sense, a pall hanging over<br />
my family because he was the one who went away and he was the one<br />
who didn't come back.<br />
PB: Well, you see, there are many families like that who seem to suffer in<br />
silence, whom are aged over 50. [ inaudible] they were New Zealand<br />
and Australian.<br />
PM: Well I think it was only until people started talking about it and writing<br />
about it in the 1980s that, for instance, the Sandakan camp and the<br />
death marches and what happened at Hell Fire Pass in Thailand was<br />
not really spoken of very much, it is only recently. And the Sandakan<br />
commemorative committee have now put these memorials around<br />
Australia but they were placed there two years ago, nearly half a<br />
century later. So you are right, it wasn't spoken of very much.<br />
PB: But it seems now and this is what surprised me coming up here this<br />
time, is that talking to the men and women all the women that drove<br />
the trucks around here in Townsville this time around they seem to be<br />
far more open about what happened and some are positive about their<br />
lives and the contributions they made. Well as I say when I was<br />
growing up in it, it really was that term we laugh at now " whatever you<br />
do, don't mention the war".<br />
PM: Don't mention the war, no. Well it was always overshadowed by<br />
Gallipoli and Flanders, the First World War history and the Anzac<br />
identity and because there were not, if you like, battles of that enormity<br />
in the Second World War involving Australians. I don't know whether it<br />
is for that reason that it was not celebrated as much as certainly in the<br />
First World War the sovereignty of Australia wasn't called in to<br />
question, but it was in the Second World War. I mean it was young<br />
militia, young men who were not part of the regular army who fought at<br />
Kokoda, who fought the initial resistance there and I think that we are<br />
now learning to understand what that meant and to celebrate what they<br />
did.<br />
PB: Yes, the other thing too that occurred to me that there was this pall<br />
during the 50s and whatever. That was the period, however, of well<br />
the war changed forever because immigration suddenly became a<br />
momentous thing and that has changed Australia irrevocably.<br />
PM: Yes, Australia is now a multicultural country. A mono-culture is finished<br />
and we are a more interesting and stronger place for it.<br />
PB: And because of the vibrancy after the go out of themselves so<br />
spontaneously, I just wonder whether that has rubbed off on to us and<br />
that is why we now talk about the war, our parents do, more openly<br />
than we mightn't have.<br />
PM: I think the other thing is that it is half a century ago and people feel that<br />
this is their last chance to talk about it in any organised way. </p>
<p>PB: Well, again, is this the sort of grand finale, if you like, of looking back<br />
as a celebration, do we now have to head to a republic, you know, in<br />
the next century, all that sort of stuff?<br />
PM: Well there is a bitter chapter closing in this I think going on. There is a<br />
bitter closing in this going on because I have heard a number of<br />
veterans say to me, this will be the last chance we will get together like<br />
this. It is probably the last chance for us to talk about it like this. But<br />
for those who went back to some of the theatres of the war, they feel as<br />
if we sort of, you know, made the circle. We have returned and now it<br />
is done and it was always in the mind...<br />
PB: There was a chapter, Vietnam.<br />
PM: Now it is full, it is shut. Well history it is never shut, but at least in the<br />
minds of many people it will be more satisfied.<br />
PB: Can I just raise one question with you, it popped up today, and that is<br />
the fuzzy wuzzy angel the very famous guy Raphel he says that if<br />
the Government wants to help him they should give him a home in his<br />
village.<br />
PM: Well, he left me a note when I met him. I haven't read the note yet, but<br />
when I get a moment I will. I think we appreciate very much what these<br />
people did for us, the many hundreds of thousands of them and we<br />
constantly take every opportunity, you know later this year I first met<br />
him in Kokoda in 1992 and later this year when I open the Kokoda<br />
Memorial Village.<br />
PB: Ok if I could just put it, it is him that features in that photograph carrying<br />
PM: Yes, and along the Kokoda trail and we are building a hospital there<br />
and dedicating it to the people of Kokoda because when I went there in<br />
1992 it was about to be overtaken by, I think, a sugar company or some<br />
other group which was harvesting some large group up to the edge of<br />
what was formerly the little village of Kokoda. At any rate now we have<br />
got two successive Papua New Guinea governments to agree to turn it<br />
into an Australian shrine. It will be an Austral ian-Papua New Guinea<br />
Shrine.<br />
PB: So, you will read Raphel's letter?<br />
PM: I will read Raphel's letter and see what we can do for him bearing in<br />
mind that upon independence, with Papua New Guinea in the early<br />
1970s all about, if you like, the responsibilities we have in terms of the<br />
treatment of veterans passed over to Papua New Guinea and I'll see<br />
what we can do sensibly without opening up the whole precedent area. </p>
<p>PB: Can we clarify another one, Bruce Ruxton always seems to get upset at<br />
most of Australia calling it VP Day, wants to call it VJ Day. Do you<br />
have a firm view on that.<br />
PM: No, some references have been VJ Day, some VP Day. I don't think<br />
so, but it was Victory in the Pacific, it was a Pacific war and I think it<br />
was called VP Day at the time from memory. I don't think it matters<br />
much. There was only one substantial enemy and that was Japan. We<br />
all understand that.<br />
PB: Are you satisfied with their apologies thus far, I mean, is that the end of<br />
it as far as you are concerned or do you want more?<br />
PM: Well, there have been apologies in the past. I don't think the apologies<br />
themselves matter as much as the inculcation of the truth in their<br />
population. I think that matters more. That is, that the Japanese<br />
community and its children are taught the history of the Second World<br />
War and the period of Japanese militarism. I think we would rather that<br />
openness and that understanding, that coming to terms with<br />
themselves than simply an apology because, I think, it was Prime<br />
Minister Kishi from memory back in the 1950s 1957 or 1958 came to<br />
Australia with a very genuine and comprehensive apology, but that has<br />
been forgotten and now people say they should apologise. So, we get<br />
another Prime Minister to make another apology. I think what we really<br />
want is for the Japanese people to understand what happened and to<br />
take the lesson from it and to declare not to be doing these things<br />
again.<br />
PB: A hypothetical, say you were President Keating there in August 1945,<br />
you knew you had these bombs, you had to think about whether you<br />
were going to drop them or not and you knew that the possibilities was<br />
one on Hiroshima and the other one on Nagaski, what would you have<br />
done?<br />
PM: I think the history shows that the Japanese were prepared to surrender<br />
provided that the Emperor Hirohito was maintained in his majestic role<br />
as the head of the Japanese community. Subsequently, President<br />
Truman did agree to that. Had he agreed to it earlier, it is very likely<br />
that the Japanese would have capitulated before Hiroshima and before<br />
Nagaski. Whatever the rationale for Hiroshima, I don't think there was<br />
any real rationale for Nagaski.<br />
PB: So, you would have probably held off for a while longer and then if you<br />
had to go with Hiroshima, you said you wouldn't go with Nagaski?<br />
PM: Well, I wasn't there and it wasn't my call. But, the history book shows, I<br />
think, that allied interception of Japanese telecommunications traffic<br />
showed that they were prepared to capitulate providing that they could<br />
get an assurance about the maintenance of the Emperor. Given the<br />
fact that President Truman finally did agree to that, had he agreed<br />
earlier the likelihood is Japan would have capitulated. One can never </p>
<p>be completely certain, you could say of Hiroshima probably there is an<br />
area of doubt, of Nagaski I couldn't see any point to that.<br />
PB: Of all the ceremonies that you have been a part of and seen both over<br />
VE Day and now our own celebrations here is there one that stands out<br />
that has moved you more than any other?<br />
PM: The one that moved me most was the visit to Kokoda in 1992. The<br />
reason was that it was defended by young men, by boys in shorts in<br />
singlets and shorts with machine guns. Australians 18 years of age<br />
militia, as I said not part of the regular army, fighting the crack<br />
Japanese marine troops, combat marines who came across the plain<br />
and from the coast through Popondetta up to Kokoda. I think, that sort<br />
of valour, I talked today about the innocence of Australia then a small<br />
country, innocent of these sorts of forces in the world fending off the<br />
Japanese. The crack manifestation of Japanese militarism with 18 year<br />
old boys in shorts. The thing that has always made me feel so sad<br />
about it all was obviously Changi, Sandakan, Kanchanaburi, Hell Fire<br />
Pass, the incarceration in brutal terms of Australians and British<br />
soldiers by the Japanese.<br />
PB: I met a guy today who was nine stone, when he came back he was five<br />
stone. He went from Singapore to Changi to the Burma Railway to then<br />
making armaments in Japan, actually saw the bombing of Hiroshima<br />
and I can't believe that he is so relaxed about it today.<br />
PM: Tom Uren was in that position. Tommy was taken to Japan and he<br />
worked in a coal mine and he saw the flash of either Hiroshima or<br />
Nagaski I can't remember which one but he saw the flash.<br />
PB: This guy said he didn't know what it was.<br />
PM: No, and we were in Japan at an Australian cemetery earlier this year<br />
and I thought that was a very sad place because imagine being an<br />
Australian in Japan in 1945 in the snow and the cold and then coming<br />
into summer and the bomb and the Japanese holding you in contempt<br />
a pretty sad place to be and a pretty sad way to go.<br />
PB: You are absolutely right. I know you haven't got much time, you have<br />
got to go off, if you don't want to answer a couple of domestic issue<br />
questions that is fair enough, but I wonder if I can just throw a couple at<br />
you. Carmen Lawrence, is she finished?<br />
PM: No. The High Court has said that until the jurisdiction of West<br />
Australia, until the processes have run their race there, it can't<br />
intercede in this. What's happening here is that the executive<br />
government of Western Australia has employed as an arm of the<br />
executive a Royal Commission to do things that none of the rest of us<br />
have ever used the executive government to do. That is what she is<br />
resisting. If the point comes where she gives testimony in this, I have<br />
no doubt she will do it very forthrightly. </p>
<p>PB: So, you still confident in her..<br />
PM: Absolutely.<br />
PB: Martin Ferguson, that issue and the resolution of it with him looking at<br />
now getting a seat, is that a sign that the days of factional party hacks,<br />
if you like, taking safe seats, is that a sign that that is over?<br />
PM: I would hope we wouldn't have party hacks taking safe seats and<br />
certainly with Martin Ferguson, the Labour Party will be stronger and<br />
the government will be stronger because he is a person that has<br />
represented working Australians all through his adult life, joining the<br />
government. I mean, one of our claims is that we sincerely represent<br />
the interests of working people and to have the leader of a movement<br />
that has most adequately represented them join us would be a good<br />
thing for us. I think the public will regard that change well.<br />
PB: One more, I was quite angry at this criticism myself of your wife Annita<br />
Keating and the Sydney Symphony Orchestra going overseas and..<br />
we ought to be encouraging it not knocking it, John Howard refused to<br />
actually intervene..<br />
PM: You see, I would not have a front bencher of mine attacking the wife of<br />
the opposition leader or a front bench member. Nobody attacked my<br />
wife when she played a role in the Olympic selection in Monte Carlo<br />
and represented Australia in Barcelona. And the Barcelona<br />
representation, I think, materially helped the Monte Carlo selection.<br />
There is enough to argue about in public life if that is what it is about<br />
over policy without bringing in these things. So, running Senator Alston<br />
out and then seeing which way the wind blows is not a very manly thing<br />
for Mr Howard to be doing.<br />
PB: Does it make you angry?<br />
PM: Not much, there's nothing that could happen in the Liberal Party that<br />
surprises me. Here they have got the whole force of the state in<br />
Western Australia arraigned against the one woman member of our<br />
Cabinet and they are out there chasing my wife over something she is<br />
doing to support I mean, my wife is a European, she has been<br />
through Germany and France and Britain on so many occasions she<br />
doesn't' need a visit with the Sydney Symphony Orchestra to see<br />
Europe. She is doing it only to advance what she thinks is Australian<br />
culture.<br />
PB: Has it in any way acted as a catalyst for you because you have got your<br />
back to the wall according the polls John Howard is going to get in<br />
easily this time.<br />
PM: I've got more substantial things to argue about than that. </p>
<p>PB: Alright, one final question, you were talking about young people and of<br />
course you have got a young family yourself and what are their<br />
thoughts about VP celebrations. What do you kids, what do you want<br />
them to remember from this weeks and last week activities?<br />
PM: I think the best that we can hope for with children as young as mine is<br />
for it to register with them, to know that it was a great event in the<br />
history of Australia, that Australia was saved by the courage of many<br />
young people at the time and that those values of liberty and<br />
egalitarianism and democracy which resided in the hearts of those<br />
young Australians that fought in shorts at Kokoda, are still out there<br />
today in the young Australians of this generation.<br />
PB: Thank you very much, we'll talk again I hope.<br />
PM: Thank you very much indeed.<br />
ends </p>
