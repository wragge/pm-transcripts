    <content><![CDATA[<p>The greatest economic challenge facing Tasmania is its crushing debt</p>
<p> burden.</p>
<p>This was recognised in the Nixon Report which recommended sale of</p>
<p> the HEC and a contribution from the Commonwealth in support of that</p>
<p> sale.</p>
<p>The Tasmanian Premier, Mr Rundle, is to be applauded for his courage</p>
<p> in committing his Government, through the sale of the HEC, to throwing</p>
<p> off Tasmania's debt shackles and creating a more competitive</p>
<p> Tasmanian economy.</p>
<p>In the spirit of the Nixon Report, I announce today that the Commonwealth</p>
<p> is prepared to write-off $150 million of debt currently owed to it</p>
<p> by the State of Tasmania. This represents about half of Tasmania's</p>
<p> debt to the Commonwealth.</p>
<p>This offer is conditional on the passage through the Tasmanian Parliament</p>
<p> by 31 December 1998 of legislation to sell the Hydro's transmission</p>
<p> and distribution businesses and to lease for 99 years its dams and</p>
<p> generation assets.</p>
<p>Naturally, the offer stands irrespective of the election outcome.</p>
<p>The State's heavy debt burden wastes Government money on debt</p>
<p> repayments, drives up taxes, discourages investment and results in</p>
<p> people leaving Tasmania. In 1997 alone, Tasmania's population</p>
<p> fell by 4,500 people.</p>
<p>Those who stick their heads in the sand and pretend that the problem</p>
<p> can be solved without resolute action are selling the long-term interests</p>
<p> of Tasmanians short.</p>
<p>That is why the visionary and bold plan put forward by Mr Rundle deserves</p>
<p> the support of all Tasmanians.</p>
<p> He alone has exhibited the courage to tackle the core problem</p>
<p> of Tasmania's economic malaise Â– its debt burden.</p>
<p>Sale of the HEC will eliminate State debt, thus freeing the Government</p>
<p> to spend more money on schools, hospitals, police and other community</p>
<p> services.</p>
<p>This offer from the Federal Government follows earlier initiatives</p>
<p> of great benefit to Tasmania. These have included the hugely successful</p>
<p> ferry subsidy, $110 million for the regional forest agreement, $125</p>
<p> million from the Natural Heritage Trust, $58 million for regional</p>
<p> communications and $20.5 million for the ABT Railway which will stimulate</p>
<p> more tourist jobs.</p>
<p>The Government's recently announced tax plan will massively benefit</p>
<p> Tasmanians. The major reductions in fuel costs proposed under the</p>
<p> plan will greatly benefit Tasmania's growth industries, such</p>
<p> as tourism.</p>
