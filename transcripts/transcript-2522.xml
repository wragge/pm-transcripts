FOR PRESS: PM. No. 12/ 1972.<br />
REPLACEMENT OF RAN DESTROYERS<br />
Statement by Prime Minister, the Rt. Hon. William McMahon, C. H., M. P.<br />
The Prime Minister stated today that the Government<br />
proposed to examine later this year the question of replacing W~ N<br />
destroyers scheduled for retirement from front line service in the<br />
late 70' s and early 80' s. The design and construction of these<br />
ships was an exceedingly complex and time consuming process and<br />
would have to be put in hand this year if ships were to be available<br />
in 1980. In the meantime the Government had given consideration<br />
to the preliminary measures necessary to keep essential options<br />
open. The Government had authorised the preparation of designs for<br />
the first stage modernisation of Williamstown Dockyard. The total<br />
cost of this modernisation work, if implemented, would be $ 6m. The<br />
uesign work would involve only a small expenditure. The modernisat~ on<br />
of Williamstown Dockyard was necessary in any case for efficient<br />
operation of the dockyard.<br />
Further work on the preliminary design of an Australian<br />
built destroyer is also proceeding. An amount of $ 670,000 had<br />
recently been authorised to assist in collection of design and other<br />
data necessary fcr the decision to be made on the overall programme<br />
later in the year. The next stage would be the issue of invitations<br />
for t1-enders for the detailed dcesign of the vessels. It had been<br />
decided that it would be prudent not to take this st * ep until a firm<br />
Oecision had been reached to proceed with an Australian designed<br />
' destroyer. The Prime Minister emphasised the crucial importance of<br />
this project to the Navy and to Australian defence. Destroyers are<br />
the backbone of the RAN combatant fleet. Modern destroyers equipped<br />
with essential missile attack and defence systems wherever they are<br />
produced are very expensive and the total impact on the defence<br />
programme would be considerable. As the new ships will have a life<br />
extending beyond the year 2000 it was essential that a thorough<br />
examination should be completed before the Government entered into<br />
any commitment.<br />
