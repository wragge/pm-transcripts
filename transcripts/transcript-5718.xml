PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA TUESDAY, 15 DECEMBER 1981<br />
SPEECH AT THE 75TH ANNIVERSARY OF<br />
AUSTRALIA'S FIRST FEATURE FILI4<br />
Film is perhaps the only new art form for which the twentieth<br />
century can take most of the credit, and the fact that Australians<br />
were involved in cinema in such a significant way so early<br />
is something which we can indeed be-proud of. The clips<br />
which we have just seen of ' the 1906 version of Ned Kelly,<br />
and of three more recent films as well, tell a fascinating<br />
story of the initiative and creativity of Australians, and<br />
there is no doubt that Australian film makers deserve the<br />
recognition and respect which are now being paid to their<br />
work worldwide.<br />
In the early days of cinema, one critic said that this new<br />
art had within its grasp innumerable symbols for emotions<br />
that have, previously failed to find expression, and went on<br />
to say that the film-maker would have enormous riches at<br />
his command when he found some new symbol for expressing<br />
thought. There-is little doubt that new symbols for expressing<br />
both thought and emotion have been found through cinema, little<br />
doubt either that new symbols are still being developed,<br />
indeed it is perfectly plain that the potential of cinema<br />
as a medium for communication and artistic expression are<br />
being very impressively explored.<br />
The Australian community has responded with real enthusiasm<br />
to the success of Australian films in recent years, and while<br />
many people will take some time to grasp the reality that<br />
Australian films are as good as any intechnical and artistic<br />
terms, everybody welcomes the increased portrayal of various<br />
aspects of the Australian way of life through Australian films.<br />
Australia has one of the oldest-film industries in the.<br />
world, for the first Australian newsreel, showing scenes<br />
of the 1896 Melbourne Cup, was made and shown only a year<br />
after the -Lumiere brothers gave the first public s( reoning<br />
of films in Paris.<br />
The Story of the Kelly Gang is credited as the first feature<br />
film made in Australia, although it was not until later that<br />
the film was recognised as a pioneering feat. The " feature / 2 </p>
<p>-2<br />
film" must rate as one of the half-dozen key inventions in the<br />
entire history of cincema, and this invention, which the Tait<br />
bothers made in this country seventy five years ago, has<br />
become the foundation of the film industry worldwide. The<br />
Tait brothers showed a great deal of astuteness and commercial<br />
insight in producing that film, and many of you here would no<br />
doubt like to match the return on capital which they achieved,<br />
for I understand that the film returned 25,000 pounds for an<br />
outlay of about 1,000 pounds. It is tragic that we only have<br />
three and a half minutes of this historic film which would<br />
originally have taken about one and half hours to screen.<br />
And I would like to take the opportunity to give the strongest<br />
encouragement to the last " Last Film Search" which represents<br />
a concerted effort to discover and conserve what remains of<br />
Australia's early film history. This search, which is being<br />
undertaken by the National Library of Australia aims to gather<br />
early Australian films into the National Film Archive.<br />
The stock on which films were made up until 1957 is unstable,<br />
and much of it is now nearing the end of its life, so the<br />
search project, which was launched in October with the<br />
sponsorship of a number of organisations, is an urgent one,<br />
and I understand that hundreds of reels have already been found.<br />
At present, however, only 5% of Australia's silent films have<br />
been found and preserved. Every effort needs to be made to increase<br />
that percentage in the few years still available before the<br />
old film stock disintegrates, and a complete print of the Kelly<br />
story would be a find of immense significance.<br />
The Kelly film. in 1906 was a pacesetter. It was followed by<br />
Robbery Under Arms in 1907, and in the period between 1906 and.<br />
1913 some 90 films were made, many of them bushranging dramas<br />
and theatrical melodramas. 153 films were made during the years<br />
of the First World War, and the decade following 1918 saw the<br />
production of 96 films including such classics as The Sentimental<br />
Bloke, On Our Selection and A Girl of the Bush. -I understand<br />
that these particular films will feature in a nationwide film<br />
festival, legernds on the screen which will be exhibitied<br />
throughout Australia in January, and that will no doubt be a<br />
fascinating festival.<br />
In the late 1920' s, a number of factors, especially the advent:<br />
of ' talkies",' with their higher costs, and the strength of<br />
Hollywood eroded the Australian feature film industry. But<br />
Australians never relinquished their claims on the feature<br />
film, and there remained a substantial reservoir of film making<br />
expertise in other areas. To a* considerable extent this was<br />
a product of the requirement that commercials on Australian<br />
television shoud be essentially Australian in procbaction.<br />
The Australian Broadcasting Tribunal still maintains this<br />
requirement, and a result, between two and three thousand<br />
commercials are now being produced annually in Australia, and<br />
this provides valuable work and experience in film making.<br />
The local content provisions for television introduced in 1960<br />
have worked in the same direction. / 3 </p>
<p>-3<br />
The success of these policies is evident from the fact that today's<br />
Australian content is running at some 55% in peak time, compared<br />
with about 40% in 1976/ 77, and about 70% of expenditure on<br />
programmes by T. V. stations is on Australian material.<br />
The 1970s were obviously a period of tremendous development<br />
and advance for Australian films, and the extent to which<br />
film lovers in other countries are wanting to see Australian<br />
films is a tribute to the people in the local industry who<br />
have worked so hard and with such imagination and dedication.<br />
While it is the creativity of film makers which has achieved<br />
the revival of the Australian film industry, nobody would<br />
deny that government support has been critical to the developpent<br />
which has occurred, and as I said some years ago, the Government<br />
will continue to encourage film and television, in partnership<br />
with the industry, the ultimate aim being self-sufficiency.<br />
In 1970, the Commonwealth Government established the Australian<br />
Film Development Corporation to foster development of feature<br />
films. This corporation was subsequently absorbed by the<br />
Australian Film Commission, which has developed or invested<br />
in a large number of major'-feature films including,<br />
" Picnic at Hanging Rock", " Caddie", " Newsfront", " Storm Boy",<br />
" Breaker Morant", and " Gallipoli", and indeedupto<br />
of investment funds in feature film production over the<br />
last 12 years were provided by government film bodies, with<br />
more than $ 10 million being provided by the Commonwealth.<br />
An experimental film fund was also set up in 1970 under the<br />
Australia Council to develop new talent. Plans were underway<br />
in the same year for the establishment of a national film<br />
and television school, and its first graduates included<br />
Phillip Noyce and Gillian Armstrong, who were later to direct<br />
" Newsfront", and " My Brilliant Career", respectively.<br />
From the point of view of government assistance, and investment<br />
in the industry, the most significant development in the past<br />
year has been the amendment of the Income Tax Assessment<br />
Act to assist film production. In broad terms, the Act now<br />
provides for 150% of expenditure on el'igible films to be<br />
allowed as deduction against income in the year in which the<br />
film is first used to produce assessable income, and an<br />
exemption from taxation of all receipts from the film up to<br />
an amount equal to 50% of an investor's original capital<br />
expenditure. The concession ks, as John Howard has said, not only extremely<br />
generous, but is unparalleled in taxation laws, and as you<br />
know, he will be reviewing its workings with the executiveof the<br />
Film and Television Production Association in due course.<br />
I understand that the industry has settled down now the new<br />
arrangements are in place, and we all look forward to more and<br />
more good films to prove both the wisdom of. the Government's<br />
decision and the talent of your industry.<br />
The present thriving condition of the film industry with 16<br />
feature films currently being made in Australia and a further<br />
11 films projected to commence production early next year,<br />
is not something we can take for granted. But the combinationa 4 </p>
<p>-4-<br />
of enthusiasm, talent and experience which the Australian<br />
Film Industry now possesses provides grounds for optimism<br />
about the future, and I am confident that the industry<br />
will make good use of the opportunities which exist to build<br />
a great and strong film industry in Australia in the next<br />
years. 000---</p>
