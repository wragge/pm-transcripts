iV IL116, iN T1M HUME U? I | i. 1 i \ TATI VI2X U<br />
8TH DECEMBER, 1965<br />
RHODESIA<br />
I wish to inform the House of measures in the financial<br />
and economic fieldwvhich the Government has decided to take<br />
against the illegal administration in Rhodesia. These measures<br />
are additional to those that I announced on 16th November.<br />
They are taken in the belief that peaceful measures are<br />
preTerable to military measures ana that, in order to minimise<br />
the ultimate damage to Rhodesia, the sooner the sanctions<br />
become effective and normal constitutional administration is<br />
resumed, the better for that country.<br />
This is not an easy decision to take because sanctions<br />
can hurt very deeply. Of course, sanctions are designed to<br />
impose disabilities, but a system of sanctions which stops<br />
short of being effective could easily go on operating for a<br />
long long time, creating irritations, not solving the roblem<br />
and perhaps provoking extreme action on the part of other<br />
people. Therefore we have come to the conclusion that, falling<br />
in line with the U. K. and various other countries we should<br />
to some extent intensify our economic measures. In what I say<br />
it must always, of course, be remembered that our trade with<br />
Rhodesia is a small one not quite Å“ 2 million worth of imports<br />
altogether annually.<br />
In relation to financial measures, we will recognise<br />
the Board of the Reserve Bank of Rhodesia, which the British<br />
Government has appointed to replace the previous Board. T1e<br />
will recognise it as the only proper authority. Following from<br />
this decision, it may be necessary for us to consider introducing<br />
restrictions in respect of financial transactions between<br />
Australia and Rhodesian residents comparable with the restrictions<br />
introduced by Britain. Also, we have decided to suspend the<br />
money order service between Australia and Rhodesia.<br />
In relation to economic measures, it will be recalled<br />
that we have already placed a ban on the importation of tobacco<br />
from Rhodesia. e now propose to prohibit also the importation<br />
of ferro-alloys chrome-ore and asbestos. The ban on imports of<br />
tobacco meant tat approximately three-quarters of our total<br />
imports from Rhodesia were suspended. The inclusion of ferroalloys,<br />
chrome ore and asbestos will mean that we have prohibited<br />
imports from ' Rhodesia affecting more than 90 per cent. of the<br />
total. The British have banned approximately 95 per cent. cf<br />
their imports from Rhodesia.<br />
Honourable members will, of course, recognise that in a<br />
relatively small field these measures are severe. However, the<br />
unhappy situation with which-weare'alinP is of grave proportions,<br />
involving as it does not only the cessation of lawful rule in<br />
Rhodesia but also the arousing of emotions in Africa and elsewhere.<br />
In all these matters it is our hope that the result of the<br />
me3sures now being applied by this and other countries will mean<br />
a return to sanity ana negotiation and that Rhodesia will see<br />
reason and find a return Yo a legal and constructive relationship<br />
with the British Government. </p>
