    <content><![CDATA[<p>If ever we should enter a New Year full of optimism, it is 2014.</p>
<p>We are a strong, resilient and smart people.</p>
<p>Thatâs the strength of our country. Not so much government, but in the willingness of you â the people â to better your life.</p>
<p>This is the year, I hope more of us than ever will âhave a goâ â weâll start new businesses, weâll build new houses, weâll undertake further study, make investments and plan a future: because thatâs how we build the stronger and more prosperous country that we all want.</p>
<p>The Government will do its part: we are scrapping bad taxes, weâre cutting red and green tape, weâre ending waste, weâre building infrastructure and strengthening the Budget.</p>
<p>My plan is to give you more choice, more freedom and fewer government demands â so that you can build a better future for yourself and for our country.</p>
<p>A strong country always has a deep appreciation of its history and this year we commence the commemoration of the Centenary of Anzac and I hope that you will take part.</p>
<p>I will also start the conversation about a constitutional referendum to recognise the first Australians.Â  This would complete our Constitution rather than change it.</p>
<p>We are a great country and a great people.Â  We believe in family, in community; in doing things for love, not just money; and living our ideals.</p>
<p>May we all be nearer to our best selves in 2014, government included.</p>
<p>So Happy New Year Australia.</p>
<p>1 January 2014</p>
