    <content><![CDATA[<p>I am pleased to announce an additional $8 million over two years for the Country Women's Association (CWA) to meet ongoing demand for assistance.</p>
<p>The Australian Government has this financial year already provided $4 million to the CWA to distribute emergency grants to families and community organisations in drought affected areas.</p>
<p>The Australian Government will continue to support rural families and communities during this difficult time.  As there appears no likelihood of demand abating in the near future, I have agreed to a further $8 million being provided immediately to the CWA in recognition of the needs of rural families and communities during the severe drought.</p>
<p>I applaud the work done by the CWA to date in distributing grants of up to $2000 to families to cover household essentials and up to $3000 for community organisations to fund activities that provide support to drought affected communities.</p>
