PERCY GRAINGER FESTIVAL<br />
Statement by the Primie Minister, Mr. John Gorton<br />
The Commonwealth has approved financial assistance for the<br />
Percy Grainger Festival which is at present taking place in London.<br />
An approach for assistance was received from Sir William McKie,<br />
an Australian now retired in England, who is one of the Vice-Presidents<br />
of the Festival, and Mr. Bryan Fairfax, also an Australian living in<br />
London, who has organised the Festival.<br />
On the recommendation of the Advisory Board, Commonwealth<br />
Assistance to Australian Composers ( Sir Bernard Heinze, Chairman)<br />
the Commonwealth Government has approved a sum of 500. This<br />
represents more than half the amount which the organisers were<br />
seeking to ensure the financial success of the Festival.<br />
