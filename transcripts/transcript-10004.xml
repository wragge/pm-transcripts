    <content><![CDATA[<p>APEC BUSINESS ADVISORY COUNCIL </p>
<p>The Government is committed to strengthening APEC and Australia's economic and other links with the Asia-Pacific region. </p>
<p>I am very pleased, therefore, to announce that my personal representatives on the APEC Business Advisory Council ( ABAC) will be:</p>
<p>- Mr Ian Webber, Chairman of Mayne Nickless Limited<br />
- Mrs lInelda Roche, Co-Chairnan of Nutri-Metics International.<br />
- Mr Michael Crouch, Chairman and Managing Director of Zip Industries<br />
Australia </p>
<p>Each brings to the Council extensive business experience in the region, good standing among the Australian business community and a sense of vision about what Australian business can achieve. </p>
<p>APEC leaders agreed in Osaka last November to establish the Council in order to provide advice on business perspectives and priorities for APEC activities. Each leader agreed to appoint three ABAC epresentatives covering the broad spectrum of business interests, including small and medium sized enterprises. </p>
<p>The Council will help ensure that the business community is more actively and directly involved in APEC. APEC has done well in setting the right policy directions and achieving the political commitment to free trade and investment in the region. It must now focus on delivering practical results by removing the impediments standing in the way of business. </p>
<p>I would also like to take this opportunity to thank Philip Brass for the valuable contribution he made over the past two years as one of Australia's representatives on the Pacific Business Forum ( PBF), the predecessor to the APEC Business Advisory Council.<br />
