CH-ECKZ AGAI'" ST DELIVERY -SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
OPENING OF TELESCOPE AT SIDING SPRING OBSERVATORY<br />
WEDNESDAY 16 MAY 1984<br />
I am delighted to be here today on Siding Springj M'ountain tc.<br />
perform the official opening of this new optical telescope.<br />
The ANU is to be congratulated for its initiative in<br />
developing this telescope which sets new international<br />
standards in astronomical engineering and is the most<br />
advanced optical telescope ever built.<br />
There are good reasons for Australians to be pr'oud of this<br />
achievement. The design and development of the telescope is very<br />
much R co-operative Australian venture<br />
Apart from several components which could not be<br />
manufactured in Australia, construction took place<br />
in the ANU's own workshops and involved a large<br />
number of Australian engineering firms, supply ,2nd<br />
service companies and consultants.<br />
The astronomers, engineers and technicians at Mount Stromlo<br />
and Siding Spring observatories, with the support of the ANU<br />
and co-operation of industry, have created a facility which<br />
clearly demonstrates Australia's capacity to contribute to<br />
the advancement of high technology.<br />
The telescope is a particular tribute to the<br />
entrepreneurship of Professor Mathewson, for it is he who<br />
sought out the elemen-ts from a variety of sources and has<br />
been responsible for their synthesis into an impressive<br />
piece of research equipment.<br />
In these times of rapid change and the tendency to measure<br />
our performance in termns of international comparisons, I<br />
cannot but feel that we often give insufficient credit to<br />
the many excellent achievements, of which this telescope is<br />
an example, quietly taking place within Australia. </p>
<p>2.<br />
Allow me therefore to highlight, without getting technical,<br />
some aspects of this facility which makes it so important<br />
and provides many lessons concerning Australian initiative,<br />
ingenuity and dedication of individuals.<br />
Let me at the outset refer to the factors which led to the<br />
construction of the 2.3 metre telescope. As the admirable<br />
booklet distributed today notes, the main factors were:<br />
An acute shortage of observing time<br />
the need for a large telescope versatile enough to<br />
take-full advantage of modern instrumentation<br />
the lack of advanced facilities for the training of<br />
students, and<br />
a desire to stimulate the development of astronomy<br />
in Australia.<br />
With these factors in mind, the original specifications<br />
called for a versatile, precise, and efficient telescope,<br />
equipped with advanced astronomical instrumentation, but<br />
costing a fraction of the price of a conventional telescope.<br />
The end result stands before us.<br />
The convergence of interest of the scientific and<br />
technological communities has produced a facility of<br />
unprecedented versatility and power, bold in concept,<br />
elegant in design and professional in implementation.<br />
At a time when up-to-date research equipment is difficult to<br />
fund, it is good to find an instance where the cost of major<br />
equipment has been contained in such a creative manner.<br />
This facility is noteably different from other comparable<br />
facilities. The different physical appearance of the facility, compared<br />
with the other telescope structures on this mountain, is<br />
immediately apparent.<br />
the building is cubical and rotates with the<br />
teles cope inside allowing the building to be much<br />
smaller and considerably less costly than the<br />
conventional domed astronomical telescope buildina.<br />
Other important differences between the 2.3 metre telescope<br />
and its predecessors are its alt-azimuth mounting and its<br />
thin mirror which allow a lighter structure, with consequent<br />
reduction in complexity and cost. </p>
<p>And the final aspect of design of particular note is that<br />
the control computer has been integrated into the telescope<br />
systems so thoroughly that it is capable of controlling all<br />
of the building and telescope functions.<br />
The telescope has already attracted attention<br />
internationally with visits by Japanese, Italian, American,<br />
British, and Dutch scientists and engineers interested in<br />
building similar telescopes in their own countries.<br />
Its great advantage is its simplicity and relatively low<br />
cost. Countries, which previously could not afford to build<br />
conventional telescopes, can now participate in astronomical<br />
research. In this respect, it is pleasing to note that<br />
several countries in our own region have shown interest in<br />
the telescope.<br />
The development of this facility enhances the AN1U's position<br />
as a leading institution in the field of astronomy. Its two<br />
observatories, at Mount Stromlo and here at Siding Spring,<br />
together form one of the world's major optical astronomical<br />
installations. In scientific terms, the work of the<br />
observatories places the ANU amongst the world's leaders.<br />
Australians are proud of the achievements of Australian<br />
astronomy. The radio telescope on the $ 50 bill and John<br />
Tebbutt on the $ 100 bill are elequent testimony to this.<br />
One reason Australia is'-so prominant in international<br />
astronomy is because we have had men who have had the<br />
foresight to push for the establishment of world class<br />
observatories. Optical astronomy has grown in Australia as a result of<br />
facilities established by two pioneers:<br />
O r W. G. Duffield, who established Mount Stromlo<br />
Observatory, and<br />
Dr B. J. Bok, who established Siding Spring<br />
Observatory<br />
Duffield first conceived of an Australian observatory when,<br />
as a young Australian studying spectroscopy at the physical<br />
laboratory of the University of Manchester in 1905, he<br />
attended the Oxford meeting of the Irternational Union for<br />
Solar Research. The enthusiasm kindled at that time<br />
sustained him through the next two decades.<br />
Mount Stromlo was selected as the site of the new<br />
observatory in 1910. The Commonwealth Solar Observatory, as<br />
it was first known, was put into operation in 1925 and the<br />
observatory buildings on Mount Stromlo were occupied by the<br />
end of 1926.<br />
Duffield died suddenly in 1929. </p>
<p>Bart. Bok, who died only last August, was a dynamic person<br />
who did a great deal to stimulate the development of<br />
astronomy in Australia. In particular he will be remembered<br />
for his highly successful attempts to build one of the<br />
world's best graduate schools and for the establishment of<br />
Siding Spring Observatory. Bok put an immense amount of<br />
effort into bringing astronomy before the public. He toured<br />
Australia incessantly, making at least one trip per month to<br />
outlying towns, and, when invited to speak to groups such as<br />
Rotary or Apex, his reply was invariably " Yes,' as long as I<br />
can also have one hour with the high-school students".<br />
As you would a-11 know the Southern skies provide a<br />
particularly great stellar variety.<br />
Bok campaigned tirelessly for a large southern hemisphere<br />
telescope, and his efforts are widely acknowledged as having'<br />
played a seminal role in the * establishement of the<br />
Anglo-Australian observatory.<br />
Bok's foresight in establishing Siding Spring Observatory<br />
has been one of the major Factors that has allowed<br />
Australian astronomy to preserve its place in international<br />
science, even though our monopoly on the southern hemisphere<br />
facilities no longer exists.<br />
What of the future?<br />
The new telescope will play a key role in the exploration of<br />
the universe. Complete computer control. may allow, in the<br />
not-too-distant future, astronomers in different parts of<br />
the world to make use of the telescope through satellite<br />
hook-up.<br />
Space technology offers considerable attractions, not only<br />
for Australian astronomical research but. for Australia<br />
generally. In many ways, Australia is naturally suited, with ' Its large<br />
land mass, extensive resource base and communication<br />
requirements, to the application of space technology.<br />
As in astronomy, Australia has shown the! ability to<br />
undentake research and develop space science initiatives<br />
equal to any in the world. We have the latent capability to<br />
develop a national space science and technology effort<br />
comparable with those of other advanced economies.<br />
The potential exists in Australia for a viable level of<br />
activity in this area.<br />
We have a respectable base level of skills and resources in<br />
areas related to space' technology, although these assets are<br />
dispersed widely in industry, research institutions,<br />
Government establishments and as Australians in overseas<br />
space industry. </p>
<p>In the main, we have awaited the development and<br />
demonstration of space technology overseas before purchasing<br />
it for our own use. This approach has enabled the various<br />
agencies charged with servicing community needs to adopt<br />
space technology for our requirements with efficiency and<br />
alacrity. In many respects, this approach has served us<br />
well. But of course such an approach does not allow us to develop<br />
fully our space science and technology capabilities. It<br />
ignores the benefits, in terms of technology development and<br />
domestic and international market participation, to be<br />
gained from ha-ving a local space manufacturing industry.<br />
Canada had its own communication satellite in orbit 23 years<br />
ago the world's first. This is a good example of what can<br />
be done in this area by a middle sized nation. What needs<br />
to be established is whether priority should be given to<br />
such activity. This, crucially, must depend on an<br />
appreciation of the net benefits flowing from such activity.<br />
Any assessment of this requires that we consider carefully<br />
as a first step the prerequisites for success in this area.<br />
The pre-requisites for achieving such capabilities can be<br />
perceived clearly in the strategies pursued by countries<br />
such as Canada, Japan and France. They are:<br />
Commitment by Government to the development of a<br />
national capability<br />
The setting up of high level advisory bodies to<br />
articulate national goals, select priorities and<br />
develop long-term planning and budgets<br />
The establishment of centres of' space R and D in<br />
Government agencies or universities ( with<br />
subsequent transfer of technology to or use of<br />
facilities by local industry)<br />
The emergence of locally owned industries capable<br />
of accepting major subcontracts from prime<br />
contractors, and<br />
Co-operation in large scale inter-governmental<br />
programs providing transfer or development of<br />
expertise in local industry, in space and related<br />
a re as<br />
Whether and to what extent Australia should move to meet<br />
such prerequisites and pursue the development of a local<br />
industry, is a question to which there is no automatic or<br />
self-evident answer. -The costs and benefits of doing so<br />
need to be carefully weighed. </p>
<p>A commitment of national resources to space science and<br />
technology on a scale sufficient to establish a viable local<br />
industry or even to fund particular space projects must be<br />
considered against other priority areas of technology<br />
identified by the Government and of interest to industry.<br />
An important step towards addressing the local industry<br />
question was the convening in March this year of the<br />
national space symposium.<br />
The objectives of the symposium, some of you will recall,<br />
were to: Identify what Australia's existing capabilities are<br />
Consider where we, as a nation, desirelto go in the.<br />
future Identify public arrangements by which industry and<br />
research agencies can profit from future<br />
developments Discuss possible options for Government.<br />
As a result of the symposium, the possibility of<br />
establishing a working group representing relevant interests<br />
is being considered. Such a group could identify a set of<br />
goals for Australia and recommend on a structure to<br />
implement them. I<br />
There is an international as well as domestic dimension to<br />
our interests in outer space. Australia has a long and<br />
proud tradition of international co-operation in space<br />
matters, reflected in the fact that we were founder members<br />
of the United Nations Committee on the peaceful uses of<br />
outer space. Even now, an Australian Professor John<br />
Carver, Director of the Research School of Physical Sciences<br />
at the ANU is Chairman of the important Scientific and<br />
Technical Sub-committee.<br />
These committees are involved in a wide range of space<br />
activities which directly affect Australian interests and<br />
include remote sensing, communication, resource management<br />
and development and such areas as astronomical research and<br />
meteorology. New areas are being explored such as search<br />
and rescue satellites.<br />
The most urgent task posed by our representation in the<br />
Committee on Peaceful Uses of Outer Space appears to be a<br />
requirement for strong co-ordination of Government<br />
involvement in space activities. I intend raising this<br />
matter with relevant ministers with a view to examining how<br />
we might organise better our involvement with that<br />
Committee. Improved co-ordination will, among other things,<br />
allow us to move quickly to take advantage of opportunities<br />
to further our interests internationally. </p>
<p>Finally, before concluding, I should like to pay tribute to<br />
the manifest commitment to excellence apparent in-so much of<br />
the work of those associated with space activities. Your<br />
endeavours in quite unprecedented fashion probe the<br />
frontiers of human knowledge and experience.<br />
that you have been able to do so with such conspicuous<br />
success, reflects well on some of the strengths which have<br />
in the past been evident in our education system.<br />
We are, however, now at a critical juncture in the<br />
development of that system.<br />
The Government is currently considering both the Schools<br />
Commission Report on Funding Policies for Australian<br />
Schools, and the Commonwealth Tertiary Education Commission.<br />
Report on Funding Arrangements for the Universities next<br />
triennium. With Susan Ryan, the Minister for Education, I<br />
have been closely involved in an intensive round of<br />
consultations on the issues and options involved.<br />
The problems posed in defining our educational priorities<br />
for the years ahead and in funding these are considerable.<br />
Nevertheless, as I know you would all agree, the decisions<br />
taken will significantly effect our capacity to improve the<br />
technological skills of our work force, and ultimately<br />
improve our living standards.<br />
Professor Karmel, Vice-Chancellor of the Australian National<br />
University, recently addressed this matter of priorities in<br />
a thought-provoking, and realistic fashionn when he said:<br />
" My priorities are for more resources to raise<br />
educational participation in post-compulsory schooling<br />
and tertiary education, to establish a rational training<br />
system, and for such re-allocation of existing resources<br />
as is necessary to raise the minimum competencies to be<br />
achieved during compulsory schooling; until these have<br />
been achieved, demands for richer provisions per teacher<br />
or per pupil will have to be postponed".<br />
This I think gets us back to the basics. Our education<br />
system must be geared, again as Professor Karmel has said,<br />
to pr'ovide for-the contemporary demands for a more highly<br />
qualified workforce, for workers with communications skills<br />
and ability to deal with people, and for men-and women who,<br />
with necessary scientific and technical training, will<br />
contribute to the successful management of technological<br />
change. Certainly this Government is at one with Professor Karmel in<br />
acknowledging the essential need for an educational system<br />
which will at once provide for excellence and, at the same<br />
time, equip all Australians for the tasks of contemporary<br />
life. </p>
<p>Our judgements on education funding will reflect this<br />
approach. Obviously this implies continued support for a national<br />
research effort. That support will, however, necessarily<br />
have to be selective.<br />
If we are to maintain our lead, or indeed survive in a wide<br />
range of national endeavours, whether they be pure science<br />
or new technology for industry, it is necessary for us to<br />
identify the best and most forward-looking research workers,<br />
and ensure that their excellence and enterprise are properly<br />
supported.-If we make quality and opportunity our key criteria for<br />
support, then the results will flow back to the'nation as a.<br />
whole, whether by way of advancement of scientific<br />
knowledge, or national prestige, or a vigorous economy based<br />
on technologically aware and up-to-date industries.<br />
Australia can lead the world in those areas where we focus<br />
our attention and exert our will and enterprise<br />
This telescope provides no better proof.<br />
