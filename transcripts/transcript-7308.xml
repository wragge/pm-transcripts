PRIME MINISTER<br />
CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
CONFERENCE ON " HEALTHY PUBLIC POLICYO<br />
ADELAIDE 5 APRIL 1988<br />
Dr Blewett,<br />
Dr Mahler, Director-General, World Health Organisation,<br />
Ladies and Gentlemen.<br />
It is a pleasure to welcome you to Australia and to open the<br />
Second International Conference on Health Promotion.<br />
In 1988 Australians are celebrating the Bicentenary of<br />
European settlement of this country. It is a landmark of<br />
which we are proud, both because it encourages us as<br />
Australians to reflect both on our achievements over the<br />
last 200 years and on our shortcomings and because of the<br />
opportunity which it brings for so many overseas visitors to<br />
come to know Australia better.<br />
Australia is becoming increasingly recognised around the<br />
world as a tourist destination of unparalleled excellence.<br />
Last year we played host to nearly 2 million visitors.<br />
According to the OECD our visitor arrivals were up<br />
27 per cent on 1986 a rate of growth nearly five times the<br />
OECD average.<br />
So I hope you will be able to find time apart from your<br />
duties at this conference to travel around Australia a<br />
little to experience for yourselves the reasons for this<br />
great upswing in international attention.<br />
If you do fly interstate, you will probably notice and, I<br />
hope, notice with approval a recent initiative in<br />
preventive health my Government has taken.<br />
In line with the objectives of the National Campaign Against<br />
Drug Abuse, and supported by widespread medical evidence, my<br />
Government decided last year to ban completely all smoking<br />
on board domestic airlines.<br />
We believe that decision made us only the second country in<br />
the world to impose such a ban. Through this conference,<br />
other nations might be encouragqd to take similar steps.<br />
As well as being our Bicentennial year, 1988 is also the<br />
anniversary of the World Health Organisation. 0055263 </p>
<p>In those forty years, the World Health Organisation and its<br />
member states have, through joint planning and concerted<br />
effort, brought about a number of significant improvements<br />
in the health of people throughout the world.<br />
In some cases the improvements have been dramatic, such as<br />
the reduction in the incidence of epidemic and endemic<br />
diseases including not least the eradication of small pox.<br />
The WHO has also helped improve water supplies and<br />
sanitation in developing countries, and conducted campaigns<br />
against conmmunicable diseases.<br />
Since the Second World War, most industrial nations have<br />
seen considerable improvements in the health of their<br />
people. They are better fed, enjoy better conditions of<br />
hygiene and have seen their life expectancy substantially<br />
extended. In particular, improvements in maternal and child health<br />
have been remarkable, with better family planning, lower<br />
infant mortality, widespread immunization, and significant<br />
improvement in the nutrition of children.<br />
But in developing nations, the vicious problems of poverty,<br />
malnutrition, disease and despair continue. To quote just<br />
one tragic indicator of this, infant mortality: in some<br />
developing countries, more than 200 out of every 1000<br />
children born die before their first birthday.<br />
The World Health Organisation fully deserves our continuing<br />
support in its efforts to resolve the health problems which<br />
continue to afflict too many of our fellow human beings.<br />
It is important however that this support should derive not<br />
only from the variobus member states of WHO. Co-operation by<br />
the various institutions of each nation is also required,<br />
since there is increasing recognition that responsibility<br />
for good health is shared by governments, industry,<br />
education and research institutions and, of course, by<br />
families and individuals.<br />
In 1978 the ** Orld Health Assembly launched a global strategy<br />
for health for all by the year 2000. In response, over the<br />
last decade many countries have been redefining their health<br />
policies in terms of goals and targets which could<br />
realistically be achieved by the year 2000.<br />
my colleague the Australian minister for Community Services<br />
and Health, Dr Neal Blewett, will later this week present<br />
this Conference with the Australian response to this<br />
strategy.<br />
While as a developed country we have good reason to be<br />
confident in. the quality of our health care, we recognise<br />
that there is much we can do to ensure Australia is a<br />
healthier place by the year 2000. 005527 </p>
<p>As a developed country we have eliminated many of the healkt,<br />
threats our grandparents faced. But.-in their place, new<br />
problems have arisen, problems which arise in part from our<br />
economic well-being. 6<br />
Health problems such as those caused by stress, diet,<br />
failure to immunize, and catastrophic traffic injuries loom<br />
as unresolved threats to the overall health of our nation.<br />
In particular and it is highly relevant to note this<br />
during our Bicentennial year the health levels of our<br />
Aboriginal citizens are generally well below an acceptable<br />
level.<br />
Aboriginal infant mortality, while declining, is still about<br />
three times the rate of the non-Aboriginal population. Life<br />
expectancy of adult Aboriginal people is some 20 years less<br />
than for the wider community.<br />
This year the various State and Territory Governments, with<br />
the Commonwealth Government, have for the first time in our<br />
history agreed to act together to tackle this urgent task.<br />
We have now set up a joint Commonwealth/ State Working Party<br />
to develop a National Aboriginal Health Strategy.<br />
It is my belief that Australians cannot adequately celebrate<br />
the Bicentenary of European settlement without some better<br />
acknowledgement of the Aboriginal people who inhabited this<br />
land for more than 40,000 years before 1788.<br />
Since poor health levels are, in many respects, a by-product<br />
of European settlement, an important element in this<br />
acknowledgement must be a new determination. to improve<br />
Aboriginal health.<br />
My Government is committed to action to improve Aboriginal<br />
health and the working party is an essential step in that<br />
process. In the forty years since the establishment of WHO our very<br />
notions of what constitutes good health, and in particular<br />
what causes it and how best to attain it, have undergone<br />
considerable changes and developments.<br />
Good health care policy whether conducted by Governments<br />
or by individuals is no longer seen purely as the<br />
treatment of pre-existing illnesses. Disease prevention and<br />
health promotion are now regarded, rightly, as integral<br />
elements of an overall approach.<br />
It was in response to this broadening notion that the WHO<br />
convened the first International Conference on Health<br />
Promotion in Ottawa in 1986 and this, the second conference,<br />
in Adelaide. 005528 </p>
<p>The concept of health promotion enunciatedi in Ottawa<br />
emphasises the needs to build healthy public policies,<br />
create supportive environments, strengthen community action,<br />
develop personal skills and reorient health services.<br />
The Adelaide Conference should, and I believe will, make<br />
further progress towards these goals. The repretentation of<br />
so many countries and the broad range of expertise brought<br />
to this Conference will help lead to the development of<br />
healthy public policy throughout the world.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen,<br />
The decision to hold the Conference in Australia is, in<br />
part, a recognition of Australia's achievements in the<br />
health arena in treatment and in prevention of disease.<br />
The principal feature of my Government's involvelfent in<br />
health care in Australia has been to ensure thatall<br />
Australians have access to quality medical care in<br />
accordance with their medical needs and irrespective of<br />
their financial circumstances.<br />
Since February 1984, Australians have benefited from<br />
universal insurance against the cost of medical services,<br />
together with access to free hospital care in public<br />
hospitals. Medicare, funded in part through a levy on taxable income,<br />
has been an integral element in ensuring quality health care<br />
is available, on fair terms, to all Australians.<br />
Almost two million people who previously had no health<br />
insurance are now covered by Medicare.<br />
Medicare has delivered real advantages to those on lower<br />
incomes, especially families. An average family is $ 21 a<br />
week better off than it would be under a return to private<br />
insurance cover.<br />
Health care thus forms an integral part of the Government's<br />
approach to the management of the overall economy. In an<br />
era when real restraint has been required in wages, we have<br />
ensured that compensatory improvements in the social wage<br />
have protected living standards as much as possible.<br />
Medicare, along with a new family assistance package,<br />
education reform, real increases in age pensions, increased<br />
resources for public housing and related measures have all<br />
played their part in making Australia a fairer society.<br />
Professionals such as yourselves involved in health policy<br />
making should not, I believe, overlook the fact that<br />
Medicare's universal health insurance helps make Australia a<br />
healthier society as well. 005529 </p>
<p>As Dr Blewett will argue later this week, the Government's<br />
structural reforms aimed at lifting the social wage also<br />
have important benefits for the overall level of health of<br />
Australians. Ladies and gentlemen,<br />
Australia has also distinguished itself in the field of<br />
preventive health care through its campaigns against drug<br />
abuse and the spread of AIDS.<br />
The National Campaign Against Drug Abuse has involved a<br />
major political commitment by all Governments in Australia<br />
to increase greatly the resources devoted to tackling the<br />
problems of drug abuse.<br />
It is not just a health campaign or a law enforcement<br />
campaign. It is truly an example of healthy-public policy<br />
in action.<br />
The campaign has taken an integrated approach, involving<br />
enhanced and expanded treatment and rehabilitation<br />
services in the health arena;<br />
major efforts in preventive education, through<br />
media information and research,-and<br />
law enforcement reform and enhancement of<br />
capacities.<br />
The Campaign did not try to divide up the problems of drug<br />
abuse and focus solely on illegal drugs or alcohol or<br />
tobacco. Rather we have taken an overall approach which<br />
recognises the interlocking nature of many of these<br />
problems. The Campaign has been in progress for three years and the<br />
Government late last year announced a commitment to continue<br />
it for a further three years.<br />
To meet the challenge posed by the spread of AIDS,<br />
Australians recognised a special and innovative relationship<br />
was necessary between Governments and the community. The<br />
Commonwealth Government's three-pronged attack on AIDS<br />
accordingly involves:<br />
Government cost-shared prevention programs<br />
including education;<br />
scientific advice and research; and<br />
community involvement and funding of community<br />
projects. 0 05 </p>
<p>6.<br />
The Government has recently streamlined its advisory<br />
structure by establishing a single National Council on AIDS<br />
to advise on all matters related to AIDS.<br />
The AIDS crisis demanded a radical response. We in<br />
Australia made that response, and the evidence suggests it<br />
is working. Surveys of public knowledge about the<br />
transmission of AIDS indicate growing levels of awareness<br />
among all groups, and significant increases in the numbers<br />
of people who understand what does, and does not, constitute<br />
risk behaviour.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen,<br />
In sketching the broad parameters of these two campaigns I<br />
know I am only touching on issues which will be debated in<br />
much more detail by participants in this conference. J.<br />
I wish you well in those deliberations.<br />
You will tackle issues of the utmost importance to all<br />
countries striving towards better health. The conclusions<br />
you come to will bring us another step closer to enabling<br />
all people to lead economically productive and socially<br />
rewarding lives.<br />
It is my pleasure now to declare this conference open. 005531 </p>
