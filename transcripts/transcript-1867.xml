COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA<br />
SPEECH BY<br />
The Rt Hon. J. G. GORTON, M. P.<br />
ON<br />
PRIME MINISTER'S VISIT ABROAD<br />
Ministerial Statement<br />
[ From the ' Parliamentary Debates', 4 June 1968]<br />
Mr GORTON ( Higgins-Prime Minister)<br />
-by leave-Mr Speaker, the House will be<br />
aware of the circumstances which preceded<br />
my recent vis? t to the United States of<br />
America. Briefly restated, they were that the<br />
visit had been envisaged before President<br />
Johnson made his speech of 31st March.<br />
In that speech he announced that he would<br />
cease bombing over a significant area of<br />
North Vietnam-the most populous areain<br />
the -hope that this restraint might lead to<br />
similar restraints by North Vietnam, and to<br />
the opening of talks with North Vietnam<br />
which might lead to the achievement of an<br />
honourable peace. At that time the President<br />
also announced that as an earnest of his<br />
sincere desire to achieve a just and honourable<br />
peace bhe had decided to devote his<br />
energies to that end and would relinquish<br />
his chances of re-election by withdrawing<br />
his name from nomination as the Democratic<br />
Presidential candidate at the next<br />
elections. I was -in doubt, in these circumstances, as<br />
to whether that projected visit by me should<br />
take place. But President Johnson urged me<br />
to come and because the visit would give me<br />
a chance to get to ' know the -man who will be<br />
President until 20th January 1969, and to<br />
get to know same of the men who may<br />
17655/ 68 succeed him in that office after that date, I<br />
thought that it would be of value to myself<br />
and to the Government and to Australia to<br />
make the visit. I believe that the visit justified<br />
that judgment. I have had the opportunity<br />
to speak to, and to get to ' know, the<br />
President and members of the present<br />
administration-the Secretary of Defence,<br />
the Secretary of State, the Secretary of the<br />
Treasury and many others. Indeed I had, in<br />
all, six separate meeting periods with the<br />
President, either alone or with members of<br />
his Cabinet. These, I think, covered an<br />
amount of time which had not previously<br />
been set aside by any President for a visit<br />
of an Australian Prime Minister.<br />
I did not believe that the visit would<br />
result in any new, dramatic, developments<br />
but I1 did think that it would give me an<br />
opportunity ' to assess the fears, sometimes<br />
experienced and expressed in this and other<br />
countries, that the United States might lose<br />
interest in -the. area of South ' East Asia,<br />
might return to a form of isolationism. I<br />
have had the opportunity to assess the<br />
validity of those fears, Mr Speaker, I believe<br />
they are groundless. In developing my<br />
reasons for that judgment, I should like to<br />
quote first from the remarks which I made<br />
on arrival at the White; House, and secondly </p>
<p>2<br />
from the speech in reply which the President,<br />
later that day, gave. On behalf of<br />
the Australian Government I1sa id:<br />
As Australians see it, the problems of the future,<br />
although worldwide, are likely to be most acute<br />
in Asia. We see there an area which needs an<br />
economic and technical base such as Europe<br />
already has. We see there an area where development<br />
and progress are essential if the peoples of<br />
these divergent nations are to support and defend<br />
something dynamic and developing-not something<br />
stagnant. ' We see there an area crying for technical<br />
skills, a more experienced administration, a more<br />
equitable sharing of an increasing -income-and<br />
we see there an area subject, above all, to the<br />
threat of subversion, terrorism and aggression.<br />
Perhaps, Mr President, though I don't think so,<br />
we Australians see this out of perspective-because<br />
it is here that we, contiguous to Asia-part of<br />
the South ' East Asia region-live and breathe and<br />
have our present and our future. It is here that<br />
we feel that we can best contribute to stability and<br />
progress and to preserving political freedom which<br />
has economic freedom as its goal. it is here that<br />
we can play our part-but we cannot effectively<br />
play it alone.<br />
I hope the House would agree that this is<br />
Australia's approach to the region of Asia<br />
in which we live; it is certainly the Government's<br />
approach, and I believe it to be the<br />
proper approach-that we should want to<br />
see stability in the region to our north,<br />
that we should want to see economic progress<br />
in the north, that we should do what<br />
we can to achieve those objectives, but what<br />
we cannot alone see them effectively<br />
achieved in the time in which they ought<br />
to be achieved. That was an expression of<br />
the Australian Government's interest in the<br />
area and of what we believe should be done<br />
there, and indeed an indication that we feel<br />
the United States has a duty to help in that<br />
approach and that attitude in that area.<br />
That night the President replied to these<br />
remarks and I quote two passages from his<br />
speech: I know there are some in Asia and elsewhere<br />
who are wondering tonight whether the United<br />
States will maintain its commitments in Asia;<br />
who are wondering tonight whether the strain of<br />
the struggle in Vietnam will lead the United<br />
States to withdraw and leave two thirds of<br />
humanity to its fate without American assistance<br />
or American support. I cannot speak for<br />
my successor but I can speak for myself and the<br />
answer is no.<br />
America will not withdraw. The second<br />
passage I quote from the President's speech<br />
is this:<br />
In the years ahead we in the United States<br />
hope that the new Asia that is being born will<br />
be increasingly organised to shape its own destiny. It should be able to do more for itself and rely<br />
less on the U. S. But I have no doubts that there<br />
will be no return here to isolationism.<br />
The President went on to point out how in<br />
Administration after Administration since<br />
1941, whether the Administration had been<br />
Democratic or Republican, the same thread<br />
had run through the approach of all the<br />
United States Presidents, that there was a<br />
duty and an obligation, to maintain an<br />
interest in this part of the world, to give,<br />
where it was required, military assistance<br />
against attack, but above all to seek to<br />
raise the economic living standards of the<br />
peoples in the area so that they would be<br />
the more able themselves to resist any<br />
threatened attack, so that they would be<br />
the more able themselves to help themselves<br />
to provide a better standard of living for<br />
their people.<br />
Mr Speaker, -these public statements, and<br />
the private conversations with the President<br />
and his Cabinet which occurred, have left<br />
me in no doubt-and this is a judgment<br />
which is only to be taken as a judgmentthat<br />
the present Administration will continue<br />
the struggle in Vietnam until a peace<br />
which assures the South Vietnamese a<br />
chance to choose to elect -their own Government,<br />
free from threat, is secured. And<br />
they have left me in no doubt that the<br />
present Administration will continue its<br />
interest in, and its help for, the South East<br />
Asian region. But this is an Administration<br />
which is in office only until January next<br />
yeiar-although this is some 7 months -a-way<br />
-and it is a reasonable and proper question<br />
to ask: What will the attitude of the United<br />
States be after that date? I can only say<br />
that I have had the opportunity to hold face<br />
to face discussions with Vice President<br />
Humphrey, who is a candidate for the<br />
Democratic nomination for President, with<br />
Governor Rockefeller, who is a Republican<br />
candidate for nomination for President, and<br />
to hold a conversation-unfortunately by<br />
telephone, not face -to face-with Mr<br />
Nixon who is the other Republican candidate<br />
for President.<br />
After these contacts, my own assessment<br />
-and that is all it can be-is that I do<br />
not believe, should any of these candidates<br />
be successful, that there would be any basic<br />
change in the interest of the United States<br />
in this region. I do not believe that there<br />
would be any retreat to isolationism, and </p>
<p>if this assessment is true it is an important<br />
factor on which Australia's future decisions<br />
should be based.<br />
The visit helped us in getting background<br />
to assist in the formulation of our own<br />
decisions as to what we can and should<br />
do in this area in the future, for our security<br />
in the future is bound up with, and cannot<br />
be disentangled from, the security and<br />
stability of the whole of the region in which<br />
we live. It is necessary for us in those circumstances<br />
to make our own decisions as<br />
to what we can do to bring about security<br />
and stability in the region; but in making<br />
those decisions we cannot but be affected<br />
by judgment as to what others will do for<br />
the same purposes in the same area.<br />
The assessments which I have made have<br />
helped us, I think, towards formulating<br />
those future decisions so important for the<br />
area and so important for ourselves. There<br />
are other matters still to be judged and still<br />
to be assessed; other discussions still to be<br />
held-such as the five power talks in which<br />
we will participate-but at least I feel that<br />
some of the imponderables, some of the<br />
unknown factors of which the Minister for<br />
Defence ( Mr Fairhiall) recently spoke, have,<br />
as a result of this visit, been able to be<br />
better assessed by the Government.<br />
The talks held in Washington ranged over<br />
a wide compass. They covered the present<br />
situation in Vietnam, they covered the progress<br />
or lack of progress at the preliminary<br />
talks at present proceeding in Paris, they<br />
covered the broader aspects of regional<br />
security-not only military but economic<br />
security-and they covered the problems<br />
caused by the announced British withdrawal<br />
from South East Asia. They were essentially<br />
private talks in many aspects. But I<br />
would say to the House that I formed a<br />
judgment firstly, that the United States, as<br />
I have said, would continue to have a presence<br />
and an interest in the area of South<br />
East Asia; secondly, that the Paris talks<br />
were making little or no progress but at<br />
least were continuing and that the United<br />
States was not prepared to accede to what<br />
President Johnson has called a fake peace<br />
in Vietnam; thirdly, that the United States was as interested as we are not only in<br />
providing military assistance to threatened<br />
countries but also in helping them to help<br />
themselves economically; fourthly, that the<br />
British withdrawal from the Malaysia-<br />
Singapore area caused them some considerable<br />
disquiet in that they felt that the<br />
stability in that area might by that withdrawal<br />
be impaired; and fifthly, that the<br />
ANZUS pact has a real and genuine meaning<br />
and is the greatest guarantee that Australia<br />
itself has against aggression. Its<br />
application to areas outside the Pacific area<br />
is not so definite as is its application to<br />
ourselves; but neither should its application<br />
to areas outside the Pacific area be discounted.<br />
Mr Speaker, these may be modest conclusions<br />
from a visit of not long duration<br />
but the purposes of the visit were themselves<br />
modest. Those purposes were to seek<br />
assessments of the matters of which I have<br />
spoken which were amongst, but were not<br />
all of, the imponderables and unknown<br />
factors of which the Minister for Defence<br />
spoke in his speech on defence. But the conclusions<br />
reached, together with those which<br />
we shall draw in the future from the progress<br />
of the five power talks shortly to be<br />
held, will be those conclusions on which<br />
our future defence and economic assistance<br />
plans will be predicated. Those plans cannot<br />
be projected into the future yet for the<br />
future is as yet too unknown.<br />
But I think-and on this note I conclude<br />
the report of the visit, Mr Speaker-that<br />
some progress has been made in helping<br />
us to assess and to judge data on which we<br />
shall in the future make our decisions.<br />
Those decisions, based on this and the other<br />
conclusions which we draw from other discussions,<br />
will lead us at the appropriate<br />
time, when we have what we regard as<br />
sufficient on which to make judgments, to<br />
come to the Parliament and to present to<br />
the Parliament what the future plans of the<br />
Australian Government will be for the protection<br />
and the advancement of the region<br />
in which we live. And this is of the essence<br />
of the protection and the progress of the<br />
country which we represent.<br />
