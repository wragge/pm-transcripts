PRIME MINISTER ' 72/ 92<br />
JOINT STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J<br />
KEATING, MP AND THE MINISTER FOR EMPLOYMENT, EDUCATION<br />
AND TRAINING, THE HON KIM BEAZLEY, MP.<br />
A new national vocational education and training system<br />
will be established following an historic agreement<br />
reached between the Commonwealth, State and Territory<br />
Governments today.<br />
The Prime Minister, Mr Keating, said the new system would<br />
give vocational education in Australia a truly national<br />
focus. It will centre on a Council of Ministers and a new body<br />
the Australian National Training Authority ( ANTA).<br />
The Commonwealth and all States and Territories will<br />
channel their funding for training through ANTA, creating<br />
a genuinely national system.<br />
The system will provide assured funding arrangements, a<br />
consistent national approach to training, close<br />
involvement of industry, and a high quality network of<br />
training providers.<br />
There will be more opportunities for young people, and<br />
higher quality training for industry.<br />
On the basis of the agreement reached today, the<br />
Commonwealth will provide, over the next three years, the<br />
additional $ 720 million for vocational education outlined<br />
in the One Nation statement in February.<br />
The States have agreed to at least maintain their current<br />
level of effort for vocational education and training.<br />
The five member board of ANTA will be made up of<br />
acknowledged independent experts, appointed by the<br />
Ministorial Counicil. ANTA will be a Commonwealth statuory<br />
authority. </p>
<p>2<br />
Its key functions will include: formulation of a national<br />
strategic plan; provision of advice to the Ministerial<br />
Council on funding levels and distribution; and direct<br />
planning involvement with State agencies to ensure<br />
efficient and high quality service.<br />
A document providing details of the new arrangements is<br />
being released with this statement.<br />
