NOTES FOR THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR CLERMONT AND EMERALD, QLD.<br />
29 NOVEMBER 1974<br />
1. IWAS LAST IN EMERALD -THIS RICH AND BEAUTIFUL REGION OF<br />
CENTRAL WESTERN QUEENSLAND IN THE EARLY 1960' s. I REMEMBER<br />
FONDLY THE HOSPITALITY OF THE PEOPLE OF THIS DISTRICT. LAST<br />
WEEK THE NATIONAL PARTY SENT ME A TELEGRAM TELLING ME TO CANCEL<br />
MY VISIT. I REPLIED PROMPTLY AND IN NO UNCERTAIN TERMS. I WILL<br />
NOT BE DETERRED FROM MEETING AND DISCUSSING MATTERS OF IMPORTANCE<br />
WITH QUEENSLANDERS BECAUSE OF A HANDFUL OF ROWDY DEMONSTRATORS<br />
ORGANISED BY THE NATIONAL PARTY. THE HOOLIGANISM, THE ROWDINESS,<br />
THE DOWNRIGHT OBSCENITY OF A FEW HOOLIGANS IS QUITE FOREIGN TO<br />
QUEENSLAND. IT IS REJECTED BY THE VAST MAJORITY OF DECENT<br />
PEOPLE OF THIS STATE.<br />
2. I WELCOME THE OPPORTUNITY TO LEARN MORE ABOUT YOUR DISTRICT, YOUR<br />
LOCAL NEEDS AND PROBLEMS. A CAMPAIGN IS A GOOD TIME TO GET A<br />
MESSAGE AS WELL AS GIVING A MESSAGE. IT AMAZES ME THAT WE HEAR<br />
SO MUCH SCARE TALK AND NONSENSE FROM MR. BJELKE-PETERSEN ABOUT<br />
CENTRALISM, . OUR POLICIES ON LOCAL GOVERNMENT GIVE THE LIE TO"<br />
THIS TALK. WE ARE DOING MORE TO HELP LOCAL COUNCILS UPGRADE<br />
THEIR SERVICES AND AMENITIES THAN ANY GOVERNMENT BEFORE US.<br />
THIS YEAR, ON THE RECOMMENDATION OF THE GRANTS COMMISSION, WE<br />
APPROVED DIRECT GRANTS TO LOCAL GOVERNMENT THROUGHOUT AUSTRALIA<br />
TOTALLING % 56.3 MILLION. QUEENSLAND' S SHARE IS $ 8.9 MILLION.<br />
EmERALD is RECEiviNG $ 92,000. No FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS EVER<br />
GIVEN DIRECT GRANTS TO LOCAL GOVERNMENT BEFORE. AND THAT MONEY<br />
CAN BE SPENT IN ANY WAY THE LOCAL COUNCILS WISH.<br />
712 3 AIj1A4~ dL 7L 7 t0&amp; L4 ' Y .1s2 </p>
<p>REMEMBER WHAT OUR OPPONENTS USED TO SAY BEFORE WE AMENDED THE<br />
GRANTS COMMISSION ACT TO MAKE THESE GRANTS POSSIBLE: CANBERRA<br />
WOULD BE TAKING OVER LOCAL COUNCILS AND CONTROLLING THEIR<br />
PURSE STRINGS. CANBERRA'S TENTACLES WOULD BE REACHING INTO<br />
EVERY SHIRE AND MUNICIPALITY IN AUSTRALIA. YOU CAN SEE NOW<br />
WHAT NONSENSE THAT WAS. OUR GRANTS ARE DIRECT, INTEREST-FREE$<br />
NON-REPAYABLE. THERE ARE NO STRINGS ATTACHED TO THE WAY THE<br />
MONEY IS USED.<br />
3. OUR GENEROSITY TO QUEENSLAND IS NOT CONFINED TO LOCAL GOVERNMENT.<br />
DESPITE ALL THE BLEATS AND PROTESTS FROM'YOUR OUTGOING PREMIER<br />
WE HAVE GIVEN MORE MONEY TO THE STATE THAN ANY PREVIOUS AUSTRALIAN<br />
GOVERNMENT. OUR TOTAL PAYMENTS TO QUEENSLAND LAST YEAR WERE<br />
$ 739 MILLION $ 382 PER HEAD OF POPULATION COMPARED WITH AVERAGE<br />
PAYMENTS TO ALL STATES OF $ 34-5 PER HEAD. ANY BRAKE ON QUEENSLANDS<br />
DEVELOPMENT IS NOT DUE TO US. IT IS DUE TO YOUR PREMIER.<br />
HE HAS TURNED DOWN $ 50 MILLION IN FEDERAL FUNDS FOR GROWTH CENTRES<br />
AND LAND STABILISATION. AND HE SPENDS THE MONEY WE GIVE HIM<br />
MORE SLOWLY AND SPARINGLY THAN ANY OTHER STATE. WE CAN MAKE<br />
MONEY AVAILABLE BUT WE CAN'IT SPEND IT ON OUR OWN. WE NEED THE<br />
CO-OPERATION OF THE STATE.<br />
1. WE HAVE GIVEN THE STATES A VIRTUAL BLANK CHEQUE FOR WELFARE<br />
HOUSING. ONLY THIS MONTH WE ALLOCATED A FURTHER $ 8 MILLION TO<br />
QUEENSLAND IN ADDITION TO OUR EARLIER RECORD ALLOCATIONS WHEN<br />
THEY SHOWED THEY HAD THEIR PLANS READY AND COULD SPEND THE MONEY.<br />
THERE IS NO REASON WHY FURTHER FUNDS CANNOT BE SPENT THIS YEAR,<br />
EXCEPT THAT THE QUEENSLAND GOVERNMENT IS NOT PREPARED TO SPEND<br />
THEM. SOUTH AUSTRALIA-WITH TWO-THIRDS YOU R POPULATION IS<br />
SPENDING AT LEAST $ 35 MILLION MORE ON HOUSING THAN QUEENSLAND IS<br />
MANAGING TO SPEND. ,3 </p>
<p>-3-<br />
THIS ATTITUDE IS COSTING THE JOBS OF BUILDING WORKERS. IT IS<br />
HOLDING BACK YOUR STATE.<br />
MR,. BJELKE-PETERSEN REPEATEDLY TELLS US THAT HE WON'T TAKE OUR<br />
MONEY, I KNOW HE'S ARELIGIOUS MAN BUT HE IS CARRYING RELIGION<br />
TOO FAR WHEN HE TAKES A VOW OF POVERTY ON BEHALF OF QUEENSLAND.<br />
6. WHEN YOUR CANDIDATE JIM TURNER INVITED ME TO VISIT YOUR DISTRICT<br />
IT WAS BEFORE THIS ELECTION WAS ANNOUNCED HE TOLD ME SOMETHING I<br />
OF YOUR PROBLEMS AS A COMPARATIVELY ISOLATED AGRICULTURAL DISTRICT.<br />
THERE IS, FOR EXAMPLE, THE PROBLEM OF HIGH TELEPHONE COSTS<br />
AND DELAYS. MY COLLEAGUE REG BISHOP, THE POSTMASTER-GENERAL, IS<br />
CONSIDERING A PROPOSAL FROM PERC TUCKER FOR A RADIO TELEPHONE<br />
SUBSCRIBER NETWORK LINKED TO THE NATIONAL TELEPHONE SYSTEM, YOU<br />
CAN BE SURE THAT IF THIS SCHEME IS TECHNICALLY FEASIBLE WE WILL<br />
GIVE IT CLOSE ATTENTION, OUR EXPERTS WILL LOOK AT IT AND SEE<br />
IF IT OFFERS SOME ANSWERS TO THE NEEDS OF ISOLATED TELEPHONE<br />
SUBSCRIBERS.<br />
7. WE ARE PARTICIPATING ON A DOLLAR-FOR -DOLLAR BASIS WITH QUEENSLAND<br />
IN A $ 720,000 PROGRAM FOR LOCUST CONTROL. MR. BJELKE-PETERSEN<br />
TRIED TO MISREPRESENT OUR ATTITUDE TO THIS PROBLEM BY TELLING THE<br />
PEOPLE OF QUEENSLAND WE WERE RESTRICTING OUR AID TO ONLY ONE<br />
TYPE OF LOCUST. I GAVE THE LIE TO THAT ALLEGATION. OUR FUNDS<br />
WILL HELP ERADICATE ANY SORT OF LOCUST WHICH DAMAGES AGRICULTURAL<br />
PRODUCTION. I WAS GLAD TO HAVE A LETTER RECENTLY FROM MR. L. V.<br />
PRICE, PRESIDENT OF THE QUEENSLAND GRAINGROWERS' ASSOCIATION,<br />
EXPRESSING HIS APPRECIATION OF OUR OFFER TO ASSIST QUEENSLAND'S<br />
LOCUST ERADICATION PROGRAM, </p>
<p>HE WROTE: " YOUR GOVERNMENT'S FINANCIAL COMMITMENT TO ASSIST THIS<br />
PLAN IS MOST WELCOME AND WILL MAK; E A REALLY CONSTRUCTIVE CONTROL<br />
EFFORT POSSIBLE.,<br />
8. WE ARE STEPPING UP BEEF ROAD CONSTRUCTION IN QUEENSLAND. IN THE<br />
NEXT THREE YEARS WE WILL BE SPENDING $ 24 MILLION ON BEEF EXPORT<br />
ROADS IN NORTHERN AUSTRALIA. FEDERAL LIBERAL-COUNTRY GOVERNMENTS<br />
GROSSLY NEGLECTED BEEF ROADS, WE ARE UPGRADING THE BEEF ROAD<br />
BETWEEN CLERMONT AND CHARTERS TOWERS. THIS IMPORTANT ROAD<br />
CONNECTS THE CATTLE BREEDING AREAS IN QUEENSLAND WITH THE FATTENING<br />
COUNTRY OF THE BRIGALOW AND THE CENTRAL WEST. WE MADE A SPECIAL<br />
GRANT OF $ 3 MILLION TO ALLOW THE BITUMEN TO PROCEED SOUTH AS FAR<br />
AS MOUNT DOUGLAS. THE QUEENSLAND GOVERNMENT IS DOING NOTHING<br />
TO IMPROVE THE ROAD.<br />
ON 30 AUGUST 1973, MY COLLEAGUE REX PATTERSON WROTE TO COUNCILLOR<br />
TURNER OF THE BELYANDO SHIRE COUNCIL: " ON THE SUBJECT OF THE<br />
CHARTERS TOWERS-CLERMONT ROAD, I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT I AM AWARE OF<br />
ITS IMPROTANCE TO THE BEEF INDUSTRY AS WELL AS FOR A NUMBER OF<br />
OTHER PRUPOSES SUCH AS PROVIDING THE RESIDENTS OF THE AREA WITH<br />
A MUCH NEEDED IMPROVED LINKING ROAD AND AS AN AID TO TOURIST<br />
INDUSTRY DEVELOPMENT. As I MENTIONED, THE CHARTERS-TOWERS<br />
CLERMONT ROAD IS RECEIVING CLOSE CONSIDERATIONIN THE INVESTIGATIONS<br />
NOW IN PROGRESS FOR A POSSIBLE EXTENSION OF THE BEEF ROADS<br />
SCHEME BEYOND 30 JUNE 1974,"<br />
OUR EXTRA GRANT WAS THE RESULT OF THAT EXTENTION OF THE BEEF<br />
ROADS SCHEME. </p>
<p>9. ALTHOUGH RURAL ELECTRICITY COSTS IN QUEENSLAND ARE THE HIGHEST<br />
IN ALL THE EASTERN STATES, THE BJELKE-PETERSEN GOVERNMENT HAS REFUSED T(<br />
CO-OPERATE WITH US IN SEEKING WAYS TO REDUCE THESE COSTS. HIGH<br />
ELECTRICITY COSTS HELP PUSH UP PRICES OVER A WIDE RANGE OF GOODS<br />
AND SERVICES. THE BJELKE-PETERSEN GOVERNMENT REFUSES TO USE<br />
ITS WIDE POWERS TO CONTROL PRICES AND RESISTED OUR ATTEMPTS TO<br />
OBTAIN COMMONWEALTH POWER OVER PRICES BY REFERENDUM.<br />
MR BJELKE-PETERSEN HAS REFUSED TO CO-OOPERATE IN OUR PLANS FOR<br />
A SOIL CONSERVATION PROGRAM. IWROTE TO ALL THE PREMIERS ON<br />
17 SEPTEMBER OFFERING A TOTAL GRANT TO ALL STATES OF $ 2.5 MILLION<br />
FOR AN INTERIM PROGRAM FOR UP TO JUNE 1976. QUEENSLAND WAS<br />
OFFERED $ 160,000 IN 1974-75 AND $ 700,000 IN 1975-76 -THE<br />
HIGHEST AMOUNTS FOR ANY STATE. THE OUTGOING PREMIER HAS NOT<br />
YET TOLD US WHETHER HE WILL ACCEPTOUR OFFER.<br />
11, UNDER THE LABOR GOVERNMENT WE HAVE SEEN THE FIRST SIGNIFICANT<br />
POST-WAR FALL FOR MANY YEARS IN THE INDEBTEDNESS OF RURAL<br />
PRODUCERS. IN 1971 THE BUREAU OF AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS<br />
REPORTED THAT 7,570 AUSTRALIAN FARMERS APPLIED FOR ASSISTANCE<br />
FROMiTHE RURAL RECONSTRUCTION BOARD. THIS YEAR THE FIGURE IS<br />
DOWN To 523.<br />
12. OUR DtCISION; Y TO ESTABLISH AN ANIMAL HEALTH LABORATORY AT A COST<br />
OF $ 56 MILLION WILL HELP THE LOCAL BEEF INDUSTRY AND ALL<br />
LIVESTOCK INDUSTRIES IN AUSTRALIA, ./ 6 </p>
<p>-6-<br />
13. THE FITZROY REGION HERE IN CENTRAL WESTERN QUEENSLAND WAS ONE<br />
OF THREE AREAS IN QUEENSLAND WHICH WE PROPOSED AS REGIONAL<br />
GROWTH CENTRES IN OUR ELECTION CAMPAIGN IN 1972. MR. BJLEKEPETERSEN<br />
HAS BLOCKED OUR INITIAL PLANS TO DEVELOP TOWNSVILLE AS A<br />
GROWTH CENTRE.<br />
i14. WE ARE AWARE OF THE SPECIAL-. EDUCATIONAL PROBLEMS OF ISOLATED<br />
CHILDREN IN REGIONS SUCH AS YOURS, WE INTRODUCED A SPECIAL<br />
SCHEME LAST YEAR TO HELP THESE CHILDREN. THIS YEAR WE HAVE<br />
BUDGETED TO SPEND $ 11.5 MILLION THROUGHOUT AUSTRALIA. INCLUDING<br />
$ 3.3 MILLION ON QUEENSLAND FOR THIS PURPOSE. WE ARE ELPING<br />
2964l QUEENSLAND FAMILIES, AND 41899 QUEENSLAND cHiLDREN, wiTH OUR<br />
ISOLATED CHILDREN'IS EDUCATIONAL PROGRAM THIS YEAR. </p>
