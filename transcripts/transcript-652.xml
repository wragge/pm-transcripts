No, 8.3/ 1962<br />
FOR PRESS MEETING OF SOUTH AUSTRALIAN LIBERAL<br />
SENATORS AND MEMBERS<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister_, Rt.._ Hgn. RG. Menzies<br />
I have this afternoon beei interviewed by<br />
South Australian Liberal Senators and Members.. Those<br />
present were Mr. Downer, Senators Buttfield, Hannaford and Laught<br />
Sir John McLeay, Messrs. Kelly, Forbes and WJilson,<br />
Meetings of this kind are by no means infrequent. My South<br />
Australian colleagues have at all times actively presented<br />
the problems affecting their own State.<br />
I have informed them that on Monday next I will<br />
be attending a Conference with the representatives of New<br />
South Wales, Victoria and South Australia in relation to<br />
the proposed Chowilla Dam√∏. It will be remembered that the<br />
economic value of the proposed dam having been established,<br />
I undertook on behalf of the Commonwealth Government that<br />
we would find a quarter of tho cost, following the pattern<br />
previously established in relation to other River Murray<br />
works. There have been some delays, but I am hoping very<br />
much that we will be able to achieve finality on Monday.<br />
It is indeed important that we should, since this additional<br />
water storage is of vital importance to South Australia,<br />
A deficiency of water is South Australia's greatest natural<br />
disability, and my Government has for a long time been ready<br />
and anxious to help to repair that deficiency.<br />
While Sir Thomas Playford is here for the Conference,<br />
I will of course take the opportunity of discussing with him<br />
other outstanding South Australian requests in order that I<br />
may not only more fully inform myself on the facts, but also<br />
that I may learn of the order of priority that attaches to<br />
these various proposals.<br />
CANBEREA, 13th November, 1962. </p>
