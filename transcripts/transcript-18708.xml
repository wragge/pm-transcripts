I pay tribute to my parliamentary colleague and friend, Sharon Grierson MP, who has announced her retirement from politics after 12 years as Member for Newcastle.</p>
<p>Sharon has been a diligent servant of the people of Newcastle and a passionate ambassador for the Hunter as a region of opportunity fuelled by research, innovation and urban renewal.</p>
<p>She has worked hard to secure jobs and investment, including more than $2 billion worth of Commonwealth funding for facilities and infrastructure  -  an outstanding record.</p>
<p>The seat of Newcastle is one of the original electorates, created at the time of Federation, and has had only five Members in its entire history, all of them Labor.</p>
<p>Sharon has been a wonderful custodian of that tradition, describing herself in her first speech as âa proud daughter of the noble working class of Newcastleâ.</p>
<p>That ethos has driven Sharon to stand up for workers' rights, for the needs of families and pensioners and for those doing it tough.</p>
<p>As a former teacher and school principal, Sharon has worked tirelessly to ensure every child in our nation receives a great education, no matter what their circumstances or background.</p>
<p>She has never shrunk from wearing her values of compassion and social justice on her sleeve.</p>
<p>It has been an honour to work with Sharon in making Labor's vision a reality in the Hunter and right across our land.</p>
<p>Sharon will leave office with my sincere thanks and my very best wishes for the future. </p>
