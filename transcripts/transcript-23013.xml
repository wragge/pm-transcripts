    <content><![CDATA[<p>President and Ibu Yudhoyono, ministers, ambassadors, business leaders, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen.</p>
<p>It is an honour to be in this grand setting, thatâs witnessed so much history, to pay tribute to Indonesia, our largest and most important neighbour; and to honour you, Bapak President, a patriot who has led by example, a moderniser of your country and a strong voice for decency in the wider world.</p>
<p>Long ago I promised a foreign policy focussed on Jakarta rather than Geneva and that a visit to Jakarta would be the very first trip I made as prime minister â and here I am, within two weeks of being sworn in.</p>
<p>Indeed, I hope a convention has now been established: that Jakarta should always be an incoming Australian prime ministerâs first overseas visit.</p>
<p>That would be a fitting way for us officially to acknowledge the strength and significance of the friendship between our two countries.</p>
<p>Indonesia has created a modern nation from a vast and diverse archipelago; lifted tens of millions from the third world to the middle class; transitioned from military rule to robust democracy; improved human rights; and now stands on the threshold of rapid economic take-off.</p>
<p>Along with India, Indonesia is the emerging democratic superpower of Asia.</p>
<p>Itâs that important.</p>
<p>Australia has always considered itself a good friend of Indonesia and is now determined to be a trusted partner.</p>
<p>We stood by Indonesia during the Asian financial crisis and at the time of the devastating East Asian tsunami.</p>
<p>We worked together in counter terrorism after the Bali bombings.</p>
<p>After the 2005 bombing, I personally witnessed your visit, Bapak President, to the Australian casualties in Sanglah hospital and was moved by the way you comforted each one of them.</p>
<p>Now, we are working together to counter a range of security challenges, including people smuggling, which has led to more than 1100 deaths at sea in the waters between our countries.</p>
<p>I am grateful to you, Bapak President, and to your government for this cooperation and look forward to building on these foundations.</p>
<p>Yours are the actions of a true friend and will never be forgotten â just as Australia will never forget Indonesiaâs work to bring to justice the killers of so many innocent people, including nearly 100 Australians, after the Bali and Jakarta bombings.</p>
<p>There have been times, Iâm sorry to say, when Australia must have tried your patience: when we âput the sugar on the tableâ for people smugglers; or cancelled the live cattle trade in panic at a TV programme.</p>
<p>There have been times when all sides of Australian politics should have said less and done more.</p>
<p>I am confident that these will soon seem like out-of-character aberrations and that the relationship will once more be one of no surprises, based on mutual trust, dependability and absolute respect for each otherâs sovereignty under the Lombok Treaty.</p>
<p>As your closest first world economy with a strong interest in its neighbourâs success, and with the right attitudes, Australia is Indonesiaâs obvious and natural partner in development.</p>
<p>Nowhere on earth would there be such an abundance of goodwill between two quite distinct countries.</p>
<p>In any year, hundreds of thousands of Australians come to Indonesia as tourists and tens of thousands of Indonesians come to Australia as students.</p>
<p>These are the movements that our citizens freely choose to make because they individually appreciate what each of our countries can offer.</p>
<p>Our challenge is to build on this goodwill in ways which deepen Australiaâs relationship with Asia and which accelerate Indonesiaâs rise.</p>
<p>We must succeed.</p>
<p>As you said, Bapak President, when you last addressed the Australian Parliament, âOur two countries have a great future together.</p>
<p>We are not just neighbours, we are not just friends; we are strategic partners.</p>
<p>We are equal stakeholders in a common future with much to gain if we get this relationship right and much to lose if we get it wrong.â</p>
<p>I respectfully concur and adopt your words as my own.</p>
<p>Australia has more significant economic and security relationships yet no other relationship â not one â is more important than our friendship with Indonesia due to its size, proximity and potential to be a global leader.</p>
<p>Tomorrow, I will outline a deeper cultural engagement including a new Australia Indonesia study centre at Monash University to match the United States and China centres elsewhere in Australia.</p>
<p>With your permission, Bapak President, and to honour your friendship with Australia, the new, two-way street version of the Colombo Plan will feature a Yudhoyono fellow: the best and brightest young Australian who elects, in any year, to study in Indonesia.</p>
<p>And I will outline new measures to build an economic partnership with Indonesia thatâs scarcely less significant in the years to come than China is now.</p>
<p>Thatâs why Iâm accompanied on this trip by 20 business leaders to promote trade and investment between our two countries.</p>
<p>Our relationship has so much promise â and everything will be easier once the people smuggling complication is gone.</p>
<p>There will be no more vital task for the new Australian government than to build on the mutual respect and affection between our two countries and I am confident that this visit has been a strong start.</p>
