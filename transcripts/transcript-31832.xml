    <content><![CDATA[<p>Former senator Brian Harradine has died after a long illness.</p>
<p>He served in the Australian Parliament in Canberra as an independent senator for Tasmania between 1975 and 2005.Â </p>
<p>He was the longest serving independent senator in Australiaâs history.Â  A long-standing âFather of the Senate,â he made a strong and effective contribution to both the parliamentary chamber in which he served and to the state that elected him on six consecutive occasions.</p>
<p>Ever the staunch advocate for Tasmania, Brian Harradine always sought to get the best possible deal for his state.</p>
<p>His faith and his family played an integral part in his life.</p>
<p>Brian Harradine was proud of his family, proud of his state and proud of the Parliament that he served.</p>
<p>My thoughts are with his wife, Marian, and their children and grandchildren.</p>
