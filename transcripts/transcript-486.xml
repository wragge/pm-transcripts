p NUCLEAR RE7SEARCH FOUNDATION DINNER<br />
Seech b the Prime nister, the Rt. Hon. R. G. Menzies<br />
Mr. Chairman, Chancellor, Mr, Renshaw and gentlemen:<br />
This is really an anti-climax. Here am I a simple soul,<br />
dealing with the better part of Å 2,000m. a year and every time the<br />
expenditure of the Government goes up our Lordships of the Press<br />
say how disgraceful it is; and every time the Revenue goes up<br />
they say how wicked this is; and I've been listening now to<br />
Professor Messel who positively secures merit, not only in your<br />
mind, but in the mind of one of the masters of the Press, by<br />
being able to say that he has increased the expenditure 20 times.<br />
( Laughter) Parkinson's Law becomes respectable tonight!<br />
( Laughter) Even the Vice-Chancellor, my old friend, Stephen<br />
Roberts, I thought played his cards very badly: he explained<br />
that he was going to blackmail somebody, but he at once disclosed<br />
the means by which ha was going to blackmail him which, if I may<br />
say so to him, was a mistake. A competent blackmailer never puts<br />
all the cards on the table. ( Laughter)<br />
And here is Messel being positively applauded by you for<br />
spending more money than he has. ( Laughter) And when he wants<br />
you to make up the deficiency, does he do what poor wretched<br />
creatures like Governments have to do, anrid say, " Well we must<br />
raise your taxes a little"? Not at all. He just says to you,<br />
" Now, make it a pleasure, make it a privilege, give mo another<br />
Å 150,000 and I'll settle for it". All I can say is that when I<br />
go back to Canberra on Monday I'm not only going to send for the<br />
Treasurer, but I'm going to send for the Commissioner of<br />
Taxation. ( Laughter) And I'm going to say, " We've missed<br />
something." ( Laughter) " When the assessments go out, add a<br />
little note in red ink, ' If you feel moved to give us another<br />
000 don't hesitate"'. ( Laughter) And, of course, I don't<br />
want to be too cynical but I don't think the re. sponse would be<br />
all that magnificent. Still this is a very interesting experience for me,<br />
because I have a simple job a sort of anti-climactic job. I<br />
just propose the health of he University of Sydney. I think it<br />
is a remarkable University because although I have a Degree from<br />
my own University which I won't mention down there somewhere<br />
for which I had to work and sweat, I have been given a Degree in<br />
the University of Sydney unearned, and, so far as I remember,<br />
unpaid for. ( Laughter) Therefore, as a graduate of the Sydney<br />
University, causa honoris, it is my task to propose the toast of<br />
the University which has attracted to its numnbers the greatest<br />
collector of revenue, voluntary revenue, in the history of<br />
Australia. ( Applause)<br />
This, of course, all puzzles me very much, very much<br />
indeed. I wouldn't wrant to talk about politics because a! you<br />
know I'm now in a state of almost ineffable bliss at Canberra,<br />
( Laughter) but this throws a new light on Sydney where up to now<br />
I have always been in the habit of being told by my " friends"<br />
that there is much to be said for me but the taxes ought to be<br />
lower. And hero you are, you come along at vast expense to<br />
yourselves and you listen to a man putting the hard word on you;<br />
and all the evidence is that he has put the hard word not only on<br />
you but on people all round the world and that you pay and like<br />
it. Now I'm going back to Canberra to say to my Victorian<br />
colleagues " Don't be faint-hearted. Make it a pleasure, and<br />
they'll pay". Do you understand that? I think that's something. </p>
<p>2.<br />
However, my job tonight is not to marvel at what has<br />
been done, but to say something about the University of Sydney,<br />
the oldest University in Australia. This University, the first<br />
in Australia, has seen its children, its nephews, its<br />
derivatives in one wy or another, this or that side of the<br />
blanket, spreading all round Australia. And I happen to be here<br />
not simply because I an Prime Minister because that, as you<br />
have reminded me of late, is a somewhat precarious post.<br />
( Laughter) I am here as one who, if he's given time to look back<br />
on his life whether that's a good thing or a bad thing I<br />
wouldn't quite know they say that when a man is drowning the<br />
whole of his past life comes before him there's no first hand<br />
evidence of this ( Laughter) nor have I ever thought it a very<br />
happy way to die-I don't want the whole of my past life to come<br />
before me ( Laughter) as one who would like to think, when I am<br />
ultimately relieved, with somewhat bogus expressions of<br />
gratitude, of the tasks that I now pursue, that I could look back<br />
and say " What is the thing in your public life that has given<br />
you the most pleasure?" And my ansiwer would be clear and<br />
unambiguous. I would like to remember that it has been my<br />
singular fortune to be somebody who, with the complete backing of<br />
his Government has done something to begin a new era for the<br />
Universities of Australia. ( Applause)<br />
This is one of those things that satisfies the mind and<br />
will, I hope, satisfy the memory. If one speaks in that way, if<br />
one thinks in that way, then it is, of course completely clear<br />
that as one looks over the University field, the whole field, now<br />
so rapidly expanding, now reaching out to cover hundreds of<br />
thousands where it once covered thousands, one must always come<br />
back to the University of Sydney, the first University.<br />
This is a tremendous privilege for people to belong to<br />
the first University, well over 100 years old. You look back on<br />
the people who started it; you look back on the state of<br />
Australia when they started it; you look back on the way in<br />
which their friends no doubt said to them, " But how crazy can you<br />
be? You want to start a University? le're a more colony. ; Je're<br />
a handful of people". But they started it. They laid its<br />
foundations. And if they could now come up from the tomb and<br />
look at what has happened in the field of Universities in<br />
Australia they would know that they built better than they knew;<br />
they would feel a great pride in what has happened in their<br />
country, then a new country, in some . ays a crude country, but a<br />
country in which they were determined to sow seeds that would<br />
grow and flourish and ultimately do something for a vast section<br />
of the people of a future great nation. This I think, is a<br />
tremendous privilege for the University of Sydney.<br />
Of course there are other Universities. I have made a<br />
modest and glancing reference to the University of Melbourne.<br />
There are, I'm credibly informed by the Chairman of the<br />
Universities Co:-ission, Universities in other places which have<br />
their demands, which have their ambitions, which have their<br />
function to perform. are now living in a period of time in<br />
which we not only talk about what we can do for the old<br />
Universities, but about what we can do to create new ones, about<br />
what we can do to establish a varied, and perhaps complex system<br />
of tertiary education in Australia which will all serve to make<br />
this country the great country that we know, in our hearts, it<br />
is and is bound to be.<br />
But tonight rI' going back to the origin. There is an<br />
old Latin r:. axim which, for the bonefit of those educated at the<br />
Sydney Grammar School I will translate into English ( Laughter):<br />
" It is bettor to seek the fountainhoads than to divide up the<br />
little streams". It is a good thing that we should go back to<br />
the fountainheads. </p>
<p>.6 14.<br />
But it was merely a graphic way of putting this: that<br />
that was a tine, oven in my y-' ung manhood when the University was<br />
something apart, a hone of privilege, dealing with matters not to<br />
be understood by ordinary people; and that the rest of the world<br />
might go on ignoring it with groat satisfaction, and, indeed, with<br />
some advantage. Today, thanks to the fact that the Universities<br />
have injected themselves into the public life of the country, into<br />
the social life of the country, and thanks to the fact that scores<br />
and hundreds, and perhaps for all I know, thousands of practical<br />
men of affairs have made it their business to see what goes on in<br />
a University, to help it, and to influence it, that old, false<br />
dichotomy has disappeared. We no longer say, " Ah, yes,<br />
University men and ordinary decent blokes different compartments.'<br />
No. All that has gone, and it is a good thing that it has gone.<br />
The fact that it has gone is not, if you will allow me to<br />
say so, due to the unassisted genius of the business man; it is,<br />
to a very formidable extent due to the new and practical and<br />
enthusiastic approach of the people who are in, and of, the<br />
Universities themselves.<br />
This, I think, is a great period to live in. I would<br />
like to live, and I won't for enough years to see some of the<br />
fruits of this. But I believe that if one could, by a mere wave<br />
of the hand, or ovei by an Order in Council, arrange that one<br />
should live for another 40 years not in office, don't you worry<br />
( Laughter) and just retain enough wit and enough memory and<br />
enough historic imagination to appreciate the picture, one would<br />
find in tnis wonderful country of ours by the turn of the century<br />
a community which, because the Univursities and the public had<br />
been married and had had issue, was making a contribution to life<br />
and to living, a splendid example in the world, rivalling, in the<br />
eyes of the classicist, tae contribution that was made by ancient<br />
Greece. All this takes r. e back to . rhere I began because there is<br />
a sort of " folie circulaire" about politicians for you nay not<br />
have noticed we end where we began. If I may and where I began<br />
I would like to say that this brings me back to the University of<br />
Sydney, the father University of Australia, to use the modern<br />
jargon, " the father imagoe" of the Universities of Australia. And<br />
it is one of my pleasant satisfactions that when I have sat down,<br />
as I'm about to in a minute and a half, you will hear in reply<br />
to this toast a man who is the Chancellor, this great man,<br />
Charles Bickerton Blackburn,( Applause) a man who, if I may say so,<br />
is the greatest of Chancellors, the Chancellor of the oldest<br />
University in Australia, and himself, technically, but only<br />
technically, the oldest Chancellor in Australia. So when you<br />
drink the health of the University have in mind this venerable<br />
person who is at the s: ime time the youngest Chancellor in<br />
Australia and, I sometimes think, the youngest man here.<br />
( Applause) </p>
