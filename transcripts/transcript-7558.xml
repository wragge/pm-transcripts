PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 6 APRIL 1989<br />
The Government has decided on a national program for<br />
responding to the global threat posed by the Greenhouse<br />
effect. The Government's strategy involves a research-oriented<br />
program of action in. the first instance. A great deal has<br />
yet to be learned about the Greenhouse effect, its timing<br />
and impact on different countries and regions. We cannot<br />
sit and wait until the effects of global warming are upon us<br />
and then start working out how we should deal with them.<br />
Modelling of those effects must start in earnest immediately<br />
so that we are in a position to anticipate and deal with the<br />
Greenhouse effect.<br />
To ensure the Government is provided with accurate and<br />
timely advice, a National Greenhouse Advisory Committee of<br />
up to six experts will be appointed.<br />
A key task for the National Greenhouse Advisory Committee<br />
will be to provide advice on priority areas for further<br />
Greenhouse research and set objectives for a dedicated<br />
research grants scheme. The Committee will also have the<br />
important role of promoting public understanding of<br />
Greenhouse issues.<br />
To give effect to the first stage of the Government's<br />
strategy, $ 7.8 million will be provided between now and<br />
June 1990 for Greenhouse research and policy support.<br />
The bulk of the funding, $ 5.54 million, will be directed to<br />
CSIRO and the Bureau of Meteorology to enable full advantage<br />
to be taken of existinq expertise and to build on work<br />
already done. This will provide an important first<br />
instalment of the national Greenhouse research program.<br />
other elements of the funding will enable:<br />
Australia to maintain its close association with the-<br />
World Climate Impact Studies Programme being undertaken<br />
by the United Nations Environment Program;<br />
The Academy of Science to assist the International<br />
Geosphere-Biosphere Program, which studies the physical,<br />
chemical and biological processes that regulate the<br />
total earth system; and </p>
<p>The establishment of a comprehensive national climate<br />
program linked into the World Meteorological<br />
Organisation's World Climate Programme and the Second<br />
World Climate Conference in 1990 to be examined.<br />
Greenhouse cannot be dismissed as just another environmental<br />
problem. It has the potential to change fundamentally<br />
within a single lifetime the way all nations and peoples<br />
live and work.<br />
It clearly signals that we must reassess the way in which we<br />
use the earth's resources.<br />
Through the Government's program for dealing with the twin<br />
problems of the Greenhouse effect and ozone layer depletion<br />
we are putting Australia at the forefront of international<br />
efforts to protect the earth's fragile natural environment.<br />
