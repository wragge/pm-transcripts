<p> QUESTION: [lack of GPs in country towns]</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I'd like you to do that and the man is Mr Brett Cox. He's back</p>
<p> there holding that brief case. But I just say to you that I think the</p>
<p> problem of getting more general practitioners into rural and regional</p>
<p> Australia is right at the very top of the list. We have made some progress</p>
<p> with a number of initiatives that Dr Wooldridge has introduced. And there</p>
<p> has been some improvement but we still have a long way to go. And I would</p>
<p> acknowledge that doing something about this is about the single most important</p>
<p> area of challenge as far as social policy is concerned. I think people</p>
<p> who live in rural Australia have the same right as people who live in</p>
<p> the cities to have access to proper health care for their families, for</p>
<p> themselves. I think it is one of those basic entitlements that Australians</p>
<p> where ever they are should have. I can understand people feeling a bit</p>
<p> left out if they can't get a doctor to treat them or to treat their</p>
<p> ill child or their parents. I understand that. We are making progress,</p>
<p> making some progress and in a number ways. We've got a greater emphasis</p>
<p> on rural medicine in a number of the universities. We're trying to</p>
<p> put incentives into the Medicare provider number system to bring about</p>
<p> some changes. We're trying a number of different strategies including</p>
<p> the provision of additional funds. And we have a few more ideas we're</p>
<p> working on at the present time. But I can't argue with you. I think</p>
<p> your proposition is correct. I don't think we will have sort of done</p>
<p> the job effectively until there's a lot more progress made on this</p>
<p> front.</p>
<p>QUESTION: [unemployment and shorter working hours]</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well thank you very much sir. Could I just say a couple of things? Firstly</p>
<p> we already are doing what you're suggesting. We have seen in this</p>
<p> country a very significant increase in the amount of part-time work and</p>
<p> casual work. I've often had this proposition put to me and if you</p>
<p> study the structure of the labour market in Australia the way it's</p>
<p> changed over the last ten years you can actually see there are a whole</p>
<p> variety of reasons the development of the very trend you mentioned. I</p>
<p> was interested that you quoted Europe. I don't want to be unduly</p>
<p> argumentative because it's not in my nature, but I'd have to</p>
<p> say to you with every respect that Europe is not doing as well as Australia</p>
<p> or the United States or indeed Japan, although Japan has not done as well</p>
<p> lately, as far as unemployment is concerned. One of the reasons that Europe</p>
<p> is not doing as well is that their industrial relations system is still</p>
<p> too tightly regulated and is still too heavily dominated by a centralised</p>
<p> approach to industrial relations. The unemployment problem in Australia</p>
<p> is still with us and it's with us in a big way in many parts of the</p>
<p> country. In other parts of the country it is very low indeed. And what</p>
<p> I was trying to say in my opening remarks was to acknowledge the fact</p>
<p> that in many parts of Sydney the unemployment rate is now only 2% or 3%.</p>
<p> What we want to try and do is to find the ways of bringing about that</p>
<p> same state of affairs in all parts of the country. Now it didn't</p>
<p> get to 2% or 3% in those parts of the country from anything other than</p>
<p> strong economic growth and also I think having a more flexible approach</p>
<p> to working arrangements. I mean I agree with you that we have to have</p>
<p> more flexibility but could I say that we have that now. There's a</p>
<p> lot more part-time work, there's a lot more flexibility in the system</p>
<p> now than there used to be. I don't think you will eliminate the rest</p>
<p> of unemployment by legislating for permanently lower working hours. We've</p>
<p> really got to get to a society where people agree amongst themselves as</p>
<p> to what their working hours ought to be rather than trying to impose a</p>
<p> rigid uniform pattern. I mean if you're trying to run a small business</p>
<p> in a rural area the last thing you want is a whole lot of dogmatic rules</p>
<p> that tell you how many hours you can or can't work. What you really</p>
<p> want is an arrangement of course that guarantees proper minimum standards</p>
<p> so people won't be exploited, but you also want the opportunity to</p>
<p> really make your own arrangements that best fits the employee and also</p>
<p> suits the employer. Now I understand your broad philosophical point and</p>
<p> I don't disagree with it. But I point out that a lot of that is already</p>
<p> happening. At the end of the day you can't get away from the fact</p>
<p> that if you want to reduce unemployment you need strong economic growth.</p>
<p> We've added 575,000 jobs in Australia in the last four years. We</p>
<p> have reduced unemployment nationally and that has happened because we've</p>
<p> had a strong pattern of economic growth. It's been uneven, I acknowledge.</p>
<p> And that is the challenge we have now to try and spread some of the national</p>
<p> economic benefits a little more evenly throughout the community.</p>
<p>QUESTION: [inaudible]</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Some people like working longer, some people like working less. And some</p>
<p> people would like to work indefinitely, but I agree with that. I think</p>
<p> one of the most foolish things this country did a few years ago was move</p>
<p> towards having fixed statutory retirement ages. I think we should move</p>
<p> away, and we are moving away from that. And I don't think it makes</p>
<p> a great deal of sense to say you've got to retire by a particular</p>
<p> age.</p>
<p> QUESTION: [health services and information technology]</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well sir, in no way wishing to walk away from responding to the question,</p>
<p> a number of those things at an administrative level of course are more</p>
<p> in the hands of the State government than the Federal. Can I say in relation</p>
<p> to the IT point I agree completely with that. And one of the benefits,</p>
<p> if I may say so, of the progressive sale of Telstra, and I know some people</p>
<p> in the bush criticised that, is that out of the proceeds of it we have</p>
<p> the resources to upgrade a lot of the communications facilities including</p>
<p> the greater provision of IT facilities. One of the things that will make</p>
<p> people in the regions feel properly included in the economic progress</p>
<p> of the country is not only access to general practitioners which came</p>
<p> up in an earlier question, but also access to the benefits of information</p>
<p> technology. And it's impossible in my view to overstate the economic</p>
<p> benefit to this country of the proper utilization of the information technology</p>
<p> revolution. It does have the capacity to add enormously to our productivity.</p>
<p> It can demolish distance as a disabling factor in a way that virtually</p>
<p> nothing else can. And just as it's important to get the cost of fuel</p>
<p> and therefore the transportation of goods down because there are some</p>
<p> things that you can't transport over the Internet and you have to</p>
<p> carry them by truck or by rail, so it is that if we can bring IT facilities</p>
<p> to people in remote areas then we'll be making a very big contribution.</p>
<p> QUESTION: [GST and automotive industry]</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well certainly the motor industry will be one of the major beneficiaries</p>
<p> because of the very significant difference between the 22% wholesale sales</p>
<p> tax and a 10% GST. The answer to that question is that we're monitoring</p>
<p> the figures virtually on a daily basis. But the problem sir is that the</p>
<p> overall figures are still very strong. They really are. We have figures...the</p>
<p> last set of monthly figures on new motor vehicle registrations is still</p>
<p> very strong. Now I understand that the industry is concerned about a buyer's</p>
<p> drought and I understand that it is logical that if you face a situation</p>
<p> where on the 1st of July you can buy something for several</p>
<p> thousand dollars less than what you might have to pay for it now that</p>
<p> you're going to hold back. Now the response has been for some of</p>
<p> the traders to anticipate the reduction by heavy discounting. I think</p>
<p> you're probably very conscious of that. And I know it's uneven.</p>
<p> I've had that question from a number of dealers including several</p>
<p> in my own electorate in Sydney who've put basically the same propositions</p>
<p> to me. I can't at this stage say anything other than we'll keep</p>
<p> watching it. We don't want any crisis to arise but we can't,</p>
<p> I hope you'll understand, act prematurely when the overall figures</p>
<p> still show very strong sales. I mean I don't think there can be any</p>
<p> argument that the motor vehicle industry registrations in aggregate are</p>
<p> still very strong and they're much stronger than they were two or</p>
<p> three years ago. Now we'll keep watching it. Nick Minchin who's</p>
<p> not only from this State but he's also the Minister responsible,</p>
<p> and the Treasurer are monitoring it on a weekly basis. And we said at</p>
<p> the beginning that if we needed to take any kind of emergency action we</p>
<p> would and that remains our position. But the thing that is constraining</p>
<p> us at the present time is that the overall figures for motor vehicle registration</p>
<p> still remain very strong. Now we have to keep watching. We had I thought</p>
<p> quite good news for South Australia in relation to Mitsubishi the other</p>
<p> day Â the announcement the other day there will be some rationalisation,</p>
<p> they're still going to maintain a manufacturing capacity here in</p>
<p> South Australia and that's particularly encouraging. But we will</p>
<p> keep monitoring but I have to say that the overall figures are still quite</p>
<p> strong.</p>
<p> QUESTION: [higher education costs]</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well could I take the second question first sir. There are...the scares</p>
<p> that arose at the time of that leaked document, can I just tell you that</p>
<p> we are not going to implement any such proposal. We have made some changes</p>
<p> in relation to the higher education sector that have created a situation</p>
<p> where students are making, because of the changes in the HECS arrangement,</p>
<p> are making a greater contribution towards the cost of their education</p>
<p> in relation to HECS. I mean bear in mind that HECS is a system where you</p>
<p> have the option of deferring your contribution until after you are in</p>
<p> the workforce and earning an income, or paying up front. You've got</p>
<p> that choice. Now I have to say to you I think that's fair. I don't</p>
<p> think we as a country can afford to go back to a system where the taxpayer</p>
<p> picks up the entire cost of somebody's education at university. I</p>
<p> don't think that's fair on people who don't go to university,</p>
<p> I don't think it's fair on the generality of taxpayers. I think</p>
<p> what you have to do is to try and have something which is balanced where</p>
<p> people make a contribution. And students, it depends once again where</p>
<p> you live. The opportunities for part-time work for many young students</p>
<p> now are considerable in many part of the country, and they have a capacity</p>
<p> through that part-time work to earn sufficient money to pay their HECS</p>
<p> up front. If they don't, or they don't choose to do so then</p>
<p> they don't have any liability for it until after they've graduated</p>
<p> and they're in the workforce and their income has reached a certain</p>
<p> level. Now I don't think anybody can question the essential equity</p>
<p> of that. And I can't hold out that we can ever go back to and I'm</p>
<p> against going back to the notion that education is completely free. It</p>
<p> didn't work and it didn't produce a better system. Now in relation</p>
<p> to the cost of people being educated who live in the country Â of</p>
<p> course it's more expensive. It's more expensive in relation</p>
<p> to school education as well and one of the reasons why my government has</p>
<p> quite unashamedly supported the independent school sector, one of the</p>
<p> reasons, as well as supporting the government sector in education is that</p>
<p> it's the independent sector that by and large provides opportunity</p>
<p> for people who've come from the country to go to boarding school.</p>
<p> I think it's very important that that be kept. There have been significant</p>
<p> improvements. It sounds from your question as though you're not entitled</p>
<p> to it, I'm sorry about that, but there have been very considerable</p>
<p> increases in the living away from home allowances under the youth allowance</p>
<p> in relation to students. In fact one of the features of that new system</p>
<p> was a very significant increase in the value of the living away from home</p>
<p> component of it. Now it's no good if you're not eligible for</p>
<p> it because of the level of your income. I accept that. But it does provide.....</p>
<p> How old is your daughter?</p>
<p>QUESTION:</p>
<p>18.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>She's just going to university this year. Went last year. Where</p>
<p> is she, in Adelaide? Well I don't think any...I mean of course</p>
<p> it's one of the reasons...not so much reason being here. I said</p>
<p> earlier in answer to a question I think people have got a right in relation</p>
<p> to things like health care and education to see a reasonable degree of</p>
<p> equity. I can't be so unrealistic as to say to you that if you ever</p>
<p> completely eliminate some of these things just as some people I talk to</p>
<p> will argue well you know the cost of buying a house in some of the cities</p>
<p> is a lot more than the cost of buying a house in some of the regional</p>
<p> towns and that's true, and therefore your mortgage payments are much</p>
<p> higher so there are some swings and round abouts between the bush and</p>
<p> the bush and the cities but education and health are two of those basic</p>
<p> things in life which I understand.</p>
<p> QUESTION: [Medicare anomaly]</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, thank you for raising that. I'll investigate it. I wasn't</p>
<p> aware of that but it does sound on the face of it a bit unreasonable.</p>
<p> I'll investigate that and I'll come back to that and go through</p>
<p> Barry with a response.</p>
<p> QUESTION: [Bank closures]</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Will this mean it has no banks? What's the population? Well I can't</p>
<p> answer that question straight off. I would have to investigate it. The</p>
<p> Rural Transaction Centres, the current round, involve about, we have about</p>
<p> 500 around the country. I opened the first of them a few months ago in,</p>
<p> near Parkes in NSW in a little town that had about 600 people. It was</p>
<p> a former Westpac premises that were required on that particular occasion</p>
<p> to a co-operative arrangement with the Local Government and they are a</p>
<p> great concept and the reaction to it has been very good. Can I once again</p>
<p> follow that up and come back to you. We have certain criteria through</p>
<p> the Department and the Minister for working out who gets them and I can't,</p>
<p> not off the top of my head, not having all the detail with me say yes</p>
<p> or no to that without checking out what is available in the resources</p>
<p> that have been allocated to them. Can I just say one more general thing</p>
<p> on bank closures that one of the, it is of no comfort to your community</p>
<p> at all, but one of the things that has happened as a result of criticism</p>
<p> of bank closures not only by people in the country but also by the government,</p>
<p> by myself is that one or two of the banks had actually announced moratoria</p>
<p> on further closures in rural areas. Now Westpac is obviously not one of</p>
<p> them but certainly the ANZ did that and I know a couple of the banks have</p>
<p> some ideas about trying to reverse some of the trends but we are I think</p>
<p> seeing a far greater awareness throughout the country generally of the</p>
<p> extraordinary sensitivity of communities and you put your finger on it</p>
<p> because once the bank closes, cash flows go elsewhere and it has an impact</p>
<p> on the whole sort of economic base of the town and the rural transaction</p>
<p> centres are designed to, as a way of the Government intervening and trying</p>
<p> to bring back services. I think you bring about a big change in the psychology</p>
<p> of a small community if you're actually seen to be putting some services</p>
<p> back. In the last 10 years, it has been a case of the services disappearing</p>
<p> and I think that's tremendously important but your particular question</p>
<p> I'll have investigated and will come back to you.</p>
<p> QUESTION: [Farmers financial burdens, fertiliser bounty]</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I can't argue with any of the facts you put forward about and they</p>
<p> really highlight the acknowledgement I made in my speech about the what's</p>
<p> happened to commodity prices and the impact that has had. In relation</p>
<p> to the problem of I guess keeping younger people on the land, one of the</p>
<p> things we have tried to do is, by changes to the assets test rules to</p>
<p> ease the intergenerational transfer of title to properties which has facilitated</p>
<p> the transfer of properties and therefore has made some contribution to</p>
<p> addressing that problem. Only some, I don't pretend it's made</p>
<p> a huge contribution. You asked me specifically have we considered a bounty.</p>
<p> The quite concise answer is no we haven't considered reintroducing</p>
<p> it. We have taken the view that the best way of addressing the particular</p>
<p> cost problems of farmers is to try and address them right across the board</p>
<p> in relation to things like fuel and we've done that with the new</p>
<p> tax system. The benefits of cheaper fuel for farmers will be very significant</p>
<p> indeed. I made a commitment to the annual meeting of the National Farmers</p>
<p> Federation in Longreach last year that in any discussions that we would</p>
<p> keep benefits for the bush of the original tax package and they have in</p>
<p> fact been, not only kept but slightly improved because the diesel concession</p>
<p> now applies to rail carriage which is of particular benefit to wheat farmers</p>
<p> in different parts of the country. I acknowledge what you said about interest</p>
<p> rates, I mean interest rates are a lot lower now than they were and that</p>
<p> is of very great benefit but we have generally taken the view, I'm</p>
<p> answering your question very directly that rather than reintroduce particular</p>
<p> bounties for particular products, it is better to try and reduce the cost</p>
<p> of something that everybody in the bush uses such as fuel or something</p>
<p> which everybody at various stages is subject to and that is the cost of</p>
<p> money.</p>
<p> QUESTION: [Automotive industry import protection]</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I've had that put to me some years ago but this is the first question</p>
<p> I've had on it for several years. You believe it is doing quite serious</p>
<p> damage to your motor dealers? Well I can't say to you, we had a judgement</p>
<p> a couple of years ago for a combination of trade and other reasons that</p>
<p> we wouldn't make any change to the existing arrangements. I can undertake</p>
<p> in the spirit of what I did in relation to a number of other questions</p>
<p> raised to look at the arguments again. When it came before us a couple</p>
<p> of years ago the view was taken that given what we were seeking to achieve</p>
<p> in relation to trading arrangements in other areas and given the general</p>
<p> buoyancy of the industry, which was certainly the case a couple of years</p>
<p> ago and still generally speaking is, I mean I don't think it can</p>
<p> be doubted it is still a very strong industry but there wasn't a</p>
<p> case for further restrictions without promising that we will change it</p>
<p> I can promise to look at it again I'm sure I'll be able to get</p>
<p> back to you through Barry Wakelin when I've done that.</p>
