TRANSCRIPT OF PRIME MINISTER'S COMMENTS TO THE PRESS AT<br />
INTERNATIONAL MOTOR RALLY, SYDNEY, 8 APRIL 1978<br />
We had a meeting yesterday. Mr Viner has reported<br />
publicly, and officials are working on a number of options<br />
available to the Commonwealth. We have had for several days<br />
a group of officials and Ministers working to analyse<br />
what courses of action the Queensland Government might take<br />
and what we ought to do if they did take action.<br />
The legislation that we had introduced was confined, as it was,<br />
to its proper purpose in relating to the circumstances of<br />
Aborigines on Queensland reserves, because we believed and hoped<br />
that the Queensland Government would then discuss with us the<br />
best way of providing for the means of the Aborigine people<br />
because that is what it is all about. So far as states rights<br />
is concerned that is a nonsense issue on this question because<br />
the people of Australia determined that by, I think, about<br />
eight to one an overwhelming majority including an<br />
overwhelming majority in the state of Queensland itself.<br />
QUESTION: Well do you think what the-Bjelke-Petersen Government<br />
has done indicates that it has an over-riding concern for the<br />
Aborigines, or is it concerned about maintaining states rights?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I don't think it will be helped if I try and<br />
judge-the motivations of the Queensland Government.<br />
QUESTION: Did you anticipate that move by them Sir?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: This is one of the moves that we thought they<br />
might undertake, but we hoped that they wouldn't.<br />
QUESTION: What options does it leave for you now?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: There are a number of options and the Government<br />
will be examining these on Monday. The only thing that I want<br />
to make completely clear, and I think Ian Viner did last night,<br />
is that our concern is overwhelmingly and predominantly<br />
the interests of the Aborigine people, to establish the circumstance<br />
in which they can and will be treated as equals with other<br />
Australians. QUESTION: long legal wrangle Sir? What is going to happen to<br />
the Aborigines while that goes on?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: This is one of the matters that concerns us,<br />
but it will not deter us from pursuing the course which we believe<br />
is right and necessary in achieving racial equality in Australia<br />
