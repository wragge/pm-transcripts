FOR PRESS P. M. No. 68/ 1966<br />
UNITED KINGDOLI ECONOIEC 1EASURES<br />
Comment by the Prime Minister, I1r. Harold Holt<br />
It is obvious that the inrmediate purpose of the United Kingdom<br />
measures is to strengthen their Balance of Payments and thereby<br />
improve the position of sterling.<br />
The measures are designed to do this mainly by achieving what<br />
M r. Harold Wilson called a " shake-out which will release the nation's<br />
manpower, skilled and unskilled, and lead to a more purposive use of<br />
labour for the sake of increasing exports and giving effect to other<br />
national priorities."<br />
We have a fundamental interest in the soundness and progress<br />
of the United Kingdom economy and in the strength of sterling, of<br />
which we are a large holder. We are glad to see this evidence of<br />
British deterrination to keep sterling strong and wish the measures<br />
success in their objectives.<br />
As Mr. Wilson pointed out, British exports had been rising<br />
until the recent seamen's strike. At the same time also imports<br />
had been rising, and this was without doubt a consequence of the<br />
high level of domestic demand. What the measures seek to do is to<br />
impose widespread restraint on domestic demand and through this<br />
secure a re-deployment of labour and other resources.<br />
Taken with the recent rise in bank rate, the measures should<br />
have a fairly strong restraining effect. While it is too early<br />
to make firm forecasts, vie may feel some adverse effect of this<br />
through the impact on cor: Lrodity prices.<br />
The more direct measures to strengthen the United Kingdom<br />
Balance of Payments by reducing Government expenditure overseas<br />
includes action on military expenditure.<br />
This has, of course, been under discussion<br />
for some ti, e. Mr. WAlilson has m. ade it clear that the savings Vuil<br />
be sought without altering the basic lines of external policy,<br />
stated in their defence ' Uhite Paper.<br />
