PRIME MINISTER<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING, MP<br />
JAKARTA WEDNESDAY, 22 APRIL 1992<br />
Ladies and gentlemen<br />
I have come to Indonesia, on this my first overseas visit as<br />
Prime Minister, because Indonesia is in the first rank of<br />
Australia' s priorities.<br />
As our close neighbour, as the fourth most populous country<br />
in the world, as a rapidly growing economy in the most<br />
rapidly growing part of the world, as a key player in this<br />
region where our future lies, Indonesia commands Australia's<br />
attention. It Is often said that no two neighbours could be so<br />
dissimilar as we are.<br />
Culturally we are very different demographically,<br />
historically. It is not surprising that we have sometimes been at odds:<br />
or that relations have occasionally been strained.<br />
But our relationship is changing.<br />
in recqrat years we have built substantial links diplomatic<br />
links, cultural links and in particular, commercial links.<br />
it is remarkable how a relationship can grow when concrete<br />
common interests are found and we determine, jointly, to<br />
pursue them.<br />
Very different we may be, but we have found, I think, that<br />
the destinies of our two countries are joined.<br />
I should like this visit to signal that.<br />
in fact the threads of our relationship are long and strong. </p>

The Second World War brought Australians arnd Indonesians<br />
into extensive contact with each other.<br />
After the war there was widespread Sympathy among<br />
Australians for the cause of Indonesian independence.<br />
The sympathy found concrete expression when, in the Course<br />
of the Indonesian struggle, the Australian labour movement<br />
imposed boycotts and black bans against Dutch shipping.<br />
In 1947 it was Australia, together with India, which brought<br />
the matter of Indonesian independence before the UN Security<br />
Council. Shortly after, Australia was nominated by Indonesia to sit<br />
on the three-nation United Nations Good Offices Committee..<br />
As one commentator said, this display of confidence in<br />
Australia by Indonesia was the high-water mark of relations<br />
between our countries in the early post-war years.<br />
Australia co-sponsored Indonesia's admission to the United<br />
Nations in 1950.<br />
The achievement of your independence was thus one of the<br />
proud moments in the history of Australian diplomacy.<br />
But of course the historical threads go well beyond the lost<br />
fifty years.<br />
Australia, after all, was once called New Holland.<br />
Not many years after the Dutch established themselves in<br />
Indonesia, one of their number, named Abel Tasman, sailed<br />
from Jakarta or Batavia as it was then known along the<br />
west and south coasts of Australia.<br />
He left Australia, rather ungraciously remarking, " there is<br />
no good to be done here"<br />
And he sailed on to trade with places in the north,<br />
including Japan.<br />
Asia hdS long been a theatre for trade between dissimilar<br />
societies, and Australia and Indonesia have long been a part<br />
of it.<br />
Before Europeans traded In the region, fishermen from the<br />
M'akassar area in what was then called the Celebes, were<br />
trading with China in trepang gathered of f the northern<br />
Australian coast.<br />
This was Australia's first export commodity; and a valueadded<br />
one at that for, with the cooperation and assistance<br />
of the Australian Aboriginals, the trepang was cured and<br />
smoked on Australian shores for export to China. </p>
<p>.22Apr. 9129 : 23 NO. U25 e. U3'/ 10<br />

The cultural influence of this trade can still be seen in<br />
the language and culture of the Australian Aboriginals who<br />
came in contact with the peoples from the Makassar area.<br />
In the era of colonial Australia and colonial Indonesia,<br />
Jakarta was a refuge and source of supplies for British<br />
ships beginning with James Cook's Endeavour.<br />
In the first half of 1790, the infant British colony at<br />
Sydney Cove, cut of f from home, terribly alone, and as yet<br />
incapable of making the new environment yield food, sent a<br />
ship to Jakarta for supplies.<br />
By the time it returned, British ships had arrived and the<br />
colony was saved, but the ship from Jakarta was very welcome<br />
nonetheless. Ladies and gentlemen, as we plan our strategic, trading and<br />
cultural relationships in this last decade of the twentieth<br />
century, it is worth bearing these historical threads in<br />
mind. Together they suggest a pattern of interdependence.<br />
They hint at what can be done.<br />
Today we believe a great deal can be done not merely in<br />
response to immediate needs, but in pursuit of 8 worthwhile<br />
and enduring relationship between our two countries.<br />
In quite different ways we have both emerged from a colonial<br />
past. We have both committed ourselves to the kind of<br />
radical economic reform which will give our nations a secure<br />
place in the world.<br />
The Australian government believes that all we do in the<br />
world, in Asia and the Pacific, all we do in Indonesia, we<br />
will do best as a nation of independent and unambivalent<br />
mind. We have long been independent.<br />
But, perhaps because we are a European country living<br />
alongside Asia, the residues of colonialism have tended to<br />
persist i.<br />
There is a conservative element in Australian society not<br />
so strong as it was, but influential just the same which,<br />
through its attachment to the past and its anxiety about the<br />
Asia-Pacific future, tends to resist the full expression of<br />
Australian nationhood.<br />
It is the same element which opposed Indonesian independence<br />
in the 1940s.<br />
Attitudes are often the last things to change. </p>
<p>TEL* 9 92 N&amp; o. 23 P. 04/ 13<br />

As I'm sure it affected Indonesia long after independence,<br />
the colonial legacy still affects us, arnd we still face<br />
questions about what part of it we should retain and what<br />
parts cast off.<br />
A great deal of our British colonial heritage underpins our<br />
political and legal institutions. It remains a defining<br />
element in our culture.<br />
We do not seek to change these things.<br />
But our population is no longer the overwhelmingly British<br />
one it was.<br />
Contemporary Australia is multicultural the old<br />
Australians of English, Scots and Irish stock having been<br />
joined by large numbers of people from all the countries of<br />
Europe, the Middle East, the Americas and Asia. By that<br />
measure alone we are very much part of the world.<br />
Multi-culturalism has Cone much to break down our fear of<br />
cultural difference, and therefore our old fear of Asia.<br />
We are substantially changed in this.<br />
We are more worldly, more mature.<br />
So should we be.<br />
By most measures we are not a young country. The<br />
Commonwealth of Australia is almost 100 years old.<br />
Australian democracy, founded in the 1850s, is much older<br />
than most democracies in the world.<br />
There should be no question about our identity or where our<br />
loyalties lie.<br />
For far too long we have measured the strength of our<br />
society, the level of our sophistication, the worth of our<br />
achievements, against Britain and Europe and against the<br />
United States.<br />
At times we have done this while clinging to such vestiges<br />
of the pid imperial power and culture as will, we think,<br />
earn us respect in the world.<br />
We think the time has come to step out of the colonial<br />
shadow and make our position clear:<br />
we are Australian<br />
we are engaged with Asia.<br />
We are different -culturally, historically, politically<br />
but we can handle the difference. </p>
<p>TEL: 22. Fpr. 92 19: 23 No. 023 P. 05/ 13<br />
We believe we can contribute something to what is already a<br />
diverse region. The Asia-Pacific, as well as Indonesia, can<br />
achieve unity in diversity.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen, the Australian government is actively<br />
and unequivocally committed to this region and to<br />
developing, in particular, a relationship with Indonesia.<br />
In significant ways we have shared the past. If we are<br />
prepared to put in the effort, we can share a much more<br />
substantial future.<br />
In the forty-two years of our diplomatic relations, there<br />
have been substantial achievements as well as periodic<br />
setbacks. If we reflect on that experience, I think we will see that<br />
we have made progress when we have been realistic.<br />
we have achieved things, end been able to protect those<br />
achievements, when we have found a tangible basis for our<br />
work. We have been disappointed, I think, when we have failed to<br />
take sufficient account of our different outlooks.<br />
We are very different countries. We will always see some<br />
things differently.<br />
What we need for a successful bilateral relationship is the<br />
firm ground of tangible achievements, and real incentives to<br />
see us through the times when good will is not enough.<br />
We need to identify our shared interests and create the<br />
institutional links which will consolidate our progress.<br />
We need to create the conditions in which new shared<br />
interests will emerge.<br />
To point the way towards a more secure relationship, let me<br />
say where I think some of our most important common<br />
interests lie.<br />
Most obviously we share an interest in success.<br />
More, probably, than most Australians appreciate, our<br />
country has benefited enormously from the success of yours<br />
in recent years.<br />
Our experience of nation-building has not followed the same<br />
path as yours.<br />
As a consequence, we are inclined sometimes to underestimate<br />
how difficult it is to achieve orderly development in a<br />
nation as vast as Indonesia, and as culturally, ethnically<br />
and religiously diverse.<br />
The achievements of President Soeharto's New Order are very<br />
great. </p>
<p>TEL 6<br />
Between 1966 and 1991, Indonesia's real GDP rose 450 per<br />
cent. Its real growth rate over this period has been one of the<br />
highest among developing countries.<br />
Structural change has been rapid: agriculture's share of GDP<br />
is half what it was a quarter century ago.<br />
in the late 1970s Indonesia was the world's largest importer<br />
of rice. In 1984 Indonesia became self-sufficient.<br />
The people of Indonesia are now better fed, housed and<br />
educated than ever before. Infant mortality rates are<br />
approximately half what they were.<br />
These are triumphs.<br />
But the achievements of the Soeharto Government spread wider<br />
than this.<br />
In establishing political stability and economic progress in<br />
Indonesia, your government has contributed to stability and<br />
prosperity In the wider South-East Asian region.<br />
Australia is among the beneficiaries.<br />
We gain commercially, of course; but just as importantly,<br />
our national security benefits from 8 benign environment<br />
where not so many years ago there was great uncertainty and<br />
volatility. We share with Indonesia a fundamental interest in the<br />
strategic stability of our region, and in limiting the<br />
potential for external powers to introduce tension or<br />
conflict. Recognising this shared strategic interest, we are keen to<br />
work with Indonesia as equal partners to strengthen<br />
bilateral defence relations.<br />
There is scope for building closer links between our armed<br />
forces and defence organisations. We can do this with more<br />
high-livel visits and consultations, combined exercises,<br />
training and other exchanges.<br />
Earlier I referred to those seamen from the Makassar area<br />
who for hundreds of years made annual calls to harvest the<br />
trepang from the shores of Aboriginal Australia.<br />
Plainly, for hundreds of years a commlon Interest was<br />
recognised and practical arrangements devised.<br />
So now our practical interactions as neighbouring countries<br />
create another category of shared interests.<br />
our maritime border is the most obvious of these.<br />

Most of the sea-bed boundaries were formally delimited<br />
twenty years ago, but there remained important areas where<br />
agreement had not been reached.<br />
The most extensive of these was the Timor Gap, covering<br />
potentially rich reserves of oil and gas under the Timor<br />
Sea. Rather than attempt to reconcile different legal<br />
interpretations of rights over the continental shelf, the<br />
two governments established a joint development zone for the<br />
cooperative exploration and exploitation of the area's<br />
petroleum resources.<br />
The Timor Gap zone of Cooperation Treaty, which entered into<br />
force in February 1991, is a triumph of creative cooperation<br />
between our two governments. It is the most substantial<br />
bilateral agreement we have concluded.<br />
It demonstrates conclusively that we can find imaginative<br />
solutions to bilateral problems when we recognise the common<br />
interest and apply to it the necessary political will.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen, earlier today three more bilateral<br />
agreements were signed.<br />
They deal with double taxation, extradition and fisheries<br />
cooperation. in practical ways they each expand and strengthen the<br />
framework to improve the bilateral interaction between<br />
Australia and Indonesia as outward-looking neighbours.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen, as everyone here is aware, the<br />
situation in East Timor has been a recurring and sometimes<br />
divisive issue In ou relations.<br />
I should take this opportunity to explain that the<br />
disproportionate attention East Timor receives in Australia<br />
does not mean that we are not interested in the welfare of<br />
the 182 million people who live in Indonesia's 26 other<br />
provinces. The atl~ ention East Timor receives, internationally and in<br />
Australia, is a natural consequence of the territory's<br />
uniquely troubled history, beginning with its neglect under<br />
Portuguese rule.<br />
We carry no brief for the Portuguese occupation of the<br />
territory, or for the manner of their leaving or their<br />
recent diplomatic manoeuvres.<br />
Australia's outlook has been shaped by the additional<br />
factors of our proximity to East Timor, the fraternal links<br />
we had with the people of East Timor during the Second World<br />
War, and the sizeable East Timorese community which now<br />
lives in Australia. T2E2L:. fRpr. 92 19: 23 No. 023 P. 0( 11.5 </p>
<p>TFLL 8<br />
Australia made it clear that it did not condone the manner<br />
in which Indonesia acquired East Timor, but since 1979 we<br />
have accepted Indonesian sovereignty over the territory.<br />
The Australian Government has made clear its views about the<br />
tragic events in Diii last November.<br />
We consider the subsequent actions of the Indonesian<br />
Government, including President Soeharto's public statements<br />
and the measures announced by the Army Chief-of-Staff on 27<br />
February, to constitute a credible response.<br />
Our continuing concern is with what practical help we might<br />
be able to give to the people of East Timor.<br />
Our aim as concerned outsiders is to assist where we can in<br />
measures for their welfare, and to support a process of<br />
reconciliation between them and the Indonesian authorities.<br />
I am pleased that during this visit our two governments have<br />
been able to sign a memorandum covering an 11.5 million<br />
dollar Australian aid project to improve water supply and<br />
sanitation in parts of East Timor.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen, in coming to terms with a more fluid<br />
political environment in Asia, Australia and Indonesia have<br />
ample scope to cooperate in helping shape the regional<br />
agenda. Indonesia.' s regional credentials are very clear.<br />
it is a leading member of the Association of South-East<br />
Asian Nations ( ASEAN), which is a focus of wider dialogue<br />
and cooperation.<br />
I should like to think that Australia, too, has demonstrated<br />
an ability to contribute usefully to regional diplomacy in<br />
recent years.<br />
Our two countries have invested considerable effort in the<br />
long negotiations leading up to last October's<br />
comprehensive political settlement of the Cambodia conflict.<br />
our arrqed forces are now serving in Cambodia as part of the<br />
United Nations peace-keeping presence.<br />
We have also worked closely together to encourage a regional<br />
dialogue on security issues, centred on the ASEAN PMC<br />
process. Ladies and gentlemen, I said at the beginning of this<br />
address that it is remarkable what can be achieved when<br />
common interests are identified and pursued. And they will<br />
be pursued the harder if they are material common Interests.<br />

<p>TEL 9<br />
It is one of the happy coincidences of the history of our<br />
two nations that in recent years we have adopted economic<br />
strategies which greatly multiply our common interests.<br />
We were both overly dependent on commodities. We have both<br />
sought to correct our external Imbalances. We have both<br />
liberalised our economies.<br />
Since coming to office in 1983, the Australian Government<br />
has removed exchange controls, floated the Australian dollar<br />
and made it a more competitive currency, deregulated banking<br />
and radically reduced import protection.<br />
We have cut back the government Sector and cut taxes. We<br />
are now encouraging an historic shift from industry-wide<br />
labour relations arrangements to workplace bargaining.<br />
In the same period Indonesia has transformed its economy by<br />
implementing strikingly similar policies.<br />
Banking has been deregulated and monetary policy changed so<br />
that it now relies on interest rates instead of credit<br />
restrictions. Indonesia has cut protection against imports, increased<br />
manufacturing production and reduced dependence on<br />
commodities. You too have cut back on government spending, rationalised<br />
taxes and created a competitive exchange rate.<br />
Both our economies are now much more open and outward<br />
looking. Both are more competitive and more diverse I would venture<br />
to say, more creative.<br />
I would 81s0 go so far as to say that what we have done has<br />
given our countries a better chance in the modern world.<br />
Our own success might be seen in the growth of our economy<br />
by more than one third in the past decade, in the fact that<br />
we are exporting more, that our trade is increasingly with<br />
our regional neighbours, and the contents of exports now<br />
includds a significant proportion of services and<br />
manufactures, in addition to our traditional strengths in<br />
food, minerals and other raw materials.<br />
Indonesia's success might be measured in those dramatic<br />
improvements in living standards I referred to earlier, and<br />
in average real GDP growth of about 6 per cent during the<br />
1980s. Ladies and gentlemen, this common strategy of creating<br />
liberal market-oriented economies produces, as I said,<br />
common interests.<br />
Concrete common interests. TL! 22. Hpr. 2qz 1Y: ZO riO. VZ </p>

It has taken longer than it should have, but in recent years<br />
Australia and Indonesia have discovered each other<br />
commercially. We have discovered that we have goods and services to<br />
exczhange and investments to make.<br />
Between 1989 and 1991 two-way trade increased by 66 per<br />
cant, to be worth approximately 2.4 billion Australian<br />
dollars. Australian investment in Indonesia has increased markedly.<br />
Indonesian companies are now also starting to invest in<br />
Australia. The trade in services is also growing in tourism,<br />
education, medicine, and support industries for the major<br />
mining ventures.<br />
There are many other areas in which Australian expertise<br />
should be able to find niches in Indonesia. Pleasing as the<br />
trend of recent years has been, we know that we have the<br />
potential to play a much bigger part.<br />
We have much to offer in the way of raw materials, capital<br />
equipment and technology.<br />
Australia's experience in coping with similar climates,<br />
extensive coastlines and long distances has produced<br />
technology and solutions well-suited to Indonesia often<br />
much better suited than the products of, say, Japan, Germany<br />
or the United States.<br />
Our experience and expertise in many other other areas is<br />
second to none in the world in forest management, solar<br />
technology, food processing and coal-fired power stations<br />
for instance.<br />
We can assist as exporters, but just as readily as joint<br />
venture partners.<br />
I'm confident that we will find the larger role we seek.<br />
As both countries expand along this liberal economic path we<br />
can expect the trade to grow. We Can expect the range of<br />
shared interests to grow.<br />
We can expect, I believe, a much more productive and durable<br />
relationship between our two countries.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen, in recent public statements in<br />
Australia, I have emphasised the need for us to come to<br />
terms with the economic vitality of the Asia-Pacific region.<br />
Our external policy reflects the interest we share with you<br />
in maintaining a sound multilateral system for international<br />
trade. </p>
<p>ILL: L LL. Hpr JZ Z Pflu.'<br />
Indonesia and Australia have worked together within the<br />
Cairns Group in order to achieve the result we both need<br />
from the Uruguay Round the liberalisation of international<br />
agricultural trade.<br />
We have also both given strong support to the Asia-Pacific<br />
Economic Cooperation or APEC process.<br />
I do not believe it Is in the interests of either of us to<br />
have the international trading system degenerate into rival<br />
blocs. We would both lose in a situation where the countries of<br />
East Asia saw themselves as an economic bloc in rivalry with<br />
those of Europe and North America.<br />
The central idea of APEC is to build on existing networks of<br />
economic interdependence throughout the ASia-Pacific region.<br />
I believe we should continue to work through APEC to promote<br />
an open regionalism which is compatible with a wider<br />
multilateral trading system.<br />
Regardless of the outcome of the Uruguay Round, APEC'S value<br />
will grow considerably if a process of non-discriminatory<br />
regional trade liberalisation can be carried forward with<br />
conviction. Australia has assured Indonesia that our vigorous support<br />
for the APEC process in no sense qualifies our recognition<br />
of the achievements and potential of ASEAN.<br />
We appreciate the great value of ASEAN.<br />
We share its members' belief in the advancement of political<br />
end economic cooperation.<br />
We admire its contribution to wider stability and harmony in<br />
the Asia-Pacific region.<br />
The adoption at lost January's ASEAN Summit of a proposal to<br />
establish an ASEAN Free Trade Area highlights the continuing<br />
vitalitX and significance of the organisation.<br />
Australia particularly welcomed Indonesia's strong<br />
endorsement of APEC at the ASEAN Summit.<br />
Your position underlines the compatibility of the ASEAN and<br />
APEC mechanisms.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen, we who live in this part of the world<br />
live in dynamic times.<br />
Our two countries which, on the face of things, are so<br />
different have these times In common.<br />
We have shared much in the past. We now share the future. </p>
<p>TEL: 12<br />
We need not compromise the integrity of our cultures or our<br />
beliefs arnd values to work fruitfully together.<br />
We know that we will each be stronger for the other's<br />
success. -In coming years I think you Will notice that there has been<br />
a change in the way Australia does things.<br />
in the 1980s some of us were struck with the thought that,<br />
if we did not change, the Society we had built would not be<br />
sustainable.<br />
We had to change direction: and in the past decade that is<br />
what we have done.<br />
Australians have taken up the challenge of economic reform.<br />
They have made the cultural leap necessary to change the<br />
industrial culture the culture of work and management.<br />
Just as we have learned how to build a tolerant and fair<br />
multicultural aociety, where once we were fearful of<br />
difference, we have learned how to build a competitive<br />
economy, where until very recently we were less than<br />
Competitive. These days few Populations are so economically aware as<br />
Australia's. It is the sharpened awareness one has when a<br />
disaster has been narrowly avoided.<br />
We know what has to be done.<br />
If these have been dramatic changes, so too-has been the<br />
change in the way Australians perceive themselves in the<br />
world. It has taken longer than perhaps it should have, but I think<br />
it can now be safely said that most Australians see Asia<br />
and the Pacific as holding the key to our future.<br />
This thought is not new. There have been Australians saying<br />
it for ' fifty years.<br />
The difference is that this time we have not only recognised<br />
that our future belongs in the region, but we're engaging<br />
with it as we never have before..<br />
Along with our efforts to build our economic strength, the<br />
talk now is about nationhood and being Australians of<br />
independent mind.<br />
It requires a considerable conscious effort to overcome all<br />
the effects of even a relatively benign colonialism.<br />

As I said earlier, attitudes are often the last things to<br />
change. Among the other lessons we have learnt in recent years is<br />
that, like the colony at Sydney Cove as it waited for the<br />
ship to return from Jakarta, we really are on our own.<br />
That is why more than ever before we have to think for<br />
ourselves, be sure of ourselves be, without a trace of<br />
ambivalence, one Australian nation.<br />
We urge you not to think of Australia as the place it was<br />
twenty years ago, even a decade ago.<br />
Think of it as the place it is now, and as it intends to be<br />
a partner in the dynamic new world of the Asia-Pacific<br />
region. Increasingly, that is how we Australians are thinking of it.<br />
