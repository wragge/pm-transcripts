PRIME MINISTER 99/ 95<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING, MP<br />
APPOINTMENT OF PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSIONER<br />
The Government will recommend to the Governor-General the appointment of<br />
Dr Peter Shergold as the new Public Service Commissioner when Mr Denis<br />
Ives' five year term ends on 24 September 1995.<br />
Dr Shergold is currently the Chief Executive Officer of Comcare Australia. In<br />
1987, following a career as an academic in Australia and overseas, he<br />
became head of the Office of Multicultural Affairs in the Department of the<br />
Prime Minister and Cabinet. He became Deputy Secretary of the Department<br />
in 1990 and from 1991 to 1994 he was the Chief Executive Officer of the<br />
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission.<br />
Mr Ives has provided leadership as Public Service Commissioner over the<br />
last five years during a demanding period of change for the Australian Public<br />
Service ( APS). It has been a time when the APS has given unprecedented<br />
attention to its accountability for its actions and to the provision of dedicated<br />
and flexible service to the community. Mr Ives has played a major role in<br />
promoting management reforms throughout the APS. His work has been<br />
directed in particular towards ensuring a skilled public service, free of<br />
discrimination and with high standards of professional and ethical behaviour.<br />
Pending the availability of a further senior appointment, Mr Ives will<br />
undertake special duties for the Government in public administration and the<br />
delivery of government services.<br />
The Government is grateful for Mr Ives' contribution to the strengthening of<br />
public service in Australia.<br />
