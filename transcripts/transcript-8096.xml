PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW WITH MATT PEACOCK, ABC AM<br />
22 AUGUST 1990<br />
E OE PROOF ONLY<br />
PM: The vision is clear for those who want to see it and<br />
who don't put their blinkers of prejudice over their eyes<br />
or over their one eye. What are the challenges facing<br />
this country? You ask yourself that question then you<br />
ask what's the strategy. The challenges facing this<br />
country are the current account deficit, inflation and<br />
micro-economic reform. Let me take the latter first<br />
micro-economic reform. We've made it quite clear in the<br />
period leading up to this budget that on our record we're<br />
entitled to look any critic in the eye, and particularly<br />
any hypocrit from the Opposition, and say you look at the<br />
Hawke Government's record of micro-economic reform and it<br />
beats the bejesus out of anyone.<br />
PEACOCK: But in this budget<br />
PM: Wait a minute. Wait a minute. I haven't finished<br />
my answer. We are coming into this budget with the best<br />
record of micro-economic reform of any government in the<br />
history of this country. Now we've made it quite clear<br />
that we have underway, we've already announced a very<br />
significant program of continuing micro-economic reform.<br />
The particular extensions to that program that we'll be<br />
announcing this year, have to wait until after the<br />
budget, because as is well known we're going to the Party<br />
conference to tackle there certain aspects of our policy<br />
which currently act as some inhibition, particularly in<br />
the area of telecommunications reform.<br />
PEACOCK: That's the point though isn't it. In the<br />
budget at the moment virtually it says watch this space.<br />
Does it disappoint you that<br />
PM: No, it doesn't. It's a very relevant budget in<br />
terms of tackling the other two challenges that I talked<br />
about. Now, on the micro-economic reform front it's not<br />
as though it is simply the budget at this point. We have<br />
continuing reforms going on in the waterfront and in the<br />
area of road and rail reform we're working with the<br />
States in those areas. It's simply that in regard to<br />
telecommunications and what we may be able to do in the<br />
airlines, on those two particular areas and those two<br />
alone, we need to have this matter discussed in our Party<br />
conference. I'm confident that we'll get a sensible and </p>
<p>2<br />
constructive resolution out of that which will enable us,<br />
as a government, before the end of this year to announce<br />
further significant reforms in those areas.<br />
PEACOCK: But at the start of this term you said you<br />
wanted to quicken the pace of micro-economic reform. If<br />
anything you've had to delay it, haven't you?<br />
PM: No, on the contrary. The work is being done. It's<br />
only in the two areas of telecommunications and the<br />
airlines where we need the change of position in the<br />
Party. But in all other areas the work is continuing.<br />
PEACOCK: If I can just deal with a couple of items where<br />
people have been critical of the Budget the situation<br />
with pensioners. They're saying why not attack the<br />
doctors, they're the people that write the scripts.<br />
PM: It's not a question of attacking the doctors. In<br />
terms of asking for some restraint from doctors, of<br />
course we have delayed the next increase in GPs'<br />
remuneration from August to later in the year and they've<br />
been asked to play their part. But there's no attack on<br />
the pensioners. What has been involved there is a very<br />
simple and may I say absolutely necessary reform as far<br />
as the future welfare of this country is concerned. One<br />
of the most telling statistics in the Treasurer's speech<br />
tonight was this, and you'll recall he said that it took<br />
almost 40 years for the cost of the pharmaceutical<br />
benefits scheme to rise to half a billion dollars. So<br />
the next half a billion increase in cost took only four<br />
years. It simply is essential that that problem be<br />
attacked and that's what's being done with the reforms in<br />
the pharmaceutical benefits area. But the important<br />
thing as far as the pensioners are concerned is this<br />
that they are not going to be paying the price. They are<br />
going to pay the $ 2.50 per prescription but that will be<br />
for so many of them more than compensated by the $ 2.50 a<br />
week increase in the pension. No pensioner should be<br />
worse off as a result of this decision.<br />
PEACOCK: Mr Hawke, if I could move to the situation in<br />
the Middle East. You said originally that our ships were<br />
going to enforce the blockade. Has that changed and do<br />
you or even they know yet precisely what their role will<br />
be? PM: I've been quite consistent in what I've been saying<br />
and I made it clear from the beginning that the precise<br />
use of the Australian forces would emerge from<br />
discussions that we'd be having with like-minded<br />
countries and most particularly with the United States.<br />
I made it clear that it was going to take some 22 days<br />
for our ships to get from Australia to the Gulf region<br />
and in that period we here would be finalising our rules<br />
of engagement. Let me make one point on the rules of<br />
engagement. There seems to be some stupid assumption on<br />
the part of some members of the Opposition from some<br />
1.. </p>
<p>~ 4. 3<br />
things they were saying that when the rules of engagement<br />
were finalised that it would become a public document.<br />
It just shows how little in fact they know about these<br />
areas. But the point is that what we will be doing will<br />
be playing our part with others in ensuring, as far as we<br />
can, that those sanctions are obeyed. Now if you want to<br />
say that's part of enforcing the blockade, it's not an<br />
incorrect use of language. But never was I saying look<br />
we're steaming over there to shoot salvos into shipping<br />
or across their bows. I said we were going over there to<br />
play our part and we will. What has been agreed is that<br />
the most useful contribution that we can make will be one<br />
which I've identified as having the four elements of<br />
identification, contact, interrogation and warning. It<br />
is clearly agreed with those with whom we talked, and I'd<br />
say particularly with the United States who have the<br />
largest component in the area, that this is an effective<br />
use of the Australian naval asset.<br />
4 PEACOCK: The United States has described the Americans<br />
in Kuwait and Iraq as hostages. If the Australians there<br />
at the moment are harmed, what will our response be?<br />
PM: Well we're doing everything we possibly can to<br />
ensure that that doesn't happen. I concede that the use<br />
of the word hostage by the President of the United States<br />
is an appropriate use of language. It's very difficult<br />
to describe them as anything else. The evidence is<br />
certainly alarming about what seems to be an increasing<br />
dispersion of foreigners there to their various<br />
aggressive installations. I can say at this point we<br />
have no specific evidence of Austalians being in that<br />
category but I must say honestly and directly to my<br />
fellow Australians that if this sort of thing is<br />
happening to others that we can't have any confidence<br />
that it's not going to happen to Australians.<br />
PEACOCK: Mr Hawke, thanks for joining us.<br />
PM: Thanks very much Matt.<br />
