SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
LUNCHEON IN HONOUR OF PRESIDENT VACLAV HAVEL OF THE<br />
CZECH REPUBLIC, PARLIAMENT HOUSE, CANBERRA<br />
TUESDAY 28 MARCH 1995<br />
It is a great pleasure to welcome you here to Australia as the President of the<br />
Czech Republic.<br />
And it is a double pleasure to welcome you here in your own right.<br />
In other words, for who you are as well as who you represent.<br />
You are, of course, a very well known figure in Australia, as the public<br />
interest in your visit here shows.<br />
Because, despite our very different history and geography, Australians have<br />
long watched with sympathy and concern the struggle of the Czech people<br />
against the terrible varieties of repression which have afflicted Europe this<br />
century. And in recent years we have watched with admiration as you and your<br />
colleagues fought a tyrannical system, with great personal courage, without<br />
moral compromise.<br />
And we rejoiced when finally, remarkably, in one of the happiest events of the<br />
century, you brought that system tumbling down in the ' velvet revolution'.<br />
The critical act for any Government or people is the act of imagining.<br />
That has been one of your great contributions to your people, even at times<br />
when what you were imagining must have seemed unattainable.<br />
Yesterday, I received from the distinguished Australian novelist and poet<br />
Rodney Hall these remarks.<br />
' Vaclav Havel has contributed greatly to world literature. </p>
<p>Through his plays he speaks out courageously, with warmth, tolerance and<br />
good humour. They take us straight to the heart of the matter and involve us<br />
in the middle of situations we feel we already know to be the truth yet this is<br />
the truth shown in a totally new light.<br />
He gives us chunks of life, cut from their context with a scalpel, and set up in<br />
the limelight as a medical sample might be put under the microscope. It is<br />
art at the threshold of being the very life it reflects.<br />
Vaclav Havel can be funny and tragic in the same breath ( this is a rare and<br />
enviable talent) revealing a comic side to the tyranny of closed minds. As his<br />
audience, we come out of the theatre energized, convinced that we can do<br />
something about society and the way we are, which is a mark of exceptional<br />
quality." Mr President,<br />
Your essays, lectures, letters, and other writings are among the most vivid,<br />
sustained and searching explorations of moral and political responsibility<br />
produced anywhere in the world.<br />
At the heart of what you have written is your belief, as you have said, that<br />
' Society can be enriched and cultivated only through self-knowledge, and the<br />
main instrument of society's self-knowledge is its culture.'<br />
This truth is just as relevant to Australia in our different hemisphere, and<br />
with our different history as to Europe, as we address the task here of<br />
creating a tolerant, diverse, inclusive society open to the world, but true to<br />
our sense of ourselves.<br />
Central to this has been the issue of righting the dispossession of Australia's<br />
indigenous inhabitants.<br />
You are, I am told, the first state visitor from Europe ever to ask for an official<br />
program which includes the culture of Aboriginal Australians. That is a matter<br />
of pride and pleasure for us.<br />
Throughout your life, moral and intellectual accomplishments have been<br />
fused with a deep understanding of and concern for the lives and welfare of<br />
ordinary people.<br />
If I may say so, these are just the sort of qualities a President should have.<br />
Professor Robert Manne told the readers of the Melbourne Age last week that<br />
Czechs ' will eventually count as a singular blessing that their first President<br />
after the stale nightmare of communism, was a man of tolerance, taste,<br />
humour, curiosity, courage and honour'. </p>
<p>I am sure this view is shared by all Australians who have met you.<br />
Mr President,<br />
The timing of this visit to Australia could not be better.<br />
It was inevitable that the uncertainty which followed the 1989 revolution in<br />
Czechoslovakia would lead initially to a decline in our trade and commercial<br />
relations as old patterns changed.<br />
But that same event has created the strong base from which we can build a<br />
much closer relationship.<br />
Already our trade and investment links are growing.<br />
Australian businesses such as Brambles, Coca Cola Amatil, ADI,<br />
Pioneer Concrete, Bowral, Mincon and Blackhill Minerals are trying to build<br />
their operations in the Czech Republic.<br />
There is no doubt we can be doing more together.<br />
I made the point to European and Australian business people during a recent<br />
visit to Germany and the Netherlands that Australia's closer engagement with<br />
Asia, which has been at the core of this Governments approach to foreign<br />
policy, is not something we pursue at the expense of good relations with<br />
Europe.<br />
On the contrary, we are convinced that the more directly and fully involved<br />
Australia is with the countries of our own region, the more relevant, the more<br />
productive, our links with Europe will be.<br />
And beyond the commercial and economic relationship, I know there are<br />
opportunities for Australia and the Czech Republic to develop closer ties in<br />
cultural and social areas<br />
Australia has benefited enormously from our association with the Czech<br />
people. Directly, of course, from the thousands of Czechs who have made Australia<br />
their home and who have made such a valuable contribution to our national<br />
life to our manufacturing and mining industries in particular, to the<br />
professions.<br />
And to the arts. A Czech, Eduard Boravansky, was the father of the<br />
Australian ballet; Rudy Koman was almost as seminal a figure as a patron of<br />
Australian contemporary art; Czech musicians have been made a<br />
disproportionately large contribution to Australian music. </p>
<p>4<br />
But we have also benefited indirectly from what the Czech people have given<br />
the world from your musicians like Dvorak, Janacek, Smetana; and writers<br />
like Hasek, Kundera and Havel.<br />
Mr President,<br />
You have paid us a great tribute by coming to Australia, and by your interest<br />
in our country and our culture.<br />
I hope that over these few days you, Mrs Havlova and your party can take<br />
from Australia experiences which will live with you, as your words and<br />
experiences and those of the Czech people live with us.<br />
ENDS </p>
