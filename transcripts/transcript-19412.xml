<p>The Prime Minister tonight announced the winners of the prestigious National Awards for Local Government.</p>
<p>The awards were presented at the 4th Australian Council of Local Government in Canberra -  the nation's largest annual gathering of mayors and shire presidents.</p>
<p>The two award winners for 2013 are:</p>
<p>• Dungog Shire, Maitland City Council and Port Stephens Council from New South Wales for their Safer Motorcycle Routes project. Together, the three Councils developed a ‘safe system' approach that would make motorcyclists' recreational rides through the Hunter Region safer. This included working with motorcyclists and road organisations on an audit of the most problematic routes, the installation of more effective signage and the provision of enforcement bays for police to target speed. The community benefited with safer roads and better protected pedestrians.</p>
<p>• Northern Grampians Shire Council in Victoria for its Monash Steps/Stawell Steps project. This project incorporates two engineer-designed spillways aimed at diverting flood water away from nearby properties. In addition to providing protection against floods, the architecturally designed Stawell Steps has now become a community meeting space with wheelchair accessibility.</p>
<p>In addition, 17 councils and shires received awards across 10 categories today.</p>
<p>These awards show what can be achieved when a community works together and is thinking innovatively.</p>
<p>All four councils have done a tremendous job identifying local challenges and coming up with innovative solutions that are appropriate for their communities.</p>
<p>With 192 entries coming from all over Australia, it was a big task for the chair of the National Awards Judging Panel Cr Paul Bell AM, Central Highlands Regional Council and the panel in determining the winners.</p>
<p>The Gillard Government congratulates every council nominated for an award and the category winners.</p>
<p>As the tier of government closest to the people, local government delivers important services and infrastructure for their communities.</p>
<p>The Gillard Government is proud to work with the 565 elected councils across the nation that bring about positive and lasting change at the local level every day to make their communities, stronger communities.</p>
