Note: For reasons set out in footnote the percentage<br />
increase in " Total Payments" would not represent<br />
the effective increase in general revenue<br />
assistance available to the States in 1973-74.<br />
This is represented by the percentage increase<br />
after adding the additional assistance and<br />
before deducting Uhe tertiary education offsets.<br />

Special grants are supplemontary general revenue<br />
assistance paid on the recommendation of the Grants<br />
Commission. The Grants Commission has not yet<br />
made its recommendation of amounts for payment in<br />
1973-74.' For that reason, these payments are not<br />
included in these tables.<br />
Preliminary estimate.<br />
The tertiary education offsets are equal to the estimated<br />
savings to the States as a result of the Australian<br />
Government's assumption of full responsibility for<br />
financing tertiary education as from 1 January 1974.<br />
That is to say, the arrangements will not result in a<br />
rnet effective reduction in the funds available to the<br />
States. For this reason the percentage increases in<br />
" Total Pavyents" are . ot shown in these tables. The<br />
effective increase in the general revenue payments is<br />
represented by the . percentage increase after adding the<br />
additional assistance and before deducting the tertiary<br />
education offsets. </p>

At its June 1972 meeting the Loan Council approved a special allocation of $ 3 million<br />
for Queensland in 1972-73, for the purpose of financing certain works associated with<br />
beach erosion on the Gold Coast. The borrowing approval was not taken up by the State<br />
in 1972-73 and has been deferred until 1973-74.<br />
S&amp;<br />
The distribution between the States is based on the distribution of the 1972-73 basic<br />
programme. The temporary addition of $ 9 million for which Western Australia was " due" under<br />
arrangements originally discussed at the June 1970 Premiers' Conference/ Loan Council<br />
meeting and as since revised, has been reduced to $ 6. million under arrangements agreed<br />
at this meeting, which also involve additions to the State * srevenu. gar ants.<br />
