<p>  Prime Minister, a disappointing result.</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> Look I am broken-hearted that we could lose, a very cruel way to lose. But the team just played so bravely the whole match and...</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  Were we robbed Prime Minister?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> Oh no, look I don't know, there's no point in that, nobody's going to run around saying that, the team has been fantastic and the country is so proud of them, they performed way above where they were rated and it's just a very cruel way to lose. Right on the knocker like that and those penalties are very hard to keep out.</p>
<p> JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  We've gone further than anyone expected.</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> Far further than anybody expected and it's a real tribute to Mark and all the boys, to Guus Hiddink and also to Frank Lowy and John O'Neill who've really put their reputations and business acumen and sporting management skills on the line and I'd just say that I am very proud of them. I think 20 million Australians have very proud hearts tonight for the way they fought.</p>
<p> JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  And for the Australians in Leichhardt, congratulations?</p>
<p>   PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> Well to Italy, congratulations. Italy congratulations, thank-you.</p>
