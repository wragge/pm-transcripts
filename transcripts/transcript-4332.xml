FOR PRESS 24 FEBRUARY 1977<br />
" Joint Statement by the Prime Minister and the Acting Premier<br />
of Victoria<br />
VIC: TORIAN BUSH FIRES 1977 REPLACEMENT OF BOUNDARY FENCES<br />
The Federal and State Governments have agreed that Government<br />
funds will be provided to meet the cost of materials Used by<br />
landholders in replacing their boundary fences abuttin. g roads<br />
and railway lines.<br />
Mr., Fraser and Mr. Thompson said that this decision had been<br />
made in order to hasten the restoration of fencing aloing roads<br />
and railways which was burnt out in the recent fires. This<br />
fencing must be replaced as soon as possible to allow restocking<br />
of properties to commence without endangering the<br />
saf~ ety of road and rail users and stock.<br />
Municipalities in the area will be asked to help in the<br />
administration of the scheme.<br />
Assistance up to a maximum of $ 850 per kilometre for naterials<br />
actually used in replacement fencing will be provided.<br />
Mr. Fraser and Mr. Thompson praised the people in the bush<br />
fire areas for the speedy and effective way they have gone<br />
about ' obtaining and distributing fodder and other essentials<br />
and commencing rehabilitation of their properties. They<br />
ex:? ressed the hope that the Governments' action in regard<br />
to boundary fencing would assist in this process.<br />
Ministers pointed out that this assistance goes beyond the<br />
normal assistance arrangements which apply in cases of natural<br />
disasters. The assistance is made available as a special<br />
measure in this case in recognition of the extent and<br />
magnitude of the recent bush fires."<br />
