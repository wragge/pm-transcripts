PRIME MINISTER<br />
EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY<br />
REMARKS BY THE PRIME MINISTER AT THE OPENING OF<br />
MEETING BETWEEN REPRESENTATIVES OF THE ACTU, BCA AND CAI<br />
ON WORK AND MANAGEMENT PRACTICES<br />
MELBOURNE 24 SEPTEMBER 1986<br />
As you know Ihave been drawing attention for some time now<br />
to the need for management and labour to work together more<br />
effectively and more efficiently.<br />
This is because Australia's international competitiveness<br />
and thus our ability to create wealth and jobs ultimately<br />
depends on how productively we use our natural resources and<br />
capital eqjuipment.<br />
This has always been the case. But pursuit of greater<br />
productivity has become even more urgent over the past year<br />
or two.<br />
The 15 per cent decline in our terms of trade since the end<br />
of 1984 is now costing Australia about $ 6 billion a year in<br />
lost income.<br />
It has also highlighted, once again, the vulnerability of<br />
Australia's living standards to fluctuations in commodity<br />
prices and the importance of seeking to reduce this<br />
vulnerability by expanding efficient export-oriented<br />
enterprises in the manufacturing and services sectors.<br />
The substantial real depreciation of the $ A has given<br />
Australian industry a massive competitive advantage and, of<br />
itself, has prov'ided a new impetus to necessary structural<br />
reform within the Australian economy.<br />
But it will take sustained restraint in nominal wages growth<br />
and significant improvements in the productivity of our<br />
trade-exposed industries if that enhanced competitiveness is<br />
to be preserved : clearly the higher we can lift our<br />
productiveness in the years ahead compared with our<br />
competitors the less of a burden has to be borne by<br />
adjustments to wages growth and living standards over the<br />
intervening period. </p>
<p>A large number of factors impinge upon our productiveness.<br />
These include, as you know, levels of capital investment and<br />
skills formation and the efficiency with which we use our<br />
existing capital stock. Each of these has been the focus of<br />
Government policy development.<br />
It is widely recognised that the thrust of general economic<br />
policy is to support longer term adjustment in the balance<br />
of payments, including by creating the conditions which will<br />
permit, in time, a lessening of the role now required of<br />
monetary policy.<br />
Less well recognised is the major steps which have been<br />
taken: To encourage innovatiort and industrial research and<br />
development; To reformlour education and training systems;<br />
To restructure certain key industries, including by way<br />
of sector-specific plans;<br />
To reform the tax system;<br />
To facilitate increased exports; and<br />
To develop a more outward-oriented economic structure.<br />
We will continue, in the months and years ahead, to put the<br />
necessary policies in place on a broad front : general<br />
policies in respect of the Budget, interest rates, ongoing<br />
restraint in incomes claims etc and more specific policies<br />
addressin~ g more directly the efficiency of industry.<br />
These policy initiatives, combined with modest wage<br />
outcomes, are in themselves crucial. But they are all the<br />
more potent in the context of the substantial real<br />
depreciation of our currency which has occurred since the<br />
end of 1984.<br />
No single element of this mosaic would have been sufficient<br />
on its own. The effects on our trading performance build<br />
cumulatively and reinforce each other. They take time to<br />
have their full impact.<br />
The purpose of this meeting today is to address yet another<br />
element of the mosaic which will determine our living<br />
standards and job prospects in the longer term.<br />
To preserve for the future the beneficial effects of the<br />
depreciation we, as a community, need to look carefully now<br />
at the way in which work is organised and managed so as to<br />
remove barriers to making the best use of our resources. </p>
<p>And it is possible to do that. today in the knowledge that<br />
the community as a whole and the workforce in particular<br />
is ready to contemplate and participate in the necessary<br />
processes of change.<br />
From my private discussions with representatives of each of<br />
the groups here today I know it is common ground that a wide<br />
range of work and management practices have developed in<br />
less demanding times which are no longer affordable and<br />
which cannot be justified on grounds of efticiency or<br />
safety. Many of these practices are industry or plant specific.<br />
They can involve, for example, artificial restrictions on<br />
the use of skills and training, artificial restrictions on<br />
the use of productive time, excessively bureaucratised<br />
management structures inse-nsitive personnel practices or<br />
manning levels inappropriateeto modern conditions and<br />
technologjy.<br />
Their range and diversity suggest that it would not be a<br />
constructive use of time, on an occasion such as this, to<br />
seek to codify or catalogue all of the possibilities.<br />
Moreover the significance of any given arrangements will<br />
vary as between plants.<br />
And on that aspect it also seems common ground that this<br />
meeting, being a meeting of peak councils, cannot resolve<br />
issues which in their nature require detailed knowledge of<br />
particular industries, enterprises or plants.<br />
Rather the objective today is to discuss how best to<br />
encourage in practice the most productive dialogue between<br />
those able to effect change in ways, moreover, which can<br />
maintain the momentum for change and reform even as<br />
productive technologies and trading conditions continue to<br />
evolve over the years ahead.<br />
The community is looking for leadership from this group and<br />
firm evidence of commitment on both sides to the reforms<br />
which are widely recognised to be necessary.<br />
It needs to be recognised that all aspects need to be on the<br />
table for discussion between the relevant parties as I<br />
said last week when announcing this meeting, that means " all<br />
aspects of work and management practices within the overall<br />
context of seeking to achieve the optimum investment and<br />
productive strategy calculated to meet the economic<br />
challenge facing this country."<br />
I acknowledge that there are many examples of unions and<br />
management which have worked quickly and co-operatively over<br />
recent years to reform the way work is organised. </p>
<p>4.<br />
Five caz-companies, for example, are now using Just In Time<br />
methods of inventory control. This innovation has required<br />
significant flexibility from and the support of workers on<br />
the shop floor. And workers in the industry have also<br />
co-operated in a new approach to quality control which has<br />
required upgraded skills, greater responsibility and revised<br />
work procedures on the shop floor. Workplace reform is also<br />
a major element of the Steel Plan and of the recently<br />
announced Heavy Engineering package.<br />
These are examples in which Government initiatives at<br />
industry level have provided an important catalyst for<br />
change. There may be other cases in which established<br />
consultative forums at industry level could provide a<br />
further focus for worker and management initiated reviews.<br />
However significant improvements in procedures have also<br />
been initiated in the recentpast at plant level. To quote<br />
but three examnples:<br />
Larger companies in particular are increasingly<br />
implementing flatter management structures and the like;<br />
In the aluminium industry, which operates in an<br />
intensely competitive world market, some companies have<br />
achieved significant cost efficiencies by designing, in<br />
conjunction with workers, broader job structures,<br />
including through the introduction of so-called<br />
semi-autonomous work groups ( in some cases with<br />
improvements in pay under the C A Commission's work<br />
value principles); and<br />
In sugar refining there has been progress towards<br />
multi-skilling in some plants which has led to<br />
significant reductions in overall costs, more satisfying<br />
job profiles for workers and greater job security for<br />
the remaining workforce.<br />
In each case these developments have required a major change<br />
in attitudes, a new way of looking at what we do and the way<br />
we do it, and a willingness to consult and to adapt.<br />
Frequently, agreement to proceed to new arrangements was<br />
forced by a market crisis in other words the stark reality<br />
of the choice to become more productive or to become passe.<br />
But not all segments of Australian industry have been as<br />
keenly exposed to harsh world conditions. And, too often,<br />
progress has been slow.<br />
In our new straitened national economic circumstances the<br />
need now is for all industries especially but not<br />
exclusively those exposed to world trade to begin<br />
seriously to review workplace procedures and most<br />
importantly, to do so in a timely fashion. </p>
<p>It will be too late to act if we wait until an industry is<br />
in deep crisis. The time to improve our performance overall<br />
and to claim increased market share is now. As I ' have said<br />
on other occasions, our competitors every day produce<br />
quality products, on time and to budget and so must we.<br />
Indeed many of our foreign competitors have been improving<br />
their trade performance by improving their work performance<br />
for years and in many areas we have some catching up to<br />
do. In calling this meeting it has not been my intention to<br />
imply that work and management practices are the only or<br />
indeed the only remaining area of our economic performance<br />
in need of reform. That clearly is not the case.<br />
But while not the only step reform in workplace procedures<br />
is undoubteuly the major next step in the broad agenda for<br />
revitalising Australian industry which we initiated three<br />
years ago. And it is for this reason that I have suggested<br />
that most a ention be directed to this aspect today.<br />
Having convened this meeting the proper further role of<br />
Government in securing generalised workplace reform is of<br />
necessity limited. However the Government is ready to<br />
provide whatever useful assistance the meeting may later<br />
consider necessary.<br />
And, of course, the Commonwealth is prepared to address<br />
these matters, constructively, within the public sector.<br />
For example some progress has already been achieved in<br />
respect of the Australian National Line. I will be<br />
announcing significant reform of the Australian Public<br />
Service tomorrow, which will contribute to greater<br />
efficiency in the public sector. I have also asked<br />
responsible Ministers to take up these general matters with<br />
public enterprises within their portfolio.<br />
History has shown us clearly that change is most readily<br />
effected when those who will be affected by it have a clear<br />
appreciation of the necessity for reform, the steps to be<br />
taken and the longer term benefits to be achieved.<br />
I applaud the constructive and co-operative spirit i. Ln which<br />
the representatives of business and unions have approached<br />
this meeting today. Obviously we cannot hope to make<br />
long-lasting progress in this area except by processes based<br />
on goodwill., co-operat ion and consultation.<br />
This meeting today is a necessary first step in giving<br />
greater impetus and focus t~ o such processes. Your example<br />
here today and the degree of your commitment to facilitate<br />
co-operative change will piovide an important signal to the<br />
many others who have to come after you. Because, as I said<br />
last week, to succeed T-here must be others in unions, in<br />
firms, in industries prepared to take up the challenge and<br />
carry those processes forward. </p>
<p>6.<br />
I have no doubt that some energy, foresight and co-operative<br />
leadership today will greatly assist Australia onto the<br />
course of the highest possible rates of sustained growth.<br />
You all, of course, have a commitment and obligation to your<br />
immediate constituencies. Let us all remember that we all<br />
have an enduring obligation to future generations of<br />
Australians the obligation to pass on a country best<br />
equipped to meet the remorseless challenges of an<br />
increasingly competitive international environment.<br />
