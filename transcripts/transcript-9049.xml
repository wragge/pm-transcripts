TRANSCRIPT OF PRESS CONFERENCE WITH THE PRIME MINISTER THE<br />
HON.! PJ KEATING, M. P..<br />
FOUR SEASONS HOTEL, SEATFILE U. S. A.<br />
SATURDAY 20 NOVEMBER, 1993<br />
E OE PROOF COPY<br />
PM: Good afternoon. Today when the APEC leaders -met under the chairmanship of<br />
President Clinton I think one can say it was a completely historic occasion. For<br />
the first time having the leaders of the major Asia-Pacific economies meet and the<br />
significance of it was, I think, a tremendous thing for relations in the region. The<br />
atmospherics of the mecting were terrific. The chemistry, the relationship<br />
between each individual, thc. I think, diminished fears that some counres may<br />
have about the US and its motives and the whole, if you like, development of<br />
APEC to date. A lot of those things, I think, fell to the wayside and we had a very<br />
good and cooperative discussion. The thing about these couple of days is people<br />
do get to know each other better. We had adin= crlast night and by the time they<br />
got on board today they were all chatting around about nothing in particular, and<br />
everything in general, until they then got on to the more formal discussions and<br />
the more formal discussions today were, I thought, very productive. The<br />
contributions were very thoughtful and quite a lot, I think, was achieved.<br />
The first thing that was achieved was that evcrybody thought the meeting was a<br />
success, so much so that they have decided to have another one next year in<br />
Indonesia in 1994. As well, there was unanimity of opinion that now was the<br />
chance to do the, if you like, the triple. And that wus NAFTA, APEC and GAIT.<br />
And there was a determination on the part of everybody theme to try and press the<br />
Uruguay Round to a succcssful conclusion, and President Clinton walked away<br />
with thc support of everybody in thc doing of that<br />
There was also an understanding, I think. of the need for closer cooperation in<br />
APEC if emerging bottle necks to gruwth are to bc avoided. Leaders rccognised<br />
there are bottle necks to growth, that while these Asia-Pacific economnies have 13 3 03 </p>
<p>grown strongiy, they have mostiv gown from a smaii base. and they arm with the<br />
cneray demands. infrastructure demands. ana other issues. goin2 to run up against<br />
some orobiems over time. And it was gcneraily agreed that they needed to be<br />
avoided and work needed to be done to think about them.<br />
They weicomed the Eminent Persons Groun challenge to achieve freer trade in<br />
Asia and the Pacific. and the next oracticai steps agreed inciude: a meeting of<br />
Ã¸-conomic munisters. tinance ministers. on macroeconomic development; a<br />
-heeting on neiping smail and meoium business to understana what they believe<br />
APEC could deliver to them, and how APEC might hel; and an examination of<br />
the links between energy use and the environment, because of the enormous<br />
energy which is _ olng to be consumed in these economies over the next few<br />
y. ears.<br />
We agreed to set up a business forum, it hasn't got a name at the moment, but lets<br />
call it a round table for the purposes of giving it a name, with two representative<br />
of business from each country to identify ways of facilitating trade, and to give<br />
APFC a business perspective on how and in which ways governments might be<br />
able to help the genera] development of the policy settings to promote business in<br />
the region.<br />
Between now and the next meeting, the heads of government agreed that<br />
ministers and officials should work on common non-binding investment<br />
principles as a first step towards a regional investment agreement which I<br />
thought was a particularly useful thing to do. And generally there was also quite<br />
broad ranging discussion about the needs of the developing Asia-Pacific<br />
economies and also the needs of the larger industrial economics like the United<br />
States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand etc. their relatively slow growth over<br />
the last few years, and the attendant problems of quite high levels of<br />
unemployment. We had a very useful discussion around those things as well. It<br />
was agreed that the stronger motor economies, such as the Germany, Japan,<br />
helps the Asia-Pacific in the same way as the Asia-Pacific growth can help the<br />
motor economies.<br />
So it was. I thought, a first class discussion all morning and afternoon. Leader<br />
went away, I think, convinced that the step they have taken to meet was a step<br />
well taken, and that they should do the same again next year. I think that the<br />
impression everyone else had was that they all felt much easier with one another<br />
towards the end of it, they fell they could talk to each other easily about most any<br />
topic. Some of the countries represented don't have any forum to discuss<br />
economic policy. This is particularly true of China and Japan, and China and<br />
Korea, or indeed the US and China. Even though Japan and the U. S. meet in the<br />
Gi7. Korea doesn't, nor does Indonesia or the ASFAN States. as well as Australia.<br />
So it was a particul-rly good meeting, and I think everyone who attended it was<br />
buoyed by it. and we all look forward to it occurring next year in 1994. </p>
<p>It was proposed by President Kim Young San that we meet a second time in<br />
19.94. This was generally agreed and President Soeharto said he was honoured to<br />
issue an invitation for a leaders meeting concurrent with the APEC ministerial<br />
meertings which will be held during 1994.<br />
So I would be happy to talk questions from you.<br />
1: Mr Ke~ ating you said one of thc things you wanted to achievc out of this was to<br />
give more poiitical authority to thc APEC process. Do you believe that todays<br />
mecting has actually advanccd the cause of APEC beyond what was achieved in<br />
the ministerial meeting?<br />
PM Yes I do. think that the leaders meeting had its own separate dynamic, as I<br />
thought it would, and the leaders were prepared to push the agenda a bit further,<br />
not only endorsing the things undertaken by ministers at the ministerial meeting,<br />
but to advance a little further in some of those areas that I mentioned.<br />
j. Mr Prime Minister when you say that the leaders welcomed thc EPG challenge to<br />
cut tariffs in the Asia-Pacific. does this mean that you think that the target date of<br />
1996 is still achievable in terms of starting to dismantle tariffs?<br />
PM: I wouldn't have particularly endorsed that, no. But I think that the leaders thought<br />
that the EPO report was a challenge to be met. that free and fuller trade in the<br />
area was something that ought to be done and could be donc. Though we didn't<br />
go through thc EPG report ticking this and crossing that. Except to pick up those,<br />
that is endorsement of the ministerial work, and to go on to do those other things.<br />
That is, work on common non-binding investment rules that might lead to a<br />
formal investment agrement. and the meeting of economic ministers' to consider<br />
the development of maciocvonomic policy instruments, in some countries and the<br />
development of economic policy.<br />
And also the question of helping small and medium business examine their links<br />
with energy usc and the envir'onment. These things, I think, were all vcry useful<br />
things. In other words, the leaders have had a meeting, it's endorsed the vision<br />
statement which you have, it's gone on to say this has been so successful we ought<br />
to have another one next year in the interim we will do these things as well as<br />
pick up the work of the ministerial meeting.<br />
J: Prime Minister was therm any discussion of Malaysia's absence and did anybody<br />
volunteer to try to bring them on board?<br />
IPM: There was no discussion. Only a question of which I think~ President Clinton<br />
fielded at the midday press conferenic. 330.5 </p>
<p>J: Mr Keating, yesterday when Mr Clinton was talking about APEC, he, in a<br />
likened it to setting up of bodies like NATO and the IMF. Do you see APEC in<br />
( inaudible) grand kind of scale and can you talk about what you sec as the full<br />
potential of APEC.<br />
PM: I think that APEC is a tremendously important vehicle for regional economic<br />
cooperation and trade facilitation. It is not portending a formal, nationally agreed,<br />
parliamentary endorsed, or public cndorsed, set of proposals as say the Maastuicht<br />
Treaty or the Treaty of Rome or a supra-national bureaucracy like the Brssels<br />
bureaucracy who make decisions for other national governments. Not that. But<br />
certainly a cooperative structure which can do many of the same things, but in a<br />
cooperative way. The mere fact that these people are sitting down, the US with<br />
China, and China with Japan, and Korea with China, and Korea with Japan and<br />
Indonesia with everyone else and all the ASEANs, Australia as well. Just of itself<br />
produces a familiarity and some trust. Because everyone agreed that the personal<br />
relations are so important, and I think they are.<br />
Now, while countries will still always have interests, and often they won't<br />
compromise their interests, but they will have interests, but I think the personal<br />
relations are terribly important. And that has been shown over and over again in<br />
foreign relations, and it's just as true here. So, I do think this is a very historic<br />
body and I don't think that the President's words about it are sort of, basically<br />
superfluous hyperbole. I think it does truly reflect the historic nature of the<br />
gathering.<br />
J: Mr Keating. yesterday when Mr Clinton was talking about APEC, he, in a speech,<br />

PM: I think that APEC is a tremendously important vehicle for regional economic<br />
cooperation and trade facilitation. It is not portending a formal, nationally agreed,<br />
parliamentary endored, or public endorsed, set of proposals as say the Maastrieht<br />
Treaty or the Treaty of Rome or a supra-national bureaucracy like the Brussels<br />

330 </p>
<p>Now while countries will still always have interests and often they won't<br />
compromise their interests but they will have interests but 1 think the personal<br />
relations are terrbly important. Now that has been shown over and over again in<br />
foreign relations, and it is just as true here. So, I do think this is a very historic<br />
body and I don't think that the President's words about it arc basically a<br />
superfluous hyperbole. I think it does truly reflect the historic nature of the<br />
gathering.<br />
I: Prime Minister, at lunchtime President Clinton seemed to indicate that, come June<br />
next year, that he would have better news for Americans about the Japan-<br />
Amenican trading relationship. Will you havc similar better news for Australians<br />
in terms of access for our rice and better access for our beef and other<br />
commodities?<br />
PM: Well, I don't know if that is exactly the kind of news the President wishes to<br />
convey except that I think that he is developing a very good relationship with<br />
Prime Minister Hosokawa. The interest of both of them in this agcnda today and<br />
their contributions on the way through mean that you reay have got a meeting of<br />
minds on these things. Now, countries have interests but, again. they do realise<br />
there is a lot of common interests there. It may be that there is a view that the G7<br />
is not producing the goods. That was not said by them today but that perhaps is a<br />
view that I have and maybe a view they have too.<br />
J: PrimneMinister inaudible.. talked about finance ministers' meeting and also<br />
consulting on macroeconomic developments. Do you envisage there will be a<br />
greater coordination of economic policies between the APEC countries which atc<br />
keen to do perhaps some... inaudible..?<br />
PM: No, I don't think so. While macroeconomic discussions can be important and they<br />
can influence policies J don't know that formal policy coordination, so to speak.<br />
is really on the agenda for them. But in many countries of the APEC area they do<br />
lack monetary and fiscal instruments and so therm is a lot to be said for finance<br />
ministers talking about these subjects. Not just to convey their own experiences<br />
or even the assist in setting up some of these macroeconomic instruments or<br />
advise upon them just to discuss where the economies are going. To discuss<br />
with national ministers their views of their economies and their potential is. I<br />
think, very important because while a lot of people believe this stuff can be picked<br />
up in this central bank bulletin or that central bank bulletin is never like hearing it<br />
from the horses mouth. T7hat is, to actually have the person running these<br />
economics participate in such a gathering. So, I think, that can be very useful.<br />
J: Undcr the umbrella of this APEC meeting we have seen significant bilateral<br />
meetings between the Chinese and the Americans and also the opening up of<br />
relations again between New Zealand and the United States. Is this a proper role<br />
for an organisation of tis kind and can I also bear your specific comments on the 3307 </p>
<p>kind o. that seenm to be moving between the New Zealanders and the<br />
Americans?<br />
PM:-Well. I think that one of the good spin-offs of APEC is you can have a series of<br />
bilateral meetings. I met four or five leaders bilaterally as you know and I found<br />
those meetings to be very usefual. No doubt so did othcr leaders. It does give you<br />
an opportunity to discuss whatever subjects are of interest at the time even if they<br />
are not purely trade subjects. So. it is a very good opportunity to have a meeting<br />
and to be able to range over those things in the context of the broader common<br />
objectives of greater growth and higher tradcs and better incomes and better<br />
employment. You mentioned New Zealand. There is no doubt that Prime Minister Bolger's<br />
engagement heme and his discussions with the President obviously helps that<br />
relationship where formally New Zealand officials were not having discusion at<br />
Secretary level in the United States. There arc still difficulties in the New.<br />
Zealand relationship obviously, with their anti-nuclear policy and that would<br />
remain a policy difficulty but in terms of the relationship obviously a meeting like<br />
this improves it.<br />
3 Prime Minister, would you give us a flavour of how the meetings were conducted.<br />
Did everyone speak in turn Or was there give and take and I am particularly<br />
interested in what the contribution of President Jiang was and was there any<br />
interchange with the Taiwan minister?<br />
PM: We were seated virtually in an arc. There were consecutive translations so leaders<br />
spoke when they wished. They gave an indication to the President and he would<br />
call them in turn and they had their say. Some started off scripted reading a little<br />
text. As the meeting went on, all the participants were really speaking<br />
extemporaneously. Some, of course, spoke extemporaneously right from the start.<br />
As the meeting went on it had a mome free wheeling quality to it. I thought that<br />
was very good. So, there were people coming in for maybe 30 seconds or a<br />
minute then someone else would come back in and then some onc would speak<br />
for three minutes and some one would then go on and reply to some of that for<br />
two. It had a generally discursive quality to it. I thought there was trcmcndous<br />
goodwill there. A great interest to comprehend quite technical things.<br />
J: Like what?<br />
PM: Talking about macroeconomic policy. The impacts upon -employment. The<br />
whole question about the opcrations about monetary policy, whether it should<br />
comprehend employment as well as price stability. The impacts of productivity<br />
on employment. It is unlikely that such a discussion might have been held<br />
years ago, for instance. </p>
<p>J: Mr Keating, Australia played a very big role in getting APEC off the ground and<br />
you of course, played a big role in getting the Lzadcrs' meeting going. What do<br />
you think is Australias role in APEC from here on?<br />
PM: Australia has enjoyed the role it has had. That is, in shaping with other countries<br />
seeking to give APEC a form and substance from the germ of an idea and see it<br />
change over time. I would like to particularly pay tribute to the work of the<br />
Foreign Minister in this Gareth Evans, and more latterly. Peter Cook, as Minister<br />
for Tradc, who have certainly taken this issue up as something which can play a<br />
defning role in an Asia-Pacific economy. Our colleague ministers and leaders<br />
appreciate the role that Australia has played. We try and play a cooperative role<br />
with other countries. Moving the agenda along but moving it along where people<br />
feel comfortable for it to move.<br />
J Did Australia oppose initially the entrance of Chile into APEC. If so, why? Will<br />
the entrance of Chile into APEC in 1994 mean ha the President of Chile will be<br />
at Jakarta?<br />
PM: The answer to the last part of the question would be yes. We said that we would<br />
not stand out againt any conscsus on Chile. APEC has started basically as<br />
North and South Asia and the NAFTA arma It is defined by its trade in many<br />
respects and I think, with any orgmnisation like this, which has some definition it<br />
is important to deepe it before it is broadened. We can certainly accommodate<br />
Chile but we would want to be able to move to some fairly firm criteria over time<br />
which defines APEC and it is not an organisation which virtually anyone can join.<br />
I think with an organisation that has got value, being stingy with membership is a<br />
good policy. Not to be difficult, but to give the thing the respect it deserves and to<br />
let people in if their interests are harmonious with the interests of the body<br />
concerned.<br />
J: Prime Minister you have spoken a lot about * the need to improve harmony of<br />
standards inaudible. As a result of this meeting, in your view, is the Trade and<br />
Investment Committee actually empowered to conduct substantive negotiations<br />
towards harmonising product and investment standards, and if so, have you got<br />
any... inaudible.<br />
PM: Ministers will come back with work on hanmonised standards, customs<br />
procedures, competition policy and legal and regulatory frameworks. Those sorts<br />
of issues between now and the next meeting of the ministerial meeting and the<br />
leaders meeting to see whether and in which ways wc can advance those.<br />
1: Did you speA-anymore to Mr Clinton about a possible visit to Australia? 3309 </p>
<p>PM: I said to him ofecourse, I invited him down and he said that he would like to covie<br />
to Australia. Obviously an opporfune time would be whten he comes to Indonesia<br />
in 1994 and we will try organise an itinerary now, though I don't know whether<br />
we can at the time. Presidents ame pretty busy people and vrying to organize an<br />
APEC leaders meeting plus some other country visits will be difficult to schedule<br />
into anyone's schedule let alone President Clinton. He has indicated a willingnes<br />
to come and said he would like to see Australia and of course, we would<br />
absolutely be delighted to have him.<br />
J Can you give us a readout of the discussion at the meeting of the micerence to a<br />
ree trade and the region in Asia. In particular between two models of a<br />
preferential region versus an MEFN type free trade. Could you also tell us what<br />
Australia's position is on that issue? And finally if! I can. what is Australia's<br />
position on the US-China debate on human rights?<br />
PM: Let me deal with the first one. We seethis as basically apolicy of open<br />
regionalism as we have always said. That is. if we can lower the impediments and<br />
enhance the prospects for growth so that we can all participate particularly against<br />
the backdrop of a successful outcome to the Uruguay Round, obviously trade<br />
investment and incomes and with it employment, will be higher in the area than it<br />
would otherwise be. We don't e it as being an exclusive area. We have made<br />
that clear right from the stan. Fears that the body is going to be an exclusive one<br />
or a trade bloc ame unfounded. T1here ame many things that can be done here. This<br />
area has grown quite fast already without any agreement or any structures of the<br />
APEC variety. Our fear is that we will run into problems and impediments so that<br />
that growth won't be able to continue at the pace that it has and that is where<br />
probably now there is a place and a role for an organisation like APEC to do that.<br />
On the human rights question, I think the US position is pretty much the same as<br />
Austraia's. That is that one of the defining things of preat democracies is respec<br />
for human values and human decency expressed in the term human rights and<br />
Australia has been completely clear about its attachment to those values and its<br />
role in the Pacific, if you like championing and heralding those values. As with<br />
the United States, they obviously see the China relationship in the broad,<br />
comprehending this human rights question as in fact we do ourselves, by virtue of<br />
the fact that we have resitabilised relations with China after Tienammen square in<br />
1989. The same is true in respect of Indonesia.<br />
1: Do you support the U. S. threat to impose trade sanctions against China..<br />
inaudible..?<br />
PM: Well, that is a Congressional threat and whether that materialises into the policy<br />
of the administration, timc will tcll. The thing is, the United States has made<br />
fairly clear its objections about human rights, but. I mean. we have ourselves. The<br />
Tianazunen Square issue in Australia was a matter of great heart burning and all of<br />
the ramifications of it were transmitted not just around the world, but to China in<br />
particular.<br />
-3: 3 1 </p>
<p>J: Was human rights discussed in the meeting with China?<br />
PM: No, no.<br />
J1: Is there any possibility of including Russia into APEC since part of Russia is in<br />
Asia?<br />
PM: Well, again. there has to be a naturalness about APEC. They have to be<br />
economies which have a preponderance of their exports in the area and where they<br />
are rcaily involved in the commerce of the region. So, theme is going to be no easy<br />
policy for joining. When decisions arc made about membership here they are<br />
going to be very deliberate ones.<br />
1: Do you stil believe that NAFTA will become a sub-group of APEC and did you<br />
raise this with President Clinton?<br />
PM: No, but obviously the United States is now trading into Asia and U. S. exports to<br />
Asia am growing at three times the pace of Asian exports into the United States.<br />
This is also true for Canada and it would be also true for Mexico. So, whether<br />
they art actually trading as a trade entity is immxaterial. They'll still trade into the<br />
Asia-Paeilic. APEC is far more integrated than NAFTA is. That is, trade within<br />
the APEC area is already running at about 66%. NAFTA has an integration of<br />
about So, the bigger shooting match is obviously going to be Asia-Pacific<br />
trade. And I have no doubt that the United States will adapt to that trade whether<br />
it has the cloak of NAFTA on or off.<br />
J: Mr Keating, the Leades Statement taks about APEC being a new voice for the<br />
Asia-Pacific in world afars. How often will we hear that voice, and in what<br />
circumstance? And do you see an APEC voice being exercised more than once a<br />
year at an event like this?<br />
PM: I think, it's now meeting annually at ministerial level. It will obviously meet for<br />
two consecutive years at leaders level and may go on to meet regularly. I think it<br />
probably will go on to meet regularly beyond that. And that's a, for the economic<br />
development and history of a region like that, that's quite frequent. I mean, what<br />
is historic about this body is that there is no forum for these very large countries<br />
to talk to one another. And, particularly for China and Japan and China and<br />
Korea or for Indonesia and the United States. It provides not just a body which<br />
can facilitate enhanced trade and investmnt but one which can obviously, by<br />
virtue of its existence and the personalities, lower suspicions, do something<br />
material to ease tensions and provide better understanding between nations of<br />
their respective diffcrences and interests. Now, I think, in that respect it's a very<br />
clear benefit.<br />
J1: Prime Minister, in the Australia-China bilateral was human rights discussed at all? ~ 3311 </p>
<p>TEL: 3. Dec. 93 11: 01 No. 015 P. 02<br />
PM: No. I went mainly to APEC topics. I visited China this year and made clear there<br />
our position on human rights to Premier Li Peng, where I particularly emphasised<br />
Tibet and the continuing problems of that country and China's management and<br />
stewardship of it. This bilateral was largely about APEC, about the structure and<br />
some bilateral issues such as the things we are doing cooperatively with China on<br />
wool and other things we are doing on the trade side.<br />
J: Mr Clinton, after the meeting, spoke again of the idea of the APEC community as<br />
opposed to a cooperation forum.-Was there any discussionl on the change of the<br />
name today?<br />
PM: No. I think the President's use of the term community reflected, I think, the<br />
generally eased concerns about the notion of that implying the sort of Brusselsstyle<br />
bureaucraey. And therm wasn't any demur from him using that term so, he<br />
did talk about a Pacific community earlier this year and he spoke about a<br />
community at the press conference today. The mere fact that APEC's trade is as<br />
integrated as it is gives-jtan economic community status but it is a small Vc<br />
commnunity not big dieaning a Treaty of Rome or a nationally endorsed<br />
Maastricht Treaty orusupra-niational bureaucracy of the Brussels variety.<br />
And I think that, that understood, there was no real concern amongst APEC<br />
leaders about the term or the meaning of the term. In general, I think I would<br />
have to say to you that APEC has developed quite fast, with a lot of definition, a<br />
lot of form, a fair bit of trust and a lot of ambition. It's come a long way in a short<br />
time, as it needs to do, to accommodate the growth problems of the Asia-Pacific<br />
area. And I pay tribute to everybody who has been involved with it, those other<br />
countries which have tried to find a new model to work in in the Asia-Pacific and<br />
I think we made quite tremendously important steps over these couple of days in<br />
giving APEC so much more authority at leaders level than it could have otherwise<br />
had.<br />
J: Now that you've had the Leaders' meeting do you feel more confident about the<br />
future of APEC and being able to build regional cooperation or is the magnitude<br />
of the task, the differences and the problems, become more apparent?<br />
PM: Oh no, I think I feel far more confident about it, I think there's a tremendous<br />
atmosphere of cooperation about it. And the fact that we could conceive such a<br />
structure and see it take the form it has with the quite disparate countries involved,<br />
with all their very clear interests and differences, is quite a special thing to have<br />
happened.<br />
Ends. </p>
<p>APEC Leaders Economic Vision Statement<br />
We have held an unprecedented meeting of the economic<br />
leaders of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum. In this<br />
post Cold War era, we have an opportunity to build a new economic<br />
foundation for the Asia Pacific that harnesses the energy of our<br />
diverse economies, strengthens cooperation and promotes<br />
prosperity. Our meting reflects the emergence of a new voice for the<br />
Asia Pacific in world affairs. As we prepare to enter the<br />
twenty-first century, we believe our dynamic region, representing<br />
forty percent of the world's population and fifty percent of its<br />
CNP, will play an important role in the global economy, leading<br />
the way on economic growth and trade expansion.<br />
The foundation of our economic growth has been the open<br />
multilateral trading system. Therefore, we pledge our utmost<br />
efforts to bring the Uruguay Round to a successful conclusion by<br />
Decembcr 15. We are determined the Asia Pacific region will lead<br />
the way f. n taking concrete steps to produce the strongest<br />
possible outcome in Geneva. Increased participation by APEC<br />
economies in a strengthened GA77 system also will facilitate<br />
greater regional cooperation.<br />
Our success has been the result of the ability of our<br />
societies to adapt to changing circumstances. Our economies are<br />
moving toward interdependence and there is a growing sense of<br />
community among us. We are united in our commitment to create a<br />

rates, provide the skills for maintaining economic growth<br />
and encourage the sharing of ideas that contribute to the<br />
arts and science;<br />
o Advances in telecommunications and transportation shrink<br />
time and distance barriers in our region and link our<br />
economies so that goods and people move quickly and<br />
efficiently;<br />
o Our environment is improved as we protect the quality of our<br />
air, water and green spaces and manage our energy sources<br />
and renewable resources to ensure sustainable growth and<br />
provide a more secure future for our people.<br />
we recognize this vision will become a reality only if we<br />
work together actively to secure it. We are convinced we can<br />
succeed. We intend to use our shared vision as a guide for<br />
developing the future of our region.<br />
We reaffirm our support for the continued devto, ent of<br />
APRC as a forum dedicated to producing tangible economic benefits<br />
to the region. We urge APEC to expand its economic dialogue and<br />
advance its specific work projects. The entrepreneurial spirit<br />
and markt-oriented policies that have driven our economic<br />
dynamism will continue to be fostered within APEC.<br />
We welcome the challenge presented to us in the report of<br />
the APEC Eminent Persons Group to achieve free trade in the Asia<br />
Pacific, advance global trade liberalization and launch concrete<br />
programs to move us toward those long-term goals. We ask APEC to<br />
undertake work aimed at deepening and broadening the outcome of<br />
the Uruguay Round, strengthening trade and investment<br />
liberalization in the region, and facilitating regional<br />
cooperation, including in such areas as standards.<br />
We agree to convene a meeting of APEC Finance Ministers to<br />
consult on broad economic issues including macroeconomic<br />
developments and capital flows. We believe such discussions will<br />
help us address some of the challenges facing the region,<br />
including ensuring non-inflationary regional growth, financing<br />
investment and infrastructure development, and promoting capital<br />
market development.<br />
We ask business leaders to establish a Pacific Business<br />
Forum to identify issues APEC should address to facilitate<br />
regional trade and investment and encourage the further<br />
development of business networks throughout the region. We also<br />
ask APEC to strengthen its policy dialogue on small and medium<br />
size business enterprises.<br />

Remarks by President Clinton At Apec Meeting Blake Island Puget Sound<br />
Washington Saturday<br />
REMARKS BY PRESIDENT CLINTON AT APEC MEETING<br />
BLAKE ISLAND, PUGET SOUND, WASHINGTON<br />
SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 20, 1993<br />
PRESIDENT CLINTON: Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, as we<br />
ipproach the end of a week of APEC activities, we've just completed<br />
-hree hours of meetings among 14 APEC economic leaders. It's been a<br />
) leasure for me and an honor for the United States to host this week's<br />
events and to convene this historic meeting on this beautiful island.<br />
The Asian-Pacific region will play an increasingly vital role for<br />
nation and the world. The region is home to 40 percent of the<br />
. ld's people, includes the world's fastest growing economies. And<br />
: he leaders standing here represent half the world' s economic output.<br />
This week's events have been a success for all the region's<br />
? eople. we've laid a foundation for regional efforts to create jobs,<br />
raise incomes, expand business opportunities, and foster regional<br />
aarmony. This week we took several tangible steps towards these<br />
goals. On Monday and Tuesday, over 1,500 business people engaged in<br />
: rade came together to focus on the region's potential to benefit<br />
: heir bottom lines. Later in the week, our ministers agreed to a<br />
? ackage of market opening measures designed to help bring the Uruguay<br />
-round of the GATT to a successful conclusion by December 15th. And<br />
: he ministerial meeting agreed to develop an action plan in the near<br />
future to reduce barriers to business throughout our region, such as<br />
differing product standards.<br />
The capstone of this week's activities has been this first-ever<br />
-aders meeting. Our discussions this morning, which will continue in<br />
the afternoon, give us a chance to become better acquainted, and to<br />
compare our visions for our own nations and for our diverse and<br />
dynamic region. By meeting and talking, we've been able to forge a<br />
stronger regional identity and a stronger purpose. That purpose is<br />
captured in the vision statement we just released.<br />
The statement sets forth our shared view of a regional economy<br />
characterized by openness, cooperation, dynamic growth, expanded<br />
trade, improved transportation and communications and high-skilled,<br />
high-paying jobs. We've welcomed the challenge of the eminent persons<br />
group to achieve free trade in the Asian-Pacific region, advance<br />
global trade liberalization, and launch concrete specific programs to<br />
move us toward these long-term goals.<br />
In our discussions last evening and today, I've been struck by<br />
how many priorities we share; strong sustainable economic growth, more<br />
open markets, better jobs, working conditions and living standards for<br />
our own people, better education for our children and our adults, and<br />
protection of the region's unique environment. 3: 02pm Page 1 </p>
<p>November 20, 1993302mPg2<br />
of course, we will not always agree on how to achieve those<br />
joals. But at least now, for the first time, our region has a means<br />
: o hold serious policy discussions on such questions as how to remove<br />
: rade barriers, or how to sustain robust growth.<br />
If you asked me to summarize in a sentence what we've agreed, it<br />
_ s this; we've agreed that the Asian-Pacific region should be a united<br />
) ne, not divided. We've agreed that our economic policies should be<br />
) pen, not closed. We've agreed that we should begin to express that<br />
: onviction by doing everything we possibly can to get a good GATT<br />
igreement by December the<br />
With today's meeting, we're helping the Asian-Pacific to become a<br />
jenuine community, not a formal legal structure, but rather a<br />
: ommunity of shared interests, shared goals and shared commitment to<br />
i-tually beneficial cooperation. The development of that community is<br />
tainly in the interests of the American people and all the people<br />
) t this region. We should be pleased with the progress we've made.<br />
\ nd let me say again how honored I am, on behalf of the United States,<br />
: o have had the opportunity to host all these leaders. Thank you,<br />
. rery much. Yes? Q Mr. President, there was no sign of any flexibility by<br />
T-hina in the areas dispute that you have or with Japan on trade<br />
: mbalances. Can you say, were any minds or attitudes changed during<br />
: he course of this meeting?<br />
PRESIDENT CLINTON: Well, you're referring to meetings that I had<br />
iesterday and discussions we had today. I'm the host of a meeting<br />
. here we discussed economic issues. And I frankly believe by I'll<br />
nake you a prediction on the economic issues by next June or July<br />
-certainly by a year from now, I believe that the responsibilities<br />
the United States and Japan to do more to promote global economic<br />
_) wth will have been, in large measure, advanced. And I think you<br />
vill see that we've done some of the things that we should, both of<br />
Is. So, today we focused on what we could do together economically.<br />
% nd I think that's what I ought to respond to today.<br />
Yes, ma'am.<br />
Q Mr. President, the fact that this time you invited both<br />
representatives from Taiwan and China to join you to discuss about the<br />
vision of Asian-Pacific area, I wonder, how do you find your<br />
respective vision for this area? And, in your opinion, how does this<br />
feeting affect the relationship between Taiwan and China?<br />
PRESIDENT CLINTON: Well, that's something for them to determine.<br />
I invited, as the host, all the members of this organization which<br />
was the appropriate thing to do. Actually, I'm struck by how much<br />
common investment and common activity there is now, and by the common<br />
3: 02pm Page 2 </p>
<p>November 20, 19933: 2mPg3<br />
rategies of high savings and investment, hard work, and<br />
. trepreneurialism that are sweeping that part of the world. It is<br />
. mensely impressive, I think, to anyone who has observed it.<br />
Yes, go ahead either one. Flip a coin.<br />
Q I'll go after you.<br />
Q Mr. President, what do you think about Malaysia's absence<br />
of Dr. Mahathir's absence from this meeting? And what do you think<br />
) out EAEC the East Asia Economic Conference?<br />
PRESIDENT CLINTON: Well, I'm not against first of all, I'm in<br />
: vor of anything which increases regional economic cooperation and<br />
Ivances the economic interests of people, as long as it doesn't close<br />
ff economic opportunities for other. And I wish Mr. Mahathir were<br />
and I look forward to meeting him someday.<br />
Yes? Q Mr. President, how serious is the situation in North Korea<br />
3 a threat to this whole region, and is that something that you<br />
Lscussed today at the meeting?<br />
PRESIDENT CLINTON: We didn't discuss it today, but it was<br />
. scussed yesterday. And I look forward to meeting with President Kim<br />
i Washington. He's going back to Washington, and we'll be meeting<br />
iere and talking about it. It is a source of concern to us, but one<br />
iat we believe we can find solutions to and we're going to be<br />
iking some initiatives in that area in the not to distant future.<br />
Yes, ma'am?<br />
PRESIDENT CLINTON: Mr. President, is New Zealand now<br />
iguratively out of the cold, if not literally? Have you now restored<br />
political relationship with New Zealand?<br />
PRESIDENT CLINTON: Actually, we're out in the cold today.<br />
1jaughter.) The Prime Minister and I had a good talk about that, and<br />
a agreed that we would at least take a good look at our relationship<br />
rid to see what else might be done. We have an awful lot in common<br />
rid a lot of natural instincts toward friendship and cooperation. And<br />
think both of us are uncomfortable with what has become of our<br />
alationship over the last several years. So, we'll take another look<br />
t it and we may have something to say about it, but not today and not<br />
omorrow. Yes, ma'am, in the back there.<br />
Q Mr. President, when you're talking about NAFTA, you<br />
entioned several times Taiwan, Japan, and China are the three major<br />
bstacles when you're dealing with U. S. trade deficit. A lot of<br />
eople think that was not very helpful when you're trying to cooperate<br />
ith Asian countries. I was wondering, after this meeting<br />
PRESIDENT CLINTON: Wait, wait, wait, wait. You can ask the<br />
3: 02pm Page 3 </p>
<p>November 20, 199330pmPg4<br />
ruestion, but let me restate what I said. What I said to the American<br />
Deople was simply the fact that the people who were against NAFTA<br />
3cted as if Mexico essentially was going to displace the entire<br />
. ndustrial production of the United States, or significant portions of<br />
And I pointed out the fact that we have a trade surplus with<br />
lexico and that our largest operating trade deficits are with Japan.<br />
' hina, and Taiwan. That's simply a fact. That's not an act of<br />
iostility, it's just a stated fact. So, go ahead, ask the question.<br />
Q Yes, the question is, after this meeting, will you think<br />
: hat in the future, the United States is willing to use cooperation<br />
. nstead of Articles 301 type of trade retaliations threat to deal with<br />
: his problem? PRESIDENT CLINTON: Well, I think, first of all, we've used<br />
\ rticle 301 rather sparingly. And secondly, we do seek cooperation.<br />
' hat's the whole purpose of this meeting. That's one of the reasons<br />
it I wanted all the leaders to come here, because I think that we<br />
iave so much in common in terms of our shared views about what the<br />
2conomy of the 21st century ought to look like and what our roles<br />
Dught to be that I think we can do a lot through cooperate. And we're<br />
working very hard to do that. In the end, if we're going to develop<br />
: he right kind of free market system, it is going to have to be a<br />
:: ooperative one, but it's going to have to be one that is plainly in<br />
: he interests of all the people involved in the system. That is,<br />
averyone has to be going forward together.<br />
MS. Last question.<br />
PRESIDENT CLINTON: Yes?<br />
Q Mr. President, how hard and fast is the December<br />
ieadline for successful completion of the GATT Round? It's been slid<br />
slipped a couple of times previously. Would you be prepared to<br />
2xtend it, if you don't have agreement by then?<br />
PRESIDENT CLINTON: Well, it's not entirely up to me, is it?<br />
nd then and, of course, we have certain legislative authority in<br />
merica, as you know, that controls that. All I can tell you is that<br />
I think we want to take this moment of opportunity that, frankly,<br />
: he House of Representatives and I hope today that the Senate will<br />
give impetus to through NAFTA and that we are trying to give energy<br />
: o through our meeting here and through our clear statement again that<br />
we want the Asian-Pacific region to be united not divided<br />
economically, open not closed, and committed to GATT. We want to<br />
seize this moment to try to get it done now. And I've always found<br />
that when you're working on an objective, you shouldn't discuss what<br />
you'll do if you don't get there until after you don't get there. We<br />
still think we can be there, and we're going to try.<br />
Thank you very much. END 3: 02pm Page 4 </p>
