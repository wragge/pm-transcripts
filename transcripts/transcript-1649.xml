TENTH ANNIVE~ RSARY OF MALAYSIAN INDEPENDENCE.<br />
The Prime Minister, 1vir. H~ olt, today ( 31st August)<br />
sent a message of congratulations to the Prime MIinister of<br />
Malaysia, Tunku Abdul Rahman, on the tenth anniversary of<br />
M~ alaysian independence. Mr. H-olt also recorded the message<br />
on tape for broadcasting over Radio L.-alaysia.<br />
Here is the text of the Prime ! h-inister's message:-<br />
" It gives me great pleasure on this your tenth<br />
anniversary of Independence, to convey congratulations<br />
and good wishes from the Australian Government to the<br />
Government and people of Malaysia.<br />
Malaysia's achievements in the decade since August,<br />
1957, have been a source of admiration for the world<br />
at large, and especially for those of us who live in<br />
the region of South E~ ast Asia. The Australian<br />
Government has particularly a'imired the political<br />
tolerance which marks the 1alaysian scene, and the<br />
way in which democratic institutions have taken root<br />
and developed.<br />
There were those in 1957 who feared that on Independence<br />
Malaya would face a period of political instability with<br />
intense rivalry and conflict between the various<br />
communities which went to make up the Federation's<br />
population. The record, however, has proved otherwise.<br />
The unfolding story has been one of internal peace and<br />
communal harmony.<br />
Over this ten year period you have also been able to<br />
withstand the challenges of internal communist insurrection<br />
and external pressures. This has required strong<br />
government and the development of Malaysia's own<br />
machinery for internal security and defence. Your<br />
present stability is an eloquent testimony to the<br />
energy and skill you have devoted to these tasks.<br />
In the economic field the years of independence have<br />
witnessed the greatest progress in your country's history.<br />
A scientific approach to rubber planting and tin<br />
prospecting has ensured increasing returns from these<br />
mainstays of the Mlalaysian economy. Industrialisation<br />
schemes have been proceeding, and significant strides<br />
have been made in agricultural diversification. Your<br />
land settlement scheme is widely regarded as a model<br />
for other developing countries.<br />
I am sure that the progress made in these last ten years<br />
has instilled confidence and enthusiasm for tackling the<br />
problems which lie ahead. IMalaysians and other peoples<br />
in South -'' 0ast Asia, and that includes Australians, live<br />
in an exciting era. Despite the conflict in Viet Nam<br />
and the continuing pressures and tensions to be found<br />
within the area, my colleagues and I believe that a new<br />
Asia is emerging, in which we can all find hope for a<br />
brighter future. f': y own feeling is that the next century<br />
will be the century of Asia. There is, at the very least,<br />
the encouraging prospect of spectacular advance. In this<br />
our two countries will have a significant part ' to play.<br />
May you continue to prosper in the years ahead, in peace<br />
an% hapiness." 1<br />
