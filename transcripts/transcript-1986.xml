TRADE V'I-FH NORTH VIP" TNAM6<br />
Statement the Prime Minister, Mr. John Gorton<br />
The Prime Minister, Mr. Gorton, today restated the<br />
Government's long established policy that there sinould b. e no<br />
trade either by way of exports or imports with North Vietnam.<br />
The Government held firmly to the view that in presenc<br />
circumstances, it would be most unfortunate and inappropriate for<br />
persons to eangage in such trade for private gain while Australian<br />
forces were fighting ill SOUth Vietnam.<br />
The Attorney-General, Mr. 3owen, recently pointed out<br />
that there were adequate powers under existing legislation to give<br />
effect to the policy of recent years. It had, however, now been<br />
decided to introduce new regulations under the Customs Act<br />
specifically relating to North Vietnam and these regulations were<br />
today approved jy the Executive Council.<br />
* The new regulations will prohibit exports to, or imports from,<br />
North Vietnam without the written permission of the Minister for<br />
Customs and Excise. As there has been no commercial trade with<br />
North Vietnam in recent years the new controls will have no adverse<br />
effect on the Australian trading community. They will, however,<br />
remove any doubts about Government policy and the adequacy of<br />
measures to implement that policy.<br />
