PARLIAMENTARY STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
VISIT TO JORDAN, CYPRUS, ISRAEL, SWITZERLAND AND EGYPT<br />
19 FEBRUARY 1987<br />
Madam Speaker,-<br />
I--wish-to r-epo-r-t--to-Parl-i-ament-on-thevisft I-uM-ertoo6kfrom<br />
23 January to 3 February to Jordan, Cyprus, Israel,<br />
Switzerland an-dEgypt.<br />
Before this visit, no Australian Prime Minister had visited<br />
the Middle East for three decades. Yet that region is not<br />
only one of major international importance, but also one of<br />
growing direct interest to Australia.<br />
Australia's interest-in -the region stems-in part-from the<br />
pivotal importance of the Middle East in international<br />
affairs; in part from i-ts massive--oil-reserves; -in part<br />
because it straddles our principal communications, trade and<br />
travel routes. Further, the Middle East is a growth area<br />
for Australian trade, taking exports totalling $ 1.8 billion<br />
in 1985-86 and providing imports worth $ 1.2 billion. Our<br />
multicultural society includes several communities with<br />
strong links to the region. And, not least among these<br />
interests Madam Speaker, Australia has sincere concerns of<br />
principle in the region: we regard the conflict in Lebanon<br />
as a human tragedy; we support the principle of<br />
self-determination of the Palestinian people; and like<br />
successive Australian governments we-see moral. as well as<br />
political imperatives in our commitment to the security of<br />
Israel and its right to exist within secure and recognised<br />
boundaries. </p>
<p>Accordingly, the objectives of my visit to the Middle East<br />
were clear. The first objective was to demonstrate that<br />
despite our geographical distance from the region, Australia<br />
recognises the significance of the Middle East, both in<br />
international affairs and specifically in relation to<br />
Australia. Secondly, I sought to acquire at the highest level an<br />
appreciation of the political problems and prospects of the<br />
.__ region, proj-ectingAustralia not . as a... party_. princ. ipal to the.<br />
resolution of the various issues, but as a responsible and<br />
concerned nation bringing to those issues a balanced and<br />
principled policy.<br />
Third, I sought to cement friendly and constructive<br />
relations with the leadership and people of Israel and in<br />
the two key moderate Arab nations, Jordan and Egypt. This<br />
friendship had already been enhanced by visits to Australia<br />
by Middle Eastern leaders, most recently by Presfdent Chaim"'<br />
Herzog of Israel.<br />
My fourth objective was to develop our good bilateral<br />
relationships with these countries to our mutual benefit<br />
and, in particular, to assist Australia's commercial<br />
interests. In Cyprus, it was my intention to discuss with the Cypriot<br />
leadership the problems besetting that island and to<br />
underline Australia's hopes for settlement of those<br />
problems. The visit also symbolised the-friendly relations<br />
existing between Australia and Cyprus, not least as a legacy<br />
of migration and settlement.<br />
Finally in Switzerland, the objective of my visit was, at<br />
the World Economic Forum meeting in Davos, to highlight the<br />
precarious state of the international trading system, to<br />
argue the need for reform of agricultural trade and to<br />
promote Australia as a focus of increased foreign investment<br />
and as a trading partner. </p>
<p>I am pleased to state that all these objectives of my visit<br />
were fully met.<br />
The Middle East<br />
On its election t-d-ffie, my Gobernment undertook a review<br />
of policy towards the Arab-Israeli dispute and reaffirmed<br />
the basic principles-which have-guided-Austraian-policy.<br />
These principles are:<br />
recognition of the urgent need to achieve a just,<br />
comprehensive and lasting settlement to the Middle East<br />
dispute. fundamental commitment to the security of Israel and its<br />
right to exist within secure and-recognised-boundaries.<br />
S recognition of-the-central-importance of-the Palestinian<br />
issue for any settlement.<br />
acknowledgement of the rights of self-determination of<br />
the Palestinian people, including their right, if they<br />
so choose, to independence and the possibility of their<br />
own independent state.<br />
During my visit to the region, I presented this policy to<br />
all my interlocutors, as an integrated whole. It was<br />
accepted by them all as a credible, principled, balanced and<br />
legitimate position. </p>
<p>In my discussions in the Middle East which were thorough,<br />
detailed and invariably most friendly a fundamental theme<br />
that emerged was the desire for peace of the Governments of<br />
the three countries I visited. The sincerity of this desire<br />
was marked not just by a yearning for the absence of<br />
conflict but by a-perception that real and lasting peace<br />
will permit economic development and yield improvements in<br />
the quality of the everyday life-fthe peopreo6faii<br />
nations there.<br />
However, there are differences among thel parties concernedon<br />
the ways of achieving such a peace. In particular, there<br />
are differences on the question of the suitability of an<br />
international conference as a means of resolving the<br />
differences among the parties.<br />
Some parties want such a conference-involving the-five<br />
permanent members of the Security Council, the nations of<br />
the region, and the PLO. They-do not envisage it-imposing<br />
solutions on the parties concerned but rather providing a<br />
framework in which negotiations can take place between the<br />
parties principal. In this sense the gap between the<br />
concepts of an international conference and of direct<br />
negotiations may well not be as great as is frequently<br />
suggested.<br />
Australia sees merit in such a proposal. Determining<br />
details, such as the precise methods of procedure in such a<br />
conference, remains a complex task, but this is not a reason<br />
for the key players withholding positive-consideration of<br />
the concept. </p>
<p>I was impressed during my visit by the commitment of both<br />
Israel and Egypt to maintaining the peaceful relationship<br />
they established through the Camp David process. I<br />
commended both countries for the courage and creativity of<br />
Camp David which remains a landmark in efforts to achieve<br />
peace in this troubled region. Egypt and Israel are I<br />
believe prepared to build further on the spirit of Camp<br />
David. At their Alexandria summit last September, 1987 was<br />
des i gn ated by them as__ a _ Yer_ rltiaions_ andTbelie ve<br />
everyone in this Parliament would wish-that this hopebe<br />
realised.<br />
A central requirement in any resolution of Jordan's<br />
relations with Israel is to determine the future of the<br />
Palestinian people. In a number of the discussions I had in<br />
the Middle East, I encountered an. emerging, important and<br />
strongly held view that the most likely and appropriate<br />
outcome for the Palestinian people is a confederation with<br />
the state of Jordan.<br />
While I was in the Middle East I had discussions with<br />
Palestinians themselves about the problems they face on the<br />
West Bank and in Gaza, including restrictions on their<br />
political and economic freedoms.<br />
I also heard from the Jordanian Government its plans for a<br />
program of humanitarian assistance to the West Bank. I was<br />
pleased to give this program the moral and political support<br />
of the Australian Government and I told the Jordanians that<br />
-we would also, in our budget-context-ycons-ider gi'ing-it<br />
material support.<br />
A central obstacle to progress in resolving the Middle East<br />
dispute, I believe, is that factual realities are not fully<br />
reflected in formal positions. </p>
<p>It is clear that there is no organisation at this point<br />
which speaks for the Palestinians more than does the<br />
Palestine Liberation Organisation, not just in the West Bank<br />
and Gaza but more broadly in what can be thought of as the<br />
Palestinian Diaspora. The PLO may not have an exclusive<br />
representative status--but it-does have a representative<br />
status. This is not a value judgement about the PLO but<br />
simply a statement--of-fact-I -beli-eve-this-fafct is<br />
understood in Israel.<br />
It is equally clear that Israel's-antagonists, including<br />
surely the PLO or at least the more sane elements of the<br />
organisation, now accept that Israel exists and will<br />
continue to exist as a independent and viable state in the<br />
Middle East. They know this is a fact.<br />
But these realities are not yet expli-citly-recognised-in thestated<br />
policies of those parties involved. Progress towards<br />
peace in the region could be made i-f-both-sides were-toissue<br />
a simultaneous statement acknowledging each other's<br />
existence if in effect each was explicitly to state what<br />
at present it tacitly believes.<br />
What I believe is required is for the PLO for its part<br />
to issue a formal statement of position which would entail<br />
acceptance of resolutions 242 and 338 as a basis for<br />
negotiation and thus ( ii) recognition of Israel and ( iii)<br />
renunciation of terror in favour of the process of<br />
negotiation. For its part, Israel would be required, in the cortext of<br />
such a formal statement of position, to recognise the-PLO as<br />
a party appropriately to be included in the negotiating<br />
processes. </p>
<p>In addition to this central Arab-Israeli dispute, my<br />
discussions in the Middle East also covered two other<br />
regional conflicts of very great concern to all the<br />
government leaders I met: the continuing tragedy of civil<br />
violence in Lebanon and the ceaseless and senseless<br />
slaughter and destructioni-n the war between Iraq and Iran.<br />
On Lebanon, I put AustrTia's view that all foreign forces<br />
should be withdrawn except those which are in Lebanon at the<br />
request of the Lebanese government and whose presence is<br />
necessary to allow the development of conditions which canallow<br />
social, economic and political stability to be<br />
re-established within Lebanon and the authority of the<br />
Lebanese government to be asserted.<br />
I made the point that the presence in Australia of a large<br />
and valuable Lebanese community; with close links to their<br />
country of origin, brought the tragic situation in Lebanon<br />
home to our national consciousness in a very graphic way.<br />
On the Iran-Iraq war, Australia has maintained a position of<br />
strict neutrality. Neutrality is not, of course,<br />
disinterest. On the contrary we have tried wherever<br />
possible, notably at the United Nations, to contribute to a<br />
solution. We shall continue to do so.<br />
Madam Speaker,<br />
Australia has long proven its credentials as a country<br />
sincerely concerned for peace in the Middle East. To theextent<br />
possible we have been involved in measures to achieve<br />
it: we have for instance contributed personnel to peace<br />
keeping activities in the region and we have used<br />
multilateral forums and bilateral links to advance the-cause<br />
of peace wherever possible. However, it would be idle to<br />
pretend that easy solutions exist in the region, or that<br />
Australia has any direct role in the peace process itself.<br />
I </p>
<p>To SUM up, my visit took place at a time when the path to<br />
resolving the Arab-Israeli dispute again seemed obstructed.<br />
There are no immediate prospects for a breakthrough. At the<br />
same time I was encouraged by the fact that the commitment<br />
to peace by the parties concerned has not died. Indeed,__ L___<br />
detected a sense of realistic determination to continue,<br />
slowly but persistently, thfesearch-for progress. Moreover,--<br />
as I have described,.-I believe there are ideas and concepts<br />
Swhich, if--Pursued, would Qffer aa iyahead<br />
I have-said that Australia seeks no mediating or-other roreT<br />
in the middle East peace process. However, as I made clear<br />
during my visit, we are willing, if requested, to do all we<br />
can to help bring peace to this divided yet fundamentally<br />
interrelated region. No Australian Government can or should<br />
offer less.<br />
Bilateral Relations with Jordan, Israel and Egypt<br />
I said at the outset of this report, madam Speaker, that<br />
Australia had several important interests in the Middle<br />
East. In Jordan, Israel and Egypt I was keen to advance the<br />
bilateral links Australia has with each of those nations.<br />
Australian trade with Jordan is currently weighted heavily<br />
in our favour. In our talks in Amman, the Jordanians<br />
expressed their desire to increase exports of phosphate<br />
rock, potash and other fertilisers to Australia. They..<br />
believe there may be scope for this as our current sources<br />
of supply diminish. undertook to-study a ' draft~ tr-adiiagreement<br />
prepared by Jordan. </p>
<p>Prospects exist for significant joint ventures, which will<br />
be further explored by both countries. These include the<br />
provision of fresh chilled sheep meat based on the<br />
importation of live sheep from Australia for fattening in<br />
Jordan, and Australian involvement in railway or road<br />
development and phosphate fertiliser industries. I also<br />
flagged Australia's interest in becoming a coal supplier to<br />
a-new Jordanian -power-station.<br />
Australian aid to Jordan consists principally of support for<br />
a Dryland Farming Project. Funding-foTrthis project is-due<br />
to expire at the end of the year; however I told the<br />
Jordanians we would be prepared to consider a modest<br />
extension of this project.<br />
Beyond these government to government links, Australia is<br />
well represented in Jordan through i-t-s-archaeologists:----I<br />
had the very great pleasure of inspecting the site of<br />
. Pella, one of the most-important archaeological-site-s--in-the<br />
Middle East, which is being revealed to the world through<br />
the capable involvement of an Australian team headed by<br />
Professor Basil Hennessy of the University of Sydney.<br />
In Israel, I agreed with Prime Minister Shamir to establish<br />
a Working Party to examine the possibilities of further<br />
economic and trade co-operation between Israel and<br />
Australia. The Working Party's tasks will include the investigation of<br />
Prime Minister Shamir's expression of interest in industrial<br />
and agricultural co-operation with Australia and my<br />
suggestion of further coal exports to Israel.-<br />
Australia and Israel also signed a-Science and Technology<br />
Agreement during my visit. This is a result of the valuable<br />
contacts established by my colleague, the Minister for<br />
Science and Technology, Mr Jones, during his visit to Israel<br />
in 1985. </p>
<p>In a meeting with the mothers and relatives of refuseniks<br />
Jews who have been denied enaw-w exit visas by the Soviet<br />
Union I agreed to raise at every appropriate opportunity<br />
the issue of the Soviet treatment of Jews. As I told<br />
Parliament earlier this week, I had taken steps to<br />
investigate the particularly pressing case of Sofia Landver,<br />
who told me in this meeting that she-wanted to visit her<br />
terminally -il mother in the Soviet Union. I had<br />
representations made about her case in Moscow and Canberra,<br />
nd I took it up_ personally with the Soviet Ambassador in<br />
Australia. . I-am pleased to note that Mrs-Landver has sihce<br />
been granted permission to enter the Soviet Union.<br />
This is a significant human rights issue but, to revert for<br />
a moment to questions of the Middle East peace process, the<br />
issue also has a political significance. A major factor in<br />
Israel's willingness to accept an Internatihoal Conference<br />
involving the Soviet Union will clearly be whether the<br />
Soviet Union is prepared to improve the posit-ion-of-Soviet-<br />
Jewry. The Foreign Minister, Mr Hayden, and I will raise<br />
this and other matters with the Soviet Foreign Minister,<br />
Mr Shevardnadze, when he visits Canberra next month.<br />
Madam Speaker, ties between this Parliament and the Israeli<br />
Knesset are very close. Your counterpart, Mr Shlomo Hillel,<br />
assured me a warm welcome awaits you when you visit in June.<br />
There was also widespread approbation in Israel of this<br />
Parliament's unanimous call last October for a rejection of<br />
the United Nations General Assembly resolution equating<br />
Zionism with racism.<br />
It was apparent throughout my visit to Israel that one of<br />
the strongest links between our two countries is formed by<br />
Australia's large Jewish community. Its contribution to<br />
Australian society at all levels has been incalculable and<br />
invaluable, and its close contact with Israel has done more<br />
to promote understanding and goodwill between our countries<br />
than any policies, words or deeds by Governments could have<br />
achieved. </p>
<p>In Cairo, as in Amman, a principal area of concern was the<br />
strong trading imbalance. Egypt is one of Australia's<br />
principal markets for wheat. But Egypt exports little to<br />
us. I assured Egypt we will do all we can to expand Egypt's<br />
opportunities to export to Australia. A Joint Committee<br />
will be established--between -the-two-count-riesT-not only to<br />
foster trade but to help develop _ the bilateral relationship<br />
neyrra1lly-alag. e-ed-weew-a -i-th-the-nepte f etablishin a<br />
joint business council, but this is in the final analysis of<br />
courrsea--matt-er-fortbu-sine'ss community itself. The idea<br />
-is-being investigated.<br />
Closer agricultural co-operation is in prospect as a result<br />
of our talks, and I noted Australia's ability to supply<br />
technology and raw materials to projects such as the 2400<br />
megawatt Zafarana coal fired power station.<br />
Australia also indicated that efforts would be made to<br />
encourage increased Australian tou. rismto_ Egypt. _ Egypt's<br />
tourist attractions are of course well known already. But<br />
they will be even better known as a result of the very<br />
generous offer made by Prime Minister Sidky: that Egypt<br />
would be pleased to participate in our Bicentennial<br />
celebrations next year by providing a pharaonic exhibition.<br />
We are of course delighted at this offer and look forward<br />
with great anticipation to seeing the exhibition.<br />
Cyprus In my visit to Cyprus, I had detailed talks with President<br />
Kyprianou. We both noted the excellent relations that exist<br />
between Australia and Cyprus. Tens of thousands of Greek<br />
and Turkish Cypriots now live in Australia and continue to<br />
make valuable contributions to our multicultural society. </p>
<p>The substantive discussion with President Kyprianou focused<br />
almost exclusively on the tragic problems facing the divided<br />
island of Cyprus. Australia has been active in the search<br />
for a solution, both in the United Nations and through the<br />
Commonwealth.<br />
We strongly support the independence, sovereignty,<br />
___ territorial-integi-t-y,-uivi-ty-and-non-a-l-i-gn-ed statu-of-the<br />
Republic of Cyprus, as provided for in United Nations<br />
-S-e-curity-Couni-Tl resolutions 51 and--550. I also expressedursupport<br />
for the UN Secretary-General's-efforts to find a.<br />
solution, while noting that none of his proposals had so far<br />
proved acceptable to all parties. Australia believes all<br />
sides should co-operate with the Secretary-General and take<br />
no action which could jeopardise his efforts.<br />
The President welcomed Australia's. support for a solution<br />
and reiterated his Government's gratitude for Australia's<br />
role in providing personnel to-the United-Nations Force in<br />
Cyprus. I took the opportunity to meet Australia's contingent of<br />
police and to express the Government's appreciation of the<br />
contribution they and their predecessors have made to the<br />
people of Cyprus, to the United Nations and to Australia's<br />
reputation as a co-operative and effective member of the<br />
international community.<br />
Switzerland In Davos, I attended and, at the invitation of the"<br />
organisers, delivered the keynote address at, the World<br />
Economic Forum symposium. I saw this annual conference as a<br />
valuable opportunity to highlight-the achievements and<br />
potential of the Australian economy and to present before an<br />
exceptional audience of corporate and Government Yeaders our<br />
case against the spreading plague of protectionism in world<br />
markets. </p>
<p>My keynote address focused on the urgent need to free up<br />
world trade, particularly the trade in agricultural<br />
products. Agricultural protectionism, as practised by the<br />
United States, the European Community and Japan, is damaging<br />
not only efficient agricultural producers like Australia and<br />
-third world economies which are heavily reliant on<br />
agricultural-trade.---It-is also damaging the protectionist<br />
-natTons-thewselvrs. Accordin g ly, 1T' lauinc-hed att h e<br />

reduce the gap between worldand-domestic agricultural_<br />
-price: s,_ so -that-market f. o rces . can~ gain ptrovide-greate-r--<br />
rationality to agricultural trade.<br />
These proposals are now being followed up bilaterally with<br />
other Governments including through the efforts of the<br />
Primary Industry Minister, Mr Kerin and the Trade Minister,<br />
Mr Dawkins.<br />
SAlso at -the-symposium, the Minister-for Industry, Technology<br />
and Commerce, Senator Button and I made a special<br />
presentation describing the significant investment and trade<br />
opportunities that exist in Australia as a result of my<br />
Government's economic policies. I outlined the strengths of<br />
the Australian economy and the principal elements of the<br />
Government's economic strategy, while Senator Button<br />
detailed the specifics of our industrial and investment<br />
policies. In Geneva, I took the opportunity to discuss with the<br />
Secretary-General of the-Conference on-Disarmament,-Mr-<br />
Miljan Komatina, in particular, our hopes for progress on a<br />
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, a Chemical Weapons convention<br />
and a halt to the escalating arms race in outer space.<br />
Australia has been active in pursuing-each-of these issues',<br />
including in the Conference on Disarmament. Mr Komatina<br />
praised the constructive role Australia has played,<br />
I I </p>
<p>14.<br />
stressing the high-level political commitment we have<br />
demonstrated, the practical and effective attention we have<br />
devoted to important issues such as verification, and the<br />
dedication and professionalism of our Ambassador for<br />
Disarmament and other Australian representatives.<br />
Madam Speaker,<br />
I believe that as a result of my visit our relations with<br />
the key-Middle Eastern states of Israel, Jordan and Egypt<br />
have-been strengthened. I am pleased to inform the House<br />
that, on behalf of the Government, I invited King Hussein<br />
and President Mubarak to visit Australia. These invitations<br />
were accepted. Our commercial and other links with each of<br />
the three countries seem set to multiply and diversify. Our<br />
understanding of the Middle East in general has been<br />
deepened and our commitment to fair and principled policies<br />
in support of peace affirmed. Our friendly relationship<br />
with Cyprus has been fortified. Our arguments against<br />
protectionism have been advanced and our attractiveness for<br />
foreign investment and a partner for trade has been<br />
highlighted. I<br />

<p>PARLIAMENTARY STATEMENT BY THE PRIME<br />
OF REPRESENTATIVES, 19 FEBRUARY 1987 MINISTER, HOUSE<br />
VISIT TO JORDON, CYPRUS, ISRAEL,<br />
SWITZERLAND AND EGYPT<br />
Ministerial Statement<br />
Mr HAWKE ( Wills-Prime Minister) -by<br />
leave-I wish to report to Parliament on the<br />
visit I undertook from 23 January to 3 February<br />
to Jordan, -Cyprus, Israel, Switzerland and Egypt.<br />
Before this visit, no Australian Prime Minister<br />
had visited the Middle East for three decades.<br />
Yet that region is not only one of major international<br />
importance, but also one of growing<br />
direct interest to Australia.<br />
Australia's interest in the region stems in part<br />
from the pivotal importance of the Middle East<br />
in international affairs; in part from its massive<br />
. reserves; in part because it straddles our<br />
1tncipal communications, trade and travel<br />
routes. Further, the Middle East is-a growth<br />
area for Australian trade, taking exports totalling<br />
$ 1.8 billion in 1985-86 and providing imports<br />
worth $ 1.2 billion. Our multicultural society includes<br />
several communities with strong link s to<br />
the region. And, not least among these interests,<br />
Madam Speaker, Australia has sincere concerns<br />
of principle in the region: We regard the conflict<br />
in the Lebanon as a human tragedy; wve support<br />
the principle of self-determination of the Palestinian people; and, like successive Australian<br />
governments, we see-moral as well as political<br />
imperatives in our commitment to the security<br />
of Israel and its right to-exist wvithin secure and<br />
recognised boundaries.<br />
Accordingly, the objectives of my visit to the<br />
Middle East were clear. The first objective w. as<br />
to demonstrate that, despite our geographical<br />
distance from the region, Australia recognises<br />
the sienificance of the Middle East, both in<br />
International affairs and specifically in relation<br />
to Australia.<br />
Secondly, I sought to acquire at the highest<br />
level an appreciation of the political problems<br />
and prospects of the region, projecting Australia<br />
not as a party principal to the resolution of the<br />
various. issues, but as a responsible and concerned<br />
nation bring to those issues a balanced<br />
and principled policy..-<br />
Thirdly, I sought to cement friendly and constructive<br />
relations wvith the leadership and people<br />
of Israel and in the two key moderate Arabnations,<br />
Jordan and Egypt. This friendship had<br />
already been enhanced by visits to Australia by<br />
Middle Eastern leaders, miost recently by President<br />
Chaim Herzog of Israel.<br />

s'ne elements of the organisation, now accept<br />
that Israel exists and will continue to exist as a<br />
independent and viable state in the Middle East.<br />
They know this as a fact. But these realities are<br />
not yet explicitly recognised in the stated policies<br />
of those parties involved. Progress towards peace<br />
in the region could be made if both sides were<br />
to issue a simultaneous statement acknowledging<br />
each other's existence-if in effect each was<br />
explicitly to state what at present it tacitly<br />
believes. What I believe is required is for the PLO, for<br />
its part, to issue a formal statement of position<br />
which would entail acceptance of resolutions<br />
242 and 338 as a basis for negotiations and thus<br />
( ii) recognition of Israel and ( iii) renunciation<br />
of terror in favour of the process of negotiation.<br />
For its part, Israel would be required, in the<br />
Stext of such a formal statement of position,<br />
to recognise the PLO as a party appropriately<br />
to be included in the negotiating process.<br />
In addition to this central Arab-Israeli dispute,<br />
my discussions in the Middle East also covered<br />
two other regional conflicts of very great concern<br />
to all the government leaders I met: -The<br />
continuing tragedy of civil violence in Lebanon<br />
and the ceaseless and senseless slaughter and<br />

On Lebanon, I put Australia's view that all<br />
foreign forces should be withdrawn except -those<br />
which are in Lebanon at the request of the<br />
Lebanese Government and whose presence is<br />
necessary to allow the development of conditions<br />
which can allow social, economic and political<br />
stability to be re-established within Lebanon and<br />
the authority of the Lebanese Government to be<br />
asserted. I made the point that the presence in<br />
Australia of a large and valuable Lebanese community,<br />
with close links to their country of origin,<br />
brought the tragic situation in Lebanon home<br />
to our national consciousness in a very graphic<br />
way.<br />

However, it would be idle to pretend that easy<br />
solutions exist in the region, or that Australia<br />
has any direct role in the peace process itself.<br />
To sum up, my visit took place at a time<br />
when the path to resolving the Arab-Israeli dispute<br />
again seemed obstructed. There are no immediate<br />
prospects for a breakthrough. At the_<br />
same time I was encouraged by the fact that the<br />
commitment to peace by the parties concerned<br />
has not died. Indeed, I detected a sense of real--<br />
istic determination to continue, slowly but persistently,<br />
the search for progress. Moreover, as I<br />
have described, I believe there are ideas and<br />
concepts-which, if pursued, would offer a way<br />
ahead. I have said that Australia seeks no mediating<br />
or other role in the Middle East peace<br />
process. However, as I made clear during my<br />
visit, we are willing, if requested, to do all we<br />
can to help bring peace to this divided yet fundamentally<br />
interrelated region. No Australian<br />
government can or should offer less.<br />
Bilateral Relations with Jordan, Israel and<br />
Egypt<br />
said. at . the outset of thisreport that. Australia<br />
had several important interests in the Middle<br />
East. In Jordan, Israel and Egypt I was keen<br />
to advance the bilateral links Australia has with<br />
each of those nations. Australian trade with Jordan<br />
is currently weighted heavily in our favour.<br />
In our talks in Amman, the JordanainS expressed<br />
their desire to increase exports of phosphate<br />
rock, potash and other fertilisers to Australia.<br />
They believe there may be scope for this as our<br />
current sources of supply diminish. I undertook<br />
to study a draft trade agreement prepared by<br />
Jordan. Prospects exist for significant joint ventures,<br />
which will be further explored by both countries.<br />
These include the provision of fresh chilled sheep<br />

from Australia for fattening in Jordan, and Aus-</p>

Cyprus<br />
In my visit to Cyprus, I had detailed talks<br />
with President Kyprianou. We both noted the<br />
excellent relations that exist between Australia<br />
and Cyprus. Tens of thousands of Greek and<br />
Turkish Cypriots now live in Australia and continue<br />
to make extremely valuable contributions<br />
to our multicultural society. The substantive discussion_<br />
with_ President Kypriarnou_ focused _ almost<br />
exclusively on the tragic problems facing<br />
the divided island of Cyprus. Australia has been<br />
active i tlie-search forTa solution; both n-rThe<br />
United Nations and through the Commonwealth.<br />
We strongly support the independence, sovereignty,<br />
territorial integrity, unity and non-aligned<br />
status of the Republic of Cyprus, as provided<br />
for in United Nations Security Council resoutions<br />
541 and 550. I also expressed our support<br />
for the UN Secretary-General's efforts to find a<br />
sulution, while noting that none of his proposals<br />
had so far proved acceptable to all parties. Australia<br />
believes all sides should co-operate with<br />
the Secretary-General and take no action which<br />
could jeopardise his efforts. The President wel,<br />
comed Australia's support for a solution and<br />
reiterated his Government's gratitude for Australia's<br />
role in providing personnel to the United<br />
Nations force in Cyprus. I took the opportunity<br />
to meet Australia's contingent of police and to<br />
express the Government's appreciation of the<br />
contribution they and their predecessors have<br />
made to the people of Cyprus, to the United<br />
. tions and to Australia's reputation as a cooperative<br />
and effective member of the international<br />
community. Switzerland<br />
In Davos, 1 attended and, at the invitation of<br />
the organisers, delivered the keynote address at<br />
the World Economic Forum symposium. I saw<br />
this annual conference as a valuable opportunity<br />
to highlight the achievements and potential of<br />
the Australian economy and to present before<br />
an exceptional audience of corporate and government<br />
leaders our case against the spreading<br />
plague of protectionism in world markets.<br />
My keynote address focused on the urgent<br />
need to free up world trade, particularly the<br />
trade in agricultural products. Agricultural protectiionism,<br />
as practised by the United States, the<br />
European Community and Japan is not only<br />
damaging efficient agricultural producers like<br />
Australia and Third World economics which are<br />
heavily reliant on agricultural tadc. It is also<br />
damaging the protectionist nations themsclvcs.<br />
Accordingly. I launched at thel symposium ia proposal to freeze the level of subsidies and to<br />
reduce the gap between world and domestic<br />
agricultural prices so that market forces can<br />
again provide greater rationality to agricultural<br />
trade. These proposals are now being followed<br />
up bilaterally with other governments, including<br />
through the efforts of the Minister for Primary<br />
Industry ( Mr Kerin) and the Minister for Trade<br />
( Mr Dawkins).<br />
Also at the symposium, the Minister for Industry,<br />
Technology and Commerce ( Senator<br />
Button) and I-made-a--special-presentation--describing<br />
the significant investment and trade opportunities<br />
that exist in Australia as a result of<br />
my Government's economic policies. I outlined<br />
the strengths of the Australian economy and the<br />
principal elements of the Government's economic<br />
strategy. while Senator Button detaiied<br />
the specifics of our industrial and investment<br />
policies. In Geneva, I took the opportunity to discuss<br />
with the Secretary-General of the Conference on<br />
Disarmament, Mr Miljan Komatina, in particular,<br />
our hopes for progress on a comprehensive<br />
test ban treaty, a chemical weapons convention<br />
and a halt to the escalating arms race in cuter<br />
space. Australia has been active in pursuing each<br />
of these issues, including in the Conference o:-<br />
Disarmament. Mr Komatina praised the constructive<br />
role Australia has played, stressing the<br />
high level political commitment we have demonstrated,<br />
the practical and effective attention<br />
we have devoted to important issues such as<br />
verification, and the dedication and professionalism<br />
of our Ambassador for Disarmament and<br />
other Australian representatives.<br />
Mr Deputy Speaker, I believe that as a result<br />
of my visit our relations with the key Middle<br />
Eastern states of Israel, Jordan and Egypt have<br />
been strengthened. 1 am pleased to inform the<br />
House that, on behalf of the Government, I<br />
invited King Hussein and President Mubarak to<br />
visit Australia. These invit: ations were accepted.<br />
Our commercial and other links with each of<br />
the three countries seem set to multiply and<br />
diversify. Our understanding of the Middle East<br />
in general has been deepened, and our commitment<br />
to fair and principled policies in support<br />
of peace aftirmed. Our friendly relationship with<br />
Cyprus has been fortified. Our arguments against<br />
protectionism have been advanced and our attractiveness<br />
for foreign investment and as a partner<br />
for trade has been highlighted.<br />
