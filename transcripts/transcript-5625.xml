PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA FRIDAY, 24 JULY 1981<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER AND THE PRESIDENT<br />
OF THE ACTU, MR DOLAN<br />
The Government, represented by the Prime Minister, the<br />
Deputy Prime Minister and the Acting minister for Industrial<br />
Relations, Mr Fife,. met today in the presence of the<br />
President of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission,<br />
Sir John Moore, with representatives of the Australian<br />
Council of Trade Unions*-Mr C. Dolan, President;<br />
Mr C. FitzGibbon, Senior Vice-President; Mr P. Nolan,<br />
Secretary; Mr W. Kelty, Assistant Secretary; Mrs J. Marsh,<br />
Advocate. The meeting was called at th e suggestion of the President<br />
of the ACTU in the face of growing industrial disruption<br />
from disputes some of which are associated with transport<br />
workers, Telecom clerical officers and employees of the<br />
Port of Melbourne Authority.<br />
There was a-useful and wide-ranging discussion about the<br />
serious state of industrial unrest in Australia and about<br />
its causes.<br />
Both parties agreed that the matter is very serious and<br />
that there are obligations for everyone to do all they could<br />
to lessen the industrial disruption now present in<br />
Australia and to work for industrial stability.<br />
As a result, the parties have agreed to take certain action<br />
and to accept certain moral responsibilities.<br />
The ACTU, for its part, will recommend an immediate<br />
resumption of normal work and will use all its influence<br />
to achieve this without bans or limitations in each of<br />
these disputes. / 2 L/ </p>
<p>0 The Government, for its part, will not pursue action under<br />
section 143A for a declaration from the Conciliation and<br />
Arbitration Commission concerning the Transport Workers'<br />
Union. It will revoke suspensions of its own employees<br />
taken under the Commonwealth Employees ( Employment Provisions)<br />
Act. The Government agreed on the Telecom clerical officers<br />
dispute that it would be appropriate for early discussions<br />
to be held between the Ministers for Industrial Relations<br />
and: Communications and the ACTU, together with the<br />
ACOA and APSA. It is expected this meeting will take<br />
place on Sunday.<br />
Both parties agreed that a contributing factor in the<br />
industrial situation was the way in which the current wage<br />
fixation principles were seen by unions to inhibit proper<br />
consideration of the merits of their claims.<br />
Both the Government and the ACTU officers agreed that the<br />
principles should not operate to prevent a resolution or<br />
prevention of industrial disputation by inhibiting the<br />
examination of claims on'their merits.<br />
Specifically, they accepted that in recent times the<br />
anomalies and inequities provisions of the principles have<br />
not provided the safety valve that was originally intended<br />
and therefore they hoped that deficiency would be rectified<br />
through the procedures the President of the Commission<br />
had unfolded in his statement this morning. The Government<br />
and the ACTU agreed to work co-operatively in efforts to<br />
overcome that deficiency.<br />
If the ACTU is unsuccessful in achieving an early return to<br />
work, the Government will of course have to review its position.<br />
