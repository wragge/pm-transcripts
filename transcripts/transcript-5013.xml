PRHAAUSRMINISTE<br />
FOR MEDIA 6 APRIL 1979<br />
C. S. I. R. O0. RANGE LANDS' LABORATORY<br />
ALICE SPRINGS<br />
It's twelve months almost to the day that I last visited<br />
Alice Springs. I enjoyed myself immensely last time, and<br />
I was delighted to receive this invitation to open the<br />
C. S. I. R. 0. ' s new Range Land'Is Laboratory.<br />
Knowing the C. S. I. R. O. scientists' awsome thirst for knowledge,<br />
it's not surprising that the C. S. I. R. O. has played such<br />
a prominent role in rangelands research. The C. S. I. R. O.<br />
team is part of a national range lands' team and has become a<br />
focal point for range lands' activities. Australia must develop<br />
management principles and practices which will maintain the<br />
range lands in a stable and productive condition. We look<br />
to the C. S. I. R. O. team to provide the lead.<br />
It's not often realised that about 75 percent of Australia<br />
lacks sufficient rainfall for crop production or for<br />
pasture improvement. With so much of our country arid or<br />
semi-arid, and bearing in mind the contribution the range lands<br />
make to Australia's agricultural export income, the<br />
establishment of the C. S. I. R. O. central Australian laboratory<br />
in Alice Springs assumes major importance.<br />
It has been estimated that over-grazing by sheep and cattle<br />
has severely degraded 30 percent of the rangelands. In some<br />
cases, the damage may be practically irreversible. But fortunately,<br />
over most of the continent either the condition of the<br />
range lands can be improved, or further degradation prevented.<br />
This research will help agriculture by contributing to the<br />
long-term stability of the land and vegetation. It is also<br />
essential for the future viability of the pastoral and<br />
tourist industries, for the conservation of our unique flora<br />
and fauna and most importantly for the welfare of the<br />
Aboriginal population living in the area.<br />
The research work is done on commercially operating properties.<br />
While this imposes some restrictions, it has the advantage of<br />
presenting a full range of environments for study, under<br />
" 1real-life" conditions. / 2 </p>

The C. S. I. R. O. has been involved with central Australia<br />
for some 25 years and has notched up some important successes.<br />
For example, the land surveys of the 1950' s provided for<br />
the first time an accurate inventory of central Australia's<br />
climatic and land resources. The maps produced have proved<br />
invaluable to a great number of Government departments and<br />
other sections of the community.<br />
Another early activity in the district was plant<br />
introduction. Over 400 potentially useful grasses and shrubs<br />
from all over the world were introduced and thoroughly tested<br />
over a ten to fifteen year period. The results were<br />
disappointing. None of the introductions fared as well in our<br />
poor soils and erratic rainfall as our own native species.<br />
Although disappointing, the results highlight the need for<br />
good husbandry of our native pastures. We cannot expect<br />
to find any wonder plants to replace them. However, six of<br />
the introduced species--the ones which fared best in the local<br />
conditions--were used in replanting areas around the<br />
Alice Springs' Airport. They assisted to reduce the dust<br />
problem which plagued Alice Springs during prolonged bouts<br />
of dry weather. I'm sure that plants that reduce dust would<br />
be appreciated in Canberra, especiqlly when Parliament<br />
is sitting.<br />
The research programme of this laboratory is directed to<br />
the problems and welfare of the central Australian region.<br />
Its research will also benefit Australia's vast arid zone,<br />
and similar zones overseas. For example, during my visit to<br />
India earlier this year it was agreed that there should be<br />
discussions between our two countries on ways of expanding<br />
our co-operation in various scientific fields.<br />
At this very moment there is a delegation of Australian<br />
scientists in India some of whom are from the C. S. I. R. O.<br />
who are discussing arid and semi-arid zone research with<br />
their Indian counterparts. These discussions build on the<br />
close working relationship between the C. S. I. R. O. range lands'<br />
group and the " Rajastan Central Arid Zone Research Institute"<br />
in Jodhpur, India. I've no doubt that this new laboratory<br />
will provide further opportunities for the exchange of<br />
knowledge and experience between our two countries.<br />
Thank you once again for inviting me here today. I have<br />
pleasure in declaring open the C. S. I. R. O. Central<br />
Australian Laboratory. 000---</p>
