NEW ZEALAND PRIME MINISTER'S VISIT </p>
<p>I am delighted that the New Zealand Prime Minister, Mr Borger, will be<br />
visiting Australia on 20 March 1996. </p>
<p>I have spoken to the Prime Minister on several occasions since the election as befits the strong and close relationship which Australia and New Zealand enjoy. </p>
<p>The relationship between our countries is an important one. Our economic, political and defence links are substantial and we share many common interests in the region. My Government is committed to further strengthening these links. </p>
<p>I look forward to an informal working lunch with Mr Bolger where we will have the opportunity to discuss a range of issues of mutual interest. </p>
<p>14 March 1996 </p>
