    <content><![CDATA[<p>As 2003 ends, our thoughts must be with the people of Iran who have suffered one of the worst natural disasters of modern times.</p>
<p>International relief has been swift and generous â the one source of comfort amid such an appalling human tragedy.</p>
<p> The capture of Saddam Hussein and the highly significant decision of Libya to give up its weapons of mass destruction provided a positive end to the year.</p>
<p>In 2004, there can be no let up in the struggle against international terrorism.  We are all its potential targets.</p>
<p> As in the past, the government';s goals in the New Year will be to maintain for Australia national security, economic strength and social stability.</p>
<p>The continued strength of the Australian economy is illustrated by the fact that for the first time in 35 years our inflation rate is below 3 per cent and our unemployment rate below 6 per cent.</p>
<p>The further fall in unemployment through 2003 was the best news of the year economically.  At 5.6 per cent, the unemployment rate has not been lower for 22 years.  Low unemployment is the great human dividend from successful economic management.  Job security is crucial to human fulfilment and family stability.</p>
<p>Longer-term challenges must always be faced.  For example, the gradual ageing of our population will require, amongst other things, effective encouragement of greater workforce participation by older Australians and policies which maintain the affordability of high quality health care services.</p>
<p>And on the subject of health, I hope that when parliament resumes in February, the Senate will give speedy passage to the new Medicare Plus safety net which will provide greater security and peace of mind to Australian families who incur above average out-of-pocket expenses for out of hospital services.</p>
<p>Finally, I wish Steve Waugh every success as he leads Australia for the last time into the fourth cricket test on Friday.  Steve has made a tremendous contribution to Australian cricket and has set a fine example of gritty, determined and highly successful leadership of our team.</p>
<p>Janette and I wish all Australians a happy and rewarding 2004.</p>
