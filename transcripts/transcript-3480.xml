PROME BF33NISTER PRESS STATEMENT NO. 378<br />
22 November 1974<br />
Joint Statement by Mr E. G. Whitlam, Prime Minister,<br />
and Mr Bjelke-Petersen, Premier of Queensland<br />
GREAT BARRIER REEF PETROLEUM DRILLING ROYAL COIMISSIONS<br />
Mr Whitlam and Mr Bjelke-Petersen released today a<br />
summary of the Report of the Great Barrier Reef Petroleum Drilling<br />
Royal Commissions. The Report had previously been presented to the two<br />
Governments on 1 November; however, because of the length of the<br />
Report, 1100 pages, printed copies will not be available until<br />
December. Both Mr Whitlam and Mr Bjelke-Petersen agreed that in<br />
the interim it was in the public interest to make available a summary<br />
of the recommendations contained in the Report.<br />
They stressed that this was a summary only of what was<br />
a long and comprehensive report and that it should be read in this<br />
context; comments on the recommendations would be best delayed until<br />
they could be made on an informed basis, in the context of the whole<br />
Report, when it becomes available.<br />
A copy of the summary is attached.<br />

<p>GREAT BARRIER REEF PETROLEUM DRIILING ROYAL COMMISSIONS<br />
Background The Commission was appoin ted on 5 May 1970, and an<br />
identical Commission was issued by the Governor of Queensland on<br />
the same date. The three Commissioners were Sir Gordon Wallace<br />
( Chairman), Dr J. E. Smith of Ply mouth,. England, and Mr V. J. Moroney<br />
of Calgary, Canada.<br />
The Commission presented its Report to the Governor-General<br />
and to the Governor of Queensland on 1 November 1974. The Report<br />
is 1098 pages long and it will be early December before the Report<br />
is printed and copies become available.<br />
Following is a summary of the Commission's conclusions on<br />
its five terms of reference, Care should be exercised in using<br />
the summary in view of its abbreviated form in relation to the total<br />
size of the Report.<br />
The Commission examined the " Great Barrier Reef Province"<br />
( GBRP) which is the " Area" as defined in its terms of reference<br />
covering approximately 105,000 square miles. Within the Province<br />
is a reef zone whose total area is about 27,000 square miles.<br />
The total area of all reefs within the Province is between 4,300<br />
and 5,000 square miles.<br />
SUMMARY Term of Reference 1.<br />
Takin&amp; into account existing world technology in relation to<br />
drilling for petroleum and safety precautions relating thereto,<br />
what risk is there of an oil or gas leak in exploratory and<br />
production drilling for petroleum in the Area of the Great<br />
Barrier Reef?<br />
Conclusions In regard to blowouts, which occur through a combination of the<br />
presence of hydrocarbons with either equipment failuro or human<br />
failure or both, if petroleum drilling be permitted within the GBRP </p>

there will be and remain a real but small to very small risk<br />
of such occurrences. As to chronic pollution, if petroleum drilling be permitted<br />
within the GBRP it is almost certain that some measure of chronic<br />
spills would occur ranging from small to substantial.<br />
Term of Reference 2.<br />
What would be the probable effects of such an oil or gas<br />
leak and of the subsequent remedial measures on<br />
the coral reefs themselves;<br />
the coastline;<br />
the ecological and biological aspects of life<br />
in the area?<br />
Conclusions The Commissions' conclusions are reached on the basis of<br />
lengthy scientific evidence put before it on such subjects as the<br />
composition and properties of crude oils, their toxicities and the<br />
important changes in composition and toxicity which occur as the<br />
result of migration and weathering, and consideration of overseas<br />
spills, gas leaks and remedial measures.<br />
In regard to freshly spilled crude ' oil, the Commission<br />
concludes that its effects on corals and on the<br />
many different kinds of organisms living on or.<br />
associated with coral reefs, have not been<br />
sufficiently studied for the direct consequences<br />
of massive and-chronic spills to be predicted with<br />
any degree of confidence or for the indirect<br />
consequences to be predicted at all.<br />
( ii) As to weathered oil, the majority of the Commission<br />
( Dr Smith and Mr Moroney) are of the view that Oil<br />
which has been at sea in the area of the GBRP and<br />
subject to weathering for some 1-1i days will </p>
<p>probably be depleted of the toxic components originally<br />
present in the freshly spilt crude oil to the point where<br />
it is virtually non-toxic to marine organisms.<br />
The Chairman ( Sir Gordon Wallace) has a dissenting opinion.<br />
He concludes that there is inadequate scientific knowledge<br />
of possible damage of an indirect and long-term nature.<br />
On the basis of evidence given to the Commission, the<br />
Chairman considers that there is imprecision on the toxic<br />
qualities of spilt oil at the various stages of its<br />
weathering through migration and insufficient evidence to<br />
establish how long it takes for the oil to become non-toxic<br />
in the waters and climatic conditions of the GBRP and<br />
indeed whether it is completely harmless even when weathered.<br />
( iii) In regard to gas leaks the Commission concludes there is<br />
little hazard to the marine life of the GBRP save for<br />
possible limited and strictly localised effects.<br />
( iv) On the matter of remedial measures,, only two are considered<br />
to pose significant hazards to organisms of the GBRP, these<br />
being dispersants and sinking agents. The Commission states<br />
these should not be used except in few special circumstances.<br />
Term of Reference 3.<br />
Are there localities within the Area of the Great Barrier<br />
Reef and, if so, what are their geographical limits twherein<br />
the effects of an oil or gas leak would cause so ii le<br />
detriment that drilling there for petroleum might be permitted?<br />
Conclusions All members agree that drilling should not be permitted on<br />
any cay, island or reef or national park or marine park when<br />
declared. However, the majority ( Dr Smith and Mr Moroney) mire of the<br />
opinion that with certain designated buffer zones and subject to the<br />
adoption of the safety precautions ( including contingency planning) </p>
<p>recommended in the answer to Term of Reference 4 drilling could be<br />
permitted in designated areas. Dr Smith considers that areas at<br />
least fifteen miles east of the outer Barrier would also be permitted<br />
areas. Mr Moroney considers that permitted areas outside or seawards<br />
of the outer Barrier should be governed by relevant buffer zones.<br />
Areas where drilling should be excluded are also designated.<br />
Geographic specification of these areas is necessarily complex and<br />
details are provided in the full Report.<br />
The Chairman's view is that all drilling throughout the GBRP<br />
including the area east of and adjacent to the outer Barrier should<br />
be postponed and be planned and permitted only after the results are<br />
known of both the short and the long-term research recommended in<br />
the Report. He has added, that whilst recognising the force of his<br />
colleagues' views, he considers that of the various permitted drilling<br />
localities recommended by the majority, the Capricorn Channel by<br />
reason of its size and freedom from reefs, islands and cays would<br />
present the least risk of detriment to shores and ecosystems if an<br />
oil leak occurred therein provided a buffer zone of 30 miles were<br />
adopted.<br />
Term of Reference 4.<br />
if exploration or drilling for petroleum in any locality<br />
within the Area of the Great Barrier Reef is permitted,<br />
are existing safety precautions already prescribed or<br />
otherwise laid down for that locality regarded as<br />
adequate and, if not, what conditions should be imposed<br />
before such exploration or drilling could take place?<br />
Conclusions A number of recommendations, suggestions and conclusions are<br />
included in this section. The Commission concludes:<br />
there are no ' existing safety precautions ( already)<br />
prescribed or otherwise laid down" for any locality<br />
within the GBRP whilst certain draft regulations<br />
prepared by Australian and State authorities in 1969<br />
inadequately and insufficiently cover the subject of </p>
<p>safety precautions.<br />
amendments are required to the parallel legislation of<br />
the Australian and Queensland Governments of 1967 known<br />
as the Petroleum ( Submerged Lands) Acts.<br />
the drafting instructions for a common code of regulations<br />
compiled by Australian Government and State Authorities<br />
in 1969 are inadequate and require extensive review.<br />
its detailed recommendations are designed for the special<br />
conditions of the GBRP and are not in all cases intended<br />
to apply to the whole of the Australian Outer Continental<br />
Shelf.<br />
drilling should not be permitted in a marine or national<br />
park.<br />
Mf there must be fully co-ordinated Australian and State and<br />
Industry contingency plans before any drilling is<br />
permitted with appropriate stockpiling. An approved<br />
industry plan should be a condition precedent to the<br />
grant of permission to drill.<br />
in view of the high cost of remedial measures successful<br />
applicants must give appropriate assurance that they can<br />
meet any financial commitments involved.<br />
that human error has been invariably the sole or a major<br />
contributing cause of all blowouts.<br />
Term of Reference<br />
What are the probable benefits accruing to the State of<br />
Queensland and other parts of the Commonwealth from<br />
exploration or drilling for petroleum in the Area of the<br />
Great Barrier Reef and the extent of those benefits?<br />
Conclusions The Commission states that any answer imust of necessity be<br />
based on assumptions or hypotheses one of the principal ones being </p>
<p>that drilling would be commercially successful, and various degrees<br />
of success were assumed by the-economists who contributed to the<br />
expert evidence given to the Commission on this term of reference.<br />
The gross benefits will includeaddition<br />
to the national monetary wealth depending on the<br />
size of the discovered reservoirs, the cost of finding and<br />
the proportion of Australian ownership of the explorer and<br />
producer;<br />
lower prices to Australian consumers but this would depend<br />
on a number of contingencies;<br />
increased income tax the quantum of which appears from<br />
various tables compiled on different assumptions;<br />
royalties; self-sufficiency;<br />
industrial development, decentralisation and benefits from<br />
natural gas;<br />
increased technological and scientific knowledge.<br />
The potential disadvantages will beconsumption<br />
of irreplaceable resources;<br />
interference with the environment and its enjoyment by<br />
mankind;<br />
risk of damage to corals and other marine organisms and to<br />
birds; and<br />
hazards to the tourist industry.<br />
Neither the gross benefits nor the potential disadvantages can<br />
be quantified in the former case because of the varying assumptions<br />
which must be made and in the latter because research and experiments<br />
must be carried out before scientific knowledge will be qualified to<br />
assess the effects of oil on corals and other marine life in the GBRP. </p>
