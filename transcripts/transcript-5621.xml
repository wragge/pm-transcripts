EMBARC3ED: 5, OOPM<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA SUNDAY, 19 JULY 1981<br />
ELECTORATE TALK<br />
The gover-r~ ent's economic programme is designed to bring about<br />
stable, non-inflationary growth. And the success of this<br />
programme is now recognised around the world. The economy<br />
is buoyant. Prospects for employment are improving. Unemployment<br />
was down ' by 53,000 in the last year, and the June unernDloymentp<br />
rate was the lowest for four years. It is particularly<br />
heartening that there has been a substantial fall inurferployment amongst<br />
young people. The number of young people under 19 now unemployed<br />
is the lowest for several years. Private business investment<br />
is growing strongly.<br />
There is confidnece in Australia, and our prospects for the<br />
future are extremely heartening. The OECD expects the Australian<br />
economy to grow more rapidly than that of any other member country<br />
-i~ l98ahdal~ on~ I82~ I~ preict ~ grwthrate of over<br />
for both those years. But there are also dangers inour<br />
present situation, and it is the responsibility of us all to<br />
make sure that we do not throw away the great opportunities<br />
which now lie before us. In the last few weeks disruption and<br />
strike activities have caused great and unwarranted inconvenience<br />
to the community. And the selfish wage push by militant unionsV<br />
can threaten economic prospects in this country. In particular,<br />
there is danger that wage rises will renew inflation, which<br />
remains the single greatest threat to improved living standards<br />
throughout Australia. There is a clear need for restraint by<br />
all sections of the community to restrain inflation, for the<br />
success of our policies in producing economic growth is already<br />
producing inflationary pressures. If the amount that we<br />
produce as a nation goes up by three per cent, four per cent or<br />
five per cent in year, and we try to get wage increases of<br />
ten or fifteen per cent or more each year, it is inevitable that<br />
costs and prices will go up, and we will be back on the inflation<br />
merrygoround. Excessive wage rises damage us all.<br />
The prosperity currently being achieved in Austrlaia is welcome<br />
and gratifying. It is a tribute to the sound economic policies<br />
that this Government has pursued. However, it must not be taken<br />
for granted. One indispensable element in combatting inflation<br />
is co-operation. Increasing overall prosperity depends on<br />
the actions of millions of individual Australians and their I<br />
willingness to put aside personal short-term gains for more </p>
<p>-2-<br />
important, long-term goals. The pursuit of excessive wage<br />
demands can only hinder consistent economic recovery. The<br />
benefits of the'economic growth now occurring in this country<br />
' must be shared by all Australians, and not be allowed simply to<br />
fall into the hands of militant unions.<br />
The Government cannot force people to be responsible. It cannot<br />
do away with the selfishness of militant unions trying to grab<br />
the benefits of prosperity for their own members at the expense<br />
of the rest of the community. The Government. will do everything<br />
that it can to protect the interests of the community as a<br />
whole, arnd to encourage the kind of climate in which reasonable<br />
solutions can be achieved. But there is a vast need for a<br />
sense of -responsibility in this area that is shared by all<br />
Australians. Last Friday, after a special meeting of representatives of<br />
Government, t he ACTU and employer groups, the President of the<br />
Arbitration Cum ission announced a review of the wage fixation<br />
principles, and called for a preliminary hearing next Wednesday<br />
of the national wage case for it to consider procedural-matters<br />
and to fix a timetable. The Government welcomes this initiative<br />
from the Arbit-ration Commission, and believes that this<br />
approach can be of benefit so far as the operation of the<br />
wage guidelines is concerned. It provides an opportunity which<br />
nobody can afford to let slip.<br />
The Government believes that all industrial-actionmustbe<br />
called off during the course of the proceedings. Unless the<br />
damaging industrial disruption that has been all too common in<br />
recent times is stopped the potential provided by this initiative<br />
for more stable industrial relations cannot possibly be fulfilled.<br />
All Australians will feel the consequences of a failure to make:<br />
the-most of this opportunity. But I believe that if we work<br />
together, the prosperity of Australia will be increasingly<br />
shared by all Australians. </p>
