    <content><![CDATA[<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER THERESA MAY: </strong></p>
<p>Well, Malcolm, it's very good to welcome you here to Chequers after obviously quite an intense week of CHOGM activity. Both Lucy and you were able to come over for that meeting. After, of course Australia has hosted a fantastic Commonwealth Games. Congratulations to all of your Australian athletes. Top of the table.</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER MALCOLM TURNBULL: </strong></p>
<p>And to yours!</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER MAY: </strong></p>
<p>Well I was going to say, I think there's a renewed interest in girls netball as a result of what we’ve seen.</p>
<p>It was very good. And it was very good to see the Commonwealth family both in that sporting sense and the leaders coming together for CHOGM. But it is good to have an opportunity to talk with you about our mutual interests, longstanding of course, with our ties.</p>
<p>There is much for us to look ahead to, as well, as we look at some of the ways, some of the challenges we face in today’s world. Some of which we talked about in the last couple of days, security and defence, cybersecurity particularly. But also in trade, the pressure you now see on protectionism exerted across the world. I think, [indistinct] establishing a better trade relationship is part of that as well. So looking forward to our discussions.</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER TURNBULL: </strong></p>
<p>Thank you so much and thank you for your hospitality today and for really an outstanding CHOGM, thank you so much, and we both thank, together with all of the other leaders, Her Majesty the Queen, for opening her homes. It was a very successful meeting and full credit to the host.</p>
<p>We've had very good discussions about cyber security, about national security issues and we'll return to these today. Trade is clearly very high on your agenda as it always is on ours. Trade means jobs.</p>
<p>We're having record jobs in Australia, Theresa, and it is in no small part due to the opening up of new markets and greater trade opportunities. That's why we persevered with the Trans-Pacific Partnership, got that signed despite the US dropping out, and pleased to see your government's interest in potentially joining that at a future date when you have left the European Union.</p>
<p>So there's so much to discuss. We've got so much in common. We've known each other, in fact the four of us, Lucy and Phillip and you and I have known each other for about 40 years now.</p>
<p>So we go back a long way, it would be good to chat on a few reminiscences from our student days and also focus, above all, on the challenges of the future: security, a strong economy, trade and the rule of law. In many respects as we were discussing the other day. The big challenge in so many areas whether it is chemical weapons, whether it is in the threat of terrorism, cyber security - see so many challenges to the rule of law, the maintenance which, is essential to not just our security and our prosperity. So thank you. </p>
