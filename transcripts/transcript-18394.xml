Nineteen forty-two was the darkest year in Australia's history.</p>
<p>And if that darkest year had a darkest day, it was February 19.</p>
<p>It was the unimaginable day.</p>
<p>Beginning a series of raids around Northern Australia that together marked the first time our land has been attacked in war.</p>
<p>In two waves, 242 Japanese planes appeared in the air over this small but strategic township.</p>
<p>A young sailor Harry Dale said: âThey all glistened silver in the sun, like they were painted with silver frost.â</p>
<p>But those planes brought only destruction from the bright skies.</p>
<p>Our distance from the hatreds of old Europe was no longer a protection.</p>
<p>Our peacetime complacency had become a potent setback in war.</p>
<p>Admittedly there had been some preparations but they were not enough.</p>
<p>Darwin ended the complacency.</p>
<p>This was the Battle for Australia.</p>
<p>The battle of every citizen for our nation's survival.</p>
<p>This was a fight for home and country.</p>
<p>For all we loved and held dear.</p>
<p>That would touch every family and every home.</p>
<p>Yet even as the bombs fell, fate was ordaining our response in the jungles of New Guinea.</p>
<p>So within months, the Japanese advance had been halted and the certainty of their defeat assured.</p>
<p>Less certain was our future friendship with Japan. But today that too is assured.</p>
<p>As the Allies surged north, Darwin remained a military post busy with troops and supplies.</p>
<p>And when peace came, residents returned to a broken town that took years to rebuild, only to be struck by another foe from the north, Cyclone Tracy.</p>
<p>The strength and resilience of Territorians is foremost in our hearts today.</p>
<p>Their dignity in the face of adversity will never be forgotten.</p>
<p>The bombing of this city was a terrible day in a terrible war.</p>
<p>A disaster tinged with defiance.</p>
<p>Like Gallipoli, it was an early set-back that spurred the nation to ultimate victory.</p>
<p>Territorians have always known it.</p>
<p>And we have made this a national commemoration so that the whole country will know it too.</p>
<p>This day is inscribed in the story of our nation forever.</p>
<p>Reminding us how precious is the freedom we enjoy.</p>
<p>How high a price has been paid to preserve it.</p>
<p>And how we must never, ever forget. </p>
