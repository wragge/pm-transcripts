MEDICAL AID TO VIET-NAM<br />
The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr E. G. Whitlan, announced<br />
today that the Australian medical aid programme in Viet-Nam is to change<br />
its emphasis from " patient care" aid to the fields of public health and<br />
medical training. Mr Whitlam said that the revised programme follows a major review<br />
of Australian medical aid to Viet-Nam. As part of this review a team of<br />
three doctors led by Sir William Refshauge, the Director-General of<br />
Health, visited Viet-Nam in November 1971. The team included a senior<br />
Adelaide surgeon and former leader of two surgical teams in Viet-Nam,<br />
Mr Mervyn Smith, and Dr J. Boxall, of the Department of Health. The new<br />
programme is based on the review team's recommendations.<br />
Mr Whitlam said that as part of the change, arrangements have now<br />
been made for the Australian Surgical Team at Bien Hoa to be withdrawn at<br />
the end of December. Since 1964 " patient care" aid has formed a major part<br />
of the Australian medical aid programme in Viet-Nam comprising for the<br />
most part surgical teams attached to selected provincial hospitals. In<br />
1968, at the peak of the programme, 4+ 6 Australian doctors, nurses and<br />
support staff treated approximately 59,000 patients and performed over<br />
10,000 operations in four provincial hospitals. During the patient care<br />
programme nearly 500 doctors, nurses and support staff recruited from all<br />
Australian states served in Viet-Nam. </p>
<p>Mr Whitlam said he wished to draw attention to the valuable assistance<br />
provided by state medical authorities, the Repatriation Department and major<br />
city hospitals in forming surgical teams.<br />
The phasing out of the final surgical team at Bien Hoa will coincide<br />
with the completion of a major re-building project at the Bien Hoa hospital<br />
carried out under the medical aid programme at a cost of $ 1,450,000. The<br />
new medical assistance programme has already taken shape and Australia is<br />
constructing a prophylactic and diagnostic clinic in Saigon at an estimated<br />
cost of $ 250,000. This community health clinic will provide normal outpatient<br />
facilities, dispensary, a small laboratory, X-ray facilities, minor<br />
operating room and a maternity wing. The building is expected to be<br />
completed by April.<br />
In addition to the public health clinic project, medical training<br />
programmes for Vietnamese civil medical teachers and public health staff are<br />
being planned. These courses will be held in Australia and Viet-Nam. Already,<br />
at the request of the Vietnamese authorities, a senior Australian surgeon is<br />
undertaking a training programme for medical teaching staff at the Cho Ray<br />
teaching hospital in Saigon. Further training assistance within Viet-Nam<br />
is planned for doctors in the fields of X-ray diagnosis, E. N. T. surgery and<br />
public health administration.<br />
