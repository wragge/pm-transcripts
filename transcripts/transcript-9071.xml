SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON PJ. KEAT1NG, MP<br />
LAUNCH OF THE INTERNATIONAL YEAR OF THE FAMILY<br />
BANKSTOWN, 6 DECEMBER 1993<br />
I am delighted to be here today to launch the International Year of the Family in<br />
Australia. For me, families matter.<br />
Indeed, I am sure that we are all here because we think the same way on this.<br />
Because of the importance of families to all of us as individuals.<br />
Because of the importance of families to our communities.<br />
Because we think families are a national resource vital to the future of this country.<br />
And because we want everyone to be aware of it.<br />
Wc want everyone to know the value of families.<br />
And when we speak of the value of families, we speak of the value of all families.<br />
We recognise that families have their own unique needs, and that the Government has<br />
a special role to assist them.<br />
We have implemented and will continue to put into place measures to help families.<br />
But one thing is certain.<br />
Families are endlessly diverse in shape and structure.<br />
It is appropriate then, that Government programs continue to recognise this diversity<br />
of family forms in Australia, and meet their different, but equally legitimate, needs. </p>
<p>TEL: 8. Dec. 93 14: 52 No. 011 P. 02<br />

As I have said before, when we talk about families today, we are talking about<br />
families of all sorts and sizes.<br />
Families with children where both parents are present.<br />
Families with children headed by sole parents women or mcen.<br />
Failies that include several generations living under the same roof.<br />
Families Where one member cares for another who is frail aged, chronically ill, or<br />
disabled. And any number of other combinations which complete the Australian national<br />
family. Just now the biggest problem facing many familics is unemployment.<br />
It is the dominant economic and social issue of our times.<br />
We know only too well what the consequences of unemployment are particularly<br />
long term unemployment on individuals, on children, on families, on communities,<br />
on the social fabric.<br />
That is why we have commissioned a Discussion Paper on Unemrploymnent, which we<br />
will receive next week a major report on the dimensions of the problem and how to<br />
deal with it.<br />
Following our consideration of it, the Government will release a White Paper on<br />
employment next year the first since the end of World War 11.<br />
Among other considerations, our response to the report will recognise that, although<br />
all families are vulnerable to unemployment, some are more vulnerable than others.<br />
There is no gctting away from the fact that unemployment affects families in different<br />
ways, and that for solutions to be effective they must take the differences into<br />
account. Our policies must address the diverse nature of Australian families, and the diverse<br />
nature or their employment and assistance needs.<br />
A major issue to address in this context is how families balance the responsibilities of<br />
work and family life.<br />
Governments should, T believe, promotc policies which recognise and support choices<br />
families are makting in combining paid work and family care.<br />
We have to make these aspects of peoples' lives fit more harmoniously together.<br />
We have to keep pressing for more " family-friendly" workplaces. </p>
<p>TEL: 8. Dec. 93 14: 52 No. 011 P. 03<br />

And child care.<br />
This Government is very proud of it's record in the creation of childcare places.<br />
It is proud of the system of fee relief it has introduced and its needs based planning.<br />
The child care rebate, to be provided next year, is anothcr important plank in our<br />
child carc policy.<br />
It is a long overdue recognition of the cost of child care for families in earning an<br />
income. We recognise that childcare needs are neither uniform or identical.<br />
We recognise that women, throughout their lives, have a range of equally legitimate<br />
choices about being in the workforce or being at home.<br />
We appreciate the value of caring and nurturing provided by women who do choose<br />
to stay at borne while their children are growing up, and the value of the unpaid work<br />
they carry out both in the household and in the community.<br />
That is why we have introduced the Home Care Child Allowance for supporting<br />
parents caring for their children full time at home.<br />
By paying the allowane directly to the caring parent, usually the mother, we have<br />
provided many women at home with a source of independent income which otherwise<br />
they would not have.<br />
Perhaps I could summarise the Government's support for families by saying simply<br />
that we are about recognising diversity and facilitating choice,<br />
And this, I believe, siL% well with the objectives of the International Year of the<br />
Family. Some people, I know, get a bit cynical about International Years, and about their<br />
usefulness. I am not one of them.<br />
I support the concept of International Years on the basis or their results.<br />
Because of the benefits that conmc from them.<br />
These benefits don't necessarily come overnight.<br />
Some of themi don't conmc nearly quickly enough for everyone. </p>
<p>TEL 4<br />
But they do come, and they come, in part, because of the change in attitudes which<br />
the International Years bring about.<br />
Few would deny that there has been substantial progress in what women have<br />
achieved since the International Year for Women in 1975.<br />
And equally few would deny the impetus which the Year had on legislators, not least<br />
here in Australia.<br />
Similarly, the International Year of the Disabled marked a turning point in the way in<br />
which socicty viewed people with disabilities.<br />
There is now a much greater sensitivity towards their needs, and it's reflected in<br />
evciything from building codes to co-ordinated hospital and community services.<br />
This Year is the Year for the World's Indigenous People, a year we have marked<br />
indelibly in Australia's history with landmark legislation which will put an end to an<br />
historic lie and go some way to laying the basis of real justice for indigenous<br />
Australians. Legislation which will go a long way towards extending the Australian family by<br />
granting basic rights to peoplc who have long been denied them.<br />
In addition to individual achievements, the cumulative aspect of International Years<br />
has, I believe, also been very important.<br />
We might well have been able to have an International Year or the Family without<br />
any previous International Years.<br />
But I strongly doubt whecther the Year would have the focus intended for it, would<br />
explore the crucial range of issues that it plans to address, without the previous<br />
International Years to which I have just referred.<br />
They have brought about a fundamental shift in the way we think about families.<br />
And now the National Council for the International Year of the family will be<br />
building on these paist achievements.<br />
The Council, which the Government has established, is chaired by Professor Bcttina<br />
Cass and comprises a number of Australians who are eminent in their fields.<br />
Before the International Year of the Family came along, the members of the Council<br />
were already busy people in their own area of work.<br />
I realise that the members are giving up scarce time to serve on this Council, and I am<br />
pleased to place on record my appreciation for their important act of public service.<br />
This year won't simply be about celebrating families, although there is much worthy<br />
or celebration. T8EL.: D ec. 93 14: 52 NO. 011 P. 04 </p>
<p>TEL:<br />
Rather, the International Year of the Family is an opportunity to take stock of the<br />
types of support and services that Government and non-Governmnent organisations<br />
provide r famfilies.<br />
To see how we can do things better.<br />
T'he Government, together with the Council, will be looking to strengthen the<br />
partnerships between families, governments, education and community services,<br />
business, unions, religious organisations and community groups.<br />
Ultimately out of our work wc hope will come the basis for family policy for the<br />
future an Australian Agenda for Families.<br />
Ladics and Gentlemen<br />
The International Year of the family affects us all.<br />
While the style of familics has changed, one thing should not change and that is the<br />
binding and the support that members of families should provide to one another.<br />
Children particularly benefit from having the support of loving and interested<br />
partents. Support and esteem which stays with them throughout their life.<br />
We have, perhaps, become too blase as a society about the obligations of' parents to<br />
their children about the need to consider them in our life choices.<br />
We will succeed better as a society when parents have a strong and continuing<br />
involvement with their childrens' lives and their emotional development.<br />
Families are all important in determining how children develop into adults and form<br />
their own families. They are crucial to our development as productive and fulfilled<br />
members of a wider society.<br />
Ultimately it is the family which provides any individual with his or her most<br />
essential need the need to belong. This is at the heart of our responsibility to<br />
support families, and at the heart of a family's responsibility to support its members.<br />
Cherishing and supporting the family, all our families, is the most important<br />
commitment we can make to future generations in a just, decent and humane society.<br />
As the Christmas holiday season approaches, our thoughts of family come particularly<br />
to the fore.<br />
Let me conclude then with an illustration of the importance of family from Evonne<br />
Goologong Cawlcy's recent autobiography. T8E. LD: ec. 93 14: 52 NO. 011 </p>

Shc relates how the family car broke down on Christmas Eve on a back road far from<br />
anywhere. In her words, " Mum and Dad helped us tear paper into strips and we decorated a little<br />
scrubby tree.<br />
Then we sat around it on our tarpaulin and sang Christmas carols.<br />
Silent Night was Mum's favourite, so we sang that twice.<br />
I can't have been very old but I have a clear memory of drifting into sleep that night,<br />
my head in my father's lap and catching a glimpse or both my parents in the<br />
moonlight. They wcrc a good looking couple and they loved us.<br />
We might have been stuck on a back road in Western New South Wales on Christmas<br />
Eve, but wc were the luckiest kids in the world."<br />
In these rew words, Evonnc has captured the enduring feelings of love, acceptance<br />
and commitment values we all seek and cherish in our family lives.<br />
It gives me great pleasure to launch the International Year of the Family.<br />
