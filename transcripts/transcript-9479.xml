PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING MP<br />
DOORSTOP, PERTH, WA, WEDNESDAY, 15 FEBRUARY 1995<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
J: What brings you to Perth, Prime Minister?<br />
PM: What brings an Australian Prime Minister anywhere in Australia? The<br />
responsibilities of the Prime Ministership, of course.<br />
J: You have been under a bit of stick though for not coming here often<br />
enough.<br />
PM: I was coming in August as you know, I got a bout of<br />
the east it's basically two days and I come here as<br />
South Australia or Tasmania. the flu, but from<br />
often as I go to<br />
J: Are there any plans yet to meet Premier Court?<br />
PM: I don't think he is serious about all of that is he?<br />
J: He's been a bit miffed<br />
PM: I'm sure he is.<br />
J: But, you didn't tell him you were coming?<br />
PM: He knew, in fact we invited him to the launching of the REDO the<br />
Regional Economic Development Organisation so he must have<br />
known I was coming because Hendy Cowan was coming and he sent<br />
his apologies, but Hendy is a nice fellow, he did the show. So, he did<br />
know I was coming weeks ago.<br />
J: Do you take the polls seriously, the polls that show you are so<br />
unpopular in Western Australia? 7 F, </p>
<p>PM: Well, part of that is the sort of within Parliament ethos of governments<br />
and they are always polls are up and polls are down, there is only<br />
one poll that matters the big one.<br />
J: But the fact that you are touring the marginal electorates obviously<br />
highlights that doesn't it?<br />
PM: Well, I, probably hope it should.<br />
J: Do you accept that your popularity is different here than it is in the<br />
east?<br />
PM: Well, it could be but, you know, we did reasonably well in West<br />
Australia in the last one. Now look, let me make this point. In this<br />
Government I have been the Treasurer and the Prime Minister, most of<br />
the things that I have been associated with have been in favour of the<br />
primary exporting states. The big claim of Western Australia for<br />
years was to take the tariff monkey off West Australia's back and I was<br />
one of the principal people involved in that. I gave a statistic which I<br />
thought was pretty compelling at the last function today saying<br />
Australia's competitiveness is 40 per cent improved since John<br />
Howard was the Treasurer. That is why the ship building is working,<br />
that is why we have just saw a specialised steel facility in the aircraft<br />
industry Western Aerospace working, it is because of<br />
competitiveness. That comes by the exchange rate, inflation, wages<br />
and productivity. That is why Western Australia is growing faster than<br />
or as fast as any other State, faster than most in Australia because of<br />
the policies of the Federal Government. And so, that being the case<br />
and where we have had tremendous employment growth, why wouldn't<br />
the Federal Government be doing well in Western Australia? Why<br />
shouldn't it be doing well? I mean, if our policies are principally<br />
responsible and they are for Western Australia's economic strength,<br />
why shouldn't we be doing well?<br />
J: Do you think West Australian's understand that?<br />
PM: Well, maybe not everybody does understand it as well, but let me<br />
assure them that the things that matter the exchange rate, interest<br />
rates, inflation, wages, all of that structure which underpins this growth<br />
economy comes from the Federal Government policies. I mean, you<br />
know we have got new industries developing, the one I was at this<br />
afternoon making alloys for aircraft engines. Could you imagine that<br />
years ago? Really, it is there because of the Federal Government<br />
policies. So, I think that people are starting to understand that a<br />
sophisticated manufacturing, a sophisticated service sector, greater<br />
strength of traditional industries like mining and agriculture come from<br />
the Federal Government policies. </p>
<p>J: But, Do you understand the struggle you've got knowing that you have<br />
got a Premier in WA who is belting you across the head at every<br />
opportunity?<br />
PM: Well, I mean, people put a bit of discount through all that stuff. The<br />
public are very smart.<br />
J: He put up petrol 4 cents a couple of weeks ago and basically blamed<br />
the Federal Government.<br />
PM: Well, if you are silly enough to believe that you will believe anything<br />
won't you?<br />
J: Well, I'm not.<br />
PM: Well you're not? Well, that's good. I mean you are answering your<br />
own questions.<br />
J: The West had a poll ( The West Australian newspaper) saying that..<br />
per cent of the public thought that the Federal Government, not the<br />
State Government put up petrol.<br />
PM: Richard Court put the petrol prices up for no other reason than he<br />
wanted the money for his revenue. Nothing to do with the<br />
Commonwealth and the story that in some way we have diminished<br />
Commonwealth road payments is completely untrue. The underlying<br />
payments have been growing.<br />
J: The Western Australian Premiers have bashed Prime Ministers<br />
forever, but he seems to have made an art form out of it. Has it<br />
affected ( inaudible)..<br />
PM: Well, I don't know, he hasn't quite got it perfected, I know his father,<br />
the old story about lightning not striking the same place twice, Charlie<br />
used to say ' Western Australia", he hasn't got that part of it right yet. I<br />
mean, he has got the rest of the bits, you know, it is all Canberra and<br />
they are fighting the centralists, but he needs to go around to Charlie<br />
for some lessons in ' Western Australia", because Charlie used to get<br />
that whoosh to the word.<br />
J: The Head of the Native Title Tribunal has said that there are moral<br />
shortcomings in the principles by which native title is recognised in<br />
a ruling yesterday.<br />
PM: I haven't seen the ruling, but what the High Court said that Aboriginal<br />
custom and tradition was a source of Australian common law. What<br />
the Commonwealth has fleshed out is a major piece of property and<br />
cultural law in the Native Title Act. It will take a while for teething<br />
problems to see it into place. The place it's not in place is Western<br />
Australia because the Western Australian government is wilfully going </p>
<p>against the rest of the nation. Richard Court's government is doing<br />
what the government of Queensland isn't doing, the government of<br />
New South Wales isn't doing, the government of Victoria isn't doing,<br />
the government of Tasmania isn't doing, the government of South<br />
Australia and the Commonwealth. That is, trying to go it alone in a<br />
very unfair policy and one which I think is going to be very disruptive<br />
for business in Western Australia.<br />
J: Do you have any plans at all to alter your native title legislation?<br />
PM: No, but we have said that in terms of any review we might have down<br />
the track coming from some of the case law, we would look at it but not<br />
to its principle.<br />
J: Would the cuts be as savage as Mr Howard is trying to make out?<br />
PM: Well, Mr Howard doesn't believe in, all the variables in economic<br />
management interest rates, revenue and cutting spending he<br />
doesn't believe in any of those things he said, there should be no<br />
increase in interest rates, there should be no change in revenue and<br />
we shouldn't cut spending. This is the same fellow that wants to be<br />
taken seriously as somebody who can put a national budget together.<br />
Now, Mr Howard is a lucky fellow, he has been given a second go.<br />
You see Andrew ( Peacock) got a second go, he wanted a second go.<br />
Now, he has got the second go, but you think he would stick to a few<br />
principles and one of the principles should be what is best for the<br />
nations budget is best for the nation, obviously, and that he should<br />
help rather than hinder the processes of budget preparation.<br />
J: Prime Minister ( inaudible)..<br />
PM: I'm quite sure, I said yesterday, that when the Government presents its<br />
budget a lot of people in the Liberal party who have supposedly this<br />
list will say oh, we wimped out: " the Labor government has wimped out<br />
because we haven't taken the savage options". So, this week we are<br />
taking the savage options, when the budget comes out they'll say ' ah<br />
ha, you never took the savage options'.<br />
J: Which one are you going to choose?<br />
PM: Well, wait and see.<br />
J: Prime Minister, what do you say to the people in West Australia who<br />
are deeply concerned about what is happening to our forests in the<br />
South West?<br />
PM: What I want is, I think, what most Australians want and that is the most<br />
important pristine stands of trees to be saved for our heritage and our<br />
posterity, yet at the same time, the capacity to have a sustainable<br />
timber industry and getting that balance right is what it is all about. </p>
<p>That balance will not be struck properly when you have got Wilderness<br />
Society people at one side saying every group of trees are pristine<br />
when it is not true or the timber industry people on the other side<br />
getting the chain saw out too. There is a policy down the middle and<br />
the only party at this stage following the middle course which will look<br />
after both those imperatives is the Federal government.<br />
ends </p>
