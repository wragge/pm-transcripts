<p>Well thank you very much Peter, to your wife Carol, to my Federal</p>
<p>   Parliamentary colleagues, Senator Synon, to John Richardson and</p>
<p>   my other State Parliamentary colleagues, ladies and gentlemen.</p>
<p>There seems, at the moment in politics, to be a little bit of discussion</p>
<p>   about nostalgia and about going back, and I have to say that no</p>
<p>   one group in Australian politics, of course, has a mortgage on nostalgia</p>
<p>   and being warmly reminded of one's roots. And I don't</p>
<p>   think in a political sense there's anything quite so warmly</p>
<p>   nostalgic about coming to a Liberal Party function in Victoria and</p>
<p>   being introduced behind a pipe band given the great Scottish affections</p>
<p>   and ancestry of the founder of our Party and the longest serving</p>
<p>   Prime Minister in Australia's history, Sir Robert Menzies.</p>
<p>I am very happy to be back in the electorate of Aston, Peter, and</p>
<p>   I will, of course, never return in any of my former guises to this</p>
<p>   electorate having visited it on three occasions in different guises.</p>
<p>   And you are absolutely right and you show an appropriate degree</p>
<p>   of political emphasis and political skill in mentioning the fact</p>
<p>   that this electorate does have the largest number of mortgage-ors</p>
<p>   in Australia on a per capita basis. And I will complete that by</p>
<p>   saying, of course, that the message for them is that my Government</p>
<p>   has delivered the lowest housing interest rates for 30 years and</p>
<p>   that's a message that will be repeated during the course of</p>
<p>   the next few weeks, the next few months and indeed until some date</p>
<p>   between now and when the election is due, which constitutionally</p>
<p>   of course is about late May of next year, that's the latest</p>
<p>   date. Now, I'm not, for the benefit of the press who are travelling</p>
<p>   with me or indeed, and I don't mean this unkindly for anybody</p>
<p>   else's benefit about to muse aloud about when the election</p>
<p>   might be held. That is something that all Prime Ministers decide</p>
<p>   at the right time and in the right circumstances after talking to</p>
<p>   their senior colleagues. But I do want to share with you a few thoughts</p>
<p>   about where Australia has some from and where we are going and some</p>
<p>   of the political challenges on the horizon at the present time.</p>
<p>We've had in Melbourne over the last few days a very important</p>
<p>   conference dealing with Australia's trade relationships with</p>
<p>   the rest of the world. We've had a number of very well reported</p>
<p>   speeches, one or two of them from some of our visitors, I think,</p>
<p>   have been unduly pessimistic. I don't believe it is often particularly</p>
<p>   helpful for some visitors to this country to use words like Â‘depression'</p>
<p>   and to throw them around rather carelessly particularly given some</p>
<p>   of the economic difficulties of our friends in the Asia-Pacific</p>
<p>   region. But there is little doubt that the Asia-Pacific region is</p>
<p>   going through its worst economic experience in the last 30 or 40</p>
<p>   years. But it's also very important to keep the circumstances</p>
<p>   of what is happening in the Asia-Pacific region in a very clear</p>
<p>   perspective. </p>
<p>And let me illustrate by referring to a country like Indonesia.</p>
<p>   Everyone knows that Indonesia's gone through a very difficult</p>
<p>   time and there are many difficult months ahead for that country.</p>
<p>   It has not only gone through difficult times economically but also</p>
<p>   politically and there's been a change of leadership from President</p>
<p>   Soeharto to the new President Dr Habibie. But even when you take</p>
<p>   all that into account, the living standards of Indonesian people,</p>
<p>   despite all of the downturn and all of the meltdown and all of the</p>
<p>   loss of wealth, the living standards of the Indonesian people now</p>
<p>   are dramatically higher than what they were at the beginning of</p>
<p>   the 1990s.</p>
<p>So therefore what we have to do is to keep in perspective what</p>
<p>   is occurring in our part of the world. The other thing that we should</p>
<p>   remember, of course, is how Australia is effected by what is happening</p>
<p>   in our region. Now it is quite impossible for Australia not to be</p>
<p>   effected by what is occurring in our region. We now sell 34 per</p>
<p>   cent of all of our exports to two countries alone - that's</p>
<p>   Japan and Korea. Those two countries are far and away our most important</p>
<p>   destinations for the goods that we sell abroad and inevitably because</p>
<p>   of those linkages and linkages with other parts of the Asian region</p>
<p>   we are going to be effected by a downturn in those countries. But</p>
<p>   the reality is that we have not been effected nearly as badly as</p>
<p>   we might have been and the reason for that, quite unmistakably,</p>
<p>   is that when our Government took office we set about getting Australia's</p>
<p>   economic house in order, and I am defiantly proud of what my Government</p>
<p>   has done over the past two-and-a-quarter years. Peter Costello as</p>
<p>   Treasurer supported by all of the other Ministers having responsibility</p>
<p>   for economic management has done an absolutely superb job in turning</p>
<p>   around Australia's finances.</p>
<p>Now, I know that there are some of the decisions that we have taken</p>
<p>   that some in the community haven't liked, and I am sure there</p>
<p>   are a number of people here tonight who personally haven't</p>
<p>   liked some of the decisions that we have taken. I know that, I have</p>
<p>   been in politics a very long time and I know that occasionally you</p>
<p>   take decisions that adversely affect people who are even your loyalist</p>
<p>   supporters. I know that, I am conscious of that. I know that some</p>
<p>   of the decisions we took in relation to such issues as superannuation</p>
<p>   a couple of years ago caused a deal of heartburning amongst some</p>
<p>   of our own supporters. I also know that some of the decisions we</p>
<p>   took in other areas affected people who were not necessarily our</p>
<p>   supporters.</p>
<p>But that is not the point of who somebody affected by a decision</p>
<p>   supports, it's a question of what the end product of all of</p>
<p>   those decisions are, and the end product of all of the decisions</p>
<p>   we have taken is that we have turned a Budget deficit of $10.5 billion</p>
<p>   a year into a surplus of $2.7 billion. We have produced the lowest</p>
<p>   interest rates in 30 years. We have the prospect of starting the</p>
<p>   21st Century with virtually no Federal Government debt and when</p>
<p>   you consider that in 1995 the Federal Government debt, the GDP ratio,</p>
<p>   was about 20 per cent, that is a remarkable turnaround. We have</p>
<p>   the lowest inflation rate in the OECD area and we have in prospect,</p>
<p>   despite the difficulties of our region, some of the highest growth</p>
<p>   rates amongst the industrialised countries for 1998 and 1999. </p>
<p>Now the net result of all of that is that we have given to the</p>
<p>   Australian economy a degree of protection from what has happened</p>
<p>   in Asia that would simply not have been there if we had not been</p>
<p>   elected and would not have been there if we had listened to the</p>
<p>   advice we received from our opponents in the Labor Party and the</p>
<p>   Australian Democrats. Because one of the galling things about the</p>
<p>   Labor Opposition is that not only did they create the problem we</p>
<p>   were given the responsibility of fixing up, but at every step of</p>
<p>   the way they have tried to prevent us fixing the problem. It's</p>
<p>   one thing to create a difficulty and then hand it over to somebody</p>
<p>   else and say: we'll give you two or three years to fix it up.</p>
<p>   It's entirely another thing to create the problem, hand it</p>
<p>   over to somebody else and go about trying to stop the other crowd</p>
<p>   fixing the problem in the time that they are in Government. Because</p>
<p>   all of the attempts virtually we made to reduce the budget deficit</p>
<p>   and to get our economic house in order were obstructed by the Australian</p>
<p>   Labor Party and others in the Senate. We were able, through a combination</p>
<p>   of circumstances, to get most of those budget measures through.</p>
<p>   But it oughtn't to be forgotten now that Australia faces this</p>
<p>   great economic difficulty in Asia that not only did my Government,</p>
<p>   the Coalition Government, set about building the strongest economic</p>
<p>   foundations that Australia has had in 25 years but we did it in</p>
<p>   the face of the strongest possible opposition from our opponents.</p>
<p>The truth is that if we hadn't have done what we have done</p>
<p>   over the last two-and-a- quarter years Australia now would be weaker,</p>
<p>   more vulnerable, more exposed, our living standards more at risk</p>
<p>   and overseas confidence in the strength of the Australian economy</p>
<p>   greatly reduced. So what we have done over that period of time has</p>
<p>   been to build those very strong foundations and the reality is,</p>
<p>   my friends, that there are more things that must be done. I know</p>
<p>   that there are many in the community who are somewhat weary with</p>
<p>   economic and social change. I understand that. Peter mentioned a</p>
<p>   moment ago what happened in Queensland last weekend. </p>
<p>Most of what happened in Queensland last weekend, not all of it,</p>
<p>   but most of it is due to the fact there are Australians who feel</p>
<p>   a sense of vulnerability because of the economic and social change</p>
<p>   that has occurred in our nation over the last few years. I understand</p>
<p>   that. I sympathise with, and I regard the great bulk of those people</p>
<p>   who feel that way as like the rest of us - ordinary decent Australians</p>
<p>   who are concerned about their future and the future of their families.</p>
<p>   But of course there are ways of securing your future, that will</p>
<p>   secure your future. There are other ways which I'll come to</p>
<p>   in a moment which in fact will make your future even more vulnerable</p>
<p>   and even more precarious. But in the globalised world in which we</p>
<p>   now live, and we have no option, we're all part of it. You</p>
<p>   can't in the words of the old song "stop the world because</p>
<p>   I want to get off". That's not an option. No country can</p>
<p>   do that. </p>
<p>If we start being offensive to foreign investors they'll take</p>
<p>   their investments somewhere else, and for good measure the jobs</p>
<p>   in Australia that they would have created with that investment will</p>
<p>   follow to the other destination. This idea that you can be rude</p>
<p>   to foreign investors and say we don't want you but still keep</p>
<p>   the jobs that foreign investment creates, is of course completely</p>
<p>   mythical. I know that Australians worry when on occasions some of</p>
<p>   our great brand names like Arnott's Biscuits, and Bundaberg</p>
<p>   Sugar disappear and are bought by people overseas. I understand</p>
<p>   that. But I also understand that those things result from decisions</p>
<p>   made by Australian shareholders to sell their shares to overseas</p>
<p>   investors. I also know that this country would have a lower living</p>
<p>   standard and there would be fewer jobs for Australians if we had</p>
<p>   not accepted investment from foreign companies. </p>
<p>I met a gentleman earlier this evening, forgive me Sir, I just</p>
<p>   can't immediately recall your name, but you run the McDonald's</p>
<p>   franchise in this area. Everybody else knows you. That man's</p>
<p>   company, or that man's franchise company, employs 55,000 Australians.</p>
<p>   Now that's a foreign company. If we hadn't been beckoning</p>
<p>   to foreign investment, that's 55,000 Australians that wouldn't</p>
<p>   have been employed. Everyone knows we would never have had a motor</p>
<p>   manufacturing industry in this country if we hadn't way back</p>
<p>   in the late 1940's accepted investment from General Motors.</p>
<p>   And everyone knows that there are many other industries in this</p>
<p>   country that simply wouldn't be here if it hadn't been</p>
<p>   for foreign investment and every economy in the world worth its</p>
<p>   salt at some period of its economic history has accepted investment</p>
<p>   from abroad. </p>
<p>In the late 1890's most of the railroads and much of the major</p>
<p>   investment in the United States was British and there've been</p>
<p>   long periods in American history where foreign investment from Japan</p>
<p>   and Britain and from other parts of the world, has bulked very large</p>
<p>   in the economy of the most, the largest and most powerful economy</p>
<p>   in the world. Now, of course you need rules that ensure that if</p>
<p>   Australian equity is available it gets a fair crack of the whip.</p>
<p>   I can remember when I was Treasurer in the late 1970's. I had</p>
<p>   some fairly vigorous arguments with the then Queensland Government</p>
<p>   when I insisted that there should be Australian equity in some of</p>
<p>   the major coal mining developments in Queensland and I'm glad</p>
<p>   I did because it ensured that Australia had a stake. But the point</p>
<p>   ladies and gentleman is that we have a choice as a nation. We don't</p>
<p>   have enough domestic savings of our own to do everything that we</p>
<p>   want to do. Now if we want to continue growing our living standards,</p>
<p>   if we want to continue to have more investment that employs more</p>
<p>   Australians, then unless we save more as a community, and there's</p>
<p>   no sign that we're going to change our habits dramatically</p>
<p>   enough overnight for that to occur, then if we want those extra</p>
<p>   jobs and that higher standard of living, we've got to draw</p>
<p>   on the savings of foreigners and accept large amounts of foreign</p>
<p>   investment in this country. You don't have the option of keeping</p>
<p>   the living standards and not having the foreign investment. You</p>
<p>   want the living standards, given our savings level, you've</p>
<p>   got to take the foreign investment. Now I've gone on perhaps</p>
<p>   for a few moments about that issue because it's in the news</p>
<p>   at the moment. </p>
<p>We not only have before us at the present time in Australia, we</p>
<p>   not only have on offer the failed debt and deficit policies of the</p>
<p>   Australian Labor Party, but we now have on offer the rather unworkable,</p>
<p>   impractical, utterly out of touch economic policies of the One Nation</p>
<p>   Party. We had their national director the other day saying you could</p>
<p>   have bank loans at 2%. I thought to myself that's an interesting</p>
<p>   proposition. Who are the Australians lining up to lend the bank</p>
<p>   their money at 1.5%. I wandered around, I stopped few people in</p>
<p>   the street and I said would you lend at 1.5%, and they said no.</p>
<p>   And then I heard on the radio that the national director was saying,</p>
<p>   you don't, that's not the point. What you do is you print</p>
<p>   the money. I don't think I've heard anybody for a decade</p>
<p>   or more, twenty years, who regards himself or herself as a serious</p>
<p>   player in Australia politics suggest that the answer to any economic</p>
<p>   problem is to print money. Everyone in this audience knows that</p>
<p>   such a policy would be fundamentally disastrous. That it would push</p>
<p>   inflation through the roof and most seriously of all, it would destroy</p>
<p>   the savings of retired people in our community. And it's very</p>
<p>   interesting that some of the appeal of this party is directed to</p>
<p>   older Australians. The clarion call of nostalgia of returning to</p>
<p>   a past that did have some desirable features, but nonetheless is</p>
<p>   the past, but that particular policy would do enormous damage to</p>
<p>   retired people. It would do enormous damage to any Australians who</p>
<p>   have saved. </p>
<p>But what I'm saying to you ladies and gentleman, and I think</p>
<p>   you may have got my drift, that in these times of economic challenge</p>
<p>   from abroad, it is no time to turn back to a party that gave us</p>
<p>   deficit and debt. When Peter Costello became Treasurer, he found</p>
<p>   that over a period of eight or nine years alone the former Government</p>
<p>   had run up a Federal Government debt of about $95 billion. And it</p>
<p>   was running at the rate of about $10 billion a year and we have</p>
<p>   of course turned that around. So it's not a time to go back</p>
<p>   to those sort of failed policies. Nor is it a time to experiment</p>
<p>   with risky, faulty, out-of- touch, unreal, simplistic economic solutions.</p>
<p>   Nor is it a time to sound unwelcoming to foreign investment because</p>
<p>   if you don't welcome foreign investment in the globalised world</p>
<p>   economy you chase jobs out of Australia and that is undeniably the</p>
<p>   economic choices that face our country. But the other thing you</p>
<p>   must do also is to continue to make further changes that are needed</p>
<p>   to strengthen Australia. And that of course brings me to the issue</p>
<p>   of taxation reform. </p>
<p>Australia, as anybody who cares about the future of our country,</p>
<p>   as anybody who's thought about it knows, Australia cannot go</p>
<p>   on forever with its present taxation system. Now I know that there</p>
<p>   are people who are saying you don't talk about taxation before</p>
<p>   an election, whenever that election may be held. You do something</p>
<p>   about it afterwards. You go to the election and you say, well, we'll</p>
<p>   have a meeting about taxation. Mr Hawke did that way back in 1984.</p>
<p>   He had a meeting and now 14 years later, 13 years after the meeting</p>
<p>   and 14 years after he promised the meeting, we still haven't</p>
<p>   got a reformed taxation system. It's still ramshackle and out</p>
<p>   of touch and yet some people say to me, John, have a meeting. Budget,</p>
<p>   have a meeting. I can't do that. I've spoken so often</p>
<p>   and Peter Costello has spoken so often of the need for tax reform</p>
<p>   in this country. It's simply not credible for us to now turn</p>
<p>   around and say, no we don't need that any more. We'll</p>
<p>   have a meeting and we'll see if we can muddle through. There's</p>
<p>   no chance on Earth that at a meeting you could get a consensus.</p>
<p>   You'd get everybody in. You'd get the Liberal Party in,</p>
<p>   the National Party in, the Labor Party, everybody else, the welfare</p>
<p>   groups, the business community, the trade unions, you'd have</p>
<p>   a talk and at the end of the day everybody would have their own</p>
<p>   view. And you know what the commentators would say? It's now</p>
<p>   up to the Government to make a decision. And that's fair enough.</p>
<p>   That's what Governments are elected to do. They're elected</p>
<p>   to make decisions into proposed policy description. Now I don't</p>
<p>   think ladies and gentleman, if we want taxation reform in this country,</p>
<p>   there is really no alternative other than to lay it out before the</p>
<p>   election which we intend to do and to campaign on it and to ask</p>
<p>   the Australian people to support it because it's good for Australia.</p>
<p>   Not because we have some ideological zeal about tax reform, it's</p>
<p>   because I believe in all my being and based on all the years I've</p>
<p>   been in politics that the next logical step that's needed to</p>
<p>   further strengthen the Australia economy is to reform the Australian</p>
<p>   taxation system. That's why I'm in favour of it. And what's</p>
<p>   more I know that Mr Beazley knows deep down that we ought to reform</p>
<p>   the tax system too because back in the mid 1980's when Mr Keating</p>
<p>   was trying to change the tax system, Mr Beazley and Mr Evans were</p>
<p>   his two strongest supporters. And most people who've studied</p>
<p>   the tax system know this. And even the people who are trying to</p>
<p>   say to me. well look don't do it now, they say to me in the</p>
<p>   next breath, we know it's got to be done but do it later, do</p>
<p>   it some other time. But there comes a point when you can't</p>
<p>   kid to the public about something like that. There comes a point</p>
<p>   when you have to be absolutely direct about it. Now we do need a</p>
<p>   new system. We're not going to bring in a goods and services</p>
<p>   tax on top of the existing taxes. People run around, they hold up</p>
<p>   these placards saying no GST. I mean they're very interesting.</p>
<p>   Well of course I agree with them if you're talking about putting</p>
<p>   a GST on top of the existing system. That would be crazy, it would</p>
<p>   be unfair, and it would be unthinkable. It's always been the</p>
<p>   case that if you look at a GST you are looking at it to replace</p>
<p>   existing indirect taxes and you're also looking at accompanying</p>
<p>   it with the introduction of personal income tax cuts. And you're</p>
<p>   also looking at addressing the difficulties of the Commonwealth-State</p>
<p>   financial relationship that cause the occasional exchange over the</p>
<p>   airways between Commonwealth and State Government. And your also</p>
<p>   looking at making certain that there is protection for the low income</p>
<p>   in Australia. I mean these are the principles that I laid down.</p>
<p>   I mean of course I'm not going to bring in a GST on its own</p>
<p>   or whatever you want to call it. Of course I'm not going to</p>
<p>   do that. It's never been in contemplation. But we do have a</p>
<p>   system that's breaking down. I frequently say do you want to</p>
<p>   go on with a system that allows the ten people in this audience</p>
<p>   who can afford to buy a lear jet, or is it five, or is it twenty,</p>
<p>   I don't know, maybe it's none, to buy it without paying</p>
<p>   any sales tax at all. But the rest of us who buy a family car have</p>
<p>   got to pay a wholesale sales tax of 22%. Do we want a tax system</p>
<p>   that says that you pay a sales tax on flavoured milk and many household</p>
<p>   utensils, but you don't pay any on caviar. You pay it on orange</p>
<p>   juice concentrate but you don't pay it on other things. And</p>
<p>   I could spend the whole night regaling you with a list of anomaly</p>
<p>   of the wholesale tax system that was developed at a time when the</p>
<p>   overwhelming bulk of economic activity in Australia was manufacturing</p>
<p>   and the creating of goods and there was no service industry. Of</p>
<p>   course we need a system, a new system and we need something that</p>
<p>   gives more coherence and fairness and balance. And we certainly</p>
<p>   need a system that helps our exporters. One of the great advantages</p>
<p>   of a goods and services tax, or a value added tax, or broad based</p>
<p>   indirect tax or whatever name you call it, is that it doesn't</p>
<p>   impact on exports and that will make our exports more competitive.</p>
<p>   And that is why most other countries, most of the countries with</p>
<p>   which we trade have that taxation system. Why on Earth we continue</p>
<p>   to burden our exporters with the old fashioned system that we have</p>
<p>   is beyond my understanding. And they're the sort of issues</p>
<p>   that our political opponents, whether in the Labor Party or One</p>
<p>   Nation or whatever, have got to confront. I mean are Mr Beazley</p>
<p>   and Mrs Hanson that the present system is perfect and they don't</p>
<p>   want it changed? Are they really saying that after all the years</p>
<p>   of study we don't need a new tax system and heaven knows the</p>
<p>   tax system's been understudied for all the time I've been</p>
<p>   in politics. I entered Parliament in 1974 and a year before I came</p>
<p>   in, the late Billy Sneddon commissioned the Asprey Committee to</p>
<p>   inquire into the Australian taxation system. And do you know what</p>
<p>   it recommended. It recommended the introduction of a broad based</p>
<p>   indirect tax to replace the wholesale sales tax. And it said that</p>
<p>   marginal rates of income tax were further incentive, and it said</p>
<p>   there need to be reform. And that report was delivered to the Whitlam</p>
<p>   Government in 1975 which wasn't a good year for the Whitlam</p>
<p>   Government, and of course there wasn't much done about it.</p>
<p>   And then various attempts have been made ever since to reform the</p>
<p>   Australian taxation system but nothing serious has happened. And</p>
<p>   that is why I heard this morning on the radio as I was driving from</p>
<p>   one electorate to the other here in Melbourne, I visited quite a</p>
<p>   few today, I heard a report from the Institute of Chartered Accountants</p>
<p>   in which they said that, that under the present taxation system,</p>
<p>   a family earning $20,000 a year with two children and one bread</p>
<p>   winner, that that particular family is relatively better off under</p>
<p>   the taxation system than a family earning $30,000. In other words</p>
<p>   the family earning $30,000 a year with the same structure, is in</p>
<p>   fact $9 a week worse off after taxation. Now that's just one</p>
<p>   example of how animalist the present taxation system is. And that</p>
<p>   really does have to be addressed.</p>
<p>There are just two other things I want to say to you. And that</p>
<p>   is that it is very important to different parts of Australia that</p>
<p>   we do get the problem of native title resolved. This has been a</p>
<p>   very difficult issue for Australia, and it has been a very difficult</p>
<p>   issue for Australia because much of the debate has been exaggerated</p>
<p>   and much of the debate has been the subject of emotional exchanges.</p>
<p>   The bill that we have put forward, despite what has been said about</p>
<p>   it, respects all of the basic principles of the original decision</p>
<p>   of the High Court of Australia in the Mabo case. The bill that we</p>
<p>   have put forward is already a compromise. The bill that we have</p>
<p>   put forward does not meet all of the aspirations of people who believe</p>
<p>   that when the original Native Title Act was passed in 1993, that</p>
<p>   the grant of a pastoral lease completely extinguish Native Title,</p>
<p>   and there are many people who said after 1996 when the High Court</p>
<p>   brought down its decision in the Wik, that all you had to do was</p>
<p>   to overturn that decision and go back to what the belief had been</p>
<p>   in 1993. And we decided in the interests of trying </p>
