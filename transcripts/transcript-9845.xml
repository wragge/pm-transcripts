PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
DOORSTOP, RAAF FAIRBAIRN, CANBERRA, 16 NOVEMBER 1995<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
J: Mr Keating, are you concerned with the maritime strike and the<br />
coalminers strike following that?<br />
PM: Well I spoke to the principals overnight Mr Davis, Mr Kelty and<br />
Mr Pallas from the ACTU and I think we may have a resolution of it.<br />
I am optimistic that we might be able to tidy it up by midday or<br />
thereabouts.<br />
J: Are you aware the strike kicked off early in Melbourne at 7.00 am this<br />
morning?<br />
PM: Well I think the main issues in the dispute are likely to be settled and<br />
they are that all the civil actions that CRA was going to mount against<br />
the individuals and the organisations be taken off and that the principle<br />
of equal work for equal pay and-the right of people to bargain<br />
collectively without discrimination against that being offered by a<br />
contract I think these are the issues which are likely to be agreed.<br />
What has been at issue here is contracts being offered at prices and<br />
at wages above what the award is being offered at or any collective<br />
bargain and then, of course, when there is no union well the fear is the<br />
wages then go down. So these are weighty issues being debated.<br />
But, I think, the parties are close to an agreement and I am optimistic<br />
we can get it settled.<br />
J: The ACTU says that there needs to be changes to the IR legislation.<br />
Will you be looking at that?<br />
PM: Well I don't think there needs to be changes in this matter and CRA<br />
has been one of the few companies doing this and I think if it can be<br />
settled, it would be good for everybody. Good for the IR system, good<br />
for the economy. </p>
<p>J: Who is going to pay Carmen Lawrence's legal bills if it's not passed by<br />
the Senate?<br />
PM: Well, look, the Royal Commission is the most vicious political stunt<br />
that has been mounted in Australia probably since the War. And,<br />
I think, before the Liberals take it any further, they ought to recollect<br />
that both Mr Howard and Mr Court have very faulty memories about<br />
this both of them when asked about their own recollections, they<br />
were decidedly faulty and dodgy and I just say this, that the Australian<br />
people recognise a hypocrite in a fog ten kilometres off. And they can<br />
see the hypocrisy here and for the Commissioner to have said that<br />
professionally he could only judge things on half the evidence and<br />
then bring down such rock solid recommendations calls into question<br />
his own credibility.<br />
J: [ inaudible] perjury contempt charges?<br />
PM: Well I am just saying I think they should consider carefully before they<br />
go any further with these vicious stunts because Mr Court made it very<br />
clear that he couldn't recollect his matters when asked and Mr Howard<br />
made it clear he couldn't recollect what he said to Mr Court. So before<br />
they start now going back to the courts, they all should remember that<br />
all governments have these powers all governments, including the<br />
Federal Government.<br />
J: Is Carmen Lawrence something of a liability?<br />
PM: No, none whatsoever. I mean I think the public support for her has<br />
been manifest and, of course, the intellectual drivel which the<br />
Commissioner engaged in, when the press wrote the Commissioner<br />
and his Commission off, saying " the quicker the inquiry should be<br />
round up the better"' " you have got to wonder what the point of<br />
Royal Commissions are" " I can'f ' make a judgement on half the<br />
evidence". What does he do? He brings down these findings as<br />
though they were all a matter of, you know, tablets from a mount.<br />
I mean it is just disgraceful.<br />
J: There are suggestions that President Clinton is unable to attend<br />
APEC? Will that devalue the summit and do you remain confident that<br />
PM: Oh, it wouldn't devalue the summit, but I would very much like to have<br />
him there. But, of course, he has essentially a budget crisis on in the<br />
United States and no doubt that is attracting his attention.<br />
ends </p>
