STATEMENTL By 3Tii FIME MINISTER PM. 899<br />
COiRi_ ON* VEALTH POST-GRADUATE A JARDS.<br />
The first 100 Commonwealth post-graduate scholarships<br />
had been awarded and the scheme was now successfully launched,<br />
the Prime Minister, Mr. Menzies, announced to-day.<br />
The 100 awards made available by the Commonwealth<br />
this year were allocated to Universities by the Universities<br />
Cormission in consultation with the Vice-Chancellors' Committee.<br />
Most Universities had completed selection for their<br />
a. ards, for each of which the Commonwealth will provide Å“ 900<br />
annually for living allowance and tuition. The awards would<br />
be available for up to four years, but it was expected that they<br />
would be held on an average of from two to three years.<br />
Mr. Menzies said: " These post-graduate awards were<br />
approved by the Government on the recomnendation of the<br />
Universities Commission.<br />
" Although we believe that our action on the recommendations<br />
of the Murray Committee for increased Commonwealth grants<br />
to Universities for current expenditure will provide more adequate<br />
staff and equipment for research purposes, we felt that, having<br />
regard to the urgent need for highly trained research workers,<br />
something more should be done to assist Universities to build up<br />
their post-graduate schools.<br />
" The Government, therefore, did not hesitiate to adopt<br />
the proposal for post-graduate awards.<br />
i'The students whom the Universities have selected all<br />
have outstanding academic records.<br />
" They include many first-class honours graduates and a<br />
number of University medallists, and will undoubtedly make<br />
notable contributions in their various fields of study in<br />
Mathematics and the Natural Sciences, in the Humanities and<br />
the Social Sciences, and in Technology and Applied Science.<br />
" The Universities have received the scheme most<br />
enthusiastically, and it would seem that it has already given<br />
an appreciable stimulus to post-graduato , Iork.<br />
" This will be of great benefit to the scientific<br />
and cultural development of Australia".<br />
