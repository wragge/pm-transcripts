    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Council of Australian Governments (COAG) today agreed to develop a national telephone emergency warning system. </p>
<p>The Commonwealth will invest up to $15 million to assist the States and Territories to establish the national system.</p>
<p>It will be operated on an ongoing basis by State and Territory authorities and will be developed following an open tender process. </p>
<p>The system will help warn the public in the event of a major emergency, and will add to a range of measures including television and radio alerts, public address systems, doorknocking, sirens, signage and the internet.</p>
<p>Under the early warning system, emergency warning alerts will be sent by recorded voice and text to landline and mobile phones based on an owner's billing address.</p>
<p>The system will be developed to ensure it can appropriately address network congestion issues.</p>
<p>Technological gaps currently limit the system to sending alerts to mobile phones based on the billing address, rather than where the handset is at the time of the emergency.</p>
<p>COAG has agreed to undertake collaborative research with industry on ways to deliver warning messages to mobile phones based on the handset's physical location.</p>
<p>The Australian Government has already committed $11.3 million for this purpose and to provide access to the Integrated Public Number Database (IPND) through a new secure database providing real-time access to up-to-date telephone numbers, while protecting the identity of individuals. The tender process to develop this database closed last week.</p>
<p>The Government has passed legislation through the Federal Parliament facilitating access to the IPND.</p>
