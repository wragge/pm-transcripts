PM No. 1 11/ 1972<br />
ARMY RE-ORGANISAT ION<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister the Right Honourable<br />
William McMahon, CH, MP.<br />
The Prime Minister, Mr. McMahon, announced today that<br />
Cabinet had approved extensive changes in the command and<br />
organisational structure of the Australian Army. The changes,<br />
which will come into effect over the next three to five years,<br />
follow consideration of the Report of the Army Review Committee<br />
under the Chairmanship of Major-General F. G. Hassett.<br />
The " Hassett Committee" was established by the<br />
Minister for the Army, Mr. Peacock, in April 1970, and included<br />
representatives of the Army and the Defence Departments.<br />
The reorganisation of the Army is in keeping with the<br />
Government's policy of modernising Australian Defence to meet<br />
future contingencies. The experience the Army has gained from<br />
Vietnam, the rapid advances in the field of communications and<br />
changing strategic circumstances all indicate that reorganisation<br />
will be necessary to meet defence tasks in the seventies and<br />
eighties. The changes in organisation are designed to produce an<br />
Army to meet these future needs.<br />
They involve a reorganisat ion of the Australian<br />
Army along functional lines in three broad areas:<br />
* A change from a geographic system of command to a<br />
functional system.<br />
* A rationalization of logistic tasks.<br />
A reorganization at Army Headquarters. </p>
<p>It is by far the biggest peace time change since<br />
Federation and will result in an Army better organized to fulfil<br />
its essential role in national defence.<br />
One aspect of the reorganization requires emphasis.<br />
It does not, in itself, involve any reduction or re-location of<br />
units. It is essentially concerned with command and control and<br />
does not affect the number and location of the Australian Regular<br />
SArmy or the Citizen Military Force units It has been designed<br />
amongst other things to avoid morale problems or posting turbulence<br />
in the Army. The field force and logistic elements of the Army will<br />
be grouped into Commonwealth-wide functional commands instead of<br />
the present geographical command system. Army schools and training<br />
establishments will also be centrali'ed under one command to ensure<br />
uniformity of standards and methods and to avoid duplication.<br />
Under the new organization Army Headquarters will be<br />
relieved of its present responsibility for direct command of a<br />
large number of units.<br />
The new command system will bring about a greater<br />
compatability of functional organisation between the three<br />
Services and will facilitate any future developments in<br />
rationalization of these Services.<br />
The basis of the reorganization will be three new<br />
functional commands concerned with the three principal functions<br />
of an Army. A functional headquarters will have responsibility </p>
<p>3<br />
on a Commonwealth wide basis as opposed to geographic headquarters<br />
concerned with all functions within the area of the State in<br />
which they are located. The three functional commands will be:<br />
Field Force Command, with its headquarters in Sydney,<br />
will consist of all Regular field force units and<br />
initially all the CMF, HQ Ist Division as a part of<br />
Field Force Command will be located in Brisbane to<br />
command field force units in Queensland,<br />
With this command in Sydney, the operational Headquarters<br />
of the Army will be in the same areas as the operational<br />
Headquarters of the Navy and the Air Force.<br />
Logistic Command, with its headquarters in Melbourne,<br />
will consist of Regular base units concerned with<br />
transport, supply and repair.<br />
Training Command, with its headquarters also in Sydney,<br />
will consist of Army schools and training centres and<br />
the Australian Cadet Corps. The headquarters will be<br />
concerned with individual training and the development<br />
of Army Headquarters.<br />
As most CMF units are field force units, the whole of<br />
the CMF will be placed initially under Field Force Command,<br />
As the new system develops, CMF units will also take their<br />
place in Logistic Command and Training Command to both of which<br />
the CMF can bring a good deal of experience and knowledge in<br />
specialist fields. 0 / 4 </p>
<p>h 4.<br />
A military District Headquarters in each State will<br />
replace the present geographic Command Headquarters to handle<br />
those matters which Pre best dealt with on a. geographic<br />
basis. Logistic functions within the Am7y will be rationalized.<br />
The principal logistic tasks which, at present, are the<br />
responsibility of seven corps will be re-allotted and carried out<br />
by three corps concerned with transport, supply and repair.<br />
Major changes will also take place at Army<br />
Headquarters. Initially the present four main military branches<br />
will be retained, with some re-allotment of responsibilities.<br />
These branches will be renamed Operations, Personnel, Logistics<br />
and Material Branches,. In time, when Logistic Command is<br />
established,. the number of main branches will be reduced to<br />
three by amalgamating the interim Material and Logistics<br />
Branches into a final phase Logistics Branch.<br />
Mr. McMahon emphasised that the reorganized Army<br />
would be better prepared to carry out its role in the defence<br />
of Australia and its Territories and said that there would be<br />
a more efficient and economic use made of manpower and funds<br />
available to the Army.<br />
