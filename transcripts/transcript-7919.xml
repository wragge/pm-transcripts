CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
MICRO-ECONOMIC REFORM: THE FOURTH TERM AGENDA<br />
SYDNEY 22 FEBRUARY 1990<br />
Last Friday, after I called upon the Governor-General to<br />
recommend an election be held on 24 March, ' I outlined to the<br />
media in Canberra the vital issues facing the Australian<br />
people in this election campaign.<br />
I said that the election will determine whether we continue<br />
forward into the 1990' s, creating a fair society, an<br />
efficient and productive economy and a healthy environment<br />
for ourselves and our children or whether we turn the<br />
clock back to the days of entrenched privilege, lost<br />
opportunities and environmental degradation.<br />
As the campaign progresses my Ministers and I will be<br />
spelling out our practical and progressive plan to take<br />
Australia through the 1990s and into the next century.<br />
Yesterday, Paul Keating laid down the framework for Labor's<br />
macro-economic policies a statement that demonstrated,<br />
once again, Labor's capacity to achieve real improvements in<br />
family living standards within a responsible and<br />
fully-funded fiscal framework.<br />
Labor wants a modern, growing economy, shaken out of the old<br />
complacent dependence on commodity exports, re-equipped and<br />
restructured in its attitudes, institutions and technology,<br />
to be fully competitive in the world.<br />
Fundamental to the achievement of this goal is the obtaining<br />
of more from any given level of human or capital resources<br />
through micro-economic reform.<br />
As you know, Labor's achievements in micro-economic reform<br />
have already been far-reaching. The Australian economy is<br />
profoundly more efficient, less hamstrung more<br />
competitive, less fettered than it was when we came to<br />
office in 1983.<br />
I am releasing a detailed list of our micro-reform<br />
achievements to date so I will not detail them further<br />
here. </p>
<p>2<br />
1 will simply make the point that Australia is now weil<br />
placed to maximise the gains from these reforms. Professor<br />
Rcss Garnaut, in his recent repor-t to me on Australia's<br />
links with Northeast Asia wrote that, after misssing out on<br />
earlier opportunities up until the early 1980s:<br />
" Australia's advantages this time are a wider community<br />
perception of the magnitude and complexity of the task,<br />
and a recent record of solid achievement on policy<br />
change in the directions that are necessary for<br />
long-term success. A start has been made on reform in<br />
most of the areas where change is necessary."<br />
So I want to outline today ten central elements of Labor's<br />
fourth term micro-economic policy agenda.<br />
I apologise in advance if the detail is somewhat technical.<br />
But I want it very clearly understood from the outset of<br />
this campaign, that Labor's plans comprehensively dominate<br />
the debate about micro-economic reform in the 1990s.<br />
Ours is an ambitious but achievable agenda that covers ten<br />
areas of critical importance to Australia's economic future<br />
ten areas where Labor has both the plans and the means for<br />
further reform.<br />
1. Aviation<br />
The most significant impediments to growth in Australia's<br />
tourism industry are the regulations limiting aviation.<br />
That is the clear conclusion of both the Industries<br />
Commission and the Garnaut Report.<br />
We will continue to remove those impediments.<br />
From November, new airlines will be able to compete on major<br />
routes for the first time. Already, at least two operators<br />
have foreshadowed genuine competition to the existing<br />
airlines.<br />
My Government has ensured gateway access at major terminals<br />
for new entrants by negotiating terminal leases. The<br />
Federal Airports Corporation, the operator of our airport<br />
facilities, is discussing with airlines the establishment of<br />
common user facilities.<br />
Where essential facilities would otherwise remain<br />
undeveloped, we will accept, as Ross Garnaut recommended,<br />
private development of airport or terminal facilities.<br />
We are conducting a joint study of a single aviation market<br />
between Australia and New Zealand. It's appropriate to<br />
accelerate our consideration of trade in services, including<br />
the current exclusion of aviation from the Closer Economic<br />
Relations Agreement between Australia and New Zealand. </p>
<p>This naturally leads to the questions of domestic rights for<br />
Qantas and Air New Zealand, international aviation rights<br />
for domestic operators and the fu. ture possible links between<br />
Qantas and Australian Airlines. Professor Garnaut has<br />
highlighted the potential gains and we will carefully<br />
examine all the options.<br />
We are also looking at the feasibility of a new<br />
international air freight operator. Proposals from a number<br />
of operators are before the Government.<br />
As our crucial decision to build the Third Runway at<br />
Kingsford Smith Airport shows, we have the commitment to<br />
take the tough decisions in this area.<br />
The third runway cannot, however, be built for some years.<br />
We will implement a system to allocate landing slots in peak<br />
periods following receipt of a traffic management review in<br />
the next few months.<br />
TPIecommuninatipnn~<br />
For Australia in particular, our isolation and size demand<br />
that we are able to communicate efficiently. Australian<br />
business must have access to the most recent technology. We<br />
must achieve better services through greater competition.<br />
AUSTEL our new telecommunications watch-dog is reviewing<br />
the use of private networks. My Government will use this<br />
report to open the way to effective sharing of private<br />
networks between different corporations, without threatening<br />
Telecom's basic system.<br />
Further reviews by AUSTEL are being undertaken in the area<br />
of mobile communications cellular mobile telephone systems<br />
and cordless remote systems. Mobiles are a phenomenal<br />
growth area look in any restaurant or city street and we<br />
will be working towards increasing consumer choice in this<br />
area. Also on my Government's fourth term agenda will be<br />
consideration of AUSTEL's review of Telecom's first phone<br />
monopoly which will expire on 1 July 1991.<br />
And we are also examining the inter-relationship of the<br />
three public telecommunications operators with a view to<br />
achieving maximum efficiency. This will be in effect the<br />
first review of the total structure of telecommunications in<br />
many years, and can only lead to further improvement.<br />
3. Tnduntry PolIcjy<br />
Labor aims for nothing less than a fully competitive,<br />
internationally oriented, manufacturing sector.<br />
From 1972 through to 1992 the average level of protection<br />
will have fallen by over 60% all achieved by Labor<br />
Governments. </p>
<p>Professor Garnaut has recommended the complete removal of<br />
all tariffs by the year 2000. T1his recommendation will<br />
receive our very close assessment early in our fourth term,<br />
as I indicated when launching Ross Garnaut's report last<br />
November. Under our existing policy approach, protection will decline<br />
significantly beyond 1992, and such declines will accompany<br />
broader policy moves to improve the business environment and<br />
the competitiveness of our industries.<br />
Consistent with this, the new Industry Commission will<br />
handle a vast range of related references over our fourth<br />
term covering: the contruction costs for major projects, the<br />
commercial tariff concession and by-law systems, export<br />
franchising, availability of capital, statutory marketing<br />
arrangements and raw material pricing for domestic use.<br />
In addition the Industry Commission will review the<br />
passenger motor vehicle, dairy and sugar industries.<br />
4. Shippinn<br />
We will promote internationally competitive shipping over<br />
our fourth term.<br />
Our international shipping reforms in 1988 have received<br />
universal approval and even the Coalition has dropped this<br />
area f rom its agenda.<br />
On coastal shipping, we will implement the recently revised<br />
guidelines allowing foreign flag ships to engage in<br />
Australian trade where domestic services are inadequate.<br />
The success of this change will be vital for the future of<br />
new resource based projects.<br />
The incentives we have provided to overhaul this industry<br />
are a precondition for pragmatic change which allows.<br />
competition but retains jobs.<br />
Under our reforms new vessels are being rapidly introduced,<br />
half of which are net additions to the fleet. ANL has been<br />
returned to profitability. OECD standard manning levels<br />
have been achieved, without strikes, on more than a third of<br />
the fleet, and we will ensure that, by 1992, the rest of the<br />
fleet achieves this goal.<br />
This " revolution" will be strike-free.<br />
BHP has shown the way. It profitably operates Australian<br />
crewed vessels on triangulated runs internationally and on<br />
the coast.<br />
We will be discussing with New Zealand means of lifting<br />
union bans on foreign vessels on the Tasman. These<br />
discussions need to involve unions from both countries and<br />
to focus on freeing up specific trades. </p>
<p>The Waterfropnt<br />
On the waterfront, we will achieve a more than 20% increase<br />
in productivity in our fourth term through: redundancies for<br />
3000 waterside workers; 1000 new and more skilled<br />
employees; transition to enterprise employment; training<br />
and multi-skilling of the workforce; and removal of outmoded<br />
management and work-practices. These are reforms unmatched<br />
since containerisation.<br />
We are concerned about the lack of competition on the<br />
waterfront. We have already increased the resources of the<br />
Trade Practices Commission to allow them to investigate<br />
restrictive practices on the waterfront. We will now ask<br />
the TPC to report on any other activities which restrict<br />
competition or inhibit efficiency.<br />
Stevedoring costs will be further decreased during our<br />
fourth term by the replacement of antiquated paper<br />
transactions with electronic data interchange.<br />
This development, which will flow into road, rail and air<br />
cargo transport, stems directly from our waterfront reforms.<br />
It will lower costs by up to $ 200 million per annum.<br />
It will also improve timeliness and reliability of cargo<br />
movement. These reforms will lift waterfront productivity. They will<br />
Justify the taxpayers' investment. Our next term will prove<br />
that. 6. Fl~ ntrinity Qenpratin<br />
One of the main impediments to export-oriented processing<br />
industries is the inefficiency of electricity generation.<br />
Again, Professor Garnaut cited these industries as offering<br />
great scope for improved exports.<br />
My Government has asked the Industry Commission to review<br />
electricity generation and distribution.<br />
The Commission's report will hand my Government, and the<br />
public, a powerful weapon with which to combat resistance to<br />
reform from State and other interests.<br />
Particularly, we will examine the private provision of<br />
electricity to industry, as recommended by Garnaut, with<br />
surplus or shortfall capacity able to be sold to or bought<br />
from the grid.<br />
7. Raiways<br />
Increased rail efficiency will, for local firms, increase<br />
the effective size of Australia's domestic market. </p>
<p>And it will relieve pressures on the roads.<br />
As with electricity generation, we have asked the Industry<br />
Commission to review the efficiency of Australian railways.<br />
And as with electricity, we will use whatever powers are at<br />
our disposal to see that sensible recommendations are<br />
implemented.<br />
We will not wait for the Industries Commission report,<br />
however, before finalising our current feasibility study on<br />
a national freight carrier one integrated entity to move<br />
freight door to door across State boundaries.<br />
Export of Sprvines<br />
Australia stands to earn substantial additional income from<br />
the export of services especially to our dynamic<br />
Asia/ Pacific region.<br />
In health, education, the law and tourism, Australia offers<br />
attractive services that will be in increasing demand in the<br />
19903.<br />
Austrade has identified $ 150 million a year in earnings in<br />
health in the early 1990s; we are earning $ 100 million a<br />
year in the export of legal services; education is already<br />
earning some $ 200 million a year.<br />
We intend sending early references to the Industry<br />
Commission on impediments to the export of both health and<br />
education services.<br />
Austrade will move increasingly into these service export<br />
areas, including the export of legal services.<br />
9. International Trade<br />
Australia needs a competitive and fair international trading<br />
environment in which to participate.<br />
And this is one of the starkest differences between us and<br />
the Coalition.<br />
Andrew Peacock's flirtation with an Asia-Pacific trading<br />
bloc is extremely dangerous.<br />
Imagine if he were able to pursue this option.<br />
In the next few months, Australia becomes known again as<br />
a protectionist nation. The. Cairns Group then collapses.<br />
Later this year, when the hard bargaining of the Uruguary<br />
Round commences, Australia has no voice. </p>
<p>Just comprehend the mindless irrelevancy the Opposition.<br />
This Parliamentary Leader, Peacock, calls for the<br />
creation of a trading bloc anid then his office said he<br />
didn't understand what a trading bloc is. The Federal<br />
Liberal Party President, Mr Elliot, says w. e should join the<br />
European Community and his office, together with everyone<br />
else in the country, gives a collective horselaugh. And<br />
these people want to run our country!<br />
The alternative, under our approach, is to see the Cairns<br />
Group retaining its very substantial clout. With the<br />
successful launching of the Asia-Pacific Economic<br />
Co-operation initiative, too, Australia is well-placed to<br />
put the case for reductions in international protection and<br />
improved overseas market opportunities. We will pursue<br />
these opportunities with vigour.<br />
Rdunation and the Labor market<br />
Continuing education and labour market reforms are vital<br />
parts of the Government's fourth term agenda.<br />
I will be talking further on education later in the<br />
campaign, and Paul Keating's statement yesterday went to<br />
labour market reform.<br />
An element of Paul's statement that deserves special<br />
attention is the restructuring of assistance for the<br />
unemployed. This is far-reaching micro-reform.<br />
Indeed, it constitutes possibly the most important labour<br />
market reform since Federation.<br />
Many developed economies such as the United Kingdom and<br />
the USA have spawned a permanent underclass-of people for<br />
whom jobs, decent housing and relevant training are<br />
unattainable. With these reforms, we seek to ensure that in<br />
Australia, human resources are not wasted, and human<br />
aspirations can be fulfilled.<br />
This reform is the culmination of our consistent increasing<br />
emphasis on training for employment rather than fostering<br />
the dole mentality. It is the antithesis of the Opposition<br />
approach which simply wants to replace the social safety net<br />
with a social trap door let the unfortunate fall through<br />
and forget them.<br />
Ladies and Gentlemen.<br />
Institutions and attitudes can't be changed overnight.<br />
Results can never be immediate.<br />
Public debate will be dominated by the vocal complaints of<br />
the minority who are adversely affected, rather than by the<br />
vast majority of consumers and taxpayers who are<br />
incrementally advantaged. </p>
<p>This underlines the need for creative thought, proper<br />
consulta!-ion and a willingness to ease the burdens on those<br />
facing change. It also shows that, at times, a Government<br />
needs to stand firm against those groups who, for short-term<br />
or selfish reasons, threaten to upset the gains that can be<br />
made by the community as a whole.<br />
I've shown today Labor's credentials for this task. We have<br />
the energy and determination to develop a workable agenda<br />
for change. We have mastered the skills of consultation.<br />
And we have also shown we will stand firm where we have to.<br />
Our political opponents understand none of this -and yet<br />
they repudiate all of it.<br />
For them, consultation is a waste of time.<br />
For them, standing firm involves too a high price they<br />
would just cave-in, as they would have done with the pilots,<br />
whose irrelevant Federation is, understandably, now pumping<br />
for the opposition in this election.<br />
For the Opposition, productivity is an empty buzz word.<br />
They know it is something good, but they haven't the<br />
faintest notion of what to do if they were elected.<br />
The Opposition Leader insults our intelligence by saying<br />
that his immediate implementation of a micro reform program<br />
will lower interest rates.<br />
This is absurd, for at least three reasons.<br />
First, markets will want to see improvements, not accept<br />
promises. Indeed, the markets know that Opposition to change can<br />
temporarily make things worse.<br />
Second, the performance response to micro reform is never<br />
fast, as I have said.<br />
And often we must await new projects or new capacity to see<br />
the largest benefits: for example, from changes in coastal<br />
shipping.<br />
Michael Stutchbury said in yesterday's Financial Review that<br />
avoid the severe short-term indigestion costs of<br />
labour market deregulation, the productivity pay-off can<br />
only come slowly. And this means that Mr Peacock's promises<br />
of big and quick interest rate falls are baloney".<br />
Third, the Liberals' policies, when you look at them, go<br />
nowhere. </p>
<p>Look at their promise to introduce company-based employment<br />
on th~ e waterfront, and n'ot pay money without genuine change.<br />
This is a shorthand description of Labor policies that are<br />
already being implemented.<br />
In coastal shipping they'll introduce foreign competition.<br />
Full stop. No adjustment package, no consultation. What do<br />
they expect the coastal shippers' response to be?<br />
Mr Peacock probably hasn't thought about it. But badly<br />
handled and you know the Liberal's IR record such moves<br />
could easily close Australia's sea transport for months.<br />
Labor will achieve OECD manning limits, and the use of<br />
foreign vessels via continuous voyage permits. We had some<br />
heated discussion, but no industrial disruption.<br />
The Coalition will cut tariffs, they say. Well, they never<br />
have before. Only Labor has.<br />
The ultimate irony for those subjected to the Opposition's<br />
new-found enthusiasm for micro-reform is that much of the<br />
legacy of inefficiency that Labor is erasing today dates<br />
from the days of Liberal rule.<br />
It was the Liberals who established the two airlines<br />
agreement and the system of waterfront pooling.<br />
Today they have found voice to decry such inef ficiencies<br />
and to damn us for our slow pace of reform!<br />
Late last year, when I was speaking at the National Press<br />
Club, I summarised my Government's achievements in microreform<br />
and I issued a very specific and pointed challenge.<br />
I challenged anyone to find a period in Australia's history<br />
that had seen an achievement of micro-reform that came<br />
within a bull's roar of ours.<br />
That was on 7 December 77 days ago.<br />
The response to my challenge from the Opposition, those<br />
faint-hearted champions of productivity, has been total<br />
silence. That silence speaks more eloquently than words; it virtually<br />
shouts from the rooftops; it declares that when it comes to<br />
micro-economic reform, Labor in the 1980s set an<br />
unparalleled pace of reform.<br />
My first challenge has gone unanswered. So let me issue<br />
another today.<br />
Now that I have announced Labor's agenda for reform in the<br />
1990s, let the Opposition reply. </p>
<p>Let them show how they would match the rapid pace of reform<br />
we will set and to do so without sacrificing the jobs of<br />
thousands of Australians and without wrecking the successful<br />
integration of Australian industry into a competitive<br />
international environment.<br />
Labor set the pace for micro-reform in the 1980s.<br />
And it will be Labor in the 1990s who will maintain that<br />
pace. Not glib promises, not the slick phrase but real,<br />
determined, well thought out action to take Australia fully,<br />
competitively, into the vigorous and highly lucrative<br />
international economy. </p>
<p>MICROECONOMIC REFORM UNDER LABOR<br />
1. General Tariff Reform<br />
With the exception of the two industries described<br />
below and a small number of rates that would otherwise<br />
have become anomalous, all tariffs above 15% are being<br />
reduced to 15%, and those tariffs between 10% and<br />
are being reduced to 10%, all over 4 years to July<br />
1992. The general revenue duty of 2% was abolished at a<br />
cost of S240m.<br />
2. Motor Vehicle Tariff Reform<br />
Tariff quotas on motor vehicles were removed and<br />
tariffs are to be reduced from 57h% to 35% by January<br />
1992.<br />
3. Textiles: Clothing and Footwear Protection Reform<br />
Quotas are to be phased out by 1 July 1995 to leave<br />
tariff-only protection.<br />
4. May 1988 Agricultural Reformr<br />
Assistance to sugar, dried vine fruit, tobacco and<br />
citrus industries was converted to tariff and subject<br />
to the same reductions as applied to manufacturing<br />
industry and some domestic administered price<br />
arrangements were liberalised ( eg. dairy). Removal of<br />
fertiliser subsidy.<br />
Foreign Exchange Market<br />
The $ A has been floated and the major part of existing<br />
exchange controls have been abolished. The Government<br />
authorised 40 companies to deal on the foreign exchange<br />
market, thereby broadening that market from its<br />
dominance by the major banks.<br />
6. Banking Sector<br />
All maturity controls on bank deposits have been<br />
removed, thereby enabling banks to compete in the short<br />
term money market. Following consideration of 42<br />
applications, 16 partly or wholly foreign based<br />
applicants were invited to establish banking operations<br />
in Australia. The interest rates ceilings on bank loans<br />
under $ 100,000 has been removed; the ceiling on bank<br />
home loans has been removed; the distinction between<br />
trading and savings banks has been removed; and the SRD<br />
requirement has been replaced with a non-callable<br />
deposit ( NCD) requirement. </p>
<p>2<br />
7. Non-Bank Sprrnr<br />
The " 30/ 20 rule" ( which allowed tax concessizns life<br />
offices and super funds provided they held at least<br />
of assets in public securities and at least 20% in CGS)<br />
has been abolished. On 1 July 1987, the Cheques<br />
Payments Orders Act came into operation enabling nonbank<br />
financial institutions ( MEFIs) to issue chequelike<br />
instruments called payment orders and thereby<br />
compete better with banks in the demand deposit market.<br />
8. Daea~ ulatinn of Forpign Tnvastmpnt<br />
Most investments are approved unless judged contrary to<br />
the national interest. As a further step, the Treasurer<br />
in January 1988 announced changes to the foreign<br />
investment guidelines as they apply to oil and gas<br />
projects over $ 10 million. Today, all proposals in the<br />
oils and gas sector are approved unless judged<br />
contrary.<br />
9. TArmin tInn of the Two Airline AnrApment<br />
Present regulation limits competition on trunk routes<br />
between 18 Australian cities to two airlines. Prices<br />
are set by a Tribunal. On termination of these<br />
arrangements at the earliest practical date ( October<br />
1990), all routes will be thrown open to competition,<br />
prices will be set by the market, and new entrants will<br />
be guaranteed gates at all major airports. Also " user<br />
paysm pricing for use of airport facilities will allow<br />
the Federal Airports Corporation to respond quickly to<br />
industry needs for new facilities. At least two new<br />
entrants are at an advanced stage of planning for major<br />
trunk operations.<br />
Intarnational Passenger rhartpr Policy<br />
Charter flights for tourists have been broadly<br />
deregulated. Programs of charters are now strongly<br />
encouraged and previous restrictions designed to<br />
protect scheduled carriers have been reduced to the<br />
minimum consistent with Air Service Agreement<br />
obligations. Canberra, Perth and Cairns have as a<br />
result received the benefit of major new tourist flight<br />
programs. </p>
<p>2.1. internritnnal Air r':<br />
Both charter and scheduled capacity have been strcngly<br />
encouraged through virtual deregulation in the case of<br />
the former and positive negotiating stances in the case<br />
of the latter. Charter flights have increased from 167<br />
to 956 over the life of the Government. Scheduled<br />
capacity is up from 85,000 tonnes outbound to 166,000<br />
tonnes.<br />
12. Grain HandlinagpRform<br />
Recommended reforms were estimated to produce cost<br />
savings of up to $ 10 per tonne ( more than $ 100 million<br />
a year in total). Whilst the Commonwealth legislated to<br />
implement those recommendations which fell within its<br />
responsibility, action at the State level was<br />
disappointing. In view of this, the Government decided<br />
to use Commonwealth powers over export and interstate<br />
trade to include in new wheat marketing legislation<br />
provisions to regulate to exempt the AWE and other<br />
grain trading corporations from restrictive State<br />
legislation in the areas of grain storage, handling and<br />
transport and the marketing of wheat.<br />
13. TP1lerommunicating Reform Pankage-of May 1988<br />
Allows effective competition in the provision of<br />
customer premises equipment ( eg PAEX), value-added<br />
services ( eg answering machines) and other<br />
telecommunications services ( eg phone maintenance,<br />
installation of second and subsequent phones) through<br />
regulatory changes and the establishment of AUSTEL.<br />
This independent body will subsume Telecom's regulatory<br />
functions, so allowing effective competition.<br />
14. Company Tax Rpform<br />
The corporate tax rate, in one step, has been cut from<br />
49 per cent to 39 per cent. This built upon earlier<br />
reforms, which abolished the double taxation of<br />
dividends through introduction of the imputation<br />
system, and was accompanied by major reforms to the<br />
company tax base to remove tax distortions.<br />
Depreciation provisions were brought into line with the<br />
economic life of assets, removing 5/ 3 year depreciation<br />
provisions which distorted decision making. Likewise<br />
concessions, favouring particular industries such as<br />
gold mining, agriculture, life offices and other groups<br />
were removed. </p>
<p>Reform of Goverremn Musines EntP-rirses ( GBEs)<br />
Over 40 longstanding controls have : een removed frcm<br />
nearly all GBEs, allowing them, fcr example, to enter<br />
into contracts without Ministerial approval; exempting<br />
GBEs from processes under the Public Works Committee<br />
Act 1969; extending their ability to invest surplus<br />
monies and enter loan contracts without Government<br />
approval; providing to boards the right to dismiss a<br />
Chief Executive; removing many public service staffing<br />
and administrative practices; and allowing GBEs to<br />
establish their own superannuation schemes.<br />
16. The Tndustrial Relations Act 1988<br />
Places special emphasis on settling disputes at the<br />
workplace level, provides scope for greater flexibility<br />
with respect to working arrangements and remuneration,<br />
requires unions to increase membership to at least 1000<br />
and facilitates union amalgamation.<br />
17. Award Restructuring<br />
This offers the prospect of substantial workplace<br />
reform, in particular reform of Australia's traditional<br />
craft based union structure. To a significant extent,<br />
the success of award restructuring has been and remains<br />
dependent on the initiative shown by management in<br />
fully exploring the opportunities offered.<br />
18. Drpgulation of Oil Markatlina<br />
Effective from 1 January 1988 refiners and crude oil<br />
producers are able to negotiate freely the quantities<br />
and prices of crude oil they buy and sell.<br />
19. Natural nag<br />
The Government has terminated the administered pricing<br />
formula, allowing a more flexible approach to price<br />
setting, and relegated export controls to a strictly<br />
reserve power.<br />
Request and Response ProcedurA<br />
For review of existing regulations announced in<br />
December 1988, provides for industry-driven regulatory<br />
reform. </p>
<p>a<br />
21. Coa-gral Shipping<br />
Program to reduce industry costs by incentives to<br />
replace old, ineffective ships with new vessels as a<br />
result, 25 new vessels have been ordered or introduced<br />
( one-third of the coastal fleet). This is linked<br />
explicitly to lower manning levels and multiskilling of<br />
crews on the new vessels average crew sizes have as a<br />
result fallen from 33 in 1983 to the mid 20s now and<br />
will be 21 by 1992 ( equal to OECD levels). With a<br />
program to alter leave and other conditions the number<br />
of crew per berth should fall from 2.2 to 2. In order<br />
to see that these cost savings are passed on to users,<br />
a Prices Surveillance Authority review will take place.<br />
The new policy permits foreign vessels onto the<br />
Australian coast where Australian vessels cannot meet<br />
customer requirements.<br />
22. Waterfrn By 1992, all major stevedoring operations should be<br />
fully responsible for their own work forces rather than<br />
dependent on a " pool" system financed by levies. The<br />
present system allows no flexibility in employment<br />
arrangements and little in terms of pricing between<br />
operators. The new system will make the waterfront<br />
labour market similar to that in other industries; this<br />
is an essential precondition to competition.<br />
Further, the industry and the Government have agreed to<br />
finance a package to release from the industry 3000 of<br />
its least productive members, and bring in 1000 new<br />
employees. Together with multi-skilling, the removal of<br />
poor work practices and new investment, this will raise<br />
productivity by over 20% Container depots will be<br />
freed from all constraints on competition.<br />
23. Defpnne Industry Reform<br />
There has been a massive program of restructuring<br />
Government-owned defence facilities. The Government<br />
sold the Williamstown Naval Dockyard in Victoria and<br />
the aircraft workshop in South Australia; it converted<br />
the former Government Aircraft Factories at Fishermen' s<br />
Bend and Avalon into a Government-owned enterprise,<br />
Aerospace Technologies of Australia, run strictly on<br />
business lines. Since 1984 the annual cost to the<br />
taxpayer of subsidies to our Government-owned defence<br />
factories has been cut by around $ 250 million. The<br />
number of employees in dedicated defence manufacturing<br />
facilities has been reduced from more than 15,000 to<br />
6,800 employees. </p>
