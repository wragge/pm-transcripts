    <content><![CDATA[<p>I am pleased to welcome His Excellency the Honourable Baron Divavesi Waqa, President of the Republic of Nauru, and Madam Louisa Waqa to Australia from 5-9 April 2017.</p>
<p>This visit will provide a valuable opportunity to reaffirm the friendship between Australia and the Republic of Nauru, and will allow us to explore ways to strengthen the many links between our two nations.</p>
<p>Australia and Nauru share a strong interest in the stability and prosperity of the Pacific region. We enjoy close cooperation on combatting the scourge of people smuggling.  Australia is also Nauru’s largest trade, investment and development partner.</p>
<p>The visit will provide the opportunity for President Waqa to meet with officials from the Asian Development Bank, and share in lessons learnt from Australia’s infrastructure and sustainable energy facilities.</p>
<p>President Waqa will visit Brisbane, Sydney and Canberra. I look forward to meeting with President Waqa and Madam Louisa Waqa during their time in Australia.</p>
