<p>Australia is gravely concerned by escalating conflict in the Middle East.</p>
<p>The Government condemns the repeated rocket and mortar attacks on Israel from the Gaza Strip and calls on Hamas to cease these immediately.</p>
<p>	Australia supports Israel's right to defend itself against these indiscriminate attacks. Such attacks on Israel's civilian population are utterly unacceptable.<br />
	Further escalations in rocket attacks from Gaza, such as those seen overnight, will not serve the interests of the Palestinian people or their cause for self-determination and statehood.<br />
	We urge both Hamas and Israel to exercise restraint and to protect the lives of civilians.<br />
	The Government of Australia will work earnestly with other countries to end further attacks from Gaza and to encourage a de-escalation of this conflict.  We encourage regional countries, particularly Egypt, to support efforts to restore peace.<br />
	The only way forward is a two-state solution based on direct negotiations between Palestinians and Israelis.</p>
