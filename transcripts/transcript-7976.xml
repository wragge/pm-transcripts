PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 19 MARCH 1990<br />
It was with deep regret that I learned of the death of the<br />
Honourable Robert Katter.<br />
Bob Katter had long and distinguished service in the<br />
Commonwealth Parliament of 24 years as the Member ( National<br />
Party) for Kennedy, Queensland. This service included a<br />
period as Minister for the Army in the McMahon Ministry.<br />
In recognition of Bob Katter's distinguished contribution to<br />
Australia, and as a mark of respect, the Government will<br />
accord him a State Funeral. The service will be held in the<br />
Good Shepherd Catholic Church, Stanley Street, Mount Isa,<br />
Queensland, at 4.00 pm on Wednesday, 21 March 1990, to be<br />
followed by internment in the Mount Isa Lawn Cemetery.<br />
As a further mark of respect, the Australian National Flag<br />
will be flown at half mast in Queensland and the Australian<br />
Capital Territory on Wednesday, 21 March 1990, the day of<br />
the State Funeral.<br />
