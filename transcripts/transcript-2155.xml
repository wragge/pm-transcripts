PRIME MINISTER'S TELEGRAMS TO NEW GUINEA IN REPLY<br />
TO COMPLAINTS OF DAMAGE CAUSED BY' MR. WHITLAMStatement<br />
by the Prime Minister, Mr. John Gorton<br />
Following are texts of telegrams received yesterday by the Prime<br />
Minister from the Planters' Association of New Guinea and Bali Plantations<br />
Ltd.<br />
Planters' Association of New Guinea:<br />
" THIS ASSOCIATION IS SHOCKED THAT THE LEADER OF<br />
THE OPPOSITION PARTY PUBLICLY SUPPORTS CONVICTED<br />
LAW BREAKERS WHO ARE AGAINST THE BASIC TENETS<br />
OF SELF GOVERNMENT THAT IS THE ORGANISATION<br />
ELECTION AND WORKING OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT<br />
COUNCILS. FURTHER THAT IN VISITING ANOTHER<br />
COUNTRY THE LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION AND HIS<br />
ASSOCIATES HAVE SHOWN GRAVE DISCOURTESY IN<br />
CRITICISING THIS COUNTRY'S GOVERNMENT AND<br />
LEADERS WITH LITTLE BASIC KNOWLEDGE OF THE<br />
PEOPLE'S CULTURE, UPBRINGING AND BEIEFS.<br />
MR. WHITLAM'S VISIT HAS CAUSED GRAVE DISQUIET<br />
LACK OF CONFIDENCE IN THE FUTURE BY ALL<br />
RESIDENTS INCLUDING THE MAJORITY OF PAPUANS<br />
AND NEW GUINEANS AND IT IS THE CONSIDERED<br />
OPINION OF THIS ASSOCIATION THAT EVERY EFFORT<br />
BE MADE BY YOU TO VISIT THIS TERRITORY AS EARLY<br />
AS POSSIBLE TO COUNTERACT THE DAMAGE WHICH<br />
HAS BEEN DONE. WOULD APPRECIATE ACKNOWLEDGMENT."<br />
Bali Plantations Ltd.:<br />
" THIS COMPANY DEPLORES THE LABOR PARTY<br />
PROMOTION ACTIVITIES OF LEADER OF THE<br />
OPPOSITION IN THE GAZELLE PENINSULA AS A<br />
FURTHER AGGRAVATION TO RECENT TROUBLES<br />
HERE WHICH MUST RESULT IN A COMPLETE NEGATION<br />
OF COSTLY OFFICIAL ACTION IN RESTORING LAW AND<br />
ORDER. THIS HAS RESULTED IN AN INCREASED LACK<br />
OF CONFIDENCE IN INVESTMENT IN THIS AREA BY<br />
BOTH INDIGENOUS AND OVERSEAS INVESTORS. WE<br />
RESPECTFULLY REQUEST THAT THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
VISIT THIS DISTRICT IMMEDIATELY TO REFUTE THE<br />
PROMISES MADE BY MR. WHITLAM WHO IS REGARDED<br />
BY THE TOLAIS AS THE LEADING GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL / 2 </p>
<p>2-<br />
TO VISIT RABAUL FOR MANY YEARS PARTICULARLY<br />
WHILST HE APPEARS TO SYMPATHISE WITH THE<br />
REBELLIOUS ATT7ITUJDE OF THE MINORITY REPEAT<br />
MINORITY OF THE INDIGENOUS POPULATION."<br />
Today the Prime Minister, Mr. John Gorton, sent the following<br />
reply to each of the above:<br />
" YOUR TELEGRAM RECEIVED. I BELIEVE MR.<br />
WHITLAM'S STATEMENTS ARE CALCULATED TO<br />
WORSEN THE DIVISIONS AMONGST THE TOLAI<br />
PEOPLE IN THE GAZELLE PENINSULA AND TO<br />
ENCOURAGE EXTREMISTS.<br />
THE GOVERNMENT BELIEVES THE LEGALLY<br />
ELECTED MULTI-RACIAL COUNCIL, WHICH<br />
INCLUDES 34 NATIVES AND 4 NON-NATIVES, IS<br />
ACCEPTABLE TO THE MAJORITY OF THE TOLAL<br />
PEOPLE AND IS IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF GOOD<br />
GOVERNMENT IN THE GAZELLE PENINSULA. THE<br />
GOVERNMENT WAS PREPARED TO TEST THIS<br />
BELIEF BY A REFERENDUM HELD BY SECRET<br />
BALLOT. THE MATAUNGAN ASSOCIATION REFUSED<br />
TO AGREE TO SUCH A SECRET BALLOT REFERENDUM<br />
BEING HELD AND SAID IT WOULD NOT, IN ANY CASE,<br />
ABIDE BY THE RESULT OF SUCH A BALLOT. THE<br />
MATAUNGAN ASSOCIATION HAVE WITHHELD TAXES,<br />
REFUSED TO JOIN IN DISCUSSION OF THIS QUESTION,<br />
AND HAVE RESORTED TO VIOLENCE.<br />
MR. WHLTLAM'S SUPPORT OF THIS ATITITUDE AND<br />
ACTION IS EMPHATICALLY REPUDIATED BY THE<br />
GOVERNMENT AND WE WISH THIS TO BE KNOWN<br />
TO ALL IN THE GAZELLE PENINSULA. THE<br />
GOVERNMENT'S ATT'ITUDE HAS BEEN EXPRESSED<br />
BY THE ADMINISTRATOR EXECUTIVE COUNCIL.<br />
WE WILL NOT TOLERATE BREACHES OF THE LAW,<br />
WILL INVOKE THE LAW AGAINST THE USE OF FORCE,<br />
AND CALL UPON ALL GROUPS TO CO-OPERATE IN<br />
RESTORING A PEACEFUL SITUATION.<br />
I REGRET THAT I AM UNABLE AT PRESENT TO<br />
ACCEPT YOUR SUGGESTION THAT I VISIT THE<br />
AREA, BUT I HOPE THIS EXPRESSION OF THE<br />
GOVERNMENT'S INTENTIONS WILL HELP TO<br />
REPAIR THE DAMAGE CAUSED BY MR. WHITLAM." / 3 </p>

Gazelle Peninsula Council:<br />
" GAZELLE PENINSULA COUNCIL EAST NEW BRITAIN<br />
DEEPLY CONCERNED AND DISTRESSED BY ILL<br />
CONSIDERED AND ILL INFORMED STATEMENTS<br />
MADE BY WHITLAM LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION.<br />
HIS SUPPORT OF THE MATAUNGAN ASSOCIATION<br />
HIS ADMIRATION FOR ITS LEADERS AND ITS AIMS<br />
CONSIDERED SERIOUSLY DETRIMENTAL TO THE<br />
PEACE ORDER AND GOOD GOVERNMENT OF THE<br />
GAZELLE PENINSULA AND TERRITORY. WHITLAM'S<br />
CONFIDENT STATEMENT THAT HE WILL BE PRIME<br />
MINISTER 1972 OR EARLIER AND WILL GRANT<br />
IMMEDIATE HOME RULE ACCEPTED BY VERY<br />
MANY TOLAIS AS FACT. IMPLICATION THAT<br />
MATAUNGAN ASSOCIATION WILL ACHIEVE ALL<br />
ITS OBJECTIVES WHICH INCLUDE DESTRUCTION<br />
OF MULTI-RACIAL COUNCIL RETURN OF<br />
ALIENATED LAND MUST BE REFUTED AT ALL<br />
COSTS. FAILURE OF WHITLAM TO SUPPORT<br />
DULY ELECTED MULTI-RACIAL COUNCIL<br />
PARTICULARLY IN COUNCIL TAX ISSUE WILL<br />
HAVE ADVERSE EFFECT THROUGHOUT TERRITORY.<br />
MATAUNGAN MEMBERS HAD EVERY OPPORTUNITY<br />
CONTEST JUNE ELECTIONS BUT D ECLINED TO DO<br />
SO. WHITLAM'S STATEMENTS WILL DESTROY<br />
EFFECTIVE GOVERNMENT THIS AREA UNLESS<br />
REFUTED. FURTHER BLOODSHED AND VIOLENCE<br />
LIKELY IF NO POSITIVE ACTION TAKEN. COUNCIL<br />
CONSIDERS THAT AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT MUST<br />
RESTORE THE CONFIDENCE OF ALL PEOPLE OF<br />
THE TERRITORY AND IN PARTICULAR GAZELLE<br />
AREA BY CLEAR RESTATEMENT OF YOUR<br />
GOVERNMENT'S POLICY AND PLANS FOR OUR<br />
FUTURE POLITICAL SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC<br />
DEVELOPMENT." The Prime Minister has sent the following reply:<br />
" YOUR TELEGRAM RECEIVED. I BELIEVE MR.<br />
