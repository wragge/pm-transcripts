The Coalition has laid down a sweeping plan for repairing the environment, with particular emphasis on salinity and water quality.<br />
When I spoke at the Press Club in August, I nominated water quality as one of the great challenges that Australian Governments must face up to.<br />
The key plank of our environment plan for a third term is the fight against salinity and declining water quality.<br />
If elected, the Coalition Government will establish an Environment Committee of Cabinet.  This will provide a strong whole of government framework on issues of environmental sustainability.  I will chair this committee.<br />
The only sustainable way to clean up our waterways is to clean up our catchments.  This will be the focus of Natural Heritage Trust 2.<br />
A key focus of the next Natural Heritage Trust will be the fight to wind back salinity and improve water quality.  The Coalition will be spending at least $350 million directly on projects to improve water quality.<br />
This will be enhanced by other arms of the Trust. For example, expenditure on protecting biodiversity and restoring native bush will also help improve water quality because they will be improving the overall health of the catchment.<br />
Change will be needed to combat some of the significant problems and Government must work co-operatively with communities and individuals.  Government issuing edicts from Canberra is not the way to go.<br />
There must also be a clear understanding that compensation should be paid where individuals give up property rights in the broader community interest.<br />
This payment of fair compensation is not negotiable as far as the Coalition is concerned.<br />
The Coalition will ensure that the next COAG meeting addresses definitions of property rights, including water rights, and mechanisms to deliver just compensation for the loss of these rights.<br />
The Coalition has established a strong record in dealing with the environment.  We established the first $1.5 billion Natural Heritage Trust, with 400,000 Australians involved.<br />
We are spending almost $1 billion to reduce Greenhouse gases in a way that does not damage industry and cost jobs. We put in place Australia';s first comprehensive Oceans Policy to scientifically resolve the balance between conservation and development.  And we have put in place the first Commonwealth State action plan to tackle salinity and water quality problems.<br />
The Coalition is proud of its achievements on the environment.  Our plan for a third term continues this good work. </p>
