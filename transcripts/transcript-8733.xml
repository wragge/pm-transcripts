PRIME MINISTER<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON. P. J. KEATING MP<br />
WHO IS LEADING THE COALITION?<br />
" I'm absolutely committed, and our party is<br />
absolutely committed to the Introduction of a broadbased<br />
goods and services tax as part of tax reform.<br />
We are preparedr t6"-take o6r political fortunes on<br />
that as an element of the package. I am personally<br />
prepared to stake my political career on it. We are<br />
absolutely determined to demonstrate to people that<br />
we are genuine about tax reform and genuine about<br />
structural change in Australia." Joln Hewson, October 1991<br />
The statement today by Ian Sinclair that the Coalition<br />
may now not introduce a consumption tax requires an<br />
immediate explanation from the current leader of the<br />
Coalition, Dr Hewson.<br />
Mr Sinclair said on radio:<br />
" We're talking about the impact of a policy [ the<br />
GST] that may or may not be implemented and a policy<br />
that is really only a proposition that's been<br />
advanced by the alternate government."<br />
Either Mr Sinclair knows something that Dr Hewson does<br />
not, or Dr Hewson has been misleading the Australian<br />
people about what is intended under a Coalition<br />
Government. In a radio interview only yesterday Dr Hewson said:<br />
" I want to actually tell the truth and I refuse to<br />
deceive people, so I've gone out and told people the<br />
truth about the GST."<br />
And in a press statement yesterday he said:<br />
" We shall continue to advocate reforins... among these<br />
are tax reforms, including a GST." </p>
<p>Mr Sinclair's remarks confirm speculation that Dr<br />
Hewson's leadership is now a matter of open discussion at<br />
the highest level of the Liberal and National parties.<br />
It is becoming increasingly apparent that Dr Hewson Å“ 8<br />
the wrong man with the wrong policies for Australia.<br />
Dr Hewson belongs to the era of Thatcherism which is now<br />
in the dust bin of history. The GST belongs there as<br />
well. With Dr Hewson and the GST the Liberal Party now has both<br />
hands tied one to a rock, the other to a hard place.<br />
