<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Any questions?</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>[Inaudible]</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, we had a good and direct discussion about a number of things.</p>
<p> We talked about security arrangements for the Olympic Games. He won't</p>
<p> want me to go into any detail on that but it's obviously something</p>
<p> that's important to the Australian Government as well as to SOCOG</p>
<p> and we're well satisfied with arrangements in relation to that.</p>
<p> And then I had a discussion with him about crime and law enforcement</p>
<p> generally in the United States and, most particularly, about drug</p>
<p> issues.</p>
<p>There's no doubt from my discussion that there is very strong</p>
<p> support within the United States for the zero tolerance policing methods</p>
<p> that have been used in New York and a number of other cities. Contrary</p>
<p> to what has been claimed by many in Australia, what has been done</p>
<p> in cities like New York has not resulted, according to the Director</p>
<p> of the FBI, in the problem being moved to another part of the country.</p>
<p> He said that that is disproved by the statistics and he quite strongly</p>
<p> rejected that. I asked him whether there was any support of significance</p>
<p> within the United States for different approaches to the drug problem</p>
<p> such as heroin trials or so-called safe injecting processes. He said</p>
<p> there wasn't. He said there was very strong support for the programmes</p>
<p> that were being implemented in that country.</p>
<p>Now, I've made it plain in the past that I don't automatically</p>
<p> extrapolate American experience or American attitudes to Australia.</p>
<p> It's a question of listening to what other countries do. It's</p>
<p> a question of making your own judgements about what is suitable in</p>
<p> Australia. And it was on that basis that I spoke to him and I think</p>
<p> it would be absolutely ludicrous for somebody in my position, given</p>
<p> the concern that I have about this issue, not to take advantage of</p>
<p> the opportunity of talking to the Director of the FBI and to get first-hand</p>
<p> from him his own views. He believes that they have had very considerable</p>
<p> success over the last 10 to 15 years in reducing the drug problem.</p>
<p> He gave a very powerful, I thought, explanation as to why such things</p>
<p> as heroin trials were inadvisable when he said that it would send</p>
<p> completely the wrong signal to younger children, to younger people</p>
<p> and to children in that in the one sense you were asking them not</p>
<p> to take drugs and yet in the next sense you're in effect giving</p>
<p> it some kind of legitimacy in saying that there was some kind of government</p>
<p> safety net and government protection available if you did adopt the</p>
<p> habit.</p>
<p>Now, they were his views as expressed to me. I think it's been</p>
<p> a valuable opportunity to hear from somebody who heads probably the</p>
<p> best-known law enforcement agency in the world. The American experience</p>
<p> is not automatically relevant to Australia, it never is and it never</p>
<p> should be. But, equally, given the size of the country and the dimension</p>
<p> of the drug problem in that country, it's absolutely ludicrous</p>
<p> just to completely ignore the American experience. But it's like</p>
<p> all of the experiences that you hear of in relation to these issues,</p>
<p> you take them into account and then you make a value judgement of</p>
<p> your own.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>[Inaudible]</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, he certainly didn't Â– I didn't hear anything</p>
<p> this afternoon to suggest that my view was wrong, let me put it that</p>
<p> way, at its softest. But as I say, in the end you make your own judgements</p>
<p> according to the experience in your own country. But I said before</p>
<p> that I can't find any place in the world where a heroin trial</p>
<p> quote has "been a success".</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Did Judge Freeh make any comment about the future of Australia's</p>
<p> own opiate industry in Tasmania if Australia was to adopt any form</p>
<p> of a heroin trial?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, he didn't, he didn't.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>He didn't say anything about that at all.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, he didn't. He did canvass, in some detail, the steps that</p>
<p> are being taken by the United States to increase pressure within the</p>
<p> source countries and increase the policing effectiveness within source</p>
<p> countries. And I think that's a very important element, not only</p>
<p> for the Americans but also for us. One of the by-products of the increased</p>
<p> resources that we have put in here in Australia is that we have been</p>
<p> able to get more Australian Federal Police officers in the source</p>
<p> countries. Now, I understand that 98 per cent of the heroin that comes</p>
<p> into Australia comes from one source in Asia and the fact that we</p>
<p> have been able to get some additional officers into countries around</p>
<p> there and to build up in recent months to build up contacts and sources</p>
<p> of intelligence in that area that has been a particular benefit in</p>
<p> the efforts of our own law enforcement people in dealing with the</p>
<p> problem.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Is that country you are referring to Burma or Thailand.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>The former.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>[Inaudible] what consideration have you given to...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I will have a look at that, yes. I mean, within reason all of</p>
<p> these things should be looked at.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>[Inaudible]...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I am having a look at a number of things at the present time.</p>
<p> I mean, it's very obvious that an important element of an effective</p>
<p> strategy is to have adequate resources available for the treatment</p>
<p> of people who wish to kick the habit. And there's nothing more</p>
<p> distressing in this whole debate than to be told by somebody that</p>
<p> their child or they themselves are trying to find treatment and they</p>
<p> can't get it because there's too great a demand for the</p>
<p> treatment or the detoxification process.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>[inaudible] are you proposing more federal funds?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, we are looking at the whole thing. I am not going to, sort of,</p>
<p> on the run say we are going to do this or do that. We have said that</p>
<p> we're looking at a number of options and we will take some proposals</p>
<p> to the Premiers' conference. We have invested $290 million in</p>
<p> a four year programme of which $125 million is going towards education</p>
<p> and treatment and $165 million towards enforcement. Now, given our</p>
<p> responsibility for customs and our national responsibilities that</p>
<p> is not a bad balance. As is always the case you can always argue a</p>
<p> case for more resources into a particular area but the treatment part</p>
<p> of it is very important. The education part of it is very important</p>
<p> and so is the law enforcement part. You can't ignore any one</p>
<p> of those three areas, they are all very, very important elements of</p>
<p> the Government having an effective response and the very, very important</p>
<p> elements of the Government working together with the States to have</p>
<p> an effective response.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>[Inaudible].. zero tolerance in relation to young people....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, have you just arrived have you?</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>No, I just thought you might be able to give some more detail.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, he was a very, look, he was a very strong supporter of the zero</p>
<p> tolerance policing methods that have been adopted in the United States</p>
<p> both in relation to the impact they have had on reducing crime, the</p>
<p> quoted figures of where the murder rate in New York had fallen from</p>
<p> something in excess of 2,000 to less than 500. He completely repudiated</p>
<p> the proposition that all that meant was that the problem had been</p>
<p> shifted to another part of the United States. Now, they were his words,</p>
<p> they weren't mine because I asked him that. I said that a criticism</p>
<p> that had been made in Australia in recent days of what had occurred</p>
<p> in New York was that all that had happened was it had been shifted</p>
<p> somewhere else to New Jersey or somewhere else. Now, he said that's</p>
<p> not right. Now, you know, you can argue with him and....I beg your</p>
<p> pardon?</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Has that hardened your resolve?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, it's not a question of a hardening my resolve. When I talked</p>
<p> about zero tolerance I have talked about...well, we have been through</p>
<p> all of this before and I am talking about having a very tough attitude</p>
<p> towards people who deal in drugs, we are talking about a very tough</p>
<p> attitude towards drugs in schools. We do have a zero tolerance approach</p>
<p> towards drugs in schools and I think all State education authorities</p>
<p> ought to and it's my understanding they do and I think it's</p>
<p> a highly desirable approach. Now, as far as policing is concerned</p>
<p> generally that is a separate issue. Now, I am not going to give public</p>
<p> lectures to the various State police forces about how they run things.</p>
<p> But naturally as somebody not only as Prime Minister but as a citizen,</p>
<p> somebody who's interested in a safe and secure community, I'm</p>
<p> naturally impressed when I see a city like New York cut its murder</p>
<p> rate from over 2000 to less than 500. I mean if you have more than</p>
<p> a passing interest you have to sort of ask the odd question and say</p>
<p> how did that come about.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>On a different matter, what influence did the letter from Mr Melrose's</p>
<p> father have on your decision not to meet with Gerry Adams?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I decided not to meet Gerry Adams before I new of Mr Melrose's</p>
<p> letter, or before I received it. But I was certainly reinforced in</p>
<p> that view when I read the letter which I did a few days ago.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>[inaudible] into with the letter?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I beg your pardon.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>What sort of issues did he go into with the letter?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I think you should ask him. I mean it's an intensely traumatic,</p>
<p> difficult, personal, private issue for that family, as it would be</p>
<p> for any of us in that situation. But my decision in relation to Mr</p>
<p> Adams was made some time ago and it was based on the very proper belief</p>
<p> that just because you tolerate the visit of somebody to your country</p>
<p> doesn't mean to say you endorse what he stands for or what he's</p>
<p> done. And I feel very sure that the decision I took in relation to</p>
<p> meeting him was absolutely correct. And I say that as somebody who's</p>
<p> followed the events in Northern Ireland very closely and as somebody</p>
<p> who's full of admiration for the contribution of people like</p>
<p> John Hume and David Trimble to the peace process. They are the people</p>
<p> who are most deserving of praise and esteem for what has been achieved</p>
<p> in Northern Ireland.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>What's his advice on Olympic security Mr Howard?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well we discussed it. I mean you wouldn't expect me to go into</p>
<p> the detail about.....no well I can't say anymore than that.</p>
<p> I mean look he obviously gave some general advice. I mean I have every</p>
<p> confidence in the security arrangements that are being made. I have</p>
<p> a lot of confidence in the Australian security agencies. He spoke</p>
<p> very warmly of the association between the FBI and our security agencies.</p>
<p> And I said that our security agencies were of a very high quality</p>
<p> and I had a lot of confidence in them and a lot of respect for them</p>
<p> as I do for our police. And I said before and I say again that I think</p>
<p> policing in any country is very difficult and the police are deserving</p>
<p> of a lot more understanding and support than they often get.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr Howard [inaudible] cut quite substantially into the budgets of</p>
<p> law enforcement agencies in your first term at a time when heroin</p>
<p> was beginning....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I'm not...I mean we can debate the impact and you know</p>
<p> what I've said before when I've been asked that question</p>
<p> about the quarantining of the impact of cuts that were made in 1996.</p>
<p> The undeniable fact now is that there are more resources available</p>
<p> for the fight against drugs at a national level than ever before in</p>
<p> Australia's history.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, did Judge Freeh say anything...did he say there were</p>
<p> any flaws in the current drug policy we have here?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well he didn't but then it wasn't really his brief to sort</p>
<p> of run the ruler over it. I mean I didn't say, you know, what</p>
<p> do you think of our approach? I asked him questions about the approach</p>
<p> in the United States. I mean he wouldn't presume to get into</p>
<p> that anymore than I would presume if I were visiting the United States</p>
<p> to run the ruler over their approach to a particular thing. I asked</p>
<p> him particular questions about particular issues, and I've given</p>
<p> you a summary of his responses so far as they're pertinent to</p>
<p> the current debate in Australia. But it was a very interesting meeting</p>
<p> and I'm glad I met him.</p>
