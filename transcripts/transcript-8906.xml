YOSTERS-HUAGUANG PCKDATIMCW S7voE-LYMING<br />
SH&amp; NGI SLVM&amp;, 26 JUNE 1993<br />
This ceremony to lay the foundation stone for the Fosters<br />
Shanghai Brewery might be taken as a symbol of<br />
Australia's commercial response to the opportunities and<br />
challenges on offer in Asia.<br />
It is another significant chapter in what is a genuinely<br />
good news story.<br />
It is good news for the two joint venturers:<br />
Huaguang Brewery vill. benefit from their<br />
relationship with one of the world's foremost<br />
brewery operations, the Fosters Brewery Group, and<br />
in particular Carlton and United Breweries.<br />
And Fosters, which is now a truly international<br />
company operating on four continents, have by their<br />
enterprise won a foothold in a very significant<br />
market. Within five years, it could well be<br />
producing as imuch beer in China as it does in<br />
Australia.<br />
This is also a good news story for Australia and for<br />
China. For Australia, because we see one of our companies making<br />
a major investment and a long term commitment in one of<br />
the fastest growing countries in the world.<br />
And for China, because we're seeing world class<br />
technology and quality international backing linking up<br />
with a Chinese partner to meet a market-driven need.<br />
What we are seeing here is a quality international<br />
response to China's new economic policy.<br />
Australia's new economic policy too: because Australia<br />
is encouraging companies to be internationally<br />
competitive, to get out in the world and compete with the<br />
best, and to look to Asia as a place to invest. </p>
<p>Joint ventures like this are good for Australia because<br />
the reord shows that trade invariably follows<br />
investment.<br />
And it is trade and investment linkages of this kind that<br />
will guarantee our share of the economic growth in the<br />
region. So Fosters must be comiended.<br />
And the Huaguang Brewery must be commended: it has<br />
forged a partnership with a company that is not only at<br />
the leading edge of its field, but an internationally<br />
recognised Australian icon.<br />
We look forward with a fair degree of certainty to the<br />
day when Shanghai Fosters is a Chinese icon as well.<br />
All of you deserve our congratulations and I wish you<br />
all the very best in this most significant joint venture,<br />
Shanghai Posters Brewery Limited. </p>
