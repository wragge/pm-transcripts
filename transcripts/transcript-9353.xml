    <content><![CDATA[<p>I am very pleased that the Prime Minister of Singapore, Goh Chok Tong, willÂ be visiting Australia from 12-15 September as a Guest of the Government.Â During his time here, he will visit Canberra, Sydney and Queensland.</p>
<p>Australia's relations with Singapore are close, broad-based and longÂ standing. Singapore is our largest trading partner in ASEAN (total trade wasÂ over $ 5 billion in 1993-94) and our eight largest world-wide. AustralianÂ investment in Singapore is the largest we have in any ASEAN country andÂ Singapore is the largest ASEAN investor in Australia.</p>
<p>We have a particularly close defence relationship with Singapore, notablyÂ through our common membership of the Five Power Defence ArrangementÂ and through an extensive bilateral defence cooperation program.Â We also work together very closely on wider international and regional issuesÂ especially in APEC, where our mutual commitment to an open and liberalÂ multilateral trading system makes us natural partners. Singapore andÂ Australia share a similar vision for the bilateral relationship and of the Asia-Pacific region more broadly.</p>
<p>I look forward to discussing both bilateral issues and important regionalÂ issues with Prime Minister Goh. Of note, we will be looking to advance theÂ strategic linkages initiative which I launched during my visit to Singapore inÂ 1992. The initiative aims to promote links between Australian andÂ Singaporean companies with a view to developing joint businessÂ opportunities in third country markets.</p>
<p>We will also be looking to see how we can further develop our defenceÂ cooperation. On APEC, we will discuss our common interest in ensuring aÂ successful APEC leaders meeting in November in Indonesia under theÂ chairmanship of President Soeharto.</p>
