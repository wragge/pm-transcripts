EOUTH-EAST ASIAN VISIT<br />
TELEVISION BROADCAST-7VE5-Y THE PRIME T4INISTER, THE RT. EON.<br />
WILLIAM McMAJION, C. IH.,<br />
ON ABC NATIONAL TELEVISION NETWORK 18 JUNE, 1972.<br />
Good Evening:<br />
As Prime Minister of Australia, I believe it is my duty to<br />
report to you about my recent mission to Indonesia, Singapore and<br />
Malaysia. My purpose in going was to discuss a wide range of issues of<br />
national and international importance, flowing from the recent<br />
dramatic changes in world affairs. I also wanted to strengthen the<br />
confidence and goodwill between Australia and these three<br />
neighbour nations.<br />
A glance at the map will show how close and important they are<br />
to us. We have growing trade and economic ties with them. We want<br />
to promote their development and economic growth in our and their<br />
long term interests, and we have a common interest in the peace,<br />
defence and security of the environment in which we live.<br />
So I thought it was an opportune time to go because so many<br />
changes have occurred recently which vitally affect the future of<br />
our country. President Nixon's visits to Peking and Moscow have<br />
reduced tension between the great nowers the United States, Soviet<br />
Russia and the People's Renublic of China.<br />
But the dust has not yet settled and the outcome cannot yet be<br />
clearly seen in the Asian theatre.<br />
We do know that despite the great nower accord, North Vietnam<br />
is still irVWlding South Vietnam. Many countries in our region are<br />
under internal threat by subversive elements supported from outside,<br />
and there is increasing competition betw., een the Soviet Union and<br />
China for political influence. All this means that the prospects<br />
for peace and stability in South-East Asia are still uncertain.<br />
If we are to imnrove these prospects for the future, we must<br />
work together to strengthen our economies to become more self--<br />
reliant and to strengthen our defence capabilities.<br />
During my visit, I talked at length with President Soeharto of<br />
Indonesia, Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew of Singapore, Prime Miinister<br />
Tun Razak of Malaysia and with many of their senior Ministers. </p>
<p>2<br />
Mow let us look at each of the three countries I visited.<br />
Indonesia is a country of one hundred and twenty million<br />
people. It is a few hours' flight to our North and is our nearest<br />
neighbour. It is the fifth most populous nation on earth and the<br />
only foreign country with which we share a border.<br />
In the last few years it has made a remarkable recovery<br />
from near anarchy. Substantial assistance was given by us to<br />
Indonesia during this period, and it is in our own interest to<br />
continue to do so.<br />
With President Soeharto, I mapped out a programme for<br />
co-operation in economic, cultural, defence and political matters over<br />
the next few years. I was able to tell the President that the<br />
Australian Government had decided to make a new three-year grant of<br />
$ 69 million for economic aid up to June 1976.<br />
0 As well, our three-year programme for technical and<br />
defence assistance to Indonesia will be increased to help build up<br />
its capability to defend itself. We will provide 16 Sabre fighter<br />
aircraft and we will help the Indonesians equip a military airfield as<br />
the base for them. Te are willing to carry out exercises between<br />
our two Navies. We also agreed to consider ways of expanding trade<br />
and increased investment by Australian companies there.<br />
In the busy, progressive island nation of Singapore,<br />
there is great warmth towards us. As the Prime " inister, Mr Lee<br />
said to me " This isn't the time to be changing friends."<br />
Singapore, as you all know, has strong traditional ties<br />
of friendship and many common interests with us. They want to<br />
co-operate in all kinds of ways.<br />
For twenty years ncw, some 1,00 Siigaporean students<br />
have been studying each year in Australia. And Australians are<br />
visiting Singapore at the rate of over 30,000 a year. S150 million<br />
worth of trade is exchanged between us each year. This trade is<br />
very much in Australia's favour so our two Governments will be<br />
looking at new ways and means of helping Singapore to expand its<br />
trade with Australia. A battalion of our Army and other elements of our<br />
armed forces are stationed there. They will stay there whilst they<br />
are wanted. Our talks showed how close are our interests and our<br />
views on the present world situation and particularly on South-East<br />
Asia and its problems. We both want a negotiated settlement in<br />
Indo-China that will enable the peoples of South Vietnam, Laos and<br />
Cambodia to determine their own future without outside interference.<br />
It was emphasised whilst I was in Singapore how helpful<br />
and stabilising was the role Australia is playing, and how much it<br />
contributes to building confidence and the prospects of development<br />
in the future. / 3 </p>
<p>-3<br />
My last three days were in Malaysia. In Prime Minister<br />
Tun Razak's words " We have been allies-in war arnd peace. And<br />
good steady friends for a long time." This is true..<br />
We are partners in the Commonwealth and--we are linked<br />
as partners in many other ways. There are over 6,000 Malaysian<br />
students in Australia today more than from any other country.<br />
Malaysia has its Second Malaysia Plan a national<br />
economic programme designed to accelerate economic activity and<br />
progress for the malaysian people. It is an ambitious plan in<br />
which Australia is closely interested and involved.<br />
Malaysia is also one of the Principal supporters of<br />
what is known as the Kuala Lumpur Declaration by members of ASEAN<br />
that is, the Association of South-East Asian Nations. The Kuala<br />
Lumpur Declaration is a proposal that South-East Asia should be<br />
a zone of peace, freedom and neutrality.<br />
Australia is not a member of ASENbut we have good<br />
relations with all its members. The goals set out in the Declaration<br />
are fully consistent with my Government's policies if effective<br />
international guarantees can be obtained. And I told Tun Razak we<br />
welcomed the Declaration as an important regional initiative.<br />
I believe our discussions on the Declaration and<br />
the Five Power Defence Arrangements have deepened our understanding<br />
of each other's Policies.<br />
I discussed the Five Power Defence Arrangements with<br />
both Malaysia and Singapore. These Arrangements are working smoothly.<br />
They will remain in full force and effect. I can assure you our<br />
forces are welcomed in both ccuntries.<br />
While I was away, there was some confusion here about the<br />
attitude of Malaysia to the Five Power Arrangements. Let me state the<br />
position in the considered words of the Prime Minister of Malaysia<br />
" The continuing presence of Australian Forces, both land and<br />
air, in Malaysia-Singapore in the context of the arrangements<br />
is welcomed by the Malaysian Government and contributes to<br />
defence and confidence in that area."<br />
Those were his words.<br />
There are no differences whatsoever between Australia<br />
and Malaysia, or between Australia and Singapore, under these<br />
arrangements. The mission was widely and accurately covered by the<br />
local newspapers and television in Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore.<br />
The editorial comments were complimentary and reflected real warmth<br />
towards Australia and Australians.<br />
Looking back, I am sure the mission was a success<br />
and did a great deal to promote our friendships and our standing<br />
among our Asian neighbours. I believe our mission achieved its<br />
objectives that we are welcomed as friends and our policies are<br />
a helpful and stabilising influence in South-East Asia. </p>
