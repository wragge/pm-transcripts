SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE RT. HON. R. G.<br />
MENZIES, AT THE OPENING OF LEGACY lWEEK ON MONDAY,<br />
SEPTEMBER, 1960<br />
Mr. President:<br />
I think it is a very remarkable honour to be invited<br />
by you to open " Legacy deek" a great honour. But in one<br />
sense a very easy thing to do because I think most people now<br />
in Australia I would have hoped all people in Australia<br />
regard Legacy as one of the finest things in our r. oderrp history<br />
in Australia. It seems almost fantastic to me to look at the<br />
Notice Paper and to see that it was founded only in 1923 by<br />
your old friend and my old friend, Stan Savige one of the<br />
finest Australians of our time and in 37 years it has<br />
established itself as something, I think, quite unique.<br />
We are all prutty good when we are in the right mood<br />
at explaining to other people what our rights are, what would<br />
be done for us if only justice wore done. I must not make an<br />
exception of myself in that connection, because if justice were<br />
done to me, I probably wouldn't be horo, at any rate in my<br />
present capacity; but it is true that most people who give<br />
service to their country create intheir country very properly,<br />
a aense of obligation, and occasionally may be disposed to<br />
emphasise the nature of that obligation. That is inevitable,<br />
quite understandable, and indeed, in a groat number of cases,<br />
most proper. But this organisation is unique an organisation<br />
of people who have, on the basis of their service to their<br />
country, accepted and poeformed addicional obligations whieb<br />
they regard as arising out of that service. That is a very<br />
remarkable thing, and all of us who have watched the work of<br />
Legacy through all those years never ooaso to be thankful that<br />
such a spirit should have found embodiment in-so many people.<br />
A legacy. dhen one talks of a legacy a little<br />
hopefully occasionally, it indicates an idea that we are going<br />
to get something in cash or in kind. e are going to be at the<br />
receiving end. Most people think of a legacy in that sense.<br />
There are not too many people who think of a legacy in another<br />
sense. It is a cant phrase to talk about certain evil things<br />
in the world being a legacy of wi~ r. t has been left to this<br />
body, almost alone in the world as far as I know, to regard this<br />
legacy of war as something which imposes upon it a great trust<br />
for other people, and an obligation to do things for other<br />
people. This is a brilliant use of this word, and it is a very<br />
fine thing for thousands and thousands of people that you<br />
should have thought of it in that way.<br />
e live in a time when people look to Governments<br />
more and more for almost everything and because people elect<br />
Members of Parliament, Members of Parliaent are under an<br />
obligation to give effect broadly to lha the poople wanc; and<br />
more and more over the course of rc ont years in Aus uralia<br />
the last 20 years in Australia the position has boon that<br />
Governments are expected to perform more things, and do, in<br />
fact, perform more.<br />
I was reminding another audience yesterday that when<br />
I was first Prime Minister, which, believe it or not, isover<br />
years ago now, the total Social Services bill of the<br />
Commonwealth was œ 17m. and this year it is œ 330m. Now this,<br />
of course, indicates how more and more Governments are to make<br />
provision for people in the country who need it. But the thing<br />
to remember is that Governments can act only in the broad.<br />
They, so to speak, deal with human problems by vholosale; they<br />
establish a rate of pension; they establish statutory<br />
conditions for a man or a woman getting that pension. These<br />
rules have to be hard rules, precise rules, because you can't </p>
<p>have Social Services paid out by the Govorncont according to<br />
the whim of individuals at any point of distribution and,<br />
therefore, you have the broad swoop of the law. Injustices<br />
nust happen in individual cases, but that is unavoidable if you<br />
are going to have a body of rules laid down which will, in the<br />
broad, do the highest comron measure of justice that Parliament<br />
thinks appropriate, You are not in the wholesale business. You are doing<br />
something which no Government could do if it had all the<br />
goodwill in the world and all the money in the world. You are<br />
dealing with people, not as icembers of a group, not as one<br />
person out of a million who must be dealt with according to<br />
the rules that apply to the rest of the million: you are<br />
dealing with individual cases with humanity with knowledge,<br />
with a capacity to select, with a capacity to understand how to<br />
deal with this individual widow or this individual child: ho-"<br />
to do something which will help this particular boy or this<br />
particular girl to be educated, to be trained for something.<br />
This is a tremendously human task, and it can be dealt with only<br />
by looking at individuals and dealing with them on their merits<br />
so that you don't have to say, and you have no desire to say,<br />
" Well, there is a broad rule here and it doesn't fit this case,<br />
but it is just too bad. iJe have the broad rule and it is<br />
unalterable." The groat essence of Legacy, to my mind, as a man<br />
watching its work, has been its capacity for selecting the<br />
individual for individual treatment, and this is something that<br />
no Government department can , o.<br />
I an not among those who criticise Civil Servants.<br />
There are an awful lot of thoe about, and no doubt a fair number<br />
of you here today are, or have been, Civil Servants. The Civil<br />
Service in this country consists of an honourable body of men,<br />
of a level of capacity not inferior to the loval of capacity in<br />
other undertakirn. Lot us not be too quick on the draw when we<br />
are dealing with the Civil Service; but the Civil Service can't<br />
do what you are doing. It must act under the rule. It iust act<br />
according to the book, and if it didn't act according to the<br />
book we would be in strife. But you are able to do the things<br />
that the Civil Service can't do.<br />
We have many departlments, if you will allow me to<br />
repeat something that I have said before today. There is no<br />
" Departient of Loving Kindness", and there cannot be " Minister<br />
for Loving Kindness". " Permanent Secretary to the Department<br />
of Loving Kindness". Dear mel The first thing that would<br />
happen would be that someone iown the line would say: " But look,<br />
I must have the book of the words. What are the rules of loving<br />
kindness?" and you let us -et to work defining the rules of<br />
loving kindness: we'll have a magnificent body of rules, but<br />
there won't be any loving kindness. This is something that no<br />
Government can provide for you. As individuals we're really<br />
quite a soft-hearted lot. You'd be surprised. But wo cannot<br />
dispense loving kindness as you dispense a pension or a benefit<br />
under some Act of Parliament. And therefore, Sir, I am a groat<br />
believer in Legacy. I think it is quite unique. I hope that<br />
in this Appeal that is going out this week, you will raise at<br />
least twice as much as in your wildest dreams you hope to, And,<br />
indeed, if it becomes adequately known in Australia that this<br />
Appeal is on, I want to tell you that I believe there will be a<br />
response in the hearts and minds of people that will astonish<br />
you. I wouldn't be too modest in what you are looking for;<br />
wouldn't be too modest in what you tell people about what your<br />
work is, because this is the groetest humane operation conducted<br />
by individual private citizens, nost of whom. might say quite<br />
well: J1ll, I've done my share. I've done my tour of<br />
duty. Let somebody else look after this. </p>
<p>3.<br />
after this. Let the Governmuont look after this. This is a<br />
magnificent hoart-waring thing.<br />
Now, the only other thing I want to say to you,<br />
though it nay take a little time, is this: Australia is one<br />
country. It is in its way a sort of microcosm of the world.<br />
What happens here is happening in oe form or anotho-in mot<br />
other countries. What you are doing here the riatter that 1<br />
have beeoon talking about provides. i ny opinion, a koy to<br />
some of the great problnems now current in the world Ill tell<br />
you one, because we discussed it a great d'al when I was in<br />
London at the Prime Minis hors! Conforence,<br />
I can go back to a time when we sat thoere five of<br />
us Great Britain, Canad, South Africa, new Zhaiand, ! AustYrlit<br />
We didn't disagroee about very uch; we had an agreCable series<br />
of talks with each other. All that now, numerically, is change.<br />
4e havencw nations, formorly colonies, becoming : eCobors of the<br />
Comnonwealth every year. Ghana appearod for the first time<br />
three years back. . ost Indies well on the way. TigerLa<br />
will certainly be at the next Prire Ministors' Conferenco,<br />
There are discussions going on u Malt. You know all th<br />
discussion that's going on about thc Contral African Eopublic<br />
of Rhodesia and Nyasaland on which the Monckton Coru: iission has<br />
just booeen sitting? lie have Kenya; Tanganyi'ka, i-have the<br />
vexed probln of the future of South Africa, should South<br />
Africa become a Republic. You can hardly set a li. mit to the<br />
dovelopont that is going on in the world a pol--cll<br />
development. It's soothing that nobody visualisod even five<br />
years ago, the speed with which now nati:&gt; ns are coming irntu<br />
existence. There night very well bc 20 or 24 seeking _ oDborshi-p<br />
of the Cor. onwealth or holding emonborship of the Commonwealth<br />
inside five yors fron now. Now this mons that we are living<br />
nor and moro in a different w'rorld, The tiy'. e has ) noe by Then<br />
we can just look at South Africa at Africa, rathor, to use<br />
the entire continent when we could talk about Africa and say:<br />
" Oh, yes," a feiw cliches you know " Darkest Africa", or " I<br />
wonder what is going on in the Congo", or " How is tl-he diamond<br />
industry?" and all this kind of thing. The fact is that in<br />
these years, and it will continue country after c -untry, sono<br />
of the very nanes of which we will not have heard before, are<br />
coming into existence and, of course, one of the facts of life<br />
is that when an agitation bodins in any country for selfgovernont<br />
and it is powerfully led, led with fire and<br />
imagination by some leaders, it gro'rs. It grows on itself. 7t<br />
accelerates its spcod and all the chancos are that the country<br />
i-ight find itself with political indopendonce ' hen econ-1omically<br />
it cannot survive off its own resourcos or its efffno rts,<br />
This is a groeat problem of our tine intornationally how we<br />
are to act so that political indepondenco with all its<br />
implications for friendship . nd alliance aroundu the world can<br />
be nmatched with econonic indopondence, with a gonuine capacity<br />
to survive out of local resources. Woll, some time ag. o we had<br />
a shot at this. It ought to be romombored here roith so:.: e pride that<br />
just as Australia wias the c untry that croated Loeacy, so<br />
Australia was the country that pro.. ated the Colombo Plan, and<br />
we have at all tines booeen active contributors to the Colonbo<br />
Plan not just to mTake gPood follows of ourselves. You don't<br />
do your work in Legacy to mnake good follows of yoursolves: you<br />
do it with both eyes on the end result, the end result being<br />
the helping of somobody to live a fuller and freer and better<br />
life. And similarly, when uw) ive aid internationally we -uss<br />
be vastly careful to soee we are not doing it to be just " good<br />
follows", not doing it just to advertiso some goods, hut that<br />
we are doing it because wo realise that a rise in the econom! ic<br />
standards, a rise in the standard of living of these neol,<br />
I </p>
<p>countries that have cone to political indopondenco is the one<br />
thing that will not only do justirc to their people, but enable<br />
then to maintain their independence and to resist the onset of<br />
the strange, nad doctrines of Communism. The best defence<br />
for them against Conmunism, against any other form of w'hat I<br />
will call disorder, is that they should develop their own<br />
strength, that their people should look forward to a rising<br />
standard of living, generation by generation.<br />
Now that imposos a tromndous obligation on the<br />
nations of tho free world, just as you said, and this is all in<br />
parallel. It isn't' sufficient to have won a war or helped to<br />
win one. It is now our obligation to help others who have<br />
suffered in consequence of that; so it isn't sufficient for<br />
the nations of the free -world to say: " Well, we won this war.<br />
We nay now attend to our own business. Just too bad if you<br />
people down there or out there are not doing too well, but<br />
charity begins at hore: o we're going to build up our own<br />
strengths we're going to go around telling each other how high<br />
our standard of living is." It is very nice to be able to do<br />
that, but there will be no peace for the world if more than half<br />
the people of the world are living under circu-istances i; which<br />
the glories of political independence have become croplotol:<br />
Dead Sea fruit-have proved to be nothing but a misleading<br />
circumstance because in their own homos and in their own lives<br />
freedom is not accompanied by a rise in the standards of life,<br />
Now, the United States of Al'erica has, I thin':,<br />
faced up to this responsibility magnificontly not to get<br />
thanks, because she hasn't had many thanks; not to buy some<br />
smile from sonebody, because you can't buy that kind of thing<br />
but because I genuinely believe that the people of the United<br />
States who pay the piper for these enormous grants in aid, have<br />
realised that the power which is theirs after e. merging<br />
victoriously from two wars must be accompanied by a sense of<br />
responsibility. They, theseolves, have accepted that particular<br />
legacy of war in the sense in which I used it in relation to you<br />
earlier; but it doesn't end there,<br />
Wet must all do more and moreo: won't always be very<br />
popular. Thereo's always somobody who's able to say: 1" Well,<br />
look at the m,. ney you spend on Colombo Aid. Look at the money<br />
you spend in relation t. the other powers of South-east Asian<br />
Treaty Organisation. Look at tohe oney that you lay out on the<br />
various Agencies of the United Nations. ! hy, if we didn't<br />
spend that abroad, think of the houses we could put up in our<br />
own country: think of all the slum clearances that could be<br />
facilitated. Let us look after ourselves." If every nation in<br />
the world, which is now a free nation, decided that from now on<br />
it would look after itself each for itself and the devil take<br />
the hindnost the world would be tumbling into the most<br />
frightful catastrophe of history before we're 20 years older.<br />
The whole condition of survival is that the new nations should<br />
be made to feel that they have our sympathCtic, individual<br />
interest, our desire to help, our desire to build them up,<br />
There's one aspect of that which I have mentioned once before<br />
publicly, but which I propose to mention wherever I have the<br />
opportunity, and it's this: It was pointed out rather<br />
yaphically at the last Prime Ministers' Conference by Mr. Nehru<br />
himself in a very thoughtful speech. After all, if there's<br />
one man in the world who can speak about countries a. chieving<br />
independence and about their probles, it is hru himself,<br />
with this enormous country of his own full of economic problems,<br />
and, of course, now with intornational problems of a rather<br />
unforeseen kind; but he pointed this out, and it bit itself<br />
into my mind. We talk about this country being one of the " haves"<br />
and that country being one of the " have nots". You reuember<br />
that before this last war there used to be great discussions </p>
<p>going on Jtbout the atti~ udo of Germ.-an.-because wo had coLonics<br />
