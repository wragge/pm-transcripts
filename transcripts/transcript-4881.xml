6 NOVEMBER 1978<br />
PRIME MINISTER'S INTERVIEW OUTSIDE THSURY PLACE, MELBOURNE<br />
PRIME MINIER: I haven't decided for the moment which horse<br />
to back, I will have to study it this evening.<br />
QUESTION: If the States are allowed to borrow such large sums<br />
of money overseas, what is to stop another burst of inflation?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: You need to, you are preempting a decision of tke<br />
Loan Council to start with, but you are also, I think, forgetting<br />
that the borrowings will be over a period of eight or nine years,<br />
and they need to be seen, therefore, in the context of<br />
Australia's normal borrowing requirement. The Commonwealth has<br />
said very plainly we have got a responsibility for managing the<br />
economy, for managing the money supply and therefore tle decision<br />
of the Loan Council in these matters needs to be one in which<br />
there is a simple majority of which tle Commonwalth is a part.<br />
We are not going to take decisions which will jeorpardise<br />
Budget decisions or Budget strategies.<br />
The fact that this meeting was coming up was well in our minds<br />
when we were forming our own 1udget decisions. But, while the<br />
overall sum might appear to be large, the totality of what the<br />
States have asked for this year is about $ 150m and that b~ ings<br />
it down within the area in which it can be seen that it is not<br />
inflationary, and self-evidently I wouldbelieve, by and large,<br />
a responsible set of pnposals. That is not preempting any<br />
attitude in relation to specific ones but a responsible set of<br />
propo,. als designed to add to the strength of Austmlia's basic<br />
industries, infra structure, export capacity, matters that will<br />
build up the basic strength of the economy of Australia.<br />
That is tiv substance of the guidelines, that is the purpose of<br />
the programme, and we have had some hard-won gains against inflation<br />
there is no way we are going to prejudice that with any po] icy.<br />
QUESTION: The Labor Party says it will repudiate agreements<br />
on uranium if they get into power. How can you guarantee investors<br />
who might be pouring money into<br />
PRIME MINISTER: They are not going to get into power, and the<br />
Labor Party is just becoming the Party of knockers.<br />
But it was Mr Uren who~ said that and I don't think Mr Uren has<br />
has got any reason to speak for the Australian Labor Paity in<br />
relation to those particular issues-., On these infra-structure<br />
proposals for example, we have had Mr Hayden saying one tling,<br />
saying that the borrowing reqirements shouldn't be pursued,<br />
and we have had Senator Wreidt and I think Mr Hurford saying that<br />
the agreements should be made in full. So They are in a great deal<br />
of disarray, and nobody need be concerned abbut any statement<br />
that Mr Uren made he will never again be given an opportuity<br />
to apply it.<br />
