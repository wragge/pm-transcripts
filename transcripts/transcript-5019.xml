FOR PRESS 15 APRIL 1979<br />
ELECTORATE TALK<br />
To people around the world, Australia appears to be the lucky<br />
country. We are a resourceful and talented people. We have<br />
abundant farmland. We are one of the great rural producers.<br />
* We have mineral resources that the the envy of the world and<br />
vast reserves of oil and gas.<br />
Australia, too, is fortunate to have a stable political structure,<br />
and we are moving to a sound economic base. What then can hold<br />
Australia back? The opportunities are surely great.<br />
I often think that in our day-to-day living, in our desire to<br />
try and make a better life for ourselves and our families, we<br />
sometimes seem to forget that above all we are Australians.<br />
Too often we see ourselves simply as " politicians",* or " bosses",<br />
or " unionists", or " truck drivers", or " teachers" or as members<br />
of one political party or another. We forget we are all part<br />
of one community, one nation.<br />
This blinkered view of our role in the community can lock us<br />
in to fixed positions and narrow thinking. It makes it very<br />
difficult to sort out problems and achieve a true consensus.<br />
The problem is compounded when leaders from all walks of life<br />
become locked into constituencies which expect certain responses.<br />
This reduces the scope for change, for compromise and for<br />
discussion. Look at some of the things concerning management, unions and<br />
government... . things like penalty rates and wage systems.<br />
Why did it take so long for people to sit down together on<br />
this, at the National Labour Consultative Council? Why did<br />
it take so long to get that first step on a question that<br />
ultimately affects every Australian family? The need to break<br />
down the rigidity in industrial relations is one of Tony Street's<br />
wider responsibilities. He's working to build an environment<br />
in which disputes are less likely, rather than to merely react<br />
to disputes as they occur. Again, it's a matter of unlocking<br />
ourselves from fixed and rigid positions.<br />
The structure of the union movement in Australia is something<br />
that affects every Australian not just rank-and-file unionists.<br />
It is Government policy, ACTU policy and Labor Party-policy to<br />
move towards industry based unions. But the entrenched power of<br />
officials in craft structured unions makes such a move very<br />
difficult. / 2 </p>
<p>2<br />
The belief that our interests are competing interests State<br />
against Commonwealth, State against State, management against<br />
unions and country against city is perhaps the greatest<br />
inhibition to building an even greater nation.<br />
The true interests of Australians are not competitive, they<br />
are complementary. If an industry is more profitable, it<br />
can sell more of its goods employers benefit and Australia<br />
benefits. Then farmers make profit, country towns come alive<br />
and that flows through to the city factories and service<br />
industries.<br />
When we take pride in Australian products, we buy Australian,<br />
we support our own people throughout Australia. In their<br />
hearts I believe that Australians have an intense sense of<br />
patriotism, loyalty and love for our country. But we don't<br />
often speak about it. We rarely articulate it in any form except<br />
perhaps when we return from overseas when we hear people say<br />
" I wouldn't live anywhere else"<br />
In that sense, we are often our worst enemies by talking<br />
ourselves down or selling ourselves short.<br />
In 200 years Australians have achieved great things. We have<br />
built a great nation. But by constantly remembering that we<br />
are Australians first and last we can make this country as<br />
others see it the lucky country. </p>
