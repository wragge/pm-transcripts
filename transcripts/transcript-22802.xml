    <content><![CDATA[<p>From 4 to 8 July I will join former Prime Ministers, as well as serving Premiers, Chief Ministers and others, in a visit to the United Kingdom to mark the centenary of the passage through the British Parliament of the Act which created the Commonwealth of Australia and for bilateral discussions with the British Government.</p>
<p>The United Kingdom is a major partner for Australia across the full range of our interests. The strength of the relationship is underpinned by our deep historical and people-to-people ties. The visit will highlight both the shared history of two independent nations and the continued importance and contemporary relevance of the enduring links between our two countries. For example, the United Kingdom is the largest foreign investor in Australia.</p>
<p>My visit is timed to coincide with Australia Week in London, which marks the centenary of passage of the Act of the Parliament which created the Commonwealth of Australia and thus laid the foundation of the modern Australian nation. Australia Week features a very wide-ranging programme of commemorative activities representing the diverse aspects of the modern bilateral relationship, covering the arts, business and our shared history. Parliament, the Lord Mayor and the City of London, and Westminster Abbey are among the many partners who will participate in this unique celebration.</p>
<p>An outline of my London programme is attached. The substantial programme of events commemorating the centenary of Australiaâs federation will include:</p>
<p>Â· a ceremony hosted by the Lord Chancellor and the Speaker of the House of Commons, in the Royal Gallery at Westminster;</p>
<p>Â· a thanksgiving service for Australia at Westminster Abbey; and</p>
<p>Â· a function hosted by the Lord Mayor of London at the Guildhall.</p>
<p>In recognition of the national significance of this occasion I am pleased that I will be joined in the celebrations to mark the passage of the Act creating the Commonwealth of Australia by: former Prime Ministers Gorton, Fraser, Whitlam and Hawke; the Premiers of New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland, South Australia and Tasmania and the Chief Ministers of the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory; the Speaker and the President of the Senate; the Leader of the National Party, Mr Anderson; the Leader of the Australian Democrats, Senator Lees; and the Chief Justice of the High Court.</p>
<p>In my discussions with Prime Minister Blair and key members of the UK government and business community I will be seeking to build on our strong links and shared interests, as well as covering key international issues of mutual interest.</p>
<p>The United Kingdom and Australia have been long-standing and close partners in pursuit of global security and democracy. Most recently, Australia has deeply appreciated the active and early UK support in resolving the situation in East Timor and my visit will provide me with an opportunity to thank Mr Blair personally for this.</p>
<p>My programme in London will also reinforce the significant commercial and investment links between our two countries. As well as being the largest foreign investor in Australia, the United Kingdom is our sixth-largest trading partner. It is by far our largest market in the European Union. In 1999 the United Kingdom was Australiaâs eighth-largest export market, with Australian exports amounting to $3.7 billion, and total two-way trade amounting to $9.1 billion that year. In 1999 the United Kingdom was the second-largest destination for Australian foreign investment.</p>
<p>I will also be using my visit to promote Australiaâs economic strengths and its potential as a major regional financial centre to British business.</p>
<p>As part of this, I will be addressing senior financial decision-makers, meeting leading UK business people and participating in a breakfast meeting of fund managers organised by the Macquarie Bank.</p>
<p>My programme also includes a number of events marking our extensive educational, cultural and other ties with the United Kingdom, including attending a function for alumni of Sydney University and addressing a conference of historians examining the partnership between Australia and the United Kingdom over the past century.</p>
