NATIONAL WAGE HEARING<br />
The doors cf the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission<br />
should always be open and be seen to be open. Members of<br />
the workforce with a case to present should be able to feel<br />

before the Com. mission will be fruitless. The Government is<br />
anxious that this feeling should be dispelled.<br />

appropriate opportunity for parties to put their views on<br />
