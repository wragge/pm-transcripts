PARLIAMENTARY STATEMENT BY<br />
THE PRIME MINISTERel<br />
VISITS TO NEW CALEDONIA, 7<br />
THE SOUTH PACIFIC FORUM,<br />
PAPUA NEW GUINEA AND JAPAN,<br />
TUESDAY 9 OCTOBER 1gg91<br />
Mr Speaker<br />
I seek leave t~ o report to the House on f our important visits<br />
I have undertaken recently within the Asia-Pacific region:<br />
to New Caledonia between 27 and 29 July; to the South<br />
Pacific Forum held in Port Vila, Vanuatu from 30 July to 1<br />
August; to Papua New Guinea between 2 and 6 September; and<br />
to Japan between 16 and 20 September.<br />
The South Pacific Forum is the pre-eminent regional body<br />
which brings together each year leaders from Australia, New<br />
Zealand and the Pacific Island countries. New Caledonia<br />
lies within our immediate region, while Papua New Guinea is<br />
not only Australia's closest neighbour, but is a country<br />
with which we share important historical, economic and<br />
strategic interests. Japan is, of course, one of the<br />
world's great economic powers and our relationship with it<br />
is one of Australia's most vital.<br />
While each visit raised important issues of its own, a<br />
number of recurring and complementary themes emerged from<br />
this intensive: period of regional contact.<br />
For instance, in Tokyo I pursued with Prime Minister Kaifu<br />
and his Ministers Australia's concern to see decisive<br />
movement in the Uruguay Round negotiations, which are about<br />
to enter their final stage. I urged Japan to show true<br />
leadership, and thus exert pressure on the other majors<br />
the EC and the United States by further liberalising<br />
import controls on agricultural products, especially rice<br />
not because Australia itself is a significant rice producer<br />
on a world scale, but because such a step would have<br />
far-reaching symbolic importance at this vital stage of the<br />
Uruguay Round negotiations.<br />
These negotiations are of real importance to all countries<br />
around the world, especially to those of our South Pacific<br />
and South East. Asian neighbours belonging to the Cairns<br />
Group. Japan acknowledges the fact that the Uruguay Round<br />
negotiations will fail unless vital matters relating to<br />
agriculture are sensibly addressed. </p>
<p>Similarly, leaders at the South Pacific Forum expressed<br />
satisfaction with the progress made over the past twelve<br />
months in mobilising support against the obnoxious practice<br />
of drift-net fishing and urged other countries to become<br />
party to the Wellington Convention. I was able to take that<br />
message personally to Japan, which has suspended drift-net<br />
fishing operations in the South Pacific. I told Japan's<br />
leaders that the suspension was welcome in the region but<br />
that our goal remained and rightly so a world-wide ban.<br />
Also against the background of my attendance at the South<br />
Pacific Forum and of my visit to Papua New Guinea, I was<br />
able to urge Japan to expand its constructive investment and<br />
development assistance in the region; the Island economies<br />
are in need of it, and it is important that major donors<br />
such as Australia and Japan maintain close and continuing<br />
dialogue. Let me now report in turn on each of my visits.<br />
NewCaledonia The visit to New Caledonia at the invitation of Prime<br />
Minister Rocard was the first to the territory by an<br />
Australian Prime Minister since Mr Robert Menzies in 1941.<br />
My program included meetings with Mr Louis Le Pensec, the<br />
French Minister for Overseas Departments and Territories,<br />
and with New Caledonian political leaders, including the<br />
President of the Territorial Congress, and leaders of the<br />
Southern, Northern and Loyalty Islands provinces. I also<br />
had discussions with the Mayor of Noumea, with the President<br />
of the FLNKS, Mr Neaoutyine, and the widow of the<br />
assassinated former President of the FLNKS, Madam Tjibaou.<br />
I was thus able to have discussions with a very wide range<br />
of New Caledonian leaders, representative of the political<br />
spectrum. I was greatly impressed by the positive and constructive<br />
change in New Caledonia that has followed the signing of the<br />
Matignon Accords. All those involved in the Matignon<br />
process President Mitterrand and Prime Minister Rocard,<br />
the independentist groups, and those who want a continuing<br />
constitutional link with France deserve great credit for<br />
the way in which they have set aside old animosities and are<br />
working together to broaden New Caledonia's economic and<br />
political base. This will allow a genuine act of self<br />
determination to be made in 1998, leading to a viable longterm<br />
political status for the territory.<br />
I offered Australia's continuing help in this process,<br />
including assistance in training young New Caledonians,<br />
broadening our economic links and encouraging, where we can,<br />
New Caledonia's links with the wider Pacific community. </p>
<p>I made it clear that, notwithstanding differences of policy<br />
over French nuclear testing and over the EC's agricultural<br />
policies differences which I restated and whatever the<br />
outcome in New Caledonia, Australia believes that France has<br />
a constructive and welcome political, cultural and economic<br />
role to play in this part of the world.<br />
At the South Pacific Forum I was able to brief other leaders<br />
about my visit to New Caledonia. This was very much<br />
welcomed because, as Honourable Members will know, it<br />
remains an issue of great interest throughout the region.<br />
South Pac-ific-Forum<br />
As is my practice at Forum meetings, I was able to have<br />
valuable bilateral discussions with a range of South Pacific<br />
leaders, including with Prime Minister Lini of Vanuatu and<br />
Ratu Mara of Fiji.<br />
The Forum demonstrated again its practical relevance to the<br />
needs and concerns of the Pacific states. A wide range of<br />
regional issues was discussed in the usual frank and<br />
informal way, Including matters relating to the environment,<br />
fisheries and regional multilateral organisations.<br />
In particular, the United States Government's plans to<br />
dispose of chemical weapons stocks at the facility it has<br />
constructed on Johnston Atoll was the subject of<br />
understandably lively debate. Some Island leaders expressed<br />
concern for the safety aspects of the project. Others were<br />
concerned that the Pacific was coming to be seen as a<br />
dumping ground for the industrial waste of developed<br />
countries. I put to my colleagues Australia's view that the Johnston<br />
facility would help to resolve a serious existing<br />
environmental problem the deterioration of the stock of<br />
chemical weapons on Johnston Atoll and would also help rid<br />
the world of these devastating weapons by making more<br />
possible the comprehensive global ban on their construction<br />
and use, for which Australia has worked so hard.<br />
Let me say that I reject totally the absurd notion being<br />
peddled by some that the destruction of chemical. weapons on<br />
Johnston Atoll is somehow akin to the ñ nsññ ng of nuclear<br />
devices at Mururoa.<br />
I agreed fully with all Forum leaders that the Pacific<br />
should not become a waste dump, and that once the weapons at<br />
present on the island, those that may be found elsewhere in<br />
the region, and those being transhipped from Europe, were<br />
destroyed, the facility should be closed down. We welcomed,<br />
therefore, the United States Government assurance that it<br />
had no plans to extend the life of the facility beyond its<br />
current programo. We also welcomed the United States' offer<br />
to discuss the facility in detail with Forum leaders and a<br />
delegation has since held useful talks in Washington. </p>
<p>Papua New Guinea<br />
The visit, which included discussions with Prime Minister<br />
Namaliu and his Ministers, Opposition Leader Wingti and with<br />
a range of Provincial and business leaders, was the most<br />
extensive undertaken to Papua New Guinea by an Australian<br />
Prime Minister since 1976. As well as Port Moresby, I<br />
visited Mount Hagen, Madang and Rabaul. The welcome at each<br />
of those provincial centres was nothing short of<br />
overwhelming, and symbolised in the most dramatic and<br />
colourful of ways the great depth of the relationship<br />
between our two countries.<br />
The relationship with Papua New Guinea remains one of our<br />
most important. Papua New Guinea is the largest recipient<br />
of Australia's bilateral aid; it is the fourth largest<br />
export market for Australia's manufactured products; it is<br />
our sixth largest overseas investment destination, with<br />
total net investments of about $ 1.8 billion, a figure which<br />
could exceed well in excess of $ 4 billion if major resource<br />
projects in Papua New Guinea proceed as planned. Over<br />
11,000 Australians reside in Papua New Guinea and, over the<br />
past decade, some 2,000 Papua New Guineans have studied here<br />
under Australian Government scholarships and training<br />
awards. Since 1983 my Government has worked hard to develop<br />
constructively and positively the relationship with our<br />
nearest neighbour. In December 1987 I signed with then<br />
Prime Minister Wingti the landmark Joint Declaration of<br />
Principles. In May last year I signed with Prime Minister<br />
Namaliu a Five Year Development Assistance Agreement.<br />
During my visit to Port Moresby an Agreement for the<br />
Protection and Promotion of Investment was signed.<br />
The Joint Declaration of Principles spelled out that the<br />
relationship between Australia and Papua New Guinea is one<br />
between two independent nations each responsible for its own<br />
destiny. A fundamental purpose of my visit to Papua New<br />
Guinea at this time was to underline this simple but vital<br />
fact, the significance of which is still sometimes not fully<br />
grasped and understood in parts of Papua New Guinea,<br />
Australia and elsewhere.<br />
Throughout my visit, I stressed that Australia had no wish<br />
to intervene in solving Papua New Guinea's problems. If<br />
effective solutions are to be found, they must be solutions<br />
which emerge from within Papua New Guinea and are<br />
implemented by Papua New Guineans. It is neither possible<br />
nor desirable to turn the clock back. I also said it was<br />
important that the relationship between the two countries be<br />
taken forward very much within the context of the economic<br />
dynamism of the Asia-Pacific region and that Australia<br />
looked forward to the time when Papua New Guinea could<br />
itself become a member of APEC. </p>
<p>The totality, of my message was well understood and, indeed,<br />
welcomed by Papua New Guinea's leadership. For his part,<br />
Prime Minister Namaliu said that his Government wanted to<br />
speed up the: shift in the balance of our aid program away<br />
from budget support and towards the more usual project<br />
support, with a view to the former being phased out by the<br />
end of this decade. I welcomed that goal and officials from<br />
the two countries will be taking the matter forward in the<br />
lead-up to the scheduled 1992 review of the current<br />
Development Assistance Agreement.<br />
None of this means that Australia is walking away from Papua<br />
New Guinea. Both countries are too important to each other<br />
for that to be allowed to happen, and it is clear from my<br />
Government's actions over the past seven years that is not<br />
our policy. Australia and Papua New Guinea remain enduring<br />
friends and committed partners.<br />
Honourable Members will be aware of the enormous problems<br />
faced by Papua New Guinea over the past 18 months, the most<br />
significant of which have, of course, been those on<br />
Bougainville and the subsequent closure of the BCL Mine at<br />
Panguna. That closure led, in one blow, to Papua New Guinea losing<br />
37% of its export income and 17% of its budget revenue. The<br />
requirement for fundamental adjustment on the part of the<br />
Papua New Guinean Government and its people was obvious.<br />
Throughout my visit I was struck by the realistic<br />
appreciation and acceptance of the challenge. There was no<br />
attempt to turn away from it or to pretend that it was not<br />
there. And, to date, this attitude has been reflected in<br />
the implementation by the Papua New Guinean Government of<br />
the Structural Adjustment Program agreed with the World Bank<br />
and the IMF, and in which Australia has played a significant<br />
role. Prime Minister Namaliu and his Ministers and the<br />
people of Papua New Guinea are to be congratulated for this<br />
realistic commitment.<br />
The problem of Bougainville does, of course, remain. In my<br />
discussions iLn Port Moresby, I reiterated the Australian<br />
Government's position that Bougainville should remain an<br />
integral part of Papua New Guinea and that we fully support<br />
the Papua New Guinean Government's commitment to a political<br />
solution. I also reiterated our willingness to assist in<br />
the rehabilit~ ation of Bougainville once an agreement has<br />
been worked out.<br />
I raised agai~ n the Australian Government's concern about<br />
reported human rights abuses, both by the Papua New Guinean<br />
authorities and the Bougainville Revolutionary Army. In<br />
this context, I am disappointed that Bougainville leaders<br />
have, to date-, declined the offer by the Papua New Guinean<br />
Government to invite an outside body to investigate<br />
allegations involving both sides. </p>
<p>Prime Minister Namaliu and his Ministers outlined frankly<br />
the problem confronting Papua New Guinea in law and order, a<br />
problem impinging on Australians themselves living in Papua<br />
New Guinea and a problem which, if left unchecked, would<br />
complicate the task of attracting much needed foreign<br />
investment. We agreed to examine the challenges confronting<br />
Papua New Guinea in the 1990s, with a view to determining<br />
how best the authorities there might meet the challenges and<br />
how Australia might best assist. It is planned that both<br />
sides will be in a position to pursue discussions further<br />
once the initial studies have been completed by the end of<br />
October. Lastly, I discussed with Prime Minister Naxnaliu the<br />
heartening progress which has been made on the vital work of<br />
reforming Papua New Guinea's Constitution to allow the<br />
maintenance of more stable parliamentary majorities between<br />
elections. Mr Speaker, we should not forget that, while Papua New<br />
Guinea faces a complicated mix of problems, it is also a<br />
country rich in resources, both material and human. My<br />
visit to the Porgera gold mine and my talks with many Papua<br />
New Guineans from all walks of life around the provinces,<br />
gave me ample evidence of that. With determined leadership<br />
and with continued assistance, from Australia and its other<br />
friends, there is no reason to believe that Papua New Guinea<br />
cannot realise its significant potential.<br />
Melbourne's bid for the 1996 Olympics occupied the first two<br />
days of my visit to Japan. Honourable Members are, of<br />
course, aware of the outcome of that bid. Atlanta is to be<br />
congratulated and I am sure its people will stage a most<br />
successful Games to mark the centenary of the modern<br />
Olympics. At the same time, all Australians should feel<br />
immensely proud with the effort made on their behalf by the<br />
Melbourne Olympic Committee and by the many people,<br />
including the Leader of the Opposition, who put in so much<br />
effort to secure the Games. That the bid was not successful<br />
was not, in any way, a reflection on their effort and<br />
dedication or on the excellence of the bid itself.<br />
My two days of discussions in Tokyo encompassed talks with<br />
Prime Minister Kaifu and, separately, his Ministers for<br />
Foreign Affairs, Finance, International Trade and Industry,<br />
and Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries. I also met with<br />
former Prime Minister Takeshita and with the Chairperson of<br />
the Japan Socialist Party, Ms Doi. I addressed a meeting of<br />
the Australia-Japan Dietmembers' League, and 600 senior<br />
Japanese businessmen who were attending the annual All Japan<br />
Chambers of Commerce. I met separately with a dozen or so<br />
of Japan's foremost business leaders. </p>
<p>Mr Speaker, 1: he relationship with Japan is of the highest<br />
priority for Australia. Not only is Japan's economy of<br />
global importance but, during the course of this decade we<br />
will see Japan assume an increasingly important political<br />
role in world affairs, something which my Government<br />
welcomes and to which I shall return to later.<br />
But over and above our many shared global and regional<br />
interests, the bilateral relationship with Japan stands in<br />
its own right:<br />
Two-way trade with Japan is now worth over $ 23 billion<br />
a year, with Japan being Australia's largest trading<br />
partner and Australia being Japan's sixth largest<br />
trading partner<br />
Japanese investment in Australia is worth over<br />
$ 36 billion or about 15% of total foreign investment in<br />
Australia and has increased by over 70% since 1986/ 87<br />
Japan is an important source of tourism for Australia,<br />
with visitors numbering about 350,000 in 1989<br />
Impressive as these figures are, we aspire to an even more<br />
diversified and rich relationship with Japan. For instance,<br />
as I pointed out in Japan, of the $ 9 billion currently<br />
invested by Japan in Australia, some 92% is invested in<br />
tourism and real estate. Tourism is a major growth industry<br />
for us. But we do not see ourselves solely as a purveyor of<br />
leisure services; nor do we see particular economic<br />
advantage in selling real estate as an end in itself.<br />
It is time, in short, for Japan to be more creative in its<br />
approach to investment in Australia and to joint ventures<br />
with us.<br />
The bilateral relationship is well managed within the<br />
framework of the Australia-Japan Ministerial Committee and<br />
my visit proviLded an opportunity to promote a further<br />
broadening andI deepening. Mr Kaifu shared this objective,<br />
and it has been agreed that the existing Science and<br />
Technology Agreement will be revised so that cooperation<br />
under it can encompass not only pure research but also<br />
important areas of applied science. It was also agreed that<br />
officials would explore areas of further cooperation in<br />
clean coal technologies the Brown Coal Liquefaction<br />
Project at Mor well in Victoria being a good example of what<br />
is possible.<br />
Against the background of the fundamental changes made to<br />
the Australian economy since 1983, I discussed with Mr<br />
Kaifu, his economic Ministers and with Japanese business<br />
leaders, the mutual benefits to be gained through increased<br />
investment in the Australian manufacturing sector. In this<br />
context, I am pleased to be able to report that the Japanese<br />
Government and, business leaders continue to take a very<br />
positive approach to the further development of the Multi-<br />
Function Polis or MFP, as made clear through their: </p>
<p>Welcoming of Adelaide as the location for the MFP;<br />
Agreement to nominate, as Co-Chairman of the<br />
International Advisory Group to report to<br />
Senator Button, its foremost business leader,<br />
Mr Eishiro Saito, Chairman of Japan's private sector<br />
umbrella group, Keidanren; and<br />
Agreement to send an investment mission to Australia in<br />
connection with the MFP<br />
I assured both the Japanese Government and business leaders<br />
that the prejudices within Australia which, at one point,<br />
put the MFP at needless risk, represented very much minority<br />
views. Mr Speaker, as I suggested earlier, I told Mr Kaifu and I<br />
stated clearly in public speeches that Australia wanted to<br />
give positive encouragement to Japan to play a wider role in<br />
global affairs, more commensurate with its economic<br />
standing. I want to state clearly here and now that I<br />
believe such a trend is inevitable and that it is in our<br />
interests. It is self-evident that the world today, as it embarks upon<br />
its post-Cold War era, is very different to the world of the<br />
1940s, when post-war global institutions were put in place.<br />
The time has clearly come for thought to be given about how<br />
those institutions, including the United Nations, might<br />
accommodate Japan's new role. Within the United Nations,<br />
for instance, there is obviously a range of possibilities,<br />
up to and including permanent membership of the Security<br />
Council. The question is a delicate one and involves a<br />
range of complex issues in which many countries have a<br />
legitimate interest. For that reason, I did not in any way<br />
seek to be prescriptive, but sought to highlight an<br />
important question which needs to be addressed.<br />
Mr Kaifu was appreciative of my comments and said he felt<br />
honoured that I had chosen to raise the issue. It was<br />
emphasised to me that while Japan wished to play a greater<br />
political role in world affairs, the terms of Japan's<br />
Constitution do not permit the deployment of Japan's armed<br />
forces abroad for combat operations. Japan is not<br />
contemplating any change to its Constitution, but this is,<br />
of course, a different matter from the foreshadowed change<br />
to Japanese legislation which will enable Japan to play a<br />
fuller and more active role within the framework of United<br />
Nations peacekeeping operations. My Government would<br />
welcome that. </p>
<p>Amongst the global issues discussed with Mr Kaifu and his<br />
Ministers, the most significant was the situation in the<br />
Gulf and its implications, both politically and<br />
economically. We confirmed our respective support for the<br />
relevant UN Security Council Resolutions. Mr Kaifu outlined<br />
Japan's contribution to the multi-national effort in the<br />
Gulf and said that, within the framework of its<br />
Constitution, Japan was examining what else it might be able<br />
to do. He applauded Australia's resolute and quick action<br />
in meeting the crisis by despatching naval vessels.<br />
I expressed appreciation for Japan's contribution and said<br />
that, while it was clearly a matter for Japan itself to<br />
determine, any decision to do more would be understood by<br />
Australia. In exchanging views about developments in the Soviet Union,<br />
both Mr Kaifu and Foreign Minister Nakayama outlined the<br />
current state of Japan-Soviet relations, including the<br />
outstanding question of the Northern Territories. I<br />
expressed my Government's hope that the issue would be<br />
resolved in a way acceptable to Japan, as Japan-Soviet<br />
relations were a matter of importance to all countries in<br />
the Asia-Pacific region.<br />
Other issues covered in my discussions included Antarctica,<br />
APEC, China, the Korean Peninsula and Cambodia:<br />
I outlined to Mr Kaifu the Australian-French initiative<br />
to preserve the unique Antarctic environment and the<br />
importance of the forthcoming Santiago Conference. Mr<br />
Kaifu expressed his hope for a satisfactory outcome at<br />
Santiago and agreed that our officials should continue<br />
to consult in the lead-up to the Conference<br />
Mr Kaifu and his Ministers were especially supportive<br />
of the APEC initiative which I launched early last<br />
year. Ii= was agreed that the two countries would<br />
continue to work together closely on this and other<br />
regional issues such as Cambodia<br />
On the Korean Peninsula, we both expressed concern<br />
about the failure, to date, of the DPRK to enter into<br />
its Safeguards Agreement with the International Atomic<br />
Energy Agency, a matter of great importance in the<br />
context of proliferation.<br />
Mr Speaker,<br />
As is obvious from this report, my visits have, in each<br />
case, advanced concrete Australian interests and have, once<br />
again, demonstrated Australia's continued high standing in<br />
the region. </p>
<p>It' is therefore a matter for regret that while I was in<br />
Japan, the Opposition Leader, Dr Hewson, delivered an<br />
address on foreign policy in which he made clear his belief<br />
that Australian influence in the region had become, in his<br />
word, " marginalised", and that Australia's foreign policy<br />
was, again in his words, " in disarray".<br />
" Let me put this point quite bluntly, Dr Hewson said. " We<br />
are no longer the diplomatic and economic force we were in<br />
the Asia-Pacific region, because our relative economic<br />
situation has declined considerably<br />
Mr Speaker, everything that emerged from the regional visits<br />
that are the subject of this report reveals this statement<br />
for what it is: the uninformed and opportunistic posturing<br />
of this apprentice.<br />
Quite simply, Australia now stands at a high point of its<br />
constructive regional influence, and you need look no<br />
further than Cambodia on the political side and APEC on the<br />
economic, for proof of that.<br />
Dr Hewson implies there was a lost golden era when Australia<br />
enjoyed areater positive influence in the region.<br />
Is this successor to the Liberal Leaders who sent Australian<br />
troops into Vietnam referring to that sort of regional<br />
influence? Is he talking about the wasted years of hypocrisy on trade<br />
under Malcolm Fraser, when this country preached reform but<br />
practiced inflexible self-centred protectionism?<br />
Does he suggest that Australia's influence was greater<br />
before this Government took the internationally recognised<br />
and applauded lead in the establishment of<br />
the Cairns Group?<br />
the new forum for Asia Pacific Economic<br />
Cooperation? the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone?<br />
the framework embraced by the UN Security Council<br />
for advancing the restoration of peace in<br />
Cambodia? </p>
<p>11.<br />
Mr Speaker, Australia is a nation that has spoken for a long<br />
time about being part of the Asia-Pacific region. But it is<br />
only under this Government that real effect has been given<br />
to those words; it is only this Government which has defined<br />
economic enmeshment with the region as a key objective for<br />
this country for the coming decade; it is only this<br />
Government, and this party, that has never wavered in its<br />
unequivocal commitment to non-racial principles of<br />
immigration; and it is only under this Government that<br />
Australia's potential as an active, respected and positive<br />
partner in the region has started to be fulfilled. </p>
