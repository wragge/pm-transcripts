PRIME MINISTER'S SPEECH, ST. JOSEPH'S SCHOOL, MOOREBANK, N. S. W.<br />
13.4.1975 It's true that the parish priest revealed that I was looking up<br />
the article on Thomas Moore, not the one that is usually referred<br />
to in this circle, not the saint but the land-owner. He was a<br />
very good citizen. In 1810 he was declared a magistrate for<br />
Liverpool, and he accompanied Macquarie when Macquarie later in<br />
December 1810 surveyed the whole of this area and declared<br />
Liverpool one of the original Macquarie towns.<br />
So in Australian terms, the terms of settlement, European<br />
settlement in Australia, Liverpool and Moorebank, are significant<br />
indeed. But while I must concede, and of course I am a separated<br />
brother too, it might be embarrassing to refer to the fact that<br />
Thomas Moore, the Australian one, had left his property to the<br />
Church of England, and had thus endowed Moore Theological College,<br />
and I must confess that some of the priests who come from there,<br />
are just as tough on me as some of those who come from the<br />
Catholic Centre.<br />
But I did notice, this is why I brought it here, he did in this<br />
district, contribute toward ' s the building of a two-storey church<br />
school and a court house opened in 1813, a Catholic Chapel in<br />
1821 and a Presbyterian Church in 1826, a very early but significant<br />
ecumenical attitude. But how this district has grown. I've<br />
represented it now for well over 20, years and one of the great<br />
joys one has is coming to the opening of new buildings and it's<br />
now possible to an extent that one would never have dreamed when<br />
I first became the Member to get a good education, to have the<br />
whole range of recreation, occupation, education close at hand<br />
in areas like this.<br />
This is a very beautiful use of this site. A high site, an% from<br />
here, one can look over the buildings which are over a century and<br />
a half old, and yet one can be quite close to some occupations<br />
which are as old as that and others which are quite new. We are<br />
living in an area and the children who come to this school will be.<br />
living in an area which is old, but which is perennially new.<br />
And I think they're very fortunate to live in an area * which is<br />
still being developed with a good regard to the environment,<br />
preserving the old and making the new fit in with it.<br />
I notice on the program, and immensely flattering, that I am to<br />
declare the school open. I think we've been beaten to it a bit.<br />
I think the children have been using it to very good purpose for<br />
some time. But nevertheless, I can't help saying that there have<br />
been times in my career and not going back twenty years or so ago<br />
when it would have been utterly unthinkable for a person of my<br />
politics to be asked to declare open a Catholic School, and I<br />
hope you'll forgive me for saying that TI think now by our deeds<br />
you can judge us. </p>
<p>You can see that a very great numaber of the things which were<br />
said about us were not factual as well as not being particularly<br />
charitable, and it is true enough as Father Duncan said that<br />
there is inflation and so oni but quite apart from inflation,<br />
the amount of money which is being spent on education is<br />
incomparably greater than would be required by any compulsion<br />
of population or migration.<br />
Three years ago, the amrount of money being spent by the Federal<br />
Governmrent on Catholic education throughout Australia was barely<br />
million. This year it is three and a half times as much.<br />
It is over'$ 100 million. Now that is certainly very much more<br />
than would be required by an increase in enrollment or an<br />
increase in inflation during that period, and the principle that<br />
we have adhered to throughout is that it should be possible for<br />
children wherever they live, whatever their parents' means,<br />
whatever their parents' beliefs, whatever their parents' occupatign,<br />
it should be possible for their children to have as good an<br />
education as this country can provide.<br />
And the basis upon which we make that provision is perfectly open.<br />
It's under an Act of Parliament. It is administered by a<br />
Commission, whose membership is appointed by the government of<br />
the day. I've never heard any criticism of the people, the men<br />
and women, both lay and religious who have been appointed to<br />
that Commission. It is a very diligent Commission. It's had<br />
a very serious job to do, and we are shortly to receive the<br />
recommendations that it makes for the school-years 1976 and 1977,<br />
but the ones that it made for 1974 and 1975 have, I believe,<br />
transformed education in Australia, and I would be able to say<br />
that if I went to any State school, if I went to any Catholic<br />
school, or if. I went to any non-government, non-Catholic school.<br />
The fact is we are wanting to see the children, irrespective any of<br />
their faith or means are able to get a good education where they<br />
live. If they're isolated and can't have it where they live, then<br />
there is assistance for them to have it as boarders where the<br />
proper form of education will be available for them. There are<br />
a very great number of other programs, disadvantaged schools,<br />
handicapped children, migrant children, children who don't speak<br />
English at home, where additional special assistance is being made.<br />
Ladies and Gentlemen, three years ago, if I'd come along and said<br />
that there would have been a very great number of doubting Thomases<br />
among you, and -what I-. said would have been received with scepticism<br />
if not disbelief, and it is a very great pleasure on this occasion,<br />
after seeing what has been done, what we've put through the<br />
Parliament, not without difficulty, not without a very great deal<br />
of criticism of " Where's the money coming from, doesn't Government<br />
expenditure produce inflation?", all this sort. of argument. </p>
<p>We'll have it still more when the next recommendations come in<br />
this year's budget, from the Schools Commission for the school<br />
years 1976 and 1977. I think I can say with complete conviction,<br />
we will not be deterred from government expenditure on things<br />
such as education.<br />
The very best investment that a country can have is in the rising<br />
generation, and having represented areas like this for a long<br />
time, I'm determined to see that areas like this which didn't<br />
have all the schools or as good schools as were needed in the<br />
government or Catholic sectors that they will get as good as any<br />
other areas.<br />
But I can say that at any school. I can say that at any area.<br />
The pattern is open. It is unremitting. It gives me very great<br />
pleasure indeed to see that the young children of this area, this<br />
historic area, this still beautiful area will be able to come to<br />
a good useful, yquthful school. A good staff, good equipment, gqod<br />
grounds, good building. But always I trust getting better. It is<br />
a very great pleasure to have been asked here and it is an immense<br />
compliment to have been asked to declare St. Joseph's Primary<br />
School, Moorebank, officially open. I do so with the greatest<br />
pleasure, and I am sure that all the staff and the parents will<br />
be proud of this school and the children will have a very much<br />
more useful life as a result of going to such a good school. </p>
