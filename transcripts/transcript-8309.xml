PRIME MINISTER<br />
CHECK AAN nP-TVER EMRAR( OEn UNTIL DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
1991 LIONS INTERNATIONAL CONVENTION<br />
BRISBANE, 19 JUNE 1991<br />
Bill Biggs, International President,<br />
Distinguished guests,<br />
ladies and gentlemen<br />
At the outset I want to welcome, on behalf of the people and<br />
the Government of Australia, the International Association<br />
of Lions Clubs to Brisbane and to Australia, and<br />
wholeheartedly to wish you well in your convention.<br />
This is the first International Convention that Lions have<br />
held in the Southern Hemisphere and we are delighted that<br />
you have chosen Australia for what we hope is only the first<br />
of many return journeys for you.<br />
It's a pleasure to see such a large gathering of<br />
international visitors, drawn from more than 100 countries<br />
and it is a pleasure too to see the way in which Australia's~<br />
Lions, your hosts and guides, are working to ensure your<br />
stay here is enjoyable and memorable.<br />
The Lions movement today on the eve of its<br />
anniversary is truly one of the great international and<br />
multicultural movements, spanning the continents and uniting<br />
people of diverse cultures and backgrounds in a common<br />
commitment to community service.<br />
You are dedicated to creating and fostering a spirit of<br />
understanding among the peoples of the world, and to uniting<br />
your clubs around the world in bonds of friendship, good<br />
fellowship and mutual understanding. In other words, Lions<br />
is both a catalyst and a model, in these challenging times,<br />
for the emergence of more harmonious relations among the<br />
people and the nations of the world.<br />
It must certainly be obvious to everyone assembled here that<br />
this Convention does take place against an international<br />
backdrop of -the most dramatic, and in some respects the most<br />
uplifting, changes seen in more than four decades. </p>
<p>The last few years have seen the end of the Cold War, the<br />
fall of the Berlin Wall, and particularly over the last<br />
year the re-invigoration of the United Nations to the<br />
point where we can hope it will become in fact the<br />
instrument of global order envisaged by its founders.<br />
The end of the Cold War has borne double fruit. Not only<br />
has the threat of global nuclear war been lifted, but the<br />
ideal of international co-operation to keep the peace an<br />
ideal which lay dormant through the long years of the Cold<br />
War has now sprung to life once more.<br />
The success of the United Nations, and of the multinational<br />
coalition led by the United States, in confronting and<br />
reversing the invasion of Kuwait has far reaching and<br />
positive consequences for us all.<br />
But despite all this we cannot, of course, afford naive<br />
optimism about the future of international relations.<br />
Economic under-development in the Third World is still a<br />
tragically unresolved problem. The spectres of hunger and<br />
desertification in Africa continue to loom. Population<br />
pressures still increase. The plight of refugees continues<br />
to challenge us. Global environmental degradation threatens<br />
humankind in ways which could ultimately be as significant<br />
as, albeit more gradual and insidious than, the nuclear<br />
threat. We see the continuing struggle within the Soviet Union to<br />
contain and repair the damage inflicted on its political and<br />
economic structures by the illogicalities of those decades<br />
of centralised planning and in observing that continuing<br />
struggle we can at best conclude that the outcome is<br />
uncertain. And underlining all these difficulties is the continuing<br />
crisis in world trade. In the face of the still unresolved<br />
Uruguay Round of trade negotiations, it would be<br />
irresponsible to be optimistic about the world economic<br />
structure. So my friends, as members of an organisation with a truly<br />
international spirit and a truly global perspective, you<br />
will conclude with me, even on the basis of this very<br />
cursory assessment, that for all our justified euphoria in<br />
seeing the end of the Cold War, the current international<br />
climate contains many profound challenges for us all.<br />
The beneficial changes we have experienced do provide a firm<br />
basis for us to mould a more enlightened international<br />
order. But there needs to be a realisation that the<br />
challenges in this new, fluid, multipolar world are no<br />
lesser challenges than those of the static certainties of<br />
the old bipolar world they replace. </p>
<p>How are thesis challenges to be solved? And how is this<br />
international order to be created?<br />
In essence, -the challenge we face in the iggos, at the end<br />
of the Cold War, is analogous to the challenge of 1945, at<br />
the end of the Second World War. Each country and-region of<br />
course will have its own particular suggestions and<br />
perspectives. But the guidelines which should provide our direction in<br />
managing this transition in international relations are<br />
clear. They are in essence the same principles that give life to<br />
the great multilateral organisations born in the 1940s the<br />
principles ofE fair and open international trade enshrined in<br />
the GATT; the principles of economic development and sound,<br />
market-orienited economic management, which govern the World<br />
Bank and the International Monetary Fund; the commitment to<br />
a better qua: lity of life, which provides the fundamental<br />
rationale for-the United Nations specialised agencies; and<br />
not least, the principles of respect for national<br />
sovereignty and international cooperation enshrined in the<br />
charter of the United Nations Organisation.<br />
The challenge is to ensure peace through international<br />
cooperation; to apply enlightened self interest in an<br />
interconnected world in short, to live up to the high<br />
ideals and the realistic expectations of those far sighted<br />
men and women who in that great burst of statesmanship in<br />
the 1940s lai~ d the basis for multilateral activity today.<br />
And we must make certain that the principles of the United<br />
Nations concerning respect for sovereignty and peaceful<br />
dispute settl~ ement are enshrined not just in the Charter but<br />
in the real world, by giving them concrete backing.<br />
This is a responsibility which many powers must share. We<br />
hope the US will keep alive the internationalist spirit<br />
which has sustained it in fulfilling its responsibilities<br />
which flow from great power. And because of the relative<br />
shift of economic power, there is clear scope for others to<br />
bear more of the responsibilities and of the burden,<br />
clearly, including Western Europe and Japan.<br />
In the United; Nations and other international institutions,<br />
in the Western community of nations and in the Asia-Pacific<br />
region, Australia is well placed to play a role. We have a<br />
myriad of specific interests to pursue and protect our<br />
independence of action will always be vital in our foreign,<br />
defence, trade and international economic policies. But we<br />
recognise that a real contribution to the larger reshaping<br />
of international relations can only be effectively made by<br />
working with others.<br />
Our commitment to multilateralism will help guide our<br />
foreign policy in the decade ahead. </p>
<p>Our rapid and firm support for the United Nations' stand<br />
against Iraq testifies to our commitment to multilateralism.<br />
Our initiative in establishing the Cairns Group of likeminded<br />
agricultural-exporting countries, which has been<br />
critical in having agriculture recognised as the lynchpin to<br />
the Uruguay Round, likewise testifies to our commitment to<br />
multilateralism. And one of the objectives of APEC the<br />
Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation of which Australia is a<br />
founding member, is the encouragement of free and open<br />
international trade, as a key to global prosperity.<br />
In our own region, we have sought with others to find a<br />
formula for peace in Cambodia, to bring peace and stability<br />
to that country, and an end to its people's suffering.<br />
Australia recognises that the role we are able to play in<br />
global security is necessarily somewhat limited. But we are<br />
one of the most active nations in the measured pursuit of<br />
disarmament including, through the United Nations and<br />
other negotiating forums, the abolition of chemical weapons.<br />
My friends,<br />
The creation of a saner and a safer world is within the<br />
grasp of the international community. Australia will play<br />
its part.<br />
But I want to close by saying to you, the thousands of<br />
assembled delegates of Lions International, that the<br />
attainment of this goal is not a task for governments alone.<br />
Indeed, without the active and intelligent support of<br />
individual people, and of international networks of people<br />
such as the Lions movement, the work of governments will<br />
falter and fail.<br />
Ultimately, if we are to succeed in creating a saner and a<br />
safer world, it will be because ppla throughout the<br />
nations of the world have determined to achieve that goal.<br />
Let me say in particular that the Lions project to eradicate<br />
preventable blindness around the world, and its continued<br />
involvement in drug prevention programs, are precisely the<br />
kinds of actions that I am talking about.<br />
In the same way, voluntary relief organisations have played<br />
an indispensable role in alleviating hardship throughout the<br />
world nowhere more starkly in recent weeks than in the<br />
Horn of Africa and in Bangladesh.<br />
We are all in their debt because of the dedication and not<br />
infrequently the courage with which they do their work.<br />
And the significance of their work is emphasised because it<br />
so often is conducted in areas beyond the proper reach of<br />
Governments, and mobilises resources additional to those<br />
that are allocated by Governments. </p>
<p>So to this gathering I say in closing: you are very welcome<br />
among us in Australia. Your mission of service, and your<br />
achievements, stand as an example to governments around the<br />
world of what can be achieved, with determination and<br />
dedication, to attain the goal of a better world. </p>
