FOR MEDIA WEDNESDAY, JULY 22 1981<br />
SYDNEY AIRPORT<br />
I am very disappointed indeed to see Mr Wran's reply to the<br />
Commonweal-z. oroposals to meet the future aviation needs of Sydney and<br />
the whole of New South Wales.<br />
Because of the pressure of growth in this city and of air<br />
traffic, we had proposed that a second parallel runway be<br />
built at Mascot, but that for long term planning a new airport<br />
site be determined -and secured. It will take between 12 and<br />
years to build a new modern international airport for<br />
Sydney and therefore a decision to build a new site alone does<br />
not meet the needs of Sydney over that period. There is already<br />
heavy con-estion at Mascot, there is already diversion of<br />
traffic, general aviation is already suffering considerably<br />
and this Is bound to get worse.<br />
Mr Wran has made a decision to strangle the growth of air<br />
transport in and out of Sydney. That, therefore, is a decision<br />
to strangle the commercial development of this city. Quite<br />
obviously international flights would have to be diverted under<br />
this policy. No doubt other Premiers will welcome that, but<br />
that will not help Sydney and the legitimate commercial needs<br />
of that city.<br />
Mr Wran, through his whole period of government, has shown<br />
himself quite incapable of taking the difficult decisions which<br />
are necessary for the progress of his own State. This not only<br />
affects the city of Sydney, it will affect all the people of<br />
New South Wales. Especially it would mean charter and commuter<br />
services to Sydney would be rationed and regional services would<br />
have to be limited . As the congestion at Mascot grows worse.<br />
So he has taken a decision which affects all the people of<br />
the State, a retrograde and damaging step which he no doubt<br />
believes has short term political advantage. That of course<br />
has characterised Mr Wran's premiership throughout his whole<br />
term. Short term political advantage without the long term<br />
sensible planning which any government ought to undertake. / 2 </p>
<p>2<br />
The delays in reaching any decision on this are right in<br />
Mr Wran's court. I first wrote to Mr Wran on this subject on<br />
August 1976. We established a joint Commonwealth State'<br />
committee to examine the subject that held 30 meetings over a<br />
period of 36 months. Then in December 1979 Mr Wran withdrew<br />
his State representatives and the report could not proceed<br />
on a joint basis.<br />
We therefore tried to determine the issue in the only way that<br />
can meet tie transport. needs of Sydney. and New South Wales by<br />
proposing a parallel runway and a second airport which<br />
obviously involve massive expenditure over a period of<br />
years. Mr Wran has rejected the only solution.<br />
