FOR MEDIA FRIDAY, 15 JANUARY, J. 982<br />
ADDRESS TO THE NATIONAL YOUNG LIBERAL<br />
CONVENTION, SYDNEY<br />
I am pleased to have the opportunity to address this Young<br />
Liberal Convention, because as members of the only nationwide<br />
Party committed to the well-being of all Australians, Liberals<br />
share a profound responsibility for Australia's future.<br />
I have no doubt that a great future lies ahead for Australia,<br />
a great economic future and a great future as a vibrant,<br />
concerned and diverse society in which there is freedom and<br />
opportunity for all. Australia is now known around the world<br />
as a stable yet exciting country, and I want to dwell for a<br />
momen~ t on the transformation in Australian life which has<br />
occurred over the last 30 years under Liberal Governments<br />
because the early 1950' s are outside the memory of most<br />
Young Liberals.<br />
Australian life as it was when the first Liberal Gov~ ernment came<br />
to office in 1949 would be almost totally unrecognizable to us<br />
today. At that time, cars were the exception rather than the<br />
rule for most families. Fridges were only starting to replace.<br />
Coolgardie safes or ice chests. Washing machines were only<br />
starting to replace coppers. Home heating as we know it was<br />
virtually unknown. Most of Australia's households had no<br />
telephone. There was no tel. evision, cassettes were unheard of,<br />
long playing records were just coming onto the market. At that<br />
time, air travel was a novelty, and the Gold Coast as we know it<br />
simply did not exist.<br />
Since the early fifties our GDP has more than trebled in real<br />
terms, average weekly earnings have more than doubled inreal terms<br />
and to give just one indication of the level of industrial<br />
development which has taken place, power generation is about seven<br />
times what it was in 1954.<br />
Over the same period, the great rail. standardisation programmes<br />
have been carried through, and while people often grumble about the<br />
roads today, the length of sealed roads has mnore than quadrupled,.<br />
to almost quarter of a million kilometres. Despite our small<br />
population we have put a modern communications netw.. ork into a<br />
continent as large as the United States, and with the satellite,<br />
television and other communications will become available to all<br />
Australians. / 2 </p>
<p>-2<br />
over the same 30 year period Australian society itself has<br />
developed enormously, again under successive Liberal Governments<br />
in terms of artistic achievement, of educational opportunity,<br />
and of cultural diversity.<br />
The genesis of many vital Government programmes in education and<br />
the arts is to be found in Liberal initiatives of the 1950' s and<br />
1960' s, such as the Murray Report on Universities, the formation<br />
of the Australian Elizabethan Theatre Trust and the inception of<br />
the Film and Television School. There are five times as many<br />
students at Australian universities today as there were at the<br />
start of the 1950' s, and at that time, despite massive migration<br />
programmes, the idea of multiculturalism had not been thought of.<br />
Again, none of us would find it easy to contemnplate an Australia<br />
without the Australian Opera or Ballet, or without the burgeoning<br />
film industry which is already recognised worldwide. And it is<br />
worth remembering that it was under a Liberal-Government that the<br />
decision was made in 1953 to build up the national collection which<br />
will be housed in the National Gallery in Canberra which will open<br />
this year.<br />
With a population of just over 8 million in 1949, which has now<br />
grown to almost 15 million, we have established a pattern of<br />
achievement which provides a strong foundation for continuing progress<br />
and re-form. Virtuallyali the changeshave occurred over these years.<br />
Changes which have uplifted people's horizons and transformed our<br />
way of life have taken place under Liberal Governments.<br />
These are the great legacy of the Liberal Party to Australia. They<br />
would not have happened without the Liberal Party, and they are<br />
the guarantee that we can provide the hind of government Australia<br />
needs in the future.<br />
I am proud that the present Liberal Government, strongly supported<br />
by the branches and other sections of the Liberal organisation, has<br />
carried on the traditions of progressive Liberalism establ~ ished by<br />
the earlier Liberal Governments. Indeed, I believe that the<br />
Government's record over the last six years equals that of any<br />
comparable period, despite the massive problems which we have had<br />
to deal with.<br />
This Government's achievements have been wide ranging and profound,<br />
not only in terms of economic recovery and social welfare initiatives,<br />
not only in terms of the realisation of multicultural Australia, not<br />
only in terms such as health care and self-management initiativesfor<br />
Aboriginals, not only in terms of an historical and visionary<br />
exercise such as the Review of Commonwealth Functions, but in terms<br />
of progressive legal reforms, including the Commonwealth Ombudsman,<br />
the National Companies and Securities Commission, the Human Rights<br />
Commission, and our freedomr. of information legislation; in terms<br />
of environmental measures, including the protection of the Barrier'<br />
Reef and' progressive declarations of -the Marine Park, the prohibition<br />
of sand mining on Fraser Island and the banning of whaling in<br />
Australian waters; and in terms of employment-and youth affairs,<br />
including the apprenticeship, training and transition schemes, the<br />
recent campaign to encourage more young women to enter apprenticeships,<br />
the establishment of the National Youth Advisory Group, and the<br />
significant start that has been made in appointing young people to<br />
advisory bodies. </p>
<p>-3<br />
In Looking at the changes and reforms which h * ave taken place under<br />
successive Liberal Governments, we need to be'aware that these things<br />
do not happen by chance, but as a result of the steady and<br />
determined pursuit of Liberal policies. It is important as we look<br />
to the future that we remember the old saying that " progress is not<br />
a law of nature".<br />
Our vision for the future must be built upon our pride in Australia<br />
and its achievements. It must grow out of our determination to<br />
improve the Australian way of life, and it must draw upon those<br />
fundamental Liberal values which are shared by the great majority<br />
of Australians. I want to list some of these values, because they<br />
highlight our profound differences from the sectional, socialist<br />
approach of the Labor Party.<br />
Liberals believe that people are the best judges of their own wants..<br />
The Socialists believe that they know what is good for others.<br />
Liberals believe that the incentives created within a competitive<br />
market economy are essential to prosperity and meeting consumer needs.<br />
The Socialists believe in Government direction. Liberals believeeconomic<br />
freedom is vital to political freedom and democracy. The<br />
Socialists want Government direction and control. Liberals believe<br />
that Governments must work to promote interests of all Australians.<br />
The Socialists, concentrate on the interests of their own supporters<br />
and the pursuit of abstract theories. Liberals believe that all<br />
Australians must accept their responsibilities to each other.<br />
The Socialists want to leave all the problems to a centralised<br />
Government in Canberra. These values are at the heart of our philosophy<br />
and I would like to say something about three-policy areas which<br />
are vital to them: the importance of e ' conomic management in<br />
developing Australia's resources and creating the opportunities arid<br />
living standards people want; the impor Lance of providing adequately<br />
for the disadvantaged, the needy, and the people who need help<br />
to help themselves; and the importance of safeguarding our national<br />
security through sound defence and foreign policies and the promotion<br />
of international peace and prosperity.<br />
In relation to economic management and development, there is no doubt<br />
whatever that our position is the envy of many other countries, because<br />
0 we pioneered and stuck to policy approaches which are increasingly<br />
widely recognised as appropriate in the 1-980' s. Economic recovery is<br />
a long haul, and we are still paying the penalties for Labor's<br />
mismanagement. But our policies, particularly our unremitting fight<br />
against inflation, have borne iripressive fruit in the last two or<br />
three years. Over 400,000 new jobs have been created in the last<br />
three years. In the two years to the last September Quarter, the--<br />
annual income of a person on average weekly earnings increased in<br />
real terms by over $ 700, and in 1980-81, the real disposable incomes<br />
of Australian families increased by almost $ 3 billion after tax.<br />
And when we consider as well as these increases in real incomes we havo<br />
been able to increase spending on welfare by over 30% in real terms.--<br />
since 1975/ 76, we get a clear measure of the benefits of the growth<br />
that has occurred under this Government, and an overwhel~ ming rebuttal<br />
of the talk we hear of deepening poverty, and of Australians being<br />
worse-off. ./ 4 </p>
<p>4-<br />
By establishing confidence in the economic future of Australia,<br />
Liberal policies have also vastly strengthened business investment<br />
in Australia. In 1981, for example, record amounts of over $ A billion<br />
were to be spent on petroleum exploration and development almost<br />
times greater than the comparable figure of $ 145 million in 1975.<br />
There was a 21% real increase overall in business investment in<br />
1980-81, the strongest growth for 30 years, and a further substantial<br />
real increase in investment is expected this year. This is providing<br />
great under * lying strength in the economy. A sure basis is being laid<br />
for long term benefits for all Australians and we must never forget<br />
that there can be no other basis apart from investment for sustained<br />
ificreases in living standards. Nor should we overlook the stark<br />
contrast between Australia's economic p~ erformance and that of our<br />
major trading partners in North America and Europe.<br />
While our economy is growing, their economies have had little or<br />
no growth. While our economy has generated record levels of business<br />
investment, their economies have experienced stagnant or declininginvestment.<br />
Australia's unemployment rate, while still too hih at<br />
6.2% in December, has been significantly below 6% through most of<br />
1981.<br />
We can see how much better we are doing than other countries by putting<br />
this against the most recent rates of over 8% in Candda and the<br />
United States, and over 11% in the United Kingdom, and the OECD<br />
predicts a worsening of al~ l these overseas rates during 1982.<br />
By any standards, the Australian economy has done well, but let<br />
there be no misunderstanding about why it has done well.. Australia<br />
has done well because we have faced the economic challenges of our<br />
times with the right policies. When we think of the situation of<br />
many overseas economies, we must not say to ourselves " it can't happen<br />
here". If wve relaxed our efforts, or if Australia was subjected to<br />
Labor' s misguided economic policies, we too w-ould be suffering the<br />
disaster of substantially higher unemployment rates, stagnant<br />
investment and economic recession. Let me add that round economic<br />
management is not just a matter of getting the right policies in place<br />
and watching them bear fruit: it is a continuing process of facing<br />
new circumstances, anticipating new challenges, and adapting to them.<br />
One of the most significant of the challenges we * currently face is<br />
to keep development and growth going in Australia while the world<br />
economy remains depressed. A clear indication of the impact of poor<br />
world economic conditions is reflected in the state of our balance of<br />
payments. Because of our strong growth of real incomes, and the demandS<br />
created by resource development, our import bill has been rising<br />
significantly, but because of depressed world trade and falling<br />
commodity prices our export earnings have been falling. This has<br />
restricted the cash flow to exporters which is an important source'<br />
of funds for investment in new developments. Inevitably, faced with<br />
poor current earnings and the high cost of borrowing additional funds,<br />
some projects have been deferred or delayed, but most development<br />
projects are going ahead providing a sign of confidence in Australia's<br />
prospects, providing benefits now to the whole economy, and building<br />
strength for the future. </p>
<p>While to the superficia. observer there may appear to be signs<br />
of a weakening of the economy, the reality is not that there is.<br />
weakness in the Australian economy, but rather weakness in be<br />
world economy, and when the world up-turn comes as inevitably<br />
it will we will be well-placed to take * advantage of it.<br />
The Government is aware that people are concerned by talk of weakness<br />
in the balance of payments, or of projected development being<br />
deferred, but there is a quite unnecessary tendency to speak and<br />
think in extremes, and nothing illustrates this better than some<br />
current talk of " boom or gloom". Do people really believe that the<br />
Government has been unaware of changing d* ircumstances, of what is<br />
happening overseas, and of its implications for the balance of<br />
payments and the Australian economy that having restored confidence-,<br />
incentive and profitability in Australia we would not have been<br />
monitoring and anticipating threats to those achievements?<br />
While th e Government cannot totally insulate the Australian economy<br />
from the effects of overseas trends, or make long range predictions<br />
of every twist and turn in events, we canl and have already shaped<br />
our policies in response to the challenges that overseas conditions<br />
pose, as any careful analyst of the Budget papers, or observer of<br />
our exchange rate management, would iblearly see. But the challenges<br />
to our continued growth are not limited to conditions overseas, for<br />
strikes and wage demands'are also posing real threats. It is one of<br />
our objectives that wage earners should share the benefits of economic<br />
growth, and I have alrezid referred to the real increases in wages<br />
that have been occurring. But people are fed. up with the kind of<br />
strikes and unreasonable wage demands Whi4ch have been all too common in<br />
the past year, which have damaged our international competitiveness,<br />
have threatened investment, and have destroyed job prospects for<br />
many young people. There are limits to the impact which Governments<br />
can have through changes in the law, because industrial relations<br />
are relations between people. And Management and unions as well<br />
as Governments have a vital role in the establishment of a better<br />
industrial climate in this country, and such an outcome, with the<br />
objective of dramatically reducing the number of strikes, is<br />
necessary to the continued strength of the Australian economy.<br />
At the Government's next meeting with the ACTU, later this month,<br />
this important objective will be a major item for discussion. The<br />
ACTU is obviously concerned about the well-being of Australians and<br />
Australian families, and as part of the process of securing improved<br />
living standards this country badly needs some rational debate on<br />
the issue of how the benefits of economic growth should be shared..<br />
If the economy grows at 3% a year, and if inflation is to be contained,<br />
then the benefits that are available to be shared are plain to see,<br />
and there are massive limitations to the w.. age increases that can occur.<br />
/ 6 </p>
<p>-6<br />
Obviously the unions, along with the government and the community,<br />
would want some of the benefits to go into, improved wages. Most,<br />
people would want some of the benefits to go into improved<br />
welfare provisions, and I believe that the unions understand<br />
the need for some of the benefits to go into improved profits,<br />
which are essential. to fund the developments on) which future<br />
growth depends. If a rational debate on thes~ e issues can<br />
occur and if as a result there can be a better grasp throughout<br />
the community of what is involved, then we will have an opportunity<br />
to develop greater u ' nity of purpose as a nation in the resolution<br />
of the issues themselves.<br />
A further requirement of continuing strength in the Australian<br />
economy a requirement essential to the control of inflation,<br />
to the maintenance of incentive -and profitability, and to the<br />
growth of real incomes is the sustained restraint of government<br />
spending. our record of holding the annual average real growth of budget<br />
outlays to just over 1% per annum since 1975-76 stands in<br />
stark contrast to real growth rates of spending of over 2% in<br />
the nearly 3% in West Germany, over 4% in the USA, and<br />
about 10% in Japan over the same period -and the real growth<br />
over over 10% p. a. in government spending in Australia in the<br />
Labor years.<br />
As a result both of the restraint on spending we have exercised<br />
and of the renewed confidence and economic activity that our<br />
policies have generated, we have reduced Commonwealth spending<br />
as proportion of GDP by 2 cents in every dollar since 1975/ 76<br />
over a period in whicC 11Most industrialised countries have<br />
seen the Government's share of GDP-continue to grow.<br />
We must not forget that renewed big government and massive budget<br />
deficits would present an enormous threat to the Australian<br />
economy, and neither Must we forget that the big government,<br />
big spending, big taxation party in Australia is the Labor Party.<br />
Mr Hayden was once incautious enough to admit that he is a<br />
" high tax man.". Hie continues to support the introduction of<br />
entirely new kinds of taxes. Hie has expressed his commitment<br />
" to seeing a larger public sector", ' and under its existing<br />
promises alone, Labor would establish over 50 new government bodies<br />
It is simply a myth to suppose that Mr H-ayden knows about<br />
good economic management and we should not forget that his<br />
so-called " restrained" 1975 budget contained a real increase<br />
in budget outlays approaching 6% or that his estimated deficit<br />
of $ 2.8 billion would have run out to an actual deficit of<br />
well over $ 4 billion except for the spending cuts which we<br />
introduced on coming to office, and which still left that<br />
Hayden Budget with a deficit of $ 3.6 billion.<br />
Nor should we forget that by 1983, well over a Million voters<br />
will be too young to remember the disastrous economic mismanagement<br />
under the Labor Government and we share the responsibility<br />
to make sure that the threat which the Labor Party poses to<br />
to Australia's economic well-being does not become a reality.<br />
Liberal Governments emphasise good economic management. because<br />
a prosperous economy is the precondition of so many of our other<br />
objectives and this leads to the question of our ability to provide<br />
adequately for disadvantaged and needy people. / 17 </p>
<p>7<br />
Thiere are obviously many hard decisions to be made about<br />
priorities in the social welfare area and many difficult<br />
lines to be drawn.<br />
But the Liberal Party's record of effective concern to<br />
provide care and attention for the needy and disadvantaged<br />
is unparalleled in Australia's history, and we all know that<br />
the often-heard claim that Liberals do not care is an absurd<br />
fabrication. The people who make this claim are n ot only<br />
historically wrong they fail to grasp the fundamental<br />
philosophical concern of Liberalism with the individual<br />
well-being of every Australian.<br />
This Liberal concern has received consistent arnd balanced<br />
practical expression over decades through budgetary and<br />
other initiatives and obviously that process will continue<br />
in the years ahead.<br />
1981 saw the initiation of the new health scheme under which<br />
there is provision for free health care for about three<br />
million Australians,, and with the tax rebate for health<br />
insurance, a growing number of people have beeni taking out<br />
health insurance.<br />
As a result of the 50% family allowance increase for third and<br />
subsequent children, more than half a million Australian<br />
families, many of them the most needy, are now better off.<br />
The Government is proud of the progress that has been achieved<br />
across a wide front of social welfare concerns, including a<br />
39% real increase since 1975/ 76 in assistance to disabled and<br />
handicapped persons, and also including -the automatic<br />
indexation of pensions, a Liberal initiative which p.. rovides<br />
essential security to those people, especially women, who<br />
depend on their -pens ions.<br />
Any society which cares about individuals and their well-being<br />
will inevitably face on-going challenges in relation<br />
to social welfare, and one major challenge which lies ahead<br />
for Australia arises from the increasainqily ageing composition<br />
of our population.<br />
Australians are generous in their concern to provide well for<br />
aged and needy people and there is need for on--going discussion<br />
about which needs are the greatest and which priorities are<br />
the highest.<br />
But economic growth is quite obviously the decisive precondition<br />
of our being able to provide the highest desirable<br />
level of social welfare benefits and it is indeed largely<br />
because the Liberal. Party has always recognise * d this simple<br />
truth that Liberal governments have been able to do * so much<br />
to improve social welfare arrangements in Australia.<br />
In considering the prospects and challenges which lie ahead<br />
for Australia as a nation another area which obviously must<br />
concern us is the international environment. </p>
<p>-8<br />
I believe that the community is increasingly recognising<br />
the value and appropriateness of our defence policy and our<br />
foreign policy which work together as the two arms of our<br />
approach to national security. We have embarked on a longterm<br />
programme to strengthen our defence forces and we have<br />
also strengthened our relations with, our free world partners.<br />
As a middle level power, Australia's role is obviously a<br />
limited one but I believe that as a result of sustained pursuit<br />
of some central attitudes and policies, and as a result of<br />
our willingness to play what part we can, as expressed for<br />
example in'the terms of our decision to participate . in the<br />
Sinai Peacekeeping Force, Australia's reputation has been<br />
enhanced as a country with a capacity to make a contribution<br />
to discussions on issues of world concern.<br />
The kind of reputation we. have been achieving as a concerned<br />
and constructive country does not come easily, but through<br />
the steady, balanced pursuit of sound policies we shall continue<br />
to buiildup that. reputation.<br />
There are obviously many challenges on the world scene extending<br />
beyond issues of stability and world peace, and including the<br />
promotion of human rights and the strengthening of the spirit<br />
of liberty, independence and democracy.<br />
Au~ stralia is actively involved in discussions of such issues<br />
by various world bodies, but one of the most-important<br />
challenges today is that of world poverty, and the need for<br />
dialogue between) the developed and developing countries.<br />
Australia-has put its weight behind moves to revitalise this<br />
dialogue, and to give it the urgency and priority which it<br />
deserves because its significance for the kind of world in<br />
which we and our children will live cannot be exaggerated.<br />
I believe that Australians increas1ingly want this challenge to<br />
be faced; that they want it to receive continuing emphasis as<br />
a matter of government policy and it will certainly continue<br />
to receive priority in terms of the governmentC's concerns.<br />
Like so many of the great challengos in p : olitics, it i~ s not the<br />
kind of issue that can be solved today or tomorrow,; not the kind<br />
of issue which will ever be dealt with in a final. way. But<br />
it is an issue on which every incremeiital gain is worth striving<br />
for and which will call for continuing efforts from all of us.<br />
In this respect, it is like most of the great challenges of<br />
politics. There will always be challenges to meet, both long and short<br />
term, in terms of economic progress, in terms of adequate<br />
care for those in need, in terms of building the kind of<br />
world we want, in terms of pursuing our Liberal ' objectives<br />
of freedom, security and opportunity for all.<br />
Young Liberals have a very real contribution to mak~ e in meeting<br />
the challenges of the future, and it is no accident that the<br />
Young Liberal Movement is strongly represented at the highest<br />
levels of the Liberal Party organisation. </p>
<p>9<br />
This representation recognises the value of the Young Liberal<br />
input in discussions of our philosophy and policies. It<br />
recognises the importance of the young Liberal Movement as<br />
a source of strength in Party membership:, and in carrying<br />
the Liberal message to young people especially. And it is<br />
worth noting that the level of Young Liberal representation<br />
at our Federal Council is twelve times higher than the<br />
corresponding level in the Labor Party.<br />
I would like to say how much I have valued the close consultation<br />
I have had with Young Liberals, especially Saul Eslake and<br />
Mark Birrell, throughout 1981, and how much I am looking forward<br />
to a continuation of that close association with your new<br />
Executive. Provided that we work together as one party for<br />
the advancement of Australia, I believe that continuing<br />
success for the Liberal Party and continuing achievement by<br />
Australia are secure. ooo000ooo---</p>
