<p>The Prime Minister, Mr. John Gorton, will make an official visit to Western Australia at the end of this month at the invitation of the Premier, Mr. David Brand.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister, accompanied by Mrs. Gorton, will begin the official visit on Sunday, 29 September. He will return to Canberra on Thursday, 3 October.</p>
<p>The itinerary includes a civic reception by the Lord Mayor of Perth, and lunch with the Premier and West Australian Cabinet Ministers. Mr. Gorton will also attend receptions given by the Perth Chamber of Commerce and by the Liberal Party, and address the 68th Annual General Meeting of the West Australian Chamber of Manufactures.</p>
<p>He will inspect the Kwinana industrial area and the Cockburn Sound installations, visit the port of Fremantle and attend a civic lunch given by the Mayor of Fremantle.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, 2 October he will drive to Bunbury, 115 miles from Perth.</p>
<p>Mr. Gorton said today that he was looking forward to the official visit, and the opportunities it would offer to see developments in the Perth area and to meet and talk with a cross section of the community. This would be a valuable sequel to his recent visit to development projects in the north west of the State and to Kambalda.</p>
