PRIME MINISTER'S PRESS CONFERENCE<br />
PARLIAMENT HOUSE, CANBERRA<br />
TUESDAY, 19 MARCH 1974<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I haven't any announcements to make to you. You had<br />
quite a number given to you by my colleagues after the Cabinet meeting<br />
yesterday. There are some others to be announced but they require<br />
notification to Premiers and meetings of the Executive Council so I<br />
can't do those yet. Are there any questions?<br />
QUESTION: I quote from a very penetrating article in today's " Age"<br />
which I believe is part of your Bible. It concerns President Nyerere' s..<br />
and it says that Nyerere holds some political prisoners and I want<br />
to ask you whether you will now give an undertaking on behalf of<br />
the press people of the world that you will raise the question of<br />
political prisoners with President Nyerere?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I raise, with any Head of Government or State,<br />
matters which affect the relations between Australia and his country.<br />
obviously, this is one of the things which affect relations. I<br />
understand that whenever I go to any country where there are, or are<br />
thought to be, political prisoners that I will be asked questions<br />
about it. As you know I do not go into details about discussions I<br />
have with Heads of State or Heads of Government. No Head of State<br />
or Head of Government does so. I would say this, however, that<br />
Tanzania is one of the most admirable states in the continent of<br />
Africa in the way it is governed. I notice there is a question on<br />
notice and there was also a question without notice from a man whose<br />
consistent scrutiny or even ill-will towards Tanzania are known to<br />
you all. Now the fact is that President Nyerere is the senior member<br />
of the Commonwealth after President Makarios. He was the senior<br />
member of the Commonwealth present at the last Commonwealth Heads of<br />
Government Meeting in Ottawa, last August. In Tanzania there is more<br />
freedom than there is in practically any country in Africa, north,<br />
south, east or west.<br />
QUESTION: Last week after his talks with you, Mr Tonkin was very<br />
confident about the outcome of the Alwest project. Can you say what<br />
reasons he may have had for feeling confident at that stage and what<br />
may have happened in between to change the Government's decision?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: The Government had made no decision on the matter<br />
until yesterday. You will remember that about a month ago we decided<br />
that we would call for reports from the Interdepartmental Committee<br />
on Foreign Takeovers, from the Minister for the Environment and<br />
Conservation and the Minister for Urban and Regional Development on<br />
the Alwest project. It was quite clear in view of the strong report<br />
from the Interdepartmental Committee on Foreign Takeovers that the<br />
Government couldn't, I don't believe any Government could have waived<br />
the variable deposit requirement. The variable deposit requirement has<br />
never been waived yet. This was far from being the most meritorious<br />
application, and there were other features in the environmental field<br />
which gave great misgivings. The Alcoa project is possibly damaging<br />
to Perth's water supply. One could not, without very great<br />
safeguards, be party to permitting an expansion of such projects. You<br />
know the requirement that we made there. We say that the agreement<br />
between the Western Australian Government and the joint venture it<br />
should be amended to provide the detailed environmental investigations / 2 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
to be carried out under the supervision of the Department of the<br />
Environment and Conservation at the joint venturers expense and the<br />
cost of any steps necessary to arrest and/ or correct significant<br />
environmental degradation revealed by continuing investigations be met<br />
by the joint venturers. There is a generally accepted principle now<br />
that the polluter pays. If there is no pollution then no payments are<br />
required. Nevertheless, we know that close to Canberra here the evil<br />
that can flow and the expense to the taxpayers that can arise from<br />
failure by Governments to supervise mining operations. Captains Flat<br />
was mined by a company which left a very great number of slag heaps<br />
there; they are now poisoning Canberra's water supply but the Company<br />
that did it has gone into liquidation. That means the Australian<br />
taxpayer will now have to pay to clean up the mess left by the<br />
company which did its work, made its profits, and then disappeared.<br />
Now Alcoa's operations in Western Australia are causing misgivings<br />
about Western Australia's water supply. Water is the most precious<br />
resource that Western Australia has. I don't believe that the Australian<br />
Government, without whose permission no export can take place from<br />
Australia, can lend itself light-heartedly or without proper<br />
consideration to a further degradation or possible degradation of the<br />
environment. The report of the Department of the Environment and<br />
Conservation has been tabled in the library. There are not enough<br />
copies to distribute to you yet but I guess the West Australian could<br />
get one.<br />
QUESTION: He was so confident after his talks with you that<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I surely don't have to repeat to you that the<br />
Government has considered this twice. The first time was to set these<br />
inquiries in train. The second time was when those inquiries came<br />
in, and the two reports which it is proper to release have been<br />
released.<br />
QUESTION: Would you also consider releasing the IDC report on<br />
foreign takeovers and tabling it in the Library.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No.<br />
QUESTION: Why not?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I would have thought that more than any newspaper<br />
yours would realise why. The reason is that companies seeking<br />
exemption from the variable deposit requirement give confidential<br />
information to the Interdepartmental Committee on Foreign Takeovers.<br />
The information which they give is of very great interest to their<br />
competitors. Quite obviously, therefore, one wouldn't without their<br />
positive approval release that information. This is not the first<br />
time that two of the joint venturers, BHP and Reynolds have sought a<br />
lease over bauxite deposits. They combined in making application for<br />
Gove; another combination won, but nobody has suggested, certainly<br />
nobody from any financial paper has hitherto suggested that the<br />
information given in those circumstances should be released.<br />
QUESTION: Could not an abridged edition of the Interdepartmental<br />
Committee report be produced to eliminate the confidential information.<br />
If not, what can the Government do to inform investors, both<br />
overseas and Australian, what its general policies are on matters of<br />
this sort? / 3 </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER: This can be seen from the decision by the Government.<br />
The Government's decision incorporates the recommendation of the<br />
Interdepartmental Committee on Foreign Takeovers. These were the<br />
words of the Government decision, in effect, which has been conveyed<br />
to the West Australian Government and also to BHP on behalf of the<br />
joint venturers. " The Australian Government agrees that the project<br />
should go ahead providing that the parties, other possible<br />
participants, and the Western Australian Government are able to agree<br />
upon arrangements which esr".... and then I will just now read the<br />
requirements which concern ownership and management. I have already<br />
given you one about the environmental aspects. The ones about foreign<br />
ownership are these: " That the mining operation remains at all times<br />
at least 51 per cent Australian-owned and managed by an Australian<br />
shareholder". And, then, in respect to the refinery aspects the<br />
refinery operations: " That Reynolds invite the Australian Development<br />
Corporation to organise further Australian participation in the<br />
alumina refinery on the basis that any Australian participants in<br />
the refinery would be admitted to the venture on terms and conditions<br />
no less favourable than those applying to prospective overseas<br />
participants and on the basis that Australian participation would be<br />
given preference over foreign participation in the event that known<br />
bauxite reserves prove to be insufficient to support the expansion<br />
of capacity that would be required to accommodate both Australian and<br />
foreign requests for participation." And secondly " that if BHP waives<br />
its ten year option over the refinery or if BHP fails to exercise the<br />
option within 10 years of the date of commencement of the operation<br />
of the refinery, Reynolds transfer the option to the AIDC or to an<br />
interest or group nominated by the AIDC and that the option so<br />
transferred remain current until the expiration of 12 years after the<br />
date of the commencement of the operation of the refinery." Now those<br />
are the recommendations of the Interdepartmental Committee on Foreign<br />
Takeovers and the Government accepted those strong recommendations word<br />
for word. But we can't obviously give the commercial data upon which<br />
the recommendation was made.<br />
QUESTION: Will the next taxation concessions on housing interest<br />
apply to the gross or net incomes of those eligible and could you<br />
estimate the cost to the Government of this concession?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: The proposal flows from the following sentences in<br />
my policy speech, and then I will give the particular answer which<br />
you want, that particular section. " We propose that a limited tax<br />
deductibility be available for interest payments. This tax concession<br />
will be concentrated amongst the groups which bear the greatest<br />
burden. All taxpayers whose actual income is $ 4000 or below will be<br />
entitled to deduct 100 per cent of their interest rate payments.<br />
The-percentage of total interest payments which is deductible will<br />
be reduced by 1 per cent for every $ 100 of income in excess of $ 4000."<br />
Now you ask what will be the income. It will be the actual net income.<br />
QUESTION: Cost to the Government?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Ask the Treasurer that. I think it's here but it<br />
will take a bit of time to look it up.<br />
QUESTION: Will you support any diplomatic moves made by the new<br />
United Kingdom Government that may be opposed to the build up of<br />
the American base at Diego Garcia. 4 </p>
<p>-4-<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Yes. It is in the context, as Senator Willesee<br />
said when you and I were in Burma, that we don't believe that it helps<br />
the littoral States of the Indian Ocean for there to be great<br />
power rivalry. We would hope that there would be an agreement<br />
between the United States and the Soviet Union to restrict their<br />
build-up.<br />
QUESTION: Have you made any representation to the United States<br />
on this matter, Sir?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No. I have discussed it with their representatives<br />
here. I haven't raised the subject but it has come up in conversation<br />
QUESTION: Did you put this point of view to the new British<br />
Government? PRIME MINISTER: No.<br />
QUESTION: Did Cabinet receive a report on the Superphosphate Bounty<br />
from the joint Caucus committee and, if so, was any action taken<br />
on this?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: You know what I haven't got the text of it<br />
here, but you would know the resolution that was passed by the joint<br />
Caucus committees on this subject. The only change which has been<br />
recommended by the Cabinet is that the facilities.... I think the<br />
original resolution was that any industry which thought itself<br />
disadvantaged by the expiry of the Phosphate Fertilizers Bounty Act<br />
at the end of this calendar year could ask that the Industries<br />
Assistance Commission consider forms of assistance appropriate to its<br />
needs, and that the facilities of the Bureau of Agricultural Economics<br />
and other departments be made available to any such industry to<br />
help it prepare its case to the Industries Assistance Commission.<br />
The Cabinet believes that that should be the facilities of the BAE<br />
or through it of relevant departments should be made available to<br />
any industry to help it prepare its case. We believe that it is<br />
appropriate for the BAE, an economic body, to be the appropriate body<br />
for members of the public to approach rather than departments which<br />
have to advise ministers.<br />
QUESTION: This will in fact rule out the Superphosphate Bounty as<br />
such though?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I hope so.<br />
QUESTION: Two questions on the housing interest deductibility scheme<br />
two points on that. Many houses, of course, are owned jointly<br />
by married couples both of whom are working. In that case how will<br />
the interest be deducted, will it be deducted from say just the<br />
main breadwinners net income or will it be split. And the second<br />
point, will it apply just to the first house people own or to the<br />
house in which they are living at the time?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: It will apply to the aggregated actual incomes of<br />
a couple. It will apply to whatever residence is their principal<br />
residence or a loan to extend the accommodation at their principal<br />
residence. </p>
<p>QUESTION: Is actual net income is that different from net taxable<br />
income?. PRIME MINISTER: Yes.<br />
QUESTION: Quite apart from the merits of whether or not the<br />
Superphosphate Bounty should be retained, how do you reconcile your<br />
attitude towards it with what appears to be a contradiction in the<br />
party platform which says the provision of fertilizer subsidies or<br />
words to that effect.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:. The provision in the party policy is in general<br />
terms. It does not purport to say in what years or in what amounts<br />
there will be bounties or subsidies. It might be appropriate to<br />
point out that no Government has done more in a rational sense<br />
to assist the primary industries. This year's Budget spends<br />
million more on primary industries than last year's Budget. The changes<br />
in expenditure are in two fields in particular. First of all we<br />
believe that money should be spent on promoting markets where it is<br />
possible to sell goods. Our predecessors did it the other way around.<br />
They sai6, if you produce anything we will try and find a market<br />
for it. We say, we try to ascertain the markets which are available<br />
and then let the public know, the producers in particular know, where<br />
those markets are, what size they are. And my Government, through<br />
Dr Patterson and Dr Cairns, has found more markets ones we never had<br />
before or bigger entry to ones we already had than any other Government<br />
before. We have done more trade agreements in our fifteen months<br />
in office than our predecessors did in the last fifteen years.<br />
Secondly, where welfare criteria are involved, i. e. where the taxpayers<br />
are being asked to subsidise people because otherwise they are<br />
suffering hardship we are concentrating the assistance on those who<br />
need the assistance most. We are helping people to get proper sized<br />
farms or if they can't get a proper sized farm or if they don't believe<br />
there is a future for them in the industry, we are helping them to get<br />
out of the industry. Our predecessors, by contrast, followed the<br />
practice of giving a subsidy or a bounty per unit of production.<br />
Therefore, the bigger the producer was the more subsidy he got, so<br />
that it meant that people who needed it least or not at all got most.<br />
Those who needed it most, got least or sometimes nothing. Now we<br />
are bringing about a rational allocation of resources and our attitude<br />
towards tariffs, for instance, in the secondary industry has been a<br />
very enlightened one and the primary industries who were always<br />
complaining about the featherbedding which Country Party leaders used<br />
to give to secondary industry are now finding that they have a<br />
Government which heeds their pleas where those pleas are rational.<br />
We have done more in the rational way a responsible way for<br />
producers, primary and secondary, than any Government in Australia's<br />
history. QUESTION: Are you concerned that companies like AMP may be influenced<br />
by the abolition of the bounty to decrease the amount of investment<br />
they make in primary production? / 6 </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER: My heart bleeds for the A. M. P. and its sufferings at<br />
the end-of the Superphosphate Bounty. I agree with what Sir John<br />
McEwen said when the Superphosphate Bounty was cancelled previously.<br />
You will remember that the Labor Party introduced the Superphosphate<br />
Bounty in 1941, just before the Pacific War. And during the wartime<br />
there was price control, there was a loss of overseas markets and<br />
there were also, in the middle forties, some very bad climatic conditions<br />
and the industries needed assistance, but in the three postwar years<br />
incomes in primary industry rose by an average of 38 per cent a year.<br />
That was the case in 1949/ 50, 1948/ 49, 1947/ 48, and relying on this<br />
the new Liberal/ Country Party Government with Sir John McEwen, as<br />
he now ias minister for Commerce and Agriclture, brought in a bill<br />
to cancel the Superphosphate Bounty. He brought it in in November<br />
1950; he made it retrospective to the end of June 1950 and he pointed<br />
out that there was no purpose now in continuing the bounty for the<br />
two purposes for which it had been introduced. One, to educate people<br />
into the advantages of fertilizers. The other was to help them in<br />
lean times. He pointed out that everybody knew the advantages of<br />
fertilizers and things had never been so prosperous. Now relying on<br />
the same arguments, strengthened as they have been, we are allowing<br />
the Phosphate Fertilizers Bounty Act to expire at the end of this<br />
calendar year because in the last three financial years the average<br />
income of primary producers has risen not by 38 per cent as it had<br />
when Sir John McEwen cancelled it previously, but by 48 per cent. And<br />
if we were to extend it for another three years, we would be committing<br />
the taxpayer to find $ 200 million. Now our taxes can be spent for<br />
better purpose than that. Our Government has found markets which our<br />
predecessors lost or never acknowledged and we are helping people<br />
in the primary sector who need it most.<br />
QUESTION: In Opposition, Prime Minister, we were familiar with your<br />
criticisms of inequities in taxation deductions. We heard you point<br />
out that your driver paid, in fact, twice as much for health<br />
insurance as you did.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: The disparity is even greater now because my income<br />
has gone up more than his has since we came into Government.<br />
QUESTION: Now that you are in Government, what are you going to do<br />
about this in such matters as child endownment that have been<br />
brought to your attention by Professor Ronald Henderson's report.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: The Government hasn't considered Professor Henderson's<br />
first report.<br />
QUESTION: Will the Indian Ocean play an important part in your talks<br />
with the President?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I would expect so, I don't think necessarily a<br />
predominant part. As you will realise, President Nyerere and I saw<br />
quite a lot of each other during the 10 days we were in Ottawa at the<br />
Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting and he was very happy to<br />
visit us. One of the first Foreign Ministers to visit Australia<br />
after the change of Government was the Foreign Minister of Tanzania,<br />
Mr Malecela. He is coming with the President on this occasion.<br />
Of course, the Indian Ocean will be one of the things which we will<br />
be discussing. I think I can say without any qualification whatever<br />
that every littoral State in the Indian Ocean hopes that there will be<br />
no escalation or great power rivalry in the Indian Ocean. The Indian<br />
Ocean has been mercifully free of it. We don't want to launch it now. </p>
