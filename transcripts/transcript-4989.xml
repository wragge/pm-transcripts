PRESS OFFICE TRUANSCRIPT15MRH 97<br />
MR. HAYDEN: QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS FOLLOWING HIS ADDRESS<br />
TO NATIONAL PRESS CLUB LUNCHEON, CANBERRA<br />
Frank Char-berlain: ( Agence France Presse)<br />
Givar, that some of your tax proposals will undoubtedly<br />
be misrepresented to terrify the swinging voter, and given that<br />
the swinging voter will determine how many seats will give a<br />
m ajiority in tLhe House of Representatives and maybe the Senate,<br />
given that Mr. Fraser and the coalition parties have control of<br />
the media for all practical purposes and that their publicity<br />
is -more effective than Labor's, what hope is there is a<br />
Labor Government in tChe next decade?<br />
Mr. Hayden:<br />
I understand I'm going to be given a Press Club tie when I finish.<br />
If we let-Frank tie the knot it will a hangman's noose I suspect.<br />
Well I am optimistic. In 1980 I expect the Labor Party to be<br />
returned as a National Government. It will be returned not only<br />
because of the mismanagement of the Fraser Government, and not<br />
only because of the broken promises that litter the pathway of<br />
that Government, but because we have constructed alternatives<br />
and more than that, that we are prepared to take the issues,<br />
the challenges, head-on in a constructive but sensible way.<br />
Now I recognize that M4r. Fraser, indeed, has already signalled<br />
his intention to do this, in a rather hefty way some unkind<br />
people would say clumsy but nonetheless he's done it that<br />
he intends to misrepresent our commitment to these various taxes.<br />
I'm happy to take! that debate on. In many ways it reminds me<br />
of the ingredients of the debate on Medibank where we had to<br />
confront vested, powerful, but minority interests in the<br />
community who were doing so well out of that system, who didn't<br />
want change and preferred to have a system that was unsatisfactory<br />
to the people and quite inefficient in the way it provided<br />
service s because t -hey thought that their own comfort and self-interes<br />
wa= s above the self-interest of the nation. Well, in many ways<br />
thre-is a-iiaiy. There are some small, vested, but<br />
pcwerful and wealthy interests in this community who are going<br />
to resent what we are proposing. No doubt they are going to<br />
bankroll the conservative coalition political parties quite<br />
generously. But that's one of the costs that we must take into<br />
calculation. TWe have a commitment to a much greater responsibility<br />
th-an merely currying favour with powerful, wealthy minority<br />
grcu. ps in this community. We have an obligation, and traditionally<br />
a Tabor Party has sought to discharge it, to protect the rights<br />
of people in this community. We regard ourselves as a Party<br />
of social conscience and flows from this that when we make<br />
decisions on various matters, especially economic matters, we<br />
want to be certain that the distribution of any burden or<br />
sacrifice is fair and equitable. That's what this argument is<br />
about. IfL Mr. Fraser wants to align himself with powerful,<br />
wealthy minority groups in this community, and I have no doubt<br />
that he will, I am happy to enter that debate. I welcome thei<br />
early indications that Mr. Fraser is keen to make this one of the<br />
major issues in the next election. We are already tooling up<br />
for the combat. / 2<br />
15 MARCH 1979 </p>
<p>-2<br />
David Jensen: ( Australian Associated Press)<br />
You are proposing new taxes and you refer to tax weary<br />
Australians, but your new taxes, I understand, are aimed<br />
at larger companies taking a greater share of the tax burden.<br />
Would you reduce any taxes, or would you relieve any taxes<br />
of -the Fraser Government and have you considered perhaps a<br />
lower tax on money earnt on overtime to induce more work<br />
from. people. If I can slip a very quick one in, would you<br />
also welcome Neville Wran and perhaps Bob Hawke on your<br />
front ' bench?<br />
Mr. Hayden:<br />
Just a minute are they going to get paid overtime rates<br />
or not?<br />
If" there is room to reduce taxes in the next Budget, we would<br />
certainly be proposing that. We've got to make a distinction<br />
here. We've outlined a programme for economic recovery based<br />
on the broad parameters available in the 1978-79 Budget.<br />
I believe it is the first time it has ever been done, and done<br />
in detail in the Federal Parliament. There were markedly<br />
different priorities in the proposals we outlined. They<br />
included, among other things, reductions in indirect taxes<br />
and direct taxes for reasons I won't go over again right now.<br />
At this stage we are reasonably sure of the rough parameters<br />
of the next Budget. Before we make any commitments we will<br />
want to see the detailed outline of that Budget. I would expect<br />
there will be some room to make some adjustments but the main<br />
point I am interested in, in presenting to the Australian public<br />
now, is that they are tax-weary and they have every-right to<br />
feel tax-weary. They have been led up the garden path by<br />
the Prime Minister who assured them that he was the leader<br />
of a low-tax Government; the evidence is that the total tax<br />
bill is highe'r than it has ever been, except perhaps in wartime<br />
and that he is determined to raise more taxes in the next<br />
Budget. Now it's obvious because of the commitments that he<br />
has made that he is going to have to raise these taxes. The<br />
question is, where is he going to get the money from. The<br />
ch. oice is quite obvious. Either he puts more burden on a<br />
tax-weary public or he moves to areas which have had remarkable<br />
im: munity in this country, in one of the few countries in the<br />
wor_ 1Ua certainly about the only industrialised country in<br />
tha world in relation to some of these key proposals. Now,<br />
finally, would I welcome Neville Wran and Bob Hawke on the<br />
fron-. bench I certainly would. I've said that on many<br />
occasions. I gather from what Neville said on the weekend,<br />
however, he is pre-occupied in NSW between now and the next<br />
eleot_+_ ion and looks forward to leading his State Party then.<br />
The decision for Bob Hawke is one that he has to make, but<br />
we would certainly welcome him.<br />
Mungo MacCallum: ( various publications)<br />
You started your speech by saying essentially that Mr. Fraser's<br />
forward promises mean that he will have to find an extra<br />
$ 1,000 million worth of revenue somewhere and you've then<br />
outlined the ways in which you would raise that extra $ 1,000<br />
million worth o~ f revenue. Wouldn't it be simpler to simply<br />
abandon some of Mr. Fraser's former promises without arguing<br />
about the equity of the new taxes you propose, and if you / 3 </p>
<p>-3<br />
MLungo MacCallum: ( continued)<br />
are not prepared to abandon them, would you tell us whether<br />
you would in fact reduce the coal export levy, transfer<br />
Government revenue to domestic oil producers, full-stop<br />
valuation, 2 percent real increase in defence expenditure,<br />
elimination of death duties and so on. It seems to me that<br />
you are attempting to raise money by means which you consider<br />
equitable to fulfill Malcolm Fraser's promises, which I<br />
assume you don't.<br />
Mr Hayden:<br />
This week has been a week of rapture and joy for me, except<br />
when the writer of" various publications" rose, because I got<br />
up on Tuesday morning in Melbourne you mentioned me helping<br />
Malcolm Fraser out and read in the newspapers that Kevin Newman<br />
felt he couldn't confidently proceed any further with an<br />
energy policy unless he had my support. I went back to my<br />
office waiting for the phone to ring all day expecting when<br />
I picked it up that the voice on the other end would say<br />
" Bill, it's Mal here, I'm in trouble with the economy". But<br />
then I reflected it's more likely that Leonard Breshnev will<br />
telephone Pope John Paul II to ask for doctrinal correction before<br />
that happens. What I am trying to point out is that a<br />
situation is arising in the next Budget that Mr. Fraser has to<br />
confront as a result of promises he has made. He has one or<br />
two major options open to him. One is that he raises personal<br />
taxes and indirect taxes, and we reject that. The other is that<br />
he moves into these areas that we have spoken about. Now the<br />
next Budget is going to be his Budget, or maybe Andrew Peacock's,<br />
or someone might want to help him out, but someone in the<br />
Liberal Party T expect will be introducing, or in control of<br />
the Parliament, the Government, at the time of the next Budget.<br />
So I am making that point quite strongly. But of course, our<br />
priorities are going to be quite different from them but we<br />
have to understand that some of the things he's proposing<br />
anyway are covered by the things I am recommending. For instance,<br />
the abolition of the excise on the export of coal would in fact<br />
be integrated into the resources rental tax. Similarly, the<br />
petroleum revenue tax would absorb that sort of money, that<br />
$ 110 million, which will be transferred out of revenue in the<br />
next Budget to the domestic petroleum developers of this<br />
cou-ntry. So quite obviously, our whole thrust will be<br />
considerably dif:[ erent from theirs. I don't really have enough<br />
time to outline how completely the philosophical approach and<br />
the sets of priorities as a result of that would be different<br />
from ZMr. Fraser's, but it is implicit in the alternative that<br />
I amn offering that we not only wouldn't do things that he is<br />
proposi~ ng, we would take things in another direction.<br />
Grea Hywood: ( Financial Review)<br />
Besides how much to tax people with jobs, there is a question<br />
-of what to do with people who don't have jobs to be taxed,<br />
and you only covered unemployment very lightly in your speech.<br />
What you did say was your economic programme would generate<br />
abou-t 5 percent non-farm growth resulting in about 130,000<br />
new jobs. Given that a number of people are bound to re-enter<br />
the work force once jobs become available, 130,000 new jobs may<br />
/ 4 </p>
<p>-4<br />
Greg Hywood: ( continued)<br />
not have the impact on existing rates of unemployment it<br />
might first seem. That's assuming your Government could reach<br />
a 5 percent non-farm growth rate. I ask you therefore, what<br />
rate of unemployment you regard as a realistic target in<br />
Austr-alia, and further, to what extent would your Government<br />
be prepared to create jobs by subsidisation? This Government<br />
spe.=-s around $ 120 million on employment and training programmes,<br />
how much would your Government spend?<br />
Mr. Hayden:<br />
What you point out is perfectly true. It's been the experience<br />
in a number of developed countries in recent years, which have<br />
gone through recession and then at an appropriate time sought<br />
to stimulate recovery. In this country we have about a quarter<br />
of a million people hidden unemployed. It's very simple to work<br />
out from workforce participation rates which continue to decline<br />
in Australia. There is no doubt thatL as a recovery gets under way<br />
people who've dropped out of the workforce will start registering<br />
and tend to hold up the rate of unemployment. But then one's<br />
got to point to the positive progress which has been made, and<br />
130,000 jobs iJs a significant rate of advance. Now if it were<br />
possible to achieve a greater rate of advance than that, we would<br />
be in the business of doing that, but it is my own belief, that<br />
is a very sober judgement of the situation, that that would be<br />
about the maximum that you could achieve in the first year and<br />
how much you could achieve in the second year would be determined<br />
by a lot of circumstances, many of which would be quite volatile<br />
and not predictable at this stage. I would see a Labor Government<br />
undertaking a sustained programme of economic recovery and<br />
wearing down that unemployment problem. What is the ultimate<br />
level of unemployment iti this country well, again it depends<br />
on. the philosophical inspiration that guides a political party.<br />
If you believe, as the Government does, and as Treasury does,<br />
and as not a few financial writers do I have noticed, that it<br />
can all be left to the market forces, then you are going to<br />
end up with permanent levels of unemployment in this country<br />
aned a situation which would be regarded as more fully employed<br />
in the economic sense, of around about 4 percent 3 1/ 2% to<br />
4% T believe closer to 4 percent. Certainly the Crawford<br />
Committee of Inquiry had made it abundantly clear the responsiblity,<br />
or thne accuracy, of reliability of that sort of analysis<br />
and furthermore the dangers of leaving the whole process of change<br />
and recovery merely to market forces. This brings in another<br />
matter which is the issue of longer term economic management.<br />
This _ Js lost sight of in the hurly burly of debate about the<br />
cycl--cal problems because they are immediate, they are pressing, and<br />
people are worried about them. But underlying the overall malaise<br />
of the economy is this longer term problem. We are committed<br />
to economic planning. We are also committed to manpower planning.<br />
It's like bringing out a bad relation and presenting him to<br />
rather dignified guests I suppose to say, but we are committed<br />
to iianpower planning. There has been some sort of respectable<br />
reticence about quoting this in our society. Surely the<br />
Crawford Committee Report has made it abundantly clear unless<br />
we start some sort of programme of manpower planning, we are going<br />
to be in dreadful trouble in this country trying to handle recovery<br />
in the years ahead, let alone handling the sorts of economic<br />
competitive economic challenges pressing in on us internationally </p>
<p>Mr. Hayden: ( continued)<br />
alreadv. Now, finally, two points other points you mentioned<br />
what level of unemployment do I regard as historically<br />
achievable in the future for full employment I would be wanting<br />
to see us get around 2 percent or even better, over time.<br />
Now, I don't accept that pessimistic conclusion that we've<br />
got t*-o live with something like 4 percent. That's totally<br />
unacceptable to me. There are so many things to be done in<br />
thisz community. I'm quite convinced that is a matter of<br />
Government having the wit and the wisdom, the determination to<br />
create the policies and get out and start them working in<br />
the commununity.<br />
Finally, would we subsidise employment type programmes?<br />
That's been the whole thrust of what we've been saying for<br />
some time now. We proposed expenditure in the public sector,<br />
directly in that area or through it, in support of the private<br />
sector. In those areas where there is a great deal of slack<br />
capacity, which means simply high levels of unemployed people,<br />
resources which aren't being used which can be brought together<br />
and used productively and that will generate demand not<br />
only for the commodities being produced but multiplying out<br />
within the economy.<br />
We are also prepared to subsidise wages for net additions to<br />
the work force of establishments beyond a specificied date.<br />
The subsidy would be the equivalent of unemployment benefits.<br />
Now, our conclusion is that it is better to subsidise people<br />
who would be otherwise unemployed and unproductive, on unemployment<br />
benefits, in that way productively. They are going to be<br />
happier. There will be much less economic dislocation and a<br />
considerable reduction in social distress.<br />
Looking at a range of things, voluntary early retirement is<br />
another thing that we are looking at. You probably know that<br />
Mick. Young is following in the steps of Freddie Daly, about<br />
to become our next most prominent author, he is writing a book<br />
on -this subject which will detail quite extensively the sorts of<br />
prograrmmes that we have in mind.<br />
Lau-arie Wilson: ( Seven National News)<br />
You'vre been at the helm of the Labor Party now for something<br />
over 12 months and yet we still seem to be reading stories,<br />
hearing discussion about how well you can cope with the pressure;<br />
whether or not you are going to be able to bear the burden<br />
o' leadership. I wonder just how much you are concerned, how<br />
muc; n_ you worry, perhaps how much you are annoyed by the persistence<br />
of Znese stories and whether in fact it worries you that they could<br />
becomne politically damaging in terms of the public mentality<br />
towards your capacity to lead the Labor Party. / 6 </p>
<p>-6<br />
Mr. Hayden:<br />
No, I've been in Parliament 18 years now and one learns<br />
to live with these outrageous slings and arrows of misfortune<br />
that are directed at me, shafted towards me by insensitive<br />
members of the press. I am tempted to do a Gough Whitlam,<br />
with all of its dangers, and say the one -thing that restores<br />
my confEidence is the full knowledge that God walks with me.<br />
But not only is it dangerous, I know it can't be true because<br />
Mr. Bielke Petersen has a monopoly on that right? Although<br />
as one theologan said to me in Brisbane last year, it's not<br />
that he should happen to think that God walks with him that<br />
worries me, i t is that he is so damn sure that he is ahead<br />
of him all the time that disturbs me. Anyway, am I worried?<br />
No, I'm not. I went through Nedibank with all of those<br />
outrageous gossip tales which were going around, pubbed about,<br />
I was rather flattered that so many people took so much of me.<br />
And as my good friend, Mr. McNichol in the Bulletin, making<br />
some obscure references which look like he is politically<br />
grave digging to try and get something going, I just want to<br />
assure you, inspite of any differences I have with Mr. McNichol,<br />
have enormous respect for him. He is a sort of an aged seer<br />
of the press gallery. He is, in many ways we owe him a lot;<br />
what he has done for journalism, what the cylindrical record<br />
did for the recording industry. In fact, you probably gather<br />
I'm starting to look forward to it.<br />
Paul Lockyer: ( ABC)<br />
With a simmering situation persisting in the Queensland ALP,<br />
just what needs to be done now do you think in that State to<br />
give the State Branch perhaps a cohesive base to pose a threat<br />
in State politics there, and not only that but to give you a<br />
solid base to perhaps win Federally?<br />
Mr. Hayden:<br />
The situation there I think probably got more importance and<br />
attention in the media than it deserved and it seems to have<br />
se+.--led down now. As I pointed out, the best regulated<br />
families have their tiffs from time to time. I wouldn't suggest<br />
for a minute that the Labor Party is above that sort of little<br />
co-ntre temps that occurs. I expect that we will be making a<br />
lot progress 4ni Queensland, Federally and of course in association<br />
h our different State branches. We are working out an<br />
integrated systematic programme of campaigning activity. In the next<br />
ewweeks it will be under way and it will start off at a<br />
fairly heavy pace and it will build up. We intend to win in<br />
1930 and our Branch units are just as keen as we are that that<br />
should be achieved.<br />
Lraurie Oakes<br />
I've got three questions. The first one is, which one is the<br />
sixth commandment; secondly, as an alternative to the introduction<br />
of new taxes have you considered possibly introducing a new<br />
gambling game, presumably administered by a friend of the Labor<br />
Party such as Sir John Kerr; and thirdly, can you tell us what<br />
stage your proposal for a wage-tax trade-off has reached. Have<br />
you gotk down to discussing specifics with Mr. Hawke and the<br />
union movement. / 7 </p>
<p>-7<br />
Mr. Hayden:<br />
I'm sure that Mrs. Oakes will be extremely reassured to<br />
know that Laurie doesn't know what the sixth commandment is.<br />
I suppose if Sir John Kerr was in charge of any gambling<br />
game, it would have to be black-jack. The wages-tax<br />
trade-off, well we are in the process of working on that.<br />
Ralph Willis and I have got to do a lot more work. The<br />
Australian Labor Advisory Council, which is a constituent<br />
par-t of our organisation, will be meeting again I think<br />
it is April and Ralph and I will have to produce some<br />
sol2-d material1 there. But we are extremely encouraged by<br />
statements of Bob Hawke. Bob Hawke has said publicly and<br />
repeated at our last ( inaudible) meeting that the situation<br />
he sees in the future is such that while he would want the<br />
union movement to oppose reduction in real wages, because<br />
of the serious unemployment problems we are going to see,<br />
which I referred -to a few seconds ago and you will recall that<br />
Bob was a member of the Crawford Committee of Inquiry, he<br />
would prefer to see additions coming from productivity which<br />
in the normal circumstances would have gone to the wages sector,<br />
being redistributed to help those who would otherwise<br />
be out of work. Now that seems to me to be an extremely<br />
responsible approach from the trade union movement. It is on<br />
that basis we are responding because it slots in very closely<br />
with the sorts of things we have been thinking about.<br />
Stuart Simson: ( National Times)<br />
There are some indications that the economy is growing at<br />
a greater rate than the GDP forecast in the last Budget.<br />
If we are in the throes of some sort of upswing, does this<br />
change the Federal Opposition's economic policy as outlined<br />
after the last Budget, particularly with regard to the level<br />
of Government spending.<br />
Mr. Hayden:<br />
No, I expect that the total level of GDP will be higher<br />
thL-an ' the Government forecast in its Budget. I am most sceptical<br />
as to whether the total level of non-farm GDP will be as high<br />
the Government forecast in the Budget. The increase in<br />
th_' e total GDP comes as a result of good weather, happy<br />
c*-rcumstances for the farm sector, in some areas only. It has<br />
lost sight of the fact that, by many commentators, that there<br />
are still substantial areas of the farm sector which are<br />
deonressed. Now, you've got to look at the different approach<br />
W.* Iich our proposals reflected in the alternative Budget to those<br />
ad. opted by the Government. We are concerned about two things;<br />
ir~ nging down inflation and bringing down unemployment. The<br />
e-iidence is quite clear that in spite of the movements which<br />
have been taking place in the economy, and I would want to see<br />
a lot more solid evidence over a sustained period before I<br />
change my attitude on the thrust of what we are proposing,<br />
but in spite of whatever movements might be showing up predictions<br />
comzzig from within the Public Service and from within other<br />
informative sources, is that unemployment will continue its<br />
inexorable rise and that we will see something like more<br />
than 9 percent of unemployment unemployment among the work force<br />
members in the near future. We are going to see increased<br />
interest rates, that inflation is going to be jammed. The last<br />
/ 8 </p>
<p>8-<br />
Mr. Hayden: ( continued)<br />
Budget did nothing for -these problems. What we are saying<br />
is -that Government programmes have to be implemented which<br />
will generate activity and create jobs, and secondly, that<br />
that has to be done in areas which will not aggravate inflation<br />
and thirdly, by a judicious cut in indirect charges of . taxes<br />
at the Government level, instead of the increases the Government<br />
introduced; bring down inflation. Now, our calculations of<br />
the~ inflationary effect of the Government measures was spot on,<br />
just as our calculation of the reduction in inflation by the<br />
scrr-s of changes we are talking about, bringing about a 2.5 percent<br />
reducti1on is a fairly reliable assessment of the benefits of<br />
our programme. It is a different approach entirely to what<br />
the Government is adopting. We just won't accept that more<br />
unemployment must mean more inflation and when you get more<br />
arnd more unemployment and you run into trouble like the,<br />
present situati..-on with inflation starting to jam and perhaps<br />
tilting upwards, the Government presumably considering<br />
resorting to even more unemployment or at least being quite<br />
calm and indifferent at the prospects of unemployment on the<br />
advice of its own Department in this area exceeding 9 percent<br />
in the near future.<br />
Max Hawkins: ( Brisbane Telegraph)<br />
May I ask you on a couple of other matters relating to ALP<br />
affairs in Queensland: although the Queensland ALP Parliamentary<br />
leader in Queensland, Mr. Ed Casey, has voiced strong opposition<br />
you have said very little, if anything, on whether or not you<br />
support Senator Georges and Mr. Uren as Federal Members of your<br />
caucus in -their part icipation in street marches in Queensland.<br />
What is your-attitude to this issue and secondly, how regularly<br />
do you expect to sit on the new Queensl and State Administrative<br />
Coimtmittee of the ALP and if you aren't able to sit, who if anyone<br />
will represent you?<br />
Mr. Hayden: w,: 7 mhkee decision wh ilrepresent me when I can't<br />
sit there. Of course quite obviously the appointment and the<br />
proposal, or the provision of the rule, was based on the<br />
assumption that the Leader's respectively, State and Federal,<br />
W0o U. ld attend as -much as they could. My attitude on the street<br />
marches has been one that I have consistently expressed and<br />
tha--t is that Senator Georges and Mr. Uren are perfectly<br />
en-titl" sed to participate in those demonstrations if that is<br />
their inclination, if they have concluded that that is what<br />
thex' should do according to their conscience, according to<br />
theIr belief of how important thtmteis I have defended<br />
thei.-_-ight to do that. It doesn't mean that I believe that<br />
that is my priority commitment. It is not at all. I believe<br />
as leader of the Labor Party I have other constructive, and<br />
I susoect more effective, ways of trying to bring change about<br />
and I pursue those to various forums which are available.<br />
Trevor Gilmour: ( West Australian)<br />
A necessary prerequisite to implementing any of the economic<br />
priorities you have outlined here today is the process of<br />
winning seats. Western Australia and Queensland in particular<br />
in the past have been weak links in the Labor Party's performances. / 9 </p>
<p>9<br />
Trevor Gilmour:( continued)<br />
You've referred to the Queensland situation, I wonder if<br />
you would like to see some action on the West Australian<br />
front. Could you detail your thoughts on that point please?<br />
Mr. Harden:<br />
Well tne State Branch of the Party in Western Australia<br />
took a poll out in that State a few months ago. It shows us<br />
Federally well ahead of the present Government so I can't<br />
complain. In terms of seats, well, you know that the<br />
re-distribution makes it very tough for us in Western Australia.<br />
We had hoped to probably pick up two seats as things stand<br />
now, but there has to be another re-distribution because of<br />
population growth so really the whole speculation is in the<br />
melting pot until we see how that redistribution comes out.<br />
Bill D'Arcy<br />
I assume the Labor Party is still committed to the creation<br />
of an egalitarian society, you certainly alluded to that during<br />
your speech. Given that the Labor Party is committed to the<br />
restoration of Medibank in its original form, given that the<br />
Labor Party believes in health care for all, why is the Labor<br />
Party allowing a free vote on the Lusher motion, a motion which<br />
has nothing to do with the question of abortion but has everything<br />
to do with making health care the right of the rich?<br />
Mr. Hayden:<br />
That's not quite true. I am assured by the Medibank<br />
practitioners that even if Lusher's motion were to be carried<br />
that there are ample items under the Health Insurance proposals<br />
which would cover abortion-type procedures, but put that to<br />
one side. Why are we allowing a free vote? Well, there a lot<br />
of people who have very strong feelings on this and they are<br />
deeply held. They are religiously based and their attitudes<br />
have to be respected. They would see, and do see, the proposals<br />
as methods which recognise and facilitate abortion-type procedures<br />
and to them it is a rather crunching experience to be told<br />
if that were to happen that they would have to support that sort<br />
of change against their will, against their firmly held, quite<br />
deeply held beliefs. They are in no different position from<br />
peopne like Bill D'Arcy and me who believe that Mr. Lusher's<br />
recommendation ought to be tossed out. If we were to be<br />
confronced by a situation where people oppose, or support the<br />
Lusher view is a better way of putting it, sought to bound us<br />
to saupcrt the Lusher motion. It's the last thing I would want<br />
to d o. The final thing is just a matter of plain politics.<br />
Once a Party starts binding all of the members of that Party<br />
to vote on this matter or matters like this in the Parliament<br />
then it is London to a brick that the people on the other side<br />
of the House are going to be bound too and the chances of people<br />
exercising independent judgement on these matters, and I hope<br />
would hope prevailing against the Lusher amendment, would be<br />
totally destroyed. So whichever way you look at it, the<br />
justification to me is quite overwhelming. / lO </p>
