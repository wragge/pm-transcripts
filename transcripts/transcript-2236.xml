THE TASMAN PARTNERSHIP<br />
Statement Issued b1y the Prime Ministers c Australia<br />
and New Zealapdat Canberra on 5 June, 1970<br />
We have reviewed the community of purpose which inspires<br />
all our dealings as partners across the Tasman. We believe that our<br />
two Nations have attained a degree of harmcny unique in international<br />
relations. We believe also that as our two countries l~ ace up to the<br />
challenges of a rapidly changing world they must nurture the full<br />
strength of this spirit in order that the Australia/ Nlew Zealand partnership<br />
may attain its highest potential. This joint commit tnent should not be<br />
pursued as an end in itself but rather as a bilateral e2ifort at Government<br />
level which will, in turn, reinforce the aspirations coi our two peoples<br />
to promote a tangible improvement in the climate of international relations.<br />
In the final analysis, therefore, the fruits of Trans-Tasman collaboration<br />
are intended to benefit the nations with which Australia and New Zealand<br />
are associated in the wider search for peace and security in the world.<br />
Over the past year, it has been rewarding for Australians<br />
and New Zealanders to join in celebrating the epic voyages of Captain<br />
James Cook two centuries ago. After this firSt common strand in our<br />
history there came a parallel sequence of exploration, settlement and<br />
economic and social development. Moreover, it is no accident that<br />
in times of stress and challenge, the threads of our history have again<br />
been intertwined. Our partnership was baptized by the gallantry at<br />
Callipoli and during the last world conflict. The C" anberra Pact is a<br />
contnqtrg pledge by Australia and New Zealand to joini their efforts<br />
in peace as in war, and thus to forge a lasting bond between the two<br />
nations. It is fitting, therefore, that we should in 111970 meet in this<br />
same spirit of partnership to intensify the range of our joint co-operation,<br />
for the logic of history and the realities of political and economic geography<br />
suggest that Australia and New Zealand should act in close concert one<br />
with the other. Indeed, if our two peoples are to fu] lfil the vocation of<br />
nationhood in the modern world, their energies should be harnessed in the<br />
most productive way.<br />
In charting the future course of Australia, New Zealand<br />
partnership, we continue to be guided by the following principles: ./ 2 </p>
<p>On all major matters affecting our common interest, including<br />
tile conduct of our international relations, whether at the regional<br />
level, in the Commonwealth context, in the United Nations or<br />
elsewhere, we will continue the closest bilateral consultation:<br />
recognising that there are cases in which our national interests<br />
may not be indentical or in which we may adopt different<br />
approaches to the solution of common problems, the habit of<br />
sustained contact between our two Governments assumes special<br />
importance. In questions of Defence, the co-ordination of effort in areas<br />
such as planning, purchasing, standardisation of equipment,<br />
training and operational procedures should be regarded as a<br />
first priority by our Armed Services.<br />
In the field of Trade, the good progress made under the aegis<br />
of NAFTA should be consolidated and expanded to lead to the<br />
maximum flow of trade and the highest practicable degree of<br />
economic rationalisation between the two countries in the<br />
interests of their national development.<br />
The administrative effort of both Governments should be directed<br />
towards facilitating increased collaboration in all fields.<br />
Attempts by non-Governmental agencies to promote new areas<br />
of Australian/ New Zealand co-operation, or to lend greater<br />
substance to the wide range of existing contact between our two<br />
peoples should be encouraged.<br />
