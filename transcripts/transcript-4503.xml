FOR PRESS 26 SEPTEMBER 1977<br />
ADDRESS AT QUEENSLAND CONFEDERATION OF INDUSTRY DINNER, BRISBANE<br />
Thank you for the invitation to address you. Tonight I would like<br />
to take this opportunity to talk about the Government's actions in<br />
a number of areas related to Australia's economic wellbeing and<br />
prosperity, and particularly with respect to manufacturing industry..<br />
Since coming to Government we have pursued a consistent and<br />
coherent economic strategy aimed at reducing inflation, and at<br />
providing the private sector with the room and incentive to grow....<br />
Given the situation Labor created, nearly 200000 additional<br />
unemployed in one year, inflation at a peak of 19%, Treasurer<br />
succeeded by Treasurer, excess by excess the Government's<br />
achievemwents-have been significant.<br />
We promised we would halt the growth and extravagance of big<br />
government._ This we have done. Last year, the Government's<br />
share of gross domestic product fell for the first time in years.<br />
The number of Commonwealth employees has been reduced by 12,000.<br />
Under Labor's policies, they would have risen by 19,000.<br />
We promised we would reduce inflation. When we came to office it<br />
was running measured by the CPI adjusted for hospital and medical<br />
services at 16.7%. By the end of June this year it was down to<br />
10.2%, and other indicators show it has gone down further still.<br />
One major factor in this success was that we significantly reduced_<br />
the Government deficit by half a billion dollars in each of two; o<br />
successive Budgets.<br />
A second major factor was that, because of our policies, wage costs--.<br />
grew less rapidly in I 76-77 than in the preceding year. Because<br />
of our ability to reduce inflation and set the conditions for<br />
further economic growth we have been able to take a first step,,,<br />
towards a sustainable lowering of interest rates. We promised<br />
we would restore the conditions necessary for company profitability<br />
to return to more normal levels. In the financial year just ended<br />
company profits increased by 23.5%. We promised we would reform<br />
the crippling tax system and significantly cut taxes. This too we<br />
have done. Because of our restraint on Government spending we were<br />
able to introduce personal tax indexation and major company tax.<br />
reforms for corporate taxpayers in our first Budget. / The same </p>
<p>The sa-ne commitment: to restraint enabled us to make a revolutionary<br />
ref orm to the personal tax scales in our second Budget) a<br />
revolutionary reform that restores the incentive to work harder-:-<br />
and more productively, and to earn more. We saw how damaging<br />
Labor's-high taxes-were to the individual and the economy. W<br />
were determined as-a Go'Ynment to set the conditions* in which<br />
all Australians had-the opportunity to regain the prosperity-and.-<br />
freeaom of choice-to exercise initiative and achieve their ownM<br />
goals. The new tax-system introduced -in the last Budget pr-ovided..,<br />
tax cutszfor people at-all income-levels every taxpayer will -be<br />
better off. No one will pay tax on the first $ 3,750 of Income*,:-<br />
and 90% of taxpayers will pay only-one rate, 32 cents in the:-<br />
dollar on the remiainder. . The weekly tax payable by, say, a.-<br />
person with ' a dependent spouse -will from next February be--<br />
markedly less than -that payable under Mr. Hayden's tax scales.;-~--<br />
If he earns $ 120 a week, his tax bill will be down 65%. If ei<br />
earns $ 300 a week, his tax bill will be dpwn<br />
The tax reform will be of particular benefit to small businessmen--<br />
They not only will have their tax reduced, but as-earners of<br />
. widely' fluctuating incomes, they will gain more than most ppople.-&gt;<br />
from the new -standard rate applying over a wide income range.<br />
. Ia zesult of this tax reform and -tax indexation, taxpayers,,.<br />
will save $ 1,371 million this year, $ 1,857 next year.<br />
Et is clear that these are huge sums. They represent enoros..-<br />
sav'ings savings that were only. possible because of the<br />
restraint we exercised over. Government spending.<br />
In 1977-78, unrelenting pressure on inflation will be maintainiedl<br />
and fur-&amp; ther economic progress will be made. Demand and activity<br />
axe expected to gather pace over the course of the year...<br />
increased domestic demand will again be concentrated in the<br />
private sector, and gross non-fa=~ product shorild increase by<br />
over 4W between the June quarter. of 1977 and 1978.<br />
And we will do this despite the efforts of some people in the<br />
Parliament to ' undermine the economy.<br />
Iwant to sa'y that there are many things that are legitimate and V<br />
proper political practice in a democracy the Opposition j<br />
ound to criticise the Governaent, and the Government no<br />
responds in kind. But-there are areas where partisan pltc<br />
has no place and the value of the nation's currency is one ' 1<br />
t-se areas. Whnen a ' arliamentarian -not an academuic, -not a-<br />
&amp;~~ e~ zitrbat a formner Treasurer -consistently makes statextents . t<br />
' Phiach cast doubt on our, external position, he is behaving with-,..<br />
_-z--xesponsibillty. lie ia deliberately trying to weaken<br />
t~ n-eu s~ alandollar ard our ability to attract internatio; a.*-:. V<br />

~ rL1-pell as Treas urer. lie is cynically trying to weaken<br />
._. Ler1CY. IEe is suibordinating the national interest to the-V<br />
~ u~ of partisan politics, and there is no doubt about how<br />
-Lhe Astralian people will respond. They will conden~ n him for<br />
i-they will. condemn his party. / I ha~ ve </p>
<p>-3<br />
I have so far outlined the broad sweep of our economic policy<br />
and the contribution it has made to the improvement of the<br />
Australian economy.. Now I would like to focus on two parts<br />
of our total approach our industrial relations policy and our<br />
manufacturing policy.<br />
We have taken constructive action to improve Australia's<br />
industrial relations framework, so unions and management can<br />
more effectively comnunicate and settle their differences..<br />
and arbitration and a determination to reform industrial legisla-<br />
-tion, so that the canons of equity, justice and protection of-4i:<br />
individual civil liberties in other areas of our law apply in<br />
1 this area.<br />
In our first'twenty two months of office, as we promiused, we have:-<br />
legislated for secret postal ballots for the election of off icers-'<br />
of unions registered under the Conciliation and Arbitration Actand<br />
to require new elections at least every four years. Aswe::-<br />
promised, we have established the Industrial Relations Bureau and*.<br />
the National Labour Consultative Council. As we promixsed, we have<br />
amended the Trade Practices Act to ban damaging secondary boycotts.-<br />
We have legislated to give the Government the necessary powers to-, 7<br />
suspend, dismiss and stand down Commonwealth employees in<br />
particular circ tances.<br />
Our firm but fair industrial policy has met with considerable<br />
Isuccess. In the first six months of this year.. Austxalia has had<br />
the lowest level , of industrial disputes, and the least number of<br />
working days ost during this decade. In the first Bix montbs of;<br />
1974, 4,214,000 working days were lost through industrial disputes.<br />
In the first six months of this year, 718,000 days were lost a,-<br />
reduction of 83% on the position three years ago. As a result of.<br />
our secret ballot legislation, unions are making gceater use of<br />
the Electoral Office to run their elections. In. the twelve months:<br />
since the legislation was introduced, there were 244 such applica. t-<br />
HButtio ns. there is evidence that a few unions have not fully complied<br />
with the legislation. The Arbitration Inspectorate has found<br />
4 evidence of recent breaches by two unions the Analgamated<br />
Metal Workers and Shipwrights Union, the the Builders Labourers<br />
SIFederation. If the industrial Registrar confirms that breaches':"<br />
have occurred, new elections fully conform~ ing with the Act will-. J.*,<br />
have to be held or the unions concerned will face prosecution._<br />
This valuable work of monitoring compliance with the Act will-.<br />
shortly be taken over b~ y the Industrial Relations Bureau.<br />
I Despite these great improvements, disruptive industrial disputesparticularly<br />
in the construction, mining arnd maritime industries-<br />
31 are seriously Impeding economic recovery. Though the statistics<br />
show a marked improvement, extremist union leaders have become<br />
more skilled in creating the maximum of disruption and dislocation.<br />
while using smaller numbers of workers. The Government Is<br />
deter-mined to uphold the law in industrial relations. The<br />
time has passed when the law Is applied in every area except<br />
industrial relations. The Government's firm stance over the<br />
air controllers and p6stal workers disputes should leave no-one<br />
in any doubt about our resolve on this. / We<br />
I. </p>
<p>We will be bringing down further legislation in this session,<br />
alfter due consultation with the National Labour Consultative<br />
Council, on the , Industrial Relations Bureau and on the protectic<br />
of the rights of -individual unionists.<br />
over the last few years, manufacturing industry an industry<br />
which provides almost one quarter of our national production,<br />
supplies-one f ifth -of our'exports, and employs* over 20% of ' our<br />
workforce has faced multiple problems. We are committed to<br />
establishing the conditions in which industry can confidently<br />
-ace the future -conditions in which it can take long-tem. n<br />
Investment and employmnt decisions with greater certainty.<br />
Our actions give substance to this commitment. We have intkodf:<br />
the investment allowance, and just extended it for two years.<br />
Re have introduced the trading stock valuation adjustment, and<br />
. increased the retention allowance for private companies. Th-esc<br />
reforms have helped the acute financial strains the taxation sy<br />
imposed on business. In this financial year, they will reduce<br />
tax payable by companies by about $ 600 million, which significr<br />
exceeds the estimated yield of $ 203 million from the inc: rease ;' I<br />
* company tax.<br />
our industry policy aims at assisting the operations of privatce<br />
industry. This is shown by our actions in the recent Colgate-<br />
Palmolive application before the Prices Justification Tribunal.<br />
to protect the rights of companies to determine their ow-n level.<br />
of adverti. sing; by our instituting comprehensive consultative<br />
machinery with industry; by our establishment of a Ministerial<br />
Purchasing Committee to give preference to local industry.<br />
Oujr stand on protection Is unequivocal. We will not reduce<br />
itrotectiol where this would lead to greater unemployment or<br />
. rcduced economic activity. We will provide industry with the<br />
degree of security and stability it needs.<br />
P~ a_! y in this Government's term, we wrote to the l[ AC to ensure<br />
that aII 1AC reports gave due consideration to the employmenteffects<br />
of its recommendations. The draft 1AC report on Textil,<br />
Clothing and Footwea r, however, made it clear that amendments t..<br />
, he Act were necessary if the Government's policy was to be<br />
. implemented, and we acted inunediately to restore confidence and<br />
maintain employment in these industries, arnd to guarantee the<br />
p) resent level of activity for three years. The Government<br />
~ naanfully cordntteZ1 to the principle of independent inquiry<br />
~ zoi-dQustzy assistance matters.*<br />
';' Ilme Government's changes will mDake sure, first, that the IAC wl.* AW<br />
ke into account the need for a balanced development of industx<br />
i the tustaineed growth of the Australian economy. Second,-thAt<br />
~: aares to achieve structural change will only be at a rate<br />
~ ttACeconomy can absorb. Third, tha~ t any such changes will<br />
lead to added unemployment or capital wastage. Fourth, thc<br />
n -il~ ster will be able to issue supplementaxy guidelines to the<br />
n srpecial circxnnstances. Fifth, reporting guidelines for<br />
tj) 1AC will be written into the Act. </p>
<p>In ' the. current circ%= mstances, we. have decided not to-send the<br />
: AC -_ the ; five: remaining references on metal products under the<br />
tariff-review-programwne. Reference to the IAC would have damaged<br />
confidence . and-resulted ina a major-cuxtailment of investment<br />
plans ini the' industry.<br />
Mr. 0 Presidentj major . advances have been made in establishing a<br />
climate in which industry cart plan and invest with confidencein.'<br />
which new opportunities exist for business initiatives and<br />
new. investment.-While profits in some industries are still not<br />
high enough, profits . are moving the right way not the wrong<br />
way as they did in the dismal years of 1974 and 1975. we<br />
all have a-part to play in economic recovery business leaders#<br />
unions and the Arbitration Commission. 4 The private sector employi<br />
mo~ st of the workforce and makes most of the decisions. -it<br />
develops the technologies which carn underpin improvements-in.<br />
living standards.. The. Arbitration Commission needs to un~ derstandthat<br />
a decision of the sort it made in the last national wagecase,<br />
which gave an even greater degree of indexation than<br />
applied on average, 4nL-1976-77 slows down economic recovery.<br />
Trade union 14aders must consider-. the unemployment consequences<br />
of their demands for higher pay for those presently in jobs.<br />
Because we have reined-in Government expendituxe, because people:.<br />
bave been provided wiith much needed tax reforms which will-foster<br />
enterprise, and initiative, because business has been provided<br />
with assistance and room to grow, b~ ecause the inflation rate<br />
has been reduced, -the conditions for a return to full prosperity'-<br />
ate clearly emerging.<br />
For full prosperity to be-realised, we all have to take a<br />
decision to co-operate with one another to mobilise effectively 2:.<br />
our abundant natural and human resources in the nation's<br />
interest. I have no doubt that people around Australia<br />
have taken that a~ edlslon. </p>
