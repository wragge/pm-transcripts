PRIME MINISTERES PRESS CONFERENCE PARIS<br />
7 JANUARY 1975<br />
The following is the transcript of a press<br />
conference given by the Prime Minister, The Hon.<br />
E. G. Whitlam, in Paris at 1800 hours on 7 January 1975:<br />
Begins: Are there any questions ladies and gentlemen?<br />
uestion: Mr Prime Minister, would it be possible to ask if<br />
in principle a tripartite uranium deal with Japan and France<br />
has been decided upon? U. AANtM-t<br />
Prime Minister: As you are aware Japan and Australia are<br />
conducting a feasibility study into the enrichment of<br />
Australian uranium deposits in Australia. Neither of us has<br />
the technology required. You have also been informed, a couple<br />
of days ago, that there will be British officials visiting<br />
Australia in a couple of months time in this connection. They<br />
may be accompanied by West German and Dutch officials because<br />
Britain, The Netherlands and West Germany share one particular<br />
form of uranium enrichment. Any discussion with French officials<br />
would take place after that.<br />
Question: May I ask a supplementary question my Prime RENcA<br />
Minister, the French Consul in Australia is a nuclear physicist * AL.<br />
and has been carrying on discussions with the Australian Atomic<br />
Energy Commission for some two years. Is this irrelevant?<br />
Prime Minister: I didn't know this..<br />
Question: Could you tell us the main points of your talk<br />
with President Giscard d'Estaing?<br />
Prime Minister: The President's and my conversations were<br />
purely tete-a-tete and I therefore would rather not list subjects<br />
we discussed. Also, you will notice I answered the<br />
' question outside any context of discussions I had with<br />
itue Prebident in particular. I think it ought to be sufficient<br />
for me to say that in the tete-a-tete with Prime Minister Chirac<br />
yesterday and President Giscard d'Estaing today a wide range of<br />
matters of common interest was discussed. I mustn't specify<br />
clearly what the subjects were or were not.<br />
Question: Could you tell us Why you made a public apology<br />
to the skipper of the Illawarra? sm<br />
Prime Minister: An explanation by the Captain was brought to VPU<br />
my notice.<br />
Question: Do you intend to ask Mr Chirac to come to<br />
Australia. </p>
<p>-2<br />
. CL wMt.<br />
Ji 41NCN~ Prime Minister: I'm having dinner with him tonight and I<br />
did have this in mind.<br />
Question: . Mr Prime Minister has any progress been. made<br />
during your visit to establishing a cultural or scientific<br />
agreement between France and Australia?<br />
Prime Minister: This was raised in the talks between the two<br />
sides yesterday afternoon and I'm confident that the preparation<br />
of both cultural and scientific agreements will proceed<br />
quite rapidly. We would be very happy indeed to have such<br />
agreements with France because France's cultural pre-eminence<br />
has been known for centuries and her scientific achievements<br />
for some decades.<br />
Question: Does Australia maintain a continuing objection<br />
to French nuclear testing even if its not in the atmosphiere.<br />
Would you state precisely what that objection is and will that<br />
be a factor in any uranium deals of whatever sort between<br />
Australia and France?<br />
Prime Minister: Australia would rather there were no nuclear<br />
testing at all. Nevertheless nuclear testing does proceed<br />
underground and has for some years.<br />
Question: Will it affect Australia ? 7<br />
Prime Minister: I have nothing to add to the answer I gave to<br />
your colleague from the Australian Financial Review.<br />
Question: Would Australia sell uranium to any country if it<br />
were using that uranium to make nuclear weapons?<br />
Prime Minister: I've got nothing more to say on this than I've<br />
already said. You know quite well what the Australian Government's<br />
attitude is to sales of uranium in one form or another.<br />
Question: Could you elaborate on this for the French... .0<br />
Prime Minister: Well what I've said previously is that all the<br />
sales we've made up till now have been within the terms of the<br />
IAEA safeguards. 4<br />
Question: Since France has not signed the Nuclear Non-<br />
Proliferation Treaty and does not accept the IAEA safeguards<br />
does that rule out the possibility of Australia selling<br />
uranium to it?<br />
Prime Minister: No further comment.<br />
Question: Could you tell us why you won't comment o~ n<br />
that rather crucial and controversial aspect?<br />
Prime Minister: It appears quite clearly from the first quaestion<br />
I was asked today and the answer I gave to it.<br />
Question: Could you please state again why you won't<br />
answer this question? </p>
<p>-3<br />
Prime Minister: I said that any discussions on this matter<br />
would take place " any", " ol" take plage after those<br />
that have already been arranged. . Aol-<br />
Question: Are you considering reconstructing the Atomicwto<br />
Energy Commission in Australia along American lines by aplit-( SM11100M<br />
ting it so as to diversify the defence aspects and the economic<br />
energy aspects?<br />
Prime Minister: No consideration has been given to this so far<br />
and I won't speculate as to what may be done.<br />
Question: Have you no worries about the powers given to<br />
the Atomic Energy Commission under the present Act?<br />
Prime Minister: No consideration has been given to altering those<br />
powers. Question: The question about the tripartite cooperation<br />
between France and between Australia and Japan in fact has been<br />
discussed before the Labor Government camne into power.<br />
Prime Minister: Not I think with Japan had it?<br />
Question: Yes I believe it had.<br />
Prime Minister: Oh well I didn't know that.<br />
Question: ( unclear0 why are you so secretive about these<br />
discussions?) Prime Minister: We have made arrangements for some discussions<br />
and any further discussions would take place after the discussions<br />
which have already been arranged. Those are the only discussions<br />
which have been arranged0<br />
Question: Did you explai.. your views on the future of the<br />
South Pacific region with the e'renich leaders? What did you say<br />
and what were their comments?<br />
Prime Minister: This wasn't discussed yesterday or today. It<br />
was recently discussed about a month ago when Mr Froment Meurice<br />
was in Canberra0<br />
Question: Could we know a bit more about what you said to<br />
him? Prime Minister: I'd rather you aske4( ne a specific question as to<br />
attitude on any particular aspect. There again I don't believe<br />
it appropriate for me to detail discussions which have been<br />
tete-a-tete.<br />
Question: What is the future of Franco/ Australian<br />
relations? Prime Minister: I believe there will be a considerable increase<br />
in relations between France and Australia. M. Segard, the<br />
Secretary who deals with Overseas Trade is soon to visit<br />
Australia and -he is interested, I believe, in the whole range<br />
of matters which can come within trade between the two countries0 </p>

C4AJW' 7A. 4" L-<br />
4. cAoumwnIC Question: Do you envisage any cultural exchanges<br />
between the two countries?<br />
Prime Minister: I certainly hope so. One of your<br />
colleagues asked a question about Cultural and Scientific<br />
Agreements between France and Australia. We are anxious<br />
to have such Agreements. My Government has made cultural<br />
agreements with several countries and scientific agreements<br />
with some countries in the two years that we have<br />
been in office and we were very happy indeed at the : prospect<br />
of such agreements with France.<br />
Question: In your discussions with M. Chirac did you<br />
discuss the development of the situation in Southern<br />
Africa and the difference in Australia's and France's<br />
approach to South Africa?<br />
Prime Minister: This wasn't raised.<br />
Question: Could you tell us what is exactly the<br />
~ 4N&amp; OJ~ oah') Australian stand on non-prolif eration and what do youL thin]<br />
of the French stand France not joining the Treaty butsa<br />
ing it would comply with the clauses of the Treaty.<br />
Prime Minister: There is a prospective conference to review<br />
the Treaty and I believe it is in that context that these<br />
matters may be discussed and promoted. W<br />
Question: Did you re eor did you ask during your<br />
discussions with the Frenc IA ister the firm guarantee that<br />
French atmospheric nuclear testing in Pacific has now ended?<br />
Prime Minister: No<br />
Questions: Can I ask you why?<br />
Prime Minister: I rely on public statements by the President<br />
and his Ministers.<br />
Nfcmo of Question: Did you discuss the problem of Australia buying<br />
Lj oot some aircraft from France?<br />
Prime Minister: Yes. There is active consideration being n<br />
to the purchase of further aircraft for Australia's dcmest*<br />
airlines and there is competition in particular between the<br />
Tristar and the Airbus and it is a very difficult decision for<br />
us to make. The domestic airlines which are not as confident<br />
in Australia, any more than domestic airlines seem to be in<br />
any other country, that there will be such an increase in<br />
business as there was in recent years, are not really urging<br />
the acquisition of these aircraft as much now as they ' were<br />
several months ago. Therefore the whole question is not as<br />
urgent at the moment as it was say in the middle of 1974 but<br />
it's very difficult to make up our minds between these two<br />
exce' Lent aircraft. I'm not a technical man so it might be<br />
invidious for me to compare the qualities which appeal to us<br />
in these matters.<br />
Question: Can you explain to us the Australian position<br />
on the French proposals for tripartite Energy Conference. </p>
<p>Ar Prime Minister: We are attracted to the French proposals F'C(. Y<br />
that there be consultations rather than confrontation cowl( a4<br />
in these matters and we were very interested indeed to<br />
hear from the Prime Minister and his colleagues the proposals<br />
for the preliminary conference and their views as<br />
to how soon there could be a conference itself Australia<br />
has however to await the agenda of the conference before<br />
it would give further commitments to attending it, but the<br />
general idea of having consultations is attractive to us<br />
and I believe it has been a most valuable initiative by<br />
the French Government.<br />
Question: On the question of the Energy Conference<br />
would it be true to say that you are more concerned with<br />
transportation problems than supply problems?<br />
Prime Minister: It would be true to say that transportation<br />
is a bigger worry for Australia than supply but it would be<br />
quite wrong to say that supply wasn't also a worry but we<br />
do not depend on other countries as much for supply as we<br />
do for transportation.<br />
Question: Do I gather that Australia has been or may<br />
0 be invited to the Energy Conference ( unclear)<br />
Prime Minister: That is to the major conference?<br />
* Question: Yes<br />
Prime Minister: I would think it's quite likely that we will<br />
be invited to the major conference. We are not of course<br />
invited to the preliminary one.<br />
Question: Mr Prime Minister, were the declarations of<br />
Dr Kissinger about possible military intervention in the<br />
Middle East discussed during your talks in Paris and if<br />
possible what is your point of view?<br />
Prime Minister: I don't want to~ comment on this. Dr Kissinger<br />
was asked a hypothetical question and it seemed to me he was<br />
at pains to give a very guarded answer to that question. Now<br />
I don't believe that it helps if I elaborate on this matter or<br />
if I speculate on it.<br />
Question: Mr Prime Minister in your discussions with<br />
C-P0001A Mr Sauvagnargues, the Foreign Minister, did the question of<br />
Cambodia come out particularly French ( unclear)<br />
Prime Minister: There was no specific discussion with<br />
Mr Sauvagnargues on this matter. There was obviously an<br />
interest expressed by us in the contributions which France<br />
can make in those territories for which over 100 years she has<br />
had a particular interest. French contributions in that part<br />
of the world could clearly be of great value and therefore of<br />
great interest to us who live near it and who have had unfortunate<br />
involvements in it.<br />
At~ IrD O Question: ( Unclear concerning Australian aid for Africa).<br />
AfovecA Prime Minister: Australia as a relatively developed country of<br />
course has a very great concern for the developing countries.<br />
This was particularly true because of all the developed countries </p>
<p>-6<br />
# P A IR.<br />
V JVT NA Pt<br />
za S. s -T<br />
CLVZ9 Australia lives closest to developing countries. North,<br />
East and West of Australia there are tens, in fact<br />
hundreds of millions of citizens of developing countries.<br />
Australia for two generations has had the responsibility<br />
for one such country which this year will become independent<br />
and which last year became self-governing, Papua New Guinea.<br />
So quite naturally Australia is interested and has been<br />
involved in this question. My government recently established<br />
an Australian Development Assistance Agency to specialise<br />
in these matters. We accept the general United Nations objective<br />
of having 0.7 per cent of the national product devoted<br />
to international assistance and we have already reached<br />
over 0.6 per cent of that figure. we would in general give<br />
more assistance to countries in our neighbourhood, South<br />
East Asia and the neighbouring countries in the Indian Ocean<br />
and in the South Pacific than to the African countries.<br />
This is not because we are unaware of the problems of the<br />
African countries or unsympathetic towards them. They do have<br />
Far acnocnet inanudi ngB riatsasionc iaatnido ni, n tfhaecyt sottihlelr Ecuormompaenadn thceo unitnrtieerse, s t buCW<br />
the sheer history and proximity means that Australia is more<br />
involved with the countries of South East Asia and the Indian<br />
and South Pacific Oceans. My government also stresses that<br />
assistance can be given to developing countries not ontly by<br />
aid but by trade. We probably have devoted our aid more thaW<br />
most countries, or perhaps any countries, to outright grants.<br />
In general we do not require the repayment of advances, we<br />
make or any interest payments on those advances. We have had<br />
a fairly elaborate system of trade assistance to the<br />
developing countries.<br />
Question: Are you aware of reports that the American<br />
Seventh Fleet is off the coast of Viet-Nam in a show of<br />
strength? If so what is your reaction to this buildup?<br />
Prime Minister: I wasn't aware.<br />
Question: I understand that in your speech yesterday<br />
at the dinner party with M. Chirac you said that Australia<br />
did have some hesitation in the past towards a united JZur<br />
but these reservations have now gone. I wonder if you couW<br />
tell us why the attitude of Australia has changed and in what<br />
way a united Europe is beneficial to Australia's interests?<br />
Prime Minister: The big reason for the change of attitude has<br />
been that there has been a change of government in Australia.<br />
I'm sure that in France in particular you now recognise the<br />
Second of December as not only the Anniversary Of Austerlitz<br />
or the coup d'etat but also of political liberation of<br />
Australia, There have been some other incidental reasons<br />
and that is that the pattern of trade has changed in the twelve<br />
and a half years perhaps a bit longer since a British<br />
Government, that cf Mr McMillan, formally applied to join the<br />
European Economic Community.<br />
Question: ( Unclear -concerning whether prospects for<br />
resuming beef sales to Europe improved in Paris)<br />
Prime Minister: Yes, but not for some months. </p>
<p>QuesioSni: rW, h ehno w many months?<br />
Prime Minister: No, I wouldn't specify, I wouldn't<br />
make any particular forecasts, because we've received<br />
different estimates in different member countries of<br />
the community with whom we have discussed this matter.<br />
Question: Due to the present economic situation<br />
* in Australia, do you consider you will have a raise in<br />
tariffs for trade in the near future?<br />
Prime Minister: Well, there may be but if there were<br />
increases in tariffs in Australia I would expect they would<br />
be within the context of the international arrangements<br />
that Australia has made and the legislation that the<br />
Australian Parliament has passed. In other words it would<br />
be, if the increases in tariffs were due to temporary<br />
factors then the increases also would be temporary.<br />
Tariffs in Australia, in general, are lower now than they<br />
have been for probably over forty years, but there has been<br />
a very great increase in imports into Australia and some<br />
of the imports have adversely affected some Australian<br />
industries, so therefore we are persuading the importers<br />
to reduce the amount of imports closer to what they were<br />
before my Government took action which, by tariffs and by<br />
currency revaluations, to promote imports. Perhaps it<br />
would be useful for me to say in this context that Australia<br />
is a very considerable trading country. It's the twelth<br />
largest trading country in the world. There are very few<br />
countries where there is a larger percentage of the<br />
national product involved in international trade than is<br />
the case in Australia. Therefore the prosperity of<br />
Australians depends very greatly on international trade<br />
and it is for this reason that it is very distressing and<br />
disheartening for Australians that some of the most<br />
affluent countries in the world, some of the biggest trading<br />
countries in the world, shoi.-. 1 have suddenly, without any<br />
pretence of justification, or warning, have cut down on<br />
some of the exports which Australia can make in very<br />
economic and attractive terms, such as beef exports. The<br />
Common Market, just cancelled Australia's beef exports.<br />
Japan just cancelled Australia's beef exports. The United<br />
States is now pressing Australia to reduce beef exports.<br />
Now in many of these cases the countries had previously<br />
urged us to increase beef exports. There is no question<br />
that our beef exports are of good and dependable quality,<br />
and very competitive price. It is very disheartening,<br />
discouraging that affluent trading countries such as those<br />
I've mentioned, the only countries in the world, among the<br />
few countries in the world which eat meat, among the still<br />
smaller number of countries in the world which can afford<br />
from time to time to import meat, should take so retrograde<br />
and selfish a step. It is disappointing, it is reprehensible,<br />
I would say, that for domestic political reasons great trading<br />
countries, affluent countries should set such a bad<br />
example. Australia tries, even at the cost of some hardship<br />
to herself and her people, to have good trading relations.<br />
We would expect other countries, bigger ones in<br />
Question:<br />
L </p>
<p>-8<br />
most cases, to be no less principled and progressive<br />
in matters of trade.<br />
Question: Having noted the reaction of the Shah of<br />
Iran to the joint statement emerging from the meeting<br />
between Giscard d'Estaing with President Ford, particularly<br />
on the question of revaluation of gold reserves, do you<br />
sympathise with the Shah of Iran on this question and what<br />
is Australia's attitude?<br />
Prime Minister: I don't want to make any comment at this<br />
stage on this. I'm very interested in what the Shah says<br />
on this and many other matters. As it mightn't bE! generally<br />
understood here, the Shah recently visited Australia last<br />
September, and it was interesting to us that this visit should<br />
have been regarded as appropriate by him before he! made it,<br />
and we have every reason to believe regarded as well worth<br />
while after he'd made it.<br />
Question: Prime Minister, you've now been on the oad<br />
for three weeks and it's been a fairly strenuous, as th<br />
of us who've been travelling with you know. W<br />
Prime Minister: You're bearing up quite well.<br />
Question: How are you feeling, Sir?<br />
Prime Minister: Likewise. </p>
