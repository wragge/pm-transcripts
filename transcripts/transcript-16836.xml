    <content><![CDATA[<p>PM: We have been disturbed today to hear about this appalling tsunami which has hit Samoa. I have today been in contact with the Acting Prime Minister of Samoa and with the Australian High Commissioner there as well, to pass on the condolences of the Australian Government and the Australian people for the loss of life.</p>
<p>There has been some loss of life. The Acting Prime Minister of Samoa is concerned about significant loss of life, given the populated area where this natural disaster has occurred. Also, for Australians, it is my sad duty to confirm that one Australian woman has lost of her life, as advised to me by the Australian High Commissioner, that there are three Australians with injuries so far, and some six Australians remaining, at this stage, unaccounted for.</p>
<p>And we of course will remain in contact with the Australian High Commission on further details. On top of that, the Australian Government has indicated to our friends in Samoa that we stand ready to provide all forms of practical assistance to them in dealing with the aftermath of this natural disaster.</p>
<p>We see our friends in Samoa as part of our Pacific family, and therefore when natural disaster strikes, Australia has always stood ready, shoulder-to-shoulder, to assist them in times of difficulty and need. Finally, as Chairman of the Pacific Islands Forum, and speaking on behalf, therefore, of the entire region, could I also say to our friend in Samoa that we are with you at a time of great natural disaster, and a time of great personal tragedy.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST: What sort of consular assistance is being offered (inaudible)</p>
<p>PM: When I spoke to the Australian High Commissioner today, he indicated that their entire staff has been deployed in support of Australians, including the family, tragically, of the woman who has lost her life, as well as those Australians who are currently receiving medical treatment. And of course our efforts are being directed towards those who are still unaccounted for.</p>
<p>On top of that, the Australian High Commission is working closely with the Government of Samoa on the overall natural disaster clean-up and recovery arrangements.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST: What sort of resources will Australia send to Samoa? Will we be sending (inaudible)</p>
<p>PM: When I spoke to the Acting High Commissioner only a couple of hours ago, he was about to attend a formal meeting of the natural disaster committee of the Samoan Government with the Acting Prime Minister. We're awaiting final confirmation as to what they need.</p>
<p>Australia already has two RAAF Hercules aircraft on stand-by at Richmond, ready to go. We've made arrangements as necessary with commercial aircraft, depending on the nature of the needs. We have all possible resources necessary and ready to assist, we simply need final confirmation of that which is needed.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST: It's a popular holiday destination for Australians, what should people do if concerned about loved ones (inaudible)</p>
<p>PM: I'd say to all Australians who are concerned about loved ones in Samoa following this tsunami, is to immediately contact the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, and to seek necessary information from the consular assistance authorities through the Department. We take every Australian's life abroad seriously, and their wellbeing. Often when natural disasters hit, there'll be some chaos and confusion to start with, but we try and track down each person, and to provide as much physical and practical support as we can, in what are often very difficult and trying circumstances.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST: What's the extent of the damage of the disaster, do you know?</p>
<p>PM: Based on my conversations today with the Acting Prime Minister of Samoa, there has been significant damage in what he described to me as the South and South-East of the island. I am not familiar with this part of the country. He did indicate to me that some thousands of local people live there. They were concerned about significant casualties. But as yet, they don't have any other numbers, other than those which have been confirmed through the public sources.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Is there anything more than you can add about the woman that sadly lost her life in Samoa. Do you know from which state she came from, or whereabouts in Samoa she was at the time?</p>
<p>PM: The Australian High Commissioner has informed me that he is in active conversation with the deceased woman's family. And it's appropriate that once all next of kin are contacted, that an appropriate public statement is made. But we would be reluctant to make any statement of any type prior to that being confirmed though the family.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST: (inaudible)</p>
<p>PM: I think I'd best leave that to the High Commissioner and to the family concerned, so that we do this right and respectfully in relation to the family.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST: There is some reports that there's difficulty knowing how many casualties there are at this point. What's slowing the process down?</p>
<p>PM: Well, I've spoken to the Acting Prime Minister of Samoa this morning. Part of the problem has been that the road network has been badly affected the tsunami, as he advised me. And therefore, physically deploying people to the area is proving to be a problem as well, as I understand it.</p>
<p>But as I've said, we are working, as Australia, very closely, not just with the Samoans, but with our friends in New Zealand, the Government of France, and others who are active in the region to provide all levels of practical support possible. But it may take some time before the full impact of this natural disaster is known.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST: (inaudible)</p>
<p>PM: This is a natural disaster of a considerable order of magnitude which has only occurred today. It's therefore going to take some time to sort through the details. Remember, this is a part of the world which is remote from a lot of the defence and transport logistics that we take for granted in this country. It's going to take a while to pin these details down. So, I don't wish to be indicative of how long things will take, only to mislead.</p>
