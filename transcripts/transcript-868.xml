NEW ENGLAND GIRLS' SCHOOL, ARMIDALE. N. S. W.<br />
Speech by the Prime Ministe_ the Rt. Hon. Sir Robert Menzies<br />
Well, my Lord Bishcp, I want to begin with a personal<br />
explanation as we say, I have been misrepresented, I have<br />
been in Armidale before. I even suspect that I made a speech,<br />
but I know it was a long time ago, Long forgotten and, I hope,<br />
long forgiven. ( Laughter)<br />
The second sort of personal explanation I want to<br />
make is that when the Headmistress was reading her report, I<br />
misheard one word. Let me see I must look it up. I<br />
thought she said " the second" when referring to Miss Young.<br />
" The second is our Treasurer", I thought she said. ( Laughter)<br />
And when everybody applauded, applauded and applauded I knew<br />
there must be a mistake, because no Treasurer ever gets applause.<br />
( Laughter) And then I saw it was " our treasure".<br />
The next thing I want to say of a minor kind is that<br />
I am greatly indebted to whoever it was who drew the thistle,<br />
and had it put ( gesturing) ( Laughter) ( Applause).<br />
Fortunately, it is only a dxawingo( Laughter) I suppose if it<br />
hadn't been a drawing one of you well-behaved girls would have<br />
arranged to have put it on the seat itself. ( Laughter)<br />
I am grateful to the headmistress for having mentioned<br />
me in conjunction with Sir Alec Home, the Prime Minister of<br />
Great Britain because as it happens, he is the second-last<br />
Knight of the Thistle to be created and I am the last and we<br />
walked one behind the other to the Chapel of the Thistle and I<br />
am sure that my Scots friend on the platform will be delighted<br />
to know that when The Queen said to me, " How do you pronounce<br />
your name?" L because she has to says " I demand or " I require<br />
that So-and-so ( mentioning my name" be installed, I said,<br />
" Mingies, Your Majesty, Mingies. It is only in Australia that<br />
I am calied ! Menziess" 0 That's not quite true. ( Laughter)<br />
That's a political approximation. Anyhow, Mingies I was in the<br />
Chapel of the Thistle, and, for better or for Worseq I regard<br />
that as rather an authentic thing.<br />
The third preliminary remark I want to make is that I<br />
was very interested to hear the school sing, " Let us now praise<br />
famous men." which I had not heard before put to music, Then<br />
later on when I heard all these splendid and warm remarks about<br />
the staff, it occurred to me to suggest that your musical<br />
composer whoever she may be ought to cast up a tune for Kipling's<br />
version " Let us now praise famous men<br />
Men of little showing<br />
For their work continueth,<br />
And their work continueth,<br />
Broad and deep continueth,<br />
Greater than their knowingi"<br />
You remember? His " Schoolteachers". His " Let us now praise<br />
famous men" was all about schoolteachers and there it was about<br />
men teachers, of course because they " laid on us with whips,<br />
laid on us with many whips" and, of course, you don't do that<br />
here I imagine. ( Laughter) ./ 2 </p>
<p>-2<br />
Now, the Lord Bishop of Armidale . who, until a few<br />
minutes ago, was na sque radip g rs P. friend of mine, has stolen<br />
half my speech, or rather yesterdnhy I made a speech to a girls'<br />
school and one of my chiel. themes was the impact of beauty and<br />
the function of beauty in education. Well, he must have read<br />
that in the paper ( Laughter), It's perfectly true, Even bishops<br />
are capable of reading a sermon, ( Lauga-ter) Therefore, I w1~ nft<br />
say much about it, but I do crave the privilege of repeating it<br />
because I believe tremendously in the function of beauty in life.<br />
The world has gone through a terrible century so far,<br />
full of hatred, full of scandalous attacks by man on man, Dall<br />
of ugliness and yet, you know, there is so much beauty in the<br />
world and ii' people could learn to breathe it in to take it in<br />
particularly when they are at school and carry il with them<br />
through life, distilling a little of it for other people, letting<br />
it colour their views of other people, making them more tolerant,<br />
more anxious to look for tl-ie good than to seek out the evil I am<br />
sure the world would do much better than it has because ugliness<br />
has disfigured it,<br />
But there is another thing that has gone on in this<br />
century, All of us who are grown up are very familiar with it<br />
and that is that we seem to have got cast adrift from our moorings,<br />
from our intellectual moorings, from our spiritual moorings9<br />
from our sense of values. It has been a very strange century so<br />
far and you will all have some part to play in making it better<br />
before it finishes. It is really, of course, completely true<br />
that in this century, the developments of science and the developments<br />
of tech~ nology, the developments of technical skill have<br />
all gone on apace, This, I suppose, is the golden century of<br />
science, why I can tell you girls looking at me with this<br />
feigned respec'z with which you are now looking at me ( Laughter)-<br />
that I can remember the first motor vehicle that ever came into<br />
my part of Victoria, It was a gruesome thing called a motor<br />
buggy ( Laughter). It had good old-fashioned buggy wheels and<br />
so on and the driver sat up perched aloft. I can remember seeing<br />
the first movie isn't this incredible that a man so young should<br />
remember so far back ( Laughter), It seems only yesterday that<br />
I was sitting in some open-air place because nobody could afford<br />
to build picture theatres for a start. Now they can't afford<br />
to keep thom open. I saw a film called " The Great American<br />
Train Robbery". Everybody jerked like that. Fortunately there<br />
were no voices and therefore even at that time of my life I found<br />
it relatively easy to have a nap while the picture was on.<br />
( Laughter) Aircraft this is all in our time, Wireless<br />
television, all these things that we now take for grantea, of<br />
course, have come in this century or for all practical purposes,<br />
in this century. So that the other day, I could pick up a<br />
telephone in Sydney and have a talk to Alec Home in London over<br />
a telephone circuit through a submarine cable, just as if he<br />
were in the next room.<br />
Now, all these things have happened and they are all<br />
marvellous aren't they? One thing wrong with them is that they<br />
dontt have much to do with people's character or tolerance or<br />
understanding of human beings* In short, they dontt have much<br />
to do with civilisation, They can be used as an aid to<br />
civilisation, They can, of course, be used as the enemies of<br />
civilisation. Aircraft yes, for a great and good purpose like<br />
bringing me here ( Laughter); or for the purposes of destruction<br />
of people. This is the great feature about this period of our<br />
aea*. e/ 2 </p>
<p>M3<br />
history. All this tremendous devx
science, in understand-, ig o2 l' thin-gs as things, biut '-iow much<br />
understanding of them as th.. iUs to be used and used for some<br />
purpose? Now this has a great bearing on the school. This<br />
has a great bearing on the attitude that-parents have towards<br />
their children at school. There is a bit of a disposition, I<br />
think I am right in saying, to want some early kind of specialisation,<br />
to say, " Well, Rutia or whatever her name mighit be she<br />
wants to do a particular thing in, life that is going to be a very<br />
profitable thing to do. Let her concentrate on that," I hiope<br />
not too soon. I am one of those people who believe that unless<br />
the basis of education is right, unless up to a certain stage<br />
people are really studying what I will call the human things in<br />
education they can become narrow specialists, They can become<br />
detached lIrom the values of civilisation, they can become indeed<br />
a positive menace, becauso an irresponSible scientific expert<br />
may be a great scientific expert but whether his contribution<br />
to life is a good one or a bad one will, if he be a narrowminded<br />
man, be something that will. have to be determined by<br />
other people less narrow minded and more wise, and that means<br />
that the whole process of education is a process of developing<br />
individual people, developing them in a balanced way,<br />
lowr on earth could we possibly have any sense of<br />
judgment about contemporary events if we knew nothing about what<br />
had happened in the past. I just don't understand how anybody<br />
can profess to be educated, though he or she may have all the<br />
degress in the world unless they know something of the history<br />
of the past, unless they have some basis of judgment some<br />
understanding that men and women are remembered for their impact<br />
on life and that you will find this impact specifically or.<br />
generally described in history. y_--t can _ g in history the errors<br />
that have been made and the results that have come from them,<br />
And now the study of English. I had something to<br />
say about this in another place yesterday but I must say that<br />
I am constantly astonished at the number of people who, when<br />
they open their mouths to have a conversation or make a speech<br />
or whatever it may be, think that anything will do. I have met<br />
a number of boys out of good schools I say nothing about<br />
girls; I'm not game to but I have met lots and lots of young<br />
men out of good schools whose vocabulary was hopelessly<br />
inadequate and who spoke a species of Hottentot ( Laughter) as<br />
far as I was concerned, on the great principle that "' Anyhow,<br />
you know what I mean" and anything will do or even Zhe famous<br />
Australian slogan " It's good enough".<br />
Now it's not good enough. There is nothing good<br />
enough for the language that we speak. Nobody could ever be<br />
perfect at it, but we can all try, we can all be conscious of<br />
the fact that it's a wonderful language and a flexible language<br />
and that it is not all long words but that the best words in it<br />
are short words, clear-cut words, I don't know whether this<br />
is a classical school, I know that Greek has disappeared from<br />
the face of the earth, I think much to the misfortune of the<br />
earth, but Latin staggers on. It used to be compulsory for a<br />
number of courses at the university; now I think it isn't,<br />
I don't know. But if people could even learn a little Latin and<br />
remember it, they would understand their own language a lot<br />
better and would misuse it less villainously.<br />
Now, all this is quite consistent with doing physics<br />
and chemistry, all these scientific matters. They are of </p>
<p>p tremendous importance. The sec'ond hal:' of this century wiLl<br />
need more and more of e., lt. o cientific work than did<br />
the first half and I i -rew . re get 1 0c greater civil,<br />
ordinary, peaceful benefit fvero : Lt Dut a scientist who doesn't<br />
know these other things, who . asnlt really taken time to get into<br />
a line of communication with otrier human beings, learning from<br />
them, sub-consciously, getting to. unde: cstand them, that scientist<br />
will always be less than a great man, whereas the humanist, as<br />
we say, who has studied all these other things, who has thriven<br />
on history and philosophy and all these great exercises o: f the<br />
mind, will be something less than academic if he fails to know<br />
something about the problem of the scientist and fails to learn<br />
something about the nature of the world about which he is<br />
speculating. Now, that is all I want to say to you. It sounds<br />
singularly like a bit of a sermon, but you know, I must say<br />
that when I was going to speech days or speech nights and<br />
sometimes getting a prize ( Laughter), we used to sit Aown there<br />
and they always had some old politician on the platform<br />
( Laughter); he was always a very distinguished old boy and he<br />
always bored us stiff ( Laughter) and I took a vow later on<br />
that I would never put myself . nto that position. I must say<br />
it for myself I do it as seldom as I can. But I am a bit<br />
lucky today because all I can tell you is whether it is the<br />
superior nature of girls over the nature of boys I don't know....<br />
if you had been I111 try it out this afternoon<br />
( Laughter) but if you had been boys half of you would have<br />
been yawning in my face by now. All I can say is that you are<br />
the best I don't know about those others further back who<br />
pay the fees ( Laughter). They are, in a sense, beyond redemption<br />
( Laughter). What I have had to say to you is really wasted<br />
on them. I am getting in early with you, on your minds, and I am<br />
delighted to have had the opportunity of standing here and<br />
looking at you, and if I may repeat before I sit down, ono<br />
improper remark I made when I walkea into the chapel this<br />
morning, my Lord Bishop not realising for a moment that I<br />
was in he chapel and so I spoke to a couple of the girls in<br />
the front row as I went by. Do you know what I said to them<br />
and looking around I repeat it with emphasis I have never seen<br />
such admirable hair-dos in a girls' school before. ( Laughter) </p>
