,, AUSI'RALA&amp;<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA WEDNESDAY, 24 SEPTEMBER, 1980<br />
JULIUS DAM<br />
The Prime Minister, Mr Malcolm Fraser, said today<br />
that, on return to office, his-Government would provide<br />
$ 250,000 to the City of Mount Isa to assist further in the<br />
debt servicing problems associated with the Julius Dam.<br />
The Commonwealth has previously provided a loan of<br />
$ 2 million to assist in the construction of the dam and<br />
provided a grant of $ 325,000 to assist the Council in its<br />
borrowing program. It also allocated $ 500,000 in 1978-79<br />
and $ 250,000 in 1979-80 to the Mount isa City Council to<br />
reduce the debt burden of its loan commitments. Mr Fraser<br />
went on to say that the additional assistance that is now<br />
to be made available was further evidence of his Government's<br />
concern for the particular problems faced by people at Mount<br />
Isa who already incur very high water charges. It also<br />
demonstrates the clear commitment by the Commaonwealth to the<br />
development of the north.<br />
The Prime Minister said that Australia was universally<br />
recognised as a dry continent and water was an essential<br />
prerequisite to the development of the nation. This development<br />
could not occur unless -the Commonwealth adopted a sympathetic<br />
and realistic attitude towards the difficulties faced by peopl~ e<br />
in remote communities. The Government, by its actions, clearly<br />
demonstrates its concern to minimise the difficulties faced by<br />
such communities. Mr Fraser concluded by noting the additional assistance<br />
to Mount Isa would be provided to Queensland, under the National<br />
Water Resources Program, to be forwarded to the City of Mount Isa. </p>
