    <content><![CDATA[<p>I am pleased to announce continued funding of two initiatives under the Government's Mentor Marketplace programme.  This programme involves spending of $12 million over the next four years.</p>
<p>  The two initiatives are the Inspire Peer Mentor Programme and the Helping Young People Achieve Programme.</p>
<p>The Inspire Peer Mentor Programme is located at Flinders University and aims to increase retention and participation in education for at risk students in the southern suburbs of Adelaide.  This initiative has secured funding of $304,000 to June 2009.</p>
<p>The Service to Youth Council Incorporated has also secured funding for their programme Helping Young People Achieve which offers mentoring opportunities to young people accessing the educational, employment, accommodation and personal support services managed by the Council.  This initiative will receive funding of $468,385 to June 2009.</p>
<p> Mentoring services bring a range of benefits to disengaged and at risk young people, including greater academic performance and attendance rates, improved behaviour and relationships, and a decrease in the number of students who dropout of school.  At the same time, mentors can gain interpersonal skills, improved self-confidence and an opportunity to make a difference in other young people's lives.</p>
<p>I am pleased that the Government has been able to renew its support for these successful programmes.  This $12 million in funding for the Mentor Marketplace programme is part of the Government's continued commitment to young people as demonstrated through its support for the Young Australian of the Year Awards, the National Youth Roundtable and National Indigenous Youth Leadership Group, National Youth Week as well as youth programmes such as the Reconnect programme and the Transition to Independent Living Allowance.</p>
<p> These projects are just two of the twelve that have been selected for funding by my colleague, the Hon. Sussan Ley MP, Parliamentary Secretary (Children and Youth Affairs).  A second round of funding under the Mentor Marketplace programme will take place later in 2005 for up to 15 new projects.  </p>
