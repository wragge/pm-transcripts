COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA<br />
SPEECH BY<br />
The Rt. Hon. HAROLD HOLT, M. P.,<br />
ON<br />
PRIME MINISTER'S VISIT TO SOUTH EAST ASIA<br />
Ministerial Statement<br />
[ From the " Parliamentary Debates," 5th May 1966]<br />
Mr. HAROLD HOLT ( Higgins--Prime<br />
Minister).-by leave-Southern Asia today<br />
demands and receives world wide attention<br />
and concern. In this ancient complex,<br />
densely-populated region the habits and<br />
practices of centuries are bending,<br />
breaking or yielding under the impact<br />
of twentieth century technology and<br />
new concepts are challenging the old.<br />
The -revolution takes many forms,<br />
most of them unsettling, some of<br />
them violent and dangerous. Conflicting<br />
ideologies compete there for the hearts and<br />
minds of hundreds of millions of human<br />
beings and these millions may have doubled<br />
by the end of this century. The Communist<br />
power seekers in Asia are trying to make<br />
this revolution the vehicle of disruption and<br />
instability enabling them to overturn established<br />
authority and shackle whole communities<br />
to their philosophy. They exploit<br />
grievances, aggravate divisive factors, undermine<br />
stability in order to bring about political<br />
and administrative chaos. Behind the<br />
Communists in South East Asia, wherever<br />
their structures are to be found, is the<br />
driving force of China.<br />
China, with a population upwards of 700<br />
million, is governed by a Communist regime<br />
implacably committed -to its goal of a<br />
5665/ 66 Communist-dominated world. The Chinese<br />
Communists scornfully reject the concept of<br />
peaceful co-existence which has brought<br />
some respite in the cold war and an easing<br />
of . tensions in Europe. Subversion and guerrilla<br />
warfare, as spelled out in the writings<br />
of Mao Tse-tung, have been directed with<br />
planned thoroughness to the villages and<br />
paddy fields of South East Asia. These tactics<br />
have been eagerly adopted and ruthlessly<br />
waged in South Vietnam by General<br />
Giap, the leading military theoretician of<br />
North Vietnam, and by the Vietcong, the<br />
self-styled Liberation Front, who have<br />
learned their lessons well from him.<br />
South East Asia has become a critical<br />
battleground for free peoples everywhere.<br />
South Vietnam has become a testing point<br />
of the determination to prevent Communist<br />
aggression and check its cancerous spread.<br />
Australia is standing . today with the<br />
people of South Vietnam, our close ally the<br />
United States of America, and the forces<br />
of other friendly countries in resisting the<br />
Communist threat. We see more than the<br />
need merely to preserve the independence<br />
and integrity of South Vietnam, ' important<br />
though that task may be of itself. To us,<br />
the threat is, as I have said, to free peoples<br />
everywhere. If South East Asia is to fall </p>
<p>under Communist control we face a future<br />
in which the security of Australia is in<br />
jeopardy. While at this time South Vietnam is the<br />
most heavily embattled, other countries of<br />
the area are alert to the threat also. It is<br />
noteworthy that Korea, which so recently<br />
was itself a battleground of Communist<br />
aggression, has supplied more military<br />
forces, in proportion to its population, to<br />
aid South Vietnam than any other country.<br />
Three successive Presidents of the United<br />
States have clearly recognised the threat,<br />
leading to the provision by that country of<br />
a massive and decisive contribution of<br />
forces and material. Australia, in company<br />
with the free countries of South East Asia,<br />
has cause for gratitude for this contribution<br />
made to security in South East Asia by<br />
American firmness and military strength.<br />
We have admired the resolution and<br />
strength of purpose that President Johnson<br />
has brought to this issue.<br />
The Communists have deliberately<br />
chosen to carry out aggression by covert<br />
means on the basis of long and careful<br />
underground preparation extending over<br />
more than a decade, in the training for<br />
guerrilla warfare, the establishment of<br />
secret bases and stockpiles for a protracted<br />
campaign, the securing of routes of infiltration,<br />
the introduction of specially trained<br />
cadres, the application of methods of<br />
indoctrination and terrorism against<br />
defenceless village people. These are all<br />
elements in the infra-structure. This is the<br />
pattern of Communist aggression in the<br />
conditions of South East Asia. By these<br />
means, the aggressor seeks to escape the<br />
full censure of the free world which would<br />
flow from an open declaration of war in<br />
the sense that we have known it in the<br />
past. The enemy does not openly deploy<br />
his forces in the manner of conventional<br />
warfare where their aggressive actions are<br />
readily identifiable internationally. Even<br />
today, when North Vietnam has at least<br />
nine regular regiments of the P.. A. V. N.<br />
operating in South Vietnam, they will make<br />
no admission of this. Nor, of course, do<br />
they admit the earlier build up of Vietcong<br />
guerrilla forces and infiltration to<br />
which I have just referred. This is a war<br />
largely of attrition, in which there are no<br />
front l: ines and hostile activity is planned to<br />
occur, and does occur, in many -widely<br />
separated places simultaneously. I have said that Australia stands militarily<br />
with South Vietnam, the United States and<br />
other allies, but it is also an important part<br />
of our thinking that we are able to play a<br />
useful part in the building of a better world<br />
order in South East Asia. Wherever we have<br />
been involved in a military role in this area<br />
over the post-war years, our servicemen,<br />
acting along the lines their Government has<br />
approved, have made a positive contribution<br />
to the wellbeing of the people of the<br />
country in which they found themselves. I<br />
was glad to find that programmes of military<br />
civic action-as they are called-and rural<br />
rehabilitation and development are now<br />
accepted as an important part of the tasks<br />
of the military forces of all the allied<br />
participants. There is, in addition, an extensive<br />
programme of civilian cadre training<br />
for service in the villages, which I shall<br />
refer to again later. Through the Colombo<br />
Plan, and in other ways, Australia has made<br />
a useful contribution by civilians also.<br />
It is against all this background that my<br />
recent visit to several of the countries of<br />
South East Asia should be viewed. In each<br />
of these countries Australia has serving men<br />
and women joining with others in holding<br />
in check the Communist threat. The<br />
existence of that threat is common to all of<br />
these countries. It has varied in degree and<br />
as to point of time. We played a part for<br />
many years, with Britain and New Zealand,<br />
in stamping out Communist terrorist activity<br />
in what was then Malaya. We sent military<br />
forces to resist Communist aggression in<br />
Korea. We have helped in Singapore and<br />
Borneo. We have given assistance in various<br />
forms to Thailand, and now we are to<br />
increase earlier military aid in South<br />
Vietnam by providing a task force.<br />
On taking office, I decided to seize the<br />
first opportunity I could take to pay a visit<br />
to our Australian troops at their various<br />
stations. I felt it desirable to have direct<br />
personal knowledge of the conditions of<br />
their service, and have them feel from my<br />
presence with them that they occupy a high<br />
place in the regard of their Government.<br />
I wanted also to have in my mind that<br />
awareness which only personal contact can<br />
provide of the nature of our various establishments,<br />
their environment and setting. I<br />
wanted to make the dots on the map come<br />
. live as known places with known people. </p>
<p>A strong team of advisers, who were also<br />
to gain much benefit and information as<br />
observers, came with me. These advisers<br />
included the Chief of the General Staff, Sir<br />
John Wilton; the Deputy Secretary of the<br />
Prime Minister's Department, Mr. Lawler; a<br />
specialist on South East Asian affairs in the<br />
Department of External Affairs, Mr. Gordon<br />
Jockel; and Mr. Clugston, of the Department<br />
of Defence. All those gentlemen, together<br />
with the other gentlemen who were<br />
with us, were of great assistance. I acknowledge<br />
with appreciation the help that they<br />
gave me. Facilities were provided, at the<br />
expense of their employers, for members of<br />
the Press who desired to accompany the<br />
party, and about 20 newsmen, photographers<br />
and television cameramen, most<br />
of them of senior status in their organisations,<br />
accompanied us. I express my appreciation<br />
to them for what appeared to me<br />
to be a consistently high standard of<br />
reporting. In the course of the tour I visited Vietnam,<br />
Thailand, Malaysia, including both<br />
West Malaysia and Sarawak, and Singapore.<br />
I shall say something about each of these<br />
countries. There were advantages in being able to<br />
travel at short intervals between the four<br />
countries visited and inspect, over the space<br />
of 10 days, activities in more than 20<br />
localities. A head of government, in addition<br />
to receiving the courtesies and hospitality<br />
considered appropriate to his office,<br />
is given means of speedy transport and<br />
communication. He is supplied with the<br />
most frankly expressed and authoritative<br />
information. It is possible in this way to<br />
gain in a short time a quick insight into<br />
the manner in which each country is<br />
tackling its national issues, and, at the same<br />
time, have a more vivid awareness of the<br />
proximity and significance that one country<br />
in the region bears to the other. A valuable<br />
gain from my journey has been the development<br />
of a more intimate relationship with<br />
leaders and senior Ministers in all the countries<br />
visited. This facilitates future contact<br />
and discussion on matters of mutual<br />
interest. Vietnam, of course, in current circumstances,<br />
was the country of most immediate<br />
interest to us. It was of great value to confer<br />
with the Chief of State, General Thieu,<br />
the Prime Minister, Air Vice-Marshal Ky, the Foreign Minister, Dr. Do, and other<br />
members of the Government of the Republic<br />
of Vietnam. Theirs is commonly thought<br />
of as a military Government, and in a<br />
situation of such intensive military activity,<br />
under constant threat of Communist attack,<br />
one would expect the Government to<br />
possess, as it does, a strongly military<br />
flavour and influence. There is, however, a<br />
greater civilian composition in the senior<br />
levels of government than is generally<br />
know. The Directory comprises the military<br />
leaders and corps commanders, but associated<br />
with this is a Ministry of twenty<br />
members of whom five are doctors, five are<br />
lawyers, four are military officers, using<br />
1military to embrace the three servicesthe<br />
Prime Minister, of course being a senior<br />
air force officer-three are engineers, two<br />
are economists and one is a trade union<br />
official. Some of them have been actively<br />
in the fight for national freedom throughout<br />
their adult life. Our talks with them<br />
were -frank and comprehensive. They are<br />
determined to see the struggle through until<br />
freedom and independence have been<br />
secured. The day to day reporting of events as<br />
they occur in various parts of Vietnam can<br />
obscure the extent to which economic and<br />
community life there have adapted themselves<br />
to military operations persisting over<br />
many years. Take the situation in Saigon.<br />
It is true that terrorist incidents happen<br />
there with disturbing frequency. Several<br />
incidents occurred during ' the period of my<br />
visit. Sometimes there is loss of life, injury<br />
and damage from Vietcong sneak raids.<br />
But it must be realised that Saigon is a<br />
large city of about two million people. Life<br />
goes on with most people unaware at the<br />
time that another hostile incident has<br />
occurred. The shops are busy; there is plenty<br />
of traffic about; people go about their<br />
occasions seemingly undeterred.<br />
The scale of United States assistance<br />
pouring into Vietnam is enormous. It<br />
has to ' be seen to be believed.<br />
Saigon, I was told, ' has become the<br />
busiest -airport in the world. The<br />
helicopters in service are to be numnbered<br />
in thousands. They have proved of<br />
immense value for rapid mobility of troops<br />
into action, and the speed with which they<br />
rescue and transport disabled soldiers for<br />
medical treatment has cut in half the fatality<br />
rate from injuries as compared with that of </p>
<p>Korea and the Second World War. The<br />
choppers, as they are familiarly called, are<br />
just about the most popular pieces of equipment<br />
in the country..<br />
. My talks in Saigon and at Bien Hoa<br />
included detailed briefings from military and<br />
diplomatic representatives of the Government<br />
of Vietnam, of the United States including<br />
the Ambassador, Mr. Cabot Lodge,<br />
and General Westmoreland and, of course,<br />
our own Australian advisers. As a result<br />
of the information gained from them, supplemented<br />
by what one could see of the<br />
immensity of the scale of provision of military<br />
equipment and logistic requirements, I<br />
am confident that the Vietcong cannot win.<br />
The military position in South Vietnam has<br />
now been secured. The Vietcong have<br />
suffered heavy losses and their casualties<br />
have been increasing.<br />
Sneak raids by small parties, such as that<br />
made recently on Saigon Airport, can still<br />
be carried out from time to time by the<br />
Vietcong. These raids are part of the military<br />
and political tactics of guerrilla warfare.<br />
They make dramatic news, but they<br />
do not weaken the hold of the South Vietnamese<br />
Government on the areas under its<br />
control. On the other hand, mobile forces<br />
are now available to conduct operations<br />
against enemy forces when they are located,<br />
and to penetrate into territory previously<br />
considered Vietcong strongholds.<br />
There has been a noticeable weakening<br />
in the morale of many of the Vietcong.<br />
The sustained bombing attacks on supplies<br />
and Veitcong held positions and the speed<br />
and mobility of helicopter borne troops<br />
are, having punishing effect. The Vietcong<br />
are suffering from lack of medical supplies<br />
and treatment. The number of defectors<br />
has increased substantially and significantly<br />
in recent months, both as a result of military<br />
and psychological operations. The Vietcong<br />
are now drawing on much less experienced<br />
troops, and the regular North Vietnamese<br />
regiments have proved themselves less<br />
adapted to the guerrilla type of warfare in<br />
what is for them unfamiliar terrain. They<br />
prefer to fight in formed units. This makes<br />
them more liable to detection and air attack.<br />
The heavier equipment to which they are<br />
accustomed creates a transportation<br />
problem for them. More intelligence information<br />
is flowing in, while detection methods<br />
have improved. Allied forces have been<br />
able to strike in critical areas before the<br />
enemy was able to move. In a country of such difficult terrain, and with the tactics<br />
and strategy employed by the enemy it may<br />
be a long time before the Communist<br />
threat can be subdued. But, increasingly,<br />
areas will be cleared of Vietcong and a<br />
more peaceful pattern of life restored. It<br />
must be remembered that while the Vietcong<br />
control large tracts of country, they<br />
hold none of the major centres-they do<br />
not command any one of the 43 provincial<br />
capitals. The protection, rehabilitation, and<br />
development of additional areas brought<br />
under control is a formidable task and will<br />
take a long time. It involves the<br />
re-establishment of civil administration,<br />
police, civil protection units, and a variety<br />
of civil projects to provide medical aid,<br />
education, communications and other public<br />
utilities. Here again the United States<br />
is providing massive support. Military civic<br />
action by combat troops will, however, be<br />
the initial step towards this ultimate<br />
objective. The Government of Vietnam maintains<br />
establishments for the intensive training of<br />
cadres, each 59 in number, to be located<br />
in the villages, specially trained to help in,<br />
defence against Vietcong attack and to<br />
assist the villagers to build a better life for<br />
themselves. Those to be trained are<br />
nominated by the village chiefs and become<br />
equipped to carry out tasks of medical service,<br />
education, construction of homes and<br />
school buildings; they learn improved agricultural<br />
methods and other activities of<br />
befiefit to the village dweller. Since March<br />
1964 some 20,000 trainees have already<br />
been equipped for service along these lines.<br />
The Australian troops in Vietnam and<br />
elsewhere, as I discovered, also regard what<br />
they aptly refer to as hearts and minds<br />
as a necessary part of their activities. They<br />
have become well and affectionately known<br />
in the villages and the areas they serve.<br />
They have helped in this way to improve<br />
morale and build friendship for Australia.<br />
SThe warmth of welcome and cordial hospitality<br />
shown to us by members of the<br />
Government were evidence of the appreciation<br />
which they obviously very sincerely<br />
feel for Australia's military participation<br />
and material help. A bright prospect<br />
in the Vietnam situation is the application<br />
by all the allied participants to constructive<br />
programmes for improvements of<br />
standards in the towns and villages. </p>
<p>All those I met in Vietnam were concerned<br />
about the political situation and discussed<br />
it frankly. In the middle of the<br />
pressures and strains of the war, the<br />
country is seeking to establish a new<br />
system of government. This is a difficult<br />
enough process at any time as Australians<br />
know from their own history. Constitutionmaking<br />
in any circumstances brings to the<br />
forefront the competition among the<br />
various political and regional interests. In<br />
Vietnam, the process is made more complex<br />
by two particular circumstances. In the<br />
first place, the country has not been kindly<br />
dealt with by history for easy political<br />
evolution:. Over the centuries, religious,<br />
regional and cultural influences have produced<br />
a variety of groups and sects and<br />
local loyalties. The years of French<br />
colonialism and Japanese occupation were<br />
followed by a systematic Communist programme<br />
to destroy the growth of institutions<br />
and the structure of government. In<br />
the second place, the wartime situation<br />
requires a strong executive government.<br />
Rapid and effective action is needed for<br />
the conduct of the fighting, for pacification<br />
and for vigorous programmes of civic<br />
action. Finding the right constitutional<br />
expression of the relationship between the<br />
military and civilian elements is a complex<br />
matter not easily to be resolved. But an<br />
awareness of the difficulties should enable<br />
us to maintain a steady view, seeing events<br />
as they occur in a realistic perspective. As<br />
they are checked in the military sphere in<br />
Vietnam-and they are being checkedthe<br />
Communists are likely to intensify<br />
their efforts in the political sphere, not<br />
only in seeking to promote distractions in<br />
Vietnam but in wider political offensives<br />
through their agents of influence in the<br />
other free countries of the region.<br />
The people of Vietnam have great<br />
toughness, vitality and pride. They are<br />
neither apathetic nor dispirited. There is a<br />
general will to resist Communist aggression,<br />
and to prevent Communist domination. The<br />
recent political disturbances appear to have<br />
had only minor adverse effect on the<br />
military situation. The judgment is that the<br />
Vietnamese armed forces with the United<br />
States and other allies can resist the aggression<br />
and ensure security while South Vietnam<br />
develops the basis of an enduring<br />
stability. I have spoken at some length about the<br />
situation in Vietnam because of its importance.<br />
But I wish to. refer also to the general<br />
discussions which I had in the other countries<br />
I visited, which touched upon regional<br />
matters of common concern. Thailand is a<br />
country of considerable experience and<br />
influence in the South East Asian region. It<br />
well exemplifies the rapid ecoiomic and<br />
social progress which can be made with<br />
well directed aid from friendly countries.<br />
It is able to play now, and I believe increasingly<br />
in the future, a significant part in<br />
promoting the security and stability of the<br />
region. The fact that I was able to return,<br />
so soon after the event, the visit made to<br />
Australia by the Prime Minister, Thanom<br />
Kittikachorn, enabled us to establish an<br />
even warmer and closer relationship which<br />
will, I believe, be of enduring benefit to<br />
our two countries. I was taken by helicopter<br />
on an hour's journey from Bangkok over<br />
an interesting stretch of the Thai countryside<br />
to an audience with King Bhumiphon<br />
at his summer palace at Hua Hin. The King<br />
recalled with appreciation the visit of himself<br />
and the Queen to Australia. He asked<br />
me to convey his greetings to the Australian<br />
people. In Kuala Lumpur, I was able to review<br />
with the Deputy Prime Minister, Tun<br />
Razak, and some of his colleagues, the<br />
latest thinking of the Malaysian Government<br />
on the confrontation issue, the<br />
expansion of the Malaysian defence effort<br />
and problems arising for both those countries<br />
from the withdrawal by Singapore<br />
from : Malaysia.<br />
In Singapore, in addition to having useful<br />
talks with the Deputy Prime Minister,<br />
Dr. Toh, and other senior Ministers, I paid<br />
a visit to the Singapore naval base and had<br />
a briefing there from senior officers and<br />
visited those Australian Navy units then at<br />
the base. Arrangements were made for me<br />
to view the whole area by helicopter, and<br />
this was certainly a very practical descriptive<br />
way of studying this vast establishment.<br />
Australia has long held the view that the<br />
continued . maintenance of the-base by<br />
British forces is an important contribution<br />
to the security and stability of the whole<br />
region of southern Asia. My discussions<br />
with representatives of the Malaysian and<br />
Singapore Governments confirmed that they<br />
too share this view. The base has the<br />
additional value of representing a considerable<br />
f2ctor in the economy of Singapore. </p>
<p>It directly employs more than 30,000 people<br />
and, through its requirements, gives indirect<br />
employment to many tens of thousands of<br />
Singapore citizens. Although I have not<br />
previously referred to it specifically in this<br />
statement, we fully and gratefully<br />
acknowledge the major support which the<br />
United Kingdom provides by means of<br />
its forces which are spread through<br />
the Singapore-Malaysian area-including<br />
Borneo-and which collaborate with other<br />
Commonwealth forces.<br />
Each of the Governments we met took<br />
me frankly into their thinking on their basic<br />
problems and national issues. They gave me<br />
accounts, in particular, of their plans for<br />
economic development and social progress,<br />
and of . the thinking underlying these plans.<br />
I came away with the impression of realistic,<br />
modern-minded govenments and developing<br />
administrative structures.<br />
Purposeful efforts are being made to put<br />
national resources into rural development.<br />
All are agreed that the benefits of modern<br />
life must be progressively spread into the<br />
villages and remote rural areas. The central<br />
Governments are aware that the resources<br />
and facilities at their disposal must be used<br />
to break down the traditional feeling of the<br />
small landholders that governments bring<br />
them no benefit.<br />
I have spoken of the prominence given<br />
to civic action programmes in. Vietnam. In<br />
Thailand, mobile teams are being sent into<br />
the remote provinces to survey the problems<br />
and provide civic action there; national<br />
development programmes give a major<br />
place to agriculture and inland transportation.<br />
In Malaysia, the experiences of the<br />
emergency have been studied and incorporated<br />
into national planning. The new<br />
villages established during the resettlement<br />
programme of the emergency have become<br />
permanent communities. We were briefed<br />
on these matters in the National Operations<br />
Room, which is personally supervised<br />
by the Deputy Prime Minister. This centre<br />
aims at co-ordination and drive in carrying<br />
out the rural development programme. In<br />
Sarawak, the twin problems of providing<br />
security and development in rural areas are<br />
major priority tasks.<br />
The Government of Singapore is energetically<br />
grappling with the problems of<br />
industrialisation and international trade in<br />
order to provide employment for its growing<br />
work force. Australia is playing a part in assisting<br />
with these schemes of welfare and development.<br />
1 was impressed by the work which<br />
the surgical team from the Alfred Hospital,<br />
Melbourne, is doing in the district hospital<br />
at Bien Hoa village. I also met members<br />
of the surgical team from St. Vincent's<br />
Hospital, Melbourne, which is doing similar<br />
valuable work at Long Xuyen. In discussions<br />
with Government leaders, I was<br />
told of the value they attach to the contributions<br />
which our experts are making in<br />
various civil fields such as road and bridge<br />
building projects in provincial areas, and in<br />
attachments to institutions. During my visit<br />
to Kuching, the Sarawak association of<br />
former Colombo Plan students met me to<br />
express their appreciation of Australia's<br />
help. They represented a numerous group<br />
of young men trained in various professions<br />
in Australian universities and other educational<br />
institutions.<br />
The major intention prompting this tour,<br />
however, was to visit our forces serving in<br />
various parts of South East Asia. I have<br />
now seen at first hand the splendid job they<br />
are doing. I have had opportunities to meet<br />
informally with officers and men in their<br />
service positions and at their billets. In discussions<br />
with Government and military<br />
leaders in the various theatres, I have heard<br />
unstinted praise for the quality of our forces<br />
both as fighting men and as representatives<br />
of Australia in their contacts with local<br />
populations and in projects of civic action.<br />
This has been a heart warming experience.<br />
Australia can be very proud of the men<br />
and women of our armed forces throughout<br />
South East Asia. The great tradition of<br />
Australia's fighting men is safe in their hands<br />
-with the Navy on patrol duties in Malaysian<br />
waters, with the Army in its border<br />
posts in Borneo, playing its part in the<br />
crucial fight against aggression in South<br />
Vietnam, or building airfields in Thailand<br />
and roads under the most difficult conditions<br />
of terrain and climate in Sabah and<br />
with the Air Force on the alert for air<br />
defence at Butterworth and Ubon, or providing<br />
vital air transport in South Vietnam.<br />
The Army cloth cap, battered and faded<br />
in service, is to be found worn in every<br />
conceivable variety of shaping, but with a<br />
jaunty and cheerful pride. These forces may<br />
not be large in numbers relative to the total<br />
forces engaged in these areas, but they<br />
are of the highest quality and they make a<br />
significant contribution to the allied effort. </p>
<p>They have an effect and influence out of<br />
proportion to their actual numbers. I would<br />
like to include in this tribute the armed<br />
forces of New Zealand serving in the area.<br />
I visited the New Zealand battery alongside<br />
our battalion in its encampment at Bien<br />
Hoa, and this unit joined together with us<br />
on the morning of Anzac Day in the most<br />
moving commemoration of that anniversary<br />
that I have ever attended.<br />
Our troops have shown themselves able<br />
to win the confidence and friendship of<br />
village peoples in the areas of operations;<br />
good relations have been developed with<br />
the local authorities and residents in base<br />
areas; and the Governments have made<br />
clear to us the value they place on the,<br />
presence of our forces. Their initial<br />
stationing in these countries involved a<br />
degree of co-operation and mutuality of<br />
interest between us and the Governments<br />
concerned. Once established, the continuing<br />
presence of our forces has contributed<br />
appreciably to the further strengthening of<br />
the relationship. They -have earned a high<br />
reputation for their conduct, their military<br />
capacity and their military civic action<br />
work. It was clear from what I was told<br />
in private discussion, and from what each<br />
Government said publicly, that there was<br />
much satisfaction in the presence of Australian<br />
troops as a direct commitment by<br />
Australia to South East Asian security.<br />
I have spoken at some length about a<br />
: number of aspects of my journey and its<br />
background. I have mentioned the Communist<br />
inspired instability and disruption<br />
in southern Asia, that South East Asia has<br />
become a critical battleground for free<br />
peoples everywhere, and that the prime<br />
manifestation of the struggle now finds<br />
itself in Vietnam. I have said something<br />
about the reasons for Australia's participation<br />
with America and other allies in support<br />
of South Vietnamese forces in their<br />
defence of their national integrity. Because<br />
of their very considerable importance, I<br />
have referred also to various matters bearing<br />
on the social and ccormic development<br />
of Vietnam and other countries in<br />
the region. I have referred also to discussions<br />
with Government leaders in each<br />
of the countries, and I have spoken in the<br />
highest terms, as is their due, of our own<br />
forces in the area, of their quality, of their standing, of the work of military and civil<br />
significance which they do, and, I now add,<br />
of their understanding of the role which<br />
they perform, and the powerful reasons<br />
for it.<br />
I now conclude by saying again that the<br />
visit was for me, and I would hope for the<br />
Australian nation, a most valuable exercise.<br />
It has produced a sharpening of our consciousness<br />
of military and political situations<br />
which are constantly under our examination.<br />
I retain a vivid visual picture of many<br />
locations and establishments of continuing<br />
importance to us. The review has provided<br />
a new and rewarding occasion for an up<br />
to the minute exchange of views with other<br />
Governments. Naturally I cannot reveal the<br />
substance of the intimate discussions which<br />
took place with these Governments, but the<br />
results will be beneficial to our own future<br />
internal counsels. The journey brought<br />
closer personal relationships. I am glad to<br />
report that my visit was very much welcomed<br />
in each of the countries concerned.<br />
They, I believe, as well as we, felt that each<br />
derived value from it. Australia is known<br />
among the countries of the area as a good<br />
ally, and a reliable friend. We clearly have<br />
a not insignificant part to play in the future<br />
of a region undergoing a revolution of<br />
change-a revolution surely representing<br />
one of the historic movements in the story<br />
of mankind. I return with a firmly based<br />
confidence in the allied capacity to defeat<br />
aggression and establish conditions for<br />
peace and security. We must keep a clear<br />
and' calm vision of what we are trying to<br />
achieve and a resolute will to do it. My<br />
Cabinet colleagues and I have long held the<br />
view that Asian countries are prepared to<br />
work closely with others in preserving<br />
security in the region and in establishing<br />
a structure of defence and effective power<br />
to deter future aggression. I return<br />
strengthened in that conviction. The<br />
principles of collective security that we have<br />
been following are soundly based. Our<br />
defence policies are the right policies for<br />
Australia at this time.<br />
I present the following paper-<br />
Prime Minister's Visit to South East Asia-<br />
Ministerial Statement, 5th May 1966-<br />
and move-<br />
That the House take note of the paper.<br />
BY AUTHORITY: A. J. ARTHUR, COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT PRINTER, CANBERRA </p>
