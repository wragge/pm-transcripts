j A UST RA L 1,,<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR PRESS NOVEMBER 4, 1976<br />
ENDANGERED SPECIES LEAFLETS<br />
The Prime Minister, Mr Malcolm Fraser, today launched the<br />
publication of a series of leaflets on endangered species<br />
of Australian wildlife.<br />
The species featured in the first five leaflets are the<br />
Rabbit-eared Bandicoot, the Bridled Nail-tailed Wallaby,<br />
the Banded Hare-wallaby, the Night Parrot and the Ground Parrot.<br />
Other leaflets are in preparation. Each leaflet contains<br />
information on the ecology, description, status and distribution<br />
of a rare, endangered species, a coloured illustration of the<br />
animal and a photograph of its habitat.<br />
They are aimed at promoting public awareness of Australia's<br />
wildlife heritage and the need for its conservation.<br />
Support for the viewpoint that man must live in harmony with<br />
his environment has been growing and it is becoming widely<br />
recognised that Australians are seen by the rest of the world<br />
as having a ; pecial responsibility to ensure the continued<br />
survival of those plants and animals which are unique to<br />
Australia. The diversity of Australian native wildlife is an important<br />
and characteristic part of the environment, and contributes<br />
significantly to the scientific cultural, educational and<br />
aesthetic well-being of the community.<br />
The series of leaflets are being prepared by the Australian<br />
National Parks and Wildlife Service to assist in protecting<br />
Australian animals and plants theatened with extinction.<br />
The introduction of the leaflets coincides with the first<br />
meeting of Parties to the Convention on International Trade<br />
in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora in Berne, Switzerland,<br />
from 2 6 November 1976.<br />
All species featured in the leaflets have been nominated by<br />
Australia for inclusion in Appendix I to this Convention.<br />
The Australian species listed on this appendix have been<br />
determined jointly by the Commonwealth and State Wildlife Services.<br />
The leaflets are available from the Australian National Parks<br />
and Wildlife Serivce, P. O. Box 636, Canberra City 2601 and Australian<br />
Government Publishing Service Bookshops in all capital cities. </p>
