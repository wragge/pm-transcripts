TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW WITH THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J.<br />
KEATING, MP<br />
WOMEN, POWER AND THE 21ST CENTURY CONFERENCE, MELBOURNE<br />
FRIDAY 3 DECEMBER, 1" 3<br />
J: Prime Minister, the Issue of the day do you believe you will manage to<br />
make peace with Malaysia having written to Dr Mahathir overnight and<br />
Indeed, have you heard anything back from him?<br />
PM: No, I haven't. I have written to Dr Mahathir, and that and what we have<br />
said, I think, Is to say enough about the Issue now to we can get on with<br />
the rest of the business of the oountry Which Is Important, And, I noticed<br />
today that a bit of real news did squeeze Its way on to the front page of<br />
the Australian press A rarity I know but there It was, OGATT, the final<br />
historic chapter', and, of course the G3ATT moans so much to Australia.<br />
And, also, oJob ads soa as recovery gathers pace". So, we are starting<br />
to see the economy start to pick up. We're starting to see the response In<br />
the job vacancies and job ads. wo've had 70,000 employment growth over<br />
the past two months. Arid that and the environment where we are on the<br />
precipice now, on the cusp of making a Very large International change In<br />
the General Agreement an Tariffs and Trade, the GATT, which promises<br />
to set the world up for a period of growth which would be unprecedented<br />
given the range of the Wsues under discussion.<br />
So, these are very good portenlts for the country and that, coupled with<br />
APLO a meeting We've just completed which Is an Asia-Pacific<br />
area organisation to look at growth, trade and Investment, these things, I<br />
think, augur well for the country...., particularly for 1994 as we start to see<br />
the recovery here gather pace.<br />
J: Prime Minister, are you saying that the Malaysia row wasn't news? </p>
<p>-2-<br />
PM: Well, It's certainly not news as this Is news. I mean, Australia has had a<br />
recession, we've now been out of it for about nine quarters, I think, from<br />
memory and we're starting to see It gather some real strength. We saw it<br />
In the national accounts the other day, the economy Is now growing at<br />
about three and a quarter percent as fast as any In the western world.<br />
And, of course, we're being tugged along by growth In the Asla-Pacific<br />
area which Is growing faster than the OECD. So, these are the real<br />
Issues, I think.<br />
J: Do you think relations are smoothed over enough... Inaudible...?<br />
PM: Well, I've said all I think I need to say about It.<br />
J: Prime Minister, on GATT, do you support the principle of last minute<br />
concessions to France to clinch a deal?<br />
PM: If there are elements of the current, draft final Act which, In their<br />
application, don't actually tear away at the structure but which would make<br />
this more palatable to get a general agreement, then I think that's worth<br />
considering. But, that doesn't mean wholesale changes to the Blair<br />
House Accord or substantial changes to It.<br />
J; It seems that the base Is being moved that the base from which<br />
GATTs agreement on agricultural products will be a lot softer than<br />
originally planned. Does that matter?<br />
PM: No, that's not apparent at this stage, I don't think. The United States has<br />
held pretty firm. The BSair House Accord is an accord between the<br />
European Community and the United States Government and the United<br />
States has held very firmly to that The fact that It was negotiated by a<br />
previous French administration Is, In a sense, beside the point. Now, no<br />
doubt the French are trying to find wriggle room in their domestic society<br />
on this and that we understand. That's what negotiation Is all about. But<br />
let's hope everybody sees the opportunity of extending the Kennedy<br />
Round In the sixties on a general agreement on goods, to Intellectual<br />
property rights, to services and to agriculture. Because, to do that when<br />
these very large societies are re-emerging In the world economy really,<br />
for the first time since In the case of Russia, the first world war and in<br />
the case of China the second world war to see these large nations<br />
returning to the world economy with the cold war now finished, we need a<br />
good backdrop In rules on trade to really kick the world along and GATT Is<br />
the name of that. </p>
<p>-3-J: Have you discussed with either Joan Ki( rner or Carmen Lawrence your<br />
desire to see them in Federal Pariament?<br />
PM: Well, I have at odd times discused It with both Of them but for various<br />
reasons they have seen fit to Stay In the Jurisdictions they are In, In the<br />
states. But, there Is no doubt that we need more women In the federal<br />
parliament. We need more women of their calibre In the federal<br />
parliament and the more reprsenlative the palament is of the Australian<br />
community, the better the parliament will be. it's under-represented now,<br />
with women and It needs to have a higher representation amongst<br />
women.<br />
j Your job's cut out for you though Isn't it? Even hero In Victoria the new<br />
leader, Mr Brumby has been trying to Implement strategies and<br />
procedures for Increasing the number of women and been rolled by the<br />
factions.<br />
PM: Well, I canst attest, cheek by jowl, of all the factional movements In<br />
Victoria but I think the big principle Is the Australian Labor Party Is<br />
genuinely Interested in the affairs of Australian women, we appreciated<br />
their support at the last election, we have done many, many things to<br />
Improve the lot of Austrailan women. More recently, with the generalised<br />
child care rebate and the home child care allowance, on top of many other<br />
things which we've done In the I 960s which I reconted this morning.<br />
And I think it Is that notion that Labo Is the party which cares most, I<br />
believe, In a practical way about women and women's Issues, that we<br />
reaily need to reinforce tt wfth a higher representation of women In our<br />
parliamentary parties. So, this has got to be a state of mind thing In the<br />
Labor Party and Its got to be a state of mind thing In our national politics.<br />
And, I think, the state of mind thing matters more than any sort of factional<br />
arrangement about whio should get what, where. Rather, the state of<br />
mind that women must be a larger part of the national body poitic.<br />
J: Prime Minister, can we expect to se more women In Cabinet before the<br />
next election and would you expect to see more women in Cabinet If you<br />
win the next elction, afterwards.<br />
PIM: Well, I'd like to see more women In Cabinet. It's a matter of, again, finding<br />
the opportunities and seeing the portfolios that particuiar people can hold<br />
or wouid do Justice to. Bu, part of that IS to lift the general stock, the<br />
numbers and we just don't have that there now. That Is. there just aren't<br />
enough women In the federal Labor Party and therefore, It you like, the </p>
<p>TEL: 3. Dec. 93 12: 09 No. 020 P. 04/ 04<br />
-4-area from which ministers are drawn is just not as large as It would<br />
otherwise be. Lets hope that Improves after the next election.<br />
J: Is this concept of half by 2000 realltic under those circumstances?<br />
PM: Well, I think it's a good objective ana It gets the focus on the issue and I<br />
think that... I mean, lets make the simple point; the more the parliament<br />
is representative of the general population, the better off It will be.<br />
Therefore, the more women that are In parliament, the better, generally,<br />
will the nation's policies be.<br />
Ends. </p>
