TELEVISION INTERVIEW GIVEN BY THE PRIME<br />
MINISTER, MR JOHN GORTON, AT THE LODGE,<br />
SCAINBERRA, FOR GTV9 MELBOURNE,.<br />
po 3RD JUNE, 1968<br />
13 JPAInterviewer: Mr Alan Reid-<br />
Mr Michael Schildberger This is the first time on Australian television<br />
that we have been able to bring you a direct telecast from the Prime<br />
Minister's Lodge in Canberra. The Prime Minister, Mr Gorton, has<br />
agreed to speak to us tonight about the significance of his recent,<br />
just completed tour of America. Sydney " Daily Telegraph's" Alan<br />
Reid travelled with the Prime Minister in America. He is here<br />
tonight to interview the Prime Minister.<br />
Q. Mr Gorton, President Johnson gave you more time, in my<br />
experience, than any other Australian Prime Minister has received.<br />
You also had contact with three out of the five Presidential candidates.<br />
I know you have to allow for the unforeseeable, but is your impression<br />
now that the U. S. will remain interested in Asia?<br />
PM: Let's taike this in stages. We don't have to have an<br />
impression up until January next year because the present President,<br />
who will be in office up until January next year has unequivocally stated<br />
in the speech he made to the White House Dinner that there would be no<br />
diminution in the U. S. interest in Asia, and although he couldn't speak<br />
for hs successors, he could speak completely for himself. And * this<br />
carries us through for the next six or seven months. We don't have<br />
to form an impression. That's a definite statement. For possible<br />
successors, we do have to form impressions and the impressions that<br />
I have formed are that the man who is most likely, so I am told, o be<br />
the Democratic nominee for President at the next Presidential election,<br />
Mr ' Humphrey, will be at least as strong, if not stronger than President<br />
Johnson on the necessity for involvement in Asia by the United States.<br />
On the Republican side, I believe from the soundings I have been able<br />
to make from my direct talks with Governor Rockefeller, my telephone<br />
talk with Mr Nixon and from talks with significant backers of the<br />
Republican Party, that there will also be likely to be very likely<br />
to be continuing interest in Asia by the U. S.<br />
Q. Is this interest, in your view, based on their realisation<br />
of their self-interest or is it altruistic or a mixture of both?<br />
PM: I think it is a mi xture of both. I think it is a realisation<br />
of their self-interest. I think it is a desire which has been quite<br />
evident in what the U. S. has done in many fields over the last dec ' ade<br />
or two that their self-interest is served by the advancement of the<br />
interests of other countries, just aq in a sense, ours is. It's a<br />
mixture of self-interest and altruism, because altruism, if it is to<br />
be regarded as trying to build up other countries, will have the effect<br />
of having the self-interest also served.<br />
Q. President Johnson at his White House Dinner went to great<br />
lengths to answer your speech on the Lawn. He committed himself<br />
very deeply to it. He took a line that could possibly influence his<br />
successor. What influence do you think President Johnson will have<br />
upon a future Democrat Administration and a Republican<br />
AdIrtinistration? 2 </p>
<p>-2<br />
PM: I think he will have considerable influence on any future<br />
Democrat Administration, although I don't know that that influence<br />
would be needed if in fact Mr Humphrey were to be the Democrat<br />
nominee and were to be elected as President. But even if that weren't so,<br />
he would be a past President, a past President who had relinquished the<br />
chance of office for an endeavour to bring peace and prosperit y to<br />
Asia. He would have reliquinshed an almost certain I think this is<br />
true an almost certain chance of being re-elected as President, for<br />
this purpose. This, together with his long experience as majority<br />
leader in the Senate would, I think, lead him to have a great effect on<br />
any future Administration, a Democrat Administration. Now, his<br />
effect on a future Republican Administration would not, of course, be<br />
so great, but I would think that even a future Republican Administration,<br />
if it were in fact needed, would be affected by the influence which<br />
President Johnson could bring to bear in the country generally. But<br />
I don't know that a future Republican Administration would need to<br />
have any of this kind<br />
Q. Senior Administration officials in Washington, as I<br />
understand it, expressed the desirability of Australia maintaining its<br />
defence associations with both Malaysia and Singapore and the<br />
desirability of us maintaining a presence there. Did you in fact put<br />
what seems to be the realistic viewpoint that we could maintain a<br />
presence there only in the light of them taking a certain line of action?<br />
PM Well, I'm fascinated to hear this question.... The Senior<br />
Administration, as you understand it, expressed a particular point of<br />
view. Well, I've no doubt that you have methods of assessing these<br />
things, but all I can say is that your understanding must be based on<br />
something other than any public statement that I have made or am going<br />
to make on this matter. You asked me did they have this view. That<br />
is for them to make public or not make public, and I'm not going to<br />
comment on whatever impression it may be that you have received from<br />
whoever it may be that you have talked to. What was the second part of<br />
that question?<br />
Q. Did you emphasise to them that our attitude in Singapore and<br />
Malaysia, our presence there, would be governed by attitudes that they<br />
might possibly take?<br />
PM: Well, I think in answer to that, all I would say would be to<br />
refer you to what I said when I arrived, and we were going to make, the<br />
speech on the Lawn, but made it inside instead, and that speech*<br />
indicated Australia's abiding interest in South-East Asia, abiding desire<br />
to see that its standards of living were raised and said that we had a<br />
present and a future in that area and we had a part to play in that qrea<br />
in trying to achieve the results that we wanted to achieve but that we<br />
could not effectively play it alone.<br />
Q. Your approach in this seems to me to have been somewhat<br />
different from both Sir Robert Menzies and Mv-r Holt who, so far as I<br />
understood their emphasis, it was that we should do everything possible<br />
to encourage America to stay in Asia. Now, as I interpret your<br />
approach, maybe incorrectly, it was that we would not be staying in<br />
Asia unless they were there. Was this in fact your approach? ./ 3 </p>
<p>-3<br />
PM: Well, this is a very wide question. I think we can't divorce<br />
ourselves from Asia. I think we can't say we won't have an interest<br />
in Asia no matter what other powers may do. We would because we<br />
are contiguous to the area. B ecause we are interested in the area,: we<br />
would do what we could to try and underpin the economies, to provide the<br />
technological requirements of the area, even if we had to try and do it<br />
alone. But I don't think that alone we could do it with sufficient<br />
effectiveness, with sufficient force, to achieve the results that would<br />
need to be achieved in the next few years in that area. There are others<br />
who would need to come in, and of these ct hers, I think the U. S. is the<br />
most significant.<br />
Q. There seems to be some confusion about your Israeli-type<br />
defence statement to the Washington Press Club. My interpretation of<br />
the thing was that this was one of many options that you were keeping<br />
open against future defence needs for Australia. Is that interpretat ion<br />
correct?<br />
PM: Yes, well, I think you were there at the time . the question<br />
was answered, and I think your interpretation is relatively cotktect,<br />
except that we were asked, you will remember, the question did we<br />
believe iA an Israell-iype defence force. I said on this matter I wouldn't<br />
comment the actual Israeli-type defence force but that I would seek<br />
to define what we in Australia would regard as an Israeli-type. That is<br />
a force which has a Regular Army component but which has a back-up<br />
force, well equipped, proped. yequipped, properly trained, quickly<br />
able to go into action and a growing capacity to do it and a growing<br />
amount of numbers to do it of the citizen forces type of military capacity,<br />
where in order to back up your regular forces you have a capacity to<br />
quickly get into action military forces, although the people of whom those<br />
back-up forces are composed are citizens for most of the time but who<br />
are trained to be able to take their place quickly in an emergency.<br />
Q. Basically you were not announcing any proposed policy. You<br />
were dealing with a contingency which might arise in extreme circumstances?<br />
PM: I wasn't announcing any new policy at all, or indeed a<br />
contingency which might arise in extreme circumstances, but rather<br />
seeking to define, to give a definition of what could be loosely described<br />
as an Israeli type very loosely described as an Israeli-type polic~ y,<br />
which is indeed the sort of policy we now have that is Regular Forces<br />
backed up by Citizen Military Forces, but suggesting that one of thle<br />
options and in this you would be quite correct one of the options for<br />
the future could be not a diminution in any way of our Regular Forces<br />
ready for action at a m en's notice but rather a strengthening of the<br />
back-up Citizens Military Forces who would come in behind those<br />
Regular Forces. This is one of the options, one of the objectives, and<br />
one of the ones that we have always had.<br />
Q. President Johnson had you there when General Westmoreland<br />
gave his analysis of the present situation in South Viet Nam. Basically,<br />
he said that this could be a desperate throw on the part of the Viet Cong<br />
and the North Vietnamese which could run out. Did you accept that<br />
analysis, or did you ' have any reservations about it in the light of events<br />
there? / 4 </p>
<p>-4<br />
PM: No, this was an assessment which was made on the ba~ iis of<br />
the Intelligence information available to General Wiestmoreland that the<br />
Tet offensive for a start, and the present attack on Saigon was in some<br />
sense almost a suicidal operation in order to try and have a political<br />
effect on the peace talks which were at present going on. Now, I have<br />
no way of checking the basic infallibility of the Intelligence on which<br />
General Westmoreland based his report, but it does seem tha the<br />
original Tet offensive was, from a military point of view as concerns<br />
the North Vietnamese, unsuccessful; from a political point of view<br />
overseas, far more successful than it was in the country itself.<br />
It is not therefore unreasonable to suppose that this assessment of<br />
General Westmnoreland's is reasonably accurate.<br />
Q. In the military but not in the political sense?<br />
PM: In the military sense accurate in that it was unlikely to<br />
lead to any decisive military result. In the p olitical sense accurate<br />
in that it might overseas lead to some political advantage to the North<br />
Vietnamese which the military results of their present operations<br />
would not justify.<br />
Q. just two more questions, if I may. Do the Americans<br />
ascribe the same importance to ANZUS as we do, and is the general<br />
interpretation that it extends to our forces in the Malayan, Singapore<br />
area?<br />
PM: They, I am convinced, do ascribe the same importance to<br />
ANZUS as we do, and particularly to the defence of Australia and of<br />
New Zealand. As to the particular areas in which ANZUS might apply,<br />
this is something which I think I couldn't properly accurately comment<br />
upon in answer to your question.<br />
Q. You leave on Wednesday lookidng very fresh, if I may say so,<br />
after the exhausting tour you have had for another tour, this time of<br />
South-East Asia. What are your intenrbnsthere? Are you planning<br />
any substantive talks or what are you after there?<br />
PM: No. Mostly as far as Viet Nam is concerned, I want to see<br />
our own troops up there. I want to taka-e what opportunities I can to<br />
visit them, and I suppose I'd be too much of a nuisance if I went too<br />
far forward, so they may not allow me to do that, and I understand.<br />
But I want to see them wherever they are so far as I can do it without<br />
upsetting them or causing too much trouble to them. As far as Singapore,<br />
Malaya and Indonesia are concerned, the main objective of this visit<br />
is to show that there is from a new Prime Minister of Australia the<br />
same interest in the area, the same desire to meet the leading figures<br />
in the area as was evinced by my predecessor, Mr Holt, that there has<br />
been no changre in Australia's continuing and abiding interest, up<br />
change in Australia's desire that the leaders of each of the countries<br />
in our region should know each other, and I would hope that this visit<br />
would show that, and would help to show the peoples of the region<br />
concerned that there is this continuing, neighbourly, friendly interest,<br />
this desire to help and to be a part of the area in which we all live.<br />
Q. Are you considering laying the groundwork for any say,<br />
formal non-aggression pact or something like that with Indonesia?<br />
PM: If Indonesia were happy to have a non-aggression pact with<br />
ourselves, with Malaya and Singapore, we would be happy to do all we<br />
could to see that such a non-aggression pact did becon-e a reality<br />
Q. Thank you, Mr Prime Minister. </p>
