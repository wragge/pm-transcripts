<p>Prime Minister Julia Gillard and the Minister for Sport Kate Lundy proudly welcomed home members of the Australian Olympic Team at Sydney Airport today.</p>
<p>The Olympics is the pinnacle international sporting event and our Australian team were inspiring ambassadors for the nation.</p>
<p>We are enormously proud of our athletes for delivering a strong result in an increasingly competitive international environment at the London Games.</p>
<p>Our 410 Australian athletes saw Australia finish number ten on the medal table, winning a total 35 medals.</p>
<p>Competing at an Olympic Games is a momentous achievement and often the culmination of years of hard work, sacrifice and dedication.</p>
<p>The entire country cheered on our athletes as they competed at the London Games. </p>
<p>We shared in the moments of triumph and disappointment.</p>
<p>The moments we shared over the last fortnight have also inspired young Australians across the nation to develop a passion for sport.</p>
<p>The Australian Government invested record funding to support our elite athletes and Olympians committing over $382 million in funding over the four years leading to the Games.</p>
