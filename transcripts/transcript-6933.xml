PRIME MINISTER<br />
E 0 E -PROOF ONLY<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF PRESS CONFERENCE AT THE MANILA HOTEL -MANILA<br />
26 MAY 1986<br />
PM: Ladies and Gentlemen, I will make a relatively brief<br />
statement and then I am open to any questions you may have.<br />
I would say at the outset now that I am very grateful to<br />
have had this opportunity to visit the Philippines and<br />
to hear at first hand from President Aquino about tm~ ee-Cce"<br />
priorities, concerns and plans. As you are aware Australians<br />
very warmly welcome her accession to the presidency. We<br />
believe that the manner in which that accession was achieved<br />
was a very great tribute to the quality and charact. er of<br />
the people of the Philippines. I think in very few countries<br />
would it have been possible given the context and environment<br />
to have achieved that changeover with the minimal amoun<br />
of bloodshed that in fact took place. We have expressed<br />
our desire as a Government and people of Australia to assist<br />
President Aquino and her Government in their reform and<br />
development policies. Quite clearly the change of Government<br />
is a particularly important development for the Asia/ Pacific<br />
region. We are looking forward to the resumption of a full<br />
and friendly government to government relationship. And<br />
I reminded the President of just how quickly my Government<br />
moved to recognise the Government and to demonstrate its<br />
support. I told the President that it was our wish ' that<br />
this visit so early in the life of her Government would<br />
be a firm demonstration of our commitment in that regard.<br />
I sort from President Aquino a personal appraisal of how<br />
she believed things were going and I was briefed by her<br />
on the policies and programs and concepts that she and<br />
the Government have for meeting the massive problems with<br />
which she and the people of the. Philippines have confronted.<br />
She told me about the steps so far that have been taken<br />
on the commission of good government. And she indicated,<br />
having announced the membership of the Constitutional Commission<br />
yesterday, her hopes that work will be relatively and speedily<br />
performed and that there would then be the opportunity<br />
of discussion within the society and then the relatively<br />
early stage elections flowing from it. You will recall<br />
that when Mr Hayden, my Foreign Minister, visited the Philippines<br />
in March he announced that the Australian Government would<br />
increase its aid by 50% to $ 25 million in 1986/ 87 and thereby<br />
demonstrating again the commitment we have to assisting<br />
in the programs of reform. Following that statement </p>
<p>by tvir Hayden in march the iAustraliar .6Mission visited<br />
the Philippines from 5-18 April and toe purpose of that<br />
visit was to consider in discussion with the officials<br />
of the Philippines how best to deploy those increased-resources.<br />
I imformed the President that my Government had now endorsed<br />
the strategy recommended by the Aid Mission and I would<br />
like to indicate to you the outline which I gave to Mrs<br />
Aquino on this matter. Subject to specific proposals being<br />
prepared, aid will be provided in three phases. In the<br />
first phase emphasis will be placed on the continuation<br />
of existing programs, on the introduction of a community<br />
assistance program for assistance at grass roots level<br />
mainly through non-government organisations and the church,<br />
preparation of longer term projection key sectors such<br />
as agriculture and education, provision of technical assistance<br />
in policy and program formulation, the introduction of<br />
a commodity supply program as a response to the immediate<br />
critical economic situation. Under that aspect of the first<br />
phase of the aid program Australia will provide commodities<br />
in key areas of the economy with the proceeds of the sale<br />
of these being used to mitigate the budget deficit and<br />
to support priority social welfare programs. In the second<br />
phase it is envisaged that that commodity supply program<br />
would be phased down. Greater emphasis Would-then be placed<br />
on that second phase on the further development of the<br />
community assistance program, the further preparation of<br />
long term projects and provision of technical assistance.<br />
In the third phase the strategy anticipates that the balance<br />
of payments and budget support measures being terminated<br />
and the aid program would then comprise of fully operational<br />
community assistance programs and large, longer term projects<br />
in priority areas. I spoke with the President about international<br />
issues. I specifically indicated our appreciation that<br />
the Philippines offered to host the next round of regional<br />
trade consultations. That meeting will be held in Manila<br />
before the GATT ministerial meeting in September. I told<br />
the president of our repugnance at the actions over a long<br />
period of Marcos and the cronies of Marcos having apparently<br />
placed massive assets of the people of the Philippines<br />
abroad. I said to her that we would assist in respect of<br />
inquiries about any such assets in Australia to the maximum<br />
extent possible that we could. This Would mean in particular<br />
helping with the provision of relevant information. That<br />
process of course would then have to be conducted within<br />
in the Australian legal processes. Other matters that we<br />
discussed included the internal security of the Philippines<br />
as well as-a number of regional foreign policy issues..<br />
In that context I referred to the fact that we in Australia<br />
had joint facilities with the United States and I expressed<br />
to the President the view of my Government that the hosting<br />
of these joint facilities in our countries was consistent<br />
with our capacity as a Government to pursue rigorously<br />
as we had done in the three years of Government, our policies </p>
<p>in regard to the need fo .) ves towctIUs disarmament, to<br />
create a more peaceful world environment within that we<br />
have that the existence of the joint facilities was consistent<br />
with that. I would like to conclude by, before going to<br />
questions, saying that in our first meeting President Aquino<br />
and I had a significant victory over the forces of protocol<br />
and bureaucratic conservatism. At the end of our meeting<br />
President Aquino said to me that she understood that my<br />
wife and daughter were visiting with me and she uj~ s4reS<br />
that they weren't here. And apparently protocol had arranged<br />
and ordained otherwise so we agreed that it was time for<br />
Presidents and Prime Ministers to assert their authority.<br />
We did and I am very pleased to say that at the end of<br />
my meeting my wife and daughter were able to have a meeting<br />
with the President which we very much appreciated. Any<br />
questions? JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, I am just wondering what President<br />
Aquino' s reply was to your comments on bases and would<br />
it be alright in Australia's terms to be turned<br />
joint facilities......?<br />
PM: There was no attempt on my part nor would I ever contempladte<br />
purporting to tell the Government and the President of<br />
the Philippines how they should conduct their affairs with<br />
the United States or what they shuld do about any changes<br />
to the nature of bases. I mean I make no such presumption.<br />
As far as President Aquino is concerned she said that the<br />
agreement ran until 1991. That was her position and at<br />
this point as far as she was concerned she was not going<br />
to be involved publicly in any debate or discussion a bout<br />
those issuies and that her immediate priorities which<br />
agree with are domestic economic priorities.<br />
JOURNALIST: Recently the Government of New South Wales<br />
tried to recruit 2,000 Filipino nurses to work in Australia<br />
however it was blocked by some trade unions who appeared<br />
0obe evading Australian immigration laws. Will your Government<br />
work for the easing of Australian immigration laws for<br />
Filipino....... to Australia?<br />
PM: Let me make it clear that as far Australia's immigration<br />
laws are concerned the days of any descrimination on the<br />
basis of the country of origin, or race or colour, have<br />
long been behind us. So any implication in your question<br />
at any attitude by any segments * were based on those considerations<br />
and that they have been able to use immigration laws for<br />
that reason are not soundly based. President Aquino did<br />
raise with me the question of the nurses. She said she<br />
understood that there was a shortage of nurses in Australia<br />
and that there would be available properly trained nurses<br />
from the Philippines. And I have simply said to the President<br />
that I would acquaint myself with the details of this matter<br />
on my return. I have not been in any specific way briefed<br />
about it and so I have given her that undertakisr </p>
<p>Lokat it returr Asrla<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, one interpretation of the<br />
ANZUS Treaty has it that Washington could seek Australian<br />
military assistance in the<br />
PM: The matter hasn't been raised with me and I see no<br />
point in speculating about it. It doesn't seem to be an<br />
issue which is remotely within the realm of our concerns<br />
for the foreseeable future. And I repeat it has not been<br />
raised with me.<br />
JOURNALIST: What did Mrs Aquino raise with you of all<br />
aniytLb i nq stpec i r i ca 1 I y r-e I a Led L~ o Lhe( L rans (' or o) F a sse t. s<br />
out of the Philippines to Australia?<br />
PM: Well, Geoff, I raised the matter with her. I expressed<br />
the repugnance of Australians to the massive raping of<br />
the resources of the Philippine people by the previous<br />
regime. I knew it was a matter for concern for them and<br />
she agreed that and still being surprised almost daily<br />
by the dimension of what occurred. And because I knew that<br />
it was a matter for concern I said well, we understand<br />
that and offered to provide any assistance that we possibly<br />
could within Australia if they were to identify what they<br />
believe were assets that had been improperly acquired.<br />
JOURNALIST:... PM: No, our defence co-operation program now with this<br />
Government remains operative. And I did not discuss the<br />
matter with the President but at an appropriate time it<br />
would be the case I think that my Minister may wish to<br />
have discussions at the ministerial level and I am sure<br />
that discussions will continue at the level of officials<br />
to see what is the most appropriate method of assistance<br />
there. You will appreciate that members of the Philippines<br />
armed forces have been coming to Australia for training.<br />
It seems that that will continue to be an appropriate of<br />
the DCP. If the new Government wishes in any way to suggest<br />
other or more effective ways in which co-operation program<br />
can be given effect to well then, of course, we stand ready<br />
to do that.<br />
JOURNALIST: On the question of bases, does the Australian<br />
Government...... PM: We believe that the presence of the American bases<br />
is appropriate and yes we believe it is a contribution<br />
to strategic stability in the region.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, did you express that yourself<br />
to Mrs Aquino? Australia. </p>
<p>PM: I ekpre., -a view a, our assess. of the net~<br />
for security in tne. region. ueliberately u-, u not seek<br />
to intrude myself into telling the Philippines Government<br />
what it should do. Rather I indicated that we were a relatively<br />
new Government and that we had had to face the question<br />
what was the appropriate policy position in regard to the<br />
joint facilities in our country. I explained our processes<br />
of approach on this, the decisions that we had arrived<br />
at, the way in which that decision was totally consistent<br />
with our pursuit of policies to which I have already alluded,<br />
the policies of trying to achieve progress in the areas<br />
of disarmament and that it was totally possible while having<br />
those joint facilities to pursue an independent foreign<br />
policy. It didn't mean that because we had joint facilities<br />
with the United States that we necessarily on every issue<br />
saw eye to eye with them or would not be in a position<br />
at times where we disagreed to point that disagreement<br />
out. So it is clear from what I said that the view of our<br />
Government that the presence of the bases here was consistent<br />
with the Australian Government's own perception. And I<br />
deliberately refrain as it is proper for me to do so from<br />
telling this Government what it should do.<br />
J OURNALIST:...<br />
PM: No, not at all. We are meeting next week with other<br />
major aid donors particularly Japan and the United States<br />
and it is quite clear from the outline that I have given<br />
that the sorts of things that we are talking about would<br />
in any co-ordination process be appropriate to be done<br />
by Australia. What we will seek to ensure in the discussions<br />
that we have with others is that there is not a replication<br />
or duplication.-But there is so much to be done here that<br />
there is no way I believe that what would be doing would<br />
be something that was not necessary to be done.<br />
JOURNALIST:......... banned Australia to fly aircraft into<br />
the Philippines?<br />
PM: Yes, I did make the point to President Aquino that<br />
we tended to regard as a badge of honour the decision of<br />
the previous Government to ban our aircraft because of<br />
the strength which my Government had expressed their views<br />
about the activities of the previous Government. And in<br />
no-circumstances while it was appropriately regarded as<br />
a badge of honour, it was not one now we thought we needed<br />
to wear and the President indicated to me that she understood<br />
our concern, It has been brought to her attention and I<br />
think that you will find that this matter will be dealf<br />
with reasonably quickly.<br />
JOURNALIST:... PM: No I have not had any information given to me which<br />
would indicate that that is the case and all I can say </p>
<p>on the quesu, any acquit I of a s and dea.<br />
in Australian by the previous ~. me I '., dvce given the inaication<br />
to the President as I have said that we will provide what<br />
information we appropriately can within our legal processes.<br />
If they have any information at all then we would like<br />
to know of it. We will do what we can within our legal<br />
framework to assist. I mean if you look at the total picture<br />
and just not what they have done in Australia because I<br />
am not aware but it is difficult to imagine anything more<br />
obscene than the activities of the previous President and<br />
his cronies in stealing from the people of the Philippines<br />
the assets which they so sorely need.<br />
JOURNALIST: Does this mean that bank accounts can be opened<br />
like they are being opened in Switzerland...?<br />
PM: No, what I have said is that we would want the Philippine<br />
Government if they identify in their judgement assets in<br />
Australia which have been improperly or illegally acquired<br />
to indicate that to us. And that within our legal processes<br />
we will provide what information and assistance we can.<br />
We will not be changing any legal processes in Australia<br />
on this matter.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, most Australians are apparently<br />
ignorant about the Philippines and vice versa. Does your<br />
Government intend....... exchange programs between Filipinos<br />
and Australianj ' l<br />
PM: There have been some such interchanges in the past.<br />
I accept the point that you make that there is not a sufficient<br />
degree of knowledge between our two countries of one anothers<br />
cultures, traditions and background and I would be certain<br />
that in the discussions that will be going on particularly<br />
when my Foreign Minister again comes here next month for<br />
post-ASEAN ministers talks that this will be one area in<br />
which discussions will be held. There are limits, of course,<br />
in terms of government budget facilities to what can be<br />
funded but there are ways I believe in which in non-government<br />
funded directions there can be a stimulation of contacts<br />
between our two peoples. And we will certainly be keen<br />
to do whatever we can in that direction.<br />
JOURNALIST: On the Marcos assets Mr Hawke can we<br />
assume that the Government hasn't made any progress on<br />
identifying those assets so far anc r hr particular<br />
problems there do you think?<br />
PM: Well, let me repeat the point Mike, President Aquino<br />
did not raise it me. I mentioned it to her. So I take it<br />
that at there end I have not reached a position where they<br />
have done enough work I would assume to have identified<br />
the particular problem. It was my concern merely to indicate<br />
to the President our attitude, that we wanted to do all<br />
that we could to help. The initiative must be with them. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, I have two questions.<br />
PM: Yes, of course.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, are there any conditions attached<br />
aid to the Philippines?<br />
PM: It is not a 25% increase. It is a 50% increase to<br />
million. No there are no conditions. Australia is at<br />
the forefront of aid donors in the world in the lack of<br />
conditionality attached to our aid. It is virtually all<br />
in grant form. If you want to put a condition as it were<br />
though it is not exactly the right world, our fundamental<br />
concern is that as far as possible Australian aid shall<br />
be going to the grass roots level. We want to see and we<br />
want to have the feeling that the assistance we give is<br />
going to be directed to programs which are going improve<br />
the well-being of the ordinary Filipino people.<br />
JOURNALIST:... PM: That is a very good question. I don't know whether<br />
people here heard it but it was asked whether the President<br />
asked for more aid or did she say 25 million was enough.<br />
One of the refreshing characteristics of President Aquino<br />
I think is her directness. And she expressed considerable<br />
gratitude for the action and the speed of the action of<br />
the Australian Government. She indicated not only as far<br />
as Australia was concerned but for the rest of the world<br />
that the Philippines needed as much assistance as they<br />
could possibly get. So this wasn't put in terms of saying<br />
at all, well Mr Hawke, thank you for your 25 million, I<br />
don't think it is enough. But she genuinely said clearly<br />
the Philippines can use as much aid as it possibly can<br />
get because the magnitude of the task is so enormous.<br />
JOURNALIST: Well, you will notice from the answer I gave<br />
previously that I think the basic responsibility for this<br />
must lie with the Government of the Philippines and I repeat<br />
the answer that I have given that. if in~ the light of investigation<br />
they do they want to take proceedings an d believe the proceedings<br />
are appropriate then we will provide all1 the assistance<br />
that we can within the processes of the law.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, can you tell us about your<br />
discussions on insurgency with President Aquino. You said<br />
that she had briefed you. Perhaps you also offered your<br />
own observations?<br />
PM: I am not an authority on insurgency. But she did indicate<br />
to me that she had a considerable degree of optimism both<br />
in terms of the attitude of the people who had been involved<br />
in insurgency that she believed the hard core was a relatively<br />
small percentage and that the others would be responsive.<br />
Within that she made the point that it was important that<br />
the-Government should be able to provide the opportunity<br />
for active and constructive involvement of the previous </p>
<p>insurgence in agricultural activity and that the Government<br />
had plans for making land available not merely to ex-insurgents<br />
but as part of dealing with the problem of insurgency the<br />
Government was concerned with trying to ensure that there<br />
was a revitalisation of rural agricultural activity. The<br />
third point that she made was that she believed that the<br />
the reform in the armed forces was significant and effective<br />
and that the people in the rural areas would have an increased<br />
confidence in the integrity of the armed forces and she<br />
regarded this as relevant in dealing with problem.<br />
JOURNALIST: PM: We in fact will be having here within a matter of<br />
two months, there will be meetings of the joint commission<br />
and of the business co-operation committee and out of those<br />
discussions, the level of officials and of the-business<br />
level the question of opportunities in increased Australian<br />
investment will be one of the issues that will be addressed<br />
at those meetings. And I would hope that out of those discussions<br />
there would be the opportunity for some forms of investment<br />
here which would be mutually beneficial. </p>
