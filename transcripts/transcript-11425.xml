<p>Well thank you very Angry. To Pat, to his mum, Kath, to his two children,</p>
<p> Brooke and Dillon, all of whom will be accompanying him on this remarkable</p>
<p> run around Australia, to the President of the Senate, Peter McGauran,</p>
<p> Laurie Ferguson and Senator Faulkner, ladies and gentlemen.</p>
<p>It's an enormous privilege for me this morning to say godspeed,</p>
<p> bon voyage, good luck, great running, whatever exhortations one chooses</p>
<p> to use. To Pat, on behalf of the entire Australian nation, this is</p>
<p> a spectacularly Australian way of really beginning the public face</p>
<p> of the celebration of the centenary of the Australian nation. It brings</p>
<p> together two things that are very close to the Australian identity.</p>
<p> And that is personal achievement, particularly on the sporting field,</p>
<p> and also the vast distance, and the size of our remarkable country.</p>
<p>But over the next, what, 217-odd days, Pat will join Australians in</p>
<p> every Territory and every State. For openers, he said to me, he's</p>
<p> going to go to Goulburn today, and then after celebrations there he'll</p>
<p> go onto Mittagong. And that is just the beginning and it gives all</p>
<p> of us in the comfort of our offices and whatever else we may be doing,</p>
<p> some idea of the physical challenge, and the physical undertakings</p>
<p> that he's embraced. But it's something that I believe will</p>
<p> touch Australian hearts. It's something that will connect us</p>
<p> with the vastness of our country, and also with personal endeavour</p>
<p> and personal achievement. It's going to be a great celebration</p>
<p> the centenary of federation, and this a special and particularly Australian</p>
<p> way of commencing those celebrations. And in wishing you great success,</p>
<p> in saluting this historic commitment that you are making to such a</p>
<p> huge run around such a large country, I want to express on behalf</p>
<p> of all Australians our thanks, our admiration and our good wishes.</p>
<p> And I've asked Pat to carry a message from me to all of</p>
<p> the people of Australia talking about the celebration of the centenary</p>
<p> of our nation. And that message will read as follows:</p>
<p>   All the people of Australia are invited to celebrate the Centenary</p>
<p>   of the Federation of our nation in 2001.</p>
<p>   I hope that, whatever your heritage and backgrounds, you will</p>
<p>   join the governments and local communities of Australia in commemorating</p>
<p>   the hundredth birthday of our great nation.</p>
<p>   It is a time to reflect on the past, take pride in the present</p>
<p>   and look to the future with confidence.</p>
<p>   A very proud Australian, Pat Farmer, is linking symbolically</p>
<p>   all States and Territories as he undertakes this ultra-marathon</p>
<p>   run for the Centenary. It is this kind of courage and determination</p>
<p>   that built our great nation.</p>
<p>   I am delighted to have Pat Farmer as my special emissary in</p>
<p>   delivering this message to you.</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, I wish on your behalf, good luck Pat on his</p>
<p> great journey around Australia. Thank you.</p>
