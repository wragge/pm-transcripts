TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
DOORSTOP AT 4 TREASURY PLACE, MELBOURNE, 23 JANUARY 1996<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
PM: Well it took 100 hundred years to build Telstra, Telecom. It is Australia's<br />
greatest business. It is the largest business in the country. It is the<br />
business with the greatest potential in Australia. It is the one Australian<br />
business with the greatest potential in Asia. It has a chance of being the<br />
great East Asian communications company the great East Asian phone<br />
business. John* Howard wants to now sell it and he is going to let foreigners buy one<br />
third of each tranche. He says he will let them buy one third of the first<br />
part and then he will decide about the next two bits, he says, if he were to<br />
be the Government after this election and before the next. I will come to<br />
that in a moment because he couldn't sell more than one third of it and<br />
would be flat out selling one third of it now anyway.<br />
But the key point is why is he selling it. He is selling for some money for<br />
election bribes. So he is about to sell, and allow foreigners to own, a<br />
business that we began to build -a century ago. With rudimentary<br />
exchanges in Sydney and Melbourne and telegraph lines on poles across<br />
the Nullarbor Plain, the one indigenous great business, he now says he<br />
will let foreigners own 35 per cent of the first tranche. And then he has<br />
got a minimum requirement, but what it would mean is a corporate force,<br />
or a foreign telephone company perhaps, would then be able to exercise<br />
control. And the people who represent the remaining government<br />
interest, who are only people appointed by the government, would stand<br />
there tryir'g to argue against then a set of private shareholders.<br />
Now let me say this about Telstra. In every country I go to I raise<br />
Telstra's interests. I did with President Soeharto to help them secure a<br />
licence in Java, which they now have. I did last week with Prime Minister<br />
Mahathir. I have done so with President Ramos. I have done it with the<br />
Thai Prime Minister. I regard it as Australia's one great business the<br />
one business where we can have a brand name in the world the way<br />
when you think of Germany you think of Mercedes Benz and you think of<br />
BMW or Japan, Toyota and Sony. Australia's does not have a great<br />
brand name. The one great brand name we can have in the fastest<br />
growing area of business in the world, is Telstra in the business of<br />
telecommunications. </p>
<p>Yet the Liberal Party in their bankruptcy, bereft of policy, with what he<br />
thinks now is an easy resort to money, wants to sell one third of the<br />
business, which is roughly valued at around $ 10 billion. Now you know<br />
this market was flat out digesting the Qantas float which was $ 1500<br />
million. John Howard is telling you, trying to make a virtue of the fact, I<br />
am only selling one third first. One third first is $ 10 billion. $ 10 billion is<br />
six times the size of Qantas.<br />
I mean the market would choke on a privatisation of this size. That is why<br />
he wants the foreigners in and this is at a time when you see the<br />
scramble for telecommunications resources going on all around the world.<br />
MCA buying into the News Corporation because they know that the<br />
transmission of pay television and content and film product and other on<br />
line services are going to be used, are going to go below the medium of<br />
phone companies and you have got British Telecom then buying into<br />
MCA. British Telecom and MCA and particularly British Telecom and if<br />
the American regulators will' let them, the American phone companies and<br />
IT&amp; T and the likes of IT&amp; T, will be out there bidding to control our phone<br />
company, our great telecommunications business.<br />
In otherwords, you know, the tragedy of. the Howard view is that it took us<br />
a cent'Ey to build-it and he is going to let it at this point just as it is about<br />
to blossom, when the greatest potential we have ever had is opening up<br />
for fibre optics and phone businesses and the traffic of digital information.<br />
Then he wants to sell it after a century to foreigners and that is why what<br />
he is proposing is cheap, it is cheap jack and it is unconscionable. And<br />
every Australian who has got any pride in this country, any belief in<br />
Australian enterprise, any imagination about building a big and great<br />
business, should be utterly devastated by the bankruptcy of the Coalition<br />
and their Leader.<br />
Can I also say that our great electronics industries, every electronics<br />
industry in Australia, the fastest growing part of our elaborately<br />
transformed manufactures, lives off essentially the body of Telstra.<br />
Where it goes, they go and if foreign owners favour foreign suppliers,<br />
foreign owners of Telstra, and invariably foreign owners start siphoning<br />
work off to foreign suppliers, that even this core of our electronics<br />
industry will change.<br />
And you might ask the question, as I did earlier, what is this for? What<br />
does selling one third of Telstra and allowing foreigners to own a piece of<br />
it do and why? So he can get some money to try and buy his way into<br />
office. Nothing more, nothing less. No thought, no plan, no strategy,<br />
nothing about building the great East Asian phone business, nothing<br />
about the fact that we have actually got a technically competent large<br />
business with a huge cash flow, that we can actually for the first time ever<br />
build a great world business with, no imagination, no invention just a<br />
sort of hand-me-down sale policy for an asset which has such strategic<br />
significance. </p>
<p>J: Prime Minister, what is the difference between the Coalition's plan to sell<br />
per cent of Teistra and your Government's plan to sell 49 per cent of<br />
Qantas?<br />
PM: Well Qant as has no chance of being a dominant world business in a part<br />
of the woirld. If you go to Melbourne Airport or Sydney Airport, you will<br />
notice, if you haven't already, all of the other carriers who compete and<br />
bring people in and out of Australia. I mean this is a business which has<br />
had a monopoly in Australia for a century. This is one of those things<br />
nations build once in their history and the thing about Qantas is that<br />
Qantas is just another airline. But worse than that, Qantas was just<br />
another airline that didn't have enough government capital to keep it<br />
running and we put the capital into it. The thing about Telstra is that it<br />
generates its own capital. It is actually a big producer of revenue for the<br />
Budget and that big production of revenue for the Budget would then start<br />
to move off shore, part of it would move off shore or go to Australian<br />
private hands.<br />
J: Mr Howard says that you would sell off Telstra on returning to office after<br />
the election<br />
PM: Mr Hovard has got no right to say that. He knows that and every<br />
Australian commentator knows and the public I am sure knows, that<br />
whenever the Labor Party has agreed to sell any major asset, we have<br />
had a production bigger than Ben Hur. It has gone to each<br />
National Conference for Australian Airlines, for Qantas, for the<br />
Commonwealth Bank and you know our traditional position and what it<br />
has always been. Telecom is simply not for sale.<br />
J: In what time frame?<br />
PM: I've just told you.<br />
J: It is not for sale then?<br />
PM: It is not for sale.<br />
J: Why should the Government be running telecommunications?<br />
PM: Because at the time we had a continent with very few people and we built<br />
a business. And as we have, we built a very profound and good business<br />
and one that is technically very competent. We find ourselves now in the<br />
fastest growing part of the world, which we were never in before at any<br />
other time in our history, where all our markets are here, not in Europe or<br />
north America, and now the phone companies the telecommunication<br />
companies are basically the avenue, the highway upon which the digital<br />
information will flow.<br />
The roll out of the cable is the information highway. The information<br />
highway here, or a very big chunk of it other than Optus, belongs to the<br />
people of Australia. In other words, we have by developing and holding<br />
this business for a century built a great business so it becomes a </p>
<p>strategic national asset. To give it now to foreigners, to let British<br />
Telecom go and get their foot on this or a group of international investors<br />
who would then operate the policy, you know if this thing is sold in a<br />
broadly spread company, anyone holding 35 per cent of the stock or<br />
per cent of the stock is in control.<br />
J: Won't the of Telstra hinder Telstra when the market is deregulated in<br />
1997?<br />
PM: What it will do is do what it has already. What Optus has done under the<br />
Government's communications competition policy ' and that is to lower<br />
phohie tariffs, lifted efficiency. The efficiencies of Telstra have grown<br />
enormously and with it, of course, its revenues. It is a big revenue earner<br />
for the Government and it has enough internally generated funds to fund<br />
a massive capital expansion program. Let me just remind you, it is laying<br />
out the fibre optic cable without any budgetary contributions.<br />
J: Prime Minister, after having sold icons like the Commonwealth Bank and<br />
Qantas, having broken an earlier adopted Telecom?<br />
PM: No, look, that is not true what you have just said. All of the things the<br />
Governo~ ent has done it has done with the big notice, the big public<br />
panopJl'iof coverage of its national conferences, it has been a most public<br />
process. Let me just say about the Commonwealth Bank, the<br />
Commonwealth Bank used to be the Reserve Bank of Australia. It had<br />
the Reserve Bank function. When the R eserve Bank Act came in it was<br />
just another savings bank and then just another trading bank and there<br />
are now three major trading banks and with it four. And, there is a host of<br />
private housing banks out there. So, the Commonwealth Bank had no<br />
special role..<br />
J: But as an icon, surely?<br />
PM: What does the word ' icon' mean? What do you mean an icon?<br />
The Government is not into romanticism, we are into actual utility.<br />
I mean, the Commonwealth Bank when now no longer a central bank,<br />
was just another bank and I might just say that because the Government<br />
successfully sold it here, the last 49 per cent of it was worth more than we<br />
valued it at at the start. So, it was a very successful thing for the people<br />
of Australia and they have got a brand new institution out of it another<br />
premium, first class, well funded, well capitalised bank, It is all the world<br />
of difference to the strategic opportunity of Telstra.<br />
J: Do the Opposition undertakings on community service obligations<br />
address your concerns about foreign ownership?<br />
PM: All that goes, it might stay there a year or two years, but what people in<br />
rural Australia have got to know and people who live with some of the<br />
community some of the cross subsidies within Telstra is once it's in the<br />
hands of a private business, private owners particularly foreign owners<br />
and particularly foreign telephone companies they will operate it like a<br />
business. That is, they will move to all the things that make it like a </p>
<p>business and this question regarding some pledge by the Government to<br />
keep community services obligations, they'll just say to the Government<br />
you want it you pay for it.<br />
J: ( inaudible) which foreigners?<br />
PM: I don't know, I have got no idea where that would end up or what the likely<br />
ownership would be. One thing is for sure, this nation has basically got a<br />
major asset. It has got a major phone company with a huge cash flow<br />
sitting right in the middle of the biggest growth telephone market in the<br />
world and wouldn't we be complete fools to give it to foreigners.<br />
J: The Coalition also plans to review the Government's cross media rules,<br />
the Government may change the rules if re-elected.<br />
PM: Governments maintain the rules, but gradually you are starting to see<br />
John Howard's policy. What he believes in is you can own the television<br />
station and major capital city dailies in the same city. What he calls<br />
reviews are simply ways of moving to take the cross media rules out. So,<br />
we have now got diversity in television ownership, diversity in radio<br />
ownership, diversity in print ownership, that would change. Journalists,<br />
for instance, can go and work for Network Seven or Network Nine or<br />
Network Ten or the ABC or Austereo or Southern Cross or Prime or the<br />
Sydney Morning Herald Fairfax or News Limited, this was not the case<br />
before the Government's policy. And, where journalists can go and get<br />
independent work, there will be independent news and views for the<br />
Australian nation, ie diversity.<br />
J: Mr Howard said this morning that if Mr Carr can change the Governor of<br />
NSW without consulting the people, you could do the same thing on the<br />
Australian flag.<br />
PM: What else would you like to get in to? I mean, play a game of Ludo while<br />
we are at it? Maybe snakes and ladders.<br />
