    <content><![CDATA[<p>Your Excellency,</p>
<p>I present your new ministers and, through you, I present the people of Australia their new government.</p>
<p>We are all conscious of the honour of serving our country as ministers of the Crown and members of your Executive Council.</p>
<p>We pledge ourselves to serve the people of Australia for their benefit to the very best of our ability.</p>
<p>We are determined to honour our commitments: to scrap the carbon tax, to stop the boats, to get the Budget under control, and to build the roads of the 21st century.</p>
<p>We will be a problem-solving government based on values, not ideology.</p>
<p>We will strive to govern for all Australians, including those who didn’t vote for us.</p>
<p>We won’t forget those who are often marginalised: people with disabilities, indigenous people and women struggling to combine career and family.</p>
<p>We will do our best not to leave anyone behind.</p>
<p>We aim to be a calm, measured, steady and purposeful government that says what it means and does what it says.</p>
<p>We hope to be judged by what we have done rather than by what we have said we would do.</p>
<p>We are conscious of the ideals of duty and service exemplified by our Queen whom you have so graciously represented here in Australia.</p>
<p>And we will not spare ourselves; we will not spare ourselves in order to deserve the trust placed in us this day.</p>
