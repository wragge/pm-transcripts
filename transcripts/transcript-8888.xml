SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J7 KEATINGQ MP<br />
TOURISM TASK FORCE LUNCHEON<br />
SYDNEY 11 JUNE 1993<br />
I am very glad to be here today. John Brown's powers or<br />
persuasion are unrivalled 8nd legendary of course, but he<br />
didn't needL. to use them for this.<br />
The modern Australian tourist indust U and I grew up<br />
together, and even in front of John, I will be so<br />
immodest as to say that over the years I have given it<br />
more than one or two helpful shoves along.<br />
The last of these shoves was last year in One Nation when<br />
we created 8 separate Cabinet portfolio for tourism, a<br />
new Department of Tourism and when we significantly<br />
increased funding for promoting Australia as a tourist<br />
destination. This was less a visionary act than recognition of 8<br />
vision realised, because the tourism industry really had<br />
earned its stripes.<br />
I'm fond of reminding people how much Australians have<br />
changed in the past decade and a half. It seems to me<br />
that the changes we have made are proof of our capacity<br />
to make more changes necessary changes.<br />
The change from an inward looking, even somewhat<br />
xenophobic Anglo-saxon society to a much more worldly,<br />
open and multicultural society is one example. The<br />
remarkably rapid adoption of a co-operative industrial<br />
culture is another. So is, in very recent times, our<br />
reorientation towards Asia.<br />
Australians do have the capacity to adapt as the world<br />
and our place in it demands. This, of course, is the<br />
reason why I am confident that in time we will embrace<br />
the Idea of a re publican Australia and why we will<br />
achieve reconciliation with indigenous Australians.<br />
It's why I think that we can find a successful and<br />
creative role in the world and the region, and a greater<br />
level of mature self-confidence and self-esteem. In the<br />
end these things depend on ourselves and on our faith in<br />
ourselives. </p>
<p>TEL: 2<br />
Now, the other striking example of our ability to adapt<br />
and grow and make the most of our natural advantages is<br />
the tourism industry. A decade ago it was at best<br />
embryonic. Very few Australians imagined that we were<br />
capable of developing the sophisticated standards of<br />
service and infrastructure which we now possess.<br />
It has happened with quite extraordinary speed and we<br />
should find in it every reason for confidence, both in<br />
the future of the tourism industry and the future of the<br />
country. As I'm sure you know, tourism has become a very<br />
significant source of export earnings and job creation in<br />
Australia. It Is our fastest growing industry. It<br />
employs 457,000 people and earns us $ 8 billion in foreign<br />
exchange a year. It will create 200,000 new jobs in this<br />
decade, an4j4n so doing provide a future for 8 very large<br />
number of yj~ ntis Australians.<br />
The news is remarkably good. Studies by the Australian<br />
Tourist Comm ission indicate that we are already first or<br />
bcond most preferred destination in eight out of<br />
thirteen key market countries.<br />
A recent New York Times/ CBS Televis√± bn survey listed<br />
Australia as the most favoured tourist destination for<br />
Americans. Australia rated three times more popular than<br />
France, Italy or Britain.<br />
And new survey results which I'm pleased to release today<br />
show that Americans' satisfaction with Australia as a<br />
tourist destination is not only in the anticipation but<br />
also in the fulfilment of their holiday dreams. An<br />
Australian Tourist Commission satisfaction study of the<br />
US market found that three out of four American holiday<br />
makers rate Australia better than any iff ternational<br />
destination they have visited.<br />
An overwhelming 98 per cent of those Surveyed said they<br />
would recommend Australia to friends and relatives.<br />
The survey also found that Australia scored brilliantly<br />
on a wide range of criteria including hotels, tourist<br />
attractions, food and service standards, and<br />
friendliness. it's one of the pleasures of this job that you get to<br />
tell the good news. Here it is.<br />
98 per cent of Americans were very satisfied with<br />
the quality of our tourist attractions.<br />
97 per cent were very satisfied with the<br />
friendliness and helpfulness of Australians.<br />
97 were very satisfied with the quality of our<br />
hotels, staff, service standards and tour guides.<br />

95 per Cent rated Australia as a good or excellent<br />
country to visit for a holiday.<br />
96 per cent said their trip met or exceeded their<br />
expectations. And 89 per cent said they intended to return to<br />
Australia.<br />
You don't get much better product endorsement than that.<br />
Nevertheless, it's very important that we do not<br />
exaggerate the prospects for the Australian tourism<br />
industry or underestimate the issues facing it.<br />
it's not money for jam but a very complex industry often<br />
confronted . b. y problems beyond our control. The success<br />
of tourism relies on the right policy mix in regard to<br />
marketing, transport, immnigration, investment and<br />
infrastructure, training, taxation arrangements,<br />
international relations, Cultural identity and industrial<br />
relations. The Government is determined to help the<br />
industry overcome impediments to growth in all these<br />
areas. During the election campaign, I gave an undertaking to<br />
continue the conspicuous level of support given to the<br />
industry which in the recent pest has included an extra<br />
million in One Nation for tourist promotion,<br />
additional resources for the new Department of Tourism,<br />
improved depreciation arrangements, and a further<br />
liberalisation of aviation policy.<br />
The new commitments include $ 42 million over the next<br />
four years for the development and planning of tourism in<br />
regional Australia; the completion of the -nat ional<br />
ecotourism strategy and associated programs, and to<br />
promote growth in special interest areas such as rural<br />
tourism, coastal cruising and backpacking.<br />
We also want to help the industry plan more accurately<br />
for future infrastructure needs.<br />
, The tourism industry has been plagued by boom-bust<br />
cycles. The investment boom in accommodation in the<br />
mid-eighties has resulted in an over-supply of rooms, a<br />
decline in profitability, and a significant number of<br />
hotels ending up; in the hands of bankers.<br />
However there are signs that unless new investment is<br />
forthcoming, the current surplus of accommodation may<br />
become a severe deficit, at least in some regions.<br />
we are stimulating tourism demand through international<br />
marketing combined with major reforms in the aviation<br />
industry. </p>
<p>TEL: 11. Jun. 93 13: 37 No. 010 P. 04/ 06<br />

But the lead times involved in the development of<br />
infrastructure mean that we have to anticipate this<br />
demand three to four years in advance.<br />
Investment in tourism therefore crucially depends on our<br />
ability to forecast trends. At present, there is a lack<br />
of agreement within the industry on the credibility of<br />
particular tourism forecasts, and the reluctance to use<br />
these forecasts has confused planning decisions and<br />
contributed to the current low rates of occupancy and<br />
lack of new investment.<br />
To provide much better quality information on which<br />
investment decisions are made, we will establish a<br />
Tourism Forecasting Council.<br />
The Council will report to the minister and comprise key<br />
tourism indpstry, finance and building representatives<br />
with technical assistance from the Bureau of Tourism<br />
Research, industry research organisations and government<br />
agencies. The Council will perform a role somewh~ at like the<br />
indicative Planning Council of the housing industry,<br />
where the industry, the government and other interested<br />
parties sit down a couple of times a year to make an<br />
annual forecast of housing growth. These forecasts are<br />
generally taken by the industry as the best guide to its<br />
immediate future. In the same way, a tourism forecasting<br />
council should provide that extra information which can<br />
induce more confidence about the future and hence more<br />
confidence to underpin investment decisions.<br />
By means of a Council, it is hoped that we will be able<br />
to smooth out boom-bust cycles by better matching supply<br />
and demand and improving industry planning and<br />
profitability. The survey of the American market which turned up such<br />
wonderfully positive responses nevertheless highlighted<br />
some problem areas.<br />
The one that concerns us most was the finding that<br />
American travel agents appear to underestimate what<br />
Australia has to offer as a tourist destination.<br />
It appears that we need to put more emphasis on<br />
post-advertising marketing strategies which will convince<br />
these 35,000 travel agents to convert American enthusiasm<br />
for Australia into firm holiday bookings.<br />
This is an Issue which I know Michael Lee plans to<br />
concertedly address in the coming months.<br />
You will be aware, I imagine, of the emphasis I have<br />
placed on " partnership" in developing a more cohesive,<br />
stronger and competitive Australia. It was the theme of<br />
One Nation. And despite the hiccup on another matter in<br />

recent days, I am not at all deterred from continuing to<br />
pursue it, particularly in relation to the Commonwealth<br />
and the States and Territories.<br />
The tourism Industry especially needs a spirit and a<br />
framework of partnership and co-operation.<br />
We need to break down the old artificial demarcation<br />
between State trade development and Commonwealth consumer<br />
market promotion.<br />
By providing an opportunity to work co-operatively<br />
towards a common goal, the concept of Partnership<br />
Australia will enable us to be both more efficient and<br />
more cost-effective.<br />
What we need Is a united effort to promote the Idea of<br />
" Destination Australia", not just " Destination New South<br />
wales" or Otlestination Queensland".<br />
I was very pleased to see that the Northern Territory has<br />
recently decided to join Partnership Australia and will<br />
be allocating a percentage of its total marketing budget<br />
to co-operative ventures and tactical'marketing<br />
opportunities. The maximum effectiveness of our integrated marketing<br />
ef forts overseas can be achieved only with the<br />
participation of all States and Territories in<br />
Partnership Australia.<br />
And I sincerely hope the other State Tourist Commissions<br />
will respond positively to the ATC's efforts to co-opt<br />
their support.<br />
The Commonwealth Government has worked to reduce the<br />
barriers to tourist growth through liberalising aviation<br />
policy, providing additional resources for policy<br />
development, through the taxation system, through the<br />
promotion of flexible industrial relations and through<br />
the provision of more and better training.<br />
If we can resolve to work more closely together, we can<br />
build on what we have already achieved and maximise the<br />
potential we know exists.<br />
The beneficiaries, in no particular order, will be<br />
Australia and you the industry. Partnership Australia<br />
offers a better means of handling enquiries and<br />
distributing product information. It will Improve the<br />
effectiveness of our marketing effort. It will mean that<br />
we can offer to the world a total and unambiguous<br />
Australian product not the bits but the whole show.<br />
So I urge you all to assist our efforts to persuade the<br />
states and Territories to commit to PartnershiP Australia<br />
and " Destination Australia". </p>

I said at the beginning that nothing confirms my faith in<br />
Australia's future so much as the changes we have made in<br />
the recent past. I said that there is no better example<br />
of this then the tourism industry. However, I know that<br />
the people here would be the last to say that we can rest<br />
on our laurels.<br />
I can give you now an absolute assurance that the<br />
Commonwealth Government will continue to support the<br />
tourism industry in every way that we can and in<br />
Michael Lee you will find you have a very responsive<br />
Minister with great energy, ideas Bad skill.<br />
The Commonwealth Government will give you this. What we<br />
seek from you is nothing more than a continuing<br />
commitment to work with us and with each other in the<br />
interests of the industry and Australia.<br />
And knowinfthat you have come so far along this road in<br />
the last decade, I have no doubt that that is what we are<br />
going to see as never before in the next decade. A<br />
partnership which will make the industry and Australia<br />
that much stronger.<br />
I wish you all the best in your efforts and thank you<br />
again for inviting me here. </p>
