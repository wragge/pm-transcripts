TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
PRESS CONFERENCE, IMPERIAL HOTEL, TOKYO, JAPAN<br />
6 SEPTEMBER 1994<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
PMV: I thought It might be useful to give you an impression of the meeting I<br />
had this morning with Minister Hashimoto, I have been quite friendly<br />
with Minister Hashimoto now-for many years when he was Finance<br />
Minister and we have corresponded at various times over the years<br />
since and I am delighted that he has come back Into the government<br />
as the Minister for International Trade and Industry. This Is a country<br />
which takes a quarter of all we export and It's our largest trading<br />
partner, and having, well certainly, an associate a relatively a close<br />
associate in the job here makes things somewhat easier for me.<br />
We had a very good discussion today about the international scene<br />
In general and about APEC in particular. And, as you know, Japan<br />
was one of the founding forces of APEC and with Prime Minister<br />
Miyazawa and MITI back a couple of years ago. They played a very<br />
significant role getting the change in APEC from an informationsharing<br />
secretariat to a leaders body, a heads of government body,<br />
and to be able to give it a greater role in trade facilitation and<br />
liberalisation. So today we had a talk about this and about the<br />
importance of the Leader's Meeting in Bogor which will require and<br />
this is a very large undertaking that is going to require a lot of<br />
spadework over a period, and a lot of dialogue and a lot of<br />
discussions but, I think I say today that our discussions were very<br />
positive and, as you know Minister Hashimoto particularly from the G-<br />
7 Meeting, you know that he is a very strong advocate of free trade<br />
and we have shared views on the need for free trade In the region,<br />
and we agreed on the need to make the Bogor Meeting a success. I<br />
think they are very conscious of the fact the that there is a great<br />
opportunity here with President Soehartoe's leadership.<br />
This is a quite unusual circumstance where the leader of a<br />
developing country and a large one representing developing<br />
countries In ASEAN are, in a sense, providing the lead, to a very<br />
substantial International undertaking In trade. In the past we have </p>
<p>expected these things to come from the developed countries and the<br />
G-71 this is In a sense coming the other way it's coming from<br />
developing countries, and I think that Japan understands and values<br />
this. But, of course, I'm looking forward to the meeting with Prime<br />
Minister Murayama later in the day, and it Is after that that I can<br />
say.. give you an Impression where I think Japan Is standing on some<br />
of the issues coming up to APEC and some other issues as well.<br />
J: Prime Minister, do you believe that the 2020 target set out by the<br />
Eminent Persons Group, do you believe that target is ambitious<br />
enough? Do you think it should be improved upon?<br />
PMV: Well,' the Eminent Persons Group Report Is an Indication of the<br />
direction, I think, which leads to things because all the people on it<br />
are private people who have come back to their respective<br />
governments and, in a sense, what you have Is the sort of, well, both<br />
a coalescence in the EPG Report and, I think and a bit of a a<br />
compromise. The leaders will do something else again, and I think<br />
the strength of the Seattle meeting was that the Leaders met without<br />
officials, and they decided where they want to kick the baill<br />
themselves. So, In a sense, the EPG process is useful in fleshing out<br />
the Initiatives and trying different issues on different constituencies<br />
within APEC, and trying to see how far that can be generally agreed.-<br />
it's then really up to the Leaders to see what they do with it. So, the<br />
EPG report took us in the right directions, but I think the Leaders will<br />
give that more precise expression.<br />
J: From an Australian. own point of view, would you like to see a more<br />
ambitious target?<br />
PM: Well, what I want to see Is something which Is generally agreed. I<br />
mean, In terms of industrial protection, Australia can make these<br />
targets much earlier.. ( inaudible). But, we want to see this be a<br />
discussion not simply about tariffs, but about services and non-tariff<br />
barriers as well. It Is not simply a matter about, you know, target by a<br />
certain date. I mean, I think everyone understands the value of ths,<br />
that Is all the participants, and they're thinking hard about what they<br />
can contribute at Bogor.<br />
J: The Malaysians have been lobbying hard over the last few days<br />
Deputy* Prime Minister Ibrahim has been here trying to push EAEC<br />
along. Are you concerned about this competition with the Malaysian<br />
proposal?<br />
PM: Look, I didn't mention the EAEC. I mean, APEC is the main event<br />
and the one that matters. Why should I bother with the EAEC,<br />
particularly, I mean, in terms, you know, the notion you put which is<br />
some sort of competitive thing. </p>
<p>3<br />
J: Prime Minister, last week senior Japanese Foreign Ministry officials<br />
were Indicating that because GATT wasn't even through the DIET<br />
here yet, In their words " the bruising hadn't healed from GATT", it<br />
wasn't time yet for Japan to start on another free trade round. Did<br />
you get any signs of that this morning?<br />
PM: No, and in fact Japan played a very positive role at the Naples<br />
meeting so, I don't think you can assume that is right. I mean, look at<br />
what they did at the G-7, and what they did there was really argue for,<br />
you know, further liberalisation. All countries will have their pressure<br />
points in pushing the GATT Round through, but the GATT Round was<br />
Important for the fact that it did advance the process of trade and<br />
lower levels of protection and to facilitate investment in sectors which<br />
were formerly off-limits. So, every country that signed up to Uruguay<br />
will have this during the ratification process. But it's done and we<br />
expect it to be ratified.<br />
J: What was Minister Hashimoto's view about the fixing of the firm date<br />
at Bogor?<br />
PM: Well, we didn't go into specific dates. Only to say that one of the<br />
clear objectives of Bogor will be to talk about free trade, you know,<br />
within certain time frames. But these are matters I want to discuss<br />
more fulsomely with the Prime Minister.<br />
J: What was his general sort of response though to a more agressive<br />
push?<br />
PM: Japan has been right on board the APEC bus from day one. Prime<br />
Minister Miyazawa, as I said earlier, MITI and the Galmusho ( MFA), I<br />
mean, it was important in getting support for the Leaders Meeting in<br />
the first place, and for the objectives which Prime Minister Hosikawa<br />
helped push through, and the work program at the Seattle meeting.<br />
So, you have got to see Japan as basically a positive player in this.<br />
J: Prime Minister, what's changed? You said on Friday that Japan now<br />
is more enthusiastic about APEC as a vehicle for trade liberalisation<br />
what evidence do you have for that?<br />
PM: Well, I think that Japan... I mean, a view was put to me a few years<br />
ago that in terms of APEC and any liberalised trade, that Japan would<br />
be the first beneficiary. And I think that is right, and I think Japan<br />
sees that too. I mean opening up East-Asia and North-Asia to<br />
products and multi-lateralising the interests of the United States in<br />
Asia, multi-lateralising with China, is something which must naturally<br />
fall to Japan's advantage. </p>
<p>-4<br />
J, Mr Keating, what's the difficulty In trying to manage the Japanese<br />
desire to MFN, and the American desire to do everything more<br />
unilaterally.. ( inaudible)..?<br />
PM: Well, I don't see that certainly with Bogor. I mean I think the<br />
likelihood is there that there will be a further meeting, and I should be<br />
pleased if the next Leaders Meeting was actually held concurrent<br />
with a Ministerial meeting In Japan. And, I think, once there are<br />
generally agreed principles at Bogor, I think, it Is then a cme of<br />
bringing In the ministries for some of the, sort of, beauracratic weight<br />
to try and solve some of the other problems. I think this is where the<br />
leaders can provide the value, I mean to kick the thing along. There<br />
are then plenty of agencies to sort of scrabble over the details.<br />
J: But they're fairly important details?<br />
PM: Oh yes, sure. But It's not so important that, I think, anyone is going to<br />
let the thing go.<br />
J: Do you think they are prepared to sign off without actually knowing<br />
how they..<br />
PM: Well, I can't say that without speaking to the Prime Minister.<br />
J: Mr Keating, on the wider level the issue of Japan's international<br />
role, typified by questions such as its membership of the Security<br />
Council. Previously Australia has stated it supported Japan<br />
becoming a permanent member. What Is Australia's position on that<br />
now, and also extending that to the peace-keeping question?<br />
PMV: Well, our position remains the same. I mean, we think Japan can<br />
play.. . it's the second-largest economy in the world, it's a large<br />
country, It's a major player In the world we think Japan can be a very<br />
positive force In the Security Council. That's always been our view,<br />
and remains our view.<br />
J: When My Murayama became the Prime Minister, he announced a<br />
freeze on their bid for Security Council membership, and there seems<br />
to be some tensions between his Socialist Party and more<br />
nationalistic ( inaudible) Is that a problem for Australia, evaluating<br />
that?<br />
PM: None of this is a problem for Australia. It's about where we see vis a<br />
vis Japan and the Security Council issue. I mean, we see ourselves<br />
as being essentially supportive of this. And I think that, you know, the<br />
coalition., has, despite the predictions of the pundits, is getting some<br />
real standing and potential longevity, and the decisions by the Prime<br />
Minister's party over the last weekend In some of these major issues<br />
such as the US Alliance etc, nuclear power Is clearing away a lot of </p>
<p>P<br />
the Inhibitions for his party the Socialist Party to participate more<br />
fulsomely In Japanese politics and Japanese policies. This, I think, Is<br />
a very good sign. Now, in this clearing away of issues, probably one<br />
of the issues which the Prime Minister will clear his mind on Is this<br />
question about the Security Council. Now, It would fit very much in<br />
with the constellation of Issues which his Party discussed last<br />
weekend.<br />
J: Mr Keating, did you discuss bilateral issues as well this morning with<br />
Mr Hashimoto?<br />
PM: No, no. Because I think we both understand that Mr Hashimoto<br />
visited Australia a few times, I mean, he knows where we stand. He<br />
knows about the clearly about the weight of our trade, our<br />
importance to Japan as a raw material supplier and now unilaterally<br />
as a supplier of food and high technology products. They know about<br />
Australia's economic performance, and you know, in the time I have<br />
with him, we want to concentrate, I think, on International issues.<br />
J: At the South Pacific Forum you had some fairly strong things to say<br />
about some Asian resource companies In the forestry and fishing<br />
areas exploiting Pacific Island nations. As the Chairman of the<br />
Forum this year, how strongly are you pas-sing those concerns you<br />
articulated on in Brisbane onto Japanese in terms of their<br />
companies?<br />
PM: Well, forth-rightly. And when I get a chance to tell the Prime Minister<br />
I think it Is part of my role as Chairman for the year, of the South<br />
Pacific Forum, to actually transmit some of those messages. And,<br />
you know, frankly I think that a mature Industrial state like Japan will<br />
understand where the message has come from and why they have<br />
come. But again, I look forward to taking that up at my meetings this<br />
afternoon and with my meeting with the Prime Minister.<br />
ends. </p>
