UNIVERSITIES ( FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE) BILL 1965<br />
Second Reading Speech by the Prime Minister,<br />
the Rt. Hon. Sir Robert Menzies, M. P.<br />
House of Representatives 18th November, 1965<br />
This is the third occasion on which the Government has<br />
proposed amendments to the Universities ( Financial Assistance)<br />
Act in order to provide additional funds for State universities<br />
during the 1964-1966 triennium. With this Bill we are recommending<br />
Commonwealth grants for capital works at medical teaching<br />
hospitals of œ 1,555,850 and further grants of œ 184,900 for the<br />
recurrent costs of those hospitals which are directly attributable<br />
to the instruction of undergraduate students in teaching hospitals.<br />
This sum of œ 1,740,750 will raise the total amount of Commonwealth<br />
financial assistance to State universities during the present<br />
triennium to approximately œ 73million. In addition the Commonwealth<br />
will find œ 24million for the Australian National Univ~ ersity.<br />
The Government provided grants for certain capital<br />
projects at medical teaching hospitals during the 1961-1963<br />
triennium. Earlier this year the second report of the Universities<br />
Commission's Committee on the Teaching Costs of Medical Hospitals<br />
became available. It recommended further capital grants and, in<br />
addition, assistance with some elements of the recurrent costs of<br />
medical teaching hospitals.<br />
I remind Honourable Members that the Government's<br />
decisions on that report were announced on 5th August last during<br />
the Parliamentary recess. The report itself was tabled in both<br />
Houses on 24th August.<br />
The Government did not accept all the recommendations<br />
of the Committee, but did agree to support, pound for pound, such<br />
of the capital projects recommended by the Committee for various<br />
medical teaching hospitals as the States thought could be completed,<br />
or nearly completed, by 31st December, 1966, the end of the<br />
present triennium. We also agreed to support from 1st July, 1965,<br />
on the usual œ 1 to œ 1.85 basis, certain items of the recurrent<br />
costs of teaching hospitals which are directly attributable to the<br />
clinical teaching of undergraduate medical students. The items<br />
with which we will assist are:-<br />
* The cost of the administration concerned solely with<br />
the planning, organization and supervision of teaching<br />
programmes within the hospital.<br />
* Maintenance and service costs of the areas and of<br />
activities used by clinical students and university<br />
staff.<br />
* The costs of providing books and periodicals for<br />
undergraduate students in teaching hospital libraries.<br />
Particulars of the grants to individual universities<br />
with teaching hospitals are set out in the schedules to the Bill.<br />
As the Bill provides only for those capital projects<br />
which the States have indicated can be completed or nearly<br />
completed by 31st December, 1966, there are several variations<br />
from the amounts recommended in the Report of the Committee on<br />
Teaching Costs of Medical Hospitals. I would emphasise that<br />
these variations have been made on the basis of information<br />
received from each State after each had been told of the </p>
<p>4 2.<br />
Commonwealth's willingness to support the whole of' the programme<br />
recommended by the Committee subject to each State's views on<br />
what it would be practicable to construct in the time available.<br />
I have little doubt that subject to changes because of revised<br />
priorities, the teaching hospital projects now deleted will find<br />
places in the 1967-1969 programme. This, however, is a matter<br />
for decisions which will be taken on the recommendations yet to<br />
be made by the Universities Commission for the 1967-1969 triennium.<br />
So far as the recurrent grants are concerned, owr share<br />
of the cost of the items accepted for grant purposes will be a<br />
maximum of œ 184,900 for the period 1st July, 1965, to 31st<br />
December, 1966, of which up to œ, 123,000 will be required during<br />
this financial year 1965/ 66. The allocation of this sum among the<br />
States concerned is set out in the Sixth Schedule.<br />
But I wish to emphasise that the amounts for recurrent<br />
grants listed in that Schedule are, in each case, maximum amounts<br />
so far as the Commonwealth is concerned and are payable only on<br />
certification by the States to the satisfaction of the Minister<br />
that the amounts claimed have been legitimately incurred in<br />
respect of the three elements of cost approved by the Commonwealth<br />
and are within the limits of the sums set out in Table 7 of the<br />
Committee's report for those elements of cost. These amounts are<br />
provided on the basis of estimates by the Committee only and I<br />
emphasise that the Commonwealth Minister will need to be satisfied<br />
that the amounts claimed in respect of the various elements of<br />
recurrent expenditure are reasonable. The amounts set down in<br />
the Schedule are not to be regarded as an automatic entitlement.<br />
Honourable Members will note the Repatriation General<br />
Hospital, Concord, among the capital works in the Fifth Schedule<br />
to the Bill. Provision has been made for Concord also in the<br />
recurrent expenses of the University of Sydney in the Sixth<br />
Schedule. For many years Concord has served as a teaching hospital<br />
for the University of Sydney and the Commonwealth has met all the<br />
costs incurred. However, under the new arrangements universities<br />
will accept responsibility for certain capital and recurrent costs<br />
directly attributable to teaching, and it is appropriate therefore<br />
that the Commonwealth and State Governments shall share<br />
responsibility for those costs at Concord just as they will for<br />
State teaching hospitals.<br />
This Bill also provides for a minor amendment to the main<br />
Act to allow the University of Melbourne to attract a Commonwealth<br />
capital grant of œ 15,000 for an animal breeding unit which it<br />
wishes to build at Werribee instead of Mt. flerrimut where it was<br />
originally intended to be and which is the location given to it<br />
in the Principal Act. The change has been approved by the<br />
Universities Commission. Funds are not affected.<br />
I commend the Bill to the House. </p>
