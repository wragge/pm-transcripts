    <content><![CDATA[<p><strong>PRESIDENT TRUMP:</strong></p>
<p>Thank you very much, it’s an honour to have Prime Minister Turnbull, Mrs Turnbull, friends of mine and friends of Melania for actually for some time. The relationship we have with Australia is a terrific relationship and probably stronger now than ever before.</p>
<p>It’s a principal relationship our friendship but we’re working on trade deals. We’re working on military and protection and all the things you would think we would be discussing today. We have a big meeting set up in a little while, we have a luncheon set up also and we have all of our representatives surrounding us and a lot of good things will come out of this visit. So Mr Prime Minister, I very much appreciate you being here.</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong></p>
<p>Thank you, and I just say thank you to you and Melania for your hospitality and your friendship. It’s 100 years of mateship that we’re celebrating mateship, 100 years ago for the first time Australians and American soldiers went into battle together on July 4, 1918 and we have been fighting side by side in freedom’s cause ever since. So 100 years of mateship and 100 more to come.</p>
<p><strong>PRESIDENT TRUMP:</strong></p>
<p>Thank you all very much.</p>
