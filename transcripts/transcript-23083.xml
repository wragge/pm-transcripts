    <content><![CDATA[<p>Bapak Vice President, Professors, Excellencies.</p>
<p>It is an honour for me to be here in the presence of the Vice President to formally launch this important venture.</p>
<p>As all of us know, not least the Vice President, there have been many Indonesians come to Australia to study over the years.</p>
<p>I am determined to ensure that there are more Australians going to Indonesia to study.</p>
<p>As time goes by, I would like to see more Indonesian tourists in Australia and more Australian students in Indonesia.</p>
<p>I would like to see more complementarity in our relationship as time goes by.</p>
<p>This new centre is an important way to deepen the academic and cultural exchange between our two countries.</p>
<p>It is an important way to deepen the mutual understanding between our two countries.</p>
<p>This is vitally important for the future of our two countries. Certainly, it is vitally important for Australia.</p>
<p>Indonesia is a very, very important relationship – in the broad, probably Australia’s single most important relationship by virtue of Indonesia’s size, proximity and massive potential to be not just a superpower of Asia, but a democratic superpower of Asia.</p>
<p>So, I think this is an important development for both our countries.</p>
<p>I am very honoured to be involved in this with my friend, Bapak Vice President, who has had such a deep personal experience of education here in Australia.</p>
