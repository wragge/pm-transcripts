    <content><![CDATA[<p><strong>STAV: </strong></p>
<p>Prime Minister, Malcolm Turnbull, good morning.</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER: </strong></p>
<p>Good morning, great to be with you.</p>
<p><strong>ABBY: </strong></p>
<p>That was an exciting day yesterday!</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER: </strong></p>
<p>Oh, wow, wasn’t it! Wasn’t it just such a wonderful statement of respect and love and commitment and a huge majority for marriage equality.</p>
<p><strong>STAV: </strong></p>
<p>I guess another side for you as well because you have had to talk to a lot of other leaders, putting us on the world map because I think we were seen as a bit behind on a global scale for it – would you say?</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER: </strong></p>
<p>There were a lot of countries that have made same-sex marriage legal ahead of us, particularly in the English speaking world.</p>
<p>But, you know, we’ve done this in a very, very democratic way - what an enormous affirmation. A huge vote – 80 per cent participation and then a massive majority. So I think this was a great exercise in Australian democracy and a great demonstration of our commitment to a fair go.</p>
<p><strong>ABBY:</strong></p>
<p>What happens now? What is the time limit, because I know you guys are finishing Parliament, I think maybe on the 6th or the 8th of December? So what is the earliest possible day that people can get married?</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER: </strong></p>
<p>Well, Parliament can sit longer.</p>
<p><strong>ABBY: </strong></p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER: </strong></p>
<p>I mean, we can obviously change our sitting days. I think we’re all committed to getting this done before Christmas and as I’ve said elsewhere, you know, it’s a fascinating subject but I don’t think anyone wants to be debating it, here on Christmas Eve.</p>
<p><strong>ABBY: </strong></p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER: </strong></p>
<p>So the debate starts in the Senate this morning on the Bill, it was introduced yesterday, so no time was wasted there. The Senate will continue it, debate amendments, you know, which will either get up or not in the week of the 27th of November, and then the following week it will come down to the House of Representatives.</p>
<p>So look, I’m very, very confident this will all be done before Christmas.</p>
<p><strong>MATT: </strong></p>
<p>And what about all this talk about legislation of if a baker doesn’t want to bake a cake for gay people, what’s going to happen with all of that?</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER: </strong></p>
<p>Well I don’t believe anyone will move an amendment of that kind. And I certainly wouldn’t support it and I don’t think anyone else would or hardly anyone else would.</p>
<p>This is all about reducing discrimination and recording respect, equal respect and recognition to committed relationships between gay couples. So, I think that’s what this is all about.</p>
<p><strong>ABBY:</strong></p>
<p>I have to learn some new lines, because I’m a civil celebrant and we always have to learn saying “marriage is between a man and woman to the exclusion of all others.”</p>
<p><strong>MATT: </strong></p>
<p>All?</p>
<p><strong>ABBY:</strong></p>
<p>So now I have to change the wording. I look forward to finding out what it is.</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong></p>
<p>Well you’ll no doubt be in demand for more weddings after this is all legislated through the Parliament.</p>
<p><strong>STAV: </strong></p>
<p>Yes, you will Abs, you’ll be busy.</p>
<p><strong>ABBY:</strong></p>
<p>Yes I promised so many friends of mine Malcolm, I’m so nervous. I can’t afford all these weddings that I’m going to be going to.</p>
<p>[Laughter]</p>
<p><strong>MATT: </strong></p>
<p>Not to mention, now you’re going to have to add ‘straight’ onto the end of LGBTQITRTYTZTXXX whatever it is.</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong></p>
<p>I never, you know, I have never got my head around that extraordinary acronym you know. So many letters, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>MATT: </strong></p>
<p>Because we’re all people Malcolm, that’s why.</p>
<p><strong>ABBY:</strong></p>
<p>Why don’t we just do ‘people’?</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong></p>
<p>No, no, I know, but it’s getting so long.</p>
<p><strong>ABBY:</strong></p>
<p>Yes!</p>
<p><strong>MATT: </strong></p>
<p>Yes, I’m with you mate, I’m with you. Well, you know I also want to say too, a lot of people, and I only changed my mind on this overnight last night, with the money that was spent on the plebiscite – when I sat down and thought about it, I actually think it’s great what you’ve done there with it Malcolm. Because –</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong></p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>MATT: </strong></p>
<p>Because if it had gone to Parliament, I feel like it wouldn’t have passed.</p>
<p><strong>ABBY:</strong></p>
<p>It would have been rejected, yep.</p>
<p><strong>HOST: </strong></p>
<p>And I think by you sticking your neck out, spending the money, it’s put it out there that people have said ‘yes’. So people who are voting ‘no’ in the Parliament now, have to rethink it, because their people in their electorate have said: “This is what we want”.</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER: </strong></p>
<p>Yeah look, it is a divisive social issue and people have different, really strongly held views, which we must respect, as I said right through the debate. If you want your view on this to be respected, you’ve got to respect the other person’s view and so everyone had their say.</p>
<p>Every single Australian, 80 per cent took up that opportunity which is a massive participation. Everyone has been heard. The vote is overwhelmingly in favour of legalising same-sex marriage. So that’s, the message is: “Okay, members of Parliament and senators, you’ve heard our message, now get on with it and get it done”. Now that’s up to us.</p>
<p>You know, we work for you. You are our bosses, so we have to get on and do the job.</p>
<p><strong>MATT: </strong></p>
<p>Cool, can I have a coffee?</p>
<p>[Laughter]</p>
<p><strong>STAV: </strong></p>
<p>Nope.</p>
<p><strong>ABBY:</strong></p>
<p>It is a busy day man, he’s got a busy day.</p>
<p><strong>MATT: </strong></p>
<p>I’m not a citizen, wrong person to ask.</p>
<p><strong>ABBY:</strong></p>
<p>Try and enjoy the debates –</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong></p>
<p>Oh no, you’re not a citizen? Don’t run for Parliament.</p>
<p>[Laughter]</p>
<p><strong>ABBY:</strong></p>
<p>Good point.</p>
<p><strong>MATT: </strong></p>
<p>We have to let you go, but last question before we get out. Will we see many Liberal Party members at Mardi Gras in leathers and nipple-pasties dancing?</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong></p>
<p>Well you never know. You never know, it is a broad church as John Howard always said.</p>
<p><strong>ABBY:</strong></p>
<p>Yes, thank you so much Malcom Turnbull.</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong></p>
<p>Thanks a lot.</p>
