RURAL CREDIT<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, Mr. Harold Holt<br />
The Prime Minister announced tonight that as<br />
foreshadowed in his statement to the House of Representatives<br />
on 8th March he, the Minister for Trade and Industry and the<br />
Treasurer heid discussions today with the General Managers of<br />
the major trading banks and the Governor of the Reserve Bank on<br />
proposals for new and extended farm loan facilities.<br />
The main proposals put forward by the Government<br />
were That a new system of Farm Loan Funds should be<br />
established for the financing of farm development.<br />
There would be an initial transfer of $ 50 million<br />
to these Funds, part from Statutory Reserve<br />
Deposits of the trading banks with the Reserve Bank<br />
and part from the resources of the trading banks<br />
as uider the existing Term Loan scheme. The<br />
purposesof the Farm Loan Funds would be to provide<br />
loans on longer terms than are now available under<br />
the Term Loan Scheme for development of both new and<br />
existing rural properties and loans for drought<br />
rehabilitation and mitigation measures and the<br />
gcneral enhancement of farm productivity;<br />
That the existint Term Loan Funds would be increased<br />
by a transfer oT 20 million part from the Statutory<br />
Reserve Deposits and part from trading bank funds.<br />

previously, for periods generally of three<br />
to eight years and that over a period, much the<br />
same proportion of the term Loan Funds would be<br />
used or rural purposes as hitherto;<br />
That trading banks lending on overdraft to rural<br />
borrowers would not be di ed on account of the<br />
new arrangements which would thus represent a net<br />
addition To the finance available for rural purposes;<br />
That releases from the Statutory Reserve Deposits of<br />
the trading banks for the above purposes should be<br />
without prejudice to the normal administration of<br />
the S. R. D. system from time to time for liquidity<br />
purposes. It was proposed that the rates of interest on loans<br />
from the new Farm Loan Funds would maintain the preference<br />
already extended to primary producers and would fall within the<br />
range of rates currently charged to primary producers on<br />
overdraft loans. Representatives of the trading banks expressed<br />
themselves as being generally in full agreement with these<br />
proposals. Further discussion on details will, however be<br />
held between the Reserve Bank and the trading banks. It is<br />
expected that announcement of full details of the new arrangements<br />
as agreed will be made at an early date. ./ 2 </p>

Mr. Holt added that he regarded the outcome as<br />
a very successful result and entirely in keeping with the<br />
objectives he had announced in the H-buse on this matter as<br />
representing Government policy. Members of the Government<br />
are very appreciative of the helpful _ and constructive<br />
contribution representatives of the banks made to the<br />
discussion.<br />
