I am pleased to announce two important Australian initiatives to assist international efforts to combat HIV/AIDS in Commonwealth countries in Africa and the Asia â€“ Pacific region.<br />
Out of a $200 million global commitment to HIV/AIDS programmes already announced by the government, I can announce today that Australia will commit $100 million over the next five years to directly assist Asia-Pacific members of the Commonwealth to address this devastating health problem.<br />
Support will be provided for a range of prevention and care strategies, community support, and clinical and medical services. Within this, Australia will provide support, if requested, for applied research or specific trials to help governments assess new HIV/AIDS treatments. Australia will also, if requested, assist Asia-Pacific Commonwealth governments to draft legislation designed to secure affordable HIV/AIDS drugs. Legislation would be consistent with international trade agreements.<br />
Over and above the $200 million global commitment, Australia will provide $11.5 million over four years to assist African members of the Commonwealth to reduce infection rates and the impact of HIV/AIDS, by using Australian expertise in this field. Of this, $10 million will go to community-based projects identified by Australian Non Government Organisations. $1.5 million will go towards a scholarships program to train African health workers to develop and implement strategies for reducing HIV/AIDS.<br />
 By the end of 2001 more than 28 million people in Africa were living with HIV/AIDS. Of the 3 million AIDS-related deaths across the globe in 2001, 2.3 million occurred in Africa. Australia is a world leader in dealing with HIV/AIDS and its expertise will help health specialists and communities in Africa deal with this crisis.<br />
HIV/AIDS is a significant challenge in developed and developing countries. But in developing countries, the disease threatens to reverse decades of development because it attacks people in their most productive years, destroys communities, disrupts food production and places heavy burdens on already weak health services.<br />
It is therefore deeply gratifying that the special Asia-Pacific Ministerial meeting held in Australia late last year agreed to support the establishment of an Asia-Pacific Leadership Forum on HIV/AIDS to encourage political leadership and commitment at the highest level in tackling the disease.<br />
Australia, for its part, is committed to working with governments and community groups in Africa, Asia and the Pacific in the fight against HIV/AIDS. </p>
