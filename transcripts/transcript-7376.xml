SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
OPENING OF THE FESTIVAL OF PACIFIC ARTS<br />
TOWNSVILLE 15 AUGUST 1988<br />
All Australians and particularly those who are of Aboriginal<br />
and Torres Strait Islander descent can feel proud to be<br />
hosting the 5th Festival of Pacific Arts.<br />
For 16 years since 1972, * this Festival has provided a unique<br />
showcase for the cultures of the Pacific region a forum<br />
for traditional skills and a means of showing new directions<br />
being taken in response to the opportunities and challenges<br />
of the 20th Century.<br />
Previous Festivals of Pacific Art have been hosted by Fiji,<br />
New Zealand, Papua New Guinea and Tahiti.<br />
This year Australia is pleased to play its part as Festival<br />
host not just because of the historical links and the<br />
continuing friendship between Australians and the<br />
people of the Pacific;<br />
not just because of the importance of the close<br />
economic ties between us;<br />
but especially because of the pride we take in the<br />
culture of the original Australians, the Aboriginal<br />
and Torres Strait Island people, whose cultural<br />
achievements will be so much in evidence during<br />
this festival.<br />
it is true, but a matter for regret, to say that many<br />
non-Aboriginal Australians have failed to recognise and<br />
appreciate the wealth and richness of this original culture<br />
until relatively recently. The chasm between the original<br />
inhabitants of this continent and the Europeans who arrived<br />
200 years ago was too wide to be bridged easily or quickly. 1151 </p>
<p>Lea,<br />
In recent decades, however, there has been an enormous<br />
explosion of interest in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island<br />
cultures not only in Australia but overseas as well. It<br />
is my hope that this Festival will act as another catalyst<br />
in promoting greater appreciation and understanding among<br />
contemporary Australians of this 40, 000 year old culture.<br />
This Festival promises to be a memorable celebration of the<br />
song and dance, the drama and storytelling, the traditional<br />
craft and the contemporary film making of the cultures of<br />
the Pacific region providing vivid evidence, if any were<br />
needed, of the resilience, dignity and vigour of these<br />
cultures. Some 1800 performing artists are in Townsville for this<br />
Festival. All of you are welcome to Australia and to<br />
Townsville. My Government is proud to be associated with<br />
this Festival and to have provided assistance to bring it<br />
into being.<br />
I personally am delighted to be with you today and to wish<br />
you success and satisfaction in your performances and<br />
displays. I<br />
