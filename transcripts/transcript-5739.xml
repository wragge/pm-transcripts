44/ I L&gt;<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA FRIDAY, 22 JANUARY, 1982<br />
ACTING SECRETARY, THE DEPARTMENT OF PRIME MINISTER<br />
AND CABINET, AND ACTING SECRETARY TO THE CABINET<br />
An Acting Secretary will be appointed to the Department of<br />
the Prime Minister and Cabinet in the absence on sick leave<br />
of the Secretary.. Sir Geoffrey Yeend.<br />
The Acting Secretary will be Mr.* Ian Castles, Secretary,<br />
Department of Finance. Mr. Castles will also be Acting<br />
Secretary to Cabinet. The appointment will take effect from<br />
Monday 25 January, 1982.<br />
While the appointment of Acting Secretary is somewhat unusual,<br />
so too are the circumstances.<br />
Sir Geoffrey was hospitalised during his recreation leave for<br />
the removal of a stone from a liver duct. His medical advisers<br />
are now firm that his full recovery will require an absence<br />
from duty of at least two months.<br />
Given also the recent departure from the Department of the<br />
former Under Secretary, Mr. M. H. Codd, appointed Secretary of<br />
the Department of Industrial Relations, and the already other<br />
heavy commitments of senior officers of the Department, it<br />
has been decided that the appropriate course is the appointment<br />
of an Acting Secretary.<br />
The movement of Mr. Castles was made with the a greement of the<br />
Minister for Finance.<br />
Before his appointment to the Department of Finance, Mr. Castles<br />
was Under Secretary of the Department of the Prime Minister<br />
and Cabinet. 00 </p>
