TRANSCRIPT OF DOORSTOP, RESIDENCE OF THE AMBASSADOR OF<br />
THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY, CANBERRA<br />
3 OCTOBER 19190<br />
E OE PRCOOF ONLY<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, what does unification mean<br />
to Germans : Living in Australia?<br />
PM: I imagine it's a source of great pride for them. It<br />
should be. As it is for the 78 million people in<br />
Germany. It's important for them. Very important for<br />
Europe. Important for the world.<br />
JOURNALIST: Is it something we should fear?<br />
PM: No, no. As I said in my speech, I was, I think, one<br />
of the first to say when the changes occurred in East<br />
Germany that the reunification of Germany was both<br />
inevitable and proper. Of course there's nothing to fear<br />
about it. The German leadership and the German people I<br />
think are totally sincere in acknowledging the past and<br />
responsibilities to the past and they have a total<br />
commitment I believe to working for peace in their<br />
immediate region and globally. Certainly that's the<br />
direct tenor of the letter that I've received today from<br />
my friend Helmut Kohl.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, do you expect Mr Keating to<br />
be your Treasurer going to the next election?<br />
PM: You krLow, one of the funny things about you mob here<br />
is that you get down on a corner and you go beat, beat,<br />
beat, beat, let's beat up something. And then you expect<br />
me to add something to your beat. You go away in your<br />
corner and beat, beat, beat.<br />
JOURNALIST:: This afternoon<br />
PM: what that adds to is I don't deign to give any<br />
credit to your well I won't use the word I was going to<br />
because it could be misinterpreted your self beat-ups.<br />
I mean if you want to do that, you do it, but don't<br />
expect me to take you seriously. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: In about an hour's time Mr Murdoch is<br />
expected to announce the closure of most of his Melbourne<br />
and Sydney papers and replace them with just one 24 hour,<br />
seven day aL week paper. Is that a good development for<br />
the media in this country?<br />
PM: Well for some of those who might be rationalised out<br />
of a job I suppose they would have a particular view<br />
about it that it wouldn't be good for them. But it seems<br />
to me that it has the possibility of benefit for people.<br />
JOURNALIST: In what way?<br />
PM: Well I mean you'll have certain rationalisation of<br />
resources. You'll probably have the capacity for more<br />
editions of papers. So I don't tend to be an expert on<br />
these things. I mean I'm sure many of you are. But it<br />
will probably mean a loss of jobs for some people but as<br />
far as the community generally is concerned they probably<br />
will get a better service.<br />
JOURNALIST: You don't think the contraction of the range<br />
of opinions will be damaging?<br />
PM: Well, you know, if I look at the sort of opinions<br />
that come out of the Telegraph and the Mirror and out of<br />
the Sun and the Herald and the two city papers down<br />
there, I don't sort of perceive an enormous divergence of<br />
opinion in the past.<br />
JOURNALIST: What will be your response to the NFF's<br />
request to ease monetary policy?<br />
PM: Let's see them first, let's see them first.<br />
ends </p>
