    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Australian Government welcomes the recommendations of the UK Ministerial Working Group on Human Remains.</p>
<p>The Working Group's report represents substantial progress on a complex and divisive issue and builds upon the intent of the joint statement on Aboriginal remains made by the UK Prime Minister, Tony Blair, and myself in July 2000.</p>
<p>It builds upon the substantial amount of goodwill in Britain on this issue, as evidenced by the recent returns of ancestral remains to Australia from the Royal College of Surgeons and the Horniman and Manchester Museums.</p>
<p>The Report properly recognises and respects the fact that for many indigenous people the return of ancestral remains is essential for the spiritual rest of the deceased and the broader wellbeing of indigenous communities now and in the future.</p>
<p> I particularly applaud the recognition in the report that no institution should retain human remains without the consent of the genealogical or cultural descendants of the deceased.</p>
<p>The Report is a victory for common sense, in recognising the distinguished role of museums in education and research for the benefit of all of humanity, and the importance of cooperation between indigenous community representatives and museums to resolve the complex questions that typically relate to each repatriation case.</p>
<p>I congratulate the Working Group for their efforts and insight and call upon Australian indigenous representatives to work cooperatively with UK institutions to continue the sort of progress and good will on this important issue that we have already achieved in Australia.</p>
<p>During my forthcoming meeting with Prime Minister Blair I will be taking the opportunity to express my appreciation for the work to date in this area by his government and my hope that the UK government response to this report will allow progress to be sustained.</p>
