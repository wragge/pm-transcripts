SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
AUSTRALIAN CHAMBER OF MANUFACTURES<br />
( VICTORIAN DIVISION)<br />
MELBOURNE 19 SEPTEMBER 1991<br />
Mr Latta<br />
Premier Kirner<br />
Distinguished[ Guests<br />
Ladies and Gentlemen<br />
It is a pleasure to be invited to address your Annual<br />
Dinner especially one with the theme ' helping<br />
Australians t~ o make it'. That phrase is one way of<br />
describing our aim in government, a way of describing why<br />
we have broug~ ht about fundamental and far-reaching<br />
reforms in the economy. And I believe it is a way of<br />
describing what we all want for the Australian people.<br />
I would put i~ t a little more strongly. We not only want<br />
to help Australians make it we want Australians to make<br />
it better.<br />
To do that we must have an economy that is<br />
internationally competitive, one that is export driven.<br />
We cannot have that, and we cannot compete with imports<br />
with an economy that hides behind tariff walls.<br />
We cannot andl will not have a private sector dependent on<br />
policy handouts from the public sector. We must have and<br />
will have companies which are strong and self sustaining,<br />
that provide real jobs and real profits, because that is<br />
the only way Australians will make it, in an increasingly<br />
tough and competitive world.<br />
That Of cour se,. is not to say my Government will stand<br />
idly by. We are helping, and will continue to do so. We<br />
are intent on creating the framework for Australian firms<br />
to compete. lie are removing the impediments to investment<br />
and development. We have reformed the tax system as it<br />
relates to business, and continue to reform it. We are<br />
providing specific, targeted help to ease the transition<br />
of some industries to a more competitive environment. </p>
<p>This Government's objective in industry policy has been<br />
to build a more competitive Australia. That is the<br />
yardstick by which we have judged, and will continue to<br />
judge, policy proposals that come before us.<br />
There is an important distinction to be drawn between<br />
policies that stimulate and facilitate the growth of<br />
self-sustaining new industries, that rejuvenate old ones,<br />
and policies that bring into existence industries whose<br />
viability is dependent on special treatment by<br />
Government. In our years in Government we have put in place various<br />
policies of the former kind, and will continue to give<br />
careful consideration to the merits of any serious new<br />
proposals of this kind put before us.<br />
Policies of the latter kind have not only failed to bring<br />
about worthwhile change but have actually held back the<br />
development of competitive industries. We have been<br />
eliminating the obstacles to growth these policies<br />
represent and will continue to do so.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen<br />
In the twenty-first century Australia will not be able to<br />
look for special favours from special relations~ hips as we<br />
have thought we could do in the past. We have to stand on<br />
our own two feet, use our head and our hands, to think<br />
and to produce, if we are going to make it.<br />
We cannot allow our historic reliance on the export of<br />
unprocessed primary products to persist. We must break<br />
the cycle of a slump in commodity prices being followed<br />
by a slump in our economy. We must not and cannot as a<br />
nation be hostage to the fluctuations of commodity<br />
prices. We have to create in this country an efficient,<br />
innovative and competitive economic culture one that<br />
adds value to our great national resources of products<br />
and people.<br />
Look around the world today and you will not find another<br />
country which has a greater potential, and greater<br />
opportunities than Australia located, as we are, in the<br />
fastest growing and most dynamic region of the world, the<br />
Asia-Pacific region. Indeed I maintain that no other<br />
country in the world has the unique combination of our<br />
people,. our natural resources, and our economic and<br />
political freedoms.<br />
What we have to do, not sometime into the twenty first<br />
century, but here and now, is complete the work of<br />
updating and revitalizing the economic framework. We have<br />
to remove the impediments that prevent us becoming<br />
efficient and competitive. </p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, it is very easy for us all to get<br />
caught up in -the day to day issues, whether you are in<br />
government, or in business. We can be easily distracted<br />
by this week's figures, or by what someone says about<br />
them. But something very important, very fundamental has<br />
happened to the economy of this country over the past 8<br />
years. The Australian economy has been transformed, and we are<br />
beginning to see the scores on the board. There is still<br />
a long way to go, but restructuring is not just being<br />
talked about, it is being achieved and the<br />
manufacturing sector has been in the forefront of that<br />
achievement. Over the eight year period to 1990-91 the value of<br />
exports of non-metal manufactures covering machinery,<br />
transport equipment and other elaborately transformed<br />
items has increased by 220 per cent, involving growth<br />
in volumes of 149 per cent. Over the last two financial<br />
years the volume of these exports has grown by an<br />
astonishing 57 per cent.<br />
In 1990-91 manufacturing exports increased in real terms<br />
by 26 per cent. In 1990-91 the share of manufacturing<br />
exports in total exports was 18 per cent compared with 12<br />
per cent in 1982-83.<br />
Between 1985 and 1989 at the same time that we were<br />
taking the first steps to wind back protection<br />
manufacturing employment in Australia actually rose by 9<br />
per cent, nine times the OECD average of 1 per cent.<br />
The result has been a dramatically improved Balance of<br />
Payments the balance on goods and services is forecast<br />
to be in surplus in 1991-92 for the first time in over<br />
ten years.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen, manufactured exports exceeded rural<br />
exports for the first time in December 1990. I know this<br />
in part reflects the impact of the downturn in commodity<br />
prices, but I also believe this it marks a turning<br />
point in the kind of economy we have, and must have in<br />
the future.<br />
This process of fundamental change has been accelerated<br />
by what has been achieved so far in 1991, this<br />
unprecedented year of economic reform.<br />
As I said at the Financial Review dinner, the night after<br />
the Budget, 1991 is " the year of the most substantial and<br />
far-reaching reforms, not just in the life of this<br />
Government, but in the entire post war era." I challenged<br />
anyone then to show me a year of more fundamental change,<br />
and no one could. That is because no one can 1991 is<br />
the touchstone of economic change in this country. </p>
<p>4.<br />
1991 has been a year of exciting and rapid change all<br />
over the world, and it is easy to forget how far, and how<br />
fast we have come.<br />
It is just six months since the March Economic Statement,<br />
where further tariff cuts for both general manufacturing<br />
and the passenger motor vehicle and textile, clothing and<br />
footwear industries were introduced.<br />
But we have not simply left industry to sink or swim. We<br />
have put in place incentives to increase industry's<br />
research effort, including the Co-operative Research<br />
Centre Program and the indefinite continuation of the R&amp; D<br />
tax concession at 125%<br />
And we are encouraging industry to adopt the latest<br />
technologies through the Advanced Manufacturing<br />
Technology Development Program. We have introduced a<br />
program of international performance benchinarking Best<br />
Practice to encourage companies to compare themselves<br />
with the world's best.<br />
Importantly, we also widened the exemptions from sales<br />
tax for business inputs which will further increase<br />
competitiveness. We also announced in the March Statement our intention to<br />
introduce a definition of effective life for depreciation<br />
purposes into the Tax Act. The technical complexities of<br />
this change have caused it to take longer than we would<br />
have liked, but the Treasurer John Kerin has moved to<br />
accelerate the process and intends making an announcement<br />
of the detail of the proposed changes in the very near<br />
future.<br />
The second part of the 1991 reform package was the<br />
Special Premiers Conference in July.<br />
Central to the reshaping of the economy for the twenty<br />
first century is the reshaping of the relationship<br />
between the Commonwealth and the States. To compete<br />
internationally, we must think and act as a diverse but<br />
single nation, not a gaggle of uncoordinated states and<br />
territories with different rules and regulations.<br />
Reform of transport and electricity supply are vital to<br />
business,-and-have been among the first-fruits of the<br />
Special Premiers Conference, but further reform of our<br />
infrastructure is in progress.<br />
Here I mention waterfront reform because the benefits of<br />
this long and complex process will soon flow through to<br />
export oriented manufacturers. </p>
<p>The Waterfront Industry Reform Authority have already<br />
approved the exit of 1400 workers from the industry and<br />
anticipate that by the end of this month that figure will<br />
have climbed to 2200. By December 1992, when the reform<br />
process is co'mpleted 3000 workers are expected to have<br />
left the industry as direct consequence of reform from an<br />
initial workforce of 9000.<br />
The cornerstone of the reform is the move away from the<br />
system of industry-wide employment to one that is company<br />
based. This is making possible the negotiation of<br />
enterprise based agreements. It is estimated that these<br />
will give productivity gains of up to 60 per cent, and<br />
indeed 70 percent in smaller ports and in grain handling.<br />
In rail reform, the Commonwealth will become an initial<br />
equity partner in the National Rail Corporation at a cost<br />
of more than $ 260 million over the next four years. The<br />
Corporation is being established on a strictly commercial<br />
basis and is projected to turn a profit by 1994-95.<br />
Business will no longer have to deal with five separate<br />
loss-making rail systems instead, a single,<br />
commercially-based company will be responsible for<br />
interstate rail freight with a network extending from<br />
Brisbane to Perth.<br />
In road trans-port we will establish a national heavy<br />
vehicle registration, regulation and charging scheme.<br />
With the States we will set up a National Road Transport<br />
Commission to regulate heavy vehicles on a nationally<br />
uniform basis.<br />
In regard to electricity we will establish a National<br />
Grid Management Council which will deliver a more<br />
rational use of the nation's resources, and through a<br />
more efficient and national approach to future generating<br />
capacity will provide electricity cheaper than it<br />
otherwise wou: ld have been with clear benefits for the<br />
cost structures of all Australian industries.<br />
It is absolutely stupid that in Australia we should have<br />
6 different sets of regulations and standards in<br />
packaging, emiLssions into the environment, health, motor<br />
vehicles and other areas with which business must comply.<br />
Australia is over-regulated and if we did not do<br />
something about it we would have had more barriers to<br />
free trade in our single nation next year than would the<br />
twelve member nations of the European Community.<br />
From January 1993 we have agreed that regulations and<br />
standards covering goods and occupations in each<br />
jurisdiction will be recognised in each of the others.<br />
Those words represent a genuinely historic breakthrough<br />
in Commonwealth/ State relations and in the task of<br />
creating a unified and competitive Australian economy. </p>
<p>Last month's Budget also advanced our micro reform<br />
agenda. Ladies and gentlemen, if Australia is to have an<br />
internationally competitive economy Australians must be<br />
better trained and better educated. We must improve the<br />
skill level of our workforce we must improve apprentice<br />
and trainee intakes, and enhance labour market assistance<br />
to the unemployed.<br />
As we come out of this recession we must have the skilled<br />
workforce to take up employment. That is why we have, in<br />
this year alone, increased expenditure on labour market<br />
and training programs by 50 per cent in real terms. And<br />
in addition about $ 420 million has been allocated to TAFE<br />
including $ 40 million in 1991-92 for extra TAFE places.<br />
Another important initiative is the Small to Medium<br />
Enterprise Development Program which will run for three<br />
years at a cost of $ 14 million.<br />
A key element of this program is the new export<br />
development initiative for small and medium enterprises<br />
to be administered by the Australian Chamber of<br />
Manufactures with the support and involvement of other<br />
major national industry associations.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen, as we look ahead to the twenty<br />
first century it is quite obvious that Australia will<br />
have a significantly older population.<br />
An ageing population will impact directly on your<br />
businesses. Will there be enough people young enough to<br />
do the work? How will a reduced working population<br />
support an increasingly aged one? We have to act now, not<br />
only in the interest of social justice, but in the<br />
interest of your future.<br />
That is why we announced in the Budget our intention to<br />
legislate for the phased implementation of a minimum<br />
level of employer superannuation support of 9% by the<br />
year 2000.<br />
In addition to ensuring we have the capacity to meet the<br />
needs of an ageing population, superannuation provides a<br />
pool of national savings that will help fund the<br />
investment -we will need to keep up the pace of<br />
restructuring our economy.<br />
The Government appreciates the apprehension many of you<br />
may feel about the impact this initiative might have on<br />
your businesses. That is why it will be phased in over<br />
nine years, 1992 to the year 2000. That is why we intend<br />
to cushion the impact on smaller businesses by adopting<br />
an initial target of 3 rather than 5 per cent. </p>
<p>Some have sought to portray this reform as an additional<br />
cost impost on employers. This view is without<br />
justification. Everyone, including the trade union<br />
movement, recognises that it constitutes an improvement<br />
in conditions of employment, and it has been agreed that<br />
it will be taken into account in future wage negotiations<br />
under the Accord.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen<br />
In addition to contributing to our reform agenda, the<br />
Budget has, of course, played its more traditional role<br />
of establishing the appropriate settings for macro<br />
economic policy.<br />
In particular we have been at. pains to protect the<br />
structural integrity of the Budget to ensure that the<br />
public sector once again contributes to national savings<br />
as the recovery lifts Government revenues and reduces<br />
outlays. The Budget forecasts show a steady, moderately paced<br />
recovery of a kind we will be able to sustain. The<br />
forecasts include: 3 per cent inflation rate and a drop in the<br />
current account deficit to around $ 14 billion<br />
or : 3.5 per cent of GDP in 1991-92, from $ 22.3<br />
billion or 6 per cent of GDP in 1989-90<br />
exports to grow by 5.25 per cent while imports<br />
will remain subdued. Growth is coming from net<br />
exports which is a sign that the structural<br />
change in the economy is beginning to work for<br />
US.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen<br />
Australia is, for the first time in a generation, a low<br />
inflation country. Australia's inflation rate, at 3.4<br />
per cent, now stands below the 4.3 per cent average of<br />
our major trading partners in the OECD.<br />
More importantly, for the first time in a generation, we<br />
have the opportunity to make this situation permanent.<br />
The continuing success of our wages policy will be<br />
crucial to achieving this objective. It is firmly based<br />
on two complementary and equally vital elements.<br />
First we have the commitment of the trade union movement,<br />
to secure a wages outcome in the order of 5% this year.<br />
In future years they have agreed to work with us towards<br />
wage outcomes consistent with keeping Australia's<br />
inflation rate at levels comparable with those of our<br />
major trading partners. </p>
<p>Second, we are seeking to achieve greater flexibility and<br />
decentralisation in the wages system. Through<br />
productivity based workplace bargaining, we can reduce<br />
real unit labour costs and lift living standards.<br />
It is unreasonable and inequitable to expect further<br />
reductions in real unit labour costs to be driven by<br />
reductions in workers' living standards.<br />
The enhanced flexibility we are working to achieve in the<br />
wages system offers the opportunity for management and<br />
workers to achieve mutual benefit by co-operating in the<br />
common objective of making their enterprises perform<br />
better. The signs are that the recession has bottomed and that<br />
the recovery has commenced.<br />
That most valuable if intangible economic indicator,<br />
confidence is making a come-back, not least here in<br />
Melbourne. The announcement of the $ 420 million Toyota Engine Plant<br />
to be built in Altona, following the opening of Melbourne<br />
Central, is a wonderful example of confidence in action.<br />
In welcoming the Toyota project to Melbourne, I think you<br />
would all join with me in paying a special tribute to one<br />
man, who convinced Head Office that this was the right<br />
place, and the right time: Toyota's Chief Executive,<br />
Robert Johnston.<br />
Over a wide range, key indicators are on the upswing.<br />
the Westpac/ CAI survey of industrial trends<br />
indicated that new manufacturing orders in the<br />
coming quarter would be the best since 1989<br />
manufacturing industry inflation expectations<br />
for the December quarter are the lowest on record<br />
housing statistics confirm a pick-up in housing<br />
starts. The recent cuts in interest rates will<br />
consolidate this recovery<br />
Despite a slight fall-back in the last two months,<br />
the index of consumer confidence has risen by<br />
since the February trough<br />
recent retail trade statistics suggest that<br />
spending is beginning to pick up<br />
consumer inflation expectations in the<br />
September quarter are down to 4% from 6.1% in the<br />
June quarter, after having been above 10% through<br />
the 1980' s </p>
<p>4 9.<br />
there i~ s clear evidence that the rundown of stocks<br />
has slowed.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen, I have gone into some detail about<br />
how the government is creating the climate, the framework<br />
for the revitalization of Australian industry and the<br />
reform of the Australian economy.<br />
That action : Ls the kind that government could and should<br />
take. It looks to the future, it looks to the structure<br />
of the econoray. It is of direct benefit to industry.<br />
But we need to0 be careful in how the Government<br />
intervenes in the economy. We must not repeat the<br />
mistakes of t: he past, where a few industries were<br />
protected at the expense of the development of the rest.<br />
There are times when it is appropriate for government to<br />
act to help Ft particular industry, as we have done with<br />
the steel industry, pharmaceuticals, information<br />
technology and aerospace. But we must avoid the trap of<br />
creating industries that will never stand on their own<br />
feet, and continually demand ever bigger subsidies.<br />
We are about removing obstacles to investment and<br />
development. But we are not going to abandon our<br />
responsibilities to the environment and to aborigines<br />
nor do I believe you would expect that of us.<br />
We want development, but it must be ecologically<br />
sustainable development. We are committed to reducing<br />
duplication and inefficiency in environmental assessment<br />
and protection processes, but it is no time to be<br />
lessening our environmental responsibilities, standards<br />
or controls.<br />
Achieving an internationally competitive, ecologically<br />
sustainable Australian economy is the responsibility of<br />
business as much as the Government.<br />
Government can set the framework, but it is up to you,<br />
who make decisions about the what happens on the factory<br />
floor about where the factory floor is about what the<br />
factory puts iLnto our land and air to play your part.<br />
The great task ahead of us, drawing upon our unique<br />
national strengths and characteristics, is to create an<br />
internationall~ y competitive outward-looking economy which<br />
encourages and enables our ongoing program of economic,<br />
environmental and social justice.<br />
This is the challenge. It is one that I accept, and my<br />
Government accepts. It is a challenge that the<br />
Australian pecople through their steadfastness and<br />
farsightedness through these difficult times, have<br />
accepted. </p>
<p>But it is a challenge in which business must continue to<br />
play an important part. You must we all must think<br />
and act on a larger and more imaginative time frame than<br />
the next financial year.<br />
What we do, what we make and what we sell must be seen in<br />
the context of a world which won't do us any favours<br />
but will buy when we produce our best. I am certain that<br />
with the advantages we enjoy, with confidence in<br />
ourselves and commitment to one another, Australians<br />
will make it because we will make it better. </p>
