TRANSCRIPT OF QUESTION AND ANSWER SESSION SATELLITE HOOKUP<br />
TO NEW YORK FOR McINTOSH, HANSON, HOARE, GOVETT INC BUSINESS<br />
CONFERENCE 5 OCTOBER 1988<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
McINTOSH: Good morning Prime Minister.<br />
PM: Good morning John.<br />
McINTOSH: How are you? We are talking to you from a grand<br />
room in New York and there are a lot of very interested<br />
potential investors in Australia and they're looking forward<br />
very much to hearing what you have to say.<br />
PM: Thank you.<br />
McINTOSH: So perhaps I could start with the questions.<br />
PM: Yes.<br />
McINTOSH: The first question Sir is on privatisation.<br />
Privatisation has been a major feature of structural reforms<br />
in a number of countries, not just in Mrs Thatcher's<br />
Britain, but also in countries where the governing party has<br />
strong links with the labour unions, like Spain and New<br />
Zealand. Last year you raised the possibility that your<br />
Government would sell off its interests in airlines and the<br />
Commonwealth Bank amongst other things. What prospect is<br />
there of progress in this direction from here on?<br />
PM: Well just let me quickly make the point that what we're<br />
concerned about here in Australia is efficiency in the<br />
creation of the level playing field between public sector<br />
enterprises and the private sector and in that respect we<br />
have made significant changes in regard to the arrangements<br />
covering the operations of the public sector. Let me take<br />
the largest one, that is Telecom. we have removed a lot of<br />
the bureaucratic regulations there. We have made decisions<br />
which will open up Telecom to competition that they didn't<br />
have before. That's most particularly true John in regard<br />
to value added services and the maintenance of equipment<br />
section and so that area of public enterprise is going to be<br />
much more open to competition now than it was before. we<br />
think that will make for greater efficiency. When I raised<br />
the question of the possible sale of or disposal of some<br />
part of some enterprises and I talk about particularly the<br />
two airlines, Qantas, Australian national Airlines and<br />
perhaps the Commonwealth Bank, my major concern was<br />
questions of funding. I want to make it clear to your<br />
audience that there wasn't any, and they can put it </p>
<p>-2-<br />
( PM cont) ideological type of drive about this, it was a<br />
question of funding, a priority of resources and my Party<br />
has decided that it needs to look at this issue. We have a<br />
committee which is looking at it now. The question of<br />
funding problems won't go away. The committee is looking at<br />
it and I don't want to prejudge their work. But what I want<br />
to say to your audience is that in this country there are<br />
areas of enterprise which inevitably will be within the<br />
public sector. You couldn't for instance if you take the<br />
area of telecommunications and post, we have such a wide<br />
spread population that the private sector would not be able<br />
to sustain the degree of cross-subsidisation which is<br />
involved in providing services to our far flung country<br />
people now. So really what we want to do is to make sure<br />
that where we have large parts of enterprise like this in<br />
the public sector that at least they are open in important<br />
areas to private competition. Now we're doing that and as I<br />
say on the question of funding and whether there needs to be<br />
some changes there that awaits the outcome of the work of<br />
this committee and I'm not going to prejudge that.<br />
McINTOSH: Well thank you for that answer Sir. The next<br />
question I wanted to ask you is on the wage tax trade off.<br />
You've indicated an intention to seek a trade off with the<br />
trade unions involving smaller wage rises in exchange for<br />
tax cuts. What chance is there that you'll be able to<br />
achieve a trade off involving no wage rise at all next year<br />
and and what size of tax cuts would you have to give to get<br />
the unions to agree to no wage rise?<br />
PM: Well I think it's rather unrealistic to talk about no<br />
wage rise. But I ask your audience to remember the history<br />
of this period in Government and what we've achieved. It's<br />
quite remarkable by any standard. We have actually achieved<br />
a significant reduction in real wages and in terms of real<br />
unit labour cost there has been a return to the level of the<br />
There's been an 11% reduction in real unit labour<br />
costs. Now we are at a point we believe where we can<br />
continue to improve the competitive position of Australian<br />
industry by sensible arrangements with the trade union<br />
movement. There will be movements in money wages but there<br />
won't need to be the extent of movements in money wages that<br />
there would have to be in the absence of the accord and the<br />
social wage approach that we've got. So what it means is<br />
that we will continue a wages policy which will maintain the<br />
real wage position of workers but in a declining inflation<br />
situation John. In this last year on the annual basis the<br />
inflation rate was about We aim to have that by the end<br />
of this financial year, that is June of next year, to have<br />
that inflation down to 4 1/ 2 to 5% at the most. Now that<br />
will mean that you won't need the level of money wage<br />
increases to keep up real wages that you would otherwise<br />
need and we have said to the trade unions that we look at a<br />
significant tax cut as being part of this whole equation.<br />
And that's one of the reasons why we are maintaining our<br />
intention to save the tax cuts until July the first next<br />
year. one of the other reasons is of course in terms of </p>
<p>-3-<br />
( PM cont) proper economic management we don't want to have<br />
an excessive level of demand which could lift our import<br />
levels to an unnecessarily high level. Now as to the actual<br />
measure of wage cuts let me say this that while I have great<br />
involvement with and sympathy with your program I know that<br />
you're not expecting the coup of this program that I will<br />
announce the level of wage cuts on your program. You'd love<br />
me to do it but I'm not going to. What I can say is these<br />
things. Firstly so that we can get the greatest degree of<br />
cooperation on the wages front and therefore maintain costs<br />
pressures we will be giving a primacy to wage cuts at the<br />
lower and middle levels of the income scales. They will be<br />
very significant cuts and at the top level where we've<br />
already reduced the top rate from the 60 cents in the dollar<br />
that we inherited from the conservatives, to 49 cents in the<br />
dollar, there will be significant cuts there, there could be<br />
some staging of that. One of the parameters of course which<br />
sets what you do there is the fact that we've reduced the<br />
company rate to 39 cents and you can't for any significant<br />
period of time have a major gap between the company rate and<br />
the top income rate. So those are the sorts of<br />
considerations. But I say in sum to your audience John that<br />
the past five and a half years shows that by the combination<br />
of wages policy and tax policy and social wage policy we've<br />
done better than any other country in reducing real unit<br />
labour costs and increasing the competitives of Australian<br />
industry and we will continue to do that.<br />
McINTOSH: Sir on trade there has been a certain amount of<br />
confrontation with the United States in respect to certain<br />
commodities. Does this weaken in your view the alliance<br />
between Australia and the United States?<br />
PM: No it's not weakened. It is the judgement of both my<br />
Government and the Administration of the United States not<br />
only interchange between us in private conversations, it's a<br />
matter of public record on the part of the Administration<br />
and my Government, that the relations between our two<br />
countries in the alliance sense have never been stronger.<br />
One of the features of the strength of the relationship is<br />
that it follows that where we do have differences on a<br />
particular issue we are capable with integrity and strength<br />
to say to one another where we differ. We have expressed<br />
concerns to the United States Administration about certain<br />
aspects of the US Trade Bill and some of their policies,<br />
particularly in the agricultural area. Now we understand as<br />
far as the United States is concerned that certainly on the<br />
part of the Administration they have a philosophical<br />
commitment to free trade. They share our view on that.<br />
They find themselves in the situation where they believe<br />
they have had to take retaliatory action basically against<br />
the Europeans and the common agricultural policy of the<br />
Europeans. But as I said when I was in the United States in<br />
June we know that the gun hasn't been aimed at us when these<br />
policies have been brought in but it's not much help to an<br />
Australian farmer to say when he gets hit in the head with a </p>
<p>-4-<br />
( PM cont) bullet that the bullet wasn't intended for you<br />
sport, it was intended for the Europeans. It still hurts to<br />
get the bullet. Now we've put these arguments very strongly<br />
to the United States Administration and we've been able to<br />
do that I know without in any sense weakening the alliance.<br />
It is the view of the President, of George Shultz, of your<br />
defence people, that the relationship has never been<br />
stronger in those senses and that is an accurate assessment.<br />
McINTOSH: An ancillary question to that is the United<br />
States elections which are as you know drawing close<br />
PM: Yes I've heard about that<br />
McINTOSH: I can assure Sir you don't hear about anything<br />
else in this town. Following you recent visit to the United<br />
States which Party would you feel would offer the best<br />
benefit to Australia on trade relations?<br />
PM: What am I offered George? What's the offer Mike?<br />
What's the offer? I mean who do you want me to No you'd<br />
appreciate that I can't and I would not make publicly any<br />
comment that would indicate any pre-disposition on my part<br />
or the part of the Australian Government or people in this<br />
issue. This is properly a matter for the democratic<br />
processes of the people of the United States. But I can say<br />
these things which I think perhaps are relevant. I have of<br />
course known George Bush now for a long time and I had the<br />
opportunity of meeting Mr Dukakis when I was there in June.<br />
I took the opportunity in discussions with both George and<br />
Michael Dukakis to put before them these things. Firstly<br />
the importance to us of the alliance relationship between<br />
the United States and Australia and I'm very pleased of<br />
course that they both strongly affirmed their committment to<br />
that relationship. I also of course put to both of them<br />
Australia's concerns about the creation of a freer<br />
international trading system in general and of course in<br />
particular the need to include agriculture in the freeing up<br />
processes that are now being discussed in the Uruguay Round.<br />
I believe that both of them understand our commitments in<br />
that regard and I think essentially they share our views.<br />
So let me say that I feel that because of the basic nature<br />
of our alliance relationship which let me remind your<br />
audience rests upon our shared commitment to certain basic<br />
ideals of freedom of the liberty of the individual, the<br />
rights of the individual before the law, these are<br />
fundamentals which we in Australia share with you in the<br />
United States because our alliance relationship is based<br />
upon that shared commitment, a commitment which has been<br />
expressed both in war and in peace together then I'm certain<br />
that whatever the outcome of the United States election the<br />
alliance relationship between Australia and the United<br />
States will remain strong and fruitful. </p>
<p>McINTOSH: Let me ask you some questions on labour reforms.<br />
I could preface my questions by saying that Simon Crean has<br />
been here and my observation is that he wowed the audience<br />
on Monday. But you said that your Government has made a<br />
start on matters like labour's market reforms, you've<br />
achieved that in the coal industry some fairly basic things<br />
like opening the mines for 6 days a week and eliminating the<br />
month-long shut down over Christmas. Things that are fairly<br />
elementary in other parts of the world are being proposed.<br />
The labour unions don't seem to like this. There's more<br />
talk of national coal strikes I understand. What assurances<br />
can you give us as investors in these sort of places that<br />
some real progress has been made on these basic issues?<br />
PM: Let me say this to my American friends that we'll take<br />
on the American coal produces in an unsubsidised fully<br />
competitive way, particularly say in Japan, anytime you<br />
like. We'll beat you because we are the most efficient and<br />
one of the concerns that we have for instance in regard to<br />
the Japanese situation is that we wouldn't like to see our<br />
American friends and our Japanese friends come to any<br />
arrangements in regard to coal sales which took into account<br />
any considerations other than the truly competitive price<br />
that can be offered to the Japanese and I say to you without<br />
equivocation let's meet and compete on that basis. We'll<br />
beat the pants off you every time. So we can't be going too<br />
badly in the way we produce our coal. Having said that I am<br />
not complacent about the industry. There is of course John<br />
as you rightly say room for improvement and the decision<br />
which has just been brought down by the Coal Industry<br />
Tribunal certainly points the way to improvement. Now the<br />
employers obviously ask for these changes and they have<br />
essentially got what they asked for. Let me say this that I<br />
think the employees, the rank and file members, understand<br />
the inevitability of these changes and to the credit of the<br />
leadership of the union they have recommended that the rank<br />
and file accept these. There have already been meetings<br />
which have endorsed that recommendation by the leadership.<br />
It is my view that within a short time that will be the<br />
confirmed position of the workers. In other words it may be<br />
with some degree of reluctance that they will accept these<br />
changes. Now let me say this to my American friends and any<br />
other competitors around the world. We can beat you as it<br />
is on price now, just watch out when these changes come in.<br />
McINTOSH: Thank you. A couple of people have just left the<br />
room.<br />
PM: They'll switch into something else.<br />
McINTOSH: There is a shortage of skilled labour. What<br />
future steps do you envisage taking in education to start a<br />
process of retraining and achieve certain structural changes<br />
in the workforce. </p>
<p>-6-<br />
PM: Good question. Let me quickly just give you a little<br />
bit of history and then the future. one of the worst things<br />
that we inherited from the conservatives when we came in in<br />
' 83 was an awfully low retention rate of our kids in<br />
secondary education beyond the compulsory age. only 36% of<br />
our kids stayed on beyond that compulsory age in 1982. Due<br />
to a range of measures which my Government have taken we've<br />
now got that up to 57% and by the end of the early part of<br />
the ' 90s we'll have that up to 65%. So the basic building<br />
block is changing. That is the kids are staying in the<br />
education system much longer now and more of them will do<br />
that. Now we are not only concerned with them staying there<br />
but improving the quality of the education they are<br />
receiving and in cooperation with the States that is being<br />
addressed. Now let me then go to the area of tertiary<br />
education. We've already very vastly increased the number<br />
of tertiary places but I'm not satisfied with the increase<br />
that's taken place so far John. What we're doing now is to<br />
put in another $ 9 billion into tertiary education in the<br />
next three years and that will create an additional 40,000<br />
places which is the equivalent to creating universities of<br />
the size of the existing Melbourne, Sydney and Adelaide<br />
universities. Not only are we very very dramatically<br />
increasing the numbers of places in the tertiary sector, we<br />
are opening up the range of availability so that the kids<br />
from relatively disadvantaged families and lower income, the<br />
kids with a talent irrespective of income level of their<br />
parents, they are going to get into the tertiary sector.<br />
But we're also making sure that the tertiary sector becomes<br />
more relevant to the needs of the economy. Now I don't take<br />
the view that education is simply for the economy but you<br />
can't have an education system which is irrelevant to the<br />
economy. So we are cooperating with industry to make sure<br />
that these additional places and vastly increased places are<br />
going to be relevant. we know, all of us, in industry that<br />
it's not only people who come through the universities that<br />
are relevant to your skilled workforce. So what are we<br />
doing there? We are doing these things. In our technical<br />
education system, that's the TAFE system we call it,<br />
Technical and Further Education, putting both more money<br />
into that but we are cooperating closely with industry to<br />
ensure that those courses are more relevant and make for a<br />
more flexible workforce. So when you bring that together<br />
more kids going through the education system, the actual<br />
technical training area, more resources, more involvement of<br />
industry, the tertiary sector, very very much more money and<br />
more people going through it. But then very importantly let<br />
me make this point to your audience. In one sense the<br />
greatest revolution that's happening at the moment in<br />
Australia is this. We have our industrial awards which set<br />
out the classifications of workers in industry. The major<br />
award in the manufacturing sector is the metal trades award,<br />
some 350 classifications which have been -( satellite break) </p>
<p>-7-<br />
PM: ( pick up from satellite break) I was pointing out that<br />
the major award in the manufacturing sector in Australia is<br />
this Metal Trades Industry award. It's accumulated 350<br />
different classifications over some 60 years. Now the<br />
employers and the unions in co-operation with the Government<br />
and the Arbitration Commission are working on that. By the<br />
middle of next year that'll be wiped out, we'll have eight<br />
classifications. This is going to be very important in<br />
facilitating flexible training within industry, so that you<br />
haven't got labour market classifications related to a<br />
distant and irrelevant past. The classifications which will<br />
be relevant to a changing present and challenging future.<br />
So when you take account of all these things, what we are<br />
doing as a government in terms of the primary and secondary<br />
schooling, the technical system, the tertiary sector, and<br />
what we're doing as well within the actual labour market<br />
structure with the reclassification of awards, I'm confident<br />
that American investors can be looking to a future Australia<br />
which will have a well trained, flexible, committed labour<br />
force. McINTOSH: is that as Chairman of McIntosh Securities I<br />
constantly get asked, and that's on the subject of<br />
retirement.<br />
PM: Benefits or?<br />
McINTOSH: You've obviously had a major role in convincing<br />
the unions<br />
PM: John, I'll swap your retirement benefits for mine mate.<br />
McINTOSH: I've always wanted a gold pass. You've obviously<br />
had a major role in convincing the unions and the Australian<br />
electorate on the need to accept your government's policies.<br />
I can understand that you would like to stay on to beat<br />
Malcolm Fraser's record as the second longest serving Prime<br />
Minister but you're 10 years younger than Ronald Reagan was<br />
when he started as President of the United States. Can you<br />
provide any indication as to how long you would intend to<br />
stay in the job?<br />
PM: I'll be around for quite a while yet John. I feel<br />
strong, I'm confident, I have the support of the Party and I<br />
suppose in the end, most importantly, I have the support of<br />
the people. They are the ones who in the end make the<br />
decision. I'm very fortunate John that, sure I'm leader and<br />
I'm very proud of it and I think I do a good job, but I've<br />
been very fortunate in having a very very good team around<br />
me and that covers all the important areas and of course the<br />
audience there is going to see one of the most important<br />
members of my team, Paul Keating, tomorrow. He's been an<br />
outstanding Treasurer. Together Paul and I and the others<br />
have provided what is a very very outstanding government.<br />
So that it's just not my own assessment, I would point out<br />
and I hope Mr Howard is around there somewhere because the<br />
new shadow minister for finance that he's appointed, John<br />
Hewson, now you can hardly accuse him of being biased. He </p>
<p>-8-<br />
( PM cont): wrote just quite recently in the Australian<br />
Business Review that the Hawke Government is the most<br />
professional and most competent front bench since 1945. Mr<br />
Hewson gets a number of things wrong but he's dead right on<br />
that one. So I've got a good team and I intend to be<br />
leading it for quite some time.<br />
McINTOSH: Thank you for that answer. Perhaps my<br />
penultimate question would be on world trading blocks.<br />
There's some concern the world would be dividing itself into<br />
trading blocks. of course we've got Europe in 1992, the<br />
US and Canada, Japan and other Asian countries, or even<br />
Japan and the United States. Does it concern you that<br />
Australia might be left out of this process and if so what<br />
would you intend to do about it?<br />
PM: Let me say this. Australia's fundamental commitment<br />
John, and ladies and gentlemen, is to the freeing up of<br />
the international trading system. Sensible economics and a<br />
concern for a sound and stable political world demands that<br />
that be the outcome because history shows that if the world<br />
degenerates into divided protectionist blocks then this is a<br />
recipe for political disaster and possible conflict. In<br />
this nuclear age we can't contemplate a degeneration into<br />
that situation. So that is why Australia, not merely in<br />
terms of our own perceived interests but as part of the<br />
world community, has played a leading role in the<br />
multilateral negotiations. It was Australia which led the<br />
processes which created the Cairns Trading Group which has<br />
now become a firmly established part of these processes.<br />
We're trying to play a role essentially John in bridging the<br />
gap between the United States and Europe in these<br />
negotiations. AS we come up to the mid term review,<br />
Montreal in December, we have said, particularly in this<br />
area of agricultural trade, although that's not the<br />
exclusive ambit of these discussions, Americans are<br />
concerned that we do free up international trade in<br />
agricultural products but they say, well, let's make sure<br />
that at the end, the long term, we've completely freed it<br />
up. The Europeans have been tending to say let's look at<br />
some, perhaps, immediate moves. We have said you've got to<br />
marry the two. You've got to have some short term harvest,<br />
if you like, starting next year which will do something<br />
about sort of freezing the processes of protection and<br />
subsidisation in agricultural trade but married to a long<br />
term objective. To the great credit of the United States<br />
just two days ago in the official talks in Pakistan, they<br />
have said yes there ought to be some intermediate changes.<br />
We agree with that. Now we're expecting the Europeans to<br />
respond to that so we are going to put all our pressures,<br />
not only in regard to agricultural trade negotiations, but<br />
to make this Uruguay Round productive. The world's best<br />
interests are served not by blocks but by a freeing up of<br />
the system. The world has benefited in the post war period<br />
and we owe a great deal to the vision and the imagination<br />
and the commitment and the initiative of the United States<br />
in the post war period in creating the multilateral trading<br />
system under GATT. We want to see that strengthened. For </p>
<p>-9-<br />
( PM cont): succumbed to any suggestions about detailed<br />
discussions about blocks. we are watching what's happening<br />
and I've responded to the invitation by the Japanese Prime<br />
Minister when he was here in Australia just recently to set<br />
up a study group to look at the implications of what's<br />
happening in Europe and in North America. We're going to<br />
look at that and all I can say is that in the worst case<br />
scenario, if the Uruguay round didn't work and didn't<br />
produce the optimum results that we want, then we would have<br />
to look at the possibility of some association with others,<br />
including Japan. We are part of the fastest growing region<br />
in the world in the western Pacific, we would look at that.<br />
But unequivocally, Australia's best interests, the United<br />
States best interests, the world's best interests, are<br />
making the Uruguay round work, make it productive so that we<br />
free up the system. That will be good for developed<br />
countries like the United States and Australia and very<br />
importantly it will give the best possible chance to the<br />
developing world of lifting themselves up. Because in the<br />
end the welfare of those developing countries depends upon<br />
them being able to sell competitively into the markets of<br />
the developed world. So that's where all our emphasis<br />
should be.<br />
MCINTOSH: The last question is a very general one. Is<br />
there anything you'd like to say to our United States<br />
friends here tonight that perhaps we haven't covered?<br />
PM: Could I just quickly say this to our friends in the<br />
United States. I repeat what I said before, our<br />
relationship between our two countries is strong and<br />
healthy, it's never been stronger. Where we have<br />
differences we are able, because of the strength of that<br />
relationship, to talk those differences through and we'll do<br />
that. But my country, let me say this. I am proud to be<br />
Prime Minister of Australia as we come now towards the end<br />
of this century because I can say I believe without any<br />
possibility of contradiction that Australia is now a more<br />
open, competitive country than it's been before. I've given<br />
you the statistics, I won't repeat them. we are practising<br />
within our own country what we're preaching to the rest of<br />
the world. we are making our economy more competitive,<br />
we're making it more open. This has been possible because<br />
of the change in attitude that we've engendered. The<br />
attitudes of the past have changed, that we inherited, where<br />
Australian was set against Australian, where there was<br />
confrontation. There is now, at all sorts of levels,<br />
realistic co-operation involving government but particulary<br />
involving employers and workers because they see and<br />
understand that the future of Australia depends upon it<br />
being able to have competitive manufacturing and services<br />
industries. we have just recently brought about a reduction<br />
in protection of the order of 30%, that's what we've<br />
initiated. When there was a reduction in protection back in<br />
the early 170s it nearly brought the country apart but now<br />
this has been accepted. But we know that while we have vast<br />
natural resources and an increasingly well trained and<br />
flexible workforce we know that we need the investment, the </p>
<p>( PM cont): expertise of people from other countries.<br />
Therefore as part of our whole deregulation processes of the<br />
financial markets and so on we have also liberalised our<br />
foreign investment rules to the point where our friends in<br />
the United States and elsewhere know they are welcome here.<br />
So I say to you, we want you to come here, to bring your<br />
capital, to bring your expertise, knowing that you're going<br />
to have a government which welcomes you, a trade union<br />
movement which wants to co-operate with you to ensure that<br />
we have a growing and more prosperous Australia and you come<br />
to a country, admittedly with only a market of 16.5 million,<br />
but you come to a country which is a platform for expansion<br />
and export into the fastest growing region in the world.<br />
You come to a country which has excellent relations with the<br />
countries of the region. You come to a country which has<br />
relations with China which are acknowledged as being better<br />
than any other country has with China, for instance. You<br />
come to a country which is one of the most politically<br />
stable in the world. So we are proud of what we are doing,<br />
but not complacent, we know that there are challenges in<br />
front of us but we have the right attitudes in this country.<br />
We are co-operating together with one another in Australia,<br />
we wan't to co-operate with others to come and work with us.<br />
I say to your audience there, there is no country in the<br />
world that in the last five and a half years has shown a<br />
capacity properly to manage itself, there's no country which<br />
has better relations with the relevant countries of the<br />
region and others in Europe and around the world, there's no<br />
country which is better placed in that respect. So we're<br />
proud of ourselves but we're not complacent. We look<br />
forward to working further with you because we just happen<br />
to believe we're just about the best place on earth. But we<br />
can be better and we'd like to be better with your help<br />
McINTOSH: I have to agree with that. I can only say that<br />
this conference I think I can say in all modesty has<br />
been a great success and a large part of that success has<br />
been due to the policies that you and your colleagues have<br />
put in place in the last five or six years.<br />
PM: Thank you very much.<br />
McINTOSH: There's no doubt that your popularity and your<br />
presence in the United States is such that when we have held<br />
this conference and in particular this evening we had a<br />
large number of people obviously wanting to attend to hear<br />
what you had to say. We really appreciate your appearance<br />
here this morning, your time. A measure of the extent of<br />
your popularity and the extent of the interest in Australia<br />
which I think your government has created, the fact that<br />
around about 30 people have ventured across from Europe to<br />
attend the conference. I think I can say that in a share<br />
market which is not exactly buoyant at the moment, it's<br />
interesting that so many people would want to attend and so<br />
many people would want to hear political leaders from<br />
Australia, union leaders and of course corporate leaders and<br />
I think that that is a great measure of what you have done<br />
since your government came to power five or six years ago. </p>

McINTOSH ( cont): We thank you very much for speaking to us<br />
this morning. It's certainly been something that I'm sure<br />
everyone in this room will be able to go away and think long<br />
and hard about and recognise that, as you say, we have a<br />
great country if not the best country in the world. I am<br />
certainly proud of it and I think all the Australians in the<br />
room are certainly proud of it and we thank you for<br />
illuminating us and addressing us this morning.<br />
PM: Thank you very much John, thank you.<br />
