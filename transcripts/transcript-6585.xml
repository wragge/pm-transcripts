TRANSCRIPT OF PRIME MINISTER'S PRESS CONFERENCE<br />
WASHINGTON 7 February 1985<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
GOOD AFTERNOON LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I KNOW THAT THERE WILL BE A<br />
NUMBER OF QUESTIONS YOU WANT TO ADDRESS TO ME SO I WILL TAKE UP ONLY<br />
AS SMALL AMOUNT OF YOUR TIME BY AN OPENING STATEMENT. I WANT TO SAY<br />
THAT I AND MY PARTY HAVE ENJOYED AND FOUND BENEFICIAL THIS VISIT TO.<br />
WASHINGTON. IT GIVES ME THE OPPORTUNITY IN RENEWING CONTACTS NOT<br />
ONLY WITH THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES BUT THE SIGNIFICANT<br />
MEMBERS OF THE ADMINISTRATION. IT HAS GIVEN US THE OPPORTUNITY TO<br />
DISCUSS A WIDE RANGE OF MATTERS OF MUTUAL INTEREST. WHILE NATURALLY<br />
ENOUGH THE EMPHASIS AS FAR AS THE MEDIA IS CONCERNED HAS BEEN UPON<br />
WHAT I MIGHT BROADLY TERM SECURITY MATTERS, THERE HAS OF COURSE BEEN<br />
SIGNIFICANT DISCUSSIONS IN OTHER AREAS. IN THE AREA OF SECURITY, I<br />
THINK YOU ARE AWARE OF THE DECISIONS THAT HAVE BEEN TAKEN. JOINT<br />
STATEMENTS HAVE BEEN MADE TO THE SECRETARY OF STATE SHULTZ AND MYSELF<br />
AND THE STATEMENT I MADE EARLIER THIS AFTERNOON AT THE END OF MY<br />
MEETING AT THE WHITE HOUSE I BELIEVE THEY ARE VERY CLEAR STATE<br />
THE POSITION ON WHICH WE HAVE AGREED ON MATTERS OF IMPORTANCE IN THAT<br />
AREA.<br />
SIN OTHER AREAS OF IMPORTANCE TO US, WE HAVE OF COURSE DISCUSSED THE<br />
ECONOMIC POSITION IN OUR RESPECTIVE COUNTRIES. WE HAVE ACKNOWLEDGED<br />
THE SIGNIFICANT GROWTH THAT HAS BEEN ACHIEVED IN THE UNITED STATES<br />
AND IN AUSTRALIA, AS A RESULT OF THE POLICIES THAT UNILATERALLY WE<br />
HAVE EFFECTIVELY PURSUED. I TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY OF POINTING OUT THE<br />
THE PRESIDENT AND TO MEMBERS OF THE ADMINISTRATION THE IMPORTANCE OF<br />
A FLOURISHING, VIGOROUSLY, GROWING UNITED STATES ECONOMY AND WE TAKE<br />
REASSURANCE FROM THEIR BELIEF THAT 1985 WILL CONTINUE TO BE A YEAR OF<br />
SUBSTANTIAL GROWTH. AND THAT IS OF COURSE IMPORTANT NOT ONLY FOR THE<br />
PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES., THAT IT HAS A BROAD SIGNIFICANCE FOR<br />
THE REST OF THE WORLD, NOT LEAST . OF ALL FOR OUR COUNTRY.<br />
WHILE TALKING OF MATTERS ECONOMIC, LET ME SAY THAT I WAS ABLEI'. WITH..<br />
MY COLLEAGUES, TO HAVE DETAILED DISCUSSIONS WITH REGARD TO A NUMBER<br />
OF PARTICULAR MATTERS IN THE ECONOMIC AREA. I-TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY<br />
OF EXPRESSING OUR SATISFACTION AND INDICATION OF WHAT THE<br />
ADMINISTRATION INTENDED IN RESPECT OF THE 1985 FARM BILLS. WHAT THEY.""<br />
INTEND TO DO THERE AUGURS WELL FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT OF CENTRAL<br />
PRINCIPALS IN BOTH INTERNATIONAL MARKETS FOR AGRICULTURAL P. RODUCTS,.'.<br />
AND IT FITS CONSISTENTLY WITH THE BALANCE AND DECISIONS WE PUT ON<br />
0 2 </p>
<p>WPH59708<br />
. iNDAY ? USSELS TO THE EURO) PEAN COMMISSION. I EMPHASIZED TO THE<br />
' RESIDENT AND TO RELUCTANT MEMBERS OF THE ADMINISTRATION THE GREAT<br />
1.1PORTANCE THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT ATTACHES TO THE ESTABLISHMENT OF<br />
AN iNTER-JATTIONAL TRADERS REGIME BASED ON THE PRINCIPALS OF<br />
i. ULTILATERALISM AND LIBERAL PRACTICES IN THE AREA OF INTERNATIONAL<br />
TRADE. MY COUNTRY DEPENDS VERY SUBSTANTIALLY UPON THE EMERGENCE AND<br />
FLOURISHING OF SUCH PRINCIPLES. OUR GREAT AGRICULTURAL INDUSTRIES<br />
HAVE SUFFERED FROM THE ABSENCE OF THOSE PRINCIPLES IN RECENT YEARS<br />
AND WE TAKE COMFORT FROM THE FACT THAT THE PRESIDENT AND HIS<br />
ADMINISTRATION SHARE OUR COMMITMENT TO THOSE PRINCIPLES AND WILL JOIN<br />
WITH US IN SEEKING TO HAVE ESTABLISHED A NEW MULTILATERAL TRADE<br />
RO) U N D.<br />
WITHIN THAT CONTEXT I EMPHASIZED TO THE PRESIDENT THE POTENTIAL<br />
DIFFICULTIES THAT WE SEE IN THE EMERGENCE OF EUROPE, BILATERALISM,<br />
SPECIFICALLY THERE AND WE PRESS OUR CONCERN THAT TRADE IN THE AREA<br />
PARTICULARLY OF COURSE BETWEEN JAPAN AND THE UNITED STATES THAT THERE<br />
SHOULD NOT BE COMPLETED AGREEMENTS FOR THE SALE OF COAL FROM THE<br />
UNITED STATES ON NON-COMPETITIVE TERMS. AND MAY I ALSO SAY THAT ON A<br />
PARTICULAR MATTER OF IMPORTANCE TO THE PEOPLE OF AUSTRALIA THAT IT IS<br />
A MATTER OF CONSIDERABLE PLEASURE FOR ME THAT THE PRESIDENT INDICATED<br />
T: -E IMPORTANCE THAT HE AND THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE UNITED STATES<br />
ATTACHES TO BI-CENTENNIAL CELEBRATIONS WHICH WILL BE UNDERTAKEN IN<br />
AUSTRALIA IN 4988. IT IS A MATTER OF COMFORT TO US AND PLEASURE THAT<br />
" fHE PRESIDENT ANNOUNCED THAT THERE WILL BE A SUBSTANTIAL INVOLVEMENT<br />
BY THE UNITED STATES IN THOSE CELEBRATIONS AT THE LEVEL OF GOVERNMENT<br />
AND OF THE PRIVATE SECTOR. LET ME THEN COMPLETE THIS STATEMENT BY<br />
BRIEFLY GOING TO THE SECURITY ISSUES.<br />
A STATEMENT THAT WAS MADE BY SECRETARY OF STATE GEORGE SHULTZ AND<br />
MYSELF HAVE MADE CLEAR-THE SHARED PERSPECTIVES THAT WE HAVE AND THE<br />
REASON FOR THE DECISION MUTUALLY ARRIVED AT IN REGARD TO THE QUESTION<br />
OF MX TESTS. ON THE ISSUE OF ANZUS I MADE IT CLEAR TO THE PRESIDENT<br />
AND AGAIN TO ALL RELEVANT MEMBERS OF THE ADMINISTRATION THAT THE<br />
AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT REMAINS IN AN UNDIMINISHED WAY COMMITTED TO THE<br />
ANZUS TREATY WITH CONTINUED ACCEPTANCE ON. BOTH OUR PARTS OF THE<br />
RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS WHICH HAVE OPERATED ' AND, AS FAR AS WE ARE<br />
CONCERNED, WILL CONTINUE TO OPERATE UNDER THAT TREATY INTO THE<br />
FUTURE. WITH THAT SHORT INTRODUCTION LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I AM<br />
AVAILABLE FOR YOUR QUESTIONS.<br />
QUESTION: MR HAWKE, DO YOU ENDORSE THE U. S. STRATEGIC MODERNISATION<br />
PROGRAM AND IF NOT WHAT IS YOUR INTERPRETATION OF THE JOINT STATEMENT<br />
WITH MR SHULTZ YESTERDAY WHICH STATED THAT BOTH SIDES AGREED THAT THE<br />
SMC WAS DIRECTED FURTHER IN NUCLEAR DETERRENCE THAN HELPING NUCLEAR<br />
ARMS CONTROL?<br />
ANSWER: I AM AWARE OF THE APPARENT DIFFICULTY SOME HAVE HAD IN<br />
INTERPRETING THAT WE HAVE A FAIR UNDERSTANDING OF THAT STATEMENT AND<br />
I AM ASSISTED IN WHAT I SAY IN RESPONSE TO YOUR QUESTION, BY THE<br />
INFORMATION I HAVE THAT A SENIOR OFFICIAL IN THE UNITED STATES<br />
ADMINISTRATION EARLIER TODAY HAS MADE CLEAR THE POSITION THAT IT IS<br />
INVOLVED IN THAT SECOND PARAGRAPH. BECAUSE AS I UNDERSTAND IT HE<br />
SAID THAT IF YOU WERE TO TAKE THE PROPER TARGETTING OF PARAGRAPH 2<br />
THE POSITION IS QUITE CLEAR. WHAT WE ARE SAYING, AND WHILE THAT MAY<br />
PRODUCE SMILES, THE FACTS ARE NEVERTHELESS THERE AND UNDISPUTABLE.<br />
WHAT IS SAID IS THAT WE MET AND RENEWED OUR CONTINUED DISCUSSIONS<br />
CONCERNING TWO THINGS STRATEGIC DETERRENCE AND MUTUAL EFFORTS TO<br />
ACHIEVE NUCLEAR ARMS REDUCTION. WE AGREED ON THE IMPORTANCE OF BOTH<br />
OF THESE KEY OBJECTIVES. THAT WAS THE AGREEMENT WE EXPRESSED THEN<br />
AND IT WAS A REFLECTION OF A CONTINUING REALITY AS FAR AS OUR GOVERNMENT<br />
IS CONCERNED. THE PARAGRAPH GOES ON TO SAY THAT AS FAR AS THE </p>
<p>WH59708<br />
LJJITED STATES IS CONCERNED THEIR STRATEGIC MODERNISATION PROGRAM HAS<br />
PEN DIRE'CTED TOWARDS THOSE ENDS. THE STATEMENT DID NOT INVOLVE AN<br />
ENDORSEMENT BY MY GOVERNMENT OF STRATEGIC MODERNISATION PROGRAMS,<br />
EITHER COLLECTIVELY, OR IN RESPECT OF ANY OF ITS INDIVIDUAL PARTS.<br />
IHOSE THINGS ARE A MATTER FOR THE UNITED STATES. THE POSITION MY<br />
GOVERNMENT IS QUITE CLEAR AND HAS BEEN FROM THE TIME WE CAME TO<br />
OFFICE. WE HAVE A COMMITTMENT TO THE CONCEPT OF EFFECTIVE STRATEGIC<br />
DETERRENCE. IT MAY NOT BE IDEAL, INDEED IT IS NOT. THE ONLY THING<br />
1T HAS IN ITS FAVOUR IS THAT IN THIS TROUBLED WORLD, SINCE THE END OF<br />
I! E LAST WAR, IT HAS OPERATED TO PREVENT THE EMERGENCE OF A NUCLEAR<br />
h:-OJCAUST. MY GOVERNMENT TAKES THE VIEW THAT IT IS NOT THE MOST<br />
SATISFACTORY METHOD OF CONDUCTING RELATIONS BETWEEN THE SUPER POWERS,<br />
WHICH IS NOT ONLY A MATTER FOR THEM BUT WHICH IS A MATTER OF<br />
FUNDAMENTAL IMPORTANCE TO MOST PEOPLE OF THE WORLD. AND IT IS FOR<br />
THAT REASON, AS WELL AS SUPPORTING THE CONCEPTS OF STRATEGIC<br />
DETERRENCE, WE ARE PLAYING A PART IN IT SUBSTANTIALLY BY THE<br />
PROVISION OF JOINT FACILITIES IN AUSTRALIA. BUT THEN IN ADDITION TO<br />
THATt MY GOVERNMENT IN THE TIME ITS COME TO OFFICE, HAS TAKEN THE<br />
VIEW THAT WE MUST USE ALL OUR BEST ENDEAVOURS TO TRY AND CREATE IN<br />
THIS WORLD A SANER METHOD OF PRODUCTIVE RELATIONSBETWEEN THE SUPER P<br />
POWERS. AND THAT'S WHY WE HAVE ATTACHED THE MOST PROFOUND IMPORTANCE<br />
TO INITIATIVES ON A WHOLE RANGE OF AREAS TO TRY AND WORK TOWARDS A<br />
SITUATION OF REDUCED LEVELS OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS WORKING ULTIMATELY<br />
TOWARDS THEIR ELIMINATION. NOW, I HOPE I'VE MADE IT CLEAR, I CAN'T<br />
MAKE IT ANY CLEARER, THAT THE STATEMENT WHICH WAS MADE GOES TO A<br />
QUESTION OF SHARED OBJECTIVES, WHICH ARE MENTIONED AND THE STATEMENT<br />
DOES NOT, NOR HAS IT BEEN TAKEN BY THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT, TO<br />
MEAN AN ENDORSEMENT BY MY GOVERNMENT OF THE STRATEGIC MODERNISATION<br />
PROGRAMS.<br />
QUESTION: PRIME MINISTER, WHAT DO YOU THINK IS THE BEST COURSE TO BE<br />
TAKEN WITH YOUR COLLEAGUE MR LANGE, TO TRY TO PURSUADE HIM TO CHANGE<br />
HIS MIND OR JUST DROP IT, AND DROP NEW ZEALAND PERHAPS FROM ANZUS?<br />
ANSWER: I KNOW THAT THIS IS AN AREA WHICH W. ILL BE A MATTER OF<br />
CONSIDERABLE CONCERN TO ALL . OF YOU SO PERHAPS I COULD GO INTO IT IN<br />
SOME DETAIL AND IT MAY SATISFY A RANGE OF QUESTIONS WHICH MAY BE IN<br />
YOUR MIND. WE'VE MADE IT CLEAR FROM THE TIME OF THE ELECTIONS OF THE<br />
NEW GOVERNMENT IN NEW ZEALAND THAT WHAT NEW ZEALAND DECIDES IN THIS<br />
AREA OR INDEED IN ANY OTHER MATTER IS A DECISION FOR A SOVEREIGN AND<br />
INDEPENDENT GOVERNMENT OF NEW ZEALAND. I MADE THAT CLEAR TO MR LANGE<br />
WHEN WE FIRST MET IN PORT MORESBY IN AUGUST OF LAST YEAR. WE HAVE<br />
MADE IT CLEAR DIRECTLY, BY CORRESPONDENCE, THE POSITION OF THE<br />
AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT. I HAVE MADE IT CLEAR BOTH TO MR LANGE AND TO<br />
THE GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED STATES THAT WE ARE NOT IN THE BUSINESS<br />
OF HAVING ONCE CONVEYED OUR POSITION OF SEEKING TO BRING PRESSURE ON<br />
THE GOVERNMENT OF NEW ZEALAND TO INFLUENCE ITS DECISIONS. WE WOULD<br />
NOT APPRECIATE ANY ATTEMPT THAT WAS MADE UPON US EITHER BY THE<br />
GOVERNMENT OF NEW ZEALAND OR ANYONE ELSE TO TELL US WHAT OUR POSITION<br />
SHOULD BE. WE RESPECT AND FOLLOW THE SAME PRINCIPLES AS FAR AS NEW<br />
ZEALAND IS CONCERNED. WHAT WE HAVE SAID IS, THAT AS FAR AS THE<br />
GOVERNMENT OF AUSTRALIA IS CONCERNED, THAT THE ANZUS TREATY REMAINS<br />
OPERATIVE BETWEEN US, AUSTRALIA AND THE UNITED STATES, AND WE WILL<br />
CONTINUE ITS OPERATION IN TERMS OF OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE RIGHTS<br />
AND OBLIGATIONS UNDER THAT TREATY. IT IS NOT OUR WISH OR INTENTION<br />
TO WREAK ANY VENGEANCE UPON NEW ZEALAND AND I AM COMFORTED BY THE<br />
CLEAR STATEMENT THAT THE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE UNITED STATES<br />
ADMINISTRATION, FROM THE PRESIDENT DOWN, AND INCLUDING SECRETARY<br />
SHULTZ, THAT THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT STILL REGARDS NEW ZEALAND<br />
AND THE PEOPLE OF NEW ZEALAND AS FRIENDS OF THE UNITED STATES. I<br />
ONLY HOPE THAT IN A SITUATION WHERE WE, THAT IS AUSTRALIA AND THE<br />
UNITED STATES, WILL CONTINUE THE OPERATION OF ANZUS. WE CAN ONLY<br />
./ 4 </p>
<p>WH59708<br />
IOPE THAT WITH FURTHER CONSIDERATION OF THIS MATTER THE GOVERNMENT OF<br />
NEW ZEALAND MAY SEE SOME WISDOM IN ADOPTING A NEW POSITION. BUT WE<br />
WILL DOy NO-THING BY WAY OF PRESSURE TO TRY AND PRODUCE THAT RESULT.<br />
THoEAT IS A MATTER FOR NEW ZEALAND.<br />
1 UESTION: PRIME MINSITER, ON THAT POINT IT HAS BEEN SAID REPEATEDLY<br />
THAT NEW ZEALAND IS NOT ACTING OUT ITS ROLE AS AN ALLY. HAS THERE<br />
BEEN ANY TALK AT ALL IN TERMS OF AUSTRALIA TRYING, EITHER IN AN<br />
OFFICIAL OR UNOFFICIAL TREATY WITH THE UNITED STATES THAT WOULD<br />
EXCLUDE NEW ZEALAND?<br />
ANSWER: NO, NOT AT ALL, AND THERE IS NO NEED FOR IT. BECAUSE WE ARE<br />
NOT IN A POSITION OF TALKING ABOUT SUSPENDING THE TREATY OR<br />
ABANDONING THE ANZUS TREATY. THE GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED STATES AND<br />
THE GOVERNMENT OF AUSTRALIA REGARD THE ANZUS TREATY AS REMAINING IN<br />
EXISTENCE AND OPERATIVE IN ITS FULL IMPLICATIONS BETWEEN US AND WE<br />
WILL CONTINUE ALL THE THINGS UNDER THAT TREATY AS WE HAVE IN THE<br />
PAST. AND THAT MEANS, WITHOUT BEING EXHAUSTIVE ABOUT IT, IT MEANS<br />
THE UNDERTAKING OF JOINT EXERCISES, IT MEANS THE SHARING<br />
INTELLIGENCE, IT MEANS THE MAKING AVAILABLE OF FACILITIES WITHIN<br />
AUSTRALIA FOR VISITING SHIPS OF THE UNITED STATES. NOW THOSE THINGS<br />
HAVE BEEN DONE UNDER THE ANZUS TREATY AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE DONE.<br />
THERE IS NO QUESTION AND IS NO NEED TO CONTEMPLATE THE CREATION OF<br />
ANOTHER TREATY.<br />
QUESTION: WHAT ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN AUSTRALIA AND NEW<br />
ZEALAND?<br />
ANSWER: WELLL ITS CHANGED IN THIS RESPECT PAUL, THAT, NAVAL<br />
EXERCISES WON'T BE HELD WHILE THE GOVERNMENT OF NEW ZEALAND ADHERES<br />
TO ITS POSITION. THERE WONT BE THOSE TRI-LATERAL EXERCISES. BUT WE<br />
HAVE MADE IT CLEAR TO THE GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED STATES AND IN<br />
PARTICULAR THE FACT, THAT WE GLADLY AND A WITH RATIONAL* ACCEPTANCE OF<br />
THE SITUATION WITHIN THE COMMUNITY IN WHICH WE OPERATE, THE<br />
GOVERNMENT OF AUSTRALIA WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE RELATIONS WITH THE<br />
GOVERNMENT OF NEW ZEALAND IN THE AREA OF MILITARY COOPERATION. WE<br />
SHARE A RESPONSIBILITY, AUSTRALIA AND NEW ZEALAND IN. A REGION OF* THE<br />
WORLD WHICH IS WITNESSING SOME DEGREE OF RELATIVE INSTABILITY<br />
COMPARED TO RECENT TIMES, AND I REFER, OF COURSE, TO DEVELOPEMNTS IN<br />
NEW CALEDONIA. IT COULD IN NO WAY BE IN THE INTERESTS EITHER OF<br />
AUSTRALIA OR OF NEW ZEALAND OR OF THE GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED STATE<br />
WERE WE TO CEASE EXERCISES AND RELATIONSWITH THE GOVERNMENT OF NEW<br />
ZEALAND NOR WILL WE.<br />
QUESTION: INAUDIBLE CAN I JUST FOLLOW THAT UP IS AUSTRALIA STILL<br />
REGARD NEW ZEALAND AS INAUDIBLE<br />
ANSWER: WELL I THINK THE ACCURATE WAY OF PUTTING IT IS THIS, IT GOES<br />
BACK TO THE ANSWER I'VE GIVEN BEFORE. WE REGARD THE ANZUS TREATY AS<br />
REMAINING IN OPERATION. ITS NOT CANCELLED IN REGARD TO NEW ZEALAND.<br />
NEW ZEALAND, AUTONOMOUSLYi AND AS IT IS ENTITLED TO DO, HAS MADE A<br />
DECISION WHICH HAS MEANT THAT HITHERTO NORMAL OPERATIONS OF THE<br />
TREATY WOULD NOT OPERATE. BUT THE POSITION IS BEING LEFT SO THAT THE<br />
TREATY IS NO WAY CHANGED AND IF THE GOVERNMENT OF NEW ZEALAND WERE TO<br />
CHANGE ITS POSITION, AND SAY WE WANT TO'RESUME NORMAL OPERATIONS,<br />
THEN NOTHING WILL HAVE BEEN DONE, EITHER BY THE GOVERNMENT OF THE<br />
UNITED STATES OR OF AUSTRALIA, TO PREVENT THAT HAPPENING<br />
QUESTION: MR PRIME MINISTER INAUDIBLE<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I THOUGHT YOU WERE DIRECTING PROCEEDINGS THEN,<br />
SORRY. </p>
<p>W 7. 8<br />
I. c. . T ZEA; AND S x Tf-E D(' G-HCOUS' AND AUSTRALIA<br />
0T l'OP WHAT S2EC7C TYPE OF CENEFITS DO YOU EXPECT AUSTRALIA TO<br />
UFC EXAMFLE MIG T IT GET THE AMERICAN ANTARTIC BASE IN<br />
C*-; R2STC* URCH?<br />
ER: WELL YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU START TO TALK ABOUT DOG-HOUSES IT<br />
J%_ INGS EACK MEMORIES, AND I REJECT YOUR ANALYSE, AND WE CERTAINLY<br />
&gt; ThT SEEK TO DERIVE FOR AUSTRALIA ANY RESIDUAL BENEFITS FROM THE<br />
': TCISON THATS EEEN TAKEN BY THE GOVERNMENT OF NEW ZEALAND. THAT'S<br />
" HE WAY WE OPERATE AND WE WOULDN'T INTEND TO. WE REGARD NEW<br />
? KALAN[) AS A FRIEND, AND IT'S NOT THE ACTION OF A FRIEND TO TRY AND<br />
,: T7RVE ADVANTAGE FROM A TEMPORARY DIFFICULTY OR IMPASSE WITH WHICH A<br />
I S TNVO rVED.<br />
OJESTION: PRIME MINISTER, COMING BACK TO STRATEGIC DEFENCE DID YOU<br />
;,' ECEIVE AN ASSURANCE FROM SECRETARY WWINBERGER THAT THE UNITED STATES<br />
VOULD NOT ATTEMPT TO INCLUDE ITS FACILITIES IN AUSTRALIA IN THE SDI.<br />
ANSWER: INDEED. I RAISED THE QUESTION WITH WEINBERGER. WE HAVE<br />
AREADY BEEN GIBEN THE UNQUALIFIED ASSURANCE BY THE GOVERNMENT OF THE<br />
UNITED STATES THAT NONE OF THE Jñ iN FACILITIES HAVE ANY ROLE IN THE<br />
RISEARCH UNDERTAKEN UNDER THE STRATEGIC DEFENCE INITIATIVE. WE HAD<br />
ALREADY BEEN GIVEN THAT ASSURANCE AND IN LIGHT OF THE CURRENT<br />
SITUATION I SOUGHT FROM AND OBTAINED FROM MR WEINBERGER UNQUALIFED<br />
ASSURANCE THAT CONTINUES TO BE THE POSITION.<br />
QUESTION: INAUDIBLE UNITED STATES AS YOU KNOW, HAS SAID HE PLANS<br />
IHE SECOND AMERICAN REVOLUTION. DO YOU THINK IT POSSIBLE THAT THE<br />
INAUDIBLE QUESTION ASKED IF THE SECOND REVOLUTION WOULD LEAD TO A NEW<br />
MOVEMENT OF POPULATION FROM THE U. S. TO AUSTRALIA.-<br />
ANSWER MOVE OF THE POPULATION FROM THE. UNITED STATES TO AUSTRALIA?<br />
WELL, THERE ARE A NUMBER OF THE CITIZENS OF-THE UNITED STATES WHO I<br />
CAN THINK OF WHO I WOULD LOVE TO SEE IN AUSTRALIA AND INDEED OVER<br />
RECENT YEARS THERE HAS BEEN A RELATIVE INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF<br />
CITIZENS OF THE UNITED STATES SEEKING TO IMMIGRATE TO AUSTRALIA. WE<br />
WELCOME THAT AND WITHIN OUR NON-DISCRIMINATORY IMMIGRATION PROGRAMME<br />
THAT IS CURRENTLY RUNNING AT THE ORDER OF ABOUT 70,000 PER YEAR,<br />
THERE IS ROOM THERE FOR PEOPLE FROM THE UNITED STATES. THERE IS NO<br />
COUNTRY IN THE WORLD WITH WHICH WE HAVE A WARMER RELATIONSHIP THAN<br />
THE UNITED STATES. THEREFORE, OBVIOUSLY CITIZENS OF THE UNITED<br />
STATES WHO THOUGHT THEY WANTED TO COME OUT AND JOIN THE BEST SAILORS<br />
IN THE WORLD WOULD BE WELCOME.<br />
QUESTION MR HAWKE CAN YOU TELL US WHAT YOUR OWN ATTITUDE IS NOW<br />
TOWARDS THE STRATEGIC MODERNISATION PROGRAMME AND SECONDLY IN VIEW OF<br />
YOUR EARLIER COMMENTS, CAN WE TAKE IT THAT WHEN A STATE DEPARTMENT<br />
OFFICIAL SAID YESTERDAY, ACCORDING TO AN OFFICIAL TRANSCRIPT, THAT<br />
THEY BOTH FELT THAT THE STRATEGIC MODERNISATION BEING CARRIED OUT BY<br />
THE UNITED STATES WAS DIRECTED TOWARDS THOSE ENDS, THAT IS DETERRENCE<br />
AND ARMS CONTROL THAT HE WAS UNDER A MISAPPREHENSION?<br />
ANSWER WELL I THINK I'VE MADE IT CLEAR BEYOND ANY DOUBT WHAT THE<br />
INTENTION OF THE STATEMENT WAS. I KNOW TO WHOM YOU'RE REFERRING.<br />
ALL I CAN SAY IS THAT IN THE BRIEFING THAT HAS BEEN GIVEN TO THE<br />
MEDIA EARLIER TODAY BY A SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL, THE POSITION<br />
HAS BEEN PUT AS I PUT IT. NOW ITS ON THE RECORD, I THINK NO PURPOSE<br />
IS SERVED BY REPEATING WHAT I HAVE QUITE CLEARLY SAID. AS TO MY OWN<br />
POSITION, MY POSITION IS THAT OF THE GOVERNMENT THAT I HAVE JUST PUT<br />
TO THIS MEETING. I f </p>
<p>7L'-<br />
::. OC C COXING CACS TO STRATEGIC DEFENC7<br />
IvE z! I^ IST R Y~ S<br />
STRATEGIC MODERNISATION PROGRAMME. DO YOU IN ANY WAY<br />
l: 1SAGREE OR AGREE WITH THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT ON THIS<br />
J: T; ATIVE, YOU MENTIONED A COUPLE OF INITIATIVES WHICH<br />
C EA. THE ELIMINATION OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS FROM THE FACE OF THE<br />
ART: 9? D: O YOU INCLUDE THIS INITIATIVE IN THOSE INITIATIVES WHICH<br />
-il-L0A TO THIS END?<br />
A'SWER POSIT. ION IN REGARD TO THE SDI IS QUITE CLEAR AND I HAVE<br />
. AD) T&gt; AT POSITION CLEAR IN MY DISCUSSIONS WITH THE PRESIDENT AND<br />
IT TPE OTHER RELEVANT MEMBERS OF THIS ADMINISTRATION, AND THAT IS<br />
IHAT WHILE WE CAN UNDERSTAND THE CONCEPT AS IT'S SEEN BY THE UNITED<br />
STATES AOINISTRATION FROM IT'S POINT OF VIEW ON THIS RESEARCH<br />
P OGRAE, iE ARE NOT ENDORSING IT. IT'S NOT AN INITIATIVE AS FAR AS<br />
; AE USTRALIAN GOVERNMENT IS CONCERNED THAT RECEIVES OUR ENDORSEMENT.<br />
S. ;-; AVE HA: D EXPOUNDED TO US WHAT THE REASONING IS OF THE UNITED<br />
ETATES. LET ME SAY THAT WE ACCEPT THE INTEGRITY OF THEIR EXPOSITION.<br />
' RE NOT UESTIONING THAT EXPOSITION. BUT WE DON'T ENDORSE THE<br />
' PROGPRAMME. AS WITH A NUMBER OF OTHER PEOPLE WE PERCEIVE DIFFICULTIES<br />
THAT CAN ARISE UNDER THE PROPOSAL. IT IS BASED UPON ASSUMPTIONS<br />
A3OUT A CAPACITY FOR TOTAL DEFENCE AGAINST INCOMING OFFENSIVE WEAPONS<br />
WHICH RAISTE VERY SERIOUS QUESTIONS AND WHICH RAISE THE QUESTION OF<br />
WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IN THE PERIOD, THIS LONG TIME SCALE FOR RESEARCH<br />
THAT HAS BEEN TALKED ABOUT TEN OR PERHAPS MORE YEARS. IN THAT<br />
SITUATION THAT WOULD NOT MEAN THAT THERE IS AN INCREASED POSSIBILITY<br />
OF A BUILD-UP OF DEFENSIVE WEAPONS NOT ONLY ON THE OTHER SIDE BUT<br />
WITHIN THE UNITED STATES. NOW THESE ARE MATTERS OF CONCERN AND<br />
BECAUSE WE HAVE LAID DOWN THE CONCERN WHICH I'VE EXPRESSED AND WHICH<br />
HAS BEEN UNDERSTOOD BY THE UNITED STATES THE QUESTION OF ENDORSEMENT<br />
THEREFORE DOES NOT ARISE. BUT IT IS IMPORTANT, I THINK, THAT WE DO<br />
NOT QUESTION THE INTEGRITY OF THE PRESIDENT AND THE GOVERNMENT OF THE<br />
UNITED STATES AS TO THEIR VIEW.<br />
OUESTION: PRIME MINISTER, A SMALL WHAT DO YOU SUGGEST IN<br />
PLACE OF THAT INITIATIVE, DID YOU MAKE ANY SUGGESTIONS IN PLACE OF<br />
THAT INITIATIVE?<br />
ANSWER: I DIDN'T MAKE ANY SUGGESTIONS IN PLACE OF IT, OTHER THAN THE<br />
OVERWHELMING POSITION OF THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT WHICH HAS BEEN<br />
FOLLOWED FROM THE DAY WE CAME TO OFFICE, AND THAT IS, THAT IN ALL<br />
RELEVANT FORUMS, WE SHOULD JOIN WITH LIKE MINDED GOVERNMENTS TO<br />
PURSUE NEGOTIATIONS CALCULATED TO BRING ABOUT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE A<br />
REDUCTION IN THE LEVEL OF NUCLEAR ARSENALS IN THE WORLD, AND THAT'S<br />
WHY WE HAVE WELCOMED, AND I TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY WHILE HERE, OF<br />
WELCOMING DIRECTLY TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, THE<br />
INITIATIVE THAT BEEN TAKEN IN REGARD TO THE GENEVA TALKS. WE HAVE<br />
BEEN EXTENSIVELY BRIEFED, IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE TALKS, AND THEN AGAIN<br />
WHILE WE HAVE BEEN HERE, AS TO WHAT HAS HAPPENED IN THOSE TALKS, AND<br />
WE HAVE MADE IT CLEAR TO THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT THAT WE<br />
SUPPORT, NOT ONLY THAT INITIATIVE, BUT WE WILL IN THE AREA OF THE<br />
COMPREHENSIVE TEST BAN TREATY, CHEMICAL WEAPONS AREA OF ACTIVITY<br />
WHERE WE ARE SEEKING A NEW PROTECTIVE TREATY. IN ALL RELEVANT FORUMS<br />
WE WOULD SEEK TO PRODUCE A SITUATION WHICH WILL REDUCE THE LEVEL OF<br />
ARMAMENTS, THAT IS IF YOU WANT TO PUT IT AS AN ALTERNATIVE, OUR<br />
POSITION. WE WILL CONTINUE TO PURSUE THAT POSITON IN ALL RELEVANT<br />
INTERNATIONAL FORUMS. ./ 7 </p>
<p>7--o 9 7 D,<br />
* j C c T7 T S CE AR ON 0N\ YOU SATO THAT AUST RAlJlA<br />
UL3 CONTINUE MILITARY COOPERATIN WITH NEW ZEALAND. SPECTFICALLY<br />
ILL THE NEW ZEALAND FRIGATE THAT WAS GOING TO AUSTRALIA FOR TH ESE<br />
[ XERCISE3 NEXT MONTH ACTUALLY PARTICIPATE WITH AUSTRALIAN SHIPS<br />
WITHOUT THE UNITED STATES?<br />
ANSWER: I CAN'T SAY THAT ABOUT THAT PARTICULAR FRIGATE, BUT WHAT'S<br />
HAPPENED NOW, IS THAT YOU HAD IN PLACE, A SET OF ARRANGEMENTS WHICH<br />
WERE POSTULATED UPON THE INVOLVEMENT OF THE THREE POWERS. NOW THEY<br />
HAVE BEEN CANCELLED. NOW WHAT HAS TO HAPPEN IS THERE WILL BE<br />
DISCUSSIONS BETWEEN OUR TWO GOVERNMENTS, AUSTRALIA AND UNITED STATES,<br />
AS TO THE EXERCISE THAT WE WILL CONDUCT, AND THERE WILL BE<br />
DISCUSSIONS BETWEEN US AND NEW ZEALAND AS TO WHAT'S APPROPRIATE FOR<br />
AN EXERCISE BETWEEN US SO I OBVIOUSLY CAN'T ANSWER THE QUESTION WITH<br />
REGARD TO THAT DISPUTE YET.<br />
QUESTION: WOULD I BE CORRECT IN YOU MENTIONED THAT NORMAL ANZUS<br />
ACTIVITIES BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND AUSTRALIA WILL CONTINUE.<br />
ANSWER: YES<br />
QUESTION: WOULD IT BE CORRECT TO PRESUME THAT THESE ACTIVITIES YOU<br />
DESCRIBE SHOWING A MILITARY INTELLIGENCE AND SO ON EXCLUDE NEW<br />
ZEALAND? IN OTHER WORDS, WILL THERE BE DE-FACTO BILATERAL LINES<br />
WITHIN THE<br />
ANSWER: WELL, TAKE THE ELEMENTS THAT ARE INVOLVED, AS FAR AS THE<br />
EXERCISES ARE CONCERNED THEY WILL BE BILATERAL. THAT'S THE MAIN<br />
THEME OF WHAT I'VE SAID. NOW AS FAR AS THE QUESTION OF THE SHARING<br />
OF INTELLIGENCE IS CONCERNED IT IS NOT CERTAIN AT THIS STAGE WHAT<br />
DECISION THE UNITED STATES WILL MAKE ABOUT THAT. THEREFORE I CAN'T<br />
ANSWER YOUR QUESTION. YOU SEE WHAT I MEAN, IT MAY BE THE DECISION OF<br />
THE UNITED STATES THAT THEY CONTINUE TO SHARE AN INTELLIGENCE. IF<br />
THAT THE CASE YOU'LL INAUDIBLE.. FOR QUITE AWHILE.<br />
QUESTION: MR PRIME MINISTER, YOU MENTIONED THE IMPORTANCE OF TRADE<br />
RELATIONS IN YOUR COUNTRY, I'M CERTAIN YOU ARE AWARE OF THE ACTIONS<br />
THAT HAVE ALREADY TAKEN PLACE ON CAPITOL HILL. SENATOR COHN OF MAINE<br />
I THINK IS GOING TO INAUDIBLE.. ( QUESTION REFERS TO TRADE<br />
SANCTIONS AGAINST NEW ZEALAND). WHAT IS YOUR VIEW OF THAT<br />
PARTICULAR ACTION AND IN VIEW OF THE EXERCISES BETWEEN AUSTRALIA AND<br />
ARE YOU CONCERNED THAT THAT KIND OF PROTECTIONIST COLOURED FAME<br />
CAN ALSO AFFECT AUSTRALIA AS WELL?<br />
ANSWER: WELL LET ME MAKE IT CLEAR, WE HAVE NOT ASKED AT ALL AND WILL<br />
NOT ASK FOR ANY TRADE RETALIATION ON THE PART OF THE UNITED STATES.<br />
AND I MADE IT CLEAR I HOPE IN ANSWER TO THE PREVIOUS QUESTION THAT WE<br />
WOULD NOT SEEK A RESIDUAL BENEFIT FOR AUSTRALIA ON ANY DECISION THAT<br />
MAY BE TAKEN. AND WHEN I SAY MAY BE TAKEN, I REPEAT WHAT I SAID<br />
BEFORE, WE HAVEN'T ASKED FOR NOR WILL I ASK FOR ANY TO BE TAKEN.<br />
QUESTION: WHAT I'M ASKING YOU IS IT SOME SORT OF MEASURES ARE TAKEN<br />
BY CONGRESS OR ATTEMPTED TO BE TAKEN, ARE YOU CONCERNED THAT SOME<br />
SORT OF MEASURES LIKE THAT COULD ALSO BE TAKEN AGAINST AUSTRALIA IN<br />
THE WAKE OF THE DISAGREEMENT BETWEEN AUSTRALIA AND THE U. S. OVER THE<br />
MX MISSILE?<br />
ANSWER: IT IS QUITE CLEARLY UNDERSTOOD BY THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE<br />
UNITED STATES THAT THERE IS NO ANALOGY BETWEEN THE TWO CIRCUMSTANCES<br />
( INTERRUPTION FROM AUDIENCE)<br />
PRIME MINISTER: YES? / 8 </p>
<p>0. W H59706<br />
( U E 7TION: T ERE IS QUITE A DIFFERENCE THIS TIME BETWEEN THE FEELING<br />
YOUR LAST VISIT WHAT'S HAPPENED ON THIS VISIT? ARE YOU<br />
(-APPOI4TEL WITH THIS?<br />
ANSWER: No) I'M NOT. I WOULD HAVE HOPED THAT ALTHOUGH I'M STILL<br />
EXTRAORDINARILY TIRED BUT MY INITIAL STATEMENT IS CLEAR AND<br />
UNEQUIVOCAL, AND IF YOU HAD HEARD, LISTENED TO THAT STATEMENT, IT HAD<br />
PROVIDED THE ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION.<br />
c; UESTIC:) N: MR PRIME MINISTER, WHY SHOULD THE UNITED STATES NOT<br />
CONSIDER NEW ZEALAND AND FOR THAT MATTER AUSTRALIA TO HAVE DIMISHED<br />
" 0 ANY DEGREE AS AN ALLY BECAUSE OF THE ACTIONS THE TWO GOVERNMENTS<br />
IAVE TAKEN, NEW ZEALAND ON THE SHIPS AND YOUR GOVERNMENT ON THE MX<br />
TRACKING? ANSWER: WELL AGAIN I UNDERSTAND FROM THE BRIEFING THAT'S ALREADY<br />
EUiEEN GIVEN THE ANSWER'S MADE QUITE CLEAR. WE SEE IT AND WE<br />
UNDERSTAND IT AND IT'S ACCEPTED BY THE UNITED STATES. IN REGARD TO<br />
THE ANZUS TREATY, WHAT YOU HAVE THERE IS A CONTINUING REALTIONSHIP<br />
FROM 1951A. A VERY LONG STANDING ARRANGEMENTS WHICH HAVE INVOLVED THE<br />
FACILITIES FOR SHIPS FORM THE UNITED STATES. THAT'S ONE ASPECT OF<br />
IT, AND THE CESSATION OF A PROVISION OF THAT FACILITY CREATES<br />
AN OBVIOUS CONTINUING, IN REGARD TO THE OTHER ISSUE BETWEEN THE<br />
UNITED STATES AND OURSELVES, THERE WAS A MUTUALLY ARRIVED AT POSITION<br />
IN REGARD TO A ONE-OFF SITUATION AND THE DIFFERENCES I WOULD SUGGEST<br />
ARE FAIRLY OBVIOUS.<br />
QUESTION: MR HAWKE DID YOU EXPLAIN TO OR GIVE ANY COMMENT TO THE<br />
AMERICANS AT ALL ON WHAT YOU THOUGHT ON THE POSSIBLE CUTTING OFF OF<br />
INTELLIGENCE SHARING WITH NEW ZEALAND AND IF THIS IN FACT HAPPENS<br />
DOES THAT MEAN THAT AUSTRALIA WOULD HAVE TO CUT OFF INTELLIGENCE AS<br />
WELL SO AS NOT TO CIRUCMSTANCE THE U. S. POSITION?<br />
ANSWER: THE AREA THAT YOU TALK ABOUT WAS DISCUSSED AND THE UNITED<br />
STATES MADE IT QUITE CLEAR THAT THEY HAVE NOT MADE A DECISION ON THIS<br />
MATTER: THEY HAVE MADE NO DECISION TO CUT-OFF INTELLIGENCE AND WE<br />
OBVIOUSLY DON'T SEEK TO INTERFERE IN THAT AREA. IT'S A MATTER FOR<br />
THEM TO DECIDE AND THEN ONCE THEY HAVE MADE THEIR DECISION THEN WE<br />
WILL BE INFORMED I GUESS OF THE PROCESSES AND OF THE DECISION AND WE<br />
DEAL WITH THAT WHEN IT ARISES, IT HASN'T ARISEN YET.<br />
QUESTION: INAUDIBLE WHAT YOU THOUGHT WOULD HAPPEN HAS HAPPENED.<br />
ANSWER: I DIDN'T SEEK TO INFLUENCE THEM IN THEIR DECISION, I SAID<br />
THAT'S A MATTER FOR THEM.<br />
QUESTION: PRIME MINISTER, IF NEW ZEALAND CONTINUES TO DIG IN WHATS<br />
GOING TO HAPPEN?<br />
ANSWER: I THINK TO SOME EXTENT I'VE DWELT ON THAT BEFORE, LET ME GO<br />
TO THE ELEMENTS THAT I THINK ARE IMPORTANT. THE TREATY WILL NOT BE<br />
ABBROGATED, NEW ZEALAND WILL NOT BE FACING A SITUATION WHERE BECAUSE<br />
OF THEIR ACTION AUSTRALIA. AND THE UNITED STATES HAVE TORN UP THE<br />
TREATY AND CREATED A NEW RELATIONSHIP UNDER SOME NEW TREATY. SO THE<br />
TREATY WILL REMAIN THERE READY FOR THE RESUMPTION OF FULL OPERATIONS<br />
BETWEEN THE THREE OF US, IF AND'WHEN THE GOVERNMENT OF NEW ZEALAND<br />
WERE TO CHANGE ITS POSITION. AND I'VE MERELY SAID AGAIN THAT AS FAR<br />
AS WE'RE CONCERNED WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE BRINGING PRESSURE ON THE<br />
GOVERNMENT OF NEW ZEALAND, IT'S FOR THEM, AND WOULD BE IMPROPER FOR<br />
ME TO SPECULATE WHAT WILL HAPPEN WITHIN NEW ZEALAND., NOT ONLY<br />
IMPROPER BUT WOULD BE ILL-INFORMED, I'VE GOT NO IDEA WHAT WILL HAPPEN<br />

IHEE. WHAT WE REGARD AS IMPORTANT IS THAT-WE SHOULD RETAIN FRIENDLY<br />
F. ELATIONS AND EFFECTIVE RELATIONS WITH THE GOVERNMENT OF NEW<br />
Z!: EAL* AND. ITS IMPORTANT TO US THAT THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT<br />
THROUGH THE PRESIDENT HAS SAID THEY STILL REGARD NEW ZEALAND AS A<br />
FRIEND. NOW ONE CAN ONLY EXPRESS THE HOPE THAT IN THOSE<br />
CIRCUMSTANCES AT SOMETIME DOWN THE TRACK WE'LL BE ABLE TO RESUME A<br />
FULL NORMAL BILATERAL RELATIONSHIP.<br />
QlUESTION:. WHY DO YOU HAVE NO PLANS TO PRESSURE NEW ZEALAND, AND DO<br />
YOU HAVE ANY PLANS TO MEET WITH THE OFFICIALS OF THE GOVERNMENT TO<br />
PASS ALONG SOME OF THE DISCUSSION THAT YOU HAVE HAD HERE IN THE<br />
UNITED STATES?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: TO? WHAT?<br />
QUESTION: DO YOU PLAN TO MEET WITH OFFICIALS OF THE NEW ZEALAND<br />
GOVERNMENT TO AT LEAST DISCUSS WHAT WAS TALKED ABOUT HERE IN THE<br />
UNITED STATES REGARDING THEIR ACTION?<br />
ANSWER? THERE IS NO SPECIFIC PLANS BEEN BROUGHT. UP, B3UT I'M QUITE<br />
CERTAIN THAT THERE WILL BE DISCUSSION BETWEEN OUR OFFICIALS AND I<br />
THINK PROBABLY BETWEEN OUR MINISTERS. t 41pe' iv.. </p>
