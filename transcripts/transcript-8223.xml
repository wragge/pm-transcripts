TRANSCRIPT OF UNEDITED INTERVIEW WITH PAUL LYNEHAM,<br />
7.30 REPORT, 4 DECEMBER 1990<br />
E OE PROOF ONLY<br />
LYNEHAM: Prime Minister, welcome again to the program.<br />
PM: Thank you very much Paul.<br />
LYNEHAM: Why is it in Australia's direct national interest<br />
to become involved in potential war so far from our shores?<br />
PM: Because we are now in a new era, after the Cold War,<br />
where it's important that the international community<br />
establishes its authority through the United Nations to<br />
ensure that aggression will never be condoned or acquiesced<br />
in. If Australia, in the future, or any of Australia's<br />
neighbours who want the assistance of the international<br />
community through the United Nations, we have to make sure,<br />
by our actions now, that the authority and the capacity of<br />
the United Nations is established. This is something that<br />
was envisaged from the very beginning in 1945 by Dr Evatt,<br />
who was one of the important foundation originators.<br />
LYNEHAM: It hasn't happened that often though, sir, has it?<br />
PM: No, because in the Cold War period, in the whole of the<br />
Cold War period the Security Council was never able to<br />
operate because every conflict was in the context of a<br />
superpower conflict and there was always the threat, if not<br />
the actuality, of the veto.<br />
LYNEHAM: So dLo you see this now, perhaps, as a sort of<br />
precedent for keeping the peace in a post-Cold War world?<br />
PM: Yes, indeed. One would hope beyond it being a<br />
precedent that any would-be aggressor will now see that<br />
there is a determination on the part of the world community<br />
not to tolerate aggression.<br />
LYNEHAM: What of those who say, if sanctions were<br />
worthwhile in the first place why not keep them in place<br />
until Saddam Hussein backs down?<br />
PM: Well there is an indefiniteness about that. What the<br />
sanctions were intended to do was to convey, in the<br />
strongest possible way it was thought, a clear message to<br />
Saddam Hussein. It wasn't intended to, as I said in my </p>
<p>statement to the House, to starve the Iraqi people but there<br />
is no evidence that Saddam Hussein has got that message and<br />
so the international community has said a stronger message<br />
must be given.<br />
LYNEHAM: The extension of the operational role of our<br />
ships. They move first, if I understand it correctly, from<br />
the Gulf of Oman up into the Persian Gulf to exercise with<br />
the allied vessels.<br />
PM: That's correct.<br />
LYNEHAM: Does that amount to a commitment to fight?<br />
PM: Well what it does is this; it's a commitment and<br />
immediate response by the Australian Government to the<br />
specific request made in the United Nations Security Council<br />
Resolution to Member States to provide support. Now our<br />
naval forces are there and they have been there in the Gulf<br />
of Oman to, in fact, give effect to enforcing the sanctions.<br />
Now that role is, in fact, substantially finished for some<br />
time now because there is no movement of ships through<br />
there. Now what the Security Council has said is that there<br />
will be preparedness to use force after the 15th of January<br />
if there hasn't been acquiescence. Now what our ships,<br />
therefore, are going to do now is to go up and to exercise<br />
with the ships of the United States, Britain and Canada.<br />
There will be a fairly massive aircraft carrier grouping<br />
there. Our ships have the particular capacity through their<br />
equipment and their training to provide escort capacity.<br />
They will go up there it would be the worst thing you<br />
could possibly, do is to say; oh well they'll be available if<br />
you want them when the whistle blows, because that would be<br />
dangerous both~ in terms of maximising efficiency of your<br />
asset but most: importantly, as well, in maximising the<br />
safety of your men on your ships.<br />
LYNEHAN: Of getting our people up to speed?<br />
PM: Sure, yes.<br />
LYNEHAM: They would, therefore, though be within missile<br />
range, wouldn't they..<br />
PM: Yes. I made no attempt to disguise in the House, in<br />
fact I asserted quite clearly, that this is going to be<br />
potentially very dangerous.<br />
LYNEHAM: You also said our ships would be under Australian<br />
national command but US operational control. Now how does<br />
that work Prime Minister?<br />
PM: It works -this way; that in the end we retain the<br />
command, the national command. Our decision is operative as<br />
to whether they are there or not. Of course it was<br />
envisaged at the time of the Security Council Resolution<br />
where you've got ships of the United States Navy and<br />
that's the overwhelming and the largest force there and </p>
<p>the Canadians, and the British up there at the sharp end, if<br />
you like, and where we're going of running their own<br />
game. It was envisaged and understood that there would be<br />
operational control. So what we do in advance is that we<br />
work out the operational rules, we do that, our relevant<br />
defence people do that with the United States, and then our<br />
commanders ensure that if operations occur that we are<br />
operating according to those rules. If they have any reason<br />
to believe that the rules are not being adhered to, we're<br />
being asked to do something not agreed on in the operation,<br />
also we'd need to refer that back.<br />
LYNEHAM: Well what sort of roles do you envisage for these<br />
vessels? PM: Well they are part of the air defence, they provide<br />
part of the air defence capacity for the force there.<br />
LYNEHAM: Could they be involved in escorting landing craft,<br />
in case say of the landing on Kuwait or bombarding shore<br />
facilities, things like that?<br />
PM: Well what is basically envisaged, I mean they are going<br />
to be there to perform the roles which are appropriate in<br />
those circumstances, but really what they are best and most<br />
appropriately equipped for is to provide part of the air<br />
defence cover.<br />
LYNEHAM: You said in your statement; it is not proposed to<br />
make any other contribution of naval, ground or air forces.<br />
PM: Yes, those were the words I used, and I said, to fine<br />
that up, that this commitment that we're making is<br />
significant, it's proportional to our interests and it is<br />
practical and that is the right way to describe it.<br />
LYNEHAM: Was this forced on you by the factions<br />
PM: No, I mean<br />
LYNEHAM: inaudible<br />
PM: I don't want to get political about this but I must say<br />
that I was totally appalled by the incapacity of the Leader<br />
of the Opposition on a matter of such profound importance to<br />
this country t~ hat he couldn't leave miserable party politics<br />
out of it in his response. It was suggested that this<br />
position that I've put, on behalf of the Government and the<br />
people of Australia, is something forced upon me by<br />
factionalism. I and my leadership colleagues, and the<br />
Minister for Defence, and the minister for Foreign Affairs,<br />
we examine thi~ s thing closely and thoroughly with the input<br />
from the Minister for Defence coming from his discussions<br />
with the defence people. Out of all those processes<br />
LYNEHAN: That was an executive decision? </p>
<p>PM: That was the leadership. I had a meeting with Senator<br />
Button and Paul Keating and myself and Evans, they are the<br />
four leaders in the Parliament and I also had Senator Ray.<br />
Out of this whole process our clear decision was that what<br />
was significant, proportional and practical was the<br />
commitment that I announced in the House. Now and let me<br />
say that whenL I put that to the Caucus today it was<br />
accepted, I think as I understand it, without dissent.<br />
LYNEHAM: Because some Caucus Members were saying, Prime<br />
Minister, tha~ t they feared a sort of open-ended Vietnam<br />
style PM: But it's not only-Members of the Caucus. Let's be<br />
quite clear. What we're talking about here is the<br />
commitment of Australian naval forces into a potential war<br />
situation. Now anyone who's got any concern for their<br />
country and its interests are going to think very seriously<br />
about that. What is appropriate to be done there is to do<br />
what I've said. The words I used in the House were the<br />
appropriate words. You must be significant, you must be<br />
proportionate, you must be practical. That is how we<br />
estimate that contribution to be made. In our assessment I<br />
am able to say on that basis that it's not proposed to make<br />
any additional commitments. The question was raised in the<br />
Caucus; well may there be more? if so, will there be<br />
discussion? I answered to that; I don't expect that<br />
there'll be more, that's why I make this statement that no<br />
more is proposed. If there were circumstances that arose<br />
where we needed to consider more then of course there would<br />
be a discussion and there would be a further statement<br />
LYNEHAM: So an upgrading of the forces is not out of the<br />
question? PM: Well I don't believe it will happen and that's what the<br />
nature of the statement is. I'm simply saying I've conveyed<br />
to my colleagues and if I think it would be implicit in<br />
the statement I made that if some particular circumstance<br />
arose where a request was made, then we would consider it<br />
but there would be no expectation on our part, no<br />
expectation on our part that there is going to be such a<br />
request because let it be remembered for a nation of 17<br />
million peoplEt the commitment of 3 vessels like this is a<br />
very, very significant commitment and it's a very practical<br />
one because WE, have the equipment on those ships and the<br />
training with those other navies which enables us to go with<br />
them and perfcorm a very important task. It is a very<br />
significant co'ntribution that Australia's made.<br />
LYNEHAM: Two more Australian medical teams will join the<br />
hospital ships in the Gulf. How many Australian casualties<br />
have been predicted in the event of a war?<br />
PM: Well we haven't got any precision on what Australian<br />
casualties there will be in a war. I mean there have been<br />
figures that have been bruited around in regard to the<br />
Americans if they were involved </p>
<p>LYNEHAM: It's very frightening figures.<br />
PM: Some reasonably frightening well war is a frightening<br />
thing. You don't have war without casualties. That's why<br />
we don't want: war if we can possibly avoid it.<br />
LYNEHAM: Whatever the outcome, some critics will say you<br />
will agree with this that you know they'll say that you've<br />
risked Australian lives to cater to American interests.<br />
PM: I dealt with that in the House and I said this was an<br />
absurdity, as it is. The facts show that it's an absurdity.<br />
Look at the sponsorship of the United Nations Security<br />
Council Resolution. The sponsors were these are the<br />
sponsors; the United States, the Soviet Union, France,<br />
Britain and Canada and Romania and with twelve countries<br />
voting for, one abstention, two against Cuba and Yemen.<br />
Now you can't possibly say in those circumstances and given<br />
the unanimity there's been on so many of the United Nations<br />
Security Council Resolutions that this is the United States.<br />
We're fortunate that the United States, the wealthiest and<br />
most powerful nation, is taking an important role which is<br />
supported by the Soviet Union and by right across the<br />
spectrum of nations. The interests of the world are at<br />
stake here as well as the interests of the United States.<br />
LYNEHAM: Did you ever think of delaying or postponing<br />
today's statement because of the suggestions that our<br />
hostages might soon be free?<br />
PM: That occurred to me but then it was quite obvious,<br />
Paul, that that would be the wrong decision. We came to the<br />
conclusion that the decision regard the commitment of our<br />
forces was the right one, it needed to be taken. It was<br />
suggested that well they may be an announcement of their<br />
release might come in 24 hours. You look first of all at<br />
the practicalities and I do this within the situation let<br />
me say of putt~ ing to your listeners that every day the<br />
position of our hostages has been on my mind. Our people<br />
have been working there relentlessly and we've changed the<br />
situation from the 2nd August, when there was 170 people<br />
there where it:' s 30 now. Every woman and child who's wanted<br />
to leave has been able to leave. It's now got from 170 down<br />
to 30 people that are there.<br />
LYNEHAM: What: if they say we were going to let them go but<br />
Hawke made this statement-<br />
PM: I'm coming to that but I'm putting it against the<br />
context of a Government that's worked through its officials,<br />
not within the glare of publicity. We have been working to<br />
reduce and reduce the number of people there. Now let's say<br />
I'd waited for 24 hours and in that 24 hours they'd said<br />
well we're going to release your hostages and then I'd said<br />
alright now I'll make the statement. The hostages are still<br />
there, they don't get out immediately so what happens? They<br />
just get retained. I mean that's the worst possible thing </p>
<p>that if we said we were going to release them and then oh<br />
now, your Prime Minister's made a statement, we'll hold them<br />
again. The second point I make is that the Iraqi Ambassador<br />
here in Australia yesterday made a clear statement that he<br />
didn't believe that the Prime Minister's statement would be<br />
making any difference.<br />
LYNEHAM: And finally, given the information available to<br />
you, how do you now think this will be resolved?<br />
PM: Good question. Let me express my hope first and then<br />
how I think the odds are. My profound hope, of course, is<br />
that Saddam Hussein will withdraw and meet the requirements<br />
of the United Nations. That is both my hope and I think on<br />
balance although one cannot be certain I think on<br />
balance he'd more likely than not that before the 15 January<br />
he will meet the requirements of the United Nations. We<br />
can't be sure of that but the one thing I think we can be<br />
certain of is that we maximise our chances of getting that<br />
decision by having the decision of the United Nations<br />
Security Council we have and by Australia and like-minded<br />
countries giving the support to that Resolution that we<br />
have. LYNEHAM: Thanks for your time, Prime Minister.<br />
PM: Thank you very much indeed.<br />
