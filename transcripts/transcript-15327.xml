<p>It has undoubtedly been one of the most warming experiences of the Australian nation, particularly of those generations who fought in the wars in which this country has been involved to see over the last 10 or 20 years a resurgence of affection for and observance of ANZAC Day. The extraordinary scenes of thousands of young Australians going to Gallipoli Peninsula on ANZAC Day, the growing numbers of young people attending ANZAC Day services sends a very powerful message of reassurance to all generations of Australians that this most special of all Australian days will always be at the centre of our national life. </p>
<p>And as we search for a meaning and an explanation for this great affection, it lies not only in the enormous debt that can never be repaid, but those of us who are fortunate enough to live in Australia in 2007 owe to the more than 100,000 of our fellow Australians who gave their lives in all the wars in which this nation has been involved and on this day we particularly remember the extraordinary sacrifice that they made; so many of them, so very, very young. And one of the most moving experiences anyone can have is to visit the war cemeteries of Gallipoli, of northern France, of Singapore, of the Middle East and all around the world where the heroic deeds of Australians are honoured and remembered.</p>
<p>But in addition to our sense of gratitude and that sense of owing a debt that can never be repaid, there is another reason why ANZAC Day will always be at the centre of the affections and the observance of what it means to be an Australian. And that is the values that the ANZAC tradition represent in our national life. Those values of courage, of mateship, of irreverence and larrikinism where that was appropriate; of sterling discipline and tenacious commitment when that was appropriate and a willingness to risk all for the defence of the country we love and the people we love.  And it is the values of ANZAC Day as well as the sense of gratitude and remembrance that make it a special day in our national life. And as the years go by, so far from the tradition and the legend of ANZAC diminishing, it will occupy an evermore hallowed place in the recollection and the observance of this country.</p>
<p>Now on this day we simply, all of us who owe so much to those who did and in many cases 100,000 fold gave their all, we say our thank you. We will never forget them. May they always rest in peace.</p>
