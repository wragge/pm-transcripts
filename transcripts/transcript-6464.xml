EXCERPT FROM JOINT PRESS CONFERENCE THE PRIME MINISTER,<br />
MR R J L HAWKE AND THE MINISTER FOR SPORT, TOURISM AND<br />
RECREATION, MR JOHN BROWN 13 September 1984<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, Mr Brown has talked about the<br />
lead your Government has given in financing sport, what does<br />
it say about your Government's priorities, at the same time,<br />
to effectively cut back on scientific research in the CSIRO?<br />
PM: Well, unfortunately the premise of your question is wrong<br />
because we haven't done that. We haven't matched the<br />
expectations of some people at this stage. But let me make<br />
the point that in respect of CSIRO in particular when you<br />
take account of the rundown of capital works that were<br />
being completed, there is still a significant increase<br />
in funding. Let me make this fundamental point, which TI<br />
really don't want to be intruding here, it's a question<br />
that's more appropriate for later, but it's been raised,<br />
I'll answer it. What I have been saying, and others have<br />
been saying for some time that the basic problem in Australia<br />
is not so much one of pure research because all conmentators<br />
including Professor Slatyer, the Chairman of ASTEC, has said<br />
we rate very well really with the rest of the world. Our<br />
great problem has been in the area of applying research, and<br />
in that area the Government has been extremely productive and<br />
generous in the initiatives that it has taken and without<br />
beinq exhaustive you know what we have done in regard to<br />
management investment companies to allow very considerable<br />
tax deductions for venture capital in that area. What we<br />
have done to revamp the AIDC and what we have done in other<br />
areas of fiscal policy which are relevant there, What we<br />
have done in respect of the whole incentives to industry.<br />
Those are the areas where Australia has ben lacking. And<br />
in so far as the balance in Australia nas been concerned<br />
the deficiency has been in the initiatives by Government<br />
and the taking up by industry of the responsiaility to<br />
apply the research that ha s beer undertaken here and elsewhere.<br />
So I don't accept that there has been any perversion of<br />
priorities. The refuatveisde ncteh at. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, could I follow up my question<br />
on priorities. John Brown is hapy, Barry Jones is whinging.<br />
Doesn't that say something about the Government's priorities.<br />
Do you believe there are more votes in sport than science and<br />
has that influenced your Government?<br />
PM: The answer to the last question is no it hasn't. For<br />
a long time, in public life, I have been saying that I thought<br />
successive governments, and that criticism has been true of<br />
both sides of politics, have not realised the importance of<br />
sport. It's not to be seen simply as something through which<br />
we get a vicarious thrill when our athletes do better than<br />
anyone else in the world. Although, I must say in that respect,<br />
that if the community does derive, as it manifestly did, as you<br />
saw in the Olympics, satisfaction out of the achievement of<br />
excellence, then it has always-seemed to me that there is<br />
a responsibility in the community. If it derives that<br />
vicarious satisfaction to accept some responsibility for<br />
it. But as I say I have historically taken the view that<br />
the politicians of both sides the fence haven't realised the<br />
importance of sport. We live in a world in which leisure is<br />
going to be more widespread, in which the pressures of the<br />
working environment increase in a number of ways. So it is<br />
important that as many people as possible have the opportunity<br />
of participating, I believe, in sport. And it is the case that<br />
Government should have a role, the sort of role that we have<br />
developed, whereby we accept a certain financial responsibility<br />
but also where we assume the role of catalyst which is going<br />
to be done with the establishment of the Sports Aid Foundation.<br />
So I would have thought that my long record of public<br />
exposition on these matters shows that there is not some<br />
question of electoral priority taking over as far as I<br />
am concerned. There is also the consideration that, it<br />
seems fairly obvious, that the more Australians, who are<br />
more actively participating in sports, associated leisure<br />
activities, the more likely you are to have a healthier<br />
community. And in that respect, I would remind you that<br />
the estimate per annum of the costs of industrial accidents<br />
and illnesses is about $ 6 billion. That's the estimate.<br />
Now, if you can get a healthier, more vibrant community<br />
then it is likely that you are going to be saving in those<br />
areas. So for all those reasons that I have put, I don't<br />
believe that any government has any reason to apologise<br />
for taking initiatives in these areas, which for too long,<br />
have been neglected by governments of varying political<br />
persuasions. Now, that's that part of the question, what<br />
we're doing about sport. In regard to the area of technology<br />
and research, you attempt to bring Mr Jones into it. Now<br />
Mr Jones has said that he recognises the constraints that<br />
apply but he also has made the point correctly that if you<br />
are going to look at what the government has done in respect<br />
of the areas of science and technology, it's just not a<br />
question of looking at his direct budget allocations, lie<br />
has made the point that I have made, that you have got to<br />
look at what we have done in these other areas. I repeat<br />
then what we have done in regard to management invcst-ent<br />
companies. What we have done in regard to the AIDC. . h
we have done in regard to the Commonw,, ealth Development Ban-..<br />
And our whole approch in the fiscal area to make it casier<br />
for the cash flow of comp. nijcs to be available to urnd\ c-'.::
</p><p>3.<br />
PM cont: the sort of applied research that is necessary<br />
if we are translate the existing fairly high levels of<br />
research into effective, commercial and economic action.<br />
So, I say that we have taken initiatives and give, i<br />
priorities where they should be given in the area of<br />
science and research. At the same time we have picked<br />
up an area of government involvement which has for far<br />
too long been too much neglected. </p>
