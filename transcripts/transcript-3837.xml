PRIME MINISTER'S QUEENSLAND BROADCAST NO.<br />
QUALITY OF LIFE<br />
SUNDAY. 3 AUGUST 1975<br />
IT'S NO SECRET THAT OUR. NEXT BUDGET WILL PUT<br />
SOME PRETTY TIGHT RESTRAINTS ON GOVERNMENT SPENDING1<br />
BUT THAT DOESN'IT MEAN WE WON'IT BE SPENDING ON THINGS THAT<br />
MATTER, OUR OPPONENTS ARE VERY FOND OF KNOCKING ANY<br />
SORT OF GOVERNMENT EXPENDITURE, AS IF ALL GOVERNMENT<br />
EXPENDITURE WERE WASTEFUL AND UNNECESSARY, WE HAVE TO<br />
REMEMBER THAT THE LIBERALS IN OFFICE WASTED MILLIONS OF<br />
DOLLARS IN GRANTS TO WEALTHY SCHOOLS, EXPENSIVE SUBSIDIES<br />
TO CERTAIN INDUSTRIES AND SUCH EXTRAVAGANCIES AS THE<br />
F-ill. IT'S QUITE ABSURD WHEN THE QUEENSLAND PREMIER<br />
AND THE COUNTRY PARTY PUBLICLY ADVOCATE NUCLEAR WEAPONS<br />
AND MISSILE SYSTEMS FOR AUSTRALIA THE SORT OF THINGS<br />
THAT WOULD COST BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IF WE'WERE MAD ENOUGH<br />
TO TAKE THEIR ADVICE AND THEN COMPLAIN ABOUT' LABOR'S<br />
SOCIAL WELFARE PROG RAMS AND GRANTS TO THE ARTS. THIS<br />
CONSTANT WHINGEING ABOUT GRANTS TO THE ARTS IS ONE VERY<br />
GOOD EXAMPLE OF OUR OPPONENTS HATRED OF ANYTHING THAT<br />
REALLY IMPROVES THE LIVES AND OPPORTUNITIES OF ORDINARY<br />
PEOPLE, ESPECIALLY MINORITY GROUPS IN THE COMMUNITY, </p>
<p>2.<br />
THE FACT IS THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAS A NUMBER<br />
OF PROGRAMS DESIGNED TO MAKE LIFE HAPPIER AND MORE<br />
ENJOYABLE FOR PEOPLE IN SMALL, AND SOME WOULD SAY,<br />
RATHER UNUSUAL WAYS. WE SEE THESE AS AN ESSENTIAL<br />
PART OF THE GOVERNMENT'S WORK. GOVERNMENT ISN'T<br />
JUST A MATTER OF PROVIDING ROADS AND PENSIONS AND<br />
EDUCATION, WE WANT TO DO WHAT WE CAN TO ENLIVEN AND<br />
INVIGORATE PEOPLE'IS LIVE* S, TO MAKE SURE THAT THE<br />
REWARDS AND SATISFACTIONS OF THE ARTS, AND DECENT<br />
OPPORTUNI-TIES FOR SPORT AND RECREATION AND HOLIDAYS,,<br />
ARE SHARED BY AS MANY PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE AND NOT JUST<br />
BY A FORTUNATE ELITE. AND THE TRUTH IS THAT IN THE<br />
TOTAL SCHEME OF GOVERNMENT EXPENDITURE THESE EFFORTS<br />
ARE ACTUALLY VERY, VERY INEXPENSIVE. OUR TOTAL BUDGET<br />
FOR THE ARTS, FOR EXAMPLE, HAS BEEN $ 20 MILLION. THAT'S<br />
LESS THAN ONE-TENTH OF ONE PER CENT OF THE GROSS<br />
DOMESTIC PRODUCT. THE IDEA THAT SUCH EXPENDITURES ARE<br />
INFLATIONARY IN THEMSELVES IS TOO SILLY FOR WORDS,<br />
THE QUESTION IS WHETHER ANY SUCH EXPENDITURE SHOULD BE<br />
A PART OF A GOVERNMENT'S OVERALL ACTIVITY, I CERTAINLY<br />
BELIEVE IT SHOULD. THE FACT THAT THE LIBERALS DID NEXT<br />
TO NOTHING IN THESE FIELDS DOESN'IT MAKE THEM UNIMPORTANT,<br />
t v s/ 3 </p>
<p>3.<br />
I SHOULD MAKE IT CLEAR THAT THE GOVERNMENT<br />
ITSELF DOESN'T DECIDE WHAT GRANTS SHOULD BE MADE FOR<br />
THE ARTS, THIS IS NOW IN THE HANDS OF THE AUSTRALIA<br />
COUNCILI AN INDEPENDENT BODY IT USED TO BE CALLED<br />
THE AUSTRALIAN COUNCIL FOR THEARTS WHICH THE<br />
GOVERNMENT SET UP AS A STATUTORY AUTHORITY, OF<br />
COURSE IT RECEIVES AN ANNUAL BUDGET FROM THE GOVERNMENT,<br />
BUT JUST HOW THOSE FUNDS ARE SPENT IS FOR THE COUNCIL,<br />
WITH ITS OWN BOARDS AND EXPERT ADVISERS TO DECIDE, I<br />
RECALL SOME LOUD CRIES OF ANGUISH NOT LONG AGO WHEN<br />
THE COUNCIL MADE A GRANT OF $ 500 TO A DAHLIA FESTIVAL<br />
IN VICTORIA, WELL, I SUPPOSE IT'S EASY TO MAKE FUN OF<br />
PEOPLE WHOSE INTERESTS AREN'T CONFINED TO RACING AND<br />
THE STOCK MARKETI BUT THE PARTICULAR FESTIVAL TO WHICH<br />
THAT GRANT WAS APPLIED HAPPENS TO BE THE ANNUAL OCCASION<br />
OF CENTRAL IMPORTANCE IN THE LIFE OF THE WHOLE BENDIGO<br />
REGION, WE ALL HAVE DIFFERENT TASTES AND INTERESTS<br />
AND IT'S PART OF OUR POLICY TO GIVE ENCOURAGEMENT AND<br />
EXPRESSION TO DIVERSE AND EVEN OFF-BEAT ACTIVITIES<br />
IF THEY HAVE A LEGITIMATE FOLLOWING AND CAN ENRICH<br />
THE LIVES OF OUR CITIZENS, IT DOESN'T COST MUCH,<br />
BUT THE RETURNS ARE VERY GREAT, 1 1/ 4 </p>
<p>LET ME GIVE A FEW EXAMPLES OF WHAT THE<br />
AUSTRALIA COUNCIL HAS DONE IN QUEENSLAND, THE MAJOR<br />
ARTS GRANTS GO TO THE BIG THEATRE AND BALLET COMPANIES<br />
AND ORCHESTRAS, BUT IT ISN'IT JUST A MATTER OF FUNDING<br />
HIGHBROW PURSUITS IN THE BIG CITIES. SMALLER GRANTS<br />
HAVE GONE TO THEATRE AND DANCE COMPANIES IN OUTBACK<br />
PARTS OF THE STATE, SUCH AS THE PIAREEBA REPERTORY<br />
SOCIETY, THE TOWNSVILLE LITTLE THEATRE AND THE FAR<br />
NORTH QUEENSLAND AMATEUR THEATRICAL-ASSOCIATION.<br />
M'ONEY HAS GONE TO LOCAL FESTIVALS AND COMMUNITY ARTS<br />
FESTIVALS ALL OVER QUEENSLAND, !, WE HELPED THE QUEENSLAND<br />
BALLET TOUR IN REMOTE AREAS LIKE COOKTOWN AND THURSDAY<br />
ISLAND. JAZZ, FOLK MUSIC AND ABORIGINAL ARTS ARE SUPPORTED<br />
AS WELL, ALTOGETHER, IN 19714, THE COUNCIL MADE 259<br />
GRANTS IN QUEENSLAND WITH A TOTAL EXPENDITURE OF JUST<br />
UNDER A MILLION DOLLARS. </p>
<p>THE OTHER AREA WHERE WE ARE WORKING TO IMPROVE THE<br />
QUALITY OF LIFE AND PEOPLE IS OPPORTUNITIES FOR<br />
FULFILMENT AND ENJOYMENT IS TOURISM AND RECREATION,<br />
WE SET UP A NEW DEPARTMENT OF TOURISM AND RECREATION<br />
AS SOON AS THE GOVERNMENT CAME TO OFFICE. IT'S<br />
SURPRISING HOW MUCH CAN BE DONE WITH SMALL SUMS APPLIED<br />
CAREFULLY FOR LOCAL PURPOSES. IT'S NOT NECESSARILY A<br />
MATTER OF BUILDING VAST STADIUMS THOUGH SOMETIMES BIG<br />
PROJECTS ARE INVOLVED BUT MAINLY IT IS HELPING LOCAL<br />
GROUPS AND AUTHORITIES IMPROVE EXISTING FACILITIESA<br />
NEW CHANGEROOM, AN EXTRA TENNIS COURT, FLOODLIGHTING<br />
FOR AN OVAL. HERE ARE SOME EXAMPLES: $ 4000 TO PURCHASE<br />
A BUILDING FOR A YOUTH CENTRE AT CHARTERS TOWERS.<br />
$ 6000 FOR SQUASH COURTS AT WINTON, $ 42,000 FOR TENNIS<br />
AND BASKETBALL COURTS AT GLADSTONE, $ 8000 FOR A STADIUM<br />
AT rARYBOROUGH. IN ADDITION, WE' RE DEVELOPING A NUMBER<br />
OF NATIONAL PARKS, MUSEUMS AND HISTORIC SITES IN QUEENSLAND<br />
TO IMPROVE THEM AS TOURIST RESORTS SO THAT ALL AUSTRALIANS<br />
CAN ENJOY THE NATURAL BEAUTIES AND PLACES OF HISTORIC<br />
INTEREST WITH WHICH THIS STATE ABOUNDS. ALTOGETHER<br />
THIS PROGRAM IS COSTING. SOMETHING OVER $ 230,000 IN<br />
QUEENSLAND A TINY SUM As GOVERNMENT EXPENDITURES GO.-<br />
BUT ONE THAT IS GETTING RESULTS AND BRINGING PLEASURE<br />
TO GREAT NUMBERS OF PEOPLE. i m v/ 6 </p>
<p>QUITE FRANKLY, WE DON'T SEE THIS KIND OF OUTLAY<br />
AS FRIVOLOUS OR UNNECESSARY, LIKE EVERYTHING ELSE,<br />
THESE EXPENDITURES HAVE TO BE REVIEWED AT BUDGET TIME, BUT<br />
GRANTS OF THIS KIND HAVE AN ESSENTIAL PLACE IN THE<br />
GOVERNMENT'S THINKING, FOR ONE THING, OPPORTUNITIES<br />
FOR SPORT ARE BUILDING A MUCH HEALTHIER GENERATION<br />
FO YOUNG AUSTRALIANS, WE OUGHT TO BE ON GUARD AGAINST<br />
MEAN-SPIRITED PEOPLE WHO RESENT THE IDEA OF GAMES AND<br />
PLEASURE FOR COMMUNITIES WHICH LACK DECENT FACILITIES<br />
FOR SPORT AND RECREATION. IN THE SAME WAY, LET'S BE<br />
WARY OF THE PHILISTINES IN OUR iMIDST WHO OBJECT TO<br />
ANY GOVERNMENT ENCOURAGEMENT OF THE ARTS. WE CAN BE A<br />
PRETTY TOUGH AND CYNICAL PEOPLE WHEN IT SUITS US,<br />
BUT THERE HAS TO BE A PLACE IN ANY HEALTHY SOCIETY FOR THE<br />
INTANGIBLE THINGS THE MENTAL, INTELLECTUAL AND SPIRITUAL<br />
REWARDS THAT THE ARTS CAN BRING, ONE DAY WE MAY COME TO<br />
SEE THAT THESE ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS OF ALL, </p>
