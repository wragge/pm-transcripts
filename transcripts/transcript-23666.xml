    <content><![CDATA[<p>Excellencies, thank you so much for joining me this afternoon.</p>
<p>I particularly welcome the Ambassador of the Netherlands, given the horrific toll which the Netherlands has faced in MH17.</p>
<p>All of you, all of your countries, have lost people in this terrible, terrible event.</p>
<p>All of your countries are in grief and in mourning but all of your countries are understandably anxious that justice is done.</p>
<p>The only way for justice to be done is if we have a thorough, impartial international investigation which has full access to the site. The only way that justice can be done for the dead and for their families is if the bodies are treated with respect and dignity and are taken to a place where they can be properly handled, where things can be properly investigated, and where ultimately they can be repatriated back home.</p>
<p>We want to bring them home but first we have got to get them out. That is what the resolution which will be going to the Security Council at 3pm Monday, New York time is all about.</p>
<p>I thank you so much for being here and I do hope that all of the countries represented around this table will do everything they can to ensure that this resolution is dealt with properly and that the international community makes a strong stand for justice and decency.</p>
