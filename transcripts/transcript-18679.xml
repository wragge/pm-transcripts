PM: I've just received an update brief on this. As I'm advised, South Korea at the International Whaling Commission has announced that it's going to commence scientific whaling.</p>
<p>I am very disappointed by this announcement by South Korea. We are completely opposed to whaling, there's no excuse for scientific whaling, and I have instructed our Ambassador in Korea to raise this matter today at the highest levels of the Korean Government.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST: And what does the Government intend to do about it?</p>
<p>PM: Well we're making our voices heard today.</p>
<p>Our Ambassador will speak to counterparts in South Korea at the highest levels of the South Korean Government and indicate Australia's opposition to this decision.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Just quickly on the carbon floor price, why are you looking to change it from $15?</p>
<p>PM: Minister Combet dealt with that in the paper today. We're consulting on the floor price and there's nothing new in that.</p>
<p>Thank you very much.</p>
