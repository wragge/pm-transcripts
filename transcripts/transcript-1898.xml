FOR( PRESS: SJUL 19t" PM. A0. 7u, 1968<br />
LAWLESS DEMONSTRATIONS<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, Mr John Gorton<br />
The Commonwealth Government will not permit<br />
lawlessness, violence and destruction by mobs to occur in Australia.<br />
Violence and disruption in the streets such as we<br />
have seen in the last few days seriously interferes with the rights of<br />
ordinary citizens. These rights must be protected and interference<br />
with them by a minority is a direct attack on the only basis on which 4<br />
democracy can operate. The Attorney-General is examining all the courses<br />
open to the Commonwealth to impose severe penalties on any persons<br />
convicted of such action. I-ie is consulting with the States and when this<br />
has been done, I shall announce the results to the Australian people.<br />
We will not interfere with, but will defend the right<br />
of dissent. We will not interfere with publicly-expressed dissent.<br />
But we do not recognise violence, intimidation or interference with the<br />
rights of other citizens, or the invasion of public or private property<br />
as a right which a dissenting minority possesses but as a wrong which<br />
cannot be tolerated by the community.<br />
