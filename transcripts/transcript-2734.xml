SqS ' TATEMENT NO. 3<br />
6 December, 1972<br />
EQUAL PAY CASE<br />
The Prime Minister, Mr. Whitlam, this afternoon<br />
authorised a written application to the Industrial Registrar<br />
asking to have the recent hearing on equal pay before the Full<br />
Bench of the Arbitration Commission re-opened.<br />
The application was made after detailed consultations<br />
with Labor's Minister for Industrial Reloations, Mr. C. R. Cameron.<br />
The Commonwealth hopes that its application for a<br />
re-opening will be heard in Melbourne on Friday.<br />
Mr. Whitlam said that if the case were re-opened, the<br />
Commonwealth would give full support to the A. C. T. U. claim<br />
before the Commission on equal pay.<br />
The McMahon Government had opposed the application<br />
seeking a phasing in of new equal pay provisions.<br />
If successful, the new equal pay application would mean<br />
the extension of equal pay to women workers excluded by the<br />
Commission's 1969 judgement on the equal pay question.<br />
Women in industries employing predominantly females<br />
were excluded from the application of that judgement.<br />
The recent A. C. T. U. application, for which<br />
submissions concluded on 29 November, would remove all<br />
discrimination on the grounds of sex.<br />
