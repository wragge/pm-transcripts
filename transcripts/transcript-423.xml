IWEDNESDA P. M. No. 61/ 161<br />
Statement by thie Prime Minister, teRt. Honl, R. G. Majgi<br />
The Government now has a majority in the House of<br />
Representatives, and the probability of a stronger position in<br />
the Senate than at one stage seemed likely.<br />
Ministers met yesterday. They frankly reviewed the<br />
election and its results, ma the causes of the set-back the<br />
Government sustained, particularly in Queensland and New Soutih<br />
Wales. Subsequently, we had a meeting with private members, and<br />
wiere supported in the views which we had formed.<br />
In this brief statement, therefore, I speak with the<br />
authority of all Ministers and Members on the Government side.<br />
We acknowledge with gratitude and appreciation tb. e<br />
support which we received from those who stood behind us in<br />
difficult and unpopular policies. These policies have already<br />
had, in importLnt fields of the national economy such as the<br />
trade balances and the arresting of boom inflation, notable<br />
results. But we are quite prepared to face the facts of the<br />
election. It is clear that we have been opposed in the<br />
electorates by many people normally our supportcrs. They<br />
appear to have felt that our economic measures of last year were<br />
too severe; that we acted in too much detachment from those<br />
actually engaged in industry and banking and commerce generally;<br />
that full weight was not given to human considerations; and<br />
that we were not sufficiently conscious of unemployment. We<br />
pleaded and plead ? not guilty' to these charges; but the verdict<br />
of the jury almost went against us,<br />
Facing the position in a realistic and democratic way,<br />
we do not propose to take up rigid attitudes, cr to ignore the<br />
currents of public opinion. This does not mean that we will<br />
abandon the twin policies of stability and national development<br />
which we have been applying, with, we believe, benefit to<br />
Australia, for the last 12 years. They are vital to true human<br />
progress. But in the application of those policies, modifications<br />
of method and approach should clearly be made.<br />
To this end, we will at the earliest practicable date<br />
set up closer conta'~ s and discussions with leaders in the<br />
manufacturing and business and banking fields, to secure their<br />
first-hand views on their problems and those of the men and<br />
women employed by them, and their suggestions on how they can be<br />
solved. We will particularly desire to discuss with<br />
manufacturers the problem of tariffs and imports.<br />
We continue to desire to have full employment, and<br />
will give special and urgent attention to ways and means of<br />
getting rid of such unemployment as now exists.<br />
The question of Northern Development is one on which<br />
there has clearly been great public confusion and misunderstankg<br />
I hope that we may have an early opportunity of personal<br />
discussions with State Ministers on this important problem.<br />
We will of course. devote the closest attention to<br />
the problems involved in the Common Market negotiations, with<br />
the object of safeguarding the rural industries, whose<br />
prosperity is so vital for the nation. </p>
