PRIME MINISTER<br />
EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY<br />
LAUNCHING OF THE NATIONAL APPEAL FOR THE<br />
AUSTRALIAN-HELLENIC MEMORIAL<br />
CANBERRA 1 APRIL 1987<br />
Your ExcellIency, Your Eminence, Sir William Refshauge,<br />
Distinguiched guests, ladies and gentlemen,<br />
The last few weeks have been especially important ones for<br />
the Greek-Aunstralian community.<br />
Just over a fortnight ago, I had the pleasure of opening the<br />
Greek Australian Conference in Melbourne. This was an<br />
important conference, organised by the Victorian Government,<br />
the Greek Government and the Australian-Greek community and<br />
attended by a distinguished group of visitors from Greece<br />
including miembers of the Greek Cabinet and Parliament, and<br />
of business and academia.<br />
Last week it was Greek National Day, which was celebrated in<br />
Melbourne with the Antipodes Festival. This was the first<br />
time the Greek-Australian cultural experience had been<br />
celebrated Lnr this form and it was a great pleasure for me<br />
to speak to a huge crowd in Lonsdale Street. The festival<br />
was a magnificent success, not just for Greek-Australians<br />
but for the whole community.<br />
Then yesterday we saw Yiannis Kouros cross the finish line<br />
to win the Sydney to Melbourne ultra-marathon and winning<br />
as well, I m~ ight add, the respect of sports lovers across<br />
Australia for a nearly superhuman performance. I am fully<br />
aware that Cie word " marathon" is rooted in Greek history<br />
but Yiannis Kouros' achievement of the past week I believe<br />
at least rivals that of the original marathon runner<br />
Pheidippides.<br />
Tonight it is my pleasure to speak once more on an issue of<br />
concern to the Australian-Greek community to launch the<br />
fund raising appeal for the Australian-Hellenic Memorial.<br />
The Greek Conference, the Antipodes Festival and the<br />
Australian-H-ellenic Memorial all serve to remind us how<br />
successful have been our joint efforts to build a<br />
multicultural society which seeks to create equality of<br />
opportunity for all Australians rather than isolated<br />
privilege for a few. </p>
<p>2<br />
Those events of course remind us specifically of the size<br />
and importance of the contribution which people of Greek<br />
origin have made to the Australian community.<br />
Since the beginning of European settlement Australia and<br />
Greece have shared many experiences. Like so many of our<br />
forebears did, Greeks first arrived in this country in 1829<br />
as convicts.<br />
Since then the Greek contribution to this nation has been<br />
felt and appreciated in virtually every industry and<br />
occupation and in virtually every town and city and I am<br />
proud to saiy, it has been particularly strongly felt and<br />
appreciated in the Australian Labor Party.<br />
Part of the reason for the success of this Greek<br />
contribution to Australia is that the relationship between<br />
Australia and Greece is based on our shared commitment to<br />
the ideals of freedom and democracy ideals which we honour<br />
in peacetime and for which we have, together, demonstrated<br />
we are willing to fight to preserve.<br />
it is this aspect of our relationship we remember this<br />
evening. To thousands of former Australian servicemen, the name<br />
Greece recalls the bloody days of 1941, when mainland Greece<br />
and the island of Crete became crucial battlefields in the<br />
fight against fascism.<br />
The Australian-Hellenic Memorial is being constructed to<br />
commemorate all those who died in the Greek Campaign, both<br />
on the mainland and in the Battle for Crete.<br />
It will also commemorate those who died at sea while serving<br />
with the Royal Australian Navy and the Merchant Marine in<br />
the Mediterranean. The Royal Australian Air Force, women of<br />
the nursine cervices, special covert forces, as well as<br />
those who died on Greek soil during World War 1, will also<br />
be commemorated.<br />
And of very great significance, the Memorial will also<br />
recall the Greek civilians who risked their lives in helping<br />
Australian and other allied soldiers to safety and who, for<br />
these acts of heroism, frequently were harshly punished.<br />
These terrible experiences Australians and Greeks shared<br />
during wartime at least had this lasting benefit staunch<br />
friendships were forged in those dark days and they have<br />
endured and have been passed down to succeeding generations.<br />
The members of the RSL have long treasured this friendship.<br />
The newly-formed Greek branch of the RSED in the ACT, and its<br />
active ladies auxiliary, are powerful evidence of this.<br />
So when, Sir William, you approached the Government last<br />
year on behalf of the Australian veterans of the Greek<br />
campaign and the Greek community in Australia, with the </p>
<p>3<br />
proposal to erect an Australian-Hellenic Memorial, we were<br />
pleased to do what we could to help.<br />
we have made available a site for the Memorial at the top of<br />
Anzac Parade, opposite the War Memorial. I was proud to<br />
announce this last year on Anzac Day in Athens, and to<br />
receive the encouragement of Prime Minister Papandreou and<br />
the Greek Government.<br />
Tonight, I an pleased to launch the Fund Raising Appeal for<br />
the construction of the Memorial.<br />
The Austra'icin-Hellenic Memorial Committee intends to raise<br />
all funds ior the Memorial from the community without<br />
seeking the direct financial assistance of the Federal<br />
Government. My Government will however be helping the Appeal. I am<br />
pleased to announce we have decided to make donations to<br />
this fund deductible until 31 July 1989.<br />
Since the Committee is keen to encourage donatione of<br />
$ 10,000 or more, it has suggested that I sign certificates<br />
to be given benefactors of such gifts. am happy to do<br />
this. In raising the funds for the Memorial, the ex-service and<br />
Greek communities in Australia intend that it be a*<br />
presentation to the people of Australia in commemoration of<br />
those who fell in the cause of freedom.<br />
It is expected that the Memorial be dedicated in May 1988 as<br />
a major Bicenitennial activity and to coincide with the<br />
anniversaryT of the Battle for Crete.<br />
The Australian-Hellenic Memorial will be certainly a fitting<br />
memorial to those who fought and who sacrificed their lives<br />
in the causo of freedom.'<br />
But it will be more: it will be a symbol of the lasting<br />
ties between two great peoples, ties of friendship in the<br />
past, ties rogularly fortified today through the vigour and<br />
creativity oZ the Greek-Australian community, and ties which<br />
will endure~ into a shared and constructive future. </p>
