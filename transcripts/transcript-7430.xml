    <content><![CDATA[<p>AUSIALI A , At<br />PRIME M INISTER<br />FOR MEDIA 10 NOVEMBER 1988<br />I am pleased to announce, on the eve of Remembrance Day,<br />that the Canberra National Memorials Committee which I chair<br />has recommended t * he allocation of a site on Anzac Parade in<br />Canberra for a national memorial to Australian Vietnam<br />Forces. The provision of a site in Anzac Parade will be welcomed not<br />just by Vietnam Veterans, but also by the many Australians<br />who now increasingly acknowledge the difficulties borne by<br />those who fought in Vietnam.<br />The Welcome Home Parade in Sydney last year acted as a<br />catalyst in bringing Vietnam Veterans together and in<br />helping all Australians to reassess attitudes to Vietnam<br />Veterans. I feel sure that the construction of a memorial<br />will build upon the positive feelings fostered by the<br />Parade.<br />A recommendation for a memorial to our Vietnam Veterans was<br />contained in Mr Justice Evatt's Royal Commission Report on<br />the Use and Effects of Chemical Agents on Australian<br />Personnel in Vietnam. In May this year, in r.. esponding to Mr<br />Justice Evatt's report, the Government indicated its support<br />for the memorial. Now that a site has been earmarked, the<br />Australian Vietnam Forces National Memorials Committee can<br />proceed with preparing a detailed submission, including<br />design and costing, for a specific form of memorial.<br />I congratulate members of the Australian Vietnam Forces<br />National Memorials Committee for the drive and determination<br />to establish a lasting memorial.<br />The allocation of a site in Canberra's main memorial drive<br />should now spur those who have been thinking about making a<br />donation. The memorial will be funded in the main from<br />donations made to the Australian Vietnam Forces National<br />Memorials Committee by the public and by private companies.<br />The Government has already provided financial assistance to<br />support the administration of the project, and will be<br />providing significant further assistance once the design and<br />costing have been finalised.<br />3~ 3 G; p] T) D0' t) S4 a Ai fl bi ft<br />d T)</p>
