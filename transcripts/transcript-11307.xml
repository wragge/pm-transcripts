    <content><![CDATA[<p>On receiving news of the death of King Hussein of Jordan, I have today</p>
<p> sent the following message of condolence to the Prime Minister of</p>
<p> Jordan:</p>
<p>I was deeply saddened to hear of the death of His Majesty King</p>
<p> Hussein after a long and courageous battle with cancer. On behalf</p>
<p> of all Australians, I wish to offer my profound condolences to</p>
<p> the royal family, the government of Jordan and the Jordanian people.</p>
<p>King Hussein's death is a great loss to Jordan, the Middle</p>
<p> East and the world. He brought vision and perseverance to the</p>
<p> pursuit of peace in the Middle East. His role in the region's</p>
<p> efforts to come to terms with its deep problems is truly historic.</p>
<p>He dedicated himself unstintingly. The conclusion of the 1994</p>
<p> peace treaty between Jordan and Israel and the part he played</p>
<p> in achieving the Wye River accord are lasting testament to his</p>
<p> personal abilities and standing.</p>
<p>King Hussein's 47-year reign was marked by the strong and</p>
<p> open relationship he enjoyed with his people. They held a genuine</p>
<p> and profound affection for their King.</p>
<p>He will be deeply mourned by Jordanians and we share in your grief</p>
<p> at his passing.</p>
