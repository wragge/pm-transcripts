    <content><![CDATA[<p>Manuka Oval, Canberra</p>
<p>It's a delight to be here at Manuka Oval. </p>
<p>I had the rare joy of seeing a Bulldogs victory the last time I was here and I says rare, I mean rare joy, and I think that that good run can continue as we go to the next session of play with the Prime Minister's XI.</p>
<p>This is a great special occasion for Canberra and for cricket: the first match played under these magnificent new lights.</p>
<p>And I know that the people of Canberra have waited decades to be able to see day-night cricket, here it is.</p>
<p>The light towers are going to make a transforming difference to complement to the ground and this is a fantastic ground with the scoreboard, caretaker's cottage and the rows of trees, so retaining much of its traditional atmosphere.</p>
<p>It's a tribute to the modern Canberra and the way in which Canberra seeks to preserve the best of its past.</p>
<p>It is also always a good time to be here with our friends from the West Indies here for a game of cricket.</p>
<p>Such a diverse collection of islands, nations and peoples brought together by their shared love of cricket.</p>
<p>And of course it brings us and the West Indies together; cricket force for breaking down barriers between us.</p>
<p>There, and here, cricket is a game for the people.</p>
<p>As the Deputy Prime Minister, Wayne Swan, observed last week, Australians' attitude to cricket is a “democratic code” and I know the West Indies are no different.</p>
<p>Just as fun and just as fiercely contested in the backyard and on the beach as it is in the middle of Kensington Oval or at the MCG  -  we're always enjoying a terrific contest between bat and ball and we are enjoying that today.</p>
<p>For Prime Minister's XI selection is really the heart of this match and like all complicated decisions I take the best possible advice.</p>
<p>So thank you for every one of the selectors who've done such a great job.</p>
<p>The PM's XI has a long and proud history of giving the rising stars of Australian cricket an opportunity to perform against top international competition. </p>
<p>In future years, we might be saying of one of today's team ‘I saw him first at Manuka.'</p>
<p>The crowd has always turned out to support the local champions who play in this game and there's no prouder vice-captain than Brad today and no prouder product of this district.</p>
<p>And this match has a record of honouring great champions like Border, Hayden and Langer.</p>
<p>And I think it's been a thrill for everyone to see Ricky today  -  one of the genuine greats.</p>
<p>Over the years, the match has hosted some amazing performances. I just want to give you an insight into one.</p>
<p>Back in 1955 a dashing young all-rounder by the name of Richie Benaud made a quick-fire 113 here.</p>
<p>Richie's spectacular century delighted the crowd that day as you'd imagine.</p>
<p>But it was also the source of mounting unease for one local businessman, who had pledged to donate to local charities 30 shillings for each six and 10 shillings for each four in the game. </p>
<p>That gentleman ended up 35 pounds out of pocket.</p>
<p>And the story of that match goes on.</p>
<p>On that day, the then-Governor-General Sir William Slim even managed to catch one of Richie's sixes.</p>
<p>I've already advised Major-General Jeffery that if the ball comes in our direction the pressure is on.</p>
<p>We'll see what happens in the next session and if a ball is coming that fast, our way, I'll be getting out of the way.</p>
<p>So thanks to everyone who's made today possible.</p>
<p>There are so many people involved, so many people who've worked so hard to bring this to the people of Canberra; a very big thank you.</p>
<p>It is no exaggeration to say that in Canberra's centenary year this is one of the most exciting weeks in the history of ACT cricket, and I'm sure each of you who has worked hard to achieve it will be very proud of the part you have played.</p>
<p>I hope you have all enjoyed the match so far there's plenty more cricket to come so please enjoy the evening under lights.</p>
<p>Thank you very much.</p>
