<p>My Government has been a strong supporter of Australia's welfare and charity groups.</p>
<p>They have made and continue to make an immeasurable contribution to the well-being of many Australians - particularly the less fortunate in our community. They often catch those falling between the cracks in our society.</p>
<p>Their practical understanding of life's challenges and the adversity confronting some Australians is unrivalled and that is why the Coalition continues to nurture and encourage these vital groups.</p>
<p>We have not only provided substantial financial assistance and tax concessions but the Government has directly involved charities and welfare groups in important social policy programs.  </p>
<p>The successful Family Relationship Centres and the Job Network program are good examples of major programs where the contribution of welfare organisations has helped deliver a better service.</p>
<p>The telephone counselling service Lifeline is also an important element of the Government's commitment to Australians in need.   Lifeline was established in 1963 by the late Reverend Dr Sir Alan Walker after he received a call by a distressed man who three days later took his own life. Soon after Sir Alan launched a crisis line which has expanded into a national service answering more than 500,000 calls a year.  Later today I will announce a new Government commitment to Lifeline Australia, helping the organisation answer more calls than it ever has before. The new funding will also help Lifeline as it starts to explore new ways of providing counselling using the web and text messaging.   I would also like to take this opportunity to encourage the community to continue to support Lifeline. Sometimes we take organisations like Lifeline for granted, but we should never do so.</p>
<p>Like any charity or not-for-profit organisation, they face the continuous challenge of needing financial and volunteer support to sustain their important services. I applaud their work, they have saved countless lives.</p>
