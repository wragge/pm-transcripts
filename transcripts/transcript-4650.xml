-AUSTRAAL<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR PRESS 19 MARCH 1978<br />
PORTLAND NURSING HOME OPENING<br />
I am particularly pleased to be here today to open these further<br />
extensions to the Portland Hospital.<br />
This is a great country hospital which has served this district<br />
for 130 years.<br />
Mr. Maling and his Committee, Mr. Stanway, Matron Farrands, and all<br />
the staff, are to be commended on the very high standard of service<br />
which this hospital provides for the Portland community.<br />
The Commonwealth has been able in the last couple of years to<br />
provide substantial assistance for the up-grading of the hospital's<br />
facilities, and equipment.<br />
First, we were able to finance the complete overhaul of the kitchen<br />
facilities at a cost in excess of half a million dollars.<br />
Now we are contributing over $ 300,000 towards this ne-w 31 bed<br />
accommodation complex for the aged.<br />
It is important for the Portland District that there be high<br />
standard accommodation available within the district to meet the<br />
special needs of old people.<br />
It will be of great comfort to families to have these facilities<br />
available at close hand.<br />
Older people, their families and friends can thereby be re-assured--<br />
and this is as it should be.<br />
Old people needing this type of accommodation can now continue<br />
to live in the same district in which they have resided for most<br />
or all of their lives.<br />
In this way, there is minimum disruption and families retain the<br />
greatest opportunities for mutual support and access to each other.<br />
I am advised that the capital cost of this project is around $ 500,000<br />
and further substantial amounts are -required to equip and furnish<br />
the new wing.<br />
As the Commonwealth's contribution is in the order of $ 318,000, this<br />
has still left a very considerable sum to be raised with this<br />
comimun i t y.<br />
You are all, as a community, to be commended on the significant<br />
contributions and sacrifices which you have made to enable this<br />
project to proceed. </p>
<p>Such a spirit of self-help, Of Community action where people<br />
and groups are not completely dependent on governments for their<br />
needs is wholly admirable.<br />
My Government's social welfare philosophy sets great store on<br />
the role of families and voluntary community groups in caring * for<br />
the sick, the aged and the handicapped.<br />
Without this our social welfare programmes would run the danger of<br />
being just monolithic impersonal arrangements, failing to meet<br />
the real needs of those requiring care and what is more, they would<br />
be very much more expensive.<br />
Health and the cost of health care is a subject very much to the fore<br />
in people's minds at the present time.<br />
Health costs are a matter of deep concern to the Government.<br />
One simple illustration will suffice.<br />
Total health expenditure in 1971/ 72 was $ 2.2 billion. For<br />
1976/ 77 this is estimated to have risen to $ 6.2 billion a<br />
staggering rise in just five years.<br />
We have already managed to stem the rate--of increase but further<br />
action will be required.<br />
A complete review of health costs is currently in progress and<br />
the Government hopes to be able during the course of this year to<br />
announce new initiatives in this area.<br />
The Commonwealth's support for this new accommodation wing will not<br />
stop with the completion of construction.<br />
We will continue to provide financial assistance for the patients<br />
to be accommodated here through the payment of nursing home benefits.<br />
The Nursing H-ome Benefits Scheme was substantially improved<br />
last October.<br />
Many patients and their families were experiencing real h ardship<br />
in meeting the difference between the fees charged and the benefits<br />
which were then paid.<br />
The peace of mind that comes from knowing that at least that bill<br />
is now largely covered must be of enormous comfort to patients.<br />
I comme~ nd everyone concerned in the planning and construction of<br />
this new wing.<br />
This is an event of significance for Portland and I have much<br />
pleasure in declaring the nursing home wing of the Portland and<br />
District Hospital officially open. 00--</p>
