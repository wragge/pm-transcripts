    <content><![CDATA[<p>Congratulations to the Queensland Liberal Party for the terrific results yesterday in the two State by-elections.</p>
<p> Queensland Liberal leader Bob Quinn and the two candidates, Michael Caltabiano in Chatsworth and Terry Rodgers in Redcliffe, deserve full credit.</p>
<p> The outstanding result is a very significant boost to the Liberal Party in Queensland.</p>
<p> It is clear that the by-elections were determined on State issues. The outcome has left Premier Peter Beattie embarrassed after his pathetic attempts to run the Labor campaign against the Australian Government workplace relations reform.</p>
<p> Queensland voters have sent a strong message that State Labor is not delivering for them, particularly in the area of health.</p>
