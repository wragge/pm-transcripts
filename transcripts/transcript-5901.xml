FOR MEDIA THURSDAY SEPTEMBER 2 1982<br />
PRESIDENT REAGAN'S INITIATIVE ON THE MIDDLE EAST<br />
I welcome President Reagan's initiative in calling for a<br />
fresh start to the Middle East peace process, one addressing<br />
the root causes of the conflict between Israel and the Arab<br />
States. The personal commitment of the US President brings<br />
new hope that a comprehensive and lasting solution will be<br />
found to the Arab/ Israeli conflict. I hope that all the<br />
parties directly involved in the conflict will support<br />
Mr Reagan in reaching the compromises necessary to bring peace.<br />
The US initiative is based on the Camp David process and on<br />
Security Council Resolution 242, both of which Australia has<br />
supported from the outset. Like the United States, Australia<br />
remains totally committed to the security of Israel, but we<br />
believe that this security can best be achieved by Israel<br />
reaching agreement with its neighbours.<br />
Like President Reagan, Australia believes that any lasting<br />
solution to the conflict must be a political solution, and<br />
must provide for the legitimate rights and aspirations of the<br />
Palestinian people.<br />
President Reagan's statement has shown that the United States<br />
Government is prepared to address the underlying causes of the<br />
conflict and to use its great influence in the search for a<br />
just and lasting settlement. He has firm Australian support<br />
to that end. </p>
