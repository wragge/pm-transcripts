TRANSCRIPT OF PRESS CONFERENCE AT PARLIAMENT HOUSE 26/ 02/ 86<br />
PM:......... involved now in the Philippines, the corruption that<br />
took place in the elections clearly meant that the will of the<br />
Philippine people had not been given effect to. Now Mrs Aquino<br />
will assume the Presidency and they can get on with the task of<br />
bringing economic development to the people of the Philippines<br />
within the framework of democracy.<br />
JOURNALIST:........ willing to make a visit to the Philippines<br />
now? PM: Yes, I am prepared to now. We haven't made any specific<br />
plans. What we have done immediately is to arrange that Mr<br />
Hayden, who is going off overseas into the region at any rate at<br />
the end of this week, will now include the Philippines in his<br />
program. And the question of my visiting there is something to<br />
work out within the near future. It will be worked out in the<br />
near future. When it will take place I am not sure.<br />
JOURNALIST: What is your view of Mrs Aquino, Prime Minister?<br />
PM: Well obviously I haven't had the opportunity of forming<br />
judgment at first hand meeting with her. But from what one has<br />
seen she is clearly a woman of very considerable courage,<br />
fortitude and determination and she will take with her into the<br />
Presidency now the best wishes, I think, of not only all<br />
Australians but of all men and women of good will around the<br />
world. And for the great work to be done there, she seems to have<br />
all those qualities of determination and application to do it,<br />
Laurie.<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you think she is equipped to handle the problems<br />
of the Filipino economy and the NPA?<br />
PM: Well, there is no reason to assume that she is not. I mean<br />
after all leadership is not simply a question of some sound,<br />
detailed, theoretical knowledge of economics. She will, I am<br />
sure, gather around her people who have the necessary expertise<br />
as she seems to have as a leader, as I say, the determination,<br />
capacity of application which is required to undertake a very<br />
important and difficult task that lies ahead of her.<br />
JOURNALIST: Would Australia be offering any expertise?<br />
AL I VA3Y36 ATAJ M </p>
<p>PM: Well, we have there already within the embassy facility. We<br />
have made it clear that if there is any assistance which they<br />
would seek in addition to what we have been doing now, we would<br />
obviously give very positive consideration to that.<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you think it will be any more than just transfer<br />
of power from one wealthy group to another wealthy group?<br />
PM: Yes, I think it will be more than that because I would<br />
believe that Mrs Aquino will realise that the world is looking<br />
now not for that sort of transfer of power and influence but an<br />
application of the powers of the Presidency and the powers of<br />
administration to advancing the real interests of the mass of the<br />
Philippine people.<br />
JOURNALIST: Is it fair that Mr Marcos should be leaving the<br />
country? Should he stay in the Philippines and be judged by his<br />
people? PM: Well, I think that the events of the last few weeks have<br />
basically been marked by a relative lack of violence which is to<br />
the credit of the Filipinos. I don't think that very much is<br />
served by a detailed going into the events that have led up to<br />
this position. The only thing that I must say that I find galling<br />
and I would think the people of the Philippines would find<br />
particularly galling is the apparent rape of the wealth of the<br />
Philippines by President Marcos. He seems to have salted away<br />
enormous amounts, some put it into billions, others in the<br />
hundreds of millions. I think if some way could be found to<br />
ensure that that property of the people of the Philippines could<br />
be restored, that would obviously be a good thing.<br />
JOURNALIST: Has he salted any away in Australia?<br />
PM: Not that I am aware of.<br />
JOURNALIST: What if he had?<br />
PM: Well, then that would be a question for approach by-the new<br />
administration of the Philippines and for discussion between us.<br />
But that is entirely hypothetical. I have not any knowledge of<br />
any such salting away here, Laurie.<br />
JOURNALIST: Can you understand why President Reagan seems so<br />
happy to be offering Mr Marcos and his family asylum?<br />
PM: I hadn't noticed happiness.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, do you think that the Americans<br />
could have acted a little sooner given that they had knowledge of<br />
PM: Well, I guess that the United States administration wanted<br />
to be quite sure that the processes were going to work out there<br />
in a way which did reflect the will of the people there. And they<br />
did not want or wish to be too precipitated in their<br />
intervention. I would say that it-is very hard to be critical of<br />
the way in which the United States has played their hand in the </p>
<p>ZO~<br />
events of the last few weeks. Imean I must say that i,<br />
outside observation of what's happened, the Soviet Union who<br />
seems to be the defender President Marcos has been accusing the<br />
United States of being too forthcoming in its intervention and<br />
support of Mrs Aquino. That is a very interesting state of<br />
affairs. ENDS e-<br />
