TO: THE RT. HONBLE. J. M. FRASER, CH, MiP, PRIME MINISTER OF<br />
THE COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA DEPT. OF THE PRIME MINISTER AND<br />
. CABINET, CANBERRA.<br />
MY DEAR PRIME MI N ISTE
I HAVE SEEN MEDIA REPORTS THAT A VISIT BY THE USS<br />
GOLOSBOROUGH IS PLANNED FOR MELBOURNE IN THE NEAR FUTURE.<br />
I HAVE ALSO SEEN REPORTS IN WHI2_ H YOU ARE REPORTED TO HAVE<br />
SAID THAT THE VISIT OF SUCH VEs-SSELS IS iiOT THE CONCERN OF STATE<br />
GOVERNMENTS. THE VICTORIAN GOVERNMENT IS CONCERNED TO PROTECT<br />
VICTORIANS FROM THE DANGERS OF NUCLEAR CONTAMINATION AND IN<br />
THAT CONTEXT VISITS BY NUCLEAR-' P 4E RE D OR NUCLEAR-ARMED WARSHIPS<br />
TO VICTORIA FROM ANY COUNTRY ARE NOT WELCOME. IF IT IS TO BE<br />
YOUR POSITION THAT YOU WILL NOT SEEK TO EN2UIRE IF ANY VESSEL<br />
MIGHT CARRY NUCLEAR WEAPONS AND THERE IS ANY DEGREE OF PROBABILITY<br />
THAT IT WOULD, IT SHOULD BE NECESSARY TO ASSUME THAT IT<br />
WOULD CARRY NUCLEAR WEAPONS.<br />
THE VICTORIAN GOVERNMENT RECOGNISES HOWEVER, THAT THE<br />
COMMONWEALTH HAS ULTIMATE AUTHORITY IN THESE MATTERS AND SO<br />
WOULD NOT PREVENT SUCH VI SITS. SHOULD THE COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT<br />
AGREE TO A REQUEST FROM A FOREIGN POWER FOR A VISIT IN THIS CATEGORY,<br />
THE COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT MUST ASSUME FULL<br />
RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE SAFETY, ENVIRONMENTAL AND FINANCIAL<br />
ASPECTS OF SUCH VISITS.<br />
I WOULD APPRl* ECIATE DETAILS OF ANY VISITS BY WARSHIPS<br />
k4ICH HAVE BEEN PLANNED As I SELIEVE VICTORIANS ARE ENIITLED<br />
TO BE FULLY INFORMED OF THE DETAILS OF THESE VISITS AND THE<br />
ARRANGEMENTS THE COMMONWEALTH WILL MAKE TO ENSURE THE SAFETY OF<br />
ALL VICTORIANS.<br />
JOHN CAIN,<br />
PREMIER OF VICTORIA </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER CANBERRA<br />
1 4 JUL982<br />
Dear Mr Cain,<br />
In your teleprinter message of 12 July 1982, you state<br />
that " vis-ts by nuclear-powered or nuclear-armed<br />
warships from any country are not welcome". I can<br />
only express surprise that you continue to pursue such<br />
a policy _ in the face of the decisions taken at the ALP<br />
General Conference only last week and in the face of<br />
your recognition of the Commonwealth's Constitutional<br />
position. Your message contains several misconceptions which I<br />
should rectify.<br />
First, the USS Goldsborough is an Adams class destroyer,<br />
very similar to HMA ships Brisbane, Hobart and Perth.<br />
It is conventionally powered, not nuclear powered.<br />
Second, you characterise the Commonwealth Government's<br />
position as one of not seeking to enquire if any<br />
vessel might carry nuclear weapons. That is not so.<br />
The Commonwealth Government's position is that it<br />
endorses the policy of our allies of neither confirming<br />
nor denying the carriage of nuclear weapons. As I<br />
pointed out in my message of 3 June 1982, to identify<br />
which warships might carry nuclear weapons would have<br />
implications not only for the security of our allies'<br />
forces but also for the effectiveness of deterrence.<br />
Consequently, as I pointed out in my message of<br />
4 June 1982, one cannot assume that warships of our<br />
nuclear weapon state allies are not nuclear armed.<br />
Third, your reference to the dangers of " nuclear<br />
contamination" implies that Victorians are being exposed<br />
to unacceptable risks. That is not so. The risk of<br />
a reactor incident in nuclear powered warships is very<br />
remote. The risk of a nuclear weapon malfunction is<br />
even more remote. The smallness of these risks<br />
notwithstanding, appropriate precautions are always taken.<br />
2/ </p>
<p>Fourth, I do not understand your reference to the<br />
" financial. aspects" of visits by allies' warships.<br />
The major costs associated with such visits are met<br />
by the government of the nation whose warship makes<br />
the visit. The financial benefits to the State<br />
deriving from port visits far exceed such incidental<br />
costs as the State may incur.<br />
You also requested details of planned visits by<br />
warships. Apart from the visit of USS Goldsborough<br />
on 5-9 August the Australian Government is pnaware<br />
of any other visits at present. Your Government<br />
will be advised of future visits through normal<br />
channels. I assume that arrangements for the USS<br />
Goldsborough, and any other vessels in the future,<br />
will accord with those that have normally been made<br />
for Allied warships visiting the Port of Melbourne.<br />
Yours sincerely,<br />
( Malcolm Fraser)<br />
The Hon. J. Cain, M. Ib. A.,<br />
Premier oE Victoria,<br />
MELBOURNE Vic 3000 </p>
