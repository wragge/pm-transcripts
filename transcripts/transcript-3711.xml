PRIME MINISTER'S SPEECH AT THE OPENING OF CURTIN HOUSE,<br />
PERTH APRIL, 1975<br />
Mr. dhairman, Mr. and Mrs. McLeod, Mr. and Mrs. John Curtin,<br />
Jnr., Sir Paul and Lady Hasluck, Mr. and Mrs. John Tonkin,<br />
Ladies and Gentlemen<br />
A year ago on the eve of the campaign for the 1974 Federal<br />
elections, I laid the foundation stone for John Curtin House<br />
in Canberra. That building, now nearing completion, will be<br />
the national headquarters of the Australian Labor Party.<br />
Today, 2,000 miles across the continent, I have the privilege<br />
of officially opening Curtin House as the headquarters of<br />
the Western Australian branch of the Australian Labor Party.<br />
So, in the national capital, where John Curtin lived and<br />
worked as the Party's Leader and Australia's Prime Minister,<br />
in the city where he died truly on active service and in<br />
this western capital, near his home, his family's home,<br />
his chosen resting place, in these two capitals, the Australian<br />
Labor Party associates his name and memory with its continuing<br />
and livin g work. By so doing, we do not so much honour an<br />
imperishable name which requires no memorial in stone, but<br />
rather dignify ourselves and our Party by being able to<br />
associate our work with that name. He would have been<br />
delighted to think that the work which will go on in this<br />
building, in this site, should be associated with his name.<br />
We are all sorry that Mrs. Elsie Curtin can' t be here. I'm<br />
sure we are all thinking of her because on Tuesday, it will<br />
be her 58th wedding anniversary. I know, because it will be<br />
my 33rd wedding anniversary on. Tuesday. A few years ago,<br />
Mrs. Curtin wrote to Margaret and me and pointed out that<br />
our wedding took place on their 25th anniversary.<br />
The name of these two headquarters in Canberra, in Perth,<br />
symbolises John Curtin's commanding place in the history<br />
of our Party and expresses our recognition of that place.<br />
But in proclaiming him as our chief of men, we also acknowledge<br />
a higher claim for while being our. Leader, he was the Leader<br />
of the Nation. The circumstances of the time, his position<br />
as Prime Minister of a Nation at war and his. own qualities,<br />
made him pre-eminently the authentic leader of the Nation. </p>
<p>Yet for John Curtin there was no contradiction in his<br />
* role as Party Leader and as the Nation's Leader, nor is<br />
there any contradiction in the honour which we as Party<br />
members pay him as our Party Leader and the honour which<br />
we ds Australians pay him, as our Nation's Leader. Indeed,<br />
in John Curtin's case, his service to the Party was a crucial<br />
and decisive part of his service to the Nation. The intimate<br />
relationship between the two roles has been finely perceived<br />
and is finely expressed by Sir Paul Hasluck who, with his<br />
wife, honours us with their presence today.<br />
On the 25th anniversary of the Pacific victory, which John<br />
Curtin did not live to see, nearly five years ago, Sir Paul<br />
unveiled a memorial at the civic centre, Cottesloe. He<br />
spoke not only as Australia's Governor-General at that time,<br />
but as a frieno, a fellow journalist and a public servant<br />
under John Curtin.<br />
Let me repeat here at the opening of Curtin House in Perth,<br />
what I quoted at the laying of the foundation stone a year<br />
ago in Canberra at John Curtin House. Sir Paul said this on<br />
that occasion at Cottesloe nearly five years ago:<br />
" In 1935 he was elected to the Leadership of the<br />
Parliamentary Labor Party. This decision of Caucus<br />
was one fateful both . for the Party and for the<br />
Nation. When Curtin became Leader, the Party was<br />
dis-united and divided. He lifted it away from.<br />
its divisions and its failures and helped it to<br />
re-discover some central purpose, even if he<br />
couldn't at once remove all of the more deepseated<br />
differences. In doing so, he made the<br />
Labor Party fit to govern and gave the Nation<br />
the alternative Government which under our<br />
democratic usage, was required once the formation<br />
of a war time National Government was found to<br />
be politically impossible. If he had not succeeded<br />
so well in the years between 1935 and 1940, there<br />
would not have been a viable alternative Government<br />
at the critical point in 1941 when one had to be<br />
found.-As Leader of the alternative Government,<br />
he found himself Prime Minister, largely as the<br />
result of the sound, useful work he had done as<br />
a Party Leader in restoring the health of his<br />
own Party. He accepted office as the destiny<br />
of the Party." </p>
<p>3.<br />
This generous tribute is all the more valuable coming as<br />
it does from one who could speak, not only as a public<br />
servant, an historian, a statesman, but as one throughout<br />
his own long and distinguished political career was a good<br />
Party man, an honourable partisan. Both his tribute to<br />
John Curtin and his own career illustrated one of the great<br />
truths of our democratic system. The strength of the system<br />
depends upon the strength of the two great opposing Parties.<br />
In our parliamentary democracy, partisanship, honourable<br />
partisanship, is not seldom the highest patriotism. Democracy<br />
in Britain and Australia faced the supreme physical test for<br />
survival in the war during which John Curtin was our Leader.<br />
In our own time, when democracy everywhere faces tests and<br />
challenges of a very different kind, it's strength and survival,<br />
rests, I believe, on the strength of the two Party system.<br />
John Curtin not only re-built a broken Party, he not only<br />
restored the Party's confidence in itself, he restored its<br />
confidence in the idea of leadership. He gave it confidence<br />
to lead the Nation by giving it confidence in him as its<br />
Leader. This was the essence of his contribution to the<br />
future of the. Australian Labor Party.<br />
For a generation and more after the great catastrophe of the<br />
First World War, the Australian Labor Party lost faith in the<br />
very concept of leadership. John Curtin restored it. Not, of<br />
course, in any sense of an imposed dictatorship, or unchallenged,<br />
unquestioning authority, but in the sense that the leadership<br />
must provide coherence and cohesion to the Party and its<br />
programme. Curtin's success in re-establishing that trust<br />
as Leader, has left the Party as a whole, in his debt and<br />
equally has left all his successors in his deep debt.<br />
I am proud to acknowledge my own debt to him as his successor,<br />
as Leader of the Australian Labor Party, as his successor as<br />
Prime Minister of Australia.<br />
Ladies and Gentlemen, with John Tonkin, I now unveil the plaque<br />
to commemorate the official opening of Curtin House, the<br />
headquarters of the Western Australian branch of the Australian<br />
Labor Party. </p>
