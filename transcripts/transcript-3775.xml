PRIME MINISTER'S PRESS CONFERENCE<br />
CANBERRA, 10 JUNE, 1975<br />
Mr. Whitlan: Ladies and gentlemen, when I announced the<br />
ministerial changes last Thursday night, I didn't include details<br />
of the Ministers assisting. As you will notice, there are now<br />
several departments which have been given additional responsibilities,<br />
so there is a need to have additional Assistant Ministers.<br />
Senator Bishop, the Postmaster-General, will also be Minister<br />
assisting the Minister for Defence. You remember that he did<br />
act as Assistant Minister earlier, before Mr. Morrison became<br />
Assistant Minister.<br />
Senator James McClelland, the Minister for Labor and Immigration,<br />
will also be the Minister assisting me in-matters relating to the<br />
Public Service.<br />
Mr. Morrison, the Minister for Defence, will also be Minister<br />
assisting the Minister for Foreign Affairs in matters relating<br />
to the islands of the Pacific.<br />
Mr. Stewart, the Minister for Tourism and Recreation, who has<br />
been Minister assisting the Treasurer, will now also be Minister<br />
assisting the Minister for Social Security and Minister for<br />
Repatriation and Compensation.<br />
Mr. Riordan, the Minister for Housing and Construction, will<br />
also be Minister assisting the Minister for Urban and Regional<br />
Development. The Government has decided to establish a National College of<br />
Navigation and Communication to provide education and training<br />
for officers in the Australian maritime industry and to site it<br />
at Launceston. The decision results from the report on ' Training<br />
Requirements for Sea-going Personnel' by Mr. Malcolm Summers, who<br />
is the Royal Commissioner inquiring into various acqDects of the<br />
maritime industry. His report was tabled on the 11 JulY last,<br />
and has since betn discussed with all the States.<br />
Launceston was chosen because the College needs to have practical<br />
training fadilities at a seamanship centre, including a jetty,<br />
boat repair sheds, boats, liferafts and periodic access to a<br />
small training ship. It needs to be situated close to sheltered<br />
water with good access to the sea. </p>
<p>Those were the requirements set out by the Royal Commissioner,<br />
Mr. Summers, and Launceston has all these requirements and<br />
its proximity to Bass Strait is a decisive consideration.<br />
As you know, the RAAF has always centred its navigation training<br />
in Bass Strait.<br />
The! Government accepts the recommendation of the Royal<br />
Commissioner, that the College should be based on a requirement<br />
of 300 student places, with provision for future growth. The<br />
Government accepts the recommendations of the Commissioner that<br />
the College should be situated close to a tertiary institution<br />
which may need to be developed further than the existing advanced<br />
education facilities in Launceston. Library, hall of residence<br />
and some other facilities could, by arrangement with the Tasmanian<br />
Government, be available for joint use with Tasmanian tertiary<br />
students.<br />
The Committee which has been investigating post secondary education<br />
in Northern Tasmania will be asked to recommend the manner of<br />
this association between the National College of Navigation and<br />
Communication and the new tertiary educational facilities which<br />
are being developed in Launceston.<br />
The College will educate deck officers, engineer officers, radio<br />
officers and it will provide for higher studies including nautical<br />
science degree qualifications for which at present Australian<br />
seafarers are forced to go overseas.<br />
The College will be comprehensive, with predominantly tertiary<br />
level studies with associated courses at a level appropriate for<br />
seamen and fishermen and including practical training in safety,<br />
fire fighting and life saving.<br />
Prime Minister: Are there any questions?<br />
Question: How do you equate your Brisbane statement that<br />
ordinary people are more prosperous than they've ever been with<br />
tLhe highest unemployment since the depression and the present<br />
high inflation rate? What immediate steps do you expect the new<br />
Treasurer to take to rectify this anomaly?<br />
Mr. Whitlam: The steps which have been made to alleviate<br />
unemployment are well-known to you all and they are working.<br />
The fact is, as I stated in my weekly broadcast in Queensland<br />
on Sunday, the standard of living for most people has certainly<br />
risen. That is the average income, taking into account taxation,<br />
is higher than it was in real terms, and in many cases, such as<br />
those who are on pensions, it is conspicuously higher. I think </p>
<p>3.<br />
to give one instance there, the cost of living in our two and<br />
a half years, has risen by about 36%. The age pension for single<br />
paensioners has risen by 80%, for pensioner couples by 74% and<br />
one can go through all those fields where incomes depend on<br />
payments by the Australian Government to demonstrate that in<br />
ever-y case the incomes, in real terms, are conspicuously higher<br />
than they were when we camne into office two and a half years ago.<br />
As regards incomes fixed in the general sphere by Arbitration<br />
proceedings and so on, after taxation incomes are worth more<br />
than they were when we camne in, significantly more.<br />
Question: When do you expect to have the report of the<br />
inquiry into the allegations by Dr. Cairns?<br />
Mr. Whitlam: I wrote on Friday afternoon to Dr. Cairns, to<br />
Mr. Hayden, since some of Dr. Cairns' former office staff may<br />
now be in Mr. Hayden's off ice, and to Sir Frederick Wheeler, the<br />
Secretary of the Treasury, Mr. Harders the Secretary of the<br />
Attorney-General's Department and Mr. Menadue the Secretary of<br />
my own Department in these terms:<br />
" rYou will be aware of the statement made in the House of<br />
Representatives yesterday by Dr. Cairns concerning the<br />
handling of papers in his office in the Treasury and in<br />
the Attorney-General's Department dealing with loan raisings.<br />
Naturally I take a serious view of what Dr. Cairns has said<br />
and I, therefore, require from you a full report insofar as<br />
your Department is concerned, including signed statements<br />
from any individual members of the staff who have dealt with<br />
this matter in any material way. The report and accompanying<br />
statements should be produced to me early next week."<br />
Those letters were delivered to Sir Frederick Wheeler and<br />
Mr. Menadue at 4.30 on Friday afternoon and delivered, I believe,<br />
to the others at the same time, within a few minutes thereafter.<br />
I've had no written statements or reports yet. If there is any<br />
disparity in the statement, any discrepancies in the reports,<br />
the statements I receive, then I will have an inquiry of a quasi<br />
judicial nature instituted.<br />
Question: Last week at his press conference, Dr. Cairns<br />
said that he was removed as Treasurer because, in your view,<br />
he had acted unwisely in his dealings with Mr. George Harris.<br />
Was that the only reason he was removed?<br />
Mr. rdhitlam: The sole reason.<br />
Question: Would you say what prompted you to remove<br />
Mr. Cayiewrn. as Minister for Labor and Immigration? </p>
<p>Mr. Whitlam: The general changes were due to my belief of<br />
where men can best serve; which Ministers can best discharge<br />
perticular portfolios at the present time or from now on.<br />
Question: Can you tell us then what special qualifications<br />
Mr. Cameron has as minister for Science?<br />
Mr. Whitlam: The Department is Minister for Science and<br />
Consumer Affairs. The Department was changed last Friday to<br />
emphasise that consumer affairs are primarily in that Department.<br />
Mr. Cameron's qualities to investigate and pursue issues are well<br />
known to you and such qualities are conspicuously suitable for<br />
consumer affairs.<br />
Question: If the sole reason for Dr. Cairns~ dismissal<br />
as Treasurer was the question of the letters on overseas loan<br />
raising and since you have already asked for an inquiry to be<br />
instituted, would it not have been fairer to wait for the result<br />
of the inquiry before dismissing Dr. Cairns?<br />
Mr. Whitlam: I believe not. Dr. Cairns doesn't dispute, he<br />
never did disputeothe letters which he had given Mr. George Harris<br />
as he has already reported to the Parliament. I believe that it<br />
was unwise for him to give such letters. There's no dispute<br />
concerning the passage of letters between Dr. Cairns and Mr. Harris.<br />
There is the question of how the letters came to be transmitted<br />
by Treasury officials to the Attorney-General's Department. It<br />
is obviously a matter of interest that the Head of a Department,<br />
the Departmental Head, should seek a legal opinion about his<br />
Minister without telling the Minister, without telling the Prime<br />
Minister. Quest ion: Your judgement there, is that based on the<br />
original letters or on the version that you received via the<br />
Attorney-General' s Department?<br />
Mr. Whitlam: I didn't receive a version directly from the<br />
Attorney-General's Department. I received the Attorney-General's<br />
Department's opinion from the Secretary of the Treasury.<br />
Question: What is the distinction between the loan<br />
raisings of Mr. Connor and Dr. Cairns? Did Mr. Connor provide<br />
full details of all his intermediaries to Cabinet and why is it<br />
that he has escaped scot-free in this matter?<br />
Mr. Whitlam: it's well-known that the transaction iLn which<br />
Mr. Connor had authority, was known and discussed by all relevant<br />
Departmnts; his own Department, Treasury, Attorney-General's<br />
Department and myself. </p>
<p>Question: Why did you decide to incorporate the Social<br />
Welfare Commission into the Department of Social Security?<br />
Mr. Whitlam: What I've done is given the same man,<br />
Senator Wheeldon, both portfolios. The Departments are separate,<br />
but one Minister holds both of them. There has been concern<br />
about the proliferation or duplication of the delivery of<br />
welfare services. Senator Wheeldon, the Minister for both<br />
Social Security and Repatriation and Compensation, has shown<br />
his outstanding effectiveness as Minister for Repatriation and<br />
Compensation and I thought he would be an ideal man to see that<br />
research and policy and equipment, new computers and that sort<br />
of thing, were all properly coordinated between these two<br />
principal welfare departments.<br />
Question: The question I think was about the Social<br />
Welfare Commission which has been abolished or is to be abolished.<br />
Mr. Whitlam: Yes. Legislation will be introduced to abolish<br />
the Social Welfare Commission. I announced that last Thursday<br />
night, about 10 o'clock last Thursday night. I did state then,<br />
that the Social Welfare Commission would now become a bureau<br />
within the Department of Social Security. It may become a bureau<br />
within the Department of Repatriation and Compensation. As you<br />
know, the National Advisory Council for the Handicapped, under<br />
Mr. Justice Meares, will be responsible to the Minister for<br />
Repatriation and Compensation and it may be that the Social<br />
Welfare Commission will become a bureau in that Department. But<br />
in all events in either case, it will be under the same Minister,<br />
Senator John Wheeldon.<br />
Question: Why have you decided to make the Social Welfare<br />
Commission a bureau, to take away its former status?<br />
Mr. Whitlam: So that the policy functions which it has been<br />
discharging, will, in fact, be fed in directly to the Department<br />
most concerned.<br />
Question: * Are you satisfied that no legal agency existed<br />
between Dr. Cairns and Mr. Harris on the basis of his letters?<br />
If so, can you tell us why you think his action was unwise<br />
Was it because he failed to consult properly?<br />
Mr. Whitlam.: I don't believe it was a responsible thing<br />
for a Treasurer to give that sort of letter. I'm not going to<br />
give a legal opinion on it. You have a legal opinion from the<br />
Secretary of the Attorney-General's Department. </p>
<p>Question: Have you had a legal opinion on the letter<br />
Mr. Connor gave to Mr. Khemlani. How does it differ from the<br />
letter Dr. Cairns gave to Mr. Harris? And why is Dr. Cairns'<br />
action less responsible than that of Mr. Connor?<br />
Mr. Whitlam: I've already stated that what Mr. Connor did<br />
was in consultation with the Departments I've named. There<br />
have been many statements by the Opposition and by the media<br />
in recent weeks regarding the borrowing overseas of petrodollars.<br />
I want it clearly understood that the Government has not negotiated<br />
any such borrowing. I want it clearly understood that no-one<br />
has authority to make any such borrowing on the Government's<br />
behalf. In answer to a question in the House of Representatives<br />
on the 21st May, I informed the House that the authority given<br />
to the Minister for Minerals and Energy in connection with a<br />
proposed $ 2 billion loan, had been revoked. The authority has<br />
not been renewed. The week before last, I became aware that the<br />
former Treasurer had given certain letters relating to the possible<br />
borrowing of Itnies overseas. This was done without my knowledge<br />
and without consultation with the Minister's Department. Henceforth,<br />
no person has authority to do anything in relation to borrowings<br />
by the Australian Government unless it is done with Mr. Hayden's<br />
authority. That includes the AIDC which, as you know, has statutory<br />
authority to borrow overseas. It is, ministerially, the responsibility<br />
of Senator James McClelland.<br />
Question What other intermediaries did Mr. Connor use<br />
besides Mr. Khemlani if any, and why is there this reluctance<br />
to make Mr. Connor's letters public?.<br />
Mr. Whitlam: Mr. Khemlani was not an intermediary. Mr. Connor<br />
had authority under the Executive Council minute, to borrow as<br />
Minister for Minerals and Energy . That authority has been revoked.<br />
Question: Dr. Cairns said he had authority under ExCo.<br />
as well.<br />
Mr. Whitlam: I don't believe he did say that.<br />
Question: If you believe that Dr. Cairns<br />
Mr. Whitlam: You're referring to the Saudi Arabian Monetary<br />
Authority and AIDC. Well those are authorities given to the<br />
Treasurer under Executive Council minute.<br />
Question: If you believe that Dr. Cairns has acted<br />
unwisely, what do . you feel about the role played by Sir Frederick<br />
Wheeler in not telling anybody that he'd sought this legal advice? </p>
<p>24r. Whitlam: I've already made the only commeat I'm going<br />
to make on that subject at this stage.<br />
Question: Would you agree that a Permanent Head's first<br />
obligation is loyalty to his Minister?<br />
Mr. Whitlam: There are several duties which a Permanent Head<br />
has, several duties. I believe that if there is a difference of<br />
opinion between a Permanent Head and his Minister, then the<br />
Permanent Head, according to custom, according to precedent,<br />
according to right practice in my view, should bring the matter<br />
to the attention of the Prime Minister.<br />
Question: Can you explain why the Federal Government has<br />
brought the North West Shelf Gas project to a standstill for<br />
more than twelve months?<br />
Mr. Whitlam: Because the States have challenged the Federal<br />
legislation in the High Court. I say the Federal Government's<br />
legislation. The legislation which is being challenged by<br />
Western Australia and by all States in the High Court, certainly<br />
was introduced by my Government and it was passed by Parliament<br />
under my Government. But it is the same legislation as was<br />
introduced in April, 1970, under the Gorton Government, in the<br />
name of Mr. McMahon, who was then Foreign Minister.<br />
Question: The company just want details of the optake of<br />
gas, the price and when it will be available so they could continue<br />
to plan even while this<br />
Mr. Whitlam: You can put their case if you wish. You can<br />
be their advocate. I'm not going to be an advocate. What I<br />
want to do is to assert the Australian Government's responsibility<br />
in this matter. When I was in Opposition, I made it quite plain<br />
that the opposition would support the Gorton Government's legislation.<br />
When Mr. McMahon became Prime Minister, I still made it plain that<br />
we would support that legislation. It was still on the noticepaper<br />
throughout the . term of office of the McMahon Government.. After<br />
Mr. McMahon became Prime Minister, it was on the noticepaper,<br />
under him, in the name of his Foreign Minister, Mr. Bowen. When<br />
we came in, we brought the legislation in.. At last, on the second<br />
attempt, we secured its passage. Now we've done all we can. We<br />
did so in Opposition, when it was introduced in April, 1970. We<br />
at last got it through in our first Parliament. We've done all<br />
we can. I sympathise with the position of the company for<br />
which you are speaking. The fact is, however, that the Australian<br />
Government has done all it can. It introduced the law, it is<br />
justifying the law before the High Court which has reserved its<br />
decision. </p>
<p>Question: Have you asked Mr. Connor if he has sent<br />
any further letters to other people involving overseas borrowings?<br />
Mr. Whitlan: Yes.<br />
Question: Has he sent any?<br />
Mr. Whitlai: No.<br />
Question: The letter to Mr.-Khemlani is the only one<br />
is it?<br />
Mr. Whitlam: There is no letter. There was a cable, there<br />
have been cables. There have been no communications to anybody<br />
else. As I mentioned, the whole of that transaction is ended.<br />
I thought I'd made that plain.<br />
Question: Next week the annual meeting of the Premiers<br />
is being held in Canberra. I understand that officers, federally<br />
and state, have been having discussions. Is there any sign of<br />
a better accord being reached or are we to expect the usual<br />
wrangle at the end of next week? And do you propose that the<br />
new formula which is to be worked out should run for the usual<br />
five years which has been the practice, or for a lesser period?<br />
Mr. Whitlam: There have been discussions between me and<br />
my colleagues and by us with our officials on this matter for<br />
some weeks past. The Premiers sent us proposals on the<br />
of last month. I received a telephone call from Mr. Lewis on<br />
their behalf last week and I told him what our program was.<br />
The principal Ministers concerned discussed this yesterday. I<br />
am sending a cable to Mr. Lewis and maybe the other Premiers too<br />
today. our officials are meeting theirs on Thursday. The<br />
Cabinet will be discussing the whole matter on Monday, and I<br />
expect then to give a fuller reply to the Premiers on Tuesday.<br />
We meet on Thursday and maybe Friday of next week. You'll see<br />
from this timetable that there has been much more preliminary<br />
discussion than there has been before previous Premier's Conferences.<br />
on previous occasions, the Premiers had not made their officials<br />
available and had not themselves forwarded any commuunications<br />
to the Federal Government, certainly not to the extent that has<br />
happened on thi-s occasion. on previous occasions, the Federal<br />
response was made on the day of the meeting itself. As you see,<br />
there will be a preliminary response by me today. It will be<br />
pursued by officials on Thursday and there will be a definitive<br />
response next Tuesday. This means that the Premiers will be able<br />
to confer further on Tuesday or Wednesday and on Thursday there<br />
will still be some matters, I expect, for us to discuss directly. </p>
<p>9.<br />
Question: Have you asked Sir Frederick Wheeler to take<br />
the governorship of the Reserve Bank when it becomes vacant, Sir?<br />
Mr. Whitlan: We made an offer a couple of months ago.<br />
Question: Beyond paying his fare, will your Government<br />
give Mr. Phillip Lynch any assistance in his offshore operations<br />
overseas? Mr. Whitlam: He's going into the sleuthing business over<br />
there apparently. Well I frankly haven't considered this matter<br />
and it hasn't been put to me up till now, so therefore I haven't<br />
given very much consideration to it. As I think I made pretty<br />
plain on ' Monday Conference' last week, Mr. Lynch may get some<br />
scraps of informat~ ion. They are either misleading to him or<br />
he has embroidered them in a misleading fashion. The only things<br />
that Mr. Lynch has ever said precisely on this matter, have been<br />
quite wrong.<br />
Question: the offer? Did<br />
Reserve Bank?<br />
Mr. Whitlam:<br />
Question: Mr. Whitlam:<br />
Question: Mr. Whitlam: What was Sir Frederick Wheeler's reaction to<br />
he accept the offer of the governorship of the<br />
Not at that time.<br />
Has he accepted it since?<br />
It's only been made once.<br />
Do you plan to offer it again?<br />
I've got no answer for that.<br />
Question: As the Government claims a strong record on<br />
civil liberties questions, have you got any comment to make on<br />
the Opposition's. endorsement of a march in Melbourne recently,<br />
in which the leader of that march said that she'd be naming the<br />
private political beliefs of members of the Victorian Education<br />
Department? Mr. Whitlam: I hadn't heard of this. I read your paper<br />
quite closely, Mr. Clark, and I didn't see it, but I haven't<br />
seen it elsewhere. I'm not aware of the matter at all. Igm<br />
not sure whether-this is a breach of civil liberties. I don't<br />
suppose that there should be any particular mystery as to what<br />
people's beliefs are if they're in a position where those beliefs<br />
might be relevant. I think it's sufficient to say that if they </p>
<p>II are relevant then a person is entitled to hold them but it's<br />
nothing unreasonable in them being disclosed. There's nothing<br />
particularly mysterious about this. Some people in the media<br />
have even had the gall to ask me what my beliefs were on certain<br />
matters. I don't let the Australian media get away with such<br />
an impertinence but I must confess I yielded once or twice to<br />
a couple of B. B. C. people. </p>
