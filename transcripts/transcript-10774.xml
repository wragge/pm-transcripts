<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, tax reform. The Treasurer today says business tax reform</p>
<p>   will not be immediate in your package, it will be rolling reform</p>
<p>   instead. Why?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER: </p>
<p>Well, there is a case for more fully involving the business community</p>
<p>   in a consultative process leading to business tax reform and the</p>
<p>   Treasurer's said that that is an for handling that issue. I</p>
<p>   know that there are a lot of people in the business community who</p>
<p>   are in favour of that approach because they want to be more directly</p>
<p>   and more openly involved in a process of discussion with the Government.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>But that must delay reform, tax reform to business.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER: </p>
<p>Well, nobody is saying that there'll be no changes that involve</p>
<p>   the business area. What the Treasurer is drawing attention to is</p>
<p>   the possibility that we will do it in a staged approach.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>How would that staging work?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER: </p>
<p>How it would work is involving the business community in an open</p>
<p>   process of consultation according to some stated goals of change</p>
<p>   and reform. I think you should wait, once again, until the entire</p>
<p>   package comes out to see the framework of what we might have in</p>
<p>   mind.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Yes I can understand that we need to wait but I guess the broad</p>
<p>   picture is now painted by the Treasurer in the Financial Review</p>
<p>   today that there will be personal tax cuts and a GST but not business</p>
<p>   tax reform. Now surely that's one of the main points in doing</p>
<p>   it is to stimulate business through business tax reform.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER: </p>
<p>What will be involved is a framework for business tax reform which</p>
<p>   will involve a consultative process and it will be necessary for</p>
<p>   the detail of that to be announced for people to get an idea of</p>
<p>   how it's going to be handled.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>And when will the consultation go on, through the next period of</p>
<p>   Government?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER: </p>
<p>Well, obviously it would go on with the business community from</p>
<p>   the time the reform package has been announced.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>But would you go to the next election with a business reform package</p>
<p>   or just reform package for personal tax?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER: </p>
<p>We will go to the next election with a framework for reform covering</p>
<p>   a whole area.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Would that be introduced in the next session of Parliament?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER: </p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>For business?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER: </p>
<p>Well, the aim would be to get the whole lot introduced during the</p>
<p>   next session of Parliament. Yes, that would be the goal, yes.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Well what's the Treasurer talking about? Is he going to put</p>
<p>   personal tax first and then do business?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER: </p>
<p>I think the Treasurer is recognising that there is a desire on</p>
<p>   the part of the business community to talk and consult about the</p>
<p>   detail of some of this reform.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>But there is also a desire for tax reform as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>   Did they say...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER: </p>
<p>Yes, I understand that. Well let the people make a judgement when</p>
<p>   the programme comes out will you.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>When will that be?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER: </p>
<p>Quite soon.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Has it been delayed because of what's been happening around</p>
<p>   Wik?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER: </p>
<p>No, not necessarily. We are still very well advanced. I am not</p>
<p>   going to get tied down with time. I mean this isn't the place</p>
<p>   nor time to sort of talking about precise times. It will be ready</p>
<p>   soon and it will be released when it has been completed and it's</p>
<p>   gone through the Party consultation process. But it hasn't</p>
<p>   been unduly delayed by other events.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Okay, fair enough. I would suggest though that the business community,</p>
<p>   certainly in this State, is waiting with some anxiousness for business</p>
<p>   tax reform and that delaying it could be seen as negative.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER: </p>
<p>Well just wait and see what's in it will you, okay?</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>In other areas, but still related to tax, would you agree that</p>
<p>   there is a bit of nervousness around the country at the moment.</p>
<p>   There are doubts about how deep the Japanese problems are going</p>
<p>   to be. The National Bank Consumer Survey shows confidence is down,</p>
<p>   sales figures are bad. Are people a bit nervous about the state</p>
<p>   of the world?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER: </p>
<p>Oh people are definitely being affected by what's occurring</p>
<p>   in Asia.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Given the nervousness and the uncertainty, is this the time to</p>
<p>   add to that by introducing a GST?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER: </p>
<p>Well Neil, if anybody blinks on tax reform now, if this Government</p>
<p>   blinks on tax reform now, it's gone for a decade. </p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>True.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER: </p>
<p>Well that's the answer to your question because if people</p>
<p>   blink now, and we are not going to blink, but if we were to, what</p>
<p>   you would really be saying is that tax reform is too hard for Australia.</p>
<p>   Now this idea of reforming a tax system has been around for years,</p>
<p>   there's always a reason why now might not quite be the right</p>
<p>   time isn't there? And if we walk away from it now it's</p>
<p>   dead for the next decade and there'll be a whole new generation</p>
<p>   of people federally who will have to deal with the problem because</p>
<p>   if it is scuttled now it won't come back again in the active</p>
<p>   political lifetime of most of the players on the Australian political</p>
<p>   scene now. The Labor Party certainly won't do it. I mean they</p>
<p>   are adopting the most incredibly negative backward-looking attitude.</p>
<p>   One Nation is totally opposed to it. The Coalition is committed</p>
<p>   to it.</p>
<p>I know that there is a degree of uncertainty caused by Asia but</p>
<p>   that really is a reason to go ahead because if you think there is</p>
<p>   nervousness now, if the Government looked as though it were losing</p>
<p>   its nerve about reform that would increase the nervousness. The</p>
<p>   business community would be very unhappy with that. The business</p>
<p>   community would say, look this is no good, this is a Government</p>
<p>   that's lost its nerve. They won't get any comfort from</p>
<p>   the other side because they don't have any commitment to reform.</p>
<p>   I think it is precisely because things are difficult in Asia that</p>
<p>   we must press ahead with reform because Asia won't remain depressed</p>
<p>   or in a weakened economic condition in debt forever and we need</p>
<p>   to be as strong as possible when the Asian upswing takes place and</p>
<p>   that means having a better tax system.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>No blinking?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER: </p>
<p>No blinking on tax.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>When....is there a possibility or is there a danger of Australia</p>
<p>   going into recession?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER: </p>
<p>No, no, I don't. There is too much negative talk around at</p>
<p>   the present time. There are too many visiting international spokesmen</p>
<p>   on the economy who have responsibility to international financial</p>
<p>   organisations and to nobody else who indulge themselves with doomsday</p>
<p>   negative talk visiting other countries and they don't really</p>
<p>   serve the interests of the organisations they work for and they</p>
<p>   certainly don't serve the interests of this country.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Telstra.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER: </p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Are you committed to the sale?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER: </p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>No blinking on Telstra?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER: </p>
<p>No, I believe that the sale to the Australian public of the remainder</p>
<p>   of Telstra as previously announced is a good policy. I said when</p>
<p>   I announced it that there would be a social bonus that could be</p>
<p>   made available out of the proceeds of the sale and that's a</p>
<p>   very important element and the Government hasn't announced</p>
<p>   what that social bonus is but we're having discussions with</p>
<p>   a number of people including a number of our colleagues about it.</p>
<p>   But the sale of Telstra is very much part of the debt retirement</p>
<p>   structure and programme and profile of the Government.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>How do you get it through? Senator Harradine's already talking</p>
<p>   about blocking it, we've got the National Party, or individual</p>
<p>   members of the National Party, talking about crossing the floor,</p>
<p>   how do you get it through?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER: </p>
<p>Well I guess we would put it up and see who votes for it. It's</p>
<p>   already gone through the House of Representatives Neil.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>But you agree you are going to have trouble getting it through</p>
<p>   the Senate?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER: </p>
<p>You never know with the Senate until the last minute whether or</p>
<p>   not you are going to get a Bill but it's our policy to do it</p>
<p>   and we'll be proceeding with it and we hope that we can get</p>
<p>   the necessary support from Senator Harradine.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Well, not only Senator Harradine but you own Coalition - will it</p>
<p>   divide the Coalition?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER: </p>
<p>No, I don't think in the end it's going to divide the</p>
<p>   Coalition. People, as is the case with the Coalition, are expressing</p>
<p>   a range of views, that often happens, nothing wrong with that.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>But they are talking about crossing the floor?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER: </p>
<p>Well hang on, the people who have spoken about that have already</p>
<p>   voted in favour of it. I mean....and I say that again, the people</p>
<p>   who have spoken out on this issue are members of the lower House</p>
<p>   and they have already voted for it.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Okay so....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER: </p>
<p>It's been, I mean it's been through the lower House.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Well, what about Senator Macdonald?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER: </p>
<p>Well let's wait and see. </p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>But he's not lower House.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER: </p>
<p>No, I know.....</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>[Inaudible] Sandy Macdonald......</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER: </p>
<p>Well let's just wait and see. I don't think I remember</p>
<p>   seeing him actually say that.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Well he says if he, he quoted in The Age today saying he'll</p>
<p>   only support a further16% sale of Telstra.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER: </p>
<p>Well let's wait and see.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>You've spoken to the....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER: </p>
<p>I talk to people everyday but I don't tell the rest of the</p>
<p>   world who I talk to everyday but we'll be proceeding and we</p>
<p>   want to get the Bill through. The social bonus that I talked about</p>
<p>   of course was linked with the sale of the whole of the remaining</p>
<p>   two thirds of Telstra.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>The bonus, is there any link between the sale of Telstra and tax</p>
<p>   reform?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER: </p>
<p>Only in a very indirect sense because if you sell Telstra over</p>
<p>   time you reduce the amount of money that you have to pay interest</p>
<p>   on and that money might be available to finance tax cuts.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Okay, will the tax cuts be contingent on Telstra's sale?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, they're not.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>...[inaudible].. Telstra Mr Howard, in your discussions with Senator</p>
<p>   Harradine about Wik and other matters, well Wik specifically, did</p>
<p>   you discuss Telstra as well?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Only in a very tangential way.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Do you think he'll support you?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>You'll have to ask him that. </p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>I'll try but what do you think?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>That is a matter for him.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Hello Adrian, go ahead please.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>Yes Prime Minister, look, first, a couple of points. Firstly I'd</p>
<p>   like to congratulate you on the Wik decision, being able to get</p>
<p>   that through. Now secondly, one of our problems is, I'm a,</p>
<p>   you could say, migrant - I've got Sri Lankan ancestry. Now</p>
<p>   I've got a problem with, basically, look I support Liberals</p>
<p>   sort of economic sort of aspects of the Liberal system, but I have</p>
<p>   a problem this time because I feel so much about the race issue</p>
<p>   that I find it hard to support you John Howard when I don't</p>
<p>   believe that you've made a big enough stand on these sort of</p>
<p>   situations. I believe that in, by you saying things like, we should</p>
<p>   debate immigration and that, I don't think, at this time, that</p>
<p>   that's the sort of a ball that we should put out on the court</p>
<p>   for everybody to play.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I don't agree you. I think one of the reasons why One</p>
<p>   Nation has gathered support is that people in Australia have felt</p>
<p>   over the years that they've been denied the opportunity of</p>
<p>   talking openly about sensitive issues. I mean whenever you suppress</p>
<p>   debate, whenever you intimidate people out of saying what they think,</p>
<p>   you breed a resentment and you encourage those people to believe</p>
<p>   that there's some kind of conspiracy to shut them up and One</p>
<p>   Nation has fed on that. The best way to counter racism is to openly</p>
<p>   debate issues. They've got to be debated in a moderate intelligent</p>
<p>   fashion. When I say let's have a debate on immigration, my</p>
<p>   contribution to that debate will be to say that as far as I'm</p>
<p>   concerned Australia should maintain a racially non-discriminatory</p>
<p>   immigration policy. We shouldn't choose people on the basis</p>
<p>   of the colour of their skin or their ethnic background, we should</p>
<p>   choose them on the basis of the contribution they make to Australia</p>
<p>   subject to a component for refugees and family reunions.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, do you believe Kim Beazley's supporting One Nation?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Kim Beazley supports One Nation's policies on a lot of issues.</p>
<p>   His economic policies and One Nation's policies are closer</p>
<p>   together than they are of course to the Coalition. I mean they're</p>
<p>   both opposed to tax reform. They both sound as though they're</p>
<p>   in favour of a backward looking approach to imports and exports.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Do you think he's going soft on them?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I don't know what he.....I mean I don't know. I do think</p>
<p>   that he sought to exploit them to disadvantage us politically but</p>
<p>   as a matter of a principle his policies in many areas are much closer</p>
<p>   to those of One Nation than are the policies of the Coalition but</p>
<p>   in reply to the gentleman, I think it's a huge mistake to say</p>
<p>   that the Australian public is not mature enough to debate particular</p>
<p>   issues and all that does is to breed resentment and a belief that</p>
<p>   they, the public, is being told by the political elites of the nation:</p>
<p>   "keep quiet, leave these difficult issues to us, we're</p>
<p>   the only people mature enough to handle them, you're all a</p>
<p>   bit ignorant and why don't you go away and leave it all to</p>
<p>   us". Now it's that which has generated the sense of alienation</p>
<p>   and resentment amongst many people and it's been part of the</p>
<p>   fertile breeding ground of some of these odd alternative views.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>.....policies are being reported today in more detail on New Zealanders</p>
<p>   - restricting the numbers of New Zealanders coming into this country.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I haven't seen the details of that. Look we, in the</p>
<p>   Coalition, understand there are concerns in some areas and we've</p>
<p>   acted on them. I mean, we after all brought in the two year waiting</p>
<p>   period for migrants getting welfare benefits. Mrs Hanson did not</p>
<p>   support that proposal when it went through Parliament. We acted</p>
<p>   in relation to giving people who had a knowledge of the English</p>
<p>   language, some additional preference in getting to Australia but</p>
<p>   we would never be stupid enough to go so far as to say you can't</p>
<p>   come to Australia unless you can already speak English. That would</p>
<p>   just have denied us some wonderful Australians. I mentioned some</p>
<p>   of them, Sir Arvi Parbo, the late Victor Chang, indeed four or five</p>
<p>   members of the Federal Parliamentary Liberal Party were born in</p>
<p>   other countries, came to Australia without being able to speak a</p>
<p>   word of English. Now it is national self-denial, it's a timid</p>
<p>   frightened view of life, to say that we're not cosmopolitan</p>
<p>   and open and sophisticated enough as a country to allow people in</p>
<p>   who initially can't speak English.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Adrian, thank you for calling. Hi Matt, go ahead please.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>Yes, Mr Howard, I've been listening to you on the radio for</p>
<p>   a long time and reading lots of newspaper articles about this tax</p>
<p>   reform. I just want to ask you one question; what is the hold-up?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>We're finishing the details. It's a very complicated</p>
<p>   exercise and we've got to get the figures right and there is</p>
<p>   a lot of debate and discussion inside the Government, particularly</p>
<p>   between the Treasurer and myself and other senior Ministers, about</p>
<p>   the final shape of the policy.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Is there disagreement within the Government?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>There's debate. There's no serious disagreement, but</p>
<p>   Neil, this is a huge issue.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Well there's a huge expectation....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I know that...</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>....get back to this business point. If you are going to do it</p>
<p>   in stages rather than in one hit I think people will be surprised...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well just, I should say I think you should just wait and see. And</p>
<p>   it won't be long but I'm not going to be pushed into a</p>
<p>   corner on the time. </p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Are you at least willing to say whether it will be staged which</p>
<p>   is a rolling reform....what the Treasurer's saying.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, let's wait and see the entire package when it comes</p>
<p>   out and you'll, I'm sure, the business community in particular,</p>
<p>   will be very pleased with it.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>The Premier here in Victoria, Mr Kennett, said yesterday that he</p>
<p>   had been approached by people to make a move to Canberra. Do you</p>
<p>   want him up there?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>He's always welcome.</p>
<p> MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Have you got a comment on his leadership versus your style of</p>
<p>   leadership?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh, look I don't know whatever reasons people for wanting</p>
<p>   different personalities at different times change. If Jeff wants</p>
<p>   to come to Canberra he'll be very welcome but that's a</p>
<p>   matter for him.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Have you ever talked to him about it?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I don't think I've talked to him for several years about</p>
<p>   it. I don't think I have, no.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>But when you talked to him about it several years ago, were you</p>
<p>   trying to get him there?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, he was making it plain to me why he would never come. He was</p>
<p>   giving me some well chosen remarks about what a disastrous place</p>
<p>   he thought it was. </p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>... it wasn't over a car phone, was it?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, it was in person, over a drink.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>The banks. There's a survey that's been done by, I think</p>
<p>   it is KPMG, which shows that the banks are going to take one billion</p>
<p>   dollars extr</p>
