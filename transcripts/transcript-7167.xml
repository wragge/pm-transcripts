PRIME MINISTER<br />
CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY<br />
ETHNIC COMMUNITIES MEETING<br />
MELBOURNE 26 APRIL 1987<br />
Ladies and Gentlemen, fellow Australians, friends.<br />
Some forty years ago, in the aftermath of war, the Labor<br />
Government led by Ben Chifley took a visionary,<br />
compassionate and historic decision.<br />
It opened the doors of Australia to a great wave of<br />
migration. That was a decision that offered new opportunities in a new<br />
society for a generation of people weary of the warfare and<br />
privation of Europe.<br />
It was a decision that allowed old cultures to flourish<br />
again in a new land, enriching and diversifying the<br />
Australian society.<br />
It was also a decision that provided a great new engine of<br />
manpower, a mass of workers whose energy, experience, and<br />
expereise helped build Australia's post-war prosperity to<br />
new levels.<br />
A generation later another Labor Government the Whitlam<br />
Government expunged the last traces of ethnic preference<br />
from our migration policy.<br />
It is with that great Labor tradition behind me that<br />
tradition of vision, compassion, courage and fairness -that<br />
I speak to you today<br />
Now I know some of you have come here today to register your<br />
concern about the SBS. I have some important comments to<br />
make about the SBS but let me return to that topic later.<br />
At the outset I want to take this opportunity to reaffirm<br />
the principles and policies which my Government has<br />
developed to guide its hand in the field of ethnic and<br />
multicultural affairs.<br />
We believe that all Australians, irrespective of their<br />
ethnic background, their cultural heritage or their<br />
linguistic tradition, should be able to exercise their<br />
rights and obligations as full and equal members of the<br />
community. </p>
<p>We hold that belief not as an empty rhetorical device to be<br />
endorsed in isolation, but as the basis of a real commitment<br />
to ensure those rights and obligations can actually be<br />
exercised. So we believe all Australians should be able to develop<br />
their skills and abilities without discrimination or<br />
prejudice. We believe multiculturalism is central to any commitment to<br />
social justice.<br />
We believe all Australians should have equitable access to<br />
government services.<br />
We believe all Australians are entitled to a fair go.<br />
These are goals for which we strive despite the difficult<br />
economic climate and in the face of an exhaustive and<br />
continuing search for savings in Government expenditure.<br />
Despite the restraint imposed on us by the economic<br />
environment, we have taken important steps to achieve those<br />
goals. Today let me outline some of these initiatives for you.<br />
We have for example provided funding to a large and diverse<br />
number of community groups through the Grant-in-Aid program.<br />
These grants are intended to help those groups in their work<br />
of easing the difficult years of transition of newly arrived<br />
migrants into the Australian society.<br />
Over the four years in which we have been in office, the<br />
number of grants has increased by 40 per cent, to just over<br />
200. Since we came to office we have more than doubled<br />
total spending on the scheme.<br />
At the same time, we are studying the way the grants are<br />
administered, and Mick Young is now arranging for closer<br />
co-ordination between his Department of Immigration and<br />
Ethnic Affairs and the Department of Community Services.<br />
This process has already yielded fruit.<br />
We have already approved a number of funding proposals for<br />
ethnic groups under the Home and Community program of the<br />
Department of Community Services.<br />
This will allow the provision of nursing home, hostel and<br />
other facilities to care for Australia's growing population<br />
of elderly people born in non-English speaking countries.<br />
In other words, we are endeavouring to meet the needs of the<br />
ethnic communities through the broader programs of all<br />
relevant departments. </p>
<p>Another significant development towards the achievement of<br />
our goals is the recent establishment of the Office of<br />
Multicultural Affairs and the Advisory Council on<br />
Multicultural Affairs.<br />
These two bodies will enhance our capacity to bring into<br />
being a truly multicultural Australia.<br />
The Office of Multicultural Affairs is located within my own<br />
Department. This ensures it will have an input at the<br />
highest level of government.<br />
In fact, the Office is able to be involved in each and every<br />
proposal that comes before the Government in terms of its<br />
impact upon Australia's multicultural society.<br />
The Advisory Council on Multicultural Affairs is just as<br />
important. Its diverse and highly skilled membership is a true<br />
reflection of Australia's multicultural identity.<br />
I want both the Office and the Advisory Council to work<br />
actively at keeping open the channels of communication<br />
between my Government and ethnic communities.<br />
I do not want them to be token bodies. I want ideas from<br />
them, not platitudes realistic options, not rhetoric.<br />
In particular, I have asked the Advisory Council to<br />
formulate a National Agenda for Multicultural Australia<br />
that is, a program of specific priorities that will<br />
translate the philosophy of multiculturalism into a series<br />
of long-term, concrete initiatives.<br />
The National Agenda will give definition, direction and<br />
drive to the policy of multiculturalism.<br />
I am looking to all ethnic communities to contribute to this<br />
process so that the National Agenda truly reflects realistic<br />
and genuinely held priorities.<br />
Let me turn to another initiative of my Government in which<br />
we have demonstrated our commitment to advancing the cause<br />
of multiculturalism the implementation of a national<br />
policy on languages.<br />
Our linguistic richness is a rare and valuable resource<br />
which we should develop to advance the domestic and external<br />
interests of the nation.<br />
People who lack an adequate command of spoken and written<br />
English are inevitably disadvantaged in our society.<br />
English must remain the national language.<br />
But there are also sound reasons why the many languages used<br />
in the Australian community today should be maintained as a<br />
legitimate part of the Australian heritage.<br />
I I </p>
<p>There are equally sound reasons why English-speakers should<br />
learn some of the languages now spoken every day by their<br />
fellow Australians.<br />
Knowledge of another tongue promotes tolerance and<br />
understanding across cultural differences.<br />
And in a world where Australia's economic and political<br />
destiny lies with people who speak Japanese, Chinese, Bahasa<br />
Indonesia or Arabic as much as English, we would be foolish<br />
to place ourselves at a disadvantage.<br />
As ' The Age' newspaper commented only on Friday, the onus is<br />
now on us to speak the languages of our trading partners,<br />
rather than the reverse.<br />
The Government commissioned Mr Joe Lo Bianco to prepare a<br />
report on a national policy on languages.<br />
The Lo Bianco report provides a blueprint for how Australia<br />
can best use its language skills so as to reap some of these<br />
benefits. The Government endorses that Report.<br />
Accordingly I have asked Susan Ryan and Mick Young to<br />
develop a detailed submission on this.<br />
Let me take this opportunity to announce that we are<br />
committed to fund an integrated package in the August budget<br />
to implement a national policy on languages.<br />
All of these initiatives, as I said at the outset, are being<br />
undertaken in the face of Australia's dramatic economic<br />
challenges.<br />
When we came to office four years ago we had to reverse the<br />
terrible effects of the Fraser/ Howard recession.<br />
We did reverse that recession and we were rebuilding<br />
national economic growth.<br />
But then the collapse in the prices earned by many of our<br />
primary commodities presented us with a new challenge a<br />
challenge to restructure the economy, a challenge to become<br />
more innovative and competitive in the way we earn our<br />
national income, a challenge to build sustainable economic<br />
growth for all Australians.<br />
I am totally confident in our capacity to overcome these<br />
challenges. That confidence is based on the belief that the<br />
Australian people will accept the short term sacrifices<br />
which are necessary to achieve our goal.<br />
I do not want to pretend that our economic problems are<br />
solved. Indeed, Paul Keating will next month bring down a<br />
May Statement in which we will be continuing our tough<br />
approach to finding new spending cuts. </p>
<p>But I do want to say very positively that the curbs on wages<br />
and government spending have a definite purpose: long-term<br />
prosperity for all Australians.<br />
At the same time, we have also taken pains to ensure that<br />
the burdens those curbs impose have been shared as fairly as<br />
possible. The Government has ensured that the momentum of growth in<br />
central social areas has continued.<br />
Employment, for example, remains the key to economic<br />
well-being and individual fulfilment.<br />
Under my government, more than three quarters of a million<br />
new jobs have been created.<br />
Migrants have reaped the benefits of this growth.<br />
In 1983 overseas-born Australians from non-English speaking<br />
countries had an unemployment rate one-third higher than<br />
that of native-born Australians. Today that rate has been<br />
reduced to one-quarter. That is still too high, but it is<br />
real progress nevertheless.<br />
And women in particular have benefited from the growth in<br />
jobs including many migrant women and women of migrant<br />
descent. Again, in meeting the challenge of restructuring our<br />
industries, we are making sure that workers, including<br />
migrant workers, are protected.<br />
Restructuring is necessary to make our manufacturing sector<br />
more competitive and less cocooned from the stimulus of<br />
international competition. The depreciation of the dollar<br />
has opened up great new vistas for our manufacturers.<br />
The burden of restructuring must be borne equitably. In<br />
devising a new plan for the textiles, clothing and footwear<br />
industry, for example, we were conscious of the large number<br />
of migrant workers particularly women in this sector.<br />
Thus the restructuring plan for this industry contains<br />
special provisions for workers to acquire new skills, move<br />
to other industries, widen their horizons, and compete more<br />
effectively for other jobs.<br />
Education, too, is a critical means for Australians of<br />
migrant origin to achieve effective participation in this<br />
society. Our policies are designed to help more young<br />
Australians benefit from the education system and they are<br />
bearing fruit. </p>
<p>More and more students are staying at school to complete<br />
Year 12 and there is some evidence that students from<br />
non-English speaking backgrounds are more likely than others<br />
to be among those who complete secondary school. These<br />
students also seem more likely to attend university.<br />
These increases in retention rates have not come about by<br />
accident. The government has provided improved income<br />
support for students and is also endeavouring to increase<br />
access to and participation in higher education.<br />
Further we have chalked up some considerable achievements in<br />
the teaching of English to adult migrants, through the Adult<br />
Migrant Education Program ( AMEP).<br />
We have developed a permanent teaching service for the AMEP;<br />
we have provided childcare to some 60 AMEP classes<br />
throughout Australia to ensure that women can attend the<br />
classes; and we have increased funding for the Program to<br />
some $ 50 million this year.<br />
The quality of the service has been improved through the<br />
establishment of new education centres, steady progress in<br />
professional development, and the establishment of the<br />
National Curriculum Resource Centre.<br />
The recent independent review of the AMEP has confirmed the<br />
value of the service and provided a blueprint for its future<br />
development. My Government will continue to give high<br />
priority to this program.<br />
Now, finally, let me return to the immediate purpose of<br />
today's meeting. I said at the outset that I have some<br />
important news for you about SBS.<br />
As part of our response to our national economic challenge,<br />
my Government has made it clear that no area of Government<br />
expenditure will remain immune from rigorous scrutiny.<br />
AS part of that commitment, we made the decision to merge<br />
the Special Broadcasting Service with the ABC.<br />
That decision was made with the clear intention that SBS<br />
would benefit, not suffer, from the amalgamation that is,<br />
that while the amalgamation would produce some savings<br />
through more efficient operation, it would also enhance the<br />
SBS's ability to broadcast good quality radio and TV<br />
programs. Indeed, I insisted that the Government receive formal<br />
advice, before we took any decision on the merger, that the<br />
SBS's capacity would be improved through its access to the<br />
larger capital and equipment resources of the ABC.<br />
The decision we took was thus consistent with our commitment<br />
to ensure that taxpayers' funds are used in the most<br />
efficient and effective way possible. </p>
<p>7<br />
However the legislation we introduced into Parliament to<br />
achieve these improvements through amalgamation was rejected<br />
by the Opposition parties in the Senate last December.<br />
That rejection has prevented us from making any savings for<br />
the time being and has meant the advantages which we<br />
intended to pass on to SBS have not been able to be passed<br />
on. That presents the Government with two alternatives. We could<br />
proceed with the amalgamation by administrative means a<br />
course which we had rejected from the outset as<br />
unacceptable.. We have decided therefore to take the other alternative: to<br />
drop the legislation entirely and not to proceed with the<br />
plans for the amalgamation.<br />
We will however ensure that cost savings are made within the<br />
publicly funded broadcasting sector to offset the savings<br />
that had been anticipated.<br />
I am well aware that the merger decision was not a popular<br />
one with many of you though some of the criticism was I<br />
believe based on a confused understanding of the proposal.<br />
It is to end that confusion, and to clear up any<br />
misperceptions that may exist about the Government's<br />
intentions, that we have decided to take the proposal off<br />
the Government's agenda.<br />
The legislation will not be re-introduced.<br />
And savings will still be achieved.<br />
And let me make this promise: any future consideration we<br />
may give to the Special Broadcasting Service will be on the<br />
basis of full consultation with and understanding by the<br />
ethnic communities. Should there be any such consideration,<br />
our new Advisory Committee would have an important role to<br />
play.<br />
We are fully committed to ensuring that SBS effectively<br />
carries out its role as a national broadcaster for a<br />
multicultural Australia.<br />
We remain equally committed to ensuring that the ABC become<br />
more effective in dollar value terms, in the services it<br />
delivers to all Australians.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen,<br />
I do not come to this meeting as a recent convert to the<br />
benefits of Australia's migration program or to the cause of<br />
multiculturalism. </p>
<p>8<br />
For forty years now -since I joined the Australian Labor<br />
Party in 1947 when I was a student at the University of<br />
western Australia I have been utterly convinced that<br />
Australia and Australians can only gain strength from the<br />
influx of settlers from overseas.<br />
Indeed one of the reasons why I joined the ALP was my sense<br />
of excitement at the vast immigration program then being<br />
initiated by the Chifley Labor Government a program that<br />
laid the foundations for the enormous growth of the<br />
Australian economy in the post-war years.<br />
Later on as President of the Australian Council of Trade<br />
Unions, I was closely involved in working with governments<br />
of both political persuasions in implementing their<br />
immigration policies.<br />
So it is a particular source of pride to me now as Prime<br />
minister that under my Government Australia's migration<br />
intake continues to gather pace and that we are continuing<br />
to build a truly multicultural society.<br />
We are committed to maintaining the momentum of immigration<br />
for we believe firmly that it brings not just economic<br />
benefits but yields social and cultural and humanitarian<br />
advantages for the whole population.<br />
As proud as I am of Labor's special achievements in creating<br />
the immigration program, it is important to understand that<br />
immigration was, until very recently, a program which<br />
enjoyed bipartisan support.<br />
I readily pay tribute to the work of previous Liberal<br />
ministers for immigration. one of them I believe stands<br />
out Ian Macphee, a sensitive minister, an architect of<br />
multiculturalism, a friend of many ethnic groups and a man<br />
who still holds the respect of many individuals involved in<br />
the field of immigration and ethnic affairs.<br />
Mr Macphee's relegation to the backbench of his Party takes<br />
place at a time when the would-be hijackers of the Liberal<br />
Party the New Right are themselves becoming more<br />
strident in their attacks not just on multiculturalism but<br />
on many of the common decencies of Australian life.<br />
So in closing let me express the wish that we might return<br />
to the spirit of bipartisanship in immigration and ethnic<br />
affairs. Together, let us continue building a better and<br />
wiser Australia, committed in word and in practice to the<br />
principle of equality of opportunity for all Australians. </p>
