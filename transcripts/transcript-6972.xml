AUSTRALIA.,<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 4 JULY 1986<br />
Agreement has been reached with Vatican authorities on the<br />
program for the visit to Australia by Pope John Paul II.<br />
In the course of his stay, the Pope will visit Canberra and all<br />
State capital cities. In the Northern Territory, he will visit<br />
both Darwin and Alice Springs. In Canberra, which will be the<br />
Pope's point of arrival in Australia, the Government will hold a<br />
reception in his honour.<br />
The Government is delighted that the Pope is able to make the<br />
visit, which is in response to invitations from the Government<br />
and the Catholic Bishops of Australia. I am a taking close<br />
interest in the visit and, to this end, I have appointed Mr<br />
Hurford to assist with the Government's involvement.<br />
The Pope is a Head of State and a leading world figure. It is<br />
appropriate that he should come to Australia in the International<br />
Year of Peace as Australia has given international peace<br />
initiatives a high priority in our foreign policy.<br />
The Pope will spend the greater part of his time meeting the<br />
people of Australia. There is already eager anticipation within<br />
the Australian community about the visit and a great many groups<br />
from widely differing backgrounds are involved in preparations<br />
for it.<br />
The Pope's general itinerary is attached. </p>
