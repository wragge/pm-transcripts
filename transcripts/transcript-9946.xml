STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
FOOD EXPORTS TO ASIA<br />
I am pleased to announce thaot we wiln establish six Regional Export Freight<br />
Councils throughout Australia to co-ordinate strategies aimed at our greatly<br />
expanding exports of perishable goods to the rapidly growing Asian markets.<br />
In addition, we will fund a special study to provide a commercial and<br />
independent assessment of the potential of inland New South Wales to be a<br />
major source of food for Asia. This study will evaluate the potential demand for<br />
air freight and the need to improve aviation infrastructure in the region.<br />
Background<br />
When I visited Orange in September last year, I was pleased to be able to<br />
discuss with industry leaders and the local community the enormous potential<br />
the APEC markets provide for our food exports. To date our efforts have been<br />
rather uncoordinated -for every success there has been another story of<br />
frustration. But those successes highlight just how rich the rewards could be with a smarter<br />
and more focussed effort. It was with this in mind that I established a Working<br />
Group to review impediments to the export of perishable produce. The Working<br />
Group reported to Government at the end of last year. Their advice proved to<br />
be an important input into the food export strategy that my colleagues, Senators<br />
Collins, Cook and McMullan, announced at the end of January.<br />
The essence of the Workin Group's recommendations was that the overrding<br />
need was to improve the communication and focus of all links in the export<br />
freight chain. That is, we have to get the software of the system right and have<br />
all players focussed on a comnmon objective.<br />
The Report considered in detail a number of proposals that have aimed to<br />
encourage the developmnent of air freight hubs throughout the country. There is<br />
lWte doubt that the demand for dedicated air freight will increase considerabl<br />
over the coming few years and that we must ensure that we have suitable<br />
policies and infrastructure to support At.<br />

<p>We already have first-class aviation facilities in most of our major cities that<br />
could support 747 freighters. Adelaide will join this list following the extension<br />
of its runway. This is not the case, however, for much of inland Australia. The<br />
Working Group's Report accordingly provides some preliminary assessment of<br />
proposals for aviation infrastructure to support international freight from the<br />
region. The Inland Marketing Corporation's proposal to have the Parkes Airport<br />
developed into an international transport hub warranted particular attention<br />
because it had been advanced more than any others.<br />
The Working Group's Report concluded, however, that on present trends the<br />
proposal may not be a commercial proposition for some time.<br />
But, of course, we should not be relying solely on present trends. Rather we<br />
need to take a strategic view of how to greatly expand our exports of food<br />
products tailored to the new markets in Asia. We need to look beyond current<br />
practice and analyse the commercial potential of focussing producers<br />
throughout the region on these opportunities.<br />
It is against this background that we have decided to provide $ 2.7 million over 3<br />
years to set up six Regional Export Freight Councils that will co-ordinate action<br />
throughout the country. These Councils will operate under the umbrella of the<br />
Agri-Food Council which now has transport as a high priority.<br />
It is also clear that current proposals, including the Inland Marketing<br />
Corporation's proposal, are not sufficiently advanced for the Government to<br />
commit infrastructure funds unconditionally. We have thus decided to provide<br />
$ 300,000 for a special comprehensive study into the potential of inland New<br />
South Wales as a source of food for Asia. The study will provide a commercial<br />
and independent assessment of the opportunities as well as particular<br />
investment and infrastructure needs.<br />
Much of the investment can be expected to be funded by the private sector.<br />
However, based on this study, the Government will look favourably on<br />
supporting any strategic infrastructure funding, including the possible<br />
development of an inland international airport.<br />
