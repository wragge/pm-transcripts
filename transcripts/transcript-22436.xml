    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Government has decided to substantially strengthen the Australian Federal Police's capacity to respond to international crises, particularly in our region.</p>
<p>  The AFP's International Deployment Group (IDG) will be increased by about 400 personnel, taking the total to 1200.</p>
<p>This will be the largest single increase in AFP staff since the force was established in 1979.</p>
<p> The extra resources will allow the IDG to establish a 150-strong Operational Response Group that is ready to respond at short notice to emerging law and order issues and undertake stabilisation operations.</p>
<p>The boost to AFP operations will cost $493 million   over the next five years.</p>
<p>Australia must be prepared to respond and help in our region when necessary.  Through this expansion, our law enforcement officials will be even better placed to meet new challenges.</p>
<p> Law enforcement has been a key component of recent Australian assistance missions to fragile states such as Solomons Islands, East Timor and Papua New Guinea.</p>
<p>AFP and Australian Defence Force personnel have worked side-by-side to restore stability after recent violence and unrest in Dili and Honiara.</p>
<p>The expansion will allow the AFP to respond more quickly and comprehensively to crisis situations and will help to strengthen law enforcement capabilities across our region.  International and regional challenges will continue to confront us.</p>
<p> Today's announcement complements yesterday's increase in the size of the Australian Army.  These decisions will ensure that the Government can continue to provide the right mix of law enforcement and military responses to emerging challenges in the region.</p>
<p> Since the Government first announced the establishment of the IDG in early 2004 it has played a vital role in meeting ongoing regional security requirements.  The IDG currently has 470 members deployed overseas in Solomon Islands, East Timor, Nauru, Vanuatu, Sudan, Cyprus and Jordan.</p>
<p>The announcement underscores the Government's commitment to maintain stability in our region and enhance our national security.</p>
