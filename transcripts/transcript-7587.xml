PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF JOINT NEWS CONFERENCE WITH THE HON MICHAEL FIELD,<br />
MLA, CITY MILL BUILDING, HOBART, 6 MAY 1989<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
PM: I'm very pleased to be over here in Hobart this morning<br />
with Michael Field and I want at the outset to pay tribute to<br />
the way in a very short time he's established himself as a very<br />
dynamic Leader of the Labor Party and from what I'm about to<br />
say you'll understand that that's not just a formal<br />
acknowledgement of a dynamic new Leader but that there is very<br />
strong evidence of that fact. I'm here today to say tha I'<br />
very pleased to be able to announce that agreement has been<br />
reached between my Federal Labor Government and Michael on<br />
behalf of the Tasmanian Labor Party to explore the feasibility<br />
of establishing here in Tasmania Australia's first unbleached<br />
paper mill after the election of the Labor Government next<br />
Saturday. Michael Field came to see me in Canberra last<br />
Tuesday night, he brought his idea and explained to me that<br />
idea and as a result of those discussions which he initiated,<br />
we've agreed that a study will be conducted into the<br />
feasibility of what we can call an environmentally friendly<br />
mill for Tasmania to produce unbleached paper and paper<br />
products. We had already made a decision that we were going to<br />
be sending an expert team to Finland and Sweden to investigate<br />
the operation of paper mills in those two very important<br />
countries. But as a result of Michael Field's intervention and<br />
suggestion to me we have agreed to add Lo the terms of<br />
reference of that team of experts so that in addition to what<br />
they were going to be doing before they will be investigating<br />
the processes for the production of unbleached paper and also<br />
the potential for expanded markets for unbleached paper<br />
products. Now I want , to say that as a result of Michael's<br />
discussions with me, we have reached the agreement, ( b)<br />
added to the terms of reference of that team~ of experts and ( c)<br />
indicated that rasmania's representatives will. be involved<br />
beyond the return of that team of experts in the evaluation of'<br />
the missions' technical report and any follow-up work that's<br />
involved. And using data gathered by that mission, which as I<br />
say has been upgraded in its work as a result of Michael's<br />
reference to me, that using that data from that mission a<br />
Tasmanian Labor Government after the next election will conduct<br />
a major feasibility study into an unbleached paper products<br />
plant in Tasmania. That study will cover the potential </p>
<p>( PM cont) Australian and international markets for unbleached<br />
paper Products and the economic environmental and social<br />
implications of an unbleached Paper Products Plant. Let me say<br />
that we've agreed that industry will be invited to Participate<br />
in the State Government's feasibility study. Importantly we've<br />
agreed, both of us, on behalf of my Government and the<br />
Government that he'll be forming after Saturday that our two<br />
Government's would lead the way in using high quality<br />
unbleached paper produced by the mill so that there would be<br />
quite clearly a substantial market involved in that and we<br />
would then do our best to convince Australians to choose<br />
unbleached paper products wherever practicable and in that way<br />
we'll obviously be creating a market for environmentally clean<br />
processes and importantly helping to establish jobs for<br />
Tasmanians. Now let me conclude as I began by Paying tribute<br />
to Michael Field, as I say he's been a Leader for a relatively<br />
short time. If Tasmanians wanted any proof at all and they<br />
may have if they wanted any proof at all of the dynamism, the<br />
imagination, the capacity for decisions and a commitment<br />
tenaciously to pursue the interests of Tasmanians it's been<br />
dramatically provided by -this imaginative concept to which we<br />
have responded immediately and positively and one can say that<br />
here you have the proof positive if you're Tasmanians<br />
interested with your future welfare, proof Positive of the way<br />
in which Labor in this State is able to work positively,<br />
constructive and immediately with the Federal Government in a<br />
way which stands in stark contrast with the confrontationism<br />
which seems to be the characteristic of the Present Premier of<br />
this State.<br />
FIELD: I welcome the opportunity in my first discussions with<br />
the Prime Minister as Leader, to get such a Positive result.<br />
We're committed in Tasmania -to downstreaming our products,<br />
particularly wood. At the moment we're exporting some three<br />
million tonnes of wood in woodchips to Japan. Obviously that<br />
can't go on indefinitely but we want to make sure that we have<br />
the cleanest possible process here in Tasmania as soon as we<br />
can but we don't want to rush into it so that we adopt<br />
development at any price. Now with this latest advancement and<br />
the study that's been announced today, we are going to be<br />
certain that Tasmania will lead the world with the Pulp and<br />
paper mill to produce unbleached paper and that to me is a<br />
great breakthrough because Tasmania's future is producing<br />
environmentally friendly products onto a quality world market<br />
and this is symbolic of the direction of a new Labor Government<br />
that will be elected next Saturday. That's really all I wish<br />
to say in addition to what the Prime Minister has said.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister does this mean that in future you'd<br />
be less enthusiastic about approving the construction of<br />
bleached kraft pulp mills? </p>
<p>PM: Well let me say this. The mission that we had already<br />
approved to go over was to examine those existing type of mills<br />
because we want to have a situation where at least we are as<br />
well informed as we possibly can be about what are the<br />
environmentally most acceptable processes in regard to existing<br />
types of kraft works. So it's sensible that we have that<br />
information. When Michael came and saw me and said, " now look<br />
can't we together look at the concept of the unbleached mill",<br />
it made sense to do that and we will be giving priority in our<br />
consideration to that proposal. But it remains sensible that<br />
we look at the other area as well. But we'll give this a<br />
priority, it's new, it's exciting, it offers all the<br />
possibilities of environmentally acceptable standards jobs<br />
and there is evidence around the world now that people are<br />
looking in a variety of products for the unbleached product. I<br />
mean let me mention this for instance in the area of disposable<br />
nappies and tampons. There is a growing concern now that there<br />
may be possible dangers in the bleached products and there's a<br />
move towards considering the use of unbleached products. Some<br />
computer operators also are looking at environmentally friendly<br />
paper for computer operations. So it makes a great deal of<br />
sense to pick up Michael Field's suggestion and try and get<br />
Tasmania in at the forefront of that. We'll still have a look<br />
at whether there are ways in which it would be environmentally<br />
acceptable processes for the other but it's quite clear that we<br />
just were not going to buy the sort of proposals that were put<br />
up before.<br />
JOURNALIST: With the marketing could the Federal Government<br />
help the unbleached paper<br />
PM: Yes I said<br />
JOURNALIST: inaudible<br />
PM: Well I've said that we've agreed there that as far as our<br />
two Governments are concerned that we would use that product<br />
JOURNALIST: inaudible<br />
PM: I think in our case it's between and I say this with a<br />
pretty wide but I think it's of the order of 10 to 15,000<br />
tonnes as far as the Commonwealth Government is concerned. I<br />
don't know what the Tasmanian Government would use but I would<br />
think that if the Commowealth Government gave that sort of lead<br />
that it would be, I think, influential in affecting other<br />
governments and a lot of users.<br />
JOURNALIST: As a proportion </p>
<p>PM: And of course could I just add to that that this would not<br />
only be in terms of domestic markets, for exports as well and<br />
part of the study that I've asked to be done now is to see what<br />
the potential in the export area is as well.<br />
JOURNALIST: As a proportion of the paper that the federal<br />
bureacracy generates, how much would that represent?<br />
PM: I'm saying that I'm given to understand that something of<br />
the order of 10 to 15,000 tonnes is the paper that's consumed<br />
at the Federal Government level.<br />
JOURNALIST: the federal paper workers going to be<br />
PM: I thought that was the sort of figure of total use of<br />
paper. That was the figure that was put before me. But I<br />
think obviously in the nature of things this is something that<br />
would have to be looked at reasonably quickly. So I don't want<br />
to be held with precision on that figure. Those were the<br />
figures that were put before me.<br />
JOURNALIST: Is this commitment independent of the<br />
Commonwealth's commitment to write clear environmental<br />
guidelines for future pulp mills?<br />
PM: What we've said in regard to the drawing up of future<br />
environmental guidelines is that I've asked my Ministers to be<br />
looking at the question of whether there can be general<br />
guidelines acknowledging that by definition certain<br />
geographical circumstances by definition would'nt be replicated<br />
in another place. So it may be impossible to have absolutely<br />
general generally applicable guidlelines but we are looking<br />
at that issue. Let me make it quite clear that where you've<br />
got to see the great merit, great virtue of what Michael Field<br />
has done is to say, well there is uncertainty in the area of<br />
the kraft processes of the bleached product and he wants to add<br />
another very substantial bow, a string to Tasmania's bow, and<br />
S he's done that. Because if in fact we can establish as a<br />
result of the expert inquiry that we'll initiate and his<br />
Government would then follow up, that there is a substantial<br />
market for the unbleached product. We're jumping in in a way<br />
which is acceptable for everyone. But it doesn't mean that it<br />
doesn't make sense to look at the other area with a view in<br />
those areas that we can with existing product to get processes<br />
which generally would be acceptable as environmentally<br />
acceptable. PM: Prime Minister would you agree that there isn't a<br />
commercial market without public education and promotion? </p>
<p>PM: I think public education and promotion will be part of it<br />
but as I said, one of the things we're going to be asking this<br />
mission to do is when they are overseas to have a look at<br />
what's developing internationally. I mean I'm sure on what<br />
I've seen put before me, I've mentioned this move in the area<br />
of disposable nappies and tampons, that there seems to be a<br />
growing concern there so we would want to look at that and as I<br />
said I just briefly looked at any article which indicated that<br />
the computer industry was starting to concern itself with<br />
developing a campaign for the use of environmentally friendly<br />
paper as far as computers are concerned. So it seems to me<br />
without pretending to have an expert knowledge at this stage,<br />
it does seem to me that there are tendencies developing in the<br />
world which to me would imply the existence of a market and<br />
when you add to that the preparedness that we'd have<br />
governments to use such paper products, I would tend to feel<br />
that the market will be there.<br />
JOURNALIST: inaudible<br />
FIELD: The situation is that the world's moving very quickly,<br />
particularly Sweden. It's passed legislation concerning<br />
and ommissions and that obviously there's going to be a growing<br />
market for unbleached Paper and if markets can be shown to be<br />
there, producers will produce. So this study in fact is<br />
establishing the viability of such a process and if it does<br />
there'd be interest in it. There's no doubt about that. what<br />
they are concerned about is markets and if markets can be<br />
provided then there'll be people who'll be very interested in<br />
producing a world first here in Tasmania.<br />
JOURNALIST: And would paper for the Federal and Tasmanian<br />
bureaucracies be enough to sell it to<br />
FIELD: No they would have to be exported as well. This is a<br />
very large mills that produced unbleached paper would have to<br />
export. But there's a growing export market and demand for it<br />
because of the problem with organochlorines around the world in<br />
terms of effluent. Some countries have already moved to it<br />
Sweden is the most advanced and therefore it's moved very<br />
quickly in the last 18 months and if markets can be Provided<br />
then the product will be provided, assuming that it's<br />
technically feasible and that's what this study is all about. </p>
<p>-6-<br />
PM: Let me just say that there's one thing that's certain<br />
about what's happening in the world today. I'd suggest that it<br />
is that the world is becoming more environmentally conscious<br />
and in those terms I would be confident of the existence into<br />
the future of markets adequate to pick up the output, the<br />
proposed output of Wesley Vale was of the order of 400,000<br />
tonnes so to go precisely to a question given the answer I did<br />
to say 10-15,000 tonnes of Commonwealth Government usage, you<br />
can get some idea then that the relationship and the inadequacy<br />
of that of itself to provide a market. But given when I say<br />
the fact that the world is becoming every day more<br />
environmentally conscious. I'd be confident of a future market.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke will your commitment hold for whoever<br />
wins government after this election?<br />
PM: Well I think that's hypothetical and I expect Mr Field to<br />
form the next Government after next Saturday. But the point is<br />
&amp; O that it's Michael Field, Michael Field alone, whose initiative<br />
it was that I've been talking with and it's a contrast between<br />
Michael Field and his imagination and the negativism and<br />
consultationism which is characterised over the whole period<br />
that we've been here, the attitude of the existing Premier.<br />
I'm expecting that Michael Field will be the next Premier.<br />
T </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Prime Minister if Michael Field can't form a<br />
majority Government form a minority Government?<br />
PM: Well, I'm not here to say what he should do, I'm here<br />
to agree with what I understand, I mean if I didn't I'd say I<br />
didn't but I do agree with what he said and that is that<br />
he expects to have a majority, if he doesn't then there<br />
won't be any coalition, no deal, he would form a Government<br />
and expect in those circumstances to have support, but that's<br />
not a coalition or a deal. But he deserves to be given a<br />
mandate by the people of Tasmania to form a Government. He<br />
has shown in a very short time that he's got the qualities,<br />
the determination and the imagination to look after the<br />
interests of the people of Tasmania.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, you expressed a view at the outset of<br />
the campaign that you expected a minority Government<br />
in Tasmania<br />
PM: No, no, no I said that that was a possibility. If you<br />
look back through my transcript I said I expected Labor to<br />
win. I said, as a person who studies politics, that's a<br />
possibility that you could have a situation where they didn't<br />
have a majority, but in those circumstances I would still<br />
hope and expect that he would form a Government.<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you think that independents holding balance<br />
of power in a minority Government is bad for the<br />
Government? PM: Well, it may be made but it's not as bad as having no<br />
Government. If we were talking totally hypothetically to<br />
have a situation where neither of the major parties in fact<br />
have a majority in their own right, then there's got to be a<br />
government and I would have thought that in those<br />
circumstances it is Michael Field and the Labor Party who<br />
should and would govern because they've got a clear program<br />
and one which it seems to me should be the most acceptable to<br />
those in the Parliament, but Michael Field is right to say<br />
there's no coalition, no deal.<br />
JOURNALIST: One of the reasons Mr Gray gave for calling this<br />
election was the poor financial deal he was getting from the<br />
Commonwealth. How do you react to that? </p>
<p>PM: Well, I react as I normally do to just about anything<br />
that Mr Gray says. The unfortunate thing about Mr Gray is<br />
that he has a constitutional capacity to match what comes out<br />
of his mouth with what are the facts. Which is a very polite<br />
way of saying something else. Now, not too complex I hope.<br />
The facts are, and that he's been good enough to acknowledge<br />
at the end of Premiers' Conferences, that I and the<br />
Commonwealth Government have declined to impose upon Tasmania<br />
that aggregate outcome which the proposed relativity that is<br />
suggested by independent authorities would impact upon<br />
Tasmania. I have on each occasion been prepared to go beyond<br />
that, to do more, because I recognise the peculiar<br />
circumstances of Tasmania. Now I don't have to rely on<br />
simply being here in an election campaign and naturally<br />
saying something by way of rhetoric that would be helpful.<br />
The facts are quite clear and again there is public<br />
indications by my conservative opponents of the fact that<br />
Hawke's stuck rigorously to the commitment he made from 1983<br />
onwards. From the time of the Franklin Dam I've more than<br />
kept the promise I made then and I have, for instance, on the<br />
question of the Tasmanian Freight Equalisation subsidy, I've<br />
been subject to very considerable pressures from the<br />
bureaucracy and from economic rationalists within the<br />
Government to say the Tasmanian Freight Equalisation subsidy<br />
should go. Now, it's because I have a commitment to Tasmania<br />
and because it's the Labor Party in Tasmania that has really<br />
kept a constructive pressure on us on these issues, which<br />
kept it there. And if you look at what we put into<br />
Launceston for the training of Air Traffic Officers, again<br />
there the bureaucracy was saying to me and some of the<br />
economic rationalists were saying, shouldn't come to<br />
Tasmania, that it made more rational, national economic sense<br />
to put it on the mainland. Now I took the view that Tasmania<br />
does need particular consideration. In my thinking about it<br />
I've always been pressed on that point by the Labor Party,<br />
the Labor leadership here in Tasmania. So Mr Gray hasn't got<br />
it right and on his own facts hasn't got it right. He knows<br />
and has been prepared to say so privately that we have taken<br />
into account the special circumstances of Tasmania. But I<br />
must say that in coming ultimately to the conclusions in the<br />
whole range of areas that I've made in regard to Tasmania and<br />
making decisions which are particularly helpful to Tasmania,<br />
that in getting to that position I've been most helped and<br />
consistently most helped by the constructive pressure that's<br />
been put upon me by the Labor Party from Tasmania.<br />
JOURNALIST: Have Tasmanians suffered though as a result of<br />
this posionous nature of the relationship between you and Mr<br />
Gray? </p>
<p>PM: Well, when you have a situation that emerged that<br />
because I couldn't have a one-on-one conversation with Mr<br />
Gray, you'd have a one-on-one conversation he'd go out and<br />
misrepresent what was said, and I've never been able<br />
therefore, never been prepared to have discussions other than<br />
with other people present, and that's the only Premier, the<br />
only State Premier with whom that's happened. I mean, take<br />
the departed but not so much lamented Joe Bjelke-Petersen,<br />
I've had my rough times with him in private conversations,<br />
but Petersen never went out of a private conversation and<br />
misrepresented what happened.<br />
JOURNALIST: But as a result of this has Tasmania suffered<br />
PM: Well, I must say that obviously if you've got a<br />
situation where you can't have that direct basis of<br />
consultation then it must, the interests of Tasmanians must<br />
suffer because they've got to ask themselves why is it that<br />
only their Premier is at that situation with the Prime<br />
Minister. Now, fortunately for Tasmanians, in the end they<br />
haven't suffered but not because of that, but because the<br />
incompetence and incapacity to conduct relations between us<br />
that has characterised this period, has been more than<br />
compensated by the readiness of the Parliamentary Labor Party<br />
here to fill that gap and now you've got the classic example<br />
of Michael Field who's come in and instead of having<br />
stand-offs that have existed before, he's come in and said<br />
here's a positive proposal and we've responded to it.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, how effective do you think a Premier<br />
could be to represent us today if we have a hung<br />
Parliament on May 13 and as a result what would that be on<br />
the Premier's Conference?<br />
PM: Oh well, when Michael Field is there, as I believe he<br />
will be, I think he'll be an effective representative. I<br />
mean I can't be dogmatic about outcomes but it's my belief<br />
that Michael Field will be there, he certainly deserves to<br />
be. JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, a business group has begun a<br />
campaign in Tasmania against the independents on the basis<br />
that they would bring unstable government. Knowing Bob Brown<br />
and perhaps Christine Milne as you do, I wonder whether you<br />
might give an assessment of what you think of them as<br />
performers in that role in supporting a minority government<br />
perhaps? </p>
<p>PM: Well to say I don't know Christine Milne, I may have<br />
met her sometime in the past I don't want to be rude to<br />
her, I'm not aware of having met her, perhaps I have but I<br />
certainly haven't met her recently, so I can't make any<br />
comment on the basis of knowledge about her. I've had<br />
dealings with Bob Brown, he's a forceful advocat of his<br />
particular views. I have to say, and I mean I'm not<br />
disclosing any State secrets, I don't think Bob Brown would<br />
mind me saying so, that I've had reason to think in some of<br />
my dealings with him that in the pursuit of the things and<br />
issues which he deeply believes in, and I respect him for his<br />
beliefs, I'm not questioning that, I think at times that he<br />
hasn't had a full perspective of economic considerations. I<br />
mean the great issue facing not merely Tasmania and<br />
Australia, but the world, is of getting a proper balance<br />
between development and discharging the undoubted obligation<br />
that we have to future generations to protect the environment<br />
and our heritage. Now, my observation about Bob Brown would<br />
be that in his single minded commitment to matters<br />
environmental I don't think he has at all times got the<br />
degree of reasonable balance that I think is needed. But I'm<br />
not saying that to try and knock the man, its an honest<br />
observation and when he's been dealing with me he's put his<br />
point of view directly and you're never in any doubt of<br />
what his position is. I would question at times the<br />
appropriateness of the balance. But in the end, in the end,<br />
the issue is this. There are only two groups in this<br />
election that can form a Government and that is the bloke<br />
that's been there and produced a situation where you'vye got<br />
the worst economic performance in Tasmania of any State in<br />
Australia, a failed economic manager, and one who has failed,<br />
general speaking in terms of his capacity to conduct rational<br />
relations with the Federal Government, an issue which is<br />
of central importance to the welfare of the people of<br />
Tasmania. So that's on the one hand, you've got that, and on<br />
the other you'ye got a fresh new dynamic young leader of the<br />
Labor Party whose leading a Party which has got policies<br />
which are relevant and a capacity for co-operation and<br />
consultation with the Federal Government which is unmatched.<br />
In end, that's the issue.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, with due respect to Mr Field's<br />
initiative, isn't it true that we wouldn't be at this point<br />
without that public opinion campaign fuelled by Dr Brown and<br />
Ms Milne? We wouldn't be at the point of talking about<br />
unbleached paper and unbleached pulp mills? </p>
<p>11.<br />
PM: Well Michael, no doubt will have something to say about<br />
that but let me say no I don't accept that Ms Milne and Dr<br />
Brown have any monopoly of concern about the environment at<br />
all. I mean, just lets look at the record, the Australian<br />
record. OK as far as this Government was concerned it<br />
started with the Franklin and I pay clear and unqualified<br />
tribute to Bob Brown and others down here who were involved<br />
in that, and its no secret that the Labor Party had its<br />
divisions and problems about that, that's a fact of history,<br />
Brown is entitled to a significant credit for what developed<br />
there, no question. But I've been in Government, I've been<br />
Prime Minister of this country now for more than 6 years and<br />
I personally have a deep commitment to the environment, no<br />
one questions that. I have Ministers, successive Ministers<br />
who've had that environment, I have in Senator Richardson a<br />
man who doesn't look to anyone, whether its Brown or anyone<br />
else as a guru, he has his own instinctive commitment to and<br />
passion for matters environmental and you look at the record,<br />
everything that was done, we are not a Government or a Party<br />
which needs inspiration or direction or motivation from<br />
anyone else. I pay tribute to all those have their deep<br />
commitment JOURNALIST: I was referring on a State level.<br />
PM: Yes, but on a State level, I can say before Michael goes<br />
to it, let me make this point. When I was down here earlier<br />
and the issue of Wesley Vale was on I didn't for instance see<br />
Mr Brown or Ms Milne, but I had a whole lot of other people,<br />
a range of people including for instance people from the<br />
Farmers Federation, a whole lot of community organisations<br />
and Labor Party people, who were pressing this issue to me.<br />
I didn't have any personal representation from either of the<br />
people you're talking about.<br />
FIELD: Right, the Labor Party here has had divisions in the<br />
past on the environment, but it was the Labor Party that<br />
split because it wanted to save the Franklin Dam and gave the<br />
opportunity of those groups to create a political climate<br />
where in the end a Labor Federal Government saved the<br />
Franklin, when a Gray Government'here was hell bent right<br />
from the start of damming the Franklin. If you take the<br />
Wesley Vale matter, we had a straightforward policy right<br />
from beginning to end and that was support subject to proper<br />
environmental control and we opposed the revised guidelines<br />
because they didn't give that control. Now, it was the<br />
Federal Government again that on advice to it could not<br />
approve, given their reservations, about the fiasco that was<br />
created here in Tasmania by the Gray Government. Now, to<br />
explain causality in terms of a pressure group outside the<br />
Government and give them all credit is a simplification of<br />
history in my judgement because the facts speak a far more<br />
complex story. Suffice to say that given our position now, </p>
<p>12.<br />
( FIELD cont) this initiative will make sure that developments<br />
in Tasmania will be clean and environmentally safe and that's<br />
the assurance that this agreement gives to Tasmanians and<br />
Tasmanians can be assured that, with cooperation with the<br />
Federal Government, that it will be there for a long time.<br />
We can get far better outcomes with far less division than<br />
has been a feature of Tasmanian politics for the last ten<br />
years and I think that's the message that people need to get<br />
from today's conference.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, it's early today yet but would you<br />
like to waive Ian McPhee goodbye?<br />
PM: I wouldn't like to waive him goodbye but, and I don't<br />
know whether I could get through the crowd of the reactionary<br />
new right troglodytes in Victoria who are intent not on<br />
waiving him goodbye, which is a reasonably felicitous way of<br />
saying farewell to someone, but kicking him substantially in<br />
the backside. Now they are so many and numerous clamouring<br />
to do that that I don't know that I could be seen. But as I<br />
say, I leave the internal affairs of the Liberal Party to the<br />
Liberal Party. Each passing day they demonstrate their<br />
incapacity and unfitness for office.<br />
ends </p>
