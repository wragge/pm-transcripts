THLI<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR PRESS JULY 9, 1976<br />
The Prime Minister received the following telegram today:<br />
" Strongly urge you and your Minister for Health to resume<br />
negotiations with Trade Unions on Medibank. I feel sure<br />
the efforts of the unions are directed to preserving the<br />
legitimate interests of their members. A breakdown of<br />
negotiations now could produce serious repercussions at<br />
a later date. Regards K. S. Wriedt."<br />
The Prime Minister sent the following reply early this<br />
afternoon. " The Government has always been prepared to talk. It has<br />
accepted very significant modifications greatly improving<br />
lMedibank by enabling it to offer full1 cover through Medihank<br />
insurance. It is the A. C. T. U. that called this strike. The A. C. T. U. has<br />
made no approach to Mr Hunt or myself in recent days. I<br />
have been advised that Mr Hawke has not the capacity to prevent<br />
the strike. I am arranging for a copy of the Minister's press<br />
release of 2 July and an extract from my speech at the Press<br />
Club at Canberra on 7 July, which outline the Governments<br />
position, to be forwarded to you under separate cover.<br />
I am releasing this reply and the text of your telegram.<br />
Yours sincerely, ( Malcolm Fraser)" </p>
