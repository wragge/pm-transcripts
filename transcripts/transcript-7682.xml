WPRIME M4INISTER<br />
CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
WA ALP STATE CONFERENCE<br />
PERTH 15 JULY 1989<br />
Delegates,<br />
At the outset I want to take this opportunity to offer<br />
publicly my congratulations to Peter Dowding, and to his<br />
team, and to you, for your magnificent win in the State<br />
elections of 4 February.<br />
It was an inspiring, fighting win that demonstrated again<br />
one of the fundamental facts of Australian political life of<br />
the 1980s.<br />
That fact is the fact of Labor's ascendancy: Labor's<br />
capacity, Federally and at the State level, to carry out the<br />
responsibilities, and meet the great challenges, of<br />
government. As well as your tremendous victory here in Perth, John Cain<br />
was re-elected in Victoria, Michael Field has restored<br />
Tasmania once more to Labor rule, and within a year our<br />
Federal President, John Bannon, will, I am sure, win a<br />
renewed mandate from the people of South Australia.<br />
Throughout Australia Labor is in Government.<br />
Throughout Australia, while our opponents indulge in the<br />
sterile debates and divisions of opposition, Labor is being<br />
put to the acid test of government making the decisions<br />
and setting the priorities that directly affect the well<br />
being of the Australian people.<br />
And throughout Australia, whenever the people are asked for<br />
their verdict on our performance, they are returning Labor<br />
to office to carry on with our historic mission of ref ormn<br />
our crucial mission of governing for all the people.<br />
Could anyone imagine a contrast more stark than that which<br />
characterises the Australian political scene today? </p>
<p>Five Labor Governments, Federal and State, determinedly<br />
and confidently getting on with the hard work of<br />
Government;<br />
And five Liberal Oppositions, disunified, directionless,<br />
repudiated repeatedly by the electorate, and seemingly<br />
more capable of public boasting about leadership coups<br />
than of formulating credible alternative policies.<br />
A fascinating statistic is that during their years in the<br />
wilderness, four Liberal Oppositions in Canberra, Perth,<br />
Adelaide and Victoria have gone through no less than ten<br />
Opposition Leaders.<br />
That's of course counting the recycled Peacock twice.<br />
But, delegates, there are two non-Labor Governments in<br />
Australia. Their records are worth looking at more closely.<br />
Queensland we know all about a shameful proof that where<br />
Governments operate without fear of electoral<br />
accountability, mismanagement and corruption will inevitably<br />
follow. Later this year Wayne Goss will offer Queensland the chance<br />
to enter a new era with an honest, credible, and clean Labor<br />
Government. So that leaves New South Wales.<br />
Now delegates, I didn't come all the way to Perth just to<br />
give Nick Greiner a serve.<br />
I can do that pretty effectively back in the eastern states.<br />
But I did come here to give Liberalism a serve.<br />
And the Greiner Government is our only tangible example, the<br />
sole embodiment, of what Liberalism in action is all about.<br />
New South Wales is the one state where our political<br />
opponents are actually in office the one place in<br />
Australia where stark Liberal actions, not pious Liberal<br />
slogans, have revealed the true preferences and priorities<br />
of Liberalism today.<br />
Before Nick Greiner was elected, I warned that he and his<br />
colleagues represented the dark side of politics.<br />
I didn't want to see that statement proven.<br />
But I could not have been closer to the truth. </p>
<p>Because Liberalism as implemented by Nick Greiner has meant<br />
a direct assault on the budgets of ordinary families.<br />
Bob Carr has estimated that New South Wales families are<br />
paying up to $ 1000 a year more as a result of increases in<br />
State taxes and charges. Some are paying more.<br />
Electricity charges, water rates, hospital bed charges,<br />
public transport fees they have all been dramatically<br />
raised by the Greiner Liberal Government.<br />
All this from a government that promised do you remember<br />
thiszGreiner promise? not to. increase charges faster than<br />
the rate of inflation in any one year.<br />
In fact, most of the increases are two or three times the<br />
CPI.<br />
When he was on the campaign trail, Greiner was a profligate<br />
maker of campaign promises.<br />
Now as Premier he is a unrestrained breaker of those<br />
promises. I recognise that circumstances sometimes change, and that<br />
Governments sometimes have to modify their actions in the<br />
interests of good government.<br />
But Greiner has broken nearly 150 promises in just sixteen<br />
months. That is not good government. That is cynical government.<br />
That is deceptive government. But above all, that is unfair<br />
government. That is Liberal Government in Australia today.<br />
It's not surprising to see a report this week that Greiner<br />
is offering advice to Peacock on political strategy. His<br />
advice is: " Andrew, keep it vague!"<br />
But we all know enough about Liberals to see through a<br />
deliberate Peacock strategy of vagueness.<br />
We know precisely what the record of Liberalism is.<br />
The Greiner record reveals Liberalism as the politics of<br />
broken promises and spiralling taxes and charges hurting<br />
all families and especially those on fixed incomes.<br />
The Queensland record reveals Liberalism as not only<br />
incapable of stopping the rot of corruption overseen by the<br />
National Party but willing partners, deeply implicated in<br />
all that has gone wrong in that State. </p>
<p>The Tasmanian record reveals Liberalism as a patent threat<br />
to the nation's environmental heritage, completely incapable<br />
of managing with responsibility the legacy of our<br />
environment that we want to pass on to the next generation<br />
of Australians.<br />
And at the Federal level, the tragic record of Liberalism's<br />
last days in 1982/ 83 was the unique economic disaster of<br />
double digit inflation and unemployment.<br />
Let's not forget that Andrew Peacock was a part of that<br />
Government.. His actions then and the actions of his Government then<br />
speak far more loudly than his vague words today about<br />
creating a more compassionate society.<br />
Of course Andrew Peacock has still not managed to finalise.<br />
or release any of his most important policy prescriptions.<br />
But he has said enough about his plans and intentions to<br />
allow us to comprehend the kind of disaster Liberalism wants<br />
once more to wreak upon this land.<br />
Remember that the Liberals turned to Peacock, in<br />
dasperation, looking for a leader who could effectively<br />
communicate the Liberal message. There has been no real<br />
change in the substance of that message on the central<br />
policy issues facing Australia.<br />
Liberalism today with Andrew Peacock at the helm is the same<br />
philosophy of social inequality that it has always been<br />
the same doctrine of division and despair.<br />
Peacock offers the same Tory recipe that Howard offered in<br />
' Future Directions' and that Fraser implemented between<br />
1976-83: social strife and confrontation; a return to the<br />
industrial jungle; a trampling of the security of the less<br />
well of f; the very antithesis of fairness.<br />
First and foremost, Liberalism under Peacock stands<br />
fundamentally opposed to the great achievements of the Labor<br />
movement represented by the Accord.<br />
Delegates, never forget this. More deeply than anything<br />
else, the Liberals resent the fact that this Government has<br />
built a stable, constructive relationship with the trade<br />
union movement through the Accord.<br />
The Accord has been critical to the economic reforms of this<br />
Government. The Accord processes of consensus and<br />
cooperation have yielded benefits for. the whole nation. </p>
<p>It has been central to the creation of nearly 1.5 million<br />
jobs and to pushing unemployment down to 6 per cent its<br />
lowest point for seven and a-half years; to the achievement<br />
of massive increases in the social wage; and to the<br />
undertaking of the historic processes of award<br />
restructuring. In the April Statement, the Federal Government increased the<br />
real disposable income of Australians with tax cuts costing<br />
$ 4.9 billion, a $ 700 million package of new family<br />
assistance measures, and a 6.5 per cent increase in wages.<br />
It AiF a package that could only have been delivered by a<br />
Labor Government by this Labor Government working<br />
through the processes of the Accord.<br />
No wonder the Liberals abhor the Accord. The Accord<br />
represents an achievement that is utterly beyond their grasp<br />
an achievement that defies their blinkered reliance on the<br />
tactics of confrontation and division.<br />
So when Andrew Peacock says as he does on every possible<br />
occasion that he wants to decentralise the systems of wage<br />
fixing and industrial relations, he is speaking from the<br />
deepest wells of Liberal resentment of our political and<br />
economic successes.<br />
What would result from decentralisation is simply this:<br />
instead of the 6.5 per cent wage increase of the April<br />
Statement, a wages breakout that would smash the<br />
Australian economy, and bring with it mass unemployment;<br />
instead of the 59 per cent reduction in industrial<br />
disputes that has occurred under the Accord, a return to<br />
confrontation in the workplace;<br />
and instead of the essential and historic micro-economic<br />
reforms of award restructuring, a stab in the back for<br />
Australian productivity.<br />
Peacock Liberalism parades itself under the slogan of " A<br />
Fair Go For All".<br />
No one who knows anything about Australian politics can ever<br />
accept that Liberalism and fairness have anything to do with<br />
each other. They never have in the past'. They didn't under<br />
John Howard. ind certainly, under Peacock, they never will.<br />
Compare the records of Labor and Liberal in the key area of<br />
tax reform and see who has proven commitment to fairness. </p>
<p>When this Government came to office in 1983, we inherited<br />
from the Liberals tax scales--set at 60, 46 and 30 cents in<br />
the dollar. Now, under Labor the top rate has already come<br />
down to 49 cents in the dollar and will fall further; the<br />
bottom rate is only 21 cents in the dollar.<br />
Against those Labor tax cuts detailed, delivered, already<br />
paid for, fair the Liberals have yet to produce even a<br />
single detail, not one figure, about their tax policy.<br />
Here we are more than two years into the life of this our<br />
thiri? term of Government and the Liberals' tax policy<br />
consists of nothing more than uncosted, unspecified,<br />
unreliable pie in the sky.<br />
But there is one unambiguous tax commitment by Peacock.<br />
Typically, it is the promise to overthrow Labor's Capital<br />
Gains Tax and the Fringe Benefits Tax.<br />
How credible is Liberalism's sham conversion to the cause of<br />
fairness when the Liberal leader wants to do away with these<br />
fundamentally fair tax reforms and go back to the days of<br />
the rorts the expense account lunches and executive salary<br />
packages, the subsidised school fees and overseas holidays<br />
where the ordinary taxpayer foots the bill.<br />
Another Peacock promise another piece of textbook<br />
conservatism is to cut the size of Government.<br />
Peacock is talking about " substantial" and " bold" spending<br />
cuts totalling more than $ 1 billion.<br />
As you know this Government has already turned around the<br />
prospective $ 9.6 billion deficit that the Liberals<br />
bequeathed to us and created two consecutive budget<br />
surpluses. I've sat in the Cabinet room for hundreds of hours and so<br />
have Paul Keating and Peter Walsh and Kim Beazley and John<br />
Dawkins and others. The fact is you can't cut another $ 1<br />
billion without cutting deep into the essential elements of<br />
Australia's system of social security, or into road funding,<br />
or into school funding.<br />
If Andrew Peacock wants to do that, so be it. But he should<br />
at least have the gumption and the leadership to tell the<br />
Australian people that's what he intends.<br />
Instead, all we see is the incredible sight of Liberal<br />
shadow ministers running around the Press Gallery briefing<br />
journalists that the cuts might come from somewhere but they<br />
certainly won't come from their own portfolio area. </p>
<p>Under Peacock, the search for spending cuts has degenerated<br />
into a Shadow Cabinet brawl. Quite frankly, John Howard,<br />
wouldn't have allowed it.<br />
Anyone with any experience of Liberalism in government could<br />
have a pretty fair guess about where the Liberals will look<br />
for savings.<br />
As usual, it will come from the welfare area. It will be<br />
taken out of the pockets of the least well of f.<br />
And what's fair about that?<br />
One of my Government's proudest achievements is to have<br />
brought two million Australians under the health insurance<br />
umbrella of Medicare.<br />
But let me quote from a recent Peacock radio interview:<br />
" In terms of cutting Government expenditure we've got to<br />
look at restraining the costs of Medicare. Medicare<br />
will remain for the aged but we want to encourage people<br />
through the tax system to move over to private<br />
insurance."<br />
So the Liberals have learned nothing from the disastrous<br />
days of the Fraser Government. Remember? SiX different<br />
health care schemes in seven years. And since then five<br />
Opposition health spokesmen and six failed health policies<br />
to date.<br />
Because of their ideological obsession against Government<br />
programs that directly help the less well of f, the Liberals<br />
want to hand Medicare's members over the private health<br />
funds and the A. M. A.<br />
If Medicare was dismantled, the average Australian family<br />
would be paying about $ 20 a week more for health insurance.<br />
0 And, incredibly, the Liberals are also considering<br />
terminating Labor's Family Assistance package.<br />
Under Labor, hard working families on low incomes get<br />
unprecedented cash assistance to help make ends meet.<br />
From 1 July we have lifted F. A. S. payments again. For each<br />
child aged between 13 and 15, payments are up by more than<br />
$ 3 a week, to $ 34.10. Payments fbr all children are now<br />
indexed to CPI movements so they retain their real value for<br />
all time.<br />
The effect of these increases, combined with the April<br />
Statement tax cuts, is dramatic. </p>
<p>A single income family with two children on $ 20,000<br />
effectively pays no tax. Their tax payments are totally<br />
offset by their family assistance payments.<br />
You recall I pledged in the last election campaign to<br />
eliminate the financial need for Australian children to live<br />
in poverty.<br />
The Brotherhood of St Laurence, which is one of our<br />
country's most respected social welfare organisations, had<br />
this to say about the Government's action to meet that<br />
pledge. " This pledge, the most specific social commitment of the<br />
century, has been the subject of an historic package to<br />
provide a guaranteed minimum income for poor children<br />
whose parents earn less than about $ 300 per week.<br />
" We congratulate the Federal Government on its work on<br />
child poverty, which represents an historic breakthrough<br />
in the national attack on child poverty. The Federal<br />
Government has now built a solid foundation of income<br />
security for Australian families."<br />
But the Liberals are not happy with that outcome.<br />
They want to meddle by abolishing cash assistance and<br />
offering tax rebates instead. Again, no-one on the Liberal<br />
side has been prepared to stand up and say who would miss<br />
out and how much assistance would be withdrawn.<br />
But I can tell you that because any Liberal tax rebate would<br />
be paid to the breadwinner usually the father the change<br />
would be a deliberate slap in the face for the women, the<br />
mothers at home, who receive Labor's cash assistance.<br />
So when you take it together when you add up the Liberals'<br />
wages breakout, the regressive abolition of capital gains<br />
and fringe benefits taxes, the spending cuts, the carving up<br />
of Medicare when you imagine what would happen to family<br />
assistance you have a picture of an Australia under<br />
Peacock Liberalism that would be the absolute contradiction<br />
of fairness, a complete perversion of a fair go.<br />
Delegates, For six and a half years we have been working to make<br />
Australia a more productive, competitive economy.<br />
At the same time we have carried out social reforms to<br />
improve substantially the position of families, the elderly<br />
and welfare recipients. </p>
<p>Despite the 1985-6 collapse in our terms of trade we have<br />
managed to keep pursuing those central goals of economic<br />
management. The benefits of our policies hL-ave Abeen<br />
economic growth<br />
jobs<br />
record spending on targetted welfare and social programs<br />
Medicare tight controls on Government spending<br />
a fair taxation system where business and the rich pay<br />
their fair share and where ordinary taxpayers have<br />
received major tax relief.<br />
At present we have a special problem because economic<br />
activity has been so strong it has spilled over into a<br />
demand for too many imports.<br />
To reduce that demand it has been necessary to have tight<br />
monetary policy high interest rates.<br />
The alternative to the Government keeping interest rates<br />
high would be to let international money markets make those<br />
decisions for us by dramatically forcing down the value of<br />
the dollar. Interest rates and prices would then skyrocket.<br />
Until demand comes down and it will we need high<br />
interest rates for the good of the Australian economy.<br />
But they do not have to and will not stay higher a day<br />
longer than is necessary to get that result.<br />
A government with our record of, and commitment to, economic<br />
and social achievements is not going to allow all of the<br />
positive developments of the past six and a half years to be<br />
squandered. That is why we must have the policies that we<br />
now have.<br />
Any snake-oil salesman who pretends that interest rates can<br />
be lowered without causing pain is trying to take you for a<br />
ride. That's just what Peacock is trying to do. </p>
<p>Because for all the Liberals' posturing about interest<br />
rates, their policy prescription for this period of economic<br />
buoyancy and especially their encouragement of a wages<br />
breakout would put interest rates through the roof, slam<br />
the economy into recession and lengthen the dole queues once<br />
more. You would see not a " hard landing" but a " crash landing"<br />
that would be reminiscent of the last Liberal recession of<br />
1982/ 83 and quite possibly worse.<br />
And this is the policy prescription of a man who proclaims<br />
his conversion to fairness!<br />
Delegates, It's become something of a media game to speculate on the<br />
odds of the Federal Government being re-elected at the next<br />
poll. I'm not going to play that game.<br />
I'm just going to assert that we will win.<br />
We will win because we deserve to win.<br />
We will win because we want to continue the vital task of<br />
economic reform we have undertaken and because, for<br />
Australia's sake, we need to continue it.<br />
We will win because the Australian people have too much good<br />
sense to gamble with their future by embracing that recipe<br />
for disaster that is Liberalism.<br />
What is most objectionable about the Liberals' strategy<br />
today is their obvious belief that if they sit pat, and hold<br />
their breath, and not tell the Australian people the truth<br />
about what Liberalism will mean for them and their living<br />
standards, then Government will just fall into their hands<br />
by default.<br />
More than anything else this is reminiscent of those<br />
offensive words of John Howard before the last election when<br />
he said: " The times will suit me".<br />
Well, Government did not fall into John Howard's hands.<br />
And I am determined it will not fall into Andrew Peacock's.<br />
I know that Labor MPs and Senators, that delegates to Labor<br />
conferences such as this, that Labor branch members and<br />
supporters throughout the nation, will work to ensure that<br />
never happens. </p>
<p>11.<br />
Delegates, the dedication of Labor to its goals will not<br />
falter. Our basic message to the Australian community will not<br />
waver-We will stick to our guns, confident in the knowledge that<br />
our policies are working and will continue to work in the<br />
best long-term interests of all Australians.<br />
We won't be in danger of losing office unless and until the<br />
Opposition can credibly make a similar claim.<br />
That will never happen.<br />
Because when you look at the performance of Liberalism<br />
throughout the nation, and when you analyse the vagueness<br />
and the posturings of the recycled Opposition Leader, the<br />
man Laurie Oakes calls " Slippery Sam", you understand why it<br />
will never happen.<br />
So take that message back to your branches and your local<br />
communities.<br />
Tell our people the truth.<br />
Tell them there are no easy solutions; there are only the<br />
right solutions.<br />
And tell them Labor has found those solutions and with<br />
consistency and compassion, we are implementing them to<br />
build a better, and a fairer, Australia. a~ c Jlud( 4 </p>
