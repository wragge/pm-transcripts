<p>New figures released by the Gillard Government today have confirmed that every single school in Western Australia will receive extra funding over the next six years, under our new and fairer funding model.</p>
<p>The figures, based on the needs-based funding model the Gillard Government wants to introduce for every school, set out how much additional money will flow to Western Australian schools under the National Plan for School Improvement by 2019.</p>
<p>Under our offer to the Western Australian Government, schools across the state will benefit by around $2.8 billion, as a result of extra investment and securing better indexation for schools.</p>
<p>This means that over six years, government schools would receive around an extra $1.9 billion, Catholic schools around an extra $360 million and independent schools would benefit by around $480 million.</p>
<p>Schools with the highest needs will benefit the most from the extra money we are offering.</p>
<p>This extra money will help bring every Western Australian school up to its Schooling Resource Standard, ensuring around 760 schools have the money they need to support every student and deliver the best education possible.</p>
<p>These new figures will reassure parents, principals and the community that no school will be worse off under the new model.</p>
<p>Under the fairer funding model, every school will be funded based on the needs of individual students.</p>
<p>This includes a base amount per student, plus extra money for schools and students that need more support  -  including Indigenous students, low SES students, students with disability, students with limited English proficiency, small schools, and regional and remote schools.</p>
<p>The National Plan for School Improvement will also deliver:</p>
<p> * 	More one on one attention and support in the classroom for every child.<br />
 * 	Specialist literacy and numeracy programs for those children in danger of being left behind.<br />
 * 	Greater assistance for those students with disability or special need.<br />
 * 	Building the skills and knowledge of teachers and providing mentoring support for those who are new to the profession.</p>
<p>This is a fair and generous offer which will deliver benefits to Western Australia for generations to come.</p>
<p>Premier Barnett has until 30 June 2013 to sign up to the National Plan for School Improvement, contribute Western Australia's share and secure a better deal for every school in his state.</p>
