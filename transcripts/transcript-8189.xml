PARLIAMENTARY STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINipigR<br />
TR1ANSPORT AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS REFORW , fo' 9N<br />
8 NOVEMBER 1990-<br />
Mr Speaker,<br />
I wish to announce today a series of decisions affecting<br />
telecommunications and aviation decisions which will help<br />
turn these industries into world-class performers.<br />
These decisions are yet another instalment of the<br />
Government's drive for micro-economic reform a process<br />
that is creating a more dynamic and efficient Australian<br />
economy, an economy that can take on and compete with the<br />
world's best.<br />
These decisions are also just one part albeit a critical<br />
part of thiLs Government's agenda of reform. They fit<br />
closely with the progress made at the Special Premiers'<br />
Conference on improving the efficiency of the processes of<br />
Government throughout Australia, such as in the important<br />
area of rail freight. They fit closely, too, with our real<br />
and steady progress in making our waterfront more efficient.<br />
All of this activity has one central goal a vital goal for<br />
every Austra. lian: to equip our economy to deliver to its<br />
citizens the quality of life to which they justifiably<br />
aspire. For too long Australia was content to live with<br />
inefficiencies and low productivity in too many of our<br />
domestic industries. It is this Government's task<br />
vigorously and rapidly to sweep away those old arrangements<br />
and reshape our economy as a genuinely modern and<br />
competitive one.<br />
That is the simple and unarguable logic that has driven this<br />
Government's commitment to, and achievements in, microeconomic<br />
reform. The sometimes arcane jargon of the microeconomic<br />
reform debate must not be allowed to obscure the<br />
urgency and importance of that goal.<br />
Mr Speaker,<br />
As I've indicated this is not the first time this Government<br />
has been able to report to Parliament on micro-economic<br />
reform and it will most certainly not be the last.<br />
However the decisions I will detail today represent perhaps<br />
our most significant achievement to date in this field. We<br />
have in the seven months since the election identified the<br />
issues in telecommunications and domestic aviation reform,<br />
conIul1e. d widely with those most directly affected by the<br />
changes, and formulated imaginative and bold policies. </p>
<p>I a 2.<br />
I mention-in passing, Mr Speaker, that we also managed to<br />
fit into this tight time-frame an historic Special National<br />
Conference of the Australian Labor Party which altered our<br />
Party's platform to accommodate these changes. By any<br />
standard the speed of the Government's action in this area<br />
and our persistence in pursuing change is proof of our<br />
commitment to reform of telecommunications and domestic<br />
aviation.<br />
Above all, Mr Speaker, these reforms are marked by one<br />
special characteristic they are real-world solutions to<br />
real-world problems. In this respect they are the<br />
antithesis of the half-baked ideas floated almost daily by<br />
the Opposition Leader and his frontbench colleagues. our<br />
reforms CAN bie implemented and they WILL be implemented.<br />
It is my important duty today to outline these reforms to<br />
the House in the context of a broader progress report on the<br />
microeconomic agenda.<br />
Tel eco-rmmnication<br />
Mr Speaker,<br />
For most Australian households, the telephone provides an<br />
essential lifeline to society; it is perhaps the most<br />
important instrument of modern life. For Australian<br />
business, it is literally an indispensable tool. It is no<br />
surprise that providing telephones and related equipment to<br />
Australians is a multi-billion dollar industry in fact, it<br />
is one of our largest industries providing 143,000 jobs.<br />
Telecommunications pose a number of unique challenges. The<br />
pace of technological change regularly sees the major<br />
advances of at few years earlier superseded by new<br />
discoveries. This can easily render regulatory structures<br />
out of date; it can also mean new export markets and<br />
employment opportunities can swiftly emerge for an efficient<br />
industry equipped to take them up.<br />
So for Australia, we need to improve the efficiency with<br />
which we deliver telecommunications services within our<br />
country. It is equally clear that we must ready ourselves<br />
to take advantage of new export and job opportunities that<br />
will be created around the world, particularly with rapidly<br />
rising living standards in the Asia-Pacific region. The<br />
nations of the Asia-Pacific region have half the world's<br />
population bu~ t only 17 per cent of its 500 million<br />
telephones. Meeting the region's demand for new<br />
telecommunicat ions services, servicing these vast new<br />
markets, poses an enormous opportunity for Australia.<br />
So it is entirely right that this industry should be as it<br />
has been the subject of intense scrutiny and decisive<br />
action by this Government. Indeed we are taking one of<br />
Australia's biggest industries and reshaping it into a new,<br />
vastly more dynamic structure. </p>
<p>In 1987 and 1.988, amid claims that sound familiar today<br />
about threats to Telecom jobs, we initiated a series of<br />
reforms allowring competition in the provision of customer,<br />
equipment and value added services, and we established three<br />
far-reaching reviews which have resulted in today's major<br />
reforms. These reforms may be divided into four parts:<br />
establishing a new competitor;<br />
developiLng new services;<br />
strengthening the regulator; and<br />
ensuring a strong publicly owned telecommunications<br />
company.<br />
Each of these elements contributes to the same outcome:<br />
benefits for Australia that are potentially limitless. We<br />
will see massive new private investment in the Australian<br />
economy; an expansion not a contraction of total jobs; a<br />
fall in STD prices on major trunk routes by as much as<br />
per cent; and the creation of substantial and enduring<br />
export opportunities.<br />
The underlying conviction of these reforms is that<br />
introducing a new competitor into Australia will stimulate<br />
Telecom into lifting its performance for the customer<br />
whether that customer is business or an ordinary household.<br />
But to ensure early benefits are obtained, it will be<br />
important to manage the first phase of competition<br />
carefully. In this first period with only one competitor to<br />
Telecom, AUSTEL and the Trade Practices Commission will be<br />
able to ensure Telecom is not able unduly to exploit its<br />
entrenched position of great strength. If this duopoly is<br />
to serve its; purpose and if the possibility of collusion is<br />
to be avoidEtd, it must have a finite term. We have decided<br />
that after 30 June 1997 the duopoly will terminate, paving<br />
the way for there to be no limit on network competition.<br />
AUSSAT will form the base for the new competitor and it will<br />
have unrestr7icted rights to provide all telecommunications<br />
services. Legislation to this effect will be introduced to<br />
Parliament t: his evening.<br />
AUSSAT will be sold and the new competitor will be up and<br />
running before the end of 1991. The sale will be carried<br />
out by a Task Force responsible to the Minister for<br />
Transport and Communications, based in his Department, and<br />
reporting both to him and to the Minister for Finance.<br />
All restrictions preventing AUSSAT from providing the full<br />
range of services will be removed by the end of this year.<br />
Telecom's representatives on the AUSSAT Board have been<br />
directed to resign forthwith and the Government will<br />
purchase Telecom's shareholding at its commercial value as<br />
at 24 October 1990. </p>
<p>4.<br />
The new cairrier will interconnect to the existing network at<br />
a price that will allow Telecom/ OTC to recover the<br />
additional cos3ts it incurs in providing facilities and<br />
services to the new carrier, and to underpin community<br />
service obligations.<br />
Regulatory safeguards will be put in place to ensure<br />
effective competition:<br />
We will require Telecom and OTC separately, and after<br />
their merger into a new entity to provide<br />
interconnection on an equal access basis to the second<br />
carrier for both domestic and international services;<br />
We will subject Telecom/ OTC to separate price caps for<br />
local, trunk, and international services;<br />
We will ensure that-Telecom carries and completes calls<br />
without diminution of quality on behalf of the second<br />
carrier, and provides it with all ancillary and<br />
supplementary services such as billing, operator and<br />
directory services, and full access to information<br />
about customers and traffic flows;<br />
and we wrill insist on transparency in the financial<br />
transactions of both the new OTC/ Telecom entity and the<br />
new carrier.<br />
Our intention is to see new services develop both during the<br />
period of duopoly on the basic network and beyond.<br />
During the period of the duopoly, up to 1997, a broad range<br />
of competitors to Telecom and the new entrant will be<br />
encouraged in markets other than the basic network.<br />
First, we will licence a third mobile phone operator. The<br />
area of mobile telephony is booming; further technological<br />
and service improvements can be expected. It is,<br />
effectively, an alternative to local exchanges and, while<br />
expensive at present, it may, with further technological<br />
change, be th." e way of the future in telecommunications.<br />
Additional mobile licences may be made available in 1995.<br />
Second, and in support of the decision on mobile telephones,<br />
the Government has adopted the AUSTEL report on Cordless<br />
Telephone services, allowing unrestricted competition in<br />
this area.<br />
Third, we will remove all restrictions on resale, including<br />
on domestic and international telecommunications capacity.<br />
There will be no diminution of the rights of existing<br />
operators in this area. Furthermore, AUSTEL will review the<br />
terms of resale, including the extent to which resellers can<br />
establish their own switching equipment. These changes will<br />
provide a major boost to value added service operators,<br />
their business clientele and to research and development<br />
efforts.<br />
I I </p>
<p>Fourth, as the first phone monopoly held by Telecom ends on<br />
June 1991, the Department of Transport and<br />
Communications, in conjunction with AUSTEL, will bring<br />
forward a Cabinet Memorandum on the appropriate network<br />
termination point for both licensed carriers prior to any<br />
new carrier arrangements coming into place. Telecom will,<br />
in any event, continue to offer a first telephone.<br />
Mr Speaker, the role of the regulator in conjunction with<br />
the Trade Practices Commission, in promoting early and<br />
effective competition will be pivotal.<br />
In order to strengthen AUSTEL for this role, the Government<br />
has decided that AUSTEL's decisions on issues under its<br />
control will be absolute and final.<br />
AUSTEL will be given the power and the resources to:<br />
arbitrate on all interconnection charges between the<br />
two network carriers;<br />
control numbering;<br />
manage Australia's input to international standards;<br />
prevent the misuse of market power; and<br />
report annually to the Government on safeguards and<br />
their effectiveness, and, importantly, on customer<br />
satisfaction.<br />
AUSTEL will also have a role in ensuring that Australian<br />
industry benefits from these changes without compromising<br />
the overall objective of improved services for consumers.<br />
Mr Speaker,<br />
Throughout our deliberations we have been determined to<br />
maintain a strong public-sector presence in Australian<br />
telecommunications, particularly because of its important<br />
role in discharging community service obligations. We will<br />
not place in the hands of future Treasurers or Ministers for<br />
Finance the responsibility for delivering services in areas<br />
where compet: ition does not eventuate, nor do we expect a new<br />
philanthropic owner for Telecom could be found who would<br />
provide them.<br />
We will not attempt to deceive the people of Australia into<br />
believing that such an option is practical.<br />
We will ensure that the community's expectations are met:<br />
that prices fall in real terms across a range of services;<br />
that untimed calls continue to be offered to households;<br />
and that rural and remote services do not vanish. </p>
<p>Telecom operates, for principally domestic purposes, a wellbalanced<br />
telecommunications network but it does not have a<br />
major export focus. In part, this is due to an artificial<br />
barrier between Telecom and OTC. This barrier will be<br />
removed by my Government, and a new corporate focus provided<br />
by merging the organisations.<br />
That focus will have three basic purposes:<br />
first, under the challenge posed by a new, privatelyowned<br />
and fully-resourced competitor, to pass on to<br />
customers in the form of lower prices and better<br />
service, the huge productivity gains that are inherent<br />
in this industry's technological explosion;<br />
second, to provide the basic opportunity for the new<br />
entrant to compete, encouraged both by the decisions of<br />
a newly-strengthened AUSTEL and the incentive created<br />
by the terms of the merger process itself; and<br />
third, to market its combined strengths overseas<br />
aggressively and to pursue with much greater vigour<br />
than previously its undoubted abilities in research and<br />
development.<br />
A fee will be, paid to the Government as a result of the<br />
merger of Telecom/ OTC. The level of that fee will be set by<br />
the Government in consultation with the new entity. It will<br />
also pay a fee for its mobile phone licence.<br />
In order to ensure that interconnect and equal access<br />
arrangements between the carriers are not unnecessarily<br />
delayed, AUSTEL will have to certify that these are in place<br />
in all capital cities and will soon be available in<br />
provincial ciLties before the merger is finalised.<br />
Until that tiLme, OTC and Telecom will operate independently<br />
but with the benefit of an interim group board to oversee<br />
their collective operations in the transition to<br />
competition. This month marks the beginning of deregulation, with the<br />
abolition of the Two Airlines Agreement.<br />
By terminating this infamous relic of Coalition inertia, we<br />
have opened the door to dramatic growth in this vital sector<br />
of modern transport.<br />
The latter-day converts to micro-reform who sit opposite<br />
displayed their true colours when they were in Government<br />
with their consistent failure over decades to remove this<br />
Agreement. They were responsible for slowly strangling<br />
domestic aviation and pushing high costs onto the Australian<br />
consumer. </p>
<p>As a result of our decision to terminate the Agreement, we<br />
see new services, lower prices, a new airline hard<br />
evidence of the value of the decision to Australian<br />
consumers. In order to strengthen the hand of current and future<br />
entrants into domestic aviation, and in order to provide an<br />
appropriate environment for the sale of Australian Airlines<br />
and part of ( Qantas, the Government has decided to:<br />
lift the foreign investment limits relating to<br />
investment in Australian domestic airlines by foreign<br />
airlines servicing Australia from 15% to 25% for an<br />
individual holding, and to 40% in aggregate;<br />
maintain a stable policy environment for aviation for<br />
the remainder of this Parliament.<br />
This decision to put further major policy change in this<br />
area on hold is sensible. It would be madness to introduce<br />
a major chan! ge such as deregulation and not give it a chance<br />
to work. It would similarly be stupid to attempt to sell<br />
the airlines while shifting the goal posts for potential<br />
purchasers. Our decision preserves future policy options.<br />
The foreign investment changes offer clear opportunities for<br />
the New Zealand carrier to enter the Australian market. In<br />
addition, we have opened up the freight route across the<br />
Tasman and are now nominating two additional carriers to<br />
serve that market. In the light of these decisions, we will<br />
also discuss with New Zealand the question of closer<br />
aviation relations in the context of next month's review of<br />
the Closer Economic Relations arrangement.<br />
Mr Speaker, the sale of 100 per cent of Australian Airlines<br />
and 49 per cent of part of Qantas will strengthen them and<br />
enable them to provide much-improved services to Australians<br />
and Australian businesses. They will be recapitalised.<br />
They are likely to form strategic partnerships. In all,<br />
they will be more competitive, and this nation will be<br />
better off as a result.<br />
The sale of both airlines will be handled by the Minister<br />
for Finance in close consultation with the Minister for<br />
Transport ard Communications. The Government will take its<br />
own decisions on the issues related to sale, but it<br />
recognises that the airline boards have a right to be heard.<br />
Special arrangements will apply to the part-sale of Qantas.<br />
In order to accord with our bilateral air service agreement,<br />
the foreign investment limit in Qantas will be set at the<br />
generally accepted international benchmark of </p>
<p>In addition, although Qantas will remain as our single<br />
designated international passenger carrier for the<br />
foreseeable future, the Government recognises that with<br />
the success of our reforms of international charter programs<br />
for air freight there is a potential role for a second<br />
designated freight carrier. A process is currently under<br />
way to assess expressions of interest.<br />
Australia, Qantas and our tourism industry will continue to<br />
benefit from our intention to continue to sign new bilateral<br />
Air Service Agreements and to welcome charter programs.<br />
There are gains still to be made, both from traditional<br />
markets and from a more intense focus on regional<br />
opportunities. Land Transport<br />
It is not a well-recognised fact that of all the areas of<br />
micro-economic reform, land transport offers the greatest<br />
potential gains. The Industry Commission has estimated<br />
these to be worth over $ 4 billion a year.<br />
At the recent Special Premiers' Conference, the Premiers,<br />
Chief Ministers and I cut through the remaining<br />
disagreements to set in place fundamental reforms in both<br />
road and rail operations in this country.<br />
As I made clear earlier this year in calling the Special<br />
Premiers' Conference, our rail systems in this country<br />
cannot operate efficiently with their present structure.<br />
Inter-state freight alone loses $ 300 million a year,<br />
excluding efficiency losses from traffic now on the roads<br />
which might more appropriately be handled by rail.<br />
Our commitment to improving competitiveness required us to<br />
redress these imbalances through seeking State agreement to<br />
form a National Rail Freight Corporation: this will involve<br />
new investment, new industrial relations standards and new<br />
rail management. A Heads of Agreement has been signed by<br />
the Commonwealth and the States and Territories, committing<br />
all Governments to work towards a start-up date of<br />
July 1991.<br />
Following the Premiers' Conference, the hard bargaining on<br />
asset values, equity considerations, reform of labour<br />
practices and other issues will commence. The<br />
Commonwealth's role is clear. We are prepared to contribute<br />
significantly to the success of the venture. We expect the<br />
States and the unions to do so as well, including<br />
particularly in respect of manning levels and work<br />
practices. </p>
<p>9.<br />
The new Rail Freight Corporation will not justify the effort<br />
necessary from unions and governments if the heaviest road<br />
transport vehicles do not themselves bear a proper share of<br />
the costs of using roads. Current efforts by some States to<br />
recover costs through registration fees have been frustrated<br />
because transport operators have simply been able to<br />
register thei~ r vehicles interstate. But the damage to the<br />
nation's roads continues.<br />
The Commonwealth, States and Territories have agreed to the<br />
following objectives:<br />
first, introduction of nationally uniform technical and<br />
operating regulations and driver licensing<br />
arrangements; second, the progressive introduction of nationally<br />
consistent road user charges having regard to<br />
principles established by the Interstate Commission,<br />
with a view ultimately to achieving full recovery of<br />
the cost: of road use; and<br />
third, clearer definition of responsibilities between<br />
different levels of Government for funding and managing<br />
elementS Of the road system, aimed at eliminating<br />
duplication.<br />
I intend to take a continuing interest in the implementation<br />
of these changes. I expect that the Premiers will do<br />
likewise. We all recognise that the road transport industry is vital<br />
to our future. It is the lifeblood of many of our<br />
industries. As we introduce the changes I have detailed<br />
today, we will keep the industry informed and respect its<br />
views. In turn, we expect that the industry will<br />
acknowledge -the common sense underlying these reforms.<br />
Thea Wterfroit<br />
Mr Speaker, more has been said about the waterfront than<br />
perhaps any other industry issue in this country. This<br />
Government has not, however, joined the queue of people who<br />
complain but don't act.<br />
The waterfront reform plan which we adopted last year has<br />
already yielded significant results:<br />
new stevedoring arrangements for bulk grain ships,<br />
reducing manning levels by<br />
retirement of 280 gangway watchmen<br />
recruitment and training of 200 new waterside workers<br />
development of an interim award agreement to facilitate<br />
award riestructuring and the negotiation of enterprise<br />
agreements; and </p>
<p>most importantly, enterprise agreements currently being<br />
concluded at two of the largest terminal operations in<br />
Sydney and Melbourne.<br />
These agreements are expected to be forwarded shortly to the<br />
Waterfront Industry Reform Authority for its independent<br />
assessment. National Terminals ( Australia), the company<br />
negotiating these agreements, has publicly stated that it<br />
expects productivity gains of up to<br />
The continuing process of waterfront reform also includes<br />
involvement by the Trade Practices Commission and the Prices<br />
Surveillance Authority to enhance the competitive<br />
environment on the waterfront and ensure that users receive<br />
the benefits of reform.<br />
Improvements in the efficiency of the Australian shipping<br />
fleet continue to be made under our Shipping Reform<br />
Strategy. To date, in excess of 350 seafarers have accepted voluntary<br />
early retirement packages. At the end of June 1990, the<br />
average crew size for the Australian fleet was 25 compared<br />
with 33 six years ago. By June 1992 it is expected that the<br />
average crew will be 21. All this continues to be achieved<br />
with no industrial disputation.<br />
Mr Speaker,<br />
At the outset of my comments today I described this<br />
Statement as a progress report. I emphasise the word<br />
" 1progress"; Australia is now making progress, achieving<br />
fundamental and lasting reform, in industries that for<br />
decades had seen no progress, no reform.<br />
So I repeat my challenge to the Opposition. Let them point<br />
to a period -of Australian history that has seen faster or<br />
more profound micro-economic reform. That challenge remains<br />
unanswered of course because, as I have said in the past,<br />
there is no -earlier period that comes within a bull's roar<br />
of the progress we have made and are continuing to make.<br />
For 31 of the 34 years before we came to Office, Australia<br />
was ruled by the dead hand of conservative inertia in which<br />
notions of reform to achieve productivity and efficiency<br />
were totally alien. That legacy of neglect and of abrogated<br />
leadership is a heavy burden still borne by the Coalition<br />
parties. Let me conclude by discussing the method of progress: its<br />
pace and process. </p>
<p>11.<br />
The House should note that the progress we have made has<br />
been with little industrial disputation and with the<br />
emphasis on patient negotiation with all the parties<br />
involved. The Government has not failed to be firm where<br />
firmness is rneeded, but we have refused to indulge in the<br />
confrontationiist tactics that are so often urged on us.<br />
That is why i~ t has been swift reform.<br />
Against this, some professional commentators outside this<br />
House, and most of the amateur ones opposite, often call for<br />
a faster pace of reform. The secret of faster reform, we<br />
are told, liets in the amount of hair on the chest of<br />
Government: solutions should be imposed unilaterally by<br />
Government and let the devil take the hindmost.<br />
One can tell these commentators are not living in the real<br />
world by the way they float new proposals. When they are<br />
presented with irrefutable evidence of Government progress<br />
in micro-reform, their sole response is to play catch-up:<br />
" Oh, we'd do that and more" as if the mere wish could be<br />
the father to the deed.<br />
Fortunately for the nation, those in this House who indulge<br />
in these stupidities do so from the safe impotence of<br />
Opposition. It is fortunate, because their whole approach<br />
is a recipe for disaster.<br />
Lacking any sort of detailed strategy of how they would<br />
actually achieve reform, they are forced to peddle the<br />
pleasant deception that easy reform and painless change can<br />
be won through confrontation.<br />
Of course real progress is not made by bringing the nation<br />
to a stand-still in some pointless industrial confrontation;<br />
real progress can only be made by harnessing businesses,<br />
trade unions, and governments in a cooperative pursuit of<br />
their common interests.<br />
Mr Speaker,<br />
There are no easy reforms or painless changes to be made.<br />
Reforming entrenched community attitudes and institutions is<br />
hard work but it is hard work this Government is<br />
determined to undertake and to bring to effective<br />
conclusion. That way, Mr Speaker, there will be many more progress<br />
reports from this Government describing our continued,<br />
effective and. rapid progress in micro-economic reform,<br />
creating an increasingly efficient, productive and<br />
competitive nation. </p>
