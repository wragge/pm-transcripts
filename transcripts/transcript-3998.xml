REIPORT ON PORT HEDLAND CYCLONE<br />
8.12.75 In a statement, the Prime Minister, Mr Malcolm Fraser, said:<br />
I would like to express my concern and sympathy for those who have lost their<br />
homes in the Port Hedland cyclone.<br />
I am relieved to hear that there has been no loss of life from the cyclone which<br />
affected Port Hedland earlier today.<br />
I have asked the Special Minister of State, Senator Withers, to go to Port<br />
Hedland tomorrow, not only in his own capacity as a Minister but also to<br />
represent me. I-Id will report directly to me on the damage caused by the cyclone.<br />
I am informed that the Premier of Western Australia, Sir Charles Court, went<br />
to Port Hedland this afternoon.<br />
We stand ready to co-operate with the State Government on the appropriate<br />
measures to relieve hardship and distress.<br />
