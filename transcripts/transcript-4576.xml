PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR PRESS 2 DECEMBER 1977<br />
PROTECTING EMPLOYMENT<br />
People used to believe that if there was one thing you could<br />
count on the Labor party for, it was protecting the jobs of<br />
Australian workers. Well, that idea went out like the baby with<br />
the bathwater under Mr. Whitlam and the Labor Government.<br />
In one year, no less than 190,000 Australians lost their jobs,<br />
but in this election the Labor party is asking us to believe<br />
that it is back in the business of creating jobs, that it will<br />
cure unemployment--the unemployment caused by its own policies.<br />
Events this week have seen the end of that particular myth.<br />
On Tuesday, the clothing industry met the Labor party in<br />
Melbourne. They asked them to match the commitment which the<br />
Liberal Government has already announced of much needed protection<br />
against rising imports.<br />
My Government has said it will not allow these to destroy<br />
120,000 jobs in the clothing, footwear and textile industries<br />
in cities and country towns right across Australia.<br />
We have promised to extend protection for another three years<br />
until conditions improve.<br />
Mr. Hawke told the clothing industry on Tuesday that Labor would<br />
do the same he put it in writing, but then there was a telephonehook-<br />
up between Mr. Whitlam, Mr. Hayden and Mr. Young, and they<br />
said No commitment to protection for these 120,000 workers<br />
will be given at the present time.<br />
Th * is is simply another way of saying that Labor's latest export<br />
to low cost countries will be Australian jobs.<br />
My advice to people working in these industries is to support the<br />
attitude of their employers, the Liberal Government, and many of<br />
their own union leaders. Labor has now given them a clear warning.<br />
It has said under Labor, beware of your job. On the jobs issue,<br />
Labor is disastrously split. </p>
