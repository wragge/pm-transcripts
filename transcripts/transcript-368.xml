STATEi4ENT BY THE 1RIME MINISTE ( RT. HON. HR. G. MNZIE;<br />
IN THE HOUSE OF aEPRPESENTATIVES<br />
1EDNESDAY 2_ 13TH SEPTEMBER 1 61<br />
NUCLEAR. TEST<br />
On 7th September I made some observations on the<br />
resumption by the Soviet Union of nuclear bomb testing, and sai<br />
that I might make a further statement this week. I should lie<br />
now to trace in more detail the course of negotiation on thiz.<br />
most important question, and to examine some of its<br />
implications for us.<br />
Eiarly Western Proposals Rejected by U. S. S. R.:<br />
It was in July 1957, that the ' 4estern Pouers on the<br />
Sub-Committee of the United Nations Disarmrament Commission first<br />
proposed that a group of experts meet to devise an inspection<br />
system to control the suspension of nuclear tests. T'he Soviet<br />
Union did not respond.<br />
The following month the Uestern Powers proposed the<br />
suspension of nuclear tests for two years, during which time a<br />
s; stem of international inspection could be worked out to ensure<br />
that all future production of fissionable material would be used<br />
solely for peaceful purposes. In making these prcposal, the<br />
ifcstern Powers again called on the Soviet Union to join in expe: t<br />
studies. The Soviet Union refused.<br />
In November, 1957, these proposals woro endorsed by the<br />
United Nations General Asserbly but the Soviet Union still<br />
refused to discuss them.<br />
Not until March, 1958, after Russia had concluded a<br />
series of test-, and just before the start of a United States<br />
series, did the Soviet Union announce that it would suspend tests<br />
unilaterally for six months. The Iest pointed out that unilato7%--<br />
declarations, without a system of inspection and control to<br />
ensure that the declarations were being honoured, wero valueless;<br />
and called again on the Soviet Union to take part in technical<br />
discussion on the feasibility of devising an effective system<br />
and the form it might taku. This time the Soviet Union agreed.<br />
The Conference of Exp. Lrts lo7s:<br />
So, in July and August, 1958, the first conference of<br />
exports met in Geneva, The experts, including the Russian<br />
experts, concluded that it was possible to devise a practicable<br />
system for detocting violaticns of an agremont to sispend<br />
nuclear weapons tests. The United Kingdom and the United States<br />
thereupon announced that they wvere prepared to suspend tests for<br />
one year from 31st Octobur, 1958, : n ce rtain conditions0 One<br />
that negotiations should begin on that date for the conclusion<br />
of a treaty on the suspension of tests under ffectivo international<br />
control. Anothter was that Russia should not rosuilme<br />
ts ting.<br />
O _ oni. oEf-E Nozotiations, Octob 8:<br />
The Conference opend at Geneva on 31st October, 1958.<br />
On 1st November the very next day the Soviet Union oxploded<br />
an atomic device. Two days lator it exploded another. Despite<br />
this flagrant breach of faith, the United States declared that<br />
would adhore to its undcrta1ing, provided the Soviet Union<br />
refrained from further tcsting.<br />
From that . time, noarly throo years ago, the<br />
negotiations have continued, . with occasional adjournmonts and<br />
they are still technically continuing: despite tho Sovio<br />
rPsumption of testing they have still not formally been broken </p>
<p>off. Progress has been slow. From the beginning it was<br />
apparent that Western and Soviet views on what constituted an.<br />
adequate, reliable and acceptable treaty were very far apart.<br />
But by painstaking porsistonce, with the United Kingdom and t.:<br />
United States making every effort of compromise to break deadlocks,<br />
the areas of fundamontal disagreement were perceptib:<br />
narrowed. djournnent of Conference, December 1.960:<br />
When the Conference adjourned in December, 1960, in tan<br />
last days of the Eisenhower Administration, thore had been<br />
adopted a preamble and seventeen articles of a draft treaty, an:'<br />
two annexes. Important differences on issues of principle still<br />
remained unresolved, but the progress which had already been<br />
made encouraged the hope that with persoveiance agreemont could<br />
yet be reached on the outstanding points. ' With perseverance~,<br />
I have said: perhaps I should have added ' and with goodwill and<br />
sincere endeavour'. For there were already by the end of last<br />
year disquieting signs. Honourable ai-ners may recall that, as<br />
I stated to the pe: ss afterwards, when I talked wi. th iMr<br />
Khrushchev in N-, w York on 12th October, 1960, he oxprs-'~ d tihe<br />
view that the suspension of nuclear tests was of diminishing<br />
importance. Nevertheless the ! estern Po,, wrs, for their part,<br />
continued their unremitting efforts to seek agroement.<br />
Resumption of Conforence, March 1-61:<br />
Presi. dent Kennedy, on assmiing office, ordoeed an<br />
intensive review of the issues involved, and when the<br />
Conference resumed on 21st March, 1961, a now set of proposals<br />
was submitted by the United States and the United Kingdom.<br />
These proposals, which incorporate important concessions to<br />
Russian positions, were:-<br />
1. To reduce the number of on-site inspctions in each of the<br />
nucljar countries fro~ m a fixed figure of twenty to a<br />
possible twelve, depending on the number of suspicious<br />
seismic oeJnts;<br />
20 To reduce the number of control posts on Soviet tor: itory<br />
from twenty-one to nineteen;<br />
3, To extend from twenty-soven months to three years the<br />
proposed moratorium on snaller underground tests and the<br />
associated research prograrir.' oz,<br />
4. To institute a ban on all nuclar woapons tests at high<br />
altitudes and in outer space;<br />
To ask Congress for legislative authority to permit Soviet<br />
inspection of the internal mechanism of the nucloar device;<br />
used in the seismic research and peaceful uses progrcammes:<br />
6. To accept the Soviet request for veto over the annual bud,-,<br />
of the control organization;<br />
7. To accept the Soviet demand for a parity of seats between<br />
' icstern and Soviet bloc States on the top Control<br />
Commission an arrangement which would give the Soviet<br />
Union a voice in guiding the control system equal to that<br />
the United States and the United Kingdor combined, and<br />
which would be unprecodented in an international<br />
organization. </p>
<p>Then on 18th April, building on the agreements already<br />
reached and incorporating these now proposals, the United States<br />
and the United Kingdom tabled a complete draft treaty for the<br />
suspension of nuclear weapons tests.<br />
Soviet Reversal The Soviet reaction was ominous and disheartoning. Not<br />
only did the Soviet Delegate, Mr. Tsarapkin, return to the<br />
conference table without constructive proposals, making it clear<br />
that the Soviet Union had not used the three months' adjournnont<br />
to seek ways of resolving points of difference, but he even went<br />
back on an agreement which the Soviet Union had made over a year<br />
previously. He insisted that, instead of having, as had boon<br />
agreed, a single neutral administrator as chief executive officer<br />
of the control organization, there should be established a<br />
triumvirate of administrators, one from the Soviet group, one<br />
from the western powers and one from the ' neutralists', who<br />
would be required to reach their decisions unanimously. Each<br />
member would therefore have a veto. This is the so-called<br />
' Troika! principle which the Soviet Union put forward at the last<br />
Geniral Assembly of the United Nations to replace the office of<br />
Secretary-General. It would give the Soviet Union the power to<br />
prevent any inspection by the control organization of m-uspected<br />
breaches of the treaty by the Soviet Union,<br />
Konncdy-Khrushchev Moeting in Vienna:<br />
This uncompromising, retrograde attitude was<br />
continued by Mr. Khrushchev when he met President Kenneoly in<br />
Vienna. The Russian ' Aide-nemoire' or memorandum of 4th June<br />
reiterates this new Soviet contention that " there do not and<br />
cannot exist neutral men". I call it " now" advisedly, because in<br />
January of last year, Mr. Tsarapkin, the Soviet negotiator said<br />
at the Conference: " Out of the three thousand million human<br />
beings on earth we shall always be able to find someone on whor<br />
you and we can agree". And the following month he said: " In<br />
neutral countries it will always be possible to find a person, a<br />
really neutral person, who can be used for the job of carrying<br />
out the duties of administrator". And in June, 1960, he said:<br />
" It will always be possible to discover in the world a person<br />
acceptable to both sides for nomination for the post as<br />
administrator". The Vienna Memorandum also proposed that the<br />
negotiations on the suspension of nuclear tests should be merged<br />
with discussion of general complete disarmament. That is to say,<br />
the Russians proposed that the measure of agreement which had<br />
been so painfully won through nearly three years of patient<br />
negotiation should be tossed back into the molting pot. They<br />
proposed that agreement on the suspension of nuclear weapons<br />
tests, which is, despite its complexities, a relatively simple<br />
operation, should be made dependent upon achieving agreement on<br />
the much vaster and the infinitely more complicated question of<br />
general and complete disarnament. This Memorandum also<br />
disclosed the hollowness of the much vaunted offeo to accept<br />
unconditionally any proposals of the ! estern Powers on control if<br />
they would accept the Russian proposal on general and complete<br />
disarmament This Memorandum makes it plain that the Russians<br />
wrill accept control and inspection only after disarmament has<br />
been completed because " as long as states maintain their Armed<br />
Forces, no control can be free from intolligenceo When Armed<br />
Forces are abolished and ari,. an: ents destroyed, then only control<br />
will not be connected with intelligence".<br />
The Memorandum further suggests that the policing of a<br />
disarmed world w-ould be through natbi:, nal contingents ( in other<br />
words there would be no standing international force) which </p>
<p>" could be used through the Security Council" ( that is to say<br />
they would be subject to the Russian veto). In addition, " all<br />
the main groups of States should, of course, be equally<br />
represented on the cormand of such international forces" ( that<br />
is to say they would be under a ' troika' command which would<br />
give the Soviet Union the power of veto over the day-to-day<br />
operations of the forces).<br />
United States Reply:<br />
The United States replied to this Memorandum in a<br />
Note of 17th June. This Note patiently rehearsed the substantial<br />
concessions which the WIest had offered since the talks resumed,<br />
pointed out the objections to the Russian proposals, and drew<br />
attention to the wider consequences for which the Soviet Union<br />
would be responsible. The Russian reply was a long Note dated 5th July which<br />
made no concessions but maintained the new Russian position<br />
uncompromisingly. The exchange ended with a United States Note of<br />
July which returned to the central issue and sought to<br />
determine whether the Soviet Union was willing to reach an<br />
agreement which would halt nuclear weapons tests under effective<br />
international control.<br />
Broakdown of Conference:<br />
The Conference at Geneva continued, despite all<br />
discouragnremnt, with the Jest still trying to meet the Russian<br />
objections. On 28th and 30th August the United Kingdom and<br />
United States representatives made three new and important<br />
concessions:-( 1 They tried to satisfy the Soviet Union completely<br />
about small underground tests. ( These at present<br />
cannot be reliably detected and a moratorium had been<br />
suggested to allow research into improved detection<br />
methods.) The now proposals envisaged consultation<br />
before the moratorium ended. During the last six<br />
months a panel of experts would report on recommended<br />
improvements in tno control system, the capability of<br />
the system in the light of these improvements, and<br />
whether or not it would be possible to reduce or<br />
eliminate altogether the range of undetectable<br />
explosions. They tried to satisfy the Russian doubts about the<br />
impartiality of the administrator, by making him<br />
removable from office by simple majority vote in the<br />
Control Cormission which wo. uld comprise four Russians,<br />
four WJestern representatives, and three neutrals.<br />
They tried to allay Russian fears that inspection<br />
teans would be used for espionage by offering to make<br />
half the number of each team nationals of " uncommitted"<br />
countries.<br />
The Soviet reply, made on the same day as the last two of these<br />
concessions, was to announce its intention to resume testing.<br />
Soviet Resumption of Tests:<br />
On Ist September the Soviet Union exploded a nuclear<br />
device. ' von this did not exhaust the patience or the hope of<br />
the Western leaders. On 3rd September, as I mentioned last </p>
<p>week, President Kennedy and Mr. Macmillan made a joint offer to<br />
Mr. Khrushchev that their three governments agree, with imrediate<br />
effect, not to conduct nuclear tests in the atmosphere such as<br />
would produce radio active fall-out. They proposed that their<br />
representatives meet at Geneva on 9th Septenber to record this<br />
agreement. They further emphasized that this proposal was not in<br />
any way conditional upon the establishment of new or additional<br />
controls and that they were prepared to rely on existing longrange<br />
methods of detection which would not involve entry into or<br />
overflight of Russian territory.<br />
The Russian reply, as we all know, was the explosion of<br />
a second nuclear device, and a third and then a fourth. The<br />
explosion of four atomic devices within a span of six days<br />
points to a high degree of planning and advance preparation over<br />
a long period. It means that Soviet participation at the Geneva<br />
talks has for some time been a sham. It neans that while they<br />
have allegedly been negotiating for the suspension of nuclear<br />
weapons tests they have been preparing an extensive series of<br />
tests which, it must be assumed, will add materially to Russian<br />
nuclear weapons capability. In this context I would again<br />
recall that on 28th August, 1959, the Soviet Government<br />
announced its decision " not to resume nuclear explosions" if the<br />
estern Powers did not resume. In the face of the Soviet Union's<br />
patent indifference to the Western proposals or world opinion,<br />
President Kennedy found himself obliged to make the followin<br />
announcement on 5th September, after the third in the present<br />
series of Russian tests:-<br />
" In view of the continued testing by the Soviet<br />
Government, I have today ordered the resumption of nuclear<br />
tests in the laboratory and underground with no fall-out.<br />
" In our efforts to achieve an end to nuclear testing,<br />
we have taken every step that reasonable men could justify.<br />
" In view of the acts of the Soviet Government, we must<br />
now take those steps which prudent men find essential. We<br />
have no other choice in fulfilment of the responsibilities<br />
of the United States Government to its own citizens and to<br />
the security of other free nations.<br />
" Our offer to make an agreement to end all fall-out<br />
tests remains open until September 9."<br />
Recent Developments: The Soviet Union has now rejected the joint United<br />
Kingdom-United States offer and gone on to conduct t0eefurther<br />
atmospheric tests of nuclear devices, two with a force of several<br />
megatons, that is to say, equivalent in explosive power to<br />
several million tons of TNT. Mr. Khrushchev, in rejecting the<br />
Western offer, contended that a nuclear tests suspension<br />
agreement must be considered in the wider context of general and<br />
complete disarmament, This Soviet reaction, as I suggested last<br />
Thursday, provided " a complete test of the good faith and<br />
pacific intentions of the Communists". They have failed that<br />
test. In contradiction to Mr. Khrushchev's repeated statements<br />
on the need tc protect th . world from the dangers of radio-active<br />
fall-out, they have brushed aside the offer of an aZreement<br />
which would have done just this.<br />
The Soviet claim that it is not prepared to conclude<br />
partial disarmament or suspension agreements, but wishes to<br />
consider all those problems in the context of general and<br />
complete disarmanent, is a transparent propaganda device. The<br />
problem of general and complete disarmament is vast and complex<br />
and a solution cannot be achieved by " short-cuts". The West </p>
<p>has always believed that a major stop towards general<br />
disarmament would be the conclusion of a nuclear tests ban treaty.<br />
In fact, some progress had been made towards the establishment of<br />
such a treaty. Yet the Soviet Union by its present actions seems<br />
prepared to nullify the progress already naeo. In the light of<br />
this Soviet intransigence it was no surpri: s when the Geneva<br />
conference adjourned indefinitely on 9th September.<br />
On 10th September, immediately after adjournment of the<br />
conference, the Soviet Union announced that it would begin<br />
testing mu] ti-stage rockets to be fired into the Pacific Ocean in<br />
an area south-west of Hawaii. The rockets to be tested are said<br />
to be more powerful and improved versions of multi-stago carrier<br />
rockets already used in space experiments.<br />
Commentary The record makes it clear that the Soviet Union has,<br />
from the outset, treated the whole issue of nuclear tests bans<br />
with complete cynicism, recklessly pursuing what it conceives as<br />
its national interest yet at the same time playing on the hopes<br />
and fears of the millions of peace-loving people throughout the<br />
world. The first Russian " suspension" in March, 1958, followed<br />
completion of one series of tests. The next series, in November,<br />
1958, was pressed through with a total disrogard of international<br />
opinion. In August, 1959, presumably when the irmmediate<br />
requirenents of the Russian military machine had been met, a<br />
solemn promise was given that the U. S. S. R. would not be the first<br />
to conduct any further nuclear tests. The events of these last<br />
days show how-uch faith can be placed in assurances of this kind.<br />
It is also clear that while professing to ne: otiate seriously at<br />
Geneva, the Russians were making detailed prcp-rations for the<br />
current series of tests. No doubt as soon as the series has<br />
been completed there will be yet another Soviet proposal for an<br />
unconditional suspension on both sides, with the Communist<br />
propaganda machine fully mobilized to denounce the United States<br />
if it continues the tests it has now been forced to undertake.<br />
The Australian Government commends the patience and<br />
restraint contrasting sharply with the Soviet approach to this<br />
issue which the Western loaders have shown throughout the long<br />
and ( as now proved) fruitless negotiations at Geneva. Still more<br />
commendable have been their persistent and imaginative efforts to<br />
seek out every possibility of agreenent and, in recent days, to<br />
salvage something from the wreck. Given the total lack of<br />
response from the Soviet Union, it is inconceivable that the<br />
United States should continue its self-imposed ban on nuclear<br />
testing in the present grave situation. My Government wholeheartedly<br />
supports President Kennedy's decision to resume underground<br />
tests, a decision which the Soviet actions have now made<br />
essential to the security of the free nations. For, let us make<br />
no mistake, our own security is directly involved. So long as<br />
the Soviet Union refuses to conclude an effective aroeeent for<br />
the prohibition and control of nuclear tests, we will be left in<br />
the grim position that the only assurance that its leaders will<br />
not resort to the ultimate weapon is the knowledge that its use<br />
would mean their own annihilation.<br />
At the same time it is noteworthy that even now the<br />
United States, at a substantial sacrifice in time, convenience<br />
and money, still refrains from carrying out the atmospheric tests<br />
which generate fall-out. There is a clear and important<br />
difference between the atmospheric tests conducted by the<br />
Russians and the underground testing now being undrtaken by the<br />
United States. </p>
<p>Although the recent Lo_ v. i et actions have not com., e as<br />
a complete surprise, their suclacnness a.-id brutality and the<br />

27th Locember, 1960 President Eisenhower announced that the United<br />
States would consider itself free to resume<br />
nuclear weapon, testing when its voluntary<br />
moratorium expired on 31st December, 1959, but<br />
that it would not resume testing without<br />
announcing its intention in advance,<br />
The United States, supported by the United<br />
Kingdom, presented to the Conference a proposal<br />
for a phased treaty which would immediately<br />
end all nuclear weapon, tests in those<br />
environments where effective control could be<br />
established. The proposal called for a ban on all tests above<br />
ground up to the maximum height to which effective<br />
controls could be agreed, all underwater<br />
tests, and all underground tests above a seismic<br />
magnitude of 4o75 on the Richter seismographia<br />
scale( This magnitude became known as the<br />
" threshold").<br />
France exploded its first nuclear device in the<br />
Sahara Desert.<br />
The Soviet Union expressed its willingness to<br />
agree to a treaty banning all tests in the<br />
atmosphere, underwater and in cosmic space,<br />
and all underground tests above seismic magnitude<br />
4.75, contingent on a proviso that all parti-s<br />
to the treaty undertook an obligation not to test<br />
below the threshold daring the period required to<br />
conduct a research programme.<br />
The United States and the United Kingdom declared<br />
themselves willing to accept a temporary, unilaterally<br />
declared, moratorium on tests below the<br />
threshold. It was made clear that neither country<br />
would institute this moratorium until the remaining<br />
treaty issues e. g. quota for on-siteinspections,<br />
voting procedures, etc. were resolved.<br />
France exploded its second nuclear device in the<br />
Sahara LDsert.<br />
The Soviet Union declared that the United Kingdom<br />
United States declaration of 29th March could<br />
have a " positive" effect on bringing the positions<br />
of the East and West closer together on an agreemont<br />
to halt nuclear weapon tests.<br />
A conference of scientists from the United Kingdom,<br />
the United States and the Soviet Union convened<br />
to exchange information on the research programmes<br />
each power believed should be undertakon to<br />
improve capabilities for detecting and identifying<br />
underground nuclear explosions.<br />
The Geneva Conference on the Discontinuance of<br />

28th August, 1961 The. Geneva Conference on tha . Di oc( uAtf inlanon of<br />
Nuclear Weapon Tests rn-oponed. The United<br />
States pros nt. d new proposals covering most<br />
of the contentious issues relating to the control<br />
system which still remained.<br />
The Soviet Union demanded, contrary to its<br />
earlier position, that the proposed Administrator<br />
of any agreed treaty should be replaced by a<br />
triumvirate representing Soviet, Western and<br />
Uncommitted nations and that all decisions should<br />
be unanimous. The Soviet Union for the first<br />
time raised the question of French nuclear uesting<br />
claiming it would have a " negative" effect on<br />
the Conference.<br />
The United Kingdom and the United States'<br />
representatives at the Geneva Conference on the<br />
Discontinuance of Nuclear Weapon Tests introduced<br />
the text of a complete draft treaty for banning<br />
nuclear tests.<br />
France exploded its fourth nuclear device in the<br />
Sahara Deserto<br />
Mr. Khrushchev meeting with Mr. Kennedy in Vienna<br />
handed the latter an " Aide-Memdre" restating the<br />
Soviet points of view on the Western proposals<br />
for a Draft Treaty. In this " Aide-Memoire", the<br />
Soviet Union propounded the view that it was<br />
impossible to find a " neutral man" and that it<br />
was thus necessary for any body administering a<br />
Nuclear Tests Dan Treaty to be a tripartite body<br />
and for any international peace-keeping body to<br />
operate through the Security Council with a<br />
bipartite commission. These two proposals lay<br />
open the way to Soviet veto.<br />
The United States Government delivered a Note to<br />
the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs in reply to<br />
the Soviet " Aido-Memoire" which rebutted the<br />
arguments of the Soviet Union, drawing attention<br />
to the handicaps of the Soviet " troika" proposal<br />
and pointing out that truly neutral officials<br />
have frequently held international office before.<br />
The Soviet Union forwarded a Note to the Government<br />
of the United States which in greater length<br />
repeated the arguments already advanced in the<br />
Soviet " Aide Menoiro" of 4th June.<br />
The Government of the United States of America<br />
forwarded a further Note to the Soviet Government<br />
in reply to the Soviet Note of 15th July, but<br />
concentrating on the central issue in dispute;<br />
that of whether the Soviet Union really wished<br />
to negotiate an effective Nuclear Tests Dan<br />
Treaty. The Note pointed out that despite<br />
Western concessions on all points which the<br />
Soviet Union had stated to be stumbling blocks,<br />
the Soviet Union remained intransigent.<br />
The Western representatives at the Geneva Conference<br />
mada concessions designed to satisfy the<br />
Soviet Union completely on what would happen<br />
towards the end of the moratorium on small underground<br />
tests. Provision would be made for a panel<br />
of experts to report on improvements in a control<br />
system and recomendat.-ons made on whether the<br />
" Threshold" should be lowered or eliminated. </p>

September, 1961 The Western representatives at the Geneva Conference<br />
made concessions designed to satisfy the<br />
Soviet Union on the remaining matters which the<br />
Soviet Union claimed constituted obstacles to the<br />
conclusion of a treaty. These further concessions<br />
covered the position of the Administrator of<br />
a treaty providing for his replacement by a<br />
majority vote in the Control Commission if he<br />
proved unsatisfactory and the inclusion in<br />
inspection teams operating in the territory of<br />
the original parties of the treaty of 50% of<br />
members from uncommitted countries.<br />
The Soviet Union announced that it was resuming<br />
the testing of nuclear eapons.<br />
The Soviet Union exploded a nuclear device in the<br />
atmosphere in Soviet Central Asia. The device was<br />
in the " intermediate" range ( approximately<br />
kilotons). The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and the<br />
President of the United States proposed to Mr.<br />
Khrushchev that the United Kingdom, the " nited<br />
States and the U. S. S. R. agree immediately not to<br />
conduct nuclear tests in the atmosphere which<br />
would produce fallout. This offer was to remain<br />
open until 9th September.<br />
The Soviet Union exploded a iucloar dev co in the<br />

The Soviet Union exploded a nuclear device of<br />
" intermediate" range in the atmosphere in Soviet<br />
Central Asia. This was the third device exploded<br />

President Kennedy issued a statement that " in<br />
view of the continued testing by the Soviet<br />
Government, I have today ordered the resumption<br />
of nuclear tests in laboratory and underground<br />
with no fall-out". President Kennedy further stated<br />
that the offer he had made jointly with Mro<br />
Macmillan still remained open until 9th September.<br />
A White House spokesman said that testing would<br />
resume some time in September.<br />
