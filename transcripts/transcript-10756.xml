<p> LAWS:</p>
<p>On the line from our Canberra studios, the Prime Minister of Australia,</p>
<p>   John Howard. Good morning Prime Minister.</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Good morning John. Nice to be with you.</p>
<p> LAWS:</p>
<p>Good to be able to talk to you. Can I preface our discussion by</p>
<p>   saying that I have, and you know it, that I have absolutely nothing</p>
<p>   against the GST. I would rather be the supporter of GST. I don't</p>
<p>   think we should get too wound up discussing it until we have some</p>
<p>   more detail but I do feel that you have left the door open for a</p>
<p>   terrific amount of criticism trying to sell it because of the use</p>
<p>   of the word, permanently', and the use of the words,</p>
<p>   never ever'. Do you agree?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No I don't. Back in 93, I am sorry, back in 95</p>
<p>   before the last election I ruled out a GST, and you have referred</p>
<p>   to that, and that is fair enough, and I don't deny using those</p>
<p>   words. And you will be aware of course that I haven't tried</p>
<p>   to introduce a GST or tax reform during our first term in Government.</p>
<p>   We have formed the view that tax reform, including possibly a broad</p>
<p>   based, indirect tax, or GST, whatever you might want to call it,</p>
<p>   is desirable for Australia and we are going to the public at the</p>
<p>   next election and we are laying out our plan and if the public don't</p>
<p>   like it, then they will vote against us, and we will fail.</p>
<p> LAWS:</p>
<p>But Prime Minister but never, ever means never, ever.</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>John, when you say to the public, your position is X, you have an</p>
<p>   election and you stick to that and then you believe in the national</p>
<p>   interest it should no longer be X, What is wrong with then going</p>
<p>   to the public and saying, we have changed our position but before</p>
<p>   we implement our changed position we are going to give you a chance</p>
<p>   of voting against us.</p>
<p> LAWS:</p>
<p>I don't see anything wrong with that at all.</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, that is all I have done.</p>
<p> LAWS:</p>
<p>But, my only comment, my only comment on the whole thing is...</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>If there's nothing wrong with it, what's all the fuss.</p>
<p>   I don't mean you but I mean from others. That is about as open</p>
<p>   and as transparent as anybody can ever get in politics. It is different,</p>
<p>   if I may say so, from what the Labor Party did in 93.</p>
<p> LAWS:</p>
<p>I accept the fact that people should be able to change their mind.</p>
<p>   In fact I have always said that I believed it to be an indication</p>
<p>   of a big mind if a man can say, well hang on, that might not have</p>
<p>   been quite right. Let's have a look at it this way.</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>It's not a question of not being right. I mean, you can form</p>
<p>   a different view and if you are honest enough to put another election</p>
<p>   between the change of mind and the implementation about change of</p>
<p>   mind, that could be, you can't be more open and transparent</p>
<p>   otherwise we would all be lumbered with the views we had 20 years</p>
<p>   ago. Now you would agree that some of the views you had 20 years</p>
<p>   ago on certain issues have changed. So have mine and they will change</p>
<p>   again, and providing, in my case as a Prime Minister or a political</p>
<p>   leader, I am open with the public and I say, right, I have changed</p>
<p>   my position but before I implement that changed position, I am going</p>
<p>   to give the public an opportunity at a general election of passing</p>
<p>   a verdict, of making a decision as to whether they support my change</p>
<p>   of mind. </p>
<p>Now that is very different, if I may say so again, and it's</p>
<p>   a very important comparison. In 1993 Mr Beazley and Mr Keating said</p>
<p>   they were against a GST and they would give us L-A-W law income</p>
<p>   tax cuts and they were against indirect tax rises. They got re-elected</p>
<p>   and then they changed their mind, but the crucial difference is</p>
<p>   that they changed their mind without giving the public an opportunity</p>
<p>   of passing a verdict on their change of mind and they repudiated</p>
<p>   all of those promises immediately after they had been re-elected.</p>
<p>   Now you know as well as I do that in the 1993 election campaign,</p>
<p>   if the Australian public had known from Paul Keating and Kim Beazley</p>
<p>   that they were going to increase all of those indirect taxes, that</p>
<p>   they were going to renege on the L-A-W law tax. What would have</p>
<p>   happened is that John Hewson would have become Prime Minister of</p>
<p>   Australia in 1993 and the difference between me and them is that</p>
<p>   I am saying to the public now, openly, candidly, my position now</p>
<p>   is that I am in favour of tax reform. I will give you all of the</p>
<p>   details and you can make a judgement before I implement it, and</p>
<p>   if you don't like it, you will vote against me. If you do like</p>
<p>   it, you will vote for me. Now that is the difference. It's</p>
<p>   open, it's transparent and it's honourable.</p>
<p> LAWS:</p>
<p>But you are drawing the parallel between Kim Beazley and Paul Keating</p>
<p>   talking about L-A-W law tax cuts and then going ahead and introducing</p>
<p>   certain other increases in taxes without having pre-told the electorate</p>
<p>   that that is...</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I am sorry, it was worse than that.</p>
<p> LAWS:</p>
<p>.... anyway, that they would do it.</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, no, it was worse than that because what they effectively did</p>
<p>   after the 93 election, and this is the view of the best academic</p>
<p>   on indirect tax in Australia, Dr Neil Warren, was to introduce in</p>
<p>   effect their own GST. They did it without any compensation. So not</p>
<p>   only did they, before 1993, say look fellas, we are going to give</p>
<p>   you income tax cuts, and go back on that, in addition they said,</p>
<p>   we are not only against Hewson's GST but we are against any</p>
<p>   increases in indirect taxes and taxes are going to go down. Now</p>
<p>   they got elected and they did the complete opposite and they promised</p>
<p>   tax cuts and no GST. When they got in they gave you no tax cuts</p>
<p>   or only half of what they promised and they gave you their version</p>
<p>   of a GST without consulting the public again.</p>
<p> LAWS:</p>
<p>But you've just done the reverse. You've promised people</p>
<p>   no GST, never, ever, permanently off the agenda and then gave them</p>
<p>   one.</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Hang on, no I haven't given them one. I will only give them</p>
<p>   one if they vote for me in the full knowledge that they will get</p>
<p>   it. That's the difference. You can't, I am sorry John,</p>
<p>   you can't, nobody can argue against a bloke saying look, that</p>
<p>   was my position, I have now had a different, formed a different</p>
<p>   view but before I implement that different view I am going to give</p>
<p>   the public an opportunity to vote against me if they don't</p>
<p>   like the new view. </p>
<p>Now Keating and Beazley did not do that in 93. That's</p>
<p>   the difference. We are being open and transparent. They in 1993</p>
<p>   were deceitful and dishonest and if they had put their plans on</p>
<p>   the table, if they had revealed in the 93 election campaign</p>
<p>   what the 93 Dawkins' budget was going to contain, I believe</p>
<p>   John Hewson would have won that election and won it quite easily.</p>
<p>LAWS:</p>
<p>Well I am not sure that I would agree with that given that, I mean</p>
<p>   there was a....</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>That's a bit academic. Whether Hewson would have won or not</p>
<p>   is academic but the behaviour is different. I mean, what I am saying</p>
<p>   to the public is yes. My view now is different from what it was</p>
<p>   but I am going to lay out my new policy and I am going to give you</p>
<p>   an opportunity to pass judgement on it and if you don't like</p>
<p>   it, you can vote against it. If you do like it, you can vote for</p>
<p>   it. Now I don't know how more transparent, open and honest a political</p>
<p>   leader can be.</p>
<p> LAWS:</p>
<p>But Prime Minister, my comment to you, I agree with everything you</p>
<p>   are saying abut changing minds and certainly...</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>And the openness.</p>
<p> LAWS:</p>
<p>I agree with the fact that you have been open about it in a convoluted</p>
<p>   kind of way.</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I don't think it's convoluted if you say to the public, I have</p>
<p>   changed my mind.</p>
<p> LAWS:</p>
<p>But you didn't say that. I haven't heard you say, I've</p>
<p>   changed my mind.</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I have just said it. I now believe that it is in the long-term</p>
<p>   interest of this country to have tax reform.</p>
<p> LAWS:</p>
<p>And never ever, in the minds of the Opposition and the minds of</p>
<p>   those who are opposed to a GST when it comes from the lips of John</p>
<p>   Howard, means three years.</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, that's not right. I mean it depends entirely upon... well</p>
<p>   it depends what issue. I mean, I am not going to deny what I said</p>
<p>   but what I am saying to the Australian public...</p>
<p>LAWS:</p>
<p>You can't.</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I can't and I won't. I am not going to insult the intelligence</p>
<p>   of the public and say that I didn't say it and that was before</p>
<p>   the last election and I have honoured that during this term. There</p>
<p>   is no GST during this term and now I am saying to the Australian</p>
<p>   public I have come to the conclusion and my Government has come</p>
<p>   to the conclusion that despite what we may have said in the past</p>
<p>   and what views we held in the past, we believe tax reform is essential</p>
<p>   to further secure and give safety to the Australian economy and</p>
<p>   we are going to lay out a plan, we are going to lay it out before</p>
<p>   the public before the next election and to give the public an opportunity.</p>
<p>   They can pass judgement. If they don't like me, if they don't</p>
<p>   like my plans for Australia then they can vote Labor. If they do</p>
<p>   like our plans for Australia they can vote for the Coalition. And</p>
<p>   we're not holding anything back. I mean, the difference between</p>
<p>   me and Kim Beazley on this issue is that he held something back</p>
<p>   in 93 because he knew that if the Australian public had been</p>
<p>   told that they were going to jack up those indirect taxes in the</p>
<p>   93 budget, they would have voted for the Liberal Party.</p>
<p>Now what I am saying to the Australian public is, I will give you</p>
<p>   the details of my plan. The benefits that accrue to the Australian</p>
<p>   public from that plan, if you like it you will support it. If you</p>
<p>   don't you will vote for the Australian Labor Party. Now that</p>
<p>   is what democracy is all about.</p>
<p> LAWS:</p>
<p>Now John, unlike you, you seem to be missing the point that I am</p>
<p>   endeavouring to make here, and the only point that I have made about</p>
<p>   it is that I would have thought, given the comments that you made,</p>
<p>   given the phraseology like never, ever, and permanently, that you</p>
<p>   were going to have a great deal of difficulty selling a GST. Do</p>
<p>   you not accept that?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I don't believe selling a GST or, I won't be selling a</p>
<p>   GST. I will be selling tax reform. I want to make it very plain.</p>
<p> LAWS:</p>
<p>But part of it will be a GST.</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>A broad based, indirect tax is clearly one of the options. We haven't</p>
<p>   formulated all the details yet but obviously, if we are going to</p>
<p>   reform the tax system in a big way you have got to get rid of the</p>
<p>   existing wholesale tax system and if we do have a broad based, indirect</p>
<p>   tax or a GST, we will throw out the existing wholesale tax system</p>
<p>   lock, stock and barrel with all of the inequities and lopsided approaches</p>
<p>   that it contains and of course, one of the advantages of a broad</p>
<p>   based, indirect tax and one of the reasons why we are looking at</p>
<p>   this again is that it attacks the black economy.</p>
<p>A couple of years ago an academic study was done in this country</p>
<p>   that showed that no less than $15 billion a year was being lost</p>
<p>   to the federal revenue through the black economy, through the cash</p>
<p>   economy, and one of the great advantages of a broad based, indirect</p>
<p>   tax or GST is that it attacks the black economy and that means that</p>
<p>   you and I and all the other honest tax payers in Australia will</p>
<p>   be better off because those who are now evading their responsibilities,</p>
<p>   will not be able to do it so easily, under a different tax system.</p>
<p>LAWS:</p>
<p>But do you....do you really think that the average battling Australian</p>
<p>   is going to care much about the justice of non-taxpaying people</p>
<p>   if it means their bread's going to cost more?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well the average Australian tax payer will be cranky if I produce</p>
<p>   a tax policy that makes them worse off. And I can promise them I</p>
<p>   won't. I will produce a tax policy that won't leave them</p>
<p>   worse off....</p>
<p>LAWS:</p>
<p>You see, because that's the difficulty of it at the moment.</p>
<p>   Fear, fear that exists because they don't have an understanding</p>
<p>   of it.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>John, John, I can, I understand that when all the details come</p>
<p>   out, and even now, we have the responsibility to explain and to</p>
<p>   advocate. Now I accept that. But if you're saying to me, that</p>
<p>   we face the job of selling and persuading and advocating, of course</p>
<p>   we do, I accept that. And it would be an easier life if I took the</p>
<p>   lazy approach and said, "oh, no, we'll leave a rotting,</p>
<p>   decaying tax system. To hell with the national interest, we won't</p>
<p>   do anything about it.". Now, John, Kim Beazley and Gareth Evans,</p>
<p>   they were in Government. They were in fact part of Paul Keating's</p>
<p>   tax push in 1985. They know, as I know, as Paul Keating knows, as</p>
<p>   you know, as John Hewson knows, anybody, Peter Reith, Peter Costello,</p>
<p>   anybody who's had any contact with the Australian taxation</p>
<p>   system over the years knows damn well that sooner or later we've</p>
<p>   got to reform it. I mean I can remember private discussions I've</p>
<p>   had with my colleagues on other sides of the House, particularly</p>
<p>   Paul Keating, about the need to change the tax system. There was</p>
<p>   a time, 13 years ago, when he and I were basically saying the same</p>
<p>   thing about tax reform even though we were on opposite sides of</p>
<p>   the House. And he knows that, and I remember it very well and I'm</p>
<p>   sure he does. Now all I'm saying is that there does come a</p>
<p>   time in the life of any political leader that you, when he's</p>
<p>   got to take some risks in the national interest. When he's</p>
<p>   got to say "well it might be unconventional, it might be unpopular,</p>
<p>   people may vote against." But if you really care the national</p>
<p>   interests, if you really believe that Australia needs a better taxation</p>
<p>   system, than you've got to take the risk. Now I can say to</p>
<p>   the battlers of Australia, you are not going to be worse off. Many</p>
<p>   of you will be better off. You're going to be fully protected</p>
<p>   if there is a broad based indirect tax. You will see in the compensation</p>
<p>   and personal income tax arrangements that you are certainly not</p>
<p>   disadvantaged and the great bulk of you will be advantaged The only</p>
<p>   people who will lose from my tax reform plan will be the cheats.</p>
<p>LAWS:</p>
<p>Will, will there definitely be reductions in regular income tax?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Of course there will be. </p>
<p>LAWS:</p>
<p>Dramatic increases?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>John, until people see the figures. They'll be significant</p>
<p>   and they'll be income tax reductions that will, I believe be</p>
<p>   seen as not only fair but also, to many people, generous, because</p>
<p>   we believe that some tax relief is desirable. But there are also</p>
<p>   other benefits that flow from a change to the system and I've</p>
<p>   already talked about the</p>
<p>   $15 billion that's been estimated as being slipping through</p>
<p>   the fingers, but Tim Fischer made the point last night that the</p>
<p>   present system penalises our exporters. I mean we tax inputs to</p>
<p>   exports. People make things in Australia to sell overseas, and they</p>
<p>   pay taxes on inputs and it's crazy.</p>
<p>LAWS:</p>
<p>You said, you said yesterday if we introduce a new broad based</p>
<p>   indirect tax you can rest assured whatever it's introduced</p>
<p>   at, it will stay at. But there are going to be people who are going</p>
<p>   to say "well that's like never ever.".</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well some people will criticise that. I accept that and it will</p>
<p>   be for the Australian public to make a judgement.</p>
<p>LAWS:</p>
<p>But you meant what you said, if it's introduced at 10% it</p>
<p>   will stay at 10%?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I'm not saying what the percent is........</p>
<p>LAWS:</p>
<p>No, no, I know.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>What I meant is that if it's introduced at X'%</p>
<p>   it will stay at X%. </p>
<p>LAWS:</p>
<p>Despite the fact that in 21 of 23 OECD countries that have got</p>
<p>   a GST, they've all risen?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I understand that, but I also understand....</p>
<p>LAWS:</p>
<p>Some of them have doubled.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, some of them have, but you've got to remember that in</p>
<p>   many of those countries they doubled. You know why? Because they</p>
<p>   were too narrowly based which of course is the problem with our</p>
<p>   existing wholesale tax system. I mean you've got some items</p>
<p>   under the present wholesale tax system, take a television set which</p>
<p>   is now a pretty standard item for the average family. I don't</p>
<p>   think anybody regards a television set as a luxury, that's</p>
<p>   32%. I mean, 32% is ridiculous.</p>
<p>LAWS:</p>
<p>And would that 32%.....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>That would disappear all together. I mean if you have a broad based</p>
<p>   indirect tax, what happens is that all of those big lumpy rates</p>
<p>   go, and you have a single rate.</p>
<p>LAWS:</p>
<p>I'm just looking here at the, this is interesting, the United</p>
<p>   Kingdom introduced one at 10%. It went to 17.5%. It's a pretty</p>
<p>   dramatic increase.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh yes, that's true and it's also true of course that</p>
<p>   they had a far more narrow base at the beginning. John, these are</p>
<p>   all things that people will make judgements on I'll answer</p>
<p>   it when rates are established and the details are out, these are</p>
<p>   things that we'll campaign on, talk about, and we'll be</p>
<p>   able to tell the public what we intend to do. And if they form a</p>
<p>   judgement that this is in the interests of their country and that</p>
<p>   it's fair, I believe they'll support it. Now, if they</p>
<p>   don't, well they won't, and in any democracy, I will accept</p>
<p>   the verdict of the public. I'm not holding anything back. I</p>
<p>   mean, I say again, I'm not going to the election saying, if</p>
<p>   you elect me I'll do X' and when I get re-elected</p>
<p>   I do the opposite of X'. Now, I'm not doing that.</p>
<p>   I'm going to the public telling them that we now believe that</p>
<p>   tax reform is in the long term national interest of Australia.</p>
<p>LAWS:</p>
<p>When will we get some detail on it?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Very soon. I can't tell you exactly when, but obviously...</p>
<p>LAWS:</p>
<p>You're working on it.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, Peter Costello and I have been working on it quite extensively</p>
<p>   and our other senior colleagues, and he's over in New York</p>
<p>   at the moment ringing the bell in Wall Street, and he'll be</p>
<p>   back shortly, and he and I will be having further discussions over</p>
<p>   the coming weeks. But we've done a lot of work, it's well</p>
<p>   advanced, it's very....</p>
<p>LAWS:</p>
<p>So are we talking about weeks or months?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I don't want to get into that. I mean, weeks merge into</p>
<p>   months and ...(inaudible) into weeks. I mean, two months is eight</p>
<p>   weeks. So John please, I don't, all I'm saying is that</p>
<p>   it is sooner rather than later.</p>
<p>LAWS:</p>
<p>I'm asking you for your sake, not for mine.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I realise that, look John, I just you know... sooner rather than</p>
<p>   later.</p>
<p>LAWS:</p>
<p>Okay, thank you very much for your time Prime Minister. I think</p>
<p>   you are in for a couple of rough days.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, John, politics is about being willing to do the right thing.</p>
<p>LAWS:</p>
<p>It should be.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I think it is right for Australia to have a better tax system</p>
<p>   and I am prepared to face the Australian people, to tell them openly</p>
<p>   what we intend to do. I don't intend to get re-elected, telling</p>
<p>   them one thing and doing the opposite immediately after I'm</p>
<p>   re-elected. They really get angry with that, and they have a right</p>
<p>   to be angry with that.</p>
<p>LAWS:</p>
<p>But Prime Minister, just back to it again. There are going to be</p>
<p>   those people who say well that's just what you've done.</p>
<p>   You were elected and you've told us there wouldn't be</p>
<p>   a GST and now there is one.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>But before there will be one, they will have an opportunity to</p>
