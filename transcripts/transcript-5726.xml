FOR MEDIA SATURDAY, 19 DECEMBER 1981<br />
MESSAGE BY THE PRIME MINISTER TO THE RALLY OF<br />
THE FEDERATION OF POLISH ORGANISATTONS IN VICTORIA<br />
You are meeting here today to express your justifiable<br />
indignation over the recent developments in Poland. I-lay I<br />
express at the outset my deep sympathy and understanding for<br />
all cf you who have relatives or friends in Poland. All<br />
Australians must share your grief at the suffering which the<br />
Polish nation is enduring now. Australia has been fortunate<br />
to have had the contribution made to our society by Polish<br />
immigrants you have made us a richer culture and a more<br />
diverse nation. Your distress and anxiety about what is happening<br />
can only be sharpened by the lack of communication between<br />
Poland and the outside world and the absence of any complete<br />
picture of events.<br />
The Australian Government condemns not only the original<br />
imposition of martial law in Poland, but also the violence with<br />
which it is increasingly being imposed. President Mitterand<br />
expressed the reactions of all free nations when he said:<br />
" Whether it be the result of the external pressure or internal<br />
oppression, the loss of public, collective and individual<br />
liberties is always to be condemned and must for that reason<br />
be clearly, vigorously and constantly denounced." I join in<br />
that denunciation.<br />
We condemn the curtailment of new-found freedoms enjoyed for<br />
such a short time. We are shocked to learn that this crack-down<br />
on freedoms is being accompanied by use of such force as is<br />
now leading to deaths, injury on a wide scale and jailings and<br />
internments of tens of thousands of pepole.<br />
We hear reports of brutal confrontation against innocent<br />
and unarmed people. We hear: cf faciory workers being beaten<br />
and shot. We are not sure of the whereabouts of Lech Walesa<br />
and the Polish authorities keep silence on this question of<br />
vital importance to Poland's well-being.<br />
The present violation of human rights in Poland is taking place<br />
on a major scale. It is not surprising that people in freedom--<br />
loving countries, including Australia, are raising their voices<br />
in protest. </p>
<p>-2<br />
Wie believe that this sort of violence can only breed an<br />
intensification of confrontation and further violence.<br />
The events of the past week have proved that Archbishop Glemp,<br />
the primate of Poland, spoke truly when he said that the<br />
authorities in Poland are not authorities of dialogue.<br />
There must be no outside interference or coercion whatsoever.<br />
This means, not only the thr ' eat of dir: ect intervention, but<br />
also the application of other kinds of pressure. The Governmaent<br />
would condemn the creation of any impression of outside interfer-ence.<br />
Only if they are left alone will the Pole., enjoy a free and<br />
peaceful society. But the Polish authorities must not now take<br />
a direction which puts that objective beyond reach.<br />
The Government is watching developments carefully and is paying<br />
close attention to what it can do to help the Polish people..<br />
We are acutely conscious of Poland's economic difficu. ties and<br />
thehardships and shortages being faced by the Polish people.<br />
Similarly, how we can help refugees from ' Poland is a matter of<br />
theutmost concern. Wie are discussing what may be possible with<br />
other Western Governments, especially Canada and the United<br />
States. May I repeat the Government's deepest concern abl-out the situation<br />
in Poland, and condemnation of the activities of the<br />
authorities. Responsible governments everywhere are looking to the Polish<br />
authorities to exercise restraint and responsibility so that<br />
the future of a free and stable Poland is assured.<br />
I understand your concerns and I share them. I will be<br />
watching the situation closely. We should all pray for peace<br />
in Poland and for the well-being of Yp~ Zrelatives and friends.<br />
000--.-</p>
