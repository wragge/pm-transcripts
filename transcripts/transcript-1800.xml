OPENING OF THE PHILIP MORRIS FACTORY<br />
MCORABBIN, VICTORIA March 1968<br />
Speech by the Prime Minister, Mr. John Gorton<br />
Thank you very much, Arthur. I say " Arthur" because it<br />
is true we have known each other for very many years, and indeed not<br />
closely, or he wouldn't be able to say with such conviction so many nice<br />
things, but intermittently and fairly closely during all that period of time.<br />
I am here to make a very brief speech and to declare open<br />
the factory and to declare open whatever It Is that is behind that curtain.<br />
( Laughter). I daresay that you, as I, are going to be quite Interested to<br />
see what it is the little bits that I can see look as if somebody round<br />
Sydney Harbour may be wondering what's happened to the Opera House.<br />
And if so we won't let them know where they are.<br />
It is quite true, Sir, as you said In the course of telling<br />
those assembled what it was that I'd said to myself, and in the course of<br />
doing that saying a number of things that I was otherwise going to say to<br />
them, that we do, as a Government, have a 42 per cent or 424 per cent<br />
Interest or whatever it is, I'll have to ask the Treasurer in the profits<br />
of this company. But, of course, that's not the whole story, Sir, as you<br />
know, because we also have an Interest in the dividends paid to the<br />
Individuals and the wages paid to the employees and all these other<br />
Incidental matters such as excise which helps the wheels of Government<br />
to go around. So it Is really quite important quite important to us, quite<br />
important to Australia, and we do see here, I think, an example of growth<br />
but not only an example of growth, an example of growth made In the way<br />
in which we in Australia would wish it to be made. Because here is an<br />
example of development as a result of the inflow of overseas capital which<br />
we need If we are to develop as quickly as we must. But also an example<br />
where an inflow of that overseas capital married itself with Australian<br />
capital so that a third of the capital Is owned by Australians and the benefits<br />
that flow from It go to those equity holders as well.<br />
And this Is an ideal situation. Well it might be nicer if It<br />
was 50 per cent, but still it's a good situation that here comes the<br />
requirements for development, here is an example where Australians can<br />
take part in that development, here is an example where jobs flow from it,<br />
employment flows from it, dividends flow from it and all the other things<br />
of which I have spoken.<br />
And we, I think, can be a little proud or we can be proud<br />
of the achievements of others when we realise, as I am told is a fact,<br />
that this new extension is the most modern tobacco factory if that's<br />
the word, tobacco packing plant in the world bar none. Now, this Is<br />
really something, and I am Informed that this Is In fact so. I can't tell<br />
you how many million cigarettes a month it can make because I'm not<br />
allowed to, but it's an enormous number of cigarettes.<br />
When you come to think of it, of course, I suppose the<br />
credit for all this really goes back to some completely unknown American<br />
Red Indian, because you remember that's where they first discovered<br />
tobacco and that's where Raleigh got It from. You may remember somebody<br />
threw a pall of water over him when he first started to smoke because they<br />
/ 2 </p>
<p>thought he was on fire when he got back to England and If he had really<br />
put Raleigh out with that pail of water, there would not have been a tobacco<br />
factory and there wouldn't have been the interest that we've got here.<br />
But can I say this as well. That not only do the things of<br />
which I have spoken become evident here financially, and to assist in a<br />
secondary industry employment but they stem down the line too, to create,<br />
or help to create, help to expand a primary Industry in Australia because<br />
the tobacco-growing industry benefits too from what Is happening here and<br />
will benefit, of course, from the five-year extension of the tobacco<br />
stabilisation plan which has just been announced and with the additional<br />
quotas for Australian tobacco leaf which will be going up to 284 million<br />
pounds. Now, these things one stands on a platform and talks about<br />
but in one's mind, and In your mind, think of the people on the banks, the<br />
red shore banks of the Murray, or wherever It may be, In small farms<br />
wresting a living from that land and being helped to prosper and to grow<br />
by the kind of secondary expansion we see here. The whole of Australia<br />
benefits from it. That I think, Sir, Is all that I should say. I do congratulate<br />
all concerned with the development of this factory. I know what was It<br />
you had when you started was it 3. 4 million capital somewhere around<br />
3.4. million capital, of which one-third is American. I'm not quite sure<br />
what's happened since but I think there's been a bonus Issue and I'm not<br />
sure there hasn't been a split and this again points up the benefit of having<br />
an Australian equity interest in a factory of that kind $ 11 million<br />
today. Wlell, I do hope that before very long I will be able to, at your<br />
request, come and open another extension and you will be able to say<br />
million today because I'll know that that growth is partly a growth for<br />
Australians as well as abroad. </p>
