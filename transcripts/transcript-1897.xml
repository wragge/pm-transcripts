FOR PRESS: JL16 P. M. No. 69/ 1968<br />
ECONOMIC CONSULTAT IONS<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, Mr. John Gorton<br />
The Government began its series of pre-Budget consultations<br />
in Canberra today. The first day's discussions were with national organisations<br />
representing primary industries, manufacturing industries and commerce.<br />
Instead of holding these talks jointly as in previous years, the Government<br />
today saw these organisations in three separate groups.<br />
We had decided that there would be mutual advantage in<br />
having separate meetings, and the new arrangements proved satisfactory.<br />
The talks were worthwhile in providing Ministers with an up-to-date<br />
appreciation of the views of those directly involved in commerce and industry.<br />
The series of pre-Budget consultations will continue tomorrow<br />
when Ministers will hold separate discussions with representatives of the<br />
Manufacturing Industries' Advisory Council, the Export Development Council<br />
and the Australian Council of Trade Unions.<br />
Attached is a list of those taking part in today's talks.<br />
