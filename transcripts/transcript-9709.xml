PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
DOORSTOP, BRISBANE GIRLS' GRAMMAR SCHOOL, BRISBANE,<br />
AUGUST 1995<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
J: Prime Minister what is your reaction to the Japanese Prime Minister's<br />
statement?<br />
PM: It is quite a comprehensive one where he says that Japan eschews<br />
nationalism, where he says that their policy was a mistaken one and<br />
where he wants to embrace the principles of peace and prosperity.<br />
It is a fairly comprehensive apology. It admits the mistaken policy of<br />
the past. He sympathises with the damage that this has caused to<br />
other peoples and I think most of the opponents of Japan during the<br />
Second World War would be satisfied that a genuine sentiment has<br />
been expressed by Prime Minister Murayama.<br />
J: Has he got backing from the whole Japanese Government, do you<br />
believe?<br />
PM: Well he is the Prime Minister and he said it on behalf of the Japanese<br />
nation.<br />
