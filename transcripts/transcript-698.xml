NATIONAL LIBRARY OF AUSTRALIA<br />
PLANS FOR NHE BUILDING<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister. the RtHon, R. G. Menzies<br />
The Prime Minister, Mr. Menzies, announced today<br />
that the National Capital Development Commission had begun<br />
the preparation of working drawings for the new National<br />
Library of Australia which is to stand in the Parliamentary<br />
Triangle, Canberra. The Commission had completed the outline design<br />
of the building. A model had been prepared and would be<br />
placed on public display next month, The model, together with<br />
illustrations of other major National Capital projects, would<br />
be shown to the Queen and Prince Philip on March 11. After<br />
this the exhibition containing the model would be open to the<br />
public. The Prime Minister said the Development Commission<br />
would complete the working drawings towards the end of the year.<br />
Mr, Menzies said that the National Library of<br />
Australia had already grown into an institution of major<br />
national importance in the period since Federation. Under the<br />
National Library Act of 1960, it had been given wide functions<br />
on behalf of the Commonwealth in assembling and organising a<br />
national collection of library material of all kinds and making<br />
it available to persons and institutions in ways which would<br />
best further the national interest. Ho said that the National<br />
Library had special responsibilities for services to the<br />
Parliament, the Departments of the Conmonwealth Government and<br />
to the Commonwealth Territories, and played an important part,<br />
as the National Bibliographical Centre, in the closest co-operation<br />
with the State Libraries and other major libraries and<br />
institutions both in Australia and overseas.<br />
Mr. Menzies said the outline design for the first<br />
stage of the library was for a building of five storoys above<br />
a two-level basement. The facade featured a grouping of<br />
light slender columnso The whole concept was one of extreme<br />
simplicity and flexibility to allow for future growth.<br />
The building was being designed to hold 1,250,000<br />
books. It would house the present National Library collection<br />
and expected acquisitions until the 1970' s.<br />
Consultant architects to the Commission for the<br />
project were Bunning and Madden in association with Mr, T. E.<br />
0 Ma honey. Mr. Menzies said the outline design for the Library<br />
had been approved by the National Library Council, the National<br />
Capital Planning Committee and finally by Cabinet. He said<br />
the Library site was on the southern foreshore of Lake Burley<br />
Griffin. The whole project was one of the most important<br />
National Capital features yet undertaken in Canberra.<br />
