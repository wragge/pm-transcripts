CIVIC REGiEPTION. AL3AN," v. A. 11TH OCTOBER, -196+<br />
S~ ehb h Prime Ministero the nt. Hon. Sir Robert Menzies<br />
Mr. Mayor, Your Excellency, Parliamentary Colleagues and<br />
Ladies and Gentlemen You have just been reminded that this afternoon<br />
in another place I have to make a speech about the Memorial,<br />
so I won't make it now. I will only hope to make it then<br />
properly. But I do want to thank you, Sir. This is, T<br />
think, the second occasion on which I have given tongue in<br />
this hall. The first tirrn3 I was on a political errand<br />
you are quite right, in 1948. 1 must have had a very rich<br />
supporter or two in i'lest Australia at that time because he<br />
chartered a plane and this was a humble means of getting me<br />
to make about ten times as many speeches as I otherwise would<br />
have made, and one of them was hiere, and I always remember<br />
that as we flew in, we seemed to just dodge over the hump<br />
of the hill and core down on the lunway. It looked frightfully<br />
close, and my Press Secretary at that time said, holding a<br />
piece of paper out to me, " Any famous last words that I can<br />
throw out?" ( Laughter) No doubt, a lot has happened since<br />
then and I am still here.<br />
Sir, the one tViing T would like to say in your<br />
Town Hail and in the presence of yourself as ' Mayor is that I<br />
always get a certain amount of " kick", in the homely phrase,<br />
outiofs tin a enre of municipal government. I'm rnot<br />
just saying that. I say this for the most, I think, profoundly<br />
important reasons. In Australia we are accustomed to local go-vernment7<br />
to voluntary associations of various kinds. to<br />
State Parliaments and Governments to a Coimonwealth Parliament<br />
and Government, and this distribution of the activities of<br />
government is really one of the reasons whiy we have never run<br />
any serious risk in Australia of comding under the grip of a<br />
dictatorship. Government has grown properly from the grass<br />
roots and this, I think, is tremendously important.<br />
I have thought it more and more important in<br />
recent years when I have observed, as you have, how many new<br />
countries have been brought into existence masses of them<br />
in Africa, a number of them in Asia new countries with<br />
newly-won independence and too many people in the western<br />
world have been under Zhe impression that all you have to do<br />
is to give them a constitution, give them the means of electing<br />
a parliament and then kiss them goodbye and say, " Now, you<br />
are a democracy." This, of course, is all nonsense,<br />
Democracy can't be built from the top down.<br />
Democracy has to be built from the bottom up, and the reason<br />
why so many of these now countries have become, in reality,<br />
dictatorships with no parliamentary oppositions with no<br />
opponents worth talking about to the powers-that-be the reason<br />
is that these countries started at the wrong end. If they had<br />
begun by having local councils just as the Parliament in Great<br />
Britain began with the hundreds, the moots, under the spreading<br />
oak tree and gradually developed into some form of national<br />
representational body, so in Australia we have had, with all<br />
the benefit of history behind it, the same kind of experience. / 2 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
We are trying to do this with countries for which we<br />
are responsible, i am interested to see my valued colleague,<br />
Mr. Hasluck here today, because for many years he was the<br />
Minister for Territories, and he seeing this with his usual<br />
clarity, decided that the place to start in was the village,<br />
to establish what you might call a sort of shire or local council,<br />
in which the indigenous people could take a hand, and in which<br />
they could learn some of the arts of government. Therefore,<br />
I come back to where I began by saying that I like to be, every<br />
now and then, associated with a municipal body because I know<br />
that this is, foundationally, the beginning of the structure of<br />
self-government and therefore a very precious heritage that<br />
we have. I suppose I ought to think like this because the<br />
first time I ever heard about politics was in a little village<br />
in the bush in Victoria where my father happened to be a shire<br />
councillor, and the shire councillor from the North Riding used<br />
to come down twenty miles and then my father would hop into a<br />
buggy with him and go another twenty miles to attend the meeting<br />
of the Council of the Shire of Dimboola. I must confess that<br />
in those early days I rather thought that a Riding was something<br />
that people had to ride to. It seemed like it in those days<br />
before motor cars.<br />
And so i began to hear about self-government and<br />
then about state government because I was in there myself, and<br />
now about CommonwJ-ealth Government. Every bit of this experience<br />
accumulates, do you see. It accunulates so that we can finally<br />
look around our o~-n country and say we have a solid s+ ructure<br />
and no crazy fool can destroy it. This is fiimly based on<br />
representative government all the way through. This issomething<br />
to be thankful for? something to be proud of. My only regret<br />
is that so many of the new countries will have to learn by<br />
painful experience what we have been able to acquire by long<br />
practice and by some inherited talent for this kind of thing.<br />
No. r, Sir, I know there is a little matter of food and<br />
drink, I know then I am whisked off like my wife who, like me,<br />
is delighted to be here because it is her first visit. I have<br />
t-en interested in a variety of things. She has been looking<br />
at wildflowers all the time. Anybody who has a view to put on<br />
any of these wildflowers, please come up and give her the<br />
right drill, and after that we will go up on to the hill where<br />
I have been solemnly warned the wind is so strong that it rill<br />
be a physical impossibility to unveil anything. ( Laughter) But<br />
we will do our best. Thank you very much.<br />
