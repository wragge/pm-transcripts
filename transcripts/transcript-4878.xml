INTERVIEW WITH THE PRIME MINISTER FOR 3 NOVEMBER 1978<br />
QUESTION: Does this mean that the Government is prepared to<br />
legislate to force the funds to provide/ cover for chronically<br />
ill patients if need be? full<br />
PRIME MINISTER: At the moment it doesn't mean any more<br />
than I have indicated there. I had quite a long talk with<br />
Ralph Hunt this morning and he has been very concerned about it.<br />
We were both concerned that chronically ill people should be<br />
fully protected. The way to go about it, is that he is<br />
preparing a report for Cabinet so that we can discuss it at<br />
the earliest opportunity. We will have to see where we go<br />
from there.<br />
QUESTION: You have said, as you say, that you are determined that<br />
the chronically ill will be protected. Will this be by the<br />
private funds?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Let me just not go beyond, at the moment, that<br />
plain statement that the chronically ill will be protected.<br />
QUESTION: There have been suggestions, Prime Minister, thatthe<br />
Government might take over responsibility for the bill s of the<br />
chronically ill. Would you see that then as an option at<br />
this stage?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I think that if funds are insuring somebody<br />
for a long while, and they become chronically ill, or have<br />
preexisting illnesses, that there is an obligation for the<br />
funds, at one sense, to take the good with the bad. I think the<br />
Government would be approaching it from that basis.<br />
QUESTION: Does the whole situation show up quite a major mistake<br />
in the Government's new guidelines?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No, not at. all, not at all.<br />
The whd1e purpose of health insurance is to protect people when<br />
they are sick you don't need protection when you are well, when<br />
you are fit and young perhaps, but when you do become sick<br />
you need protection. If you become chronically sick you need<br />
that protection even more.<br />
QUESTION: Yet, up to this point in time, the funds haven't<br />
imposed these sorts of restrictions.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: That is exactly it. I really can't go beyond<br />
this at the moment. The Minister is reporting to the<br />
Government on the matter, Cabinet will be discussing it, and<br />
both the Minister and myself are determined that those who need<br />
protection, will be protected. Can we leave it at that, and we<br />
will see what comes out of our examination.<br />
