FOR MEDIA 18 JULY 1990<br />
I have sent the following message to President Aquino:<br />
" On behalf of the Australian Government and people, I<br />
should like to convey our profound sympathy for the heavy<br />
loss of life and damage to property caused by the severe<br />
earthquake that hit the Philippines on 16 July.<br />
Australia stands ready to assist those who have suffered<br />
in this disaster.<br />
All Australians hope that the process of reconstruction<br />
can be completed as soon as possible and that those who<br />
have been affected by this tragedy can quickly resume<br />
their normal lives.<br />
Bob Hawke" </p>
