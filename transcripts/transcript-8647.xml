PRIME MINISTER 95/ 9<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON PJ. KEATING MP<br />
AMBASSADOR FOR THE ENVIRONMENT<br />
Australia's first Ambassador for the Environment. Sir Ninian Stephen, is to retire<br />
from the post.<br />
Sir Ninian, who has been Ambassador for the Environment since July 1989,<br />
recently informed the Government that his responsibilities as Chairman o. lStrand 2<br />
of the Talks on Northern Ireland were now absorbing his time and capacities to<br />
such an extent that he believed it was no longer practicable for him to continue to<br />
hold the important post of Ambassador for the Environmcnt.<br />
In 1991, the Government agreed to a joint request from the Governments of the UK<br />
and of Ireland that Sir Ninian chair Strand 2 of the Northern Ireland Talks. In May<br />
this year Sir Ninian was granted leave of absence from his duties as Ambassador<br />
for the Environment for the duration of the Talks. In August Sir Ninian returned to<br />
Australia for consultations and the Government accepted Sir Ninian's view that it<br />
would be preferable for him to relinquish his role as Ambassador for the<br />
Environmcnt and for new arrangements to be made, consistent with the high<br />
importance the Government attaches to the environment.<br />
The Prime Minister paid tribute to Sir Ninian's significant contribution as<br />
Ambassador for the Environment. He said that Sir Ninian had carried out his<br />
responsibilities with great distinction, both overseas and in Australia. Sir Ninian<br />
had worked assiduously, consistent with the mandate given to him by the<br />
Government, to promote, both within and beyond Australia, the Government's </p>

2<br />
policies relating to matters affecting the global environment. He had represented<br />
the Government in bilateral and multilateral conferences and negotiationq relating<br />
to the global environment, including leading Australian delegations to the<br />
preparatory conferences which preceded the June 1992 UN Conference on the<br />
_ Environment and pcevel~ me~ it ( UNCED).<br />
Sir Ninian believes and the Government agrees, that he has fulfilled his role as<br />
Australia's first Ambassador for the Environment and it is now time to hand over to<br />
others who are, and will continue to be, actively involved in the long and<br />
dcmanding follow up to UNCED.<br />
The Government has recommended the apj'ointmcnt of a senior career diplomat,<br />
Ms Pennv Wensley, to succeed Sir Ninian.<br />
Ms Wensley, who joined the then Department of External Affairs in 1 968, is<br />
currcntly head of the Intcrnational Organisations and Legal Division of the<br />
Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and has spent the past two years working<br />
on global environment issucs. She was leader of the Australian delegation to the<br />
Inter-GovernmentalI Negotiating Committee ( INC) which negotiated the landmark<br />
Framework Convention on Climate Change and participated in the Australian<br />
delegation to the UNCED conference as Senior Forcign Affairs Adviser. Ms<br />
Wensley is well known to community and business groups with an interest in<br />
environment issues.<br />
It is proposed that Ms Wensley be appointed as Australia's Ambassador and<br />
Permanent Representative to the United Nations in Geneva in early 1993 where she<br />
will be particularly well placed to carry out the principal functions of Ambassador<br />
for the Environment of promoting Australia's policies on global environment issues<br />
and representing the Government at international conferences and negotiations<br />
relating to the environment, Many institutions and agencies handling thc rapidly<br />
growing international agenda on the environment are based in or nLear Geneva and<br />
a considerable proportion of the follow up work to UNCED will be handled by<br />
Australia's Mission in Geneva.<br />
Ms Wensley will return to Australia as appropriate to brief the Government and<br />
interest groups on global environment developments.<br />
The Prime Minister said that an important function carried out by Sir Ninian had<br />
been that of liaison between the Commonwealth and non-governmental<br />
organisations. The Government attached the highest importance to maintaining an<br />
effective dialogue with intercst groups in this area, Accordingly, the Government<br />
plans to establish new and enhanced formal arrangements for liaison with NGOs </p>
<p>TEL: 3<br />
on international environment matters. These new consultative arrangements will<br />
be determined on the basis of full discussion with all interested groups.<br />
In announcing these changes, the Prime Minister reaffirmed the Government's<br />
strong commitment to the environment. Hc said that Australia has established a<br />
reputation internationally as a country committed to progressive and forwardlooking<br />
environmental policies and ready to play its part in international efforts to<br />
address environmental problems and concerns. The Ambassador for the<br />
Environment has an important role to play in securing this image and in promoting<br />
Australia's interests in ongoing international efforts to develop and implement<br />
effective environment policies and strategies. The new consultative arrangements<br />
will ensure the views of the community will be well represented.<br />
