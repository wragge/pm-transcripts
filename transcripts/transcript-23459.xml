    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Commonwealth Government welcomes the opening of the National Disability Insurance Agency headquarters in Geelong.</p>
<p>The Government is fully committed to the successful rollout of the National Disability Insurance Scheme and today is a significant milestone in its development.</p>
<p>The refurbished office at Level 1, 43-45 Brougham Street, Geelong will be the national headquarters of the NDIA as it implements the Scheme.</p>
<p>The NDIS is currently operating in four trial sites and has helped more than 2,500 people with disability and their families by funding individualised support plans.</p>
<p>From 1 July this year thousands more Australians living with disability will be supported when trial sites commence across the ACT, in the Barkly region of the Northern Territory and in the Perth Hills area of WA.</p>
<p>The Agencyâ€™s move from Canberra to Geelong will provide an important economic boost to the local region and deliver new opportunities for the local workforce.</p>
<p>The new headquarters will employ more than 100 further staff across a diverse range of fields, including allied health, finance, community engagement and administration.</p>
<p>This is in addition to the 120 staff already employed by the Barwon NDIS trial site.</p>
