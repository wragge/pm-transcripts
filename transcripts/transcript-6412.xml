FOR MEDIAJune 19 1984<br />
I am deeply saddened to learn of the death of<br />
Sir Phillip Lynch.<br />
My personal sympathies and those of the Government<br />
are extended to his widow, Lady Lynch, and to his<br />
family.<br />
Sir Phillip's career was marked by his commitment to the<br />
Liberal Party and through it he made 6 rihajor contribution.<br />
to Australian political life.<br />
His long service in a range of ministries was marked<br />
by a great sense of purpose and a commitment to<br />
advance what he believed were the interests of all<br />
Australians. </p>
