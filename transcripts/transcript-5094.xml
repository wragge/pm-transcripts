FOR MEDIA TUESDAY, 3 JULY 1979_<br />
RETIREMENT OF SIR CLARRIE HARDERS<br />
On the retirement of Sir Clarrie Harders as Permanent Head<br />
of the Attorney-General's Department announced by the<br />
Attorney today, I want to add my personal tribute to<br />
Sir Clarrie for his many years of public service.<br />
Sir Clarrie has earned the respect of successive<br />
Attorneys and successive Governments both because of his<br />
professional advising and administrative capacities and<br />
because of his dedication.<br />
Sir Clarrie has made a particular contribution over the<br />
years in the fields of international law and law of<br />
the sea. Most recently the Government has appreciated<br />
his contribution in the development on an agreement with<br />
the States on matters of off-shore jurisdiction.<br />
