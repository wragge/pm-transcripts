    <content><![CDATA[<p>
I congratulate former Prime Minister John Howard on his appointment as a member of the Order of Merit.</p>
<p>This high honour recognises Mr Howard's distinguished public service over many decades.</p>
<p>As our second longest serving Prime Minister and a parliamentarian of 33 years, Mr Howard devoted his life to Australia.</p>
<p>He led our nation through many difficult days including our grieving after the Port Arthur massacre, 9/11 and the Bali bombings. He led our nation through times of widespread and complex economic and social change.</p>
<p>While Australians will inevitably have a variety of views about the record of the Howard Government, Mr Howard rightly commands ongoing respect for his contribution to the nation.</p>
<p>Appointments to the Order of Merit are the gift of The Queen.</p>
<p>Mr Howard now joins a small number of distinguished Australians to receive this honour, including  Sir Macfarlane Burnett, Lord Florey, Sir Sidney Nolan,  Dame Joan Sutherland and Lord May of Oxford.</p>
