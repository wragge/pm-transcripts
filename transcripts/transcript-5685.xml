PRIME MRAINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA MONDAY, 9 NOVEMBER 1981<br />
SPEECH AT COMMISSIONING OF<br />
G. M. H. ENGINE PLANT, FISHERMAN'S BEND<br />
I am very pleased to be here today for the commissioning of<br />
this new G. M. H. engine plant.<br />
The plant represents a significant investment in the future<br />
of Australia. It surely reflects confidence in the stability<br />
and the~ economic prospects of this country. For six years,<br />
the Government has worked consistently to encourage this<br />
kind of confidence, to help create the conditions in which<br />
productive and profitable investment will take place in<br />
Australia on the scale required and I believe that the level<br />
of investment that is now occurring, as evidenced by a great<br />
engine plant such as this, helps confirm that our policy<br />
approach has been right. I<br />
The construction of this plant was obviously closely linked<br />
with the Government's decision in 1979 to introduce export<br />
facilitation measures. In making that decision, the<br />
Government recognized the desirability of the Australian<br />
automotive,-industry becoming more integrated with the world<br />
industry, thus contributing to the viability and competitiveness<br />
of the industry, especially in the longer term and enabling<br />
Australia to keep abreast of technological advances,<br />
especially in connection with the development of high quality<br />
fuel efficient vehicles.<br />
Obviously a four cylinder engine plant on anything like this<br />
scale would have been unthinkable only a few years ago and<br />
the situation in which, as I am advised, two-thirds of an<br />
expected annual production of 300; 000 engines will be exported<br />
to General Motors plants overseas wou~ ld have been equally<br />
unthinkable. Such exports will increase production runs and.<br />
help achieve really significant economics of scale in production.<br />
They can help to counter the problem of the relatively smal.<br />
Australian domestic market. This response by G. M. towards<br />
the increasing international integration of automobile<br />
production will no doubt assist in improving the firm's cost:<br />
structure. / 2 </p>
<p>The acceptance of the "' world car' concept is clearly<br />
significant in terms of the Australian industry becoming<br />
more outward looking and G. M. H.' s involvement in the<br />
production of s " J"-car, is to be commended.<br />
In this industry in particular, co-operation at every level<br />
of the productive process is essential especially in achieving<br />
reliability of production and quality-in the products.<br />
Management has a responsibility to marshal technology,<br />
organise productivity and maximise marketing opportunities.<br />
The workforce has the crucial responsibility for the standards<br />
of workmanship which enable the manufactured products to<br />
stand against those of other countries in meeting the<br />
requirements of consumers. Australian goods can and do meet<br />
this test in very many fields indeed. Australian workmanship<br />
and Australian management are the equal of any in the world.<br />
I believe that Australians should work together so that<br />
" made in Australia" will become more and more synonymous<br />
with high quality workmanship and good design in all areas<br />
of industry. If people can work together in pursuit of that<br />
aim, then a great deal will already have been done to meet<br />
the challenge of improving Australian living standards.<br />
In the motor vehicle industry, Australian management and labour<br />
have combined to produce higher quality cars than ever<br />
before in the history of the industry. I believe that consumers<br />
are becoming increasingly aware of this and no doubt the<br />
motor industry itself will want to do everything in its<br />
power to keep improving the quality of Australian made cars<br />
and thus strengthen this turnaround in opinion.<br />
It is not so many years since the label " fully imported"<br />
was regarded by many Australians as almost sufficient<br />
recommendation for a product and I cannot say how pleased<br />
I am that-Australians have broken down that myth by<br />
imprbving our own products.<br />
I cannot emphasise too strongly that while Government<br />
policies, both in this and other countries, obviously have'<br />
very significant effects onf manufacturing industry, the<br />
underlying key to whether products will sell is their<br />
quality, their desirability in the eye of the consumer,<br />
and whether they are good value for money. Every manufacturer<br />
knows this, every manager knows-it, every worker knows i; t,<br />
and I really believe we must bring it more and more to the<br />
forefront of our minds as a nation when we are thinking<br />
about what we must do to keep increasinq our living standards.<br />
A healthy, growing economy is the only road to increasing<br />
prosperity. No cloud must ever be allowed to blot out<br />
or blur our awareness of that fact. And a healthy, growing<br />
economy has to depend on how well our goods and products<br />
compete in the market place. I ., 3 </p>
<p>3-<br />
I have referred to the impact of government policies in<br />
this process and the Government's policies towards<br />
protection of industries are currently gaining particular<br />
attention. Questions about protection have seldom been<br />
easy to resolve in Australia and the decision which the<br />
Government now faces in relation to the I. A. C. report on the<br />
motor vehicles industry is particularly difficult. One<br />
thing that the people who are so concerned about this<br />
issue really ought to realise is that it would be<br />
inconceivable that this Government, having worked so hard<br />
and so consistently for six years to create the conditions<br />
under which the manufacturing sector has been built up,<br />
would now take actions to destroy this.<br />
Protectionism and protection levels are issues of vast<br />
importance to the long and short term future of Australia<br />
and it would be quite wrong for the Government to be rushed<br />
into decisions before all the factors and all the<br />
possibilities have been properly weighed up.<br />
How much better it would be if we could look at these issues<br />
with a constructive spirit on all sides so that the views and<br />
interests of everyone affected can be properly considered<br />
so that a proper balance can be achieved between the interests<br />
of people working and investing in the industry on<br />
the one hand, and consumers on the other,<br />
and so that we can make sure that as a result of the decisions<br />
we take, we will be * pursuing the right objectives in the<br />
right way. And having said that, I also wAnt to say that<br />
so far as the Government is concerned, two fundamental<br />
points on which all the discussions which are to take place<br />
must be premised are an awareness of the reliance of<br />
thousands of Australian families on the industries involved<br />
and the fact that a strong and internationally competitive<br />
manufacturing sector is essential to Australia's future.<br />
The Government's objective of increasing the international<br />
competitiveness of Australian industry is well-known and<br />
so is the fact that gradualism and predictability have<br />
been key elements in our strategy on protection. It is<br />
this Government which has recognised that when change is<br />
desirable, industry and the community together need clear<br />
guidance on the framework within which the changes are to<br />
take place as well as time and incentives to adapt.<br />
I do not want to talk at length today-' about this issue, vital<br />
as it is. But I would just say that this Government has<br />
shown that it has a capacity and a determination to make<br />
the kinds of decisions on these difficult issues that steer<br />
the balanced course in the interests of all sections of<br />
the Australian community. So against that background, let<br />
me come back to this magnificent engine plant and I just want<br />
to say that it must be seen as a tremendous development in<br />
this industry and that I speak for millions of Australians<br />
when I say that I hope and believe it will be most successful<br />
in an operational sense.<br />
It gives me great pleasure to perform the commissioning cerEmony. </p>
