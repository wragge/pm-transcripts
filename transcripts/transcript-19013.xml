    <content><![CDATA[<p>Parliament House, Canberra</p>
<p>PM: Thank you very much.</p>
<p>Over the past half century we've learnt to celebrate our national day in a very special way: by singling out some of our fellow citizens who absolutely embody the best of what it means to be Australian.</p>
<p>Tonight four names will be added to the roll of honour as Australians of the Year: a roll of men and women who collectively tell our nation's story.</p>
<p>Some of the Australians of the Year can trace their connection with this land back countless centuries, like the Yunupingu brothers, Neville Bonner and Mick Dodson.</p>
<p>Others, like Fred Hollows, Gus Nossal and John Yu, were born elsewhere.</p>
<p>But all of them, every Australian of the Year, has helped shape our nation.</p>
<p>They've helped made a nation of men and women who take on the world's greatest medical and scientific challenges; a nation that excels brilliantly in the sports and the arts; who extends a hand of healing and friendship to those doing it tough.</p>
<p>The men and women we honour are our tall poppies, who have grown high in achievement and stature under our very bright southern skies.</p>
<p>Through the Australian of the Year awards, we don't cut them down, we lift them up; honouring in them all that is best about our nation, our values and ourselves.</p>
<p>I warmly congratulate the 2013 Australian of the Year award winners and commend them to the nation; a nation they've done so much to enrich and so much to serve.</p>
