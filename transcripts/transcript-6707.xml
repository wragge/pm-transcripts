PRIME MINISTER<br />
CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY<br />
OPENING OF THE RSL NATIONAL CONGRESS CANBERRA<br />
2 SEPTEMBER 1985<br />
DISTINGUISHE D GUESTS, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,<br />
I AM DELIGHTED. TO HAVE BEEN ABLE TO ACCEPT YOUR<br />
INVITATION TO ADDRESS THIS NATIONAL CONGRESS OF THE<br />
RETURNED SERVICES LEAGUE.<br />
SINCE COMING TO OFFICE TWO ALID A HALF YEARS AGO THERE<br />
HAS BEEN EXTENSIVE CONTACT BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT AND<br />
THE LEAGUE WITH RESULTS WHICH I BELI EVE HAVE BEEN VERY<br />
BENEFICIAL TO BOTH SIDES. IT IS TIMELY NOW TO REVIEW<br />
WHERE WE S'AAND ON THE 14AJOR ISSUES CONCERNING US.<br />
AUSTRALIAN VETERANS HAVE OVER THE YEARS MADE A<br />
MAGNIFICENT CONTRIBUTION TO AUSTRALIAN SOCIETY THROUGH<br />
NOT ONLY THE DEFENCE OF ITS BOUNDARIES AND ITS PEOPLE<br />
BUT THROUGH THEIR CONTRIBUTION TO THE RESOLUTION OF<br />
CONFLICT IN MANY OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD. OUR VETERANS<br />
HAVE FOUGHT FOR DEMOCRACY, FOR FREEDOM AN4D FOR THE<br />
FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS OF NATIONS AND INDIVIDUALS. OUR<br />
VETERANS KNOW THE HORROR AND WASTE OF WAR; THEY ALSO<br />
KNOW THE NEED FOR A JUST AND HONOURABLE PEACE AROUND THE<br />
WORLD. THEIR CONTRIBUTION TO THAT PEACE IS SOMETHING OF<br />
WHICH ALL AUSTRALIAN'S ARE JUSTIFIABLY PROUD.<br />
AUSTRALIA'S CONTRIBUTION TO THE CAUSE OF PEACE HAS BEEN<br />
OUT OF PROPORTION TO ITS POPULATION AND ITS RESOURCES.<br />
I SOMETIMES WONDER H-OW OUR COUNTRY WOULD HAVE PROGRESSED<br />
IF WE HAD NOT PROVIDED SO MANY YOUNG MEN BETWEEN 1914<br />
AND 1918 IN THE FIRST WORLD WAR. AUSTRALIA LOST MORE<br />
MEN IN THAT WAR THAN THE UNITED STATES AT A TIME WHEN WE<br />
WERE BUILDING OUR NATION. THE LOSS OF G5,000 MEN WAS AN<br />
EXTRAORDINARY SACRIFICE IN A NATION OF UNDER 5 MILLION<br />
PEOPLE.<br />
THERE ARE NOW ONLY 6,000 FIRST WORLD WAR DIGGERS ALIVE.<br />
THE LABOR GOVERNMENT WAS VERY PLEASED TO BE ABLE To SEND<br />
EIGHT OF THEM TO THE CEREMONIES TO MARK THE<br />
ANNIVERSARY OF THE ORIGINAL ANZAC DAY AND, LIKE YOU, I </p>
<p>WAS PROUD OF THE DIGNIFIED WAY IN WHICH THEY AND THEIR<br />
ONE-TIME TURKISH ADVERSARIES MET AFTER SO MANY YEARS.<br />
SIMILARLY, MANY OF OUR BEST MEN WERE KILLED IN WORLD WAR<br />
II WHEN WE AGAIN SUFFERED GREAT LOSSES TO THE CAPACITY<br />
OF THE NATION. THE SUBSEQUENT LOSSES IN BOTH THE KOREAN<br />
AND VIETNAM WARS POSED STILL FURTHER STRAIN ON OUR<br />
PRECIOUS AND NECESSARILY LIMITED HUMAN RESOURCES.<br />
THESE LOSSES SHOULD NEVER BE FORGOTTEN. SIMILARLY THOSE<br />
WHO SUFFERED INJURIES OR DISABILITIES IN THE PURSUIT OF<br />
PEACE SHOULD BE ACCORDED DUE RECOGNITION.<br />
THE LABOR GOVERNMENT FIRMLY BELIEVES THAT WE SHOULD BE<br />
GENEROUS IN OUR TREATMENT TO THOSE WHO HAVE SUFFERED<br />
DISABILITIES BECAUSE OF THEIR PARTICIPATION IN WAR AND<br />
IN THE TREATMENT OF THE WIDOWS AND ORPHANS OF THOSE WHO<br />
HAVE DIED AS A RESULT OF WAR SERVICE.<br />
I KNOW THAT SOME OF YOU MAY BELIEVE THAT MEASURES WE<br />
HAVE TAKEN, AS ANNOUNCED IN THE 14 MAY ECONOMIC<br />
STATEMENT, WERE NOT CONSISTENT WITH THAT OBJECTIVE.<br />
I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT TO BE SO. WHAT THE GOVERNMENT HAS<br />
TRIED TO DO IS TO ENSURE THAT ANYONE WHO IS DISABLED AS<br />
A RESULT OF WAR SERVICE WILL HAVE HIS OR HER CLAIM-FOR<br />
DISABILITY PENSION ACCEPTED WITH A MINIMUM OF FORMALITY<br />
AND DELAY AND BE PROVIDED WITH THE BEST POSSIBLE<br />
TREATMENT AND OTHER SERVICES. THIS GOES ALSO FOR WAR<br />
WIDOWS. AT THE SAME TIME WE WOULD HAVE BEEN IRRESPONSIBLE IF WE<br />
HAD ALLOWED A SITUATION TO CONTINUE WHERE PENSIONS WERE<br />
BEING PAID VIRTUALLY TO ANYONE WHO CAME FORWARD TO LODGE<br />
A CLAIM SIMPLY ON THE BASIS THAT THEY WERE VETERANS OR<br />
THE WIDOWS OF VETERANS. THE END RESULT OF LETTING SUCH<br />
A SITUATION CONTrINUE IS THAT THERE IS LESS MONEY<br />
AVAILABLE FOR PROVIDING HIGH QUALITY SERVICES AND<br />
TREATMENT FOR THOSE VETERANS WHO GENUINELY REQUIRE THEM.<br />
AS WITH ALL AREAS OF GOVERNMENT ACTIVITY AND<br />
RESPONSIBILITY, THERE IS NOT A ' BOTTOMLESS PIT' OF FUNDS.<br />
AND GOVERNMENT MUST ENSURE THAT FUNDS ARE DISTRIBUTED IN<br />
AN EFFICIENT AND EQUITABLE MANNER.<br />
WHAT WE SOUGHT TO DO THROUGH TrHE LEGISLATION WHICH CA. ME<br />
INTO EFFECT ON 6 JUNE THIS YEAR ( WITH THE SIX-MONTH<br />
SUNSET CLAUSE) WAS TO MAINTAIN A GENEROUS APPROACH TO<br />
DETERMINATION OF DISABILITY PENSION CLAIMS WHILE<br />
ENSURING THAT THE EXCESSES OF THE HIGH COURT'S O'BRIEN<br />
DECISION WERE ELIMINATED. THOSE WHOSE DISABILITrIES OR<br />
DEATHS ARE THE RESULT OF WAR SERVICE SHOULD RECEIVE<br />
PROPER COMPENSATION. THAT POSITION IS, AND SHOULD<br />
ALWAYS BE, NON-NEGOTIABLE. A REASONABLE LEEWAY IN<br />
FAVOUR OF THE CLAIMANT SHOULD ALSO EXIST GIVEN THE </p>
<p>UNCERTrAINTIES AS TO CAUSE IN MANY CASES AND THE MORAL<br />
CASE FOR GENEROUS TREATMENT. INDEED, THE AUSTRALIAN<br />
REPATRIATION SYSTEM REMAINS ONE OF TilE mos'r GENEROUS, IF'<br />
NOT THE MOST GENEROUS, IN THE WORLD.<br />
SOME AREAS OF THE EX-SERVICE COMMUNITY HAVE OBJECTED TO<br />
THE APPROACH WHICH WAS TAKEN FOLLOWING THE O'BRIEN<br />
DECISION. HOWEVER, WHEN THE AMENDING LEGISLATION WAS<br />
BROUGHT FORWARD EARLIER THIS YEAR THERE WAS BIPARTISAN<br />
SUPPORT FOR THE VIEW THAT THE PROVISIONS INTRODUCED INTO<br />
THE REPATRIATION ACT IN 1977 AS SUBSEQUENTLY<br />
INTERPRETED, PARTICULARLY IN THE O'BRIEN DECISION, WENT<br />
BEYOND THE LEVEL OF GENEROSITY THAT THE PARLIAMENT, AND<br />
INDEED MANY 59CTIONS OF THE EX-SERVICE COMMUNITY,<br />
BELIEVED WAS . REASONABLE.<br />
I ACCEPT THE POINT THAT HAS BEEN MADE BY YOUR NATIONAL<br />
PRESIDENT, SIR WILLIAM KEYS, AND OTHERS THAT THERE WAS A<br />
GENUINE MISUNDERSTANDING ABOUT CONSULTATION ON CHANGES<br />
TO THE LEGISLATION. I BELIEVE WE HAVE OVERCOME WHATEVER<br />
MISUNDERSTANDINGS AROSE BY ENGAGING IN A PROCESS OF FULL<br />
CONSULTATION WITH THE EX-SERVICE COMMUNITY, THROUGH ITS<br />
MAJOR ORGANISNTIONS INCLUDING THE RSL AND THEIR<br />
REPRESENTATIVES, ON THE PROVISIONS OF THE VETERANS'<br />
ENTITLEMENTS BILL. I BELIEVE ALSO THAT WE CAN DRAFT THE<br />
BILL SO THAT BOTH THE RSL AND THE GOVERNMENT, AS THE<br />
REPRESENTATIVE OF TAXPAYERS, ARE LARGELY SATISFIED WITH<br />
ITS PROVISIONS AND THE GOVERNMENT CAN PUT TO THE<br />
PARLIAMENT A BILL WHICH MEETS THE NEEDS OF VETERANS<br />
WITHOUT GOING BEYOND THE BOUNDS OF COMMUNITY EQUITY AND<br />
ECONOMIC RESPONSIBILITY-.<br />
THERE HAS BEEN A GOOD DEAL OF CONSULTATION WITH SIR<br />
WILLIAM KEYS WHO HAS PUT FORWARD THE INTERESTS OF THE<br />
EX-SERVICE COMMUNITY WITH VIGOUR AND LOGIC. INDEED HIS<br />
ROLE HAS BEEN ONE TO WHCIH I SHIOULD) LIKE TO PAY<br />
PARTICULAR TRIBUTE. JUDGE PAUL TOOSE HAS ALSO BEEN<br />
ADVISING THE RSL AND THERE HAS BEEN CONSIDERABLE<br />
DISCUSSION WITH HIM ON THE DETAILED PROVISIONS OF THE<br />
LEGISLATION. THERE COULD BE NO MORE EXTENSIVE PROCESS<br />
OF CONSULTATION THAN THE ONE WHICH HAS TAKEN PLACE ON<br />
THE VETERANS' ENTITLEMENT BILL.<br />
I BELIEVE THAT THE CONSULTATIONS AND NEGOTIATIONS, AS<br />
FAR AS THE RSL AND THlE GOVERNMENT ARE CONCERNED, HAVE<br />
BEENI ON THE BASIS OF FORMULATING THE BEST POSSIBLE<br />
LEGISLATION TO MEET THE NEEDS OF VETERANS IN THE CONTEXT<br />
OF THE ECONOMIC SITUATION AUSTRALIA CURRENTLY FACES.<br />
I MAKE NO APOLOGY FOR SAYING THAT THE GOVERNMENT SOUGHT<br />
TO FIND SAVINGS IN THE VETERANS' AFFAIRS PORTFOLIO JUST<br />
AS I MAKE NO APOLOGY FOR SAYING THAT WE TRIED TO FIND<br />
SAVINGS IN ALL OTHER PORTFOLIOS. IT IS SURPRISING HOW<br />
MANY GROUPS WITHIN THE COMMUNITY HAVE SAID TH-ATr THEY </p>
<p>HAVE BEEN SINGLED OUT IN THE MAY ECONOMIC STATEMENT FOR<br />
SPECIAL CUTBACKS. I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT THAT WAS NOT<br />
THE CASE EiTrHER IN THE CASE OF VETERANS OR ANY OTHER<br />
GROUP. BUT ALL AUSTRALIANS MUST REALISE THAT THE FUTURE OF OUR<br />
AUSTRALIAN SOCIETY DEPENDS UPON HAVING A SOUND ECONOMY<br />
WHICH PROVIDES SUFFICIENT GROWTH TO ENABLE MORE JOBS TO<br />
BE CREATED AND MORE FUNDS TO BE PROVIDED FOR THOSE AREAS<br />
WHICH JUSTIFY GREATER EXPENDITURE. IT IS NOT IN<br />
ANYONE'S INTERESTr TO TURN A BLIND EYE TO AREAS OF<br />
EXCESSIVE OR UNNECESSARY EXPENDITURE WHEN THERE ARE SO<br />
MANY AREAS WHICH NEED MORE FUNDS AND WHEN WE MUST DO AS<br />
A NATION EVERF. HING POSSIBLE TO ENSURE THAT WE DEVELOP<br />
AND MAINTAIN 4 SOUND ECONOMY FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS.<br />
YOU AND SO MANY OF YOUR COMRADES FOUGHT AND DIED THAT<br />
WE, AS A FREE SOCIETY, SHOULD BE ABLE TO DO THIS.<br />
AS A SOCIETY WE NEED TO MAINTAIN HIGH LEVELS OF<br />
PRODUCTIVE EMPLOYMENT FOR ALL IN THE WORKING AGE GROUPS,<br />
ESPECIALLY FOR OUR YOUNG PEOPLE. IT WOULD BE A SAD<br />
IRONY IF THE SACRIFICES MADE BY OUR VETERANS WERE WASTED<br />
BECAUSE WE COULD NOT SUSTAIN A RESPONSIBLE SOCIETY IN<br />
WHICH ALL SECTIONS OF THE COMMUNITY RECEIVE A FAIR GO.<br />
I SHALL NOT GO INTO DETAIL ABOUT THE PROVISIONS OF THE<br />
VETERANS' ENTITLEMENT BILL. CABINET STILL HAS TO<br />
CONSIDER IT.<br />
I CAN ASSURE YOU, HOWEVER, THAT CABINET WILL TAKE FULL<br />
ACCOUNT OF THE VIEWS OF THE RSL AND THE DISCUSSIONS<br />
WHICH HAVE TAKEN PLACE WITH SIR WILLIAM KEYS AND JUDGE<br />
PAUL TOOSE ON THE BILL. THE INTENTION IS TO INTRODUCE<br />
THE BILL NEXT MONTH AND TO HAVE IT PASSED BEFORE THE<br />
PARLIAMENT RISES SO THAT IT CAN COME INTO EFFECT FROM 6<br />
DECEMBER WHEN THE SUNSET CLAUSE ON THE AMENDMENTS TO<br />
SECTION 47 LAPSES.<br />
MY GOVERNMENT IS ANXIOUS TO BRING STABILITY TO THE<br />
VETERANS' AFFAIRS AREAS BY ENSURING THAT THE LEGISLATION<br />
M4EETS THE CRITERIA I HAVE MENTIONED, AND THAT THE<br />
DETERMINING SYSTEM WORKS QUICKLY, FAIRLY AND<br />
EFFICIENTLY. I HAVE SPOKEN ABOUT THE LEGISLATION. THE LONG OVERDUE<br />
CHANGES TO THE DETERMINING SYSTEM THAT WE INTRODUCED ARE<br />
NOW MAKING A REAL IMPRESSION ON THE BACKLOGS AND SHOULD<br />
BE OPERATING AS INTENDED BY THE END OF THIS FINANCIAL<br />
YEAR. WE ALSO WISH TO ENSURE THAT. THE REPATRIATION HOSPITAL<br />
SYSTEM IS ABLE TO MAINTAIN A HIGH QUALITY OF CARE AND<br />
FITS INTO THE OVERALL HEALTH DELIVERY SYSTEMS OF THE<br />
STATES AND THE COMMUNITY GENERALLY. </p>
<p>MY GoVLRZIMENT ACTED QUICKLY, WHENJ IT CAME TO OFFICE, TO<br />
IMPROVE THE CONDITION OF THE REPATRIATrION GENERAL<br />
HOSPITALS. SENATOR GIETZELT COMMISSIONED A REVIEW OF<br />
THE REPATRIATION HOSPITAL SYSTEM BY A COMMITTEE LED BY<br />
DOCTOR IAN BRAND. THATr COMMITTEE'S REPORT HAS NOW BEEN<br />
RECEIVED AND ITCS WIDE-RANGING RECOMMENDATIONS WARRANT,<br />
AND WILL RECEIVE, CAREFUL CONSIDERATION BY THE MINISTER<br />
AND THE GOVERNMENT.<br />
THEY WILL BE ADDRESSED AGAINST THE BACKGROUND OF THE<br />
COMMITMENT I GAVE IN THE NATIONAL POLICY SPEECH BEFORE<br />
LAST YEAR'S ELECTION " TO CONTINUE UPGRADING REPATRIATION<br />
HOSPITALS TOY MEET THE NEEDS OF AN AGEING VETERANS<br />
COMMUNITY." -THAT WAS A FIRM, UNEQUIVOVAL PLEDGE AND ONE<br />
WHICH, IF I KNOW THE RSL, THERE IS NO WAY IT WILL LET US<br />
FORGET. I WILL WELCOME YOUR VIGILANCE BUT IT WILL NOT<br />
BE NECESSARY. THAT COMMITMENT IS BEING FULLY<br />
IMPLEMENTED.<br />
ONE ASPECT OF THE BRAND REPORT WHICH IS NOW PLACED<br />
FAIRLY AND SQUARELY BEFORE US ALL, IS THE QUESTION OF<br />
INTEGRATION OF THE REPATRIATION GENERAL HOSPITAL SYSTEM<br />
WITH THE HOSPITAL FACILrIES PROVIDED IN EACH STATE.<br />
CLEARLY VERY CAREFUL PLANNING WILL BE NEEDED FOR<br />
INTEGRATION To BE A SUCCESS.<br />
INTEGRATION SIMPLY MEANS WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE STATE<br />
SYSTEM TO GUARANTEE THE BEST POSSIBLE TREATMENT WITHOUT<br />
DUPLICATING SERVICES.<br />
THE PRECISE FORM THE INTEGRATION PROCESS WILL TAKE IN<br />
THE FUTURE IS STILL TO BE DETERMINED. BUT IT WILL MEAN<br />
THAT CLOSER CO-ORDINATION AND CONSULTATION WILL BE<br />
REQUIRED BETWEEN STATE AUTHORITIES AND THE REPATRIATION<br />
GENERAL HOSPITALS. IT WILL ALSO MEAN, ESPECIALLY WITH<br />
AN AGEING VETERAN POPULATION, TH-AT A PARTICULAR EFFORT<br />
SHOULD BE MADE TO PROVIDE SERVICES, INCLUDING HOSPITAL<br />
SERVICES, CLOSER TO HOME.<br />
THAT SAID, I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT THERE WILL CONTINUE TOBE<br />
REPATRIATION HOSPITALS OPERATING AS AN IMPORTANT AND<br />
VISIBLE ELEMENT IN THE OVERALL TREATMENT FOR VETERANS<br />
AND WAR WIDOWS FOR MANY YEARS TO COME.<br />
AT THE SAME TIME AS THE BRAND REVIEW TEAM WAS WORKING ON<br />
ITS REPORT, THE GOVERNMENT WAS SHOWING ITS GENUINE<br />
COMMITrMENT TO THE ACUTE MEDICAL AND SURGICAL NEEDS OF<br />
VETERANS BY UNDERTAKING A MAJOR BUILD TNG AND REDEVELOPMENTr<br />
PROGRAM IN THE REPATRIATION GENERAL<br />
HOSPITALS. I COULD QUOTE A RANGE OF PROJECTS AND IMPRESIVE SOUNDING </p>
<p>DOLLAR TOTALS AND LIST EACH AND EVERY ONE OF THE MANY<br />
PROJECTS UNDER WAY OR IN THE PIPE-LINE. RATHER THAN DO<br />
THAT, I WOULD MENTION THAT IN THE PAST MONTH IT HAS BEEN<br />
ONE OF MY MORE PLEASANT TASKS TO SPEAK AT THE OFFICIAL<br />
OPENING OF THE NEW SURGICAL OPERATING SUITES AT DAW PARK<br />
ON 1 AUGUST, AND AT THE OFFICIAL OPENING OF THE NEW<br />
RADIOLOGY DEPARTMENT AND REFURBISHED WARD AT HEIDELBERG<br />
ON 29 AUGUST.<br />
AND THE WAY THINGS ARE GOING, I EXPECT THAT THERE WILL<br />
BE MORE OFFICIAL OPENING ACTIVITIES IN THE NOT TOO FAR<br />
DISTANT FUTURE.<br />
CRITrICISM WA. 4-EXPRESSED IN SOME QUARTERS WHEN I<br />
ANNOUNCED TH . T THE AUSTRALIAN WAR MEMORIAL WOULD COME<br />
WITHIN THE VETERANS' AFFAIRS PORTFOLIO. BUT THERE CAN<br />
BE LITTLE DOUBT THAT THE WAR MEMORIAL HAS BENEFITTED<br />
FROM THE TRANSFER, AND THAT THE PROOF OF THE PUDDING IS<br />
IN THE CONTENTS OF LAST MONTH'S BUDGET.<br />
A CONSIDERABLE INCREASE IN STAFF WILL BE PROVIDED DURING<br />
THE CURRENT FINANCIAL YEAR. AN INCREASED PROGRAM OF<br />
CONSERVATION AND CONTROL OF COLLECTIONS COSTING ALMOST<br />
$ 2M OVER THREE YEARS WILL BE INTRODUCED. A NEW STORAGE<br />
FACILITY WILL BE BOUGHT, AND FUNDING WILL BE PROVIDED<br />
FOR DOCUMENTATION AND CATALOGUE OF THE PRINTED<br />
COLLECTION. AND PERHAPS MOST IMPORTANT OF ALL, WE HAVE<br />
AGREED TO THE CONSTRUCTION OF A NEW STAFF ACCOMMODATION<br />
AND ADMINISTRATIVE SUPPORT BUILDING. THIS WILL COST<br />
APPROXIMATELY $ 6.514 AND WILL BE COMPLETED IN 1988. THE<br />
NEW BUILDING WILL THEN TAKE PRESSURE FROM THE MAIN<br />
BUT LDING OF THE WAR MEMORIAL WHICH IS NEEDED FOR DISPLAY<br />
AND EXHIBITION PURPOSES.<br />
THE AUSTRALIAN WAR MEMORIAL IS ONE OF THE GREAT 3<br />
INSTITUTIONS OF AUsTRLIAN SOCIETY. IT PAYS TRIBUTE TO<br />
THE SACRIFICES AND THE ACHIEVEMENTS OF AUSTRALIAN MEN<br />
AND WOMEN IN WARS AND THE PURSUIT OF PEACE. I AM VERY<br />
PLEASED THAT WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO PROVIDE THESE<br />
ADDITIONAL RESOURCES TO ENABLE THE WAR MEMORIAL TO<br />
FULFIL THE SYMBOLIC ROLE IT PLAYS IN AUSTRALIAN SOCIETY.<br />
EVEN MORE RECENT THAN THE BUDGET WAS THE TABLING IN<br />
PARLIAMENT ON 22 AUGUST OF THE FINAL REPORT OF THE ROYAL<br />
COMMISSION ON THE USE AND EFFECTS OF CHEMICAL AGENTS ON<br />
AUSTRALIAN PERSONNEL IN VIETNAM.<br />
THE REPORT'S CENTRAL FINDING IS THAT THE CHEMICAL<br />
AGENTS, BY AND LARGE, HAD NO ADVERSE EFFECTS ON<br />
AUSTRALIAN PERSONNEL. THE GOVERNMENT ACCEPTS THAT THE<br />
CASE FOR A LINK BETWEEN AGENT ORANGE AND HEALTH PROBLEMS<br />
AMONG VIETNAM VETERNAS HAS NOT BEEN ESTABLISHED.<br />
HOWEVER, BOTH THE GOvERNMENr AND THE RSL NEED TO BE </p>
<p>AWARE THAT THE PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL SUFFERINGS OF<br />
THlE VIETNAM VETERANS ARE REAL ENOUGH, WHETHER OR NOT<br />
THEY WERE CAUSED BY AGENT ORANGE. MR JUSTICE EVATT IS<br />
CLEARLY STATING THAT THE MAIN TASK, CARING FOR VIETNAM<br />
VETERANS, IS STILL CONTINUING.<br />
I CAN ASSURE ALL OF YOU HERE TODAY THAT WE WILL BE<br />
LOOKING VERY CAREFULLY AT THE REPORT'S RECOMMENDATIONS<br />
IN THE LIGHT OF THIS GOVERNMENT'S DEMONSTRATED<br />
COMMITMENT TO-PROVIDING OPTIMUM CARE FOR THE VETERANS OF<br />
ALL WARS.<br />
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,<br />
THE AUSTRALIAN LABOR GOVERNMENT ATTACHES GREAT<br />
IMPORTANCE TO SECURING CONDITIONS OF INTERNATIONAL<br />
PEACE, SECURITY AND STABILITY. WE ARE DEDICATED TO<br />
PERSUADING THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY, AND PARTICULARLY<br />
THE SUPERPOWERS, OF THE NEED FOR REAL PROGRESS IN' THE<br />
TASK OF GENUINE ARMS CONTROL AND DISARMAMENT. THIS IS<br />
REFLECTED IN OUR DETERMINED PURSUIT OF A COMPREHENSIVE<br />
TEST BAN TREATY, AN INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENT ON CHEMICAL<br />
WEAPONS AND IN OUR PRESENT ACTIVE PARTICIPATION IN THE<br />
NON-PROLIFERATION REVIEW CONFERENCE IN GENEVA.<br />
AUSTRALIAN VIEWS HAVE ALSO BEEN PUT DIRECTLY TO THE<br />
SUPERPOWERS.<br />
CLOSER TO HOME, THE RECENT AGREEMENT FOLLOWING AN<br />
AUSTRALIAN INITIATIVE AT THE SOUTH PACIFIC FORUM TO<br />
ESTABLISH A PACIFIC NUCLEAR FREE ZONE WAS A MAJOR<br />
ADVANCE IN THE CAUSE OF PEACE.<br />
AT THE SAME TIME W4E APPRECIATE THE REALITY OF AN<br />
UNSTABLE WORLD AND AS A GOVERNMENT HAVE ACCEPTED THE<br />
RESPONSIBILITY OF MAINTAINING EFFICIENT, WELL-MANNED,<br />
WELL EQUIPPED AUSTRALIAN DEFENCE FORCES. INDEED THE<br />
LABOR. GOVERNMENT REGARDS EXPENDITURE ON NATIONAL DEFENCE<br />
NEEDS AS AMONG THE MOST FUNDAMENTAL OF ITS NATIONAL<br />
RESPONSIBILITIES. THE 3.5 PER CENT ANNUAL INCREASE IN<br />
REAL DEFENCE EXPENDITURE THAT THE LABOR GOVERNMENT HAS<br />
MAINTAINED SINCE COMING TO OFFICE IS A CLEAR MEASURE OF.<br />
THE SERIOUSNESS WITH WHICH WE HAVE DISCHARGED THOSE<br />
RESPONSIBILITIES.<br />
MY GOVERNMENT HAS ALSO BEEN ESPECIALLY MINDFUL OF THE<br />
PART. ICULAR IMPORTANCE OF MAINTAINING AUSTRALIA'S<br />
ALLIANCE'RELATIONSHIPS. WE ARE TOTALLY COMMITTED TO<br />
ENSURING THE HEALTH OF THOSE RELATIONSHIPS WHICH WE<br />
CONSIDER VITAL TO THE MAINTENANCE OF PEACE IN OUR WORLD.<br />
THE SUCCESS WITH WHICH WE HAVE DONE SO WAS RECENTLY<br />
ACKNOWLEDGED AT A SPECIAL MEETING OF THE ASIA SOCIETY ON<br />
17 JULY BY US DEFENCE SECRETARY WEINBERGER WHEN HE SAID<br />
THE AUSTRALIA/ US ALLIANCE HAD " RARELY BEEN STRONGER". </p>
<p>I KNOW THE RETURNED SERVICES LEAGUE APPRECIATES THE<br />
IMPORTANCE OF THESE MATTERS FOR THE MAINTENANCE OF<br />
INTERNATIONAL PEACE AND SECURITY. THE LEAGUE HAS A MOST<br />
IMPORTANT ROLE IN KEEPING THESE PERSPECTIVES TO THE FORE<br />
IN OUR COMMUNITY. WE WELCOME THAT ROLE, PARTICULARLY<br />
WHERE IT IS EXERCISED ON YOUR BEHALF IN THE RESPONSIBLE<br />
AND EFFECTIVE MANNER OF YOUR PRESIDENT SIR WILLIAM KEYS.<br />
ACCORDINGLY, I HAVE MUCH PLEASURE IN DECLARING OPEN THIS<br />
ANNUAL NA~ TIONAL CONGRESS OF THE LEAGUE. </p>
