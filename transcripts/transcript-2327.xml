FOR PRESS: PM. NO. 110/ 1970<br />
SENATE ELECTION<br />
Commnt Lthe Prime Minister, Mifr John Gorton<br />
It is still too early to predict what the results of<br />
the election will be in terms of seats after the distribution of<br />
preferences. I am, of course, disappointed at the low primary<br />
vote received by the Government.<br />
But I am pleased that those who withdrew their<br />
primary votes from the Governmenc refused to give them to the<br />
Opposition. It seems probable that the Government's primary<br />
vote will be down by about 5 per cent and the Opposition's primary<br />
vote will be down by about 4 per cent, compared with the last<br />
general election. The DLJP deserve congratulations for their success<br />
which I believe shows public support for the policies on defence<br />
advanced by both the Government and the DLP.<br />
A combination of Government and DLP figures shows<br />
a substantial anti-Labor vote, particularly in Queensland and<br />
Victoria. But that does not alter the fact that I had hoped the<br />
Government would do much better in the primary vote than it has<br />
done; it is clearly up to us to try and win back public support by a<br />
positive, continuinlg programme of government in the next two years.<br />
CANBERRA, 22 November 1970 </p>
