PRIME MINISTER<br />
CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
LOCAL GOVERNMENT ASSOCIATION OF QUEENSLAND<br />
BROADBEACH 7 SEPTEMBER 1987<br />
Sir Albert Abbott, President, and Lady Abbott,<br />
Councillor Bill Layer, Chairman, Albert Shire,<br />
Alderman Denis Pye, Mayor, Gold Coast City,<br />
Ladies and gentlemen.<br />
This is the ninety-first annual conference of the Local<br />
Government Association of Queensland but it is the first to<br />
be officially opened by a Prime Minister.<br />
So as well as thanking you for-that honor it is appropriate<br />
as well that I take the opportunity, at this early stage in<br />
my Government's third term in office, to reaffirm our<br />
commitment to the development of Local Government in<br />
Australia. That commitment dates from our first days in office in 1983,<br />
when I appointed Tom Uren as Minister for Local Government.<br />
He was the first minister to exercise specific<br />
responsibility for the Commonwealth's relationship with<br />
Australia's Local Government bodies.<br />
TOM'S years as minister for Local Government, which ended<br />
this year with his retirement from the Ministry, were years<br />
of close and very constructive relationships between our two<br />
levels of government. I think I speak on behalf of us all<br />
in once again expressing gratitude to him for the great<br />
service he rendered the nation.<br />
As you know, the first act of my Government after the<br />
election was the implementation of major reforms to the<br />
structure of Commonwealth administration.<br />
These reforms strengthen the Commonwealth's commitment to<br />
Local Government. A senior Cabinet Minister, Mick Young,<br />
now has the overall responsibilities for the portfolio which<br />
includes Local Government. Senator Margaret Reynolds has<br />
been given particular responsibility for Local Government<br />
and regional development matters. OO </p>
<p>I am confident that Margaret Reynolds will maintain Tom<br />
Uren's tradition of vigorous and well-informed presentation<br />
of your interests to the Government. As a consequence of<br />
her own experience in local Government in Queensland, and as<br />
a Senator from Queensland, she will bring important new<br />
perspectives to the portfolio.<br />
I can assure you, too, that the Commonwealth Office of Local<br />
Government will continue to play a vital role in helping to<br />
link national objectives with varying local needs and<br />
conditions. Through this period of necessary budgetary restraint, the<br />
Commonwealth's commitment to Local Government has been<br />
reinforced with the introduction of the'Local Government<br />
( Financial Assistance) Act Of 1986 which continues to<br />
provide general purpose payments to councils. Those<br />
payments totalled $ 460 million in 1983-84 and have risen to<br />
$ 640 million this financial year.<br />
Total Federal Government assistance to local Government,<br />
including untied grants, roads grants and other specific<br />
purpose payments now exceeds $ 1,100 million annually.<br />
These expenditures represent a significant investment by the<br />
nation in the role and capacity of Local Government.<br />
A major cause of the success we have achieved since 1983 in<br />
strengthening Local Government has been the recognition of<br />
the need for co-operation between Local Government, the<br />
States and the Commonwealth.<br />
We will continue to place heavy emphasis on inter-government<br />
co-operation, drawing on the unique attributes of each level<br />
of Government, to produce the best results for all our<br />
constituents. You will be aware ho'wever, that despite that objective,<br />
there have recently been some difficulties in our<br />
relationship with the Queensland Government concerning the<br />
distribution of the Commonwealth's general purpose grants.<br />
Alone of the States, Queensland refused to enter<br />
negotiations on the development of appropriate principles<br />
for the distribution of those grants to Local Government<br />
bodies. That failure left the Commonwealth no alternative but to<br />
take a more intrusive role than it would have wished and to<br />
determine for itself the principles on which the funds were<br />
to be allocated in Queensland.<br />
In doing that however we told the Queensland Government that<br />
we want to avoid this outcome next year and are willing to<br />
start discussions as soon as possible to reach an acceptable<br />
solution. 0 00 8 638 </p>
<p>We recognise that Local Government in Queensland will not be<br />
helped if its State Government is unwilling to work with the<br />
Commonwealth in such a vital area.<br />
I want to stress that on th6 Commonwealth's part there is no<br />
wish to single out Queensland or to deprive the Queensland<br />
Government of its legitimate role in the distribution of<br />
grants. it is appropriate here that I pay tribute to your President,<br />
Sir Albert Abbott, for his role in seeking to facilitate<br />
agreement between the Commonwealth and the Queensland<br />
Government during the course of these negotiations.<br />
It is important also that we look beyond-a single instance<br />
of disagreement and focus on the many areas in whichi<br />
co-operation between levels of Government is being<br />
improved here in Queensland and throughout Australia.<br />
I have been particularly pleased to see the increasing<br />
number of activities involving the joint efforts of<br />
Commonwealth, State and Local Governments and their growing<br />
readiness to share information, ideas and experiences.<br />
The diversity that characterises Australia's Federal system<br />
of Government can be a powerful force for the betterment of<br />
all Australians if we harness its potential by co-operative<br />
endeavour. On that note I would like to reflect with you on our<br />
prospects for working together more closely in meeting the<br />
challenges we face as a nation. In particular I would like<br />
to canvass ways in which we might co-operatively improve the<br />
effectiveness and responsiveness of public administration.<br />
You will be aware that within the Commonwealth sphere we<br />
have taken steps to streamline administrative procedures in<br />
order to create a more integrated, leaner and more efficient<br />
public sector.<br />
The new ministerial and departmental arrangements seek to<br />
reduce overlap and duplication in the work of the Federal<br />
Government and to improve our policy co-ordination and<br />
program delivery. We have been prepared to ask fundamental<br />
questions about what functions the public sector should<br />
perform and how it should perform them.<br />
-Many of the questions we are raising cannot be addressed by<br />
the Commonwealth in isolation and it is time that the<br />
questions were put on a broader agenda.<br />
The people of Australia have a legitimate right to expect<br />
the different levels of government to work in harmony. Any<br />
dispassionate observer of the operations of the Australian<br />
political system would note overlaps in some areas of public<br />
administration and gaps in other areas. 0008Uz </p>
<p>our challenge is to close the gaps and remove the<br />
duplication that has built up over the years within and<br />
between levels of Government in order to develop a more<br />
responsive, better integrated and cost-effective public<br />
sector. Local Government has special relevance in this process. As<br />
I announced in Labor's election policy launch we intend to<br />
develop a positive approach to devolving administrative<br />
functions to Local Government.<br />
Commonwealth programs and procedures will be scrutinised to<br />
establish whether any of them could be undertaken more<br />
effectively by Local Government. Inter-governmental<br />
agreements encompassing program purposes, financial<br />
arrangements, needs-based planning processes and performance<br />
measures will also be examined and, where scope exists, they<br />
will be improved.<br />
This approach is fully complementary with the Federal<br />
Government's recognition of the fact that Local Government<br />
is an integral part of our nation's system of public<br />
administration and the delivery of community services.<br />
in all this, we are conscious of Local Government's concern<br />
about having increased responsibilities imposed on it<br />
without commensurate increases in financial resources.<br />
It is clear that the imperatives of national economic<br />
management have severely limited the Commonwealth's<br />
financial flexibility. We have no option but to look at<br />
ways of achieving economies in Government.<br />
We recognise, at the same time, that local Government must<br />
have access to funds adequate to discharge its<br />
responsibilkties. It is necessary for all of us in every level of Government<br />
to reassess how we undertake our functions and to reach<br />
agreement on respective roles and responsibilities.<br />
We must always be prepared to look, together, at how our<br />
limited resources are being managed so that we can ensure<br />
that the highest priority needs are being addressed as<br />
efficiently and as effectively as possible.<br />
For Local Government this may involve the development of<br />
more efficient management practices, the review of<br />
regulatory procedures that have outlived their usefulness,<br />
and more strategic financial planning and asset management.<br />
Like the Commonwealth it may also require a preparedness to<br />
dispense with functions which are no longer required so that<br />
we can redirect resources to where need is greatest.<br />
I am confident in the capacity of Local Government to meet<br />
these challenges. And I am aware that work is already being<br />
undertaken to improve the efficiency of Local Government<br />
administration. 000:, </p>
<p>For example, with support made available through the<br />
Commonwealth's Local Government Development Program, your<br />
own Association has been active in developing a corporate<br />
planning strategy manual and a community services inventory.<br />
The Queensland Department of Local Government is developing<br />
a model to assist councils with aspects of financial<br />
management. The Queensland Local Government Industry<br />
Training Committee is developing a package of training<br />
exercises to improve the development of council staff.<br />
Another significant development is the National Review of<br />
Local Government Labour Markets, a project being jointly<br />
sponsored by the States, Local Government and the<br />
Commonwealth. This Review will provide information and practical advice to<br />
Ministers so that co-ordinated action can be undertaken on a<br />
national basis to ensure that Local Government has available<br />
an adequate supply of appropriately skilled personnel. A<br />
major thrust of the Review is to find ways of removing<br />
impediments to labour mobility in Local Government.<br />
The Review is approaching its task by releasing a series of<br />
discussion papers on the issues involved.<br />
It gives me great pleasure to launch the first two of these<br />
Discussion Papers: " Improving Flexibility in Local<br />
Government" and " Portability of Superannuation".<br />
These papers are being circulated to all Local Government<br />
and other interested bodies with a request for comment.<br />
They will be revised on the basis of these comments before<br />
being considered by governments for action.<br />
The National Review of Local Government Labour Markets is an<br />
important project which promises to yield significant gains.<br />
I am sure it will prove an excellent example of what can be<br />
achieved by all levels of government working together.<br />
In their various ways each of the activities I have<br />
discussed today is raising fundamental questions about the<br />
direction and organisation of Local Government. I am<br />
encouraged by the fact that these questions are being raised<br />
and examined by Local Government itself. For our part at<br />
the Commonwealth level we will continue to support your<br />
efforts and I wish you well in your deliberation on these<br />
and other issues over the next few days. 000871 </p>
