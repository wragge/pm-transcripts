<p>Hello Betty. It's a tremendous privilege for me to share this</p>
<p> occasion with you and so many of your admirers and fans all around</p>
<p> Australia. Everything that's been said about Betty today, the</p>
<p> people who know her best and love her most in her sporting career</p>
<p> and through her life have spoken very warmly of what she has meant</p>
<p> to them and what she has meant to the Olympic ideal.</p>
<p>I suppose one of the things that one could emphatically say about</p>
<p> Betty is that she is the ultimate example of what the Olympic ideal</p>
<p> is really all about. Because it's not only about performance,</p>
<p> it's not only about winning. It's not only about being the</p>
<p> best. And she has performed well, she's won, she's been</p>
<p> the best - the only Australian to win four gold medals in track and</p>
<p> field events, and that is the best - but she's also displayed</p>
<p> something else which is indisputably part of the Olympic ideal, and</p>
<p> she's displayed immense character. And the strength of character</p>
<p> that she displayed in her athletic career has been matched, indeed,</p>
<p> exceeded by the strength of character of which she has displayed later</p>
<p> in life. And the uncomplaining manner in which she has dealt with</p>
<p> an adversity that would have crumpled the best of us is a tremendous</p>
<p> example.</p>
<p>And I think it is entirely appropriate that we should be gathered</p>
<p> here at what is undoubtedly Australia's most revered and hallowed</p>
<p> sporting arena, the Melbourne Cricket Ground, in the presence of what</p>
<p> must be one of the greatest gatherings of Olympic champions and contributors</p>
<p> to Australia's Olympic performance. And people have come together</p>
<p> very quickly because they admire, Betty, what you achieved as an athlete.</p>
<p> They revere what you represent in terms of the best of the Australian</p>
<p> character. And they admire, indeed, they are in awe of the tremendous</p>
<p> courage that you've demonstrated.</p>
<p>So to you, I know that everybody here today will get behind the purpose</p>
<p> of today's luncheon. And in declaring open the Betty Cuthbert</p>
<p> appeal, can I say to you Betty, that the Melbourne Cricket Ground</p>
<p> is still full of Australians who are cheering for you.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
