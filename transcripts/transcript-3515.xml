J4 AUSTHALIA Press Statement No. 392<br />
3 December 1974<br />
TEXTILES AUTHORITY REPORT YARNS, KNITTED FABICS AND<br />
TOWELLING<br />
The Prime Minister, Mr Whitlam, announced today<br />
that, following consideration of a report by the Textiles<br />
Authority within the Industries Assistance Commission, the<br />
Government had decided to introduce tariff quotas on imported<br />
acrylic apparel yarns, knitted or crocheted fabrics of<br />
man-made fibres and terry towels. Mr Whitlam stated that the<br />
Textiles Authority had found that imports in these areas were<br />
causing market disruption. Mr Whitlam also released the<br />
Authority's report and an exchange of correspondence between<br />
the Standing Interdepartmental Committee on Assistance to<br />
Industries and the Commission.<br />
. Mr Whitlam said that the Government did not<br />
consider it appropriate to attempt to negotiate voluntary restraints<br />
on the basis recommended by the Authority. Therefore the<br />
Government had decided to accept the Authority's alternative<br />
recommendation that other means such as tariff quotas be used<br />
to achieve a similar measure of assistance to the domestic<br />
industry. Mr Whitlam said that the tariff quotas which were<br />
being introduced consistently with Australia's rights and<br />
obligations under the GATT would remain in effect for the next<br />
12 months and that this form of assistance would be reviewed<br />
within that period. Mr Whitlam. said that he would be sending a reference<br />
to the Industries Assistance Commission for inquiry and report<br />
on the long-term assistance requirements of the sectors of the<br />
Australian industry concerned.<br />
Mr Whitlam added that tariff quotas would apply to<br />
all imports of the products concerned cleared for home consumption<br />
after the date of this announcement. The policy aspects of the<br />
administration of the tariff quotas will be the responsibility of<br />
the Minister for Manufacturing Industry who will announce detailed<br />
arrangements in the near future. Copies of the Textiles Authority's<br />
report and related correspondence are now available.<br />
