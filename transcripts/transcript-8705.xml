PRIME MINISTER<br />
STATEMENT BY TIlE PRIME MINISTER, THE lION PJ. KEATING MP<br />
OPPOSITION INDUSTRIAL REI ATIONS POLICY<br />
The Opposition's Industrial Relations policy is one week old today, and already it is<br />
riddled with contradiction.<br />
Dr Hewson told us that this policy would put the Industrial Relations Commission in tile<br />
" dustbin of history".<br />
But now in a bizarre attempt to cover his leader's mistakes on the Sunday program, the<br />
Opposition spokesman tells us he will open the bin and dray the Commission back out<br />
again.<br />
The resulting contradictions in Opposition policy show that it would be in practice<br />
unworkable. Mr Howard put out a press relCasC yesterday in which he said that pay levels in contracts<br />
will have to be increased whenever the Commission increases the rate in the award which<br />
formerly covered the employees.<br />
In other words, whenever anen ployment contract is renewed it must pick up whatever<br />
increase the Commission has decided for the award.<br />
Mr Iloward says a union can apply for such an increase at any time.<br />
The Commission would be able to determinc the frequency and size of changes in the<br />
base rates. It regains its old role as the national arbitrator of wages, with award increascs<br />
automatically flowing into individual contracts as they expire and on renewal.<br />
But the basis upon which the Commission would change a base award rate is not specified<br />
by the Coalition. It may be changed work value for that classification, for example, or<br />
changed relativity, or local circumstances factors that nced not be connected to the<br />
employment contract which the dccision nonetheless alters. I </p>
<p>So in the attempt to find a plausible way out of the policy's failure to specify a way of<br />
updating minimums Mr Howard has driven a semi trailer through the policy,<br />
Clearly, the Opposition has given no thought to the implications of Mr Howard's<br />
announcement yesterday.<br />
First it was individual contracts, a disappearing Commission, disappearing unions.<br />
Now the Opposition is saying the contracts will just reflect arbitrated changes in the award<br />
minimum. Mr Howard is making policy on the run, trying to cover his leader's mistakes.<br />
But in trying to repair the policy Mr Howard has raised more questions than he answers.<br />
The policy released last week says explicitly that all awards will automatically terminate<br />
except where both employees and cmployers indicate the award should continue.<br />
This raises the possibility that in many areas there will cease to be an award at all. Mr<br />
Howard's policy offers no way of updating the mniniums in contracts involving people<br />
formerly covered by thcsc awards.<br />
Even where an award rcmains, it will be on a shrinking base of employees and employers,<br />
raising the risk that changes in the award minimum will reflect consent arrangements<br />
which may bc inappropriate for enterprises not under the award.<br />
However, under the Opposition's re-announced policy these increases would flow into<br />
individual contracts.<br />
The contradiction over the role of the Commission is just one of the problems revealed as<br />
the policy is subjected to scrutiny.<br />
The Opposition has still not explained how the $ 3.50 hour youth minimum will be<br />
updated. Will the Commission do that too?<br />
What is he telling small business, which is discovering that his policy would apply only to<br />
incorporated cntcrprics?<br />
And what is Mr Howard telling the business leaders who are telling him that the<br />
Opposition policy provides no mechanism for rccognising either one or many bargaining<br />
agents in an enterprise, and provides no mechanism upon which an enterprise bargain may<br />
be negotiated?<br />
In fact, it rejects a collective bargaining system under which a single agreement could<br />
cover a single enterprise. </p>
<p>The truth is that the Opposition is not proposing a system of enterprise bargaining, in<br />
which agreements are madc to enhance productivity in return for greater rewards from<br />
work. It is proposing a system of individual contracts between the employcr and each employee.<br />
And we now learn that these Individual contracts will be supposed to reflect changes in<br />
awards changes which, as time goes on, would be made for reasons more and more<br />
closcly connected with the residual coverage of the award, and less and less for reasons<br />
connected with the circumstances of the employees under individual contracts who will<br />
nonethelcss be affected.<br />
Isn't it time Dr Hcwson held a press conference with the Canberra gallery to explain his<br />
policies? CANBERRA 27 October 1992 </p>
