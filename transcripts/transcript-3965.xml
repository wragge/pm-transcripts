PRIME MINISTER PRESS STATEMENT NO. 593<br />
NOVEMBER 1975<br />
MEETING BETWEEN~ PRIME'MINISTER AND OPPOSITION LEADERS<br />
Mr Fraser has asked for a meeting. As I am always<br />
ready to discuss issues rationally and sensibly, I welcomed<br />
the opportunity to do just that. Mr Fraser is now saying<br />
* he will-insist absolutely on the requirements for a general<br />
election before Christmas-. or before 30 June. He is also<br />
insisting that Australian Government officials be present<br />
to advise him and his colleagues..<br />
The Constitutional dispute boils down to one simple<br />
principle; the Party with the unchallenged majority in the<br />
House of Representatives must be allowed to govern.<br />
Officials give advice to the Government. The Government<br />
advises the Governor-General as to when any election should be<br />
held. Frank Crean, Fred Daly and I are still happy to meet<br />
with Mr Fraser tomorrow morning, but I do not want him or anyone<br />
else tto be under any impression that such a meeting is taking<br />
place to permit him, as Leader of the Opposition, to either<br />
name the date of an election or to receive advice from officials.<br />
