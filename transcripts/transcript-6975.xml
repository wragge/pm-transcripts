PRINIMISET 9<br />
EMBARGCED UNTIL DELIVERY CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY<br />
LOCAL EMlPLOYMIENT INITIATIVES CONFERENCE<br />
16 JULY 1986 CANBERRA<br />
Disting~ uished international guests, ladies and gentlemen,<br />
First I t me congratulate the National Advisory Groupoon<br />
Local rployment Initiatives for organising this conference.<br />
on behE'Af of the Government I also extend a warm welcome to<br />
out ovorseaz visitors.<br />
It has long been my view that effective solutions to<br />
problelas are more likely to be achieved when there are<br />
comnicn goals, common perceptions of the nature of problems<br />
and a co-operative approach in addressing them.<br />
In Government. we have pursued this consensus-style approach<br />
to the resolution of problems, stressing the need for<br />
co-opzo'ation and a shared sense of purpose within the<br />
cor'-mtni ty.<br />
The ccncept of local employment initiatives is a striking<br />
emarnplc of this sort of co-operative approach. it is a<br />
conccD~ c which has already been put into practice in other<br />
OECD countries.<br />
in Australia we have made solid progress over the past three<br />
years in the creation of jobs through this type of approaeh.<br />
The gains that we have made some 670,000 new jobs in all<br />
and pulling over 2 percentage points oft the unemployment<br />
rate are known well enough. But there is no room for<br />
compla~ cency: the level of unemployment remains intolerably<br />
high. Mly Government will continue to pursue steadfastly the<br />
objective of providing job opportunities. for all Australians<br />
who wizh to work.<br />
Even as we acknowledge the progress we have made along this<br />
path, it also has to be said that Australians have recently<br />
had to come to terms with the sobering reality that we will<br />
have to battle much harder together in the3 future if we are<br />
to maintain and extend those achievements<br />
World trading conditions have turned shart-ly against<br />
Australia, requiring us to take some harsk medicine. </p>
<p>We can't avoid, as a nation, the adjustments which are<br />
necessary. what ve can do, having recognised the now<br />
realitieo, is to work constructively to achieve the best<br />
possible outcome for Australia. Each of us will have to be<br />
prepared to Play our part.<br />
Wage earners will be called upon to accept lower wage rises<br />
than otherise might have been sustainable. This reflects<br />
not only the need to curb our inflation rate and maintain<br />
our recently improved international competitiveness but also<br />
the fact that the growth of Australia's national income has<br />
been cut by 3 per cent in the past year and wages and<br />
salaries are far and away the largest part of our national<br />
income.<br />
Entrepreneurs will need to adopt keen pricing policies and<br />
to be prepared to seek out profitable lines of activity and<br />
to take rics.<br />
It is only in that way that we can take advantage of our<br />
improved cormpatitiveness and take markets away from foreign<br />
competition both in Australia and abroad and in that way<br />
to maximise the growth of jobs and national wealth.<br />
The coming Dudget will incorporate some very tough<br />
decisions decisions which would not have been necessary in<br />
other circumnstances but which are needed now to produce an<br />
appropriate degree of expenditure restraint.<br />
Some of these decisions will not be popular but that does<br />
not make them any the less necessary.<br />
The facte a,: e that Australia has been drawing too heavily on<br />
the savings of the world to support our own living standards<br />
for quite some time.<br />
In the past Australia has frequently been able to avoid<br />
taking decisive action to correct this situation because<br />
good fortune has intervened.<br />
But there is precious little prospect that world conditions<br />
will turn in our favour this time.<br />
We need to raise our own saving effort and, for a time,<br />
accept correspondingly lower living standards. In the case<br />
of the public sector that means expenditure restraint and a<br />
lower Budget deficit.<br />
over and above each of those specific contributions,<br />
Australians need also to work harder and better so that we<br />
can rebuild Australia's trading position in the world.<br />
we can no longer rely just on our primary industries,<br />
efficient and productive though the; are, to support us. If<br />
we are to recover lost ground we mu t turn to manufacturing<br />
and service industries to provide t e thrust for continued<br />
economic growth and job creation in this country. </p>
<p>The econounic adjustment required in Australia involves a<br />
fundamental realignment of industrial activity, a<br />
realignment which in one vay or another will affect all<br />
members of Au~ stralian society.<br />
we in Government are backing this realignment process by<br />
taking a r-ar-ber of specific initiatives to encourage new<br />
industriec to be set up and existing industries to<br />
restructure. And as the circumstances demand, the<br />
Government. will need to continue to adopt positive<br />
adjustment measures such as the initiatives we have taken<br />
for the car, steel and heavy engineering industries, and the<br />
support wc hxave given to private research and development<br />
through the 150 per cent tax deduction for R D and the<br />
Grants for Industry Research and Development Scheme.<br />
Deregulation of the financial sector has led to a major<br />
shaking up of the Australian financial system and its<br />
approach to business big business, small business and<br />
personal customers alike. in addition, the formation of<br />
Management Investment Companies, which receive substantial<br />
government 3upport, will help in the provision of venture<br />
capital to new, innovative job creating activities.<br />
But the kind of effort needed to recover from the<br />
difficulties Australia faces cannot be imposed fron Canberra<br />
or even from the less rarefied climes of Sydney or<br />
Melbourne. Instead it will come from the community and<br />
especially from the efforts of groups and individuals who<br />
seek out opportunity and are not afraid to seize upon it.<br />
And, those individual efforts will be most productive in an<br />
environment in which innovation and initiative are not only<br />
supported b-ut also actively encouraged by the community as a<br />
whole. It is for this reason that I am particularly pleased to be<br />
able to address you at this conference tonight.<br />
When Ralph Willis first approached me early last year with a<br />
proposal to establish a National Advisory Group on Local<br />
Employment Initiatives I had no hesitation in endorsing his<br />
proposal as a means of exploring this avenue of job<br />
creation. Z know that the Advisory Group has been working hard to<br />
assess overseas experience with local employment initiatives<br />
and to glean what lessons can be learned for Australia.<br />
This Conference will provide an important input into the<br />
Group's report to be presented to the Minister and the<br />
Government later this year.<br />
The various parties that would contribute to the development<br />
of local employment initiatives in Australia already have<br />
shown a preparedness to invol -e themselves in this sort of<br />
activity. </p>
<p>Australiwan trade unions have demonstrated a commnitment to<br />
exploro nad become Involved in local economic development.<br />
They are epresented on the wide variety of intermediary<br />
organiivations providing come level of assistance to local<br />
employmenz development around Australia.<br />
For example, the South Coast Employment Development Project<br />
in NSW to which BHP has lent its support was originally<br />
developed by the metal manufacturing group of unions which<br />
is affilia-ted with the South Coast Labour Council.<br />
Similarly the Trades Hall Council in Newcastle was an<br />
important partner in the process of establishing the new<br />
Hunter 1Rcgion Enterprise Agency.<br />
All of tzhe State Governments in Australia are involved to<br />
some degree in the development of local employment<br />
activit-' eG. The range of activities is wide, and often<br />
exploratory in nature. Many of the programs centre on<br />
generating entrepreneurial skills through the establishment<br />
of new cmuall businesses.<br />
Local Govornment, by its very nature, potentially has a<br />
vital role in fostering local economic development. Local<br />
Governments have significant planning and financial<br />
resources which can extend and complement State and<br />
Commonwealth policy initiatives. They have already played<br />
an importzn~ t part in the implementation of our Community<br />
Employment Program and have shown a willingness to<br />
contribute to the creation of jobs in their localities.<br />
Local communities in rural areas have been hit hard by the<br />
slump in wuorld agricultural prices. Accordingly, rural<br />
assistance measures are high on my Government's agenda, and<br />
an important item on that agenda is the development of<br />
locally : Daced employment. it is possible that a strategy<br />
for employm~ ent based on local level planning and<br />
implementation may provide welcome relief for the rural<br />
areas of Australia.<br />
One directly relevant Commonwealth initiative was presented<br />
in the Economic and Rural Policy Statement of 15 April.<br />
This is th-e Country Centres Project, which is a pilot scheme<br />
for 1986-87 investigating the development potential of<br />
selected country centres and their surroundi-ng regions. The<br />
project aims to identify realistic growth opportunities on a<br />
regional basis and to set the foundations for<br />
region-specific strategies for adjustment to change.<br />
The outcome of these studies will provide input into a<br />
report to be made to the Commonwealth Government in early<br />
1987. We will be examining very carefully the opportunities<br />
that local employment initiatives offer for people in rural<br />
communi ties.<br />
It has, of course, beei in the area of youth unemployment<br />
where the need for coriective action by our community has<br />
been felt with particular intensity. </p>
<p>When Labor came to office more than 350,000 young people<br />
were unempl. oyed and unemployment among the 15-24 year age<br />
group had hit a staggering 20 per cent. The youth of<br />
Australia was being denied the opportunity to do productive<br />
work, and this had created for large numbers of young people<br />
a loss of self-esteem and a sense of futility and<br />
hopelessness about the future.<br />
In a little over three years we have reduced youth<br />
unemployment by one-fifth; and we have cut the unemployment<br />
rate among 15 to 24 year olds to less than 15 per cent.<br />
Through Priority One my Government has embarked upon a<br />
long-term strategy for improving the opportunities for the<br />
young to participate more fully and more productively in our<br />
society. And within Priority One, the Government has<br />
developed opportunities for young people to undertake<br />
voluntary wcrk doubling the number of participants placed<br />
in Voluntecr Youth Projects and establishing the Group<br />
Community Volunteers Scheme.<br />
In my Addross to the Nation I announced that the Government<br />
will be developing in co-operation with the States, local<br />
governments, community organisations and trade unions a<br />
scheme providing community work for the unemployed. The<br />
scheme will be a voluntary one. it is a further initiative<br />
in the Goverrnment's drive to increase the availability of<br />
jobs for our nation's young.<br />
The proposals for community work for the unemployed are<br />
testimony to Government's com~ mitment to explore<br />
alternative awproaches to increasing job opportunities.<br />
And this is where your conference can play such an important<br />
part in widening the horizons of opportunity and offering<br />
fresh approaches. The Government looks forward. to receiving<br />
the work of the National Advisory Group on Local Employment<br />
Initiatives later this year, when the Group will also have<br />
had the benefit of a number of commissioned studies.<br />
I commend you for the imagination and enthusiasm you are<br />
displaying in participating in this Conference and I wish<br />
you well in your deliberations. </p>
