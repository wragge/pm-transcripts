DEATH OF PRIME MINISTE'L OF CEYLON<br />
Tributes in the House of Representatives by the Rt. Hon. R. G.<br />
Menzies and the Leader of the Opposition, the Rt. Hon. H. V. Evatt<br />
Mr. Speaker, before the business of the House begins I<br />
wish to refer very briefly to the tragic loss that has been suffered<br />
by our sister member of the Commonwealth, Ceylon, by the<br />
assassination of her Prime Minister, Mr. Bandaranaike. I knew<br />
him, of course, very well. At an earlier date I knew his distinguished<br />
predeccssor, Don Stephen Senanayake, who was accidentally<br />
killed. Now this horrible event has occurred. I took<br />
steps at once to send expressions of sympathy from the Australian<br />
Government and from this Parliament, but I am perfectly certain<br />
that the House would like me to associate it with an expression,<br />
not only of horror at this crime, but also of the profoundest<br />
sympathy with the people and the Government of Ceylon.<br />
It is unfortunately true that in the early days of independence<br />
some turbulence manifests itself. file have had this<br />
tragic event in Ceylon and on an earlio r occasion) in Pakistan,<br />
when that very great man, Liaquat Ali Khan, was assassinated.<br />
Of course, it is a particularly severe blow for Ceylon to have<br />
lost, by sudden death, two of her Prime Ministers in the very<br />
brief history of her independence. The existence of turbulence,<br />
danger and disorder is, I believe, something that we always must<br />
bear in mind when we consider the history of these new and independent<br />
countries. It emphasises the fact that we must have a<br />
6rezat deal of sympathy for them and show a great deal of undorstanding.<br />
On this occasion, our sympathy goes out very strongly<br />
to the family of Mr. Bandaranaike and to the people of Ceylon.<br />
This was a tragic event. One can only hope that it<br />
will not leave too deep a mark on the future history of a country<br />
with which we are so closely linked, and with which we have<br />
always enjoyed the most friendly associations,<br />
Dr. Evatt: Mr. Speaker, I wish to say a word or two in support of<br />
the Prime Minister. Ceylon is a nation that is very close to<br />
Australia. Our friendly relationships with Ceylon were confirmed<br />
during the war. This tragic event must arouse our sympathy<br />
for the people of Ceylon.<br />
I think that everybody must have been struck with the<br />
heroic qualities that were displayed by Mr. Bandaranaike in<br />
speaking to the people of Ceylon from the operating room, and even<br />
urging that somo patience be shown with the alleged assassin. It<br />
appears also that he defended his wife ag; ainst assassination.<br />
As the Prime Minister has pointed out, in throo<br />
nations, all previously British colonies and now belonging to the<br />
British Commonwealth of Nations, suchsad events have occurred.<br />
There has been the assassination of the Prime Minister of Pakistan,<br />
Liaquat Ali Khan, of the Prime Minister of Ceylon, and of<br />
that very great and extraordinary man, Mahatma Gandi, during the<br />
critical per-iod of the history of India end Pakistan. The road<br />
to democracy is sometimes strewn with great difficulties and our<br />
best course is to give our sympathy and understanding to these<br />
people and their leaders. I entirely join in the message proposed<br />
by the Prime Minister.<br />
Canberra,<br />
