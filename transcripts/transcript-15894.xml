    <content><![CDATA[<p>It is a great pleasure to be here today to open officially the new Medical School at Deakin University.</p>
<p>Before I begin my remarks this morning I want to acknowledge the grief and suffering of those affected by the tragic boat collision on Sydney harbour early this morning.</p>
<p>The harbour is the centre of so much of Sydney life.</p>
<p>It is terrible to think of it today as a place of suffering and death.</p>
<p>News like this is just every parent's worst nightmare.</p>
<p>We are thinking of the parents, families and friends of the five young people who lost their lives, and the nine who were injured.</p>
<p>Awful events like this are also a reminder of how much we rely on the training and special skills of the men and women of our emergency services and medical professions  -  the reason why we're here today at Deakin University.</p>
<p>Deakin University has a proud record as Victoria's first major regional university.</p>
<p>It has grown remarkably since it was established in the 1970s to a student population of 34,000 now, including around 7,000 international students studying here in Australia or throughout the world.</p>
<p>And this campus shows that remarkable growth.</p>
<p>Waurn Ponds was once the outskirts of Geelong  -  now it is the centre of a growth area.</p>
<p>Deakin University has made a contribution beyond education to Geelong, its surrounding districts and throughout Western Victoria.</p>
<p>I am sure that Alfred Deakin  -  one of the architects of the Australian Federation  -  would be proud to be associated with your great institution.</p>
<p>I would like to congratulate all of the staff and students of Deakin University on what you have already achieved, even as you are about to take the next step with the official opening of the Medical School.</p>
<p>I can claim a close personal link to the health professions.</p>
<p>My mother trained as a nurse.</p>
<p>So did my sister and one of my brothers.</p>
<p>In fact, I am the one who let the family tradition down  -  the one that did not make it into the health care profession, beyond a short stint as a wardsman in Canterbury Hospital in the ‘70s.</p>
<p>But coming from a family of nurses I have always had lots of views put to me about the importance of healthcare.</p>
<p>[And particularly I've been told many times how it's the nurses who hold the whole system together.]</p>
<p>Health Care</p>
<p>Australia's health care system is under pressures from many sources.</p>
<p>The health needs of our population are changing, as people live longer lives.</p>
<p>Chronic disease rates are rising dramatically.</p>
<p>The costs of new technologies and treatments are very substantial.</p>
<p>And the provision of health care is becoming more complex, especially with the long term management of illnesses becoming increasingly central to the health system.</p>
<p>Australia's health care system is not ready for the challenges ahead, and that is why the Government is committed to health reform.</p>
<p>We have committed more funds, but that is only part of the answer.</p>
<p>We have also begun to work with the state and territory governments to end the blame game about who is responsible for shortcomings in the health system.</p>
<p>We want to work with the state governments to make the system work.</p>
<p>I want to congratulate the Victorian Government for its support for the Deakin University Medical School.</p>
<p>We also want to get the best ideas into the health system and that means being open to new ideas.</p>
<p>That is why we made a long-term plan for health care one of the ten streams we focused on at the 2020 Summit.</p>
<p>We heard of ideas like the proposal for a “Healthbook” that might look a bit like a FaceBook website.</p>
<p>It could be a place for Australians to take control of their own medical records.</p>
<p>They could grant access to those records to their medical professionals  -  doctors, physiotherapists, other health professionals.</p>
<p>At its best, it could give people control over their own medical records.</p>
<p>It is part of the idea discussed at the 2020 Summit of putting the patient at the centre of the health system.</p>
<p>New ideas like this take time to progress, as there are many aspects to be considered.</p>
<p>But I am confident that this sort of thinking can make our health system even better  -  more responsive  -  in the future.</p>
<p>In the meantime, we are moving ahead with the major immediate challenges in improving our health care system.</p>
<p>Health Policy</p>
<p>The Government believes that every Australian has the right to live their life in good health and access the best possible health care when they need it.</p>
<p>That means we have a new focus on prevention  -  on giving people the tools and knowledge to make good health decisions.</p>
<p>It also means defending and strengthening our public hospital system, as the foundation of our dual system.</p>
<p>And it means constantly improving the skills of the health workforce  -  a challenge for the long-term.</p>
<p>I want to see a quality health system that provides access to all Australians, regardless of what they earn or where they live.</p>
<p>That is why we are investing over half-a-billion dollars in targeted rural health programs this year.</p>
<p>Having grown up in rural Queensland I understand the importance of access to health care for all people.</p>
<p>A key part of the improving access to health care in rural and regional communities is improving the health of Indigenous Australians.</p>
<p>The health gap between the Indigenous and non-Indigenous communities in Australia is unacceptable.</p>
<p>Higher infant mortality rates and shorter life expectancy for Indigenous Australians is inexcusable.</p>
<p>But we need to do more to bridge this gap.</p>
<p>The Council of Australian Governments (COAG) has committed to a partnership among all levels of government to work with Indigenous communities to address Indigenous disadvantage.</p>
<p>We have committed to closing the life expectancy gap within a generation and halving the mortality gap for children under five within a decade.</p>
<p>I also announced recently that every year when Parliament begins I will present a report on progress in closing the gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australia  -  particularly the health gap.</p>
<p>It is a way to make sure that we stay focused on improving the health situation for Indigenous communities.</p>
<p>The Health Workforce</p>
<p>One key element for achieving our vision of a better health system is having the right health workforce.</p>
<p>That means more doctors.</p>
<p>I know that in training more doctors we face the challenge of providing quality clinical training  -  something I know you have been working collaboratively on with the other Victorian Medical Deans.</p>
<p>Having the right health workforce  -  one with an appreciation of the importance of regional, rural and Indigenous health problems  -  will be an important part of improving access to health care for rural Australians.</p>
<p>I am pleased to offer my support for Deakin University Medical School and its strong commitment to these areas.</p>
<p>Your course will help develop a new generation of doctors with a strong understanding of the needs of rural communities, of the needs of our indigenous communities and of the challenging role played by health care professionals in regional communities  -  either as general practitioners or as specialists.</p>
<p>It will develop a new generation of doctors with a focus on health promotion and prevention.</p>
<p>A new generation of doctors that will play an important part in meeting the health needs of our nation.</p>
<p>To offer further support to Deakin University I am pleased to announce today that the Australian Government will provide one million dollars to support key rural academic appointments at Deakin's new Medical School.</p>
<p>This funding is part of our response to a newly released audit report which has confirmed that the supply of health professionals in many rural and regional centres is low to very poor.</p>
<p>We want to support Deakin University Medical School's innovative rural training program which will place medical students at training sites in south-western Victoria, including hubs at Ballarat and Warrnambool.</p>
<p>The funding will allow the University to make a number of crucial rural appointments to help with preparations for clinical training for the University's first cohort of medical students.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>The Australian Government is committed to health care reform and meeting the changing health needs of an ageing population into the future.</p>
<p>We are committed to bringing new ideas into the health policy debate.</p>
<p>We are committed to working with state governments, with health professionals and the wider community to delivering the best health outcomes possible.</p>
<p>And we are committed to supporting the training of new health care professionals.</p>
<p>I am pleased to say the Deakin University and its new Medical School are important partners for us.</p>
<p>I want to congratulate the University on its new school.</p>
<p>I want to congratulate all those who have supported the establishment of the school  -  federal, state and local politicians, local community leaders and the private sector.</p>
<p>I want to congratulate the staff and faculty and wish you all the best for your first year.</p>
<p>And I want to congratulate the students of 2008 for being the trailblazers for this new course.</p>
<p>It is my great pleasure to open formally Deakin University's Medical School.</p>
