PRIMIE M~ IIM<br />
SPEECH NOTES FOR MT.. ISA.<br />
11T. ISA ** NOVEMBER 23<br />
1. THIS IS MY FIRST STAY AS PRIME MINISTER IN<br />
YOUR RICH AND REMARKABLE CITY. FEW CITIES COPE SO<br />
WELL WITH THE PROBLEMS OF ISOLATION$ YOUR PROSPERITY IS<br />
GUARANTEED BY-VAST NATURAL RESOURCES AND THE UNIQUESPIRIT<br />
OF YOUR PEOPLE. AUSTRALIANS EVERYWHERE RESPECT'.<br />
THE VIGOR, THE FORTITUDE, THE STRONG COMMUNAL PRIDEI FOR<br />
WHiICH MT. ISA IS FAMOUS.<br />
2. FROM THE BEGINNING my GOVERNMENT HAS-GIVEN<br />
THE HIGHEST PRIORITY TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF NORTHERN,<br />
AUSTRALIA, WE CREATED A DEPARTMENT OF NORTHERN DEVELOPMENT.<br />
HEADED BY MY COLLEAGUE REX PATTERSON. WE ESTABLISHED THE<br />
NORTHERN DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL. WE ARE UNDERTAKING A<br />
THOROUGH STUDY OF THE DEVELOPMENT PROSPECTS OF THE NOR TH-WEST<br />
OF QUEENS. ND STRETCHING FROM MOUNT ISA TO THE GULF OF<br />
CARPENTARIA A REGION WITH GREAT BEEF AND FISHERIES<br />
POTENTIAL AND RICH IN MINERALS INCLUDING LEAD, ZINC, COPPER,<br />
URANIUM AND PHOSPHATES.' THE STUDY WILL HELP US INTEGRATE ALL<br />
INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT IN THE REGION, RATIONALISE TRANSPORT<br />
U COSTS AND CO-ORDINATE THE PROVISION OF POWER AND ESSENTIAL<br />
PUBL SERVICES. PROPER DEVELOPMENT OF YOUR WATER RESOURCES<br />
IS ESSENTIAL TO THE FUTUR . E OF MT. ISA. WE HAVE RECOGNISED<br />
THAT NEED. ON 11 APRIL 1" 4 AN AGREEMENT WAS SIGNED BETWEEN<br />
THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT AND THE OtIEENSLAND GOVERNMENT<br />
FOR A LOAN UP TO $ 2 MILLION TO COVER ADDITIONAL COSTS TO<br />
BUILD THE JULIUS DAM FOR THE MT. ISA. WATER SUPPLY. THE<br />
AGREEMENT WAS IN RESPONSE TO A REQUEST BY THE PREM. IER TO<br />
THE PREVIOUS GOVERNMENT UNDER THE OLD NATIONAL WATER RESOURCES<br />
DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM. 2/ </p>
<p>2<br />
LEGISLATION AUTHORISING THE LOAN HAS BEEN PASSED BY THE<br />
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES. A FURTHER REQUEST FOR $ 14.8 MILLION TO COVER THE<br />
MT. ISA CITY COUNCIL'S SHARE OF THE COST OF THE DAM IS TO BE<br />
DISCUSSED AT THE NEXT MEETING OF THE SCREENING COMMITTEE OF<br />
THE NATIONAL WATER PROGRAM. I KNOW OF YOUR DEEP CONCERN<br />
ABOUT THIS PROJECT. MR JACK SHEPHERD, THE LABOR CANDIDATE<br />
AND ALD. TONY MCGRADY HAVE MADE STRONG REPRESENTATIONS<br />
TO THE GOVERNMENT ABOUT THE SCHEME. THE GOVERNMENT WILL<br />
DO ALL IT CAN TO SEE THAT DAM IS COMPLETED QUICKLY.<br />
4I. WE WANT TO ENSURE THE PROPER DEVELOPMENT OF<br />
MT. ISA'S MINERAL RESOURCES COPPER, LEAD, ZINC AND<br />
PHOSPHATES. IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT-THESE RESOURCES ARE<br />
EFFICIENTLY TRANSPORTED TO COASTAL PORTS, SMELTERS OR<br />
REFINERIES AND MY COLLEAGUE REX CONNOR IS CONSIDERING<br />
A PROPOSAL TO UPGRADE THE RAILWAY BETWEEN DUCHESS<br />
MILES ' ITH OF PIT. ISA) AND TOWNSVILLE. THE EXISTING LINE<br />
IS BEING V -D TO CAPACITY AND IS SUBJECT TO FLOODING.-<br />
RECONSTRUCTION OF THE LINE SHOULD MAKE POSSIBLE A<br />
SUBSTANTIAL INCREASE-IN PHOSPHATE PRODUCTION. AT PRESENT<br />
AUSTRALIA IMPORTS 2.8 MILLION TONS OF PHOSPHATE A YEAR.<br />
THE 6OVERNMENT BELIEVES PHOSPHATES COULD BECOME ONE OF<br />
OL' MAJOR MINERAL EXPORTS, PERHAPS OUTSTRIPPING LEAD,<br />
COPPL,. AND ZINC. SUCH AN INDUSTRY WILL SUBSTANTIALLY<br />
ASSIST " R BALANCE OF PAYMENTS, INCREASED PHOSPHATE<br />
SUPPLIES WILL ENABLE" US TO BOOST PRODUCTION OF WHEAT<br />
AND OTHER GRAINS. 93/ t </p>
<p>To FURTHER IMPROVE MT. ISA'S TRANSPORT LINKS.<br />
THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT WILL HELP BUILD THE LANDSBOROUGH<br />
HIGHWAY FROM MT. ISA TO BRISBANE AS A FULL-SCALE ALL<br />
WEATHER ROAD. THIS ROAD WILL BE PART OF OUR NATIONAL<br />
HIGHWAYS PROGRAM, FOR WHICH WE ARE PROVIDING $ 1.126 MILLION<br />
TO THE STATES OVER THE NEXT THREE YEARS. MT. ISA WILL<br />
S THUS BE LINKED EVENTUALLY BY FIRST-CLASS HIGHWAYS TO<br />
BRISBANE, SYDNEY AND MELBOURNE. NO STATE GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN<br />
ABLE TO BUILD THIS HIGHWAY SYSTEM DESPITE THE MILLIONS<br />
OF DOLLARS THEY HAVE RECEIVED FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT<br />
FOR ROADS, MY GOVERNMENT WILL SEE THE JOB IS DONE:. I KNOW<br />
PARTS OF THE EXISTING ROAD FROM MT. ISA TO BRISBANE ARE<br />
-IN BAD REPAIR. As FAR AS POSSIBLE WE WILL GIVE PRIORITY<br />
TO THESE SECTIONS. WE WILL SPEND $ 24 MILLION IN QUEENSLAND ON<br />
NORTHERN BEEF EXPORT ROADS OVER THE NEXT THREE YEARS.<br />
IT IS WORTH RECALLING THAT THE BJELKE-PETERSEN GOVERNMENT<br />
PROM " D IN 1972 TO MAKE ALL QUEENSLAND STATE HIGHWAYS FULL<br />
BITUMEN OfS BY 1975. THIS WILL NOT BE DONE. THE BITUMEN<br />
SURFACE OF THE FLINDERS HIGHWAY FROM MiT. ISA TO TOWNSVILLE<br />
NOW HAS A TARGET DATE FOR COMPLETION IN 1976.<br />
6. THE LABOR GOVERNMENT WANTS EVERY CITY AND<br />
RFGION TO PROVIDE AMENITIES AND SERVICES TO ITS CITIZENS<br />
CO., F ABLE' WITH THE BEST IN . AUSTRALIA. TO' REDUCE INEQUALITIES<br />
BEThCEN REGIONS WE EMPOWERED THE GRANTS COMMISSION TO<br />
RECOMMEND " ANTS FOR. LOCAL GOVERNMENT BODIES ON THE BASIS OF<br />
COMPARATIVE NEED. MT. ISA IS RECEIVING $ 250,000 FROM THE<br />
GRANTS COMMISSION AND CLONCURRY $ 86,000. 3114/ 11111 </p>
<p>7. THESE GRANTS ARE HEAVILY IN FAVOUR OF RURAL<br />
AREAS. BRISBANE HAS RECEIVED $ 3.12 A HEAD FROM THE GRANTS<br />
COMMISSION GRANTS, WHILE RURAL AND PROVINCIAL CITIES<br />
AND COUNCILS ARE RECEIVING $ 6.23 A HEAD. THIS GIVES THE<br />
LIE TO ANY CLAIM THAT WE ARE FAVORING URBAN AREAS AT<br />
THE EXPENSE OF THE COUNTRY DWELLER. WE ARE MAKING BIG<br />
GRANTS FOR SPORTING AND RECREATION FACILITIES IN QUEENSLAND<br />
CITIES. MT. ISA IS RECEIVING $ 115,000 FOR A COMMUNITY<br />
RECREATION CENTRE. THIS IS EASILY THE BIGGEST SINGLE<br />
GRANT FOR A QUEENSLAND CITY FOR THIS PURPOSE, TOTAL SPORTING<br />
GRANTS TO QUEENSLAND AMOUNT TO $ 536,200.<br />
8. A REGIONAL OFFICE OF THE DEPARTMENT OF<br />
SOCIAL SECURITY WILL BE OPENED AT MT. ISA AS SOON AS<br />
POSSIBLE PROBABLY BEFORE 30 JUNE NEXT YEAR.<br />
THE MINISTER FOR SOCIAL SECURITY, MR BILL<br />
HAYDEN, AND HIS DEPARTMENT ARE KEENLY AWARE OF THE<br />
DIFFICULTIES FACING RESIDENTS OF MT. ISA CLAIMING PENSIONS<br />
AND BPNIFEFITS. A SOCIAL WORKER WILL BE INCLUDED AMONG THE<br />
STAFF Ot-TH' MT. ISA OFFICE. THERE ARE 340 AGED PENSIONERS,<br />
133 INVALID PENSIONERS, 123 WIDOW PENSIONERS, AND 3,929<br />
FAMILIES RECEIVING CHILD ENDOWMENT PAYMENTS IN THE AREA.<br />
9. THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT. IS CONSIDERING AN<br />
APDLICATION FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE FOR A 34-BED HOSTEL FOR<br />
THL " RE OF AGED PEOPLE IN MT. ISA. THE APPLICATION IS ON<br />
BEHALF OF THE MT. ISA MEMORIAL GARDEN SETTLEMENT FOR THE AGED.<br />
THE PROP. TO ERECT THE GARDEN SETTLEMENT HAS BEEN HEAVILY<br />
SUPPORTED BY K. ISA MINES AND THE UNIONS. THE ESTIMATED<br />
COST OF THE PROJECT IS +-371,000, DISCUSSIONS ARE TAKING<br />
PLACE BETWEEN THE MEMORIAL GARDEN SETTLEMENT ORGANISATION<br />
AND THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SECURITY TO ARRANGE THE<br />
TRANSFER OF HOSTEL BED ENTITLEMENT FROM ANOTHER ORGANISATION<br />
TO ENABLE A GRANT TO BE MA'DE UNDER THE AGED PERSONS HOSTEL ACT<br />
WHEN THE RELEVANT LEGISLATION HAS BEEN PASSED. </p>
<p>ABOUT $ 170,000 HAS BEEN RAISED FOR THE PROJECT<br />
IN THE NT. ISA AREA. THIS IS A TREMENDOUS EFFORT, MR<br />
HAYDEN HAS INSTRUCTED THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SECURITY<br />
TO GOVE THE FULLEST POSSIBLE SUPPORT TO THE PROJECT.<br />
MY COLLEAGUE LIONEL MURPHY, THE ATTORNEYGENERAL,<br />
ANNOUNCED YESTERDAY THAT ONE OF TWO NEW REGIONAL<br />
BRANCHES IN QUEENSLAND OF THE LEGAL AID SERVICE WILL<br />
BE AT MT. ISA.<br />
11. ALTHOUGH RURAL ELECTRICITY COSTS IN QUEENSLAND<br />
ARE THE HIGHEST IN ALL THE EASTERN STATES,' THE BJELKEPETERSEN<br />
GOVERNMENT HAS REFUSED TO CO-OPERATE WITH US IN<br />
SEEKING WAYS TO REDUCE THESE COSTS. HIGH ELECTRICITY COSTS<br />
HELP PUSH UP PRICES OVER A WIDE RANGE OF GOODS AND SERVICES.<br />
THE BJELKr--PETERSEN GOVERNMENT REFUSES TO USE ITS WIDE<br />
POWERS TO CONTROL PRICES AND RESISTED OUR ATTEMPTS TO<br />
OBTAIN COMMONWEALTH POWER OVER PRICES BY REFERENDUM.<br />
THE PEOPLE OF MT. ISA VOTED YES IN THE PRICES REFERENDUM LAST<br />
YEAR. THE BJELKE-PETERSEN GOVERNMENT HAS IGNORED THEIR<br />
EXPRES-9) WISH FOR GOVERNMENT ACTION TO RESTRAIN PRICES.<br />
12. THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN OVERWHELMINGLY<br />
GENEROUS TO QUEENSLAND IN ITS FINANCIAL ALLOCATIONS.<br />
QUEENSLAND HAS RECEIVED MORE FROM US THAN IT HAS RECEIVED<br />
FROM ANY PREVIOUS GOVERNMENT IN CANBERRA, OUR TOTAL PAYMENTS<br />
TO QUFENSLAND IN THE LAST FINANCIAL YEAR WERE $ 739 MILLION<br />
-OR $ 382 PER HEAD COMPARED WITH AVERAGE PAYMENTS TO ALL<br />
STATES 3L5 PER HEAD. </p>
<p>6<br />
13. I HAVE DRAWN ATTENTION TO MR BJELKE-PETERSEN'S<br />
OBSTINATE REFUSAL TO CO-OPERATE WITH US IN PROJECTS FOR<br />
THE DEVELOPMENT OF QUEENSLAND AND THE BENEFIT OF HER<br />
CITIZENS. HE HAS SPURNED OUR EFFORTS TO MAKE TOWNSVILLE<br />
A GROWTH J. EHE HAS. SPURNED 0UeR--&amp; F-FVNDS FOR LAND<br />
STABILISATION, HE HAS REFUSED TO HOLD DISCUSSIONS ON<br />
OUR OFFER OF FUNDS FOR ABORIGINAL ADVANCEMENT. MR<br />
BJELKE-PETERSEN HAS THROWN AWAY $ 50 MILLION IN FEDERAL<br />
FUNDS FOR THIS STATE. HIS ATTITUDE IS AT ODDS . WITH<br />
THAT OF ALL THE LIBERAL PREMIERS AND ON MANY ISSUES, SUCH<br />
AS ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS, WITH THE ATTITUDE OF A FORMER<br />
LIBERAL PRIME MINISTER, MR GORTON.<br />
14., QUEENSLAND'S ELECTORAL BOUNDARIES ARE FLAGRANTLY<br />
RIGGED AGAINST LABOR, IT IS NOT JUST BRISBANE VOTERS WHO<br />
ARE DISADVANTAGED BUT PEOPLE IN PROVINCIAL CITIES LIKE<br />
MT. ISA. HERE YOU HAVE 16,002 ELECTORS', THAT IS ALMOST<br />
EXACTLY THE SAME AS THE AVERAGE ENROLMENT IN BRISBANE<br />
SE" TS ( 16,059). You HAVE CONSIDERABLY MORE THAN THE AVERAGE<br />
NUMB-ELECTORS ENROLLED IN ALL PROVIIICIAL CITY SEATS<br />
( 15,510), MUCH MORE THAN THE AVERAGE IN THE COUNTRY ZONE<br />
( 11,215), AND NEARLY TWICE THE AVERAGE NUMBER IN THE<br />
WESTERN AND FPR NORTHERN ZONE fr; ISA PfCf"-;.<br />
ARE PRIME VICTIMS OF 1iR LJELKE-' ETEkSEN'S SCANDALOUS<br />
GERRYMANDERING, </p>
