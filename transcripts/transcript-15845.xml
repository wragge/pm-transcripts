    <content><![CDATA[<p>Closing the life expectancy gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians is a core priority of the Government I lead.</p>
<p>That is why on the first working day of every parliamentary year that I am Prime Minister, I will report to the Parliament on the progress my Government has made closing the gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians.</p>
<p>This annual Prime Ministerial statement on closing the gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians will report on;</p>
<p>     * Progress in closing the life expectancy gap;</p>
<p>     * Progress in closing the gap on infant mortality and mortality of children up to five years of age; and</p>
<p>     * Progress on closing the literacy and numeracy gap.</p>
<p>There is no reason that the Australia of today, a successful developed nation with a modern and prosperous economy, should accept a 17 year life expectancy gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians.</p>
<p>There is no reason that Indigenous children in Australia should have less opportunity for education or health care then the opportunities provided to non-Indigenous kids.</p>
<p>This gap has no place in a modern Australia.</p>
<p>Each year we must know as a Government, as a people, and as a country if we had made progress closing this gap.</p>
<p>Every leader knows that accountability brings with it the risk of criticism of failure, as the Prime Minister of Australia I accept that risk.</p>
