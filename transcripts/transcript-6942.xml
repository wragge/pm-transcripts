PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 2 JUNE 1986<br />
The most recent economic statistics, notably the March<br />
quarter National Accounts and the ABS Survey of Investment<br />
Intentions graphically highlight the magnitude of the<br />
economic task before Australia.<br />
While no major change in direction is required the<br />
statistics provide further confirmation of the need for some<br />
modifications to our already successful policy to meet the<br />
new challenge presented by world trading conditions.<br />
They also show clearly that the co-operation of all sections<br />
of the community will be required if we are to continue to<br />
prosper in these conditions.<br />
In the Government's view discussions at ACPI will be most<br />
fruitful if both the outcome of the NWC and the details of<br />
proposed modifications to the Government's policy stance are<br />
known to participants in advance.<br />
This view is also now shared by representatives of business<br />
and the ACTU.<br />
Accordingly, with the agreement of these participants, the<br />
meeting of the Advisory Committee on Prices and Incomes<br />
scheduled for this Thursday has been postponed.<br />
The meeting will now occur after the Conciliation and<br />
Arbitration Commssion has announced its decisions following<br />
the current national wage case hearings.<br />
In the meantime the Government will be consulting separately<br />
over the course of the next week with representatives of<br />
the business sector and the ACTIJ in informing its judgements<br />
of the scope which exists for action by Government, business<br />
and workers alike.<br />
I will next week in an Address to the Nation share with the<br />
people of Australia the Government's approach and decisions<br />
which we regard as necessary to protect and advance the<br />
interests of this community in the economic circumstances<br />
confronting us. </p>
