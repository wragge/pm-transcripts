PRIME MINISTER'S STATEMENT TO THE HOUSE ON DEATH OF<br />
LEBANESE PRESIDENT RENE MUAWAD<br />
23 November 1989<br />
MR SPEAKER, I SEEK LEAVE TO MAKE A STATEMENT TO THE<br />
HOUSE. HONOURABLE MEMBERS WILL BE AWARE OF THE TRAGIC EVENTS<br />
WHICH HAVE TAKEN PLACE IN LEBANON OVERNIGHT WITH THE<br />
BRUTAL ASSASSINATION OF THE NEWLY ELECTED LEBANESE<br />
PRESIDENT, MR RENE MUAWAD, AND THE DEATH OF AT LEAST<br />
TWENTY OTHERS.<br />
ON BEHALF OF THE GOVERNMENT AND PEOPLE OF AUSTRALIA, AND<br />
ON BAHAIF OF ALL MEMBERS OF THIS PARLIAMENT, I EXTEND MY<br />
DEEPEST SYMPATHY TO MR MUAWAD'S WIFE AND FAMILY AND TO<br />
THE FAMILIES OF THOSE WHO WERE KILLED WITH HIM. THE<br />
FACT THAT THIS BRUTAL MURDER TOOK PLACE ON LEBANON'S<br />
NATIONAL DAY ONLY HEIGHTENS OUR SENSE OF OUTRAGE AT SUCH<br />
A CALLOUS ACT.<br />
MR MUAWAD'S DEATH COMES A MERE SEVENTEEN DAYS AFTER HIS<br />
ELECTION AS PRESIDENT AT A SESSION OF THE LEBANESE<br />
PARLIAMENT. THAT SAME SESSION OF PARLIAMENT ALSO<br />
RATIFIED THE AGREEMENT OF NATIONAL RECONCILIATION<br />
REACHED AT TAIF IN SAUDI ARABIA BY A MEETING OF LEBANESE<br />
MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT. </p>
<p>THE TAIF AGREEMENT WAS SEEN AS A HISTORIC BREAK-THROUGH<br />
IN THE SEARCH FOR A NEGOTIATED SETTLEMENT TO THE<br />
UNDERLYING PROBLEMS WHICH HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE TRAGIC<br />
CYCLE OF VIOLENCE IN LEBANON OVER THE PAST FOURTEEN<br />
YEARS. AUSTRALIA AND OTHER WESTERN COUNTRIES HAVE<br />
CONSISTENTLY SUPPORTED THE ARAB LEAGUE NEGOTIATIONS<br />
WHICH LED TO THE AGREEMENT. THE TAIF AGREEMENT<br />
RECOMMENDED A SET OF POLITICAL REFORMS, SUPPORTED BY<br />
REPRESENTATIVES OF ALL COMMUNITIES IN LEBANON AND AIMED<br />
AT CREATING THE CONDITIONS FOR THE RESTORATION OF<br />
LEBANON'S TERRITORIAL INTEGRITY, UNITY AND SOVEREIGNTY.<br />
THE GOAL WAS TO REBUILD A FREE AND INDEPENDENT LEBANON<br />
IN WHICH PEOPLE OF ALL BELIEFS COULD LIVE IN PEACE AND<br />
CONTRIBUTE TO THE NATION'S PROSPERITY AND DEVELOPMENT.<br />
IT TOOK IMMENSE COURAGE ON THE PART OF THE MEMBERS OF<br />
THE LEBANESE PARLIAMENT TO COME TOGETHER AND NEGOTIATE<br />
AN AGREEMENT FOR THE BENEFIT OF ALL LEBANESE IN THE FACE<br />
OF BRUTAL THREATS.<br />
MR MUAWAD WAS A MAN COMMITTED TO PEACE AND HIS<br />
PREPAREDNESS TO STAND FOR THE PRESIDENCY WAS TESTIMONY<br />
TO HIS COURAGE. AS HE SAID IN A SPEECH FOLLOWING HIS<br />
ELECTION: I AM ONE OF YOU AND YOU KNOW ME AS A MAN OF<br />
RECONCILIATION, DEDICATED TO THE CONCEPT OF UNITY; </p>
<p>A MAN WHO HAS GAMBLED HIS LIFE IN RETURN FOR THE<br />
RECONCILIATION OF ALL LEBANESE, IRRESPECTIVE OF<br />
THEIR PERSUASION. RECONCILIATION EXCLUDES NOBODY,<br />
EVEN THOSE WHO INSIST ON EXCLUDING THEMSELVES.<br />
RECONCILIATION IS FOR ALL AND CAN ACCOMMODATE ALL.<br />
LET US HOPE THAT PRESIDENT MUAWAD, LIKE THE LEGIONS OF<br />
OTHER LEBANESE VICTIMS OF THE VIOLENCE, DID NOT DIE IN<br />
VAIN. LET US HOPE THAT THERE ARE OTHER LEBANESE WITH<br />
THE COURAGE TO CONTINUE THE PROCESS BEGUN AT TAIF.<br />
MR MUAWAD'S DEATH WILL BE A SIGNIFICANT SET-BACK TO<br />
LEBANON'S SEARCH FOR PEACE AND STABILITY AND MAY IGNITE<br />
FURTHER CONFLICT. IT IS NOW UP TO THOSE REMAINING IN<br />
THE LEBANESE PARLIAMENT TO RESCUE THE TAIF AGREEMENT.<br />
TRAGICALLY THAT TASK HAS BEEN MADE MUCH MORE DIFFICULT<br />
BY PRESIDENT MUAWAD'S DEATH.<br />
ONLY YESTERDAY I PLANTED A CEDAR TREE IN COMMEMORATION<br />
OF THE LEBANESE NATIONAL DAY AND POINTED TO THE TAIF<br />
AGREEMENT AND MR MUAWAD'S ELECTION AS THE MOST PROMISING<br />
SIGNS OF PEACE IN LEBANON FOR A LONG TIME. TODAY, IN<br />
THE FACE OF THE APPALLING EVENTS OF LAST NIGHT I CAN<br />
ONLY REPEAT, IN SADNESS, THE CALL I MADE YESTERDAY IN<br />
HOPE, FOR ALL PARTIES IN LEBANON TO CO-OPERATE IN THE<br />
PROCESS OF NATIONAL RECONCILIATION; TO BRING ABOUT A<br />
POLITICAL SETTLEMENT WHICH WILL ENABLE MUSLIMS AND </p>
<p>CHRISTIANS TO LIVE SIDE-BY-SIDE IN PEACE.<br />
MY THOUGHTS ARE WITH THE AUSTRALIAN LEBANESE COMMUNITY<br />
WHO ONLY YESTERDAY WERE CELEBRATING LEBANON'S<br />
INDEPENDENCE DAY AND THE PROMISING SIGNS OF HOPE FOR THE<br />
FUTURE. THOSE HOPES HAVE BEEN SERIOUSLY SET BACK, BUT<br />
NOT DESTROYED. IT IS CLEARER THAN EVER TODAY THAT THE<br />
ONLY LASTING SOLUTION TO THE LEBANESE CONFLICT WILL BE A<br />
NEGOTIATED POLITICAL ONE. A CONTINUATION OF THE CYCLE<br />
OF VIOLENCE WILL SOLVE NOTHING.<br />
I CALL ON ALL LEBANESE AND OTHERS INVOLVED IN THAT<br />
COUNTRY'S CRISIS TO EXERCISE RESTRAINT AND TO TRY AGAIN<br />
TO REBUILD THE PROCESS BEGUN AT TAIF. </p>
