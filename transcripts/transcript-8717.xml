STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING MP<br />
LIBERALS PUT RECOVERY AT RISK<br />
The industrial stoppage in Victoria is a tragedy for the State<br />
and a cause for great concer~ n for all Australians.<br />
This is a time when all Australians of good will are<br />
determined to work together to maintain the momentum of<br />
recovery. We are attempting to rebuild the prosperity of Australia anld<br />
restore the jobs lost in the recession. The world is not<br />
helping us in this. Success depends on our faith in ourselves<br />
and our fellow Australians.<br />
At this crucial moment the Victorian Government has decided to<br />
deliver chaos.<br />
Mr Kennett and Mr Gude have tried to portray today's strike as<br />
an example of union bloody -mindedness.<br />
Australians know this is not true. The disruption in Victoria<br />
has been caused by the extraordinarily destructive and<br />
dishonest actions of Mr Kennett and Mr Gude since the<br />
Victorian election.<br />
The Victorian Governmeunt's aictions go well beyond their<br />
electoral ana~ Le*. They also go well beyond economic common<br />
sornse, a nd thFe bounds of fairniess and decency on which<br />
Australlian democracy is built.<br />
They constitute an attack on basic liberties as well as wages<br />
and conditions.<br />
That is why Victorians are protesting today, and why so many<br />
Australians share their anxiety.<br />
In the past ten years we have seen a dramatic change in the<br />
way Australians conduct their industrial relations.<br />
In spirit and practice cooperation is replacing the habitual<br />
conflict which for so long dragged us down.<br />
This year the number of industrial disputes is the lowest for<br />
thirty years.<br />
And then along comes Mr Kennett. In one month he has returned<br />
Victoria to the politics of rancour and revenge.<br />
