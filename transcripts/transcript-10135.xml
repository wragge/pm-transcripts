16 October 1996 TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
THE HON. JOHN HOWARD MP<br />
RADIO NATIONAL AM PROGRAMME PRU GO WARD<br />
E OE<br />
GOWARD: Prime Minister welcome. You say that people with share holdings shouldn't be fightened out of<br />
going into parliament, thus the need for blind trusts. Shouldn't you have thought of that before<br />
two Ministers had to go?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
( inaudible) but it's a pretty funny sort of political leadership that just sort of sits on a static<br />
position and never responds to circumstances. The truth is that the two people have resigned.<br />
Look I'm sorry I'm getting feedback from this telephone, anyway I'll keep going. The truth of<br />
the matter is that two people have resigned because of their inadvertence in not paying attention<br />
to the detail of the guidelines. There has been, at no stage, any suggestion of dishonesty or<br />
impropriety of any kind on their part. What is involved, or what was involved, in both cases was<br />
the appearance of a potential conflict of interest. There was never any real conflict of interest in<br />
the sense that they knew they were directly enriching themselves from the decisions they were<br />
taking. It just looked as though they oughtn't to be taking a decision that effected a big public<br />
company in each case in which they respectively held relatively small parcels of shares.<br />
GOWARD: Yes, Prime Minister, the proposal of blind trusts though, what does that solve when Ministers,<br />
certainly when they start out, know they've got some blue chip stocks for example, BHP, and<br />
they'd have not expected even an independent person to sell them off and would that have really<br />
resolved the blind trust proposal? </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well if I could just finish the previous answer. The situation is that in no case was there anything<br />
other than an appearance of a conflict of interest. There was, in fact, no direct enrichment and I<br />
think that point has to be emphasised. Now what I say should now be examined is the possibility<br />
that as an addition to or a supplementation or a variation of the existing guidelines, which<br />
incidentally have operated for about twenty years, is the possibility of having a blind trust<br />
arrangement whereby a Minister who's got some shares, when he or she becomes a Minister puts<br />
those shares into the hands of a trustee and that trustee runs the investment without reference to<br />
the Minister including the sale of shares in the portfolio and the acquisition of others and at the<br />
end of the day merely renders a profit or the loss out of his administration of the shares. And in<br />
that way a person can be kept at arms length from the ownership of the shares. But by the same<br />
token, if I could finish.., would not be required to divest.<br />
GO WARD:<br />
But what does it solve when the Minister would have known that if you've got shares in BH-P that<br />
the trustee is very unlikely to sell them?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well you don't know, I mean, you don't know. Pmu I'm not saying that we will definitely adopt<br />
this system. I'm just going to investigate it and in the mean time the existing guidelines, of<br />
course, remain on foot. Of course there may, as a result of the investigation, I may decide that<br />
it's not worth it. But I do think that we do need to avoid the situation arising where, however<br />
remote the connection, just because you own a share.... let me put it this way, let me pose a<br />
rhetorical question do we want a situation where Cabinet Ministers in this country and<br />
Parliamentary Secretaries who incidentally are not highly remunerated who get just an allowance<br />
to cover expenses, they're in a different position from Cabinet Ministers do we want to get to a<br />
situation in this country where no matter what your position you can't hold a share in anything?<br />
GO WARD:<br />
But Prime Minister doesn't that suggest that your guidelines, if they're not too tough, have<br />
certainly been too narrow? that's the question.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
People argue that my guidelines may be too tough but of course nobody argued that when the<br />
guidelines were put out. People might argue it now, but nobody said when I published those<br />
guidelines and nobody privately said to me look I think these guidelines are too tough. I accept<br />
some people might see them as too tough. 2 </p>
<p>GO WARD:<br />
What do you think Prime Minister?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well I do think the operation has thrown up this situation where, you know, not matter what your<br />
share holding is and no matter how remote it is I mean, you take somebody like Tim Fischer<br />
who's involved, he's got responsibility for trade, you could argue that every single publicly listed<br />
company in Australia in some way has a connection with trade because it has the potential to<br />
export or it has the potential to produce something for competition against imports. So in that<br />
sense you're saying he shouldn't own shares in anything but that would be plainly ridiculous.<br />
GO WARD:<br />
Prime Minister are you frustrated with your Ministry. I mean, ever since John Anderson had this<br />
problem early on and divested they should all have known that this was coming. I mean, isn't it a<br />
terrible comment on your Ministry that they didn't take your guidelines seriously?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well I don't think it's a terrible comment on my ministry as a whole because a large number of<br />
them don't have any shares, or if they do have share holdings there's absolutely no suggestion of<br />
any technical breach. I mean, neither Short nor Gibson, I repeat again, did anything wrong. They<br />
didn't profit, they weren't venal in any way. They were in technical breach of the guidelines and<br />
they had to go. Now of course they should have paid greater attention to the detail and I wished<br />
it hadn't happened but that feeling of course doesn't extend to the entire ministry it would be<br />
plainly unreasonable. In the atmosphere that an event like this generates you'll always get<br />
ridiculous charges levelled against some people such as the attack on Tanya Costello who'd<br />
bought some Commonwealth Bank shares out of her own money and plainly her husband was not<br />
in breach of the guidelines. He'd read them very carefully and he did everything exactly as<br />
requested by the guidelines. But that didn't stop him being attacked. It didn't stop the press<br />
putting his photograph and his wife's photograph on the front page and it didn't stop one<br />
newspaper saying that his wife's ownership of the shares had suddenly been revealed when in fact<br />
her husband put them on the public register two and a half years ago.<br />
GO WARD:<br />
Prime Minister, looking specifically at John Moore who, as you know, is in the spotlight the<br />
report of Bligh investments to the stock exchange makes it clear that Bligh investments have<br />
investments basically in four companies. It declares its main interest to be management. One of<br />
the holdings is as large as 25% and there are at least three sets of common directorships, some<br />
common directorships. Doesn't that suggest that it isn't a hands off superannuation type<br />
operation and that it is necessary to look at the Minister's decisions in acts which might effect the<br />
operations of those four companies? </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well I don't think so. The question is whether it compiies with the guidelines. I mean, if people<br />
have been required to go because of their non-compliance with the guidelines, equally it's not<br />
reasonable to say that people who have compled with the guidelines oughtn't to go. Now Moore<br />
has tried to sell those investments in Bligh since he became a Minister. He sold some of them<br />
it's a very liquid market. But he is not, I repeat, not in breach of the guidelines because the shares<br />
that he owns are not in the companies that are operating in his area of portfolio responsibility.<br />
GO WARD:<br />
What computer software and hardware Prime Minister?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Doesn't own shares in those companies, I repeat, he doesn't own shares in those companies.<br />
GO WARD:<br />
But Bligh Ventures has a very substantial parcel, I mean 18% in J-Tech, 25% in point of sale<br />
technology and RSM?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Because I've had them read out to me before. Please, I simply make the point that in no case is<br />
there a controlling interest held. He holds two per cent in company A, which in turn holds a noncontrolling<br />
interest, a minority interest, in these other companies. To fix him with responsibility<br />
for decisions that are taken in relation to those other companies is to stretch the guidelines beyond<br />
their means. Now you might argue that it should be otherwise but if we're talking about<br />
compliance with the guidelines, he doesn't breach the guidelines and he has altered his affairs so<br />
that he doesn't and that is why I think the claims that he ought to go should be resisted and they<br />
will be resisted. If I was satisfied that he was breaching the guidelines it would be a different<br />
matter, but I don't believe he is.<br />
GO WARD:<br />
Prime Minister what is your assessment of the damage this has done the Government and even<br />
yourself in the last few days?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I didn't hear anybody saying that the guidelines should be different when they came out. I<br />
certainly didn't hear people from the Opposition, I didn't see you people from the media saying<br />
when the guidelines were published they should have been stronger or weaker. I will just apply </p>
<p>the guidelines as I understand their plain meaning and in the case of John Moore the plain<br />
meaning of the guidelines is that he hasn't breached them.<br />
GOWARD: Prime Minister the by-election to the seat of Lindsay on the weekend. How much damage do you<br />
think the events of the last few days will do your candidate Jackie Kelly's chances in that seat?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, I suppose we'll know that on Saturday night. I think it is always difficult in issues that<br />
don't involve any wrong-doing, don't involve any personal profit, don't involve any decisions that<br />
have hurt voters, and don't involve any deliberate attempt to deceive, but you get a lot of focus<br />
from the Canberra Press Gallery and from the political media, it is very difficult to know whether<br />
those issues have much of an impact out in the electorate. Because the electorate is pretty smart.<br />
I mean, if it sees that somebody's being dishonest or being a phoney they'll react, until they are<br />
satisfied.... but I just really don't know and I think we'll just know on Saturday night.<br />
GO WARD:<br />
And Prime Minister, your assessment of the damage that these affairs might have done your own<br />
standing in the community?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, that's for other people to judge. People take a long view. They don't just judge a person<br />
on one incident or one set of incidents. I've not behaved in any way improperly. I don't think<br />
anyone is suggesting that and none of my colleagues have. I would rather the events of the past<br />
week hadn't happened but anybody who thinks that you can become Prime Minister, you can be<br />
in Government for seven or eight months without something at some stage occurring that you'd<br />
rather not occur, is living in fantasy land. Of course you have problems when you are in<br />
Government. It is a question of how you respond to them and it is a question of how frequently<br />
they occur and it is a question of how quickly one returns to the main game. And the Australian<br />
people will make a judgement about me over a three year period. I'm not asking them to judge<br />
me on the events of the last week any more than I would ask them to judge me on the events of<br />
earlier weeks. They'll take a long considered view and just as I said before the last election I<br />
would accept their verdicts. I will happily accept whatever verdict they pass on me, I don't have<br />
pretensions about my position and I've absolutely no doubt that this Government will be a very<br />
solid, for the long haul government. It's got a lot of good quality people in it. I'm very sorry for<br />
what's occurred over the last week, but it hasn't involved any wrongdoing or any cheating or<br />
dishonesty and I think that's what will register with the Australian public.<br />
GO WARD:<br />
Prime Minister thanks for your time this morning. </p>
