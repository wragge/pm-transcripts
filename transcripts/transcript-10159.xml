Industrial Research Organisation ( CSIRO).<br />

Mr Allen has the range of skills and experience essential to undertake the<br />
Chairmanship of Australia's largest research institution. His technlmical<br />
skills and extensive experience in commerce and management will be a<br />
great asset to the CSIRO Board.<br />
