FOR PRESS! P. M. No. 93/ 1968<br />
NEW SOUTH WALES BUSHFIRES<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, Mr. John Gorton<br />
I wish to express on behalf of myself and the<br />
Commonwealth Government sincerest sympathy to those who<br />
have suffered in the New South Wales bushfires.<br />
We have already announced our preparedness<br />
to contribute $ 50, 000 on a dollar for dollar basis with New South<br />
Wales for the relief of personal hardship and distress suffered<br />
by those people affected by the fires.<br />
But the Premier of New South Wales has now told<br />
me that his Government has extended its bushfire relief scheme<br />
to cover the whole of New South Wales. I have assured him that<br />
the Commonwealth Government will extend its previous offer and<br />
will match State contributions to the scheme for relief of personal<br />
hardship and distress resulting from the fires throughout the State.<br />
