    <content><![CDATA[<p>I am pleased to announce the six community business partnerships that have been recognised in the 2006 Prime Minister's Awards for Excellence in Community Business Partnerships for their contribution to the strength and cohesion of Australian communities.</p>
<p> These partnerships strengthen local communities in the areas of outreach, assistance for young people and expanding education opportunities around Australia.</p>
<p>  The Prime Minister's Awards for Excellence in Community Business Partnerships cover five categories, large, medium and small business and two special awards for Impact on a Community and Longevity.</p>
<p> The Large Business Award was presented to the partnership between Alcoa of Australia and Fairbridge Western Australia Inc.</p>
<p> The partnership has led to the revitalisation of an historic Western Australian community, renowned for programmes which develop the skills and talents of local young people.</p>
<p>McGrath Estate Agents and Youth Off the Streets were presented with the Medium Business Award for the partnership's delivery of 20 services to youth at risk in New South Wales.</p>
<p> The services provide a range of care, including outreach services, crisis refuge, drug and alcohol treatment programmes, counselling, accredited high schooling, long-term residential treatment programmes, semi-independent living and mentoring programmes and an aftercare programme.</p>
<p> A partnership between the Waterford Retirement Village Pty Ltd and the Kincumber and District Neighbourhood Centre, which runs a number of community programmes including the Kincumber Brekky Club, was a joint winner in the Small Business Award.</p>
<p> Through the Brekky Club, Kincumber High School students are provided with all important breakfasts and the opportunity to connect with the volunteers three days a week.</p>
<p>Grinders Corporate Catering with North Mackay State High School were also winners in the Small Business Award for a partnership, which addresses the regional shortage of hospitality workers in Mackay, through the catering4futures programme, and demonstrates the success of skills-based training in high schools.</p>
<p>The Special Award for Impact on a Community was won by the ANZ Bank for its significant community involvement covering a suite of programmes and projects with one or more partners.</p>
<p>The ANZ Bank supports communities through Financial Literacy and Inclusion Partnerships, Employee Community Involvement Programmes and other significant partnerships that assist rural and indigenous communities, low income families and help to make poverty history.</p>
<p>The Special Award for Longevity honours longevity in an outstanding partnership which has been operating for more than five years.  This year the award was presented to Shell Companies in Australia with Questacon - The National Science and Technology Centre and The Australian National University.</p>
<p>Over the past 21 years this partnership has been delivering the Shell Questacon Science Circus, which educates children, teachers and communities in regional areas about the possibilities of science and science-related careers. It is one of the world's most recognised outreach programmes.</p>
<p>By working together, all community business partnerships can share valuable knowledge and add value to local communities throughout Australia. They make tangible and positive differences to the people involved and to the communities in which they operate.</p>
<p>I congratulate all of this year's nominees and winners and encourage community and business partnerships not nominated for awards, but which continue to have a positive influence in their local communities, to keep up the good work and take with them these award-winning partnerships' experiences.</p>
<p>Each winning partnership will receive $10,000 towards the extension of their community projects.  </p>
