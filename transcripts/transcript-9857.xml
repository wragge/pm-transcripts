PRIME MINISTER<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
AUSTRALIAN INITIATIVE FOR A NUCLEAR WEAPONS-FREE WORLD<br />
I am pleased to announce the formation of the Canberra Commission on the Elimination of<br />
Nuclear Weapons. I foreshadowed the Commission's establishment in my 24 October 1995<br />
address on Australia and a world without nuclear weapons.<br />
The Commission comprises eminent and outstanding individuals from around the world<br />
statesmen, scientists, disarmament experts and military strategists with extensive knowledge<br />
and experience of the subject matter. They are uniquely placed to bring fresh and imaginative<br />
thinking to this important task. A list of the Commission's members is attached.<br />
The Commission will propose practical steps towards a nuclear weapons-free world including<br />
the related problem of maintaining stability and security during the transitional period and after<br />
this goal is accomplished.<br />
During the current session of the United Nations General Assembly a number of resolutions<br />
have been adopted on nuclear matters which reaffirm broad international support for progress<br />
towards our shared goal of the cessation of nuclear testing and the continuation of the process<br />
of nuclear disarmament leading to the ultimate objective of the complete elimination of nuclear<br />
weapons. The adoption of these resolutions is consistent with the commitment made by 178 nations,<br />
including the five nuclear weapons states, in May this year to the indefinite extension of the<br />
Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons ( NPT), article VI of which commits these<br />
nations to pursue measures towards complete disarmament.<br />
The Canberra Commission and its work will be a major contribution to that shared goal.<br />
Some years ago a Commission of this type would have been a theoretical exercise. But the end<br />
of the Cold War means that we can seriously envisage a concrete program to achieve a world<br />
free of nuclear weapons. Current and planned reductions in nuclear arsenals, the unanimous<br />
decision to extend the NPT, the commitment of the international community to conclude a<br />
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty in 1996 and the international outcry against continued nuclear<br />
testing all show that the time is right to take a fresh look at concepts of security and the role of<br />
nuclear weapons. </p>
<p>The Commission's wide-ranging mandate will enable it to deal with the many complex issues<br />
that need to be taken into account. These include the importance of political motivation and<br />
incentive in strengthening non-proliferation norms and moving to a nuclear weapons-free<br />
world, the role of the nuclear weapon states and threshold states, steps to strengthen<br />
international instruments and control mechanisms, verification arrangements, global and<br />
regional security in the transitional period to a nuclear weapons-free world, and dealing with<br />
possible breaches of commitments often called ' break out' nuclear theft and terrorism.<br />
The Commission will meet three or four times beginning early in the new year in Australia. Its<br />
report will be presented to me by 31 August 1996. The Government intends to submit the<br />
report of the Commission to the 1996 United Nations General Assembly and to the<br />
Conference on Disarmament as a major contribution to nuclear disarmament initiatives<br />
emanating from these bodies.<br />
We should be under no illusions about the difficulty of the task but the opportunity to develop<br />
a practical program leading to complete elimination of nuclear weapons must not be lost.<br />

<p>CANBERRA COMMISSION ON THE ELIMINATION OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS:<br />
PROPOSED MANDATE<br />
The Commission will develop ideas and proposals for a concrete and realistic program to<br />
achieve a world totally free of nuclear weapons. The proliferation of nuclear weapons is<br />
widely recognised as having become the most serious threat to global security , and member<br />
states of the United Nations and the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty ( NPT) have committed<br />
themselves to the objective of a world totally free of nuclear weapons. While various studies<br />
relevant to the achievement of such a world have been and are being conducted, there has been<br />
no attempt to develop a comprehensive and practical answer to the crucial question of how this<br />
objective can be achieved.<br />
The practical steps towards a nuclear weapon free world, to be suggested by the Commission,<br />
will also address the related problem of maintaining stability and security during the<br />
transitional period and after the ultimate goal is accomplished.<br />
The Commission will present a report to the Prime Minister of Australia by 31 August 1996. It<br />
is the Government of Australia's intention to submit the Commission's report to the 51st<br />
Session of the General Assembly of the United Nations and to the Conference on<br />
Disarmament. The Commission will consider and develop recommendations on the following issues:<br />
Identification of concrete and realistic steps for achieving a nuclear weapons free world,<br />
including the development and establishment of necessary verification and control<br />
mechanisms and new international legal obligations. Possible areas of focus include:<br />
the contribution of a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty; Nuclear Weapon Free<br />
Zones; a ' Cut-Off Convention on the cessation of production of fissile material for<br />
nuclear weapons; a possible treaty requiring all states to declare and account for<br />
their present stocks of fissile material; and the strengthening of the international<br />
safeguards system;<br />
carrying through of the commitment by the nuclear weapon states to eliminate<br />
their nuclear stockpiles through a systematic process, including safe and secure<br />
arrangements for weapons dismantlement and destruction; and<br />
the problem of nuclear threshold states and the related issue of achieving universal<br />
participation in the NPT.<br />
Development of durable security arrangements, both globally and regionally, including<br />
the maintenance of a system of stable deterrence while the reduction and eventual<br />
elimination of nuclear weapons is being achieved;<br />
the link with other weapons of mass destruction and their control or elimination;<br />
and measures to prevent break-out, nuclear theft and nuclear terrorism/ criminality.<br />
Other related issues the Commission may identify during its work. </p>
