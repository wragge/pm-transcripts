Dinner in L~ 01C9Df 12thL July 1) 66<br />
Mr. Chairman, Mr. Prime Minister and gentlemen, I have<br />
always looked upon Lord Baillieu as a friend and, indeed, many<br />
of his family are good friends of mine in Australia, and my<br />
heart lifted when he sent his invitation to me to come to dinner<br />
at the Australia Club in London. I'd been to one once before<br />
when my distinguished predecessor was being honoured, as you are<br />
honouring me tonight, and this became a forum in which Sir Robert<br />
Menzies, one of the masters of exposition of our century, stated<br />
so clearly for his country our views and our aspirations. it<br />
is tough enough to have to follow after Bob Menzies but then<br />
tonight our Chairman host brings along one of the most articulate<br />
of Englishmen, who proposes the toast of Australia, and I feel<br />
that this is a difficult path to follow, but fortunately the<br />
salesman doesn't have always to rely upon the line of talk he's<br />
developed. If the product is good enough he can succeed in<br />
getting the product purchased. And tonight you do me the honour<br />
of speaking of Australia, and what finer product can I refer to<br />
in any part of the world? When I was coming across to this<br />
country there were various newspapers which were handed to me to<br />
lighten the burden of travelling across such a large distance of<br />
the Atlantic and here were all sorts of speculations. I expected<br />
to find myself lined up in a sort of confrontation with the Prime<br />
Minister of Great Britain, I almost expected to meet him eyeball<br />
to eyeball I think that's the phrase, but here we are, he<br />
quoted some Australian poetry to me. I hope this practice<br />
doesn't spread. I landed in Washington from Australia the<br />
other day. I'd been given an advance copy of the notes thc<br />
President was likely to employ, they ran over a page and a half.<br />
But a few minutes before we were to speak together I was handed<br />
another set of notes which ran over seven pages and these included<br />
a poem about Australia, " I Love a Sunburnt Country" well I<br />
couldn't draw on my very vast knowledge of poetry to any useful<br />
extent other than to say by way of reply " Say not the struggle<br />
naught avail us". Now perhaps that could apply with equal force<br />
to my embattled colleague, and who carries more responsibilities<br />
on their shoulders in the world today than the Prime Minister of<br />
Great Britain and the President of the United States of America.<br />
For an Australian to come to London in whatever capacity<br />
is a stirring experience; no matter how many times we perform the<br />
visit we find ourselves increasingly drawn and, moved by so many<br />
eviclences of our commuon heritage of history, of democratic<br />
tradition. Our own country, of course, is overwhelmingly a<br />
British country. You've spoken, Prime Minister, of the migration<br />
which has been such a feature of the post-war years. I must<br />
say that while we are out to obtain as many suitable British<br />
migrants as we can, I can't help feeling a sneaking gladness that<br />
your own visit ended with a return to your own country. I say<br />
that because another Prime Minister from Australia might be here<br />
standing in my place this evening. But I can assure you, had<br />
he remained in Australia, and secured the Prime Ministership of<br />
my own country, you would be addressing this audience as a<br />
member oi my own Party. .2 </p>
<p>A very great Englishman who served Australia with great<br />
distinction as a Governor-General and remains a memorable<br />
soldier of your own past, Lord Slim, wrote to me about some<br />
matter recently and the concluding sentence of his letter<br />
ran " what a fascinating time to be Prime Minister of Australia"<br />
and it is a fascinating time because a country to draw out the<br />
finest qualities of its people needs a cause, a stirring cause,<br />
and Australia is fortunate in that we don't have one cause which<br />
stirs the pulse, we have several causes, and I propose to<br />
mention just three oi them here tonight.<br />
You referred to immigration, and that itself has been<br />
for the Australian people a great challenge and a remarkable<br />
accomplishment. It is and history will, I think, establish<br />
this the most remarkable peacetime achievement in the history<br />
of our nation because we have, since the end of the war, welcomed<br />
two million migrants from various parts of the world. They've<br />
become successfully integrated, most of them, in the community<br />
life of our country.<br />
They have contributed notably to its development, they<br />
have improved the food and drink quite significantly ( laughtpr),<br />
and just on half this total have been migrants from these islands,<br />
and I'm glad to say that we continue to attract rather more than<br />
per cent of the total of our migration from here, and this<br />
helps us to sustain the British quality and character of our,<br />
community life. It may interest you to know that of the youing<br />
people in Australia today one in every four is either a migrant<br />
or a child of a migrant, and so the influences which play on us<br />
today are not merely the geographical matters to which you<br />
referred, but the impact of so many different nationalities,.<br />
people seeking to establish a new homeland for themselves, to<br />
build a new life in their adopted country. And the result has<br />
been the greatest era o. f progress in the history of our nation,<br />
a progress which I'm glad to say continues quite briskly and,<br />
on all the evidence, will continue and, indeed, accelerate, in<br />
the years immediately ahead of us.<br />
We have, it may interest you to know, a population<br />
growth rate of just over 2 per cent per annum. The comparable<br />
United Kingdom figure, I hope I quote this one accurately, is<br />
.8 of 1 per cent. if you were required to build houses, say,<br />
in this country, to say nothing of the hospitals, the schools,<br />
and all the other amenities of a civilised community, for a<br />
growth rate of that sort I think you would need to add about<br />
180,000 homes a year to whatever total you are currently<br />
constructing. And this does, of course, place great burdens<br />
on a community of something under 12,000,000 people, particularly<br />
when you bring into your accounting the fact that great<br />
distances have to be traversed, the transportation costs<br />
represent a very high proportion of production costs generally,<br />
but we are absorbing the people and we are succeeding in making<br />
the economic progress.<br />
You mentioned, Prime minister, the position of sterling.<br />
Australia doesn't have to talk about sterling, we act about<br />
sterling, and what greater confidence could be shown in sterling<br />
arnd the future of sterling than by retaining the overwhelming<br />
proportion of our reserves in your own currency. I would<br />
only hope that with so many possibilities opening up for us<br />
which could build an export income capable of adding to those<br />
reserves that, having been assisted so notably over the years<br />
since the war by a substantial inflow of British capital we 3 </p>
<p>shall be able to continue to strengthen your reserves by the<br />
capital necessary to develop our projects. The other matter<br />
which I'd like to mention in this connection is that the economy<br />
as a result of these processes, new employment given to the<br />
migrants, arnd this largely has to be done not on the farmlands,<br />
because they absorb a much smaller proportion of our work force<br />
today than they did a decade ago. They're down, I think now,<br />
to about 9 per cent of work force. But in our manufacturing<br />
industries and in our services the bulk of the addition to the<br />
work force has to be absorbed. But overall we have developed a<br />
highly diversified economy and this was revealed very strikingly<br />
in the last year when we experienced the worst drought our<br />
country has known for just on twenty years. The figures reveal<br />
the extent of it. Over the total sheep population of Australia<br />
we lost just on 8 per cent of our flocks. in New South wales<br />
we lost 25 per cent of our cattle. So that a few years ago,<br />
had this occurred, we would have had a disastrous economic<br />
recession, but, as you've mentioned, we came through the year<br />
with a balanced budget, wie added something to our external<br />
reserves, and the experience demonstrated that Australia today<br />
has so diversified and strengthened the base of its economy<br />
that we can stand up to these hazards which formerly would have<br />
meant major economic setbacks for us. Now we're going to<br />
greatly improve that position in the years which are coming up<br />
because the mineral projects are expected by 1975 to be producing<br />
an export income for us in excess of that which we would secure<br />
from our staple export item, wool.<br />
There are just on 50 major mineral projects either<br />
under way, proposed, or in course of expansion, and we have here<br />
tonight, I notice, Sir George Fisher, who, if he were being<br />
very helpful to you, would tell you what his company proposes<br />
to do with the enormous deposits of lead and zinc that they've<br />
discovered in the MaCarthur River in Queensland. But all<br />
around Australia these days we seem to have opened up a sort<br />
of Pandora's box of mineral wealth, almost every month that<br />
passes by some great now discovery is found and we So ahead<br />
with the process of trying to add an export income from this.<br />
You made reference to our iron ore deposits. Its a few years<br />
ago that we maintained an embargo on the sale of iron ore from<br />
Australia because the disclosed reserves seemed hardly adequate<br />
for our own domestic steel industry, and then they began discovering<br />
iron ore of a grade of 60 or over by the mountainful, and in<br />
Western Australia alone there are now known to be reserves<br />
estimated to be 15,000 and 18,000 million tons of high grade<br />
iron ore. Wa have vast contracts with the Japanese for the<br />
sale of this which will greatly improve our export earnings and,<br />
as you've said, we might even reach to the markets of Europe<br />
arid, indeed, of Great Britain in the course of the next few<br />
years. As to bauxite, our situation is even more impressive<br />
when it comes to resources. We have the world's largest<br />
bauxite deposit at Weipa in North Queensland. You've only<br />
got to XUick the ground with your foot and there it is, and we<br />
do hold, I understand, about half the free world's reserves of<br />
this commodity which is basic, of course, to the ali~. inium<br />
industry. Manganese Broken Hill has got a great deposit<br />
at Groote Island in the North of Australia, nickel has just<br />
been found in Western Australia, apparently in very good<br />
quantity, and that great deficiency that we have had for so<br />
many years, oil, is now being discovered in increasing quantities 4 </p>
<p>and, with this encouragement, we would certainly hope that the<br />
explorers will go on until we become self-sufficient. AS<br />
Barrow Island is added to the existing fields it is estimated<br />
that 9 per cent of our consumption will be home-produced and<br />
we would hope to add to that particular figure quite quickly.<br />
Natural gas, the first attempt made to find natural gas off<br />
the coast of Victoria produced a commercial field, and it should<br />
not be long before the people of my home city are literally<br />
co~ ting with gas but at a very much lower price than the rather<br />
deficient substitute, or at least so-called commodity which<br />
reaches us at this time. That is not libellous, I hope, of<br />
the Melbourne Gas Supply, or slanderous.<br />
The other thing which gives us cause for the stirring<br />
of the pulse is that over recent years for the first time,<br />
significantly I think in our history, we have become very<br />
conscious of the place we occupy in Asia. In my own boyhood,<br />
countries to our north produced a rather picturesque set of<br />
pos~ tage stamps, but we know very little about them other than<br />
that. But in these days we are directly involved in a variety<br />
of ways. We are involved for ffence purposes, we see a rapidly<br />
growing trade with them. We ourselves contribute to aid<br />
programmes in the area, indeed, we can claim to have pioneered<br />
the Colombo Plan which has been expanded so greatly since the<br />
massive contributions made by the United States and the large<br />
contributions which your own country has made. But to us the<br />
future of Australia is going to be very considerably affected<br />
by what goes on in Asia, and because of this we have naturally<br />
given very close study to the developments there.<br />
You have mentioned, Prime Minister, these hopeful<br />
developments in which a greater measure of teamwork is now<br />
being evidenced by the countries around the periphery of Asia,<br />
perhaps brought together by a Common concern, lest they, at one<br />
point, become the target for commiunist aggression, but arising<br />
from this building up of teamwork and a collaboration for<br />
purposes of trade and of mutual interest which I believe<br />
produce some of the most hopeful signs to be found in Asia today.<br />
Now remember when we speak of countries east of Suez we are<br />
talking about half of ma. nkind a billion and a half people,<br />
whose population is increasing rapidly, both from their natural<br />
fecundity and improved public health measures keeping many<br />
more of them alive for a much longer space of time. This<br />
creates, of course, problems for them and for us, but it also<br />
creates opportunities for us all, and whereas in Africa, to<br />
which so much attention is given from Europe, and from the<br />
United Kingdom in particular, there you have, I think, about<br />
270 million people. Well, in Asia, we have about a billion<br />
and a half and they may have doubled by the end of this<br />
century, and many of the countries, countries of long and<br />
ancient civiliation, some of their people, many of them have<br />
quite a high degree of education, their take-off point is much<br />
closer to us than is to be found in many of' the countries of<br />
Africa, and we're finding that there are meetings such as we<br />
had recently at Aspac in Seoul, where nine countries including<br />
N~ ew Zealand and Australia as tho-only two non-Asian countries<br />
were able to come together in friendship and start building<br />
together for a brighter future in that area of: the world. 0 </p>
<p>We know that the United States is determined to help<br />
build a stronger and more prosperous Asia, there has already<br />
been brought into being an Asian Development Bank with a capital<br />
of a billion dollars, much of it subscribed in the area, with<br />
Japan contributing 200 million and Australia 85 million, the<br />
United States 200 million and so on, and in these ways, with the<br />
development of the Mekong Valley, the Indus Waters, a whole<br />
variety of projects which, if time permitted, I could mention,<br />
we are seeing the emergence of an Asia which we had never expected<br />
to find within our own visible distance, and so when we find that<br />
major areas of opinion in this country seem to be turning inward,<br />
away from that area of the world, naturally we have a degree of<br />
concern. You have greatly encouraged us by what you've told us<br />
of the intentions of your own Government. The arrangements which<br />
were made earlier in the year with your Defence Minister seem<br />
to us adequate and satisfactory. Wie appreciated the response<br />
you gave to the views we put in respect of your continued maintenance<br />
of a presence in the area to our north and for our part we have<br />
been working closely with your own service people on proposals<br />
which would meet the sort of contingencies which might arise should<br />
you find yourself unable to continue to maintain a presence in<br />
that area. But it is not so much a military presence that we<br />
are thinking of. I don't know whether there is a full<br />
appreciation in this country of what British influence, British<br />
character, British leadership still mean to the rest of the world,<br />
and for Australia it would be quite a damaging setback to our own<br />
hopes and, we believe, to the aspirations of the people in this<br />
area of the world if, for some reason or other, these qualities<br />
of British character and leadership were somehow to depart from<br />
the area. I know you don't view it that way and I sincerely<br />
hope that while there seems to be an increasing disposition to<br />
look inwards to Europe, the great possibilities, the great<br />
opportunities, would seem to us to be opening up in this part<br />
of the world, will not be overlooked.<br />
Now as a concluding note, may I just emphasise something<br />
which I think is expected by everybody in this room, and that<br />
is that fundamental to the world's hopes for a peaceful and<br />
better order is the continuing collaboration between those two<br />
great English-speaking countries, Great Britain and the United<br />
States of America. My own country has the satisfaction of<br />
enjoying a close friendship with both, my own journey to this<br />
part of the world was a direct consequence of invitations given<br />
to me quite separately by yourself and by the President of the<br />
United States. You both quite independently of each other<br />
when I succeeded my predecessor asked me to continue the same<br />
close and intimate communiction which had developed between you.<br />
This has been greatly valued by me and has been valued by the<br />
colleagues in my own Government, and I feel that Australia would<br />
be responsivo and touched by the confidence and friendship shown<br />
to us in these practical ways. I want to assure you, Prime<br />
Minister, that the objective of keeping warm and close the<br />
friendship between your two great countries is one of the great<br />
objectives of policy of my own Government. There may be<br />
practical ways in which we can help to a better understanding<br />
one of the other, or at times in our own area of the world which<br />
seems so remote to the rest ofL you, prove ourselves capable of<br />
carrying out purposes Which further the joint objective which<br />
our three countries hold together. 6 </p>
<p>6.<br />
Well, it is for Australia a bright, interesting,<br />
exciting, quite dangerous but at the same time challenging<br />
world which faces us down under, and it is perhaps regrettable<br />
that more of the possibilities, more detail of these<br />
developments, cannot be clearly seen by those of the Western<br />
hemisphere. The reporting day by day of what is going on in<br />
Viet H~ am, as I discovered by my own visit, is quite misleading.<br />
We get very little indication that great, constructive<br />
projects of a developmental kind, are going on there, but<br />
its not just a grim war of death and disaster, that each of<br />
th~ e military forces of all the countries represented there<br />
have their own constructive programmes to carry out, and they<br />
are carrying them out. Now its through the stability which<br />
can be brought to that area by whatever process of peaceful<br />
negotiation and by constructive andcavars hereafter that we<br />
feel an Asian society can be built which will be a strength<br />
to the world and not a point of danger and weakness.<br />
Well, Prime minister and Mr. Chairman, I don't wish<br />
to abuse the great privilege which has been given to me tonight<br />
of addressing you all. This is one cfthe great forums for<br />
anybody in London. I compliment our Chairman who through so<br />
many years has by force of his own leadership and the regard<br />
held for him in this city helped to create for Australia a<br />
gathering, perhaps as representative as any that will ever be<br />
asjsembled in the city of London. And so we say thank you,<br />
Clive. I close by saying that I'll be prepared to sing, if<br />
he insists on it, with Harold Wilson, " Along the Road to<br />
Gundagai" but perhaps we could take as our slogan for the night<br />
" Hark the Harold Angels Sing" t </p>
