TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING, MP<br />
AND WA PREMIER CARM'EN LAWRENCE,<br />
DOORSTOP, JANUARY 31 1992.<br />
( PARTIAL TRANSCRIPT)<br />
E OE PROOF COPY<br />
PM: I have had a most enjoyable discussion with the<br />
Premier, I say she has very positive and<br />
optimistic view of the future and we have had very<br />
useful talks.<br />
Premier: We did yes, We are all very pleased that Mr<br />
Keating fairly understood the importance of<br />
Western Australians economy to a national<br />
recovery. We're export oriented, we're strong<br />
and we need the tax consensus and infrastructure<br />
development to make this recovery really go.<br />
J: Mr Keating, the increase in rural crisis, what can<br />
they expect from the economic statement?<br />
PM: Well they've been in crisis because of<br />
international market prices and conditions largely<br />
which the economic statement cannot change. But<br />
we will be considering carefully the interests of<br />
rural Australia and you will have to wait and see.<br />
J: Mr Keating just how much impact will today's talks<br />
have on your forthcoming statements?<br />
PM: Well I find every time one takes the trouble to<br />
listen what people have to say, you invariable<br />
find something new or a number of new thoughts<br />
come from it. That's happened in again today, and<br />
it is very useful. Each of the States have a<br />
different complexion about them, obviously there<br />
is a great difference between Western Australia<br />
and Victoria, which is a largely manufacturing<br />
state. Western Australia is a primary export<br />
state, it has different interests and therefore<br />
different concerns and frankly you don't pick them<br />
up in written submissions you pick them up in </p>
<p>conversation. That's why I had this conversation<br />
with the Premier this morning, and also the one<br />
with the business community which we both had<br />
later.<br />
J: Then what do you understand to be our particular<br />
problem here in the West?<br />
PM: Well they are problems of competitively,<br />
maintenance of competitively and opportunity as<br />
well as continuing to develop Western Australia in<br />
a way in which it has been developing itself now<br />
for a long period of time, because it has taken up<br />
opportunities which come along, and be in a<br />
position to do so.<br />
the spending proposal which....... what<br />
commitments have you given to What ones are<br />
you actually going to give?<br />
PM: We are not about to announce things here and now<br />
to the media. But there is a proper process of<br />
consultation between the Commonwealth Government<br />
and the State Government and we will draw these<br />
things together on a national basis for the<br />
statement. So the communications we have had with<br />
the Premier and her Government, and that which we<br />
will have between now and statement time will<br />
allow us to fabricate a statement which I think<br />
will have a very clear and good national<br />
complexion to it.<br />
J: Can you tell us the day of the statement?<br />
PM: No I can't.<br />
J: Mr Keating, the National Railway Authority is just<br />
about to begin operation. How will it effect rail<br />
state operations in Western Australia?<br />
PM: Well I think, Western Australia does have an<br />
opportunity in land-bridging freight into the<br />
eastern states and it can be an important part of<br />
the service sector of Western Australia. But it<br />
will never be that competitive if the rail system<br />
in general is not competitive. But it is beyond<br />
Western Australia and that's an important issue<br />
not just for Western Australia but for the rest of<br />
the country.<br />
J: Did Western Australians shopping list<br />
PM: Well, I have to say, as the Premier, that she<br />
definitely provides with an extensive shopping<br />
list, that's quite a number of things sensibly<br />
were common to the things which were said to us by<br />
other Heads of Government around Australia. </p>
<p>3<br />
PREMIER: The important thing was in the infrastructure in<br />
the capital works program is that we provided a<br />
list of opportunities. We haven't suggested for<br />
one moment that they should be all attended to,<br />
but they are ready to go and there are some other<br />
ideas that we can obviously develop jointly which<br />
can have important effects on industry<br />
competitively particularly.<br />
J: Mr Keating, the Premier's view is that the economy<br />
should, the national economy should the<br />
program of infrastructure expanding is that<br />
PM: Well that's obviously part of our view. That some<br />
of the things which we can do in the short term<br />
for activity, ought to be things which have a<br />
longer term productive focus about them and the<br />
extent that the Premier nominates infrastructure<br />
projects, she is right.<br />
J: Are you getting a different message from the<br />
business community here?<br />
PM: No.<br />
J: Was there a back down on the wage tax<br />
PM: Oh no, lets understand. Look this is all a<br />
generated by Dr Hewson who claims himself to be a<br />
Professor of Economics, and if Dr Hewson doesn't<br />
understand yet the difference between nominal wage<br />
outcomes and real wage outcomes, that is the rate<br />
of wage increase is less inflation and the fact<br />
that this year inflation is lower than forecast<br />
and that there is an unexpected increase in real<br />
wages, if you can't understand that, the simple<br />
point, he must of escaped a very large part of his<br />
economic training.<br />
J: Mr Keating the..<br />
PM: Well, I don't think you understand it either. Do<br />
you?<br />
J: What will you tell workers?<br />
PM: I'm just trying to make this point. We are<br />
talking about the current year's wages. The<br />
current years wage increases forecast in the 1991<br />
Budget. They are of the order of four to four and<br />
a half per cent. But inflation happily is at one<br />
and a half, so therefore there is a real increase<br />
in there of two plus percentage points on the<br />
current year but on the future year, the<br />
Government has not decided that in can support a<br />
wage increase before the National Wage Case.<br />
That's the point. But that's not new matter. </p>
<p>J: Mr Keating the Australian dollar<br />
PM: Pal listen, I have been asked questions about<br />
exchange rates by the best of them.<br />
J: Mr Keating our State Government seems very keen<br />
for the Irons Marino project to go ahead. How<br />
keen is the Federal Government<br />
PM: I think it will an important part of Australians<br />
national infrastructure and an important addition<br />
to mining capacity in Australia.<br />
J: Do you think Mr Hawke will leave the Labor Party<br />
that will cause a by-election surely?<br />
PM: Well, I was asked that by a lady this morning.<br />
J: Wouldn't it be, do you think Mr Hawke should stay?<br />
PM: Well, I was asked by a lady on the radio, just<br />
check the transcript the answer is there.<br />
J: Dr Hewson on the flag... Do you<br />
( inaudible)<br />
PM: I don't think it is a matter of timetabling it,<br />
but I made my position, well I was asked about it,<br />
I gave a view about it.<br />
J: Do you have any personal preferences for the flag.<br />
Do you see it changing Australian<br />
PM: Do I see it changing in the immediate term? No.<br />
