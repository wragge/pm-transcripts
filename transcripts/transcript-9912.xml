TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON PJ KEATING MP<br />
INTERVIEW WITH JOHN LAWS, RADIO 2UE 22 JANUARY 1996<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
JL: Paul Keating, good morning and welcome.<br />
PM: How are you John nice to be back.<br />
JL: It's gopo to be here, having been in Singapure for a couple of nights and<br />
hearing about your visit there. You impressed the people In Singapore<br />
PM: Well, I think they are very interested in Australia nuw, and it's Interesting<br />
to see how much they had changed. Two weeks agu they were declared<br />
a developed country. Their average per capita theie is now around<br />
$ US30,000 I think it's a lesson to everyone that if a nation focuses on<br />
its option, and pursues them, how far they can go. But I think Singapore<br />
sees Australia importantly as part of its security picture, they have a lot<br />
of regard for the economic changes we have made here, and in fact, just<br />
on 2000 paid to come and here the so-called " Singapore Lecture", so I<br />
was pleased to be able to give them an Australion perspective.<br />
JL: You got very good reviews in the Singapore newspopcrs because I<br />
checked it out while I was there. Listen, this has got to be the longest<br />
election campaign in the history of the world, and the election hasn't<br />
evun been set yet. Do you think this ele. tion speculation is damaging?<br />
PM; I don't think so. I meari for a year I had John Hewson in this parliament<br />
saying Keating is going to call an election. Then I had Alexander<br />
Downer saying Keating Is guing to call an election, John Howard the<br />
same. We had the newspapers saying when we brought the Budget<br />
down in May it's an election Budget, and of course, It wasn't. Then when<br />
we introduced Accord Mark VIII and the Republic. they said clearing the<br />
decks for an election, and it wasn't. I have always said consistently,<br />

right through I think the public don't like trickiness out of politici. iis and<br />
the political system, they expect the parliament to run its full time. And<br />
that's always been an old-fashioned view of mine, but I think that is as it<br />
should be, and I think the public are correct in it.<br />
JL: So, a May election Is not beyond the realms of possibility?<br />
PM: Well, just that May Is technically the end point of this parliament.<br />
JL: Yeah, well, if you want to run the length, that's it then?<br />
PM: Yes, but John Mvwdrd saying " come on, bring it on, bring it on, bring it<br />
on I have got no puli. ies. I have got no hands" He's a bit like the<br />
Black Knight out of the Munty Python show " come on, I've got no arms,<br />
I've got no legs, but give me a punch, give me a punch" And I say hang<br />
on John we'll get there. Doi't worry we will get therA, all in good time.<br />
JL: What was that film, when the fella got his dains cut off, and then his legs<br />
cut off?<br />
PM. That was the Monty Python one The Holy Grail.<br />
JL: That was a funny film.<br />
PM: " I got no policies come and fight me, fight me, fight me." And I say, well<br />
all right, we'll get down to it just don't get yourself flustered there.<br />
JL: Does this mean then that we can wait till May?<br />
PM: Well, look, there's a natural sort of again, it's very hard to beat the<br />
natural order of things. The thing has its own sort of drum beat, and I<br />
think at the right point, it will become clear to us what the best thing is to<br />
do. Anyway, at the most WA are talking about a couple of months a<br />
couple of months In three years<br />
JL: So, in other wurds, it's more likely May than anything else?<br />
PM: No, not necessarily. It's nut necessarily May than anything else.<br />
JL: I though I had you there for a minute.<br />
PM: It's just that May is the end point.<br />
JL: Come on, give us a break I need all the help I can get.<br />

PM. Oh no, you have gone well without a lot of help, I have got to say.<br />
J L: While on the subject of John Howard, I'm not sure if it's one of your<br />
favourites or not, but he's going to make some changes to the unfair<br />
dismissal laws. And I think that the majority would welcome those<br />
changes.<br />
PM: Yeah, but I mean, he was out there the other day saying after 15 years<br />
of espousal of policies to, as he calls it, reform the labour market, which<br />
is code for basically cutting wages for the bottom half of the work force.<br />
That is, removing award protections, removing overtime penalty rates<br />
and the rest holiday leave loadings and all the other things. He is now<br />
saying " I didn't mean all that -didn't mean all that. I have really got a<br />
policy the same as the Government's I'm out there for workers' rights".<br />
And what I said was well, if you believe that, you will believe anything.<br />
But I think an important thing to say about this, is if this was the United<br />
States, if a senior national politician held a strong view for 15 years, and<br />
then just before an election, changed it, the debate wouldn't be about the<br />
policy matter, but about their character. I mean, it would be just a<br />
discussion more about their character than policy. And I think what John<br />
Howard -has got to recognise is this both as Treasurer and as Prime<br />
Ministerf, I have run a system here which has produced an inflation rate<br />
between 2 which has seen a strong real increase in real wages,<br />
which has seen a 20% increase in household disposable income per<br />
capita, which has seen the lowest level of industrial disputes since 1940.<br />
I'm the fellow who has been sitting on that running that system,. He's<br />
the one that wants to run the system he is the one who has got to<br />
propose something better.<br />
JL: Do you think that, although the things you are saying in your mind are<br />
true, and in the minds of many are true, that after 13 years some voters<br />
assume that Labor is tired, that you're tired, and do you think voters are<br />
ready for a change just for the sake of change?<br />
PM: Well, there could be a bit of that around, but I think the energy the<br />
Government has shown in the last three years, John I mean, just look<br />
at the last six or eight weeks. I mean, we put together this Treaty<br />
between Australia and Indonesia, we have brought down the most<br />
important forest policy the country I think has ever seen, in terms of<br />
those Regional Forest Agreements, and Deferred Forest Areas 6<br />
million hectares of forest put away. Today, I'm meeting the Canberra<br />
Commission on the Elimination of Nuclear Weapons...<br />
JL: Yeah, I wanted to talk to you about this this is something that is very<br />
important, and should be very important to all Australians whether you<br />

are Prime Minister or not Prime Minister as far as this is concerned, it is<br />
immaterial it's something that is important for the world. Do you believe<br />
that a country like Australia can lead the world to rid itself of nuclear<br />
armaments?<br />
PM. Well, I think we have got to Start somewhere. I mean, we have got a<br />
fortuitous lapse in the nuclear arms race the Soviet Union collapsed,<br />
the Warsaw Pact countries in Europe the Warsaw Pact evaporated.<br />
Nato's traditional enemy has folded its tent. So, there is a window of<br />
opportunity to get in and say well, look, this bi-polarity between the US<br />
and the Soviet Union is gone this bi-polar game is gone. But what we<br />
have to be careful of is that we don't get into a multi-polar game that is,<br />
with many other countries, the likes of Iraq, perhaps Iran, Pakistan,<br />
North Korea, Israel that are developing nuclear weapons....<br />
JL: But do you believe that a group of people led by Australia, and not in<br />
any way wanting to be demeaning of my own country, but Australia is not<br />
the biggest or most powerful county in the world. But do you believe that<br />
a group of people led by Australia could actually cause this to happen?<br />
PM.' Well, I think we can make a very good start. It may take decades to<br />
happen," but we have to make a beginning. And if you look at the<br />
countries in, if you like, the first rung of economies, we associate<br />
ourselves with and have done strategically the United States, Britain<br />
and for instance in the Second World War, France these are all<br />
nuclear weapon states. If you go to countries like Australia, which are<br />
not nuclear weapon states, we are at least as important and as<br />
significant among those, and as capable among those, as any of doing<br />
it, given the fact that this initiative is unlikely to come from the nuclear<br />
weapons states themselves. And I think the other thing to bear in mind,<br />
John we were a leading part of the move to the Chemical Weapon<br />
Convention. We have put in place a convention for the elimination of a<br />
whole category of weapons with chemical weapons biological weapons<br />
and so we have already proven our abilities there. And you can also<br />
look at our effort at the peace accords in Cambodia, the development of<br />
APEC, our role in the GATT round I mean, Australia has always<br />
punched above its weight, particularly in the years of this Government.<br />
And this is something there is an opportunity here, and I think we have<br />
LW. It,. tu14L* Q ulyti otivuIImlIem itib : 6izea it, ano we nave<br />
these distinguished people from around the world to help is.<br />
JL: Well, when you look at the list of people former US Defence Secretary,<br />
a Nobel Peace Prize winner, a former French Prime Minister, and others.<br />
When you look at this group of people, there are many people who are<br />
obviously serious about it, but did they come here at your invitation, </p>
<p>T2EL2:. Jan. 96 16: 18 No. Ola<br />
were they prepared to come because they have the same belief as you,<br />
or because they wanted to discuss it with you?<br />
PM: Because I think they realise this is an issue. You see, both the major<br />
weapon states Russia and the Untied States have declaratory<br />
statements about the removal of nuclear weapons, and the Nonproliferation<br />
Treaty has at its end point ' the removal of nuclear weapons,<br />
but these are simply long-term declarations they don't have any policy<br />
force. But you see, we have got people here like Leigh Butler the<br />
Commander-In-Chief of the US Strategic Air Command in 1981-82, and<br />
then after that, the US Strategic Command in 1992-94, where he had<br />
responsibility for all US Air Force and Navy nuclear deterrent forces, and<br />
was closely involved in the development of US nuclear doctrine. And<br />
then there is Field Marshall Lord Carver, who was Commander-In-Chief<br />
of the British Forces in the Far East, and then Chief of the Defence<br />
Force from 1973-76.<br />
JL: And all these people have come because they believe this is worth<br />
discussing?<br />
PM: These people have actually run the system. I mean, they are not just<br />
people from outside you know, well-intentioned academics who want to<br />
make a contribution they run the system. And they have come<br />
because I think they see the value of taking the opportunity now of<br />
looking at the possibility of going beyond all the start treaties, down to<br />
the removal of nuclear weapons.<br />
JL: And all this begins at lunchtime today?<br />
PM: Yes it's actually beginning now. Gareth Evans opened the Commission<br />
meeting this morning, and I am meeting the members of the Commission<br />
for lunch, and then they are going to Canberra for the week, and I will be<br />
seeing them again on Thursday.<br />
JL: Just back to this Asia trip that you did the Singapore Lecture, as it is<br />
called. Probably, it was the most important foreign speech of your<br />
career why did you tie in so much domestic issues; labour skills and<br />
environment. The cynics are saying that you threw in the environment<br />
because you recalled in 1990 the green vote took care of you, and put<br />
you back into power?<br />
PM. I No. I mentioned the environment... well, first of all, the basic philosophy I<br />
put there was that with the Cold War over, and as I say, there is tension<br />
between the two super-powers gone, it's now possible for regions to<br />
TEL </p>
<p>TEL: 22. Jan .96 16 : 18 No .014 P. OE<br />
6<br />
actually organise themselves and actually do some good and clever<br />
things together.<br />
JL: Do you think that tension between the two super-powers has gone<br />
temporarily, or permanently? I mean, Russia doesn't look too stable at<br />
the moment, does it?<br />
P M. No. well, you know, one can never know which way the Russian political<br />
system is going. But what has happened is that, you know, we have seen<br />
this amazing change since 1989. 1 mean what was then East Germany,<br />
Poland, they have gone and become Separate states and we are seeing<br />
this change across a number of the former Russian republics. So we are<br />
not talking about the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact as we were.<br />
Whatever happens with the vagaries of Russian politics, it will be Russia<br />
and they have still got, of course, a nuclear arsenal and there will still be<br />
those tensions there.<br />
But what the economic development in South East Asia and North Asia<br />
means in Singapore, in Malaysia, in Thailand, in the Philippines and,<br />
for instance, even in countries like Vietnam, along with Japan and the<br />
great emerging economic power, China is that we are able to look at<br />
things regionally. And Australia has put essentially APEC together as an<br />
economic body to deal with regional economic problems, opening up<br />
trade opportunities and fuelling and resourcing the East Asian growth<br />
phase. So what I was doing in this lecture was to say there is a possibility now for<br />
regional organisation where if we threw everything into the great melting<br />
pot of the UN, all these issues these ones I am speaking of would be<br />
largely lost. But here we can actually meet in a cooperative way in APEC,<br />
for instance, or in ASEAN the Association of South East Asian Nations<br />
and get things done.<br />
Now I mentioned the environment for this reason and I gave some<br />
statistics. The Chinese shortfall of food in about ten years time is going to<br />
be about six times Australian wheat production just in grain. The green<br />
revolution which has produced so much food has relied on fertilisers, has<br />
relied on things which have essentially attacked the environment and we<br />
can't believe or rely upon the fact that we can continue to yield this sort of<br />
productivity from the earth.<br />
The demand for energy is doubling in East Asia every 12 years. It<br />
doubles in the world every 28 years. So finding the coal, the petroleum,<br />
the energy, the food and then, of course, the pollution in the air, the<br />
urbanisation, the sanitation, the water quality, the impact on the fisheries, </p>
<p>TEL: 22.. Jan. 96 16: 18 No. 014 P. 07.<br />
7<br />
these are real issues for the developing world of East Asia and the East<br />
Asian hemisphere which Australia is a part of the East Asian economies<br />
which Australia is a part of. So that is why I mentioned the environme nt.<br />
The real challenge to keep the growth going in East Asia is really food<br />
security, energy and water.<br />
JL: This, that I am about to read to you, is a description of your pluses and<br />
minuses as a leader. I am not sure if you want to hear them.<br />
PM: Who has written this?<br />
JL: Michael Gordon in The Australian.<br />
PM: A Canberra correspondent.<br />
JL: Okay, now tell me if you agree? " A focus on big picture ideas", you would<br />
have to agree with that because you are telling me constantly about the<br />
big picture?<br />
PM: Well, I mean, the thing that I just spoke to you about is about that very<br />
thing because if you get those things right, the other things tend to look<br />
after therfiselves.*<br />
JL: Okay, so these are the pluses. " A focus on big picture ideas, charm."<br />
PM:-Well I am like you I can be charming when I wish to be. Just like you<br />
were with that Mortein ad a bit earlier.<br />
JL: It wasn't Mortein, Prime Minister.<br />
PM: What was it?<br />
JL: Raid.<br />
PM: Raid. Sorry, sorry. I have gone and done it now.<br />
JL: You see, but you have got a very good memory because it is 14 years<br />
since I did one for Morte in.<br />
PM: Well that is right, I mean, it is a bit like Valvoline you can't, sort of, forget<br />
them.<br />
JL: Okay, you are back on equal terms now. Let's listen to more of your<br />
pluses. " The ability to form close and constructive bonds with regional<br />
leaders." </p>
<p>TEL: 22. Jan. 96 16: 18 No .014 P. 08/'<br />
8<br />
PM. Yes, I think you can form bonds with the people who lead the region by<br />
trying to see the region through their eyes and understanding their<br />
problems and then put the argument about Australia's relevance and how,<br />
together, we can do more and end up with a stronger, better regional<br />
society.<br />
JL: And also, " the capacity for sustained bouts of serf discipline".<br />
PM: Oh yes, well we are all I hope into that sustained bouts.<br />
JL: Is it difficult?<br />
PM: Do we have lapses? Well, of course, we do. We all have lapses in<br />
self discipline.<br />
JL: Do you regret the lapses?<br />
PM: Well you can't be an automaton. You know, one of these people who are<br />
wound up in the morning you know programmed and wound up and<br />
they go out there like a parrot and say things. I mean any political leader<br />
that workt like thatyou will never get anything from. I mean there will be<br />
no creativity, no spontaneity, no ideas, no real leadership. In the end, the<br />
one thing that people want you to provide in this business is leadership<br />
and any leader providing it must have the capacity to think themselves,<br />
generate their own ideas not from a department, not in a brief, not from<br />
personal staffs, out of your own head and that means having the sort of<br />
creativity to do it. I don't believe anybody who is doing those things can<br />
run like a wind up person. You know, wound up and sort of disciplined<br />
and stays on the lines.<br />
JL: Well I tell you what, you went a hell of a long way around there to not<br />
answer the question.<br />
PM: No, I am just saying that..<br />
JL: That that was self discipline?<br />
PM: we have self discipline, I hope. We have lapses off it.<br />
JL: Yes.<br />
PM: We do because we are not wound up.<br />
JL Do you regret the lapses? </p>
<p>TEL: 22 . Jan .96 16 : 18 No .014 P. OS<br />
9<br />
PM: Oh, some I do. Yes, some I do. But in the big swim of things what I am<br />
most interested in is making the policy changes. You see, in the end, the<br />
value of people in the political system, in political leadership, is to make<br />
changes. The system basically runs itself. What doesn't run itself are the<br />
new directions.<br />
JL: Let's look at what he said on the negative side because it is interesting.<br />
There is " a short fuse", he says. You would agree with that?<br />
PM: Oh, no, that is not quite right. I am very understanding of why people say<br />
and do things. I make big allowances, I have big discounts in their<br />
behaviour, If you didn't, you couldn't stay in public life a long time.<br />
JL: So you don't think you have a short fuse?<br />
PM. No, well, look, I have been a Minister for 13 years. I think if you ask any<br />
person, or anyone who knows any person on my staff, I have never been<br />
sharp with them or abused them in that time. Not ever.<br />
JL: Street fighter instincts?<br />
PM: I don't believe in rudeness. I don't believe in personal effrontery and<br />
rudeness. I would rather go through life without that sort of behaviour<br />
JL: I know that you believe that personally. But there would be people out<br />
there who would be saying, wow, well what about the stuff he says in<br />
Parliament?<br />
PM: But Parliament Is the clearing house of national pressures. This is where<br />
people fight about whether we have Medicare, or we don't have Medicare,<br />
you know whether you have protection of awards, or you don't. I mean<br />
they are things that matter to people and we are not just going to trade<br />
them away politely and say, yes, you want to be rid of them? You can<br />
have them. You know?<br />
JL:-But you do get a bit abusive there in Parliament?<br />
PM: Yes, but what I don't get is personal. You see I have got the Liberal Party<br />
up there now saying what's her name, the Senator from South Australia<br />
I am like Goebbels. Then I have got Senator Bishop reading extracts<br />
from a psychiatric manual on radio saying I have got psychiatric<br />
tendencies. And John Howard has got Michael Baume every day in the<br />
Senate trying to say I am corrupt. I mean these are the things I have<br />
never done against Howard, Hewson, or any of my political opponents. I </p>
<p>TEL: 22. Jan. 96 16: 18 No. Ola<br />
might, occasionally, give them~ a corporate slur. But one that doesn't<br />
matter, like knuckleheads, or something like that. But that is different to<br />
saying you are corrupt, psychotic, or you are a fascist, which is the sort of<br />
stuff they do to me. I mean the personal attacks I have taken from the<br />
Liberal Party. If there is anyone who stands up who can actually defeat<br />
them, like Whitlam did, is in for it. Like Wran did, is in for it. Like I have,<br />
is in for it.<br />
But the Labor Party has always taken the wider, I think more decent view,<br />
that you don't go after people, personally, under the privilege of<br />
Parliament and I don't. I don't and that is the point I made earlier. But we<br />
are talking about two points here. We are talking about political points<br />
and personal behaviour short fuses. I don't believe in rudeness. There<br />
is no place for it and it is not needed and people say, oh well I am working<br />
under pressure. Well look we all work under pressure. But it doesn't help<br />
for people to go off the handle and I don't like it. I don't like it when it is<br />
done to me and I don't do it to others.<br />
JL: Michael Gordon also says that you have " a capacity for vindictiveness".<br />
PM: No, I am-not vindictive. Look, I would say this. I have been in politics<br />
now sinc4 1969 -1I have been in the Parliament. I have been attacked by<br />
all sorts of people. I don't wish ill of any of them. You know that? I could<br />
say both in the Labor Party and in the Parliament and we have had<br />
factional battles in the Labor Party over 20 or 30 years, I have had, you<br />
know, Party battles in the Parliament over the same period I must say I<br />
have no real enmity, no enmity, towards anyone.<br />
JL: What are the polls showing at the minute because I have been away and<br />
that? Are you looking good in the polls?<br />
PM: Well we are on the published polls, on two-party preferred terms<br />
behind the Liberal Party. But I think that the community has not yet got<br />
down to focus on the issues of an election.<br />
JL: Why do you think you are behind?<br />
PM; I think all incumbent governments are behind these days. I mean we are<br />
something like, on the published polls, 5 to 6 percentage points behind.<br />
But look at the British government, it is 30 percentage points behind, or<br />
percentage points behind. The government is in a winning position.<br />
But I have always said, John, the only place to be in an election is one out<br />
and one back.<br />
J L: Explain that to me? </p>
<p>T2E2L:. 3an. 96 16: 18 No. 014 P. 11<br />
11<br />
PM: Well, like in a horse race one off the rails and one back.<br />
JL I didn't know you were into horse racing.<br />
PM: Well I am not. But I know the place to be in a poll and rather than being<br />
1m. e an going to an election out in front is a difficult position to hold all<br />
the way through. The key point, I think, for me and the government is that<br />
the government has had a huge energy over these three years, it has got<br />
a real vision for Australia it puts it into place, and the burden on John<br />
Howard is going to be to put an alternative philosophy. So far he hasn't.<br />
The headland speeches have been empty and voids. He hasn't<br />
articulated policies and he is really saying, look, if I wait long enough, will<br />
you give me the Prime Ministership. He is really saying this, look, I will<br />
tell you what I will do with you. I won't say anything you don't like, I won't<br />
propose policies you think might hurt you, I will keep my head down, I will<br />
cuddle up and look as much like the government, if only you will vote for<br />
me. Whereas what I am saying is I believe Australia has an unparalleled<br />
opportunity, we are the only nation in~ the world with a continent to<br />
ourselvet, we live in the fastest growing part of the world, we have now<br />
opened the Australian economy up, we are integrated with East Asia as<br />
never before. we have got a period of excitement and opportunity ahead<br />
of us, and the government is articulating the policies.<br />
Anyone that wants to knock the government off its perch, has got to have<br />
an alternatively lucid strategy. And I think when the voters, when the<br />
community, when Australian men and women, focus on those issues<br />
when an election is actually on I think then the polls will change.<br />
J L: When do you think that John Howard might start to articulate some<br />
policies'?<br />
PM: Well I think it is too late for him. I mean I think it is the height of.. it is<br />
rude, I think. Rude to say to people I have been hiding my policies from<br />
Mr Keating, where really he has been hiding them from them. It is they<br />
who vote. I get one vote. It is they who vote. He has been hiding them<br />
from them and then say, I am going to play you all off a break and I will<br />
drop some little tid-bits in the last couple of weeks of an election and that<br />
is good enough for you. If you don't pick it up then, bad luck.<br />
Whereas what the government has said is, look this is our strategy and<br />
these are the fine print of our policies and they are all in place. They are<br />
there all the time. It doesn't matter whether you are talking about, you<br />

know, trade with Asia, or the environment, or forests, or our strategic<br />
situation, or wages, or the Accord, or the Budgets, they are all there.<br />
They are not just in the mind where you get a quick look at them from the<br />
sleeve you know, the sleeve policy that is pulled out of the sleeve,<br />
waved for a couple of weeks and then say have a vote. John Howard<br />
thinks that because the government has been in office for 13 years, all he<br />
has to do is sit there and say nothing and slide into office.<br />
Well I think people have got to remember that he has been there longer<br />
than most of the Ministers in this government. He was a Treasurer before<br />
I was ever a Minister and Australia was an industrial backwater and<br />
Industrial archaeological museum. It had, in the end, no future, high<br />
inflation and high unemployment. So I was just saying, market himself as<br />
a new person. I mean, new person John Howard, Tim Fischer, have a<br />
look at Tim's antics in the last week or two, Alexander Downer. I mean<br />
Tim will be the Deputy Prime Minister, Alexander Downer would be the<br />
Foreign Minister, Mr Costello would be the Treasurer. This is the new<br />
team.<br />
JL: Well if all this is as bad as you are intimating to me it is, why is he in front<br />
in the polls?<br />
PMV: Well it is the old point about incumbency. I think the public are also quite<br />
clever about polls. It is a bit like by-elections, they see them as an<br />
opportunity to needle the government and push it along and good on<br />
them. In other words, they are not going to say, oh yes, no, no, the<br />
government is fine, that is alright we are going to vote for the government.<br />
But others say, well I am thinking about it, I am undecided, or I am against<br />
them at this point. And they see that, I am sure, as actually encouraging<br />
governments to do better and good on them for that.<br />
JL: Good luck with the meeting that you have at lunch time today. I know it is<br />
very important not just to you, but to the entire world.<br />
PM: Well, I think, we have a strategic lull. I mean this is very rare in the world.<br />
I mean we didn't have nuclear weapons before 1945.<br />
JL: So if it is going to be done, it must be done now?<br />
PM: There have been 130,000 nuclear weapons produced. At the moment,<br />
there are 50,000 warheads..<br />
JL Lying around. </p>
<p>T2EL2:. Jan. 96 16: 18 No. 014 P. 13<br />

PM: 50,000 warheads lying around and I think what we have got to tell people,<br />
including the nuclear powers. It Is not just the five of them the<br />
United States, Russia, Britain, France and China. It won't be just five of<br />
them. As countries get more wealthy and they think their strategic<br />
position is deteriorating, they will all consider having a nuclear weapon<br />
too. And, then, the discipline that the Soviet Union and the United States<br />
had through the Cold War years won't be the sort of discipline and threat<br />
assessments that all these other smaller states will have in the future.<br />
So it is not just five and nothing it is heaps of countries having nuclear<br />
weapons.<br />
JL Yes.<br />
PM: So if a country like Australia doesn't stand up and say, well listen we are<br />
going to have a go and try and get the best people and pull the best<br />
thoughts together and drive some of these lessons home, well you know<br />
we have got nothing to lose other than our confidence in ourselves and<br />
our regard for what we think is an important international contribution.<br />
JL: Okay, well as I say, good luck not just for your sake, but for the sake of<br />
everybody and I mean the world because it is a pretty important issue.<br />
PM: Well chemical weapons, now, we have got a convention to eliminate<br />
them. Australia was principally involved in eliminating a whole category<br />
of weapons. If we had done it with something which is much harder to<br />
verify chemical weapons and biological weapons it can be done with<br />
nuclear weapons.<br />
J L: And should be. I trust we will have time to talk to each other before the<br />
election in May?<br />
PM: I hope so. I hope so. If you'll have me on.<br />
JL: You didn't deny May.<br />
PM: Well, I mean, I opened up with a Raid ad, I suppose I can absorb any<br />
culture.<br />
JL: Good to see you. I am glad I am back and I hope that we talk to each<br />
other soon.<br />
PM: Good on you, John.<br />
