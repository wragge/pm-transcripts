PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 28 JULY 1988<br />
Mr A. K. Wrigley has today been re-appointed to the position of<br />
Director-General of ASIO.<br />
The Government's expectation, however, is that Mr Wrigley will<br />
continue to serve in that post for a few weeks only before taking<br />
on a new appointment.<br />
Mr Wrigley's new appointment will be as Special Adviser to the<br />
Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce on the development<br />
of the multifunction polls project.<br />
This is a major exercise for the Government and for Australia<br />
working in harness with Japan to establish the potential for the<br />
development of a new complex with a high technology orientation<br />
and supported by high technology industry development.<br />
Mr Wrigley, an engineer by training with a long period associated<br />
with the industry side of the Defence portfolio, is well<br />
qualified to help lead the advancement of this project.<br />
I take this opportunity to record the substantial contribution Mr<br />
Wrigley has made as Director-General of Security. His leadership<br />
has been the more notable because of the need to manage over the<br />
period of his appointment the relocation of the ASIO head office<br />
to Canberra with associated major problems of dislocation and<br />
re-establishment.<br />
Mr Wrigley's successor as Director-General of ASIO will be<br />
announced when the normal selection and appointment procedures<br />
have been completed. 629<br />
