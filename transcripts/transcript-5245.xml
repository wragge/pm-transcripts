PRESS OFFICE TRANSCRIPT TUESDAY, 29 JANUARY, 1980<br />
PRIME MINISTER INTERVIEWED BY STEVEN FOX, ASSOCIATED PRESS,<br />
LOS ANGELES<br />
Question After I dictated to my office I was standing next to several<br />
of the gentlemen who attended the lunch at ( inaudible) and one<br />
of them said one of the problems about investing in Australia<br />
is that there is a lot of labour strikes. Is that correct?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
There are a lot of strikes; in the last international figures<br />
I saw somewhat less than in the United States on a per capita<br />
basis. Question Do they tend to be more wild-cat though and more disruptive<br />
therefore? Prime Minister<br />
No. They are generally over wages or<br />
Question But I think that is predictable.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
It might be less predictable if you do not know the scene.<br />
You have got to study the industrial relations scene and a great<br />
deal depends upon the management of particular corporations.<br />
If somebody had said-that, then I wish he had asked me a question<br />
Question I noticed there was an absence of questions at the end. ( about strikes).<br />
Prime Minister<br />
It has not stopped a great many corporations investing and making<br />
good profits.<br />
Question California is very heavily in aerospace and of course resource<br />
materials too. Some of the gentlemen here work for oil companies.<br />
Do you think Californian companies have taken as much advantage<br />
of opportunities in Australia as they might?<br />
Prime Minister-<br />
I think United States companies as a whole have taker. a good slice<br />
of the opportunities that have been going. Over the last 20 or </p>
<p>ASSOCIATED PRESS INTERVIEW -2-<br />
Prime Minister ( continued)<br />
years many United States' corporations have been skilfull,<br />
through their own judgement, in getting into areas where they<br />
have made high profits, good profits. There have been one or<br />
two difficult years in Australia as they know and we know.<br />
That is behind us. There are many more<br />
opportunities for the future, but there might be more competition<br />
for those opportunities because I think there will be greater<br />
European interest, much greater German interest, and greater<br />
interest in investment from Japan. One or two Californian<br />
companies may have been inhibited in the past by Californian<br />
environmental rules, which had got in the way of investment in<br />
Australia not from anything that was going to happen at the<br />
Australian end, what might have been happening at this end.<br />
You might take longer to get through the environmental<br />
maze than we wrould in investment decisions in Australia.<br />
* Question<br />
I am not quite clear on how our rules would affect their decision<br />
to Prime Minister<br />
Well, if you want to buy natural gas from Australia and you<br />
have got to get permission to ship it to California, for example,<br />
you need to have environmental approval to put up gas tanks<br />
on the Californian coast.<br />
What areas would you think would be the most promising for<br />
U. S. companies in Australia. Obviously minerals<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Minerals, resource areas. But I would hope a much greater<br />
degree of processing in Australia, because we can provide by<br />
world standards, cheap electricity based on coal. As oil prices<br />
rise further, I would believe it is going to make much more<br />
economic sense to conduct processing in Australia.<br />
Question Could you give me some specific examples of what you mean?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Well, the development of the alui-rinium smelting industry in<br />
Australia is a classic example. It has $ 4 billion worth of<br />
investment in that area going into Australia at the moment.<br />
/ 3 </p>
<p>ASSOCIATED PRESS INTERVIEW 3-<br />
Question So do you mean processing of raw materials primarily<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Yes. Question For that manufacturing?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Manufacturing also. Our manufacturing industry is pretty<br />
cost competitive at the moment. It is able to get in<br />
and compete in a large number of markets right around the<br />
-world. If people make a good product that is well designed<br />
and well produced, that does open up opportunities for Australian<br />
manufacturing, not just to supply the Australian market.<br />
I think the objective ought to be, when manufacturing takes<br />
place in Australia, to do it on a basis of exports as well.<br />
For example, the motor industry is starting to get into<br />
worldwide production.<br />
Question Unemployment in Australia now is about 5 1 per cent, or 6?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
This is the seasonal peak at the moment. Between 5 and 6.<br />
/ 4 </p>
<p>ASSOCIATED PRESS INTERVIEW -4-<br />
Question Is there an opportunity there for American workers, to immigrate?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Skilled workers, yes.<br />
Question What trades would that be?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I think through most of the skilled trades: through the metal<br />
trades. There would be opportunities in some of the remoter<br />
parts with resource development that is undertaken. With the<br />
North West Shelf very likely to get under way there could be a<br />
considerable need for people. Our Labour Department keeps a<br />
current list of skills that are in short supply in Australia.<br />
It is modified, and changed. It is monitored. It is<br />
hard to get into Australia, obviously, if there are unemployed<br />
Australians who could or want to fill the vacancies. But on the<br />
other hand, we do not want projects held up because of a<br />
shortage of skilled labour.<br />
Question Is there much protectionist sentiment in Australia?<br />
Prime Minister-<br />
I think less than in many other countries, but there is<br />
protectionism in Australia. I gave the answer downstairs. No.<br />
In broad terms the level of protection is less than it was.<br />
Question How long ago? Less than 10 years, or<br />
Prime Minister<br />
There has been a fairly steady movement I think. Certainly less<br />
than 10 years ago, yes. We have not gone into all the new<br />
protective devices and sophisticated protective devices, so a<br />
straight-out comparison on tariff levels gives a very unreal<br />
view of protection in Australia.<br />
Question Parkinson ( Sir Nicholas Parkinson) spoke recently of what he called<br />
the damage to the constituency that Australia has in the United<br />
States. Could you expand on what he was talking about.<br />
Prime Minister-<br />
I did not hear the speech, and I have not read the speech, but<br />
he might have been referring to the fact that very large numbers </p>
<p>ASSOCIATED PRESS INTERVIEW<br />
Prime Minister ( continued)<br />
of United States' servicemen were in or went through Australia<br />
during the war. As time passes they get a little older. There was<br />
a group of people who got to like Australia during those times<br />
who had an affection for Australia out of their own personal<br />
experiences. Whether that is what the Ambassador was referring<br />
to or not I-am not sure, but that seems to me to make sense.<br />
* Question<br />
He made reference to efforts to rebuild that constituency, or<br />
to strengthen ties between our two countries. What efforts are<br />
you making<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I think the natural relationship tends to keep Australia and<br />
the United States reasonably close together. Also, events over<br />
the last three or four months are likely to bring the two<br />
countries closer together because we have very similar views about<br />
a number of present concerns. That is likely to lead to a<br />
similarity of policy in a number of areas, and also make more<br />
relevant for example long standing associations such as the ANZUS<br />
defence alliance. When there are no international worries these<br />
things can go into the background, but in the current climate<br />
they are much more likely to come to the fore. I have already<br />
said that we are prepared to co-operate with the United States,<br />
to undertaken greater patrolling and sufveillance in the Indian<br />
ocean for example. The practical associations, whether they<br />
are out of defence or through business co-operation, business<br />
investment, the normal interchange between our peoples, these are<br />
the things that add to the strength of a broad relationship.<br />
The much cheaper air fares that are now between this country and<br />
mine are encouraging a much higher level of tourism, I think in<br />
both directions.<br />
Question Is there anything you would single out as one main, or primary<br />
barrier to increased economic relations, commercial relations.<br />
If there was one problem ( inaud) what would that be?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I do not think there is any one problem of that kind. The sort<br />
of thing that would help us most is runningthe economy well,<br />
tightly, keeping inflation lower than many others. That attracts<br />
business investment to Australia, I would imagine in an increasing<br />
number of areas. Now that can be lost very quickly if an economy<br />
is mis-managed, if inflation runs riot. Some. of those people<br />
at lunch would have mentioned American concerns that left<br />
Australia in the ' 54, ' 55 period, but those who have stayed are<br />
very glad. I think many others are now starting to think of<br />
involvement in Australia, because again, the fact that we have<br />
large quantities of many minerals and resources and a plentiful / 6 </p>
<p>ASSOCIATED PRESS INTERVIEW -6-<br />
Prime Minister ( continued)<br />
supply of certain forms of energy in Australia, is going to mean<br />
that there will be increasing investment opportunities open in<br />
this decade.<br />
Question For technology primarily, or capital in technology ( inaud)?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Oh, both. A country like Australia needs foreign capital.<br />
our own capital market is too small. We cannot provide for the<br />
kind of developments that are taking place, that could take place.<br />
We could not find all the capital ourselves. A number of the<br />
projects are just too big.<br />
Mr. MacKellar ( Minister for Health)<br />
Just one thing on immigration. You mentioned specifically<br />
skilled workers. Not only skilled workers, as the Prime Minister<br />
has said, but we are also anxious to bring to Australia if we<br />
can, a thing we call entrepeneurs those with capital<br />
to invest, bring new technology to Australia, set up businesses<br />
in Australia, which will provide employment opportunities within<br />
Australia, so there is a broad range of approach to the question<br />
of immigration.<br />
Question Are there any fields you can identify as being<br />
Mr. MacKellar<br />
It depends. Each application is assessed on its individual<br />
merits, but it is a flexible approach. Hopefully, there would be some<br />
people in the quite a number of people in the U. S., who<br />
would respond to that sort of challenge.<br />
Question Have your laws been changed recently to make it more easy for<br />
a small business to come into Australia?<br />
Mr. MacKellar<br />
we have brought in new immigration guidelines recently, yes, which<br />
, does emphasise amongst others, this category.<br />
