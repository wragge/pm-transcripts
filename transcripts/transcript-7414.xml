PRIME MRAINISTE<br />
FOR MEDIA 17 OCTOBER 1988<br />
JOINT STATEMENT WI TH THE MINISTER FOR INDUSTRY, TECHNOLOGY<br />
AND COMMERCE, SENATOR BUTTON<br />
1I together with the Minister for Industry, Technology and<br />
Commerce, Senator Button today welcome the decision by<br />
North Broken Hill Holdings Limited, and Noranda Forest Inc<br />
of Canada, to proceed with the building of a world scale<br />
pulp mill in northern Tasmania.<br />
This $ Al billion project is the largest single investment in<br />
manufacturing in Australia ever made by private industry and<br />
is of major national significance.<br />
In many ways the investment decision is a watershed. The<br />
project represents a major green field investment where<br />
around 90 per cent of the output will be for the export<br />
market. it will mean up to $ 300m net annual addition . to<br />
the Balance of Payments.<br />
The participation of Noranda Forest in this pybJect i<br />
particularly welcome. With its extensive forest products,<br />
interests and market network around the world, Noranda<br />
Forest brings significant expertise to the project.<br />
The North Broken Hill/ Noranda Forest decision to invest<br />
reflects the underlying strength now evident in the<br />
Australian economy. The improved competitiveness of<br />
manufacturing following changes to company tdxation and<br />
other important structural changes in the economy achieved<br />
by this Government, has made major internatijonally oriented<br />
growth in industry a real prospect.<br />
The mill will be of enormous benefit to the Tasmanian<br />
econoimy. It is expected that some 2,400 direct and indirect<br />
jobs will be created during the construction phase and some<br />
700 direct and indirect jobs in the operating phase.<br />
Senator Button said the Government has worked closely with<br />
the companies and the Tasmanian Government to ensure the<br />
project went ahead.<br />
" But the benefits are not limited to Tasmania. The local<br />
content of the project, including infrastructure and<br />
construction works, will be around 80 per cent. At least<br />
per cent of the plant and machinery required by the project<br />
will be sourced in Australia, which will benefit<br />
manufacturing firms Australia wide. 2/<br />

" Such large scale internationally competitive pulp resources<br />

in world scale paper manufacturing, another major step in<br />
the value adding chain," he said.<br />
