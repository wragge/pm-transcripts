PRIME MINISTER Press Statement No. 419<br />
21 December 1974<br />
NUCLEAR TESTS CASE<br />
The Prime Minister said that he understood that the<br />
effect of the majority decision of the Court was that the<br />
objective of Australia had been accomplished in as much as<br />
the Court found that by its public statements France had<br />
undertaken the obligation to hold no further nuclear tests<br />
in the atmosphere in the South Pacific. The Court was not<br />
therefore called upon to give a decision.<br />
The Court had also indicated that if the basis of<br />
this judgment were to be affected in the future Australia<br />
could request an examination by the Court of the situation<br />
in accordance with the provisions of the statute of the<br />
Court. The Prime Minister added that his advisers would<br />
be studying the judgment of the Court and the separate<br />
opinions given by the individual judges.<br />
