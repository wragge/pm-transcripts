HANDING OVER OF THE PAPERS OF ALFRED DEAKIN<br />
TO THE NATIONAL LIBRARY. CANBERRA 3RD DECMEBE1R. 1965<br />
Speech by the Prime Minister, Sir Robert Menzies<br />
Thank you very much. I have great pleasure in<br />
accepting these papers, of which we have a token here, on<br />
behalf of the National Library.<br />
I don't quite understand how you accumulate<br />
papers. Mine, such as I have, are always in a state of chronic<br />
disorder, but every time I see ir. ', hite, the Librarian, he<br />
looks at me with a gleam in the eye and refrains, just, from<br />
saying to me, " Who will get your papers when you are gone?" and<br />
I always disappoint him by saying I have none" for then I<br />
don't compare myself with Alfred ieakin. I am betraying n4<br />
secret. I have said it almost time after time that in my opinion<br />
Alfred Deakin was the greatest Prime Minister this country ever<br />
had and if we ever have one as good in the future, we will be<br />
doing very well. It's a very curious thing looking back on his<br />
work, to realise how frequently immense talents can be obscured<br />
by the possession of one, and he had a great talent for speech<br />
and this to many people obscured his other talents. There is<br />
a rather cbmmon disposition to believe that a man who could speak<br />
as he could, who had the touch of eloquence that he had must<br />
have nothing else, as if it were vox et praeterea nihil. This<br />
is a common error. Whereas, of course the truth was that in<br />
constructive thinking, in fundamental thinking, he did things<br />
for Australia, of which most people today are unconscious,<br />
which still affect every day of our lives. All the foundational<br />
policies, not only in the fiscal field in the defence field<br />
in the industrial field, the pattern of national policy which<br />
we have come to accept so much in Australia was laid down by<br />
this remarkable man. And of course, as one of the fathers of<br />
the Constitution, he has his monument all around him, particularly<br />
in this city. I heard him speak only once and that was when I<br />
was a boy, a schoolboy in Ballarat. I don't remember anything<br />
about it except that I did hear him speak. It wasn't a very<br />
intellectual phase of my life. I was about thirteen, I think,<br />
but he was the Member for Ballarat and I wa6 at school in Ballarat.<br />
But ever since I came to man's estate, I've been fascinated by<br />
him, by his personality and by his work, and for years I felt<br />
there was something missing in Australia beoause we had not had<br />
beyond ,' alter Murdoch's monograph a definitive life, some<br />
substantive volume about Deakin, based on all the information<br />
that has accumulated about him.<br />
I am glad this error has now been repaired. In<br />
fact this is a sort of heyday because not only has Professor<br />
La Nauze enriched us with his two tall volumes but Rohan has<br />
written a fascinating book, Mrs. Bookes, on your most distinguished<br />
husband and therefore this is, in a sense, a vintage Deakin<br />
year. And I am very glad that after this great interval of<br />
time it should be happening, but I suppose it is part of ordinary<br />
fate that men of great note should fade away for a period in the<br />
memory of people; should be critcised, should be denigrated<br />
in many ways. / 2 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
I remember one night in England saying to<br />
Winston Churchill, " You know, by the time you have been<br />
dead for ten years, an event which I hope will be long<br />
postponed clever young men at Oxford and Cambridge will<br />
write books about you explaining that never once in the<br />
whole of your life were you right." He said, " Do you think<br />
so?" And I said, " I'm sure of it but don't worry about<br />
it because twenty years after that, they will all be<br />
forgotten and you will still be up there in the history of<br />
the nation." This is occurring in the case of Alfred Deakin.<br />
These events all help to recreate hi. m in the public imagination<br />
and in the minds of readers and thinkers in years to come,<br />
and thinking as I do about that I am delighted I think<br />
it is a wonderful stroke of luck to be here as Prime<br />
Minister at a time when these papers are being handed over<br />
and to be able to say something from my heart in the presence<br />
of his family. </p>
