~ o7 diplomatic relations with the German Democtatic RepublicÃ¸ Following is<br />

of the German Democratic Republic have today decided<br />
to establish diplomatic relations at Ambassadorial<br />
~ level0 " In reaching this decision both Governments<br />

<p>PRIME MINISTER'S PRESS CONFERENCE<br />
19 DECEMBER<br />
RELATIONS WITh EAST GERMANY<br />
Prime Minister: I have instructed the Australian Ambassador in Moscow<br />
to have discussions with this East German colleague there about the<br />
early establishment of diplomatic relations between Australia and the<br />
German Democratic Republic. These discussions are in progress,<br />
Following the recent moves between West and East Germany to<br />
normalise their relations, I consider it is important both for political<br />
and commercial reasons for Australia to normalise its own relations with<br />
East Germany. Apart from facilitating trade in both directions, Australian<br />
recognition of East Germany would, when agreement is reached, make people<br />
in Europe more aware that there is a new government in Australia which is<br />
not concentrating on South East Asia and the Pacific to the exclusion of<br />
our highly important relations with Europe.<br />
I would also make the point that in opening discussions with<br />
the GDR I am seeking to avoid situations in which Australia takes general<br />
decisions in international affairs late. I would rather see Australia in<br />
the vanguard than in the rearguard in coming to its own foreign policy<br />
decisions. </p>
