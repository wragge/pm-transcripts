COPY OF LETTER TO PREMIER OF QUEENSLAND<br />
THE HON. G. F. R. NICKLIN, M. LA.<br />
DATED 26TH OCTOBER, 1959.<br />
Dear Mr. Nicklin, Mr. Holt having now returned and given us an account<br />
of his very extensive enquiries into the possibilities of<br />
overseas borrowing, I am now able to convey to you our considered<br />
views as to the part the Commonwealth is prepared to play<br />
in financing the rehabilitation of the railway from Collinsville<br />
to Mt. Isa in North Queensland.<br />
First, I should say that we have concluded that<br />
there is no immediate prospect of raising finance overseas specifically<br />
for the Mt. Isa Railway project. We do not by any means<br />
rule out the possibility of obtaining some overseas money for the<br />
purpose at a later stage, and that is a consideration we have had<br />
to keep in mind in framing the proposal I am about to put to you.<br />
It is clear, however, that no such pportunity is likely to occur<br />
for some time ahead and that, even then, we could not rely upon<br />
obtaining more than a part of the total sum required.<br />
In the light of this conclusion we have turned<br />
our minds to the problem of finding sufficient money from other<br />
sources to enable the comprehensive railway project to go ahead<br />
and be carried through to completion in a satisfactory manner,.<br />
You told me in your letter of the 24th July last<br />
that your Government had decided to proceed with the limited<br />
project of re-building the line fro~ m Richmond to Duchess at the<br />
standard envisaged by Ford Bacon and Davis in their report. The<br />
advice you obtained from that firm was that the cost of that<br />
work would be from œ E8 million to œ 10 million and you said that,<br />
spread over five years, this would be within thle financial resources<br />
of your State. On this, I said in my r, ply to you that, while<br />
the more limited proposal was naturally quite unobjectionable<br />
from our point of view, I could not help feeling that it was a<br />
relatively temporary expedient, and that I would like to see the<br />
whole line done, thus bringing about a development of great importance<br />
to Queensland. That is a view to which I have held steadily,<br />
My colleagues and I have always seen the compreilensive railway<br />
ptrioesj ecotf adse vael moepamnesn t ofw hipcrho muontdionugb ttehde lyi mmeexnisset ainnd Novratrhieerdn poQsuseiebnisl--L*<br />
land. This is indeed an aspect of the matter which may have had<br />
too little emphasis. ' We all started thinking and talking about<br />
the railway primarily in relation to mining at Mt. Isa and, of<br />
course, it probably remains true that the prospective mining and<br />
smelting expansion at Mt. Isa itself constitutes the chief immediate<br />
need for the railway work, But, as we know from what you<br />
and others have told us, and from our own investigations, the<br />
whole of the North-Western region is rich in possibilities of<br />
other developments, some of them perhaps being likely to materialise<br />
in the not far distant future. I have therefore come to<br />
think of the railway as being vital not only for the Mt. Isa expansion<br />
itself, but for the whole future of Northern Queensland.<br />
Hence, it is clear to us that the financial problem<br />
to which we should look is that of meeting the cost of rebuilding<br />
and re-equipping the whole Collinsville-Mt. Isa railway<br />
at an adequate standard. That, at any rate, is the basis on.<br />
which we have worked, and I know that you see eye to eye with us<br />
in this. Coming now to details, I remember that the estimated<br />
cost of the railway project as a whole, as originally conceived,<br />
was of the order of œ C29 million to œ, 30 million. Those </p>
<p>4 2.<br />
figures, I believe, allowed fairly substantially for increases<br />
in construction costs that might occur during the time the railway<br />
was being built, for interest on capital during the construc<br />
-tion period, and for certain improvements of a general nature<br />
which the Queensland Railway System would, sooner or later, have<br />
had to face. Next, as I recalled a little earlier, you said<br />
that your State would be able to find from its own resources<br />
over a period of five years, from œ E8 million to œ 10O millionto<br />
wards the cost of the railway. You thought that this might entail<br />
some sacrifice of work elsewhere but you plainly rated the<br />
importance of the railway improvements so highly that you were<br />
prepared to face up to this.<br />
It appears, then that your essential unsatisfied<br />
requirements is for a sum of HO0 million over the period it may<br />
take to carry out the railway rehabilitation work. My collagues<br />
and I have now decided that the Commonwealth will offer<br />
to underwrite the provision of this sum on the terms and in the<br />
manner I shall now state.<br />
We would provide the money initially by way of<br />
advances from the Commonwealth to the State of Queensland as the<br />
railway work proceeds and pro rata to expenditure on the project<br />
by Queensland during that period from -its own resources.<br />
The Commonwealth would charge interest on these<br />
advances, as from the date at which each advance was made, during<br />
the construction period but it would not expect repayment<br />
of the principal to begin until the designated date for the completion<br />
of the railway work. Thereafter, it would require equal<br />
annual ~ instalments of interest and principal sufficient to pay<br />
off the total amount advanced over twenty years from the designated<br />
date of completion of the railway.<br />
While not wishing to become involved in details of<br />
the project, the Commonwealth would naturally desire to be satisfied<br />
that it would be carried out at an adequate standard of<br />
construction and equipment. We envisage in effect, that in<br />
essentials, though not necessarily in all particulars, it would<br />
follow the broad lines set out in the Ford Bacon and Davis reports.<br />
On this basis there would have to be an initial estimate<br />
of total cost to which your Government and ours would work in<br />
providing finance pro rata as expenditure on the job required.<br />
In determining the standards, your Government would naturally be<br />
guided by the knowledge that the Commonwealth's contribution<br />
would be œ-20 million. I may say that in making this offer we have had<br />
very much in view that it was just such an arrangement we had<br />
under discussion when last year, we were negotiating for a<br />
loan from the International Bank. I believe I am quite right in<br />
saying that you then regarded such an arrangement as both suitable<br />
for the financing of the railway and as acceptable to your<br />
Government. Hence it seemed to us that we could not do better<br />
than to revive the arrangement which had so much thought at that<br />
time, and on which both your Government and ours were agreed<br />
both as to broad principles and as to the main details. If I<br />
could put it so, we are now proposing to place ourselves in the<br />
position we would have occupied had we been able to secure a<br />
loan from the International Bank but with the substantial difforence<br />
that we ourselves will now be assuming in addition the<br />
obligations which earlier we had hoped would have fallen upon<br />
that institution. The same consideration has guided us in determining<br />
the matter of interest rates. While it is not easy to find a </p>
<p>4 3.<br />
generally satisfactory criterion for this, we think it fair to<br />
propose that the rates of interest the Commonwealth should charg3<br />
on the advances made from time to time to Queensland should be<br />
the same as those currently set by the International Bank for new<br />
loans to member countries. You will readily appreciate that the<br />
Commonwealth will still have ahead of it the job of raising money<br />
for the advances it makes to Queensland, and we will certainly be<br />
following up all possibilities of raising such money abroad.<br />
This is for the very good reason of importance to the States<br />
as well as to the Commonwealth that anything we can raise<br />
abroad over and above what might be called normal loan raisings<br />
will enable us to avoid any diminution of the amounts that would<br />
otherwise be available to the Commonwealth and the States for<br />
other developmental purposes. It is, of course, quite impossible<br />
to foresee what any money raised abroad will cost but, as a<br />
broad judgment, the rate currently charged by the International<br />
Bank ought to provide a fair reflection and index of the cost of<br />
international loans to Governments. Should it subsequently<br />
prove that some part of our advances to you can be recouped from<br />
special borrowings overseas on better than International Bank<br />
terms, we should be propared to negotiate an adjustment on the<br />
interest charges to give you the benefit of any advantage so<br />
obtained. You will have observed that we wish to make no condition<br />
about the terms of any freight agreement that may be made<br />
butween the Queensland Railways and Mt. Isa Mines Ltd. for the<br />
carriage of their goods on the railway. As I said to you in my<br />
letter of 28th August the Commonwealth regards the ultimate responsibility<br />
in this matter as belonging to the Government of<br />
Queensland and we for our part are not divposed to insist upon<br />
specific legal undertakings from the Company as a condition of<br />
our helping to finance the work on your railway system. However,<br />
I am sure you will have very much in mind the importance of securing<br />
such terms and conditions for the carriage of goods upon<br />
the railway as will guarantee that the large financial outlays<br />
on the re-building of the line will produce an adequate return<br />
of revenue. The main points in the Commonwealth offer are restated<br />
in the Annexure, There will be numerous matters of detail<br />
to clarify between your Government and ours. I am bound to<br />
say, however, that in making the above proposal to you we feel<br />
that we are fully recognising the great national interest involved<br />
in the projected work and that the terms I have set forth<br />
are, in all the circumstances, both fair and practicable.<br />
Yours sincerely,<br />
( Sgd) R. G. Menzies<br />
PRIME MINISTER,, </p>
<p>ANNEXURE<br />
SUMMARY TERMS OF THE COIAMONIEIATH OFFER<br />
The State will as soon as practicable, determine the nature<br />
and extent of' the works to be undertaken and the estimated<br />
total cost thereof.<br />
The State will provide the Commonwealth with a general de<br />
scription of the works and an estimate of the phasing of<br />
expenditure within each year of the construction period.<br />
In the light of this information the State and the Commonwealth<br />
will agree upon a designated date for completion of<br />
the project.<br />
( L4) The Commonwealth, provided it is satisfied that the works<br />
to be undertaken conform generally with its present understanding<br />
of the nature of the project, offers<br />
to underwrite the provision of funds to the State aggregating<br />
not more than œ-20 million for expenditure on<br />
the project;<br />
to make advances in each year of the construction period<br />
equal to that proportion of actual expenditure in<br />
that year on the project which œ 20_ million bears to<br />
the initially estimated total cost of the project.<br />
() The State will agree<br />
to carry out the project as described to the Commonwealth;<br />
to pay interest during the construction period on each<br />
advance at the lending rate of interest ( and commission)<br />
determined by the International Bank from time<br />
to time for new loans of not less than twenty years<br />
currency; to repay, in equal annual instalments over the twenty<br />
years commencing from the designated date for completion<br />
of the project, the amount necessary to amortize<br />
the aggregate amount of the advances made up to that<br />
date, including ( subject to paragraph 6( a) hereof) interest<br />
on the outstanding balances at a rate which<br />
shall be equal to the weighted average rate of interest<br />
payable on advances made in each year of the construction<br />
period.<br />
The State and the Commonwealth agree<br />
to negotiate a reduction in the rate of interest specified<br />
in paragraph 5( c) if the Commonwealth is able to<br />
borrow the whole or part of the advances overseas on<br />
more favourable terms than the average rate specified<br />
above; to negotiate the terms of any further advances if the<br />
advances made before the designated completion date<br />
fall short of œ-20 million and the project is still<br />
uncompleted. </p>
