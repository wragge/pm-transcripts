PRIME MINISTER<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING, MP<br />
FAREWELL TO HIS HOLINESS, POPE JOHN PAUL 11<br />
SYDNEY AIRPORT FRIDAY, 20 JANUARY 1995<br />
Your Holiness, we are sorry to see you go.<br />
Your visit will leave memories which millions of Australians will always cherish.<br />
It is a pity that we were not able to share you with more of Australia.<br />
But had you been able to travel more widely I can assure you that the warmth of<br />
Sydney's welcome would have been repeated in every other city and community<br />
across the continent.<br />
I trust that you will leave us in the knowledge that Sydney welcomed you on behalf of<br />
all Australia.<br />
And I know all Australia will join with me in thanking you for making the long journey to<br />
bestow a great honour on Mary MacKillop.<br />
It is true that women as much as men pioneered this country, but their contribution<br />
has not always been truly acknowledged.<br />
The labour and love, the courage and perseverance, and not least the moral strength<br />
that women brought to the frontier of Australia, and now bring to the modern<br />
Australian community, have been fundamental defining forces in Australia's<br />
development. In honouring this great Australian woman you have honoured all Australian women<br />
and all Australians.<br />
Your Holiness, you have also reminded us of where greatness in nations lies.<br />
In Mary MacKillop the greatness was, as you said, in her openness and generosity to<br />
others, in her sense of justice and in the unconquerable courage which she brought to<br />
the task of seeing justice done. </p>
<p>We recognise that it is much the same with nations: that the promise and potential of<br />
Australia principally lie in these great human qualities.<br />
In other words, the promise lies in our people.<br />
When you spoke of the need for harmony and solidarity with one another we heard<br />
you very clearly.<br />
This is a country of deep democratic traditions. It is also a society of many cultures.<br />
These days we are very conscious of the need to marry our traditions and institutions<br />
with tolerance and openness towards others.<br />
This is what we mean by multiculturalism in Australia.<br />
In recent years we have concentrated our efforts on developing policies of inclusion,<br />
by which we mean policies which draw all Australians into the mainstream of our<br />
national life.<br />
This has driven our response to the challenge of Aboriginal Australia, in which you<br />
expressed particular interest yesterday and on your last visit.<br />
The same sentiment drives our approach to building a culturally diverse but cohesive<br />
society. We recognise that we will not create a more cohesive and stronger Australia without<br />
creating a fairer and more just Australia.<br />
When we talk of inclusion, therefore, we mean that the poor and disadvantaged must<br />
not be left without care. We mean the basic comforts and opportunities to lead<br />
fulfilling lives must be extended to them.<br />
We do not say we have done enough, but these are our priorities and we know very<br />
well what you mean, Your Holiness, when you say that our response to such human<br />
needs now will largely determine the kind of society we pass on to future generations<br />
of Australians.<br />
We know that there is no greater challenge facing us than the challenge of our youth.<br />
There have been developments in the modern world which have the potential to<br />
greatly improve the lives of people and yet those same developments have the<br />
potential to impoverish them.<br />
We know that technological progress, like the wealth that will flow from our economic<br />
growth, will never be enough. </p>
<p>Experience tells us as the lesson of Mary MacKillop tells us that our young people<br />
need both a sense of purpose and a sense of belonging.<br />
They need what Mary MacKillop understood so well they need hope. And they need<br />
what she had so abundantly they need faith.<br />
We recognise the truth in what you say when you speak of " a growing sense of the<br />
need for a moral and spiritual renewal".<br />
And we know that it demands of all of us in positions of influence from political<br />
leaders to parents and teachers that we address the spiritual needs of our children.<br />
Your Holiness, you leave us conscious of the great honour you have done us on this<br />
brief visit and mindful of the message you have brought.<br />
On behalf of all Australians I thank you and wish you a safe return. </p>
