PRIME MINISTER'S PRESS CONFERENCE<br />
PARLIAMENT HOUSE, CANBERRA<br />
TUESDAY, 24 SEPTEMBER 1974<br />
. PRIME MINISTER: Have you any questions?<br />
QUESTION: You have made some grave charges against some of your<br />
colleagues of peddling lies. Do you propose to ask for or seek<br />
their resignation from the Cabinet? If not, do you propose to<br />
continue to lead a ministerial team among which are some<br />
ministers against whom you have made such grave charges?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I have not made grave charges; I haven't made the<br />
charges that you have just peddled. I was asked a question in<br />
the House about this; I andwered it. Several of ; you were at<br />
the dinner last night and recorded what I said. Play the whole<br />
of it! Nobody at the dinner was under any misapprehension as<br />
to what I meant.<br />
QUESTION: Do you repudiate it?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I never made the charges.<br />
QUESTION: ' If those charges were not made, certainly there have been<br />
implications that they were. Could you tell us exactly what you<br />
did say in relation to what has been said here today?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No. I invite you to play the tapn-that you took<br />
of my whole speech. I do not respond here to invitations to pick<br />
and select what I have said or to comment on interpretatiodn* I<br />
don't recall on this or any other matter that any of my colleagues<br />
in or outside the Cabinet have knowingly given false information.<br />
I do believe that there are many people in public life including<br />
the Parliament, as I have said; on both sides, in each House,<br />
front benchears and backbenchers who too readily and-uncritically<br />
accept information which is given to them. They ought to<br />
scrutinise it before spreading it or publicising it. I believe<br />
some of the people that have given the information know it to be<br />
false. They are the people who make the lies. But people ought<br />
to be scrupulous in giving currency to false information. They<br />
ought to check the accuracy of the information.<br />
QUESTION: Have any of your colleagues sought clarification today<br />
of your statement last night?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No. There were several of them there,. You weren't<br />
there. There were a great number of people invited. Who was<br />
there from my side? There was Mr Connor, there was Sonator<br />
Jim McClelland, there was Mr Anthony, there was SaEnator Cotton,<br />
Mr Gorton.<br />
QUESTION: Could I read an extract from your speech last night?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No, you won't. No. You have the whole of the text,<br />
haven't you?<br />
QUESTION: Yes, sir.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well, play the lot of it. / 2 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
QUESTION: Yes, but I<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No, if you don't mind.<br />
QUESTION: This is quoting from you in the House today', if that's<br />
allowed. You indicated that you thought that this Gcvernment would<br />
succumb, admittedly less readily, to the conspiracy br~ uween the<br />
unions and the multinationals. Do you think that this Government....<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I didn't use the word " conspiracy".<br />
QUESTION: Oh well, to the arrangement.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: " Collusion" was the term I used, wasn't it? Yes.<br />
QUESTION: The collusion between the unions and the multinationals.<br />
Do you think your colleagues are about to cave in on the motor<br />
industry?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I think that some of them, after hearing some pleas<br />
from some particular sections of the motor industry, are likely to<br />
have misgivings about the recommendations of the Industries Assistance<br />
Commission. Anybody who has read the IAC report will know that<br />
there has been a rort at the expense of the Australian consumer in<br />
many aspects of the motor industry. But the whole of the motor<br />
industry is being consulted at this moment; I feel sure there will<br />
be some changes in the proposals that the IAC made.<br />
QUESTION: What arm of Government the AIDC or the Atomic Energy<br />
Commission or what will be responsible for underwriting tlie<br />
new share issue of Mary Kathleen uranium that the governm ent announced<br />
it would do recently but didn't specify the agency? Was this<br />
decision taken through Cabinet? And thirdly, what briefly was the<br />
justification for saving the underwriting cost which was to be borne<br />
by the predominantly foreign-owned CRA from underwriting a venture<br />
which most ' financial commentators see as not very attractive at all?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: The proper minister to ask about what agency will<br />
provide the money would be Mr Connor or Dr Cairns. There are<br />
companies operating in Australia which have obligations to supply<br />
uranium overseas. The Australian Government is, of course,<br />
conscious that such contracts must be honoured. The proposals<br />
which have been made will help those contracts to be honoured. CRA<br />
will be less overseas controlled as a result of the arrangements.<br />
QUESTION: Last night you said, quote, " I have nothing but contempt<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Now, Mr Kelly, I invite any of you to publish<br />
the speech in full but, if you don't mind, I will not respond here<br />
to questions based on some selected pieces of a speech which I am<br />
told took over half an hour.<br />
QUESTION: Can I ask....<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No, not on this. </p>
<p>* QUESTION: Do you retract anything you said last night, Prime Minister?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No, of course not. After all, I have invited you to<br />
play the whole of the speech, so I am scarcely retracting anything<br />
I said.<br />
QUESTION: If you know of any people who knowingly giv.-the Government<br />
false information what action can you take or will you take against<br />
these people?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: One is wary of them in future. I would make the<br />
point that people who give exaggerated or false information, that is<br />
misinformation, to the Government are not only lowering themselves<br />
in the eyes of the Government and spoiling their cases for assistance<br />
but, of course, they are wanting the Government to help them take<br />
the public down. All I want ip that the facts should be known.<br />
QUESTION: What action will you take against your colleagues who<br />
promote that false information?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I have taken it.<br />
QUESTION: Could you tell us what it is?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: The speech last night will make people, I am quite<br />
certain, more careful in checking the sources of the information<br />
they are given.<br />
QUESTION: Can you give us any examples of this misleading information,<br />
how widespread...<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I quoted three last night. I am sorry you weren't<br />
there. QUESTION: Well, for the radio and television audience now, Prime<br />
Minister PRIME MINISTER: No, if you don't mind, you can play the tape.<br />
QUESTION: But that's not much use to the audience who are watching<br />
and listening to this.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I am sorry they weren't there last night, but on<br />
your radio station you can play the lot.<br />
QUESTION: Last week Senator Willesee, as Foreign minister, released<br />
copies of letters he had sent to Australian companies with<br />
subsidiaries or associates in South Africa suggesting that they should<br />
do several things to upgrade the conditions of black and coloured<br />
employees in South Africa. Has the Government any power at all to<br />
enforce such improvements, and does the Government intend to take<br />
any action to try to enforce improvements or is this just a general<br />
moral exhortation which will probably be ignored?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: We might not have any sanctions against the companies<br />
concerned. They are not breaking any Australian law. There might not<br />
be any law that the Australian Parliament can make about it. They<br />
aren't breaking South African laws. But other countries have, for<br />
some time past, used this method of spurring th6ir subsidiaries the<br />
companies who are domiciled in their countries but who have<br />
subsidiaries in South Africa they have used these methods to spur </p>
<p>-4-<br />
them to improve conditions in South Africa. Particularly the<br />
United States and the United Kingdom have done it; but the<br />
Scandinavians, West Germany and, I think, above all, Canada have<br />
done so. It was time we did it; there has been some improvement<br />
as a result of what the other governments have done. V~ hope there<br />
will be some improvement on the part of subsidiaries ot ,. LiJtralian<br />
companies.<br />
QUESTION: I was thinking specifically of things like exchange<br />
coming back to Australia from these subsidiaries and possible<br />
taxing powers on companies. You had nothing of that sort in mind?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I would doubt it.<br />
QUESTION: Back to your speech last night. In the course of that<br />
you referred to nervous Nellies in your party on tariff matters.<br />
Could you give us any examples or indicate the areas in which we<br />
might find these nervous Nellies?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Now, if the tape is played I haven't got a<br />
copy of it you will find that I was not just referring to<br />
nervous Nellies in my party. I said nervous Nellies in public<br />
life, including in the. Parliament, and there were some of them<br />
in my party.'<br />
QUESTION: Well, that was the point I<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Yes. Well, I am not going to specify it, no.<br />
QUESTION: After the Budget last week you made a strong speechdi<br />
in which you said that the Budget laid the groundwork for<br />
co-operation and restraint. Will the policies outlined in that<br />
Budget work if you don't get wage restraint? If not, will you take<br />
action on a different policy?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: The policies in the Budget will obviously work much<br />
more effectively and promptly if there is wage restraint. No<br />
Government in Australia can deal with all these matters which have<br />
to be done in the economy. There are a great number of things<br />
which have to be done by employers, employees and investors and<br />
the Budget would encourage all of them to do some of those things.<br />
It is important for employees to understand that the Government's<br />
policy of restraint in the growth of wages and other incomes doesn't<br />
mean that the Government intends to reduce the purchasing power of<br />
wages. When we use the word " wage restraint" we don't mean that<br />
we mean to reduce the real level of wages or the level of real wages.<br />
What we want to do is to discourage the excessive claims which were<br />
being made and the frequency of those claims. One of the things we<br />
are doing is to help the indexation of wages, the restoration of<br />
automatic, periodic wage adjustments. When this comes about, as<br />
there seems to be a very good chance of it * coming about as a result<br />
of agreements between employers and employees at Mr Justice Moore's<br />
conferences, then there will clearly be less incentive for employeesblue<br />
collarwhite collar employees to make exaggerated claims.<br />
They will know that indexation will maintain the level of their real<br />
income. I am hopeful that the ACTU unions at present meeting in<br />
Sydney will bring about a situation where the overwhelming majority<br />
of trade unions will co-operate with the Government which is pledged<br />
to fight inflation and to minimise unemployment using policy<br />
instruments which will be fair and equitable over the community as<br />
a whole. </p>
<p>QUESTION: Do you think the unemployment caused by tariff cuts has<br />
been serious? What action do you think is needed against it? And<br />
specifically, can I ask you your view on the arrangements between<br />
the Government and the unions to impose quotas on certain'items<br />
made in the announcement last Friday?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: There has been serious unemployment brought about<br />
in some regions. As a result partly of the tariff reduction and<br />
partly as a result of revaluation, and maybe partly as a result of<br />
reducing the excessive liquidity. You ask about restoring tariffs,<br />
is that it? Or imposing quotas?<br />
QUESTION: I was asking specifically about the decision last Friday<br />
to impose quotas on textiles?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: This is from South Korea. Previously you will<br />
remember there were agreements made with Hong Kong, India and<br />
China. Also, since they are not in GATT, restrictions were imposed<br />
on Taiwan. The general emphasis on what we are doing is to maintain<br />
employment, either by giving assistance to those particular textile<br />
factories or to other forms of employment in the regions concerned.<br />
I am not attracted to the idea of imposing quotas all over or<br />
increasing tariffs all over or placing embargoes or refusing to<br />
unload cargoes because these would help areas where help is not<br />
required. There is a problem which we are tackling in certain<br />
non-metropolitan areas.<br />
QUESTION: The situation concerning information coming-to the<br />
Government which prompted you to make those remarks last night.,<br />
do you think that that posed a real threat to the drive for'*<br />
tariff reform which has been one of the features of your Government?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I very real threat, yes, I do.<br />
QUESTION: Do you think that the threat is silly, and d6 you<br />
accept that you are in the vanguard of your own party in questions<br />
of tariff reform and particularly to the fore of your deputy?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: There is a continuing threat to the rational use<br />
of resources in Australia by the misinformation which is sedulously<br />
peddled by some industries. My deputy and I are in complete<br />
agreement, constant consultation, on all these aspects. There is<br />
no disagreement; there hasn't been; there is most unlikely to be.<br />
But I do believe that the press has some obligation too in letting<br />
the public know the facts. Very often, I regret to say, lobbyists<br />
are able to get their stories in the newspapers, including sometimes<br />
in your own. Now, you are all commendably inquisitive or critical<br />
or cynical about things that elected people say, iuncluding ministers<br />
or the Prime Minster himself. You are quite reightly critical in<br />
these matters but you are not, if I may sa-y so, sufficiently critical<br />
of some of the stories that are giveni to you by lobbyists.<br />
I wohldv e toucjt Lhat the reports of Industries<br />
Assistance Commission, of which the establishment was one of the<br />
triumphs of my Government so far, would illustrate how much the public<br />
are taken down by the rorts which have grown up behind Government<br />
assistance of one form and another. I don't want to see policies<br />
which were taken at an easier economic time reversed or abandoned too<br />
readily. If hardship is being caused to individuals then that<br />
hardship must be alleviated promptly and fully. But there is no<br />
excuse for using the hardship of some communities to impose on the </p>
<p>-6-<br />
whole community for the benefit of some industries in some areas<br />
where no assistance is justified.<br />
I was speaking last night at this Heavy Engineering<br />
Manufacturers dinner and I pointed out that manufacturers, in general<br />
in Australia, should get out of the purely negative, defensive<br />
attitude of saying that their future depends upon Governments<br />
imposing tariffs on competing imports or imposing embargoes or quotas<br />
on competing imports or paying subsidies for certain local products<br />
or allowing taxation deductions for the production of certain local<br />
products. A much more positive way to assist basic industries in<br />
Australia is to have a rational, procurement program by governments.<br />
Now the industries concerned last night were particularly<br />
apt to benefit from rational programs. I pointed out that the heavy<br />
engineering manufacturers depend very greatly on orders coming from<br />
the public sector and my Government has tried, conspicuously in the<br />
transport field, to see that there are forward orders for that<br />
industry. The industry will be much more assisted by, say, a<br />
re-equipment program for the railways or a proper national roads program<br />
or pipeline program or I know this one is more difficult a<br />
shipbuilding program, in all of which government orders are crucial,<br />
sometimes a predominant factor, than those industries will be<br />
assisted by just putting up the price of everything for the Australian<br />
consumer. I believe the message got across there.<br />
Naturally enough I also commended them for the fact that<br />
they do not tender or peddle misinformation. They are an effective<br />
industry association and I think them for the fact that they have<br />
publicly expressed support for some of the policies which my<br />
Government has proposed to help them gain export markets. We still<br />
don't have an export bank in Australia. We are going to establish<br />
one. We still don't have an overseas trading corporation. My<br />
Government is going to establish one. And the Heavy Engineering<br />
Manufacturers have not opposed, in fact they have very often<br />
expressed support for, the expansion of the Australian Industry<br />
Development Corporation, the Pipeline Authority, the Petroleum<br />
and Minerals Authority, the Australian Government Purchasing<br />
Commission. They are a good body, but one's entitled to draw the<br />
contrast. One takes notice of an organisation which collects and<br />
submits accurate information and cogent arguments. By contrast some<br />
other industries ought to understand that if they give misinformation,<br />
not only is the Government less likely to be impressed, but the<br />
public also ought to be alerted.<br />
QUESTION: Do you believe that the strong stand which you are now<br />
taking on tariff protection could prejudice the efforts of your<br />
Government to secure support from the trade union movement for wage<br />
restraint? If you do believe that, are you prepared to modify the<br />
stand you are currently taking?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I don't believe that anything I've said would be<br />
resented or resisted by most responsible trade union people. After<br />
all, I am certain that trade unions as well as companies and<br />
governments will only have public support if the public is certain<br />
that they are acting on accurate information. The public shouldn't<br />
the government shouldn't blithely accept an imposition on the<br />
taxpayer for the benefit of people who can't make out an accurate,<br />
honest case. </p>
<p>-7-<br />
QUESTION: My question goes back to your earlier comment on wage<br />
indexation. if agreement can be reached with the union movement<br />
on the introduction of wage indexation, would you see n-vrit in the<br />
system of tax indexation which would ensure the cost of -iving<br />
increases granted are not taken away again in higher taxation?<br />
In other words, when the cost of living rises push a worker into a<br />
higher tax scale, can he be sure that the real cost of living<br />
adjustment, the adjustment for inflation, will not be diminished<br />
by higher income tax?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: There are many attractive features about tax<br />
indexation. I was discussing them with Mr van Lennep the Secretary-<br />
General of the OECD about 12 days ago. Mr Crean, however, has<br />
pointed out that it might be better still to have an annual review<br />
of the tax schedule. Tax indexation would preserve the present<br />
ratio of incomes to taxation but it would do nothing to remove the<br />
unfair features of the present scale of the scale which there<br />
was until Mr Crean announced the changes, the firs * t changes for<br />
years in the Budget last Tuesday. So I don't want to discount<br />
the advantages of having tax indexation but I believe to have an<br />
annual review of the tax scales and, as Mr Crean has done for the<br />
first time last Tuesday,' would have advantages in that it would be<br />
more fair.<br />
QUESTION: You said that there were allegations made that somewhere<br />
in the vicinity of 900 people had been laid off in the textile<br />
industry in Launceston. When investigations were made into that it<br />
was shown that only 360 people were being laid off.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No, 340.<br />
* QUESTION: 340. Well, you said 360 last night.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I was speaking, you will remember, from memory<br />
of a glance at the report. I have now seen the report again.<br />
QUESTION: So that we may be better informed on the effects of<br />
your tariff decisions, is it possible for that report into Launceston<br />
to be released?<br />
PRIME MINTSTFlR: Mr Cameron soJ-. qht And got. 1% he report. You should<br />
ask him.<br />
QUESTION: Prime Minister, if you can get agreement on indexation<br />
and wage restraint from the union movement would you see any merit<br />
in going again to the people to try to get wage and price control<br />
at a referendum so that that indexation and restraint: could be<br />
imposed both ways?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: As all of you would know quite 1 " ell, i believe 1-he<br />
Australian Parliament ought to have tho ame ai-tliori ty ; avz), . i. aos<br />
with respect to prices and incomes and interest rates that every<br />
n. ther national government has. Nevertheless I have to look at tK-c!<br />
timing of these matters. I expect that after the next meetinq of tht-<br />
Constitutional Convention, which is in the first full we-ek of<br />
': o' 7ember, there will. be agreement between most Governments in<br />
-u. Lc--aif I wouldn't like to forecast that the agreement of the<br />
Queensland Government would be forthcoming on the proposal for<br />
interchange of power which one or tow governm~ ent New South Wales </p>
<p>and there might have been another one too suggested at the<br />
Convention in September last year and which I accepted. Most Premiers,<br />
I believe all Premiers except Bjelke-Petersen and Sir Charles Court,<br />
have accepted the draft which was prepared by the Parli,... e2ntary<br />
draftsman and circulated. There is a very good chance of such a<br />
referendum therefore being endorsed by the leaders of the Governments<br />
or the majority of the Governments in Australia. Also, one ought<br />
to expect that there should be a referendum on say, syncronising,<br />
the two Houses and perhaps abolishing appeals to the Privy Council<br />
and also simplifying the industrial laws. As you remember, the<br />
Constitution says that the Australian Parliament can only pass laws<br />
with respect to conciliation and arbitration for the settlement<br />
of industrial disputes extending beyond the limits of any one State.<br />
It would be very much better if the Parliament had constitutional<br />
power to pass laws with respect to conciliation and arbitration<br />
for the settlement of industrial disputes.<br />
QUESTION: Are you suggesting there that you would hold these<br />
referendums simultaneously?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I mention a range of ones. Let me see what the<br />
options are.. Clearly one would plan to hold any referendums at<br />
the same time as there was a Senate election.<br />
Gentlemen, I will be seeing some of you within the next<br />
fortnight, I believe, in the South Seas and in North A ' merica.<br />
Perhaps I could give you the expected itinerary. On Friday we will<br />
go to Rarotonga in the Cook Islands where there is a meeting--of<br />
the South Pacific Commission. The Government will be represented<br />
by Mr Morrison and the Parliament by Senators Primmer and Bonner.<br />
I am inviting them to come with me and we will spend the morning<br />
the dateline of course will mean that it will still be Friday<br />
morning with the delegates to the South Pacific Conference. We<br />
will then go to New York for the General Assembly and then to<br />
Washington on Wednesday 2nd October where I will meet President Ford;<br />
on Friday 4 October to Ottawa where I will meet Mr Trudeau; and<br />
I am going back to " meet the Press" in Washington on 6 October.<br />
Then we are going to Fiji, which is celebrating the 100th anniversary<br />
of the cession to Britain. Prince Charles is also attending those<br />
celebrations. It is the first time that a senior ininisLer from<br />
Australia has ever visited Fiji and they have become a bit restive<br />
at that fact. Thert we will. go to Norfolk Island, which Captain Cook<br />
discovered, as far as Europeans are concerned, on 10 October 1774.<br />
So I am looking forward immensely to the company of those distinguished<br />
members of thje gallery whose proprietors have sponsored them. </p>
