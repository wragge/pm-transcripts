PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
INTERVIEW WITH RON EDWARDS, RADIO 6PR, 26 JULY 1995<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
RE: There's a lot happening on the national political scene recently,<br />
including the impact of the Queensland election. I'm joined on the line<br />
by Prime Minister Paul Keating. How are you?<br />
PM: How are you, Ron?<br />
RE: Now, Paul, first of all what is your assessment of the outcome of the<br />
Queensland election. We now know that Wayne Goss is back<br />
narrowly, is that a setback for you?<br />
PM: I don't think necessarily it's a setback. Put it this way it would have<br />
been a clear setback for the Labor Party nationally had he lost but he<br />
hasn't. It is a reduced majority and we always like to see our majorities<br />
maintained and I just think it means that he has made clear he will try<br />
to understand why there was such a vote of disaffection with his<br />
Government and I think from a Federal perspective we will be<br />
interested in what we believe that sort of inquiry brings.<br />
RE: Yes, he certainly said that, there will be an inquiry. Ass you move<br />
around the electorate, people like Wayne Goss and yourself get<br />
messages from the voters about the things that are worrying them.<br />
What are they saying to you at the moment, the worries that they have<br />
got as far as the economy or politics are concerned?<br />
PM: Well I think there is doubt about the economy and this is the great pity<br />
I think because we have just had, you know, confirmation again today<br />
of low inflation, in today's consumer price index. We have got the<br />
economy running at a sustainable rate of growth. We are seeing, last<br />
week, 50,000 job growth for the month, bringing employment, since the<br />
last election, to 630,000, which is an enormous number. We are<br />
seeing strong investment, the stock market hit its high for the year a<br />
week ago. So I do think, though, there is this view about that, you<br />
know, John Howard put around this sort of terrible little lie which the<br />
Reserve Bank Governor exposed, that we are having five minutes of </p>
<p>2<br />
economic sunshine. Well after the next quarter, we will have had four<br />
straight years of growth. Come the next quarter, we will have had four<br />
straight years of growth since the recession in 1991 and I think the sort<br />
of attempts by the Opposition to sabotage the economy, to say that all<br />
is not well, it does eke its impact on the community.<br />
RE: Are you satisfied with the gains on the interest rates front because<br />
there was some doubt earlier in the year as to what the direction of<br />
rates would be? We have seen recently some encouraging signs.<br />
What does the future hold for us then?<br />
PM: Well I think the most encouraging sign there was basically the long<br />
rates which are set in the market place. We saw them come down by<br />
about a percentage point, that is the ten year bonds, and that was<br />
because of the Budget coming back into surplus and the main guide to<br />
where interest rates will go in the longer term is inflation and demand.<br />
We have got inflation today making clear that we have basically left<br />
behind now high inflation, further confirmation of low inflation. You<br />
would remember that we did the Accord a couple of weeks ago, which<br />
says that the wages system will be run to produce 2 to 3 per cent<br />
inflation.<br />
RE: So you think you have been able to lock in some industrial stability and<br />
reasonably moderate wage increases?<br />
PM: I thought the Accord Mark VIII was a phenomenal document. I mean<br />
here we are in a period of industrial disputation lower now than at any<br />
time since we have been keeping the records and with the trade union<br />
movement endorsing the Reserve Bank's inflation target of 2 to<br />
3 per cent. That is a tremendously encouraging outcome for<br />
Australians, I believe, and we are seeing the economy come to a<br />
sustainable rate of growth, Ron. So you put all those things together<br />
and I think people can look forward to, and of course that phenomenal<br />
employment coming through, I think people can look to the<br />
continuation of stable, low inflationary, economic growth with<br />
employment.<br />
RE: Does it worry you when we get our monthly balance of payments<br />
result?<br />
PM: Well some worry me more than others, of course. But the Opposition<br />
are going around talking about the Current Account Deficit as if it is<br />
the only economic indicator which matters. 2 1/ 2 years ago the only<br />
indicator which matters was the right to a job unemployment and the<br />
Government committing itself at the election to bring Australia, to bring<br />
more employment to this country. As I said to you, we have had<br />
670,000, I think I said earlier 630,000. It is actually 670,000 jobs in<br />
2 1/ 2 years. So that is the hardest thing for any Government in<br />
Australia to deliver, that is growth and employment. That is what,<br />
in fact, we have delivered. And I think about the current account, </p>
<p>people look at that and the debt and if they take John Howard at his<br />
word, they would swear blind the debt was their's. If BHP decides to<br />
spend $ 1.8 billion on a new iron plant in Western Australia, that is for<br />
the BHP Board to decide. It is for lenders abroad to decide whether<br />
they want to lend, that company, or this economy, on those sorts of<br />
investments. In other words, they're consenting decisions between<br />
consenting adults. For the Government to be saying to BHP how dare<br />
you build a new iron plant. Of course if BHP wants to build an iron<br />
plant, that is for them. But this notion that the debt belongs to every<br />
Australian person. I mean when Alan Bond's company failed to be<br />
able to meet its obligations to the tune of $ 3 to $ 4 billion, from<br />
memory, there were no mums and dads picking that up. It was picked<br />
up by the banks who lent from abroad.<br />
RE: Well if we can talk tactics for a minute and about John Howard.<br />
John Hewson gave you a large target with Fightback and all its<br />
ramifications. John Howard has declared that he will give you very<br />
little targets and when you look at it as a tactic, it seemed to work for<br />
Mr Borbidge in Queensland and, at this stage, it seems to be working<br />
for John Howard. How do you propose to counter that?<br />
PM: I think the old hardline, right wing, John Howard is coming out, it is<br />
seeping out from the pores of his skin because when he did the<br />
Headland speech, his last one so-called Headland speech the<br />
definition of a Headland speech is the thing you say when you are<br />
saying nothing and get front page coverage. But it has worked so far<br />
for him. But in this last one he said he is going to hop into labour<br />
market reform and have big cuts in Government spending. Now that is<br />
a confirmation that there is no shift in his policy position. Every<br />
Australian person should understand when John Howard talks about<br />
labour market reform, he is talking about cutting the wages of working<br />
Australians. He doesn't believe there should be a no disadvantage<br />
test. See at the moment, under our legislation, if someone makes an<br />
individual contract, or makes an enterprise bargain, we have a no<br />
disadvantage test to make sure that worker, or groups of workers, will<br />
not be worse off. Howard will abolish that and basically push the<br />
minimum, break the Award minimums, which underpin the Australian<br />
industrial relations structure. So he is out there saying, and I think<br />
people should understand this, whenever John Howard says " labour<br />
market reform", read: cutting wages of low to middle income<br />
Australians. That is what he means. When he says, as he did in the<br />
Headland speech as well, " we are going to have a large cut in<br />
Government spending", read: cuts to pharmaceutical payments for<br />
pensioners; read: cuts in payments to schools; read: cuts in family<br />
support payments because as Ralph Willis can tell you and I can tell<br />
you having been through the Commonwealth Budget now on about<br />
or 22 occasions, we know the outlays pretty well and the other<br />
Ministers in this country. I can assure you there is no way you can cut<br />
$ 8to$ 10 billion out of Commonwealth spending without cutting </p>
<p>pensioners pharmaceuticals, or payments to schools, or family<br />
support.<br />
RE: Mightn't John Howard say that you are putting words in his mouth, he<br />
hasn't said all of those things?<br />
PM: No, but he has made that very clear. I mean he has made it clear that<br />
he is going to have he said big cuts in Government spending in the<br />
Headland speech. They're talking about a 1 to 2 per cent change in<br />
GDP. That is somewhere between $ 5 and $ 10 billion. Those sort of<br />
cuts can only come from the areas I am telling you, Ron.<br />
RE: Right.<br />
PM: And I am just saying that advisedly. There are no other areas where<br />
that sort of money can come from. And what he has made very clear<br />
about industrial relations, is that there will be no disadvantage test<br />
that will be gone. The no disadvantage test will be taken away and<br />
you will either take the individual wage contract, or you will take the<br />
sack. Now he has this little twist on it saying " oh well, look, we will<br />
leave people to opt out of the Award system if they wish". He is<br />
presuming that Australians don't know that roughly 1.8 million of them<br />
every year, change jobs. For a start you have got all of the people<br />
leaving school taking up jobs for the first time. You have got migrants.<br />
You have got the people who change jobs. About 1.6 to 1.8 million<br />
Australians change jobs every year. Every time they do, they will lose<br />
the Award protections, lose holiday leave loadings, they will lose the<br />
overtime commitments, all of the other elements which make up the<br />
Award will be put asunder and people will be pushed back onto some<br />
unspecified minimum.<br />
RE: Paul, can we now move to your side of politics? Carmen Lawrence<br />
has sustained some political damage in recent days because of events<br />
here in Western Australia. How do you propose to handle this?<br />
PM: Well she has sustained some damage because you have got the<br />
executive branch of Government extending its long arm by employing<br />
a former judge to inquire. The former judge has been given a job by<br />
Richard Court. It is just the same were I to appoint a<br />
Royal Commission to inquire into what John Howard said to<br />
Malcolm Fraser about " bottom of the harbour" tax schemes. What they<br />
said that night after a Cabinet meeting. What they said on the way<br />
into the Cabinet meeting. What they said in Mr Fraser's office.<br />
RE: Wouldn't she be better advised to actually come out and say what<br />
occurred because, at this stage, it looks as though she is trying to<br />
avoid this inquiry process?<br />
PM: No, I think, what she is doing is defending the right of a Member of<br />
Parliament, a traditional right of a Member of Parliament, and </p>
<p>Members of Parliament to go about their activities as an executive,<br />
or as a Cabinet, against the wishes of the executive branch of<br />
Government. In other words, she is defending the right of her<br />
Government and her former Government and her former Cabinet<br />
meetings to enjoy the Parliamentary protections away from an<br />
incoming executive Government.<br />
RE: So you would support her current tactic of going through the court<br />
processes?<br />
PM: Yes because you see Richard Court is abusing for a start he is<br />
abusing the taxpayers of Western Australia by blowing this money on<br />
what is essentially only and it is exclusively a political matter. There is<br />
no question of impropriety here, illegality here. It is only a political<br />
matter.<br />
RE: He would say he is trying to get at the truth of what occurred at the<br />
time.<br />
PM: Well I can say I want to get at the truth. Why did John Howard refuse<br />
the so-called telephone book of letters on the " bottom of the harbour"<br />
tax schemes from Bill O'Reilly, the then Tax Commissioner. I could get<br />
to the truth too and set up a Royal Commission into it. Get Mr O'Reilly<br />
back, get Howard back, get Fraser back. You know what would you<br />
think about that?<br />
RE: So your view is, at this stage, you are standing behind<br />
Carmen Lawrence and see how the events work out?<br />
PM: Absolutely and what you have got here is a cynical abuse of power by<br />
the Western Australian Government extending the judge sitting as<br />
the Royal Commissioner is acting for the Government for<br />
Court [ Richard], the Premier. It is not a legal matter. It is not the court<br />
system. It is not the Parliament, or the court system. This is the<br />
executive and this is a matter of principle. That is, whether the<br />
executive has this power, or ought to have this power, to be able to<br />
require a Member of Parliament to come and account, when Members<br />
of Parliament have enjoyed these protections way back into English<br />
and British history.<br />
RE: Right. Paul, just finally very quickly, policy on France in relation to<br />
nuclear testing. Are we doing enough?<br />
PM: Well we have certainly, I think, made it very much more uncomfortable<br />
for the French Government. I think that all Australians were affronted<br />
by the fact that France, a democracy, is itself affronting smaller States<br />
in the Pacific and we have now, by withdrawing our Ambassador, by<br />
curtailing our defence arrangements with them, by now seeing what we<br />
can support in the United Nations on this issue, by proselytising in the<br />
press as I have in France. All these things, I think, have put pressure </p>
<p>on President Chirac and that pressure is now also coming from the<br />
European States and, more recently, from Japan. I think that is the<br />
thing to do. I have got John Howard who is now these days running<br />
around saying anything that he thinks will suit the moment. Yesterday<br />
he was telling a group of school children that he would suspend<br />
uranium exports to France, when he knows full well that it is not his<br />
Party's policy. He is, at the same time, saying he is thinking about<br />
sending a frigate to Mururoa Atoll. But what happens when the frigate<br />
gets turned around by a French frigate? Do we walk off with our tail<br />
between our legs or do we fire on it. Let me just say this Ron, I don't<br />
think Australians want us to go firing on French ships.<br />
RE: I don't think so.<br />
PM: OK, thanks Ron.<br />
RE: Thanks Paul.<br />
