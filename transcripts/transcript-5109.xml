J~, AUSTRALIA L<br />
FOR MEDIA MONDAY, 16 JULY 1979<br />
ADVISORY COUNCIL FOR INTER-GOVERNMENT RELATIONS<br />
The Prime Minister, Malcolm Fraser, today announced three<br />
appointments to the Advisory Council for Inter-Government<br />
Relations Professor R. C. Gates, as member and Chairman,<br />
the Hon. Haddon Storey, Attorney-General and Minister for<br />
Federal Affairs in the Victorian Parliament and the<br />
Hon. W. D. Lickiss, Minister for Justice and Attorney-General<br />
in the Queensland Parliament as members.<br />
Professor Gates, currently Vice-Chancellor of the University<br />
of New England, has had a distinguished academic career.<br />
He was formerly Head of the Department of Economics at the<br />
University of Queensland. Professor Gates is a member of many<br />
eminent academic and professional associations and is also a<br />
member of the Commonwealth Government's Economic Consultative<br />
Committee. Mr. Fraser said that the Advisory Council for Inter-Government<br />
Relations was an essential feature of the federalism policy<br />
of the Commonwealth Government. The Advisory Council was<br />
established in 1976 with the object of improving inter-government<br />
co-operation. It receives references from the Premiers'<br />
Conference to keep under consideration and review issues for<br />
inter-government co-operation and to recommend ways and means<br />
for improving inter-government co-operation.<br />
The Advisory Council has been given two references. The first<br />
is to examine the relationships which ought to exist between the<br />
three spheres of government. The second is an examination<br />
of interchanges of personnel between the three spheres of<br />
government. Preliminary reports on each reference have<br />
been published.<br />
The Council has 22 members representing Commonwealth, State<br />
and local government and the community. The Secretariat is<br />
located in Hobart.<br />
Mr. Fraser acknowledged the valuable contribution of the<br />
Hon. Peter Howson who has been the Acting Chairman since May<br />
this year when the office of Chairman became vacant on the<br />
resignation of the foundation Chairman, Professor R. L. Mathews.<br />

Mr. Howson chaired a series of public meetings as<br />
part of the information gathering exercise associated<br />
with the major inquiry into the relationships which should<br />
exist between the three levels of government. An<br />
interim report of this inquiry was published recently.<br />
