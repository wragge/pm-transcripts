PRIME MINISTER<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
VISIT TO JAPAN<br />
I will pay a short working visit to Japan on 5 and 6 September.<br />
Japan is Australias single most important economic partner and we have an<br />
increasingly close and broad-ranging dialogue on key regional and global<br />
Issus. I have not yet had an opportunity to meet Prime Minister Murayama and I<br />
attach importance to regular consultations between us. I will also have<br />
discussions with other Japanese political and business leaders.<br />
I expect my talks in Tokyo to focus on regional issues, especially APEC. as<br />
well as on our strong and diverse bilateral relationship.<br />
