AUS&gt; TRALIA<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA SUNDAY 1 JUNE 1980<br />
ADDRESS TO-NATIONAL COUNTRY PARTY CONFERENCE<br />
The partnership between our parties over the last five years has<br />
been a very close and a very constructive one for Australia.<br />
The transformation of this country over this time has been quite<br />
remarkable. Five years ago nobody tried very much. They had been taught<br />
that there was no need to put effort into what they were doing.<br />
People had come to believe, or had been told and promised,<br />
that Governments would and could provide anything, no matter<br />
what they themselves did to earn it.<br />
The pursuit of excellence, the encouragement of initiative; of<br />
enterprise and of investment was just put aside in those years.<br />
In the time since, we have seen a remarkable recovery right<br />
across the broad spectrum of Australia. The great rural industries<br />
of this country have had two reasonable years, and this year also<br />
looks as if it is opening well. It is not often that we have<br />
wool.-and sheep and sugar, beef and wheat, and other rural industries,<br />
all doing reasonably well at the one time. That means a great<br />
deal not only for farmers and pastoralists but obviously for all<br />
of those in country towns and for the industries that service<br />
the rural economy.<br />
We have often underestimated in the past the extent to which<br />
depression in the rural sector drags down the rest of this country.<br />
If farmers have no income, and if they stop spending, it has an<br />
immediate impact in their own communities and an immediate impact<br />
on the major industries that are significant suppliers for the<br />
rural sector. When rural Australia is doing well that has an<br />
impact on industries and on the great cities. It gives us all<br />
119' Qr?) eV OZE </p>
<p>-2<br />
more optimism and faith in the future.<br />
Because of a number of things which have occurred in trade<br />
we have been able to re-establish a much more secure access<br />
to many markets overseas, inflation is under control to a much<br />
greater extent than it was in those earlier times, we have<br />
introduced special policies designed to enable farmers and<br />
pastoralists to rebuild their assets and, to repair their farms<br />
and establish financial reserves once again because of all this,<br />
people are looking to the future with the kind of confidence that<br />
was absent from Australia for so long.<br />
This is the case not only in rural Australia. our manufacturing<br />
industries are doing very much better than they have for many<br />
many years. The volume of manufactured exports was up about<br />
per cent last year, with consequences for employment and for the<br />
well being of the total economy. The mining industry is moving<br />
forward strongly in many states. I would not mind if every<br />
Australian went for a holiday overseas between now and the next<br />
election so long as they were back here by voting day because<br />
if people saw what was happening in the United States, Canada,<br />
the United Kingdom and in a number of countries in Europe and then<br />
returned to this country, they would have a feeling of pride in<br />
what Australia is achieving, and a feeling of confidence in the<br />
prospects for the 1980s.<br />
I do not know any other country that can look to the 1980s with<br />
the kind of confidence that is now coming to be widely shared<br />
throughout Australia. Our inflation rate is much less than many<br />
of our significant trading partners, and I believe we can keep it<br />
that way. In the United. States and the United Kingdom there have<br />
been very severe and great economic difficulties, and there<br />
the growth of trade and the growth of output is minimal.<br />
The United Kingdom's economy will probably shrink over this year<br />
and perhaps over the next year. </p>
<p>-3-<br />
Against that kind of background overseas, the performance in<br />
Australia is, in comparative returns, even better than we might<br />
otherwise believe it to be. In a world where there has been<br />
high inflation and where there have been energy shortages and<br />
rising prices for oil, Ithe world economy has not been growing<br />
all that much, while Australia is moving ahead<br />
quite strongly. That is because we have been able to bring<br />
together some basic natural assets; the strength of our own<br />
industries, a better run economy as we believe, great mining<br />
resources and abundant reserves of a number of different forms of<br />
energy. By these means we have been able to attract more<br />
investment and hence more activity to this country, providing the<br />
basis for a confidence that people in Australia have but which is<br />
not fully shared in a number of other countries at the present<br />
time.<br />
over the next few nonths, there are two points about the Labor Party that we need<br />
to have understood right throughout the Australian community. The first<br />
is the extent of their move to the left over the last years, and<br />
it is very significant indeed. You will remember in the past how<br />
Mr. Whitlam took on the Victorian Socialist Left, how he was<br />
reported to have vanquished the Socialist Left well the Socialist<br />
Left in Victoria is not only well and prospering but it is moving<br />
pretty vigorously out into other States, in the selection of<br />
candidates and the dominance that they have in the Party and the<br />
kind of policies that are being pursued. When Mr. Hawke accused<br />
Mr. Hayden of a ' gutless sell-out to the Left' at the Adelaide<br />
Conference-of the Labor Party last year, Mr. Hartley then revealed<br />
what-had happened. Mr. Hayden had accepted the economic advice<br />
of the AN1WSU instead of Mr. Hawke's advice. We know that that<br />
particular union is far to the Left in the political spectrum.<br />
It was quite plain that they had come to dominate Mr. Hayden's<br />
economic thinking in the kind of policies that he wanted to pursue.<br />
There was a momentary breach in that alliance a couple of weeks<br />
ago when Mr. Hayden believed that he ought to -act responsibly.<br />
I commended him for attacking the campaign for a 35 hour week.<br />
But he was immediately repudiated by his own Caucus. I understand<br />
Mr. Hawke has been saying that Mr. Hayden will have to change his<br />
views. In fact in the Parliament they voted for a different kind </p>
<p>-4-<br />
of approach and all in all I expect that that will be the last<br />
burst of responsibility we will see from Mr. Hayden for a while.<br />
The movement to the Left, the intervention in Queensland, the<br />
nature of the candidates selected in Victoria, the lack of a<br />
realistic economic policy, must be matters for concern, and<br />
matters that will concern the electors of Australia later this<br />
year.<br />
We remember that the expenditure of previous Labor years resulted<br />
in a very high inflation. Well so far, in just four areas of<br />
expenditure; in employment, in health, in housing and in welfare<br />
the ALP have committed themselves to an additional $ 1,800<br />
million of expenditure each year. Ndw that is four ministries<br />
out of about 26 or 27.<br />
When other pbtential ministers make their demands for additional<br />
expenditure, how much extra money would they then be spending, if they<br />
ever had an opportunity again. Throwing money at problems is<br />
still very much part of their makeup. It shows that they have<br />
learned nothing from previous occasions.<br />
So the two things that I believe that we need to have understood<br />
are the movement to the Left and their essential irresponsibility<br />
in the management of the financial affairs of this country. I<br />
believe on those two grounds the people of Australia would reject<br />
the Australian Labor Party.<br />
If there were any ' doubt about it, they have said one or two things<br />
about taxation. In December last year Mr. Hayden reminded us<br />
that his revenue raising programmes were somewhat more radical<br />
than had been outlined up to 1972 by Mr. Whitlam. . He said<br />
that he had committed his organisation to a capital gains tax,<br />
a resource rental tax, a levy on domestic oil producers which<br />
Mr. Keating has said would collect more than our levy a number<br />
of initiatives in the tax area and other measures of that nature.<br />
He left it to his spokesman on economic affairs to define other<br />
measures. Mr. Willis said it was wrong that we did not have some<br />
form of tax on capital, be it death duties, a capital gains tax,<br />
. I . I 177-T </p>
<p>5<br />
a wealth tax or perhaps some kind of combination of those, or<br />
all three. Let nobody say they have n ot been warned, because<br />
in those policy statements we have been told very plainly what<br />
the tax future would be under any future Labor Government.<br />
But we do not rely on the negatives. It is the positive things<br />
that this Government has done what we can achieve for Australia<br />
in the years ahead that are important. When we look at events<br />
overseas, we will find that it is even more important that the<br />
Coalition stays very firmly and strongly in power in charge of<br />
Australia's affairs.<br />
The world is going through a difficult time. You will remember<br />
how after all the difficulties of the Cold War and the involvement<br />
in Korea, the Berlin Wall, the Cuban missile crisis, the third<br />
rape of Czechoslovakia in thirty years in 1968, people began to<br />
think and hope that surely there was a better way. The concept of<br />
detente, the idea of lessening of tensions between the super<br />
powers was born. As a result of that it was determined that East<br />
and West would live together in a friendly and a happier atmosphere.<br />
And the Western world, Europe and the United States if they did not<br />
believe-it, at least they pretended that they believed it. The<br />
United States started to reduce her defence expenditures. Europe<br />
became less wary. Everyone was less concerned at what was<br />
happening outside of Europe. They ignored some of what the Soviets<br />
were then doing. They ignored the fact that Mr. Brezhnev said<br />
after the concept of detente was born: ' that it doesn't in the<br />
slightest abolish, nor can it abolish or alter the laws of the<br />
class. struggle.: He made it perfectly plain that by subversion,<br />
by the provision of arms, and as we have seen more recently, by<br />
the outright use of their own military forces in Afghanistan, they are<br />
determined if they can to extend their sway and their dominance<br />
over more peoples in this world.<br />
Since detente was born there have been problems in Angola, Ethiopia,<br />
the Yemen and Vietnam, where, either directly or indirectly the<br />
Soviets . have propagated war and conflict, discord and difficulty.<br />
And of course most recently of all Afghanistan. There is one<br />
healthy thing one only that has come out of Afghanistan, and </p>
<p>-6-<br />
that is that the Soviets are being seen for what they are, much<br />
more plainly than for many many years. In many cases the blinkers<br />
have come off and people understand the nature of the Soviet Union<br />
and the nature of the Soviet threat more clearly than might have<br />
been the case for 10 or even for 20 years. If that is so and<br />
if as a result people are going to pursue more realistic policies,<br />
well then that at least is healthy. We are going to be in for a<br />
long period where the United States and the major countries of<br />
Europe are going to have to show a strength and a determination,<br />
going to have to rebuild their own defences and capacities, not<br />
just for this year or for next, but over quite a long period.<br />
Because I have not the slightest doubt that there is only one<br />
thing which the Soviet Union respects and that is strength and<br />
determination in preventing their dominance over more and more<br />
countries spreading.<br />
As a result of the invasion of Afghanistan they have already<br />
achieved very significant strategic advantages. They have the<br />
capacity now to use airfields in Afghanistan, extending their<br />
tactical air power over much larger areas of the Middle East and<br />
of the oil producing states strategic air power over again a<br />
much larger area than was possible before. There are other<br />
advantages for them as well for example, being able to move more<br />
easily against Pakistan if they wish,-or to take advantage of<br />
difficulties in Iran. These are very real dangers, and it will<br />
be only the determination of the United States and the determination<br />
of other countries in Europe that will prevent those dangers from<br />
becoming more.. real.<br />
Against that backg round of all of our history and with all of<br />
our involvement in the past in support of allies and in the<br />
defence of the kind of freedom and liberty which is vital to our<br />
way of life, it is all the more important that we stand with our<br />
friends, with our allies, with the United States, with the<br />
United Kingdom, with France and with Germany, because they are the<br />
main determinants of what can happen; because they are the countries<br />
which in reality have the power. </p>
<p>-7-<br />
That is one of the significant reasons why this Government has<br />
pursued over recent months the kind of policies it has pursued<br />
in response to that invasion of Afghanistan, in support of the<br />
United States and of major countries in Europe. It is a tragedy<br />
for Australia that all Mr. Hayden can do, in his desire to<br />
criticise this Government, is to irrply that everything that President<br />
Carter is doing, is done for domestic political reasons, almost<br />
as though he had engineered the Soviets into Afghanistan for.<br />
domestic political reasons in the United States. The proposition<br />
of course, is one of total absurdity.<br />
Australia could have expected more " of the Australian Labor Party<br />
in matters as important, in matters as vital to the future and<br />
security of this country. The fact that they have not behaved in<br />
a responsible way in relation to these issues will mean they will<br />
be judged more harshly when the time comes.<br />
There is one other thing that I would like to say. I have said it<br />
before, and it remains very true. As Prime minister you need<br />
people who support you, people whom you can consult, very often on<br />
the most sensitive and delicate matters which never touch the<br />
light of day. You need people who can carry at times some of the<br />
burden and some of the difficulty. I have said it before and I<br />
say it again: nobody could have a better lieutenant than Doug Anthony,<br />
as Deputy Prime Minister, than I have. Over a long period he has<br />
helped to lighten the load with the benefit of his own experience<br />
and judgment in many matters, he has certainly contributed<br />
enormously. to: the strength and to the unity of the Coalition. And<br />
Doug.. is also supported by people like Peter Nixon and Ralph Hunt<br />
who are respected right throughout all political parties, by all<br />
Liberals, as well as by their own. 000---</p>
