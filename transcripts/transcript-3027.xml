REPORT OF AUSTRALIAN DELEGATION TO SOUTH<br />
PACIFIC CONFERENCE<br />
Attached is a copy of a statement tabled in the<br />
Senate on 26 September 1973 by the Minister Assisting the<br />
Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator Willesee, who was<br />
Leader of the Australian Delegation to the 13th South<br />
Pacific Conference at Guam, 11-20 September 1973. </p>
<p>As leader of the Australian delegation, I attended the<br />
first four days of the 13th South Pacific Conference which was held<br />
at Guam from 11 to 20 September 1973. The delegation included two<br />
Members of Parliament, Mr A. S. Luchetti and Mr P. E. Lucock, who<br />
were nominated at the Prime Minister's request by the Parliamentary<br />
Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence.<br />
Twenty nine years ago the Labour Governments of Australia<br />
and New Zealand signed the Australian-New Zealand Agreement ( more<br />
popularly known as the ANZAC Pact), which included articles proposing<br />
the establishment of a regional organisation known as the South Seas<br />
Regional Commission, This was the genesis of the South Pacific<br />
Commission ( SPC) which was born of the Canberra Agreement of<br />
February 1947. Since that time the South Pacific has been washed by the<br />
tides of change. In 1947 no island entity in this region was a<br />
state. None could be a signatory to the Canberra Agreement. Today,<br />
three are fully independent Nauru, Fiji and Western Samoa and<br />
have taken their place as members of the South Pacific Commission.<br />
Tonga re-entered the comity of nations in 1970. Papua New Guinea<br />
is now on the threshhold of full nationhood.<br />
The 1947 Canberra Agreement was a paternalistic document,<br />
based on a separation of the controlling metropolitan powers and<br />
their subject colonies. While the Agreement played a significant<br />
and valuable part in the economic, social and political development<br />
of the region, it has become increasingly out of step with the times.<br />
It is anachronistic that we have a South Pacific Commission,<br />
comprising the metropolitan powers, plus in recent years the<br />
independent Island states of the region, sitting in judgment over<br />
recommendations of the South Pacific Conference, at which only<br />
the Pacific Island states and territories have a vote.<br />
Against this background and having in mind the Government's </p>
<p>-2-<br />
policy that Australia should seek to play a co-operative and helpful<br />
but not a dominating role in the South Pacific, our delegation<br />
went to the South Pacific Conference at Guam this year with three<br />
positive ideas. Two were proposals and one a suggestion.<br />
The first proposal was that from 1975 the South Pacific<br />
Commission should be financed on a part voluntary basis. The<br />
second proposal was that there should be a de facto merger of the<br />
Commission and the Conference sessions. The suggestion was that<br />
the Conference should be remodelled so that it could be shortened<br />
in length and its focus placed on the development process in the<br />
entire region. Australia and New Zealand had launched the voluntary.<br />
contribution principle by announcing at the South Pacific Forum<br />
held at Apia in April this year voluntary contributions of<br />
$ NZ250,00O each towards the 1974 SPC Work Program. France made a<br />
voluntary contribution of 5A50,000 at Guam.<br />
A preliminary Session of the Commission, which met prior<br />
to the opening of the Conference in Guam, accepted the principle<br />
of part voluntary financing. As a result, the SPC's technical<br />
assistance work, its prime function, should in future be able to<br />
draw on greater financial resources.<br />
Our main proposal for a de facto merger of the Conference<br />
and a Commission sessions de facto because of the difficulties<br />
in amending the Canberra Agreement received the unanimous support<br />
of all the voting members of the Conference. The non-self governing<br />
territories thus voted for equal status with the metropolitan powers.<br />
The Conference then set up a special " future status<br />
committee" of Islanders which iported to the Conference on possible<br />
changes in the constitution and functioning of the South Pacific<br />
Commission. The report included a recommendation that the Australian<br />
Government initiate discussion immediately with all participating<br />
governments at the highest appropriate level to revise the Canberra<br />
Agreement so as to reflect the needs and aspirations of the Pacific<br />
people. </p>
<p>-3-<br />
Consideration is now being given to the holding of a<br />
Conference early next year for this purpose.<br />
This result is even better than we had hoped. Our<br />
ileas went with and strengthened the tide of Island opinion. The<br />
" future status committee" report also incorporated the main elements<br />
of our suggestion for remodelling the Conference. The implementation<br />
of the recommendations will, of course, depend on the results of the<br />
meeting of the Commission governments next year.<br />
However, the Conference debates did not all run smoothly.<br />
Tie French delegation walked out of the meeting on 17 September,<br />
wien the Cook Islands introduced a draft resolution condemning<br />
French nuclear testing in the Pacific. That was unfortunate.<br />
Despite our differences we value French participation in the SPC.<br />
Tie support given by Australia to the resolution on this matter<br />
one not normally dealt with by the SPC must be seen in the light<br />
of France's disregard of the interim order of the International<br />
Court of Justice and on the detection over a widespread area of<br />
Australia of radioactive fallout from the French tests.<br />
The Cook Islands resolution, amended by Fiji, was sent by<br />
the Chairman of the Conference to the Secretary-General of the United<br />
O Nations with the request that the views of the Conference be made<br />
known to the United Nations General Assembly and the Security Council.<br />
The resolution was adopted 10 votes to 5. Those opposing were<br />
American Samo'a, the British Solomon Islands Protectorate, New<br />
Caledonia, Niue and the New Hebrides. The Wallis and Futuna Islands<br />
were not present and the French Polynesian delegation had returned<br />
home. The voting figures might give the impression that some<br />
delegations did not believe that the nuclear tests were a cause<br />
of concern. This was not so. Every delegation, including that of </p>
<p>New Caledonia, indicated opposition to the tests in one form or<br />
another. The negative votes reflected more the concern of some<br />
island delegations that acceptance of the resolution might provoke<br />
the withdrawal of France from the Organisation.<br />
The South Pacific Commission has clearly reached a turning<br />
point. The 13th South Pacific Conference marked an important<br />
milestone in the political development of the South Pacific.<br />
Australia went to the Conference this year seeking changes, not<br />
kudos, and we achieved that result.<br />
If the recommendations of the " future status committee"<br />
of the Conference are adopted, the South Pacific Commission should<br />
remain a useful regional organisation for many years to come. </p>
