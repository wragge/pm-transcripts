    <content><![CDATA[<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong></p>
<p>We said farewell to HMAS Darwin in December and now the Darwin has returned. The joy among all the families here is, just listen - it is a great day, a great happy day and they have done great work keeping Australia secure and working with our allies in the battle against terrorism, against smuggling, against all of the criminal activities that support our enemies in the Middle East and around the world.</p>
<p>This is a happy day but it is a reminder too that our safety depends on the courage and the commitment and the professionalism of thousands of Australians to the ADF, our armed forces, in our security agencies and our police.</p>
<p>These are dangerous times in the world today. We have been reminded of that over the last three days. The murders, terrorist attack in Nice is a reminder that there is vulnerability everywhere - that we need to be ever vigilant. The battle against terrorism is one that is entirely global. Events that occur in Jakarta, the Middle East and Europe can affect us in Australia as well. Everything is connected in the 21st-century. That is why our cooperation and collaboration with our allies is more important than ever.</p>
<p>The work the Darwin ship company has done has been of critical importance. There is also a time to recall the massive investment that my Government is making in Australia's Navy. Our naval shipbuilding program is the largest in our peacetime history. It is a renaissance of the Navy, a rebuilding of the Navy – built in Australia, Australian industry, Australian technology. It is a critical investment for our future.</p>
<p>Australia's safety is the most important responsibility of my Government and indeed any government at any time. We are very fortunate to have such commitment, such skill, such courage as we have from the men and women of the Darwin and all of our defence forces, our security agencies across the world.</p>
<p>Thousands of Australians, 24 hours a day, are keeping us safe. They are the best in the world and they are relentless - as is my Government - in ensuring that we remain secure.</p>
<p><strong>CHIEF OF NAVY:</strong></p>
<p>Thank you, Prime Minister. I would like to personally thank the ship's company of over 200 people for the job they have done over the last six months. We asked them to do a certain task, to protect maritime security in a certain area of the world, and they have exceeded our wishes – they have done everything we have asked them to do plus more. It is a close-knit crew, as you can see from the large number of supporters and family here today to welcome them back. It is a delight to see the troops ashore back here that have been holding the home fort have come out in large numbers to see them. Darwin is a great ship's company and has done a great deal of work, and we are pleased to see her back today.</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong></p>
<p>Thank you. Do you have any questions?</p>
<p><strong>JOURNALIST:</strong></p>
<p>Prime Minister, can we please get an update on Turkey? What communication has the Government had with the Government over there?</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong></p>
<p>Yes, within a few hours of the coup attempt beginning, I was in direct contact with our ambassador in Ankara, James Larsen and both the Foreign Minister and I have been in constant contact with him and other Australian officials in Turkey. Also, through our diplomats, we are in direct contact with the Turkish Government.</p>
<p>At this stage it appears that the coup has failed. I think that is clear. There will be more news and developments no doubt over the next days and weeks. But as I said yesterday, Australia supports the democratically elected government of Turkey and its democratic institutions. We call on all parties to respect them and we call on all parties to show calm and restraint in this difficult period in Turkey.</p>
<p><strong>JOURNALIST:</strong></p>
<p>With regard to domestic issues, are you prepared to maybe do some tweaking or some compromise with regard to your super policy?</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong></p>
<p>As you know, the super changes have introduced greater fairness in the superannuation tax system, and it has made it more fit for purpose, and also has given great flexibility. It has given considerable benefits to people on lower incomes, to older Australians and self-employed Australians and to people who have been out of the workforce and come into it and want to catch up on concessional contributions - in most cases that applies to women.</p>
<p>The reforms are important but obviously in the implementation and transition there is work to be done - there always is with tax changes and they will go through the normal Cabinet and party room process. We are listening very keenly, I am listening very keenly and carefully to concerns that have been raised by my colleagues, and of course by other people in the community as well. There is a process being undertaken, but it is important to recognise that is always the case. They already have been some technical details that have been addressed by the Treasurer and no doubt there will be others.</p>
<p><strong>JOURNALIST:</strong></p>
<p>Does that include the $500,000 back down on superannuation exemptions?</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong></p>
<p>The one thing I am not going to do is undertake policy on the run or via a press conference.</p>
<p>With changes like this, big reforms like this we have made to superannuation - they have gone through a careful process, they have gone through a careful expenditure review committee process and so forth and when the legislation is finalised that again will go through the same careful process again. These are very complex areas and it is important to get them right.</p>
<p><strong>JOURNALIST:</strong></p>
<p>The UK Prime Minister says she has spoken to you about brokering a free trade deal.</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong></p>
<p>Sorry?</p>
<p><strong>JOURNALIST:</strong></p>
<p>Britain’s new Prime Minister said she has spoken to you about brokering a free trade deal as soon as possible. Is there an opportunity here for Australia?</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong></p>
<p>Yes, thank you. I spoke yesterday with Theresa May, the new Prime Minister of Britain and congratulated her on her appointment as Prime Minister. We did discuss a free trade agreement. Clearly our free trade arrangements with the United Kingdom of course are with the European community. So as Britain leaves the EU, what we will need to do as we negotiate direct arrangements with Britain. I have had a very constructive discussion with Prime Minister May about that and we look forward to discussions between my Trade Minister Steven Ciobo and his counterpart, Liam Fox, shortly. We need to get moving on that quickly. Britain will not be out of the EU for several years, of course, that is the expectation in any event, but we need to get working on the new trade arrangements between Britain and Australia, as indeed Britain will have to undertake that work with many other countries as well including the rest of the European community.</p>
<p><strong>JOURNALIST:</strong></p>
<p>Do you think Britain needs Australia more now than ever?</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong></p>
<p>Australia has been a great beneficiary of free trade and open markets and so has the United Kingdom.</p>
<p><strong>JOURNALIST:</strong></p>
<p>Can you confirm if you did donate $1 million to the Liberal Party campaign?</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong></p>
<p>Thank you. It is kind of you to ask. There is a very precise disclosure regime, as you know, for political donations and donations to the Liberal Party and indeed other parties. They are always disclosed in accordance with the Electoral Act, with the Federal election legislation.</p>
<p><strong>JOURNALIST:</strong></p>
<p>If you do have to disclose it - can you tell us if you did donate?</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong></p>
<p>All will be disclosed in accordance with the law. It is very important that we do that precisely and accurately, and in accordance with the Act. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>JOURNALIST:</strong></p>
<p>When will the new ministry be announced and who will be in the new ministry?</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong></p>
<p>Alright – Okay. Well, I am not about to announce the new ministry today but such changes as there are to the ministry will be announced tomorrow afternoon.</p>
<p><strong>JOURNALIST:</strong></p>
<p>Do you expect there to be a little bit of anger or any tension during tomorrow’s meeting?</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong></p>
<p>We always have very constructive meetings in the Liberal Party and indeed when we meet as a Coalition.</p>
<p><strong>JOURNALIST:</strong></p>
<p>Will Tony Abbott be in that ministry?</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong></p>
<p>Can I just refer you to the remarks I made earlier about that. Thank you very much.</p>
<p>I know it is starting to rain. We have held the rain off but this will not dampen the joyful spirit of the ship's company of HMAS Darwin and their families. Their support to the men and women of the Darwin has enabled them to serve Australia so well. We thank them and we honour them and we are delighted that the ship's company are reunited with their families today.</p>
<p>Thank you very much.</p>
