EM. ARCO : 7 P. M. SUNDAY<br />
QUEETSLAND BROADCAST NO.<br />
PETROLEUM AND MINERALS AUTHORITY<br />
SUNDAY 29 JUE 1975<br />
One of the prcaises on which my Government was elected was our<br />
undertaking to stop the overseas takeover of Australia's mineral and energy<br />
resources. That process had been going on unchecked under successive Liberal-<br />
Country Party Govern-rents. hben Labor came in, we had reached the stage where<br />
62 per cent of Australia's energy resources that is, cur coal, oil, gas and<br />
uranium were in foreign hands. We weren't prepared to tolerate that situation.<br />
Australians weren't prepared to tolerate it. In 1972 and 1974 the people gave<br />
us a clear mandate to halt the drift. I doubt if there is any aspect of Labor<br />
policy which is better understood or irore widely accepted both here and overseas<br />
than this comnitmrent to maximum Australian ownership of our resources.<br />
As with everything else we undertook to do, we inmediately began to<br />
implement our promises. We introduced a Bill to establish the Petroleum and Minerals<br />
Authority the P. M. A. as the chief instrument for asserting Australian ownership<br />
and control. We introduced the Bill in our first year in office. The Senate<br />
stalled it. We introduced the legislation again. The Senate rejected it. It<br />
therefore became one of six Bills on which the double dissolution was granted in<br />
April last year. It was one of the specific grounds for the general election in<br />
May last year. The legislation was endorsed by the Australian people. They gave<br />
us the go-ahead to bring it in again. We did so at the Joint Sitting of<br />
Parliament last August. The Bill was passed at the Joint Sitting. No single<br />
piece of legislaticn with the exception of our health Bills has received a<br />
clearer and firmer mandate from the people or been more thoroughly debated in<br />
the Parliament. Yet as soon as the Bill was passed, the four Anti-Labor States imnediately<br />
challenged it in the High Court.<br />
I give this brief history of the Bill because there has been a certain<br />
amount of Jubilation among Liberal and Country Party politicians this week over<br />
the Court's decision declaring the Bill invalid. Mr Fraser and Mr Bjelke-Petersen,<br />
in particular, have sought to give the impression that the court found our whole<br />
proposal in some way sinister and illegal. Now I don't want to argue the rights<br />
and wrongs of the Court's decision. Presumably because the judges have not yet<br />
published their reasons a majority of the Court found that through a technicality<br />
this particular Bill should not have been the basis of the double dissolution. But<br />
I want you to be quite clear that no judge has questioned the Government's right<br />
to legislate for the P. M. A. That is not in dispute. I emphasise that the Court's<br />
decision didn't say or infer that the Parliament is not entitled to pass such a Bill.<br />
So, we shall put it to the Parliament again. In the meantime we shall continue to<br />
develop Australia's natural resources with the fullest Australian participation,<br />
ownership and control. </p>
<p>It is incredible, it is monstrous, that the Leader of the Opposition<br />
is again threatening to block this legislation in the Senate. It is not so<br />
long since he was telling us that under his leadership the Opposition wouldn't<br />
hold up the Governrant's program; that the Government would be allowed to govern.<br />
So much for that promise. Here we have one more example of Opposition obstruction<br />
obstruction that can only encourage those people who want a sell-out of Australia's<br />
assets, obstruction on a Bill that has received repeated and specific endorsement<br />
by the Australian voters.<br />
We have gone much too far with the P. M. A. to allow it to be frustrated<br />
at this late stage by the States or anyone else. My colleague, Rex Connor,<br />
has already announced the forr-ation of a Company in the Australian Capital Territory.<br />
A major part of the $ 50 million provided for the Authority this financial year has<br />
been cotiitted to assisting Australian mining ventures, including one in Queensland<br />
The Mareeba Copper Mining Operation near Cairns. The Authority has also taken<br />
an equity in coal mining in New South 1, ales and Natural Gas in South Aus. bralia,<br />
thus helping to safeguard Australian ownership of these resources.<br />
The other great task we have set for the Authority is mineral exploration<br />
especially petroleum exploration. What was the Liberal contribution to the search<br />
for minerals? It was to offer subsidies and tax concessions to private companies<br />
and trust them to do the job. All that happened under the Liberals was that income<br />
tax concessions for mining were exploited and abused to line the pockets of<br />
speculators. Money that should have been going into exploration was diverted into<br />
speculation in shares. One of our first acts as a Government was to close off those<br />
loopholes and insist that the whole business of exploration should be tackled on a<br />
national, businesslike basis through the Authority established for that purpose.<br />
We are certainly not against the participation of overseas companies in the search<br />
for oil and minerals, but we do insist that henceforth Australia will be the<br />
primary partner in such ventures. That should be done it can only be done<br />
through the Petroleum and Minerals Authority.<br />
I'm quite certain that in the judgement of history the Government's<br />
policies on Australian ownership of our minerals and energy will be seen to beright.<br />
In an energy-hungry world we just can't afford to take chances with our<br />
precious resources and trust to luck that foreign campanies will look after us.<br />
That may be good enough for the Liberals but it's not good enough for us. If the<br />
Anti-Labor States imagine that by obstruction in the Parliament, by litigation in<br />
the Courts or by other nark tactics they are going to deflect us from our goals<br />
they had better think again. The Australian people gave us a mandate to act in<br />
these matters. The States will no more succeed in blocking our policies for<br />
Australian ownership than they've succeeded in blocking Medibank. Mr Bjelke-Petersen<br />
learnt that lesson this week; he has learnt it the hard way. Let it be a<br />
lesson to the other anti-Labor States who are tempted to put foreign interests<br />
before Australia's national interests. </p>
