<p>Well, thank you very much, Mr Spence; to Sarah and Paul; to Elizabeth</p>
<p>   Grace, the Federal Member for Lilley; to my State colleague, Santo</p>
<p>   Santoro, principals, ladies and gentlemen. And particularly can</p>
<p>   I address some remarks to the final year students of Clayfield and</p>
<p>   Nudgee. </p>
<p>Our youngest son is doing the equivalent examination within the</p>
<p>   New South Wales system, the Higher School Certificate, and is in</p>
<p>   the midst of his trials so I feel for you, I also feel for your</p>
<p>   parents. And I have some experience of what it is like and I wish</p>
<p>   you well. </p>
<p>And can I particularly thank those who entertained us. And can</p>
<p>   I join Mr Spence in congratulating those Australian families who</p>
<p>   have demonstrated the unwavering tolerance of the Australian community</p>
<p>   towards people of all races and all cultures. It is one of the distinguishing</p>
<p>   characteristics of modern Australia that we have been so receptive</p>
<p>   to people from all around the world and nothing angers me more when</p>
<p>   I hear people selling short the willingness of Australians to be</p>
<p>   tolerant and to be accepting of different races and different cultures.</p>
<p>   We are amongst the most tolerant, open people in the world and we've</p>
<p>   had a marvellous demonstration this afternoon of that in practice.</p>
<p>And I would also like to particularly commend Mr Young and Drug-Arm</p>
<p>   for its involvement in putting together this afternoon's gathering.</p>
<p>   Because a few months ago I had the opportunity to launch, in one</p>
<p>   of Brisbane's best known churches, the second installment of</p>
<p>   our Tough on Drugs' campaign under the auspices of Drug-Arm.</p>
<p>   And on that occasion the forum was marvellous and the event brilliantly</p>
<p>   organised and this afternoon is no exception. </p>
<p>But this afternoon I'm here to say a few words in general</p>
<p>   about the tax plan that I launched on behalf of the Government last</p>
<p>   Thursday with particular reference to its impact on Australian families.</p>
<p>Can I first of all say that the most important thing and the most</p>
<p>   important reason why I hope the Australian public supports what</p>
<p>   the Government is putting forward is not because of the personal</p>
<p>   income tax cuts, not because of the goods and services tax, not</p>
<p>   because of this or that element of the plan, but rather that the</p>
<p>   plan as a whole is in the long-term benefit of Australia and of</p>
<p>   Australian families. And the plan is in the long-term benefit of</p>
<p>   Australia because it is going to make the Australian economy more</p>
<p>   productive and more competitive and because of that we are going</p>
<p>   to generate more jobs and sell more goods and services abroad and</p>
<p>   compete more effectively against imports from abroad. </p>
<p>And the reason that that comes about is that the essential reform</p>
<p>   of the taxation system that is involved in the plan, and that is</p>
<p>   the sweeping away of the existing wholesale tax system and no less</p>
<p>   than nine State and Territory taxes that are very inefficient, and</p>
<p>   their replacement with a single rate goods and services tax will</p>
<p>   bring about a major reduction in the production costs which are</p>
<p>   involved in producing goods and services within the Australian economy.</p>
<p>   And if I leave but one or two thoughts with you this afternoon </p>
<p>   and I hope to do better than that  can I leave with you that</p>
<p>   simple thought, that the fundamental reform involved in this plan</p>
<p>   will make the Australian economy work more efficiently because it</p>
<p>   will lower the cost of production of goods and services. And that</p>
<p>   means we will be able to sell more competitively overseas and we'll</p>
<p>   be able to compete more effectively against imports. And that is</p>
<p>   the major reason why we are pressing ahead with this plan. And it's</p>
<p>   the major reason why we have foresworn the soft option of just offering</p>
<p>   a tax cut without offering tax reform because I don't think</p>
<p>   that, in the long run, is going to do any good for the Australian</p>
<p>   economy. You can always find an excuse for a tax cut. You need to</p>
<p>   have a long-term plan about the future of Australia to find the</p>
<p>   argument and the courage for fundamental reform of the system. </p>
<p>And it is only fundamental reform of the system that is going to</p>
<p>   make the Australian economy work more efficiently. And there has</p>
<p>   to be a reason, my friends, as to why for almost every year of the</p>
<p>   24 years that I've been in Parliament, politicians on one or</p>
<p>   other and on occasions on both sides of politics have thought about</p>
<p>   the idea of reforming the tax system. I entered Parliament in 1974</p>
<p>   and the year before I entered Parliament there had been commissions,</p>
<p>   an inquiry into the Australian taxation system and it duly reported</p>
<p>   in 1975, and it was known as the Asprey Report  and some of</p>
<p>   you in the audience may remember that name and that report </p>
<p>   and do you know what it recommended in 1975, 23 years ago, it recommended</p>
<p>   the introduction of the equivalent of a goods and services tax and</p>
<p>   it recommended that the goods and services tax should replace the</p>
<p>   wholesale tax and some other taxes and that its introduction should</p>
<p>   be accompanied by some reductions in personal income tax. And it's</p>
<p>   very interesting that for 23 years the debate has gone on and it's</p>
<p>   never gone away. And the reason it's never gone away is that</p>
<p>   the idea is right. And there's nothing more powerful in the</p>
<p>   world, whether it be politics or any other activity, than the force</p>
<p>   of an idea whose time has not only come but which is absolutely</p>
<p>   right and to the long-term benefit of the Australian community and</p>
<p>   the Australian economy.</p>
<p>So we are first and foremost in favour of this reform because it</p>
<p>   will be to the long-term benefit of the Australian economy. And</p>
<p>   if you hear people saying: well, it mightn't be a bad idea</p>
<p>   to reform the tax system but we really shouldn't do it right</p>
<p>   now because there's a downturn in the Asian Pacific region,</p>
<p>   could I say to those people, it's because there's a downturn</p>
<p>   in the Asian Pacific region that we must go ahead with the reform.</p>
<p>   Because the challenges from the outside world make it more necessary</p>
<p>   that we get our own house in order, that we reform the things that</p>
<p>   need to be reformed.</p>
<p>I am a politician who has a selective view, a deliberately selective</p>
<p>   view about change. I am in favour of change which is beneficial</p>
<p>   to our country's future. I am against change which is not beneficial</p>
<p>   to our country's future. I, for example, am strongly opposed</p>
<p>   to some of the more permissive views about drug taking within the</p>
<p>   Australian community. I favour a zero tolerance approach to drugs.</p>
<p>   I was against the heroin trial, very, very strongly opposed to the</p>
<p>   heroin trial. And that was an example of somebody standing against</p>
<p>   change that he regarded as bad. But by the same token, I am prepared</p>
<p>   to fight vigorously for change that I believe is good and I believe</p>
<p>   that changing our taxation system will make the Australian economy</p>
<p>   more efficient.</p>
<p>Now, we've taken particular care in putting this package together</p>
<p>   to give even greater recognition to the costs involved for Australian</p>
<p>   families in raising children. It is fundamental to this package</p>
<p>   and it is fundamental to my own personal, political philosophy that</p>
<p>   the most valuable and the most cohesive unit within the Australian</p>
<p>   community is the Australian family. It is not only the place from</p>
<p>   which people derive warmth and love and emotional support and companionship</p>
<p>   and guidance and understanding of what life is all about, but it</p>
<p>   is also, put in another context, it is also an undeniable fact that</p>
<p>   stable, united families represent the most efficient welfare system</p>
<p>   that any nation has devised, and that the strain on society and</p>
<p>   the strain on the welfare system of society of disintegrating families</p>
<p>   is immense. And it follows then from that that whatever any government</p>
<p>   can do through the tax and welfare system to help families and to</p>
<p>   relieve some of the financial burden on them and to provide them</p>
<p>   with more choices, then that government ought to do. </p>
<p>Now, I don't pretend that any government can legislate to</p>
<p>   make families cohesive, that belongs to the human nature, the human</p>
<p>   spirit and individual behaviour. But governments can declare their</p>
<p>   support for families and they can devise taxation and welfare systems</p>
<p>   that support families. And I'm very proud of a couple of changes</p>
<p>   that we have made in our tax plan that particularly helps families.</p>
<p>The first of those changes is that we have recognised that one</p>
<p>   of the weaknesses of the present system is that the way the tax</p>
<p>   system and the social welfare system interacts, that there are very</p>
<p>   powerful disincentives for low income families to get off welfare</p>
<p>   and to get back into the workforce. And that many low income families</p>
<p>   in Australia face marginal tax rates with the interaction of the</p>
<p>   withdrawal of family benefits and the payment of taxation, as you</p>
<p>   move into the workforce, withdrawal rates of something like, at</p>
<p>   the margin, 85 per cent. </p>
<p>So what we set out to do, amongst many things in the plan, was</p>
<p>   to remove or, at the very least, ease what are known in the trade</p>
<p>   as poverty traps. And that is situations where you might earn a</p>
<p>   little bit more money but because of the way in which the tax system</p>
<p>   worked and the welfare benefits were withdrawn, you would end up</p>
<p>   very little out of it. And we've got examples at the present</p>
<p>   time where you might earn $100 a week and you end up taking extra</p>
<p>   and you end up taking home only 15 out of that 100. Now, that is</p>
<p>   a ridiculous state of affairs. You're not paying a tax rate</p>
<p>   of 85 per cent but by the time you pay the tax on the extra income</p>
<p>   and you have the special family allowance subsidy withdrawn, that</p>
<p>   is the effective impact. So the first thing we set out to do for</p>
<p>   families was to do something about those poverty traps. And we have</p>
<p>   significantly increased the low income families, the point at which</p>
<p>   special social welfare benefits start to be withdrawn so that the</p>
<p>   marginal tax rates and the withdrawal rates are a lot less.</p>
<p>The second thing we set out to do was to provide Australian families</p>
<p>   with more choice about the caring arrangements of their young children.</p>
<p>   Now obviously attitudes towards family arrangements have changed</p>
<p>   over the years. There will always be debate within the Australian</p>
<p>   community about what are the best caring arrangements for young</p>
<p>   children and the role of Government and my own personal philosophy</p>
<p>   is that that should be a matter of individual choice for parents.</p>
<p>   It is not for the Government to say that every young child should</p>
<p>   be looked after full-time by either the mother or father of that</p>
<p>   child while the other parent is out at work, or alternatively that</p>
<p>   those children should be committed to full-time childcare.</p>
<p>I have my own views and those views are ones that I have practiced</p>
<p>   in relation to my own family and we certainly have no regrets at</p>
<p>   all for a moment about the choices that we made in relation to that.</p>
<p>   But I respect that in a free society it is for individual parents</p>
<p>   to make decisions and I also accept that it's going to vary</p>
<p>   from family to family. And what we have set out to do is to enlarge</p>
<p>   the choices that are available to recognise now that it is more</p>
<p>   often than not the case that women will wish to pursue careers as</p>
<p>   well as raising families.</p>
<p>I often say that the three women who have influenced my life the</p>
<p>   most - my mother, my wife and my daughter were all born in different</p>
<p>   stages of society's attitude towards these things. And that</p>
<p>   I often talk to my wife and daughter about the sort of family arrangements</p>
<p>   that used to exist, exist now and will exist into the future. And</p>
<p>   although they were born those three people who have profoundly influenced</p>
<p>   my life into different ages with profoundly different attitudes,</p>
<p>   there's been a common thread and the common thread is that</p>
<p>   each of them has as befits responsible members of their generation</p>
<p>   were very strongly committed to the bonds of family and the importance</p>
<p>   of family. And what we have sought to do in this package is by the</p>
<p>   changes we have made to improve the choices. Some people are running</p>
<p>   around and saying Howard wants women back in the kitchen, Howard</p>
<p>   has an old-fashioned view. Howard doesn't want women back in</p>
<p>   the kitchen, Howard does not have an old-fashioned view. Howard</p>
<p>   has a very contemporary view and the contemporary view is that we</p>
<p>   should respect individual choice and that just as we should no longer</p>
<p>   stereotype a particular pattern of family arrangement whereby the</p>
<p>   mother's ceased any participation in the workforce when children</p>
<p>   were born, equally we should not embrace this ideal that in some</p>
<p>   way it's an inferior role for a mother or father to be a full-time</p>
<p>   homemaker whilst children are young. And unfortunately the attitude</p>
<p>   of some in the community represents the swing of the pendulum from</p>
<p>   one side of the argument profoundly to the other which is quite</p>
<p>   unacceptable.</p>
<p>And what we have done is by the new taxation scales and the doubling</p>
<p>   of the tax-free threshold for single income families we have built</p>
<p>   a lot more choice within the taxation system. Under the plan I announced</p>
<p>   last Thursday it will, for example, be the case that a single income</p>
<p>   family with at least one child under five will have an effective</p>
<p>   tax-free zone of $13,000. And the new tax-free zone for a single</p>
<p>   taxpayer will be $6,000. So effectively that single income family</p>
<p>   with at least one child under five will have more than double the</p>
<p>   tax-free threshold of two single taxpayers in a similar situation.</p>
<p>   Now this doesn't represent turning back the clock, it hasn't</p>
<p>   been done at the expense of double income families. It is simply</p>
<p>   a small additional contribution towards evening up the financial</p>
<p>   position of families who may make different choices in relation</p>
<p>   to the caring arrangements for their children.</p>
<p>Let us take the case of two families, one which decides with say</p>
<p>   the husband having an income of $30,000 a year, the wife having</p>
<p>   an income of $20,000 a year that when the first child is born the</p>
<p>   wife decides to drop out of the workforce for a period of a year</p>
<p>   or two while that child is young and that family's income drops</p>
<p>   very dramatically from $50,000 to $30,000. Whereas the family next</p>
<p>   door with the same arrangement they decide to adopt a different</p>
<p>   approach with after a very short period of time the wife returning</p>
<p>   to work, the mother returning to work and the child being put into</p>
<p>   full-time childcare. Now if you look at the benefits that that family</p>
<p>   gets in relation to its childcare expenses and the aggregate of</p>
<p>   its two incomes with two tax-free thresholds then to suggest that</p>
<p>   the modest additional support that we are going to give to the first</p>
<p>   family by virtue of lightening its tax burden a little bit by giving</p>
<p>   it two and a bit tax-free thresholds, to suggest that the second</p>
<p>   family is disadvantaged to the profound benefit of the first family</p>
<p>   is to simply ignore the figures and to ignore the facts. And the</p>
<p>   figures and facts that I use and are very typical of literally hundreds</p>
<p>   of thousands of Australian families because the great bulk of Australian</p>
<p>   wage and salary earners earn less than $50,000 a year.</p>
<p>We have calculated that something like 60 to 70 per cent of wage</p>
<p>   and salary earners earn between $20,000 and $50,000 a year and we</p>
<p>   have calculated that if you look at all taxpayers something like</p>
<p>   81 per cent of them are less than $50,000 a year. So what we have</p>
<p>   tried to do is to fashion a series of tax changes and benefits which</p>
<p>   are designed to the maximum extent that we can and we don't</p>
<p>   pretend for a moment that in these changes we have made we will</p>
<p>   have given total choice to every family in the Australian community.</p>
<p>   We haven't been able to afford to do that. But we have tried,</p>
<p>   since we were elected to office, to alter the tax system to give</p>
<p>   a little bit more justice and a little bit more choice for those</p>
<p>   people who might decide that for them the desirable arrangement</p>
<p>   in relation to their children is that for a period of time either</p>
<p>   the mother or father is out of the full-time workforce. And then</p>
<p>   as the child or children grows a little older the one that is out</p>
<p>   of the workforce will re-enter on a part-time basis and then perhaps</p>
<p>   a number of years into the future when all of them are at secondary</p>
<p>   school she might return, or he, to the full-time workforce.</p>
<p>Now we are in the business of maximising that choice. We are not</p>
<p>   in the business of saying: you should do this or you should do that.</p>
<p>   And we are also not going to be intimidated against making these</p>
<p>   changes by the noise of some who see but the tiniest acknowledgement</p>
<p>   of the rights and the interests of single income families as some</p>
<p>   kind of attempt to turn back a 30 year social revolution. It is</p>
<p>   nothing of the kind. It is merely a recognition of the justice that</p>
<p>   should be within our taxation system and a recognition that if governments</p>
<p>   believe in the importance of family and they believe in the rights</p>
<p>   of parents, not only to choose the education they want for their</p>
<p>   children but also the caring arrangements that should exist in relation</p>
<p>   to their children, then we should be prepared to legislate through</p>
<p>   the tax system to provide that choice. Because before my Government</p>
<p>   came to office there was no special recognition or not much special</p>
<p>   recognition of the position of the single income family and the</p>
<p>   disabilities under which they operated. And through the introduction</p>
<p>   of the family tax initiative, we have recognised the, in an additional</p>
<p>   way, the cost for all families double or single income of the cost</p>
<p>   of raising children and through now the introduction effectively</p>
<p>   of one additional tax-free threshold we have gone some distance</p>
<p>   further in trying to redress the imbalance within the tax system</p>
<p>   against single income families. Now these sorts of issues always</p>
<p>   generate a fair amount of heat and often not a great deal of light</p>
<p>   because some of the people who write about them and some of the</p>
<p>   people who speak about them have their own political and social</p>
<p>   agendas to run. </p>
<p>Can I say we are not in the business as a Government, nor am I</p>
<p>   in the business as the Prime Minister, of engaging in social engineering.</p>
<p>   What I am interested in doing is, first and foremost, expanding</p>
<p>   choices for Australian families and for Australian parents. All</p>
<p>   my political life I have supported choice in the education sector.</p>
<p>   I am a proud product of the State Government education system in</p>
<p>   New South Wales and I am very proud of the quality education that</p>
<p>   I received in that system. And I was not reluctant to send my own</p>
<p>   children to government schools at a primary level but to independent</p>
<p>   schools at a secondary level. But I have fought all of my political</p>
<p>   life for effective freedom of choice in education and I thought</p>
<p>   one of the great things that was done by my Liberal predecessor,</p>
<p>   Sir Robert Menzies, in the 1960s was to sweep away 100 years of</p>
<p>   prejudice and bigotry and to introduce government assistance to</p>
<p>   independent schools. And it remains one of the great legacies of</p>
<p>   Menzies to politics within Australia and one of the great contributions</p>
<p>   that that man made to greater tolerance and equality within the</p>
<p>   Australian community. </p>
<p>And I am also very pleased that one of the first things that my</p>
<p>   new Government did in the education area was to abolish the former</p>
<p>   Government's new schools policy. And what that has meant is</p>
<p>   that there can now be more low fee paying independent schools and</p>
<p>   that the non-Catholic sector can establish a systemic arrangement</p>
<p>   for their schools in the same way that the diocesan Catholic system</p>
<p>   has been able to have in this country for a long period of time.</p>
<p>   Once again, it was a question of expanding choice within the Australian</p>
<p>   education system. Once again, a situation of saying to parents on</p>
<p>   modest incomes who wanted the opportunity to send their children</p>
<p>   to an independent school but couldn't afford to send them to</p>
<p>   a higher fee paying independent school, having the opportunity of</p>
<p>   doing so. But I couldn't for the life of me understand why</p>
<p>   the previous arrangements had discriminated against that. </p>
<p>But ladies and gentlemen, I have digressed a little bit away from</p>
<p>   taxation in saying what I have just said about education. But can</p>
<p>   I say in relation to the tax plan that it is not just about personal</p>
<p>   income tax changes although they are very extensive. I might remind</p>
<p>   you in case you hear those who say that we're not taxing the</p>
<p>   rich but we are taxing the poor, nothing could be more wrong. The</p>
<p>   top marginal rate of tax remains at 47 per cent, although it doesn't</p>
<p>   cut in until $75,000. We have introduced some anti-tax avoidance</p>
<p>   arrangements which will mean that the abuse as distinct from the</p>
<p>   legitimate use of trusts will no longer take place in the future.</p>
<p>   We have cut the bottom rate of tax from 20 per cent to 17 and we</p>
<p>   have increased the tax-free threshold from $5,400 to $6,000 and</p>
<p>   we have made the changes to the poverty traps that I have mentioned</p>
<p>   and we have introduced a number of special provisions in relation</p>
<p>   to pensioners and to self-funded retirees. And, very importantly,</p>
<p>   we have introduced a non-means tested 30 per cent tax rebate in</p>
<p>   relation to the cost of private health insurance. And that means,</p>
<p>   for example, if you have a $2,000 private health insurance policy</p>
<p>   you will be able to get $600 of that back from the taxman or you</p>
<p>   will be able to claim a direct refund from a government office on</p>
<p>   production of the receipt for the payment of the premium. </p>
<p>Now those sorts of benefits are important to all families irrespective</p>
<p>   of their arrangements. But the benefits of the plan for the broader</p>
<p>   economy, of course, go beyond the family arrangements. The greatest</p>
<p>   benefit for business, as I said earlier, of this new plan is that</p>
<p>   their production costs will be lower. What is not understood by</p>
<p>   many in the community is that about half of the Wholesale Sales</p>
<p>   Tax that's collected at the moment comes from business. People</p>
<p>   who think they have wholesale tax exemptions for running their manufacturing</p>
<p>   businesses forget that the Wholesales Sales Tax applies to such</p>
<p>   things as the purchase of computers. People don't yet understand</p>
<p>   fully but they will over the weeks ahead that one of the huge benefits</p>
<p>   of the new plan is that every litre of petrol bought by a man or</p>
<p>   woman running a business in Australia will be seven cents cheaper</p>
<p>   under the GST plan, under the tax plan, than it is at present. And</p>
<p>   the reason for that is that we are reducing the excise on petrol</p>
<p>   down to the level necessary to accommodate the GST at 10 per cent</p>
<p>   without the price of the petrol at the pump going up. But because</p>
<p>   the 10 per cent is fully rebateable as a tax on a business input</p>
<p>   the cost of that petrol, litre of petrol purchased by the businessman</p>
<p>   falls by seven cents. </p>
<p>Now, that is, in addition, my friends, to the huge benefit that</p>
<p>   will be derived largely by, but not only, by the bush, by country</p>
<p>   Australia as a result of the new arrangements concerning diesel.</p>
<p>   Everybody knows how big Australia is. Geoffrey Blainey's evocative</p>
<p>   phrase about the tyranny of distance may have been originally coined</p>
<p>   to describe the distance between Australia and Europe but it was</p>
<p>   quickly seen also as an apt description of the vast distances that</p>
<p>   Australians must travel. And nowhere more so is that relevant than</p>
<p>   here in the State of Queensland. Queensland is not only a big State</p>
<p>   but it is the most decentralised State in Australia. The majority</p>
<p>   of people don't live in Brisbane, whereas the majority of people</p>
<p>   in New South Wales live in Sydney and the majority of Victorians</p>
<p>   live in Melbourne. And that means that goods are transported more</p>
<p>   frequently over longer distances in Queensland than in any other</p>
<p>   State of Australia. That is why [inaudible] arrangement in relation</p>
<p>   to diesel fuel that cuts the excise from 43 cents a litre to 18,</p>
<p>   why that is such an enormous boom and why the maintenance of the</p>
<p>   full rebate of that 43 cents a litre excise in relation to off-road</p>
<p>   use for farmers and the like is of tremendous benefit. And what</p>
<p>   we are doing by that one single act...by those two acts rather,</p>
<p>   is to reduce fuel costs in Australia by $3.5 billion a year. And</p>
<p>   the only two other figures that I will give you is that the total</p>
<p>   effect of the plan will be to reduce the costs of expo</p>
