    <content><![CDATA[<p>I look forward to welcoming His Excellency Mr Michael D Higgins, President of Ireland, to Australia from the 15th to the 17th of October.</p>
<p>Australia strongly values its close relationship with Ireland. Australia and Ireland recently celebrated 70 years of diplomatic relations.</p>
<p>Our two countries share deep historical and people-to-people links and the Irish have contributed immeasurably to modern day Australia. Today nearly 2.4 million Australians claim Irish ancestry.</p>
<p>The President’s visit is an opportunity to highlight the close ties between our nations, and I look forward to discussing ways to expand our bilateral engagement with President Higgins.</p>
<p>President Higgins is the first Irish President to visit Australia as a Guest of Government since Her Excellency Mary McAleese in 1998.  </p>
<p>His visit follows Foreign Minister Bishop’s successful visit to Ireland in February and the visit by the Governor-General, His Excellency General the Honourable Sir Peter Cosgrove AK MC (Retd), last month.</p>
<p>The President and Mrs Higgins will travel to Canberra, Sydney and Hobart during their visit.</p>
