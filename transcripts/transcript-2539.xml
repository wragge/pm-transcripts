FOR PRESS; PM. No. 25/ 1972.<br />
CYCLONE AL~ THEA COMMON4WEALTH FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, Mr. William McMahon, CH, MP.<br />
Cyclone Althea struck the Townsville region on<br />
24 December last. I informed the then acting Premier of Queensland<br />
on Christmas Day that the Commonwealth Government was ready to join<br />
with the State in providing finance for the relief of personal<br />
hardship and distress and informed him that the co-operation of<br />
Commonwealth facilities was being made available.<br />
The Army and R. A. A. F. rendered sterling service, as<br />
did other Commonwealth authorities.<br />
While relief and restoration measures other than the<br />
relief of personal hardship and distress resulting from na-tural<br />
disasters are regarded as a State responsibility, the Commonwealth<br />
nevertheless recognises that the States have limited financial<br />
resources to draw upon in an emergency and is prepared to assist in<br />
Jinancing measures other than the relief of personal hardship and<br />
distress where the States are involved in substantial expenditu~ re<br />
of an abnormal nature.<br />
Furthermore, when a State incurs expenditure on sugh<br />
additional agreed measures in excess of an initial base amount ip a<br />
financial year, the Commonwealth is prepared to meet in full the.<br />
remaining expenditure which would have been incurred by the State<br />
on eligible relief and restoration measures. As Queensland haf in<br />
1971-72 already incurred expenditure before Cyclone Althea struick<br />
amounting to $ 2 million the " base"~ amount for that State the<br />
Commonwealth has agreed to provide the following financial asststance<br />
to the State, in addition to sharing on a dollar-for-dollar basis<br />
expenditure for the immediate relief of personal hardship and<br />
distress: State Government eligible expenditure in 1971/ 72<br />
on the restoration of Government assets will be<br />
fully reimbursed by the Commonwealth in keeping with<br />
its undertaking to meet all eligible natural<br />
disaster expenditure this year in excess of $ 2<br />
million. ./ 2 </p>
<p>b The Queensland Government normally requires<br />
semi-Government and local authorities to meet<br />
one third of restoration costs in situations<br />
such as this. In view of the large amounts<br />
involved with this cyclone, the Commonwealth has<br />
agreed with a request by the State that such<br />
authorities be required to bear one-third of the<br />
cost of restoration of their assets up to a<br />
maximum of $ 100,000 in any one financial year.<br />
In addition, special consideration will be given<br />
where a figure approaching $ 100,000 would be<br />
unduly onerous for a smaller authority to bear.<br />
The Commonwealth will accordingly meet these<br />
excess costs.<br />
The State's scheme of grants to necessitous<br />
persons for repairing and rebuilding private<br />
dwellings damaged by the cyclone would normally<br />
fall within the category of relief of " personal<br />
hardship and distress" which is shard on a<br />
dollar-for-dollar basis with the State concerned.<br />
In view of the exceptional circumstances of the<br />
disaster and the widespread damage to private<br />
property, particularly that of pensioners, I<br />
have informed the Premier that the State's share<br />
of the cost of this scheme may be included with<br />
its expenditure on the restoration of<br />
Government assets, for the purpose of assessing<br />
the amount of State natural disaster expenditure<br />
reimbursable by the Commonwealth in 1971-72.<br />
On the basis of preliminary estimates, the cost to the<br />
Commonwealth of financial assistance to the Queensland Government in<br />
respect of damage caused by Cyclone Althea will be between $ 5h and<br />
$ 6-oillion this financial year. To the extent that some of the<br />
repairs may not be completed before 30 June 1972, the carry-over<br />
costs would be a charge against the State's base expenditure for<br />
1972--73 and Commonwealth expenditure in 1971-72 would be that much<br />
the less.<br />
