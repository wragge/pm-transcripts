<p>E&amp;OE................................</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister given the St Vincent de Paul report and the with the other report out today can you give an indication whether or not homelessness and housing will be addressed in this month's budget?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well the Commonwealth Government already provided $1.6 billion for rent assistance, and another $1 billion for public housing. It's something that's always under consideration but it is important to state that we already make a very big contribution. And of course lower interest rates have provided a lot more incentive for people to invest in private rental accommodation. And that of course has acted to keep the cost of that accommodation more affordable.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>There's been some confrontation down at the Australian Stock Exchange protest. What was your reaction to that?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I don't give a running commentary on operational police matters. People have a right to put their point of view, but they have no right to interfere with people going about their lawful business.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Do you agree with the Attorney General about Justice Kirby's comments that he's violated the separation of powers?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>The comments that Mr Justice Kirby made at the weekend regarding school funding were a direct intervention into a partisan political debate. It's not appropriate for a High Court Judge to involve himself in something that is so blatantly and obviously a matter of debate between the two political parties.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Sir I can appreciate you not wanting to talk about the police operation but the fact that there are children involved and school kids involved in the front line of this protest must be of particularly.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I don't agree with the exploitation of school children and for these purposes it reflects poorly on some of their teachers. And it also, I got to say, reflects poorly on their parents. I don't think school children should be anywhere then at school when schools are open. That's a very simple principle. That's where they ought to be. They oughtn't be made pawns in political protests.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>On another note Prime Minister, do you believe that your Government is clawing back support?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I really don't know Fleur. I just focus on trying to do the right thing and doing my job and governing and trying to respond to community concerns. There have been some concerns expressed to us. I've listened to those concerns, I've made some adjustments to meet them. As to what impact that's having on the public, well I guess I'll find that out at the end of the year.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>You've alienated some of your traditional supporters, like the elderly and small business.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I'm not going to give a running commentary on that. That's for you. You're the commentator, I'm the advocate.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>(inaudible) internal polling that show.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I never talk about internal polling, Fleur.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Why wasn't Tony Abbott here?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well Tony Abbott was raising money for the disadvantaged with the Pollie-Pedal. He was actually there on his bike. He was actually out the raising money for disadvantaged people. That's why he wasn't here.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>So it had nothing to do with a stoush between him and St Vinnies?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Of good heavens above. Very inventive. But not very accurate.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>(inaudible) comment on the possible irradiation of the dingoes on Fraser Island?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I think that's a matter, look it's a very very sad, a tragic event. Awful. I just feel so sorry for that poor boy's parents. I mean it's just a terrible experience for them. What is the appropriate response I will leave to the relevant state authorities. I don't think the prime minister should give advice on every single thing that's around. But that's an awful tragic event.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
