FORl PRESS PM No. 96/ 1971.<br />
CONSUMER PRICE INDEX SEPTEMBER QUARTER 1971<br />
Statement by the Prime " Linister, Mr. W. illiam MlcMahon<br />
It is perfectly obvious that this further rise in the<br />
Consumer Price Index is predominantly due to cost increases which<br />
have been brought about, directly and indirectly, by very large wage<br />
increases. For example, the big lift in the Index for Sydney largely<br />
reflects increases m ade Lby the Government of New South Wales in fares,<br />
hospital charges and the like. But these were rendered inescapable'by<br />
steep preceding increases in wages and salaries to State employees.<br />
The same sort of influence shows up in the rise of<br />
1.6 per cent for the quarter in the housing component of the Index<br />
for Australia as a whole. This reflects rising costs of building<br />
labour and of building materials.<br />
It is therefore plainly absurd for t--he Leader of the<br />
Opposition to attribute the rise in consumer prices to the policies<br />
of the Government. We have been doing everything in our power to<br />
restrain the underlying forces which have caused these price movements.<br />
In particular we have sought to induce both employers and employees<br />
to observe greater moderation in wage settlements. I am certain that<br />
the great majority of intelligent ' people in the community perceive<br />
the connection between wage increases and price increases and appreciate<br />
the futility of the reckless industrial policies advocated by Mr.<br />
Whitlam and his industrial backers.<br />
If they were genuinely concerned to bring about cost and<br />
price stability in our economy they would be exerting themselves to<br />
achieve the same sort of moderation as the Government has advocated.<br />
This applies especially to the President of the Mr. Hawke.<br />
It is along these lines that Mr. WAhitlam and he could malUng a re-4l<br />
contribution to stability and thero fore to the wellbeing of the<br />
Australian public. In the Budget we directed attention to the fact that<br />
costs and prices were rising under the influence of excessive wage<br />
increases and we shaped our Budget strategy to bring about greater<br />
restraint on these and other cost factors. The rise in the Consumer<br />
Price Index in the last quarter has proved that the diagnosis on which<br />
our Budget was founded was entirely correct.<br />
