ELECTORATE TALK<br />
Governments and people throughout the world are concerned<br />
about the conservation of energy and the need to develo-p energy<br />
resources and technology for the benefit of all people.<br />
Australia because of our abundant energy resources has special<br />
obligations. We have a need for a sound and workable energy<br />
policy to achieve a balanced development of our resources.<br />
When framing our policies, we must strike a balance between<br />
our own present and future needs. We must also : strike a balance<br />
between our own energy interests and our responsibility to<br />
contribute an adequate and stable supply of energy raw materials<br />
to other countries. My government is acutely mindful of its<br />
dual obligations in this critical area.<br />
However, we do not see a detailed national energy policy as<br />
a rigid blueprint to develop our resources. Rather, we believe<br />
an energy policy must be flexible so it can adapt to changing<br />
circumstances and needs.<br />
The Government's role is to create conditions for the prover<br />
and balanced development of energy resources, with full regard to<br />
the impact on people and the environment. We are creating<br />
those conditions.<br />
The Government's resource initiatives are key and integral<br />
elements in our energy policy. Our decisions on the mining and export<br />
of uranium, the development of the North West Shelf, and<br />
our crude oil pricing policy -along with mining industry<br />
incentives are interwoven. They were not isolated decisions,<br />
but taken with full -regard to the requirements of an evolving<br />
energy policy.<br />
Although we are resource-rich compared with most countries,<br />
Australia's greatest resource deficiency is liquid fuel<br />
which is such a vital energy source. In the absence of further<br />
discoveries, our domestic production will contribute a declining<br />
proportion of our liquid fuel requirements in the years ahead. ./ 2 </p>
<p>There are several ways of tackling this problem including,<br />
encouraging the development of our known crude oil and<br />
exploration for new oil; encouraging conservation of our<br />
resources with appropriate pricing and other policies;<br />
constantly examining new technology in meeting our energy<br />
requirements, and in particular, our liquid fuel requirements.<br />
The Government is taking positive action in each of these areas.<br />
We have encouraged oil exploration and development through a<br />
wide range of incentives. Our record stands in stark<br />
contrast with the Labor Government which refused to encourage<br />
the search for more oil, to the nation'is cost. We have<br />
encouraged the conservation of our scarce crude oil resources<br />
through our pricing decision. We increased the price of crude<br />
because we could not afford to continue with a pricing policy<br />
that flew in the face of all energy conservation principles<br />
by condoning excessive consumption of our scarce supplies.<br />
We also needed a pricing policy that encouraged new exploration<br />
to make sure of the full recovery of our known deposits.<br />
We now have that policy.<br />
It is clear that Australia's energy research must be stepped<br />
up significantly as a matter of urgency if we are to develop the<br />
required technological capacity to participate in world advances.<br />
We-are. taking--pos. itive-and planned steps to improve our<br />
energy technology and we will play our part in developing<br />
that technology for the world to share.<br />
For example, we are examining the possible production of liquids<br />
for fuel from coal. The Government has announced it it willing<br />
to join with the States and the Federal Republic of Germany<br />
to examine the feasibility of setting up a coal based motor<br />
spirit plant in Australia.<br />
Australia has also signed an agreement with the United Kingdom<br />
to encourage joint cooperation in coal'technology and research.<br />
Discussions with the United States are also at an advanced stage<br />
in this area. A Government official a coal research sp~ ecialistwill<br />
be visiting the United Kingdom and United States shortly<br />
to liaise on detailed asp) ects of cooperation.<br />
We have also announced a levy of 5c a tonne on coal production in<br />
Australia in the next three years to finance coal research.<br />
Of the so-called alternative energy sources, solar energy<br />
seems the most logical for exploitation in Australia. There is<br />
already a sizeable solar energy research programme in Australia<br />
to which the Government is the main contributor of funds through<br />
the C. S. I. R. O. and the Australian Research Grant Committee.<br />
Unfortunately, Government spending restraints have meant that the<br />
Government had to defer any immediate plans for expanded funding<br />
in this area for the coming financial year. But the Government<br />
has announced its decision that as resources flow from the further<br />
development of uranium, additional funds will be provided to<br />
increase substantially our national effort on solar energy research.<br />
./ 3 </p>
<p>3.<br />
The Government has before it the report on solar energy<br />
from the Senate Standing Committee on National Resources,<br />
and is awaiting the advice and recommendations on energy<br />
research and development from the National Energy Advisory<br />
Council and also from the Australian Science and Technology Council.<br />
These two expert bodies are also considering matters relating<br />
to energy research and development in the context of overall<br />
research and development in Australia.<br />
The Government is aware of its obligations and responsibilities<br />
with our great energy resources. Our actions have demonstrated<br />
our commitment to conserving energy and developing those energy<br />
producinfig materials we have'in abundance, to the benefit of<br />
all nations. </p>
