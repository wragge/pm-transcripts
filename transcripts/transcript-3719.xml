PRIME MINISTER'S OVERSEAS VISIT<br />
The Prime Minister, Mr. Whitlau, left Australia on<br />
23rd April to attend the Commonwealth H-eads of Government<br />
Meeting in Kingston, Jamaica, and to pay official visits<br />
to Peru and the United States.<br />
He will return to Australia on 11th May. His<br />
itinerary is attached.<br />
Before leaving Australia, Mr. Whitlam reaffirmed<br />
Australia's support for the Commonwealth as a unique multiracial<br />
grouping. He said that the Commnonwvealth was a<br />
voluntary association of 34 independent states, each<br />
responsible for its own policies, but consulting and<br />
co-operating in the common interests of their peoples to<br />
promote international understanding and world peace. He<br />
noted also the important non-governmental links which<br />
existed between professional and other associations in<br />
Commonwealth countries.<br />
The Australian Government, he said, attached<br />
particular importance to the development of co-operative<br />
international arrangements of this kind which would operate<br />
free from special allegiances to power blocs.<br />
He was looking forward to a detailed exchange of<br />
views on changing power relationships as well as world<br />
trade and financial matters, which would be important<br />
subjects for consideration at this meeting.<br />
During his visit to Washington, Mr. Whitlam will<br />
meet President Ford and Dr. Kissinger, as well as members<br />
of the House International Rel~ ations Committee and the<br />
Senate Foreign Relations Committee. 2 </p>
<p>This will be his second meeting with President<br />
Ford in just over six months providing a good opportunity<br />
for discussion of developm-ients in power relationships,<br />
particularly in Indo-China, in the intervening period.<br />
Mr. Whitlam's visit to Peru will be the first<br />
by an Australian Prime Minister to South America. In<br />
Peru he will hold talks with the President, General Juan<br />
Velasco Alvarado and the Prime Minister, General Morales<br />
Bermudez. He will also visit historic Machu Picchu.<br />
Mr. Whitlam said that Peru was an important<br />
Pacific state which had played a major r-ole in matters<br />
concerning the law of the sea and in the non-aligned<br />
movement. It was also a mem~ ber of the Organisation of<br />
American States and the Andean Group of States. Australia<br />
has observer status with both organisations.<br />
