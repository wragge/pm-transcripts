PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 21 JUNE 1985<br />
The Government and I have today expressed our deepest<br />
sympathy to the family of the two children who were<br />
tragically killed yesterday in the bombing at Frankfurt<br />
Airport. Our heartfelt wishes for the recovery of their<br />
mother, grandmother and family friend who were seriously<br />
injured in the blast have also been conveyed.<br />
The message of sympathy and condolence has been sent to<br />
the children's father, Mr Guerreiro, who is flying to<br />
Frankfurt today.<br />
I am appalled at the senseless slaughter and suffering<br />
of innocent people in the outrage at Frankfurt Airport.<br />
The bombing brings home the cruel fact that nobody,<br />
including innocent children, is immune from the threat<br />
of terrorism.<br />
The tragic deaths of the children and the suffering of<br />
the Guerreiro family, coming so soon after the ordeal of<br />
another Australian family, the Hendersons, in the TWA<br />
hi-jack, have once again dramatically illustrated the<br />
need for a strengthened international effort to combat<br />
international terrorism. </p>
