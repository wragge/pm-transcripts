PRIME MINISTER<br />
CHECK AGAINST DELITVERY EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
ANNUAL DINNER OF THE<br />
AUSTRALIAN MINING INDUSTRY COUNCIL<br />
CANBERRA 3 MAY 1990<br />
This is my seventh address to the annual dinner of the<br />
Australian Mining Industry Council. The first, delivered<br />
just two months after coming to office, focussed on domestic<br />
economic conditions and mining taxation policy. The second,<br />
third and fourth addresses from 1984 to 1986 dealt with<br />
the international trading cycle and the progressively<br />
gloomier prospects for world mineral prices.<br />
In 1987 signs of a recovery in mineral prices began to<br />
emerge and I introduced a further consideration into my<br />
speech to you: the relationship between mining and the<br />
environment. I did not appear in 1988. I have had the records checked,<br />
and I did receive an invitation so my 1987 speecH must not<br />
have gone down too badly.<br />
I have been able to ascertain that on the night of May<br />
1988 I was toiling away in a meeting of the Government's<br />
Structural Adjustment Committee. That series of SAC<br />
meetings and meetings of the Expenditure Review Committee<br />
culminated in the 1988 May Statement a statement which<br />
announced the most far reaching micro-economic reforms ever<br />
undertaken by an Australian Government. These included<br />
sweeping tariff reductions, business tax reforms and a range<br />
of other reforms in telecommunications, primary industry,<br />
grain handling and government business enterprises.<br />
So you can see I was heavily pre-occupied on May 5, 1988.<br />
Last year the Governm * ent delivered an Economic Statement in<br />
April.-I . wasable to.. attend-the -AMIC-. dinner and more than<br />
half of my address was devoted to the concept of<br />
ecologically sustainable development.<br />
So what can we learn from this brief review of my addresses<br />
to AMIC?<br />
First, my strike rate in attending AMIC dinners is 87.5 per<br />
cent. </p>
<p>Second, arising from the first lesson, we obviously have<br />
found each other's company congenial, the food is always<br />
good and I suspect but I do not know that the wine, too,<br />
is of high quality.<br />
And third, the issues confronting AMIC and the Government in<br />
earlier years in spite of substantial progress made<br />
remain important issues of today: the international trading<br />
system as it affects commodity prices, and micro-economic<br />
reform and its implications for the minerals industries.<br />
Yet the newer issue of the environment is coming to overlay<br />
these more conventional concerns.<br />
That is not to say that AMIC and the Government should pay<br />
less attention to global economic conditions, the<br />
international trading system, and economic management and<br />
micro-economic reform at home. To the contrary. These are<br />
of paramount importance to the viability of the Australian<br />
mining industries and to the health of the Australian<br />
economy. And here let me reaffirm, in the face of some possible<br />
doubts, that my Government recognises the indispensable<br />
contribution of the Australian mining industries to the<br />
nation's economic prosperity: most particularly, its<br />
contribution to easing the current account deficit.<br />
But recognition and applause are not, of themselves, enough<br />
just as the continuation of past practices by some mining<br />
industries would not constitute an adequate response to<br />
today's demands for high environmental standards. " And let<br />
me say that, judging from its discussions with members of my<br />
Government, AMIC is responsive to the higher environmental<br />
standards nowadays expected of the mining industries. I<br />
readily acknowledge that and am greatly encouraged by it.<br />
For economic development in Australia and in particular,<br />
mineral development, is sustainable in the long term only if<br />
it is ecologically sustainable.<br />
You may be aware that one of the major commitments of my<br />
Government is to formulate strategies which give practical<br />
effect to the concept of ecologically sustainable<br />
development. This is not, of course, a new concept. It underpins many<br />
eRisting government policies and programs. But it now needs<br />
. to be applied . systematically . across all our industry<br />
sectors: agriculture, mining, forestry, fisheries, energy<br />
and manufacturing.<br />
A discussion paper on the concept of sustainable development<br />
is now being finalised by a Government Interdepartmental<br />
Committee, for consideration by the special new Cabinet<br />
sub-committee on sustainable development.<br />
When finalised, the discussion paper will be circulated<br />
within the community for comment. </p>
<p>Once that initial process is completed I envisage that<br />
working groups comprising representatives of industry,<br />
unions and the conservation movement will identify and<br />
propose solutions to the most pressing problems in each<br />
major industry sector. I have also invited the State and<br />
Territory Governments to be involved.<br />
We must move our renewable resource industries towards<br />
sustainable yields from forests, from the soils, from the<br />
oceans. The utilisation of our non-renewable resources needs to<br />
satisfy different criteria. They must be used more<br />
efficiently and recycled to the extent that is feasible.<br />
Industries must find ways to use energy, water and materials<br />
more efficiently and meet appropriate standards of<br />
environmental protection.<br />
Recently there has been some revival of support for negative<br />
economic growth as a way of protecting the environment. But<br />
a world experiencing negative growth would be a world in<br />
which poverty was even more endemic and therefore a world<br />
which would be even more prone to ecological and other<br />
disasters. So I categorically reject the negative growth thesis as a<br />
solution to environmental degradation.<br />
But if we are to achieve sustainable development, several<br />
conditions need to be met.<br />
First, it is essential for governments to get the economic<br />
and environmental policy frameworks right.<br />
Second, people in industry and the consuming public need to<br />
be well informed about environmental issues and be given the<br />
right price signals.<br />
And third, environmental values need to be built into<br />
economic decisions at all levels in the community.<br />
My Government has already taken steps to ensure a better<br />
integration of environmental considerations in its own<br />
economic decision making. The Environment Minister is a<br />
member of the Structural Adjustment Committee of Cabinet,<br />
adfd environmental impacts are addressed in Cabinet<br />
submissions. The newly established special Cabinet sub-committee on<br />
sustainable development will oversee the Commonwealth's part<br />
in formulating the sustainable development strategy. You<br />
will appreciate that that is a very high level committee<br />
reflecting a very serious determination on our part to<br />
ensure reason, balance and consistency in our consideration<br />
of resource development issues. We believe in growth, we<br />
believe in the environment; we are determined to have both. </p>
<p>Rational, well-informed decisions require good information<br />
and analytical bases. Over the last two years my Government<br />
has progressively increased funding for resource and<br />
environmental data bases and information systems. And in<br />
establishing the Resource Assessment Commission we have set<br />
up a major, open inquiry mechanism.<br />
The Government has also made more funds available for public<br />
education, because without adequate information consumers<br />
will not be able to make environmentally sound choices. A<br />
good deal more still remains to be done in this area.<br />
The new Minister for the Environment, Ros Kelly, has<br />
signalled her interest in environmental programs in schools<br />
and a closer linking with science education.<br />
It is necessarily the responsibility of governments at<br />
both the Commonwealth and State levels to set the basic<br />
framework for sustainable development. Governments must set<br />
acceptable standards, and do what they can to ensure the<br />
standards are met. They must also try to ensure that market<br />
prices, which are the key to the way we all use resources,<br />
better reflect the environmental costs of our actions and<br />
the environmental values of the community.<br />
The root cause of much environmental degradation has been<br />
market failure. Many environmental resources, like the<br />
atmosphere and our rivers and oceans, are overused and<br />
abused because they are free or underpriced.<br />
We would therefore expect the working groups to look closely<br />
at the full range of regulatory and market-based mechanisms<br />
to see which current measures are encouraging or impeding<br />
our reaching the environmental standards we want, and to<br />
propose a new mix of measures that better and more<br />
effectively meet our environmental goals.<br />
The achievement of sustainable development will require<br />
changes in various industry practices. There is also an<br />
expectation that industry will make a continuing effort to<br />
develop and implement new, cleaner, more efficient<br />
technologies. I was pleased to see the recent statement by the Business<br />
Council of Australia acknowledging that industry has a duty<br />
to observe high standards, though I do not believe that<br />
industry self-regulation will be enough in itself to achieve<br />
them. Fundamental shifts in attitude and behaviour are required.<br />
I invite the mining industries to join with us in designing<br />
the mix of measures that will ensure that these changes<br />
occur. </p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen,<br />
In the past, sustainable development for the minerals sector<br />
has focussed on concerns about the rate of resource<br />
depletion and the availability of mineral resources for<br />
future development. Today, sustainable development is<br />
concerned with other and much wider matters, including<br />
access to land for exploration and development, resource<br />
taxation, and the implementation of environmental<br />
assessment, protection and rehabilitation policies.<br />
Appropriate access to land for mineral exploration and<br />
development has been at the top of the industry's agenda for<br />
some time. Clearly there are going to be continuing<br />
differences of view on this issue between the industry,<br />
conservation and many community groups.<br />
For its part, the Government has already laid down a number<br />
of guiding principles for the resolution of land use<br />
conflicts. But I readily acknowledge that the mining industries are<br />
entitled to a greater degree of certainty in relation to<br />
access to potential mineral deposits than they have received<br />
to date.<br />
This does not mean open slather. High conservation areas<br />
will remain closed to mining.<br />
And where access is contemplated by government, the' normal<br />
EIS processes will apply.<br />
But through the participation of all parties in the mining<br />
industry working group on sustainable development, I hope<br />
that we can achieve together guaranteed protection for high<br />
conservation areas, greater assuredness of access for the<br />
mining industries to lower conservation areas, more<br />
consistent and transparent approval procedures for major<br />
resource projects, and the adoption of high environmental<br />
standards in the development of mineral deposits.<br />
I am confident we can achieve these ambitious goals if we<br />
have the full co-operation of AMIC and the mining<br />
industries, together with the conservation movement and<br />
other interest groups.<br />
An equally.. important area. of industry concern is the<br />
question of the level of resource taxation. Over the last<br />
year this concern has centred on the Government's review of<br />
petroleum taxation. Nevertheless, it is a crucial issue to<br />
all our natural resource based industries.<br />
The Government strongly believes that the community is<br />
entitled to an appropriate return in exchange for the right<br />
to exploit a community owned resource. </p>
<p>At the same time the Government fully appreciates the need<br />
to provide companies with sufficient financial incentives to<br />
explore and develop these valuable resources.<br />
Inevitably the structure and level of this taxation will be<br />
the subject of some disagreement. In this context I hope<br />
that the present Industry Commission inquiry into mining and<br />
mineral processing will provide some further analysis of the<br />
various options. The draft report is due to be released<br />
next month and could provide a valuable input for the<br />
sustainable development working group's discussions.<br />
In this context, you will be aware that I recently announced<br />
that the Government will be reviewing the current taxation<br />
policies as they relate to minesite rehabilitation and the<br />
removal of offshore oil and gas platforms.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen,<br />
0 In my Environment Statement last year I made a commitment<br />
that Australia would play its part in reducing global<br />
greenhouse gas emissions, both domestically and<br />
internationally. The first phase of the Government's investigations into<br />
reducing emissions domestically was the preparation of a<br />
discussion paper prepared by a special working group of<br />
Commonwealth departments.<br />
This is an issue fundamental to Australian industry's<br />
competitiveness, particularly in the minerals sector. We<br />
are all aware of the spotlight that has been turned on coal,<br />
and on carbon dioxide emissions more generally. I would<br />
urge you all to respond to what we have proposed in the<br />
discussion paper, either directly or through AMIC.<br />
We will continue to work with other countries in developing<br />
solutions to the global problems arising from the greenhouse<br />
effect, as well as funding our own greenhouse research<br />
program. Australia is working hard, especially within the<br />
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, to develop an<br />
international framework convention on climate change that<br />
will bind all countries to a program of reducing greenhouse<br />
gas emissions and taking other measures to ameliorate or<br />
rdspond to the greenhouse effect.<br />
As I indicated in my Environment Statement, it may be that<br />
the sensible global strategy is for some energy-intensive<br />
activities to be relocated to efficient energy-producing<br />
countries such as Australia. Total world greenhouse gas<br />
emissions could be lowered in the process so long as<br />
industry in Australia is prepared to collaborate with<br />
government in raising energy efficiency to yield a lower<br />
level of greenhouse gas emissions for a given level of<br />
production. </p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen,<br />
Our desire to meet the environmental challenges facing<br />
Australia, while sustaining economic growth, is another<br />
reason why the vigorous pursuit of microeconomic reform is<br />
an imperative for my Government.<br />
Continuing the Government's already strong performance on<br />
microeconomic reform is crucial to the economy as a whole<br />
but it will also contribute a great deal to the competitive<br />
position of the Australian mining industries. Lower<br />
protection and greater competition will improve the<br />
performance of those feeder industries which supply the<br />
goods and services on which the mining industries rely.<br />
And a more efficient allocation of resources between sectors<br />
will assist the mining industry as it vies with other<br />
industries for vital land, labour and capital.<br />
In February this year I outlined ten central elements of my<br />
Government's ambitious but achievable fourth term<br />
microeconomic policy agenda. Further reforms in the fields<br />
of aviation, telecommunications, industry, shipping,<br />
electricity generation, railways and the labour market are<br />
all of critical importance to Australia's economic future.<br />
Reforms of particular relevance to the mining industry are<br />
those affecting the transport sector. In rail, my<br />
Government's pursuit of a national rail freight initiative<br />
will be a priority. Already several reviews are underway,<br />
including a feasibility study on a national rail freight<br />
organisation and the Industry Commission inquiry into the<br />
efficiency of the rail sector.<br />
We recognise mining's dependence on an efficient rail system<br />
and will be looking towards making that sector much more<br />
effective and responsive to customer needs. I trust that<br />
all State Governments will work with us in that task:<br />
without their co-operation little can be achieved.<br />
Shipping reforms already set in place will progressively put<br />
operating costs and manning levels of Australian flag<br />
shipping on a par with those of our major trading partners.<br />
The program for waterfront reform will be pursued vigorously<br />
and we expect that the major enterprise agreements will be<br />
c6ncluded this year.<br />
Obviously the mining industries are also set to benefit from<br />
the Government's broader reform agenda which will tackle<br />
inefficiencies throughout the economy.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen,<br />
On the international front, I want to report to you briefly<br />
on progress in the GATT Uruguay Round. </p>
<p>After a lengthy stalemate, there has been recent progress in<br />
the negotiations on natural resource based products in the<br />
Round. Agreement on procedures in February has opened the<br />
way for substantive negotiations to begin. In addition,<br />
after considerable pressure from Australia and others, the<br />
European Community has agreed to negotiate on a key product,<br />
coal, in the Round.<br />
Our challenge now is to tackle subsidies and other measures<br />
that seriously distort trade, notably in coal but also in<br />
other natural resource based products. These trade<br />
distortions also contribute to major problems of land and<br />
atmospheric degradation.<br />
We are working to build support for our efforts to secure<br />
comprehensive reform of the trade in coal. But while we<br />
have taken a couple of steps forward, we recognise the most<br />
difficult stages lie ahead.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen,<br />
This is a very important time for the Government, the mining<br />
industries and the nation. It is a time for accelerated<br />
reform to make our economy more competitive, more flexible<br />
and more resilient.<br />
It is a time when our industries must achieve environmental<br />
sustainability while at the same time raising their<br />
productivity and increasing their contribution to<br />
Australia's current account.<br />
These are not easily achievable ambitions either for<br />
government or for AMIC.<br />
But through your co-operation in the sustainable development<br />
working groups and through the normal channels open to you<br />
for making your views known to my Government, I invite you<br />
to join with us in achieving together our very important<br />
our very ambitious goals.<br />
In meeting these challenges I am confident that AMIC and its<br />
members will come to enjoy under my Government an<br />
increasingly predictable and coherent framework of policies<br />
and processes a framework which will allow the mining<br />
industries to invest with greater confidence in the<br />
environmentally sustainable development of this country's<br />
great mineral resources. </p>
