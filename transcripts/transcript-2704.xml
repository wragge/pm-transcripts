STATEIENT BY THE PRIDE MINISTER, THE RT HON.<br />
WILLIAM McMAHON, CH, MP, IN THE HOUSE<br />
OF REPRESENTATIVES, CANBERRA.<br />
POWERS OVER AND PROTECTION OFFERED TO WITNESSES BEFORE<br />
PARLIAMENTARY COEMITTEES 26 OCTOBER, 1972<br />
Mr Speaker? The paper I have just tabled has been prepared by the<br />
two chief law officers of the Crown, the Attorney-General and the<br />
Solicitor-General. It is entitled " Powers over and protection<br />
offered to witnesses before Parliamentary Committees".<br />
In May 1971, at a time of great public interest in the<br />
subject, I requested the Attorney-General to prepare a paper of the<br />
parliamentary committee system which would give particular attention<br />
to the constitutional position and the provision of guidelines for<br />
the protection of witnesses.<br />
The comprehensive paper I have just tabled was prepared<br />
by the Attorney in collaboration with the Solicitor-General.<br />
Its purpose is to discuss the power of inquiry of committees appointed<br />
by Houses of the Parliament, and the rights and duties of witnesses<br />
appearing before those committees. The paper also considers whether<br />
there are any additional steps which might be taken to safeguard the<br />
interests of witnesses and of persons named in evidence before the<br />
committees. The Government has not yet had an opportunity to consider<br />
the position as disclosed by the paper or the suggestions made for<br />
possible changes. However, in viewt of the great importance of the subject,<br />
the Government has decided that the paper should now be tabled, so<br />
that it can be studied by Members of the Parliament and the public.<br />
As I conclude, Mr Speaker, I want to express to the Attorney-<br />
General and the Solicitor-General my appreciation, which I am sure will<br />
be shared by all who read the paper, of the comprehensiveness of the<br />
paper and of the very considerable amount of time, effort, skill and<br />
learning which has gone into its preparation. </p>
