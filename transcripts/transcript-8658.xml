PRIME MINISTER<br />
EMBARGO: AGAINST DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING, MP<br />
NATIONAL PRESS CLUB, CANBERRA, 15 SEPTEMBER 1992<br />
This is the full text of the Press Club address.<br />
Because of time constraints the Prime Minister will<br />
deliver an edited version.<br />
When Dr Hewson addressed you here at the Press Club on<br />
September 25 last year, he said this:<br />
" The fact is, of course, that nobody has actually really<br />
tried rational economics properly".<br />
The implications of these words were not clear then.<br />
The zealot in Dr Hewson had not entirely emerged.<br />
Neither had Fichbag-k<br />
But we've seen both now.<br />
We've seen the launch of Fightback and several direct<br />
hits scored against it.<br />
But it has become clear that for all the holes which have<br />
appeared, Fightback has not been allowed to go entirely<br />
under. It cannot sink just yet, because in a very real sense<br />
Fightback is just another word for Dr Hewson.<br />
I think that may be why he takes every criticism of his<br />
policies as personal abuse.<br />
It is a case of " I am the Word and the Word is<br />
Fightback". The Coalition can't sink Fightback without sinking Dr<br />
Newson. So, unless the Coalition suddenly bites the bullet and<br />
sinks its leader, Fightback is going to be still bobbing<br />
around at the next election. </p>
<p>TIEL. S: ep 9 15 : 19 No .012 3.<br />

Fightback is the alternative Policy package, the<br />
alternative ideology, the alternative Australia.<br />
It is only now that Australians are realising what the<br />
full implications of Dr Hewson's Fightback are.<br />
Of course a great many Australians have never accepted<br />
the idea of the consumption tax at the centre of<br />
Fightback. And it's true that a lot of business people have been<br />
uneasy for a long while.<br />
His own party has been uneasy.<br />
The scrutiny we've subjected it to in the last six months<br />
has made it, as I said, a pretty lifeless object.<br />
But it's ticking. As long as the doctor's around it's<br />
alive.<br />
And I think in the last couple of months more and more<br />
people have begun to wake up to the threat of the thing.<br />
The nation I believe is coming to the rather chilling<br />
realisation that Dr flewson has no intention of changing<br />
his ways.<br />
That he is utterly committed to all the policy<br />
prescriptions of Fightback.<br />
This is not a party platform in the conventional sense.<br />
These are not broad objectives but detailed articles of<br />
faith and collectively they will mean the most radical<br />
uprooting of the Australian economy and society in our<br />
history. Dr Hewson is not talking about building on what has been<br />
achieved over a century, or even on those higher orders<br />
of competition, production and social unity we have<br />
developed in the last decade.<br />
He's talking about doing it from Year One tearing it<br />
down and starting again.<br />
That's what I mean about the implications of those words<br />
of his last year " nobody has really tried rational<br />
economics properly".<br />
Not Thatcher, not Reagan, not Fraser, not Roger Douglas.<br />
None of them went far enough.<br />
What does " properly" mean if not a more pure, a more<br />
extreme version of what they did?<br />
What does " tried" mean if not experimented?<br />
TEL </p>
<p>IEL Sep .92 15 : 19 No .012 P .03/.<br />

Experiments with a theory. Experiments with society.<br />
With people's lives. Experiments with industries.<br />
if these experiments fail, too bad.<br />
By the word " properly" Dr Hewson meant economic Darwinism<br />
the survival of the fittest. Or the luckiest.<br />
This m~ eans that the main role for government is to ensure<br />
that the " price signals" are correct. Governments should<br />
withdraw. But governing a nation is not about withdrawing from the<br />
important decisions the nation must address; it is-,,<br />
fundamentally about knowing how to act to bring about<br />
genuine, lasting change.<br />
Dr Hewson claims that his Fightback package will change<br />
the Australian economy and Australian society for the<br />
better. This cannot in any way be true.<br />
At its heart Fightback is essentially a switch in the tax<br />
base from income to expenditure, and a clumsy, regressive<br />
one at that.<br />
It's a tax switch which lifts the tax burden on low to<br />
middle income earners to benefit higher income earners.<br />
it claims to reduce the tax burden on employment by<br />
abolishing payroll tax but then substitutes for payroll<br />
tax a much-he-avie-rtax on employment. And that of course<br />
is a much larger Goods and Services Tax on the value<br />
added by labour at each step in the productive chain.<br />
But Fightback is about more than a tax switch.<br />
it also contains policies on tariffs, industrial<br />
relations, cuts in government outlays and health amongst<br />
other things.<br />
Zero tariffs is simply a textbook objective that is not<br />
grounded in the real world or the real problems faced<br />
by particular industries.<br />
It is naive and destructive.<br />
The Liberals -industrial relations pfoli ' cy is under attack<br />
from large and small companies aike, from one industry<br />
group to another. All see it as confrontationist, and<br />
uncomprehending or workplace realities.<br />
Dr Hewson proposes the destruction of Medicare. the one<br />
comprehensive and simple health system Australia has had.<br />
And why? For no better reason than to improve the<br />
incomes of medical practitioners, specialists, private<br />
hospitals and the private health insurance industry.<br />
TEL </p>
<p>TEL 4<br />
A significant proportion of the population would again be<br />
under-insured. A significant proportion would again find<br />
that they could not afford health services.<br />
In quite unequivocal terms, Fightback is bad news for<br />
Australia. The entire economy put at risk to deliver one political<br />
objective a 30 cent marginal income tax rate for most<br />
taxpayers. Yet the Government will introduce the same 30 cent rate<br />
but no consumption tax.<br />
Now let us look in more detail at Dr Hewson'* " tax<br />
switch". THE MAGIC PUDDING<br />
At the centre of the Liberal's Fightback is the switch in<br />
taxation away from income to reliance on a goods and<br />
services tax. This exercise involves shuf fling<br />
billion in the name of assisting business at considerable<br />
cost and disruption.<br />
Fightback claims that business will be better off and<br />
that every household will be better off.<br />
Dr Hewsofl wants us to imagine that business can take its<br />
slice without reducing the amount available to<br />
households. It's a magic pudding policy!<br />
Dr Hewson claimns that taxes on business would be cut by<br />
billion.<br />
But the revenue collected from the GST cannot be used<br />
both to improve the prof itability5TbtiFusinesses to the<br />
tune of $ 20 billion, and to pass on the benefits to<br />
consumers in the form of lower prices.<br />
Without the extra profitablity where is the benefit to<br />
business? Without the lower prices where is the benefit<br />
to consumers?<br />
If business were to enjoy the $ 20 billion, the inflation<br />
effect would not be 5 to 6 per cent, but much closer to<br />
the full 15 per cent.<br />
WINNERS AND LOSERSl,<br />
A moment's thought should convince anyone that<br />
rearranging taxes cannot make everybody better of f.<br />
But it can make for winners and losers. 15 Sep .92 15 : 19 No .012 F* .04: 1. </p>
<p>T: 15 iep 1 15 : 19 No. 01 2 P .05/ 1<br />
And with Dr HewSon's GST there would be a massive<br />
redistribution of income away from average families to<br />
the wealthy.<br />
Treasury has shown that 70 per cent of households would<br />
be made worse of f to fund large gains for the rich.<br />
For example, a family with children and both partners<br />
working and earning $ 25,000 each would be up to $ 25 a<br />
week worse of f. on the other hand, if that fam~ ily's<br />
combined income were over $ 90,000, they would find<br />
themselves up to $ 105 a week, or up to $ 5,460 a year,<br />
better of f.<br />
Fair go, Hewson-style. Incentive, Hewson-style.<br />
MACROECONOMIC EFECTS<br />
It is claimed that the introduction of the GST at the<br />
expense of other forms of taxation would improve<br />
incentives to work, to save and to export.<br />
But there is no evidence for this. People don't work<br />
longer and harder simply because their consumption rather<br />
than their income is taxed. Changes to taxes have only<br />
marginal effects on overall saving behaviour. And,<br />
because the exchange rate is free to adjust, there is no<br />
evidence to support the view that exports would lift.<br />
The effects are simply too small to measure.<br />
And certainly too small to warrant all the costs and<br />
disruption to Industry and the community that would come<br />
from a GST.<br />
This is exactly what was found by Chris Murphy, the<br />
economist who was asked by Dr Hewson to do the modelling<br />
for Pightback. on the crucial assumption that workers do<br />
not seek wage increases to compensate for the price<br />
effects of the GST, Murphy's results show that a switch<br />
from income tax to the GST has small effects on output,<br />
the current account and employment. In fact, for the<br />
first five years, he found that production would actually<br />
fall and unemployment rise.<br />
Professor John Freebairn from Monash University has<br />
argued that a switch from a broadly based payroll tax<br />
system to a GST would have a minimal impact on the<br />
economy. Treasury's analysis of the major elements of Fightback,<br />
and again on the assumption that the compensation package<br />
was adequate, show the overall impact on the economy to<br />
be very small. TEL </p>
<p>TEL 6<br />
The basic message coming from these studies is that there<br />
is likely to be very little impact on employment, or<br />
output or the balance of payments from the money<br />
shuffling exercise.<br />
a macroeconomics exercise, it simply doesn't rate.<br />
Crucially, however, the GST would have a profound<br />
negative impact on the economy if it disrupts prices and<br />
wages. If firms used the GST as an excuse for raising<br />
prices by more than the direct effect of the taxes, or if<br />
employees refused to accept full discounting of their<br />
wages for the effect of the GST on prices, then the<br />
economy would be severely damaged.<br />
But why would workers not seek compensation for higher<br />
prices? After all, the great bulk of workers ls under Dr<br />
Kewson's proposed compensation package. Of course they<br />
will try to retrieve their position in the field.<br />
And if this happens, Chris Murphy's results show that GDP<br />
would fall by 4 per cent in the first 5 years. Prices<br />
would be sharply up. The unemployment rate would be 2<br />
percentage points higher!<br />
When Dr Hewson Is pressed on the damaging effects of the<br />
GST, his retort is that Fightback is more than the OST,<br />
it's also about industrial relations, eliminating all<br />
tariffs, microeconomic reform, health and so on.<br />
INnDUsTAL CON4FLICT<br />
Everyone agrees that we need to improve the<br />
responsiveness of the workplace. Indeed, this Labor<br />
Government has worked with employers and unions to<br />
achieve just this. The results have been coming through<br />
with agreements like those at Sheraton, Email, Toyota,<br />
Concrete Constructions and so on.<br />
In the media recently, we have seen how such agreements<br />
have been reached in many successful businesses through a<br />
spirit of cooperation. These stories have 81s0 touched<br />
on the real fears that many businesspeople and workers<br />
have about the opposition's approach to industrial<br />
relations. The Coalition has an ideological aversion to the<br />
cooperative approach now being generally applied to get<br />
the best from our workplaces. The Coalition's textbook<br />
offers the Darwinian prescription.<br />
More Strength to the strong.<br />
For there is no doubt that those in a strong bargaining<br />
position would benefit from the free for all.<br />

But most would lose.<br />
The safety net for low income earners would be ripped<br />
away. Those without long-established and firm links with the<br />
labour force would lose out.<br />
Women would number heavily among the losers. And young<br />
people. Business would lose from a renewal of the discord and<br />
uncertainty that was crippling industry a decade ago.<br />
Australia would lose.<br />
INLATQli<br />
This Labor government has created industrial harmony and<br />
low inflation through policies of cooperation.<br />
Under Coalition policies, the risk of excessive wage<br />
demands and higher inflation would return with any<br />
strengthening in the labour market.<br />
And the only instrument that the Coalition has to<br />
maintain low inflation would be tight monetary policy,<br />
higher interest rates. Australia would be condemned to a<br />
long period of very high unemployment.<br />
And we should reflect on this at the same time as he<br />
introduces the GST price hike, Dr Hewson would abandon<br />
the i ncomes policy which has so effectively reduced<br />
inflation. IMPACT ON BUSINESS<br />
The opposition says that jobs will be created because<br />
Fightback is pro-business.<br />
But are industrial conflict, high interest rates or<br />
higher inflation pro-business?<br />
Fightback is a massive and disruptive accounting exercise<br />
for little worthwhile purpose.<br />
According to the estimates in Fightback, the GST would<br />
bring in $ 27 billion.<br />
Although Fightback involves quite a few minor changes,<br />
this money in essence is used for four purposes which add<br />
up to $ 26 billion:<br />
SFirst, compensation for the impact of the GST on<br />
pensions, fami~ ly allowances and the States amounts to<br />
about $ 4 billion. TEL </p>
<p>TEL a<br />
1Second, the CST replaces wholesale sales taxes at a<br />
cost of $ 9 billion.<br />
1Third, payroll taxes are abolished at 8 cost of $ 6<br />
billion.<br />
SFinally, petrol excise is abolished at a cost of $ 7<br />
billion.<br />
Essentially we have a new tax to be paid by business to<br />
replace some existing taxes.<br />
This is Dr Hewson's great bargain.<br />
He likes to focus on the seven taxes that would be<br />
removed to sweeten the pill.<br />
But let us look briefly 8t the rationale for these.<br />
Four of the taxes the training gua ranitee levy, the coal<br />
-export levy, customs duE-es-, and the-tax on lIump sum<br />
superannuation would only have a limited impact on<br />
revenues and, indeed, on costs to business.<br />
The remaining three are more significant elements of our<br />
tax system. However, the supposed advantages of the OST<br />
are illusory.<br />
First, the wholesale sales tax. No tax is perfect, and<br />
this one isn't. But the WST has distinct advantages over<br />
the GST:<br />
1Wholesale sales tax is levied at different rates for<br />
different items which means that the great bulk of<br />
basic necessities fresh fruit and vegetables, meat,<br />
clothes, electricity bills, and so on are tax exempt.<br />
1Compliance costs for the WST are low with very few<br />
businesses required to pay.<br />
Dr Hewson also says he will remove the excise on petrol.<br />
But this is a sham because it leaves a very large hole in<br />
road funding which will have to be made up elsewhere.<br />
The National Road Transport Commission ( NRTC) has<br />
estimated that the cost of running Australian roads is<br />
around $ 4.3 billion while the GST applied to petrol will<br />
only raise about $ 750 million. This leaves an amount<br />
equivalent to 18 cents per litre of petrol that has to be<br />
raised from Australian motorists.<br />
So where will It come from?<br />
A tax on kilometres travelled would be akin to the petrol<br />
excise without providing any incentives for fuel<br />
efficiency. 15 :-ep .92 15 19 No .012) P I </p>
<p>TEL 9<br />
Higher registration charges would have to be ve high<br />
and extend to passenger cars.<br />
All in all, the abolition of petrol excise is a poor<br />
deal. It Is in Fightback largely as 8 sop to the National<br />
Party. Even here, the farmers who already get the Diesel<br />
Fuel Rebate get a lousy deal because they don't pay<br />
payroll tax and they will be slugged twice by the GST<br />
once as collectors and once as consumers.<br />
Finally, the payroll tax levied by the States. This is<br />
the proposal that probably attracts the most interest<br />
from business. But, as Professor Freebairn has pointed<br />
out, there is little difference between payroll tax and a<br />
tax on the value that is added to products by labour.<br />
The economic effect of the payroll tax is very like a<br />
uniform GST and substituting one for the other will<br />
contribute very little even if the inevitable problems<br />
with the States could be resolved.<br />
In summary, replacing some existing taxes with a GST is a<br />
costly accounting exercise the nation can't afford.<br />
And small business would pay dearly.<br />
They typically do not benefit from the removal of current<br />
taxes because of the relatively high thresholds.<br />
But they would have to keep records to comply with the<br />
GST. Overseas studies have found similar taxes to be<br />
very regressive in that compliance costs can be over 250<br />
times greater for small business than large business in<br />
relative terms.<br />
At present small business doesn't even pay most of the<br />
taxes that Fightback promises to abolish:<br />
I According to ABS statistics, there are currently<br />
832,000 businesses in Australia. Most of these are<br />
small businesses and almost all will have to fill out<br />
their 09T forms.<br />
I~ But of these, over 700,000 do not pay payroll tax.<br />
I And only 20,000 are required to pay the WST while<br />
perhaps twice this number will be in the WST system in<br />
practice.<br />
800,000 small businesses are destined to become the new<br />
tax collectors for Dr Hewson.<br />
To paraphrase a tax expert from New Zealand, they can<br />
forget about Sunday afternoons with the family.<br />
MICROFCONOMIr REFORM T: 15. SOep. 15: 1'? No Al12 </p>
<p>TEL<br />
Dr Hewson also likes to argue that business will benefit<br />
from other aspects of Fightback.<br />
Like the conflict in his blueprint for industrial<br />
relations. Like the application of his survival-of-the-fittest<br />
philosophy to the car inldustry.<br />
Indeed, like much of Fightback, just what Dr Hewson<br />
intends on micro reform is poorly spelt out.<br />
For " illustrative" purposes, Fightback sets out the<br />
benefits that may flow from reforms examined by the<br />
Industry Commission.<br />
But what are these reforms?<br />
They fall into two groups, reforms where this Labor<br />
government has already made significant progress, and is<br />
continuing to implement change, or reforms that are<br />
primarily the responsibility of the States.<br />
According to the industry Commission's list, reforms to<br />
rail transport would have the single biggest impact on<br />
GDP at 1.5 per cent. These reforms in part involve the<br />
national freight system which is currently being<br />
transformed into a National Rail Highway as announced in<br />
One Nation. The rest of the IC's proposals centre on<br />
suburban rail which, according to the IC analysis, would<br />
be made more efficient with different pricing policies.<br />
Would Dr Hewson take over this area of State<br />
responsibility? Would he increase suburban rail fares by the 150 per cent<br />
that the proposals imply?<br />
The measure on the IC's list with the second largest<br />
impact is assistance to the rural and manufacturing<br />
sectors.<br />
most of the benefits to be had here will flow from the<br />
Government's measured reductions in protection,<br />
reductions that will leave vibrant industries at the end<br />
of the process.<br />
Dr Hewson's crude approach to the car industry, to the<br />
TCF sector or to sugar would in fact see less production<br />
in Australia, not more.<br />
in aviation, the waterfront, electricity and so on it is<br />
this Government that has built the cooperation of the<br />
parties involved so that genuine progress is achieved.<br />
15 sep 92 1c-: 19 NL) 12 P 10/ 1 </p>
<p>Business is understandably sceptical that the benefits<br />
claimed in Fightbeck can be achieved and have every right<br />
to be apprehensive about the confronitationist approach<br />
being advocated by Dr Hewson.<br />
Quite simply, Dr Hewson's claims on the benefits of his<br />
microeconomic reforms evaporate under scrutiny. They are<br />
like his claim of 2 million jobs to be Created. This<br />
claim was never modelled in Fightback and under<br />
questioning it too diminished to a " guesstimate".<br />
I said that the GST is principally about replacing a<br />
number of existing taxes with a new one.<br />
There are also the income tax cuts of $ 12 billion. These<br />
are more than accounted for by bracket creep, the<br />
increase in the company tax rate and, mainly, the cuts to<br />
outlays. These cuts cannu~ ot and will not be funded by the GST. As<br />
the tabulation earlier shows, $ 26 billion of the $ 27<br />
billion proceeds of the GST are spent abolishing other<br />
taxes and for the base compensation package. The $ 12<br />
billion of tax cuts will have to be funded by cuts in<br />
Government spending cuts that will decimate social<br />
policy. The Treasurer and Minister for Finance have pointed out<br />
there is a huge hole in Fightbeck's figuring to the tune<br />
of $ 6 billion in the year of implementation.<br />
it is a hole which removes most of the benefits Fightback<br />
is supposed to provide.<br />
The expenditure cuts that Fightback proposes deserve the<br />
highest scrutiny.<br />
Of course, many are not spelt out in any detail but rely<br />
on inroads into fraud, inefficiencies and waste.<br />
This is a noble objective indeed, it should be part of<br />
any good administration's operations but to suggest<br />
that billions of dollars can be found from such measures<br />
after the years of cutting into outlays is totally<br />
incredible.<br />
what this emphasis does demonstrate is that the savings<br />
in Fightback are shonky. In truth, if Dr Hewson is to<br />
make the real savings upon which Fightback depends, he<br />
will have to cut, into real programs.<br />
SOCTAL, SECURITY </p>
<p>12<br />
However, there are a number of areas where substantial<br />
cuts into programs are proposed up-front. These cuts,<br />
ostensibly designed to stop people rorting the social<br />
security system, would in fact seriously weaken its<br />
integrity. Government has to be vigilant against those who attempt<br />
to take advantage of the system and, indeed, through<br />
increased resources for review teams and the like, we<br />
have developed one of the most targeted systems in the<br />
world. The fact that a few may secure benefits they are not<br />
entitled to does not justify measures which seriously<br />
hurt those in genuine need.<br />
Benefits have been increased substantially for those in<br />
need. For example, pensions have been increased by over 15 per<br />
cent in real terms under this Government after falling by<br />
2 per cent under the previous Coalition Government.<br />
Unemployment benefits have been increased by over 25 per<br />
cent under Labor after falling by almost 20 per cent<br />
under the Coalition.<br />
At the same time we have greatly improved the focus of<br />
expenditure. At the ANU. Deborah Mitchell has found that while<br />
expenditure on social security in Australia as a share of<br />
GDP was the lowest of the ten OECD countries she<br />
examined, it was very successful in achieving its<br />
objective of alleviating poverty.<br />
Fightback's contempt for the low paid and the dependent<br />
ignores such conclusions.<br />
It fails to recognise that, compared with other<br />
countries, we spend a relatively modest amount on income<br />
support. It fails to recognise the success in targeting that has<br />
been achieved delivering substantial benefits for a<br />
modest national outcome.<br />
And most importantly, it does not recognise the damage<br />
the expenditure cuts it advocates would do to the system.<br />
The feature of many of the cuts to outlays is that they<br />
would hurt groups in society which are least able to<br />
avoid them.<br />
Fightback would find $ 745 million by Cutting benefits to<br />
the unemployed. TEL 15 Se p 9 2 15 1 N L-1 C, 12 F 12 I </p>

It would stop the sole parent pension when the youngest<br />
child reaches 12.<br />
it claims to find $ 127 million from cutting access to<br />
disability pensions.<br />
It would increase the pension age for women to 65. Many<br />
of these women have had no opportunity to accumulate<br />
super or other forms of retirement income and it Å 8<br />
totally unfair to suddenly introduce this measure.<br />
EQUITY CONSIDFRATTONSq<br />
All this simply reinforces the regressive nature of the<br />
GST. Prices overall will rise by 5 to 6 per cent; but the<br />
prices of those goods and services that are necessities<br />
for everyday living for the less well-off in the<br />
community will rise by much more.<br />
The great majority of OECD countries with GSTs or VATs<br />
have multi-rate systems precisely to allow food,<br />
essential services and the like to be taxed more lightly.<br />
Even John Major recently ruled out extending their VAT to<br />
zero-rated items of gas, electricity, food, and<br />
children's clothes and footwear.<br />
Dr Hewson is too pure for that. Dr Hewson is going to<br />
try rational economics properly.<br />
But increasingly, Dr Hewson is coming under pressure to<br />
exempt more items.<br />
Education services are supposed to be zero-rated, but<br />
what constitutes an education service? What books are<br />
zero-rated and which ones attract the OST? What<br />
constitutes a GST-free school lunch?<br />
Medical bills are to be zero-rated, but does this extend<br />
to wheel-chairs and sunscreens?<br />
The building, tourism and financial Industries all have<br />
legitimate concerns with their treatment under the GST.<br />
it is a system riddled with inequities.<br />
The key difference is that under wholesale taxes, we are<br />
able to effectively quarantine the great bulk of<br />
necessities fresh fruit and vegetables, electricity<br />
bills, clothes, and so on.<br />
The Liberals are not prepared to see a similar targeting<br />
under the GST because it would interfere with the ideal<br />
model in the accountant's mind.<br />
TEL </p>
<p>TEL 14<br />
And the result is that it is precisely the necessities<br />
that would face the largest hike in prices.<br />
The price on milk up 9.61;<br />
Fresh fruit up 10.1%;<br />
Electricity bills up 10.7%;<br />
Large hikes in rates, postal and telephone charges up<br />

I haven't today covered all aspects of Fightback by any<br />
means. Even though policies are frequently poorly<br />
specified, it touches a wide range of issues.<br />
And for so many of these issues, Fightback represents an<br />
enormous step backwards.<br />
Nowhere more dramatically than In policies affecting<br />
Woman. Both parties talk about opportunities and fairness for<br />
women, but only Labor has the policies and the track<br />
record. Labor introduced sex discrimination and affirmative<br />
action legislation. Labor has increased the number of<br />
child care places five-fold and provided generous fee<br />
relief. 60% of the 1.5 million jobs created since 1983<br />
have gone to women. Labor has supported a wages system<br />
that saw women's average wages increase from 67 cents to<br />
83 cents for every dollar earned by men.<br />
The Coalition cannot make the same commitments to<br />
promoting equality for women. Its enterprise bargaining<br />
system would certainly see a decline in their wages.<br />
where our aim is to give women a choice about whether or<br />
not to join the paid labour force, Dr Hewson would force<br />
many women to work.<br />
Older women would be forced to stay at their jobs longer<br />
because of Dr Hewson' a rapid phase-in of an equal pension<br />
age for women and men.<br />
Mothers would also be big losers under Dr Hewson ' s<br />
policies. The cost of child care would rise because it<br />
would be subject to the GST. 10000 women would no<br />
longer get their Family Allowances. Managing the<br />
household budget would be made infinitely more difficult<br />
as the necessities of life increase in price with the<br />
GST. 1 t, e P I I Nu i i </p>

With Fightbeck, the agenda would be pushed back on the<br />
environment, on young Australians, on education and<br />
training, on policies relating to our ethnic communities<br />
and to Aboriginals, on science, on sports, and the arts.<br />
These are issues which require detailed responses in<br />
their own right and my Ministers and I wvill be addressing<br />
them in detail in the near future.<br />
HiEALTZH I would like to finish on health policy because it ia<br />
perhaps this issue that epitomises the blind application<br />
of the ideology that underpins Fightback.<br />
Australia currently uses about 8 per cent of its<br />
resources on health. This is close to the OECD average<br />
and well below the figure in the United States of 12.8<br />
per cent.<br />
With these resources, we are able to provide a first rate<br />
health system.<br />
-Medicare provides quality care based on the principles of<br />
ef-ficiency and access for all Australians.<br />
As with any large system it benefits from the sort of<br />
periodic review and refinement that we undertook most<br />
recently in the Budget.<br />
It is a system that works and works well.<br />
The Opposition's policies would effectively destroy<br />
Medicare. The replacement would be expensive and<br />
iniquitous, an alternative introduced in the name of<br />
choice and market efficiencies.<br />
The provision of health care is not like any other good<br />
or service in Dr Hewson's economic rationalist model.<br />
The unrestrained market will not provide effective health<br />
services for everyone while keeping costs contained.<br />
In fact, Fightback would see costs soar.<br />
It would largely hand over responsibility for setting<br />
health costs to the AMA. Dr Hewson said as much<br />
explicitly to the AMA at its Council.<br />
It would do this by firstly removing incentives for<br />
doctors to bulk-bill by restricting bulk-billing to<br />
health-card holders only.<br />
At present, about 70 per cent of GP services are bulkbilled<br />
at 85 per cent of the Medicare schedule, a<br />
practice that is cost effective for the doctor and the<br />
system as a whole. </p>

Moreover, Fightback would allow gap insurance for costs<br />
up to 85 per cent of, not the Medicare schedule, but the<br />
AMA schedule, the schedule set by the doctors themselves!<br />
GPs would have little incentive other than to charge the<br />
great majority of their patients the AMA fee and, because<br />
the current AMA schedule is some 20 30 per cent above<br />
the Medicare schedule, patients would be obliged to take<br />
out private insurance to avoid hefty payments at every<br />
trip to the doctor.<br />
Without insurance, patients would be paying about half of<br />
their medical bills. And these would be the people who<br />
are currently benefiting from free health through bulkbilling.<br />
Treasury has estimated that the overall impact on<br />
household health bills would be an increase of 22.6 per<br />
cent. The higher costs would affect everyone, but the hardest<br />
hit would be those least able to afford it.<br />
Dr Hewson would provide some tax credits for private<br />
health insurance, but the amount being offered would be<br />
less than half basic medical insurance Costs, let alone<br />
supplementary cover or gap insurance.<br />
Many would simply not be able to privately insure<br />
themselves and their families.<br />
Two classes of patients would result with doctors<br />
returning to the days of taking on charity cases.<br />
Fightback's health policies would see us move towards the<br />
expensive US system where 35 million Americans have no<br />
insurance or access to services.<br />
And why does Fightback contemplate the change? Not to<br />
improve national efficiency. Not to improve social<br />
equity. Not to improve quality of medical services.<br />
The change proposed by Dr Hewson stems from his<br />
insistence that market forces be imposed on our medical<br />
system. Bulk-billing is ideological anathema.<br />
The doctors, the pathologists, the radiologists, the<br />
private hospitals all stand to benefit. The low paid,<br />
the frequent users of the system, including women and the<br />
elderly, lose. The notion that a good society is<br />
measured by the degree to which all are provided with<br />
care and the necessities of life is abandoned.<br />
Nowhere are the obsessions of Dr Hewson plainer. Nowhere<br />
is Fightback more obviously regressive.<br />
This is " rational" economics " properly" applied, </p>
