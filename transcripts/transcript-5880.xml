PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA MONDAY AUGUST 2 1982<br />
ADDRESS AT DINNER GIVEN BY THE<br />
PRIME MINISTER OF MALAYSIA<br />
I have looked forward very much to this visit and the<br />
opportunity it provides to have discussions with you<br />
and your government on international and regional<br />
developments which affect our countries' interests.<br />
This is the first time I have visited Malaysia since<br />
you became Prime Minister, and looking from Australia,<br />
I have been impressed by the determination of your<br />
government to generate national co-operation and dynamism<br />
in order to achieve economic growth and continue to build<br />
a modern progressive society.<br />
I hope that this meeting will help to strengthen the close<br />
understanding and forward looking approach which has been<br />
established between our two governments. It is clear<br />
from our talks that we have a large number of shared<br />
and complementary interests, which will ensure that we<br />
maintain the vitality of our bilateral relationship.<br />
Relations between countries are, however, founded on more<br />
than relations between governments. They are built on a<br />
mutual knowledge and understanding between -peoples.<br />
The foundations were laid long ago for an enduring and<br />
warm relationship between Australians and Malaysians.<br />
We have shared adversity and we have shared peace and<br />
growing prosperity, and our people have numerous contacts.<br />
Thousands of young Malaysians come to Australia and we like<br />
to feel that through these contacts, Australia and Malaysia<br />
are working together to develop skills which are needed<br />
to sustain long term economic growth and cope with a<br />
continuously changing world. We place particular value<br />
on this aspect of our relationship, and look forward to<br />
maintaining it. N </p>

our defence co-operation arrangements represent a common<br />
commitment to the security of our region, and have<br />
contributed to its stability. These varied ties have been<br />
strengthened by economic links which have grown as our<br />
two economies have prospered. Our bilateral trade grew<br />
by an average of 20% per annum between 1975/ 76 and 1980 / 81,<br />
and there is now considerable Australian investment in<br />
Malaysia, and Malaysian investment in Australia.<br />
itically, Malaysia's role as our ASEAN contact partner<br />
been especially important in our evolving and healthy<br />
t tionships with ASEAN. Of course our political, defence<br />
rade I relationships are very important for a number of<br />
\ gic and economic reasons, but the greatest value of<br />
iese conLacts is their role in creating mutual<br />
dge and understanding, which guarantees our close<br />
I. ationship in the future.<br />
The world has experienced great strains both politically<br />
and economically over the last few years. The world economy<br />
is now going through a prolonged recession, a recession<br />
which is having a detrimental impact on both our economies.<br />
I understand that despite the impressive economic growth<br />
which Malaysia has achieved, the world recession is posing<br />
difficulties for your economy. Falling export markets and<br />
commodity prices in particular will no doubt prove a hindrance<br />
to your expanding economy and your successful plans for economic<br />
diversification. Australia has also had comparatively high economic growth in<br />
recent years, but as a major trading nation we are heavily<br />
dependent on exports for our economic growth, and we are<br />
now seriously affected by world recession. This world<br />
situation has been compounded as countries have tried<br />
to protect them-selves by increasing protectionist devices<br />
and export subsidies. These measures are depressing world<br />
trade, and together with falling commodity prices, contributed<br />
to a contraction in world trade in value terms last year<br />
for the first time in over 20 years.<br />
Some economists have been predicting that the world economy<br />
will recover in six months time. They have been saying this<br />
for years, and each six months has seen the situation become<br />
more serious. I believe that the world cannot afford to just<br />
sit back and do nothing, and I also believe that moves to take<br />
effective action need not just be the prerogative of the big<br />
powers. Many of us were disappointed that the recent Versailles<br />
Summit failed to act with the vigor or vision which could<br />
achieve the kind of economic breakthrough which we all want<br />
so much. T 7711T </p>
<p>-3-<br />
For our part, Australia has advanced a concrete multilateral<br />
proposal which, if implemented, would assist in restoring<br />
stability and confidence to the world economy. We have called<br />
for a freeze on increases in levels of protection, followed<br />
by negotiations designed to lower protection, and a phasing<br />
out over five years of export subsidies. These proposals have<br />
been well received by the international community. No country<br />
could adopt them unilaterally, no country would find it easy<br />
to adopt every part of them, but if countries would act in<br />
concert to implement these proposals or something like them,<br />
we would all benefit enormously.<br />
The rising tide of world protectionism is making it very<br />
hard to make progress on North-South issues and to provide<br />
greater economic opportunities to countries in the developing<br />
r world, many of which, like Malaysia and Australia, are raw<br />
material suppliers.<br />
Australia has given a very high priority to the North-South<br />
dialogue. Like Malaysia, we endorse the need for global<br />
negotiations on international economic development issues,<br />
and are disappointed that there has as yet been no agreement<br />
on launching the negotiations.. But even this failure should<br />
not prevent progress in specific negotiations on North-South<br />
issues at the GATT Ministerial Meeting in November, UNCTAD<br />
VI next year and the forthcoming meetings of the major<br />
international financial institutions.<br />
I have been disappointed that not all countries have been<br />
prepared to support the draft Law of the Sea Convention.<br />
If implemented it would be beneficial not only to developing<br />
countries but to the whole international community. I hope<br />
those who are not so far committed to the convention will<br />
modify their views in the interests of all of us. But instability<br />
and uncertainty are not just confined to the economic sphere.<br />
Armed conflict has become so widespread that practically no<br />
region of the world is free from war, repression, armed<br />
insurgency or terrorism, and we have recently been reminded<br />
by the wars between Iran and Iraq and in the South Atlantic<br />
of how armed conflicts can erupt quite unpredictably.<br />
International tension has been exacerbated by the expansionist<br />
objectives and destabilising influence of the Soviet Union.<br />
The Australian Government supports strongly President Reagan's<br />
determination to deal with the Soviet Union from a position<br />
of strength, for the Soviet Union in its international dealings<br />
has no respect for weakness. John F. Kennedy put the argument<br />
aptly when he said " let us never negotiate out of fear".<br />
Importantly, Kennedy added to this statement the words:<br />
" But never let us fear to negotiate". We welcome the decision<br />
of the Soviet Union and the United States to begin arms<br />
reduction talks, but these talks will achieve nothing unless<br />
the Soviet Union is convinced of American and Western<br />
determination to counter Soviet aggression and rearmament<br />
in every instance. i, 7 </p>

Mr Prime Minister, the Australian people have been very<br />
conscious of the challenge posed by the continued Vietnamese<br />
occupation of Cambodia. The crisis in Cambodia is a human<br />
tragedy of appalling proportions. The Khmer people have<br />
distinctive culture and nationalism, and the current state<br />
of affairs in Cambodia should not continue.<br />
The role the ASEAN partners have played to put pressure on<br />
Vietnam to restore Cambodia as an independent and non-aligned<br />
state has won widespread international support. Australia<br />
has supported ASEAN resolutions on Cambodia put forward at<br />
United Nations general assemblies, and the work of the<br />
international conference on Cambodial-and we share your<br />
hope tha'it the recent formation of a tripartite coalition<br />
of anti-Vietnamese Khmer groups will contribute positively<br />
to a settlement of this issue.<br />
The Australian Government will continue to give active<br />
support to humanitarian relief measures and to play a full<br />
part in developing solutions to the refugee problem.<br />
Mr Prime Minister, the attention of the whole world has<br />
been caught by the constructive role that ASEAN is playing<br />
in the region, its considerable economic achievements, and<br />
its enormous contribution to regional stability.<br />
It is thanks partly toASEAN that our region has become one<br />
of the most stable and prosperous in the world. ASEAN is also<br />
setting an important example to the wider Pacific region.<br />
Many new countries have emerged in the Pacific and they face<br />
daunting challenges of limited resources and vast distances.<br />
The Pacific governments are now playing an active part in<br />
broadening their international relationships and working<br />
more closely together with the region as a whole.<br />
I know your visit to Fiji, Tonga and Western Samoa recently<br />
was greatly-valued, as were the offers of technical co-operation<br />
which you conveyed to the South Pacific countries. In a few<br />
days I will be attending the meeting of the Heads of Government<br />
of the South Pacific Forum in Rotorua where matters of direct<br />
and practical interest to the Pacific governments will be<br />
* discussed. A South Pacific country, Fiji, will be host in October to<br />
the meeting of Commonwealth Regional Heads of Government.<br />
which will discuss a number of major economic and political<br />
issues of concern to our region. We see these regional<br />
meetings as an example of how the Commonwealth has modernised<br />
and kept pace with the needs of the international community.<br />
The Commonwealth as a whole still represents a unique<br />
forum for bringing together for the common good countries<br />
from all over the world and from a number of different<br />
cultures and political systems. Its success as the instrument<br />
which brought a settlement in Zimbabwe, and its work on a range<br />
of North-South issues, are examples of how the Commonwealth<br />
can have real, practical significance.<br />
' J </p>
<p>Mr Prime Minister, I have mentioned just some of the wide<br />
range of common interestL.-s, political economical and strategic<br />
which our two countries have. our close relationship is<br />
going to help us contend with the difficulties and challenges<br />
before our region and before the world.<br />
If, Mr Prime Minister, my own visit and our discussions<br />
have added further to our ties which are a part of history,<br />
I shall be very pleased.<br />
May I thank you and your Ministers for the hospitality<br />
and generous courtesy which you have given me and my party in<br />
this visit. The mutual and co-operative spirit which<br />
manifests here in abundance wvill be for me an endluring<br />
memory. In recognition of this spirit of mutual co-operation,<br />
I now have the honour to propose a toast to the Right Honourable<br />
the Prime Minister of Malaysia, Data' Seri Dr. Maliathir and<br />
Datin Seri Dr. Siti Hasmah. A C </p>
