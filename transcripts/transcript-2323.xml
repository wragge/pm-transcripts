    <content><![CDATA[<p>FOR PRESS: PM No. 109/ 1970<br />DEATH CF GENERAL DE GAULLE<br />Comment by the Prime Minister, Mr. John Gorton<br />President de Gaulle was one of the outstanding figures of<br />contemporary history.<br />When his country was overrun he refused to surrender and<br />continued the fight from abroad. At first he was almost alone, but<br />Frenchmen rallied to him and wearing the Cross of Lorraine he made<br />tt. Free French Forces a factor in the fight against Nazism.<br />After the War he played a leading role in France and in<br />post-war Europe, always dominated by almost mystical devotion to<br />France. His physical and moral courage, his devotion to an ideal,<br />his embodiment at times of the spirit of a nation marked him as a<br />great man. We extend our sympathy to France at his death. and we<br />will all feel a little the poorer.<br />CANBERRA 11 November 1970</p>
