DINNER IN HONOUR OF RABBI DR. H. Mo SANGER<br />
ON THE OCCASION OF THE 25TH ANNIVERSARY<br />
OF HIS MINISTRY IN AUSTRALIA<br />
Held at Melbourne on 12th November_ 19621<br />
Speech by the Prime Minister. the Rt. Hon. RG. Menzies<br />
Sir, Rabbi Sanger and Ladies and Gentlemen<br />
I wonder if I might begin by paying a small<br />
tribute to Mrs. Phillips, ( Applause) I have been informed<br />
by reputable people at this table that she is now 100 years<br />
old. Looking at her, I don't believe it, ( Laughter) If<br />
it turns out to be true, then I think the one error made<br />
tonight was that you should have compromised all your ideas<br />
and had a Scottish pipe band to play " A Hundred Pipers and<br />
a and a ( Applause) o<br />
Sir when I agreed to come here, that wasn't a<br />
matter of great difficulty because at least twice I have been<br />
to Alma Road and I have made a speech and then I have sat<br />
down and then I have listened to Rabbi Sanger without<br />
discourtesy explaining to me by his own speech how a speech<br />
ought to be made. ( Laughter) And I have become his very<br />
warm admirer and I needed very little persuasion none in<br />
fact to come here tonight,<br />
But having agreed that I would come, I of course<br />
had to do my homeworko They sent me printed material<br />
yes, I read my brief ( Laughter) I read a panegyric about<br />
Rabbi Sanger which explained that he was sometimes impatient<br />
this this oo. o and this and this and up to that point,<br />
I said, " Dear me, how like me e is." ( Laughter) ( Applause)<br />
But among other things that I was introduced to<br />
was the fact that just as there is regrettable distinction<br />
between the Church of England and the Church of Scotland and<br />
the Congregationalists and the Methodists a conflict in<br />
which the Presbyterians are invariably and inevitably right<br />
( Laughter) so there are distinctions of a somewhat theological<br />
kind between the Orthodox and the Liberal congregations of<br />
your faith. Having read that, I realised, as my friend Mr.<br />
Calwell who is here tonight would at once agree, that I am<br />
the perfect nominee for this position because I am both<br />
orthodox and liber,: al. ( Applau-se)<br />
So it is not just a chance medley that brings<br />
together, on this occasion to celebrate twentyfive years of<br />
magnificent religious and commu. nity service, representatives<br />
of a great variety of churches, representatives of utterly<br />
conflicting political ideas this i! not a chance, not at<br />
allo This is one of the occasions which demonstrates that<br />
there are certain qualities of the heart and the mind and the<br />
spirit that override all boundaries, ( Applause) In fact,<br />
without detaining you overlong, I vouild just like to put three<br />
questions about Rabbi Sanger. Three questions, and I would<br />
like to answer them myself You Irow there is a great<br />
advantage in life in putting th, questions yourself and<br />
answering them yourselfo It was one chat I invariably denied<br />
the witnesses when I was Mtaurice Ashkanasy's tutor at the Bar,<br />
but I would like to concede it to myself tonight.<br />
Has Dr, Sanger added to our civil. isation?<br />
Civilisation being in our hearts and our minds has very little<br />
EoB00 ooo. / 2 </p>
<p>to do with aircraft or television sets or all the mechanical<br />
-triumphis of our century, Civilisation is in thie heart and the<br />
mind. Has he added to it? And the answer must be<br />
For twontyfive years he) h. as made, a contribution to it as great<br />
as that4 of any other man in this city., ( Applause)<br />
And my second question is: " Has hemade us understand<br />
each oth'-er better?" At this point, I wou: ld like to say this:<br />
Here I ami, a singularly unbigoted man of Seats descent, a<br />
singularly unbigoted Presbyterian ( Laugb. ter),, a singularly<br />
unbigoted Liberal ( Laugiter), a singulirly iinbi~ go-ted supporter<br />
of Carlton in the football ( Lau liter), a singularly unbigoted<br />
whatever you may care to say,, ( LaugLiter) But, Sir, I hiave<br />
been -troubled not for a year, but for a fe-w years by the<br />
feeling that there are still people -vwhIo think that there is<br />
so0me bigotry in Australia about people oUteJws faith.<br />
Now I bag of' everybody to foAa t Frget it,, All chips<br />
. must come of~ f all shoculders on tGhis Ymatte--r0 This is too<br />
foolish0i Too foolish This country ha, s been too enrichaed by<br />
the contribution of people of theo Jew-ish faith to be living<br />
in a dead age on those matters, country is -too conscious<br />
of the hideous consoquences in th-e Old 1Tkrld of such bigotries<br />
and hatreds and prejudiCes, I b.-eg of you and I s0y this for<br />
oery man in; every pa: rliament in the Com~ monwealth of Austra lia:<br />
forget about it,, Forget about % L-ot us understand each other<br />
better, There is no reason wiiTv we should not, We arc all. the<br />
same people, 14e live in a lovely country. We all have friends<br />
from here a-, d he_-re and heira and I 1wiant -to say about ocir guest<br />
of honour tonight -that no mran hias done more then he has to get<br />
