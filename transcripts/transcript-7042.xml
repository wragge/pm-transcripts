PRIME MINISTER<br />
EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY<br />
GOVERNMENT RECEPTION<br />
PARLIAMENT HOUSE, CANBERRA -24 NOVEMBER 1986<br />
Your Holiness, Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen.<br />
it gives me great pleasure to welcome you to our Parliament<br />
House. Your Holiness, the Australian Government and people, and<br />
most especially those of Catholic faith, have long looked<br />
forward to your visiting our country as Pope John Paul II.<br />
We know of course that you visited Australia in 1973 as a<br />
Cardinal for the International Eucharistic Congress. But it<br />
is a particular honour for us now that you have come, in<br />
response to the invitations of the Government and the<br />
Australian Catholic Bishops, for a longer, more intensive<br />
visit. As the head of the Roman Catholic Church, you will receive a<br />
particularly warm welcome from Australia's large Catholic<br />
community. Catholics have had an enormous and enriching influence on<br />
the culture and politics of this country.<br />
They made their presence felt here from the beginning of<br />
European settlement, particularly through the Irish<br />
community. The successful struggle of Irish Australians to<br />
have themselves and the Catholic faith recognised as equals<br />
in our society, and their determination not to stand apart<br />
from the rest of the community, were major factors in<br />
shaping our history.<br />
In more recent times, Catholics from Italy, Malta, the<br />
Netherlands, the Spanish-speaking world, Vietnam and other<br />
countries have enhanced the richness and diversity of our<br />
country0<br />
And on this occasion, Your Holiness, it would be highly<br />
remiss of me to-fail to acknowledge our Polish community,<br />
which while maintaining close links with its native country,<br />
has made a distinctive and important contribution to<br />
Australian life.<br />
F </p>
<p>The Roman Catholic Church in Australia has made and<br />
continues to play a vital role in the care of our sick and<br />
our aged and our orphans and in the education of generations<br />
of Australian youth.<br />
One of the abiding issues in the development of Australian<br />
education has been the division of responsibility between<br />
Church and State. My Government is particularly proud of<br />
the level of understanding which has been reached between<br />
the Government and non-government education sectors on the<br />
key issue of funding. The result is a new confidence and<br />
cooperative spirit between the major providers of education<br />
in this country.<br />
In the Parliament, Catholics have made their mark on both<br />
sides of politics at the highest level. It is without any<br />
sense of political partisanship that I point with pride to<br />
the strong and enduring historical links between the<br />
Australian Catholic community and the Australian Labor<br />
Party. As for our nation's intellectual life, it has been greatly<br />
enriched by a glittering vein of Catholic artists, thinkers<br />
and educators Max Charlesworth, Mary and Elizabeth Durack,<br />
Margaret Manion, Lee Murray, Patrick Moran, Patrick<br />
O'Farrell, George Zubrzycki to name but a few.<br />
Nor is it possible adequately to describe the role of the<br />
Catholic Church in this country without recalling some of<br />
the enduring names of the Church, men and women who have<br />
been great church leaders as well as great Australians.<br />
I think in particular of Mother Mary McKillop, and<br />
Australia's three native-born Cardinals, Cardinals Gilroy,<br />
Knox and Freeman.<br />
Your Holiness, I make these brief remarks about the Catholic<br />
contribution to our society in order to help explain one of<br />
the most important factors making for stability and social<br />
well-being in Australia that is the way in which, perhaps<br />
more than any comparable country, we have overcome and left<br />
behind religious sectarianism. Whatever their faith and<br />
background, Australians have shown a remarkable capacity to<br />
create a harmonious, plural and multicultural society.<br />
Your Holiness, we know that one of the principal concerns of<br />
your papacy has been the dignity of work and the entitlement<br />
of people to meaningful employment and to effective trade<br />
unionism. This Government wholeheartedly endorses these<br />
sentiments. The search for ways of expanding the<br />
participation in work, particularly for young Australians,<br />
is one of the great tasks of Government in this country and<br />
one to which we are devoting much of our time and resources.<br />
If we turn to international affairs, we see again that the<br />
Roman Catholic Church under the leadership of Your Holiness<br />
has made a distinctive contribution to world affairs. The<br />
Government and people of Australia share your commitment to<br />
the cause of peace, religious freedom, development and human<br />
rights. </p>
<p>I believe that Your Holiness' visits to our country, and to<br />
so many other countries throughout the world since you<br />
assumed the papacy 8 years ago, have helped to stimulate<br />
efforts towards ensuring a safer and more harmonious world.<br />
Australia has welcomed your initiatives towards peace and<br />
your call for mutual and effective disarmament. Your<br />
efforts in this regard have been specially highlighted in<br />
this the International Year of Peace. For its part, the<br />
Government is doing all in its power to encourage progress<br />
towards balanced and verifiable nuclear disarmament and has<br />
given the International Year of Peace special prominence in<br />
this country.<br />
Let me also say, Your Holiness, how pleased we are that you<br />
are about to participate in a candle-lighting ceremony here<br />
which will symbolise your personal commitment to peace in<br />
the world.<br />
We have, as a Government, maintained close contact with the<br />
Holy See on developments of importance to us in our region<br />
and appreciate the constructive role the Catholic Church has<br />
played, especially in the human rights area, in the<br />
Philippines and elsewhere.<br />
And we have noted the important part the Catholic Bishops,<br />
along with the Council of Churches, continue to play in<br />
attempting to persuade the South African Government to<br />
dismantle its abhorrent system of apartheid and in seeking<br />
dialogue amiong the different racial groups.<br />
Your personal efforts towards international understanding<br />
and co-operation, and your advocacy of the dignity of the<br />
human person and of freedom of worship, have won the<br />
admiration of Australians and have inspired people the world<br />
over not to abandon their faith in those ideals.<br />
Your Holiness, in the next 6 days you will visit each of the<br />
States and the Northern Territory. We are indeed pleased<br />
that you will see so much of our country and that you will<br />
have the opportunity to make contact with large numbers of<br />
Australians, in many different walks of life.<br />
And since you have also been a forceful advocate for the<br />
rights of indigenous peoples in the countries you have<br />
visited, we are pleased that you are taking the opportunity<br />
to visit some of Australia's Aboriginal people. we know<br />
that your meeting with them will be a memorable and<br />
uplifting event as indeed it will be throughout the entire<br />
Australian community, and for all Australians.<br />
I invite the Leader of the Opposition, Mir John Howard, to<br />
support my remarks. </p>
