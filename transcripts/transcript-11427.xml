    <content><![CDATA[<p>E&amp;OE...................................................................................................</p>
<p>Well, thank you very much, Tony; to John Anderson, Peter Costello,</p>
<p> Shane Stone, my other fellow Liberals, ladies and gentlemen.</p>
<p>I want, at the beginning of my speech, to again express, as I did</p>
<p> last night, my admiration and affection for Tony Staley for the work</p>
<p> that he's done as Federal President and the leadership that he's</p>
<p> given to the Party organisation over six very important years which</p>
<p> oversaw our transition from the desolation of Opposition to a second</p>
<p> term in government.</p>
<p>I also want, on your behalf and on my own personal behalf, to welcome</p>
<p> and congratulate Shane Stone as the new Federal President of the Party.</p>
<p> Shane and I have had a very long association. I respect him. I like</p>
<p> him a lot. I think it's very good that the Party will have a</p>
<p> national President from Darwin. I think it emphasises the breadth</p>
<p> of the representation of this Party, that we are, indeed, a Party</p>
<p> for all Australians and all parts of Australia and I think that sends</p>
<p> a very strong signal and I know he'll be a very effective and</p>
<p> a very strong President.</p>
<p>To you, John, I'm delighted that it's been possible for</p>
<p> you to come here this morning and to say a few words as the man who</p>
<p> on the 20th of July will become the Deputy Prime Minister</p>
<p> of Australia. I remember that night very well. They were pretty despairing</p>
<p> days. I think Ralph and I retired to the comfort of his Glenlivet</p>
<p> after that discussion that we'd had. But you and I have had a</p>
<p> very close association, first in Opposition and more recently in government.</p>
<p> I admire your strength of character, your decency, your identification</p>
<p> of the mainstream values of the Australian community and the tenacity</p>
<p> of your concern for the people who live in the bush of Australia.</p>
<p> And you will be a very worthy and successful successor to a man who</p>
<p> I grew very fond of, Tim Fischer, in the years that we served together.</p>
<p>I've said before and I say it again this morning that you could</p>
<p> have no better mate in a political trench than Tim Fischer. And he</p>
<p> was a stoic supporter of the Coalition through good times and bad.</p>
<p> And I say to a Liberal gathering such as this that when you have a</p>
<p> Coalition of two parties where one has an overwhelming preponderance</p>
<p> of numbers it's always a bit tough when you're the leader</p>
<p> or the deputy leader of the smaller partner in that coalition. On</p>
<p> the one hand you've got to achieve the common good, on the other</p>
<p> hand you've got to remember that you lead a separate political</p>
<p> organisation. And Tim and John were able to combine those two needs</p>
<p> to the national good in a remarkably successful way. And I'm</p>
<p> absolutely certain that John and Mark Vaile will be able to continue</p>
<p> that good work because we all know from our experience of the last</p>
<p> 20 years that division between coalition parties leads to desolation</p>
<p> and defeat and despair, whereas unity produces success and years in</p>
<p> government. And that has been our long experience since 1949 and it</p>
<p> is our experience today. And the fact that we were re-elected in 1998</p>
<p> was in no small measure due to the fact that we had a strong coalition</p>
<p> between the Liberal and the National parties of Australia.</p>
<p>My friends, we meet at this Federal Council Meeting at the end of</p>
<p> a remarkable two-week period in Australian politics. It is a period</p>
<p> in which we have achieved many of our policy objectives. It is a period</p>
<p> in which we have done things and achieved goals and won gains for</p>
<p> the people of Australia that many people doubted that we would do.</p>
<p> But we meet this morning not in any sense of triumphalism or smugness</p>
<p> of complacency, we meet rather with a quiet sense of pride and achievement</p>
<p> that we have achieved a lot but also recognising that soberly and</p>
<p> realistically we have much more to achieve because the responsibility</p>
<p> of government is an ongoing one. You never reach the top of the hill</p>
<p> in politics. There is always another mountain to scale. There is always</p>
<p> another goal or another objective to achieve. And so it is, as we</p>
<p> meet here at this Federal Council Meeting and reflect just for a moment</p>
<p> on what's been achieved in the three and a bit years of government</p>
<p> and particularly since the re-election in 1998, it is appropriate</p>
<p> after reflecting just for a moment on that to move on to what is ahead,</p>
<p> to have a look at the new peaks that we need to scale and the new</p>
<p> achievements that we need to embrace.</p>
<p>And in doing that we should always remember the character of the Liberal</p>
<p> Party of Australia. Unique almost amongst centre-right parties in</p>
<p> the democratic world, the Liberal Party of Australia is the trustee</p>
<p> of two great traditions within Australian politics and Australian</p>
<p> public life and debate. It is the trustee of both the conservative</p>
<p> tradition and the Liberal tradition. It is not exclusively a conservative</p>
<p> party nor is it exclusively a liberal party in the classical sense</p>
<p> of the word. It is the party of Edmund Burke as much as it is the</p>
<p> party of John Stuart Mill. And our capacity to blend and respect and</p>
<p> to nurture and to promote those two great traditions in the Australian</p>
<p> political experiences is the fundamental ingredient of our success.</p>
<p> And in recent times I have sought to define the philosophical framework</p>
<p> of the Government I lead by speaking of our commitment to economic</p>
<p> liberalisation and what I describe in social policy as a modern conservatism.</p>
<p> It is a party that values and respects the wisdom of dispersed power</p>
<p> in a large country through a federation of states. It is a party that</p>
<p> continues to value and support the family unit as the enduring and</p>
<p> most cohesive section and institution of our society. But it is also</p>
<p> the party that has searched the fundamental liberty of the individual</p>
<p> through espousal of support of such things as recently voluntary student</p>
<p> unionism. A commitment that nourishes our long-held belief that men</p>
<p> and women in a free society should have the right to choose or whether</p>
<p> or not to join an organisation.</p>
<p>I've spoken recently of I guess the way in which political debate</p>
<p> has evolved over the last decade or two of how we went through a period</p>
<p> all around the world of believing that every problem could be solved</p>
<p> by massive government intervention. The Americans tried it through</p>
<p> Lyndon Johnson's "great society", Labor tried it through</p>
<p> Gough Whitlam's disastrous three years as Prime Minister of Australia.</p>
<p> And then we moved perhaps in reaction to a period in our history of</p>
<p> where some believed that the market solved every single thing. Now</p>
<p> I remain of the view that in economic matters the market solution</p>
<p> is the preferred solution but sometimes other solutions are needed</p>
<p> as well. And I think we have developed in this country what I can</p>
<p> best described as the Australian way of addressing of many of our</p>
<p> social and economic issues. It is a way that seeks to marshal the</p>
<p> combined efforts of the Government, of the individual, of the business</p>
<p> community and those great volunteer organisations within our society</p>
<p> that know so much about human suffering and human need within our</p>
<p> community. I've spoken often of the social coalition that I seek</p>
<p> to build between those four great expressions of Australian decency</p>
<p> and Australian society. And that social coalition is providing new</p>
<p> ways and new opportunities in areas such as the fight against drug</p>
<p> abuse, the fight against homelessness amongst young people within</p>
<p> our community and the fight to obtain modern contemporary solutions</p>
<p> to other social challenges. And I think we are finding an Australian</p>
<p> way, we are finding a way that draws upon the talents and the contributions</p>
<p> that those different sections of Australian society can make.</p>
<p>As you all know, and it does bear repeating of course, at a gathering</p>
<p> such as this, the economic fundamentals of Australia now are stronger</p>
<p> than they have been at any time over the last thirty years. It is</p>
<p> no idle boast to say that Australia stared down, beyond the expectations</p>
<p> of most, the Asian economic downturn. When I became Prime Minister</p>
<p> of Australia I felt as though this country was an anxious outsider</p>
<p> seeking admission to the rich man's club of Asia, but over the</p>
<p> last three-and-a-quarter years that perception has changed. Australia</p>
<p> is seen with new respect, held in new regard and listened to with</p>
<p> greater intensity as a result of our economic performance and I particularly</p>
<p> want to pay tribute to Peter Costello, the Treasurer and Deputy Leader,</p>
<p> for his role in relation to our very successful economic management</p>
<p> over the last three-and-a-quarter years.</p>
<p>Our objective at all times has not been to achieve reform for reform's</p>
<p> sake. Over the last three-and-a-half years in seeking to reform the</p>
<p> Australian economy we have not been engaged on some ideological binge.</p>
<p> We have not sought to give us some kind of doctrinaire ideological</p>
<p> ticks in particular boxes and to say that is a particular ideological</p>
<p> objective that we have achieved. The sole and unambiguous purpose</p>
<p> of our economic reforms has been to make the Australian economy more</p>
<p> competitive and as a consequence generate more jobs for Australians</p>
<p> Â particularly young Australians Â and generate higher living</p>
<p> standards for all Australians. And that remains, as we look beyond</p>
<p> the goods and services tax, that remains the objective of our economic</p>
<p> policies and our economic reforms. And as we look beyond the goods</p>
<p> and services tax and as we examined what next must be done to secure</p>
<p> that more competitive Australian economy we must remember the sort</p>
<p> of world in which we live. We must understand the extent to which</p>
<p> it is has been transformed by information technology. We now live</p>
<p> essentially in a borderless international economy where seamless capital</p>
<p> flows are fast being matched by seamless flows of job opportunities.</p>
<p> And the enduring fundamental of that new world in which we live is</p>
<p> that if we are not competitive we will fall behind. And it is no good</p>
<p> any Australian leader or politician saying "we are doing better</p>
<p> now than we were doing twenty or thirty years ago" unless we</p>
<p> can confidently say that we are doing better now than our rivals are</p>
<p> doing now. And it is a never-ending race, and if you fall behind you</p>
<p> lose market share, you lose competitiveness and you lose jobs.</p>
<p>And so it is as we move on from the goods and services tax and we</p>
<p> examine what our responses will be to such things as business taxation</p>
<p> reform. We have to have in mind the need at all times to make this</p>
<p> country international competitive. We have to ask ourselves whether</p>
<p> it is as attractive to invest in Australia as it is in the United</p>
<p> States or one of the other strong economies of the world. It is not</p>
<p> enough to say well it's more attractive now than it was thirty</p>
<p> years ago, that's irrelevant except in terms of political and</p>
<p> historical comparison because the world has changed forever. We can</p>
<p> never go back to the old cloistered days where you could put a wall</p>
<p> around the Australian economy and keep people out and just enjoy a</p>
<p> comfortable cloistered living standard within our own borders. That</p>
<p> has gone forever. And one of the difficult challenges of modern government</p>
<p> is to turn the undoubted advantages of globalisation to the overall</p>
<p> good of the community. And it's our responsibility as sensible</p>
<p> and sensitive politicians to understand that there are communities</p>
<p> in Australia that get left behind by globalisation. We have to understand</p>
<p> their anguish, we have to share their concern, we have to identify</p>
<p> with their difficulties and we have to provide them with responses</p>
<p> to the dilemma that is presented by that globalisation. And there</p>
<p> is always the threat of aberrant ideologies and philosophies in a</p>
<p> climate such as that. And that lay behind much of the challenge that</p>
<p> was so successfully defeated in the bush by John Anderson and Tim</p>
<p> Fischer at the last election.</p>
<p>But as we look ahead we think particularly as a country on those areas</p>
<p> of economic performance that we do best. We must, in the years ahead,</p>
<p> build on our natural strengths. We, of course, must continue to support</p>
<p> the great performers of the past Â our mining industry, our farming</p>
<p> industries, our innovative manufacturers. We will continue, for decades</p>
<p> into the future, to be heavily reliant on export income from the farm</p>
<p> sector and from the mining sector. And nothing that the Government</p>
<p> I lead will do will ever take away the competitiveness of the Australian</p>
<p> mining industry or the Australian agricultural industry because both</p>
<p> of them have been bedrock and necessary to our economic success and</p>
<p> our economic achievement. But as we go into the next century there</p>
<p> are areas of the Australian economy that we can effectively build</p>
<p> on and exploit to the long-term, national good.</p>
<p>As a community, if we examine our history, we have always been a people</p>
<p> who have been particularly inventive. We have always been a nation</p>
<p> of great ideas. We have given to the world inventions and ideas and</p>
<p> concepts way beyond our population. And therein, I believe, as we</p>
<p> look to the next century, lies a great area of opportunity. So often</p>
<p> the story of Australia has been we get a great idea but we lose it</p>
<p> in the process of commercialisation.</p>
<p>We think of such things as Memtech and many others where an idea has</p>
<p> been successfully developed in Australia yet it has been commercialised</p>
<p> and, therefore, the economic benefit from it has been derived by others</p>
<p> and derived overseas. And it ought to be one of the challenges of</p>
<p> economic policy making in this country in the years ahead that we</p>
<p> reverse that process. That we not only continue to have great ideas</p>
<p> but we also convert them to commercial reality and commercial profit</p>
<p> to the benefit of Australia and to the benefit of Australians.</p>
<p>And, therefore, as we examine not only our taxation system but we</p>
<p> also examine all the other aspects of economic policy that bear on</p>
<p> the competitiveness of this country we ought to seek in the decisions</p>
<p> we take not only to have a clever country, not only to have a lucky</p>
<p> country - because you can have a clever country but not get the full</p>
<p> benefit of it, you can be a lucky country but not get the full benefit</p>
<p> of that - but I hope in the years ahead we can also become a Âcan</p>
<p> do' country. A country that can convert to its national benefit</p>
<p> the ideas that our citizens generate, a country that can convert its</p>
<p> luck and its cleverness to a long-term, national advantage. Because</p>
<p> the history of nations through the 20th Century has been</p>
<p> that the greatest success has not gone necessarily to those countries</p>
<p> that have had all the inventions and all the ideas but rather it has</p>
<p> gone to those countries that have had the capacity to convert those</p>
<p> ideas and those inventions to commercial reality and commercial success.</p>
<p>And it's that kind of thinking that will instruct our examination</p>
<p> of something such as the capital gains tax as we get the business</p>
<p> tax recommendations from John Ralph's committee. It is that consideration</p>
<p> which is driving my strong commitment to making Australia a financial</p>
<p> centre for the world and not just for our region. It is my belief</p>
<p> that with our combination of strong economic performance, good corporate</p>
<p> governance, very, very strong and prudentially regulated banks, a</p>
<p> very strong legal system, a stable community both socially and politically,</p>
<p> that we have an unrivalled capacity to build this nation into a world</p>
<p> financial centre.</p>
<p>But as we go down that path we must also remember that not only do</p>
<p> you win international competitiveness by such things as taxation reform</p>
<p> but you also win international competitiveness by continuing the crusade</p>
<p> within Australia for further reform of those institutions and those</p>
<p> practises which in the past have contributed to our uncompetitiveness.</p>
<p>One of the remarkable elements of the Australian economic success</p>
<p> story of the last three-and-a-quarter years has been the way in which</p>
<p> we have lifted the productivity of the Australian workforce. Not only</p>
<p> are we as Liberals able to say to the workers of Australia, we have</p>
<p> cut your monthly interest bill by an average of $320, but we are also</p>
<p> able to say to those same workers, we have boosted the level of your</p>
<p> real wages. And we have done so against the background against two</p>
<p> other great achievements and that is a record of industrial disputation</p>
<p> which is the lowest for more than 75 years. So much for Bill Kelty's</p>
<p> sonata, let alone the symphony. The reality is that this Government,</p>
<p> this Coalition Government has given to the industrial landscape of</p>
<p> Australia an unparalleled level of industrial peace. But we have also</p>
<p> done it against the background of generating some $400,000 jobs in</p>
<p> the three-and-a-quarter years that we have been in government. We've</p>
<p> brought unemployment down to a 10-year low. It's a 20-year low</p>
<p> so far as teenagers looking for full-time jobs but it is still far</p>
<p> too high.</p>
<p>And we have achieved reforms in difficult areas such as the Australian</p>
<p> waterfront that many people doubted were possible. And the courage</p>
<p> that was displayed by Peter Reith and others in arguing for and prosecuting</p>
<p> the case for reform of the Australian waterfront I know is widely</p>
<p> respected within the Liberal Party community. But, ladies and gentlemen,</p>
<p> more has to be done on that front. It's a never-ending process</p>
<p> of turning around what was really an arthritic labour market system</p>
<p> into one that can accommodate the demands of an Australian workforce</p>
<p> in a borderless economic world. Because we built an industrial relations</p>
<p> system behind a tariff wall when most workers were men, most of them</p>
<p> were in blue-collar occupations and most of them worked in large aggregations</p>
<p> and answered to a boss in a very hierarchical workplace structure.</p>
<p> That was the background against which the industrial relations system</p>
<p> essentially that we inherited three-and-a-quarter years ago was built.</p>
<p> And when you think about that against the modern world you understand</p>
<p> instantaneously how absolutely essential it is that we change and</p>
<p> we continue to change.</p>
<p>My friends, there are just two other things that I want to mention.</p>
<p> And that is that in all the years that I've been a member of</p>
<p> the Liberal Party and all the years that I've been in Parliament</p>
<p> a very important part of the sense of being of the Liberal Party has</p>
<p> been our capacity as a political movement to articulate the broad</p>
<p> national interest in terms of our national security. In many of my</p>
<p> early years in the Liberal Party much of our debating time was spent</p>
<p> talking about issues of national security. And they, of course, were</p>
<p> the days of the Cold War when the divide between Soviet Russia and</p>
<p> the west, led by the United States, defined not only international</p>
<p> political debate but also much of domestic political debate. And that</p>
<p> divide, of course, probably did more than any other single thing to</p>
<p> lead to the great division within the Australian Labor Party in the</p>
<p> 1950s which was of such enduring importance to the years that followed</p>
<p> in Australian politics. Now of course so much of that has changed</p>
<p> but it doesn't mean that the demands on the Australian Government</p>
<p> to have a sensible and rational approach to national security has</p>
<p> changed. Indeed in many ways, particularly in our own region, we live</p>
<p> in a less predictable and a more fraught security environment than</p>
<p> we did 20 years ago.</p>
<p>When I became Prime Minister in 1996 I felt that our foreign relations</p>
<p> were somewhat imbalanced. I felt that we ought to see our engagement</p>
<p> with Asia as our top priority but I didn't feel as though it</p>
<p> should be our only priority. And what I have sought to do over the</p>
<p> last three-and-a-quarter years is to bring about a sensible rebalancing</p>
<p> of our national security stance and our foreign policy, to recognise</p>
<p> that our immediate area of responsibility remains, of course, and</p>
<p> will always be our engagement with the nations of Asia. And we have</p>
<p> done that very effectively.</p>
<p>We played a major role in bringing a greater understanding amongst</p>
<p> the nations of Europe and North America of the dilemma faced by Indonesia</p>
<p> in the wake of the Asian economic downturn. And the moderation of</p>
<p> IMF policies in relation to Indonesia was in no small measure due</p>
<p> to the urgings of Australia. We are playing a major and constructive</p>
<p> role in trying to achieve a stable and peaceful outcome in East Timor.</p>
<p> And it took a Coalition government to actually persuade the Government</p>
<p> of Indonesia to change its policy on East Timor. It was a Coalition</p>
<p> government and a Coalition Prime Minister that wrote to Dr Habibie</p>
<p> recommending a change of policy. I don't think, of all the things</p>
<p> that the former government did in foreign policy, I don't think</p>
<p> an area was more characterised by an obsequious approach to the views</p>
<p> of a foreign country than the approach taken by the Labor Party to</p>
<p> then Government of Indonesia.</p>
<p>So, ladies and gentlemen, we have sought to rebalance our foreign</p>
<p> policy and our national security approach because, as I've frequently</p>
<p> said, I believe this country occupies a unique intersection. We are</p>
<p> a nation with profound historical roots in Europe. We have had very</p>
<p> close links with North America. We share many values in common with</p>
<p> the nations of Europe and North America. But here we are in the Asian</p>
<p> Pacific region. Our own population stimulated and nourished by the</p>
<p> coming to this nation of hundreds of thousands of people from the</p>
<p> nations of Asia, all making a wonderful contribution to our country.</p>
<p> We can go to Asia without the baggage of being a former colonial power</p>
<p> or of being a major world power. We can achieve things, as a consequence,</p>
<p> that some of our friends in Europe and America cannot achieve. And</p>
<p> what I've sought to do in that time is to achieve a better balance</p>
<p> in relation to the capacity that that intersection gives us. And I've</p>
<p> been immensely assisted and encouraged and in many areas led by the</p>
<p> contribution that Alexander Downer has made as Foreign Minister of</p>
<p> Australia. Alexander's contribution has been very effective.</p>
<p> He's won growing respect within the world community. And I know,</p>
<p> as a former leader of our Party, I know there are Liberals all around</p>
<p> Australia who are extremely happy and personally very pleased at Alexander's</p>
<p> success as our Foreign Minister.</p>
<p>I mention some of my colleagues, ladies and gentlemen, not in any</p>
<p> sense to separate them or set them apart from others but really to</p>
<p> make the point, and this is really the point that I've come to</p>
<p> a conclusion on, and that is that our success has really been a team</p>
<p> achievement. People are kind enough at gatherings such as this to</p>
<p> say nice things about the Prime Minister, to say nice things about</p>
<p> what the Prime Minister may have achieved. But I couldn't have</p>
<p> done it without an outstanding team. And I want to tell you how tremendously</p>
<p> proud I am as Prime Minister of the team that I have behind me. I've</p>
<p> mentioned some of them but I could go on. Robert Hill I don't</p>
<p> think is with us today because he's off doing battle over Kakadu.</p>
<p> But who will forget Robert's masterly handling of the Kyoto Conference</p>
<p> at the end of 1997 where against all predictions and all odds he won</p>
<p> an outstanding victory for Australian industry and for a balanced</p>
<p> outcome so far as industry and the environment is concerned. And I'm</p>
<p> very grateful having emerged from the difficulties of the Senate over</p>
<p> the last few weeks for the contribution of Robert as the Leader of</p>
<p> the Government in the Senate. But I mention those of my colleagues</p>
<p> who I have mentioned to simply make the point that it has been an</p>
<p> outstanding team. You can't be successful in government, you</p>
<p> can't be successful in politics without team achievement and</p>
<p> without team effort.</p>
<p>We have every reason, as a political party, to be proud of what we</p>
<p> have achieved. We've had the opportunity, over this weekend,</p>
<p> to reflect a little bit on our history and it's important we</p>
<p> do that. It's important that we reclaim our history because it's</p>
<p> a great history. It's important that we remember that most of</p>
<p> the great social changes and improvements were achieved under Liberal</p>
<p> administ</p>
