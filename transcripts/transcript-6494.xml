PRIME MINISTER<br />
E. O. E. -PROOF ONLY<br />
TODAY SHOW -9 OCTOBER 1984 ( pre-recorded on 8 October)<br />
INTERVIEWER: lnt&amp; o to Inteview<br />
The Prime Minittr says he has som good news for those of us; who<br />
are groaning at the thought of yet another election,<br />
ltUxview<br />
PRIME MINISTER: What I am doing is to try and remove for them<br />
forever in the future the possibility of unnecessary ' elections<br />
because I will be saving them an election by having the ' House! o f<br />
Representatives with the election of a half Senate, which we must<br />
hold by April of next year. So I will be saving an election and<br />
saving them $ 19 million. It will cost $ 30 million to have the<br />
two together rather than $ 49 million to have them separately.<br />
But importantly I will be putting a referendum to them with the<br />
election which will mean that if the people pass that that In<br />
future elections have to be simultaneous and no Prime Minister in<br />
the future will be Able to have unnecessary elections.<br />
INTERVIEWER: And if that referendum gets through what do you see<br />
ha ppening a three year period -a guaranteed three year period?<br />
PRIME MINISTER. Yes.<br />
INTERVIEWER: No ifts or buts?'<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No if s or huts because we want them to go full term.<br />
There are very good reasons for doing it now to avoid an unnocessary<br />
extra election.<br />
IN TERVIEWER: Why should people give you another three years? What<br />
has been done in the past eighteen months to convince anybody of<br />
anything?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: In February/ March during the election campaign<br />
Australians will remember in the beginning of ' 83 that this country<br />
was more divided and diiie confrontationist,, than it had been<br />
in living memory. Unemployment was climbing, inflation was h~ igh,<br />
interest rates were very, very high. I promised to bring Aui3tralia<br />
together we have done'that.<br />
INTERVIEWER: And . what is the promise this time around? Is that<br />
going to continue?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: We are going to keep Australians together. We<br />
are going to work on the basis of industry and unions and<br />
governments working together for the common good of Australia. </p>
<p>E. O. E. PROOF ONLY<br />
PEACOCK ON TODAY SHOW 9 OCTOBER 1984<br />
PEACOCK: Fine way of bringing Australians together by having a<br />
fight, and actually in 1984 and not in 1986 when it was due.<br />
But if there is going to be a contest well let's get into it.<br />
INTERVIEWER: -Do you think you will win?<br />
PEACOCK: Yes I do. It's going to be hard Peter. I don't disguise<br />
that. We're behind in the general polling that's around and to<br />
say that it was going to be easy no one wc~ uld believe, and I don't<br />
believe it myself. But I believe there are a considerable numrber<br />
of Australians, very ordinkry AustrAlians~ in the real sense of the<br />
word, who are being hurt at the moiment:-46/ 47 in the dollar for<br />
persons on average weekly earnings paid in tax; the elderly who<br />
have been attacked by the assets test; and for all those who<br />
believed that -in this country you could save and get ahead and have<br />
a nest egg. you are going to be hit by a capital gains tax anti<br />
death duties.<br />
INTERVIEWER: Don't you think the vast majority of Australians<br />
though are happy with the way things have been run for the past<br />
eighteen months? Unless you totally ignore the public opinion<br />
polls that seems to be the situation.<br />
PEACOCK: I think the vast majority of Australians are happy being<br />
Australians but I think they'd be happier with an alternative form<br />
of government because they can see the extent to which taxation<br />
is impinging not only on their general freedom Jecause they<br />
haven't got the money to-spend, but they can't p lan ahead, and<br />
when you add it to the other concerns their lack of choice of<br />
doctor etc in the field of Medicare you see the sort of issues<br />
that will emerge during the election campaign itself and I belideve<br />
that there will be a strong resurgence back to the Liberal and<br />
National Parties.<br />
INTERVIEWER: Alright a couple of quick questions, do you t; hink<br />
that organised crime is going to be an issue in this electionV<br />
PEACOCK: Well because~ there is a difference between ourselves and<br />
the government and they are running away and winding up Costigaa<br />
too early that clearly will come uip. But I think if I can use the<br />
term It is like a second level issue. The factors like tax,<br />
assets test, lump sum superannuation slug, capital gains, death<br />
duties they'll override organised crime.<br />
