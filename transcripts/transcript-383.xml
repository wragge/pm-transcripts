    <content><![CDATA[<p>61/ 07 1<br />SECOND READING SPEECH<br />by<br />THE PRIME MINISTER. THE RT. HON. R. G. Iva,.% Lms<br />IN THE HOUSE OF HEPFLS: E NTATIVES CANBERRA,,-THURSDAY. 19TH O&amp; urix= 19<br />RAITJXAY AGREEMENT ( QUEENSLAND) BILL, 1961.<br />The purpose of' this Bill is to seek the approval of the Parliament to<br />an agreement between the Commonwealth and the State of Queensland covering the<br />provision of financial assistance to that State in the work of increasing and<br />improving the facilities cf the Collinsville-Townsville-Mount Isa Railway.<br />Mount Isa is just over 600 miles by rail from the coast at<br />Towtisville,* and the total distance from the Collinsville coal mines is more<br />than 750 miles. For many years this line has been the main transport link<br />serving the whole of North-western Queensland and in more recent times it has<br />acquired greatly increased importance because of the discovery and development<br />of rich and extensive mineral deposits in the Mount Isa area. The transport<br />task here is primarily a railway operation, but the existing railway has<br />become increasingly deficient in many respects so that it could not possibly<br />provide the capacity to move the tonnages in prospect from the developments<br />likely to occur in that region. Rehabilitation of the railway to the standard<br />now required includes extensive reconstruction of the permanent way to achieve<br />better grades and curves, replacement of one major bridge and a host of minor<br />bridges, considerable replacement of rails and sleepers, new marshalling yards<br />and crossing loops, improved methods of control and administration, the<br />provision of modern locomotives and rolling stock, and so on. This vast<br />project, which is already under way and scheduled for completion by December<br />1964+, has been estimated to cost Å 3Omillion. The provision of financial<br />assistance to Queensland by the Commonwealth, as in the agreement to which<br />approval is now sought, will enable this work to be carried out.<br />At this point I must emphaSi3e that the reconstructed line will retain<br />the existing gauge of 31611 so that the question of gauge standardisation is not<br />involved. It could be argued, of course, that the rehabilitation of a section<br />of a State railway system is purely a matter for the State concerned, and that<br />there is no parallel with other cases where, in the interests of moving towards<br />a uniform gauge link between the principal mainland railways, the Commonwealth<br />has provided financial assistance to certain States. But, in this instance,<br />the very nature and magnitude of the project compels a different approach. It<br />was obvious from the start that the State of Queensland would need some outside<br />help if the complete job were to be done properly and within a reasonable time.<br />Furthermore, the increase in export earnings that will undoubtedly flow from<br />the expansion of metal production at Mount Isa, made possible by an improved<br />railway, gave the Commonwealth good reason for using its best endeavours to<br />ensure that the rehabilitation project would be vigorously pursued. From the<br />outset we expressed a keen interest in the project, and this interest, plus an<br />amount of hard work, has now culminated in the present agreement.<br />Our approach to the form of the assistance to Quaeensland has however<br />been conditioned at all times by the fact that this is not a standardisation<br />work, and so should not attract the same measure of direct support as has been<br />accorded by the CommonwealIth to standardisation projects. I might add that<br />this view was strengthened when it was demonstrated by the most expert<br />investigations that the revitalised line should have no diffioulty in paying its<br />way, including the complete a-mortisation of its capital cost over a period of<br />twenty years, and making a profit.<br />The first approach for Commonwealth assistance was made in 1956 by<br />the then Queensland Premier ( Mr. Gair) and arose from the declared intention of<br />Mount Isa Mines Limited to increase greatly its production of metals and<br />concentrates provided that the necessary increased railway capacity could be<br />made available. Deposits of silver-lead-zinc ores were discovered at Mount<br />Isa in 1923, and the present Company commenced production in 1931, mainly of lead.</p>
<p>From the outset we contemplated an oversea borrowing, and with this<br />in mind suggested, and the State agreed, that independent experts should be<br />engaged to look at the rehabilitation plan and report on its economic<br />feasibility. This led to the appointment of the eminent American firm of<br />consulting engineers, Ford Bacon and Davis, who ma de very thorough investigatiaB<br />and reported, initially in November 1957 and finally in August 1958, that the<br />project was in fact economically feasible. Their calculations showed that the<br />rehabilitated railway should be able to pay its way, and as I said before,<br />completely amortise its capital cost from earnings over a period of twenty years.<br />I mention that Ford Bacon and Davis have been retained by the State to<br />supervise the project, and to undertake various other tasks associated with it<br />and with the genaral operation of the Queensland Railways.<br />On the financing side, wc had been able to interest the International<br />bank for reconstruction and development, and at the 1958 Meeting of the Loan<br />Council we sought and obtained unanimous agreement for the Commonwealth to<br />borrow moneys for the Mount Isa project. This opened the way for a formal<br />request to the Bank for a loan. Quite a lot has been said on this subject,<br />and it is well known that the negotiations with the Bank, which at the start<br />gave great promise of success, finally broke down because the Mount Isa Company<br />was not prepared to provide guarantees of freight revenues from the railway of<br />a kind required by the Bank. This was disappointing to us because in rearly<br />all respects the railway was a project admirably suited to finance by the<br />International Bank. I said at the time, and I now repeat, that we in the<br />Commowealth used our very best endeavours to ensure success. I did not then,<br />nor do I now, criticise in any way the Bank, the Mount Isa Company, or the<br />Queensland Government. It is understandable, of course, that the International<br />3ank must abide by whatever rules it lays down governing the loans it makes and<br />that, having regard to the numerous demands upon it from many countrirZ it<br />cannot readily make exceptions in particular cases, no matter how credit-worthy<br />it regards a particular project or a particular borrower. On the other hand,<br />the Mount Isa Company made its own business judgment as-to how far it could go<br />in guaranteeing the railway freight earnings.<br />When howaver the negotiations with the Bank ended in mid-1959, one<br />thing was perfectly clear. Money had to be found for the job. 4' either we nor<br />the Queensland Government were prepared to let the matter rest where it stood.<br />( Ale intended to try and did try to secure loan finance from overseas sources<br />other than the International Bank. Meeting, however, with no immediate success<br />in that direction and believing that the project was of the greatest urgency<br />and importance, we decided to offer to guarantee the Queensland Government the<br />money for it ourselves, even if our efforts to secure overseas finance should<br />fail. Towards the end of 1959, I therefore wrote to ' Mr, Niolin to<br />tell him the Commowealth was prepared to underwrite the provision of the<br />additional Å 2Omillion required ( that is, the amount over and above the<br />which the State had indicated it could finance itself), on<br />virtually the same terms and conditions as would have applied had the loan from<br />the International Bank boon forthcoming terms and conditions which, I might<br />add, Queensland had always indicated it would be quite happy to acc'; pt. In<br />effect, despite the burden that it would place on our resources, we undertook<br />to put ourselves in the position that the International Bank would have<br />occupied if it had provided a loan of Å 2Omillion.<br />The Premier of Queensland wrote to me a few days after I had made the<br />offer, accepting the offer and expressing satisfaction at what-was, for both. of<br />us, a very notable event. With one exception which I shall Lrention presently,.<br />the terme and conditions whnich were offered and accepted by Queensland were the<br />terms and conditicne which have ncw been embodied in. the Agreamvt which this<br />Bill seeks to approve.<br />As we intended, this offer assuring the State of the finance enabled<br />proper planning of the work to proceed immediately, and the work went forward,<br />without having to wait the results of any further efforts we made to borrow<br />overseas for the project. The lueensland Government wasted no time, and the<br />actual work commenced some time ago. I am plc asad to say that, on the<br />information I have, it is proceeding very satisfactorily. Queensland has been<br />able to meet expenditure so far from its own agreed contribution to the project.<br />However, the time is now approaching when the Commowealth will have to start<br />making its contribution, and it is, of course, necessary for this Agreement to<br />be approved before that can be done.</p>
<p>4 4.<br />I heavo monÃ± A. i. nod 4A-ext, -in olbr. i-ho pX-&gt; opsed toi-n, of the<br />Commonwealth's assistance differ from what was offered and agreed at the oc1 of<br />1959. This is in regard to the matter of the interst rate on the<br />Commonwealth's advances. As I have said, our intention was to put ourselves in<br />the position that we had hoped the International Bank would occupy, and offer<br />Queensland the same terms as would have applied to a loan made by the bank. So<br />far as the interest rate was concerned, we offered to . charge Queensland whatevor<br />happened to be the ruling rate for International Bank loans of about the same<br />duration at the time we': provided the money, subject to a reduction in that rate<br />if we were successful in borrowing more cheaply elsewhere overseas. At the time<br />we were negotiating with the Bank, the ruling International Bank rate was in the<br />vicinity of 6 per cent per annum. Although the State accepted this arrangement<br />initially, we, following receipt of a later suggestion by the Premier,<br />reconsidered it. In an attempt to settle a firm rate once and for all and<br />avoid unnecessary complications and arithmetic later, we subsequently suggested<br />instead that we charge Queensland tho average rate of two particular oversea<br />loans then being raised, the full proceeds of which would, with Loan Council<br />approval, be allocated to the Commowealth, instead of being apportioned between<br />the Commonwealth and the various States in the normal way. The Premier agreed<br />to this, and the necessary Loan Council approval was secured. The average rate<br />of interest on these two loans was 52 per cent per annum and this is the<br />interest rate that the Agreement provides will be charged to Queensland on<br />advances made by the Commonwealth under the Agreement.<br />There were subsequent discussions with the Queensland Government about<br />other aspects of the financial arrangement but I feel that I do not need to go<br />into details of these matters here and I do not propose to do so. It is<br />sufficient to say that full agreement was eventually reached on the basis I have<br />outlined and when this Bill is passed these arrangements can be put into<br />operation. Apart from the interest rate, the other main terms on which the<br />Commorealth is proposing to provide financial assistance are<br />Amount Two-thirds of the actual cost, up to a maximum of Å 20million. As<br />I mentioned earlier, Queensland had indicated that it would be able to<br />provide up to Å 10million towards the cost of the project. The Commonwealtht<br />s advances will be made under Section 96 of the Constitution, and<br />are thus outside the provisions of the Financial Agreement governing<br />ordinary State borrowings.<br />Term The Commonwealth advances are to be repayable in fu1Lover twenty<br />years, commencing from 1st January, 1965, after the work has been<br />completed. Interest is to be capitalised during the construction period.<br />Twenty years is the period over which the expert consultants estimated the<br />railway would be able to repay the money from surpluses earned; it will be<br />most unlikely to impose any burden on the Queensland Government's finances.<br />On the contrary, the Queensland railways seem likely to show improved<br />results as a consequence of this undertakirg<br />This, then, is in br&amp;.. f the story of how the Agreement which the<br />legislation embodies has come about. I am convinced that it will prove to be<br />one of the most successful and rewarding examples of co-operation ever undertaken<br />between the Commonwealth and, a State. For not only will it assist the effective<br />development of vast resources already known but it will almost certainly help to<br />unlock potentialities for growth exceeding anything we can now envisage. It is<br />much more than a State or regional undertaking; it is a national project in the<br />truest sense of that term.<br />I have great pleasure in commending this Bill to the House.</p>
