SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
CHILDREN OF THE HOLOCAUST EXHIBITION<br />
AUSTRALIAN WAR MEMORIAL<br />
9 FEBRUARY 1994<br />
I was deeply honoured to be asked to open this exhibition and a little daunted by the<br />
requirement to speak. To be required to speak about the unspeakable.<br />
One does not have to see these pictures to begin to feel overwhelmed it is enough to<br />
know that one is &amp; Qoin to see them. To know that they exist.<br />
To know that because they are children's pictures they will be like other children's<br />
pictures, like all children's pictures like the pictures our own children might have<br />
drawn.-To know that they might have been our own children.<br />
That it might have happened to them. That the unspeakable might have happened to<br />
us. Children's pictures are all the same in one sense. No one who looks at these can fail<br />
to think of the pictures their own children have drawn, the pictures these days you see<br />
stuck on kitchen walls and refrigerators.<br />
But children's pictures are also remarkable because each one is different. We treasure<br />
them, display them, find it hard to throw them out years after our children find them<br />
an embarrassment because in them we see the first signs of individuality. The first<br />
expressions of each child's personality.<br />
-We see in them the evidence of their hearts and-minds &amp; eloping,. their innocence<br />
and their potential. They contain their hope and ours.<br />
Even in these drawings, done by children cut off from their parents and families,<br />
hungry and afraid in the g hetto of Terezin, there is hope. And innocence,<br />
imagination, love need.<br />
This exhibition is a profound reminder of the appalling betrayal of the good in them,<br />
and the good they inspire in us.<br />
Few of us, I suspect, ever expected to see pictures drawn by children who were<br />
murdered in the Holocaust. It comes somehow as a surprise that they exist.<br />
Yet, had we thought about it, we might have known that they existed. </p>
<p>We knew that there were children in the ghettoes of Europe and children who died in<br />
the extermination camps.<br />
We know all children draw pictures.<br />
So we should have known that someone would have hoarded them away, as we hoard<br />
away our own children's pictures.<br />
We should have known . that-there-would be pictures which remind us that these<br />
terrible events took place, in our century, in our civilisation, in our Europe.<br />
In fact we probably did know. But we simply hadn't thought about it.<br />
And that I believe is the point we have to think about it. That is the only way those<br />
of us who did not experience it will remember the Holocaust.<br />
This exhibition forces us to think forces us to remember.<br />
It reminds us of how profoundly important it is to keep alive the memory and<br />
forever reaffirm the reality of the Holocaust.<br />
It reminds us that those people who keep it alive do so for all of us not just for the<br />
Jewish people and the survivors and descendants of the others who were persecuted,<br />
but for all of us.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen<br />
These children's drawings were not collected by the parents. They were not re-visited<br />
by the kids who drew them.<br />
Most of the parents were killed. And most of the children. Of the 17,000 children<br />
under the age of 14 who were sent to Terezin, only 150 survived.<br />
The drawings were collected by people who knew what they would mean to us. Who<br />
knew, perhaps, that we might nee reminding.<br />
Hidden in suitcases and forgotten about when Terezin was liberated, the drawings<br />
were rediscovered and found their way to the State Jewish Museum in Prague.<br />
I understand the Museum values them so highly that today only copies of the<br />
drawings are placed on display, and the originals are secured in the Museum's<br />
archives.<br />
I also understand that visitors flock to see the display. The collection is<br />
internationally famous.<br />
It therefore says much for the generosity of the museum authorities in Prague that<br />
they have allowed some of these drawings to come to Australia.<br />
And I take this opportunity to thank the Director of the State Jewish Museum, Dr<br />
Kybalova, for the cooperation extended to the Australian War Memorial.<br />
I also want to thank the former Ambassador of the Czech Republic in Canberra, Dr<br />
David-Moserova, for her assistance and the staff of the Embassy.<br />
I am pleased to see that the Czech Embassy is represented here tonight and ask that<br />
my gratitude be passed on to the authorities in Prague. </p>
<p>And, of course, I must also thank Dr Michael McKernan, the Deputy Director of the<br />
Australian War Memorial, for his efforts for having the wisdom to see the<br />
importance of this exhibition to Australia and to the Memorial.<br />
The Australian War Memorial is one of our great national institutions, and its<br />
continuing. importance to our national life could not have been more amply<br />
demonstrated than it was last year at the Ceremony for the Entombment of the<br />
Unknown Australian Soldier.<br />
The Memorial was founded by Charles Bean in the belief that we would only<br />
understand the realities of war, and the evils of war, by knowing the stories of the<br />
people affected by war.<br />
Down the years the Memorial has done this superbly. So long as it is here, and in the<br />
hands of wise and imaginative people like Dame B~ eryl, Brendan Kelson and Michael<br />
McKernan, Australians will not forget the sacrifices made in war by their countrymen<br />
and women.<br />
But nor should we ever forget the sacrifices made by others, or fail to teach the stories<br />
and the lessons of their experience.<br />
This Memorial stands as a permanent reminder of the Australian experience of war.<br />
It contains many of the clues to who we are, many of the icons of our identity.<br />
But no conception of what it means to be Australian, or what our experience in war<br />
means, can be complete or falthful to the truth and our ideals without an<br />
understanding of what others have been through.<br />
We cannot be indifferent to the experience of others we most certainly cannot be<br />
indifferent to the experience of the Jewish people in the Holocaust.<br />
After all, in the end, it was because they were indifferent, and knew this country<br />
was not immune to evil and the suffering of others, that the men and women honoured<br />
in this place sacrificed their lives.<br />
In the end, it will only be because we are not indifferent, and do not think ourselves<br />
immune, that new holocausts will be averted.<br />
Today, as children die in Bosnia and terms like ethnic cleansing enter the vocabulary<br />
of that part of the world, the words we see on this memorial " Lest We Forget"<br />
surely embrace the children of the Holocaust.<br />
I congratulate all-those associated with this exhibition. ILunder-stand. from here it<br />
moves on to the Sydney Jewish Museum and I thank Mr John Saunders, the founder<br />
of the Museum, who is with us tonight.<br />
I should also like to thank John Glass for speaking to us about his experiences in<br />
Terezin and the other Holocaust survivors who are here and who will, in the course<br />
of the exhibition, give their time freely to speak to visitors.<br />
Let me conclude by saying that I sincerely hope every Australian who has an<br />
opportunity to see the Children of Holocaust does see it.<br />
I now declare this exhibition open. </p>
