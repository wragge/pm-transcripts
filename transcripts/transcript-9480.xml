PRIME MINISTER<br />
*** CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING, MP<br />
LAUNCH OF THE SOUTH METROPOLITAN ( WA) ECONOMIC<br />
DEVELOPMENT REGION, WESTERN AUSTRALIAN SPECIALITY ALLOYS<br />
PTY LTD, CANNINGVALE, WA, 15 FEBRUARY 1995<br />
It was with real excitement that I accepted the invitation to come here today<br />
and ' launch the region', the first in the West.<br />
This is a first step, taken by some very industrious people, to contribute to<br />
their community by applying certain of the ideas articulated by this<br />
Government in the White Paper, Working Nation.<br />
One of the landmark initiatives in the White Paper was the Regional<br />
Economic Development Program.<br />
Many of this nation's economic problems, and the solutions to those<br />
problems, are to be found at the regional level.<br />
The idea behind the Regional Economic Development Program is simple, but<br />
ambitious. The idea is to take a region and empower it.<br />
To isolate its talents, to harness its energy, to coordinate its resources, to<br />
bring together its people.<br />
The Program is not about plying regions with extra funds, but allowing<br />
regions to articulate their own visions and helping them to achieve those<br />
visions, through business collaboration and development of regional<br />
strategies, priorities and projects.<br />
This agenda can only be achieved if the local stakeholders have a high<br />
degree of participation in the regional institutions, and ownership of the<br />
regional processes. </p>
<p>That is what differentiates this Program from the failed 1970s concept of<br />
regional development based on urban growth centres. In those days,<br />
economic strategies were dreamed up elsewhere, and imposed on regional<br />
communities. The decision makers misread local conditions, and lacked local<br />
support. By contrast, the Regional Economic Development Program has been<br />
developed on a platform of broadly-based community participation. The<br />
strategy is anchored in the regions themselves, and draws heavily on their<br />
resources. Ideas and initiatives derive from the regional communities.<br />
And as we see today, they are springing forth.<br />
That's not to say the Commonwealth Government is a mere passenger.<br />
In the initial stages, the Commonwealth is a catalyst a spark plug. It draws<br />
all the parties together, and focusses community dialogue.<br />
Where a core group of regional leaders emerge and form a Steering<br />
Committee, the Commonwealth will establish a Regional Economic<br />
Development Organisation ( a REDO) to help with directions.<br />
Where required, and at the request of Steering Committee, the<br />
Commonwealth will fund regional conferences to identify the strengths and<br />
resources of the region, the capacities of its institutions, and possible bridges<br />
to other regions. We will help to enhance those capacities, and build more of<br />
those bridges.<br />
The development and implementation of strategies to increase employment<br />
and investment requires both vision and the commitment of resources. The<br />
Commonwealth will commit up to $ 240,000 over three years to fund the<br />
operation of a REDO, to support that vision.<br />
Where infrastructure bottlenecks are impeding regional economic<br />
development, the Commonwealth will help overcome them.<br />
We will do it either by direct funding or by Infrastructure Bonds which<br />
encourage private sector investment through Commonwealth tax<br />
concessions. To accomplish all this, the Commonwealth will spend $ 150 million over four<br />
years under the Program.<br />
And this does not represent the totality of Commonwealth assistance to<br />
regional economic development. </p>
<p>The Regional Economic Development Program will be a vehicle for the<br />
delivery of other Commonwealth assistance and services to the regions.<br />
These services will be channelled in focussed and imaginative ways, and<br />
their impact will be profound.<br />
I said on Australia Day that the development of regional Australia along these<br />
lines has a potential comparable to our immigration programs.<br />
It can make Australia more dynamic, adventurous and outward-looking; more<br />
diverse and much stronger.<br />
If we can get regional economies going with a place in the mainstream of the<br />
national economy and indeed the global economy we will get stronger<br />
communities in every other sense, including the social sense.<br />
Above all, of course, we are going to get jobs and jobs with a future.<br />
The Commonwealth Government's regional development strategy boasts an<br />
ambitious agenda.<br />
Such an agenda is only achievable if we work in concert with local and state<br />
governments, as well as with business, unions and education research<br />
bodies. The Commonwealth does not seek to duplicate or usurp the economic<br />
development programs undertaken by other governments. Rather, we seek<br />
to build on and add value to these already-existing programs.<br />
Deputy Premier Cowan and his department have cooperated in the initial<br />
steps. I am also pleased to hear that these initiatives in the metropolitan area have<br />
been supported by the Western Australian Chamber of Commerce and<br />
Industry, the Western Australian Municipal Association and the Trades and<br />
Labour Council of Western Australia.<br />
So this region, embracing the municipalities of Melville, East Fremantle,<br />
Fremantle, Cockburn, Kwinana, Rockingham, Gosnells, Armadale,<br />
Serpentine-Jarrahdale and the proposed municipality of Shepperton, now has<br />
an opportunity to work more effectively towards employment and investment.<br />
To Kyle Abbott, thank you for making this venue available today. A most<br />
appropriate venue for a program promoting Australian exports.<br />
To the business and industry leaders of the region, thank you for accepting<br />
the responsibility of leadership. </p>
<p>Your investment of knowledge and skills in the community is an investment in<br />
the future. It is like applying the old agricultural axiom return to the soil what<br />
has been taken from it.<br />
The most extraordinary resource of this region is clearly its people. The<br />
South Metropolitan Region is fortunate in having a very dedicated group of<br />
community leaders who form the Steering Committee:<br />
Mrs Charlotte Stockwell of the South West Corridor Development and<br />
Employment Foundation;<br />
Mr Jay Hardison of the Heritage Country Development Agency;<br />
Mr Lyn Metcalf of the City of South Perth;<br />
Mr John Hardwick, also of the City of South Perth;<br />
Ms Lorraine McKeig of the Kwinana office of the Chamber of<br />
Commerce and Industry;<br />
Professor John Wood of Notre Dame University; and<br />
Professor Peter Newman of Murdoch University.<br />
To this pioneering Steering Committee, I offer you my congratulations and my<br />
Government's support.<br />
As tangible proof of this support, I am pleased to announce a major<br />
Commonwealth Program Delivery Initiative in this region a result of<br />
recommendations made in the Kelty report, subsequent studies by<br />
government officials, consultations with regional communities and a study by<br />
Price Waterhouse.<br />
A group of Commonwealth officials will be formed here to assist with your<br />
regional strategies, to search for partnership opportunities and help address<br />
problems impeding the region's growth strategy.<br />
This group will consist of the senior officials from key Commonwealth<br />
agencies involved in the region such as the Departments of Employment,<br />
Education and Training, Housing and Regional Development, Social Security,<br />
Defence, Industry Science and Technology, the Australian Technology,<br />
Science and Industry Council, and Austrade.<br />
As this Initiative is progressively established it will provide ballast for your<br />
regional strategy, broadening and deepening the region's capacities. </p>
<p>I am pleased to hand over a cheque for $ 23,800 to fund the regional audit<br />
and search conference process to help the Steering Committee to identify the<br />
region's strengths, possible social and economic linkages between the<br />
various municipalities and to develop a proposed structure for a REDO for<br />
your region.<br />
I wish you well in your endeavours. </p>
