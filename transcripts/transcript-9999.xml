    <content><![CDATA[<p>GUN CONTROL<br />
The Commonwealth and the States and Territories today agreed on a uniform and tougher approach to gun laws which will make Australia a safer place to live. </p>
<p>The agreement includes a ban on automatic and semi-automatic rifles and shotguns and a nationwide approach to registration and licensing. </p>
<p>This is an historic moment for all Australians still reeling from the fatal shootings at Port Arthur. </p>
<p>The Australian community demanded urgent and effective action on tougher gun laws and today all governments have answered that call with a comprehensive action plan which will deliver effective nationwide controls. </p>
<p>Wc have agreed to prohibit the importation, ownership, sale, resale, transfer, possession, manufacture or use of: </p>
<p>- all military-style centre-fire rifles including those which substantially duplicate military styles;<br />
- all other self-loading centre-fire rifles;<br />
- all self-loading and pump-action shotguns and<br />
- all self-loading rim fire rifles. </p>
<p>The importation ban will be effective immediately. </p>
<p>The exceptions will be a limited range of official or occupational purposes certified by a permit. </p>
<p>In practice this will mean that primary producers can only have access to low-powered self-loading .22s and self-loading and pump-action shotguns if they can satisfy the police that they have a genuine need for them which cannot be met by any other methods or by non-prohibited weapons. </p>
<p>Action will be taken to strictly regulate  mail orders. </p>
<p>These prohibitions will be enforced byv all jurisdictions as soon as the necessary legislation/regulations can be passed. All jurisdictions have agreed that this will be done as soon as possible. </p>
<p>All jurisdictions have also agreed to fair and proper compensation being paid and I will write to a1l Premiers and Chief Ministers next week on the details of the financing of this compensation for surrender scheme. </p>
<p>In addition all firearms will be registered as part of an integrated licensing system and linked nationally. There will be a comprehensive common approach to licensing which will ensure that only those persons who are fit and proper with a genuine reason and need for a firearm wvill have access to one. </p>
<p>Stringent storage requirements and compulsory safety training for first time licence applicants will be introduced in all jurisdictions. </p>
<p>There will be tight controls on the sale, advertising for sale and transfer of all firearms and ammunition both within jurisdictions and between them. </p>
