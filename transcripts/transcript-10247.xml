PRIME MINISTER<br />
DENG-XIAOPING,<br />
I have today on behalf of the Australian Government and people sent to<br />
Premier Li Peng the following message of condolence on the death of Deng<br />
Xiaoping: " One Qf China ' s most significant leaders, Deng Xiaoping played<br />
a key role in China ' s modern history. The growing prosperity of<br />
China is his enduring legacy. On behalf of the Government and<br />
people of Australia, I extend our condolences and sympathy to<br />
the Chinese Government and the people of China on his death.<br />
Australia and China have many important interests in commonL<br />
Iwould like to take this opportunity to reiterate my desire to<br />
further strengthen our relationship in the future.<br />
Deng Xiaoping was the central force behind the modernisation and opening up<br />
of China's economy and in bringing China out of its isolation. He was a<br />
motivating force behind the dynamic growth that China has enjoyed in the past<br />
years, and that has had a huge impact on China and important consequences<br />
for the region and the world.<br />
As I told President Jiang Zemmn last year in Manila, Australia remains firmly<br />
committed to a strong and mutually beneficial partnership with China. There<br />
will be differences but there are also very important common interests and we<br />
should build on these.<br />
My visit to China in late March will provide an invaluable opportunity to<br />
strengthen the relationship.<br />
