. W 3 March 1997 TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
THE HON JOHN HOWARD MP<br />
ADDRESS AT THE NORMAN MAY OAM TRIBUTE DINNER<br />
WENTWORTH HOTEL, SYDNEY<br />
E O E<br />
Thank you very much Gordon; to Michael Knight and Gabrielle Harrison; to John<br />
Coates, and most importantly of all to our guest of honour and the person whose long<br />
years of commitment to and enjoyment of and demonstration of the great capacity to<br />
communicate Australian sport, Norman May, ladies and gentlemen.<br />
It's often said that if there is a national cement in Australia it is our great love of sport.<br />
And I can't think of a gathering that I've been to, certainly as Prime Minister, perhaps<br />
at any time, that has brought together such a cross-section of men and women that<br />
have thrilled us over the years. Every conceivable sport, just about, is represented here<br />
tonight. Some of the greatest names in Australian sport, in the Olympic sports, in our<br />
other great national sports such as cricket and rugby league, they're all represented<br />
here tonight and that is for a very good reason. Because there's a special bond<br />
between Australians and their sportsmen and that bond in most cases is via sports<br />
commentators. When I was growing up as a young bloke in the late ' 40s and early ' 50s my connection<br />
was fought apart from my rather feeble attempts to play various games not very<br />
adequately. My real connection with sports was through those great sports<br />
commentators, firstly on radio and I have to say almost entirely at that time through<br />
the ABC. People like Bernard Koo and Brian McLenahan and Frank O'Rourke who<br />
described the rugby league, and of course the great Alan McGilvray and Victor<br />
Richardson and Johnny Moise and others, and the interstate sports commentators like<br />
Clive Harburg and Arnold Mewens in Brisbane and Adelaide they were the people<br />
who first sort of put me into touch with sport.<br />
And tonight is a reminder to me of how absolutely incredibly important the link<br />
between the sportsmen and women of Australia adore and admire how incredible is the<br />
link that is provided by the sports commentator. Because without the sports<br />
commentator the ability of men and women in the Australian community who love </p>
<p>their sport to relate to the achievements of their sporting heroes simply wouldn't be<br />
there. And if you look back over the sporting achievements of Australia, the last 30 or<br />
years, no person has occupied the centre stage in communicating the thrill of the<br />
experience and the excitement and the national pride and the sheer joy and the sheer<br />
pleasure more effectively and more eloquently than Norman May. And in doing that<br />
he's taking his place beside some absolutely tremendous sporting commentators, but<br />
he really has been the principal. And what has been quite remarkable about him is his<br />
capacity to communicate about so many sports and that's what I think marks him out<br />
from the others. You have the great cricket commentators like Alan McGilvray and<br />
we've had, in more recent times, great rugby league commentators like Ray Hadley<br />
and you had some great race callers over the years, but Norman May is unique because<br />
Norman is associated with so many sports. He will be forever associated, of course,<br />
with the 1980 Olympic Games. And we were reminded of that just a few moments ago<br />
when he bequeath some inaugural words to the long history of Australian sport and<br />
what a great excitement to have three of those four tremendous representatives of<br />
Australia in the 1980 Games here with us tonight.<br />
But to be able, as one single sports commentator, to be able to hear the tributes from<br />
those three blokes, to hear what Tracy Wickham had to say, to hear Doug Walters I<br />
don't think I've heard a funnier speech at a sports gathering than I heard tonight, good<br />
on you Doug you were a great Australian cricketer and even more important than<br />
that, you're a great Australian personality. And of course the tribute from a<br />
member of that sort of rare breed of the rare manifestation of sporting belongs to one<br />
of those great Australian sporting family where incredibly the genes are such that you<br />
produce two or three or, in some cases, even four Australian or world champions in a<br />
particular sport.<br />
So Norman you have achieved something that no other sports commentator in the<br />
history of Australian sport has achieved. You have achieved a versatility, you have<br />
achieved a capacity to relate across all of the sports and a capacity to communicate to<br />
all Australians in something that they all instinctively love and they all instinctively<br />
enjoy. And it's been a great privilege to share this night with you. And I'm very<br />
grateful that you've been able to keep me fually informed as time has gone by the<br />
cricket score in South Africa I haven't heard anything though since the resumption<br />
after lunch. I hope somebody will get be informed about that after I've sat down.<br />
Norman, on behalf of a very grateful sports loving nation and from the lips of a sports<br />
loving Prime Minister can I say thank you for what you've done for Australian sport.<br />
Thank you for all your selfless, prodigious, sacrificing efforts for no personal reward<br />
other than the enjoyment of doing something good for other people for the tremendous<br />
fundraising efforts to which you've committed yourself over such a very, very long<br />
period of time. And having said all of that I would like you to come forward because I<br />
want to make a very small presentation well, it's not so small a presentation to you<br />
which I hope expresses the affection, the gratitude and the admiration for what you've<br />
done and for the privilege of knowing you and your contribution to Australian sport. </p>
