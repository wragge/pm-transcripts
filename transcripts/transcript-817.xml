LUNCHEON IN HONOUR OF HIS EXCELLENCY MR. HAYATO IKEDAI<br />
PRUE~ MINISTER OF JA-PAN<br />
at<br />
PARLIAMENT HOUSE, CANUBERRA,<br />
ON 30TH SEPTEMBER, 1963<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE RT. HON. SIR ROBERT MENZIES<br />
Sir, You are the Prime Minister of a nation which has such<br />
a great part to play, not only in the Pacific Area, but in the<br />
world, You are, therefore, on that ground alone, welcome in this<br />
country ( Hear, hear) ( Applause), and it is my pleasure, Sir, on<br />
behalf of the Australian Parliament, to express that welcome in<br />
words. It would, Sir, as I am sure you will agree, be idle<br />
to pretend that the war did not leave grievous wounds upon<br />
Australia's feelings towards Japan. It is the basis of friendship<br />
that we should recognise that f~ act. There were and there<br />
are bitter memories in many hearts.<br />
But, Sir, it is in the Australian character not to<br />
prolong hatreds or to live on past events. ( Hear, hoar) ( Applause)<br />
We are essentially a forward-looking people, with a great instinct<br />
for optimism and friendship. We want to live not only in peace,<br />
but in the widest co-operation with other nations. Your<br />
predecessor in your great office, Mr. Kishi, made us a successful<br />
visit a few years ago, I myself hCAve visited your country twice<br />
during my term of office. You have sent us a series of most<br />
distinguished Ambassadors ( Applause), whose work, not only In<br />
the re-establishment of good will, but also in the handlingof<br />
the practical problems of trade and commerce, has been of<br />
immense value to both our countries. Our own Ambassadors to<br />
Japan, I do not doubt I hove one of them here today ( Applause)-<br />
have performed similar services at your end.<br />
Some years after the echoes of the war had died<br />
away, we decided, in this country, as a considered matter of<br />
policy, that security and co-operation in the Pacific should be<br />
preferred to the prolongation of enmity; that we should learn<br />
to live with each other; that we should concentrate upon our<br />
common interests and be aware of our common dangors. In the<br />
achievement of all these great objectives, Japan has shown<br />
herself a willing co-operator. In the world atmosphere of<br />
recent times Japan has resumed her place as a great power, with<br />
remarkable economic development and skill, and with a growing<br />
willingness, I am happy to note, to play an effective part in<br />
the solution of the world's economic problems. Australia herself,<br />
a small nation but a large traer~ has been developing commercial<br />
relations with Japan which, in absolute as well as in relative<br />
terms, have been of great value to both our countries. Our<br />
Trade Treaties with you have marked our close relations with<br />
you. Their efficacy abd I point this out with some sati~ faction<br />
has depended, not only upon the letter of the deal, but upon<br />
genuine good faith. ( Hear, hear) But Sir, trade though<br />
important, is not all. Our contacts with you at all human<br />
levels have been growing. Whatever the torments of an earlier<br />
period, I think we can all agree here today that we can now look<br />
back upon a decade of most civilised association. Wie wanit this<br />
association to continue, and to grow stranger nnd I am sure, Sir,<br />
that you shore this desire, </p>
<p>2-<br />
Now, Sir may I turn from this to look very, very<br />
briefly at some of the probloms of the present and the future.<br />
We aro all concerned with the expansionary threats of Communist<br />
politics, philosophy destructive philosophy. Neither you nor<br />
we have any aggressive intentions, but we must stand ready to<br />
protect our owm freedoms. This readiness does not simply connote<br />
military preparedness. It involves the establishment, in the<br />
eyes of the world, of the fact that free communities can provide<br />
for their citizons growing living standards and swift nationall<br />
development without the sacrifice of individual freedom in the<br />
interests of a dictatorship or a powerful few. ( Applause)<br />
I'e believe that you, Mr. Prime Minister, and your<br />
nation? share these ideas. We believe if I may say so withQut<br />
impertinence to a welcome and distinguished guest, tha. t Japan<br />
must and will play a great and constructive part in this<br />
historic drama. One of the great causes of tension in the world i.<br />
the economic differences which exist between the great industrial<br />
powers on the one hand, and the relotively underdeveloped<br />
countries which depend upon primary production and therefore<br />
suffer from instability of prices and somue uncertainty of markets.<br />
Those differences, unless a conscious effort is made to reduce<br />
them, will tend to increase, and for the very good reason, or<br />
the very bad reason, that the rate of growth in highly industrialised<br />
countries, thanks to the rapid improvement of technologies<br />
and plant, tends to be faster than it is in countries follow~ Lng<br />
farming and pastoral pursuits.<br />
We believe that these facts call for far-reaching<br />
policies on the part of the great industrial powers designed<br />
not only to assist development in newer countries lut also to<br />
assure reasonable, stable and profitable markets lor the products<br />
of that development. Sir, Japan is one of the great industrial powers.<br />
Aifter a necessary period of re-adjustment, you have made enormous<br />
strides forward, with immnense skill and the most admirable<br />
industry. You have? for us, a special significance in the South-<br />
West Pacific in which your influence, a great and growing one,<br />
can do much toassist political and economic stability and the<br />
elimination of old or new animosities, In short, Mr. Prime<br />
Minister, we bulieve that in this new political and social world,<br />
a world which is in the making, Japan has a now and historic<br />
function and destiny.<br />
Small and remote as we may seem in Australia when<br />
viewed against the world background we have the resources and<br />
the skill and the energy to grow and become a powerful co-operator<br />
in the common cause of humanity. But great or small you great,<br />
we small we all need friends with common interests and comimon<br />
ideals. The world does not need nor should it tolerate or<br />
encourage, the perpetuation of differences. Let us rather build<br />
upon those good things that we have in cor. on. If the nations<br />
arc to be free and prosperous, friendship and co-operation and<br />
mutual understanding must be our common aima.<br />
Mr. Prime Minister, your visit is a powerful contribution,<br />
in itself, to this end. We are delighted that you are<br />
here, both giving and receiving good will. </p>
