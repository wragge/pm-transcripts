VIETNA14ESE REFUGEES<br />
A number of Vietnamese who had sought refuge in Australia following-the<br />
collapse of the. Government of the Republic of Vietnam were admitted to<br />
Australia by the previous Government only after they had signed a<br />
written undertaking not to engage in political activity or to lend<br />
their names to such activity.<br />
It is the Goenet's view that such a requirement is inappropriate.<br />
I have accordingly asked the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs<br />
to arrange for the persons concerned to be officially advised in writing<br />
that the Government does not regard the undertaking they signed as binding<br />
and that the documents will be cancelled. </p>
