to the Australian Government. I confirm that steps will be<br />
taken to pass the Independence Act in the Australian Parliament<br />

co-operation between our two Governments and our two nations.<br />

sympathy, aid or support in any form to any group in Papua New<br />
Guinea working to undermine their country's unity. In accordance<br />
ith our obligations to the United Nations, the Australian<br />
Government has a responsibility to the people of Papua New Guinea<br />
to help them ensure thnat on independence day they are citizens of<br />
a strong and united country..<br />
