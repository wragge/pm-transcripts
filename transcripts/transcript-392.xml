QUEEN'S VISIT TO GHANA<br />
Statement by the Prime M inister, the it. Hon. RoG. Monzies<br />
I have, during the past three weeks, kept closely in<br />
touch with matters affecting the projected visit of Her Majesty<br />
the Queen to Ghana. I have received reports from the Australian<br />
High Commissioner in Accra and have exchanged messages with Mr.<br />
Macmillan. le all agree that visits by Her Majesty to the<br />
countries of the Commonwealth are of the greatest possible<br />
significance and value. There is a natural and lively concern<br />
in all parts of the Commonwealth, not least in Australia, that<br />
visits should be made and that each visit should be the greates'<br />
ponsible success4 In accordance with custom, the principal<br />
responsibility for arrangements in connection with The Queen's<br />
visit to Chana rests with the Governments of Ghana and of Great<br />
Britain. Clearly, the safety of The Queen is of the very first<br />
importance for all of us. It is quite clear that the Governments<br />
most directly concerned with the organization of the visit share<br />
this view completely, and that their judgment will be most<br />
carefully formed,<br />
CANBvRRA,<br />
