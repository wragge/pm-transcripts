CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
EVATT FOUNDATION 10TH ANNIVERSARY<br />
SYDNEY 17 NOVEMBER 1989<br />
In celebrating the tenth birthday of the Evatt Foundation we<br />
are celebrating a decade of achievement by an organisation<br />
that, with broad community support, has expanded our<br />
understanding of public policy and has made a very valuable<br />
contribution, in particular, to the training and education<br />
of young Australians.<br />
I congratulate all those involved in the Foundation and I<br />
wish you well for another decade of good work.<br />
on this occasion we also honour a man who, whatever some may<br />
perceive as shortcomings, was a great Australian who made an<br />
enduring contribution to the Labor movement and to his<br />
country: Dr Herbert Vere Evatt.<br />
Dr Evatt was a leading figure in that magnificent era of<br />
Labor in Government in the 1940s our ' light on the hill'<br />
era, when under the leadership of Labor Prime Ministers John<br />
Curtin and Ben Chifley Australia successfully navigated the<br />
hardships of war and met the great challenges of post-war<br />
reconstruction.<br />
Evatt's contribution to those Governments as External<br />
Affairs Minister and Attorney-General as well as his<br />
period of service as a Judge of the High Court, and his body<br />
of legal and historical writings by themselves stamp him<br />
as a significant figure in the history of our movement.<br />
Later, as Leader of the opposition, he campaigned<br />
successfully against Menzies' referendum to dissolve the<br />
Communist Party Australia's ugly flirtation with<br />
McCarthyism and in doing so made a landmark contribution<br />
to the defence of civil liberties and political freedoms in<br />
this country.<br />
In the international sphere, culminating in his Presidency<br />
of the Third Session of the United Nations General Assembly<br />
in 1948, H. V. Evatt became not only one of Australia's most<br />
influential international statesmen but truly, one of the<br />
architects of the emerging post-war global order. </p>
<p>In the very month when the Berlin Wall is being torn down<br />
symbolic of all the breathtaking changes in Eastern Europe<br />
and the Soviet Union it might seem that a figure from the<br />
earliest days of the Cold War would have little relevance to<br />
us now.<br />
Certainly, there is much that would surprise Evatt in world<br />
affairs today.<br />
The superpower dialogue at Yalta was very different from the<br />
dialogue about to take place at Malta.<br />
In a different sphere, the emphasis placed in contemporary<br />
diplomacy on issues of economic cooperation and<br />
environmental protection would no doubt surprise him.<br />
And he would hardly recognise the dramatic changes that have<br />
made our own region the most economically dynamic part of<br />
the globe, posing challenges and opportunities that could<br />
not have been clearly foreseen at the end of the Second<br />
world War.<br />
But in one area Dr Evatt would be entirely at home. In one<br />
respect, the global changes that we are witnessing in the<br />
late 1980s are fulfilling the dreams that inspired men such<br />
as Evatt in the late 1940s.<br />
I refer of course to the resurgence in multilateralism and,<br />
not least, to the positive role that Evatt's beloved United<br />
Nations Organisation has started to play once more in the<br />
resolution of global and regional conflict.<br />
In Namibia, in the Gulf, in Afghanistan, the United Nations<br />
has begun again to live up to the high hopes with which it<br />
was invested by its creators more than 40 years ago.<br />
Evatt in foreign policy sowed the seeds for a modern<br />
Australia one that was vigorously outgoing and positively<br />
engaged in an interdependent world.<br />
Unfortunately, Chifley's defeat in 1949 ushered in an era of<br />
insularity and introspection in Australia.<br />
The Liberals presided over the decades when we were seen as<br />
the lucky country years when the world paid us a good<br />
living for shearing sheep, cutting wheat and mining iron ore<br />
while we sheltered behind the walls of protectionism.<br />
But the world was not prepared to pay us a living forever.<br />
So the post-49 conservative Coalition years were years of<br />
tragically wasted opportunities years in which were<br />
entrenched the bad habits of protectionism, the attitudes of<br />
insularity, the deliberate neglect of competitiveness and<br />
the erosion of national self-confidence about our place in<br />
the world. </p>
<p>Those years set in train the very problems that Australians<br />
today have to correct and to pay for.<br />
And it is ironic that the conservatives' long years in<br />
Government left them with a crippling historic legacy.<br />
Labor learned its lessons about Opposition, hard but well.<br />
The Liberals never learned their lessons about government<br />
they still bear the scars of their failures in office from<br />
the 1950s through to the<br />
Because they governed then in easy economic times, they have<br />
never acquired, since, the policy skills and disciplines to<br />
manage more difficult economic challenges.<br />
And because they enjoyed political success then while<br />
fudging or ignoring fundamental economic realities, they<br />
have never acquired since the political skills the guts or<br />
the wisdom to put the national well-being ahead of their<br />
own, short-term, short-sighted electoral interests.<br />
That's what we saw when they were last in Government,<br />
between 1975 and 1983: the conservatives still governing<br />
for the easy times; still ignoring and indeed inflaming the<br />
real and urgent problems in the Australian economy and the<br />
Australian community.<br />
And that's what we have seen more recently with the Liberals<br />
in Opposition. Andrew Peacock's so-called Economic Action<br />
Plan confirms it starkly: they are still incapable of<br />
governing for all Australians; still unwilling to put the<br />
Australian people ahead of their own attempts to get back<br />
into power.<br />
That is why I reject as nonsense the suggestion that has<br />
gained currency of late to the effect that there is no great<br />
difference between Labor and Liberal in this country that<br />
two parties occupying the centre are arguing over peripheral<br />
matters. Let me tell you that the ideological gulf between Labor and<br />
Liberal, always a wide one, has never been wider than it is<br />
today. That is not some assertion I make lightly or without<br />
evidence. It is rather a statement that can be proven and tested by a<br />
rigorous analysis of the ideology and policies of Labor and<br />
the conservatives in every key aspect of modern government.<br />
In every area where the Australian people properly look to<br />
government for leadership and constructive involvement,<br />
Labor and the conservatives stand on opposite sides of a<br />
vast chasm. </p>
<p>SWe are fundamentally at odds on the basic and critical<br />
question of how employers and employees should relate to<br />
one another in the workplace on how those in the<br />
community who are engaged in the process of creating<br />
economic prosperity deal with each other.<br />
SWe are fundamentally at odds on the equally basic<br />
question of how economic prosperity is to be distributed<br />
within the community.<br />
SWe are fundamentally at odds on how we make decisions<br />
not only for the voting community of today, but also for<br />
those who have no vote the very young and the unborn<br />
generations of the future.<br />
SAnd we are fundamentally at odds on how we view<br />
Australia's role in the international community.<br />
I would resist the temptation to remind you of the ideology<br />
and performance of the conservative parties on these scores<br />
when they were last in government if their ideology and<br />
policies now were different. But t-EHey aren't.<br />
So, for instance, in looking at the area of workplace<br />
relationships, the confrontationism that so damagingly<br />
characterised the Fraser years has not only survived it<br />
has been stengthened by the ideologues of the New Right who<br />
now set the pace for industrial relations in the<br />
conservative ranks.<br />
By setting Australian against Australian, by allowing the<br />
strong to exercise their industrial muscle while the weak<br />
fell victim to the consequent wages explosion, the Coalition<br />
in the early 1980s wreaked upon this country the<br />
historically unique achievement of simultaneous double digit<br />
unemployment and double digit inflation. In an economy<br />
which they reduced to negative economic growth they threw an<br />
additional quarter of a million Australian workers onto the<br />
unemployment scrapheap. They destroyed Australians in jobs<br />
and devastated the legitimate aspirations of the youth of<br />
Australia. Nothing has changed in their attitudes or approach.<br />
The Liberals abhor the centralised wage fixing system and<br />
the role of the trade union movement under Labor.<br />
They give aid and comfort to the Pilots' Federation in<br />
pursuit of a 30 per cent pay rise.<br />
Their ideological obsession about deregulating the labour<br />
market would destroy an industrial relations system that<br />
under Labor has created jobs in Australia nearly five times<br />
faster than the Liberals did, and twice as fast as the rest<br />
of the Western world. </p>
<p>They promise a return to industrial warfare where the weak<br />
are crushed and the strong get the spoils. Theirs is a<br />
prescription for another wages explosion, a plunge in the<br />
dollar, double digit inflation again, spiralling interest<br />
rates and the consignment once more of hundreds of thousands<br />
of Australians to the unemployment scrapheap.<br />
But Labor offers continued productivity improvements through<br />
award restructuring, and sensible wage outcomes secured by<br />
improvements in the social wage.<br />
I can find no common ground between Labor and the<br />
conservatives on industrial relations there is only a<br />
policy chasm.<br />
And just as the conservatives would produce massive social<br />
inequities on this issue of creating prosperity, so that<br />
outcome, and those inequities, would be reinforced by their<br />
philosophy on the distribution of prosperity throughout the<br />
community. Redistribution has two elements the raising of revenue<br />
through taxation and its disbursement through measures of<br />
social assistance.<br />
The conservatives in government increased the tax burden on<br />
PAYE earners, and allowed the well off to exploit the<br />
absence of capital gains and fringe benefit taxes.<br />
As Professor Russell Mathews indicated, income tax ceased to<br />
be a matter of obligation for the well-off and became a<br />
matter of choice.<br />
The absence of a capital gains tax meant the well off could<br />
hire smart accountants and lawyers to convert their income<br />
into non-taxable capital gains. They could avoid tax on a<br />
scale so massive that the conservative Government's own<br />
Royal Commissioner described the tax avoidance industry as<br />
the fastest growing industry in Australia in their period of<br />
office. The Labor Government introduced a capital gains tax, and we<br />
closed down the other tax shelters and the rorts. And now<br />
those with the greatest capacity to pay are paying their<br />
fair share of tax. There is now economic efficiency,<br />
fairness and decency in the tax system.<br />
At the same time on the other element of redistribution,<br />
the provision of help to the needy the conservatives<br />
freely allocated the nation's resources to those who had no<br />
justifiable call on them.<br />
They paid the pension and family assistance to millionaires<br />
no questions asked.<br />
Labor stopped all that and as a result we have<br />
concentrated more resources on low and middle income<br />
Australian families. </p>
<p>By reforming the tax system, better targeting welfare<br />
assistance, cracking down on welfare abuse and reducing<br />
unemployment, we have given ourselves the capacity to boost<br />
expenditure on social justice programs by a massive<br />
$ 9 billion per annum.<br />
Nothing is more fundamental to the creation of social<br />
justice of real equality of opportunity than education.<br />
Under the conservatives, obtaining a good education was<br />
mainly the prerogative of the wealthy. The conservatives<br />
did not require a fair contribution . to the public revenue<br />
from the wealthy, so they did not have the budgetary<br />
capacity to provide access to education for the less<br />
privileged. In the year before my Government to office, only 36 per cent<br />
of our children stayed on through high school. That was one<br />
of the lowest retention rates in the Western world; it was a<br />
blight on Australian society. Today, under the Labor<br />
Government, 60 per cent of children are getting a high<br />
school education and we will have that up to 65 per cent<br />
by the early 1990s<br />
and in their seven years, they only increased that<br />
rate by a miserable two per cent<br />
I repeat: 36 per cent under them, with an increase<br />
of two per cent; 60 per cent under us, with an<br />
increase of 24 per cent.<br />
The Labor Government has doubled high school education<br />
allowances for children from low and low-to-middle income<br />
families.<br />
And by the end of the current three-year education funding<br />
period, my Government will have created 150,000 new higher<br />
education places, compared with just 26,000 new places under<br />
the conservatives.<br />
Again, I'm not making this point as a history lesson.<br />
Rather it is a portent of things to come if the<br />
conservatives were to gain office again.<br />
Peacock's promise after he resumed the leadership of his<br />
party to make " a fairer, a more compassionate Australia"<br />
was exposed as a fraud by John Elliott's candid statement<br />
that the Liberals would take from the " bludgers" and give to<br />
the " workers".<br />
In their minds, as revealed in the Economic Action Plan,<br />
Aborigines, the long-term unemployed, newly arrived migrants<br />
and those who benefit from Australia's overseas aid are<br />
" bludgers". And those who pay Labor's capital gains tax are<br />
" workers".<br />
L </p>
<p>By the abolition of the capital gains tax the conservatives<br />
intend to hand to their supporters to their President,<br />
this same John Elliott to the one per cent of the<br />
taxpaying public paying any capital gains tax literally<br />
billions of dollars in revenue.<br />
By the revenue we have derived for the people from the<br />
reform of the tax system we have kept our kids in the<br />
education system. We put the kids of Australia before<br />
John Elliott and his ilk.<br />
Under Labor, with a capital gains tax, business investment<br />
has reached the highest proportion of GDP since records have<br />
been kept. In economic terms, abolishing the capital gains<br />
tax would pervert the rational allocation of resources by<br />
diverting investment out of productive, job creating areas<br />
into the maximisation of non-taxable capital gains.<br />
Let there be no misunderstanding: the conservatives, in one<br />
fell swoop, would bring about the most massive<br />
redistribution of income from the poor to the rich in this<br />
nation's history.<br />
This is grand larceny being paraded as responsible public<br />
policy. The redistribution equation is clear:<br />
Labor: fair taxation, allowing massive assistance to<br />
the needy, new opportunities in education, higher<br />
pensions, more help for low income families.<br />
Liberals: unfair taxation to benefit the well-off few,<br />
paid for by withdrawing the assistance now extended to<br />
the less privileged.<br />
I say none of this to suggest Labor can rest on its laurels<br />
in the creation of genuine social justice.<br />
There are challenges that still lie ahead and problems that<br />
must be confronted and resolved not just by one level of<br />
Government or by one group of people but by us all.<br />
In the 1970s Labor in government was concerned to ensure<br />
basic improvements to our overall standard of living,<br />
particularly in terms of water and sewerage.<br />
In the 1980s we have been concerned to ensure basic security<br />
of income, particularly by building a far stronger and<br />
sustainable economic base and removing the scars of long<br />
term unemployment.<br />
In the 1990s we should be concerned as to how we further<br />
improve on those gains by addressing the contemporary needs<br />
of Australians living and working in our communities. </p>
<p>Anyone who visits the fringes of our larger cities such as<br />
the outer western suburbs of Sydney where new homes and new<br />
suburbs are being built or the outskirts of our provincial<br />
towns must recognise the special problems caused by social<br />
isolation: the difficulties of distance to and from work; the<br />
need for access to necessary services such as child<br />
care; the education needs of our children; and the<br />
health risks of drug dependency and alcoholism.<br />
I am not talking about governments providing a program or<br />
service to deal with a problem when it reaches crisis<br />
conditions. It is a matter of providing what people need before problems<br />
become entrenched and reach unacceptable levels.<br />
Marriage counselling, drug and alcohol rehabilitation,<br />
recreational activities after school, family planning,<br />
financial advice are just a few examples of what people may<br />
require but at a level and location that ensures their<br />
accessibility. In essence, I want to see an approach that recognises the<br />
potential vulnerability which people can face throughout the<br />
life cycle birth and family formation; marriage and the<br />
potential for separation; work and the possibility of<br />
injury; ageing and the threat of redundancy.<br />
We have recognised this explicitly in our policy thrust to<br />
date. It needs to be reinforced and widened as we strive to<br />
improve the services that people need and that are made<br />
available. This cannot be done by the Federal Government alone. It can<br />
only be done by all three levels of Government working<br />
together to meet the needs of what we all require to live<br />
and work in better communities.<br />
It is this complex web of problems the issues. of social<br />
justice in the 1990s that I referred to when I addressed<br />
the ACOSS Congress in Melbourne a few weeks ago.<br />
I said that I wanted to see what more can be done, including<br />
by and with ACOSS, to build further on the gains we have<br />
made.<br />
As a result of those comments, ACOSS's new President,<br />
Merle Mitchell, has recently written to seek a meeting with<br />
me to discuss some of these issues.<br />
My office has today replied to set up a meeting for early<br />
December and I look forward to discussing these issues as<br />
one of the first steps in the task of setting our social<br />
justice priorities for the 1990s. </p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen,<br />
All these issues are of concern to those who currently make<br />
up the population of Australia. But our responsibility also<br />
embraces those who will inhabit Australia in generations to<br />
come. The decisions we make today will profoundly affect the life<br />
those future Australians lead.<br />
If we open the doors of opportunity now to women, to new<br />
migrants, to those who lack the privileges of wealth, we<br />
will be helping those immediate beneficiaries but, just as<br />
importantly, we will be creating a society that is<br />
enduringly fair and open.<br />
If we encourage citizenship, build the institutions and<br />
attitudes of multiculturalism, maintain the racially<br />
non-discriminatory character of our immigration program, we<br />
will be ensuring the Australia of the future is dynamic,<br />
free, diverse and yet united in commitment to our nation.<br />
But if we slam shut the door of opportunity, if we aspire to<br />
turn the immigration clock back to the attitudes of our<br />
unacceptable past, we'll be committing not just a morally<br />
repugnant act but an economically insane one.<br />
In the same way, where Labor practises ecologically<br />
sustainable development so as to bequeath to our children<br />
a rich natural heritage the conservatives explicitly<br />
pledge economy with virtually no regard for ecology.<br />
We have created jobs at twice the rate of the Western world<br />
but the World Heritage Bureau has also said recently that<br />
no country has done more to advance world heritage values<br />
than Australia. It's not a matter of economy versus<br />
ecology. We can have both. We must have both.<br />
Just look at the short but brutal environmental record of<br />
the Government here in New South Wales if you want to get<br />
any idea of how a Coalition Government would operate in<br />
Canberra driven by the ideologues of the Right: the<br />
Blunts, the Stones, the Morgans.<br />
This is merely. a reflection in New South Wales of the<br />
Liberals and National Party at the federal level. They have<br />
vehemently opposed our significant environmental decisions<br />
at every point the Franklin, Kakadu, Daintree, the forests<br />
of Tasmania and Wesley Vale. There is no limit to their<br />
capacity for environmental vandalism.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen,<br />
Let me finally return to the international responsibilities<br />
of Government to which I referred in my introductory<br />
comments about Evatt. </p>
<p>For here again the difference between Labor and the<br />
conservatives is stark.<br />
I believe Evatt would be immensely gratified to see the role<br />
Australia is playing today in the UN and in other<br />
multilateral forums in leading the Commonwealth's campaign<br />
against apartheid; in leading the Cairns Group's efforts to<br />
liberalise world trade; in initiating the moves to establish<br />
a vehicle for closer Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation; in<br />
hosting the recent Government Industry Conference against<br />
Chemical weapons; in seeking to protect the Antarctic from<br />
mining and to have that continent recognised as a natural<br />
reserve and land of science.<br />
Each of these activities stands alone as a significant and<br />
creative piece of Australian diplomacy. Together they prove<br />
our commitment and capacity to contribute to the resolution<br />
of critical global problems.<br />
At the same time we have urged the superpowers to abandon<br />
the attitudes of confrontation, and to work together towards<br />
a world at peace. In every available forum since 1983 we<br />
have been speaking to our allies, the United States, to the<br />
Soviet Union, and to China, urging them to work together<br />
towards peace.<br />
Nothing has given me greater pride as Prime Minister of this<br />
country than being told in Geneva by the Secretary-General<br />
of the Committee of Disarmament that if other governments of<br />
the world had done as much as my Government for the causes<br />
of peace and disarmament then those causes would be further<br />
advanced than they are.<br />
Put quite simply I am able to say to you tonight: the voice<br />
of Australia is heard in Washington, in Moscow, Europe,<br />
Africa, the Middle East, in the Commonwealth and in the<br />
United Nations, with a respect unequalled in our history.<br />
Against this proud fact, the conservatives have no vision<br />
for dealing with the international challenges and<br />
opportunities which face Australia.<br />
Their response to the Asia-Pacific economic challenge is the<br />
utterly impractical one of creating a trading bloc, although<br />
we have the authority of Mr Peacock's office for the fact<br />
that he does not know what a trading bloc is.<br />
Faced by the challenge to international decency posed by the<br />
apartheid system, Peacock has turned his back on<br />
Malcolm Fraser and on the rest of the Commonwealth. In<br />
rejecting " punitive" economic sanctions, he rejects any<br />
effective sanctions, notwithstanding the tremendous impact<br />
those sanctions are having on South Africa a fact<br />
acknowledged by South Africa's political and financial<br />
leaders. It is not hard to imagine the impact on<br />
Australia's international standing if a Peacock Government<br />
were to seek common cause in isolation with Mrs Thatcher. </p>
<p>11.<br />
The attitude of the conservatives in the face of the<br />
astonishing developments in the USSR and Eastern Europe has<br />
been paralytic. Whenever this Government has sought<br />
dialogue with the USSR, we have been greeted with a chorus<br />
of 1950s platitudes from the other side.<br />
As a former Foreign Minister, Andrew Peacock might have been<br />
expected to abandon the time warp which his predecessor<br />
produced as a so-called Foreign Policy platform in March<br />
this year, but it is unfortunately only too clear that he<br />
does not have the intellectual energy or the political will<br />
or clout to do so.<br />
Just as confrontationism has been, and remains, the<br />
characteristic of their domestic policies, so has it been in<br />
international affairs. Indeed they always see the<br />
international arena as a platform for projecting<br />
divisiveness at home. Vietnam was the classic illustration.<br />
So, my friends, the Federal Election to be fought within the<br />
next six months will determine whether Australia will revert<br />
to conservativism, conflict, injustice, the dog-eat-dog<br />
mentality of the early 1980s, where the privileged are<br />
rewarded for supporting the Liberals and the underprivileged<br />
are trampled under and labelled as bludgers or whether<br />
this country is going to continue its progress towards a<br />
prosperous, just and compassionate society, one with a rich<br />
environmental and social heritage, a country that plays a<br />
constructive and positive role in meeting the challenges of<br />
the modern world.<br />
The choice is stark.<br />
The stakes are huge, for our Labor movement and for the<br />
people of Australia.<br />
we simply cannot afford to let Australia succumb once more<br />
to the distorted priorities, the lost opportunities, the<br />
neglected challenges, that inevitably follow whenever the<br />
conservatives take over the reins of power.<br />
For the Liberals, fairness and equality of opportunity<br />
stability and productivity in the work place preservation<br />
of the best of the natural environment enmeshment with the<br />
challenges of the modern world all these are expendable,<br />
second-best goals, subsidiary to their main ambition of<br />
winning, and retaining power and exercising it for the<br />
benefit of their well-off supporters.<br />
For Labor they are goals that define the very purpose of<br />
power, values that are vital to our existence as a political<br />
force, priorities that must be achieved in the deepest<br />
interests of all Australians.<br />
By the time the next election is fought I will have been<br />
Prime Minister for some seven years longer than any Labor<br />
Prime Minister. </p>
<p>1<br />
ft 12.<br />
I had a fulfilling life before Parliament and I will after<br />
Parliament. But let me say this. I will fight the next election harder<br />
than any in my political career.<br />
For that election will be the most important since 1949.<br />
It will determine the nature and quality of the Australia we<br />
take into the 21st Century.<br />
I want that Australia to be a prosperous, competitive,<br />
compassionate and cohesive society, enmeshed in this dynamic<br />
region of the world and respected throughout the world.<br />
These things are worth fighting for.<br />
And let me reassure you when the time comes next year we<br />
will fight for them.<br />
And we will win. </p>
