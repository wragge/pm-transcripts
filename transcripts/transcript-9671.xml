PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING MP<br />
SPEECH AT LAUNCH OF ANZAC FRIGATE TE KAHA, WILLIAMSTOWN,<br />
SATURDAY, 22 JULY 1995<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
Thank you very much, John White ( Chief Executive, Transfield Defence<br />
Systems), Prime Minister Jim Bolger and Joan, I'm very pleased to see you in<br />
Australia on this occasion, our Defence Ministers Warren Cooper and Robert<br />
Ray, Carlo Salteri ( Transfield Chairman), Rear Admiral Walsh, the Hon Bill<br />
Baxter representing the Premier, parliamentary colleagues, members of the<br />
Defence Force, Ambassadors, High Commissioners, Reverend David North<br />
and Bishop Vercoe and ladies and gentlemen.<br />
One of the last things that was just said was that ANZAC was a class, it is the<br />
name of a class and, of course, as we in this country and New Zealand know,<br />
it has always been a class name. It has always stood for the world's best<br />
when it came to a fighting force and I don't believe there could be any greater<br />
manifestation of our co-operation or the kindred nature of our two countries<br />
than to be here for an historic launch of a collaborative project of this kind.<br />
The things we have always believed about our two countries the common<br />
ideals, the common culture, the threatres of war we fought in in defence of<br />
liberty all of these things, I think, are in evidence today in the fact that we<br />
have come together as nations in this collaborative exercise to build this<br />
class of ships bearing that proud name ANZAC. I am delighted to be here on<br />
this occasion for the launching of Te Kaha.<br />
It is, I think, a magnificent ship, state of the art and world class. One of the<br />
things, I am sure, that we do in Australia and New Zealand these days is<br />
build good ships and maybe this will have more fighting power than an<br />
America's Cup yacht, certainly more hitting power although no doubt we<br />
could commission them America's Cup yachts that is with some<br />
armaments. They would be a pretty fearful thing, but this, I think, represents<br />
as good as it is likely to be world wide. </p>
<p>What is important, I think, about this is a recognition by Australia and New<br />
Zealand that in our own defence we need these capacities and capabilities.<br />
The thing about this ship which will be true of no other, or very few we've had<br />
in the past, is that it will be serviced here in Australasia because it is built<br />
here in Australasia and one of the things about our defence will now be that<br />
we will focus on our regional strengths, our industrial capabilities, our<br />
capacity for research and development, for design not simply of ships but of<br />
combat systems and weapon systems because with the finish of the Cold<br />
War what we are now seeing, where once everything was international ised,<br />
what we are now seeing is the regionalisation of difficulties, where regional<br />
tensions come to the fore and where countries organise themselves<br />
regionally. I think this is something which we are doing. We are building a naval ship<br />
building capacity like this here in Australasia and, of course, in Australia's<br />
case we also have a submarine program, we will soon have the Mine Hunter<br />
Program and the hydrographic ship. There is a real core naval capacity<br />
being built here and one that I think must be comforting to the peoples of<br />
Australia and New Zealand, that this capacity exists within our countries. Of<br />
course, we have built this and we have innovated the design and developed<br />
further the weapon systems, but I think it also reminds us of our important<br />
linkages to Europe. John White and Carlo Salteri have already mentioned<br />
Blohm and Voss the Naval architects and let me also mention Celsius<br />
Tech the Swedish Company that designed the combat systems in which we<br />
have been able to augment.<br />
But, beyond all that what I would like to do is to congratulate Transfield on<br />
putting together this capacity to develop these ships, to be able to produce<br />
them at this quality and on time. This is a great compliment to them as a<br />
company and to the workforce of these yards that they could harness these<br />
skills and give such commitment and such pride to the building of such a<br />
vessel. Without them, of course, this ship wouldn't be here and we need to<br />
think about them and to thank them.<br />
I would like to, just again, dwell on the major point that having an Australian<br />
and New Zealand Prime Minister together at the launch of a ship in which we<br />
are involved collaboratively, I think, says again much about our relationship,<br />
says how seriously we regard the first duty of any government and that is to<br />
make certain of the security of its people and to have a competent Defence<br />
Force. With this Defence Force here today, the Defence Force of our<br />
countries in Australia and New Zealand, will see this augmentation coming<br />
here today and I am very proud to be involved. I'd like to again, congratulate<br />
everybody concerned and most particularly wish Te Kaha well and, of course,<br />
naturally and especially all who will sail in her. Thank you.<br />
