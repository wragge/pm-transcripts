    <content><![CDATA[<p>I was saddened to learn of the death today of Sir Roland Wilson, one of Australia's greatest public servants. </p>
<p>Sir Roland was a distinguished Secretary of the Treasury between 1951 and 1966. He served his country in a variety of capacities in both peace and war. He was a pioneer in the field of applied economics and brought both erudition and common sense to policy making. </p>
<p>He made a key contribution to the transition of the Australian economy after World War 11 and the management of an unparalleled period of economic growth and development in the 1950s and 1960s. </p>
<p>Sir Roland Wilson was born in Tasmania in 1904 and was a graduate of the University of Tasmania. He was the Rhodes Scholar for Tasmania in 1925 and earned a Doctorate of Philosophy in Economics from Oxford University. Remarkably, he went on to earn a Doctorate of Philosophy from the University of Chicago. </p>
<p>After a short academic career, he entered the public service in 1932. He established and directed the Commonwealth Department of Labour and National Service between 1940 and 1946. He was subsequently Commonwealth Statistician and Economic Adviser to the Treasury. He also served as Chairman of the Economic and Employment Commission of the United Nations in 1948/ 49. In 1951 he was appointed Secretary of the Commonwealth Treasury. After his retirement from the Treasury in 1966, he was Chairman of the Commonwealth Banking Corporation and Qantas. </p>
<p>Sir Roland was ail important member of a unique group of public servants who helped to transform Australia into a modern industrial economy after the Second World War. His commitment to nation building and selfless public service is an example to which we can all aspire. </p>
<p>He is survived by his wife, Joyce, to whom Janette and I extend our deepest sympathies.</p>
<p>24 October 1996 </p>
