    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Prime Minister joined the Member for Groom, John McVeigh, in Toowoomba today to view the progress of the Toowoomba Second Range Crossing (TSRC) project.</p>
<p>Work began on the 41km-long bypass route between Warrego Highway and Gore Highway in April last year when the Turnbull Government provided more than $1.1 billion toward TSRC project.</p>
<p>“The Toowoomba Second Range Crossing project will have huge long-term benefits for the region bringing $2.4 billion over 30 years in economic and productivity gains for business and industry,” said the Prime Minister.</p>
<p>Opening in late 2018, the TSRC project will greatly improve liveability for the residents of Toowoomba and the Lockyer Valley. It will reduce pressure on local roads by removing trucks from Toowoomba’s CBD and suburbs, including over-sized and dangerous goods vehicles.</p>
<p>“The project is providing 1,800 jobs during the design and construction phase,” said Dr McVeigh. “When complete, the crossing will significantly increase the movement of freight along the national road network and reduce travel time across the Toowoomba Range by up to 40 minutes.”</p>
<p>This new bypass is on budget and on track for opening late-2018.</p>
<p>“Toowoomba is Australia’s second largest inland city and I am looking forward to seeing this great city continuing to prosper with the help of the additional investment in infrastructure provided by the Government,” said the Prime Minister.</p>
