Prime Minister Julia Gillard and Victorian Premier John Brumby today officially opened a new State Emergency Services headquarters in Marysville, marking another important milestone in the bushfire recovery process in Victoria.</p>
<p>Ms Gillard and Mr Brumby were joined by emergency services volunteers and the Marysville community to open the new headquarters and hand over a new rescue truck to the town's SES crew.</p>
<p>Ms Gillard said the Australian Government would continue to stand by those affected by the worst natural disaster in the nation's history and support them as they rebuild their lives, homes and communities.</p>
<p>The Marysville community and others affected by the Black Saturday bushfires have shown remarkable fortitude since the tragic day on 7 February 2009.</p>
<p>Ms Gillard said the volunteers in Marysville had the admiration and support of all Australians.</p>
<p>Many of the people volunteering in Marysville were affected by the Black Saturday fires, yet at a time of personal crisis, they chose to work selflessly for their neighbours. The entire nation continues to be amazed by their strength and community spirit.</p>
<p>The new $428,000 VICSES headquarters at Marysville replaces the original building which was virtually destroyed in the bushfires.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister and Premier handed the Marysville VICSES unit crew the keys to a new $55,000 rescue vehicle, funded through community fundraising and donations.</p>
<p>They also presented two Marysville VICSES volunteers with medals in recognition of their long service.</p>
<p>"The new truck is in addition to a $200,000 rescue truck the unit received last year from the State Government," Mr Brumby said.</p>
<p>"People from across Victoria, Australia and indeed all over the world have rallied behind communities affected by the Black Saturday fires and this truck is a great example of their ongoing generosity.</p>
<p>"The re-opening of the VICSES headquarters is an important step in the rebuilding and recovery of the community and builds on achievements including the Marysville Central Shopping, the Marysville Primary School and the re-opening of several businesses in the main street.</p>
<p>"We know volunteers like the VICSES are the lifeblood of our communities. Our Government is providing Victoria's emergency services volunteers with record support and will continue to ensure they are equipped with the resources they need to protect their communities," Mr Brumby said.</p>
<p>Parliamentary Secretary for Victorian Bushfire Reconstruction Bill Shorten said that the Australian Government was committed to rebuilding Marysville and supporting its residents.</p>
<p>"Given the scale of the destruction, Marysville has achieved an incredible amount in just over 15 months, but there is still a long way to go and we will continue to help this community as it renews itself," Mr Shorten said.</p>
<p>The Australian and Victorian Governments have put in place a $193 million plan which is driving the economic and social recovery of communities across Victoria.</p>
<p>The Rebuilding Together plan set out the rebuilding priorities which have been driven by local communities, to rebuild their essential town buildings and services, to generate business growth and investment and to rehabilitate key local attractions central to their future prosperity.</p>
<p>The $193 million Rebuilding Together plan delivered:</p>
<p> * 	$93.4 million to support people and communities rebuild through ongoing accommodation support, counselling services and rebuilding key community assets including upgrading more than 20 community halls, building new community centres and restoring sports and recreation facilities, parks, gardens, walking and cycling trails;<br />
 * 	$60.5 million to build new multipurpose facilities that will improve education and recreation services in Kinglake, Flowerdale, Callignee and Marysville including a new primary school in Strathewen, a new Marysville Police Station and a new Marysville community centre which brings together the primary school and early childhood services.<br />
 * 	$21.6 million to assist small business to return to pre-fire operating levels, new tourism marketing campaigns, new National and State Park facilities and the restoration of the iconic Lake Mountain Alpine Resort as a major tourism destination; and<br />
 * 	$17.5 million to rehabilitate the environment including urgent action to protect threatened species and habitats, regenerate state forests, help farmers and landholders restore their land and repair critical waterways and catchments. </p>
