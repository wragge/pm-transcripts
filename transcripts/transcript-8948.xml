TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING, MP<br />
DOORSTOP, TURRAMURRA, SYDNEY, FRIDAY, 27 AUGUST, 1993<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
J: Morning, Prime Minister. What ground are you prepared to give on the Budget<br />
to appease the union movement?<br />
PM: Well, look, the Budget is like many other things I think the Government has<br />
done over the ye--rs, and that is, that we want to meet a set of objectives, at the<br />
same time where we think that there are real problems with some of the<br />
measures, we can see in which way they may be amended or varied, provided<br />
that the strategy and the substance of the Government's fiscal policy is there. I<br />
mean, remember this, that the Government had a mandate to reduce marginal<br />
rates of taxation, secured a mandate for that, and also to bring the Budget<br />
deficit down. Now people are entitled to have their views about how that might<br />
best be done, and Governments listen, generally, we do listen to people. Now<br />
in the middle 1980s when I introduced many tax changes, I varied many of<br />
them, but kept the sense them things like tax on motor cars, or the way the<br />
fringe benefits tax operated or many other things. Provided that they are<br />
sensible then the Government will consider them.<br />
J: Are they sensible, the demands they are making?<br />
PM.-Well, I mean, again it is a matter or some are, and some may not be consistent<br />
wth our strategy. But the Government has a commitment to bring the Budget<br />
deficit down for the good of the whole country, and at the same time reduce<br />
marginal rates of taxation. Now I am sure we can meet all these objectives, it is<br />
only a matter, I think, of having some sense about it. It is because of the sort of<br />
balance of numbers in the Senate that this year these kind of changes have<br />
taken on a bigger moment then they would have in other years. That doesn't<br />
mean they are less legitimate.<br />
J: ( inaudible)<br />
PM: The Labor Council of NSW is entitled to its view about these things, but the<br />
best way to deal with the Government in the Accord is to deal with it<br />
persuasively. And that is, talk to us in private and not in public. </p>
<p>J: Is this union revolt threatening the Accord?<br />
PM: No.<br />
J: Does the ACTUs, opposition to the Budget reforms make it more likely the<br />
Government will compromise with the Democrats?<br />
PM. No. Let me just make this clear. Now look, Senator Kemnot is the leader of a<br />
minor party in the Senate, she is entitled to a view. But the Government will be<br />
governing, I mean we wAIl talk to the Democrats as we are talking to other<br />
organisations and bodies. And we will, a week has gone by now, get the gist of<br />
peoples objections and try and understand them. And to see in which ways<br />
we can redesign some of the changes so that the sense and integrity of the<br />
Budget is there. So the Democrats will be dealt with, appropriately and<br />
sensibly. But again, It will be the Government deciding about its budget as<br />
Governments should.<br />
J: Mr Keating, the Democrats do seem to be a force to be reckoned with over the<br />
budget. In your view, are they?<br />
PM: Not in all the years that I have been a Minister did the Government have control<br />
of the Senate. And it was my job to pilot many other changes through the<br />
Senate, and with the Democrats of those days. And it is like everything else, I<br />
mean, we will get there.<br />
J: Mr Keating, isn't it time for a wholesale change to the Budget given that it has<br />
been attacked from so many quarters, and within the Labor Party?<br />
PM: That is just another way of asking what other people have asked. No, the<br />
government has got a mandate to reduce the Budget deficit and reduce the<br />
incidence of tax. I mean people need to remember that we are talking about<br />
people be-tween $ 20,000 and $ 50,000. With the bulk of the people around<br />
$ 25,000-35,000. Now despite what Senator Kernot says these people are not<br />
wealthy people, this Is absolutely middle Australia and that's why I think the<br />
commitments which we have given them on tax are important. But why again,<br />
we want to govern sensibly so that when these changes are in and fiscal policy<br />
Is Improved so that we can see more employment, we will try and get the<br />
balances right.<br />
J: What does it say about the power of the Democrats though? Until Wednesday<br />
you were saying that the budget was pretty much non-negotiable, now you are<br />
negotiating<br />
PM: Well I don't think that a Government should ever say, well the moment someone<br />
first raises one note of criticism, ok, we will go and change things. But again,<br />
we have always has negotiations in the Senate in some of the measures,<br />
always.<br />
J: But do you think they do have a renewed power at the moment? </p>
<p>PM: No, no I don't. I mean they have got minor party status in the Senate and they<br />
will be dealt with appropriately, courteously by us.<br />
J: Can you just explain something of the split which is developing between the<br />
union movement and the Government?<br />
PM: Well I don't think there is a split developing. It is just the fact that on this<br />
occasion people have been more vocal, perhaps than past. And they think<br />
because there is a view by some Senators that they have common ground on<br />
some of these things, that they can perhaps more noisily put their point of view.<br />
J: Does it worry you that Michael Easson has written to Senator Kemnot and Brian<br />
Harradine and called on them to reject certain aspects of the budget?<br />
PM: Well I think evoking the Senate to use its powers against the Government and<br />
the House of Representatives is a very un-Labor like thing to do. And I don't<br />
think that he should be doing that. But that is not to say that he is not entited to<br />
a point of view and that point of view may coincide with other peoples point of<br />
view.<br />
