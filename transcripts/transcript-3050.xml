AUSTRALIAN-INDONESIAN RELATIONS VISIT<br />

The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Whitlam,<br />
announced today before his departure for visits to Japan<br />
and China that the Indonesian Foreign Minister, Mr Adam Malik,<br />
will visit Australia from 6-10 November as a guest of the<br />
Australian Government. Mr Malik will be accompanied by<br />
O Mrs Malik. Mr Whitlam said that Mr Malik's visit will be<br />
his fourth to Australia. He visited here in December 1967,<br />
as leader of the Indonesian delegation to the memorial<br />
service in Melbourne for the late Prime Minister, Mr Harold<br />
Holt; in April 1968, to lead the Indonesian delegation<br />
to the 24th Session of the Economic Commission for Asia and<br />
the Far East ( ECAFE) in Canberra, following which he held<br />
discussions with the Australian Government; and in February<br />
1972, when he accompanied President SLharto on his State<br />
Visit to Australia. Mr Vhitlam said Mr Malik would be a very welcome<br />
visitor. His visit would provide yet another opportunity<br />
to continue the close and constructive dialogue, at a high<br />
level, that had developed between the two countries on matters<br />
of mutual interest. Following his visit to Australia,<br />
Mr Malik will visit Papua New Guinea as a guest of the Papua.<br />
New Guinea Government. / 2 </p>

Mr Malik's visit will, he said, follow the second<br />
in the series of annual consultations between senior<br />
Australian and Indonesian officials on foreign policy matters<br />
of common interest to be held in Canberra on 6-7 November.<br />
11r Whitlan recalled that the first round of annual<br />
talks had been held in Jakarta in Aug,_ ust 1972, as a result<br />
of a decision by the Australian and Indonesian Governments<br />
during President Suharto's visit to Australia in February<br />
1972, that the two countries should keep in close touch<br />
through freqi-ent a: nd frank consultations. The Jakarta talks<br />
had been most successful and officials were looking forward<br />
to a useful exchange of views in the forthcoming discussions<br />
on such matters as developments in the South East Asian<br />
region and Australian-Indonesian bilateral relations.<br />
The Australian delegation would be let by the<br />
Secretary of the Department of Foreign Affairs, Sir Keith<br />
Waller, who also led the Australia~ n delegation to<br />
the first round of talks. The Indonesian delegation will be<br />
led by Mr Djajadiningrat, the Director-General of Political<br />
Affairs in the Indonesian Department of Foreign Affairs. </p>
