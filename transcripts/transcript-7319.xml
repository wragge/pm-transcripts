UM PRIME MINISTER<br />
CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
OPENING OF THE NEW PARLIAMENT HOUSE<br />
CANBERRA 9 MAY 1988<br />
Your majesty<br />
Your Royal Highness<br />
Excellencies Ladies and Gentlemen<br />
At a time like this each one of us will have some thoughts<br />
of the ghosts, or spirits, of the past.<br />
At the most remote level, we are reminded by the historians<br />
and archaeologists that this region has nurtured human<br />
habitation for at least 21,000 years. The aboriginal<br />
civilisation and culture that developed from those earliest<br />
times was so quickly disrupted after the arrival of European<br />
settlers that we do not even know with precision what they<br />
meant by their word.-" Canberra". Certainly, one version is<br />
that it meant a meeting place. So it seems that this place,<br />
by its geography and the actions of its inhabitants has been<br />
a natural meeting place for countless generations.<br />
But we think too of more recent spirits. We think of those<br />
in the first abode of the Parliament of the Commonwealth<br />
the first twen ty-seven years in Melbourne's Legislative<br />
Council building so many of them the giants of the<br />
Federation con~ ventions which gave birth to our nation.<br />
We think then of those who over the next sixty-one years<br />
have graced what surely must be one of the more durable<br />
" temporary" Parliament Houses in the history of democracy.<br />
The names are too legion to mention. But they are certainly<br />
not for us all ghosts or spirits as the robust presence<br />
today of Whitlam, Gorton, Daly, Killen and Anthony so well<br />
testi fy.<br />
I do, however, mention one who for so long dominated our<br />
long-time te mporary residence. I believe the spirit of Sir<br />
Robert Menzies, whose commitment to the concept of Canberra<br />
as a truly great national capital should be respected across<br />
the political spectrum, would be smiling with approval<br />
today. 00319 </p>
<p>2.<br />
These intimations of our mortality and the presence of the<br />
Treasurer remind us of the paradoxical truth that in life<br />
the only certainties are death and taxes.<br />
And so it is true that just as we have looked with some<br />
wonderment at Tom Roberts' ' remarkable painting of the guests<br />
and members in the first Parliament in Melbourne, so future<br />
generations will look at photographs and films of today,<br />
remark on the quaintness of our style and costume, and ask<br />
of us " What was in their minds on that momentous<br />
occasion?" And what will our answer be?<br />
I hope it would be something like this:<br />
That we have a feeling of deep gratitude to all who are<br />
responsible for this great and imaginative building<br />
to those who conceived and designed it, to-all who by<br />
the labour of their mind and body have made it the<br />
remarkable reality it is.<br />
That we do feel a sense of history and indebtedness to<br />
those who have fought in war, and in peace, to ensure<br />
the survival and the enlargement of the democratic<br />
principle. That we understand the danger of taking for granted the<br />
continuing survival of this principle in a world where<br />
so many people have succumbed or been subjected to<br />
despots to whom the concept of a parliament of the<br />
people is anathema.<br />
That we therefore understand the awesome obligation<br />
that is upon us. . For those in the new Parliament this<br />
will be an obligation to recognise always in the<br />
conduct of debate that whatever their views, their<br />
ideology, their Party, they are part of something<br />
bigger an institution which must endure long after<br />
the divisive issues of the day have been fought and<br />
resolved.<br />
That. because we know we will discharge that obligation<br />
thi-6 building will become for our nation both the forum<br />
for our differences and the instrument of our unity a<br />
building for all Australians, a Parliament reflecting<br />
the diversity of our entire society and responding to<br />
the needs of the whole community.<br />
Your Majesty<br />
Your Royal Highness<br />
Excellencies Ladies and Gentlemen<br />
If these things are indeed in our minds today then it will<br />
be a worthy answer to that question that may be asked about<br />
us when we are all long gone. 0O0 632 0 </p>
<p>3.<br />
For none of us can now foretell with any precision all the<br />
issues which will confront the Parliament of Australia in<br />
its new home in the centuries ahead.<br />
We face rapid, dramatic change in. all areas of our national<br />
life and in the wider world. The ' challenge of adaptation<br />
will be great, the problems often complex, the decisions<br />
difficult. But we do know this to be true. This new meeting place,<br />
this Parliament, like the old, represents that principle of<br />
government indeed the only principle of government<br />
capable of meeting, and mastering, that challenge. 006321 </p>
