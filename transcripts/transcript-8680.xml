PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF TIlE PRIME MINISTER THE liON P J KEATING, MP<br />
DOORSTOP HMAS MELBOURNE<br />
29 SEPTEMBER 1992<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF ONLY<br />
J: Prime Minister there are three days to go in this campaign, have you left the run a<br />
bit late to campaign here?<br />
PM: I have been down here earlier, but the thing is the future is about Victoria and I<br />
think what you are seeing here today at this dock yard, which I might say the<br />
Premier has had a very large interest in, is part of the new manufacturing of<br />
Australia. I have just had the Navy tell me that this ship is a no fault ship. That is<br />
it has been delivered without faults, it's probably the cleanest new vessel of its type<br />
handed over surpassing American built same-class ships which says a lot about<br />
manufacturing industry and it is done with cooperation bctween Govcrnment and<br />
private business in Australia. It has been built by AMECON, a private company,<br />
but it has been done in partnership with the Governnent, with the trade unions,<br />
with the community of Williamstown and the atmosphere in this yard. The pride<br />
in this yard is what has produced this ship under time, on budget, and with quality<br />
which surpascs anything you could compare it with.<br />
J: Will that translate into votes for the Kirner Goveruncnt, Mr Keating?<br />
PM: Well the thing is I think it Is a matter of whether you take that view of the world,<br />
which the Premier takes, or whether you say, look we don't want a ship building.<br />
yard we will just leave it to the open market, we will let the Americans have this.<br />
So you let the market work, absolutely: knock off Williamstown, kick the people<br />
out of the ship yard, let the Americans build the ships; that would be the view of<br />
the liberal Party. Now it is not a view we accept and it is the same with motor </p>
<p>cars. As you know, I have been to the Toyota plant in the last week or so in Japan,<br />
and with thc Premier 1 had the plcasure of officiating at the opening of the<br />
construction phase of this plant, and I think it is thc difference between the Labor<br />
Party which wants to bring the community with it to do good things for Australia,<br />
good things for Victoria, as distinct from a Governnment and a Party which<br />
basically believes in text book capitalism, which went out with straw hats.<br />
J: Prime Minister that Mrs Kirner can not win this election?<br />
PM; Well I think with every elcction you are in there with a chance right to the very<br />
end.<br />
J: You don't share the former Prime Minister's view?<br />
I'm: No I don't. I think Joan hazs campaigned like a veteran in this and she has had a<br />
hard road to hoe, it is hard governing States or any area of the country at times of<br />
economic recession and with a difficult structural change going on as well, but the<br />
changes which I think the Premier has been able to make in Victoria have becn<br />
important in the long run for the public of Victoria and this is not less so than a<br />
place like Williamstown.<br />
So you believe shte has done thc hard work necessary to get back in on October 3?<br />
PM: Well site has done the things within her power, that's the thing, and done it to the<br />
bcst of her ability, and with style.<br />
J: Primec Minister what abo~ ut Arvi Parbo's letter this morning, what's your attitude to<br />
that?<br />
PM: Well I think that he is making a point, that's fair enough. But I think probably Sir<br />
AMv would be a little worried if policy changes in his area of industry were about<br />
to wipe him out. You see it is all very well saying to the car companies, please be<br />
relaxed as the Opposition contemplates working you out, pop your valium tablet,<br />
be relaxcd as you go to the slaughter yard, I am sure they will take Arvi's advice<br />
well, but probably won't accept it.<br />
J: Prime Minister in 1990 you were saying that you were more prone to reductions in<br />
tariffs then Senlator Button was, and yet now you seem to have changed<br />
PM: No, no our line is totally consistent. That was the high tariffs, 253 per cent for<br />
motor vehicles and these things couldn't obtain, the Australian people getting very<br />
dear vehicles, the efficiencies of -the plants weren't there they had to come down.<br />
But they can't come down to the point where they don't exist, it is a matter of<br />
finding that nice balance and Siving industries time and giving themi consistency<br />
and see the clear points made by Toyota, in the last week in Japan, is that they will </p>
<p>build and comnpete and export from Australia with a modest level of tariff, but they<br />
can't do it with nothing.<br />
J: Isn't it correct though that Australian manufacturers havc had two decades<br />
virtually to prepare for reductions in tariffs and there productivity hasn't increased<br />
markedly?<br />
PM: T'hcy had a Mlug of a Government that left themi the way it left them with these<br />
high tariffs. I mncan tariffs went up under the Liberals, under the Fraser<br />
Government, which Dr Illewson was advising, It needs to be remembered that<br />
during the Fraser years tariff protection actually went up, the was no<br />
encouragement from a coalition Government to improve thc efficiency of<br />
Australia and as usual it has always got to be done by us. But again what we do is<br />
the thoughtful balanced thing, not the unthoughtful ideological thing.<br />
J. Premier, call I just ask you, would you have liked to have seen more of Mr Keating<br />
in this campaign?<br />
JK: I always enjoy working with Mr Keating bul his visit to Japan was very important<br />
because what it did was illustrate the difference between ourselves and the<br />
Opposition, and showed quite clearly that if you want a Government that is<br />
committed to the future of manufacturing industry and partnerships with unions<br />
and the private sector then you vote for a Kimer Government or later you vote for<br />
a Keating Government. You do not risk the recovery that is coming with Kennett<br />
economics or Hewson economics.<br />
is there a liability to him or vice versa?<br />
JK: We'll I don't think that is our view, is it?<br />
PM: I don't think that, in fact with a very difficult brief Joan has coped with it, not only<br />
as valiantly as any leader could, but with a confidence which I think has piade life<br />
much bectter in terms of attitudes in Victoria then would havc necessarily obtained.<br />
J Will Labor's performancc here determinc when you go federally?<br />
PM: We have got plenty of time to work that out. State elections arc State elections ill<br />
the end, mostly they are fought on State issues, we will make our judgements<br />
about things, I think that iii this country the public expects to get value from the<br />
Parliaments and they expect them to run their course.<br />
J: Is there a chance that you will. go before Christmas?<br />
PM: Ask silly questions and you get silly answers. </p>
<p>4<br />
J: Premiecr would it surprise you to bear that in one rcent poll apparently thc gap<br />
between LAbo~ r and the Coalition narrowed to 7.5 pcr cent?<br />
JK: No it would not in certain seats. But really the poll that counts is on election day<br />
and I think there is a lot of change taking place, when you get, though I don't think<br />
channiel 9 or 7 cov'ered it really well yesterday, the Oppositions spokesperson on<br />
the audit group, that is Mr Des Moore, saying he is going to take 25 000 jobs out<br />
of thc public setor people realisc that there will be no fun or future in a Kennett<br />
run ccononiy.<br />
J: what your own polling says thc gap is?<br />
JK: No I don't talk about polling at this interviews, you know that. But the real poll<br />
that matters is Saturday.<br />
PM: There's onc thing for sure there will be 25 000 public servants at least voting for<br />
Mrs Kirner, they're the 25 000 that face the chop under Mr Moore. I have bad Mr<br />
Moore, he ha-. worked for me, you sec he worked for me, so I know allI about Mr<br />
Moore and I know all about the 25 000.<br />
