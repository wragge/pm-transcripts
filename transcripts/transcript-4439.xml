Cabinet has agreed that a second position of Secretary to<br />
Cabinet be created and that it be held by Mr G. J. Yeend, C. B. E,<br />
Deputy Secretary, Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet.<br />
The present Secretary to Cabinet is Mr A. T. Carmody, C. B. E.,<br />
Secretary, Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet.<br />
There has been an increasing workload on the Cabinet and<br />
Cabinet Committee side evident for some time and increasing<br />
activity in committees and other responsibility at permanent<br />
head level associated with Cabinet. The creation of a second<br />
position of Secretary to Cabinet will enable some sharing of<br />
workload and responsibilities between the two Secretaries. </p>
