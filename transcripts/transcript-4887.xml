many animals are inconspicuous. They are naturally thin<br />
on the ground. They live in remote and thinly-populated<br />
areas, even uninhabited districts. They can live or die,<br />
flourish or decline. They can disappear from the face of<br />
the earth unnoticed. The same thanks to the diligence of<br />
the Australian media cannot be said of our politicians.<br />
Sometimes I wish this wasn't the case.<br />
I have noted that one press commentator suggested a few days<br />
ago somewhat tongue in cheek that Malcolm Fraser, rather<br />
than being a conservationist, was " A Man of Extinction". Can<br />
I gently take issue with that?<br />
Since coming to office my Government has been actively engaged<br />
in preserving the environment for some previously endangered<br />
species not referred to by Professor Ovington. Three that<br />
come to mind were, up until just a couple of years ago, under<br />
grave threat of extinction:-the blue collared hard worker<br />
bird; the enterprising business bird, both the " lesser" and<br />
the " greater"; and the resolute rural bird, now enjoying one<br />
of its most prolific seasons-for many years. / 2 </p>

More recently a not so welcome species has appeared the<br />
noisy knocker. I believe this particular species will remain<br />
fairly isolated in an enviornment where a spirit of<br />
optimism, confidence and belief in the future of Australia<br />
is now returning. But turning to those species that are<br />
dealt with in Derrek Ovington's book, I believe as a nation<br />
we . have begun to appreciate the existing and potential values<br />
of wildlife.<br />
As the variety of living things diminishes, these values<br />
are eroded and the human environment suffers. It is a tragedy<br />
that for many of our native species the concern now evident<br />
in the community for their survival came too late.<br />
I recall that many years ago in the late 1950' s I<br />
expressed concern in the Party Room that the Princess Alexandra<br />
Parrot was in danger of extinction. How tragic, I thought,<br />
to lose such a rare and beautiful bird one with such<br />
royal plumage. Because of its beauty, the Princess Alexandra<br />
Parrot was highly prized by overseas aviarists.. I was<br />
determined that this repulsive and shadmetul trade in birds<br />
should stop. Subsequently, I was delighted to learn in<br />
about November 1959 that the then Minister for Customs,<br />
Senator Henty, had convinced Cabinet that the export of not<br />
only the Princess Alexandra Parrot, but all native birds,<br />
should be banned. That policy still applies today.<br />
Conservation at that time was something of a dirty word,<br />
it was not a popular issue. But the ban was a start. From<br />
it the conservation movement went from strength to strength.<br />
It now commands, as it rightly should, vast popular support.<br />
The establishment of the Australian Conservation Foundation<br />
in 1965 was a landmark in the movement. I was proud to be<br />
a founding member.<br />
Australia is setting high standards of nature conservation.<br />
This is evident from the leading role we play in the<br />
International Union for the Conservation of Nature and<br />
Natural Resources.<br />
Austaliahas signed the Washington Convention on Trade<br />
in endangered species. The Convention for the conservation<br />
of Antarctic seals, and the Convention for the world cultural<br />
and natural heritage.<br />
Australia was the first party to the Convention on Wetlands<br />
of International Importance especially as waterfowl habitat.<br />
Australia and Japan have signed a joint agreement for the<br />
protection of migratory birds'.<br />
Furthermore, my Government has welcomed the establishment of<br />
voluntary conservation bodies, and we have actively supported<br />
the setting up of the World Wildlife Fund in Australia. ./ 3 </p>
<p>-3<br />
The Commonwealth and the States are setting aside significant<br />
areas of land and sea to make sure sufficient habitat remains<br />
for the survival of native plants and animals. The larges~ t<br />
and latest example is the Kakadu National Park which it is<br />
hoped will be proclaimed shortly.<br />
Because of my Government's concern we established the inquiry<br />
into the Australian whaling industry. It is expected to<br />
report shortly.<br />
Where special assistance for certain species is required, the<br />
Commonwealth Government is co-operating with the relevant State<br />
governments in joint conservation projects. This has been the<br />
case in saving the Bridled Nail-tailed Wallaby in Queensland<br />
and the Yellow-helmeted Honeyeater in Victoria.<br />
In 1976, I launched the Australian National Parks and Wildlife<br />
Service's first major campaign directed towards the protection<br />
of endangered species a series of pamphlets on endangered<br />
animals.<br />
The preparation of these pamphlets has involved close co-operation<br />
not only between Commonwealth and State Government agencies, but<br />
also with natural history societies and interested individuals.<br />
I am delighted that the Service, under the direction of<br />
Professor Ovington, has extended the work even further with<br />
the production of this volume on Australian endangered species.<br />
It is to be hoped that more volumes will be written, dealing<br />
with other groups of animals and plants.<br />
It is axiomatic that with increased knowledge comes increased<br />
responsibility. Derrick Ovington's book contributes greatly<br />
to our knowledge. Through it, I trust, future generations will<br />
judge us as having properly responded to the challenge of<br />
conserving our wildlife an irreplacable part of our natural<br />
heritage. I commend this fine book to you. </p>
