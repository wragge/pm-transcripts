FOR PRESS NOVEMBER 25, 1975<br />
MR WHITLAM DODGES THE ISSUES<br />
Mr Whitlam is attempting to ignore the basic bread and butter<br />
issues which affect the everyday lives of Australians.<br />
He is behaving as if all the sins of his government never<br />
existed. He is behaving like a man living in another world certainly<br />
not in Australia.<br />
Our policy will be devoted to the future to the solution of'<br />
Australia" oproblems.<br />
It will spell out the hard work and effort that will be required<br />
by the incoming Liberal National Country Party Government to<br />
0 promote recovery and pay off the huge debts built up in three<br />
years of Labor rule..<br />
Our policies will restore to Australia to responsibility, together<br />
with a sense of purpose and direction.<br />
That is the great contrast between us.<br />
We can make Australia one promise that Mr Whitlam can never match<br />
in a thousand years a promise of honesty and responsibility in<br />
government. So far, Mr Whitlam is attempting to campain on the basis that<br />
rhetoric will hide essential facts from the people.<br />
The facts are that it is Mr Whitlam himself who is guilty of<br />
threatening democracy through his attempt to govern without<br />
parliamentary approval. L / 2 </p>

It was Mr Whitlam w4hb intended to take over the bank deposits<br />
of ordinary -people and use them to pay the government's debts.<br />
It was Mr Whitlam who defied the Parliament, which inc~ ludes the<br />
Governor-General and the Senate.<br />
Hie spoke of the Parliament as if. it were only himself.<br />
The record slums that. Mr Whitlam' a ultimate objectives included<br />
the elimination, of theState Government and the abolition of<br />
the Senata.<br />
Since last.: night it is'also clear that he now wants a<br />
puppet Governor-General rather than a man who will honourably*<br />
execute that : of fice..<br />
If these objectives aeachieved by Mr Whitlam we-will be well@<br />
down the road. not to democracy but to dictatorship..<br />
There is. no-threat to demcracy because the people are-being'<br />
givyen the opportunity to vote and to judge. Hfis whole speech<br />
revolved around this non-issue.<br />
Hewas ausg. us -of. the.-sin that he himself conmitted.<br />
What the people want to know and understand is how unemployment<br />
is.. to be overcxree, how inflation will be brought under control,,<br />
how-' schooL_ leavers caa get jobs; how small businesses9 will..<br />
survive: how Investment will take off again,. how -new raining<br />
and oil search projects will be undertaken in partnership with<br />
Australians,.--Mr Whitlam ignored the young people who can no<br />
longer buy hcmes* ' he -ignored the elderly and the retired who are<br />
being destroyed by iif lation.<br />
