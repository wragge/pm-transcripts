THE PRIME MINISTER'S PRESS CONFERENCE<br />
AT PARLIAMENT HOUSE, CANBERRA<br />
TUESDAY, 25 SEPTEMBER, 1973<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I have a few announcements which I regret<br />
I couldn't give to you or my fellow members of the Parliament<br />
before this. Some of the announcements I have relate to<br />
decisions by the Executive Council and while the Executive<br />
Council used to sit on Thursdays and we brought it forward<br />
to midday on Tuesdays, one still has to wait till it concludes,<br />
before one can make any announcements of the decisions which<br />
the Government recommends to it. Secondly, some of the<br />
decisions have to be received by the Premiers before one can<br />
announce them and there again this has not been done the<br />
messages to the Premiers they would not have been received<br />
by the Premiers very long ago.<br />
There are some appointments in the transport field.<br />
The Secretary of the Department of Transport has been appointed<br />
as a sole Commissioner under the Royal Commissions Act to<br />
inquire into the whole of the Maritime Industry and the development<br />
of transport policies. I will circulate the terms of reference<br />
of the Maritime Industry Commission o. f Inquiry which Mr. Summers<br />
will conduct. I would like to pay tribute to Mr. Summers for his<br />
acceptance of this completely new national task, there is no-one<br />
in Australia who knows so much about it, and who is so well<br />
equipped to discharge it. As you know we are resolved to<br />
amalgamate the Departments of Transport and Civil Aviation.<br />
The new head of the Department will be coming from Canada,<br />
Mr. C. C. Halton. He was born in Britain and he has had a most<br />
distinguished career in private industry in Britain and in<br />
public service in Canada. Mr. Jones met him when he was in<br />
Ottowa earlier this year, and I met him when I was there for the<br />
Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting. He has experience in<br />
many fields of transport, he is a distinguished economist,<br />
it is a very great advantage to Australia to have a man who is<br />
aware of the similar federal system in Canada and who has operated<br />
within it, and also is acquainted with the system in the<br />
United States. Mr. Jenner will be Acting Secretary of the<br />
Department from 30 September until Mr. Halton's arrival.<br />
Sir Donald Anderson, the present Secretary of the Department of<br />
Civil Aviation will become full time Chairman of Qantas on the<br />
1st October. Mr. R. Phillips will be Acting Director-General of<br />
Civil Aviation until his Department is merged with the Department<br />
of Transport. Mr. Jones can give you further details about<br />
Mr. Halton, the first Secretary of the amalgamated department.<br />
The Auditor-General was involved in a car accident and<br />
Mr. W. Scott will act as Auditor-General while he is off. / 2 </p>
<p>-2<br />
V~ have decided to expand the services of the Australian<br />
Legal Aid Office, which was announced last July. In view of the<br />
demands Already being placed on the Office, the Government decided<br />
to allocate an additional $ 750,000 for the Office in this<br />
financial year.<br />
There are two other inquiries which we will be setting up.<br />
One is into Government Procurement Policy and I can circulate the terms<br />
of reference to you. We expect to announce the membership of the<br />
Committee of Inquiry in the next few days. We have also decided to<br />
set up a F. M. Radio Inquiry. The Senate Standing Committee on<br />
Education, Science and the Arts, recommended that there should be a<br />
new inquiry into F. M. broadcasting. Senator Douglas McClelland,<br />
Minister for the Media, made a submission to Cabinet along the same<br />
terms, and I have a brief note of the purpose of this inquiry.<br />
We want to set up F. M. We want to know what bands it should operate<br />
in or what bands other media might have to operate in. A very great<br />
deal of expenditure is involved, so we want to be sure that the<br />
correct decision is made.<br />
Are there any questions?<br />
QUESTION: Do you believe you are bound, under whatever circumstances,<br />
to fulfil your election undertaking to give a 35 hour week to the<br />
Commonwealth Public Service?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: As my colleague, Mr. Cameron, pointed out so<br />
effectively at Question Time in the House this morning, it becomes<br />
very difficult to carry out this particular promise in the Policy<br />
Speech, because we have so effectively, promptly and fully carried<br />
out the other promise to remove unemployment. You remember that in<br />
the Policy Speech, I said that in the lifetime of this Parliament,<br />
the 28th Parliament, the working hours of all Commonwealth employees<br />
will be reduced by 1 hours to 35 hours. I am the Minister responsible<br />
for the Commonwealth Public Service, I can redeem this promise by<br />
making a recommendation anytime in the next two years.<br />
QUESTION: Do you accept Mr. Cameron's argument in Parliament<br />
this morning that it might be impractical to do so?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I won't make any commitments to two years ahead.<br />
QUESTION: Prime Minister, I under stood that you had made commi * tments<br />
two years ahead, do you now expect to honour those commitments?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: It would be more difficult, but I won't say that<br />
I won't honour them. I acknowledge that I made the commitment.<br />
That is in the lifetime of this Parliament.<br />
QUESTION: Did Cabinet yesterday, discuss the Industries Assistance<br />
Commission? If so, what was the result and what was the attitude of<br />
Dr. Cairns?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: We did discuss it. I expect to be introducing the<br />
bill this week. Might I say, Mr. Haupt, that I was a bit disappointed<br />
in an article of yours this morning in the Financial Review which<br />
misrepresented ' what I had said you said, referring to my speech in<br />
Adelaide last Friday " After berating the business community on<br />
Friday, for masochism, schitsophrenia and phsychological sabotage".<br />
I beratted the stock market, not the business community. I was<br />
quite precise in the people I beratted. / 3 </p>
<p>-3<br />
QUESTION: How do you react to Bob Hawke describing you and the<br />
Cabinet, of accusing you of political imbecility and political<br />
insanity? PRIME MINISTER: I have no comment to make on these remarks.<br />
QUESTION: You have said at least twice in the last week that<br />
the bulk-of Australia's present inflation is due to trends imported<br />
from overseas. What evidence do you have for this statement?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: There is a very great demand, this season, for<br />
exports for instance, in meat. That is the developed countries,<br />
such as the United States, which had previously placed restrictions<br />
on the import of our meat are now anxious to get as much as they can.<br />
This is a very clear case where the price of meat had been put up.<br />
More and more the inflation is spreading between all developed<br />
countries. I give you that instance.<br />
QUESTION: In the wake of Parramatta, do you plan to relinquish the<br />
Foreign Minister portfolio, so you can spend more time at home to<br />
concentrate on domestic politics?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I will tell you if I have any changes, when I<br />
have decided to make any such changes.<br />
QUESTION: Did Mr. Byrant discuss with you, his move to send his<br />
wife to Maningrida? Who covered her expenses on that trip?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I don't know.<br />
QUESTION: Again in the wake of Parramatta, you said that the<br />
Galston decision was one that may have gone against you, or maybe<br />
the reason why there was such a swing against the Government<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Of course it was. I<br />
QUESTION: Do you also.-accept Mr. Whelan's assessment that the public<br />
relations campaign of your Government has broken down and that the<br />
policies of your Government are not getting through to the people.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I think that's right the public haven't seen the<br />
whole picture this way, that will obviously-be cured by the time of<br />
any general election.<br />
QUESTION: The Melburnians today are reported to be very<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Melburnians? What, the citizens of the city of<br />
Melbourne? QUESTION: Exactly. It was reported today that they..<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I thought you were referring to a Category school.<br />
QUESTION: are reported to be extremely nervous today about the<br />
presence of an alleged El Fatah terrorist in their city.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: He's left. / 4 </p>
<p>-4<br />
QUESTION: You said in answer to a question on notice from<br />
Mr. Lynch that you had discussions with General Romulo about the<br />
trial of Senator Aquino in Manila. Could you give us the substance<br />
of your discussions or could you give the Australian Government's<br />
position on Senator Aquino' s trial.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Senator Aquino's trial is now, I gather, to be in<br />
public. I don't want to comment on internal matters. Senator Aquino<br />
is very well known to Australians. There would be no Filipino,<br />
even the President himself, who would be so well known to Australians.<br />
Accordingly, his trial will be followed with very great interest by<br />
a great number of people, in Australia, including myself.<br />
QUESTION: will you elaborate on Azzam's whereabouts<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No.<br />
QUESTION: Can you say why you can't do that?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: The reason is obvious. Ladies and Gentlemen, I will<br />
not make comments on security matters. And there are many security<br />
implications in the question you asked. If it is known how he's<br />
travelling, when he left, where he's going, there are'security<br />
implications for a great number of people, including Australians,<br />
in transit or at their posts. Ladies and gentlemen, I don't want to<br />
have to always say the same thing about security matters. I will not<br />
comment on them.<br />
QUESTION: Will the Australian Government recognise the new<br />
Government in Chile?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Not yet.<br />
QUESTION: Some months ago I asked you whether it would be possible<br />
to announce cabinet decisions to Parliament before announcing them at<br />
the Press Conference. After today's events, do you think it would be<br />
a good idea to announce them each Tuesday morning when Parliament is<br />
sitting? PRIME MINISTER: No, I don't. I have already told you it's impossible<br />
to announce some of these decisions. Cabinet was going all day<br />
yesterday. We have the Executive Council meeting from now on,<br />
ordinarily at midday on Tuesday. Obviously, I can't announce<br />
decisions of the Executive Council, such as the appointments, the<br />
terms of reference of the Royal Commissions, when Parliament sits<br />
because it sits, at present, before the Executive Council meets.<br />
Again, there are some matters which I have to convey to the Premiers<br />
before I can announce them publicly.<br />
QUESTION: Sir, you said this morning that you would have gladly<br />
announced, brought in your list, I think you said, if Mr. Snedden<br />
had asked you earlier in Question Time...<br />
PRIME MINISTER: There are some matters I could have announced then,<br />
yes. There was for instance one matter which came out in answer<br />
to a question by one of the members on my side, Mr. Hansen, the<br />
Member for Wide Bay asked a question concerning his electorate.<br />
I doubt whether the decision had yet been received by Mr. Bjelke-<br />
Petersen, at the time the question was asked, but that is an instance<br />
where I could have announced in the Parliament if the question had<br />
been asked at the beginning of Question Time instead of right at<br />
the end. </p>
<p>QUESTION: Do you plan to do this in future?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No. Did you want the Press Conference today not not?<br />
QUESTION: Yes Sir, but I would rather have the press announcements<br />
made earlier, so that perhaps we could think of more intensive<br />
questions to ask you.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well I did a week ago hold it in the-morning.<br />
I wasn't able to hold it this morning for one reason of course,<br />
there were several of these things that had to be confirmed by the<br />
Executive Council or conveyed to Premiers, but you haven't asked<br />
me about the ones that have beih-conveyed to Premiers.<br />
QUESTION: Well Sir, I was just going to ask that one. I don't<br />
know if it was concerning the Prices Referendum, but I was going to<br />
ask you, have any eastern State Premiers in recent days offered to<br />
cede to you temporary powers on prices and incomes?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: There has been no change from the position at the<br />
Constitutional Convention.<br />
QUESTION: Have you agreed to the latest request for a conference<br />
of Australian political leaders on inflation?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I think the suggestion came in a telegram from<br />
the leader of the L. C. L. in the South Australian Parliament.<br />
And as I said when I was asked this morning about this, I had<br />
a discussion with him on Friday night.<br />
QUESTION: Can you tell us what your answer was?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I didn't believe that the time would be well spent.<br />
National economic policies are only effectively carried out by the<br />
National Parliament.<br />
QUESTION: Could you tell me how many inter-departmental committees<br />
are presently operating? Will you make public a list of the interdepartment<br />
committees set up by your Government? And also would you<br />
make public a list of inter-departmental committees set up by the<br />
previous Government, which are still operating?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No. There is a question what ones my Department<br />
are involved in and I expect to give an answer to that this week.<br />
It would in fact take a very long time to compile that list.<br />
There are many more such committees than there were when we took<br />
over. And this--is-one of the reasons why the Public Service,<br />
well at least in my Department, has had to be expanded, is to answer<br />
correspondence and to answer questions like that. And I have to<br />
take into account whether the time, the money is well spent.<br />
I try to answer all the letters that come in, except when they are<br />
part of a campaign such as that one which we were subjected to a<br />
few months ago, I don't bother to answer that sort of claptrap, but<br />
apart from that form of syndicated pressure, I receive well over a<br />
thousand letters a week, and a very great amount of manpower and<br />
womanpower is involved in answering those letters. So I can't<br />
responsibly put aside people to get an answer to the question that<br />
you just asked me. / 6 </p>
<p>-6<br />
QUESTION: Would you tell us what you have written to the<br />
Premiers about?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No. I would probably write 10 letters to each<br />
Premier each week.<br />
QUESTION: When are you going to hold a special Premiers meeting<br />
to discuss changes to the Constitution over the composition of the<br />
Loan Council?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Probably on 11 October. I had suggested Friday<br />
12 October, which is not a sitting day, that didn't suit one or<br />
more of the Premiers, and it is pretty sure now to be on Thursday<br />
the 11th. The Premier of Queensland will not be here, but the<br />
Acting Premier, Sir Gordon Chalk, is willing, at some inconvenience,<br />
to come. So I think it will be the 11th.<br />
QUESTION: Will you investigate or find out who did pay for<br />
Mrs. Bryant's trip?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No.<br />
QUESTION: And do you consider this to be unusual practice?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No I am not going to inquire. I assume that this was<br />
justified. Certainly, I am not going to inquire into such matters.<br />
QUESTION: My question relates to the purchase by the National<br />
Gallery of the Jackson Pollock painting<br />
PRIME MINISTER: A masterpiece.<br />
QUESTION: For $ 1,340,000. Were you consulted before the painting<br />
was purchased? Do you agree with its purchase? Would you agree that<br />
the money could be better spent on purchasing Australian works both<br />
here and overseas. And finally, as the former owner Ben Heller was<br />
on the point of tears as he talked about it last night, about his<br />
pending parting with the painting. Would you consider authorising<br />
the Director of the National Gallery to sell ' Blue Poles' back to<br />
Mr. Heller at a modest profit?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: If we are going to sell it, I have no doubt that in<br />
a year or so we could make a handsome profit * on it. If one likes to<br />
regard it in that light, investment in art is very profitable indeed.<br />
Pollock is one of the great figures in modern. American art and<br />
this is regarded as his masterpiece. I knew of the proposal. It<br />
came to me from the Gallery Acquisitions Committee, which took over<br />
when we took over, from the Commonwealth Art Advisory Board, a<br />
recommendation came from that body. I am not going to overrule the<br />
advice of such bodies when we are able to enact the National Gallery<br />
legislation, then of course, they will have the right to spend the<br />
appropriation as they see fit. I know this is quite a contribution<br />
in overseas aid to redress the American adverse balance of payments.<br />
QUESTION: Could I clear up the question of the Premiers. Were you<br />
talking in geneial terms about problems of communication with the<br />
Premiers week by week or were you talking about some specific thing<br />
that you put to them today?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Some specific thing. / 17 </p>
<p>-7<br />
QUESTION: Can you tell us what it was?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No. I am not going to volunteer these things.<br />
I did identify one because it came out in Question Time.<br />
QUESTION: Control of doctors' fees seems to be one of the<br />
major problems facing the health scheme, and I wondered if the<br />
prices referendum was passed, if it would give the Government power<br />
to control doctors' fees whether this had been discussed?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I wouldn't believe that the prices referendum would.<br />
QUESTION: What about incomes?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: That would. I would expect that would.<br />
QUESTION: You said in your policy speech that referendums would<br />
be held to give the Commonwealth power over interests rates and terms<br />
and conditions of employment. Can you say when the referendums will<br />
be held and can you elaborate on the proposals now?<br />
now<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I wouldn't/ believe that it is necessary to hold a<br />
referendum over interest rates because the significant interest<br />
rates can probably be regulated under this Parliament's power over<br />
foreign corporations and trading and financial corporations formed<br />
within the limits of the Commonwealth. We are going to introduce<br />
legislation, as you know, in respect of building societies both<br />
terminating and permanent and hire purchase companies and possibly<br />
merchant banks. They would, I would think, all be financial<br />
corporations formed within the limits of the Commonwealth.<br />
The same would apply to various trading corporations so formed.<br />
I would expect that the next House of Representatives election<br />
there would be a referendum I think it is very likely, I<br />
don't know what other proposals there are and one has to limit<br />
the number but it would seem to me that it would be appropriate<br />
to hold a referendum to permit the national Parliament to pass laws<br />
on the conditions of work at the next House of Representatives<br />
election. As you know, at the Senate election, whether it is for<br />
the Senate alone or not, we will be putting referenda to synchronise<br />
elections for the two housesof this Parliament to permit this<br />
Parliament to refer matters to State Parliaments upon which this<br />
Parliament at the moment has the exclusive right to legislate.<br />
Also to spell out in greater detail the conditiond upon which the<br />
State Parliaments can refer matters to tl1{ S, Parliament. Also if<br />
this Premiers' Conference on the Loan Council incorporating Local<br />
Government representatives proves abortive, on a referendum to<br />
amend Section 105A of the Constitution to permit the<br />
national Government to make debt arrangements with elected local<br />
government bodies.<br />
QUESTION: The appointment of the new head of the Department of<br />
Civil Aviation and Transport. Is this an indication that we can<br />
expect the Government to look overseas for senior public servants<br />
in the future and do you expect any reaction from the Public Service<br />
from the implication that there was no one in the Australian<br />
Public Service suitable-to fill the position?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: We will aim to get the best people available.<br />
We believe Mr. Halton is better than anyone available to the Australian<br />
Government in Australia, as the first head of the new combined<br />
Department of Transport. There are some people from overseas that<br />
are already involved in advice to us Mr. Justice Woodhouse of the<br />
New Zealand Court of Appeal. / 8 </p>
<p>-8<br />
QUESTION: Is there any right of appeal, in this case?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No. Not for First Division men. They are<br />
appointed by the Executive Council.<br />
QUESTION: The latest figures on industrial dispute show that<br />
in the first six months of this year, working days lost because<br />
of strikes, have increased by 65 per cent over the same six months<br />
last year. Will you tell us why this is so?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I am not aware of the figures and I won't hazard an<br />
opinion on them.<br />
QUESTION: Do you think that this hurts your Government's electoral<br />
standing. And why is it, apparently, that your Government is less<br />
able to deal with the unions, or create an economic...<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Because of the Lynch Laws. Most of the industrial<br />
disputes, as I observe them, flow from demarcation issues.<br />
There are too many unions in Australia, and one of the reasons<br />
why there are too many unions, is the fact that unions take on a<br />
different legal status and personality since the same union has to<br />
be registered in five arbitration jurisdictions. There are many<br />
instances where the same union has to be registered in the<br />
Commonwealth jurisdiction, the Queensland, South Australian<br />
and West Australian jurisdictions. It doesn't apply in Victoria and<br />
Tasmania because the States there rely on wages boards rather than<br />
compulsory industrial arbitration. You will remember that it is<br />
over four and a half years ago now that the Commonwealth Industrial<br />
Court recommended, as a matter of urgency, to all the Attorney-Generals<br />
in Australia that they should take steps to amend their laws to permit<br />
a single legal entity or personality or incorporation for industrial<br />
organisations, and this has still not been done. We tried to do all<br />
we could in the Commonwealth jurisdiction, in this Parliament's<br />
legislation early this year in the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill.<br />
It was thrown out by the Senate. We brought it in in a new form<br />
which ought to make it more palatable, but still making it easier<br />
to amalgamate unions. I don't know what the Senate is going to do<br />
about it.<br />
QUESTION: Do you share Mr. Cameron's attitude on the 35 hour week<br />
being given to power workers and do you support or approve of the<br />
action being taken in New South Wales at the moment?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I am not going to volunteer an opinion on this.<br />
These are State employees, they have a quarrel with a State<br />
Government, which happens to be a Liberal Government. But it is<br />
idle for me to express an opinion on this. It is not a matter<br />
where we can do anything as the employer. We have no right to<br />
intervene. It is not a matter where the laws are deficient.<br />
It is not a demarcation issue.<br />
QUESTION: Do you agree with Mr. Cameron?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I am not volunteering a comment on it. / 9 </p>
<p>9-<br />
QUESTION: Has Cabinet sought an opinion from the Attorney-General's<br />
Department as to whether power over prices can be construed to<br />
include power over wages, and secondly, you mentioned a referendum<br />
on conditions of work might be held with the next House election.<br />
Would power over conditions of work include power over wages?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Among other things, conditions of work would<br />
include power over wages and salaries, it would include leave and<br />
a very great number of other industrial matters. But in particular<br />
the formula " conditions of work" would cover an increasing matter<br />
where awards are being by-passed, where people are not technically<br />
employees but contractors. You will remember the distribution of<br />
milk changed from a system of employees distributing it to a<br />
system of persons contracting to distribute milk. The same system<br />
as newspapers have for the distribution of newspapers and this has<br />
spread largely in the building industry. Now this form of contract<br />
is aimed to by-pass industrial arbitration or industrial agreement<br />
and accordingly the word " conditions of work" is the one we usually<br />
use now because it would cover all such cases. You also asked if<br />
the Attorney-General's Department had been asked for an opinion,<br />
whether prices covers wages or wages and salaries. The Attorney-<br />
General was asked this in the Senate last week, he said he had not<br />
been asked for an opinion. He had not volunteered an opinion,<br />
the position is the same today.<br />
QUESTION: Mr Hayden referred at Question Time to discussions<br />
he said were going to occur today about housing loan interest<br />
rates. Do you think the Government will decide this week on its<br />
scheme for protecting lower income earners?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I haven't spoken to Mr Hayden since Question Time. </p>
