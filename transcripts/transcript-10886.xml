<p>Thank you very much, Headmaster, to Angela, the School Captain, to</p>
<p> my colleagues, Teresa Gambaro, the Member for Petrie, and Rod Henshaw,</p>
<p> the candidate for Dickson, ladies and gentlemen.</p>
<p>It is for me a real privilege to spend a few moments with the senior</p>
<p> students of St Pauls and also with some of the parent body of this</p>
<p> school. I have some of the sense of what it is like to be a parent</p>
<p> of a child completing his or her final examinations. My own younger</p>
<p> son is sitting for the higher school certificate in New South Wales</p>
<p> this year, so I am not entirely unfamiliar with the atmosphere in</p>
<p> households in the lead-up to the final examination. And having had</p>
<p> two before him, I am particularly familiar and my felicitations, understanding,</p>
<p> sympathy and empathy go very, very directly to the parents and to</p>
<p> the students. Because when you come to the end of your school career,</p>
<p> it is a significant occasion in your life and it's an occasion</p>
<p> that I remember when I left school in, must I confess it, but I will,</p>
<p> 1956, and the Australia that I lived in in 1956 was a wonderful country.</p>
<p> But it was a different country from the Australia that you will leave</p>
<p> school to enter in a more adult way at the end of 1998. And in sharing</p>
<p> those recollections and those comparisons it's important to understand</p>
<p> that there are some things about our country that don't change,</p>
<p> and shouldn't change, and we should fight hard to stop changing.</p>
<p> But there are other things about our country that do change, and must</p>
<p> change, and we should promote the change because it is good for the</p>
<p> future of our society.</p>
<p>There are certain enduring Australian values that I still identify</p>
<p> and are still as strong and as worthy and as valuable to us as Australians</p>
<p> as they were when I left Canterbury Boys High School in Sydney in</p>
<p> 1956. And those are the traditions of mateship, the tradition of treating</p>
<p> people fairly on the basis of their contribution to society. And it's</p>
<p> very important in the context of some debates that are occurring in</p>
<p> Australia at the present time, to emphasise the fact that we have</p>
<p> always been a society that treats people according to their worth</p>
<p> and to their contribution and to their values to Australian society.</p>
<p> We are a society now that has welcomed into our family as a nation</p>
<p> people from one hundred and forty countries. Tolerance of people,</p>
<p> acceptance of people, irrespective of their race, their religion,</p>
<p> their national background or their political belief, is a cornerstone</p>
<p> of a fair Australia. And it's something that needs to be emphasised</p>
<p> and it needs to be practised.</p>
<p>Australia is in a special, indeed a unique, position in the world.</p>
<p> We are the only nation in the world that is simultaneously a country</p>
<p> that has inherited the great treasures of western civilisation, has</p>
<p> very strong links with the nations of North America, but is located</p>
<p> within the Asian Pacific Region. And that gives us a special opportunity.</p>
<p> We have insights and understanding of the Asian Pacific Region that</p>
<p> our friends in North America and Europe do not have. And because of</p>
<p> that inheritance of ours and those associations of ours we can bring</p>
<p> and make a contribution to our region that no other country can. In</p>
<p> the years ahead I see Australia as being a magnet to those who want</p>
<p> stability, who want tolerance, who want legal security and who want</p>
<p> economic prosperity. Translating that into more practical terms, I</p>
<p> see no reason why our country should not become, in the next century,</p>
<p> the largest financial centre in the Asian Pacific Region after Tokyo.</p>
<p> And it is already well along the way to doing that. Because we have</p>
<p> enormous advantages. We simultaneously speak the English language,</p>
<p> provide a banking and financial system of great integrity and great</p>
<p> stability, and we also provide a legal system that offers great stability</p>
<p> and great reassurance.</p>
<p>We have, as Australians, people of so many different racial and ethnic</p>
<p> backgrounds, many of whom have links into the Asia Pacific Region</p>
<p> through their families, through their businesses, through their educational</p>
<p> associations. But I find as I travel around the Asia Pacific Region</p>
<p> that one of the strongest resonances between our country and the countries</p>
<p> of the Region are the experiences that young people from Singapore,</p>
<p> from India, from China, from Indonesia, from Malaysia, the experiences</p>
<p> that those people, as young people, had in attending Australian universities.</p>
<p> And they remember and carry with them an affection for Australia well</p>
<p> into their adult and older lives. And it's a very important link</p>
<p> that we should work very hard to preserve. And it's a link that</p>
<p> I know St Paul's is making a contribution towards and is nurturing</p>
<p> in a very special way, as I had the opportunity with the Headmaster</p>
<p> a few moments ago, to observe.</p>
<p>So, there are some similarities between Australia of 1956 and Australia</p>
<p> of 1998. There is that continuity, that golden thread of Australian</p>
<p> values that hasn't changed. But there are many things that have</p>
<p> changed and many of those for the better and many of those are inevitable.</p>
<p> I had a wonderful reminder of our inheritance as an Australian nation</p>
<p> two weeks ago. You no doubt would have seen on television the stories</p>
<p> of those four wonderful World War I veterans who returned to the old</p>
<p> battlefields of northern France to celebrate the end or to remember,</p>
<p> not celebrate, but to remember, the end of World War I. And my wife</p>
<p> a I had those four wonderful men to morning tea at Kirribilli House.</p>
<p> And the sheer joy of talking to four people, all of whom are between</p>
<p> 98 and 102, to hear their stories to experience the reality that the</p>
<p> older you get the more vivid your recollection is of years long past,</p>
<p> perhaps not always of year immediately passed, but of years long passed.</p>
<p> And to hear their stories and to recognise in them a strain and a</p>
<p> character and an attitude to life that was unmistakably Australian</p>
<p> and something that all of us in different ways share and hang onto.</p>
<p>And if I've got any message to you, the young people of St Pauls,</p>
<p> who will either leave this year or next year, it is that the values</p>
<p> that bind us together as Australians are special. This is a special</p>
<p> country. It is like no other country in the world and that gives it</p>
<p> a very, very special character. And it is an immense privilege to</p>
<p> live in Australia and to be part of the Australian family. And it's</p>
<p> not a privilege any of us should ever take for granted. We are very</p>
<p> fortunate indeed to be Australians. But we should all of us work very</p>
<p> hard and observe the principles of tolerance and understanding in</p>
<p> working hard to build a better Australia as we go into the 21st</p>
<p> century.</p>
<p>We have political debate in this country. We are an open democracy.</p>
<p> We should practice and we should encourage free speech. But we should</p>
<p> also practice and encourage the tolerance and understanding of different</p>
<p> points of view. I lead a Party and I lead a Government which is very</p>
<p> committed to the notions of private enterprise and individual liberty.</p>
<p> My greatest goal in life is to create an Australia where every single</p>
<p> man and woman can realise his or her talents to the fullest extent,</p>
<p> where people do have an equality of opportunity, where the measure</p>
<p> of your success and the role that you carve out in society is something</p>
<p> that is determined by your own values and your own contribution. But</p>
<p> not according to the family you were born into, the race from which</p>
<p> you came, the school you attended or the political party to which</p>
<p> you belong. But the contribution that you can make as an individual</p>
<p> member of Australian society.</p>
<p>And that kind of society needs a lot of things. It needs competition.</p>
<p> You see in the independent school system of Australia, a great demonstration</p>
<p> of competition within the education sector. I myself was wholly educated</p>
<p> in the government sector of the school system in Sydney. I have sent</p>
<p> my children at a secondary level to independent schools. I value that</p>
<p> choice. And I want that kind of choice to be extended to all Australians.</p>
<p> And that's one of the reasons why the Government changed the</p>
<p> new schools policy in relation to independent schools to make it possible</p>
<p> for more low fee paying independent schools to be opened in Australia.</p>
<p> I want a diversity a plurality of education. I don't want a monopoly</p>
<p> of education in the hands of the Government, nor do I want independent</p>
<p> school education to be the preserve of people who can afford to pay</p>
<p> a certain level of fees. If you do believe in freedom of choice, you</p>
<p> must provide equality of opportunity so that all within the Australian</p>
<p> community can exercise that freedom of choice.</p>
<p>Always remember the contribution that your school life has given you.</p>
<p> Always remember the values that you have imbibed from your school,</p>
<p> the Christian principles of St Paul's are, of course, at the</p>
<p> centre of the values that you have imbibed during your education here.</p>
<p> And always have goals in life. The most important thing is always</p>
<p> to have another set of goals ahead of you. I have another set of goals</p>
<p> ahead of me. You don't have any prizes for one of those goals</p>
<p> might be. But I do have some very strong and very purposeful goals</p>
<p> ahead of me. They are goals that I believe are good for Australia.</p>
<p> The goals of changing and reforming, for example, our taxation system.</p>
<p> I won't give you a long lecture on that. But I think it is very</p>
<p> important that we have, and I direct this particularly to the economic</p>
<p> students. It is very important that we have a fairer, different taxation</p>
<p> system. Because it will enable us to trade a lot better in the Asian</p>
<p> Pacific Region and in the rest of the world. I want to see some of</p>
<p> the communications gaps between the city and the country dissolved.</p>
<p> And over the course of yesterday and today and the weeks ahead, the</p>
<p> Government will be making a number of announcements that will underline</p>
<p> our determination to achieve that. But in your own lives, having goals</p>
<p> and striving towards them is the stuff of renewal and reinvigoration</p>
<p> and it is the driving force that keeps all of us going. Once we lose</p>
<p> goals, we lose a sense of direction and a sense of purpose.</p>
<p>So the messages if I have for you are to maintain the values that</p>
<p> you have imbibed at your school and to always in your lives ahead,</p>
<p> always strive to achieve particular goals. And if you do that you</p>
<p> can have a very fulfilling and a very, very rewarding life. And the</p>
<p> Australia that you will inherit when you leave school and go to university,</p>
<p> or wherever you choose to go, will be a very different Australia from</p>
<p> what young Australians in the 50s and 60s inherited. And in turn the</p>
<p> Australia that your children will inherit when they leave school will</p>
<p> also be different. But there will be a continuity, there will be a</p>
<p> golden thread of basic Australian values that will be there. Whatever</p>
<p> form our Constitution may have, whatever may be the political complexion</p>
<p> of the government at the time, it will still be as I recognise those</p>
<p> Australian values in those four wonderful diggers of average age of</p>
<p> 100, in fifty years time people will still be able to recognise a</p>
<p> continuity of certain values and certain beliefs.</p>
<p>To you, Mr Headmaster, thank you very, very much for having me here</p>
<p> this morning. It is always a privilege to talk to young Australians</p>
<p> and I thank you most warmly for the welcome you have given me. Thank</p>
<p> you.</p>
