Prime Minister Julia Gillard, Minister for Sport Mark Arbib and Member for Adelaide Kate Ellis today announced the Australian Government would provide $30 million towards the redevelopment of Adelaide Oval.</p>
<p>With support from the Federal and South Australian Governments, Adelaide Oval will be redeveloped into a 50,000 seat world-class multi-sport venue.</p>
<p>The Gillard Government funding will go towards the construction of two new underground car parks, creating more parking solutions in the precinct and freeing up space on residential streets.</p>
<p>The funds will also go towards the creation of new wetlands and other enhancements around the Riverbank precinct to make sure the Adelaide Oval continues to be one of our country's most beautiful sporting venues.The Prime Minister thanked the Member for Adelaide for her continued representations on behalf of the people of Adelaide.</p>
<p>We want to make sure the benefits of this once in a lifetime upgrade doesn't just benefit sports fans.  This redevelopment will benefit the whole city, from tourist operators to residents who live nearby.</p>
<p>The Gillard Government is proud to be working in partnership with the South Australian Government to transform Adelaide Oval into an international standard sporting facility in a truly beautiful setting.</p>
<p>As one of the most recognisable cricket grounds in the world, the Adelaide Oval has been the stage for some of the world's best cricket since 1871.</p>
<p>Following the redevelopment, AFL games will also be played at the oval for the first time in 40 years.</p>
<p>The South Australian Government committed $535 million to the Oval's upgrade. Construction is scheduled to begin in March 2012 after the current cricket season.  The redevelopment is scheduled to be completed in time for the AFL season in 2014.</p>
