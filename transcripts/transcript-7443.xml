RGY PRIME MINISTER<br />
CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
FEDERATION OF ETHNIC COMMUNITIES' COUNCILS OF AUSTRALIA<br />
CANBERRA 30 NOVEMBER 1988<br />
in the early days of this year of our Bicentenary, on 26<br />
January, I launched the nation's Australia Day celebrations<br />
with these words about the Australian identity:<br />
" We are, and essentially we remain, a nation of<br />
immigrants a nation drawn from 130 nationalities<br />
in Australia there is no hierarchy of descent: there<br />
must be no privilege of origin. The commitment is all.<br />
The commitment to Australia is the only thing needful to<br />
be a true Australian."<br />
Today, as we approach the end of this year of Bicentennial<br />
celebrations, you have given me the pleasure of addressing<br />
this conference which has adopted as its theme my words of<br />
Australia Day.<br />
Multiculturalism is indeed all about commitment to<br />
Australia. So I congratulate today not only the Federation of Ethnic<br />
Communities' Councils of Australia for devoting your efforts<br />
at this conference to analysing the nature of that<br />
commitment; I congratulate also the efforts, over many<br />
years, by your constituent councils throughout Australia to<br />
help those millions of Australians they represent to realise<br />
that commitment.<br />
Above all else, our Bicentenary has been a celebration of<br />
our identity as a nation of diverse ethnic origins<br />
Aboriginal, immigrant and Australian-born sharing a common<br />
commitment to Australia.<br />
Australia's national identity has been shaped by our convict<br />
and colonial origins, by the often tragic relationship over<br />
the last two hundred years between the Aboriginal people and<br />
the European newcomers, by successive waves of immigrants<br />
from all over the world, and by the hard work of generations<br />
of Australian-born men and women. 3941 </p>
<p>I The pr ir<br />
Over two hundred years, and through extraordinary effort and Irupt<br />
commitment, we have together built a wealthy and prosperous. shoi<br />
nation; young, strong, dynamic and vibrant; a nation capable Opp,<br />
ocfo nfardodnrte ssuisn ga ndt howsiel liencgo notmo icp raontde cts ocainad l ecnhhaanlclee ngoeusr that mtihnalm<br />
democratic freedoms and our individual liberties. I<br />
Within this Australia, four out of ten Australians are lat<br />
immigrants or the children of immigrants. Half of them are has<br />
from non-English speaking backgrounds. Two million inc<br />
Australians speak a language other than English at home. gra<br />
Less than half the population is of pure Anglo-celtic ug 1<br />
ancestry. Almost one in four Australians has no such I d<br />
ancestry. the<br />
So let us proclaim from this Congress the demographic fact We<br />
that we are a multicultural nation, But let us proclaim too in'<br />
that we are multicultural not only in character but in det<br />
outlook; multicultural not only by fact of demography but by prt<br />
virtue of philosophical choice. mul no<br />
It is to express that choice that this Government<br />
implements, across a broad range of areas, its policies of At<br />
multiculturalism. These policies celebrate our cultural mo<br />
diversity and harness it in the interest of individuals and am<br />
of the broader community they are policies to ensure that un<br />
our diversity is accompanied by social cohesion, a fair go cr<br />
and a fair share for all. In other words, they are t<br />
multicultural policies for all Australians. in<br />
Over the post war years, support for Government policies on<br />
the selection and settlement of new migrants in AustraliaI<br />
has been proudly and consistently bipartisan. fi it<br />
More recently, bipartisan support for a completely<br />
non-discriminatory immigration policy has been one of the p,<br />
great achievements of modern Australian political k<br />
leadership; a triumph of principle over populism, reason d<br />
over fear, statesmanship over politics. 0<br />
That achievement has been accompanied,. also on a bipartisan r<br />
basis, by the development and articulation of a rich andf<br />
unique multicultural ethos. Diversity has increasingly been<br />
seen as a national resource, offering substantial cultural,<br />
social and economic benefits for all Australians.<br />
But if there is one regret that I will take from this<br />
Bicentennial year, it is the collapse I hope it will be<br />
only a temporary collapse of bipartisan support for the<br />
principles of multiculturalism and of a truly<br />
non-discriminatory immigration policy. These two great<br />
features of our contemporary nationhood have, most<br />
regrettably, been undermined, in a year and at a time when<br />
they deserved our greatest affirmation.<br />
3 142 </p>
<p>The web of consensus that protected and fostered these<br />
principles for so long, has been tragically and dramatically<br />
ruptured by some members of the Opposition parties who<br />
should have had the wisdom to avoid that rupture. The<br />
Opposition parties have allowed the extreme views of a<br />
minority to fuel the same groundless fears and prejudices<br />
that spawned the White Australia policy so many decades ago.<br />
In doing so they have, directly or indirectly, fuelled the<br />
latent racism of a hostile minority in the community. There<br />
has been, during the period of this debate, a disturbing<br />
increase in the occurrence of racist incidents abuse,<br />
graffiti, broken windows, slashed tyres. I know of these<br />
ugly incidents, and you know of them even more directly than<br />
I do because some of you have been on the receiving end of<br />
the hatred of this abhorrent minority.<br />
we may regret these developments but we will not be<br />
intimidated by them. On the contrary, they have steeled our<br />
determination to continue a non-discriminatory immigration<br />
program. They have made more absolute our commitment to<br />
multicultural policies. I pledge to you that there will be<br />
no return to the past.<br />
At the commencement of the current Parliamentary session I<br />
moved a resolution in the House of Representatives in which,<br />
among other points, the House gave " its unambiguous and<br />
unqualified commitment to the principle that, whatever<br />
criteria are applied by Australian Governments in exercising<br />
their sovereign right to determine the composition of the<br />
immigration intake, race or ethnic origin shall never,<br />
explicitly or implicitly, be among them."<br />
I have noticed recently that the Opposition Leader, Mr<br />
Howard, has attempted to deny the racist overtones of his<br />
intervention in the immigration-debate. He was reported<br />
recently as regretting that to use his words his<br />
political, media and other enemies had linked him with some<br />
kind of discriminatory attack on Australians of Asian<br />
descent. Of course I have never believed that Mr Howard was<br />
personally motivated by any calculation darker than a grab<br />
for votes.<br />
But at its most charitable, it appears Mr Howard has<br />
suffered a major memory loss.<br />
Back in August, he was explicit. Asked about the rate of<br />
Asian immigration, he said: " I wouldn't like to see it<br />
greater... I do believe that in the eyes of some in the<br />
community, it's too great, it would be in our immediate term<br />
interest and supportive of social cohesion if it were slowed<br />
down a little, so that the capacity of the community to<br />
absorb was greater." 3 91 43 </p>
<p>Following those comments the opposition changed its policy L<br />
on immigration. And John Stone, when he was asked whether d<br />
that new policy would mean fewer Asians entering Australia, e<br />
said: V e<br />
" If we've gone through this four or five weeks of s<br />
absolute turmoil in order to have nothing changed, what C<br />
a lot of goats we'd look, wouldn't we." F<br />
Interviewer: " So you think that the bottom line is. Ak<br />
fewer Asians? d-<br />
Stone: " That is so."<br />
But despite all this, if Mr Howard now genuinely seeks to c<br />
reassure the Australian community that his policy in t<br />
immigration is non-discriminatory, I would welcome such a S<br />
statement as a major step towards the restoration of M1<br />
bipartisanship on this crucial area. 0 e<br />
In particular I would welcome his support, belated though it<br />
would be, for the August Parliamentary resolution. I note T<br />
in passing that it is clear from what Malcolm Fraser said c<br />
again on this issue on the radio this morning that, were he b<br />
still leading the Liberal Party, he would have given that<br />
support whole-heartedly. W y<br />
Ladies and Gentlemen,<br />
My Government will continue our development of multicultural ml<br />
policies. These policies have three essential components:<br />
social justice, economic efficiency and cultural expression. AA<br />
The social jutice dimension of multiculturalism seeks to<br />
ensue 1tjAi structures and practices of Australian c<br />
society reflect and respond to the diversity of the<br />
population, that they serve all Australians and provide<br />
equally for all, regardless of background. we do not demand t<br />
conformity as the price for equity or equality. A s<br />
I do not, nor I believe do you, ask any unfair advantage for I<br />
immigrants. We do not seek special preference for ethnic t<br />
groups. Rather multicultural policies seek equal d<br />
opportunity for all. c<br />
The economic dimension of multiculturalism seeks to ensure<br />
that e s lls and talents of all Australians are utilised q<br />
and harnessed in the interests of all of us that our human<br />
resources are not wasted by barriers of language,<br />
indifference or prejudice.<br />
The cultural dimension of the policy asserts and seeks to<br />
ensure thatall Australians are free to develop, adapt and<br />
share their individual cultural heritage.<br />
tf<br />
3 944 </p>
<p>Let me emphasise that such a commitment is not a recipe for<br />
division or discord. The Government has said quite<br />
explicitly that there are limits to cultural autonomy. In<br />
view of some recent regrettable incidents involving the<br />
expression in Australia of ethnic tensions that characterise<br />
some of the countries from which Australian migrants have<br />
come, let me spell these limits out again.<br />
First, all Australians must accept the basic structures of<br />
Australian society our rule of law, Parliamentary<br />
democracy, and English as our national language.<br />
Second, multiculturalism entails both rights and<br />
responsibilities. The right to maintain and develop one's<br />
culture, language and religion and, just as importantly,<br />
the responsibility to accept the rights of others to do the<br />
same lies at the very heart of multicultural philosophy.<br />
Multiculturalism offers each of us the opportunity to have<br />
our traditions accepted, and our viewpoints heard: it asks<br />
each of us to accept that others have equal rights.<br />
Third, all Australians are expected to have an overriding<br />
commitment to the future of our nation. we will not allow,<br />
because we can not allow, the bitter conflicts of the old<br />
world to tarnish the lustre of multiculturalism in the new<br />
world. It is this understanding upon which the title of<br />
your Congress is premised.<br />
within these clear limits multiculturalism Australian<br />
multiculturalism can provide a model of tolerance and<br />
social harmony to the rest of the world. It allows all<br />
Australians, whether Aboriginal, immigrant or<br />
Australian-born, to take pride in their history and.<br />
traditions. it asks all Australians to contribute their<br />
culture to our unique and developing national identity.<br />
in this context, I must mention the report of the Committee<br />
the Government established last year to advise on<br />
Australia's immigration policy. AS the CAMIP Report is<br />
still being considered by Cabinet, I am constrained in what<br />
I should say today although at this stage I anticipate<br />
that Senator Ray will be announcing the results of our<br />
deliberations shortly. Although the CAAMP Committee made a<br />
sterling attempt to address a very complex issue, it did not<br />
come to grips with some of the hard, central questions about<br />
immigration, such as the points test and overseas<br />
qualifications. So let me simply say this: there have always been two<br />
great, and sometimes overlapping, streams in Australian<br />
immigration, both pre-war and post-war. There have been<br />
immigrants who came here because we needed them, such as<br />
skilled workers with vital expertise and experience, and<br />
those who came here because they needed us, such as refugees<br />
fleeing oppression in their home countries. 3 94 </p>
<p>our skilled migrants have brought their families, and those<br />
family members themselves have frequently brought new<br />
skills. The popular dichotomy between skilled and family<br />
immigration is often exaggerated and short-sighted for<br />
example, economic immigrants are less likely to be attracted<br />
to Australia if it means separation from their families.<br />
That is not to say that we should not shape the immigration<br />
intake to our national interest to do otherwise would be<br />
irresponsible, to all concerned. what I do say is that our<br />
program will remain balanced. we live in difficult economic<br />
times requiring compromise and restraint on all sides<br />
and our immigration policy must reflect Australia's need to<br />
deepen its skills base.<br />
But I give this commitment. We will continue to give proper<br />
weight within our overall immigration program to family<br />
reunions. Let me add, too, that under our national policy on<br />
languages, we are equally concerned with maintaining and<br />
promoting second language learning not just for the ethnic<br />
communities but for all Australians.<br />
I want to make it clear that second language learning will<br />
remain a balanced program as long as this Government is in<br />
office. There will be no artificial distinction made<br />
between economic and community languages, or between Asian<br />
and non-Asian languages. The fact is, as delegates to this<br />
Congress know well, that many community languages such as<br />
Italian, Spanish, Chinese, German and Arabic are also<br />
vital for our economic future.<br />
Finally, let me make some brief comments about the Special<br />
Broadcasting Service SBS.<br />
Australia is unique in the world in having two national<br />
broadcasters, the ABC and SBS. Amalgamation is off the<br />
agenda, but that is not the end of the question.<br />
We have recently guaranteed SBS's real level of funding for<br />
the next three years. And in the public discussion paper<br />
issued a few months ago, we proposed a possible package<br />
which, if adopted, would guarantee and secure the future of<br />
SBS in the long-term -beyond the life of this and the next<br />
Government. That package includes, for the first time, a legislative<br />
base for SBS, a defined charter, administrative<br />
streamlining, and more flexible funding arrangements. I<br />
emphasise that it is a total package, not a menu of<br />
alternatives. It is still subject to community views and to<br />
final consideration by Cabinet.<br />
I would urge you, however, to look at the package seriously,<br />
responsibly and dispassionately, lest a great opportunity to<br />
secure the future of SES is lost. In this very real sense<br />
the future of SES is in your hands in how you respond to<br />
the option that has been put before you.<br />
3A946( </p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen<br />
In all the relevant policy areas from job creation to<br />
employment training, from education to income support, from<br />
language policy to communications policy our specific<br />
policies of assistance and our broader economic and social<br />
justice policies have served all members of our culturally<br />
diverse community. We have a record of which to be proud.<br />
But what of the future? Let me take this opportunity to<br />
foreshadow my Government's plans and intentions as they<br />
directly affect those Australians whose interests you<br />
represent. First, we will press on with the access and equity strategy.<br />
We will ensure that it secures a firm place in the<br />
priorities and planning of all Government departments and<br />
agencies. I have asked the Office of multicultural Affairs<br />
to work closely with these bodies, and with community<br />
organisations, to ensure that adequate consultation can take<br />
place. Second, we will ensure that Australians of non-English<br />
speaking background, and in particular women who face a<br />
double disadvantage, gain equitably from the broad range of<br />
social justice initiatives that will continue to distinguish<br />
my Government.<br />
Third, with your support we will do everything within our<br />
power to secure the integrity, financial viability, and<br />
long-term security and independence of the SBS with an<br />
unequivocal commitment to its distinctive multicultural,<br />
multilingual character.<br />
Fourth, we will work to ensure that all Australians get the<br />
chance to learn English to a level at which they can<br />
contribute their education and skills to our economic<br />
advancement. Fifth, we will continue to fund and promote a balanced<br />
program of second language learning languages that we need<br />
for our economic future, for the efficient delivery of<br />
social welfare, and for the celebration of our cultural<br />
diversity. Sixth, we will soon announce the blueprint for our<br />
immigration policies to the year 2000 and beyond it will<br />
be a balanced strategy, reflecting the needs of both the<br />
individual family and the broader economic imperative.<br />
we will continue to resist those who would contaminate the<br />
program, and impugn Australia, with their appeals to<br />
prejudice and fear. We will not turn back. 394 7 </p>
<p>Seventh, we will tackle head on the inequities and<br />
inefficiencies that have previously plagued the recognition<br />
of overseas qualifications. I am pleased to announce today,<br />
for the first time, that the issue of overseas<br />
qualifications has recently been added to the Structural<br />
Adjustment Committee's agenda for micro-economic reform.<br />
Eighth, we will actively promote citizenship. We will<br />
encourage non-citizens to make that final commitment to our<br />
nation voluntarily, and promote a better understanding of<br />
the rights and responsibilities of citizenship amongst all<br />
Australians. We reject, absolutely, the idea of forcing<br />
people to take up citizenship. We reject, equally, the idea<br />
that we should make those who wish to become Australian<br />
citizens wait longer to do so.<br />
And, finally, perhaps most important of all, in 1989 we will<br />
complete preparation of the National Agenda for a<br />
Multicultural Australia.<br />
These eight goals offer the promise of Australia becoming an<br />
even richer and more dynamic multicultural society in the<br />
decade ahead.<br />
On behalf of my Government I have already accepted those<br />
eight goals. I welcome the support that has come from the<br />
states and territories but tragically, the Federal<br />
Opposition has not yet responded to the proposed goals. Its<br />
leader continues to reject commitment to a multicultural<br />
Australia the very word offends him, and has been expunged<br />
from his vocabulary.<br />
No matter. The National Agenda for a Multicultural<br />
Australia will establish the Government's policy directions<br />
to the year 2000 and beyond. It will become a major part of<br />
the broader agenda for our next term in office.<br />
The National Agenda has the potential to communicate<br />
multiculturalism to the broader Australian community. If<br />
multiculturalism is a policy for all Australians as it<br />
indeed is then any image or perception that it is an<br />
ethnic monopoly must be resisted.<br />
That is why the National Agenda consultations have<br />
deliberately reached out to the broader Australian<br />
community. It is also why we must continually stress the<br />
social justice and particularly the economic dimensions of<br />
multicultural policies that they reflect mainstream<br />
Australian philosophies and that they seek to harness the<br />
skills and talents of all Australians in pursuit of the<br />
national interest.<br />
Let me, therefore, in declaring this conference open,<br />
congratulate the Ethnic Communities Councils of Australia,<br />
and wish you well in your second congress. Together we have<br />
achieved much in recent years. Much still remains to be<br />
done. With your support we can.<br />
