<p>  JONES:</p>
<p>  Well, the Prime Minister climbed on top of a tankard armoured personnel</p>
<p>   carrier yesterday and thanked the troops in the border town of Maliana on</p>
<p>   behalf of the Australian people. He is now in Darwin and he's on the line.</p>
<p>   Prime Minister, good morning.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Good morning Alan.</p>
<p>  JONES:</p>
<p>  Prime Minister, what a place to go, Maliana, that is absolutely destroyed</p>
<p>   isn't it?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Oh yes. Large areas of the whole territory, of course, have been destroyed.</p>
<p>  JONES:</p>
<p>  How bad is it?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Oh, it's very, very bad in many areas and there is just a clear impunitive</p>
<p>   burning and destruction took place. The good thing is that the locals are</p>
<p>   back in so many areas although there is still tens of thousands of refugees,</p>
<p>   displaced people in West Timor apparently suffering some intimidation in</p>
<p>   trying to get back. And the spirit of the local people is booming. They</p>
<p>   don't look scared any more, they see quite naturally the INTERFET forces</p>
<p>   including the Australians as being friends and protectors and helpers and</p>
<p>   there is a very positive spirit. But the destruction is very widespread.</p>
<p>   That's been said before but when you actually see it with the naked eye</p>
<p>   it's starker and obviously in some parts of Dili it was quite discriminatory</p>
<p>   as you fly over in a helicopter you see some areas completely untouched</p>
<p>   and you see other areas almost totally torched and blackened and destroyed.</p>
<p>  JONES:</p>
<p>  How do you rehabilitate that?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well, it takes a lot of time. I think the first thing you have got to do</p>
<p>   is give people a sense of physical security which our forces have done.</p>
<p>   You then provide basic medical assistance and over time you generate private</p>
<p>   sector interest. There has to be a certain amount of infrastructure restored</p>
<p>   before that private sector interest will materialise but as in all of these</p>
<p>   things the involvement of business and the private sector and reconstruction</p>
<p>   and rehabilitation is absolutely critical.</p>
<p>  JONES:</p>
<p>  You met with the UN leader didn't you, Sergio de Mello?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Yes. He gave me a very detailed briefing of his plans for the transition.</p>
<p>   They are.</p>
<p>  JONES:</p>
<p>  And when will that begin?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well, I can't put a date on it beyond saying I expect it to be in the early</p>
<p>   part of next year. It involves a number of decisions yet to be taken by</p>
<p>   the United Nations and Australia will, of course, have a different contribution.</p>
<p>   It will be a blue helmet operation. The troops we'll contribute will be</p>
<p>   in the area of 1500 to 2000 which is down from the.in the order of 5000</p>
<p>   plus that we now have. However, it's going to be nonetheless an operation</p>
<p>   that will last for some time but the security situation is about as good</p>
<p>   as you are going to get it now. It might improve a little but General Cosgrove</p>
<p>   told me that he felt that the mandate, that part of the mandate that required</p>
<p>   the restoration of peace and stability by and large has been achieved.</p>
<p>  JONES:</p>
<p>  But of course your troops, our Australian troops to whom you have spoken</p>
<p>   and congratulated and all that would have been wanting one thing from the</p>
<p>   Prime Minister, I'd say, the date for return. You were unable to give them</p>
<p>   that.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well, I couldn't because I don't control that. The exact date of the hand-over</p>
<p>   will be determined by the United Nations and the United Nations to put the</p>
<p>   peacekeeping group together. Quite a lot of the men and women did ask me</p>
<p>   that. They understand. Their morale is very good. I think they're showing</p>
<p>   tremendous cheerfulness and very good spirit. Naturally as Christmas approaches</p>
<p>   they'll miss their families like any of us would if we were away at Christmas</p>
<p>   time and it's all the more reason why there should be a renewed focus on</p>
<p>   them and a renewed interest in them which has always been very high in Australia</p>
<p>   as we approach Christmas.</p>
<p>  JONES:</p>
<p>  And what level of Indonesian support is there for both rehabilitation and</p>
<p>   the maintenance of peace in East Timor?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well, the best contribution that Indonesia can make obviously is to facilitate</p>
<p>   the easy return of displaced people from West Timor.</p>
<p>  JONES:</p>
<p>  And is that happening?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well, it's mixed. There is some evidence still quite a bit of evidence that</p>
<p>   the militia are still harassing them. Now, that's not, of course, the problem</p>
<p>   everywhere but there is certainly some evidence from what I was told by</p>
<p>   the non-government organisations such as CARE and Catholic Relief yesterday,</p>
<p>   and the Red Cross, that that is still happening. So that's certainly something</p>
<p>   that they can do to help. That's a very important element of it.</p>
<p>  JONES:</p>
<p>  You are coming back to Canberra for a busy round of engagements, amongst</p>
<p>   them Richard Branson who, as you know, announced yesterday that he is going</p>
<p>   to start a third airline here next year. Can Australia sustain three airlines?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well, that'll be a matter for the public. These things are determined ultimately</p>
<p>   in the market place. I welcome his commitment as competition is a good thing.</p>
<p>   We support it and we welcome it in the airline industry as elsewhere. Obviously</p>
<p>   we will have to meet foreign investment and safety requirements. Both of</p>
<p>   those are essential particularly safety. The others are essential too but</p>
<p>   one thing we don't want is any suggestion of corner cutting when it comes</p>
<p>   to safety with airlines. Any of them, whether it's a new one or the existing</p>
<p>   ones. We have an enviable record of safety in this country and we want to</p>
<p>   keep it exactly as it is. But can I make it clear, Alan, that we always</p>
<p>   welcome competition and nobody can ever raise an objection to a new player</p>
<p>   if that new player offers a good product and offers people a better deal</p>
<p>   and provided that new player abides by the rules.</p>
<p>  JONES:</p>
<p>  And you did announce in June that you would allow foreigners to own up to</p>
<p>   100 per cent of Australian domestic airlines unless it was against the national</p>
<p>   interest. And this plainly would be regarded as being in the national interest</p>
<p>   if it can get up and go?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  If it can get up and go then it.I don't want to pre-empt the proper processes.</p>
<p>  JONES:</p>
<p>  Most of the public would say how would you get access to airport terminals?</p>
<p>   Our airport terminals are already crowded as they are, would another player,</p>
<p>   is there room in those terminals for another player given that long-term</p>
<p>   leases seem to be held there by the existing players?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well, there obviously needs to be a lot of negotiation. And, I mean, the</p>
<p>   existing operators have their legal rights but there are also requirements</p>
<p>   in our laws to prevent the unreasonable exercise of the dominance that an</p>
<p>   existing market share gives you. So there are a number of things to be put</p>
<p>   in balance by the authorities. What John Anderson has said, and I repeat,</p>
<p>   we welcome more competition and we welcome the commitment of Virgin. It</p>
<p>   must go through our foreign investment policy procedures, get an assessment</p>
<p>   by the Foreign Investment Review Board and it must, of course, comply with</p>
<p>   all of the safety requirements that apply to the other airlines.</p>
<p>  JONES:</p>
<p>  It helps that he seems to have deeper pockets than other starters, at least</p>
<p>   that's a big start isn't it?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Oh, well, it is. But, I mean, this is the nature of commercial operation</p>
<p>   and, I mean, nobody can deny that the other two haven't had a very strong</p>
<p>   go and if somebody else can come in and provide some competition and give</p>
<p>   more variety well, isn't that something the Australian public would welcome?</p>
<p>  JONES:</p>
<p>  Absolutely. Good to talk to you and thank you for your time.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Bye.</p>
<p>  [ends]</p>
