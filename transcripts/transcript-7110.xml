4'), AUST ALIA.<br />
FOR MEDIA 12 FEBRUARY, 1987<br />
Senator Don Crimes, minister for Community Services, has<br />
tendered his resignation from the Ministry. I, as will all<br />
his colleagues, greatly regret his resignation. His<br />
contribution to the Government has been very great indeed<br />
and he has br: ought distinction to the various areas with<br />
which he haG been associated.<br />
Senator Gr~. rcs' resignation will take effect from the time<br />
of the swear~ ing in of a successor following the Caucus<br />
meeting on Eondcky afternoon.<br />
Senator Grizacs was minister for Social sectirity in my first<br />
ministry. Since the 1984 election he has been the H4inister<br />
for Comm~ unityr Services. He also held the important<br />
positions o2 Deputy Leader in the Senate and Manager of<br />
Government Business for that Chamber.<br />
Senator Gria-3s entered the Parliament in 1974 as Senator for<br />
Tasmania. Byr 1976, he was a member of the Opposition Shadow<br />
m4inistry whzore he was a principal architect of the ALP's<br />
Gocial security policies.<br />
in all the positions he hold, Senator Grimes has been a<br />
valued colloeague. He brought to his Ministerial and Cabinet<br />
dutiei not only technical expertise from his background as a<br />
medical practitioner but also a breadth of knowledge and<br />
perspective from the wide diversity of his interests. In<br />
both his Senate and Ministerial positions, he combined both<br />
robustness in debate with the ability to negotiate and<br />
conciliate. These attributes had earned him the respect and<br />
admiration of his colleagues and indeed all those with whom<br />
he had contact.<br />
Senator Grimes had a longstanding association with the<br />
Socialist International, where he demonstrated his<br />
commitment to Parliamentary democracy, and the principles of<br />
equality, liberty and social co-operation, objectives for<br />
which the Australian Labor Party stands.<br />
Senator Grimes will remain in the Senate for a short period,<br />
before taking up a senior Government position.<br />
