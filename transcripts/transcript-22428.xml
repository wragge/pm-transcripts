    <content><![CDATA[<p>Wallace (Wally) Brown was one of the most respected and long-serving members of the Federal Parliamentary Press Gallery. He passed away today aged 76.</p>
<p>He came to Canberra to cover national politics for Brisbane's The Courier-Mail in 1961 and remained in the position until 1996. He continued to write a regular column for the Queensland daily until 1999.</p>
<p>He became an institution in Canberra, covering the tenure of 10 Prime Ministers.</p>
<p>He was a shining example to young journalists in the gallery and was respected by both sides of politics. His reporting was insightful, well-sourced and sometimes provocative but always with an eye to domestic affairs in Queensland.</p>
<p>Wally maintained an even-tempered outlook in a highly-charged environment. He reported on much of Australia's modern political history and will be remembered as one of Australia's finest press gallery journalists.</p>
<p>I extend my deepest sympathies to his wife Valerie and three children.</p>
