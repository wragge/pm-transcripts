PRIME MINISTER<br />
CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY<br />
ADDRESS BY THE PRIM MINISTER OF AUSTR~ ALIA<br />
THE HON R J L HAMM! AC NP<br />
AT A RECEPTION HOSTED BY THE MAYOR<br />
VILLERS-BRETONNEUX SUNDAY 18 JUNE 1989<br />
Mr Mayor<br />
Distinguished Guests<br />
Citizens of Villers-Bretonneux<br />
I speak for all my Australian colleagues here today when I<br />
say how deeply moved we are by the warmth and generosity of<br />
the welcome we have received in Villers-Bretonneux.<br />
We are indeed far from home. Yet there is no place in<br />
France, no place in Europe, closer in our country's heart<br />
and in our nation's memories.<br />
It has been made so by the immortal sacrif ice of the f ifteen<br />
thousand Australians who f ought and f ell in these f ields.<br />
It has been made so by the manner in which successive<br />
generations of the people of this region, especially the<br />
children, have honoured that sacrifice and kept its memory<br />
evergreen for nearly three-quarters of a century.<br />
Mr Mayor<br />
One cannot but reflect, on an occasion like this, on the<br />
tremendous tides of human history which brought those young<br />
Australians here, so long ago, so f ar f rom home so many of<br />
them never to return.<br />
We can now see that they were involved, with millions of<br />
their comrades in arms -French, Belgian, British, Canadian<br />
and American in a tremendous and terrible process which is<br />
still at work to this day the unleashing of forces which<br />
continue to shape the destiny, not only of Europe, but of<br />
the whole world. </p>
<p>It is this terrible grandeur this-involvement,, not merely<br />
in a tragic episode, but a tremendous epoch in human history<br />
that gives meaning and dignity to their sacrifice. It is<br />
that which reclaims their memory from the wicked and wanton<br />
waste and unutterable folly and futility of war.<br />
To that waste, the memorials throughout this region of<br />
France bear silent testimony.<br />
They have their counterpart in the cities, towns and viliges<br />
throughout Australia. Even places which did not exist in<br />
their present form have their links.<br />
For example, Hr Mayor, you in Villers-Bretonneux have a<br />
sister relationship with the town of Robinvale in the State<br />
of Victoria, Australia. Robinvale became a township only<br />
after the First World War and then became the centre of an<br />
extensive soldier-settlement area after the Second World<br />
War. But it was named for the son of a farmer in the<br />
district Lieutenant Robin Cuttle, Military Cross killed<br />
in air combat in these skies in May 1918.<br />
Villers-Bretonneux itself, entirely rebuilt from the ruins<br />
of 1918, is now known to many thousands of Australians who<br />
come, year after year, to the memorial and the cemeteries.<br />
They greatly appreciate the warmth of the welcome they<br />
receive here, thanks to the active and continuing efforts of<br />
you, Hr Mayor, and your Council11 of the France-Australia<br />
Association; and of the Commonwealth War Graves Commission<br />
and its staff. They are greatly moved by your faithfulness<br />
to the memory of their fellow Australians who fought and<br />
fell in France. On behalf of the Australian people, I can<br />
assure all here present that we appreciate how much your<br />
efforts over the years have helped maintain the close ties<br />
between our two countries.<br />
It is, therefore, especially gratifying for me today to be<br />
able to announce here that part of Australia's contribution<br />
to the celebration of the Bicentenary of the French<br />
Revolution will be the establishment of a scholarship fund<br />
for the children of the Somme villages. The scholarship,<br />
which will take the form of a $ 50,000 endowment, will<br />
provide assistance to the children of this area to undertake<br />
further education, in either academic or vocational fields.<br />
The scholarship will be called the Sadlier-Stokes Memorial<br />
Scholarship. The name has been chosen to commemorate two<br />
Western Australians, Lieutenant Clifford Sadlier and<br />
Sergeant Charlie Stokes, whose courage and initiative in<br />
attacking and over-running a group of German machine-gunners<br />
kept the allied counter-attack going, and permitted the<br />
liberation of Villers-Bretonneux on the morning of 25 April<br />
1918 itself the most solemn of our Australian </p>
<p>anniversaries the landing on Gallipoli on that first Anzac<br />
Day in 1.915. Lieutenant Sadlier won the Victoria-Cross in<br />
the Action, Sergeant Stokes, the Distinguished Conduct<br />
Medal. Hr Mayor, I count it as a special privilege to be able to<br />
make this, my second official visit to France as Prime<br />
Minister of Australia on the eve of the celebrations of the<br />
French Revolution.<br />
The meaning of the French contribution to modern Australia<br />
can be measured in a single sentence: the whole history of<br />
modern Australia falls within the epoch of civilisation<br />
created by the French Revolution. The Australian<br />
Bicentenary and the Bicentenary of the Revolution stand a<br />
mere year apart. During the whole period of its growth,<br />
therefore, thp na~ tion now called Auctralia has been&amp;<br />
influenced and illuminated by the mighty ideas unleashed by<br />
the French Revolution 200 years ago. From that perspective,<br />
perhaps no nation in the world has better cause to join the<br />
people of France in the celebration of the Revolution not<br />
so much as a tremendous event in history, but as the triumph<br />
of an idea about human dignity, liberty and equality.<br />
Here, at the Somue, how powerfully are we reminded of the<br />
words of the immortal Victor Hugo:<br />
" On resiste a l'invasiom des armees; on ne resiste pas a<br />
l'invasjon des idees." 1<br />
A stand can be made against invasion by an army; no stand<br />
can be made against invasion by an idea.<br />
Two hundred years ago all Europe felt the force and truth of<br />
those words.<br />
Seventy-five years ago, Frenchman and Australians fought<br />
together to prove their truth.<br />
Today they ring around the world. </p>
