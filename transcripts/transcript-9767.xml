SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING, MP<br />
CEDA CONFERENCE APEC AND AUSTRALIAN BUSINESS,<br />
APEC THE OUTLOOK FOR OSAKA<br />
SYDNEY, TUESDAY, 26 SEPTEMBER 1995<br />
I am grateful to CEDA, to the Macquarie Bank and to the other sponsors of<br />
this conference for the effort that has been put into arranging it and for this<br />
invitation to speak to you.<br />
It is proof of APEC's progress that four or five years ago conferences on the<br />
subject were held at universities and attracted largely an audience of<br />
academics and officials.<br />
Now APEC requires practical attention from business people the sort of<br />
attention you have been giving today.<br />
I can't stress too strongly my conviction that a fundamental measure of<br />
APEC's success from Australia's viewpoint will be whether it serves the<br />
needs of Australian business.<br />
Whether it helps you to export your products or services more quickly and<br />
efficiently into currently restricted markets around us.<br />
Whether it maximizes your opportunities to develop cooperative<br />
arrangements with your counterparts in other APEC countries.<br />
Whether it helps create new Australian jobs and develop Australian skills.<br />
I am sometimes accused of being preoccupied with APEC. I am happy to.<br />
wear the charge. But it is not, in fact, true.<br />
I have certainly put a great deal of effort into APEC. And I am convinced it<br />
offers Australia enormous opportunities. </p>
<p>But I am concerned and I think we should all be concerned with something<br />
broader than APEC: by our need to establish in the Asia Pacific structures for<br />
the long term which will cement our integration into the region.<br />
It is no good expecting that our geography alone will deliver the economic<br />
benefits of being part of the fastest growing region in the world.<br />
And it is no good just declaring that Australia's future lies in Asia and<br />
expecting that to be the end of the matter.<br />
It is not the end of the matter for governments and it is not the end of the<br />
matter for business.<br />
Beyond recognition of the fact of our proximity and the fact of the opportunity,<br />
there is a great deal of thinking and a great deal of work that needs to be<br />
done. That is what the act of our engagement demands.<br />
We need sustaining ideas about how to support our involvement and how to<br />
secure the future.<br />
And, above all, we have to be comfortable with Australia's place in Asia.<br />
As I have said before, Australia's engagement with Asia is not a take -it-orleave-<br />
it-affair. Asia is not a target of convenience for us us. It is not a<br />
fashion, or a flavour-of-the-month or a political gimmick.<br />
The structures this Government has been helping to put in place go beyond<br />
APEC. They include the ASEAN Regional Forum, which deals with security<br />
issues, and the new linkages we are establishing between the ASEAN Free<br />
Trade Area and the Australia/ New Zealand CER arrangement.<br />
We have just held the first, successful, AFTA-CER Trade Ministers meeting.<br />
The structures also include the range of bilateral arrangements we have<br />
made with our regional neighbours, such as the Austral ia-Indonesia<br />
Ministerial Forum, which help to open up new areas of cooperation quite<br />
outside traditional diplomatic contacts.<br />
We have been helped greatly in our efforts to build these structures by a<br />
little-remarked but quite historic shift which has taken place in the past year<br />
or so in regional attitudes towards Australia.<br />
I am convinced that, in a way which has never been true in the past, our<br />
friends and neighbours; have recognised that Australia the continent and its<br />
resources, the people and their skills and knowledge, the securedd emocracy<br />
and the strong diverse society represents a substantial asset for the region<br />
as a whole. A substantial asset and a valuable partner. </p>
<p>Evidence of this change was seen, in the unprecedented joint statement<br />
about the Australia-Japan relationship which Prime Minister Murayama and I<br />
issued in May. In that document the government of Japan said it " Welcomes<br />
Australia's decision to create its future in the region and reaffirms that<br />
Australia is an indispensable partner in regional affairs".<br />
It was seen in the comment by President Ramos of the Philippines during his<br />
visit last month that " For clear and practical reasons, the countries of our<br />
region see Australia as an integral and vigorous part of the region"<br />
It was seen the comments of the Indonesian Minister for Research and<br />
Technology, Dr Habibie, when during his visit in May, he described Australia<br />
as an asset in the region.<br />
It was seen in Singapore's decision to establish its airforce flying school in<br />
Western Australia, and in the original proposal by the former deputy Prime<br />
Minister of Thailand, Dr Supachai, for the establishment of links between<br />
AFTA and CER.<br />
One of the reasons behind this change is, I am sure, the conviction in the<br />
region that this Government has committed itself to the cause of engagement<br />
with Asia in a way which Australian Governments have never done before.<br />
This has not always been easy.<br />
To succeed, you cannot regard this country's international relations as<br />
peripheral to our main interests or as a remote sub-branch of domestic<br />
politics.<br />
You can't, for example, refuse, as the opposition did, to meet the Vietnamese<br />
Communist Party leader, Mr Do Muci, in the very week Vietnam became a<br />
member of ASEAN, because you think there might be a handful of votes to be<br />
picked up in western Sydney, and expect that there will be no consequences.<br />
Our effort has to be consistent and unrelenting.<br />
In my three years as Prime Minister, for example, I have visited Indonesia five<br />
times and Japan three times, with a further visit planned for November.<br />
Important national Australian interests are engaged here.<br />
One of those important interests is APEC, and that is what has brought all of<br />
us here.<br />
There is no doubt that APEC offers Australia enormous opportunities. Its 18<br />
members represent the world's fastest growing economies and account for<br />
half the world's output, and nearly half its exports. </p>
<p>In area after area the opportunities are vast. For example, expenditure in<br />
regional markets on telecommunications services and equipment has been<br />
estimated at nearly $ 300 billion by 2010. And the World Bank predicts<br />
investment in energy systems of around $ 500 billion before 2000.<br />
I was in Orange last week talking about the opportunities for Australia to<br />
develop a vastly expanded food industry, capable of becoming a pre-eminent<br />
supplier of fresh and processed food to Asia. Conservative estimates put the<br />
Asian food market at nearly $ 1000 billion by 2000.<br />
Already nearly three quarters of all Australia exports goes to other APEC<br />
members.<br />
And by as soon as next year when our exports to Indonesia and Malaysia<br />
will each exceed our exports to the United Kingdom all our top 10 export<br />
markets will be APEC members.<br />
So it is no wonder that getting APEC right lowering the barriers and keeping<br />
the trade and investment flowing is one of the Government's highest<br />
priorities. Just on a year ago all APEC leaders met at Bogor under President<br />
Soeharto's chairmanship and agreed to the audacious goal of free and open<br />
trade in the region by 2010 for developed countries and 2020 for developing<br />
countries. It is important to remember just how ambitious the Bogor Declaration was.<br />
APEC, after all, covers more trade than either the European Union or the<br />
North American Free Trade Area.<br />
And the Bogor commitment to eliminate allI barriers to free trade and<br />
investment was never attempted in the 40-odd year history of the GATT.<br />
But what brought about the agreement to the Bogor declaration was the<br />
recognition by all the APEC leaders that if we are to maintain the great,<br />
transforming, growth in the Asia Pacific which history will judge to be one of<br />
the defining developments of the late twentieth century it is essential to<br />
maintain the dynamism of regional trade and keep dismantling the barriers.<br />
We estimate that APEC-wide free trade will bring gains to Asia-Pacific<br />
economies of around three times the benefits of the Uruguay Round outcome<br />
alone an amount of more than $ 300 billion a year.<br />
But a view of APEC which only pays attention to its economic dimension is<br />
incomplete. Because although it is an economic and trade body and in my<br />
view should remain one it also has very significant political and strategic<br />
consequences for Australia and our region. </p>
<p>It encourages a continued constructive American engagement in Asia by<br />
keeping open the links across the Pacific. This is important to all of us<br />
because in the absence of a United States balancing security role in the<br />
region, strategic uncertainties would multiply, especially in North Asia, and<br />
the result could be a very dangerous arms race with quite unforeseeable<br />
consequences.<br />
APEC also provides a multilateral framework for regional engagement with<br />
China, whose 1.2 billion people and rapidly growing economy guarantee that<br />
it will be a central factor in regional, indeed in world, affairs into the next<br />
century.<br />
A regional organisation like APEC which engages the three Chinese<br />
economies of China, Chinese Taipei and Hong Kong could probably not be<br />
replicated again. It is certain to be a valuable asset for the region in the<br />
years ahead.<br />
APEC also gives Japan the opportunity to assume some of the higher<br />
international and regional profile to which Australia believes its economic<br />
weight entitles it.<br />
Every step we have taken with APEC has been a step into unmarked territory.<br />
The sort of thing we are trying to do has never been done before.<br />
Quite simply, in APEC we are creating a new style of trade negotiation, but<br />
one which fits the features of our region.<br />
APEC's approach to trade and investment liberalisation will not follow the<br />
model of traditional GATT rounds of trade bargaining. APEC is not about<br />
creating an old fashioned trade arrangement confined to eliminating barriers<br />
to trade at borders. Nor is it about establishing a Europe-style highly<br />
institutionalised political and monetary union.<br />
APEC's approach has already been unique in several ways.<br />
Firstly, APEC has already set the end goal it wishes to reach free trade and<br />
investment in the region by 2010 for developed economies and 2020 for<br />
developing economies.<br />
Secondly, in APEC, developing countries are for the first time, not just<br />
participating in but leading a major trade liberalisation process.<br />
Without President Soeharto's strong leadership, for example, the Bogor<br />
declaration would never have been agreed.<br />
In my discussions with him in Bali a week ago, I was again reassured by the<br />
strength of President Soeharto's commitment to the decisions made at Bogor.<br />
He remains firmly convinced of the benefits which APEC can offer to the<br />
developing country members of APEC. </p>
<p>Thirdly, APEC has had Asian countries at the helm during its critical early<br />
stages. Indonesia was in the chair last year, Japan is now and the<br />
Philippines will be in 1996.<br />
Asian countries have not yet taken a place in international affairs<br />
commensurate with their economic power. In APEC, for the first time, we<br />
have an international forum and an international agenda that is very much<br />
shaped by Asia.<br />
Fourthly, because APEC will build closely on the liberalisation programs on<br />
which most countries in the region are already well embarked, it will be more<br />
comfortable and familiar and more easily accepted as a ' win-win' outcome<br />
than the traditional adversarial approach of the GATT.<br />
Next, progress in APEC is being driven very much by leaders.<br />
The establishment of informal leaders meetings, which I first suggested in<br />
1992, has been critical in setting the agenda and keeping it moving. It was<br />
national leaders who outlined the vision for APEC at Seattle, who set clear<br />
goals at Bogor and who at Osaka in November will set out the blueprint for<br />
getting us there.<br />
There is nothing like an imminent summit of political leaders to galvanise<br />
officials into action, and no-one other than leaders has the authority to take<br />
the hard decisions when these are needed.<br />
The Eminent Persons Group, and the way in which it has reported directly to<br />
leaders on long term directions for APEC, has been important in preserving<br />
the breadth of the APEC vision. Neville Wran has been Australia's<br />
representative on the EPG for the past three years. I can see a continuing<br />
role for an advisory body for leaders of this sort outside the official APEC<br />
structure to keep us focussed on APEC's goals.<br />
Finally, APEC has taken a new approach in the way it has actively and<br />
directly involved business. Business views are sought, taken into account<br />
and affect the outcome of policy decisions in APEC.<br />
The Pacific Business Forum ( PBF), of course, has been advising leaders<br />
directly. At my request, Imelda Roche and Philip Brass have ably and<br />
effectively represented Australia on the Business Forum. Its most recent<br />
report, released last week, will be considered by leaders at Osaka.<br />
Business symposiums are now also regular events around APEC ministerial<br />
meetings. The APEC meeting on small and medium enterprises in Adelaide this month<br />
had an associated business forum attended by around 800 APEC business<br />
people and business exhibitions drawn from all 18 APEC economies. </p>
<p>7<br />
The feedback we have received from Australian business participants has<br />
been overwhelmingly favourable. One of them wrote to the Secretary of our<br />
Department of Industry, Science and Technology that we covered more<br />
ground in two pleasant days in Adelaide than we would probably have<br />
covered in a month had we simply gone directly [ to the region]".<br />
Similar experiences were reported from APEC telecommunications and<br />
transport ministers' meetings earlier this year.<br />
And Indonesia also hosted last week a major APEC government-business<br />
dialogue on regional infrastructure issues.<br />
But whatever APEC's potential, and however interesting and unusual it may<br />
be as a model, what really matters is whether it can continue to deliver the<br />
goods.<br />
We are now just two months away from the Osaka leaders' meeting, which<br />
will be another critical moment in APEC's development.<br />
APEC seems to be full of critical moments. But the reality is that unless it<br />
demonstrates continual progress it runs the risk of marking time while the<br />
march of history leaves it behind.<br />
That would diminish an opportunity of unprecedented dimensions to the 21st<br />
century.<br />
While the task of leaders at Bogor last year was to identify the final<br />
destination for APEC trade cooperation, our job at Osaka will be to agree on<br />
a road map to reach it.<br />
Australia will be looking for commitments from members to table before the<br />
next leaders' meeting at Subic Bay individual country plans showing how and<br />
when they will meet the Bogor free trade commitments, and to a parallel<br />
program of collective liberalisation in those areas ( like mutual recognition of<br />
standards and the harmonisation of regulations) where APEC-wide<br />
agreement is the best way forward.<br />
These action plans will be developed individually, but they will have to meet<br />
agreed guidelines.<br />
And the guiding principles must be sound:<br />
liberalisation must be comprehensive, with sensitive<br />
sectors being handled by phasing in over a longer<br />
period not by excluding them altogether<br />
all countries must begin liberalising at the same time,<br />
even if some move more slowly ( as will happen with </p>
<p>the different end dates for developed and developing<br />
countries) and plans must balance members' interests to ensure<br />
that they all benefit from the liberalisation program.<br />
Plans do not need to be the same for each member. They only need to have<br />
each member proceeding at an adequate and balanced pace down the road<br />
to 2010 or 2020.<br />
The plans will be evolving documents over the 15-25 year period provided for<br />
in Bogor and will be subject to a regular process of peer review. For this<br />
reason, we will probably see in Subic Bay more detailed plans for<br />
liberalisation in the early years, with greater definition of the later years as<br />
plans evolve. What will not change, however, is the end goal already set by<br />
leaders. For trade facilitation issues, where the most sensible way to make progress is<br />
through collective action, I hope at Osaka we will set some clear targets and<br />
dates. For example, adoption by 1996 of a common basis for tariff<br />
classification, agreement to common APEC-wide standards for electronic<br />
import clearance by 2000, or simplification and streamlining of business visas<br />
by 1996.<br />
Final agreement to a full program of collective action may not be possible at<br />
Osaka and further work may be needed. But Osaka should make a good<br />
start. The benefits of collective action in these areas should not be underestimated.<br />
The regional coordination of electricity generating equipment specifications<br />
alone could achieve savings in excess of $ 10 billion.<br />
As agreed at Bogor, leaders at Osaka should also announce a package of<br />
measures to accelerate our Uruguay Round commitments. This<br />
' downpayment' on APEC liberalisation will demonstrate our commitment to<br />
APEC and also represent tangible support for the multilateral trading system.<br />
So by this mixture of individual action plans, collective action and concrete<br />
downpayments we want Osaka to chart APEC's progress over coming years.<br />
In this process Australia will need to be able to check that others are<br />
matching our liberalisation and that there is balance across the board.<br />
The Government will have to work out precisely what progress is required by<br />
our key trading partners before we can determine how and when we will open<br />
our market further.<br />
We also need to know what a commercially relevant program of collective<br />
action might look like. </p>
<p>The survey work CEDA has done for this conference, identifying and<br />
prioritising business views on impediments to trade and investment in the<br />
region, provides essential information for this.<br />
That work is also a powerful reminder of why APEC is important to Australian<br />
business. We have already opened up our economy, and we have reaped the economic<br />
benefits. This is a much more competitive and world-oriented economy than<br />
it was a decade ago.<br />
But, as your survey has shown, we still face serious barriers to some of the<br />
markets around us.<br />
We don't have the size and clout to force those barriers down unilaterally.<br />
And there are few signs that the international community is ready for another<br />
global round of negotiations through the WTO.<br />
So APEC is the best means we have of addressing the problems of access<br />
which Australian businesses face.<br />
It is vital that as APEC develops, and as our national contribution to APEC<br />
evolves, the voice of Australian business is heard clearly. For this reason the<br />
SGovernment needs to establish a clear consultative channel of<br />
communication with business.<br />
The latest Pacific Business Forum report proposes the establishment of a<br />
permanent APEC Business Council, comprising representatives from each<br />
APEC economy, to directly advise leaders and deal with APEC working<br />
groups on business issues. I strongly support this.<br />
But I also think we need to establish a national mechanism to coordinate<br />
Australian business views on APEC and provide input to me and the<br />
Government on the business community's interests in APEC.<br />
I have asked Imelda Roche and Philip Brass, as my PBF representatives, to<br />
liaise with business people and business groups over the next few weeks and<br />
to advise me before Osaka how such a representative national APEC<br />
business body can be best set up.<br />
You will no doubt be reading a good deal about APEC in the weeks ahead,<br />
much of it confusing and some of it contradictory.<br />
I am now very familiar with the pattern of public commentary on APEC. It<br />
goes this way. </p>
<p>First, we are told that our goals are too ambitious and that we are overreaching<br />
ourselves. That was said about the original proposal for APEC,<br />
about the likelihood of getting the ' three Chinas' in, about the prospects for<br />
ever getting all the APEC leaders to meet, and about our chance of having<br />
the Bogor declaration agreed.<br />
The next stage goes " Well, of course you have done that, but the process<br />
has obviously failed because all barriers to trade have not yet been<br />
removed." In fact, of course, none of what we are doing is easy. And the closer we<br />
come to implementing our action plans, the more energetically special<br />
interests will fight. I said we will need to do a lot of thinking and a lot of work<br />
we will also need a lot of determination and a lot of patience.<br />
But bear in mind that APEC has come a long way in six years from a<br />
tentative first meeting of ministers in Canberra in 1989 to the agreement by<br />
the leaders of half the globe at Bogor last year to adopt the goal of regional<br />
free trade and investment.<br />
To put APEC's progress in context, although talk of a common European<br />
market started soon after World War 11t, h e Treaty of Rome was not signed<br />
until the mid fifties and it took until the single market exercise of the eighties<br />
before European countries started addressing fully all the trade impediments<br />
among them.<br />
And more recently, with the Uruguay Round, the total period from the first<br />
negotiations to the final implementation of all agreements will be about 23<br />
years. Will we succeed at Osaka in sustaining APEC's forward momentum?<br />
It is always hard to say, because leaders meet without officials present and<br />
the dynamics are fluid and unpredictable.<br />
The main outstanding issue at the moment looks like being the matter of<br />
" comprehensiveness" that is whether APEC liberalisation will cover all<br />
sectors of our economies and all trade barriers or not.<br />
As you will have seen from newspaper reports, we are encountering<br />
nervousness on the part of a few of the APEC economies surprisingly few I<br />
might say about the coverage of agriculture.<br />
Australia's position is clear. The Bogor declaration is unambiguous on the<br />
question of comprehensive coverage. It refers to the goal of " free and open<br />
trade and investment"; to promoting the " free movement of goods services<br />
and capital"; and to ministers and officials addressing " all impediments to<br />
achieving our goal". </p>
<p>It does not say " free trade except for agriculture".<br />
We all have sensitive sectors for Australia, these might include automobiles<br />
and TCF. The effect of any APEC member excluding one sector from<br />
coverage of the free trade commitment would be that others would also look<br />
for exceptions. This would paralyse APEC.<br />
And agriculture is a vital issue for Australia. We worked for forty three years<br />
to have it addressed in any serious way in the GATT and some of the<br />
language now being used to justify " differential treatment" is all too familiar to<br />
us. The fact of the matter is that the 15 25 year time period leaders set in Bogor<br />
for the achievement of the free and open trade and investment goal provides<br />
ample scope for member economies to undertake any necessary<br />
adjustments. I think, in the end, we will resolve this question successfully because the<br />
overwhelming majority of APEC members strongly support Bogor's<br />
unequivocal intentions on this point.<br />
In this regard, the Osaka meeting in November will be a real test of Japan's<br />
capacity to look beyond sectoral preoccupations and to give a lead to the<br />
countries of this region.<br />
* It has never had a better opportunity than it will have in Osaka, in this<br />
year since the end of the Second World War, to show that it has the capacity<br />
to provide genuine leadership and to help shape the region's future in ways<br />
which will benefit its own people as well as the other economies of the region.<br />
I am sure it will take the right decisions, and I have told Prime Minister<br />
Murayama, MITI Minister Hashimoto and Foreign Minister Kono recently that<br />
Australia is willing to help Japan work for a successful outcome.<br />
A long road lies ahead of us with APEC.<br />
But the benefits for the Australian economy, for Australian businesses and for<br />
Australians now and in the future make it a road we must travel. </p>
