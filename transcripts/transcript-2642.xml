SIR HENRY BOLTE'S RETIREMENT<br />
Tribute by the Prime Minist3r, the Rt Ron. William<br />
McMahon, C. P.<br />
I am sure all my colleagues on the Government side would<br />
want to join me in wishing Sir Henry Bolte a long and happy<br />
retirement. Sir Henry is a great Australian. His achievements are<br />
many and he has given unsurpassed service to Victoria and to the<br />
Liberal Party.<br />
I have always valued his continual goodwill and his wise<br />
and down-to-earth approach to political problems.<br />
CANBERRA, 11 July, 1972. </p>
