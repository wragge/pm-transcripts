PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW WITH RON BELL, RADIO 2GF, GRAFTON<br />
16 AUGUST 1990<br />
E OE PROOF ONLY<br />
BELL: Good morning Mr Hawke.<br />
PM: Thank you very much Ron. It's a great pleasure to be<br />
here with you.<br />
BELL: They mentioned last night in the introductions and<br />
the outros etc that it's your first trip as Prime Minister.<br />
Have you been before?<br />
PM: Yes, and I just passed the pub, walking here, where one<br />
night about ten years ago Hazel and I stayed overnight. We<br />
were on our way from, driving from Sydney up to Brisbane and<br />
we'd gone for ages without being able to find any room at an<br />
iHnont ela. n ywhIe rjeu. s t Wbeu mgpoetd hienrteo tahned wfeenltl owt o itn hef roPnots t oOf ffiit. c e'He<br />
remembered our visit. I remember with pleasure the<br />
magnificent breakfast we had there. But unfortunately it<br />
was a very brief visit.<br />
BELL: You're game mentioning driving up the Pacific<br />
Highway. PM: Well if you want to go the question of the Pacific<br />
Highway we've got, you know, quite a good story on that. I<br />
mean I recognise of course the tragedies that have occurred<br />
there but we have not been idle about that. There are, have<br />
been legitimate concerns about the highway. But as you'd<br />
know Ron, on the 14th of May my Minister, Bob Brown, the<br />
Minister for Land Transport and the NSW Minister for<br />
Transport announced a package of joint Commonwealth-NSW<br />
funding for the highway which will see around some $ 300<br />
million invested over the next three years, which is almost<br />
treble what had been spent over the previous three years.<br />
But we're not only doing that specific expenditure which<br />
will tackle the most cost effective measures to improve it,<br />
like extra overtaking lanes and widening and straightening<br />
dangerous curves, but in the wider sense we're also, in<br />
conjunction with the States, attacking the whole area of<br />
dangerous areas of roads. And even more broadly we're<br />
establishing the National Road Trauma Advisory Council so<br />
that we're going to try and bring in the best independent<br />
expert advise there is as to what are the sort of things,<br />
just in addition to the obvious expenditure on roads, that </p>
<p>governments round Australia ought to do to try and tackle<br />
this major problem.<br />
BELL: Is a part of the problem we're a small country in<br />
people numbers and we're a big country in geographical ways?<br />
PM: It's one of the problems Ron. Obviously youi put your<br />
finger on it. We're 17 million people in the largest island<br />
continent in the world and for us therefore transportation<br />
is a particularly important determinant of both our standard<br />
of living and the quality of life. That's why, since we've<br />
been in government, we have significantly increased in real<br />
terms the amount of funding for roads. I suppose the<br />
Australian people will never feel that governments have<br />
spent as much as they'd like. But it's a question of trying<br />
to get your priorities right. One of the features of<br />
Australia when you're talking about the nature of the size<br />
of our country, one of the problems of course is the<br />
division of responsibilities between the Federal and State<br />
and Local governments. And that's why just recently I made<br />
that major speech in Canberra in which I'm going to be<br />
bringing the Premiers together in the special Premiers'<br />
Conference at the end of October. This is not calculated to<br />
try and have any Party political advantage, but what I want<br />
to do is try and get the Premiers together and say look,<br />
let's just openly, directly and without prejudice examine<br />
the respective functions that we fulfil, Commonwealth and<br />
State, see where there are overlaps, whether there is a more<br />
effective and more efficient way of conducting our business.<br />
I must say Ron I'm very pleased with the very positive<br />
response I've received from the Premiers and I think<br />
Australians can look forward to their politicians and their<br />
governments now tackling this issue in a more effective way.<br />
BELL: If we can go back to March 24, that Saturday night,<br />
did you prior to then think two fairly political<br />
lightweights from the North Coast would be so critical on<br />
that evening?<br />
PM: Well let me say, I'll tell you honestly what had<br />
happened. On the Thursday night in Sydney I'd had some<br />
people into Kirribilli. We were doing a little bit of<br />
fundraising. Stephen Loosley said to me after they'd gone,<br />
we were just having a cup of tea together, he said we'll<br />
deliver you Page. I said really. He said yes, we'll<br />
deliver you Page. I said that's marvellous. And he said,<br />
I'll tell you one thing, he said, this will come as a<br />
surprise to you. He said keep your eye on Richmond. I said<br />
you're joking. He said no I'm not, you keep your eye on it.<br />
So you see that Loosley at least had a feeling that we could<br />
make it. I at that stage hadn't had the pleasure really of<br />
knowing Harry Woods he's sitting here next to me as I talk<br />
to you but I've obviously got to know him well since his<br />
election. It doesn't surprise me that he won because he's a<br />
great bloke and he obviously has got the qualities that I<br />
think the people in this electorate will find attractive.<br />
He will consolidate this seat. After this of course I'm<br />
going on to Richmond and we'll talk about that there. But </p>
<p>I'm here with Harry and I think you will find that this is<br />
going to be cemented as a Labor seat.<br />
BELL: Just touching on the up and corners in the Party. In<br />
your Ministry we've had two recent visitors here to the<br />
electorate through the work of Harry David Beddall and<br />
Robert Tickner just this week. They're very impressive<br />
young men.<br />
PM: Thanks Ron, yes they are. We're very fortunate in that<br />
regard. Even our political opponents have acknowledged that<br />
the quality of the Ministry I've been able to have around me<br />
since ' 83, but you go to at that point we've got a<br />
reservoir of young talent there and you certainly refer to<br />
two that come into that category.<br />
BELL: Last night you referred a couple of times to using<br />
the words sustainable development. Some people either don't<br />
want to hear those words or refuse to accept them. How do<br />
we get them to accept that we have to have sustainable<br />
development in this country?<br />
PM: Well I think it's a question of education, of<br />
reiteration of issues, but most importantly it's the<br />
creation of processes. That's what I've been about, in two<br />
ways Ron. Firstly I established the Resource Assessment<br />
Commission. That was before the election. Now that's a<br />
body headed up by Mr Justice Stewart. That's going to<br />
address major broad issues like forests, coastal development<br />
and the question of possible development in the southern<br />
part of Kakadu Park. Now under that process it will mean<br />
that those who want to see development, those who want to<br />
put environmental arguments are going to have this totally<br />
independent national body that they can go to, put their<br />
arguments and their case, then that Resource Assessment will<br />
then make recommendations to the Government. I think that<br />
must give confidence to the community and to particular<br />
interest groups that they are going to have a full and<br />
unfettered right to put their case and that decisions are<br />
going to be made on the basis of independant advice. So<br />
that's one part. The second process is, you talk about<br />
sustainable development, I've now with my colleagues set up<br />
groups in various sectors of industry, without being<br />
exhaustive, covering manufacturing, covering tourism,<br />
covering agriculture, covering forests. on those committees<br />
that we'll be establishing the actual development people<br />
will be represented, the environmental people will be<br />
represented, the trade union movement will be represented.<br />
And in that way we will translate from the rhetoric of<br />
sustainable development into a process which will enable<br />
people to be heard and I think confidence to be engendered<br />
into the decision-making process. I think that's the way<br />
you've got to do it.<br />
BELL: No doubt Harry Woods has brought your attention to a<br />
problem that could be coming up here with a forest to the<br />
west of Grafton, the Billilimbra State Forest and the<br />
logging of that, or proposed logging of part of it. That, </p>
<p>as has been detailed there in the paper that you're looking<br />
at, if the forest is locked up it's going to be a disaster<br />
for this area. Can Harry, through you, seek your into<br />
that? PM: Yes sure. You'll appreciate that in the area we're<br />
talking about here, this is a State Government area of<br />
responsibility. I'm not saying that to try and dodge your<br />
question. But it does go back to a thing that I was talking<br />
about before, about the division of responsibility in this<br />
country between State Governments and the Federal<br />
Government. Now what we try and do in the Federal<br />
Government is to say where there are areas of State<br />
responsibility we ask them and we expect them to carry it<br />
out with due regard for the sorts of considerations that<br />
I've been talking about growth considerations and<br />
environmental considerations. But to the extent that there<br />
is any relevance for us in our area of responsibility, I<br />
know that Harry will make representations to our appropriate<br />
Ministers if there is a role for Federal Government. But<br />
you see we've got this, you know, just part of this broader<br />
problem that we've got. You can't have the argument<br />
sensibly conducted by saying it is for Australia either<br />
development or the environment. You've just got to get the<br />
balance. It's just inevitable in that situation Ron that on<br />
some occasions one interest or other is going to say you're<br />
wrong. BELL: Some of the radicals on either side say we can't<br />
accept PM: And that's the importance of processes that I was<br />
talking about before. If they see that you're dinkum about<br />
creating the opportunity for a fair hearing and independent<br />
assessment I think that's the most they can ask.<br />
BELL: I don't want to get bogged down in the Middle East<br />
thing, I don't know enough about it. I just want to ask you<br />
a question. Obviously when you made the decision to send<br />
the Australian naval ships there you would have expected<br />
some criticism. How do you convince those people what you<br />
have done is for the long term benefit of this country?<br />
BELL: Again by exposition. I of course will be making a<br />
statement in the Parliament but if I could just share<br />
briefly my thoughts with you. I've said, it's a paradox,<br />
I've said it's the most serious decision I've made as Prime<br />
Minister, but in the end it was also an easy decision<br />
because the principles and the issues are quite clear. And<br />
that is that if you read the history of the 20th Century<br />
there is one thing that stands out with dramatic clarity in<br />
that dreadful dismal decade of the 30s. That the world was<br />
subjected to the horror of the Second World War through a<br />
combination of two things. It was not only the villainy of<br />
Naziism and those associated axis forces that was an<br />
important precondition of the dastardly things that happened<br />
in the 30s. But the other precondition, without which it<br />
wouldn't have happened, was the appeasement of those with </p>
<p>the power to stop evil. I've just recently read a massive<br />
two volume biography of Winston Churchill by William<br />
Manchester and what burned clearly into my mind was that at<br />
the end of the Second World War there shouldn't have been<br />
one Nuremburg trial, there should have been two. One for<br />
the Nazis and one for the appeasers. Because it took the<br />
both of them to produce the tragedy of the Second World War.<br />
In other words, if the world community wants to have<br />
respected the principle of the independence of sovereign<br />
nations and the rejection of the right of naked aggression<br />
to acquire and annex neighbouring countries, then the world<br />
has to be prepared to give effect to its principles.<br />
BELL: One of the critics has been the Iraqi Ambassador, and<br />
my apologies for not recalling his name, but am I being<br />
pedantic if I suggest that he should be asked to go home?<br />
PH: Not being pedantic but it's a wrong suggestion, with<br />
respect Ron. Because you must recognise that one of the<br />
deep concerns that I had in my mind in coming to this<br />
S decision was the position of Australians in Iraq. We have<br />
the position there where we are diplomatically represented<br />
and well represented and our Ambassador there and our staff<br />
are constantly making representations to the Iraqi<br />
government about the welfare and safety of our citizens. It<br />
wouldn't be conducive to our capacity to keep doing that if<br />
we were to say of f you go.<br />
BELL: It was rumoured last night, and what letter they were<br />
referring to I don't know, but they were saying you had a<br />
letter from Hussein, whether that's the President or the<br />
King, I'm not sure.<br />
PM: No, from the Emir of Kuwait.<br />
BELL: Right, so everybody had it wrong then<br />
PM: I don't<br />
SBELL: last night, yes it was just a rumour.<br />
PM: The letter that I've had, I mean I don't know whether<br />
there's some reference to another one that I haven't seen<br />
that's just come in in the last few hours or something. But<br />
the letter I had was from the Emir of Kuwait asking us for<br />
assistance under Section 51 of the United Nations Charter.<br />
That section of the United Nations Charter gives the right<br />
of collective security at the request of a member nation who<br />
is being subjected to aggression. My advice from the<br />
Attorney-General's Department, the Department of Foreign<br />
Affairs, and my own reading of the situation assures me that<br />
that gives us the Section 51 together with the request<br />
that we've had from the Emir of Kuwait gives us legal<br />
sanction for what we're doing.<br />
BELL: The subject came up somewhere along the line, last<br />
night I think when you were referring to the Budget, and </p>
<p>there are hard times ahead next week. Can we recover that<br />
title of the lucky country in Australia?<br />
PM: I hope we never again get that title. That might sound<br />
a funny thing to say, but in many senses the title of the<br />
lucky country was not good for us. What do I mean by that?<br />
I mean this. There was reason, there was reason-for the<br />
title lucky country because compared to so many other<br />
countries we were and are extraordinarily fortunate. The<br />
characteristics of that good fortune are these. I mean we<br />
are a united country. We have enormous resources, natural<br />
resources. We have a great people. We have a commitment to<br />
the processes of parliamentary democracy. We're close to<br />
the fastest-growing region of the world. I mean facts which<br />
in a sense entitle you to describe yourself as lucky. But<br />
unfortunately it also reflected the fact that it all came<br />
too easy. If you look in the post-war period you had a<br />
world devastated by the destruction of the Second World War<br />
and the world was crying out for the things that we so<br />
easily produced, our food. We got record prices and that<br />
0 enabled us to have the economic capacity to have a massive<br />
immigration program which enlarged and enriched our country.<br />
We did it in those circumstances behind tariff walls which<br />
enabled us to build up manufacturing industry. It was all<br />
too easy. When the world prices for our grains and our meat<br />
and our wool, when they tumbled down we then got into our<br />
vast mineral expansion and the world wanted all those<br />
things. It all came easy. It was lucky. And that<br />
engendered, I think, too many assumptions on the part of us<br />
all of employers, trade unions, politicians that it was<br />
there for the taking. The fruit was on the tree grab it.<br />
But you didn't really have to think about how you grew the<br />
trees, how you created competitive industries. Now the<br />
world has long since lost any idea that it owes Australia a<br />
living, if it ever had that idea. We've got to understand<br />
that we've got to work hard for it.<br />
BELL: Just a couple of quickies. As Prime Minister you get<br />
to go to a lot of places. Do you get to see many of those<br />
places? Like you're in Grafton, are you disappointed you<br />
can't spend a day or two here to have a look<br />
PM: Yes. It looks to me lovely. May I say to the citizens<br />
of Grafton and the region, your weather beats the hell out<br />
of Canberra at the moment. But I had the invitation last<br />
night for instance to come back next year for your July race<br />
meeting, special meeting, and I'm certainly going to try and<br />
do that. I'd like to do that.<br />
BELL: And you're a punter, a betting man. Who will be the<br />
next Prime Minister?<br />
PM: Well it will be a Labor bloke.<br />
BELL: Mr Beazley or Mr Keating?<br />
PM: Look, I've said that Paul Keating is the fellow who I<br />
think has got the I don't say I think who I know has got </p>
<p>7<br />
the experience and the commitment. I would imagine, I would<br />
think that that would be, whenever the time comes that I<br />
give it away, I would believe that he would be the choice of<br />
the Party. Paul understands, I understand, that that's a<br />
matter for the Caucus. But that's what I think the decision<br />
would be.<br />
BELL: When we see you on television, when they do close-ups<br />
of you it comes in on the face, I've often been fascinated<br />
by the lapel badge. What is that? I often thought it was a<br />
Rotary badge.<br />
PM: No, it's something of which I'm very very proud. I<br />
received that in 1979, the last full year in which I was<br />
President of the ACTU. It's the Order of Australia at the<br />
category of Companion. It's the Companion Order which is<br />
the highest level of the Order of Australia other than the<br />
Knighthood, and we don't believe in those as you know.<br />
That was awarded to me in the period of the Fraser<br />
government. Not by the government because the committee<br />
which makes these decisions is at arms length from<br />
government. They decided that what I'd done in Australia<br />
and the Labor movement and beyond was something that<br />
warranted that and I'm very proud of it. So I wear it<br />
regularly. BELL: Do you have a number of them, because surely you'd be<br />
changing suits every five minutes almost wouldn't you?<br />
PM: I've got a spare.<br />
BELL: You've got a spare. Mr Prime Minister, thank you for<br />
joining us and I hope you enjoy your trip to the north<br />
coast. We'd like to see you back here again.<br />
PM: Thank you very much Ron. I've enjoyed it very much.<br />
