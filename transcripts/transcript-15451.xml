    <content><![CDATA[<p>I am pleased to announce today that the Australian Government will contribute $326,700 toward the expansion of Adelaide's Star of the Sea Marine Discovery Centre.</p>
<p>This project will improve access to services by expanding the Marine Discovery Centre to meet increasing demand for marine education. It will provide a social and educational facility for the community.</p>
<p>The Australian Government's contribution through the Regional Partnerships program will allow the Centre to develop into a leading-edge environmental learning facility with the capacity to host more than double the current number of visitors annually.</p>
<p>Extending the Marine Discovery Centre will help cut the two year waiting list for primary and high school student groups to visit the centre.</p>
<p>The Star of the Sea Marine Discovery Centre expansion is another example of how the Regional Partnerships program directly benefits local communities around Australia.  </p>
