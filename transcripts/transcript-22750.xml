<p>Papua New Guinea is Australia’s nearest neighbour and one of our most important bilateral partners.  </p>

<p>The level of Australian investment in PNG, including through participation in the landmark PNG LNG project, has grown five-fold in five years and today stands at $19 billion. </p>
<p>In Port Moresby, the Prime Minister will meet Prime Minister Peter O’Neill to discuss priority bilateral interests, including joint work in policing and health.</p>
<p>With PNG and Australia playing important leadership roles in the Pacific, the Prime Ministers will also discuss cooperation on shared regional challenges.</p>
