PRIME MINISTER 109/ 92<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING, MP<br />
NORTH WEST CAPE NAVAL COMMUNICATION STATION<br />
The Government is pleased to announce that an Australian,<br />
Commander Cris George, assumes command today of the North<br />
West Cape Naval Communication. Station.<br />
Today's command change is part of a phased handover of the<br />
Station to Australian control, which will see it become an<br />
entirely Australian facility by the end of the century. The<br />
transition in the Station's management is the result of<br />
arrangements worked out between the Australian and United<br />
States Governments, and the State Government of Western<br />
Australia. Since the Station commenced operation in the 1960s to serve<br />
the needs of US Navy submarines, it has been a fine example<br />
of defence coopetration between Australia and theUnited_<br />
States._ The Station has operated as a joint facility since<br />
1974, enabling the Royal Australian Navy, as well as the US<br />
Navy, to carry out vital communication with their<br />
submarines. The Station's work under Australian control will continue to<br />
be important in allowing the RAN to communicate with its<br />
submarine force, a force whose effectiveness will be greatly<br />
enhanced as the Collins Class submarines come into service<br />
from 1995.<br />
The Australian Government also welcomes continuing US joint<br />
use of the Station until the end of the decade. The<br />
Government values highly the continuing contribution that<br />
our alliance partnership with the United States makes to<br />
Australian and regional security.<br />
The Government's defence policy has been focused on<br />
achieving greater self reliance within the framework of a<br />
strong alliance with the United States and effective<br />
regional cooperation. </p>
<p>The Government will be represented at the command handover<br />
ceremony by the Hon Gordon Bilney MP, Acting Minister for<br />
Defence. I join with Mr Bilney in assuring all Australians,<br />
and the local community in particular, that the North West<br />
Cape Communication Station will continue to play an integral<br />
part in the defence of Australia well into the next century.<br />
