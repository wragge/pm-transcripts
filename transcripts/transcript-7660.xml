WASHINGTON 26 JUNE 1.989<br />
It is now almost four decades since Australia and the Unil: 6G<br />
States signed the ANZUS Treaty. For all the immense changes<br />
which have occurred a region remade, a world transformed<br />
our alliance remains vital, relevant and contemporary. It<br />
has done so, because both Australia and the United states<br />
have creatively adapted the alliance to new imperatives and<br />
new challenges.<br />
An alliance founded on fear of immediate regional threat in<br />
the Pacific the then recent memory in Australia of how<br />
close we came to invasion by Japan -has taken its place as<br />
part of the wider Western alliance directed at maintaining<br />
global security.<br />
An alliance conditioned by the early years of the cold war<br />
now forms a framework for consultation and co-operation in<br />
the emerging new era of reduced East-West tension.<br />
Au alliance originally concerned with military containment<br />
has taken on additional roles, including the underpinning of<br />
arms control agreements between the superpowers.<br />
An alliance founded, in the minds of many Australians, upon<br />
deep apprehension of instability and uncertainty in Asia has<br />
retained its relevance in a period of Asian dynamism,<br />
development and prosperity.<br />
An alliance which once had on its consultative agenda only<br />
security and political concerns has become a forum for<br />
discuss ion also of important economic issues.<br />
An alliance which Australians initially saw as providing,<br />
above all, an American commitment to Australia's security in<br />
the event of attack, has become a vehicle for continuing<br />
collaboration in support of our national policy of defence<br />
self-reliance. </p>
<p>And because we have managed to keep the alliance<br />
contemporary in these ways, our commitment to it has endured<br />
and remains today unequivocal. And these are the reasons<br />
why we host Joint Defence facilities; why we welcome United<br />
states ship and aircraft visits; why we share in<br />
intelligence exchanges; and why we co-operate in defence<br />
procurement, training and exercising.<br />
it is true very regrettably so that for the time being<br />
at least, the third party to ANZUS, New Zealand, is no<br />
longer an active partner. Its position . on ship visits will<br />
have to change for it again to become one.<br />
But my point is that as far as Australia and the United<br />
States are concerned the alliance remains as vital and as<br />
strong as it has ever been.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen,<br />
it is not just or most importantly the alliance between<br />
Australia and the United States which is adapting to<br />
fundamentally changing circumstances in the world. The<br />
Western alliance generally, and especially NATO, is doing<br />
so. This is as it should be, for the West as a whole now<br />
has a tremendous opportunity and responsibility to look<br />
beyond its traditional rationale of military defence and<br />
deterrence against attack important though that remains.<br />
The West can and must grasp new opportunities to achieve<br />
security of a deeper and more enduring kind.<br />
That concept of security has, I suggest, the following<br />
elements: the improvement of East-West relations<br />
the continuing quest for disarmament and effective arms<br />
control measures<br />
enhanced international economic co-operation and,<br />
particularly, the replacement of shortsighted attitudes<br />
by enlightened self-interest in international trade<br />
international co-operation for the resolution of<br />
conflict and the-harnessing of international effort from East,<br />
West and the Third World to resolve issues vital to the<br />
future of mankind, notably the protection of the<br />
environment.<br />
in each of* these fields Australia will play its part. </p>
<p>In East-West relations and arms control, the present<br />
situation is qualitatively quite different from that which<br />
applied at the time of the failed attempt at detente in the<br />
19701s. Western policy failed then because, in seeking to<br />
moderate Soviet international behaviour, it made no demands<br />
for reform or the extension of human rights in the Soviet<br />
system itself. That policy effectively only allowed the old<br />
Soviet rulers to delay the inevitable reforms that Mr<br />
Gorbachev has now undertaken.<br />
But the pack ice of the cold war is thaing. A new, more<br />
soundly based, detente is now open to us. This time it is<br />
not a matter of trying to buy improved international conduct<br />
from the Soviet Union and its allies. our role must be to<br />
encourage changes in conduct which they themselves have<br />
already decided, for reasons of their own self-interest,<br />
must be made. Greater freedom, tolerance of a greater range<br />
of opinions, a more honest way of looking at their past<br />
history and their present problems these can be seen in<br />
the Soviet Union, in Hungary, in Poland.<br />
In these countries the requirements of economic reform the<br />
recognition that the command economy cannot deliver the<br />
goods are being accompanied by a heartening degree or<br />
political reform.<br />
I do not want to overstate this. The trend is not uniform<br />
throughout Eastern Europe. Glasnost and Perestroika have a<br />
long way to go. in China, the recent tragic and brutal<br />
evets show that a l6adaL~ hiy Whl4lk jVuuu&amp; OLd ftUU1Uuzuh<br />
reform is nevertheless capable of supressing aspirations for<br />
democracy in the most repugnant and, I believe, ultimately<br />
futile fashion.<br />
Nonetheless what we are seeing in different ways is<br />
unambiguous evidence that the system of Marxism-Leninism and<br />
of the command economy is being strained to breaking point.<br />
Accompanying these domestic changes in the East we are<br />
mwa'in mre conatructive international behaviour. 1 nave<br />
said before that the West must insist upon deeds, not just<br />
words. But deeds there have been in the INF Treaty, in<br />
Afghanistan, in Indo-China and, only this week, in Angola.<br />
For the West, what is required is firmness, patience and<br />
courage. These qualities are fully demonstrated in<br />
President Bush's dramatic and farsighted proposal for<br />
conventional force reductions in Europe. </p>
<p>America's allies can and must play an important part in the<br />
process of realistic arms control and reduction of tensions.<br />
For our part, for example, Australia's sponsorship of the<br />
South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone and our initiative against<br />
the proliferation of chemical weapons in Southeast Asia<br />
supplement our support for global nuclear non-proliferation<br />
and a global ban on chemical weapons.<br />
Our hosting of the Government-industry Conference on<br />
Chemical Weapons in Canberra in September~ will give a<br />
valuable stimulus to efforts to exorcise this opectre.<br />
And in seeking to develop our own relations with the Soviet<br />
Union, we will always keep in view the wider Western<br />
perspective. Ladies and gentlemen,<br />
The next factor I mentioned was the operation of the<br />
international trading system. And here I have to say that<br />
aspects of the Western performance in recent years leave<br />
much to be desired. We must improve our performance if<br />
international economic security is to be assured.<br />
We have built our prosperity in the post-war period<br />
essentially on the foundations of an open trading system.<br />
It has brought tremendous benefits to Americans, to<br />
Europeans, to Japanese and to Australians.<br />
Yet the future of this system hangs in the balance. To<br />
succeed in the current round of multilateral trade<br />
negotiations would bring tremendous benefits. To fail would<br />
be disastrous.<br />
In this negotiation, Australia has many interests. But<br />
pro-eminently our concerns and our hopes relate to<br />
agriculture for it has been there, more than any other<br />
sector, where distortions and irrationality have emerged and<br />
have prevailed largely unchecked. I-. urge Upon Europe,<br />
Japan, and the United States our major trading partners<br />
with whom we generally enjoy excellent commercial relations<br />
-a new approach to agriculture, one based, as I have said,<br />
on enlightened self-interest.<br />
Naturally, I focus in this forum on the United States. </p>
<p>to. -b<br />
Australia recognises that the provisions of the 1985 US Farm<br />
Bill and, in particular, export subsidies encompassed in the-<br />
Export Enhancement Program were developed to counter the<br />
incursions made by subsidised European community production<br />
in world agricultural markets. Australia shares US concerns<br />
about EC subsidy policies pursued under the Common<br />
Agricultural Policy and for many years has been engaged in a<br />
process of trying to limit the damaging effects of the CAP<br />
on world agricultural trade. I expressed our very strong<br />
objections in Paris and London last week-and will do so in<br />
Bonn this week.<br />
Australia recognises also that, in implementing the EEP, the<br />
US has not intended to harm non-subsidising agricultural<br />
exporters such as Australia.<br />
Nevertheless, Australia has found itself in the crossfire or<br />
the escalating export subsidy war and our grain exports have<br />
been adversely affected. while the damage has lessened over<br />
the past year or sop owing to lower world grain harvests and<br />
a running down of stocks, there remains a danger that<br />
competitive export subsidisation will again damage Australia<br />
when grain surpluses re-emerge.<br />
Australia is therefore disappointed that the United States<br />
does not yet accept that the EEP has had harmful effects on<br />
Australia effects similar to those resulti'ng from EC<br />
subsidies provided under the CAP.<br />
However, we have reached substantial agreement on the fact<br />
that such distorting arrangements are, in the longer term,<br />
damaging to international trade and that they all should be<br />
on the table in the context of the Uruguay MTN Round.<br />
This provides something of a breathing space for the US and<br />
Australia on the EEP issue. The Uruguay Round is scheduled<br />
to conclude at the end of 1990, when the us is also<br />
scheduled to introduce successor legislation to the 1985<br />
Farm Bill. The ZEP is likely to have a minimal immediate<br />
effect on Australia up to the end of 1990 compared to the<br />
earlier years of its operation. This is because wheat is inshort<br />
supply globally, not least because of two successive<br />
US droughts. World wheat prices are therefore relatively<br />
high and the outlook is reasonably optimistic at least until<br />
the end of 1990.<br />
All this means that if we can achieve a successful outcome<br />
on agriculture from the Uruguay Round by the end of 1990,<br />
arnd, out of these negotiations, the US is able to look againat<br />
the role of the EEP in its farm policy, then we may have<br />
found a solution to this problem which exists between us.<br />
That would be very welcome, for it has been a major problem<br />
in our relations.<br />
.0 ' t a L Vat) Z. 4 6 40 </p>
<p>We must work closely together over the next 18 months to<br />
keep national and international reform of agricultural trade<br />
high on the international agenda and to work together on the<br />
difficult task of achieving a successful outcome to the<br />
Round. In case this sounds like special pleading, let me make this<br />
wider point both Australia and the United States realise<br />
that unless an acceptable outcome can be negotiated in the<br />
Uruguay Round on agriculture, other sectoral negotiations in<br />
the round wil11 be imperilled. All countries, whatever their<br />
trading interests, will be the losers.<br />
Ladies.-and gentlemen,<br />
An in the security and arms control area which I mentioned,<br />
in the economic area too Australia has tried in our regional<br />
policies to support wider global objectives in this case a<br />
fair and open international trading system.<br />
one of the major features of the coming decade will, in my<br />
view, be the continuing dynamic growth of! the economies of<br />
the Western Pacific and South East Asia.<br />
So, last January in Seoul, I referred to the desirability of<br />
now taking new and practical steps to enhance economic<br />
co-operation in this region. I suggested then the creation<br />
of a consultative economic forum, which would continue into<br />
the 909 and which would need to be serviced by modest<br />
institutional arrangements.<br />
I have in mind that Ministers from the South East Asia and<br />
Western Pacific region, together with the United States and<br />
Canada, should come together to discuss how best to advance<br />
regional economic co-operation, and to explore how we may<br />
build on the new economic interdependencies and new<br />
opportunities which have arisen in this part of the world.<br />
we have sought to develop this proposal carefully with our<br />
partners in the region, on the basis of consensus and I am<br />
glad to say that it has gathered an encouraging momentum.<br />
During intensive consultations over the past couple of<br />
months, we have found, without exception, general support<br />
both for the concept that the time has come to advance<br />
regional economic co-operation in a concrete way; and for<br />
our proposal to hold an initial ministerial level meeting<br />
later this year to pursue this objective.<br />
I believe that, with political will, vision and leadership,<br />
reservations which inhibited the development of similar<br />
ideas in the 70s and early 80a will, as this decade draws to<br />
a close, be dispelled. The time has come. </p>
<p>In case there are any lingering doubts in this country or<br />
anywhere else I should stress, again, that what we are<br />
proposing is not a trade bloc. The countries of the region<br />
would not tou-ch this with a forty-foot pole, and rightly<br />
The whole thrust of our overseas trade policy is based on<br />
the need to work for the success of an open multilateral<br />
trading system.<br />
In referring to this Australian initiative, I wish at the<br />
same time to make it absolutely clear that we want and<br />
welcome the continued strong presence of--the United States<br />
in the region political, strategic and economic.<br />
As Pacific friends and allies we hope that the United<br />
States, which has such strong economic links with the<br />
countries of South East Asia and the Western Pacific, will<br />
participate constructively in our initiative.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen,<br />
Today marks the 44th Anniversary of the signing in San<br />
Francisco of the United Nations charter.<br />
I know that there have been times when, in this country, the<br />
UN has hardly been regarded as congenial to Western<br />
interests.<br />
But those days are past.<br />
Not only is the United Nations playing a revitalised rolefor<br />
example, in the Persian Gulf, in Namibia, in Afghanistan<br />
and elsewhere. There are simply some tasks of such<br />
universal importance, and of such universal character, that<br />
they can only be accomplished in the spirit of genuine<br />
internationalism, which was envisaged at San Francisco on<br />
this day in 1945.<br />
That is why I ref erred to the need to harness international<br />
co-operation across the divide of ideology and across the<br />
divide of economic development to tackle the threat to our<br />
environmental1 security.<br />
If one nation pollutes-the air or the oceans, or squanders<br />
its irreplaceable legacy of forests or living species, that<br />
is a loss not just for that nation, today, but for all<br />
nations. Recently a great deal of attention has been focused on the<br />
Antarctic because of the discovery of the hole in the ozone<br />
layer above that continent. Let me draw your attention to a<br />
pressing issue concerning what is one and beneath, the<br />
surface of the continent itself the issue of mining and<br />
oil drilling in Antarctica. </p>
<p>Australia has recently decided not to sign the Antarctic<br />
minerals convention because we did not believe that it<br />
provided proper safeguards against damage to this the last<br />
pristine continent. We believe all mining activity in<br />
Antarctica should be banned.<br />
We seek instead a comprehensive Antarctic environment<br />
protection convention and the creation of a Wilderness<br />
Reserve. We do so, of course, within the Antarctic Treaty<br />
System. Both our countries are foundation and active<br />
members of this Treaty which has served humanity well for<br />
more than a quarter of a century.<br />
The principal objective of an Antarctic Environment<br />
Protection Convention would be the conservation and<br />
protection of Antarctica's unique environment and its<br />
dependent and associated ecosystems.<br />
Let me takce this opportunity, for the first time publicly,<br />
to spell out the main elements I believe such a Convention<br />
should contain<br />
an agreement to protect Antarctica's environment and<br />
ecosystems, fully respect its wilderness qualities,<br />
respect its significance for regional and global<br />
environments, and protect its scientific value;<br />
a ban on mining;<br />
in regard to other activities, arrangements which will<br />
let us assess the impact of proposed Antarctic<br />
activities or facilities;<br />
a means of determining whether sufficient knowledge<br />
exists to enable adequate impact assessment;<br />
an agreement not to undertake activities where there is<br />
insufficient knowledge to judge whether they are<br />
environmentally sound;<br />
and, criteria and standards to enable those judgements<br />
to be made.<br />
We have already received support from the French and Indian<br />
Governments on this issue; and I very much hope the US<br />
Government will, in time, lend its support.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen, </p>
<p>There are many other issues of great interest to Australia<br />
and the United states which, if time permitted, I would have<br />
liked to discuss and which I will be further discussing with<br />
the President, other Administration officials and members of<br />
the Congress. But clearly in this forum I owe it to you to<br />
allow you to determine the agenda, in the session of<br />
questions and answers.<br />
So I conclude these remarks with a reference to that stout<br />
champion of the freedom of the press Thomas Jefferson.<br />
in his first Inaugural in 1801, Jefferson stated as a<br />
guiding principle for the Republic " peace, commerce, honest<br />
friendship with all nations entangling alliances with<br />
none". The imperatives of history, and of America's own destiny,<br />
have involved the United States in many alliances -though I<br />
trust the American people, at least in Australia's case,<br />
find no sense of entanglement.<br />
And indeed our alliance is only a means to those other goals<br />
and principles set by Jefferson peace, commerce and honest<br />
friendship.<br />
Our friendship, our alliance, our capacity to work together<br />
Ear from compromising Jefferson's laudable wider<br />
objectives can positively contribute to a safer, more<br />
prosperous and better world. </p>
