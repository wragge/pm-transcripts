    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Secretary to the Treasury, Mr John Fraser, has advised me that he wishes to tender his resignation with effect from Tuesday 31 July 2018.</p>
<p>Mr Fraser should be proud of his contribution to Australian economic policy over many years.</p>
<p>In the last three and a half years in the role as Treasury Secretary Mr Fraser has led Treasury to new heights, especially in the areas of corporate and personal income tax reform. He has strongly supported the Government's efforts to help repair the Budget. He has been a trusted adviser to the Treasurer, Ministers and myself on key economic matters.</p>
<p>On behalf of the Government, I thank him for his service to the Australian community and our economy.</p>
<p>Subsequent to Mr Fraser's resignation, the Governor-General has agreed to my recommendation to appoint Mr Philip Gaetjens as the next Secretary to the Treasury.</p>
<p>Mr Gaetjens has held leadership roles in the Commonwealth and State public sectors including as Secretary of the New South Wales Treasury between 2011 and 2015 and has served as a senior executive in the Commonwealth Treasury, the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet and the South Australian Department of Treasury and Finance. He has recently departed as the Chief of Staff to the Treasurer, a role he also undertook for the Hon Peter Costello MP when he was Treasurer. He also previously served overseas as the inaugural Director of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Policy Support Unit, Singapore during 2008-2010.</p>
<p>The appointment of Mr Gaetjens puts Treasury in good stead for the future.</p>
