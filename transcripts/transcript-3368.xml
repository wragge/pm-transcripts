PRIME MINISTER PRESS STATEMENT NO. 312<br />
31 August 1974<br />
DEATH OF NEW ZEALAND PRIME MINISTER<br />
Norman Kirk's death is a deeply tragic loss for New<br />
Zealand, Australia and the Pacific region.<br />
New Zealand has lost a great leader. Australia has<br />
lost a firm friend. The Pacific and South East Asian region<br />
has lost a forceful and creative spokesman. The cause of<br />
democratic socialism throughout the world has lost one of its<br />
pillars of strength and sources of inspiration.<br />
I have lost a dear and most highly valued friend.<br />
We share a common ground of political experience in good times<br />
and bad and an identity of basis beliefs which gave a closeness<br />
and value to our personal relationship quite beyond the ordinary.<br />
We became Prime Ministers of the two Pacific partners<br />
within a week of one another and since that time have maintained<br />
the closest communications including our five meetings in Wellington,<br />
Apia, Ottawa, Canberra and Christchurch.<br />
Under his Prime Ministership relations between New<br />
Zealand and Australia reached an even higher level of co-operation<br />
and understanding. We co-operated particularly closely in our<br />
opposition to nuclear tests in the Pacific.<br />
He achieved for New Zealand a position of genuine<br />
leadership in the south west Pacific. He did this not only by<br />
the nobility of his vision for his nation and the region but by<br />
the personal qualities of integrity, compassion and sturdy<br />
commonsense which earned him the confidence and affection of all<br />
who had the privilege of working with him.<br />
On behalf of all Australians I extend to our New<br />
Zealand partners our deepest sympathy in the grievous loss we<br />
have all suffered. </p>
