PRIME MINISTER<br />
SPEECH BY THE' PR'IME MINISTER<br />
NATIONAL SEMINAR OF THE INSTITUTE OF MUNICIPAL M'ANAGEMENT<br />
CANBERRA 9-MAY 1984<br />
It gives me considerable pleasure to be with you on this<br />
occasion the 8th Biennial National Local Government<br />
Seminar conducted by the Institute. of Municipal Management.<br />
The Government has a strong commitment to raising the status<br />
and strengthening the capacity of Local Government. Our aim<br />
is a genuine partnership of the Commonwealth, States and<br />
Local Government.<br />
In this we see the Institute of Municipal Management as<br />
having a most. important role to play. Established nearly<br />
fifty years ago the Institute is committed to improving the<br />
quality of performance of those serving Local Government<br />
throughout Australia.<br />
With very good reason the Institute takes pride in its<br />
achievements. It has contributed significantly to Local<br />
Government's ability to deal effectively with the<br />
increasingly complex tasks our communities now expect our<br />
Councils to perform.<br />
My Government established the first Ministry for Local<br />
Government last year and appointed one of its most<br />
experienced Ministers to lead it. That represented an<br />
historic step forward for Local Government.<br />
With the States we aim to secure recognition for Local<br />
Government as an essential part of the Australian federal<br />
system. During the past year, this Government has embarked on a<br />
number of programs aimed at understanding better the needs<br />
of Local Government, and at securing better co-ordination of<br />
Commonwealth activities of interest to Local Government. </p>
<p>As Tom Uren, has said<br />
" We aim to strengthen the capacity of Local<br />
Government to deal efficiently and equitably with<br />
the concerns of people where they live; and we are<br />
seeking to do that in ways which achieve a<br />
sustainable shift in the status and functioning of<br />
Local Government".<br />
Local Government is at once a significant employer, provider<br />
of facilities, services and infrastructure, and consumer of<br />
goods and services. Our Local Government network is a<br />
significant element of the social fabric of our nation, and<br />
serves as a major catalyst in developing community resources<br />
and capacities.<br />
For these reasons, as the Institute itself has no. ted:<br />
" It is more essential than ever that Local<br />
Government administration should be broad in its<br />
outlook, knowledgeable in application, effective,<br />
efficient and economical in performance, and of<br />
high integrity at all times"<br />
It is for Local Governments to demonstrate these qualities.<br />
To the extent they do, we can be confident that the skills<br />
and resources of our local communities will be brought into<br />
full play. It is with this objective in mind that the<br />
Federal Government will be working for a durable<br />
strengthening of Local Government capacity.<br />
We want Local Government as a genuine partner in our three<br />
sphere system of government, co-operating in a broad range<br />
of functions to build a vigorous Australian community and<br />
economy from the grass roots up.<br />
This will be a quite radical change from the past. But over<br />
the last 12 months we have made some important beginnings in<br />
securing this shift in inter-governmental relations.<br />
The representation of the Australian Council of Local<br />
Government Associations at the National Economic Summit<br />
Conference, and the membership of that Association on the<br />
Economic Planning Advisory Council, have recognised the<br />
contribution Local Government can make to the national<br />
economic policy consultative and advisory process.<br />
The voice of Local Government is now being heard. It is now<br />
recognised that Local Government has a contribution to make<br />
to the development of national policies. We seek we need<br />
its co-operation in the great tasks of community<br />
development and economic reconstruction. </p>
<p>Local Government's closeness to community groups and small<br />
enterprises make it well placed to support and understand<br />
them, and to draw them into the broader processes.<br />
Another major step has been the formation of a sub-committee<br />
of the Australian Constitutional Convention to work on a<br />
co-operative approach to the constitutional recognition of<br />
Local Government. This provides a valuable opportunity for'<br />
a reappraisal of the place of Local Government in the'<br />
Australian governmental system.<br />
In relation to this matter, Mr Uren has commented more<br />
specifically: " We need" he has said, " to break beyond the narrow<br />
legacy of a restricted concept of Local 4<br />
Government's role in Australia and look to the<br />
broad range of functions administered elsewhere,<br />
with due regard to the national and state<br />
responsibilities in the Australian federal system".<br />
The establishing of a National Inquiry into Local Government<br />
Tax Sharing Arrangements is another important initiative.<br />
It provides a unique opportunity for an historic reappraisal<br />
of Local Government functions and resources.<br />
This Inquiry should lay the foundations for a more stable,<br />
efficient and equitable system of resourcing Local<br />
Government's expanding functions. The proposed terms of<br />
reference of the Inquiry reflect this objective. As<br />
suggested by the Commonwealth, the Inquiry would review the<br />
Local Government tax sharing arrangements and report on any<br />
changes required to improve the operation of the Local<br />
Government ( Personal Income Tax Sharing) Act 1976, with<br />
reference to:<br />
The respective roles of the Commonwealth and the States<br />
in regard to Local Government;<br />
The purpose and functions of Local Government revenue<br />
sharing; and<br />
The level and form of funding for Local Government<br />
available from Commonwealth, State and Local Government<br />
sources and the principles which should determine the<br />
level and allocation of the Local Government revenue<br />
sharing funds between and within states.<br />
Given the importance of this Inquiry, I should hope we shall<br />
soon have the concurrence of all States in these proposed<br />
terms of reference. I am pleased that most States have<br />
already signalled their support. </p>
<p>Another useful input to consideration of the future role of<br />
Local Government in Australia will be the report of the<br />
Advisory Council on Inter-Government Relations on Local<br />
Government's Responsibilities and Resources.<br />
This Report, taken together with the work of the<br />
Sub-Committee of the Australian Constitutional Convention<br />
and of the National Inquiry into Local Government Tax<br />
Sharing Arrangements, will provide the best basis there has<br />
ever been for a vigorous, well informed community discussion<br />
about the problems and possibilities of Local Government.<br />
Out of such discussion I should expect to see emerge<br />
constructive proposals for future reform in the character,<br />
role and responsibility of Local Government in Australia.<br />
For all those interested in good Government in ' Australia,<br />
the prospect is an exciting one.<br />
There are, however, steps we can take immediately to help<br />
Local Government to extend its functions and further develop<br />
its capacities. The consideration now being given to a<br />
Regional Community Development Program is a case in point.<br />
Two pilot programs for regional community development in<br />
association with the local councils of Western Sydney and<br />
Western/ North Western Melbourne regions have been begun<br />
through a budget allocation of $ 1.5 million.<br />
The programs are being undertaken in co-operation with the<br />
New South Wales and Victorian Governments. As you would all<br />
be aware, the regions singled out for the pilot program have<br />
serious deficiencies in social and community facilities and<br />
services, have large concentrations of low income earners,<br />
and have high levels of unemployment and rapid population<br />
growth. Importantly the Councils of the target areas despite<br />
strained resources seem willing to work together in<br />
tackling the longer-term problems of their regions'<br />
development. If successful, the pilot ventures should help improve those<br />
Councils capacities to participate in the advancement of<br />
their regions. They could also assist local councils in<br />
planning and budgeting for required activities, and help<br />
them make more efficient and equitable the programs of the<br />
State and Commonwealth Governments which affect their<br />
regions. What is being sought through the pilot projects is the<br />
development of effective co-operative processes. </p>
<p>While there have been hitches along the way, the projects,<br />
if they can be made to work, should stimulate innovative<br />
activity in terms of Local Government's role in housing,<br />
economic enterprises and recreation facilities, as well as<br />
providing a catalyst to essential research and information<br />
activities by Local Governments.<br />
If innovative approaches of this kind are to succeed we<br />
cannot afford to ignore the most immediate needs of our<br />
Local Government system. High among those needs must be<br />
that for a better flow of local area information a key<br />
resource for planning, managing and evaluating programs and<br />
policies. Such information is crucially important as a ca, talyst to<br />
effective processes of inter-governmental co-operation. it,<br />
is, therefore, appropriate that the Department of<br />
Territories and Local Government has given particular<br />
priority to working with other departments and agencies at<br />
the Federal level, and with the various State and Local<br />
Government bodies, for the purpose of securing a more<br />
regular and reliable provision of local area information.<br />
It will be to the advantage of all areas of government to<br />
secure the maximum possible progress and co-operation in the<br />
provision of such data.<br />
Good government will often hinge on the availability of<br />
timely and accurate information. In the three tier system<br />
of government such as we know in Australia, the effective<br />
channeling of information between the various levels of<br />
government can be of quite considerable importance.<br />
As well, Local Government will only be able to participate<br />
fully as a genuine partner in the nation's system of<br />
government, if it is fully aware of actions by the Federal<br />
Government affecting its particular sphere of interest.<br />
The Department of Territories and Local Government has,<br />
therefore, prepared and disseminated to all councils a<br />
resume of the 1983/ 84 Budget's impact on Local Government.<br />
Its release of the guide to " Commonwealth Government<br />
Assistance for Local Projects" and the updating of the<br />
" Digest of Local Government Statistics" should also prove<br />
invaluable tools to many local councils.<br />
This type of co-ordination in the provision of information<br />
should become an ongoing part on the Commonwealth's<br />
responsibility in its relationship with L. ocal Government.<br />
Education and training is another important area in which<br />
the Federal Government can provide assistance to Local<br />
Government. Increased Federal assistance is being provided<br />
through industry training councils, and through expanded<br />
support for senior management training. The Federal<br />
Government is also looking at developing a broader system of<br />
staff exchange between the Commonwealth and Local Government<br />
and the States. </p>
<p>Of particular interest to the Institute will be the fact<br />
that this year the Government also increased the Local<br />
Government Scholarship Scheme to provide assistance to<br />
council officers and elected members to participate in<br />
employment development and training programs run by the<br />
Australian Centre for Local Government Studies at the<br />
Canberra College of Advanced Education.<br />
In this regard I think it important that we all acknowledge<br />
the instrumental role played by the Institute in the<br />
establishment of an educational program designed to further<br />
the professional capacity and performance of local<br />
government administrators and their staffs.<br />
It was at your Institute's instigation that theCanberra<br />
College of Advanced Education established the Australian<br />
Centre of Local Government Studies in 1973. The Centre nowo<br />
conducts courses in senior management that have attracted<br />
participants not only from around Australia but also from<br />
overseas. Other courses are held in conjunction with<br />
Colleges of Advanced Education in the States.<br />
The role of the Institute in raising qualification<br />
standards, in the dissemination of information and in the<br />
conduct of conferences, seminars, and training courses has<br />
provided a particularly useful contribution to the labour<br />
force development needs of Local Government.<br />
The pressure for enhanced capacity at the Local Government<br />
level is certain to increase. It is not only that there is<br />
a need for all spheres of Government to co-operate in a<br />
national program of economic reconstruction if we are to<br />
sustain and diversify the recovery that is now under way.<br />
It is also that there is increasing recognition that Local<br />
Government should be directly involved in major programs of<br />
national interest.<br />
The Community Employment Program is a case in point. it<br />
offers the opportunity for a very significant role for Local<br />
Government. Through it Local Government can move beyond a<br />
simple agency function towards a more active involvement in<br />
the development of employment opportunities and expanded<br />
employment and economic promotion activities.<br />
The challenge to Local Government is to ensu-re that it is<br />
adequately equipped to participate effectively in such<br />
programs. The Federal Government will do what it can to<br />
assist, but ultimately the reponsibility lies with Local<br />
Government itself to take necessary action.<br />
Like government at the National and State levels, Local<br />
Government in Australia ha-s become significantly more<br />
complex and significantly more involved in a whole range of<br />
community issues associated with the provision of services. </p>
<p>The task before Local Government is one of becoming more<br />
responsive to community perceptions and needs, developing<br />
effective means of meeting new tasks and handling old ones<br />
more satisfactorily, and of planning to create the best<br />
possible environment for its citizens now and into the<br />
future, including by preserving the best aspects of the<br />
past. At the core of this lies the need for modern, effective<br />
management. This is what your seminar with its theme<br />
" Municipal Management Methods" is about. Your Institute's<br />
new title also recognises the centrality of this aspect.<br />
Through new insights and shared experience I should expect<br />
you will all emerge from this Seminar better equipped to<br />
deal effectively with the various, complex and diverse<br />
interests of your communities.<br />
It is important that you should; our program of building a<br />
better Australia in partnership with our communities will in<br />
large measure depend on it. </p>
