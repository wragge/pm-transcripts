FOR PRESS JUNE 10, 1976<br />
JUNE PREMIERS' CONFERENCE<br />
The tax sharing arrangements settled today represent<br />
perhaps the most important advance in financial relations<br />
between Governments. in Australia since Federation.<br />
A completely new approach in financial relations between<br />
the Commonwealth, the States and Local Government has been<br />
set.<br />
The key factor in the revenue sharing arrangements is<br />
that the States and Local Government will receive their<br />
financial entitlements automatically. Major elements in<br />
their finances should no longer be subject to haggling.<br />
The revenue sharing arrangements implemented today are the<br />
foundation for the future development of Federalism, including<br />
. the basic issue of defining clearer and more efficient roles<br />
and responsibilities for all three spheres of Government.<br />
Under the new ta-sharing arrangements States will receive<br />
much more in the current. financial year as untied general<br />
revenue assistaze than they would have under the Whitlam<br />
formula. This a result the States have been seeking<br />
for years.<br />
As set out in more detail below the increase in 1976-77<br />
in funds to be available to the States and their authorities<br />
as tax sharing. en-itlements, local government assistance,<br />
Loan Counc-i. 1-programs and welfare housing advances is<br />
estimated at 16.4 per cent.<br />
Tax Sharin<br />
The meeting had before-it a comr~ h -orctersdecided<br />
in relation to the tax sharing scheme following<br />
discussion at the February and April Premiers' Conferences.<br />
This list is reproduced as Attachment A. It covers the<br />
essential features of the tax sharing scheme.<br />
At today's meeting there was further discussion on some<br />
outstanding subsidiary aspects. A summary of the additional<br />
points agreed at today's meeting is set out in Attachment B.<br />
Arrangements for Stage 1 of the tax sharing scheme have now<br />
been largely settled, and that Stage will commence in 1976-77.<br />
Legislation to implement these arrangements, which will<br />
replace the existing States Grants Act, will be introduced<br />
as early as possible in the Budget session of Parliament. / 2 </p>
<p>The Prime Minister paid tribute to the co-operative spirit in<br />
which the States had discussed the new scheme over the period<br />
beginning with the February Conference and to the detailed<br />
work which had been carried out jointly by the Commonwealth<br />
and State Treasury officers.<br />
Present estimates which it is emphasised are very preliminary<br />
put the States' tax sharing entitlement for 1976-77 at<br />
$ 3,711 million and increase of no less than $ 638 million or<br />
20.8 Per cent compared with the level of the financial<br />
assistance grants in 1975-76. The State by State figures are<br />
set out in Attachment C.<br />
On present estimates this-is $ 55 million more than the present<br />
forumla-would have yielded-a forumla which is, the Prime<br />
Minister noted, itself by no means-. an ungenerous one, particularly<br />
given the-provision in it for an increase in the " betterment"<br />
factor to 3 per cent from 1 July next. Particulars on a State<br />
by State basis of the estimated entitlements and of the estimated<br />
amounts that would have been yielded under the financial assistance<br />
grants formula are given in Attachment D.<br />
The Prime Minister said that, to avoid any possible misunderstanding,<br />
it should be made quite clear that the figures quoted are no more<br />
than present estimates. Nevertheless, it is a fair conclusion<br />
to say that the new tax sharing scheme will, on present estimates<br />
result, from the States' point of view, in an improvement on an<br />
* already favourable situation.<br />
The Prime Minister notei that work on Stage 2 of the tax sharing<br />
scheme is continuing a officer level. The firm target is to have<br />
legislative and other necessary arrangements made so that the States<br />
will be able, if they to apply personal income tax surcharges<br />
or rebates in their S-ces from the beginning of 1977-78. </p>
<p>I 3.<br />
STATE GOVERNMENT LOAN COUNCIL PROGRAMS FOR 1976-77<br />
The Loan Council approved a total State Government Loan Council<br />
program for 1976-77 of $ 1,356 million. This represents an<br />
increase of 5.0 per cent over the 1975-76 program. Of this<br />
total, one third will be provided to the States by way of interest<br />
free, non repayable capital grants. The capital grants will thus total<br />
$ 452 million and borrowings for the States will total $ 904 million.<br />
Further details are set out in Attachments E and F.<br />
SBORROWING PROGRAMS FOR " LARGER" STATE AUTHORITIES IN 1976-77<br />
For the States' " larger" authorities ( those borrowing individually<br />
more than $ 800,000 in a year) the Loan Council approved a total<br />
program of $ 960 million, which represents an increase of $ 150.3 million,<br />
* or 18.6 per cent over* the-1975-76 programs.<br />
Details-are set out in Attachment G.<br />
." SMALLER" AUTHORITIES'BORROWINGS<br />
The Loan Council has fr sc: e years placed no overall limit on<br />
the borrowings by " saller" State authorities ( those whose borrowings<br />
individually do not exeed $ 800,000 in a year increased from the<br />
figure of $ 700,00C0 1975-76). The Loan Council agreed that this<br />
arrangement should be :: ncinued in 1976-77.<br />
ADVANCES FOR WELFARE :-i-SITNG<br />
SThe Commonwealth E-vwialnlc e a total of $ 375 million to the States<br />
in 1976-77 under -e Housing Agreement. Any State would be free<br />
Sto supplement these amounts by providing additional funds for<br />
housing from genera i-purpose capital funds available to it as<br />
Loan Council programs.<br />
The State by State distribution of the figure of $ 375 million is<br />
shown in Attachment H.<br />

PERSONAL INCOME TA\ X SHARING ISSUES DECIDED<br />
FOLLOWING THE FEBRUARY AND APRIL 1976 PREMIERS' CONFERENCES<br />
The scheme will be related to personal income taxnot<br />
company tax and not including withholding taxes<br />
on interest and dividends.<br />
The scheme will be introduced in two Stages.<br />
Stage 1 Stage 1 will be introduced as from the beginning of'<br />
1976/ 77.<br />
The-States' entitlements under Stage 1 will represent<br />
a specified percentage of Commonwealth imposed<br />
personal income tax and State legislation will thus<br />
not be required in regard to Stage 1.<br />
The " base" to which the percentage will be applied<br />
each year will be personal income tax collected in<br />
the year. The percentage figure will be determined<br />
by reference to the relationship between the financial<br />
assistance grants in 1975-76 and personal income<br />
tax collections in that year.<br />
Personal income tax collections in the Territories<br />
will be included in the base figure but with this<br />
subject to review in the light of developments in<br />
public finances in the Territories.<br />
The yield or costs of special surcharges or rebates<br />
applied, in appropriate circumstances, by the<br />
Commonwealth will not be included in the base figure<br />
from which the States' entitlements will be calculated.<br />
In regard to the possible effects on the Statest Stage<br />
1 entitlements of changes by the Commonwealth in its<br />
personal income tax legislation, the Commonwealth<br />
Government has given a firm assurance to the States<br />
that:-it will ensure that the States are fully informed<br />
of relevant tax changes made by the Commonwealth<br />
and of their estimated effects on the States<br />
entitlements; it will participate in a review of the arrangemnents<br />
when there are changes in Commonwealth tax<br />
legislation which have effects on the States'<br />
entitlements of such significance as to warrant<br />
such a review; and </p>
<p>longer-terra trends in regard to such matters<br />
as changes in the relative importance of<br />
personal income tax vis-a--vis other taxes<br />
will be kept under notice between the<br />
Commonwealth and State Governments.<br />
However, it is agreed that it would not be practicable<br />
to devise in advance an automatic formula for defining<br />
how changes in Commonwealth tax laws should be<br />
reflected in the Stage 1 arrangements.<br />
There will be a " guarantee" arrangement to ensure<br />
that the States' Stage 1 entitlements in any year<br />
are not less, in absolute terms, than in the previous<br />
year. This arrangement will be supplemented in the<br />
first three years of the new scheme 1976-77,<br />
1977-78 and 1978-79) by a further undertaking that<br />
the entitlements will not be less in a year than the<br />
amount which would have been yielded in that year<br />
by the financial assistance grants formula as laid<br />
down in the States Grants Act 1973-75.<br />
( 11) A total entitlement for all States will first be<br />
determined, to be then divided between the States.<br />
( 12) The initial per capita relativities between the<br />
States in their Stage 1 entitlements will be the<br />
relativities in the financial assistance grants<br />
in 1975-76.<br />
( 13) Subject to ( 17) below, and to any absorption of<br />
specific purpose payments, these relativities will<br />
be carried for-ward into subsequent years in such<br />
a way as to maintain the proportionate relationships 0<br />
between the per capita entitlements of the States.<br />
( 14) The four less populous States will continue to be<br />
free to apply for grants on the recommendation of<br />
the Grants Commission in addition to their basic<br />
entitlements as yielded under the arrangements summarised<br />
above.<br />
The matter of the relationship between the special grant<br />
which Queensland is at present receiving on the<br />
recommendation of the Grants Commission and the tax<br />
sharing arrangements is regarded as essentially one<br />
between the Commonwealth and Queensland Governments<br />
and will be considered by those Governments as<br />
necessary*<br />
( 16) The States will be paid their Stage 1 entitlements on<br />
a monthly pro-rata basis, with adjustments during the<br />
financial year as necessary as estimates of personal<br />
income tax collections in the year are varied ( this<br />
is similar to z: ie arrangements under which the<br />
financial ass2._=.; zance grants are paid).<br />
( 17) There will be a :,-_! iodic review of relativities between<br />
all States. </p>
<p>( 18) There will be full and precise documentation to<br />
record the understandings between Governments in<br />
relation to Stage 1 but this will not take the form<br />
of a formal Agreement.<br />
Stage 2<br />
( 19) Under Stage 2 each State will be able to legislate<br />
to impose a surcharge on personal income tax in the<br />
State, ( but not company taxation or withholding tax<br />
on dividends and interest) additional to that<br />
imposed by the Commonwealth, or to give ( at cost<br />
to the State) a rebate on personal income tax<br />
payable under Commonwealth law and to authorise<br />
the Commonwealth to collect the surcharge or grant<br />
rebate a~ s its agent.<br />
Any State surcharges or rebates will be expressed<br />
in percentage terms.<br />
( 21) Assessment provisions, and the basic income tax<br />
rate structure, will continue to be uniform<br />
throughout Australia, these being matters for the<br />
Commonwealth to determine.<br />
( 22) The Commonwealth will at all times remain the sole<br />
collecting and administrative agency in the income<br />
tax field.<br />
( 23) The level of any State surcharges or rebates will<br />
be a matter for consideration by each State; relevant<br />
decisions will be taken within an appropriate<br />
framework of consultation with the Commonwealth and<br />
other States, but ultimately the level of surcharge<br />
or rebate will be a decision for each individual<br />
State. In exercising these powers the States will<br />
accept responsibility to work in parallel with and<br />
not in negation of the overall economic management<br />
policies of the Commonwealth.<br />
( 24) Equalisation arrangements will be made so that less<br />
populous States will be enabled to obtain the same<br />
relative advantage from a surcharge as the States<br />
with a broader tax base.<br />
The Grants Commission will be responsible for<br />
assessing amounts payable under the arrangements<br />
referred to under ( 24).<br />
( 26) The basis . for assessment of equalisation assistance to<br />
the-less populous States in regard to the yield of<br />
State surcharges levied under Stage 2 ( see points ( 24)<br />
and ( 25) above) will be that supplementary assistance,<br />
will be provided to a less populous State levying a<br />
surcharge to bring the per capita yield from the<br />
surcharge up to the average per capita amount which </p>
<p>would be yielded if New South Wales and Victoria levied<br />
a surcharge on the same basis. The assessment will<br />
be independent of any examination of the overall<br />
financial position of the State concerned vis-a-vis<br />
other States.<br />
( 27) An officers' working party is to formulate detailed<br />
proposals to implement State 2. The firm target<br />
is to have an appropriate framework established,<br />
relevant matters agreed and necessary legislation<br />
prepared in time for Stage 2 to commence from the*<br />
beginning of 1977-78.<br />
( 28) At an appropriate time the Commonwealth will consider<br />
what implications Stage 2 might have in relation to<br />
the Territories.<br />
Local Government Assistance<br />
( 29) There will be a new scheme of local government<br />
assistance, beginning in 1976-77, under which such<br />
assistance, to be distributed through the States,<br />
will be related to the yield of Commonwealth personal<br />
income tax.<br />
In regard to assistance for local government, an<br />
amount of such assistance in 1976-77 having been<br />
determined by the Commonwealth Government having<br />
regard to its overall budget considerations, a<br />
percentage figure will be calculated by relating.<br />
this amount to personal income tax collections in<br />
1975-76. In 1977-78 and each subsequent year the<br />
amounts of assistance will be determined by applying<br />
that percentage to Commonwealth personal income tax<br />
collections in the previous year excluding the<br />
effects of any special surcharges or rebates. The<br />
percentage figure could be subject to any absorption<br />
of specific purpose payments.<br />
Implications for Tax Forms and Assessment Notices<br />
( 31) In relation to tax forms, changes will be minimal<br />
apart from necessary changes to take account of<br />
surcharges or rebates.<br />
( 32) Assessment notices will b e changed only to accommodate<br />
State surcharges or rebates ( any Commonwealth<br />
surcharge or rebate would, of course, also be shown),<br />
with information on disposition of Commonwealth tax<br />
to States. and local government provided to taxpayers<br />
separately but in conjunction with assessment notices.<br />
Review of Total Tax Sharing Arrangements<br />
( 33) There will be a review of' the ta x sharing arrangements<br />
as a whole pe= zicodically. The first review will be..<br />
made at some 7Lme before the end of 1980-81 with<br />
any revisions a~ plying as from the beginning of the<br />
next financial. -ea= after the review. </p>
<p>ATTACIDNT B<br />
TAX SHARING ADDITIONAL POINTS AGREED<br />
FOLLOWING DISCUSSION AT PREMIERS'<br />
CONFERENCE, JUNE 1976<br />
The Commonwealth Government undertakes that, when<br />
post-budget changes in personal income tax legislation<br />
with substantial effects on the States' entitlements<br />
are made, it will consider, in consultation with<br />
the States, appropriate adjustments in the<br />
arrangements to offset the effects on the States<br />
entitlements ii that particular financial year<br />
having regard to other relevant factors impinging<br />
on the States' budgetary positions. Any<br />
necessary consultations with the Stat'es on ths<br />
matter will be arranged at the earliest practicable<br />
stage. In relation to the review 6f the tax sharing<br />
arrangements as a whole which'will take place<br />
b. efore the end of 1980-8j. there will be arrangements<br />
made for the Commonwealth and State Governments to<br />
agree, well in advance of the review, on the<br />
procedures which are to be followed in connection<br />
with it. </p>
<p>-6-<br />
Advice in relation to the review-, of relati~ ities<br />
between the States in their Stage 1 entitlements will<br />
be sought from an independent review body; aspects of<br />
this matter are to be further considered between the<br />
Commonwealth and the States at a meeting to be arranged<br />
as soon as practical.<br />
Interest on future issues of Commonwealth securities will<br />
be subject to State income tax surcharges under Stage 2<br />
of the tax sharing scheme; this change will not apply<br />
retrospectively to interest on securities already issued.<br />
The precise timing of this change will be the subject of<br />
an announcement by the Treasurer~ at a later date.<br />
The arrangement under which the States will be guaranteed<br />
to receive not less than the amount yielded by the present<br />
grants formula ( see Item ( 10) in Attachment A) will be<br />
extended for a further year from 3 to 4 years i. e. to<br />
include -1979-80. ATTACM-ThENT C<br />
