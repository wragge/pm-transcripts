    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Prime Minister, Mr. Menzies, announced to-day thatÂ negotiations had been commenced in New York for the raisingÂ by the Commonwealth of a new $ 25 million Commonwealth loan.Â Mr. Menzies said that the Australian Loan Council had givenÂ its approval to these negotiations being commenced and thatÂ the proceeds of the loan would be applied towardsÂ Commonwealth and State 1960-61 borrowing programmes approvedÂ by the Loan Council.</p>
<p>If negotiations are successful, the new loan will beÂ issued in New York towards the end of the month. However,Â in accordance with United States legal requirements, aÂ Registration Statement relating to the proposed newÂ borrowing was filed with the Securities and ExchangeÂ Commission in Washington on Thursday, September 8.Â </p>
<p>Mr. Menzies said that this loan would be the firstÂ overseas raising by the Commonwealth for the presentÂ financial year. He added that two loans, each for $ 25 million,Â were raised in New York during 1959-60 and one, also for $25Â million, in 1958-59.</p>
