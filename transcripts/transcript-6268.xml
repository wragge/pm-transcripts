TRANSCRIPT OF TV INTERVIEWSPRIENTAL HOTEL, BANGKOK, 21 NOVEMBER 1983<br />
JOURNALIST: What happened, Prime Minister?<br />
PM: Well, we had a most useful discussion where we had, I believe,<br />
an identity of views and complete understanding, I believe, on<br />
the part of the Prime Minister and the Foreign Minister of<br />
Thailand about Australia's position.<br />
JOURNALIST: I was just going to say, what did General Prem<br />
say specifically about ASEAN?<br />
PM: Well, we indicated our basic agreement with the thrust<br />
oT the view of Thailand and ASEAN in regard to the position of<br />
Kampuchea and there was, as I say, an acceptance and understanding<br />
by General Prem and Foreign Minister Siddhi of the identity<br />
between us on the fundamental position. You will recall what I<br />
said before I left Australia, that I was quite relaxed about<br />
this issue, that I thought there had been an over-statement in<br />
some quarters and the extraordinarily cordial meeting that we've<br />
had with the Prime Minister and the Foreign Minister here has<br />
totally confirmed my expectations.<br />
JOURNALIST: Sir, was there any discussion whatsoever about some<br />
fomof peacekeeping mission, be it..<br />
PM: No, it did not arise. We are to have a working lunch with<br />
Foreign Minister Siddhi. It is conceivable that it may be<br />
raised there. It was not raised in the discussion this morning.<br />
JOURNALIST: Does this mean the row with ASEAN is all over?<br />
PM: Well, I have not taken the view that there is a row with<br />
AiSEAN, and I have certainly not taken the view that there has been<br />
row with Thailand. In my view, and that has been confirmed, I<br />
would feel confident, as I've said all along that the substantially<br />
sound relationship that exists between Australia and ASEAN will<br />
not only be confirmed, but will be strengthened. / 2<br />
US AL<br />
A T I
</p><p>JOURNALIST: Do you expect now that ASEAN will resume its<br />
dialogue with Australia?<br />
PM: I've had no doubt that the dialogue will be resumed.<br />
JOURNALIST: On the issue of Kampuchea, then Prime Minister,<br />
is it us agreeing to disagree but respecting our points of<br />
view? PM: It's not a question of agreeing to disagree. There is<br />
fundamental agreement about the major thrust. That is the<br />
necessity for the withdrawal of the Vietnamese forces, the<br />
creation of the condition where there can be an expression of<br />
the free will of the people of Kampuchea and the emergence out<br />
of that situation where you a re not going to have the<br />
possiblity of the imposition of the Po1 Pot forces, where<br />
Kampuchea can be an independent country and where you can have<br />
resettlement of the refugees from that country. Those are the<br />
elements upon which we basically agreed. In respect to our<br />
attitude towards the Po1 Pot element of the coalition group,<br />
there has been an understanding by the Prime Minister and the<br />
Foreign Minister of our view. INdeed, they share our repugnance<br />
of the Pol Pot forces.<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you get the impression that our ASEAN neighbours<br />
still -thintkh at we're bending over backwards to help Vietnam?<br />
PM: No, on the contrary. There was no suggestion of that from<br />
the Prime Minister or the Foreign Minister. No suggestion at<br />
all. There was a complete understanding of our attitude. I<br />
don't think that that sort Of vie! w is in fact a realistic<br />
representation of the understanding that exisits of Australia's<br />
basic commitment to the general thrust of the ASEAN countries<br />
view on Kampuchea.<br />
JOURNALIST: So do you think the attitude of the Thai Government<br />
reflects the attitude of ASEAN as a whole, or have you still<br />
got a fight on your hands with Mr. Lee Kuan Yew?<br />
PM: Oh, I don't think I've got a fight on my hands with Mr. Lee<br />
iRi-an Yew. I'm looking forward to meeting him in Delhi. I<br />
intend to have cordial and straightforward discussions with<br />
him. I would imagine that is his intention. I simply come<br />
back to the point that there has been an overblowing in some<br />
quarters of a difference in emphasis. I have been relaxed about<br />
this from the beginning. I remain relaxed totally about it.<br />
The fundamentally sound relations between Australia and ASEAN<br />
will, I repeat, not only be maintained, they will be strengthened<br />
under my Government.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, in light of the fact that you've<br />
signalled a degree of acceptance of the Malaysian initiative,<br />
some form of force to fill the vacuum of Vietnam after the<br />
Vietnamese go, certainly in light of the fact that Australia has<br />
a dialogue with Hanoi as many countries in the region don't,<br />
is there now a role for Australia as a mediator? / 3 </p>
<p>PM: I reject the phrase mediator, a ' s Mr. Hayden and I have<br />
1-om the beginning. We don't think that that is the right<br />
expression. NOw, going back to the first part of your<br />
question, that is about a Malaysian proposal, that is<br />
hypothetical. The first stages have got to be the dialogue<br />
which can produce the basic requirement. That is the<br />
withdrawal of the Vietnamese forces. That is what to<br />
concentrate on, trying to achieve that situation. Now, if<br />
we move from the hypothesis that is contained in the Malaysian<br />
proposal to the-position where there is going to be the<br />
withdrawal, then we can address ourselves to that. We will<br />
do that. It hasn't been raised in the discussions here so<br />
far. It may be later on with the Foreign Minister. There is<br />
no point in proceeding any further with that except to make<br />
it clear they did from the very beginning that we are not<br />
talking about Australian troops in any belligerent sense.<br />
The propcsition could conceivably be, if the preconditions were<br />
met of withdrawal, of some form of Australian involvement in<br />
helping to ensure the emergence of what is the end objective<br />
t at is the free expression of the will of the Kampuchean<br />
people. JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, over recent weeks you have gone<br />
out of your way to exercise the fact that you and Mr. Hyaden<br />
have been at one over this entire issue, does he also agree<br />
that it is a good idea to send a peacekeeping force to Cambodia?<br />
PM: Well, you're trying to get to Itp, o sition which doesn't<br />
exist. That is that the agreemer-z*-etween Mr. Hayden and myself<br />
of a hypothetical response to a hypothetical situation and you<br />
are not taking it any further thar that. What we are both<br />
committed to now is the immediate -ealities.. I mean, there has<br />
been an enormous tendency on the of you people with<br />
re: 6pect, to try and go down tracks which are just not there,<br />
are not realistic, and to talk about a possible hypothetical<br />
situation and then try and get involved in that. what we do<br />
is to deal with the current realities that is discussion with<br />
ASEAN about the immediate situation. That is what I have been<br />
engaged in with the Prime Minister of Thailand and his Foreign<br />
Minister. That is what we are going to continue to do while we<br />
are here. </p>
