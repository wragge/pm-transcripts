FOR MEaDrIcAh9 1985<br />
In my statement of 4 March on ANZUS, I indicated that the<br />
Government proposed in the present circumstances to pursue our<br />
important defence relationship with New Zealand on a bilateral<br />
basis reflecting both our traditions and the common need to<br />
respond to regional security requirements. Subsequently I have<br />
stressed the importance of consultations with both our ANZUS<br />
partners on the most realistic and constructive basis possible.<br />
Australia and New Zealand share important and well established<br />
interests in the maintenance of stability and peaceful development<br />
in the South Pacific and more widely.<br />
In accordance with this approach, Minister for Defence Kim Beazley<br />
will visit New Zealand from 31 March to 4 April for regular talks<br />
on defence co-operation with relevant New Zealand Ministers.<br />
Thereafter I have agreed with Prime Minister David Lange's request<br />
to meet me when he visits Canberra on 17 April. That will provide<br />
the opportunity for talks on a wide range of issues.<br />
These meetings will provide opportunities for -the Government to<br />
ensure that Australia's traditional defence relationships 3re<br />
fully protected for so long as arrangements with New Zealand under<br />
ANZIJS continue to be curtailed. 1<br />
