Prime Minister Julia Gillard today marked another step toward the establishment of a comprehensive cancer centre in the Central Coast of NSW with the pouring of concrete for one of three radiation oncology bunkers at the new Central Coast Regional Cancer Service.</p>
<p>The Gillard Government has committed $28.59 million to the project along with a $10 million contribution from the NSW Government.</p>
<p>The regional cancer centre will include a comprehensive radiation therapy and associated cancer service facility at Gosford, and a satellite multidisciplinary clinic and day oncology unit at Wyong Hospital to provide the full spectrum of cancer services including prevention and screening, treatment palliative and support care for local people.</p>
<p>Construction began on the Cancer Centre in July 2011 and the project is expected to be complete by March 2013.</p>
<p>The Government has allocated $670 million to projects to help close the gap in outcomes for patients in regional areas and are in the process of constructing 24 Regional Cancer Centres.</p>
<p>Eighteen of the projects are now under construction have early works underway or are in the design phase.</p>
<p>Labor's health reforms are also providing more health services closer to home, with more than 60 GP Super Clinics, including the Southern Central Coast GP Super Clinic in Robertson, more than 400 primary health care infrastructure grants, 4,600 practice nurses, and telehealth consultations.</p>
<p>The Gillard Government is delivering better health outcomes for Australians who live in rural and regional Australia  -  better access to services, infrastructure and more health professionals on the ground. </p>
