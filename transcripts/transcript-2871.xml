PRESS STATEMENT No. 66<br />
27 March, 1973<br />
THE PRIME MINISTER'S VISIT TO LONDON<br />
The Prime Minister announced today details of a<br />
forthcoming visit to London.<br />
He said that it had been a matter of priority in his<br />
mind that he should make a visit to London as soon as<br />
reasonably possible. Its purposes would be, as Prime Minister,<br />
to meet the Prime Minister of Britain, Mr Heath, and also very<br />
importantly, as Prime Minister, to call on the Queen.<br />
For both purposes he felt that he should make the visit<br />
to London before August that is before the Prime Minister's<br />
Conference in Ottawa, especially as Her Majesty also will be<br />
present in Ottawa at that time.<br />
The Parliamentary break at Easter presented a suitable<br />
opportunity. The Prime Minister said he had beer! in touch with the<br />
Australian High Commissioner in London, who was able to tell<br />
him that a visit at that time would be suitable and in addition<br />
Her Majesty would wish Mrs. Whitlam and him to stay with her<br />
at Windsor on the night of Friday,<br />
It happens that Saturday, 21st, is the Queen's birthday.<br />
The Prime Minister is already committed to be in Apia<br />
for the South Pacific Forum just prior to Easter. He will<br />
need to leave Apia on Wednesday, 18 April, which is the day<br />
befo're the conference ends. This has been explained to the<br />
Prime Minister of Western Samoa and other Heads of Government<br />
and Senator Willesee will take over from the Prime Minister<br />
on the final day.<br />
CANBERRA, A. C. T. </p>
