SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER THE RT. HON. R. G.<br />
MENZIES$ UPON RECEIVING AN H6NORARY DOCTORATE<br />
OF LAWS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF ADELAIDE ON<br />
APRIL, 1961<br />
Mr. Chancellor and ladies and gentlemen:<br />
You have just been reminded that this is not the<br />
first occasion on which I have received what I must properly<br />
describe as an unearned increment. ( Laughter) Indeed I look<br />
back over some of those events with great pleasure, and with<br />
particular interest. Perhaps I might begin by telling you why<br />
it is so interesting to me, once more, to be in a position where<br />
I am receiving a singular compliment and to look back on some of<br />
these occasions that I have referred to.<br />
I remember in 1941 when Winston Churchill was<br />
Chancellor as perhaps he still is, of Bristol, and the Council<br />
thought fiZ to confer a Degree, or Degrees, upon Mr. John<br />
Winant the then American Ambassador to Great Britain, and<br />
myself. A few hours before thc ceremony Bristol was bombed and<br />
the ceremony which was to have t,. ken place in the Great Hall<br />
took place in the Senate Chamber, and the members of the<br />
Council and the Professorial Board arrived with their academic<br />
robes over battle dress. Thoy ware all smoke-stained the<br />
Hall was still blazing; and there were fires raging in the<br />
streets radiating out from the University. That was a most<br />
memorable, unforgettable occasion. Unforgettable, ais I know,<br />
to Sir Winston Churchill himself. Certainly to me. And<br />
memorable in this respect: that in the middle of all the<br />
destruction and the war was then in its very crisis with<br />
all its destruction the Universities and the University spirit,<br />
and the University radition wont on. That to me has always<br />
been a tremendously significant thing. It was, in a sort of<br />
graphic fashion, a proof of the indestructibility of the<br />
things that we all hope to stand for.<br />
Reference was made to Malta. How I ever came to be<br />
given a degree at the Royal University of Malta I don't know,<br />
But I was. And it was a very long full day of d~ riving around<br />
Malta, having the experience, previously and subsequently<br />
unknown to me, of being checored by people in the streets,<br />
( Laughter) When I began this journey somebody thrust into my<br />
hands not an elegant piece of English, but a long oath in<br />
Latin, at least 100 to 150 words. Well, of course, that would<br />
appal anybody. I have a certain native supply of impudence,<br />
but 150 words of a Latin prayer, this seemed to me to be a<br />
little hard. When I arrived I whispered eCagerly to the Vice-<br />
Chancellor Vice-Chancellors being, as you know, the fount of<br />
all knowledge en these matters " Old pronunciation? or new?"<br />
( Laughter) He gave mec the most superb piece of advice I have<br />
ever had. He said " lIt's all right; mumble it." ( Laughter)<br />
And I did. ( Laughler)<br />
Then Sir, you referred to the French Canaidian<br />
University in uobec Laval. 41ell that was something that I<br />
remember pretty vivid. ly because although you allow me to<br />
address you here in uihat passes for ihglish I felt very<br />
strongly that at Laval portion of my speech ought to be in<br />
French. From my point of view, it was. ( Laughter) I must say<br />
that was the most polite audience for at the end they all<br />
nodded to each other with appre ciation and you could hear them<br />
saying, " 1Mram, il essaie, il essaie". 9 0 there we are.<br />
The other occasion that I want to mention is that at<br />
Oxford the year before last I had the misfortune, as it turned<br />
out to be first in the list to go up for a Degree at the h1ands<br />
of Lord Halifax. The public orator was there, ready to give us </p>
<p>our Citations in impcn~ able latin modern pronunciation. But<br />
when we reached the Divinity Scho~ 2. and were being marshalled<br />
for the event, I was given a sheaf of paper which contained on<br />
one side Latin and on tho other side the Engl. ish, but of<br />
course I didn't have time to road it because I had to go off at<br />
once, you soe. The others all sat down and read carefully, in<br />
English, so that they could thereafter pretend to have<br />
followed the Latin. I didn't have this oppirtunity; I had to<br />
stand up first and listen to it. And I want to say that it is<br />
a remarkable tribute to the truth that the older you get the<br />
more you remember of your early days, that I practically<br />
understood it all. ( Laughter)<br />
Now, Sir, may I just turn to this University, this<br />
rermarkable place. It isn't the first time that I have spoken<br />
in this magnificent Hall but this magnificent Hall<br />
characterises what I want to say about the University of<br />
Adelaide. There was an itinerant book writer, some of you may<br />
remember, John Foster Fraser, who compiled that immortal<br />
phrase, " Adele'. ide for culture Melbourne for business Sydney<br />
for pleasure". Oddly enough there was something in il.<br />
Because when Sir Keith Murray was out here presiding ever the<br />
Universities Committee of Enquiry, had finished taking his<br />
team around Australia, and had almost completed his report I<br />
was having a long discussion with him about the problem.<br />
that time he told mie that in the true essence of what a<br />
University meant he thought that Adelaide was pre-emninent in<br />
Australia. Now that interested me enormously, because he<br />
didn't rmean that Adelaide had enormous buildings, surrounded by<br />
spacious grounds and gardens, vast sporting arenas and an area<br />
of land such as that which enriches the University of British<br />
Columbia. But I think I do know what he meant, and that was<br />
that this University almost uncomfortably placed as one might<br />
occasionally think, right in the heart of the cily, without the<br />
elbow room that one would like to see, has succece: 4ed in<br />
attracting the interest, the help, the enthusiasm of the most<br />
eminent people in this city, and in this State. There is not<br />
that kind of remoteness about the University which one<br />
occasionally sees in Australia " Well that's an academic<br />
place; nothing to do with us; letts go on with the business;<br />
let's get on with our profession; we've finished with all<br />
that." I don't observe that sort of thing in Ldelaide because<br />
year after year I have seen men of the greatest distinction in<br />
the life of this city serving actively in the University,<br />
maintaining what is needed for a Univarsity -an outlook by the<br />
University on the world, and inlook by the world into the<br />
University. You have only to see here my tuo old friends the<br />
Chancellor and the Deputy Chancellor, to realise that In this<br />
city, in this State, men have not forgotten this place when<br />
they have gone out from But they have come back to it,<br />
and worked for it.<br />
Now, Sir, you have been reminded that I have had some<br />
small part to play in the furnishing of funds for the<br />
Universities. The State Governmients have aided on the great<br />
scale, but my own Government has, progressively, entered into<br />
this field and I think very properly so. I am sure when may<br />
sponsor, my learned sponsor, threw out that slight but<br />
delicate hint of favours to come ( Laughter) I'm sure that he<br />
was right. Because when Sir Keith Murray's Committee brought<br />
in a report, we having beon in the habit, at that time, for a<br />
few years of spending about f-lm. a year, or Å 34p. a year by </p>
<p>3.<br />
way of subvention to tho Universities, found ourselves with a<br />
recommendation that amounted to about Å 2lra. over a period of<br />
three years. If it hadn't boon for a certain aim-ount of rather<br />
devious conduct on my part I don't know whether it would have<br />
been approved. I won't go into the devious riethods, but anyhow<br />
Treasury approved and that is a great milestone in the<br />
history, not only of the Universities, but perhaps other people.<br />
Then we appointed a Commission under Sir Leslie<br />
Martin. And they brought in their report, not long ago. Å 21<br />
million in a trienniura, that shocked us. This time it was E+<br />
million for the three years! What it will be in the third<br />
three years I wouldn't know. But I will be quite safe to<br />
consider that it will vastly exceed any figure that we now have<br />
in mind. It is a groat pity in Australia that Universities<br />
should have become so remarkably dependent on Governments on<br />
the decisions of those in politics, on thei particular outlook<br />
on Universities their status, their freedom, their future,<br />
which may be possessed by some current political uind. I would<br />
like to feel that in Australia, as in the United States of<br />
America more and more will we find people who have wealth to<br />
dispose of looking to help the Universities. Having so said,<br />
and before I conclude, I would like to-offer a few perhaps<br />
platitudinous remarks about why I believe so deeply myself in<br />
the University structure. tJhat does it stand for? What must<br />
it aim at? It is a trite observation that it exists for mere<br />
than the training of people for professions; although so bs<br />
it that it does its job it will train them not only in learning<br />
but in character and in wisdom.<br />
The first thing that is needed and this is gZoing to<br />
be no easier as the years go on is to preserve the highest<br />
standards in objective study and enquiry, the highest standards.<br />
This vast pressing undergraduate population which we can see<br />
coming alongl over the next 10 years, over the next 20, is going<br />
to put the most enormous strain on Universities, not merely on<br />
their buildings, not merely on their breathing space, but on<br />
their capacity to teach to lead, to guide, so that the<br />
standards rise all the lime. I hope, Sir, that in the course of<br />
those processes, and particularly under the pressure of miodern<br />
events we will not neglect " useless learning", as it has been<br />
called, useless learning. which has contributed so mch to<br />
civilisation, to tolerance, which is the same thing, and<br />
furnishes the minds of'men and women for hours and days of<br />
great importance to them aond to others.<br />
I an always prepared to make a plea for what is now<br />
called " useless lozning" l. Not, of course, that we are to<br />
neglect the tremendous impact of science on the world and the<br />
clamant demand upon Universities to produce people of science.<br />
These two things are not irrencoDncilable. The great danger<br />
would arise if we preferred one to the other so exclusively<br />
that we failed to strike that balance of the min-d, and that<br />
balance of interest, that balance ofcontribution by a<br />
University which the world so much needs.<br />
Finally I would like to say this: to those who are<br />
the academic people of this audience it is a 3reat pity that<br />
the word " academic" should have acquired a sor., ewhat contemptucus<br />
connotation, " Oh he has an academic mind; lie lives an<br />
academic life; these academics, yo) u know they are not strong,<br />
practical, sensible follows like us". We have all heard this<br />
kind of thing said. The truth is that without these who devote<br />
their lives to academaic work this would be a pretty sorry place. </p>
<p>They perform an enorrous service not only for the University<br />
but for the cormiunity. They incur two dangers. If I state them<br />
I will leave it there.<br />
One is of becoming so completely absorbed in their<br />
own discipline, in those fascinating matters of the r: Lnd which<br />
we have all experienced who have been students, thcse 1: i tters<br />
which comnand the whole of a man's intellectual onthusiasm and<br />
interest, that they may be tempted to be rather coitm( rytuous of<br />
ordinary men and women outside. That would create a gulf of a<br />
dreadful kind. The second risk is that in order to avoid developing<br />
what I will call a somewhat academic contempt for unacademic<br />
people there may be a disposition to go to the other extreme<br />
and be too much influenced by tho opinion of people outside,<br />
too much afraid of what the politicians may do, of what the<br />
public may think. Never, never fall into the error of thinking<br />
badly of the public mind, because the public mind in this<br />
country is a good mind, and the public character is a good<br />
character. Never fall into the error of looking down on it.<br />
But in the name of academic freedom and study never be afraid<br />
of it, never be afraid of what the opinion may be outside.<br />
Here is this happy balance, I hope, that will continue<br />
a great tradition in a great University. Because I believe tha<br />
I would like to say Mr. Chancellor that I am profoundly honoured<br />
by this occasion. I regard it as no formality. I have<br />
received a singular honour from a great University; and I am<br />
happy to think t7iat I have received it, physically, from the<br />
hands of an old friend. </p>
