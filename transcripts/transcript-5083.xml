EMBARGO: AGAINST DELIVERY<br />
CHECK AGINST DELIVERY<br />
FOR MEDIA 27 JUNE 197.9"<br />
OPENING OF YAVNEH A. S. LEIBLER<br />
SECONDARY COLLEGE, MELBOURNE<br />
Thank you for giving me the opportunity of sharing with<br />
you today the opening and dedication of your new colleage.<br />
It's interesting that today also marks the birthday of a<br />
great Australian who was also a member of the-Australian<br />
Jcwish co-mmunity. I'm speaking of course, of the : Late<br />
General Sir John Monash, a person whose achievements are<br />
legendary and none more so than his academic successes.<br />
Surely, no better day could have been chosen to open the<br />
" Yavnch A. S. Leibler Secondary College", a school which<br />
will build on the academic excellence of the Yavneh<br />
Primary School.<br />
The opening of this college is a milestone in the life of<br />
the Jewish community of Melbourne. This college is not simply an<br />
educational institution designed to give students the skills<br />
to pass examinations but rather it is a further vital link<br />
in a tradition of. scho]. arship and learning which stretches<br />
back almost two thousand years, back to the ancient city<br />
of Yavneh in Israel.<br />
Yavneh flourished as a centre of Jewish life and study during<br />
the years 3830 to 3892 or, for the Gentile press, the<br />
years 70 to 132 A. D.<br />
The tradition set by those rabbis, scholars and great<br />
seminaries has travelled down the centuries, across continents<br />
and vast oceans, been tempered, like steel, by the holocaust<br />
and finally come to rest in establishments like Yavneh College.<br />
For the past 18 or so years, Yavneh College's Primary School<br />
has sought to impart traditional Jewish religious and cultural<br />
values to its pupils.<br />
Now the time has come to develop further, to enable those who<br />
commenced their primary schooling at Yavneh to continue their<br />
education uninterrupted and to proffer the traditional<br />
Jewish values to others who are now at the secondary level. / 2 N </p>
<p>2<br />
Yavneh prides itself on its high level of biblical<br />
and other Jewish learning and I've no doubt that the<br />
Col;. ce will continue to atLrac students mainly from<br />
Jewish families. However, the school will be open to all<br />
irrespective of race, colour, nationality or religion.<br />
The school will offer an unparalleled opportunity for<br />
students to observe and absorb the rich tapestry of<br />
Jewish history, a tapestry embroidered with the joy, blood<br />
and tears of countless millions.<br />
Lest it be thought that students at Yavneh are constantly<br />
immersed in dusty manuscripts and books, I'm pleased to hear<br />
Yavneh has a full sporting programme. Last year for example,<br />
Yavneh's football team defeated Grimwade House, the junior<br />
school of my old school Melbourne-Grammar.<br />
Being present at a school function like this takes me back to<br />
my own school days and youth. Many things have changed since<br />
then. There have been enormous leaps in technology over<br />
the past 30-40 years. Developments, which in my youth, were<br />
in the realm of science fiction are now commonplace.<br />
The world of radio valves and adding machines has yielded to<br />
the world of the printed circuit and computer. Now the<br />
silicone chip is revolutionising the electronics industry.<br />
The pace of life is much faster. When I first entered<br />
Parliament about 25 years ago Sir Robert Menzies was<br />
Prime Minister. He used to visit the United Kingdom about<br />
once a year, travelling by ship and taking a leisurely three<br />
to four weeks. Nobody saw that as being anything unusual.<br />
Nowadays, travellers jet around at ever-increasing speed<br />
trying to fit in as much as possible in as short a time<br />
as possible.<br />
It may be that in our eagerness to achieve more we, in fact,<br />
achieve less. This paradox is most clearly seen in education.<br />
Twenty to thirty years ago it was popular to believe that<br />
large institutions offered economies of scale that benefitted<br />
their students. However, it was found that the large<br />
institutions became impersonal bureaucracies the teachers<br />
divorced from their students; the students resentful of<br />
their teachers.<br />
Nowadays, there is a strong body of opinion which believes that<br />
education has its greatest successes in a small school. I'm<br />
pleased to see that Yavneh intends to keep itself relatively<br />
small, maintaining its happy, family-type environment which<br />
in turn must benefit its students. / 3 </p>
<p>3<br />
When all is said and done the true test of a school is the<br />
calibre of person it sends out into the world. I know that<br />
Yavneh with its blending of traditional values with the<br />
J. iest educatlional develop'.' Ients will produce students th; at<br />
will be a credit to the school, to the Jewish community<br />
and to the Australian community as a whole.<br />
Institutions such as Yavneh have been and will continue to<br />
be of fundamental importance to the richness and diversity<br />
of our national life. It cannot be stressed too often that<br />
Australian society is not weakened but strengthened<br />
by diversity, that preservation of a cultural heritage can<br />
be an integral part of participation in Australian life*<br />
and love for our country.<br />
This Government believes in diversity in education in the<br />
right of parents to choose the type of education that is best<br />
for their children. We totally reject an educational<br />
philosophy which removes freedom of choice and which limits<br />
Government financial assistance only to State-run institutions.<br />
The Australian Government supports schools like Yavneh and<br />
in recent years has provided Yavneh with capital and<br />
recurrent grants of over $ 400,000.<br />
Yavneh epitomises the initiative of the Australian Jewish<br />
community. The secondary college itself is named after a<br />
man whose initiative and energy is an example and<br />
inspiration to us all.<br />
The late ir A. S. Leibler involved himself in many aspects<br />
of commlunal life. le was one of the founders of the<br />
Mizrachi Organisation in Melbourne, a President of the Jewis<br />
Board of Deputies and a founder of this school. The foresight<br />
and work of men like the late Mr. Leibler has come to<br />
fruition with the opening of this college.<br />
It gives me great pleasure to formally declare open<br />
the " Yavneh A. S. Leibler Secondary College".<br />
