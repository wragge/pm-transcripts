EMBARGO: 6 P. M.<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, MR. E. G. WHITLAM, M. P.,<br />
AT THE OPENING CEREMONY AT THE NEW A. B. C. BUILDING COMPLEX,<br />
COLLINSWOOD, ADELAIDE, FRIDAY 29 MARCH 1974<br />
It is almost 42 years since the Australian Broadcasting<br />
Commission was founded with the requirement that it " shall<br />
broadcast from the national broadcasting stations adequate<br />
and comprehensive programs, and shall take in the interests<br />
of the community all such measures as in the opinion of the<br />
Commission are conducive to the full development of suitable<br />
broadcasting programs". At this time the Commission began its<br />
operations in South Australia from an old stone building in<br />
Hindmarsh Square the first freehold property " acquired" by<br />
the A. B. C. in Australia. Today the Commission is able finally<br />
to house itself in Adelaide in up-to-date adequate accommodation,<br />
The new ten-storey administration, radio and orchestral<br />
studio complex here at Collinswood is spacious and, among other<br />
things, fully airconditioned. The building will provide vastly<br />
improved accommodation for all administrative and program<br />
departments, News, Technical Services, Publicity, " TV Times",<br />
Staff Association and Credit Union Offices. Large studios for<br />
the South Australian Symphony Orchestra and for light<br />
entertainment programs and two smaller studios for drama and<br />
general production are already fully operative. Hindmarsh<br />
Square ill be completely vacated by late this year when the<br />
last A. B. C. units have moved into this new building.<br />
It is appropriate that such a long-needed development<br />
is taking place in 1974. For it appears that this year will<br />
be one of great modernisation for the A. B. C. It is only about<br />
two weeks since the Minister for the Media, Senator Doug<br />
McClelland, tabled in the Federal Parliament the document which<br />
provides for modernisation.<br />
I refer, of course, to the report prepared by the<br />
Management Consultants, McKinsey Company. The report suggests<br />
a number of important recommendations for the future development<br />
of the A. B. C. These ' range from management organisation to<br />
program output. By the nature of its charter, the Commission itself<br />
will take the final decision on acceptance or otherwise of<br />
the McKinsey Report recommendations, although inevitably the<br />
government will be involved if these proposals require<br />
amendments to existing legislation. There is, however, one<br />
simple decision, involving both the Commission and the<br />
government which has already been made and the importance of<br />
which can easily be overlooked. This is the decision to make<br />
the McKinsey Report public. When the company made a similar<br />
study of the its report there was not published.<br />
Both the A. B. C. and the Government decided that the British<br />
precedent should not be followed in the handling of what is<br />
after all a report for Australians about their national<br />
broadcasting system.<br />
Looking beyond the needs of Australians generally,<br />
the government and the Commission decided that it was important<br />
for the staff of the A. B. C. 6,700 people that they should have </p>
<p>-2-<br />
ready access to the report. It is too important a document<br />
about too important an institution involving too many people<br />
for it to remain the subject of rumour and speculation.<br />
In as much as mora~ le problems may exist within the A. B. C.,<br />
I trust that our action in publishing the report indicates<br />
a desire and a willingness for the staff to participate in<br />
the debate that flows from it. Indeed, it is interesting that<br />
the first through discussion, including an interview with the<br />
A. B. C. Chairman, took place on an A. B. C. program, " This Day<br />
Tonight". It was especially appropriate for this program<br />
to open the debate fully and, dare I say it, even with some<br />
relish. While there may be a need for modernising the A. B. C.,<br />
" This Day Tonight" and its sister program, " Four Corners"<br />
symbolises the need for the durability of certain basic<br />
principles in the operation of the organisation. They, more<br />
than any other programs, have been the subject of controversy<br />
arising out of these principles. Simply stated, they have<br />
been central to the debate about the independence and freedom<br />
from political interference of the organisation. They have<br />
involved men and women whose determination to maintain<br />
independence and to resist interference deserves high praise.<br />
There will, of course, be some argument about the extent<br />
to which the independence and freedom of the A. B. C. have been<br />
threatened. I know that previous Chairmen of the A. B. C. have<br />
stated that such trends have always been exaggerated. I will<br />
say now, however, that those trends have at times been real,<br />
although some of them have been implicit rather than stated.<br />
I have only to mention what happened in the 1960s when an<br />
interview of a former French Premier, M Bidault, was banned<br />
to establish my point. I have only to mention what happened<br />
to " The Quiet Mutiny", a program about Vietnam produced<br />
by an Australian, John Pilger, and what happened about " End<br />
of Dialogue", a program on apartheid in South Africa, to<br />
support my point.<br />
I would mention in this context the disquiet I expressed<br />
in a speech in 1971 about what I saw as a new means of potential<br />
unilateral censorship. I spoke then about the dangers of applying<br />
too rigidly a policy of not allowing a point of view to be put on<br />
the A. B. C. if the opposing point of view was not presented more<br />
or less at the same time. I pointed out that it would be absurd<br />
for the one point of view not to be put simply because its opponents<br />
chose to remain silent. By all means, they should be given the<br />
opportunity to speak but, by no means, should their decision to<br />
remain silent enable the stifling of the viewpoint which they oppose.<br />
" It is wrong that politicians of either Party should in effect be<br />
able to censor a debate by refusal to appear," I said then. </p>
<p>-3<br />
Pressure against the A. B. C. has always involved means<br />
other than direct approach or intervention. A public statement,<br />
even if unaccompanied by action, can in itself be a source of<br />
pressure, designed to frighten men and women engaged in the<br />
delicate task of presenting information about matters of public<br />
controversy. I have no reason to revise my suspicious views<br />
of the motives of a former Postmaster-General who could say:<br />
" I think in some programs there is not what I would call a<br />
proper balance, which gets very close to leading to bias on<br />
the program and I don't merely say political bias."<br />
I see no reason to revise my suspicions of the motives of<br />
the same man who said in the same statement that the Australian<br />
Broadcasting Commissioners should preview controversial programs<br />
of programs that were likely to be controversial. I certainly<br />
see no reason to revise my suspicions about one Reverend.<br />
parliamentarian who thought the answer to the problem was to<br />
come up with his own set of guidelines for the A. B. C.<br />
I have never made any secret of my great admiration for<br />
a former Labor Prime Minister, John Curtin. In talking about the<br />
I find again that on this, as on so many other subjects,<br />
what he had to say made profound sense. It is worth quoting<br />
at some length a statement he made on 12 April 1945. He said<br />
then:-" The Government recognises that the intent of the<br />
Australian Broadcasting Act is to create a position<br />
of special independence of judgment and action for<br />
the national broadcasting instrumentality. This is<br />
inevitably the case because of its highly delicate<br />
function in broadcasting at public expense news<br />
statements and discussions which are potent influences<br />
on public opinion and attitudes. As the legislation<br />
provides, this peculiar function calls for an undoubted<br />
measure of independence for the controlling body of<br />
the national broadcasting instrumentality which cannot<br />
be measured by the constitution of other semi-governmental<br />
boards or agencies which do not impinge on the tender<br />
and dangerous realms of moral, religious, aesthetic<br />
and political values. In the last resort, the healthy<br />
and beneficent functions of national broadcasting<br />
and the maintenance of public confidence in the system<br />
must rest, in all matters touching these values, solely<br />
on the integrity and independent judgment of the persons<br />
chosen to determine and administer its policy, and not<br />
on either review by, or pressure from, any sources<br />
outside it, political or non-political. This principle<br />
holds good in spite of the necessary responsibility of<br />
the Commission to Parliament through the Minister, for<br />
the legitimate use of its funds under the terms of the<br />
Act, and all the sections of the Act should be read in<br />
the light of the above general intent of Parliament to<br />
the establishment of the Commission." / 4 </p>
<p>4<br />
Those principles hold good today. Those principles,<br />
after a period of questionable activity, are being applied<br />
again today. I can affirm from this platform that, since it<br />
came into office sixteen months ago, the present government<br />
has not sought to interfere with A. B. C. programs. I can affirm<br />
that, in that time, we have not sought to suppress any program<br />
or determine its contents. Indeed, I can point to one major<br />
instance where the present government has created the opportunity<br />
for fuller debate of public issues. It has been the practice<br />
of Prime Ministers to make occasional broadcasts to the nation<br />
about major matters of public interest. Inevitably those<br />
broadcasts have involved at times statements which the Parties<br />
opposed to those Prime Ministers would dispute vigorously.<br />
When I was Leader of the Opposition, I never had the opportunity<br />
to gain a similar forum for the statement of contrary views.<br />
The present Leader of the Opposition has such a forum. In<br />
the last sixteen months the A. B. C. has acceded to every request<br />
he has made for the right to reply to any Report to the Nation<br />
which I have delivered.<br />
I talked earlier about the need for durability of<br />
basic principles, even at a time of modernisation. My Government<br />
is firmly committed to those principles of independence and<br />
freedom from political interference. We have sogght to maintain<br />
and enhance them for the A. B. C. since we came into office.<br />
It is our hope that we will establish such a strong precedent in<br />
this way that no future government will dare to deny them, that<br />
no future government will dare to belittle the competence and<br />
judgment of honest men or worse, to seek to drive them from the<br />
organisation. </p>
