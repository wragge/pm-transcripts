FOR MEDIA TUESDAY, 9-MARCH 1982<br />
SPEECH TO THE PARLIAMENT<br />
ON THE STATE OF THE NATION<br />
Today, Mr Speaker, I would like the House to step back from the<br />
cut and thrust of everyday political life to consider the<br />
direction in which we wish to move as a nation in the next few<br />
years. This Parliament has a profound responsibility to keep<br />
abreast of the whole range of issues facing Australia. We<br />
need to understand Australia's position in a broad perspective<br />
as well as in detail, in the light of international as well<br />
as domestic factors. We need to understand the choices which<br />
lie ahead and the consequences of the decisions we take. We<br />
need a clear sense of our nation's values and objectives and<br />
we need to develop and explain our policies in the light of<br />
our phiLosophy.<br />
The world,,'-is full of uncertainty and because of this, Australia<br />
needs -olicy approach which is marked by balance, vision and<br />
realism. The world is also full of unrealistic demands and<br />
expectaiCions in spite of the immediate social and economic<br />
problems which many countries are experiencing and which are<br />
having an indirect impact on most countries.<br />
In a situation of significant uncertainty and difficulty, it<br />
would obviously be absurd to expect that high and immediate<br />
expectations can be attained at little cost or as a matter of<br />
course. But neither should we allow the difficulties being<br />
experienced by the world economy to be seen in a way which<br />
gets them out of proportion it would be wrong to overestimate<br />
or underestimate them.<br />
We need to try to understand them realistically because it is<br />
vital if we are to move ahead as one nation in the next few<br />
years that people's expectations should be closely adjusted to<br />
reality. Nobody has a crystal ball to predict the future fully<br />
but we do know that unless we anticipate and adapt our policies.<br />
in line with changing circumstances, unless wie are in a position<br />
to take advantage of changes in the world economy as and when<br />
they occur, then opportunities will pass Australia by.<br />
We also know that the old adage that you only get out as much<br />
as you put in remains as true today as it has always been<br />
and it is timely to remember, when we are considering realistic<br />
levels of expectations, that what some people get cannot go<br />
to others. </p>
<p>The international perspective<br />
In coming to grips with Australia's present position in an<br />
overall perspective, it is appropriate to start with the<br />
international dimension. our independence as a nation cannot<br />
blind us to the fact that overseas events affect us profoundly.<br />
Much of Australia's history bears witness to the recognition<br />
by earlier generations of Australians that we are affected by<br />
what happens in other parts of the world. At the present time,<br />
Australia cannot ignore the tensions and the threats which<br />
exist in so many parts of the world to international security<br />
and stability. The Soviet Union pursues its militaristic and<br />
opportunistic programmes relentlessly. We see the effects of<br />
that policy in Afghanistan and Poland and in attempts to<br />
frustrate the peace process in the Middle East. We see it<br />
through Cuba's support for Communist insurrection in Africa and<br />
Latin America and closer to home, Vietnamese troops continue<br />
to occupy Kampuchea, in violation of that country's sovereignty,<br />
and posing a threat to Thailand.<br />
Without question, the world situation is troubled and uncertain.<br />
New trouble spots can erupt with little or no warning. our<br />
policies m., ust-take account of the broad global context and we<br />
must recoc= ise that Australia's security-is bound up with the<br />
strength of the Western alliance. We obviously benefit from<br />
the securiltv which this alliance brings to us but at the same<br />
time we must7-s-h-o ulder the responsibilities which it entails.<br />
All of thsis part of interdependence and whether we are talking<br />
about threats to world peace and security, or about problems<br />
of world ; Dcverty, or about the slackness of world trade, the<br />
growing ilnterdependence of the world must be seen as fundamental.<br />
I would li~ e to say here that the development of multiculturalism<br />
in Australia in recent years has helped us enormously as a<br />
community in gaining the wider understanding which the successful<br />
management of interdependence will increasingly call for. I<br />
believe it is a tribute to our responsibility and compassion as<br />
a community that Australians have felt involved in tragic events<br />
in other countries and have given practical effect to these<br />
feelings as shown by the massive public responses to appeals<br />
like those for Kampuchea, for Southern Italy after the earthquake,<br />
and for Poland.<br />
The same concern is equally apparent in the willingness of hundreds<br />
of young Australians to respond to an appeal to go as teachers<br />
to Zimbabwe.<br />
Interdependence is real and in managing it we need policies<br />
which take advantage of the opportunities it creates, as well<br />
as minimising the difficulties and dangers which go with it.<br />
The growth of world trade provides a compelling illustration of<br />
our growing interdependance, of the advantages it can bring as<br />
well as its impact on key areas such as employment. </p>
<p>It was the rapid expansion of trade in the post Second World<br />
War period that was a mainspring of rapid world economic growth<br />
that supported the growth of employment opportunities, and of<br />
real living standards for countries at all levels of development.<br />
Between 1963 and 1970, while the volume of world output grew<br />
at an average annual rate of 5.6 per cent, the volume of world<br />
exports grew by 8.6 per cent per annum. But during the 1970s,<br />
the growth of world output and exports both significantly slowed<br />
and as a result unemployment started to get worse.<br />
It is particularly worth noting in this regard that between<br />
1973 and 1978, exports from developed to developing countries<br />
rose at an average rate of over 20%. How much worse would<br />
unemployment problems in developed countries now be without<br />
that trade?<br />
We must also recognise a further aspect of interdependence<br />
that other nations are taking an increasing interest in our<br />
economic and trade policies. others rightly expect us to be good<br />
neighbours, to play our full part in promoting the continued<br />
orderly growth of world trade as responsible members of the<br />
international economic community. It is plain that the growth<br />
of trade, and the growth of interdependence more generally,<br />
increasingly exposes a nation's economic system to influences<br />
from outside its own borders. Our own increased interdependence<br />
with the -rest of the world has been highlighted by the quite<br />
violent e: nomic fluctuations which have been a characteristic<br />
feature much of the last decade.<br />
Each sur~ e in the price of oil has led to a crisis which caused<br />
the grow-h-of world trade to slacken and Australia has been<br />
affected in a number of ways by both the oil price shocks and<br />
by the slackening of trade. There was obviously renewed interest<br />
in the exmioitation of alternative sources of energy and this<br />
has given Australia opportunities. But the slower growth in<br />
world markets has affected our exports and any dip in commodity<br />
prices due to unfavourable conditions overseas is plainly<br />
going to have an impact on Australia.<br />
Even before the first oil price increase in 1973, inflation had<br />
become more or less endemic in most industrialised nations..<br />
Excessive growth of government spending and inappropriate use<br />
of deficit financing played a major part in this. The oil<br />
price increases compounded these problems, making growing<br />
unemployment and growing inflation the order of the day. Even<br />
then, most countries did not recognise what was needed in terms<br />
of restraint of government spending, in terms of firmness of<br />
monetary policy and in terms of wage restraint. Although there<br />
are now signs in a number of countries of a determination to<br />
pursue more economically realistic policies, natural economic<br />
processes have run their course. In Europe and North America,<br />
economic growth has virtually come to a standstill in the last<br />
two years and unemployment is high, and rising. In France<br />
unemployment is in the USA it is 8.5% in the United<br />
Kingdom it is 11.7%. </p>
<p>By the second half of 1982, total of OECD unemployment is<br />
expected to rise to 28.5 million people, compared with just<br />
over 21 million in 1980. In these conditions of virtually no<br />
growth and rising unemployment, overseas inflation rates are<br />
falling. The OECD inflation rate is now unider 10% and falling,<br />
a reduction of three percentage points below the 1980. rate.<br />
The U. S. inflation rate fell from 12.4% in the 12 months to<br />
December 1980 to 8.9% in the 12 months to December 1981, and<br />
the British inflation rate fell from 15.1% to 12% in the same<br />
period. Perhaps paradoxically, sluggish growth and falling<br />
inflation has been accompanied by some of the highest interest<br />
rates, both real and nominal, that the world has seen. This<br />
situation stems from a number of factors.<br />
The situation should be seen against the background that<br />
interest rates rose less rapidly than inflation during the<br />
1970s. Real interest rates were negative for a substantial<br />
part of that decade. And while falling inflation rates in some<br />
countries is a cause for optimism, financial markets are not<br />
convinced that the underlying problem of inflation has been<br />
solved. The present situation has been aggravated by an<br />
unfortunate mix of policies in some countries. Budget deficits<br />
have been allowed to soar and the resulting pressures on the<br />
money supply have only been kept in check with exceptionally<br />
stringent monetary policies.<br />
Sluggish growth, low business profits and high interest rates<br />
have in ta* rn interacted to produce stagnant investment and<br />
continueP-economic recession. Overseas markets are growing<br />
very srl y, if at International commodity prices fell<br />
percent in the year to the last September quarter.<br />
Australia's farmers are also experiencing generally flat or<br />
falling prices along with rising costs and they are also<br />
subject -to quotas and restrictions of many kinds in international<br />
markets. Over the last year or so, and partly reflecting some of the<br />
factors I have been referring to, there have also been some<br />
significant shifts in the world oil situation. At the present<br />
time, world crude oil supplies are more than ample to meet<br />
demand but oil prices are still very high. The future levels<br />
of energy supply and energy prices are full of uncertainty.<br />
Our economy is inevitably constrained, and increasingly<br />
constrained by its interdependence with the rest of the world.<br />
We cannot but be affected by factors such as the present<br />
slackness in world demand, and the high cost of funds, nor<br />
can we avoid being affected by the protectionism which strikes<br />
at many of our exports, especially our farm products. And<br />
it is important for us to be aware of the very real dangers<br />
that are created by increasing protectionism in other countries<br />
during a time of world recession.<br />
Associated with these influences has been a rapid growth in<br />
our current account deficit, squeezed profitability for our<br />
export industries and some reappraisal and deferment of resource<br />
projects. But investment is still moving ahead strongly. </p>
<p>We cannot afford, as a nation, to try to ignore overseas<br />
developments or their inevitable influence upon us. What we must<br />
do is develop appropriate responses. We must be ready to react,<br />
ready to adapt, especially to fundamental changes in the world<br />
economy while minimising the undesirable efflects of unwelcome<br />
influences. In so doing we need policies which lay solid<br />
foundations for future growth which will allow us to take full<br />
advantage of the renewed growth overseas which must occur at<br />
some time and which will carry us through the intervening<br />
period of world downturn no matter how short or long it may<br />
turn out to be. In particular, we must prove ourselves reliable<br />
and competitive suppliers. We cannot afford to price ourselves<br />
out of world markets, or earn ourselves the reputation of being<br />
incapable of meeting contractual commitments because of poor<br />
industrial relations.<br />
The Australian Economic Achievement<br />
When we look at Australia's present position in the light of<br />
our economic achievements over recent years, it is plain that<br />
great advances have been made and a strong foundation laid for<br />
the future. Although we are a trading nation and despite the<br />
continuing slackness of world trade over recent years, we have<br />
swum against the tide. And I believe that in the current<br />
circumstanzmes, when the facts of interdependence plainly make<br />
our position increasingly difficult, our determination to succeed<br />
through farsighted and sustainable policies will be seen as<br />
right. i s an undoubted fact that as a result of our policies<br />
Australia hast prospered in recent years while the rest of the<br />
world has -een stagnating. Private enterprise has prospered<br />
and Aust---a7i-a has benefited. To be sure, we have had valuable<br />
resources -: 0o exploit and profit by in a troubled world economy.<br />
But that did not make success certain for the opportunities we<br />
had could have been squandered. Possession of resources is only<br />
the first condition of prosperity. Another necessary condition<br />
is sound government policy and there is no denying that the<br />
policies we have followed have created the conditions in which<br />
private enterprise has been encouraged to take the lead in<br />
exploiting the opportunities on offer. The confidence required<br />
for investment to go ahead has been created and as a result of<br />
this turnaround, the living standards of Australia's families<br />
have been improved and we now stand ready to grasp the opportunities<br />
which will inevitably lie ahead for us.<br />
A consistent assault on inflation has been essential in creating<br />
an environment in which private enterprise could plan and<br />
invest with confidence. The sustained restraint which has been<br />
imposed on government spending which has been virtually unrivalled<br />
throughout the world has been indispensable to success. The<br />
interests of all Australians require that this restraint must<br />
be maintained along with giving proper emphasis to priority<br />
needs and concerns. The Budget deficit has been pulled back<br />
from almost 5% of G. D. P. to less than The Commonwealth has eased<br />
the pressure on domestic capital markets by curbing its own<br />
borrowing requirements and we look for support in this endeavour<br />
from other levels of government. Action has been taken to<br />
promote industrial expansion and encourage the growth of<br />
productivity and there has been a concern for the competitive<br />
position of Australian industry. </p>
<p>While success with inflation has been vital, successful,<br />
non-disruptive'management of the exchange rate has also been<br />
vital. Secure and improved access for our products has been<br />
sought on established markets, in the Europe and Japan<br />
and Australian exports have been helped to make significant<br />
gains in new and expanding markets especially in Asia and the<br />
Middle East. Industry has been helped by initiatives to<br />
encourage industrial research and development and by an accelerated<br />
depreciation allowance. Industry has been given due notice of<br />
change where reduced levels of assistance are desirable.<br />
And to avoid delay in putting in place the stable policy<br />
foundation on which industry will be able to plan in the<br />
longer term, the general reference on tariffs was brought<br />
forward.<br />
Manufacturing industry is indispensable to balanced development<br />
throughout Australia and in 1981, manufacturing industry<br />
investment increased by 32% in money terms. The effect of all<br />
these policy approaches has been to build Australia up.<br />
Their goal, which we all share, has been higher livingj standards<br />
for Australia's families. And their benefits are now plain<br />
to see almost 400,000 new jobs created in the three years to the<br />
December quarter, almost 90% of them in the private sector;<br />
real household disposable incomes up by $ 2.9 billion after<br />
tax in 1980-81; average weekly earnings up by more than $ 13<br />
per week in real terms in the two years to the September quarter.<br />
This has been reflected in stronger growth in consumer spending<br />
and much stronger private investment in housing; between 1977-78<br />
and 19; 30-8l, investment in dwellings rose by 26.5% in real terms.<br />
The ga-ins that have been made also point towards a better future.<br />
Business profits rose 17% in real terms in the last three<br />
years. With that has come a surge in business investment.<br />
The 11360-81 rate of increase was the highest for. 30 years.<br />
The 1931-82 rate is also likely to be over 10% in real terms.<br />
And this, as a share of will bring business investment<br />
back close to the levels that used to be taken for granted in<br />
the 1960s.<br />
Business investment is vital to our children's future. It is<br />
the only basis of more jobs and more real spending power in the<br />
Australian community and this is why it is so important to give<br />
high priority to building up the economy. But it is not only<br />
in economic matters that Australians expect their Governments<br />
to apply effective policies. And when we look across a wider<br />
range of concerns, there is cause for pride in what has been<br />
achieved. I shall mention just a few areas in order to provide a broader<br />
perspective from which to view some of the challenges which lie<br />
ahead. In relation to defence, important steps have been taken<br />
in the policy of making sure Australia has an up-to-date and<br />
balanced defence force, including the acquisition of the F/ A-18<br />
fighter aircraft, of the British 105M. M. gun, and of the<br />
aircraft carrier Invincible; and we need to be aware that strong<br />
capabilities contribute not only to national security but also<br />
to regional stability and security. </p>
<p>In international affairs, consistent expression has been given<br />
to Australia's concerns and actions such as our efforts in<br />
relation to the issues of world poverty, our decision to take<br />
part in the Sinai Peacekeeping Force, and our contributions<br />
through the Commonwealth have helped to build Australia's<br />
reputation as a forward-looking, outward-looking and reliable<br />
nation. In the area of tax avoidance, determined measures have been<br />
consistently applied measures which are really biting into<br />
this anti-social industry.<br />
In the field of legal refor', the Human Rights Commission and<br />
now the Freedom of Information Legislation the first that<br />
will come into place nationally in a Westminster system<br />
are effective measures to meet important community concerns.<br />
In the field of environmental protection, the declaration last<br />
year of the new section of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park<br />
gave further clear expression to the concern for the preservation<br />
of our environment which is so widely felt in the community,<br />
especially among young people.<br />
In education, the issue of giving our young people the skills<br />
they need is being tackled and the increasing emphasis on<br />
TAFE is an important element in this.<br />
Families, especially those with low incomes who received little<br />
assista-nce from the old rebate arrangements, have been enormously<br />
assisteC1 by the Family Allowance Scheme which was introduced<br />
several years ago and family allowances were substantially<br />
increased for larger families from last January.<br />
In the area of social welfare, the automatic indexation of<br />
pensions has given income security to a very significant number<br />
of people in the community and assistance has been extended<br />
to particularly needy groups, such as pensioners facing high<br />
rents and sole parents on low incomes.<br />
It is obviously important that governments work to advance the<br />
wider opportunities and way of life which Australians want as<br />
well as working to secure and improve the material living<br />
standards of Australia's families. I believe that as a result<br />
of what has been achieved, Australia is now facing the future<br />
from a position of comparative strength for there is great<br />
underlying strength in our economy and as I have said already,<br />
we are well placed to take advantage of future opportunities<br />
provided we work hard to maintain our strong position.<br />
Challenges and problems<br />
But it is not only opportunities which lie ahead although they<br />
will surely come. As we look ahead, as we form our expectations<br />
for the future, we plainly need to recognize that there are<br />
also problems and challenges. It is our task to identify them,<br />
to explain them, to address them realistically; having done that,<br />
to seek the co-operation of the community in coming to terms<br />
with them. one thing which is plain at the present time is that<br />
a fresher and sharper breeze is blowing through the markets of<br />
the world as our-industrial competitors, faced with their own </p>
<p>situation of no growth and unemployment, restructure their<br />
industries, as they improve their productivity and efficiency<br />
and as their inflation rates fall. When this is added to the<br />
fact that many markets are, if anything, shrinking rather<br />
than growing, it is clear that we shall have to fight harder<br />
to sell the exports on which our economic development depends.<br />
This harder competition from overseas comes at a time when<br />
there are some problems on our own doorstep. Plainly, inflation<br />
remains at the forefront as the principal threat to our<br />
economy because while much has been achieved in pulling<br />
inflation back, there are substantial inflationary pressures in<br />
our economy at the present time.<br />
Demands for higher wages and shorter working hours have been<br />
contributing substantially to these pressures. And in Australia's<br />
present situation, there can be little doubt that excessive<br />
wage rises and damaging strikes are placing economic progress<br />
at serious risk. It is imperative that we recognise as a<br />
nation that wage rises which are beyon * d the capacity of the<br />
economy harm everyone and benefit no-one. They cause higher<br />
inflation; they threaten our ability to compete on world<br />
markets and they create more unemployment.<br />
There is no doubt that wage restraint in the next few months is<br />
vital to us all for further wage increases at this time on top<br />
of the wage and shorter hours settlements of the last six<br />
months are beyond the capacity of the economy and time is<br />
needed to absorb the increases which have already taken place.<br />
Let mes add that there is plainly a continuing need for an<br />
approrriately firm monetary policy. In present circumstances,<br />
with weakened balance of payments and strong inflationary<br />
pressures, there could be no thought that the money supply<br />
would be allowed to expand to accommodate inflationary wage<br />
settle-ments. It is vastly important to us all that demands<br />
and expectations should be matched with economic reality as<br />
it now is both internationally and domestically. Whatever else<br />
may be arguable, there is no doubt that our overall level of<br />
economic growth places clear limits on the sustainable real<br />
wage increases which can occur.<br />
We must never forget that everything, including wages, has to<br />
come out of what Australia is producing. Further limits on wage<br />
increases are imposed by the claims of needy and underprivileged<br />
people to share the benefits of prosperity and investors<br />
also have their legitimate claim for profits, which are the<br />
basis of the further investment on which future growth depends.<br />
As I have said on many occasions, Australia would benefit<br />
greatly from rational debate on the proper balance between these<br />
respective claims and I believe that such a debate could have<br />
a most valuable impact in helping every section of the<br />
community to decide what expectations are reasonable, what<br />
claims are legitimate, and which demands ought to be moderated.<br />
I turn to the industrial front where the level of strikes and<br />
industrial disputation is plainly a matter for the most serious<br />
concern. The Government is addressing the situation with some<br />
important legislative initiatives as part of an on-going </p>
<p>concern with reforminq industrial relations.<br />
First amonq these initiatives will be the provision giving<br />
private employers a right of stand-down in strike situations<br />
to bring about a better balance in the bargaining position<br />
of unions and employers and to equalize their responsibility<br />
before the law. We believe that this measure will help to<br />
bring home to unions the real cost to the community of strike<br />
action and that it will help bring a degree of balance to<br />
the negotiating process.<br />
The second initiative is designed to put renewed vigour into<br />
efforts to achieve a restructuring of unions more in line with<br />
the needs of a modern Australian economy and to move away<br />
from a system rigidly tied to craft-based unions.<br />
And the third proposal, for voluntary unionism, seeks to<br />
protect the basic rights of ordinary average Australians.<br />
The Commonwealth is also addressing a number of industrial<br />
relations issues in co-operation with the States. Important<br />
consensus was reached at the recent Premiers' Conference<br />
and Labour Ministers have already met to consider options to<br />
facilitate handling of demarcation disputes and the development<br />
of a complementary industrial relations system. In considering<br />
the problem of demarcation disputes, the objective must be<br />
both to protect employers who are harmed and unions which<br />
are att.-acked.<br />
The Prrniers have also agreed to work with the Commonwealth<br />
in efforts to seek agreement with unions and shipping interests<br />
along the lines of the recommendations of the Crawford Report,<br />
and to reduce the level of industrial disputation in the<br />
maritime and waterfront industries. Thus in co-operation with<br />
the States, and through our own legislative initiatives,<br />
we are taking a positive approach which should remove some of<br />
the hurdles in the path of industrial peace and bring a greater<br />
sense of responsibility into industrial relations.<br />
In addition to the threats to Australia's economic well-being<br />
posed by wage demands and industrial disputes, there are a<br />
number of other issues which are of great concern to the<br />
community which need to be explained and addressed with balance<br />
and realism.<br />
Home ownership is one issue which is causing very considerable<br />
concern in the community and nobody wants Australia's high level<br />
of home ownership to be damaged. The issue is complex. There<br />
are three inter-related problems. The availability of funds,<br />
the high interest rates which currently prevail, and the high<br />
cost of houses, especially in some cities. At the present<br />
time, the Government has this issue under close review and<br />
the Government will in due course announce the policy changes<br />
it believes are necessary.<br />
Taxation is a further issue of great concern to the entire<br />
community and I want to reaffirm that it is the policy of the<br />
Government to make further income tax reductions when it is<br />
economically responsible to do so. The present tax levels<br />
concern the Government as they concern the community and it is </p>
<p>important to remember the major taxation reforms which<br />
the Government has implemented including initiatives such as<br />
the doubling of the rebate for dependent spouses which has<br />
taken place, the deductibility of superannuation contributions<br />
up to $ 1200 a year for self-employed persons and others not<br />
covered by employer-sponsored schemes, the abolition of death<br />
duties, and the tax rebate for health insurance. ! the cost to revenue<br />
of these initiatives alone'is well over a billion dollars a year. it is<br />
dJxnPortant, when the comxniity considers taxation levels, to be aware of<br />
a-number of critical factors, the implications for the budget o f an<br />
ageing population, the need for increased defence expenditure,.<br />
and the need to pull back earlier budget deficits drastically.<br />
Consistent with factors such as these, the Government's<br />
commitment to lower taxes and greater spending power i~ s clear<br />
and we shall continue to follow those policies which provide<br />
the only basis for sustainable tax cuts.<br />
Mr Speaker, I have sought to draw the House's attention to<br />
some of the major factors which need to be taken into account<br />
by the Australian people as we look to the future and seek<br />
to match our expectations with reality. Many of the issues<br />
which we are facing are complex. Many of the problems do<br />
not offer easy solutions and the right balance between competing<br />
claims iJs in many cases difficult to find. But of course<br />
it is not" unusual for a situation to exist in which<br />
expectations are greater than can be satisfied, in which<br />
different groups within the community are making claims which<br />
are inconsistent with each other, in which some claims can<br />
be satizfied only at the expense of others, in which some<br />
short-term aims conflict with longer-term objectives.<br />
It is ea= sy for people in pursuing their own objectives to<br />
overlook the claims of others and put at risk the source of the<br />
future we-11-being of everyone.<br />
The objectives of the vast majority of Australians are plain.<br />
As a nation, we seek rising standards of living. We seek more<br />
dollars in taxpayers' pockets. We seek an increasingly<br />
compassionate society. We seek wider opportunities and<br />
greater scope for people to develop their talents. We seek<br />
greater security for all our people. we seek increasingly<br />
efficient public institutions. We seek the conservation of<br />
our heritage and our environment and much more as well. All<br />
of these objectives are consistent with each other and a<br />
balanced policy approach commits us to pursuing them all.<br />
But we plainly cannot pursue all or any of them as fast as<br />
we would wish. Indeed, in times of economic difficulty and<br />
stagnatidffeVEe~ ay be committeJ to pusuing them far more<br />
slowly than we would wish because one thing which is vastly<br />
important is that in pursuing these objectives, we cannot<br />
afford to destroy economic growth itself. without growth,<br />
all our other efforts and objectives will come to nothing.<br />
It is significant that Australia's growth rate in the last two<br />
years has been almost twice the OECD average and it is<br />
significant that the OECD predicts a growth rate of over 3%<br />
for Australia in 1982 against an OECD average of just over 1%. </p>
<p>11.<br />
There is growth in our economy but we cannot take the future<br />
for granted. In a situation of international uncertainty and<br />
world economic downturn, where our own growth is held back by<br />
the no-growth situation of other economies, we must surely<br />
accept as a community the need to avoid putting at risk the<br />
present strength of our economy.<br />
In dealing with these issues, it is imperative that we weigh<br />
up our own claims and expectations against the kind of growing<br />
Australia which we want to build for our children, considering<br />
both in the light of the real opportunities which are open<br />
to Australia in the interdependent world in which we live<br />
because only in that way can we reach responsible conclusions<br />
on the decisions which lie before us both as individuals and<br />
as a nation. ooo000ooo---<br />
