    <content><![CDATA[<p>Dr Kelvin Kong, Indigenous Affairs co-chair of the Australia 2020 Summit, has today withdrawn his participation in the Summit due to family health concerns.</p>
<p>I want to extend my best wishes to Dr Kong and his family and thank him for his valuable contribution up to this point.</p>
<p>I would like to announce that Jackie Huggins AM will be the new co-chair of the Indigenous Affairs panel at the Australia 2020 summit.</p>
<p>Dr Huggins is a first class individual who will bring a wealth of experience to this role.  She is a former co-chair of Reconciliation Australia and a recipient of the Australia Medal (AM) in 2001.</p>
<p>A woman of the Bidjara/Birri-Gubba Juru peoples, Dr Huggins is currently Deputy Director of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies Unit at the University of Queensland.</p>
<p>A historian and published author, Dr Huggins is a director of the Telstra Foundation and a member of the Indigenous Reference Group at the Centre of Domestic and Family Violence Research in Central Queensland.</p>
<p>Dr Huggins' rigorous approach to her work and her contribution to policy development in this area will be a valuable addition to the Australia 2020 Summit, and I look forward to working with her in this capacity.</p>
