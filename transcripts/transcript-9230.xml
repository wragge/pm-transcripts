PRIME MINISTER<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING MP<br />
ABORIGINAL AND TORRES STRAIT ISLANDER LAND FUND<br />
The Budget delivered this week meets the Government's commitment to<br />
establish an Aboriginal Land Fund part of our comprehensive response to<br />
the Mabo decision, and our determination to provide justice for all Aboriginal<br />
and Torres Strait Islander people.<br />
The Government will allocate an amount of $ 200m in 1994-95, and $ 121m<br />
adjusted for inflation thereafter for 9 years, to an Aboriginal and Torres Strait<br />
Islander Land Fund to be established by legislation to be introduced later this<br />
year. The total amount of the allocations to the Fund as indicated in the Budget<br />
papers is $ 1.463 billion. This figure is the expected total of cash allocations<br />
to the Fund over 10 years allowing for maintenance of the allocations in real<br />
terms. The Fund will be established under the ATSIC Act, and will be the subject of<br />
further discussions with indigenous interests before the introduction of the<br />
Bill.<br />
The Fund will be invested so as to accumulate a self-sustaining fund for the<br />
acquisition and management of both existing and newly acquired indigenous<br />
land.<br />
An Indigenous Land Corporation will also be established which will receive<br />
draw downs from the Fund. Draw downs will be $ 25 million in 1994-95, and<br />
up to $ 45 million in following years adjusted for inflation. ATSIC's existing<br />
land acquisition and management program will be amalgamated into the<br />
Fund. As an independent specialist body, the Corporation will be able to focus<br />
specifically on land matters, and will have the necessary commercial<br />
expertise in land acquisition and management. The Board of the Corporation<br />
will include the ATSIC Chairperson and at least one ATSIC Commissioner.<br />
Members of the Board will have specialist expertise. The details of the 43/ 94 </p>
<p>Constitution of the Board will be the subject of discussions with indigenous<br />
interests. Publicly available regional strategies will be the basis for the<br />
Corporation's planning for land acquisitions.<br />
As I stated in the Second Reading Speech on the Native Title Bill 1993, the<br />
Government has always recognised that despite its historic significance, the<br />
Mabo decision gives little more than a sense of justice to those Aboriginal<br />
communities whose native title has been extinguished or lost without<br />
consultation, negotiation or compensation. Their dispossession has been<br />
total, their loss has been complete.<br />
The Government shares the view of ATSIC, other Aboriginal and Torres Strait<br />
Islander organisations and the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation, that<br />
justice, equity and fairness demand that the social and economic needs of<br />
these communities must be addressed as an essential step towards<br />
reconciliation. While these communities remain dispossessed of land, their economic<br />
marginalisation and their sense of injury continue. This dispossession has<br />
led to the social and economic marginalisation which the government is<br />
intending to address through a package of social justice measures, of which<br />
the Land Fund will be the major financial component.<br />
The Government remains committed to working with ATSIC and other<br />
indigenous representatives to remedy indigenous dispossession.<br />
