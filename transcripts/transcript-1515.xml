COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA<br />
, SPEECHES BY<br />
The Rt Hon. HAROLD HOLT, M. P.,<br />
ON<br />
CONSTITUTION ALTERATION PARLIAMENT)<br />
BILL 1967<br />
AND)<br />
CONSTITUTION ALTERATION ( ABORIGINALS)<br />
BILL 1967<br />
Second Reading<br />
[ From the ' Parliamentary Debates', 1 March .1967]<br />
CONSTIUTION ALTERATION<br />
( PARLIAMENT) BILL 1967<br />
Mr HAROLD HOLT ( Higgins-Prime<br />
Minister) [ 8.42]-1 move:<br />
. That the Bill be now read . a second time.<br />
As I informed honourable members in my<br />
statement in this House last week, the Government<br />
has -decided to proceed with the<br />
referendum proposals that were embodied<br />
in . the two Bills passed by both Houses<br />
towards the end of 1965 and to add * a<br />
further proposal with respect to section<br />
51 ( xxvi). Because of the requirements of<br />
section 128 of the Constitution relating to<br />
alteration of the Constitution, the Bills that<br />
were passed in 1965 with a view to their<br />
submission to a referendum have lapsed and<br />
fresh Bills must be passed before the alterations<br />
they propose to the Constitution can<br />
be submitted to the electors. The Bill now<br />
before the House is, in its substantive provisions,<br />
identical with the Bill on the same<br />
subject passed by both Houses in 1965,<br />
except -in one significant respect. That is<br />
3211/ 67 the substitution of ' 85,000' for ' 80,000' in<br />
sub-section of proposed new section 24.<br />
1 will come back to this alteration later.<br />
This Bill, as honourable members will be<br />
aware, is the Bill to break the present link<br />
between the size of this House and the<br />
size of the ' Senate. This link or nexus is<br />
provided for by. section 24 of the Constitution,<br />
the first paragraph of which reads:<br />
The House of Repiesentatives shall be composed<br />
of members directly chosen by the people<br />
of the Commonwealth, and the number of such<br />
members shall be, as nearly as practicable, twice<br />
the number of the senators.<br />
Unless the requirement -that the number of<br />
members shall be, as nearly as practicable,<br />
twice the number of the senators, is<br />
deleted from section 24, any increase in the<br />
House of Representatives must . be accompanied<br />
by an increase of half that number<br />
in the Senate. While this provision is not<br />
to be interpreted with exact mathematical<br />
precision-indeed the present House<br />
consists of slightly more members than the<br />
120 -that results from a strict doubling of </p>
<p>the number of Senators-it is nevertheless<br />
clear, and it has been the consistent view<br />
of constitutional advisers over many years,<br />
that it is not open to the Parliament to<br />
increase the size of this House except by<br />
a very small number without at the same<br />
time increasing the number of senators.<br />
Such a limitation is not imposed on other<br />
parliaments, and it is, I believe, the view<br />
of a large majority of this Parliament that,<br />
whilst the substantial growth in population<br />
will make some expansion of this House<br />
necessary and desirable, it should not<br />
follow that the number of senators be<br />
increased proportionately.<br />
Unless some measures are taken soon to<br />
increase the size of the House of Representatives,<br />
it will bccame impracticable for<br />
members -adequately to perform the<br />
functions on behalf of their electors that<br />
are expected of them. As Sir Robert<br />
Menzies said when introducing the corresponding<br />
Bill in November 1965:<br />
*'' The problems being looked at by<br />
honourable members today are three or four times<br />
more weighty and more complex than they were<br />
when I first came into this House. I know this<br />
at first hand. I am not an idler; I have worked<br />
all this time and I know what it means<br />
We have the supreme duty to represent o ur<br />
people and to represent them effectively. To<br />
represent them effectively, there must be a<br />
proper proportion between the number of members<br />
of this Hotuse and the number of the electors<br />
in the nation as a whole.<br />
I shall illustrate the point a -little further.<br />
If the Constitution remains unamended,<br />
by 1969 the existing number of members,<br />
or very close to -the existing number, will<br />
have held for twenty years. The last change<br />
of significance was made in 1949. ' It is<br />
estimated that the population of. Australia<br />
will have risen from just on eight . milli on<br />
in 1949 to twelve million, or thereabouts,<br />
by the end of 1969. There will be this<br />
increase in population of approximately<br />
since the last change was made. Anybody<br />
who has been in this place for any<br />
number of years will appreciate the force<br />
of what Sir Robert said as to the range<br />
of matters which have to be dealt with<br />
compared with the more limited jurisdicdiction*<br />
which -the Parliament took to itself.<br />
in those earlier years.<br />
As I mentioned in the House last week,<br />
there is, I believe, agreement among all<br />
members of both Houses that, because of the disproportion which has developed in<br />
the numbers represented in certain electorates,<br />
a redistribution should be made before<br />
the next general elections. Some electorates<br />
in the same State have less than 40,000<br />
voters, while -others have in excess of<br />
100,000, and the disparity will have<br />
widened by the time of the next election,<br />
whenever that may be. It would clearly<br />
be imprudent to set in motion a redistribution<br />
until we had ascertained the views of<br />
the people on the question of breaking<br />
the nexus. Further, not only has the number<br />
of voters in some electorates now<br />
become very large but, as suggested by<br />
Sir Robert Menzies in the speech from<br />
which I have just quoted, -the burdens of<br />
members have increased considerably.<br />
Government in Australia today is active in<br />
many more fields, and the range of problems<br />
which th-is has created has had a<br />
significant impact on the duties of the<br />
people's representatives.<br />
Additionally, our population contains<br />
growing proportions of young people and<br />
of migrants. The future of our country lies<br />
to a significant extent in these people, and<br />
they have therefore been the subject of<br />
special attention by the Government and<br />
its agencies, through social services and<br />
other means. The Commonwealth has increasingly<br />
been drawn by the will of the<br />
electorate into fields that were originally<br />
the province of the States. We have seen<br />
this occurring in health and education, to<br />
give only two illustrations. Although the<br />
young people and many of our migrants<br />
hiave no vote, their welcome presence in<br />
the community has the effect of adding<br />
significantly to the burdens of those who<br />
represent the electorates in which they live.<br />
I know that this strikes a" responsive ch~ rd<br />
in the LUader of the Opposition ( Mr<br />
Whitlam),' who has told me on more than<br />
one occasion not only that he has an electorate<br />
with a yery'large number of voters<br />
but also that a very considerable number<br />
of migrants have settled in it.<br />
Mr James-He told the right honourable<br />
gentleman-that in confidence.<br />
MrU HAROLD HOLT-I do not think so.<br />
He has made no secret of the fact that he<br />
represents a substantial part of the Australian<br />
electorate, at least in his own constituency,<br />
even though I cannot attribute </p>
<p>the same merit to him with respect to the<br />
electorate at large. I am sure that my colleagues,<br />
the honourable member for Lalor<br />
( Mr Lee), the Minister for Immigration ( Mr<br />
Snedden), who represents the electorate of<br />
Bruce, and the honourable member for<br />
Mitchell ( Mr Irwin), will confirm the point<br />
that I have made. I have singled them out<br />
because they come readily to mind.<br />
The points that I have mentioned all<br />
suggest the need not only for a redistribution<br />
but also for power to make increases<br />
deemed appropriate in the size of the<br />
popular House. Unless the nexus is removed,<br />
a significant increase in the size of the<br />
House of Representatives cannot be made<br />
unless the number of senators also is increased<br />
proportionately. To enable the<br />
Senate to continue to operate on a basis<br />
similar to that on which it is operating at<br />
present-that is, with an uneven number of<br />
senators standing for election on every<br />
occasion in each State-the minimum increase<br />
is twenty-four. This would mean<br />
increasing the size of the House of Representatives<br />
by some forty-eight members.<br />
No-one in this Parliament-nor any member<br />
of the public-would want this result.<br />
Nor do we as a government.<br />
There have been suggestions-and no<br />
doubt they will be made again-that the<br />
object of the proposed changes in section 24<br />
of the Constitution is to permit an excessive<br />
increase in the number of members<br />
in Parliament. Nothing could be further<br />
from the truth. The purpose of the proposal<br />
is to seek from ' the electors approval<br />
to alter the Constitution so that, as the<br />
growth of the Commonwealth's population<br />
demands, this Parliament can legislate for<br />
a modest increase in the size of the popular<br />
House without -having at the same time to<br />
increase the size of the Senate. If carried,<br />
our proposals will permit the smallest increase<br />
that we consider to be consistent with<br />
effective representation. Indeed, as I shall<br />
explain later, there will for the first time be<br />
introduced into the Constitution a provision<br />
which will have the effect of placing<br />
an upper limit on the number of members<br />
of the popular House.<br />
The Government, I may say, has considered<br />
other suggestions that have been<br />
brought forward to effect an increase in<br />
the size of the House of Representatives and at the same time enable an increase in the<br />
size of the Senate, but without having the<br />
considerable jump in numbers that would<br />
follow if we maintained the present<br />
system of voting. However, we have concluded-<br />
as indeed Sir Robert Menzies<br />
concluded-that none of them offers a<br />
wholly satisfactory solution, under the system<br />
of proportional representation-a system<br />
which experience has shown to be the<br />
best that has so far been devised. We have<br />
looked in particular at a proposal that the<br />
Senate be increased by a -total of six, with<br />
one additional senator for each State, making<br />
eleven senators for each State. This<br />
would mean that at alternate elections there<br />
would be six senators voted for on one<br />
occasion and five on the other. It might<br />
prove necessary to have six senators elected<br />
in some States and five in others at the<br />
same election. The possibility of a deadlocked<br />
Senate could be increased, and there<br />
are other factors which, in the view of the<br />
Government, make this a less desirable<br />
course -than the more simple and clear cut<br />
proposal to increase the House of Representatives<br />
to the required extent without<br />
the requirement of a corresponding increase<br />
in the Senate. I think I should observe that,<br />
even if the proposal that the size of the<br />
Senate be increased by six were adoptedand<br />
this could be done without a constitutional<br />
amendment at all-the result would<br />
be that we would be faced with an increase<br />
of some eighteen members and senators in<br />
all. In other words, to provide for the addition'of<br />
twelve or thirteen members of this<br />
House-if that were the number considered<br />
necessary-six senators would have to be<br />
added to the National Parliament, even<br />
though it might be generally agreed that at<br />
the time there was no adequate reason for<br />
increasing the size of the Senate.<br />
There . are ' two things that I want to say<br />
about the position of the Senate. The proposed<br />
amendments of section 24 of the-<br />
Constitution will not, in the view of the<br />
Government, in any way erode the role of<br />
the Senate. Nor will they preclude a future<br />
increase in the size of the Senate, should<br />
that at any time be considered desirable.<br />
As to the first matter, we believe that the<br />
Senate, as ' at present constituted, is well<br />
able to discharge-and to discharge effectively-<br />
the role designed for it by the Constitution.<br />
We are well aware that some fears<br />
are held that the prestige and authority of </p>
<p>the Senate . may in some manner be diminished<br />
as a consequence of. this proposal, and<br />
that the role it . can perform as a house of<br />
review and custodian of the rights of the<br />
smaller States may be-weakened. We do not<br />
accept these views -as having practical force.<br />
The good sense of the electorate and of the<br />
Parliament will, I believe, provide effective<br />
safeguards against any such weakening of<br />
the position of the Senate.<br />
Moreover, two protections of the . position<br />
of the Senate will be afforded by the present<br />
proposals. Firstly, State representation will<br />
be protected by guaranteeing to original<br />
States-that is, all the existing States-a<br />
minimum of ten senators, in lieu of six<br />
senators guaranteed under the Constitution<br />
in its present form. Secondly, as a guarantee<br />
against excessive increases in the size of<br />
the House of Representatives, the Bill provides<br />
that the number of members of this<br />
House shall be ascertained by dividing the<br />
number of people of the States by a number<br />
determined by the Parliament, but not being<br />
less than 85,000. The 1965 Bill provided<br />
that the number of people was to be divided<br />
by a number not less than 80,000.<br />
On reflection, the Government has decided<br />
that the minimum figure is to be<br />
preferred. Adoption of 85,000 as the population<br />
quota would permit a total increase<br />
of thirteen or fourteen members by about<br />
1969. This, I stress, is. a maximum increase,<br />
not minimum increase. I recall that, at the<br />
time of the First Parliament in 1901, the<br />
average population per electorate was about<br />
50,000. By 1947 it had risen to over<br />
100,000, and the size . of this House was<br />
then increased from 74 members to 121<br />
members. By the .1949 elections the average<br />
population per electorate . was some 67,000;<br />
by 1969, we expect, the average would rise to<br />
a figure in excess of 94,000. I point out that,<br />
if : the Government's proposals embodied<br />
in this Bill become -law, it will be the first<br />
occasion on which the Constitution has<br />
imposed an upper limit on the total number<br />
in the popular House.<br />
I commend the Bill to the House. I<br />
believe . that the proposals contained . in it<br />
should be approved by the people, and<br />
that, if they are, this will constitute a<br />
significant advance in the efficient working<br />
of . our parliamentary system.<br />
Debate ( on motion by Mr Whitlam) adjourned. ( CONSTITUTION ALTERATION<br />
i( ABORIGINALS) BILL 1967<br />
Mr ' HAROLD HOLT .( Higgins-Prime<br />
Minister) move:<br />
That the Bill be now read a second time.<br />
The purpose of this Bill is to make alterations<br />
to the two provisions of the Constitution<br />
which make explicit reference to people<br />
of the Aboriginal race. One alteration-that<br />
proposed by clause 3 of the Bill-is designed<br />
to repeal section 127. An identical proposal<br />
was passed unanimously by both Houses<br />
of the Parliament in November 1965. Section<br />
127 provides that, in reckoning the<br />
numbers of the people of the Commonwealth,<br />
or of . a State or other part of the<br />
Commonwealth, Aboriginal natives shall not<br />
be counted. The Government continues to<br />
believe that this section should be repealed.<br />
The principal reason for including section<br />
127 in the Constitution was the practical<br />
difficulty of enumerating the Aboriginal<br />
population at that time. No doubt in 1900<br />
this was a very substantial problem. It is,<br />
however, no longer a serious difficulty, and<br />
the basis for the existence of the section<br />
consequently does not now exist. I should<br />
emphasise that section 127 does not affect<br />
the qualifications of Aboriginals to vote at<br />
Commonwealth elections. Section 41 has<br />
always guaranteed an Aboriginal the right<br />
to vote at elections if he has a right to vote<br />
at elections for the more. numerous House<br />
of the Parliament of the State in which he<br />
is a voter, and this Parliament itself has<br />
removed all disabilities in respect of voting<br />
at Commonwealth elections so far as<br />
Aboriginals . are concerned. They are now<br />
entitled to enrol and to vote ' and should,<br />
in the view of the Government, ' be counted<br />
as part of the population of the ' Commonwealth,<br />
or : their State . or Territory, for any<br />
purpose. The simple truth is that section 127<br />
is completely . out of harmony with our<br />
national . attitudes . and modern thinking. It<br />
h'as , no place in our Constitution in this age.<br />
The second alteration, ' which -is contained<br />
in clause 2 of the Bill, is the deletion of the<br />
words ' other than the Aboriginal race in any<br />
State' ' from paragraph ( xxvi) of section 51.<br />
Section 51,'( xxvi) of the Constitution reads:<br />
The Parliament shall, subject to this Constitution,<br />
have power to make laws for the peace, order and<br />
good government of the Commonwealth with<br />
respect to:-<br />
( xxvi) The people of any race, other than the<br />
aboriginal race in any State, for whom it is<br />
deemed necessary to make special laws. </p>
<p>Since the Government's earlier proposals<br />
for constitutional alterations were put<br />
before the Parliament, a great deal of<br />
thought has been given, both inside and<br />
outside the Parliament, to the constitutional<br />
provisions relating to the Aboriginal people<br />
and there has been much activity by<br />
Government private members and organisations<br />
concerned with the welfare of the<br />
Aboriginals. In the light of this activity and<br />
the many representations made, the Government<br />
has reviewed the position and has<br />
decided that an amendment of section<br />
51 ( Xxvi), as provided for in the Bill, should<br />
be put to the people, in addition to the<br />
proposal for the repeal of section 127. In<br />
coming to this conclusion, the Government<br />
has been influenced by the popular impression<br />
that the words now proposed to be<br />
omitted from section 51 ( xxvi) are discriminatory-<br />
a view which the Government<br />
believes to be erroneous but which, nevertheless,<br />
seems to be deep rooted.<br />
An effect of omitting these words will be<br />
the removal of the existing restriction on<br />
-the power of the Commonwealth to make<br />
special laws for the people of the Aboriginal<br />
race in any State if the Parliament<br />
considers it necessary. As the Constitution<br />
stands at present, the Commonwealth ' has<br />
no power, except in the Territories, to<br />
legislate with respect to people of the<br />
Aboriginal race as such. If the words<br />
' other than the Aboriginal race in any<br />
State' were deleted from section 51 ( xxvi),<br />
the result would be that the Commonwealth<br />
Parliament would have vested in it<br />
a concurrent legislative power with -respect<br />
to Aboriginals as such, they being the<br />
people of a race, provided the Parliament<br />
deemed it necessary to make special laws<br />
for them. It is the view of the Government<br />
that the National Parliament should have<br />
this power. If the proposals relating to<br />
Aboriginals are approved by the people,<br />
the Government would regard it as desirable<br />
to hold discussions with the States to secure the widest * measure of agreement<br />
with respect to Aboriginal advancement.<br />
1 think 1 should say a few words about<br />
the suggestion . that has been made that we<br />
should include a constitutional guarantee<br />
against discrimination on the ground of<br />
race. Such a proposal was put forward,<br />
in particular, by the honourable member<br />
for Mackellar ( Mr Wentworth) in a private<br />
member's Bill. The recommendation to<br />
include such a guarantee in our Constitution<br />
has the obvious attraction of providing<br />
evidence of the Australian people's desire<br />
to outlaw discriminatory practices of every<br />
kind, but the disadvantages of the inclusion<br />
of such a guarantee are so substantial that<br />
the Government does * not believe that it<br />
should be pursued. Such a guarantee could<br />
provide a fertile source of attack on the<br />
Constitutional validity of legislation which<br />
we, at this point of time, would not consider<br />
discriminatory. The extent of litigation<br />
that has arisen from section 92 provides<br />
a serious warning of the ramifications<br />
of an apparently straightforward constitutional<br />
guarantee. Moreover, such a<br />
guarantee would operate only to limit<br />
government action. It would not affect<br />
actions by individuals. Racial discrimination,<br />
if it exists in a community, is the<br />
outward * manifestation of beliefs rooted in<br />
the hearts and minds of some men and<br />
women. I do not believe -that such beliefs<br />
are to be found on any significant scale<br />
in this country; but even if it were otherwise,<br />
I do not think the position could be<br />
remqedied in practice by a constitutional<br />
guarantee. Accordingly, the Government believes<br />
that the best course, the most effective<br />
course, for the Commonwealth to adopt<br />
is to seek the amendments proposed in<br />
the Bill. It proposes to submit -them at the<br />
same time as the referendum on the nexus<br />
provision-section 24 of the Constitution.<br />
I commend the Bill to the House.<br />
Debate ( on motion by Mr Whitiam)<br />
adjourned.<br />
