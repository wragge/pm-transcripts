PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF NEWS CONFERENCE, PARLIAMENT HOUSE, 13<br />
SEPTEMBER 1989<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
PM: I apologise for keeping you waiting. A couple of<br />
things that have just arisen. I just want to make a brief<br />
statement against the background of the written statement<br />
that you have.<br />
The first thing I want to say is that the situation that<br />
we're dealing with is one of a national emergency. The<br />
pilots and their Federation have created an abnormal<br />
situation and that requires the responses appropriate to<br />
such an abnormal situation. In this dispute the Government<br />
is absolutely determined to protect the national interest<br />
and the economic welfare of all Australians and in those<br />
circumstances we have had and continue to have no choice but<br />
to oppose and oppose completely to the blackmail and the<br />
destructive tactics of the Federation for however long it<br />
takes. Cabinet yesterday took a further step in a process which<br />
will guarantee the full restoration of domestic airline<br />
services. Australian pilots must now decide whether that's<br />
going to take place with them or witilput them. Obviously<br />
the Government would clearly prefer that pilots should<br />
rejoin the domestic airline system and that they should<br />
negotiate contracts with the airlines. If they do that,<br />
they then can in that way get reasonable increases in pay,<br />
associated with significant-increases in productivity and<br />
Australia can, in that way, retain their particular skills<br />
and experience. That's what we would prefer. Let me make<br />
it clear that if they continue to follow the wilful and<br />
greedy and destructive line of the Federation then those<br />
pilots should be under no illusion that Australia's domestic<br />
airline industry will in any event be fully restored and in<br />
those circumstances there will be no place in it for them.<br />
I repeat that the Government has the total resources,<br />
resolve and capacity to protect Australia's immediate and<br />
long term interests in this dispute and we will do precisely<br />
that. JOURNALIST: Prime minister, in the letter to James Strong<br />
yesterday from the Air Pilots Federation, they said they<br />
were willing to negotiate productivity and conditions and<br />
other matters. Do you see that as at least a basis for<br />
. talking-and negotiating and perhaps even bringing them back<br />
to the Ãµ uidelines? </p>
<p>PM: No, and for very clear reasons. Let me go through<br />
them. Firstly, there is no indication whatsoever in<br />
anything that's been said that the pilots, the Federation<br />
are prepared to negotiate within the system. Nothing that<br />
they've said indicates that they're prepared to negotiate<br />
within the system. Second point is that the Federation has<br />
now no nexus upon which to negotiate by. Their deliberate<br />
decision, their members have resigned their employment. The<br />
airlines have no employees who are members of the<br />
Federation. The third point is that all those pilots who<br />
have signed individual contracts with the two airlines have<br />
specifically made the point that their resigning is<br />
conditional upon the airlines having no dealings with the<br />
Federation, which given the intimidatory tactics that have<br />
been employed is not surprising on the part of those pilots.<br />
And of course the final point I would make is that given the<br />
action of the pilots to this point, what guarantee at all<br />
could you have that if that were to be done that in some<br />
months later the Federation wouldn't employ exactly the same<br />
tactics again. For those all those reasons compellingly<br />
lead to the conclusion I've put, yes.<br />
JOURNALIST: How will last night's Cabinet decision<br />
guarantee a full restoration, as you put it, of domestic<br />
services?<br />
PM4: Very simply. You will have seen from the statement,<br />
which I think you will agree is a pretty extensive<br />
statement, that the airlines and the Government and may I<br />
say in that sense particularly myself, have not been idle on<br />
this. I've been interested to see that we should be taking<br />
action to see that this matter is resolved. I've lost count<br />
of the number of hours that have beerr involved in doing<br />
precisely that. What has happened is that as of today<br />
something like 20% of capacity has been restored, by the<br />
beginning of next week, 25% will be restored and by the end<br />
0 of this month, something like 50% and action is now underway<br />
in the methods outlined in my statement to ensure that there<br />
will be a full restoration of the domestic airline industry.<br />
All the steps outlined in my statement which cover the<br />
signing of pilots previously employed, and may I say just<br />
today there has been another significant breakthrough in<br />
that the first time some senior route captains 737<br />
captains from the Federation have now signed contracts.<br />
So there will be an acceleration of the signing of people<br />
previously employed, so you've got that. You've got an<br />
acceleration of the provision of services by the RAAF. You<br />
have now an acceleration of the recruitment processes, not<br />
only in Australia but overseas, by the opening of joint<br />
offices by the two airlines in the United Kingdom and in the<br />
United States. You will have an accelerated training<br />
program so that more quickly you will have that critical<br />
mass of pilots available who will be able to ensure that all<br />
those who are signing up are able to be used. You will have<br />
. the bringing into Australia of additional aircraft from<br />
overseas and of additional pilots. Now all these things are<br />
calculated to ensure what must be done and that is the<br />
building up as soon as possible of the domestic airline </p>
<p>-3-<br />
( PM4 cont) industry to full strength. May I take the<br />
opportunity of hanging it on that question of making it<br />
clear that we understand the costs that are involved in<br />
having to take these courses of action and no-one needs to<br />
be very imaginative to understand those costs. Let me say<br />
in particular I am more conscious than most people of the<br />
costs in the tourism industry. What must be understood,<br />
what simply must be understood is this fact; that whatever<br />
these costs are, they are transient and minimal compared to<br />
the costs that this country would suffer if I was prepared<br />
and the Government was prepared to and the airlines were<br />
prepared to bow to the demands of the Federation because<br />
you all know that if that were to happen then the whole<br />
wages system would collapse and the economy would collapse<br />
with it. So it is not a question you have achieved<br />
nothing if you say, ' look at the costs, they are real,<br />
present costs'. But they are, as I say, minimal as compared<br />
with the absolutely uncontemplatible costs that would be<br />
associated with bowing to these pressures.<br />
JOURNALIST: inaudible<br />
PM: will you just excuse me. I want to make this point<br />
because I'll be making it later on at any rate so I may as<br />
well make the point in this context. It is to me and I hope<br />
to you somewhat fascinating to see in this context the<br />
latest offering of the Leader of the Opposition in a totally<br />
irrelevant press release from him today, there is included<br />
this remarkable passage. ' The Government seems prepared to<br />
go to any lengths to prop up a wages system which is in its<br />
death throes'. I ask you to compare and I ask the<br />
Australian people to compare that absurdity about a wages<br />
system being in its death throes. Now with the assessment<br />
made in today's Financial Review, I just read some of the<br />
passages from that assessment. ' I would like to report that<br />
the Hawke Government's wages accord is crumbling under the<br />
9 weight of the pilot's dispute. It would make a good story<br />
however, only mugs allocate their portfolios on the basis of<br />
good stories'. And may I interpolate by way of parenthesis<br />
and only mug Leaders of the opposition make such absurd<br />
statements. And then there follows the analysis of the<br />
achievements and current achievements of the accord and of<br />
the wages system, which is what this dispute is about now,<br />
an attack upon it on the one hand and our commitment to<br />
protect it. So let me point out just what it is that we're<br />
protecting. There's reference in the article to the<br />
historic threshold that has now been reached in terms of a<br />
massive restructuring of the Australian wages and industrial<br />
relations system under the accord. The elimination of<br />
hundreds of classifications, getting down to something like<br />
core skilled classifications, the basis upon which not<br />
only will there be a restructuring of the industrial system<br />
but the elimination of a basis of demarcation disputes and<br />
so on but the analysis properly goes further. It says this<br />
properly; that under the wage accord the ACTU has<br />
deliberately facilitated the biggest redistribution of </p>
<p>-4-<br />
( PM cont) national income from wages to profits for at least<br />
a generation. This fact seems to be conveniently forgotten<br />
by those who are now squawking for an abandonment of any<br />
centralised drain on aggregate labour costs. The accord has<br />
underwritten the corporate profit boom which is in turn<br />
funding the current surge in business investment. Now I've<br />
gone onto those points, my friends, because that is what<br />
this dispute is about. The Leader of the Opposition would<br />
dearly love to believe his own nonsense that the accord and<br />
the centralised wage fixing system is in its death throes.<br />
He would like to believe that that is the case. Indeed the<br />
pilot's dispute is centrally about destroying that system, a<br />
system which is as properly recorded here in today's<br />
financial Press has been responsible both for now reaching a<br />
situation where Australia at long last is able to have a<br />
totally restructured industrial relations system in which<br />
the award structure will be relevant to a modern industrial<br />
economy and will provide the basis for further improvement<br />
and in the process it has also, by the restraint of all<br />
Australian workers, allowed this massive shift of profits,<br />
which shift has been necessary to enable this massive boom<br />
in investment and under which one and a half million new<br />
jobs have been created. Now that's what this dispute is<br />
about and we are not going to allow a situation where a<br />
small, greedy, powerful group of already privileged people<br />
are going to smash that system. That is why I say this is a<br />
national emergency and that is why, from the outset, I have<br />
been utterly dedicated to ensuring that every resource of<br />
Government will be directed to ensuring that those massive<br />
gains for this country which have been achieved and which<br />
further gains are in prospect, are not going to be<br />
jeopardised. JOURNALIST: What areas Mr Hawke, of Government regulation<br />
will be looked at by the officials u and will that include<br />
any revision of the timetable for ending the two-airline<br />
policy? PM: Taking the last part of the question first, there is no<br />
question of revising that deadline, that comes into effect<br />
next year as you know, and all planning is being undertaken<br />
on that basis, there is no suggestion of changing that.<br />
What is involved there is this point; properly, very<br />
properly the CAA has ensured that as it deals with<br />
applications by the airlines for accelerated access of<br />
aircraft and of pilots, they should not in any way take any<br />
action which would jeopardise the safety situation of the<br />
airline industry in this country. They have been faced with<br />
what is for them a totally new situation and there has been<br />
some frustration on the part of both the airlines that<br />
things could've been done quicker. Now to the great credit<br />
of the CAA they have, as they've been handling these things<br />
as they arise, they have been able to accelerate the<br />
processes and that will be done. But I give the assurance<br />
on the -basis of the conversations that I was able to have<br />
yesterday with the acting head of the CAA, Mr Rainbird, that </p>
<p>( PM cont) nothing will be done at all in trying to<br />
accelerate these processes under the regulations which will<br />
in any way jeopardise the safety record of this country,<br />
which is something of which we all should be properly proud.<br />
JOURNALIST: You've just said that if need be Prime<br />
Minister, the airlines can be rebuilt without the bulk of<br />
the Pilots Federation members. Just how feasible is it for<br />
you to be saying that? I mean is that in fact possible and<br />
where do the pilots come from?<br />
PM: Yes, it is possible. Let me say Paul, my very clear<br />
expectation is that more and more of the previous employees<br />
of the airlines will in fact rejoin. There is already a<br />
significant number and as I say today there has been a very<br />
significant breakthrough in regard to senior route captains.<br />
I have no doubt that as the reality dawns upon members of<br />
the Federation, they will join. So I'm not avoiding your<br />
question but I'm simply making it clear to you that it is my<br />
clear expectation that a very significant number of previous<br />
employees will rejoin their previous employers under<br />
individually negotiated contracts. Having said that, the<br />
actions are in train to ensure that if you take the worse<br />
possible case scenario that on the basis of those who have<br />
already joined, that there will be an enrolment of people<br />
from two sources. One, there have been many applications<br />
from pilots within Australia who have previously flown for<br />
minor airlines and who would seek to become employees of the<br />
two major airlines. As part of that process there will be<br />
an acceleration of training programs to ensure that their<br />
skills can be upgraded so that they can be properly<br />
certified to fly with the major airlines, so that's one<br />
source. The second source of course if from overseas.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, can you explain this concept of a<br />
critical mass of pilots and can you say how soon you expect<br />
flights to be in the air with their normal crews?<br />
PM: The critical mass point is simply that if, given the<br />
structure of an aircraft operation, you have captains and<br />
you have junior pilots, and you have to have a proper number<br />
of senior pilots to ensure that you can maximise the use of<br />
junior pilots and it's in that sense you're talking about<br />
a critical mass you've got to have the proper mixture of<br />
people available to ensure that you're able to maximise the<br />
use of the total numbers that are available that's the<br />
essence there. Now the second part of your question was<br />
JOURNALIST: inaudible<br />
PM: Well I really have nothing to add to what's in the<br />
statement because I think that's a conservative expression<br />
of what's involved. I repeat that as of today with the<br />
aircraft of the major airlines now in the air that brings us<br />
. to what-I'm assured is 20% of capacity with the two America<br />
West aitcraft, which will come into operation at the </p>
<p>-6-<br />
( PM cont) beginning of next week, that will take it up to<br />
and as the statement says on the basis of the processes<br />
that are underway now and to which I have alluded, we should<br />
be boooking at 50% by the end of the month. I tend to<br />
believe that in fact you will get an acceleration of the<br />
process because I believe and I certainly hope that<br />
members of the Federation are going to change their<br />
position. In that sense, let me say not only to you Amanda,<br />
but I think it's relevant to all your consideration, that I<br />
think increasingly the members of the Federation are going<br />
to be asking themselves and they certainly should be<br />
asking themselves the very serious question about what<br />
this Federation has cost their members. And I just ask you<br />
to consider the list of things which the action of their<br />
leadership has cost their members. Firstly and obviously<br />
it's cost them their jobs because following the instruction<br />
of the leadership their members have resigned. So they have<br />
lost their jobs. Secondly and very importantly for them,<br />
they have lost their seniority in the operations of any<br />
airline system. The seniority of a pilot is very<br />
significant in terms of the conditions and the remuneration<br />
that they enjoy. So they have lost their jobs, they have<br />
lost their seniority. Thirdly, what they should<br />
increasingly have been considering is this; that they have<br />
lost any opportunity or right to redundancy payments. In a<br />
situation where the airlines, under what is happening now,<br />
will at the end of the process employ a significantly lesser<br />
number of pilots than they did at the beginning of the<br />
dispute. By their action the Federation, in getting their<br />
members to resign, have created a situation where previously<br />
in employment and with productivity negotiations, these<br />
pilots would've had an opportunity or a right for redundancy<br />
payments, that's gone because they are no longer in<br />
employment as a result of the Federatfion. So those three<br />
things they have lost, their jobs, their seniority and their<br />
rights to redundancy payments. Of course, finally, what<br />
they could've obtained if they had done what all other<br />
wage and salary earners have been prepared to do that is<br />
to operate within the system, they would've got a 6% plus<br />
wages increase on the basis of a very low number of hours<br />
flown per week. That has gone under the contracts that have<br />
been negotiated. Yes, they will get a 6% increase but it<br />
will be on the basis of a significantly greater number of<br />
hours flown. Hence the significant productivity increases.<br />
Hence the need for a significantly lesser number of pilots.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, because there's a degree of<br />
confusion about it, I wonder if you could just spell out<br />
what principles the Cabinet applied yesterday on this<br />
question of compensation?<br />
PM: Yes, sure. I appreciate that question very much<br />
because I think there has been a degree of misunderstanding<br />
about that, and I don't blame people for it. Let me make<br />
. the position quite clear. I preface it by making the point<br />
I did art the opening. That is that we are dealing with an </p>
<p>-7-<br />
( PM cont) emergency abnormal situation and in that<br />
emergency abnormal situation it not only requires but<br />
demands responses which are appropriate to that emergency<br />
abnormal situation. Now what are the facts? The facts are<br />
these; the dispute which is threatening the whole wages<br />
system and the economic welfare and the future of this<br />
country is in the airline industry. That's where the<br />
dispute is. In that reality the fact is that all of the<br />
other unions in the airline industry have assiduously and<br />
completely adhered to the principles of the wages system as<br />
is reflected in the article that I've read from and quoted<br />
from in today's financial Press. As a result of the<br />
restraint which has been exercised by those people,<br />
including those all of the employees other than the pilots<br />
in the airline industry there has been massive restraint<br />
in wages the other side of that coin of course by<br />
definition is that there has been a significant shift of<br />
profits and that significant shift of profits has allowed a<br />
rate of employment generation in this country which as you<br />
know is five times faster than under the previous<br />
government, more than twice as fast as the rest of the<br />
world, and is currently associated with an historically high<br />
level of investment. As a percentage of GDP investment is<br />
now 13.5%, the highest on record in our history. Now these<br />
people have been part of that process. They have seen, by<br />
their restraint, a shift from wages to profits which has<br />
brought the benefit from increased employment and a surge in<br />
investment. They are saying in their industry that they are<br />
not going to put up with a situation where a small group of<br />
fellow employees in that industry can wreak upon them a<br />
disadvantage by stand-down, now those are the realities<br />
which are understood and accepted. So in that situation the<br />
airlines, as distinct from the tourist industry which is the<br />
one which is consistently quoted, the airlines are suffering<br />
an additional cost. That is that whereas the tourism<br />
industry can and is standing down employees who can no<br />
longer be gainfully employed, that is not a course which is<br />
open to the airline industry. So the Government has<br />
decided, properly, that in those circumstances by a waiver<br />
of charges they will financially assist in a way which meets<br />
the equivalent of that specific cost unique to the airline<br />
industry. There is not a cent, not a single cent of<br />
Government money which will be going to the airline industry<br />
to compensate them for the sorts of losses that the tourism<br />
industry is suffering. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Following up question, firstly, why did<br />
you decide the use the waiver method rather than a pay out<br />
method? Secondly, will this apply retrospectively or from<br />
today to the accumulated costs of avoiding stand downs?<br />
PM.: Well, there are two points to be made about that. when<br />
the airlines raised this matter with us first and, as you<br />
know, I'm on record in the Parliament as having disclosed<br />
it was raised early, they indicated that they weren't<br />
putting this request to us in terms of the first week, they<br />
are beyond that first week. We believe that that's<br />
reasonable. The second point to make is this, that as a<br />
result of the understandings that have been reached between<br />
the airline industry and the ACTU, that many of the workers<br />
in the industry, indeed, I believe, a majority will, up<br />
until the 28th September, be taking leave in one form or<br />
another to which they are entitled or to which they are<br />
becoming entitled. So I think you can see that in terms of<br />
what the final amount will be, that I don't think it's going<br />
to be of the three figures type that some people have been<br />
anticipating. JOURNALIST: How much a week is it?<br />
PM: Well, by definition, one can't I mean, in terms of<br />
pay out the total amount and therefore how long it will go<br />
on will depend upon how long the dispute goes, by<br />
definition. The amount and as to what the amount they are<br />
losing, that is a matter of negotiation and, well,<br />
negotiation analysis currently between the airlines and<br />
ourselves. I mean, we're not taking the position where the<br />
airline says ' here's the figure' andwYe sign on the line.<br />
JOURNALIST: Is there some estimate?'<br />
PM: No. This is a negotiation, a discussion that's going<br />
on now. But<br />
JOURNALIST: Is it an open-ended cheque?<br />
PM: No it's not an open-ended cheque in this sense, that<br />
there will be the discussions between the Government and the<br />
airlines. As to what the amount is, you can't say what that<br />
is now, for two reasons. That discussion has to go on and,<br />
secondly, as to the final aggregate amount, it obviously, by<br />
definition, depends upon how long the dispute goes on.<br />
JOURNALIST: But surely you have some rough estimate per<br />
week, based on their wages bill from which you deduct people<br />
who are on holidays?<br />
PM: Yes. But what I'm saying is, if you'd listened to what<br />
I've said before, that what that amount is per week will be<br />
. a function in part of how many people now are in fact taking </p>
<p>-9-<br />
leave and that is not determined, that's part of what has to<br />
be analysed. So you can't, at this time, say precisely what<br />
the amount will be. I'm not trying, in any sense, to avoid<br />
the fact but these sums can be reasonably considerable.<br />
We've not avoided that fact.<br />
JOURNALIST: What is their wages bill per week?<br />
PM: I don't know what their wages bill is, but if you got<br />
to a situation where there was no leave offset, the sorts of<br />
figures that could be involved of the order of about $ 7<br />
million a week, $ 6 to $ 7 million a week for each airline.<br />
But that's in a situation where there is no offset in regard<br />
to people taking leave. So, Paul, just going back to your<br />
question, why I can't give you an answer at this stage is<br />
that I don't know, we don't know yet what the impact of the<br />
leave taking is and we don't know how long the dispute is<br />
going on. But, in regard to that question, which is, is it<br />
open-ended. The only way in which you can say, and it is<br />
open-ended in this sense, for as long as the dispute<br />
continues and there is this unique disadvantage, the<br />
airlines, which is the basis upon which this is taken into<br />
account, then the concept of financial assistance for that<br />
fact which is unique to the airlines will operate.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, given that this dispute is dragging<br />
on and looks set to drag on for some time yet, might you at<br />
any stage consider some sort of help for the tourism<br />
industry in a similar way to how you've dealt with the<br />
airlines? PM: Surely I've made it clear that there is no analogy<br />
between JOURNALIST: So it's out of the question totally?<br />
PM: Let me finish, I haven't finished my answer. There is<br />
no direct analogy between the airlines and the tourism<br />
industry. The dispute is in the airline industry and the<br />
airline operators have not available to them, for the<br />
reasons that you understand, they have not available to them<br />
the possibility of stand downs. Quite apart from that,<br />
there is also, as the statement makes quite clear, the need<br />
to ensure if you are going to be keeping any sort of service<br />
going on and building it up, that you have a situation where<br />
those who are required to service that are there. So the<br />
dispute is in the airline industry and they do not have, for<br />
the reasons that I've put, the opportunity of stand down<br />
which the tourism industry has. So there is no analogy<br />
there. Having said that, I'm conscious, very, very<br />
conscious indeed of the fact that under this Government<br />
tourism has been the spectacular growth industry. Let<br />
everyone, including those in the tourism industry, know that<br />
their prosperity has been very much a function of the<br />
success-of this Government's economic policies and which </p>
<p>success is foundationally based upon the wages system. So<br />
the tourism industry, as well as every other industry, has a<br />
vested interest in ensuring the continuing success of that<br />
system which, as I say, has been spelt out in today's<br />
Financial Review. The best interests, the best interests of<br />
the tourism industry and of the rest of the Australian<br />
economy, is that that system is maintained. Of course, in<br />
the present circumstances, the best interests of the tourism<br />
industry are in having at least some services and there are<br />
some services and they'll gradually be built up. But could<br />
I make one final point in regard to your question? I have<br />
agreed to meet a deputation from the tourist industry and I<br />
think I'll be meeting them tomorrow. I certainly want to<br />
hear from them and it is conceivable, and I can make no<br />
commitment about this, but it is conceivable that looking at<br />
the future after this dispute, there may be ways in which we<br />
can be of some assistance to the tourism industry in<br />
campaigns to explain the situation and to try and get the<br />
tourist industry back on to its growth path as quickly as<br />
possible. JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, your Government puts considerable<br />
emphasis on fairness, do you see any inherent unfairness in<br />
the fact that, say a cleaner from the airline industry has<br />
protection from being stood down, while a cleaner in the<br />
tourism industry loses his wage?<br />
PM: Well, I can understand from what you've written already<br />
that you have difficulty in beginning to understand the<br />
essence of this dispute, but let me, let me say this that<br />
if you can't understand that the welfare of the cleaner in<br />
every industry, the welfare of the cleaner's children, the<br />
welfare of the cleaner's parents, pensioners, if you don't<br />
understand that all their welfare depends foundationally<br />
* upon the success of the wages system and its continuation<br />
then I'm sorry if you don't understand that. You've got to<br />
look at alternatives. We have a situation, which I don't<br />
think's very difficult to comprehend, have a situation where<br />
there is an attempt to smash this system. If there were<br />
negotiation with, or if there had been accession to the<br />
demands of the pilots outside this wages system, then the<br />
wages system is destroyed. If the wages system is<br />
destroyed, then inflation becomes rampant. You would have a<br />
wages breakout which, as the statement says, would be beyond<br />
that of 1982. So to get some perception, if you don't want<br />
to get your mental processes fully going along it by using<br />
your imagination, have resort to history. What was the<br />
history in 19827 Precisely in 1982 you had a wages<br />
breakout. The centralised system was given away and you had<br />
the whole thing flowing outside the system. What happened<br />
then? You had the worst recession in Australia's history.<br />
You had 11 percent unemployment, you had double digit<br />
inflation, you had the worst recession in 50 years. The<br />
. cleaner, whether they were in the airline industry, the </p>
<p>-11-<br />
tourist industry or wherever, suffered. There weren't jobs<br />
for them. That is what is an issue. What has to be done at<br />
this time is to take the steps which I have said are<br />
abnormal. You have to take the steps in an abnormal<br />
situation, created by the pilots, you have to take the steps<br />
which are going to save the wages system which has produced<br />
all these benefits, benefits for everyone, cleaners wherever<br />
they are, in whatever job you have. The whole of Australia<br />
has been the obvious and massive beneficiary, as is spelt<br />
our here today, the obvious and massive beneficiary from<br />
this system. Its continued existence is an issue. There is<br />
only one way in which that system can be maintained and that<br />
is to ensure that this claim is not successful. That's the<br />
answer to your question.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, the attendants, are they<br />
covered by this<br />
PM: I beg your pardon?<br />
JOURNALIST: The attendants who have been stood down<br />
PM: Well, the attendants have negotiated a situation<br />
yesterday within the Commission in which their union and the<br />
ACTU as well as the Commission have been involved and they<br />
have chosen a particular course of action, which you will<br />
appreciate, which says well, they have this stand down<br />
situation, they seem to believe that for many of their<br />
members that they're able to get more money in a temporary<br />
way rather than just staying on and being on their base<br />
salary as they would be, if they were kept on, that they can<br />
do better by going out and getting other employment. So the<br />
situation there will be that for, the'principle will be the<br />
same. If for those who are in fact still remaining in<br />
employment and who may not be able to be employed but who<br />
haven't been stood down, the principle would apply. But<br />
they seem to have chosen to take a course of action which<br />
they regard as unique to their circumstances and I've<br />
noticed, although I've had no communication with or from the<br />
ACTU, I've noticed on the media that a spokesman for the<br />
ACTU has said that the agreement which they have with the<br />
airlines generally, which is the basis of what we're talking<br />
about, is not affected by that arrangement.<br />
JOURNALIST: Will the future benefits to the airlines of<br />
operating fewer pilots and increased presumably be<br />
accounted for in this compensation payment?<br />
PM: No, because, I'd hoped you'd understood before that, in<br />
this package that we have agreed to as a Cabinet, we are not<br />
making compensation for anything other than this factor of<br />
costs that they incur in not being able to stand down their<br />
employees. They are incurring, as the statement, I recall<br />
says, losses of around $ 20 million a week not taking that<br />
into account. Obviously when the airlines of this country </p>
<p>-12-<br />
resume normal operations then they will attract benefits<br />
from the significant increases in productivity. Let me make<br />
this point though in addition, that it would be our<br />
expectation that when the airline industry has utilised that<br />
productivity improvement after resumption to recoup<br />
themselves for their other losses, which are very<br />
significant. But once that's been done it would be our<br />
expectation that those continuing improvements would be<br />
shared with the air travelling public of this country.<br />
JOURNALIST: Will you seek to recompense, or get the money<br />
back for the taxpayers?<br />
PM: Beg your pardon?<br />
JOURNALIST: Will you seek to get the money back for the<br />
taxpayers. You know, half this money is going to a large<br />
private company which last year had spectacular profits and<br />
it's owned by two private companies which also have record<br />
profits. After the dispute's finished you conceded the<br />
profitability will be even higher. Why shouldn't the<br />
taxpayer ask for the money back?<br />
PM: Not a question of getting taxpayers' money back. What<br />
we're about here is a situation, as I've explained at some<br />
length before in answer to at least two previous questions,<br />
is to protect the whole Australian economy. It is an<br />
appropriate use of Government financial capacity, taxpayers'<br />
money, if you want to call it that, to protect the<br />
Australian economy. There can't be any argument<br />
JOURNALIST: ( inaudible)<br />
PM: Well, just a minute. I heard your question. I'm not<br />
in an argument, let me finish my answer to you. There can't<br />
be any argument from any reasonable person that what is<br />
being done is in the interests of the Australian economy as<br />
a whole. That is that we are going to protect the wages<br />
system and one which has produced all the benefits to which<br />
I have alluded. Everyone is the beneficiary of that, not<br />
just the two airlines involved or particularly the private<br />
airline involved. Everyone is the beneficiary. I repeat<br />
that it's our expectation that the benefit, the ongoing<br />
benefit which that company, together with Australian, gets<br />
from the outcome of this dispute in terms of productivity<br />
increases, it's our expectation that they will share that in<br />
terms of their fare structure. That's our expectation. In<br />
other words, they are not as a result of this decision<br />
getting, as I repeat, they're not getting one cent of<br />
taxpayers' money. Not one cent of taxpayers' money for the<br />
position which they share with the tourism industry and, you<br />
know, please get that in your head. They are unique in that<br />
they can't stand people down. That's what they're getting<br />
financial assistance for. In terms of the losses which they </p>
<p>-13-<br />
are suffering, apart from that the same sort of losses that<br />
are being suffered by the tourism industry, the airlines are<br />
not getting one cent of compensation. Now, I repeat, what<br />
our expectation is that when they do resume normal<br />
operations, that they will use the productivity benefits to<br />
recoup those losses which they've suffered and we will<br />
expect that after that the productivity improvements will be<br />
shared with the Australian public.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, my earlier question got a bit<br />
lost, or part of it. Why did you choose the waiver route<br />
rather than the pay out route? What are the advantages of<br />
doing it?<br />
PM: Well we do have available, uniquely, with the airlines<br />
S this system whereby a significant cost to the airlines are<br />
the charges that are imposed upon them by our<br />
instrumentalities, the CAA and the FAC. It's an appropriate<br />
way which, if you like, serves to make the point that I<br />
made, that I've made throughout this conference, about what<br />
is being done uniquely in regard to the circumstance of the<br />
airline industry, that we use what is uniquely available<br />
there. It should be, I think, there more readily understood<br />
the uniqueness of the situation. If you were making a<br />
payment to the airlines, it may more easily be seen or<br />
misrepesented as a compensation for overall losses. I hope<br />
that all of you understand that there is no distinction<br />
being made between the airlines and the tourist industry in<br />
terms of losses suffered.<br />
JOURNALIST: Is it not the case of the uniqueness of the<br />
position of the airlines is that the threat of industrial<br />
action by the airline unions and, therefore, is that a<br />
reasonable basis for the Government to be paying<br />
compensation to the airlines?<br />
PM: It's not simply the basis. It is the fact, as I spelt<br />
out at the beginning of this conference if that the<br />
dispute is in the airlines industry, it's not in the tourism<br />
industry, it's in the airline industry. You have a<br />
situation there where the other employees, yes, I've said<br />
I mean, that's not the first time it's been said, I mean, I<br />
said at the beginning of this conference and I've said it<br />
right through that the other unions representing all other<br />
employees in the airline industry have said, if they are<br />
going to have imposed upon them and their industry a<br />
significant penalty because a small group of their fellow<br />
employees are going to take this action and if there's a<br />
concession on that, then they would take the view it's<br />
alright for those other employees then they would take<br />
action. Now that is unique to the airline industry. That's<br />
where the problem is and we are not going to allow something<br />
to happen which is going to smash the wages system. There<br />
is no doubt, quite clear, if these other unions in the </p>
<p>-14-<br />
airline industry said ' well, we are being hit because of the<br />
action of other employees in this industry where we have<br />
consistently exercised restraint, we would then take action<br />
which would lead to the smashing of the system' and that is<br />
the position that has to be dealt with. That is the<br />
position with which we're<br />
JOURNALIST: But given the fact that you feel the subsidy is<br />
necessary to the airlines in this national emergency, why<br />
not require when the situation returns to normal, that they<br />
should repay the subsidy consolidated revenue?<br />
PM4: There's no, you've got the position where that is a<br />
loss which is unique. It's not something that they recover,<br />
that's something which is unique to them. It's not a<br />
situation which anyone else has got. This is no attempt, I<br />
repeat, this is no attempt and we wouldn't contemplate<br />
compensating the airlines for their general losses, the<br />
losses which have the common features with the tourism<br />
industry or anyone else that's suffered. This is a loss<br />
that they've suffered which is not recoverable. That is<br />
something that is dealt with. It's discreet, it's unique<br />
and it will be dealt with. I repeat, we are not going to be<br />
compensating them for general losses and we expect, as I<br />
say, that the benefits that they will ultimately get out of<br />
these arrangements will be shared, We will do what we can<br />
to ensure that that's the case.<br />
JOURNALIST: On a different note, I'm just wondering, what's<br />
your reaction to comments in the US, that Australia's going<br />
to cave in on its opposition to mining in the Antarctic?<br />
PM: Well, let me say they don't knoi what they're talking<br />
about, which is not surprising. Just-let me say on that<br />
point that it's reported that one Mr Scully, I think is his<br />
name, has deigned to know what the mind of my Government is<br />
on this issue. Well I've got news for Mr Scully. He's<br />
wrong and I will be contacting Senator Al Gore, the Chairman<br />
of the relevant committee to whom this statement was made,<br />
to assure him that Mr Scully has got it wrong.<br />
