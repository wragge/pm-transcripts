STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
CAIRNS JOBSKILLS PROJECT<br />
I am pleased to announce a $ 1.5 million project to train 135 unemployed North<br />
Queenslanders to meet skills shortages in the region's building industry.<br />
The plan Is the first Jobskills project In Australia to train unemployed people for<br />
the private sector construction industry.<br />
The continuing commercial construction boom in the region has resulted in a<br />
shortage of skilled workers In the domestic sector. This project, funded by the<br />
Federal Department of Employment, Education and Training's ( DEET)<br />
Jobskiils program, will give job seekers the skills and experience needed to be<br />
employed in the domestic construction industry.<br />
The Government's employment White Paper, Working Nation, has increased<br />
opportunities for training unemployed people to take up jobs in industries<br />
experiencing labour shortages.<br />
Trainees in the new North Queensland project will have six weeks training at<br />
TAFE followed by 20 weeks on-the-job work experience and training with local<br />
employers. This combination of on-the-job and formal training has proved<br />
highly successful in helping unemployed people back into the workforce.<br />
The Jobskills project was made possible through the cooperation of the<br />
Queensland Master Builders' Association, the Australian Workers' Union and<br />
the Federated Ironworkers' Association, with support from TAFE, Construction<br />
Training OLD and DEET.<br />
A full-time manager will be appointed to the project, supported by a<br />
Management Advisory Committee comprised of representatives from the<br />
Queensland Master Builders' Association, the AWU, TAFE, Construction<br />
Training Qld ( CTQ) and DEET.<br />
