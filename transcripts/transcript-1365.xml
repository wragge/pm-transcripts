FOR PRESS 70/ 1966<br />
FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE BY AUSTRALIA TO NEV ZEALAND<br />
Statement by the Prime inistZr. Mr. Harold Holt<br />
Following discussions with the Prime Minister of New Zealand<br />
( Mr. Holyoake) when he was in Australia last month, and discussions<br />
in Cabinet, ithas been arranged that the Reserve Bank of Australia<br />
will extend a credit of up to U20nto the Reserve Bank of New<br />
Zealand. The credit will help New Zealand in its present balance<br />
of payments difficulties.<br />
As additional facility of up to $ Al~ m. will be made available<br />
to the Reserve Bank of New Zealand on a stand-by basis.<br />
Drawings under these credits may be made during the current<br />
financial year 1966/ 67, and will help to finance New Zealand payments<br />
in Australia. Funds drawn by the Reserve Bank of New Zealand will be<br />
repayable by the end of 1971.<br />
The arrangement represents a further tangible expression of<br />
the close bonds between our two countries. For its part, the<br />
Australia Government is pleased to be associated with New Zealand<br />
in this way. We have growing obligations in the Pacific area, and<br />
we recognise the importance of assisting one another in dealing with<br />
our mutual problems.<br />
Background Note<br />
This is the second time Australia has provided direct balance<br />
of payments assistance to New Zealand in recent years. In 1958,<br />
a Central Bank credit of EAlOm. ( A2Om) was made available to New<br />
Zealand. Drawings on the credit will carry interest at 6% per annum. </p>
