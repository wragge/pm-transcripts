    <content><![CDATA[<p>I have much pleasure in announcing the visit to Australia from 6 toÂ 12 November of the Prime Minister of the Netherlands, Mr Wim Kok,Â and Mrs Kok. They will visit Sydney, Canberra and Melbourne.Â This first visit by a Dutch Prime Minister to Australia is an opportunityÂ to celebrate the longstanding and warm relationship between our twoÂ countries.</p>
<p>Our historical links with the Netherlands - dating back to the earlyÂ 17th century exploration of the Australian coast by Dutch marinersÂ - and the many Dutch people who have settled in Australia provideÂ a solid foundation for our modern relationship.Â </p>
<p>Australia and the Netherlands have much in common in our diverse andÂ tolerant societies and our open and liberalising economies. The commercialÂ relationship between our countries is strong, with the flow of Â investmentÂ in both directions a significant feature. Foreign direct investmentÂ in Australia from the Netherlands has almost trebled since 1985, makingÂ it the fourth largest holder of foreign direct investment in Australia.</p>
<p>I look forward to welcoming Mr Kok to Australia, and to the opportunityÂ to discuss our bilateral links and the advantages we can draw fromÂ our respective roles in the Asia-Pacific region and Europe.</p>
