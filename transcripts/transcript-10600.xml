    <content><![CDATA[<p>I have much pleasure in announcing the visit to Australia from 6 to 12 November of the Prime Minister of the Netherlands, Mr Wim Kok, and Mrs Kok. They will visit Sydney, Canberra and Melbourne. This first visit by a Dutch Prime Minister to Australia is an opportunity to celebrate the longstanding and warm relationship between our two countries.</p>
<p>Our historical links with the Netherlands - dating back to the early 17th century exploration of the Australian coast by Dutch mariners - and the many Dutch people who have settled in Australia provide a solid foundation for our modern relationship. </p>
<p>Australia and the Netherlands have much in common in our diverse and tolerant societies and our open and liberalising economies. The commercial relationship between our countries is strong, with the flow of  investment in both directions a significant feature. Foreign direct investment in Australia from the Netherlands has almost trebled since 1985, making it the fourth largest holder of foreign direct investment in Australia.</p>
<p>I look forward to welcoming Mr Kok to Australia, and to the opportunity to discuss our bilateral links and the advantages we can draw from our respective roles in the Asia-Pacific region and Europe.</p>
