<p>JONES:</p>
<p>On the line from Murwillumbah or somewhere near it, Prime Minister, good</p>
<p> morning.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Murwillumbah or somewhere near it will do Alan. Good morning how are</p>
<p> you?</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>Have you ever been where you are today?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I've been to Murwillumbah but I haven't stayed at this</p>
<p> very environmentally friendly place called tree-tops. I went for a walk</p>
<p> this morning. It's a great spot. It's a long way from where</p>
<p> I was yesterday morning in Dubbo but it has been quite an experience over</p>
<p> the past few days. I have listened a lot. I've learned a lot. I've</p>
<p> reinforced some views, I've modified and tempered others. People</p>
<p> are incredibly reasonable and sensible in their requests in the region</p>
<p> of Australia. In most cases they want a high quality of basic services,</p>
<p> they want to fix to the extent it is possible for the Government to provide</p>
<p> a reasonable participation in the general national economic prosperity</p>
<p> and as always country people are very courteous and friendly.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>Well, can I just ask you in relation to that before we talk about the</p>
<p> region per se, a fairly simple question : by what morality do we pay as</p>
<p> we did last financial year $50 million on illegal immigrants, $12 million</p>
<p> fighting legal actions brought by illegal immigrants, but textile workers</p>
<p> in regional New South Wales are left to whistle for what is rightfully</p>
<p> theirs.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, that's a fair question. Let me try and answer it. We are doing</p>
<p> our level best to avoid the need to pay all that money on illegal immigrants.</p>
<p> Since we came to power we have tried to strengthen the law to make it</p>
<p> less inviting to come to this country. Some of that cost Alan is involved</p>
<p> in - literally involved in apprehending people. Some of it is involved</p>
<p> in keeping them in detention. I don't want illegal immigrants coming</p>
<p> to this country. I've tried my level best as Prime Minister to tighten</p>
<p> the law. We were obstructed and frustrated by the Labor Party in the Senate</p>
<p> and the law would have been tightened long ago, and even more if it hadn't</p>
<p> been for their objection and obstruction. So I understand that but there</p>
<p> is a certain amount of unavoidable expense involved. Now, you get the</p>
<p> textile workers, we are still examining the details of that. I understand</p>
<p> their unhappiness. I think if I were in their shoes I would feel that</p>
<p> I was entitled to every last cent of that redundancy.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>And they are aren't they?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I can't argue against that and we've got to find an effective</p>
<p> and equitable way of dealing with that sort of problem. It is made even</p>
<p> more difficult when the people retrenched are in a regional area where</p>
<p> the employment prospects aren't as strong.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>I mean, it is a double whammy if no-one wants to come and live in the</p>
<p> place, they can't sell their house either.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Alan, I accept that. I think this is an example of where the process</p>
<p> of economic change is hurting people and ...</p>
<p> JONES:</p>
<p>Could I just ask you one other thing which is a simple thing. You can't</p>
<p> employ anyone, I can't, you can't as Prime Minister and you</p>
<p> are the most powerful man in the country. You can't employ anyone</p>
<p> without at law having to commit as part of that employment their entitlement</p>
<p> to four weeks' annual leave, annual leave loading, they pay super,</p>
<p> you pay super, they must have sick leave. So surely to God if the employer</p>
<p> is not made by law to put these benefits aside week by week, month by</p>
<p> month, and if the employer goes belly up, but what morality does the employer</p>
<p> go scott free and the employee is asked to pawn his personal effects to</p>
<p> survive?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Alan, in this particular case, and I'll come to that, I should point</p>
<p> out to your listeners that the workers are going to get paid their long</p>
<p> service leave and their sick leave and their superannuation. The entitlement,</p>
<p> or the benefit which is at risk or part of which is at risk without assistance</p>
<p> from another source is the redundancy payment. Now, the law, as I understand</p>
<p> it, does not require the redundancy payment to be separately put aside</p>
<p> and of course in the case of the redundancy you can have a worker who</p>
<p> is just about to retire and if he retires he doesn't get the redundancy</p>
<p> but if he is made redundant shortly before he retires, he does.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>But they are government laws?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>There is not a government law requiring..</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>.. the redundancy to be separate....</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>No but the government ordains their entitlement to redundancy, so if</p>
<p> the bottom line surely is...</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Alan in this particular case, and I'm not trying to avoid it, I'm</p>
<p> trying to answer it in detail, in this particular case the redundancy</p>
<p> does in fact arise from the enterprise bargain. There was an enterprise</p>
<p> agreement made, and the redundancies to which....</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>But at law they are entitled to enterprise bargaining aren't they?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>They are entitled to enterprise bargaining but the amount of the redundancy</p>
<p> is something that is subject to that, but Alan look, that is interesting</p>
<p> detail but your point about their entitlement I can't argue with</p>
<p> and ...</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>So if push turns to shove, shouldn't we as a community because you</p>
<p> talked about the other day when an article appeared under your name in</p>
<p> a paper and you talked about the need for a social coalition in this country</p>
<p> and you want a partnership of individuals, families, business, government,</p>
<p> you said welfare and charitable organisations  each contributing</p>
<p> their unique resources and expertise to tackle disadvantage at its source.</p>
<p> Now, if that is to mean anything we should all kick the can to make sure</p>
<p> these people don't miss out on anything.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I think it is a very strong argument.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>Could I just ask you then on the extension of that argument, because</p>
<p> it is textiles and I'll come to the rural thing but I'm sure</p>
<p> you've met this everywhere in regional Australia. Bill Clinton was</p>
<p> in Davos at the weekend telling the world about the benefits of free trade</p>
<p> and imports and we all agree about those things but his government is</p>
<p> still providing $8.7 billion to the American agricultural sector. Now</p>
<p> while-ever people are not prepared to play by the rules, why then do we</p>
<p> slavishly adhere to rules that the big fellas don't want to play</p>
<p> by?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, we don't have a situation of no protection in this country.</p>
<p> We still have significant levels of protection for the textile industry</p>
<p> and the motor car industry. I would be the last person to defend the consistency</p>
<p> of the Clinton administration's performance on trade matters after</p>
<p> what they did to us over lamb and we were not overly impressed with the</p>
<p> American position at the World Trade Organisation meeting in Seattle </p>
<p> I'll leave it at that.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>And you are being belted up over Howe Leather?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, of course, and that illustrates the inequity of the world trading</p>
<p> system...</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>For my listeners' benefit I should just say Howe Leather is a Victorian</p>
<p> leather company for which the government provided export assistance to</p>
<p> the tune of $22 billion. The WTO dispute mechanism has found against the</p>
<p> Commonwealth Government and directed the Government to retrieve that $22</p>
<p> million from Howe Leather or face punitive action.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>We'll continue to fight that as strongly as we can but it illustrates</p>
<p> the point that the world trading system is loaded against countries like</p>
<p> Australia and it is therefore very important that these sort of inconsistencies</p>
<p> be pointed out but in the long run because we are a trading nation we</p>
<p> still have more to gain from a more open world trading system than we</p>
<p> do from a closed one, and we are getting many of our agricultural exports</p>
<p> into the world markets. I, for example, was in Bourke two days ago, and</p>
<p> the cotton industry there is a huge success and a lot of that cotton is</p>
<p> being sold and in fact the great bulk of it is being sold overseas. A</p>
<p> lot of it is going to Asia. Some of it is going into Indonesia. Now, what</p>
<p> we have to understand is that if we close down this country against other's</p>
<p> exports then they will close their countries down against our exports.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>I wish that applied to European and American agriculture.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, the problem is it doesn't apply to that...it's been</p>
<p> our 30 or 40 year gripe and it continues to be ...</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>Just come back to Bourke. The cotton growers warned you against it. Just</p>
<p> coming back to Rutherford. Do I hear you that you will consider the prospect...see</p>
<p> these people face  I don't want to go on about this </p>
<p> but I'm more worried about, they are pawning their private effects,</p>
<p> they are sending kids to school, they may not be able to afford uniforms,</p>
<p> they can't afford the mortgage on their house. Is there an initiative</p>
<p> whereby you would say to the nation our collective well-being can't</p>
<p> obscure the need for theirs and we as taxpayers will meet their entitlements?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, Alan, let me leave it at this. The Government is looking at all</p>
<p> aspects of this. I understand the plight of these people - I do understand</p>
<p> that - and we are trying to find a way through it which is fair to them</p>
<p> but is also consistent with other obligations the Government has and also</p>
<p> recognises that there is some role in all of this for the private sector.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>Right. Bourke, just come back to Bourke, because the cotton growers warned</p>
<p> you there against reducing irrigation water from the Darling River. Now,</p>
<p> we know the Murray Darling system has a problem that has to be addressed</p>
<p> but you were told that proposals to cap irrigation water would threaten</p>
<p> the community's foundation in Bourke. Now, it was in Bourke, Prime</p>
<p> Minister, in 1996 and earlier that a nationwide campaign was launched</p>
<p> called the National Water Distribution Scheme. Elsewhere it's called</p>
<p> "drought proofing Australia". Now, we are not short of water</p>
<p> we are short of the whit and the will to preserve it and use it. You are</p>
<p> talking about infrastructure. Why not investigate a massive infrastructure</p>
<p> project to better use our water and water Australia?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I think that's good some merit. I think one of the points</p>
<p> that arises from that suggestion, Alan, is that that is the very sort</p>
<p> of thing that you might have a greater capacity to look at if there were</p>
<p> a suitable scheme and I'd stress that proviso. If the Government</p>
<p> weren't investing tens of billions of dollars in owning 50 per cent</p>
<p> of the telecommunications company and that's a point I've been</p>
<p> making as I've been going around the country. But the water problem</p>
<p> in Australia is not just a question of expenditure, it really is a question,</p>
<p> as you rightly said in your question, it really is a question of management.</p>
<p> It's not the scarcity of the resource it's the way in which</p>
<p> we use it.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>But can I just say to you on that - in Western Australia, for example,</p>
<p> in the Lake Argyle system in Western Australia it releases 50 tonnes of</p>
<p> water per second into the Ord River, 90 per cent of it is unwanted and</p>
<p> goes straight into the Timor Sea and yet productive areas of Australia</p>
<p> are savaged by a drought. Now, we have got a proposal to put a pipeline</p>
<p> from Papua New Guinea to Queensland, a $2.5 billion pipeline to pump gas</p>
<p> into Queensland, why can't we pump water into Queensland?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, that $2.5 billion is a private sector commitment.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>And I'm sure you'd get a private sector commitment to water</p>
<p> Australia.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, if there were an economic return on it and I'm not sure that</p>
<p> some of those projects there would be an economic return.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>But even from the Government's point of view if you could water</p>
<p> Australia and save money on drought relief you'd build revenue...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Alan, there is no more important, long-term resource management issue</p>
<p> in this country than water.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>Definitely.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>And one of the things that I, you know, clearly had reinforced to me</p>
<p> over the last few days is just how important this issue is, how difficult</p>
<p> it is, how much you can gain if you manage the resource intelligently.</p>
<p> And I think it's an issue that this country and all of the governments</p>
<p> of Australia working together not taking parochial State attitudes but</p>
<p> working together to find a common solution.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>But see if you have got water, if regional Australia is watered you don't</p>
<p> really have to worry about banks or Australia Post or car sales or dry</p>
<p> cleaners, they will be there because those areas will be viable and profitable.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes, that's true, that is absolutely true. And Bourke is a good</p>
<p> example because Bourke at one stage in its existence was in very difficult</p>
<p> economic circumstances. I am not suggesting that all its problems are</p>
<p> behind us but it's certainly a much stronger economy now and that</p>
<p> is largely but not totally due to the success of the cotton industry and</p>
<p> that is de to the...</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>Murray Darling.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes, the fortunate conjunction of natural circumstances.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>Absolutely. You have been to Kalgoorlie. Now, when you said it's</p>
<p> a difficult project I wonder what they were saying in 1897, when C.Y.O'Connor</p>
<p> said he'd build a pipeline from Perth to Kalgoorlie. 370 miles, he</p>
<p> built it in a matter of months. He was criticised it wouldn't work,</p>
<p> he was criticised it was a waste of money. The poor coot committed suicide</p>
<p> under the stress, that was in 1897. Surely to God we can do something</p>
<p> like that now?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, Alan, the answer to that in-principle is yes provided the national</p>
<p> benefit is clearly demonstrated. I mean, I can't, and I don't</p>
<p> think you want me in an interview like this to say yes or...</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>No, I am not.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I can't and I am not going to do that.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>I just wanted to lift up the priority list.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I think I have been doing that. I mean, what I have been doing</p>
<p> for almost a week now is raising a simple question, why should the taxpayers</p>
<p> of Australia invest tens of billions of dollars in a telecommunications</p>
<p> company rather than in all the sort of things you're are talking</p>
<p> about. Now, that's a very simple question.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>But you have heard from the farmer that he's not a whinger but he</p>
<p> knows that he can handle commodity prices, he can handle interest rates</p>
<p> but he can't handle the absence of water.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, I understand that and the point I am making...</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>See in New South Wales, Prime Minister...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Just hang on.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>Go on, go on, okay.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I mean, it's a question of priorities and I go back to the Telstra</p>
<p> point I was making. I mean, what is more important tens of billions of</p>
<p> dollars tied up in a telecommunications company or those tens of billions</p>
<p> of dollars in infrastructure investment? Now, I'll leave that to</p>
<p> you.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>All right, I take your point. Well, let's just take that a step</p>
<p> further. I am sure you are aware in New South Wales and Queensland, even</p>
<p> recently in the last year, stringent native vegetation laws are having</p>
<p> a real impact on the ability of farmers to use land for productive purposes.</p>
<p> Now, they have been imposed without any regard to their cost directly</p>
<p> o farmers and indirectly to the rest of the community. I mean, wouldn't</p>
<p> the Federal Government support an inquiry into the cost benefits of on-farm</p>
<p> conservation?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I haven't had that specifically put to me before but I will</p>
<p> have a look at that. I won't say yes or no on the run.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>Right. Just...I am wondering on the phone front, have you had any</p>
<p> feedback on the phone front?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, so far I haven't, we haven't sort of encountered any</p>
<p> difficulties. People say up here in northern New South Wales there are</p>
<p> a few problems. I am meeting a lot of community leaders today to explore</p>
<p> that. At the back of Bourke it was fine.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>Right. Well, I have got farmers from Dubbo telling me they can't</p>
<p> even get a mobile phone service at home.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, there are some areas, Alan, that didn't have the old analogue</p>
<p> service. Dubbo itself was covered by digital, it has been for some time</p>
<p> and I know there are some more base stations being put in out there. Look,</p>
<p> I am not representing to anybody that every part of the country is fully</p>
<p> covered by mobile telephones but it is getting progressively better and</p>
<p> it's one of those basic services that people are entitled to have.</p>
<p> But in the very remote areas the only way you can reach people, because</p>
<p> there are no base stations, the only way you can reach people is by satellite</p>
<p> and, of course, the cost of an individual satellite phone service is very</p>
<p> high. And clearly that is a different dimension from most of the rest</p>
<p> of the country where we are progressively extending either the digital</p>
<p> or maintaining the CDMA where analogue has been discontinued.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>Is it technically possible for you to turn the analogue signal back on</p>
<p> until the CDMA coverage is improved?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I think it's technically possible but the taxpayer would face</p>
<p> a big law suit from the mobile phone providers because the Keating Government</p>
<p> signed a contract guaranteeing that the analogue service would disappear</p>
<p> and we would be in breach of that contract. We had a look at that, we</p>
<p> had a look at that a couple of years ago and they wouldn't hesitate</p>
<p> to take the taxpayers to court I am sure. Well, it's understandable</p>
<p> they made a big investment on the strength of the contract that the former</p>
<p> Government entered into. I mean, you should remember that these analogue</p>
<p> phones have been turned off now because the former Government entered</p>
<p> into an agreement with the new companies, the companies providing the</p>
<p> new service, that they would discontinue the analogue. And, I mean, it's</p>
<p> because of that that they have invested in digital.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>One quick one before you go, one farmer said to you and I quote his words</p>
<p> "we have become the nation's nasties, we are clobbered called</p>
<p> for wrecking the environment, written off as a bunch of whinges, called</p>
<p> a lot of ignorant dickheads for voting no in the republic referendum."</p>
<p> What is your response to rural and regional Australia when they know that</p>
<p> that's the way some people perceive them?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, the Prime Minister doesn't conceive them in that way and nor</p>
<p> does the Government he leads.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>Good on you. Good to talk to you.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
