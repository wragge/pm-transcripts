PRIME MINISTER 132/ 95<br />
JOINT STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP,<br />
AND THE MINISTER FOR DEVELOPMENT CO-OPERATION, THE<br />
HON GORDON BILNEY MP<br />
VIETNAMESE BRIDGE PROJECT<br />
The Governments of Australia and Vietnam today announced their decision to<br />
proceed with the construction of a bridge across the Mekong River at My Thuan<br />
in southern Vietnam.<br />
The bridge, to be jointly funded by the two governments, is expected to cost<br />
approximately $ 83 million, with Australian contributions over four years<br />
expected to be over $ 55 million. It will be the Australian aid program's biggest<br />
ever infrastructure project.<br />
The decision is another important milestone in the growing partnership<br />
between Australia and Vietnam.<br />
The bridge will be the first across the Mekong in Vietnam and about<br />
2,000 kilometres downstream from the Austral ian-builIt Friendship Bridge linking<br />
Thailand and Laos. It will replace an existing ferry service which each day<br />
transports up to 22,500 people, 4,000 tonnes of freight and 5,000 passenger<br />
vehicles. The decision to proceed with the project follows the acceptance of a detailed<br />
feasibility study which covered a range of technical, economic, environmental,<br />
social and legal issues.<br />
The study found the bridge to be technically feasible, economically viable and<br />
likely to make a significant contribution to improving the living standards of<br />
people throughout the delta region of southern Vietnam.<br />
Construction of the bridge will boost the economic development of the whole<br />
Mekong delta region, which is constrained by the massive natural barrier to<br />
transport services of the various arms of the Mekong River. </p>
<p>For the 15 million people of the delta the bridge is intended to * bring quicker,<br />
easier and cheaper transport and higher returns for produce. It will also<br />
enhance access to hospitals, schools and other social services.<br />
The bridge will be built on Highway One, the main North-South road route in<br />
Vietnam and will facilitate transport of over half the rice grown in Vietnam to the<br />
major population centres around Ho Chi Minh City.<br />
The overall length of the bridge will be 1,360 metres, comprising a main bridge<br />
length of 640 metres and total approaches of 720 metres.<br />
The commitment to proceed with the bridge follows a statement of " in principle<br />
co-operation" signed during the visit of the General Secretary of the Communist<br />
Party of Vietnam, Mr Do Muoi, to Australia in July.<br />
The Minister for Development Co-operation, Gordon Bilney, and the visiting<br />
Vietnamese Minister for Transport and Communications, Dr Bui Danh Luu,<br />
today signed a Memorandum of Understanding for the detailed design phase of<br />
the bridge.<br />
The My Thuan bridge is part of a balanced development co-operation program<br />
with Vietnam, which targets four main sectors, as well as a range of NGO<br />
projects which focus directly on poverty. Apart from infrastructure the<br />
Australian aid program has substantial projects in health, natural resource<br />
development, and education.<br />
Construction of the bridge is expected to begin in June 1997 and finish towards<br />
the end of 2000.<br />
