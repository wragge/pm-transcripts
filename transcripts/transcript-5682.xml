FOR MEDIA SATURDAY, 7 NOVEMBER 1981<br />
ADDRESS AT THE OPENING OF A NEW HYDROTIIERAPEUTIC COMPLEX<br />
MINDA HOME, ADELAIDE<br />
I am very pleased to be here with you today for the opening<br />
of Minda's newest facility, this splendid hydrotherapeutic<br />
complex. The work of Minda is well-klown as is its determination to improve<br />
the condition and lives of disabled people. tMinda has a<br />
long history of service in this field. I believe it was<br />
originally established in the 1990' s. Thi new facility will<br />
offer those who come to Minda for help both new therapeutic<br />
opportunities and an avenue for recreation where their<br />
participation may have been limited in the past.<br />
The Commonwealth Government is, of course, very much aware of<br />
the work of Minda and we have welcom ed the opportunity to<br />
provide financial support for this project. The initiative<br />
and the drive in these matters is of course your own, arid it is<br />
because we regard such dedication and enthusiasm as one of this<br />
country's greatest resources that we have made help available.<br />
Since 1976 the Commonwealth Government has provided over<br />
$ 12 million towards the costs of providing services at Minda.<br />
and I think you will agree that this represents a sizeable<br />
commitment towards the welfare of disabled people. We hope<br />
that this support for your efforts to provide more effective<br />
services will improve the opportunities for personal development<br />
of our disabled citizens. The Government believes that people<br />
in the community such as yourselves generally know best the<br />
kind of services that are needed, and are frequently the best<br />
placed to operate these services.<br />
1981 is of course the International Year of Disabled Persons.<br />
Only a decade or so ago, the idea of having such a year would<br />
have been unthinkable. Vle now recognise that disabled persons<br />
have a contribution to make to the life of the world. Remarkable<br />
changes have occurred in community attitudes in a comparatively<br />
short time. Of course there is still far to go.<br />
Sometimes people find it difficult to appreciate the needs of<br />
the handicapped persorn. John Hickman in his book " One Step at<br />
a Time" tells a story about the 1972 election which illustrates<br />
this very point. / 2 </p>
<p>When Mr Hickman was going to cast his vote in the 1972 Federal<br />
elections, he spoke to the Returning Officer.<br />
" Good afternoon. My name is John Hickman and I'd like to cast<br />
my vote for the election"<br />
" Certainly, sir, I'll get you the forms and a ballot paper and<br />
you can fill them out at once".<br />
" Yes, well that is fine but I can't write you see. That is why<br />
I brought a friend", I said, indicating my companion. I %.. as<br />
hoping that it would be all right for him to fill-out the<br />
ballot paper under my instructions.<br />
" Oh, that makes things a little complicated. You cannot even<br />
write down the numbers in the ballot boxes".<br />
" Not-in any recognisable form I am afraid".<br />
The official disappeared and came back a few moments later bearing<br />
a sheaf of forms.<br />
" That is quite all right sir, your friend can fill in your ballot<br />
paper in accordance with your instructions and all you have to<br />
do is to sign this statement on this form declaring that you<br />
cannot write".<br />
I am confident that the activities 6f this year will be a<br />
worthwhile contribution in helping to achieve more understandingand<br />
practical responses to handicapped people and in removing<br />
the old ideas and myths. This year has served to concentrate<br />
attention on future directions in services for handicapped<br />
people. There is growing suport for less paternalistic or protective services<br />
for disabled people, for a greater measure of control over their<br />
own lives, and for freedom to pursue thei~ r own Jives and interests<br />
in surroundings as normal as possible. The need to consider<br />
such philosophies of care places a heavy<br />
responsibility on organisations such as yours, in deciding how<br />
best you can serve the needs of disabled people. Minda has<br />
provided a lead in this debate, in sponsoring workshops to<br />
discuss normalisation of services.<br />
The Government believes that disabled people should be encouraqed<br />
to develop their capacities to the fullest possible extent; that<br />
they should be enabled where possible and desirable, to live with<br />
their families in the community and to use cormmunity facilities<br />
as do the rest of us. Many disabled people are already living<br />
their own lives, more or less independently, in a way which no-one<br />
would have believed possibl. e only a few years ago.<br />
Today, we recoginise that society has thouight too long only of<br />
people'Is disabilities, not of their potential for all levels of<br />
skills : both society,* and disabled people, have lost as a result.<br />
Today we want to see disabled people being encouraged to take on<br />
and cope with the tasks of everyday living to the fullest extent<br />
of their abilities. D Iisabled people need the opportunity, where </p>
<p>they so wish, to live independently or with support in the<br />
community, and have the maximum freedom of choice over their<br />
style of living, regardless of where they may live.<br />
Australia has supported the U. N. Declaration on the rights of<br />
disabled people, and I would like to read to you one paragraph<br />
which exemplifies our goal in ensuring that disabled people<br />
enjoy the same opportunities for a meaningful home life, the<br />
same choices, as other Australians.<br />
" Disabled persons have the right to live with their families<br />
or with foster parents and to participate in all social,<br />
creative or recreational activities. No disabled person shall.<br />
be subjected, as far as his or her residence is concerned, to<br />
differential treatment other than that required by his or her<br />
condition or by the improvement which he or she may derive<br />
therefrom. If the stay of a disabled person in a specialised<br />
establishment is indispensable, the environment and living<br />
conditions therein shall be as close as possible to those of<br />
the normal life of a person or his or her age".<br />
We recognise of course that there is no simple or single<br />
response to the needs of handicapped people. People with<br />
disabilities need a wide variety in facilities and services,<br />
ranging on the one hand from intensive nursing care for the aged<br />
or the very profoundly handicapped, to completely independent<br />
living arrangements with support services-as may be necessary.<br />
Many disabled people, particularly the older people, may not<br />
feel capable of overcoming the obstacles posed by everyday life,<br />
and that right of choice should be respected. The question which<br />
is faced by all those concerned with providing facilities for<br />
the disabled is now to ensure that their facilities are geared<br />
to operate with sensitivity to the needs of those who use them.<br />
We have to bear in mind the importance of acknowledging individual<br />
needs and facilitating choice. We need to provide a range of<br />
options for handicapped people, so that they can, for themselves<br />
exercise the maximum freedom of choice. We need to provide an<br />
environment which recognises the right to maximum personal<br />
development, regardless of whether the bricks represent a big<br />
institution, or the average family home.<br />
I understand that you at Minda, are experimenting with a<br />
number of new approaches. I applaud these efforts and initiative.<br />
Your programme of independent living hostels, such as those at<br />
Mile End and Goodwood, is an example of what can be achieved<br />
in encouraging disabled people to live and work in the comnmunity.<br />
I understand. you are considering a pilot progranmie which will<br />
place handicapped children with foster parents with appropriate<br />
support, and I am informed that the Department of Social Security<br />
is simpathetically considering the possibility of assistance for<br />
this project. At Craigburn you are e-xpanding the training and<br />
independent living oppor~ unities and I am pleased that we will<br />
be able to provide assistance next year with accommrodation and<br />
other costs. </p>
<p>9, 4.<br />
I particularly applaud your " respite" scheme, which provides<br />
short term care for anyone with the care* of a handicapped child..<br />
The benefit of this kind of scheme cannot be over-estimated, in'<br />
supporting the large body of devoted parents who are bringing<br />
up their child within the family. This facility will help those<br />
who use it to grow in confidence and will encourage them to<br />
participate as full members of society.<br />
It will give further substance to the theme chosen by the<br />
United Nations for the International Year of the Disabled<br />
" Full Participation and Equality".<br />
And after this special year, there will be need for consolidation<br />
of the gains that have been made, and an appraisal of further<br />
directions and further gains which need to be pursued in the<br />
years ahead. Minda's projects and programmes demonstrate what<br />
can be done when members of the community, with dedication,<br />
initiative and energy address the problems confronting us . n<br />
the forthright manner that you have done.<br />
The Government is pleased to have been able to assist Minda along<br />
the way and I am confident that Minda will continue to be an<br />
outstanding example of co-operation between community and<br />
government. I thank you for the opportILunity to be here today<br />
to declare the hydrotherapeutic pool open, and I have much<br />
pleasure in declaring it officially open.<br />
