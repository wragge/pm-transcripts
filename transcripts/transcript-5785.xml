AS DELIVERED " 14&gt; 2&gt; 1 AL&amp;<br />
PRIME MINISTER1<br />
FOR MEDIA TUESDAY, 30 MARCH 1982.<br />
ADDRESS TC) PARLIAMENTARY LUNCHEON FOR THE KING OF SWEDEN<br />
on behalf ol: the Australian Government and the Australian<br />
Parliament and people, I extend to Your Majesty, Princess<br />
Christina arid the -distinguished members of your party a very<br />
warm welcome to Australia, very warm welcome to Canberra. We<br />
hope that you enjoy your time here, and that you will come back, again.<br />
our two countries are-at opposite points of the Earth. Yet<br />
the links between us are strong and go back to the earliest<br />
period of European settlement of Australia,<br />
Travelling with Captain James Cook on his first voyage to<br />
Australia in 1770 was a Swedish botanist Daniel Solanderwho<br />
was Joseph Banks' chief assistant.<br />
our modern association is nourished by the presence of many<br />
people fromt Swedeni who-have with their descendants contributed<br />
sb' much to the vitality of Australian society. The Swedish camunity<br />
here has contributed a very great deal indeed in the development of our<br />
taste for quality in everyday things and to our culture as a<br />
whole.-<br />
We have a living link too, in the commercial relationship<br />
which has . always been a strong one. Looking to the future,<br />
each country can expect the other to be a secure and reliable<br />
economic partner. The Nuclear Safeguards Agreement now in force<br />
opens the way to a-further development of our economic<br />
relationship when Swedish purchases of Australian uranium<br />
get under vway. It can be no coincidence therefore that your<br />
party includes your distinguished Minister for Industry, Mr<br />
Asling, and. that y6ur program includes visits to the NSW<br />
coalfields and to the large natural resources projects in<br />
Western Australia. Indeed Your Majesty, in a short tinre you will<br />
be seeing a great deal of Austalia.<br />
Your visit is welcome for all these reasons, and not the<br />
least because you personally have been able to accept our<br />
invitation., you succeeded your grandfather at the young / 2 </p>
<p>2<br />
age of 27 after periods in the Swedish Navy and in Sweden's<br />
diplomatic service. You obtained practical experience of<br />
international commerce and banking in the United Kingdom.<br />
This background has placed you in a strong position to<br />
promote Sweden's international economic interests, a task<br />
which I know is high on your agenda for this state visit.<br />
It is a pity that your time does not allow you to pursue<br />
your scuba-diving and boating interests on the Great Barrier<br />
Reef, but perhaps that is something which will enable us to<br />
entice you back at some time in the future.<br />
While we are delighted to have you with us, Your Majesty,<br />
we are sorry not also to be able to welcome Her Majesty<br />
Queen Silvia. As Queen Silvia is expecting her third child<br />
not long after your return to Sweden her inability to make the<br />
journey here is for the best reasons, as most Australians<br />
are very ready to understand. This year, 1982, is going to<br />
be remembered for the arrival of royal children. Your visit<br />
will make it possible for you to take home personally our best<br />
wishes for the happy event later this year.<br />
As Crown Prince, you visited Sydney<br />
and Fremantle in 1967 as d cadet on a Swedish naval training<br />
ship. Certainly the comparisons you can make with your<br />
earlier visit will gi\ ve you the measure of the change and<br />
development which has-occurred in Australia in the intervening<br />
years. You will see many signs of this change, as you make<br />
contact with various parts of our country during the next week.<br />
Economic achievements are the attributes of our two nations<br />
which b; 7r the most visible resemblance.<br />
There are, however, other more important things we have in common.<br />
Despite differences in our history, and vast differences in<br />
our geography and regional environments, we have developed<br />
a number of similar values and have expressed them in similar<br />
political structures. Australia and Sweden share a fundamental<br />
commitment to the democratic process and to the rights,<br />
freedoms arid well-being of all ocpeople, no : atter who they are<br />
or what they are. Swedes and Australians hold these values to<br />
be the basic purpose of their states.<br />
Internationally, we are eachstrongly committed to making the<br />
necessary sacrifices to protect this way of life. The<br />
foreign poLicies of our two countries may diverge as to<br />
the means seen to be necessary to rprotect these values, but our<br />
goals are the same. Your country has a policy of neutrality<br />
while ours is one of alliance with the United States and other allies.<br />
The option Sweden has chosen is not an easy one. It has<br />
involved your country in very significant defence costs.<br />
Measured in dollars per head of population your country's<br />
commitment to defence is the third highest in Western Europe.<br />
You are obviously determined to protect your right to neutrality. / 3 </p>
<p>-3<br />
The objective of self-sufficiency has entailed universal<br />
national service for Sweden and the channelling of investment<br />
into a substantial defence industry. And Sweden's neutrality<br />
is not a neutrality of silence arid withdrawal. Your<br />
country has participated actively in the United flations<br />
peacekeeping operations and by very spirited and active diplomacy.<br />
Sweden has stood up for the extension of human rights and<br />
championed the campaign against racism. Your country was<br />
among the fir'st of the developed nations to recognise the<br />
enormous importance of international development assistance<br />
in overcoming the poverty of the Third World. Your country<br />
has originated some of the most significant innovations<br />
in peace research, and through the Nobel Foundation has<br />
internationalised intellectual achievement and man's knowledge<br />
of himself.<br />
Australia has been able to co-operate closely with Sweden<br />
in many of these spheres. We have worked together particularly<br />
well in international arms control efforts, including those<br />
aimed at preventing the spread of nuclear weapons.<br />
But no country, least of all middle<br />
powers such as Australia and Sweden, can avoid the responsibility<br />
of looking beyond their immediate regions to the world as a<br />
whole. Only half a decade ago the vision before us seemed<br />
generally bEnign. It was a world in which East/ West tensions<br />
were at a law ebb; in which arms control negotiations held out<br />
some prospect of a significant slowing of the arms race; in<br />
which ongoin~ g economic growth seemed substantially attainable.<br />
There was art air of optimism despite serious problems such as<br />
oil prices; there was a feeling that the future was manageable<br />
and that it was bound to keep on being better than the past.<br />
Now, however, we look out at an increasingly troubled and<br />
uncertain wcorld scene. The economic situation in the<br />
industrialised countries is plainly a cause of serious concern.<br />
Economic growth has slowed markedly, indeed, OECD estimates for<br />
1981 indicate a fall of 2% for the United Kingdom and 1% for<br />
the Federal. Republic of* Germany. Even when the performances<br />
of France an~ d Italy were added, the average growth of the<br />
four major European economies last year was a minusquantity.<br />
Economic stagnation, the tenacity of high inflation and the<br />
continuing h'igh levels of unemployment are threatening to<br />
overturn thE! expectation of constantly improving living<br />
standards which has underpinned the buoyancy of mood of the<br />
post-war generations. There is an urgent need for solutions<br />
to be found for these problems, and obviously their consequence<br />
for the well-being of our peoples goes further than living<br />
standards. For the adverse economic conditions in western<br />
countries make it so much more difficult for their leaders<br />
to deal with. the strategic dangers arising out of the present<br />
state of East-West relations. ./ 4 </p>
<p>-4<br />
The dangerous; deterioration in East-West relationships is<br />
another feature of the world scene which has become evident in<br />
recent years.<br />
Whatever one' s views on the effectiveness and realism of some<br />
of the policies of detente which commanded great support in<br />
the 1960s and 1970s, it is now clear that the international<br />
behaviour of the Soviet Union is posing a fundamental challenge<br />
to democracie! s. The background of that sketch is<br />
something that we should all ponder and see how we<br />
should address ourselves to the difficulties. It is beyond<br />
doubt that the Soviet Union's guidelines for its international<br />
dealings are no different to the rule that applies for dealing<br />
with people living within its own boundaries. That also<br />
is not a particular cause for optimism.<br />
A further consequence of the uncertainties which have arisen<br />
recently is aL faltering in the momentum towards a serious<br />
and comprehensive dialogue between the countries of the<br />
industrialised North and the developing South. Because both<br />
our countries have worked so hard on economic development<br />
issues over past years, any failure by the international<br />
community to address these matters adequately would come as<br />
a particularly bitter blow.<br />
Sweden and Australia working together with countries which<br />
share many similar values, must maintain our efforts to<br />
restore confidence about the world climate which is lackinq<br />
now. We must. work to re-establish discussion -on<br />
these issues otherwise there is going to be a great deal of<br />
unhappiness a~ nd great deal of disillusion amongst many,<br />
many families; indeed. We must not lose sight of the<br />
major asset which healthy relations between our countries<br />
bring to this task. Your visit here Your Majesty is certainly<br />
going to assist in this. We welcome very much the fact<br />
that you have! come to visit us. I am confident that<br />
your visit to Australia will mark the maturing of such a<br />
relationship between Sweden and this country and make that<br />
realtionship hold great promise for the future. </p>
