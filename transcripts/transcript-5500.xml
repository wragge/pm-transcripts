COMMUTATION OF DEATH SENTENCE OF KIM DAE JUNG<br />
The Government welcomes the decision to commute the sentence<br />
of death imposed by a military court on 17 September on the<br />
Korean opposition leader Mr Kim Dae Jung.<br />
In urging clemency for Mr Kim I had. made-" clear to the ROK<br />
the deep concern of the Australian Government, the<br />
rarllament, Church leaders, businessmen and of the Australian<br />
community in general.<br />
We value the decision that has been taken. Had Mr Kim been<br />
executed this would clearly have been an obstacle to the<br />
continued growth and development of. our relationship with<br />
the ROK.<br />
The new ROK Government has proposed many great changes to<br />
the political, social and economic structure of the country.<br />
We wish President Chun well in these endeavours and express<br />
the hop-that further Steps taken may broaden national and<br />
international respect and support for his Government.<br />
