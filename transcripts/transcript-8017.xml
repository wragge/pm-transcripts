PRIME MINISTER<br />
CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY EMBARGOED UJNTIL. DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
ENVIRONMENT 1990 CONFERENCE<br />
SYDNEY 2 MAY 1990<br />
Mr Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen,<br />
All elements of the Australian community must be involved in<br />
this vital task for the 1990s: developing the strategies<br />
for safeguarding the environment that our children will<br />
inherit and demanding of government at all levels, of<br />
industry and of interest groups that those strategies be<br />
implemented. This conference, bringing together a diverse group drawn<br />
from industry, government, conservation groups and academia,<br />
is a valuable contribution to the consideration of these<br />
important questions, and I am grateful for your invitation<br />
to address you this morning.<br />
The range of topics to be addressed at this conference<br />
clearly demonstrates how pervasive environmental<br />
considerations have become. It highlights the stark fact<br />
that the environment has never been more prominent in the<br />
public mind than it is today. It highlights too the range<br />
of pressures that will be exerted on, and opportunities that<br />
will be available to, the Australian business community, as<br />
it responds to this critical issue.<br />
To an outsider it might seem that the community debate about<br />
the future of Australia is being conducted in two entirely<br />
different languages. One language is the language of<br />
aesthetics this is the language spoken by some who regard<br />
preservation of the environment as a totally overriding and<br />
inflexible goal. The other language is spoken by some<br />
industrialists. In this hardheaded language, natural<br />
resource development is seen as the lone goal, bringing with<br />
i-t-a-be~ n-ess-number-of---jobs---afd-easy--solut-ions to<br />
Australia' s economic difficulties.<br />
As in the tower of Babel, the proliferation of languages<br />
does not improve the level of communication between human<br />
beings. It impedes constructive dialogue and handicaps<br />
those who wish to develop workable solutions. </p>
<p>If Australians were to conduct a debate on these issues in<br />
such uncompromising terms, we would make no progress. We<br />
would simply talk past one another; we would not in fact<br />
have real debate at all but merely assertion, antagonism and<br />
name calling. The real question is not, which of the two<br />
languages must we speak? But, how do we translate the best<br />
concepts of both languages into a new language that we can<br />
all understand and that will break through deadlocks in the<br />
resolution of environmental and development issues.<br />
The name of that new language of course is ecologically<br />
sustainable development.<br />
For its part, my Government has never accepted a dichotomy<br />
between economy and ecology. Economic development is<br />
sustainable in the long term only if it is environmentally<br />
sustainable. My Government has succeeded both in creating<br />
jobs at a rate twice as fast as the rest of the western<br />
world and in preserving the environment to such an extent<br />
that the World Heritage Bureau has acknowledged Australia as<br />
having done more to promote world heritage values than any<br />
other country.<br />
So it can be done: economy and ecology can be made to go<br />
hand in hand. But for Australia the job is far from<br />
complete. It is time to move to the next stage.<br />
One of the principal tasks facing my-Government, as it<br />
enters its fourth term in office a task that confronts the<br />
entire Australian community as it enters the 1990s is the<br />
challenge of turning the principle of sustainable<br />
development into practical policies for each major industry<br />
sector. We want sustainable development to be not merely a<br />
concept, but a recipe for decision making.<br />
Certainly, the community will sometimes be faced with a<br />
stark choice between the development of, say, a mineral<br />
resource and the preservation of a pristine wilderness area.<br />
The notion of multiple land use is not applicable in all<br />
instances. But often the task will be one of ensuring that<br />
development activities are managed in such a way as not to<br />
cause irreparable or unacceptable damage to the surrounding<br />
environment. Sustainable development must start from the proposition that<br />
our environmental assets need to be looked after and<br />
mdintained in much the same way as we care for and invest in<br />
othc-assets-that sustainandenhance_ our productive<br />
capacity for the future. In that sense, good environmental<br />
management means sound economic management.<br />
Environmental considerations must be fully integrated into<br />
our decision making. </p>
<p>It is essential that business, along with other interest<br />
groups and governments, are all involved in the task of<br />
identifying problems and developing solutions to overcome<br />
them. I have therefore asked State Governments and<br />
industry, union and environmental interest groups to work<br />
with us in the formulation of a sustainable development<br />
strategy. The first step is the preparation of a discussion paper on<br />
the concept of sustainable development. Once that concept<br />
has been well articulated and the key principles identified,<br />
I propose to establish working groups to translate these<br />
findings into practical policies for particular industry<br />
sectors. It will be vital for the success of this process<br />
that industry and other key interest groups participate<br />
fully in the development of these strategies. The<br />
Commonwealth's part in the formulation of a sustainable<br />
development strategy will be over-sighted by a special new<br />
Cabinet sub-committee on sustainable development.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen,<br />
Most of the issues which you will be considering over the<br />
next three days indeed, most of the problems that we are<br />
facing are also being experienced in other countries.<br />
Success in dealing with our national problems will mean that<br />
we are well placed to assist others. We have already<br />
increased the environmental component of our aid program.<br />
And there could also be significant export opportunities to<br />
be grasped for those in the vanguard of developing new<br />
products and more environmentally benign technology.<br />
There are, however, other problems that are global in scope<br />
and which cannot be solved by any one country acting alone.<br />
Their very nature demands a co-operative and co-ordinated<br />
international effort. It is an extraordinary mark of the<br />
increased public consciousness of previously arcane<br />
scientific issues that these problems are now familiar to us<br />
all especially the greenhouse effect and depletion of the<br />
ozone layer. And it is an extraordinary mark of the<br />
modernisation of Australia's foreign policy objectives as we<br />
enter the 1990s that Australia is now playing a leading role<br />
in international efforts to deal with these problems. We<br />
shall continue to do so.<br />
We will continue to work hard for an international<br />
convention on climate change that will bind all countries to<br />
a -program-of -reduc-ing.. greenhouse. gas emi ss ions.<br />
At the same time we must ensure that Australia continues to<br />
be at the forefront of world responses to this problem. A<br />
special working group has been set up at my direction to<br />
examine options for reducing greenhouse gas emissions in<br />
Australia. Its preliminary report was released at the end<br />
of 1989 for public comment. </p>
<p>We will be continuing to support a greenhouse research<br />
program to improve our knowledge of the atmospheric changes<br />
taking place and of their likely impact. Over the next<br />
three years we will be providing funding of at least $ 5.7<br />
million per year for this purpose.<br />
Australia has also taken a strong stand in response to the<br />
threat to the ozone layer. Under the Montreal Protocol,<br />
Australia is required to have reduced consumption of ozone<br />
depleting substances by 50 per cent by 1998. In fact, under<br />
our Strategy for Ozone Protection, developed after extensive<br />
consultation with industry, unions and public interest<br />
groups, we will have achieved a reduction of 95 per cent by<br />
1995 and a complete phase-out by 1998.<br />
The greenhouse effect and the hole in the ozone layer are<br />
matters which could affect all Australians directly and<br />
profoundly. Our interest in promoting international action<br />
to deal with this is clear. My Government is also very<br />
conscious of our responsibility to act on other<br />
international issues even though the benefits may be less<br />
obvious or immediate.<br />
We have been instrumental in shifting world opinion towards<br />
the view that humanity should conserve the Antarctic, the<br />
last pristine continent on earth, for scientific and<br />
recreational purposes; and that the barbaric and inefficient<br />
practice of drift-net fishing should be banned. And we will<br />
be working hard for the development of an international<br />
biological diversity convention.<br />
Now, Australia cannot talk with influence and credibility to<br />
the rest of the world about the need to preserve the global<br />
environment unless we are practicing what we preach at home.<br />
I am proud that we are meeting that obligation.<br />
Last year, in my statement on the environment, I outlined<br />
the program of action that we are undertaking. Last month I<br />
issued a progress report and announced a new series of<br />
measures which continue our commitment to the protection of<br />
the environment. I do not propose to itemise them all<br />
today, but several are worthy of particular mention.<br />
One of our most serious environmental problems has been the<br />
threat to our soil. But the point is that this is a problem<br />
for the national economic interest as well a clear cut<br />
cdse where preservation of the environment and protection of<br />
v-ita----i~ ndust-ry -our--iarming-industy,--go. hand in hand.<br />
It is encouraging that large numbers of Australians not only<br />
recognise the importance of addressing this problem but are<br />
prepared to do something about it themselves. The response<br />
to the Landcare program has been very encouraging and gives<br />
us great hope for the future.<br />
If balanced, reasoned decisions on the environment are to be<br />
made then we must have extensive and reliable data to<br />
facilitate the decision making process. </p>
<p>My Government has long recognised this need and has made<br />
significant progress towards the establishment of a system<br />
of data bases that will satisfy it. These include the<br />
National Resource Information Centre, the National Forest<br />
Inventory and the National Wilderness Inventory. These<br />
systems are being developed so that they can be integrated<br />
to allow ready assessment of the full resource implications<br />
of alternative courses of action.<br />
The Resource Assessment Commission, established last year,<br />
will also assist better decision making. This independent<br />
advisory body will conduct inquiries into complex resource<br />
use matters with terms of reference that range across both<br />
the environmental and economic factors involved. The public<br />
inquiry process will contribute to a better and wider<br />
understanding of the facts of a particular situation and of<br />
the issues and options open to us as a nation.<br />
There could be, perhaps, no more contentious and vexed<br />
question than the subject of the Commission's first<br />
reference: the use of our forest resources.<br />
A growing number of Australians have made it clear that they<br />
want to see substantial areas of our native forests<br />
preserved. But the community's demand for timber, paper and<br />
paper products continues to grow. The industry provides<br />
jobs for many thousands and makes a ' very significant<br />
contribution to the Australian economy.<br />
We are confident that, in time, a strategy can be developed<br />
which can Accommodate both the demands for forest<br />
preservation and the need to maintain a thriving and secure<br />
timber industry. We have committed ourselves to that end<br />
and have already announced that we will be taking steps to<br />
expand the supply of pulpwood by encouraging the<br />
establishment of eucalypt plantations. We will be<br />
continuing to work closely with the major interest groups<br />
and the States in the further development of a national<br />
forest strategy. In the end governments must take the<br />
decisions that is what we are elected to do and we will<br />
not shirk that responsibility. But we will be looking to<br />
the Resource Assessment Commission's report to provide a<br />
major input into our decisions.<br />
We have also announced that we will strive for national<br />
siandards of air and water quality and national strategies<br />
to .4mpl-ement-them, We -are-eomi4tted--to -establishing an<br />
Environment Protection Agency to coordinate this work.<br />
Constitutionally the responsibility for these matters rests<br />
in the main with the States, but, as the national<br />
Government, we will assert a role. We must, for a very<br />
simple but compelling reason problems of air and water<br />
quality transcend State boundaries. </p>
<p>The advantages of establishing national environmental<br />
standards are, I believe, also demonstrated by the<br />
guidelines developed for bleached eucalypt kraft pulp mills.<br />
These were developed in consultation with the States as well<br />
as with industry and environmental groups. I am not saying<br />
that there is no place in our system for regional and indeed<br />
local variations in attitudes to issues of the environment<br />
and economic development. But where as with pulp milling<br />
we are concerned with issues impacting on the national<br />
economy, our current account situation and the environment<br />
beyond a particular locality the Commonwealth has a clear<br />
interest and role.<br />
I referred earlier to the pressures and opportunities of the<br />
new environmental awareness for businesses and companies.<br />
Those who own or manage operations with clean,<br />
environmentally sound processes will increasingly gain<br />
commercial advantage over those without. The recent<br />
announcement by the Heinz company that its subsidiaries will<br />
not accept tuna caught in drift nets is a clear and dramatic<br />
example of the commercial power of the community's<br />
environmental consciousness and a welcome and sensitive<br />
expense by a major corporation.<br />
For Australia there will be increasing commercial<br />
opportunities in helping others to make their production<br />
processes more environmentally friendly. New technologies<br />
are needed to increase energy efficiency, to replace<br />
chlorofluorocarbons, to reduce gas emissions.<br />
Some Australian companies are already taking advantage of<br />
these opportunities. The Neutralysis process of waste<br />
disposal and lightweight aggregate production is a<br />
significant world development in waste technology. I am<br />
happy to say that the Commonwealth assisted in this<br />
development through an Industry Research and Development<br />
Grant exceeding $ 1.5 million. We announced recently that up<br />
to $ 4 million a year from this scheme will be made available<br />
for the development of new technologies in waste and<br />
environmental management. The MEMTEC filtration system is<br />
another example of innovation and development by an<br />
Australian company.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen,<br />
The debate on environmental issues is not only more<br />
wfdespread now than ever before more prominent on the<br />
nati-onal-poitical-agenda-than-ever-before but also much<br />
more informed. It is also increasingly co-operative rather<br />
than adversarial. The focus of debate is moving away from<br />
whether we need to change our ways towards the best way of<br />
going about it. This is an extraordinarily healthy<br />
development and one, I suggest, we must all encourage.<br />
Companies in all sectors of the Australian economy are<br />
boosting their environmental sections to ensure that they<br />
keep up with the best of their competition. It is more and<br />
more simply good business practice to do so. </p>
<p>We are all faced with a challenge today, a challenge we<br />
cannot avoid. This challenge is to continue to meet the<br />
reasonable economic expectations and aspirations of all<br />
Australians something which has always been central to the<br />
objectives of my Party without incurring an environmental<br />
debt that will doom future generations to an impoverished<br />
land of greatly reduced opportunities.<br />
I am confident that we can meet this challenge. But to do<br />
so we must work together governments, businesses, unions<br />
and environmental groups.<br />
This conference is evidence of your commitment to<br />
co-operative solutions. We need it we need more of it.<br />
So I wholeheartedly congratulate the organisers for their<br />
vision and hard work, and I have great pleasure in declaring<br />
the International Environmental Solutions Conference open. </p>
