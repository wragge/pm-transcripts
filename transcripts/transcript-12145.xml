    <content><![CDATA[<p>
I announce that we have reached agreement today with the Government of Papua New Guinea to establish a centre to process unauthorised boat arrivals.<br />
Papua New Guinea has agreed to establish a processing centre to assist Australia in combating people smuggling and illegal migration in the Asia-Pacific region.<br />
The new centre will provide a visible deterrent to people smugglers, and continues Australia';s commitment to discouraging unauthorised arrivals.   The arrangement will ensure that Australia continues to meet its international obligations, including ensuring that any claims for asylum are properly considered. Australia will bear the costs of Papua New Guinea';s involvement in the exercise.<br />
I would like to take the opportunity to express my Government';s thanks to the Government of Papua New Guinea for their willingness to provide humanitarian assistance, and for their support in combatting people smuggling.  Their support, together with support already being provided by the Government of Nauru, are important in our efforts to prevent illegal migration in our region.   The unauthorised arrivals rescued by the HMAS Adelaide will be disembarked and held on Christmas Island temporarily, until they can be transferred to the new processing centre in Papua New Guinea.</p>
