1 May 1997 TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
THE HON. JOHN HOWARD MP<br />
PRESS CONFERENCE SYDNEY<br />
FOLLOWING GOVERNMENT BACKBENCH ABORIGINAL<br />
AFFAIRS COMMITTEE MEETING<br />
E OE<br />
Good afternoon. Well, ladies and gentlemen we've had a very lengthy meeting of the<br />
Government Members' Backbench Committee on the Wik issue. I am at the moment<br />
arranging for the release of the 10 point plan. What will happen now is that I will have<br />
fuirther discussion with my Cabinet colleagues. Legislation will be drafted to give<br />
expression to the 10 point plan and that legislation will of course be submitted to the<br />
Party Room for approval and I will have firther discussions with the Party Room as<br />
well on general issue.<br />
I thought we made a lot of progress today and I thought it was a very productive,<br />
although lengthy meeting on a very complex issue. The great thing about my plan is<br />
that it guarantees farmers the right to run their properties without interference from<br />
anybody and it also respects native title. It restores to farmers the uncertainty created<br />
by the Wik decision. It removes, I'm sorry, the uncertainty for farmers created by the<br />
Wk decision. It empowers farmers to run and manage their properties and it provides<br />
a fair basis of dealing with any claims for compensation. It delivers certainty to<br />
pastoralists but respects native title. It is the one fair, sensible, practicable way of<br />
resolving an extraordinarily difficult issue which if allowed to drag on for months of<br />
disputation and argument will paralyse mining dovelopment in parts of Australia, create<br />
tension between different sections of the Australian community and firther depress<br />
rural and regional areas of Australia.<br />
Anybody who believes that the interests of rural Australia lie in fiurther delay on this<br />
issue misunderstand the problems that face rural Austalia. Those who say to niral<br />
Australia that their best bet lies in Ambrter delay and further disputation are doing a<br />
disservice to rural Australia. What the farmers of Australia want is certainty, this will<br />
give it to them. What the Aborigines of Australia want is respect for native title, this<br />
Faaxu 01/ 05/ 97 18: 06 Pg: </p>
<p>Fax from will give it to them. And what all the Australian people want is a solution that we can<br />
all honourably accept and live with and this will deliver that solution.<br />
JRNLST: Prime Minister, so when you talk about delay are you suggesting that one line<br />
extinguishment would be the cause?<br />
PUM MINISTER:<br />
One line extinguishment could create months and months, perhaps several years of'<br />
additional delay, of course it could. One line ex ' tinguishment would at the very least<br />
have little chance of passing through the Federal Parliament. One line extinguishment<br />
could be subject to major constitutional challenge. One line extinguishment could<br />
result in a huge compensation bill. One line extinguishment would be seen as inflaming<br />
this issue, not soothing it.<br />
JIRNLST: On the basis of today's reaction to the backbenich committee meeting are you confident<br />
of overwhelming support of your 10 point plan, Prime Minister?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Look, I believe that as people come to understand the certainty that this plan delivers<br />
to Australia's farmers and that it respects native title, they will embrace it. I thought I<br />
made a lot of progress today when I had the detail of it explained and people were<br />
impressed at the way in which the plan did provide certainty in management. I can<br />
understand the superficial appeal, the simplistic appeal of one line extinguishment, I<br />
understand that and I understand the anger of the farmers but can I say to the farmers<br />
of Australia, this will give you what you want in a way that can be achieved without<br />
unnecessary pain and delay.<br />
JRNLST: Bob Katter and Hill O'Chee seem unconvinced today.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well I didn't really expect to convince either of them.<br />
JRNLST: Are they speaking on behalf of the National Party W~ s or Farxfft0 1/ 85/ 97 18: 06 Pg: 2 </p>
<p>Fax from PRIME MINISTER:<br />
No I don't think so. There were a lot of other National Party M~ s there today that<br />
didn't say the same things as they did. I mean, Bob and Bill have gone out on a limb<br />
on this and they can hardly change their minds.<br />
JRNLST: Prime Minister how hard initially do you think this has been and is going to prove, to<br />
continue to prove given people like Bill O'Chee and Bob Katter?<br />
PRIME AMISTER:<br />
I mean this is a difficult issue. It is a difficult issue for the whole country. And<br />
Government is not a bed of roses. I won't lapse into one of my predecessor's<br />
immortal expressions on this subject but it's part of the territory. You have to expect<br />
difficult issues and none is more difficult because what you're dealing with is an<br />
unprecedented clash, I suppose, of the interests of a group of Australians who for<br />
generations have believed that they were deprived and dispossessed, and as a group are<br />
the least well endowed of all Australians and that's the Aborigines and they have rights<br />
and interests and they are entitled to be treated with respect. And on the other hand<br />
you have a group of people, the farmers, who have really done it hard and then<br />
suddenly had cast over them this great pall of uncertainty. Now, what my plan does is<br />
to cater for both concerns. It respects the rights of the Aborigines but it also redeliver.,<br />
security to farmers. The great message out of my package is that farmers can run their<br />
properties without interference from anybody.<br />
JRNLST: So what happens from here, Prime Minister? When will this become legislation?<br />
PREIE MIN~ ISTER:<br />
As soon as possible. I mean, the overwhelming desire of people in that room today<br />
was to get this thing behind them.<br />
JBNLST: Can you get legislation in in the Budget session?<br />
PRIME NMISTER:<br />
I will give instructions for legislation to be drafted immediately and I've got to go back<br />
and talk to the Cabinet but the States are anxious to see the legislation and I have<br />
agreed in the drafting of the legislation to heavily involve the officials of the States<br />
because this is very much a land management issue and the states are entitled to be<br />
involved and I will be having further discussions with the Aborigina leaders and I will<br />
have some further discussions with the mining industry and the National Farmers'<br />
Federation. I can understand the circumspection of some of the rural groups because<br />
Fa1xf/ r0M5/ 97 18: 06 Pg: 3 </p>
<p>Fax from they were dudded in 1993 and they don't want to be dudded again but can I tell you,<br />
this is the, the least duddable piece of legislation that the rural community of Australia<br />
has ever seen.<br />
JRNLST: You mentioned the Aboriginal leadership a moment ago. As you know, the<br />
negotiators, including Gatjil Djei-rkura, accused you of not negotiating in good faith on<br />
this issue among other things. What can you do, do you think, to bring them back into<br />
the ( inaudible) as it were?<br />
PRJME MINIS'TR:<br />
Look, there are a lot of things said in the heat of the moment on these issues. .1<br />
thought the Chairman of the Council for Reconciliation said on Anzac Day that I was<br />
fair dinkum. and I am and I've always been fair dinkuni with the Aborigines and I've<br />
never disguised the fact that Wik could not remain undiminished. I've never disguised<br />
that fact, I've always said to the Aboriginal community that in the eyes of the<br />
Australian public and in reality the pendulum had swung a little too far and it had to<br />
come back to the centre and what my legislation does is to bring it back to the centre<br />
where most people want it to be. They don't want the Aborigines ignored. They want<br />
the concept of native title preserved but they do not want pastoralists to be left unable<br />
to manage their properties without complete certainty and this package will say to the<br />
farmers of Australia, you've got your properties, you can do what you want to do<br />
without having to get the permission of anybody,<br />
JRNLST: The other day you took on notice as it were the question of whether or not you would<br />
consider using the land fund as a basis for compensation for your ten point plan. Have<br />
you had any further thoughts on that since you... have you taken advice?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, beyond what I said the other day, I mean anything is a possibility, but I haven't<br />
really, I have not really had any time to give thought to that. I have been too busy<br />
talldng to people about the detail of the plan. I will have a look at that. You've got to<br />
remember that one of the bases on which the land fund was established, my<br />
recollection is that this was mentioned in the second reading speech or it may have<br />
been referred to at the time by the former Prime Minister was that pastoral leases had<br />
extinguished native title.<br />
JRNLST: But wasn't the reasons that the land fund, or one of the underpinnings of the land fund<br />
was for people who had no hope of making, provide for the most dispossessed, those<br />
who had no hope? Fa om01/ 05/ 97 18: 06 PS: 4 </p>
<p>Fax from: 01/ 05/ 97 18: 06 Pg:<br />
PR1M MINISTER:<br />
You can rest assured that, you know, 1 am not going to rule anything out but we're<br />
obviously not going to be unfair.<br />
JRNLST: Can you brief us on any changes or anything you firmed up today, any fine tuning of<br />
the ten point plan?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
There was really virtually no fine tuning today. I think the great advantage of today<br />
was that people, some people for the first time really understood it and when they<br />
understood it they realised the enormous steps that the Government has taken to<br />
enable farmers to run their affairs.<br />
JLRNLST: Prime Minister, Bob Katter spoke about modifications that you would consider. Can<br />
you give us some information about modifications?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Look, they're not areas, there are a few what I would call procedural things that we've<br />
been willing to look at but the main tenets of the plan remain the same.<br />
JEINLST: As far as you're concerned, is the hardest part of selling this plan now behind you?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I never make those sort of rash predictions. I have always, I have believed for some<br />
time that this was the fair way of handling this problem and I knew it would bhe<br />
difficult-I can understand why some people in rural Australia are concerned. They<br />
were let down I think in 1993. They were misled by a lot of people in 1993 and they're<br />
a little suspicious at the moment and I happen to have the opportunity of reassuring<br />
them that farmers of Australia can rely on John Howard. John Howard will never<br />
desert the farmers of Australia. They are the last group in the Australian community I<br />
would ever desert.<br />
Thank you. </p>
