<p>  Good evening. One of the key roles of government in this large sparsely</p>
<p>   populated nation is to satisfy the important infrastructure needs of regional</p>
<p>   Australia. It is a major nation building role and one which my Government</p>
<p>   is seeking to fulfil.</p>
<p>  For many years I have been a strong supporter of a competitive Australian</p>
<p>   rail network. And for 89 years governments and individuals have dreamt about</p>
<p>   the construction of an Alice Springs to Darwin railway. At last that dream</p>
<p>   is about to become reality. Following detailed negotiations between my Government</p>
<p>   and the Governments of South Australia and the Northern Territory, enough</p>
<p>   money will be provided to enable the project to go ahead.</p>
<p>  Over three years the Federal Government will contribute up to $165 million</p>
<p>   for this project out of a total of $480 million from the three Governments,</p>
<p>   and $750 million from the private sector. Again it demonstrates the social</p>
<p>   coalition in action. Government and the private sector working in partnership</p>
<p>   to provide for the infrastructure needs of the nation.</p>
<p>  When the first sod is turned mid next year it will represent the beginning</p>
<p>   of construction of rail track stretching 1400 kilometres from the Southern</p>
<p>   Ocean to the Timor Sea. The construction will take three years and generate</p>
<p>   7,000 jobs in rural and regional Australia including 18 months work for</p>
<p>   the BHP steelworks in Whyalla. I have called it the Steel Snowy because</p>
<p>   like the Snowy Mountain Scheme which began 50 years ago this year, it is</p>
<p>   a major project of national development.</p>
<p>  The railway will be good for Australian exporters, open up more opportunities</p>
<p>   for Australian industry and jobs. Most importantly I hope that it will send</p>
<p>   the strongest possible message to Australians in the bush that they deserve</p>
<p>   an equal share in Australia's economic prosperity. Goodnight.</p>
<p>  [Ends]</p>
