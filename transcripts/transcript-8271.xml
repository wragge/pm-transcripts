PRIME MINISTEI~<br />
CHECK AGAIN; T DELITVRRY EMBARGOED UNTIL DELITVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
NATIONAL PRESS CLUB<br />
WEDNESDAY, 13 MARCH 1991<br />
Mr President:, ladies and gentlemen<br />
This is the third time I have had the pleasure of addressing<br />
the National Press Club in just under a year.<br />
I hope no-one thinks I'm abusing the Club's hospitality.<br />
Rather, the importance of these three occasions reflects the<br />
importance of the Club itself, and the importance of the<br />
National Press Club luncheons, as an institution in the life<br />
of our capital and our country.<br />
You will recall that the two previous occasions in these<br />
twelve months were my election-eve address last March, and<br />
my proposals for reform of Commonwealth-State relations<br />
Towards a Closer Partnership last July.<br />
And without pretentiousness, I believe it is entirely<br />
appropriate to see these three addresses as a trilogy.<br />
They have, X: believe, an underlying unity, a consistency of<br />
purpose and a commonality of themes.<br />
In my address to the Club before the last election and in<br />
that speech itself I was paraphrasing remarks I had made to<br />
you, only the previous December I said this:<br />
' In this election I am fighting to realise a vision for<br />
Austral~ ia an Australia with a modern, diversified,<br />
competitive and export-oriented economy; an Australia<br />
vigorously engaged with the world economy, and enmeshed<br />
in part: icular with the dynamism of Asia and the<br />
Pacific; an Australia committed to maintaining and<br />
enhancing the quality of life, social justice and the<br />
preservation of our natural environment; a self-reliant<br />
Austral~ ia, not merely fitting in with the world as we<br />
find it, but helping to shape it.' </p>
<p>Our whole campaign, and the policies we presented and which<br />
the people endorsed, were designed to advance those goals<br />
to bring that kind of Australia into reality.<br />
My, proposals to establish a new Federal-State partnership,<br />
which I laid before you four months later, speeded our<br />
course towards those same goals. These processes of<br />
negotiation between the three levels of Government in this<br />
country are designed, as I said to you then:<br />
' to improve our national efficiency and international<br />
competitiveness, and to improve the delivery and<br />
quality of the services governments provide'.<br />
And, the purpose of my Statement yesterday was to announce a<br />
package of substantial new measures directed, again, to that<br />
fundamental task: improving the productive capacity of our<br />
economy, to make it more competitive internationally.<br />
This cannot be stated too frequently or too strongly: the<br />
master key to unlock the gates to the kind of Australia we<br />
seek is, in the words of that Statement, building a<br />
competitive Australia.<br />
The measures I announced are all directed to increasing<br />
national competitiveness.<br />
That's why we are reducing tariffs, reducing wholesale<br />
taxes, pushing ahead with micro-economic reform, overhauling<br />
the Federal system, building a clever country.<br />
Today, I want to point to what the decisions show about my<br />
Government's approach to its role and responsibilities.<br />
Because this Statement is an expression of our view of the<br />
proper role of government in Australia, during this crucial<br />
decade. Too often, this question of the role of government is<br />
presented and argued in simplistic black and white terms.<br />
Some people assert that Government should never retreat one<br />
step from interventionism that the cosy deals of all-round<br />
protectionism of the fifties and sixties must be left<br />
intact; that every intervention by governments in the market<br />
must be defended; that every asset the Government has<br />
accumulated over the decades should be retained; that every<br />
welfare entitlement ever bestowed is sacrosanct.<br />
Others, by contrast, insist, dogmatically, that less<br />
Government is necessarily better Government; that every<br />
market will work to maximum efficiency only when Government<br />
has vacated the field; that private sector provision of<br />
services is superior to public sector provision, by<br />
definition; that any regulation is too much regulation.<br />
Neither approach deals with today's realities. Neither<br />
approach meets the demands of building a competitive<br />
Australia. </p>
<p>Both approaches are totally inadequate as a basis for<br />
leadership in meeting that challenge. And the proper role<br />
of Government is about leadership setting the right goals<br />
for this nation and setting the right policy framework<br />
within which the people themselves can best achieve those<br />
goals. We have to face the fact that, in ninety years of<br />
Federation, Australia has accumulated huge impediments to<br />
efficiency in the way we govern ourselves, the way we run<br />
our economy, and the practices we have entrenched in our<br />
places of work. Yesterday's Statement is a major step<br />
towards removing those impediments.<br />
The Statement must, of course, be placed in the context of<br />
the reform already achieved a consistent continuing<br />
process over the past eight years.<br />
We put micro-economic reform on the political agenda of this<br />
country, and we have stayed ahead of the game ever since.<br />
We were the first to identify the bottlenecks and start to<br />
clear them. We have won the co-operation of those involved<br />
in making the reforms work, and we have set tight timetables<br />
to achieve them.<br />
And let me immediately meet head on the suggestion that the<br />
Statement fails to push ahead with micro-economic reform<br />
fast enough.<br />
I make this simple assertion: we have achieved more microeconomic<br />
reform in the last eight years than was achieved in<br />
the previous: eighty.<br />
I invite those who suggest we are moving too slowly to<br />
consider the following list of activity underway, in this<br />
year of 1991 alone:<br />
on the wharves, productivity will improve by up to<br />
per cent by the end of the year<br />
on our ships, crew levels will be reduced to the levels<br />
of our major trading partners<br />
by December, we will have a second telecommunications<br />
carrier we are already reaping the benefits of open competition<br />
in domestic aviation<br />
conditional on a positive outcome of the environmental<br />
impact study, tenders will be let immediately to start<br />
construction of the third runway at Sydney airport<br />
the National Rail Freight Corporation will be<br />
established on 1 July with world standard workplace<br />
efficiencies </p>
<p>S we have set the basis for the introduction of uniform<br />
charges on road users this year<br />
S at the Second Special Premiers Conference in May and<br />
November there will be further reform of the processes<br />
of government<br />
S at the May Conference, we will seek ways to increase<br />
competition through extending the Trade Practices Act<br />
S union amalgamations, award restructuring, and<br />
enterprise bargaining will continue to transform the<br />
Australian work place all without significant<br />
industrial disruption or a wages free-for-all<br />
S accelerated tariff reductions, lower wholesale sales<br />
taxes and simpler depreciation provisions announced<br />
yesterday will all improve the quality of long-term<br />
resource allocation within Australia.<br />
That's in this year alone. Yet we have the cry from the<br />
conservative parties who did nothing for a generation<br />
about the Australian infrastructure, who indeed created or<br />
entrenched its worst inadequacies that we should go<br />
faster.<br />
But note this they have not made a single practical<br />
suggestion about how to ' move faster'. And, in fact, when<br />
questioned about this only this morning, Dr Hewson conceded,<br />
and I quote:<br />
' Nothing is easy in this business and there's no<br />
substitute really for a long hard slog of structural<br />
reform.'<br />
But never, in their long period of office, did our opponents<br />
dream of beginning the long hard slog themselves. In their<br />
public rhetoric, they call for confrontation, a return to<br />
the industrial disruption of the days before the Accord.<br />
But behind the macho display, they concede the magnitude of<br />
our achievement.<br />
We find their spokesman on shipping and waterfront reform,<br />
John Sharp, saying only last November:<br />
' Looking at the Government's performance in<br />
micro-economic reform of coastal shipping and the<br />
waterfront, we find that its greatest area of success<br />
has been in shipping... The Government should be<br />
congratulated for that we must give credit where<br />
credit is due, because this is a notable change.'<br />
And for a real show of strength and firm policy direction, I<br />
invite you to consider the recent remarks of their spokesman<br />
for industry and commerce, Ian McLachlan. At an industry<br />
seminar in February, he told a questioner and I quote from<br />
The Australian: </p>
<p>' Your question is ' will we have the guts to do it'<br />
( reform the waterfront). I don't know. George Bush<br />
said, ' read my lips'. I can only say you're going to<br />
have to either trust people or keep voting Labor.'<br />
As I have said, part of the proper role of government is to<br />
provide leadership. Leadership involves not only making the<br />
correct decisions, and changing policies. It involves<br />
promoting change in community attitudes, when those<br />
attitudes entrench wrong policies.<br />
This is the essence of leadership, and it is a far more<br />
difficult and challenging role. It is harder to change<br />
attitudes than it is to change policies.<br />
And the whole thrust of the Statement yesterday is to<br />
promote changed attitudes, and to reverse the pernicious and<br />
pervasive results of Australia's traditional protectionism.<br />
Industry will no longer be able to regard the domestic<br />
market as its captive. There will be real incentive for<br />
industry to improve the quality of its product and adopt new<br />
technology. Initiative will be properly rewarded, not<br />
penalised. The fact is, ladies and gentlemen, that behind the high<br />
tariff walls, managers and workers practised confrontation<br />
rather than co-operation. Ultimately, the Australian<br />
customer paid the penalty in higher prices as tariffs were<br />
increased to cover the widening gap between the productivity<br />
of our protected industries and those overseas. Such<br />
industries were incapable of competing on world markets.<br />
But worse still, tariffs damaged our traditional, efficient<br />
export industries. Not only do tariffs raise prices<br />
directly they also cause workers to demand, and make tariff<br />
protected industries relaxed about conceding higher wages,<br />
raising the cost structure for all Australian enterprises.<br />
In addition to this burden on our export industries, tariffs<br />
cost ordinary Australians dearly indirectly, because we<br />
were all living in a society poorer than it could otherwise<br />
have been, and directly straight out of our pockets<br />
because tariffs meant more expensive consumer goods. And as<br />
I pointed out yesterday, tariffs are highly regressive. The<br />
Industry Commission estimates that the burden that tariffs<br />
impose on lowest income Australians is three times heavier<br />
than that imposed on those with the highest incomes.<br />
By restricting our participation in the increasingly<br />
important trade in sophisticated manufactured goods, tariffs<br />
constricted Australia's growth at a time when the rest of<br />
the world, including our own region, was growing rapidly.<br />
And beyond the hard arguments, I believe this:<br />
If our economy were to turn back once more to the era of<br />
insularity and introspection, when we sheltered behind high </p>
<p>tariff walls, then it would in the long run become as<br />
financially bankrupt, as our society would be morally<br />
bankrupt if we were to shelter once more behind the walls of<br />
a White Australia policy. That is why I say that the role<br />
of leadership, the proper role of government, is to change<br />
attitudes as much as to change policies.<br />
Mr President<br />
In my Statement I made no attempt to conceal the fact that<br />
at this time of recession the Government has deliberately<br />
turned away from offering short-term palliatives.<br />
This is because: first, the decisions to lift Australia out of<br />
recession, through interest rate falls and tax<br />
cuts, have already been taken;<br />
second, the long term structural changes on which<br />
we have embarked are in themselves directed to<br />
improving, through greater competitiveness, the<br />
prosperity of the Australian people; and<br />
third, to the extent that the recession is causing<br />
temporary hardship, this hardship is alleviated by<br />
the safety net we have strengthened and widened.<br />
It is on this third point that we can see most starkly the<br />
contrast between this Government and the Opposition about<br />
the proper role of government.<br />
A political party's character is not tested when times are<br />
good and when pay packets are full.<br />
Because a rising tide does lift all boats and it is a<br />
relatively simple political task to distribute the benefits<br />
of growth.<br />
The true test of character comes on the economic ebb tide.<br />
That is when you see political parties in their true<br />
colours. That is true of Australian politics today.<br />
And what a-stark contrast it provides.<br />
On the one hand, the Government has assiduously targeted the<br />
resources of the public sector so that the maximum<br />
assistance is delivered to those who need it most.<br />
Within a massive reduction in Government spending as a<br />
proportion of GDP since 1983, we have substantially lifted<br />
the amount of money, in real terms, devoted across the<br />
spectrum of social justice programs.<br />
Through the Family Allowance Supplement, through Medicare,<br />
through our expanded agenda of action on behalf of </p>
<p>Aboriginal people, we are ensuring that those in need do see<br />
the compassiLonate face of Government.<br />
And in yesterday's Statement, I outlined ways in which the<br />
Government would assist those directly disadvantaged by the<br />
tariff cuts.<br />
Because it has been my firm conviction that where the<br />
community is prepared to achieve changes that deliver<br />
benefits at the expense of a few, then the community must be<br />
prepared to share the burden of change with them.<br />
That is why we have established labour adjustment programs<br />
for workers in the car and TCF industries, so that<br />
relocation, retraining and redeployment is not just a<br />
theoretical possibility but an actual outcome of the tariff<br />
reforms. We bring thi~ s same approach in dealing with the consequences<br />
of recession. If the benefits are to be shared, so must<br />
some of the burdens.<br />
We are determined that we will emerge from this recession<br />
with enduring gain to show for its transitory pain.<br />
A recession can severely damage a nation's resources in the<br />
form of its job skills. Apprentices, in particular, have<br />
been hit badily in the past. They have been laid of f with<br />
their training incomplete and thrown onto the dole, never<br />
able to resume their training a permanent personal loss,<br />
and a permanent loss to the community. That was one of the<br />
worst aspects of previous recessions.<br />
We cannot afford to repeat that kind of double loss. And<br />
that is why I announced yesterday, new programs to enable<br />
employers to retain and improve the skills of apprentices<br />
and other workers who would otherwise be working reduced<br />
hours or have been retrenched; and why we will spend<br />
$ 74 million, over the next two years, to provide work<br />
experience for people unemployed for more than six months.<br />
Against all this, the conservative parties reveal a quite<br />
different set of values, and the implications of their<br />
philosophy, damaging enough to a society at any stage of the<br />
economic cycle, are truly devastating in a society in<br />
recession. Unemployment benefits are a lifeline for many Australians in<br />
these difficult times. That is a sad fact.<br />
But the Opposition alternative is to prevent unemployed<br />
people from receiving benefits after nine months, and to<br />
tell them to swim or sink.<br />
The Opposition's long-standing antipathy towards Medicare,<br />
its suggested voucher system for education, and its truly<br />
astonishing proposals to privatise Social Security so that<br />
welfare assistance could be channelled through the voluntary </p>
<p>8.<br />
agencies all point to the contrast between us, in<br />
attitudes to the proper role of Government.<br />
And, on top of all this, we have their proposals to undo our<br />
progress towards a more efficient and fair taxation system.<br />
First, they propose a consumption tax which would give<br />
inflation a massive shot in the arm at the very time when<br />
Australia has the opportunity of economic recovery with low<br />
inflation and low interest rates.<br />
And a blatantly regressive tax at that a tax on food and<br />
clothing which will not be fully compensated, meaning lower<br />
living standards for working Australians.<br />
And second, they propose a flatter income tax which would<br />
also, by definition, impose a heavier burden on lower income<br />
earners. In sum, their policies reveal a view about the role of<br />
Government diametrically opposed to ours.<br />
Where we have made a safety net, they would make a social<br />
trap door through which they would push the most<br />
disadvantaged Australians.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen,<br />
Today, I have examined aspects of my Statement as an<br />
expression of our approach to the proper role of government.<br />
But I repeat again what I tried to emphasise yesterday: in<br />
the final analysis, the challenges ahead demand the<br />
involvement of all Australians. And I really believe that<br />
one of the best of all the great things about being an<br />
Australian, is that none of us is automatically excluded<br />
from participation in the task of making this an even better<br />
place. </p>
