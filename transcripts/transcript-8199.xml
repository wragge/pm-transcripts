SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
NATIONAL IMMIGRATION OUTLOOK CONFERENCE<br />
MELBOURNE 14 NOVEMBER 1990<br />
I want at the outset to congratulate John Nieuwenhuysen and<br />
the Bureau of Immigration Research for the way in which they<br />
have arranged and conducted this important Conference.<br />
I welcome the research experts and policy specialists from<br />
academia and government who will be bringing their special<br />
skills to bear on the important issues of immigration and<br />
ethnic affairs.<br />
And I particularly welcome the presence of organisations<br />
representing the broader community: churches, ethnic groups,<br />
unions, businesses.<br />
The nation's policies on immigration and ethnic affairs are<br />
the responsibility of all Australians not the preserve of<br />
a policy elit~ e. Thanks to this Conference, Australians have<br />
the opportunity they deserve to subject these key policy<br />
areas to an unparalleled scrutiny.<br />
It will be rigourous and comprehensive scrutiny,<br />
dispassionate and sophisticated precisely the qualities<br />
whose absence from public discussion about immigration<br />
prompted the Federal Government to establish the Bureau of<br />
Immigration Research last year.<br />
It is not too long ago that the phrase " immigration debate"<br />
had been distorted to become a code-word for those who<br />
wanted to cut the level of immigration and in particular<br />
for those who wanted to do so by reintroducing racial<br />
criteria into our selection procedures.<br />
Compared to those days, the immigration debate now gives off<br />
much less heat and much more light.<br />
From every point of view, that is a welcome change. </p>
<p>Because of course there are important and legitimate<br />
questions about immigration that deserve calm discussion and<br />
careful study sensible questions about the overall size,<br />
make up, administration and impact of immigration, including<br />
its impact on the Australian economy and the Australian<br />
environment. In endeavouring to answer these issues, our starting point<br />
must not be, and is not: by what means can the criterion of<br />
race be reintroduced to our selection procedures?<br />
Our starting point is not: how can the immigration clock be<br />
turned back to the 1950s and 1960s?<br />
The starting point is: how best can the public be informed<br />
about the totality of immigration and ethnic affairs<br />
programs so that legitimate questions can be answered and<br />
positive improvements made where necessary and so that<br />
baseless concerns and fears are put to rest?<br />
In few countries is this more important and more relevant<br />
than in Australia.<br />
Since 1788 we have been, and we essentially remain, a land<br />
of migrants a community built up and made strong by waves<br />
of new settlers who have over two centuries invested their<br />
diverse skills and boundless hopes on making a new life for<br />
themselves and their families in this country.<br />
By the end of the Second World War, with a population of<br />
just over seven million, Australia embarked on a massive<br />
program to quicken the pace of immigration.<br />
Since then, the annual intake has varied widely swinging<br />
from a high of 185,000 in 1970 to a low of 53,000 in 1975.<br />
The target for 1990-91 is 126,000<br />
But the basic thrust of large-scale migration to Australia<br />
has been consistent; our migration program has been one of<br />
the largest in the world relative to the size of our<br />
population. Since the Second World War, 60 per cent of our<br />
population growth has been supplied by migration.<br />
And over that period, too, the pool of countries and<br />
cultures from which migrants have been selected has<br />
gradually widened. Today, about one in five Australian<br />
residents was born overseas, in one of more than 130 nations<br />
around the world.<br />
One of the central issues of this Conference is the question<br />
of the impact of this mass immigration in particular, its<br />
impact on the Australian economy.<br />
A simple balance sheet of immigration would show<br />
on one side, that immigrants contribute to<br />
economic capacity through supplying more labour,<br />
especially skilled labour; </p>
<p>and on the other, that immigrants make demands on<br />
that economic capacity through immediate<br />
consumption, and demands for housing and public<br />
services.<br />
It's not surprising that the downside of the balance sheet<br />
often receives greater public attention especially in<br />
times of national economic difficulties.<br />
It's entire: ly understandable in such times that some people<br />
might see migration making competition for jobs tougher.<br />
It's understandable and especially so as our awareness of<br />
the importance of the environment increases that some<br />
people might see population pressures threatening our<br />
fragile continent and depleting our resources.<br />
It's underst~ andable but regrettable that some people<br />
will assume that the help new arrivals receive as they<br />
settle in Australia amounts to special privileges denied<br />
long-term residents.<br />
And it's understandable though wrong that some people<br />
argue that immigration runs counter to the nation's<br />
essential economic task of reducing its current account<br />
deficit and inflation.<br />
I don't agree with any of those arguments, but I describe<br />
them as understandable because we have hitherto lacked the<br />
data that would enable us to determine the precise costs and<br />
benefits of immigration.<br />
Of course, it was to provide such detailed analysis that we<br />
established the Bureau of Immigration Research.<br />
And I note with satisfaction the conclusions of the Bureau's<br />
initial studies.<br />
The recent publication, Australian Immigration, A Survey of&amp;<br />
the Tsii~ q, concludes that available research seems to<br />
suggest that: immigration generally confers positive economic<br />
benefits. None of the complaints about migrants taking Australian jobs<br />
bears close academic scrutiny. Indeed, " the evidence<br />
strongly refutes the claim that immigration leads to<br />
increases in unemployment", according to the survey.<br />
In other words, the balance sheet analysis comes out in the<br />
black. The debate is about the scale of the benefits.<br />
And this very important point needs to be understood.<br />
The economic purpose of immigration from the Government's<br />
point of view is not to achieve specific goals such as a<br />
lower current account deficit or higher exports. </p>
<p>Those who argue about the alleged inflationary or debtcreating<br />
nature of immigration miss the point.<br />
There are more efficient arms of policy that can be applied<br />
to meet broad macro-economic goals; immigration is not a tap<br />
that can be simply turned on or off to fine tune the<br />
economy. The economic purpose of immigration in addition to its<br />
international humanitarian and family reunion aspects is<br />
to strengthen the productive capacity of the economy.<br />
Like any other form of investment in our country,<br />
immigration may involve short-term costs, but it can produce<br />
long-term benefits and it is the Government's very clear<br />
aim to ensure those benefits are achieved.<br />
We should all be proud that our immigration procedures no<br />
longer discriminate-on grounds of race.<br />
At the same time, our selection does discriminate a great<br />
deal as it should on economic grounds.<br />
The points system discriminates heavily in favour of<br />
applicants who are young, whose jobs skills are in demand in<br />
Australia, and who can speak English while recognising<br />
too, fundamental humanitarian and family values.<br />
In other words we have a sophisticated and dynamic means of<br />
choosing among applicants directed precisely at enhancing<br />
our national productive capacity<br />
The skill level of immigrants has risen steadily under<br />
my Government. In fact, migrants generally have higher<br />
skills than the resident population, and healthy labour<br />
force participation rates. This high rate of<br />
employment enhances the scope for economic gains.<br />
The family reunion and humanitarian categories of<br />
immigration include sizeable elements of skilled<br />
labour. It is too often overlooked that many family<br />
members are now selected on the basis of skills.<br />
The relative youth of the migrant intake delivers<br />
longer term benefits for our productive capacity and<br />
improves our ability to support dependent groups a<br />
significant point as the baby-boom generation leaves<br />
the workforce over the next couple of decades and<br />
begins to rely on community support through age<br />
pensions. Immigrants do bring new ideas, techniques and<br />
experiences. They provide the potential for expanding<br />
domestic markets, which enhances the adoption and<br />
diffusion of new technology. </p>
<p>So we are creating, through immigration, a much stronger,<br />
more powerful, more resilient economy one that should<br />
enable us better to meet the challenges of competitive world<br />
markets. And we are also creating a dynamic and cohesive community.<br />
The skilled migrant of today may be the sponsor of the<br />
family reunion migrant of tomorrow; Australia consciously<br />
rejected any sort of guestworker scheme, where rich<br />
countries use up the labour of people from less well off<br />
countries and then send them home. That has been tried<br />
elsewhere and has proven unsuccessful. We don't want to<br />
create second-class citizens with a transient commitment to<br />
Australia; we want their permanent commitment to Australia,<br />
as full citizens of and participants in our nation. That is<br />
the best way probably the only way to a coherent,<br />
harmonious society.<br />
So it is simply not true to claim, as some have done, that<br />
Australia has an uncontrolled program, or that our capacity<br />
as a sovereign nation to determine who should and should not<br />
enter our country has been diminished and compromised.<br />
Immigration is a tightly controlled process; each year, our<br />
embassies and consulates around the world turn away hundreds<br />
of thousands of people who do not meet our tight entry<br />
requirements.<br />
An integral aspect of the immigration program is the<br />
attraction of migrants whose potential lies not in their job<br />
skills but in their capital wealth and entrepreneurial<br />
skills.<br />
The business migration program has brought to Australia not<br />
only new funding for businesses here but new know-how and<br />
important social links that can help improve our trading<br />
position. The Business Migration Program has received considerable<br />
scrutiny recently. In order to ensure it achieves its<br />
objectives the Government has recently implemented<br />
mechanisms to reduce the risk of fraud and impropriety,<br />
including the inspection of bank accounts and formalised<br />
means for the verification of the transfer of applicants'<br />
funds to Australia. Overall, however, business migration<br />
remains of significant benefit to Australia.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen,<br />
I have said on many occasions that I favour a larger<br />
population for Australia. I describe myself as a higher<br />
immigration man rather than a lower immigration man.<br />
I have said that ideally Australia might have a population<br />
of about 25 million by 2015 or 2020 but there are too many<br />
hypotheticals to make any such assumption a worthwhile<br />
population target for Australia. </p>
<p>But I make very clear the thrust of Government policy: we<br />
believe that with proper planning, Australia has the<br />
capacity to absorb a growing population.<br />
I repeat: with proper planning and provision.<br />
We are of course seeking to resolve, through the<br />
ecologically sustainable development processes, the<br />
inevitable conflicts that arise about environmental<br />
protection. We are bringing together unions, developers,<br />
environmentalists and State Governments in working groups<br />
that will help us as a community make decisions in the<br />
future that are fully informed about the costs and benefits<br />
of development proposals.<br />
Clearly, environmental threats can be posed by people by<br />
growing cities, by heavier infrastructure use, by increased<br />
traffic in national parks as much as by traditional<br />
economic activities. We have to find the right balance<br />
here. To this end, the Government is to ask the National<br />
Population Council to examine the major issues which flow<br />
from the increase in Australia's population, as a result<br />
both of net migration and natural increase.<br />
The Council has a membership of economists, demographers and<br />
sociologists, as well as representatives of the conservation<br />
movement, trade unions and business, so it is well equipped<br />
for the task.<br />
I will be asking the Council to examine all pertinent<br />
matters including the impact of population increase on the<br />
economy, environment, human service delivery,<br />
infrastructure, social equity and international obligations.<br />
I want the Council to consult widely and to prepare a<br />
discussion paper by next September, so that it will be<br />
available for the Government's consideration, together with<br />
the reports from the working groups on ecologically<br />
sustainable development.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen,<br />
One of the reasons that Australian immigration has been such<br />
a remarkable success story is that throughout the post-war<br />
period, immigration has enjoyed broad bipartisan support at<br />
the parliamentary level and broad community support.<br />
Our methods of selecting and rejecting migrant applicants;<br />
our annual targets; our policies for post-arrival<br />
settlement; our recognition of Australia as a multicultural<br />
society; our commitment to citizenship have all enjoyed the<br />
support of both major political parties. </p>
<p>7<br />
There was of course one brief and recent departure from<br />
this, when the Opposition parties jettisoned<br />
multiculturalism and toyed with the reintroduction of racial<br />
criteria in migrant selection.<br />
I note the Federal Opposition still has difficulties voicing<br />
any kind of enthusiasm for multiculturalism, while seeming<br />
to accept most of the policies embraced by that term.<br />
But it is my very profound hope that bipartisanship will<br />
return to the landscape of immigration and ethnic affairs.<br />
When bipartisanship was breached, I had no reluctance about<br />
fighting the poliical battle in defence of an immigration<br />
policy free of racial discrimination.<br />
But'I stress in this audience that there are two vitally<br />
important poliny~ c reasons for wanting to see bipartisanship<br />
back in place.<br />
First, it will mean that where the immigration program needs<br />
to be adjusted and fine-tuned in the future, as it has been<br />
in the past, those changes can be made smoothly and<br />
efficiently. And second, it will deny any vestige of credibility to those<br />
extreme minority elements in the community who seek to turn<br />
the clock back to racist selection procedures, or who seek<br />
to undermine the firm foundations that have been laid for<br />
national unity in our culturally diverse society.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen,<br />
From the xenophobic days of White Australia, we have created<br />
an immigration program that has brought to our shores the<br />
cultures, languages, and skills of the whole world.<br />
We are a diverse and exciting society a far cry from the<br />
essentially monocultural post-war Australia that embarked on<br />
the great campaign of immigration.<br />
I don't believe anyone today would want to sacrifice the<br />
enormous lifestyle benefits each of us enjoys from living in<br />
such a country in the 1990s.<br />
And the most important thing is that for all the diversity<br />
of our nation, we are still a united people in a cohesive<br />
community. We are linked together by the strong bonds of our shared<br />
adherence to the institutions and practices of parliamentary<br />
democracy, and by our shared tolerant acceptance of<br />
individual freedoms within the rule of law in short, we<br />
are united by our shared commitment to Australia.<br />
As a political leader, it is my obligation to ensure that<br />
this commitment remains an abiding element of Australia' s<br />
national character.<br />
I I </p>
<p>I say this for two reasons.<br />
The first is obvious. Australia cannot afford to slide into<br />
the tragic circumstances that afflict other parts of the<br />
world, by allowing racial, ethnic or sectarian divisions to<br />
destroy our harmony, our productivity and our way of life.<br />
The reverse is equally true and equally important. By<br />
showing that people of diverse cultures can live together<br />
with tolerance, in a productive and harmonious community, we<br />
will be providing a model to the world and earning the<br />
respect of the international community.<br />
The internationalisation of the world economy, the<br />
development of global telecommunications networks, the<br />
growth of service-based industries such as tourism and<br />
education these are all making a reality of the " global<br />
village". In such a world, our links of trade, cultural exchange and<br />
people-to-people contact are reinforced by our being a truly<br />
multicultural community.<br />
And as a society that has for more than four decades<br />
fulfilled our humanitarian obligations to provide safe haven<br />
for people displaced by war and hardship in their own<br />
countries, we have earned international respect And<br />
influence.<br />
These broader benefits of immigration are very difficult to<br />
quantify in a strict econometric sense.<br />
But they are real benefits and enduring ones nonetheless.<br />
So I urge you in your deliberations at this Conference to<br />
cast the net of your inquiry and discussion as wide as<br />
possible. The real questions are: what kind of Australia do we want to<br />
live in and bequeath to our children? And in what ways can<br />
an immigration program help us build that kind of Australia?<br />
Having posed the questions, let me answer them in this way.<br />
I want to see an Australia with a modern growing economy; an<br />
Australia that is self-confidently enmeshed in the world<br />
economy and the dynamism of our own region; an Australia<br />
renowned for the quality of its life, not just the quantity<br />
of its economic output; an Australia speaking in the forums<br />
of the world with an independent voice to help shape a<br />
better world; and Australia that vibrantly and fully<br />
reflects the truth that all people are entitled to equal<br />
opportunity irrespective of colour, race or creed. </p>
<p>9<br />
With those goals, there is no doubt in my mind of the<br />
positive and enriching contribution to be made by a<br />
continuing immigration program, harnessing the skills of the<br />
people of the world to build a stronger Australian economy<br />
and drawing on the strength of their cultural traditions to<br />
build a confident, dynamic and culturally diverse Australia. </p>
