FOR PRESS: 13NOV 1967 P. M. No. 116/ 1967<br />
VICTORIAN BUSHFIRE ASSISTANCE<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, Mr. Harold Holt<br />
I have been in touch with the Army authorities to ask<br />
them to hold themselves in readiness in case of requests from<br />
Victoria for assistance in fighting the bushfires.<br />
I spoke to the Victorian Premier, Sir Henry Bolte. this<br />
afternoon and told him that if help was needed, he would find the<br />
Commonwealth only too willing to be of such assistance as might<br />
be required. Sir Henry expressed appreciation for the offer. Help<br />
has not been sought at this stage.<br />
CANBERRA October, 1967. </p>
