BLOODHORSE BREEDERS1 ASSOCIATION OF AUSTRALIA<br />
DINNER AT HOTEL AUSTRALIA, SYDNEY<br />
23RD MARCH, 1264<br />
Speech by the Prime Minister., the-Rt. Hon. Sir Robert Menzies<br />
Mr, Chairman and Distinguished Colleagues at the Top Table,<br />
excluding Alister McMullin, and Gentlemen<br />
I am here under false pretences. Part of them is<br />
attributable to Alister McMullin and part of them to myself<br />
because this man McMullin who masquerades as the President of<br />
the Senate and I must say in past experience, can always be<br />
relied on to vote the right way ( Laughter) has for some years<br />
said to me, " Why don't you come to the Bloodhorse Breeders?<br />
annual dinner?" and I'v said, " Oh, Alister, you know really<br />
with great respect I notoriously know nothing a bout it, Even<br />
my political opponents regard me as being rather inbred."<br />
( Laughter, applause) Though as a matter of fact, I'm not; the<br />
lines are good. Then this time he came around in that disarming<br />
manner that people acquire in the Senate. After all, they have<br />
nothing else to do ( Laughter), except to acquire a disarming<br />
manner. And he said, " Now, I wish you'd come. They are all<br />
friends of mine" which I thought was a pretty bold remark.<br />
( Laughter) and " 21ou know, it will be an easy, informal evening."<br />
He gave me to understand, though I can't pin him to the words,<br />
that there would be no speeches, and I thought, wellq I have<br />
always wanted to go to a dinner where there were no speeches.<br />
Of course, it turned out that he had deceived me, Well, I have<br />
put him in possession of my views on that matter.<br />
But the other aspect in which I am here under false<br />
pretences is entirely due to me. If you wanted to produce as an<br />
exhibit tonight a man whose degree of ignorance was perfection<br />
( Laughter), then you've picked the right man, The Chairman was<br />
good enough to make a reference to the fact that my distinguished<br />
colleague, the Treasurer knows something about this business and<br />
has been seen from time to time at great events. Well back in<br />
191+ 0 I think it was, Harold Holt spoke to me and he sail., " You<br />
know, old man, it's all right about this cricket business and so<br />
on. Dontt you realise that the greatest cross-section of the<br />
community is to be found at a racecourse. You must go to<br />
Caulfield," ( I think it was to the Cup) Well, there was an<br />
election somewhere in the offing, ( Laughter) and I succumbed and<br />
I went, and it was very agreeable. We had a splendid lunch with<br />
the Committee and one of the oddities about me is that I always<br />
know all the members of the Committee though I don't know what is<br />
going on, In due course, the main event was to occur, and in the<br />
meantime I met a very well known man in Melbourne who was a great<br />
friend o1 mine, and we wandered off across the lawn and stood near<br />
some rosebushes and got deep into conversation no doubt, as I<br />
was a party to it, frightfully highbrow. And it happened that when<br />
the main race was being run, we were so deep in conversation that<br />
we had our backs to the track and there we were and the moment the<br />
race was over, Harold Holt came across to me and said, " I'm sorry,<br />
old man, never come again." ( Laughter) What I have designed as<br />
something that would build us up for the next election, you've<br />
converted into a positive disaster." So there you are. This<br />
demonstrates what a hopeless exhibit I am, but still I am not<br />
unaccustomed to this. There are a few things in life that I know<br />
something about. Occasionally I get the opportunity of talking<br />
about them. But most of the honorific things that have come to me have<br />
come in the most queer garb. For example, when I arrived in Sydney<br />
this afternoon, I was wearing a lovely green necktie with coats of </p>
<p>-2<br />
arms on it and somebody said, " What is that?" I said, " I would<br />
have you know that I am a Fellow of the Royal Australian College<br />
of Surgeons." This just rocked them because since I was a small<br />
boy in the country and chopped the head off a chook occasionally,.<br />
I have never performed any surgical operations whatever and now<br />
I am a Fellow of the Royal Australian College of Surgeons. I am<br />
a physician. ( Laughter) I cantt heal even a break in the Party.<br />
( Laughter) ( Applause) The last time we had a Prime Minister's<br />
Conference in London, I was taken away at the end of one afternoon<br />
and taken around, on due warning, to the Royal College of<br />
Gynaecologists and Obstetricians'and I was made a Fellow of the<br />
College. I had to turn side on and explain that my position was<br />
somewhat ambiguous because they might not know whether I was<br />
there as a patient or as a practitioner ( Laughter). If I were<br />
called on by an angry wife to build a dog kennel the kennel would<br />
fall over within five minutes, but I am an archiiect, Understand<br />
this, gentlemen? This is one of the few joys of public life to<br />
be a physician, a surgeon, a gynecologist, an obstetrician, an<br />
architect, a builder yes, I'm a builder I'm a plumber, and<br />
therefore I am not unaccustomed to masquerading in a sort of<br />
false capacity and I hope that these fellows like young Maloney<br />
hero tonight, or even young Bob Heffron, if he were here, will<br />
not use this against me because life is something of a masquerade.<br />
But the one thing that I would like to say to you is<br />
this, that ignorant as I am, brutishly ignorant as I am of the<br />
fine points of your great enterprises like all amateurs, I have<br />
my moments. L-4 the old days when we iravelled by train at the<br />
weekend to Melbourne and back on Sunday nights, I had two people<br />
on my staff and a then Chairman of Committees of the House of<br />
Representatives who sat in the same compartment and who read<br />
pink papers all the way from Albury to Melbourne. They all had<br />
lead pencils and they were, I understood, engaged in that rather<br />
esoteric exercise of studying form ( Laughter) and by the time<br />
we were within twenty miles of Melbourne they would turn to me<br />
hopefully and sayI " Well, what do you think will win the main<br />
race today?" I would say " Well, how would I knogi. Give me<br />
your papers." And I woulci look at them and by some metaphorical<br />
process of putting a pin in a piece of paper, I would say, " O0h,<br />
Dogsbody, of course, obviously will win today. Dogsbody is<br />
improving right along the line." And Dcgsbody used to win.<br />
( Laughter) I usad to receive the most tremendous accolades from<br />
my staff for this almost diabolical knowledge that I hod of form.<br />
I have lived a long time and I have been in politics<br />
a long time and I've been Prime Minister now for an almost<br />
deplorable amount of time and I had enough sense to know that<br />
when I had done that four times running, that wns the time to<br />
retire ( Laughter) and never again did I offer any advice.<br />
But I have been talking tonight to Mr. Crowley about<br />
your great exercise. Very international. He has had people<br />
here from a number of Asian countries. I venture to believe,<br />
knowing some of the people concerned in it, that Australian<br />
racing authorities have done an enormous service to racing right<br />
round the world. ( Applause) That is not to say that they would<br />
ever take me with them except as " Exhibit A" l, but really it is<br />
a fascinating thing in a world in which, so many occasions of<br />
difference arise, so many brawls going on either public or<br />
subdued, so many quarrels, so many well alivertised differences<br />
of opinion things that really make you feel anxious about the<br />
future of Lhe world, that one of the great counterbalancing<br />
activities has been international sport in its various forms.<br />
( Applause) This is true. I hope I won't be thought to blaspheme<br />
if I refer to the fact that we have recently had a cricket team<br />
here from South Africa. Now, there have been all sorts of </p>
<p>-3-<br />
arguments about South Afr~ ca. Nobody i~ n Australia who saw them<br />
or met them will argue about the superb quality of the South<br />
African cricketers, tLheir courtesy, their character. They were<br />
tremendous diplomatic representatives of' their own country.<br />
( Applause) As you move around the world, as I do from time to time<br />
at your expense, once a year, sometimes twice a year you really<br />
become astonished to realise how many of these sporting activities,<br />
games activities, are going on which tend to bring nations<br />
together. Sometimes they don't of course, sometimes there is a<br />
bit of a brawl and of course a brawl is something that is<br />
completely foreign to my nature. But by and large, all round the<br />
world there are more and more people who think of another country<br />
in terms of their own particular sport, whether it is racing,<br />
whether it's cricket, whether it's soccer, whether it's football,<br />
whatever it may be, and this is to me one of the great hopes of<br />
the world because I don't believe that we will ever solve international<br />
problems by cold reason. I don't think they will ever<br />
be solved by the people who write books and who conduct dialectical<br />
exercises. They will increasingly bp solved if we understand<br />
each other, if people around the world get to understand that<br />
exciting truth that human beings are human beings wherever they<br />
may be ( Applause) This is a tremendous and exciting thing.<br />
Whether it means that in some far-flung corner of the earth I have<br />
to encounter by accident some deplorable character like Bill Dovey<br />
and say, " How are you, Bill?" and he says " Have a look at this<br />
next race"; I have a look at it and wonder what on earth has<br />
happened. Whether it's that way or on a cricket field or on a<br />
football ground, whatever it may be, even in the field of lawn<br />
tennis ( Laughter) if I may refer to such a non-controversial<br />
matter ( Laughter), in all of these things I believe that the<br />
world makes progress because the world ge'is to understand itself<br />
and the people of the world get to understand each other better.<br />
This is, I think, a matter of great moment.<br />
And soI Sir I hope you will allow me to make my apology.<br />
Everybody knows thai almost on everything that matters I am<br />
completely ignorant. I never attend a businessmen's dinner, whether<br />
it is manufacturing or commerce without being given to understand<br />
that while I am an agreeaible sort of fellow it is a pity I don't<br />
understand what's going on in their particular world. But the<br />
longer I live and I have now lived a fair time or an unfair<br />
time the longer I live the more I realise that the proper study<br />
of mankind is man and that the proper answer to most of our<br />
problems is to know the other fellow, to understand the other<br />
fellow, because the moment you do that, reconciliation becomes so<br />
much easier. Now of course, there are a lot of seriously-rainded people<br />
in the world who regard sport as something a little below the<br />
salt. You musn't be too interested in horse-racing in cricket<br />
of something of that kind this won't do, this lacks gravity.<br />
I think the world has had enough gravity, quite enough to carry<br />
it on for a long time. What the world needs is a growing sense<br />
of fun and happiness and it is because I feel that way that I<br />
was cajoled by Alister McMullin into coming and, as it turns out,<br />
if I may say So, have enjoyed myself enormously. </p>
