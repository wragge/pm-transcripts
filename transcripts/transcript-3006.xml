J) A USTR A 1. A PRESS STATEMENT NO. 129<br />
13 September 1973<br />
RECENT EVENTS IN CHILE<br />
The Prime Minister, Mr. Whitlam, said today that<br />
the news of the violent overthrow of the constitutionally<br />
elected Government of Chile, and the tragic death of President<br />
Allende, would come as a profound shock to the Australian<br />
people. Mr. Whitlam said that, as a democrat and a socialist,<br />
he had been greatly saddened that men who had sworn to uphold<br />
the constitution of their country had betrayed a long and noble<br />
Chilean democratic tradition of which Salvador Allende had been<br />
the authentic representative.<br />
Mr. Whitlam said that he had instructed the Department<br />
of Foreign Affairs to report to him on the reaction in the<br />
countries of the area to the events of the last few days. In<br />
the light of those reports the Government would consider its<br />
future relations with Chile.<br />
