PRIME MINISTER<br />
SPEAKING NOTES FOR USE BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
AT THE 1984 WALKLEY AWARDS<br />
8 NOVEM4BER 1984<br />
I am very pleased to have been asked to join you tonight<br />
on the occasion of the 1984 W. G. Walkley National Awards<br />
for Australian Journalism.<br />
I particularly welcome this opportunity to acknowledge the<br />
best work of our journalists in the past year. I am<br />
tempted indeed to suggest an award for outstanding<br />
achievements on the cricket field. But then some would<br />
say I might be one-eyed on that matter.<br />
What I do see more clearly is that your profession counts<br />
among its ranks some of the best and most dedicated<br />
Australians at work today. I say this not because I<br />
believe I have received even-handed, fair and generous<br />
treatment at your hands this has certainly not always<br />
been the case. Rather I do so because I strongly believe<br />
Australia is on the whole well served by its journalists.<br />
Australians should all fully appreciate the contribution<br />
made by many of our journalists to the maintenance of a<br />
vigorous, thriving Australian democracy. Without a<br />
constructively critical, probing media Australia would be<br />
a less productive, less-dynamic and I believe less healthy<br />
society.<br />
The role of the practising journalist has evolved<br />
incredibly over the course of the last 30 years. When Si~ r<br />
William Walkley instituted these awards in 1956 television<br />
had just been introduced to Australia and the print media<br />
were the dominant outlet.<br />
Even only 12 years ago we are reminded in Laurie Qakes'<br />
and David Solomon's book " The Making of an Australian<br />
Prime Minister" Joe Chamberlain had to be persuaded to<br />
cancel a public meeting in favour of a Whitlam television<br />
appearance. Today the crucial role of the electronic<br />
media in campaigning is recognised by everyone.<br />
Some regret this and particularly its associated emphasis<br />
on image, personality and the short grab. Others, I think<br />
quite rightly, appreciate that it is only through the<br />
electronic media that many in our community are regularly<br />
involved with the political process. </p>
<p>2.<br />
This is not to underestimate the vital role! Of the print<br />
media. Their careful analysis of issues is critical to an<br />
adequate, well-informed community understanding of<br />
government policies and programs. Their role in drawing<br />
attention to emerging community concerns and<br />
preoccupations is also indispensable to the! Government's.<br />
ability adequately to cater for the needs of society.<br />
Through the media the people get access to their political<br />
leaders. Talk-back radio presents unparallelled<br />
opportunities for anyone and everyone to put a view.<br />
Talk-back is sometimes an arduous experience, certainly<br />
more than question-time in Parliament has been recently,<br />
but as a vehicle through which community leaders can<br />
better understand the nation's issues and concerns, it is<br />
invaluable. Obviously it is also a great help to any<br />
politician wanting to get his point across.<br />
One thing that journalists and politicians share is<br />
pressure. We political leaders are legitimately subject<br />
to constant probing scrutiny by the media. You the<br />
journalists must also satisfy the people's requirement for<br />
quick, reliable and thorough presentation of the facts and<br />
for the stories that lie behind the facts. I am reminded<br />
of Lord Curzon's observation;<br />
" I hesitate to say what the functions of the<br />
modern journalist may be; but I imagine that<br />
they do not exclude the intelligent anticipation<br />
of facts even before they occur."<br />
Whatever the pressure, however, the demands of the moment,<br />
the attractions of the sensational scoop should not be<br />
allowed to obscure the heavy responsibilities of the<br />
media. Sometimes a sense of social responsibility and<br />
very occasionally a wider sense of the national interestwill<br />
require that journalists forego a " good story".<br />
Ideally I would like to think such judgements would be<br />
made by the media themselves.<br />
There is a very special relationship between Governments<br />
and the media. Governments need to have community<br />
understanding and involvement in their programs. In large<br />
measure we depend on the media for success in this<br />
endeavour. The media in turn need reasonable access to<br />
information if they are properly and accurately to present<br />
and interpret matters of interest to the country. It is<br />
. recognition of this necessarily close, almost symbiotic<br />
relationship between government and media between<br />
government and the country at large that has motivated<br />
this Government's commitment to open government.<br />
I believe the present Labor Government has set new<br />
standards of openness.. It has done so in a highly<br />
responsible way thus contributing greatly to the<br />
unprecedented confidence that now marks relations between<br />
the Government and the country at large. </p>
<p>3.<br />
Our media need to be of the highest standard.<br />
Appropriately the Walkleys give recognition to the<br />
outstanding achievements within the media in any one year.<br />
All the winners of this year's Walkleys have shown the<br />
special skill which is the hallmark of the outstanding<br />
journalist.<br />
To all the winners of these awards and to those whose work<br />
has been highly commended, my heartiest congratulations. </p>
