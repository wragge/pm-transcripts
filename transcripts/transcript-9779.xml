PRIME MINISTER<br />
*** PLEASE CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY***<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING, MP<br />
THE NAB ETHNIC BUSINESS AWARDS, MELBOURNE<br />
4 OCTOBER 1995<br />
Recently the World Bank measured our vast natural resources against our<br />
small population and declared that Australians are the richest people on<br />
Earth. I think we were all a bit startled by this, even though I also think that in some<br />
ways we are even wealthier than the World Bank knows.<br />
But we shouldn't read their report too literally. Wealth can be measured in a<br />
number of ways, and this way points as much to the potential as the reality.<br />
I think we should read it as a reminder that the potential is there to make<br />
Australia one of the truly prosperous and fair societies of the 21st century.<br />
It reminds us that reaching our potential depends on us on the Australian<br />
people. On what we do with this continent and its wealth, its environment, its<br />
culture and heritage, its place in what has become the most dynamic region<br />
on earth.<br />
And tonight is also a reminder of that.<br />
No policy adopted by Australian government since Federation has done more<br />
to fulfil our potential than the post-war migration programs.<br />
We very often talk about our cultural diversity as if it were purely cultural as<br />
if it were primarily a matter of food and festivals.<br />
Yet, whether they were British and Irish migrants in the 19th century, or<br />
central and southern European migrants in the last half of the 20th, the real<br />
measure of their contribution is in their energy and vision in their industry<br />
and entrepreneurship. </p>
<p>And in the affection and loyalty they developed for this country.<br />
Australia's cultural diversity is indeed one of the great advantages of being a<br />
contemporary Australian. Our social cohesion is one of our great assets.<br />
And no less are we served by the ambition, dedication and skills of migrant<br />
businessmen and women. Think of some of the great businesses of post-war<br />
Australia and a lot of non-Anglo Saxon names come to mind people who<br />
came here from their devastated homelands, who cut the painter with their<br />
past, and made this the home of their hopes and ambitions.<br />
And we have all profited from their efforts.<br />
Tonight we pay tribute to the people who are continuing this tradition. People<br />
who are making their lives here, investing their energy in Australia.<br />
These awards recognise the role that our cultural diversity can play in our<br />
economic future.<br />
We have with us tonight people from all over the world who live and run<br />
businesses in Australia.<br />
Who all pursue their personal ambitions and serve the Australian national<br />
enterprise. That's the key the key to multiculturalism, and the key to Australia's future.<br />
Individual enterprise, collective spirit. Different cultures, one nation.<br />
Let me thank all those responsible for organising this evening especially the<br />
National Australia Bank.<br />
Let me congratulate the business people who are receiving tonight's awards<br />
and those countless others who every day pursue their hopes and ambitions<br />
in Australia and serve their country well. </p>
