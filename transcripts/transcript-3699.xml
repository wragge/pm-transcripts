ADDRESS BY THE PRIME MINISTER, MR E, G, WHITLAM, M. P.,<br />
TO THE AUSTRALIAN LABOR PARTY STATE COUNCIL, NSW. BRANCH,<br />
SYDNEY, 13 APRIL, 1975<br />
SINCE I ADDRESSED YOU LAST YEAR, OUR OPPONENTS HAVE<br />
CHANGED LEADERS BOTH IN NEW SOUTH WALES AND IN CANBERRA.<br />
THE INTERESTING THING IS THAT THE NEW LIBERAL LEADER IN<br />
PLAYED A CENTRAL ROLE IN DESTROYING THE FEDERAL<br />
LIBERAL LEADERX I DON'T WANT TO GET STUCK INTO MR SNEDDEN,<br />
BUT THERE ARE IMPORTANT LESSONS TO BE DRAWN FROM WHAT WAS<br />
DONE TO HIMX THERE ARE LESSONS NOT ONLY TO BE LEARNT BY<br />
THE LIBERALS BUT BY USX<br />
A BASIC WEAKNESS IN MR SNEDDEN' S POSITION WAS HIS<br />
INABILITY TO ESTABLISH A SOUND RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE<br />
STATE NON-LABOR PARTIES AND THE FEDERAL LIBERAL PARTYy<br />
PARTICULARLY AFTER THE QUEENSLAND ELECTIONS IN DECEMBER, THE<br />
STATE NON-LABOR LEADERS THOUGHT THE EASY WAY FOR THEM, THE<br />
CHEAP ROAD TO POLITICAL POPULARITY WAS JUST TO KNOCK CANBERRA,<br />
TO BE AS UNCO-OPERATIVE AS POSSIBLEX MR SNEDDEN FELL INTO<br />
THEIR TRAPX HE HAS PAID THE HEAVIEST POSSIBLE POLITICAL<br />
PRICE FOR LETTING HIS STATE COLLEAGUES MAKE THE RUNNING''<br />
2/, </p>
<p>-2-<br />
WHEN THE SENATE VACANCY OCCURRED WITH LIONEL<br />
MURPHY'S MOVE TO THE HIGH COURT BENCH THERE WAS ONLY<br />
ONE PROPER COURSE OPEN TO THE NEW LIBERAL PREMIER OF<br />
NS. W. AND TO THE NS. W. PARLIAMENT THAT WAS TO<br />
OBSERVE THE ESTABLISHED CONVENTION AND TO APPOINT A<br />
LABOR REPLACEMENT ANY OTHER COURSE NOT ONLY SET ASIDE<br />
A VALUABLE CONVENTION BUT SET ASIDE THE CLEAR WISHES OF<br />
THE PEOPLE OF N. S. W. RECORDED AT THE DOUBLE DISSOLUTION<br />
LAST IIAYX MR LEWIS THOUGHT HE COULD PLAY IT SMART4<br />
MR SNEDDEN KNEW WHAT THE RIGHT COURSE WAS, BUT FAILED TO<br />
BRING MR LEWIS INTO LINEX MORE THAN ANY OTHER FACTOR, THAT<br />
FAILURE SPARKED THE EVENTS WHICH LED TO MR SNEDDEN'S DOWNFALL<br />
AS LEADERX HIS FAILURE TO ASSERT ANY AUTHORITY AS THE<br />
NATIONAL LIBERAL LEADER, HIS SURRENDER TO MR LEWIS'<br />
MAVERICK BEHAVIOUR, GAVE HIS OPPONENTS IN THE LIBERAL PARTY<br />
THE AMMUNITION THEY NEEDED TO SHOOT HIM DOWN AND THEY DIDX<br />
NOW THERE IS A LESSON FOR US ALL TO LEARN. AFTER<br />
THE QUEENSLAND ELECTIONS, AND WHEN THE POLLS BEGAN TO GO<br />
AGAINST US THERE WERE SOME PEOPLE IN THE STATE BRANCHES WHO<br />
THOUGHT THAT THE SAFE COURSE WAS TO GO IT ALONE, TO STAND<br />
ASIDE FROM A LABOR GOVERNMENT IN CANBERRAX 14OW THE FACT<br />
IS THE STATE PARTIES, WHETHER THEY BE LABOR OR LIBERAL,<br />
CANNOT LIVE TO THEMSELVESX FOR GOOD OR ILL THE PEOPLE ARE<br />
GOING TO JUDGE THE PARTIES AS ONEK </p>
<p>-3-<br />
IT IS TRUE OF BOTH THE GREAT PARTIES BUT ESPECIALLY TRUE<br />
OF THE LABOR PARTYX No MEMBER, NO CANDIDATE, NO LEADER<br />
WILL GET ANY KUDOS FROM THE PUBLIC BY JOINING ANY CHORUS<br />
AGAINST CANBERRAA IT IS EASY ENOUGH; BUT IT IS DECEPTIVELY<br />
EASY BECAUSE THE PEOPLE ARE NOT AT ALL IMPRESSED* THEY<br />
KNOW THAT THE LABOR GOVERNMENT IS CARRYING OUT THE PROGRAM<br />
OF THE AUSTRALIAN LABOR PARTY ONE PROGRAM, FOR ONE PARTYK<br />
WE ARE ALL GOING TO BE JUDGED BY OUR SUCCESS OR FAILURE<br />
WITH THE PROGRAMA WE WILL SUCCEED WITH THE PROGRAM TO THE<br />
EXTENT THAT THE WHOLE PARTY AT ALL LEVELS GETS BEHIND IT<br />
AND GOES OUT TO SELL ITX<br />
THERE ARE TWO ASPECTS ABOUT THE PROGRAM WHICH CALL<br />
FOR A SPECIAL EFFORT BY ALL MEMBERS TO PROMOTE IT4 ONE<br />
IS THAT A GREAT MANY OF OUR PROGRAMS ARE FIRST. DESIGNED TO<br />
BENEFIT THOSE IN THE COMMUNITY WHO CAN'T SPEAK FOR<br />
THEMSELVES OR WHO CAN'T MAKE THEIR VOICES HEARD VERY WELL)<br />
ANOTHER ASPECT IS THAT SOME VERY IMPORTANT ISSUES LIKE<br />
EQUAL ELECTORATES AND EQUAL REPRESENTATION DON'T ALWAYS<br />
MAKE AN IMMEDIATE OR DRAMATIC APPEAL TO THE IMAGINATION OF<br />
THE GENERAL PUBLIC OR, IT MUST BE SAID, FOR OUR OWN* MEMBERS<br />
AND SUPPORTERS4 </p>
<p>-4-<br />
THE PROGRAMS MOST LIKELY TO BE CHALLENGED, THE<br />
PROGRAMS MOST LIKELY TO BE REVERSED BY OUR OPPONENTS ARE<br />
THOSE WHICH BENEFIT THE INARTICULATE UNDER-PRIVILEGEDA<br />
THE PROGRAMS MARKED FOR THE AXE ARE THOSE WHICH BENEFIT<br />
THOSE WITH THE LEAST POLITICAL LEVERAGE) MR FRASER HAS<br />
ALREADY MADE IT PLAIN THAT HE WILL CAMPAIGN FOR MASSIVE<br />
CUTS IN GOVERNMENT SPENDING No MORE THAN HIS PREDECESSOR<br />
WILL HE BE VERY SPECIFIC ABOUT THE AREAS IN WHICH HE WOULD<br />
MAKE THOSE CUTSX BUT THE IRRESISTIBLE LOGIC THE LOGIC<br />
OF ECONOMICS, THE LOGIC OF POLITICS IS THAT THE CUTS<br />
WOULD BE MADE IN THE POLITICALLY EXPENDABLE AREASK<br />
WHO IS POLITICALLY EXPENDABLE FOR MR FRASER? ALL<br />
THOSE UNDER-PRIVILEGED GROUPS WHO WERE ENTIRELY NEGLECTED<br />
IN THEIR 23 YEARS, WHOSE NEEDS WE HAVE TRIED TO IDENTIFY<br />
AND TO MEETX THERE IS ALREADY A READY-MADE LIST OF<br />
EXPENDABLE PROGRAMS THE PROGRAMS IMPERILLED BY THE HIGH<br />
COURT CHALLENGE, ON THE CONSTITUTIONAL VALIDITY OF THE<br />
AUSTRALIAN ASSISTANCE PLAN AND THE REGIONAL EMPLOYMENT<br />
DEVELOPMENT SCHEMEX THE CHALLENGE WAS INITIATED BY THE<br />
VICTORIAN GOVERNMENT, AND IS SUPPORTED BY THE N. S. W.<br />
GOVERNMENTX ALL THESE PROGRAMS BENEFIT THE RELATIVELY<br />
INARTICULATE OR UNDER-PRIVILEGEDK THE BENEFICIARIES ARE,<br />
FOR THE MOST PART, SCARCELY IN A POSITION TO SPEAK UP FOR<br />
THEMSELVESK THIS IS WHY THEY, AS OUR FELLOW-CITIZENS, ARE<br />
SO VULNERABLEX THIS IS WHY PROGRAMS DESIGNED TO BENEFIT THEM<br />
ARE, POLITICALLY, SO VULNERABLE.<br />
q 4 </p>
<p>IF WE DON'T SPEAK UP FOR THOSE PROGRAMS, IF WE<br />
DON'T SPEAK UP FOR THE PEOPLE WHO WOULD BE DEPRIVED BY<br />
THEIR ABOLITION, THEN NO-ONE ELSE WILLK<br />
IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO FIND ANY CONSISTENCY IN THE<br />
APPROACH OF. THE N. S. W. GOVERNMENT TO OUR PROGRAMS4 IT<br />
WOULD BE WRONG FOR ME TO GIVE THE IMPRESSION THAT THE<br />
STORY HAS BEEN ONE OF TOTAL NON-COOPERATIONX THERE HAS,<br />
IN FACT, BEEN A GREAT DEAL OF CO-OPERATION, ALTHOUGH THERE<br />
HAS TOO OFTEN BEEN NEEDLESS DELAY EVEN IN AREAS WHERE THE<br />
NS. W, GOVERNMENT HAS ULTIMATELY DECIDED TO COME TO THE<br />
PARTYX IT WOULD BE CHURLISH NOT TO ACKNOWLEDGE ONE MATTER<br />
IN WHICH THERE HAS BEEN PRAISEWORTHY CO-OPERATION FROM THE<br />
NSW. GOVERNMENT MAKING AVAILABLE HIGHLY QUALIFIED PEOPLE<br />
TO ASSIST IN AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT INQUIRIES AND COMMISSIONSX<br />
A NOTABLE EXAMPLE WAS THE WORK OF MR JUSTICE MEARES OF THE<br />
SUPREME COURT ASSISTING SIR OWEN WOODHOUSE OF THE NEW<br />
ZEALAND COURT OF APPEAL ON THE COMMITTEE OF INQUIRY ON<br />
NATIONAL COMPENSATIONX<br />
I MAY SAY THERE HAS BEEN IN CERTAIN SECTIONS OF THE<br />
MOVEMENT A DISAPPOINTING LACK OF SUPPORT FOR OUR PROPOSALS)<br />
WE HAVE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT FOR A PARTY OF CHANGE AND REFORM<br />
THERE IS, SURPRISINGLY, A GREAT DEAL OF CONSERVATISM WITHIN<br />
OUR RANKSX </p>
<p>-6-<br />
THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO THINK THAT JUST BECAUSE CERTAIN<br />
FORMS OF COMPENSATION EXIST THROUGH THIRD PARTY INSURANCE<br />
AND WORKERS COMPENSATION THEN NOTHING MORE NEED BE DONEK<br />
" WHATE'ER EXISTS IS RIGHT" AN AMAZING ATTITUDE TO BE<br />
FOUND IN A REFORMING PARTY) THE FACT IS THAT THE EXISTING<br />
SCHEMES LEAVE THOUSANDS UNPROTECTED FOR EXAMPLE, PEOPLE<br />
WHO ARE INJURED AT HOME, MANY OF THEM WOMENX OUR SCHEME<br />
WILL COMPENSATE AND REHABILITATE PEOPLE WHO ARE INJURED OR<br />
BECOME ILL ANYWHERE. AS I SAID IN THE POLICY SPEECH OF<br />
1972: " WE WILL ESTABLISH A NATIONAL COMPENSATION SCHEME<br />
TO REDUCE THE HARDSHIPS IMPOSED BY ONE OF THE GREAT<br />
FACTORS FOR INEQUALITY IN SOCIETY INEQUALITY OF LUCK." I<br />
HERE AGAIN THE BENEFICIARIES OF A LABOUR REFORM ARE NOT<br />
WELL-ORGANISED AND ARE NOT ABLE TO DRUM UP PRESSURE, BY<br />
CONTRAST THE OPPONENTS OR OBSTRUCTIONISTS ARE WELL-ORGANISED<br />
SOME UNIONS, LAWYERS, INSURANCE COMPANIESX SOME-ONE HAS TO<br />
SPEAK UP FOR THOSE WHO ARE NOT IN A POSITION TO MAKE THEIR<br />
VOICES HEARD IN ANY POWERFUL OR WELL-ORGANISED WAYK THAT<br />
IS A JOB FOR ALL OF US IN THE LABOR PARTY, NOT JUST A FEW<br />
MINISTERS4 i </p>
<p>THIS IS NOT ONLY A MORAL OBLIGATION FOR MEMBERS<br />
OF A PARTY LIKE OURSELVES; IT'S NOT JUST AN OBLIGATION<br />
WE HAVE BECAUSE THESE PROGRAMS ARE PART OF OUR PLEDGES<br />
PUT TWICE TO THE PEOPLE STRONG SUPPORT FOR THESE PROGRAMS<br />
MAKES SOUND POLITICAL SENSE AT THE STATE LEVEL AS WELL AS<br />
THE NATIONAL LEVEL THERE IS NO DIVIDEND FOR STATE BRANCHES<br />
IN DOWNGRADING NATIONAL PROGRAMS OR TRYING TO DRAW A<br />
DISTINCTION BETWEEN STATE AND NATIONAL POLICIESK THE WAY<br />
TO WIN A N. S. W. STATE ELECTION IS TO SHOW THAT A STATE<br />
LABOR GOVERNMENT WILL CO-OPERATE IN THE AREAS AND THE PROGRAMS<br />
WHERE THE LEWIS GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN INACTIVE OR OBSTRUCTIVE<br />
WHEN THE PEOPLE HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN SOLID PROGRAMS, SOLID<br />
BENEFITS AND SLOGANS OR SHIBBOLETHS ABOUT STATE RIGHTS, THEY<br />
WILL COME DOWN ON THE SIDE OF THE GENUINE ARTICLE, BUT THEYHAVE<br />
TO KNOW WHAT THE CHOICE REALLY ISAND THAT MEANS THAT<br />
ALL OF US HAVE TO PUT THE CASE AS FULLY AND FORCEFULLY AS<br />
WE CANS SILENCE, OBSTRUCTION, CONSERVATISM OR TIMIDITY ON<br />
SUCH MATTERS AS NATIONAL COMPENSATION OR EQUAL ELECTORATES<br />
WILL NOT GAIN VOTES IN A STATE ELECTION NOT LEAST BECAUSE<br />
THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT, AND I MYSELF, WILL NOT CEASE TO<br />
ADVOCATE THEM.( WE ARE NOT GOING TO BACK-TRACK ON'THEPLATFORM<br />
OR ON THE UNDERTAKING GIVEN IN THE POLICY SPEECHESX<br />
WE HAVE NO ALTERNATIVE; IT IS A COMMITMENT WE CANNOT ESCAPE?\<br />
IT IS A COMMITMENT FOR THE WHOLE PARTY; IT IS A COMMITMENT<br />
THAT NO-ONE IN THE PARTY CAN ESCAPE
