ANNUAL CONFERENCE OF THE GRAZIERS' ASSOCIATION<br />
HELD IN SYDNEY ON 9TH MARCH, 1964<br />
Speech by the Prir. e Miniter. the Rt, Hon. Sir Robert Menzies<br />
Sir and Ladies and Gentlemen<br />
You know, Mr. McMaster is quite right I said I<br />
would be very pleased to be here, and then a little bit later on,<br />
somebody said, " Well, the Queen Mother is not able to come out to<br />
Adelaide to open the'Fostival, They would like you to open it",<br />
and I said, " Oh, yes, I would be very pleased to do that", not<br />
looking at the dates, Then somebody else said, " We'd like you to<br />
make a powerful speech for about an hour on Sunday night to an<br />
Administrative Staff College in Victoria" and once more, not looking<br />
at dates, I said, " Yes, I would be delighted," Then somebody<br />
said, " We would like you to make a great speech at the College of<br />
Surgeons and lay a foundation stone on Friday," and I said, " Yes,<br />
I would be very pleased to do it", and so here I am, pleased for<br />
the fourth time in the third State ( Laughter) in one weekend.<br />
But I must say, Sir. that I really am pleased to be<br />
here not only because I have happy memories of the last time I<br />
spoke hero but also because I think that there are one or two<br />
matters that the Graziers' Association and the Prime Minister,<br />
whoever he may be, ought to discuss together from time to time<br />
because this is, in a sense and I don't need to say it to you,<br />
the age of slogans0 Somebody coins a phrase, somebody prints it,<br />
somebody quotes it and before long I am hearing it on all sides,<br />
The fact that it is wrong doesn't seem to matter very much. Among<br />
The ptvrases that have been enjoying some currency in Australia in<br />
the last few years is one that I just want to say a few words about<br />
because I won't detain you unduly,<br />
It has been put on a variety of occasions to me and<br />
to other people that there is an inevitable conflict between<br />
stability and growth, These are the very words in which it was<br />
last put to me and I raised an interrogative eyebrow and demanded<br />
some evidence of the truth of this proposition and because the<br />
fact that I questioned it seem. d to be regarded as rather<br />
remarkable, I would like to question it now with you, and give my<br />
reasons, What they say is that there is an inevitable conflict<br />
between stability and growth. Now, of course, this statement<br />
begins by being hopeless because you are dealing with two utterly<br />
different matters. Growth in Australia is a physical matter<br />
growth because we will have more land under cultivation growth<br />
because we will produce more wool growth because we will have<br />
more minerals discovered and developed and used growth because<br />
we will have greater and better water supply growth because we<br />
will have more roads, more basic industries established on'which<br />
to build a superstructure, Growth, yes, we are all in favour of<br />
growth and so have our predecessors been in Australia because few<br />
countries in the history of tho world have grown as much or as fast<br />
as our owno But growth is a physical matter. You may measure it<br />
in that senseo Stability, in the sense in which we all employ it,<br />
is a monetary mattor, When you say you want stability with growth,<br />
you say we want stability of monetary values in other words, we<br />
want to avoid inflation and, at the scnoe time, we want to develop<br />
and develop and develop the material resources of the country, I<br />
am at a loss to understand why it is thought that these two things<br />
o oo o o ./ 2 </p>
<p>-22-<br />
are incompatible, They are not, The best evidence of that is<br />
that vwe have had two or ih. roo years now in A. stralia of the most<br />
enormous physical growth and dovelopment and we have had practically<br />
a dead level in the consumor price indo-, We have had, so long<br />
as we keep it, stability in a nonetary sense and growth in a<br />
developmental sense, Now, Sir, I mention this because time after time,<br />
people think that when you talk about stability, you moan stagnation<br />
in physical growth, forgetting that you are talking about a<br />
monetary conception and that when you talk about growth, some<br />
people will say, " Oh, you must be very careful" under the impression<br />
that you are talking about an inflation of the currency. The two<br />
things are utterly different. The two things are entirely<br />
reconcilable and in my opinion, it is one of the great businesses<br />
of statesmanship in this country to do all that we can to reconcile<br />
them, to prevent the cost level from rising, to prevent inflation<br />
from wrecking the foundations of growth and at the samo time to<br />
have all the development, all the growth, all the added productivity<br />
that we can achieve, Now this seems to Sir, to be so sinple<br />
as to be almost elementary, to be alrost a truism, and yet I am<br />
perfectly certain that before long I will walk down the street and<br />
I will encounter some very well known man in the business world<br />
who will say to me, " Of course, my dear fellow, growth and<br />
stability are incompatible," Now, I hope ; hat I have said will indicate to you<br />
I don't believe that to be true. Apply it to the businesses in<br />
which you as graziors are engaged. Woll, you have a vested<br />
interest haven't you, in avoiding inflation. So have I as the<br />
head of the nation, Don't let us forget tt tt there are many many<br />
people in Australia who have a vested interest in inflation, to<br />
whom some degree of inflation represents positive advantages and,<br />
forx all I know Sir, there are more of those than there are of you.<br />
and that is why it is very important politically not just to coun6<br />
the heads but to calculate the ideas, to work out with some sense<br />
of justice what ought to be done. I would nerely begin always<br />
by saying to myself, " Well, recognise that you have very many<br />
people who have a vested interest in inflation, who cro not<br />
exercised by it." Sir, I have even heard economists and one speaks<br />
with immense respect for economists ( Laughter) if only because they<br />
present such an infinite variety of opinions, but I hWve heard<br />
economists, well-known if nIt oeinent, at any rate well known<br />
who have said about 2% inflation a year is a pretty good idea,<br />
This will be the proof that the country is moving. And when I<br />
occasionally say, " Well, that's a splendid idea. That means that<br />
when we go out to raise moncy for public works for the developnent<br />
of this country we ought to be saying, if you are right, to the<br />
investors, ' Well, I understand that you will write off your investnent<br />
at the rate of 2 per cent, a year'", When the last groat<br />
inflation was on in Australia, the Loan market used to fail, the<br />
Commonwealth Goverment had the somewhat dubious advantage of<br />
having to supplement the Loan market in order that these public<br />
works progra-mes could go on and it used to cost us, on the<br />
average, about Å 60M or Å 70M. a year out of the Budget and that<br />
meant that the taxes either didn't come down or went up. My<br />
experience was that when we had performed this act of singular<br />
magnanimity without any obligation we wore able to go out at the<br />
next State election and hoar -urselves being attacked for our<br />
taxation policy by the very fellows who had collected Å 60M, or<br />
a year out of us to maintain their works programme, These<br />
are just the ironies of life, ( Laughter) So long as one doesn't<br />
become sleepless over them, one survives themn </p>
<p>-3-3<br />
But the fact is that every time wo had an inflationary<br />
process the Loan narket has been advers ely affected for the nost<br />
obvious reasons. Yet I an perfectly certain that there are very<br />
few people loft in Australia who don't realise that any development,<br />
whether it is in primary industry or secondary industry or tertiary<br />
industry, any development is conditioned upon an adequate supply<br />
of funds for governent works. It doesn't natter whether they<br />
are the Snowy for electric power or whether they are some water<br />
storage with the consequent reticulation of water for irrigation,<br />
whether they are for roads with consequent inprovenmnt upon<br />
transportation it doesn't natter what they are, all these basic<br />
services we look to the governent or governnents to provide and<br />
we all want then to provide then if they can out of Loan noney<br />
because this business of providing then out of revenue means that<br />
today's taxpayer is unduly loaded to supply his sonsl uses and<br />
purposes in twenty years' tine. And so we would like to have then<br />
done out of Loan money, and today we are increasingly getting then<br />
done out of Loan noney.<br />
Today we have a Loan nmrket which is nost renarkably<br />
successful, and one of the reasons for its success is not that<br />
they go hone and say their prayers you know, these financiers<br />
say their prayers and say " Isn't it wonderful to have the Menzies<br />
Governnent" I think nost of them doubt it ( Laughter) but it<br />
is because there has been stability in the currency, because<br />
inflation has been checked and therefore one of the by-products<br />
is that the Loan markets have been well supplied and therefore the<br />
works progranes of Australia have been able to go on apnceo<br />
Nov you as I said, have a vested interest in avoiding<br />
inflation, After all, you neot the local costs if there is<br />
inflation, if there is a steep step up in the wage ratq and if the<br />
techniques of production haven't kept step with then, you will<br />
find that your costs, whatever they ray be for, are rising and that<br />
your price still remains, as I daresay it always will one way or<br />
another, at the mercy of the buyer. Now, it is quite true that<br />
prices have been healthy of late, We have known periods, haven't<br />
we, in which they have been very bad. We have known one or two<br />
periods in which they have been embarrassingly good. I won't go<br />
back on it, ( Laughter). But above all things you do represent a<br />
great industry which cannot afford to be, and which we cannot<br />
afford to have, priced out of the world market or priced out of<br />
existence, and therefore you have a vested interest in some<br />
stability of costs, or at any rate in a cost level which is<br />
supportable if you are to continue your industry at a reasonable<br />
profit and sell your commodity on the world's market at a reasonable<br />
advantage. This is all perfectly true.<br />
How do we meet this kind of thing? How do you meet<br />
it? Well, you meet it of course in one sense by constantly<br />
aiming at more efficient production, I mean by constantly aiming<br />
at a bigger clip per sheep, let's put it that way. By constantly<br />
aiming, as I hope everybody will, at maintaining wherever possible<br />
the quality of our wool. These things represent better methods,<br />
better grazing methods, better ways of handling the various<br />
problems of classifying wool, all this kind of thing these are<br />
matters that you, in a managerial sense can look after. You are<br />
not the mantors of what you will pay but you are, in a sense, the<br />
masters of how you will handle your business,<br />
But in the long run, you know and I know that if<br />
we were to have an acute inflation in this country not all the<br />
skill, not all the enterprise not all the applicaion of art and<br />
science to your industry could prevent you from having your costs<br />
rise against you and perhaps at a time when the world's demand was<br />
sustaining one of those occasional falls that it does. Therefore,<br />
I say to you and I say it with warm approval, you have a vested ./ 4 </p>
<p>-4-<br />
interest in avoiding inflation. I don't mean to say, Sir, that any<br />
government can sit down and guarantee that there never will be a fall<br />
in the value of money, That would be an absurdity because there are<br />
many instruments of policy in this country which don't belong to<br />
governments at all and there are many circumstances which bear upon<br />
the value of money which exercise a pressure. This is a vastly<br />
complex thing. Somebody tells me the central bank, the Reserve Bank,<br />
under Government persuasion if necessary has ample power to avoid<br />
this. Of course that is not true. The Reserve Bank has great power<br />
to do a great number of matters and every time it does one of them<br />
in the normal fashion I am pleased about it, I don't mind saying,<br />
because I prefer the occasional nudge to the economy to the sudden<br />
hit by some large emergency scheme on the part of a government.<br />
But give all the powers the Reserve Bank has in and they are not<br />
by any means all the powers the financial powers in the country<br />
give in what the Commonwealth may do with its limited powers, it is<br />
still true that there are many agencies in the country which affect<br />
the supply of money, the price of money, the value of money which<br />
at the moment, are not under compulsive authority in Australia. But<br />
that doesn't mean that the Government of the country indeed the<br />
governments of the country should not constantly have in their<br />
mind the great truth that stability in the value of money, stability<br />
in the value of savings, stability in the value of investments is one<br />
of the great conditions which enables growth to occur.<br />
S There is an argument that goes on, and I don't want to<br />
enter into it, about overseas investment in Australia. We have had a<br />
very great deal. It goes on. I, myself, believe that it is not<br />
unrelated to the remarkable stability of this country. Political<br />
stability I don't mean by that that I an Prime Minister or something,<br />
but I mean by political stability that this is not a country that<br />
changes its government by revolutions or assassinations. I have<br />
been Leader of the Opposition myself and still alive which is a<br />
romarkable thing ( Laughter) in our country. But stability, stability<br />
of government stability in broad economic ideas, a steady growth,<br />
the possibility of immonso resources these are the things that<br />
induce people overseas to put their money into Australia and they put<br />
it in for growth, not as a hiding-place, but for future growth. They<br />
put it in for future growth because they believe as I do that growth<br />
in the country depends entirely or primarily upon the fertility of<br />
S the soil from which you are going to grow and the fertility of the<br />
soil depends a great deal on the stability of the countryj the sort<br />
of stability that means that people are not going to lose their<br />
investment in a wild inflation or lose their investment in some wild<br />
political " bouleversenent", some revolution.<br />
We ought to remember these natters and remenber them with<br />
very great pride, but we will do best, Sir, on all these mntters if<br />
we don't become the victins of slogans. What I have said to you<br />
today was designed primarily to dispose of the slogan which seems<br />
to me to be so false that you can't have stability and growth at the<br />
sane tine. I an happy to say that if I an relieved by God or nan<br />
from my responsibilities in a reasonable time in the future, I should<br />
like to have enough time off before my ultinate departure to look<br />
back and say, well, we did show, with the help of the people of<br />
Australia that you can be stable and that you can be fast-growing<br />
at the sane time. To Australia this is tremendous. To Australia's<br />
greatest industry, this is vital and so I therefore have given nyself<br />
the great pleasure of coming here, wishing you well in all your<br />
undertakings in the course of this conference and saying to you, if<br />
I may, that you are not to be beguiled by the siren voices that will<br />
occasionally be hoard. You just stick to the good old rules of being<br />
sound, sensiblo, forward looking, skilful and responsible. That's<br />
all I ask of you ( Laughter) and I daresay that in your turn, you<br />
would say, " Well, if you would even live up to that, old boy, we<br />
would be a lot better off than we are."<br />
Sir, I declare the Conference open. </p>
