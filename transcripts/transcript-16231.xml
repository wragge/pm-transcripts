    <content><![CDATA[<p>On the 90th anniversary of the end of the First World War, the Prime Minister Kevin Rudd and Minister for Veterans' Affairs Alan Griffin, joined Australians at home and overseas to honour all those who have served and died in wars, conflicts and peace operations.</p>
<p>More than 102,000 Australians have lost their lives in the defence of our country.</p>
<p>Today the nation paused for one minute to remember every one of those lives lost, those who had served, and those who continue to serve.</p>
<p>Speaking at the Remembrance Day ceremony at the Australian War Memorial in Canberra, the Prime Minister paid tribute to the heroism, courage, mateship and resilience displayed by the hundreds of thousands of Australians who have put their lives at risk to serve their country in war. He said that on this day of remembrance we must commit ourselves to peace.</p>
<p>On the Western Front, Mr Griffin represented Australia at the Remembrance Day ceremony in Ypres, Belgium, before reading the Ode and laying a wreath at the Menin Gate.</p>
<p>Remembrance Day 2008 is particularly significant as it marks 90 years since the signing of the Armistice, finally bringing an end to terrible war that cost millions their lives.</p>
<p>In Australia, of the 416,809 men who enlisted, more than 60,000 were killed, with a further 156,000 wounded, gassed, or taken prisoner. These immense losses were sustained by population of less than 5 million people.</p>
<p>Australians have served with distinction in many more conflicts, including the Boer War, Second World War, Korean War, Malayan Emergency, Indonesian Confrontation and Vietnam War, and more recently in Afghanistan and Iraq.</p>
<p>Prior to the Canberra Remembrance Day service, two panels were unveiled on the Memorial's Roll of Honour.</p>
<p>The Afghanistan panel now includes the names of the five Australians who were killed on active duty in the past year.</p>
<p>The Indonesian Confrontation panel was amended to include the name of an Australian who died of illness in 1965 as a result of his service in Sarawak. The addition of his name corrects a 1960s administrative oversight.</p>
<p>Family members of all six Australians were present at the unveiling ceremony.</p>
