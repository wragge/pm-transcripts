AUSTRALIA TO OBSERVE ANDEAN PACT<br />
The Special Minister of State, Senator Willesee,<br />
announced today that Australia had been accorded observer<br />
status to the Andean Pact organisation. Senator Willesee<br />
said that the Pact, whose members were Bolivia, Chile,<br />
Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Venezuela, was an important<br />
sub-regional grouping, whose activities were of considerable<br />
interest to Australia. Pact members were concentrating on<br />
increasing economic co-operation and integration for their<br />
national and regional economic benefit. Observer status would<br />
enable Australia to keep in close touch with the organisation's<br />
headquarters in Lima.<br />
In accordance with the practice of the Pact<br />
organisation, the Australian Embassador to Peru, Mr H. A. Dunn,<br />
has been designated as the Australian observer. Mr Dunn is<br />
also Australian Ambassador to Argentina and to Uruguay.<br />
Senator Willesee said that this move reflected the<br />
Government's desire to strengthen Australia's relations with<br />
Latin American countries. He recalled that Australia sent an<br />
observer to the General Assembly of the Organisation of American<br />
* States last April. </p>
