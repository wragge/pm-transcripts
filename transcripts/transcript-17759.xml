Prime Minister Julia Gillard and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on the Centenary of ANZAC Warren Snowdon today welcomed a report on ways to pay tribute to the ANZAC Centenary and a century of military service since the First World War.</p>
<p>The report was developed by the National Commission on the Commemoration of the ANZAC Centenary, which was established by the Federal Government to look at options to mark the Centenary of the First World War 2014  -  2018, in particular, Anzac Day 2015.</p>
<p>The commission considered more than 600 submissions containing more than 1,500 suggestions from Australia and overseas.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Julia Gillard said the report was an important step towards the most significant anniversary for Australia since the Centenary of Federation in 2001.</p>
<p>In 2015, Australia will pay extra special tribute to the Anzacs who forged the values of mateship, loyalty and courage that define our nation today. </p>
<p>During the First World War over 420,000 Australians enlisted to serve and more than 60,000 lives were tragically lost.</p>
<p>This was an extraordinary commitment for a young nation with a population of just over five million at the time.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister thanked the six members of the National Commission on the Commemoration of the ANZAC Centenary, for their contribution to the report.</p>
<p>The commission's report makes a number of recommendations for Government to consider in six general themes:</p>
<p> * 	Education and public awareness so we can continue to pass on our understanding and experiences of the war on from one generation to another;</p>
<p> * 	Refurbishment and maintenance of our memorials, cenotaphs, honour rolls and avenues of honour;</p>
<p> * 	Recognition of a Century of Service, to ensure anniversary of the First World War and all other conflicts and peacekeeping operations in which Australians have been involved are properly recognised;</p>
<p> * 	Major Commemorative Services such as the annual ANZAC Day Dawn Service at Gallipoli</p>
<p> * 	Community engagement to encourage activities that acknowledge and inform the local community about Australia's military legacy including local wartime experiences; and</p>
<p> * 	International engagement to generate opportunities for Australia to be involved in initiatives and activities that will promote international collaboration.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister announced the formation of a new ANZAC Centenary Advisory Board to progress the work of the commission and provide strategic advice on the planning and implementation of ANZAC Centenary events and initiatives.</p>
<p>Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on the Centenary of ANZAC, Warren Snowdon, said the new board was the next logical step in the journey towards 2015.</p>
<p>The Government will consider the commission's report and announce its response later in 2011.</p>
<p>The commission members include former Prime Ministers the Rte Hon Malcolm Fraser PC AC CH, and the Hon Bob Hawke AC, RSL National President, RADM Ken Doolan AO (Retd), former Peacekeeper MAJ Matina Jewell (Retd), veteran advocate, Kylie Russell, and cartoonist and journalist Warren Brown.</p>
