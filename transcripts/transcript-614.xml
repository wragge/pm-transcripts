P. M. No, 69/ 1962<br />
PROVISION OF COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE<br />
FOR DEVELOPMENTAL PROJECTS IN TI, KIMBERLEY<br />
REGION OF WESTERN AUSTRAIA<br />
Statement by the Acting Prime Minister_ Senator the Hon,<br />
WoH, Spoon(,, r<br />
The Acting Prime Minister, Senator Spooner, announced<br />
today that the Commonwealth Government has agreed to extend<br />
beyond the current financial year the provision of financial<br />
assistance to the State of Western Australia for developmental<br />
projects in the Kimberley region.<br />
Senator Spooner recalled that the Commonwealth has<br />
for some years been actively participating in the financing<br />
of developmental expenditure in the northern part of Western<br />
Australia0 Under the provisions of the Western Australia<br />
Grant ( Northern Development) Act 1958-1959, the Commonwealth<br />
undertook to provide up to œ 5 million towards the cost of<br />
developmental projects undertaken by the State in the area<br />
during the five years commencing 1st July, 1958, Expenditure<br />
under the Act to 30th June last amounted to œ 3,568,000 and a<br />
furthe-2 œ 1,432,000, to bring the total Commonw'ealth payments<br />
to œ 5 million, is being provided this financial years The<br />
projects assisted under the Act include the Crd River diversion<br />
dam and certain port improvements and investigations.<br />
In addition to the œ 5 million grant, and also to<br />
its regular annual payments to the State under the Commonwealth<br />
Aid Roads Act 1959, the Commonwealth made a grant of œ 500,000<br />
to Western Australia in 1961-62 for the improvement of the<br />
Wyndham-Nicholson and Wyndham-Hall's Creek roads for the<br />
transport of beef cattle During the year, the State Government<br />
also spent at least an equal amount from its own resources on<br />
other beef cattle roads in the Kimberley region. Improvement<br />
of road transport facilities in the region is expected to lead<br />
to a significant rise in beef production and thus to an increase<br />
in export earnings, and Senator Spooner said that the work<br />
being carried out has already begun to show tangible results<br />
in terms of an increased off-turn of beef cattle. Cattle<br />
numbers transported to the meatworks at Wyndham were nil in<br />
1960, 3,902 in 1961 and 11,167 in 1962o<br />
As announced by the Treasurer in his recent Budget<br />
Speech, provision was made in the Commonwealth's 1962-63 Budget<br />
for a further grant of œ 700,000 to Western Australia for beef<br />
roads purposes, and also for payment of an amount of œ 300000<br />
towards the construction of a new jetty at Derby to facilitate<br />
particularly the shipment of cattle from the region served by<br />
that porto Senator Spooner said that inter-governmental arrangements<br />
in respect of the further assistance measures provided<br />
for in the 1962-63 Budget were recently discussed between<br />
representatives of the two Governmentso The Commonwealth was<br />
represented at these discussions by Senator Spooner as Acting<br />
Prime Minister and Senator Paltridge as Acting Treasurer, and<br />
the Western Australian Government was represented by Mr. C0W.<br />
Court, the State Minister for the North-West, o. 0008 oo/ 2 </p>
<p>2<br />
At the discussions, Mr. Court on behalf of the<br />
State Government emphasised in particular that to enable<br />
the State to go ahead with the construction and improvement<br />
of beef cattle roads and the Derby Jetty project on a properly<br />
planned basis, it was highly desirable for the Commonwealthts<br />
position in relation to the future financing of the two projects<br />
subsequent to 1962-63) to be determined.<br />
With regard to beef cattle roads, Senator Spooner<br />
said the Commonwealth Government has now agreed to provide to<br />
the State in addition to the grant of œ 700,000 this financial<br />
year and the grant of œ 500,000 last financia year further<br />
grants of œ 750,000 for each of the three years 1961-64, 1964-65<br />
and 1965-66. In effect, the scheme of Commonwealth assistance<br />
will be extended to take the form of grants of up to œ 3,450 000<br />
over the five year period 1961-62 to 1965-66 inclusive, on the<br />
understanding that over the period the State will from its<br />
own resources spend at least an equal amount cn the construction<br />
and improvement of beef cattle roads in the area.<br />
Senator Spooner said it is intended that the Commonwealth<br />
grant of œ 700,000 in 1962-63 will be spent on the same<br />
two roads as the grant of œ 500 000 last year ( namely the<br />
Wyndham-Nicholson and Wyndham-Aallfs Creek roads). As to the<br />
future the State Government has prepared a general programme<br />
of road works covering the five year period, and the roads on<br />
which the Commonwealth grants after 1962-63 are spent will be<br />
subject to the Commonwealth's approval.<br />
Senator Spooner commented that there will now be a<br />
comprehensive scheme of Commonwealth financial assistance<br />
totalling œ 13 million for beef roads covering broad areas of<br />
northern Australia. In addition to the grants of œ 3.45 million<br />
to Western Australia, the Commonwealth has already undertaken<br />
to provide grants of œ 5 million for the construction of beef<br />
cattle roads in Queensland over the five year period from<br />
1961-62, while in the Northern Territory a programme of beef<br />
roads to cost œ 4.57 million over three to four years is under way.<br />
With regard to the Derby Jetty, the project is<br />
scheduled by the tate for completion by the end of 1963-64 at<br />
a total estimated cost of œ 800,000. Senator Spooner said<br />
the Commonwealth Government has now agreed to provide to the<br />
State financial assistdnce of up to the full amount of œ 800,000,<br />
of which up to œ 300,000 is to be provided in 1962-63. One<br />
half of the assistance will be in the form of a grant and one<br />
half in the form of an interest-bearing loan repayable by the<br />
State over 15 years.<br />
Senator Spooner added that legislation to approve<br />
the arrangements for the provision of Commonwealth financial<br />
assistance for beef cattle roads in the Kimberley region and<br />
for the Derby Jetty project will be introduced during the<br />
forthcoming sittings of Parliament.<br />
