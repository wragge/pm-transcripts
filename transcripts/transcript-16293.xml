    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Rudd Government today announced a boost to the Geelong economy with Chemring Australia Pty Ltd awarded $1.8 million from the Geelong Investment and Innovation Fund.</p>
<p>The grant will create 40 full-time jobs and inject $18 million into the local economy.</p>
<p>It will help stimulate the Geelong economy during the severe global financial crisis.</p>
<p>The new Chemring facility will include a leading edge research and development lab, further cementing Geelong's reputation as a centre of industry and innovation.</p>
<p>It will also help secure Australia's place on the world stage, sending the message that despite the global financial crisis, Australia and Geelong are open for business.</p>
<p>Chemring Australia, a subsidiary of UK-based Chemring Group PLC, manufactures countermeasures and pyrotechnics for the defence sector.</p>
<p>They have recently been awarded a 10 year, $160 million contract to supply countermeasures and pyrotechnics to the Australian Defence Force.</p>
<p>The grant awarded today will allow Chemring Australia to invest in state-of-the-art infrastructure, double its highly skilled workforce and boost its innovative capacity.</p>
<p>The increase in manufacturing capacity enabled the Lara site to win the work ahead of other international Chemring Group locations.</p>
<p>It will assist Chemring Australia to establish itself as the principal supplier of countermeasures and pyrotechnics to the Australian Defence Force.</p>
<p>It will also be critical to Chemring's pursuit of investment and opportunities in the Joint Strike Fighter program, which would lead to many more jobs in Geelong.</p>
<p>The Fund is a partnership between the Commonwealth, the Victorian Government and Ford Australia and this collaborative approach is critical to its success.</p>
<p>The Fund is about ensuring the Geelong region continues to be a hub of innovative manufacturing in Australia, creating high-skill, high-wage jobs.</p>
<p>The first round of funding is already creating 193 sustainable, full-time jobs, and injecting $27.2 million into the local economy.</p>
<p>Applications for the second round of the $24 million Geelong Investment and Innovation Fund are being assessed. An announcement is expected in early 2009.</p>
