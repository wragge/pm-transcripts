    <content><![CDATA[<p>E&amp;OE...............................................</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, a boost for Nowra?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>A huge boost for the whole Shoalhaven district. People have waited</p>
<p> decades for this announcement and the Federal Government has declared</p>
<p> it a road of national importance. It will be a huge boost to the tourist</p>
<p> industry. It's a massive infrastructure project for the whole</p>
<p> district. And it's just an example of our commitment to regional</p>
<p> Australia.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>How much money will it cost and when can you see it...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I think the figures being kicked around at the moment are in</p>
<p> the order of</p>
<p> $60 million to $70 million. But we haven't precisely battened</p>
<p> that down. We'll get it started as soon as possible.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>You talked about carers today and how important the Government is</p>
<p> taking their role. What sort of priority will you make that in the</p>
<p> budget?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, we do attach a very high priority to it and we are looking at</p>
<p> a range of options which could involve further assistance. And I guess</p>
<p> it's a case of, watch this space.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Why is it so important to give this assistance?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, because they are people who are genuinely in need of help. You</p>
<p> often have cases of parents in their 60s, even 70s, who are looking</p>
<p> after, in very difficult circumstances, adult children who have profound</p>
<p> handicaps. They get a lot of help at the moment but not enough and</p>
<p> we're looking at ways of giving them some more help.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, there were some murmurs in there of disagreement when</p>
<p> you talked about Telstra. Do you think that there's a real concern</p>
<p> in the bush that perhaps they may be hard done by if you sell the</p>
<p> whole of Telstra?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, they won't be hard done by. You can't have 100 per</p>
<p> cent on anything but I can assure the bush that there'll be guarantees</p>
<p> galore to protect their position when the rest of Telstra is allowed</p>
<p> into Australian hands.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, how important is the seat of Gilmore to your re-election?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, the seat of Gilmore is very important but every seat is important.</p>
<p> Joanna Gash is an outstanding local member. And what has really impressed</p>
<p> itself upon me today, as I've gone around, is everybody thinks</p>
<p> she's doing a terrific job. She will hold the seat of Gilmore</p>
<p> and she'll hold it largely because of her own efforts, plus,</p>
<p> of course, the impact of the Government's policies.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, you're well over-schedule here today. Is this</p>
<p> the beginning of the election campaign?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>You never stop campaigning when you're a Prime Minister. You</p>
<p> never, ever stop campaigning and it goes on. And I guess this sort</p>
<p> of thing will go on for quite some time. I might, in passing, note</p>
<p> that I saw a very, in the context of campaigning, a very interesting</p>
<p> observation from Mr Beazley yesterday. He said that the Labor Party,</p>
<p> if it were to win the next election, was not necessarily committed</p>
<p> to reversing all of the cuts that we had made. Well, that's an</p>
<p> act of monumental hypocrisy. He's opposed everything we've</p>
<p> done. But what he's now saying is that he wants the luxury of</p>
<p> having it both ways. He wants the political kudos from interest groups</p>
<p> of opposing decisions we've taken but he doesn't want to</p>
<p> be bound to reversing those decisions. He should be consistent and</p>
<p> honest. And if he is not prepared to reverse decisions that we've</p>
<p> taken, then he shouldn't oppose them. For example, the higher</p>
<p> education charges - he opposed those tooth and nail. Is he going to</p>
<p> reverse those changes if he wins the election? He opposed the waiting</p>
<p> period for migrants. Is he going to reverse that if he wins the election?</p>
<p> I think the list goes on. He ought to be consistent. If he opposes</p>
<p> something, he ought to commit himself to reversing it in government.</p>
<p> If he's not prepared to reverse it in government, he shouldn't</p>
<p> be a hypocrite and oppose it. He's trying to have it both ways</p>
<p> and I think the Australian public will see through the sheer hypocrisy</p>
<p> of that.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, there's been quite a bit of talk in recent years about</p>
<p> the possibility of some of the facilities at Richmond closing down,</p>
<p> the RAAF facilities, and coming down here. Is that on the agenda?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, it's not on the immediate agenda, no. I mean, you can never</p>
<p> emphatically rule anything out as far as the location of defence assets</p>
<p> is concerned. But it is not something that is immediately on the agenda.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, a very good response from the residents at the retirement</p>
<p> village today. How do you read that in terms of your aged care policies?</p>
<p> Are those people accepting of them...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh, yes...I was told today that there is very ready acceptance of</p>
<p> the accommodation charges. People see that as reasonable and fair</p>
<p> and equitable. They recognise that if people are in a position to</p>
<p> make a slightly larger contribution that previously then they should</p>
<p> do so. I think the changes are bedding down very well and people recognise</p>
<p> that we've tried to do the right thing and that's the reason</p>
<p> why we got a very warm reception.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Does it reinforce your belief that you were right to make the tinkering</p>
<p> at the edges on that?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh, absolutely. I have no doubt that the decision that I took to get</p>
<p> rid of the bonds was the right decision. I've never been reluctant</p>
<p> to take the view that if you believe you've got to change a decision,</p>
<p> then you ought to be upfront, bold and make the change and get on</p>
<p> to the next thing. And I did that in relation to nursing homes and</p>
<p> I'm quite certain it was the right decision.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
