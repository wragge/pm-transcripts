    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Government condemns the brutal attacks in France, Tunisia and Kuwait.</p>
<p>The thoughts of all Australians are with the families of the victims who lost their lives and the others injured in these barbaric acts of terror.</p>
<p>At this stage, we have no information that any Australians have been killed or injured.</p>
<p>Australia stands in solidarity with all those affected by these atrocities.</p>
<p>These attacks are yet another reminder that the terrorist threat is real.</p>
<p>They strengthen our resolve to combat the threat and the evil it represents.</p>
<p>Australia is committed to tackling the threat of global terrorism. We are making a strong contribution at home and working closely with our partners abroad.</p>
<p>Our security agencies are assessing the situation for any implications for us but there is no information to suggest a higherÂ  threat to Australia as a result of these latest atrocities.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Australians should remain vigilant, and we urge people who see or hear something that they feel is not right to contact the National Security Hotline on 1800 123 400.</p>
