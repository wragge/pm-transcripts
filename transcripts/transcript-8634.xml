Thank you Dame Beryl.<br />
Well there are lots of symbols of any battle and there are many symbols of the battle for<br />
Australia at Miluc Bay. But the Kittyhawk is a famous symbol and it's a great tribute to<br />
the Memorial that you've been able to procure and secure this Kittyhawk and restore it,<br />
one that's had its own associations with the battle and which will pay tributc to those who<br />
flew Kittyhawks, and to the machine itself and its role in the Milne Bay campaign.<br />
In the Battle for Milne Bay we really celebrate and remember the most highly successful<br />
land battle in the battle for Australia. Because no doubt we have remembered, as we have<br />
now, for most of this century those who served and the battles in the First World War. But<br />
Austrabia was not threatened in the First World War, only in the Second World War, and<br />
in the battle for Australia, a battle for the liberty of the people of this country, those who<br />
served in Milne Bay should be appropriately remembered.<br />
And the Memorial in bringing back, in recreating parts of the Pacific campaign in the<br />
gallery behind us, and now with the Kittyhawk, serves the memory of those who fought<br />
for Australia in the Second World War well, and balances up the presentation of the<br />
Memorial and the remembrance of the First World War with the Second World War.<br />
So it's a great pleasure for me to be here with those who actually flew this plane, and an<br />
even greater pleasure to be asked to launch the exhibition, the exhibit of this famous<br />
Kittyhawk. Thank you. P. .02/ 04 </p>
