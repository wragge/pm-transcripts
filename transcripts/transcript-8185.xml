TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW WITH MATT PEACOCK, AM PROGRAM,<br />
6 NOVEMBER 1990<br />
E OE PROOF ONLY<br />
PEACOCK: Mr Hawke, you've told your ministers to lift their<br />
game. Does that apply to you too?<br />
PM: Yes I'm a Minister.<br />
PEACOCK: And what aren't you doing right at the moment?<br />
PM: Well I think we're all discharging our portfolio<br />
responsibilities diligently and relevantly. But I think all<br />
of us, and that includes myself, have to do more to get out<br />
and explain, not just what each of us are doing in our<br />
portfolios but overall the Government's message. I don't<br />
mean by that, Matt, that the problems we've got politically<br />
are just problems of communication. Obviously the community<br />
is hurting al: the moment as a result of policies that we<br />
believe we've-had to apply to save Australia from longer<br />
term damage. It's a mixture of communication and<br />
reassurance that these policies are going to produce in the<br />
medium term the outcome that we all need.<br />
PEACOCK: Ye; well that's the point of course isn't it. I<br />
mean, people like Senator Button can hardly be told they're<br />
not communicating. You appear to be carpeting him about<br />
every couple of weeks for saying how bad he thinks things<br />
are. PM: Well if you think that that's a fair statement of<br />
what's been happening you're entitled to that opinion. It's<br />
a totally erroneous misrepresentation of what's been<br />
occurring. PEACOCK: There is concern in the Ministry, isn't there,<br />
about how bad. things could get?<br />
PM: There's concern not only in the Ministry but in the<br />
Party generally that put it this way they understand,<br />
there has been no questioning about the need to slow things<br />
down because there was a clear appreciation that the high<br />
level of activity and the associated high level of imports<br />
was not sustainable. So they accept that the policy of<br />
slow-down was necessary. Where the real concern is, Mattand<br />
I understand it is were the brakes kept on too long as<br />
it's going into a deeper hole of activity than was intended </p>
<p>and a recoverable one? There are concerns about those<br />
things. PEACOCK: Can I introduce a couple of other items. I mean,<br />
let's be pessimistic for a minute. If the shooting starts<br />
in the Middle East and if the GATT trade talks break down<br />
we're really very vulnerable in Australia, aren't we?<br />
PM: Well the whole world is vulnerable in the case of those<br />
two circumstances. If you take the case of the Middle East<br />
and what can happen with that. Certainly it is the case<br />
that if you ( lot an escalation of oil prices that would<br />
increase inflation and it would have a detrimental effect on<br />
a lot of our trading partners which could feed back to us.<br />
In direct terms Australia being a nett exporter of energy<br />
that could, in that respect, you know, in our external<br />
accounts, have a slight nett advantage. But overall the<br />
world must be worse off in those circumstances and so would<br />
we. In regard to GATT, well all I can say there, Matt, is<br />
that I don't think anyone however critical they are of the<br />
Government on other matters have any word of criticism about<br />
the Australian Government's activities in the GATT round.<br />
We are the leaders of the Cairns Group. We are the group<br />
which is trying to bring sense between the Americans and<br />
particularly the Europeans and to put pressure on the<br />
Europeans to put an offer on to the table in regard to<br />
agricultural trade. Neal Blewett is there at this very<br />
moment again fulfilling that role. So whatever criticisms<br />
there may in other areas there can be none there. But<br />
you're right in saying if that breaks down, and I'm not<br />
saying that it's going to, but if it were to break down then<br />
the total world economic context would be far worse.<br />
PEACOCK: You'd then share the view of Minister Willis that<br />
our current circumstances, even at present, might get worse.<br />
That unemployment will probably get greater than the budget<br />
predictions PM: Because of the ongoing Gulf crisis it looks as though<br />
the price of oil could, on average for the year, be somewhat<br />
higher than the US$ 23 upon which the budget was predicated.<br />
To the extent: that that's true there could be a higher price<br />
outcome, somewhat higher price outcome, than was expected<br />
and there could, as Ralph Willis said, be a slightly higher<br />
unemployment outcome.<br />
PEACOCK: So do you think it's possible, do you think it's<br />
even likely, that the economic situation at present is going<br />
to get worse. I mean, there is a recession at least in some<br />
sectors of the economy. What's your advice to the people<br />
now? PM: Our view is that we are approaching the bottoming of<br />
the turn-down. Let me say on this word recession, I mean<br />
people just seem to be having some fun about that. The<br />
position is very simple in regard to what I've been saying<br />
about that. In economic terms, in the language of<br />
economics, the technical definition of a recession is two </p>
<p>successive quarters of turn-down. All I've said is that in<br />
those terms that criteria hasn't been reached. But I<br />
haven't, and I don't now Matt, try to hide behind that. I<br />
mean, that's merely the economists technical definition of a<br />
recession, wh~ en you've had two recorded sessions of negative<br />
economic growth. Now having said that that's the economists<br />
technical definition I'm not trying to say that the economy<br />
is not in turn-down and that people are not hurting. I've<br />
publicly acknowledged that. Now our belief is that as we go<br />
into the second half of the financial year, that is first<br />
half of calendar 91, that activity will have bottomed and we<br />
will be on the way up again. I have no reason to have any<br />
other view to that.<br />
PEACOCK: OK but how do you expect, for example, say the<br />
farmers to like you more<br />
PM: I don't expect the farmers to like me more when things<br />
are happening to them the way they are. I can do nothing<br />
whatsoever about the prices that they are receiving for<br />
their wool and their wheat and the only thing I can do about<br />
that is to do what this Government has done better than any<br />
government before it and that is to take an active<br />
international role in all the relevant fora and in all our<br />
bilateral contacts to try and tell the rest of the world<br />
that they must have a freeing up of international<br />
agricultural trade. We're at the forefront. Australia is<br />
the leader of that fight. Now I can't do anything more than<br />
we are on that ground. In regard to the particular problems<br />
of the wool industry, the answer to those problems are<br />
partly with Government but overwhelmingly they are with the<br />
industry itse-lf in terms of the numbers of sheep. Now we<br />
can't do anyt~ hing more. In regard to the area of interest<br />
rates, then i~ n this year there have been five successive<br />
reductions of interest rates and we can't do anything more<br />
in that area.<br />
PEACOCK: You can do more though on micro-economic reform<br />
can't you, with a recession or what looks like it and the<br />
possibility of it getting worse, is that an opportunity to<br />
move much faster, to make more drastic reforms in some of<br />
these critica-l areas because obviously things like<br />
telecommunica~ tions don't attract the headlines for, say, the<br />
farming community?<br />
PM: I'll be making a major statement on micro-economic<br />
reform in regard to telecommunications and transport policy,<br />
particularly aviation, later this week which will be yet<br />
another instalment in the most massive program of microeconomic<br />
reform that any government's ever done in this<br />
country. There's no-one in the business community or, may I<br />
say, in the farmers organisations, they do not question the<br />
fact that we have done more in the area of micro-economic<br />
reform than has ever been done or even contemplated by any<br />
government before us. </p>
<p>PEACOCK: What about things like annual leave loadings<br />
though, Prime Minister? Is that a rort, a luxury we can't<br />
afford? PM: If we're going to be talking about rorts and luxuries<br />
that people can't afford I would think that the attention of<br />
commentators ought to be directed towards the business<br />
community as much as towards workers. The fact is that the<br />
workers of this country, the organised workers of this<br />
country, have made more sacrifices in the period of this<br />
Government than ever before. You've had between 10 and 11%<br />
real reduction of award wages which have been compensated by<br />
improvements in the social wage. But as fas as their wages<br />
conditions are concerned, the organised workers of this<br />
country have exercised more restraint in this period which<br />
has resulted in a massive shift from wages to profits. So<br />
they've done that, they've done that, to enable that<br />
increase in profits to be reflected in an increase in<br />
investment. PEACOCK: And what are the rorts that the business community<br />
should give up?<br />
PM: Well if you look overall at what's happened to<br />
executive remuneration, that has moved much more, executive<br />
remuneration has moved very, very, very much more than has<br />
the remuneration of wage and salary earners.<br />
PEACOCK: Prime Minister, I can't let you go without a tip<br />
for the Cup.<br />
PM: Yes well the three I've chosen, Matt, are The Phantom,<br />
Flying Luskin and Ali Boy but I think that the Cup this year<br />
is such that anyone of about 15 could win. In the last<br />
seven years, apart from last year, I've picked and backed<br />
the winner every time. I don't have the same degree of<br />
confidence. But you've got to make a pick so there are my<br />
three, The Phantom, Flying Luskin and Ali Boy.<br />
PEACOCK: Mr Hawke, thanks for joining us.<br />
PM: Thanks very much Matt.<br />
ends </p>
