TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIMIE MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING, NMP<br />
INTERVIEW WITH CTAIE ARTIJURS, RADIO 4QB, BUNDABERG, QLD,<br />
16 NOVEMIBER 1992<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
CA: It is a big pleasure to welcome this morniing to our Bill Macarthy studios in<br />
Bundaberg Prime Minister, Paul Keating. Good morning.<br />
PM: Good morning, it's very nice to be here.<br />
CA: We are going to take some calls in talkback this morning and I will just give our<br />
listeners our number again it's 071 532800. Prime Minister before we go to calls<br />
can I go to the qucstion which a lot of people are wondering this morning and of<br />
course the election, if you were to bump into Governor General, Bill Hlayden, in<br />
Brisbane at the airport this afternoon you still could call a December election.<br />
PM: Yes I could hut that wouldn't be quite the place to do it and I have not made any<br />
arrangements to see him.<br />
CA: Then no decision or arc you ruling out a December election all together now?<br />
PM: Well as I said yesterday, it's a funny thing in this business, everyone wants you to<br />
rule things out. One of the prerogatives thc Primc Minister has in this system of<br />
our-, is the option of deciding thc election date so I never rule anything out.<br />
CA: What are you reading into thepoll1s released this wcek which put you and the ALP<br />
ahead of the Coalition?<br />
PM: Well$ I think that we are seeing a trend deterioration in the Opposition's position<br />
and I think because their policy stance isn't the appropriate policy stance for<br />
Australia at the momecnt. It may bc that thcy say that we have got to do more on </p>
<p>employment and economic recovery and we certainly want to see that<br />
strengthened. But putting a goods and services tax, 15 per cent on everything,<br />
cutting thc Commonwealth bdgt_ back by $ 6-7 billion which would have a very<br />
regressive effect onl the economy, all those of those things are basically the wrong<br />
policies for the current condition of the economy. T think what has basically been<br />
realised that people don't want a 15 per cent tax on everything they buy, food,<br />
clothing, services, and they don't want people thrown off unemployment benefits<br />
after nine months, they don't want the budget deficit cut back so that the spending<br />
from the public sector is withdrawn, and as well as that I think they don't like<br />
the fact that Dr Hewson has attacked almost every group in the country.<br />
CA-Prime Minister let's go to the phones, if you would like to pop your headset on we<br />
will have a chat to Bob who is our first caller this morning. Good morning Bob.<br />
Caller: Morning, morning Paul.<br />
PM: How are you Bob?<br />
Caller: I am all right. My question concerns unemployment, Paul, and I ami wondering<br />
why we perhaps can't embrace some scheme wvhcrcbyo3ncmployment beniefits<br />
continue to be paid for anyone that goes back into the workforce with the<br />
employer making up the difference between their bcnefits and what the applicable<br />
wage might be for that particular industry or job they go into. For instance<br />
suppose an unemployrment beneficiary is on say $ 300 a week that's a benefit, and<br />
the job that is offered. is say paying $ 500 the employer pays the difference between<br />
the two, say $ 200, this continues for say 12 months and after that time the thing is<br />
reviewed and if the economy is coming out of recession then perhaps this can be<br />
continued but on a smaller benefit from thc Government and the employer making<br />
up a greater percentage of the wage?<br />
PM: Yes I understand what you are saying. Wcll look we have things called labour<br />
market programs and Job-Start, which may be a name that rings a bell with you, is<br />
basically just what you aelcribed. It is a wage subsidy which the Commonwealth<br />
pays to any employer taking somebody on. Now, the labour market programs of<br />
the Commonwealth this year will handle roughly 400,000 people and that's a very<br />
large proportion of thosc unemployed. So, we have got quite a comprehensive<br />
range of policies out there now and we added to those in the One Nation program<br />
and in the Budget. So there is nearly 1.5 million of expenditure there now on<br />
labour market programs which either provide a combination of training and thle job<br />
subsidy or the a straight job subsidy. So, they arc out there and we are now<br />
operating those programs to try and get the maximum take-up, which is I say<br />
about 400,000.<br />
CA: Airight thanks very much for that call Bob and we will move on to Roy. Good<br />
morning Roy. </p>
<p>Caller: Good morning. We have had a small business for a long time but bard times had<br />
come and we owed a $ 20,000 dcbt in 1983. Ever month now we seem to<br />
increase our debt by about $ 1000 more or less. When it is less than $ 1000 the<br />
bank is happy, we arc now in debt to the tune of 160,000 and the Manager of our<br />
business wants his employment contract resigned. My question to you should I<br />
sign to re-engage him even though he is managing our business into a worse<br />
position month by month?<br />
PM: You have a business which you havc turned over to somebody else, is that the<br />
idea?<br />
Caller: Yes we have turned our Australian business over to you and the Labor Party and<br />
you arc managing it month by month into a worse position, should we re-cngage<br />
you at the ncxt election?<br />
PM: Well, I will just say this to you, if it wcrc not for the L-abor Party, Australia would<br />
be still punting on simply agriculture and minerals. We were a farm and a quarry<br />
in the early 1980s and that's all we would be. We were exporting then 14 per cent<br />
of all we produce, today we are exporting nearly 25 per cent of all we produce.<br />
We have actually made the big change to an externally oriented country which is<br />
now exporting heavily and we will be able to pay our way in the world, which was<br />
not the case a decade ago. Now we have been in a recession but we are coming<br />
out of it with a low inflation rate, we have also kept most of the 1980s jobs. In<br />
1983 the workforce was 6 million people in sjze, today it is nearly 8 million, it is<br />
nearly a quarter biggcr and even though we are not cecating enough new jobs as<br />
new entrants join the workforce, that is, as unemployment is rising we have kept<br />
the stock of jobs that we produced in the ' 80s. Now what we have to do is to go<br />
back to growth but we are living through what we call a surge of productivity, and<br />
what that means is we are getting more output more production from fewer people,<br />
so at this stage of the cycle as we grow we would normally be taking people up<br />
more rapidly into employment, we are not at the moment because of productivity.<br />
That is we are getting the came output or production from a small workforce so<br />
because the whole country is now more productive it means it is not laden with<br />
employment likc it was in the past. So, we can only grow more strongly, more<br />
rapidly and as that happens the employment will be taken up, productivity or not,<br />
do you understand?<br />
CA: Can we follow that because last night you were talking to ALP members at an<br />
informal function you talked ahout the fact that Australia had crossed the Rubicon<br />
some ten years early in relation to our attitude to our place in the world. We tcnd<br />
to talk more these days in terms of the things we have to address about the growth<br />
In employment and the growth in unemployment. What about the possibility of<br />
gctting some recognition of the fact that there will always be an unemnployed pool<br />
and teaching our young people to cope with life which includes not having a full<br />
time paid job. </p>
<p>PM: The key point here is what is today full employment? The Reserve Bank Governor<br />
said last week he thought it was somewhere bctwcein 5.5 and 6 per cent, we've got<br />
unemployment at around just over 11 per cent so half of that he thinks is what we<br />
call structural unemployment, that is unemployment which is there because we are<br />
going out of some industries and into new ones. The other half of the<br />
unemployment is from the cyclc of the recession the boom and the bust. As we<br />
grow we'll take that employment up, that unemployment will come down, but<br />
whcther we can get below 5.5 to 6 per cent is a moot point and it will take some<br />
years. So we are going to certainly be living with a higher level of structural socalled<br />
unemployment than we were in the past. The main thing is that people are<br />
trained for the sorts of jobs the Australian economy will offer in the future, but the<br />
key point is Australia has crossed a Rubicon, we were a country really without<br />
hope in the early 1990s, we'd relied for nearly all the post-War years on mining<br />
and agriculture and as good as they have been and remain good, they were not<br />
good cnough to pay for our imports and they were not good enough to employ<br />
people, that has now all changed.<br />
CA: We might be a country with hope, but there are an awful lot of individuals coming<br />
out of school this Christmas who don't have hope and they might even agree with<br />
you that things might all change in five or ten years, but meanwhile they have got<br />
mouths to feed.<br />
PM: I can only take about the 1980s experience here and that is most young people<br />
found a job quite rapidly and particularly those who were trained. There is a link<br />
betwecn growth in the economy and employment, we've just got to have the<br />
economy growing to take them up. Again a lot of young people arc finding jobs<br />
out there, it is only a minority who are not and the fact now that we've got a much<br />
higher proportion of kids completing secondary school and then going on to<br />
university and to TAPE means their prospects in finding a job are greatly<br />
enhanced.<br />
CA: Let's take some more calls, Lorraine is waiting to talk to you.<br />
Caller: Good morning Paul and welcome to Bundy and first I think you arc doing a pret<br />
job despite the media bias and the promotion of Hewson especially by Lyncham<br />
and Bomnhorst on my belovcd ' 7: 30 Report'.<br />
PM: That's nice of you to say, thank you,<br />
Caller: If the OST is so great in New Zealand, why are there 250,000 Kiwis living here<br />
and approximately 510,000 of them on our dole? But to help Australia we need to<br />
buy Australian goods and less population and only exchange migration, it's ovcr<br />
breeding that causes unemployment because you can see that by the population<br />
explosion in Australia. </p>
<p>PM: Can I say a couple of things, you often hear New Zealand compared with<br />
Australia. I just said a moment ago to a gentleman that called earlier that our work<br />
force in the last decade has grown by nearly a quarter, it started at six million, it is<br />
now newrly eighit million. In New Zealand the work force is actually smaller today<br />
than it was in 1983, there are actually fewer people in work today than there was in<br />
1983, where we have nearly 25 per cent more people In work today than in 1983.<br />
So the goods and services tax and all that sort of hard-hearted economics have not<br />
stood them in the stead that the policy mix we've had has stood Australia. I<br />
believe that we don't need another tax base in the tax system, putting 15 per cent<br />
on people's clothing and food and services, every service they have whether it be a<br />
bus ticket or a railway ticket or a hair cut, or whatever it might be, is all going to<br />
be taxed as to 15 per cent. It's inflationary, it's going to add about six to seven<br />
percentage points to inflation at a time when we've got inflation the lowest in the<br />
OECD, the lowest in the world, under one per centage point, and that extra<br />
increase in inflation will go straight into interest rates which will only slow down<br />
any recovery we have. So we think it is absolutely the wrong policy miix and as<br />
well as that it's being paid by one group of people but the benefits are going to<br />
another group of people. In other words the people who pay don't get the benefits<br />
by way of tax cuts and the rest, basically it's a switch in income from low and<br />
middle income earners to high income earncrs so we think it is the wrong policy.<br />
As to population, this country can obviously carry a larger population than it has<br />
and we've been complementing our natural growth in our own population with a<br />
migration program. We've cut that roughly in half over the last few years largely<br />
because the labour market is not growing strongly enough to take migrants up as<br />
well as those who are coming out of our own labour market, but the migration<br />
program remains an important long ternm program for our economic strength and<br />
the growth to a critical mass in our population.<br />
CA: Thanks for Your call Lorraine. Prme Minister, speaking of policies, the reason<br />
you are in Bundaberg and in this region today is to talk suigar. Now with the report<br />
into the sugar industry due for release, in fact just about ready to be released,<br />
what's the point in holding taks?<br />
PM: Claire, the point is, I've not meet the groups of cane growers myself and I always<br />
think it's bad form for a government to be making decisions without those<br />
primarily involved, having the benefit of the sort of discussions which some of our<br />
colleagues have. Now Brian Courtice, your member here, is of course, the<br />
Chairman of this group and Brian knows the sugar industry back to front, and he<br />
and the group have spoken to cane growers and cane grower rcpresentatives and<br />
the sugar industry in general. What I want to do is pick up a feel on that, pick up<br />
soeof the feel so when Brian presents the rcport it means something to me and<br />
the Cabinet, that we've got an actual feel of the issues. That I think is the virtue in<br />
seeing people, so that the report has some sort of contcxt when it is presented. I<br />
haven't had that opportunity and I'm looking forward to it today. </p>
<p>CA: And on the ground Prime Minister?<br />
PM: On the cane fields.<br />
CA: And another call now, and it's good morning John.<br />
Caller: Good morning Prime Minister.<br />
PM: How are you John?<br />
Caller-Very well thank you, my discussion is savings in relation to the pension. The<br />
Australian Government in common with most overseas governments which<br />
provide peniions for retirees realise that in the future the ability of government to<br />
pay for pensions will he greatly reduced therefore the Australian Government has<br />
said make a personal effort to prepare for your retirement. My two questions are<br />
connected with that personal effort part Personal savings: why does the Labor<br />
Governmnent not provide an incentive in the form of income tax deductions on<br />
savings invested on which income tax has previously been paid.<br />
PM: You mean that..<br />
Caller: As someone who is an employee shall we say, I'd be income taxed on my wages<br />
regularly then make a saving and I'd be income taxed again on the investment from<br />
that saving.<br />
PM: Right, the principle is we tax income and interest income is income the same as<br />
any other sort of income.<br />
Caller: What about the personal effort if I and others save from my original income as we<br />
are being requested to do, surely we should receive some incentive to do so.<br />
PM: It's all a matter of whether or not a cost to the Budget will add to savings, that is,<br />
would people save a certain proportion of their income prudently and, if we gave a<br />
tax deduction for it, would that not just make the Budget so much harder to finance<br />
and would we have any more savings for it. The one placc where we think we can<br />
add to the savings in a discretionary way is through superannuation that is, by<br />
encouraging people through the tax system and through the labour market under<br />
the Accord programs for employer sponsored supcrannuation and there, as you<br />
know, by later this year cvery person in the work force will have five per cent<br />
contributed for and on their behalf by their employer, and that will rise to about<br />
nine per cent by thc end of this decade. That sort of contribution system going into<br />
their account which is then preferentially taxed superannuation income is vcry<br />
lightly taxed will mean that as it accrues there is substantial bencfit accruing<br />
there for every person in the work force. So when we reach the position where in<br />
about 2010 or 2015 when my generation is retiring, that is the post-War baby<br />
boom generation, therc will be twice as many of us of retired aged than there is </p>
<p>7<br />
today, and that will put a very big strain on the Commonwealth Budget to pay<br />
aged pensions. We are taking the opportunity now, prudently, to provide for our<br />
retirement income to add to our retirement income, to add to pension in 2010,<br />
2015 through superannuation, And in the meantime for those who are retired now<br />
we kept the pension up, we've got it up to above 25 per cent of average weekly<br />
earnings per person and we've got Support for the aged in our general programs<br />
such as the hostel, nursing home, dementia and all these other programs as well as<br />
home and community care.<br />
We think we've got both bases covered, but the growth in investment and funds<br />
coming Into the superannuation system will do more to add to savings than any tax<br />
preference we could give td savings accounts in banks and if we give it to savings<br />
accounts in banks there is no guarantee we'll actually add another dollar of savings<br />
to that which would have been saved without the tax concession.<br />
CA: Thank you for that, we'll take another call and next this morning is Jean. Good<br />
morning.<br />
Caller: Good morning Mr Keating.<br />
PM: Hello Jean.<br />
Caller: You said last night on ' 60 Minutes' no one has done anything to change the amount<br />
of pornography and violence on TV and videos for the last twenty three years.<br />
Then why havcn't you heen listening to the womens organisations and churches<br />
and the families who have been pleading for you to change these rules?<br />
PM: I didn't say no onc has done anything for twenty three ycars. What I said was I<br />
think that the networks are finding that programs which have more real-life, shall<br />
we say violent, situations tended to believe that these things add to ratings and<br />
they buy a lot of the product which comes from Hollywood which today is more<br />
violent in content than it was say a decade ago. We have had, to this point, self<br />
restraint on the part of the networks in deciding what they put to air, lately they<br />
have been pushing those limits out. What I'm saying is I don't want to be deciding<br />
what adults can see, but I think it is very important that films arc properly<br />
classified. We've now got a dual classification system, we've got one set of<br />
classificat ions for television and another for movies and videos. We need<br />
basically one set of classifications and one which givcs you an accurate idea of<br />
what's in the product -so if parents arc then looking at the television program and<br />
deciding what their children can see they have a fair idea of what the film is likely<br />
to provide, whereas at the moment they don't have much idea at all. Thc other<br />
problem is confusion bccnuse we have this dual classification system and that they<br />
don't provide a good idea of what's in them. Many children are exposed to what<br />
are so-called real life violent scenes which I think basically dulls their scnscs<br />
about these things, that is they become unsensitised to it and I think that is a bad<br />
thing. Perhaps the answer to this is we put adult films on later so that children are </p>
<p>not likely to he watching them and better that we classify the films so that<br />
everybody has a chance to know what is in them. But can I say though, I know<br />
some organisations havc gone on about this subject over a long period of time, it is<br />
a very difficult one to handle.<br />
CA: Prime Minister, while you arc on the subject of media and while you are in<br />
regional Queensland can I ask two questions about media and of course, the ABC.<br />
Does Canberra appreciate the importance of the ' role of the ABC in regional<br />
Australia and what are your concerns or views on the future of the AB3C<br />
particularly with funding for the region?<br />
PM: We pay the ABC nearly half a billion dollars a year, we pay the ABC more than<br />
we pay the State of Tasmania in Commonwealth grants, so it is a very large thing<br />
and we do it for the public interest broadcasting. I think onc of the things that<br />
most of us in Canberra would think is that it is a regional network, that is onc of<br />
the valuable things about the A. BC that is it is providing a service which in many<br />
places is the only scrvice, in some places the only service.<br />
CA: Does your Government agree with the Coalition that the ABC needs to become<br />
leaner and meaner?<br />
PM: No, we reject absolutely Dr Hcwson's vicw that you can cut a substantial<br />
proportion of funds from the A. BC. Because if you take a substantial proportion as<br />
they want to to fund their program from the ABC, that will simply mean a cut back<br />
in services and that must mean across the whole spectrum not just television but in<br />
radio. I don't think this is appropriate and I don't think it's the time to be doing it.<br />
CA: We'll take another call and coming up now we've got Bill on the phone. Hi there<br />
Bill, thanks for waiting.<br />
PM: How are you Bill?<br />
Caller: Well Paul. Paul, I'm a retired grain farmer, a small farm I might say, my only<br />
source of income is from interest on invested capital, income which is diminishing<br />
with falling interest rates. As my investments mature I'm hard pressed to pay my<br />
way aftcr tax, would your Government consider allowing self funded retirccs<br />
private health insurance costs as a taxation rebate? The present cost is $ 870 per<br />
year.<br />
PM: I think we are coming at this problem a different way. Brian Howe is trying to<br />
negotiate with the States better access by public patients and public hospitals so<br />
that those who are aged don't feel that they nccd to insure thcmselves to cover<br />
themselves for elective surgery, so if some onc needs a hip replacement or<br />
something like that they can reasonably find entry into a public hospital and have<br />
it done, so that we relieve people in your position of the burden of paying for<br />
private insurance. Now that is the aim, that is to sit down with the States and </p>
<p>conclude in the Budget we provided $ 1.5 billion over the next five years, about<br />
$ 300 million a year for enhanced payments to State governments for better access<br />
for public patients in public hospitals and of course, thc aged are an important part<br />
of that. A lot of aged people cover themselves for private insurance when quite<br />
often Medicare is going to stand them in good stead.<br />
But on the underlying point you raise about interest, it is true that the real rates of<br />
interests have come down and part of it's been that we've succeeded with inflation<br />
so the inflationary floor sitting under interest rates has come down, so what's called<br />
the nominal interest rate, the posted interest rate has dropped and that's the effect<br />
you are feeling now. I can only say this to you, that with inflation running at<br />
around one per cent or less, your prices have dropped too, so it should mean that<br />
while you have suffered a loss year in nominal income, it should be compensated<br />
in pant by the fact that prices are not rising at the pace they were a year or two<br />
years ago which should help you carry on; that is, your income is down, but the<br />
growth in the price lcvel is down with it. hope that if we can conclude a<br />
successful set of agreements on Medicare enhancement for public patients in<br />
public hospitals you'll find that you just don't need to cover yourself with private<br />
insurance.<br />
CA: Thanks for YOU Call Bill, Prime Minister we arc going to have to let you go soon<br />
becausc you are off to sweet talk with the sugar growers, but before you do go just<br />
two weeks ago in that vcry chair John Hewson was talking about personality in<br />
politics and we spoke at some length about the selling of his image and he made a<br />
comment that he doesn't believe there is anty winner in personality politics, would<br />
you disagree with that?<br />
PM! I think the issues are what matter and that's why it is important to articulate those.<br />
One's motives will always be called into question, whether you are a Labor leader<br />
or a conservative leader, in proposing for instance, cut back to the ABC, cut back<br />
in funding for the aged, a thing like the GST, we will refer to their motives as tlhey<br />
will to ours for the policies to which we are associated. I don't regard that though<br />
as personality politics, I regard that as part of the sensible cut and thrust of public<br />
life in Australia. I think thc public are quite reasonably impatient about what they<br />
think is a senseless focus on personalities and they do want value and they do want<br />
the system to work. By and large, our political system does work and a lot of the<br />
static gets transmitted. All too often the mnedia will always pick the juicy bit and<br />
not the forensic bit, if the ncwservice had the time to carry it all, it would look<br />
much more balanced and presentable. So, for our part, we can only do the best we<br />
can to keep the focus on the issues, but at the same time make the whole debate<br />
intelligent to people.<br />
CA: We have people marching in the streets in Victoria against an elected government,<br />
we have business leaders in court, wc have politicians before royal commissions,<br />
do we have a crisis in leadership in Australia? </p>
<p>PM: I don't think so. I think the Australian political system has served Australia pretty<br />
well in the last decade. We were a country that was flipping under the waves ten<br />
years ago, as I said earlier, we were relying on a group of industries we<br />
traditionally relied on to look after us and they were unablc to and at the eleventh<br />
hour wc had to switch the whole productive basis of the Australian economy and<br />
we've done it. We arc now ini a low inflationary context as well, we've changed<br />
the habits of nearly a century. So I think the political system is working, better in<br />
Australia than perhaps in any country; look at the United States, the problems<br />
which Governor Clinton is referring to there now education, access and equity in<br />
education, aces and equity in health, thcse are all things that were a problem in<br />
America ten years ago, were never touched. They've all been dealt with in<br />
Australia, by arnd large, and the same with thc productive base economies. So I<br />
think the political system in Australia is working. There will be problems in the<br />
States; we've got the problem in Queensland with the corruption enquires, you've<br />
got the problems in Western Australia et cetera. But if you look at the national<br />
Parliament, in the big cockpit of Australian politics where the big decisions are<br />
made, I[ think, by and large, the system has served the country pretty well.-<br />
CA: Prme Minister, thank you very much for joining us this morning and for taking<br />
those calls and spending some time.<br />
PM: Good Claire, I'm sorry I was late starting, but we are late finished so we've made<br />
up the time.<br />
CA: We'll leave you to a day in Bundaberg.<br />
PM: Thank you very much, nice to be here.<br />
ENDS </p>
