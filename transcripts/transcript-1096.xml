OPENING OF THE A. P. I. AA ITA IAN/ AUSTRALIAN 65/ 0<br />
S PORTS ASSOCIATION) CLUB<br />
LEICHHARDT, N. S. W. 14TH APRIL,, 196~<br />
Speech by the Prime, Minister? the Rt, Hon. Sir Robejpt Menzies<br />
Mr, Chairman, Your Excellencies and Iedies and Gentlemen<br />
I must say that having looked at this magnificent<br />
room which is the only part of the enterprise that I have yet<br />
looked at, I think all the newspapermen ought to be compelled<br />
to come here to have a look at it and then when, in due course,<br />
we build a modest new Parliament House at Canberra, they will<br />
have no complaints whatever. ( Iaughter)<br />
I just want to mention two facts before I engage in<br />
a little excursion of my own interesting facts. I obtained<br />
them and I was tremendously struck by them. I have been around,<br />
as many of you know, for some time. I have been by good<br />
luck oxr good management, probably good luck Prime Minister<br />
for a long time, and when I began I claim no credit for this,<br />
I may say there were 35 000 Italians in Australia, and now<br />
, with all the movement thai has occurred, there are 265,0006<br />
In other words, an increase by almost eight times. Now that<br />
is a very remarkable thing. This represents, vationally<br />
, peaking, the second largest movement into Australia. the<br />
largest being from Great Britain, This is the second largest.<br />
We have heard occasionally that people come here and<br />
after a while they get tired of us, they don't fancy us very<br />
much and they leave. We hear a good deal about that, and<br />
therefore, I said, I would like to know what happened to the<br />
Italians who came here. The answer is that the return rate<br />
for Italians is one per cent. The average overall rate is<br />
six per cent. Now all that demonstrates that this country has proved<br />
vastly attractive to members of the Italian community the<br />
Italian nation and that having come here, they do fit into the<br />
Pattern of Auszralian life so well that they donft want to go.<br />
Now this to me is something of tremendous significance, it<br />
demonstrates the value of the kind of work that this club has<br />
been doing to integrate into the Australian habits and customs<br />
a number ol people, thousands of people who come from a<br />
different kind of country, who have in many cases a different<br />
kind of background and might therefore feel strange and in many<br />
cases rather homesick for the country they have left, Therefore<br />
t want to congratulate the Club and I want to express the<br />
immense pleasure that I feel at the figures that I have just<br />
been reciting to you.<br />
Now having said that, I wonder if I might say something<br />
of a general kind. The people of Italy I will describe them<br />
in that way have had an immense capacity for moving out,<br />
right through history. This is no modern novelty, Indeed I<br />
want to remind those of you who are Italians that your ancestors<br />
2,000 years ago invaded Britain, and it was a long way away<br />
from Rome in those days invaded Britain and held it for some<br />
centuries and left a lot of names behind and a lot of fine,<br />
straight roads, Roman roads, all over the island. That argued<br />
the questing spirit of the ancient Romans under great leadership. </p>
<p>V 1 2-<br />
I would also like to remind you that your language<br />
derives directly from a language which has made its imprint not<br />
only all over Western Eruope but over a great part of the<br />
civilised world, because although very few people today can speak<br />
Latin, or for that matter understand Latin very consecutively,<br />
the truth is that all the Romance languages Italian itself,<br />
French, Spanish, all these Romance languages as we call them,<br />
have spread around the world. They are the whole basis of our<br />
own speech which is very very much affected in the long run by<br />
the ancient speech of Italy, as is that of the United States and<br />
all round what we are pleased to call the English-speaking world<br />
or the French-speaking wurld or the Italian-speaking world or<br />
whatever it may be. So don't think that you have done something<br />
rather peculiar by coming here in the last few years, You are<br />
acting in the highest tradition of your country the highiest<br />
tradition of the ancient Romans, and the Latin iongue and the<br />
Latin writing. When I was a university student, I took a su~ bject<br />
cciled Roman Law, which served to remind me very much indeed that<br />
there is a definite line of indebtedness to the ancient home of<br />
Roman Law over a considerable section of the world, You see<br />
what I am getting at? Your language you have exported. -You have<br />
taken it in one form or another all round the seven seas. Your<br />
literature in one form or another ha s moved and tfound its place<br />
all round the world. The legal systems which were devised in<br />
Rome are not the common basis of the English system of law, the<br />
English Common Law, though it has had its influence here and there,<br />
but it has had a very big mark on the legal systems of Germany, of<br />
Scotland and so on, so that in point of speech, in poinit of<br />
literature in point of law, the people of your country I am now<br />
speaking directly to the Italians who are here have been great<br />
carriers of wisdom and of culture all round the world. They have,<br />
so to speak, made it migrate to other countries and in this<br />
cqntury, as we have seen in Australia we have had a great wave<br />
of migration of human beings from Italy to Australia, No~ w this<br />
is something that is good for us I hope and believe good for<br />
you. This enriches our own life,<br />
You know, if I might make a quiet, ccnfidential<br />
admission to you, we native-born Australians are occasionally a<br />
little narrow-minded about our own ideas and our own way of living.<br />
We say, " Well, who are these fellows to tell us?" This is the<br />
best proof that we have a lot to learn. And you corle along, and<br />
many others from some other country but I am talking patticularly<br />
to you who have come along here, and if you haven't shown. us the<br />
error of our ways, at least you have shown us new ways in which to<br />
walk, new ways to understand, and I venture to say that in one<br />
hundred years' time somebody writing what I will call -' to use<br />
ti~ at abominable word the cultural history of Australia, will be<br />
able to trace in it the influence of your people who have come<br />
here and settled here and contributed to the country a lot of<br />
faculties a lot of ideas, a lot of standards that came in almost<br />
as new things. This will be fascinating someday to trace the<br />
pattern of what will then be described as our civilisation, the<br />
pattern of Australian civilisation,<br />
Now I have indicated very very briefly to you that<br />
this is not the first time, nor is it the first country in which<br />
people of your race have made this contribution. They have done<br />
it all round the world. They have every right to be proud of<br />
having done it and you have every right to be proud of the<br />
contribution that you are making, * 0ee 0 / 3 </p>
<p>' 0 6 ' I 3-<br />
Now the one other thing I want to say is that it<br />
is a little simple, a little tempting to retain a special narrow<br />
sense of' community and to say, " Well, we ItaJians stick together,<br />
just as in the case of my own ancestry, ". 4e Scotsmen must stick<br />
together." Well between ourselves we do quite a bit, you know,<br />
We get on well with each other, We have a Scottish Society here<br />
or there but what we have done by way of compensation for this<br />
is to marry into people of other and not such fortunate races<br />
like the &amp; ihglish and having married and intermarried and<br />
identified ourselves in the community, then as you have not<br />
failed to observe we are not unwilling to take charge of the<br />
country and run ( Laughter)<br />
Now this is an interesting parallel, isn't it? Very<br />
interesting. Don't be exclusive. Don't get off but get in<br />
get into the community, get mixed up with the community. Let~<br />
everybody have the benefit of what you can contribute and you<br />
get the benefit of what they can contribute, an integr'ated<br />
Australian society. This is what we want and it is because you<br />
have seen that with brilliant clarity that you have established<br />
this organisation. This is the thing to do, and now that you<br />
have such splendid premises, I am sure that the work will go on<br />
afoot indeed, I rather think that if you are not careful,<br />
there will be such a majority of native-born Australians coming<br />
here to enjoy it that you may be a little squeezed, but'in that<br />
case, extend it.<br />
Good luck to you. Bless youb </p>
