MELBOURNE PORTS ELECTORATE I SEP 19,<br />
LIBERAL PARTY DINNER HELD AT<br />
ST. KILDA TOWN HALL, VIC. _ L<br />
AUGUST 1969<br />
Speech by the Prime Minister, Mr. John Gorton<br />
I would like to assure you, Sir, and everybody here that<br />
this particular function is one that appeals to me very much indeed,<br />
because I am here primarily not entirely but primarily to do what I<br />
can to get you to do what you can to help Kevin Randall win the seat of<br />
Melbourne Ports. And this is an entirely possible thing, based on the<br />
redistribution. On the figures for the 1966 election, if they are maintained,<br />
Kevin could win by 1, 500. They may not be maintained because 1966<br />
was an all-time record. But even if they aren't, I think that those of you<br />
who have seen the calibre of his campaign and who have planned the future<br />
campaign with him, would agree with me that even if the 1966 figures are<br />
not maintained, it is perfectly possible that he will win by 2, 500. I think<br />
and hope he will. And this depends not only upon what he does, or I do or you<br />
do, but on the message getting through to the electorate. We must make<br />
known the record of what has been done by the Party he seeks to support<br />
and the attitudes now adopted by the Party which he seeks to support. And<br />
we must provide a look into the future as envisaged by the Party which,<br />
when elected, he will support.<br />
Even at the risk of boring you, may I, because it is so<br />
important, recapitulate some of those things which in a relatively brief<br />
space of time have been done. When I say " in a relatively brief space of<br />
time" I mean the time during which I have been entrusted by my colleagues<br />
with the leadership of the Liberal Party. You are familiar with the two<br />
decades of transformation under Liberal Governments and of the climate<br />
created by these Governments since 1949. It is this climate that has<br />
given us unprecedented prosperity, unprecedented employment and new<br />
horizons. I do not dwell on that that is of the record. But in the last<br />
seventeen, eighteen, nineteen months, there have been a niumber of highly<br />
significant actions taken by the Government which Kevin Randall is going<br />
to support, actions which are going to react on the future of Australia for<br />
generations to come. / 2 </p>
<p>-2<br />
There was the significant decision to which I will refer<br />
again later when I mention the Democratic Labor Party the significant<br />
decision regarding retention of Australian forces in South East Asia. This<br />
was not an easy decision in the circumstances in which Great Britain<br />
announced an accelerated withdrawal from the countries to our North and<br />
the circumstances in which the United States indicated that she would<br />
maintain an interest in those countries but showed some hesitation in<br />
committing troops to that particular area. So, I repeat, it wasn't an easy<br />
decision for Australia to make in all those new circumstances to leave<br />
some troops in that area as a visible indication that we regarded ourselves<br />
as of the region in which we lived. Not as a nation that would move in to<br />
take Britain's place but as a natioa which would seek to contribute by<br />
economic means, by technological means, by opening up the avenues of<br />
trade and by assisting in the event of external attack. That decision was<br />
taken and so we will have the air force, navy and army there to work in<br />
with the region which must help itself as an earnest of Australia's<br />
participation in the region.<br />
There was a decision which in my belief will in a decade be<br />
shown to be one of the most significant Australia has made in the field of<br />
trade. That was the decision to enter overseas shipping with Australian<br />
ships and Australian crews; ships flying the Australian flag, plying between<br />
this nation and Japan, this nation and the United Kingdom, this nation and<br />
the United States. Only three ships so far, but setting an example which I<br />
hope will be followed by private enterprise and which, if it is not, will, I<br />
hope, be expanded by government. For we are an island continent, we do<br />
depend on trade and we do depend on exports. Our riches abroad are<br />
amassed because of what we grow at home, and we should not dissipate<br />
those riches by paying to others the freight for transferring what we grow<br />
to the markets where they are sold. And we should know, and know without<br />
question, what is a proper price to pay for those who freight cargoes from<br />
Australia abroad. There is no other nation yet which has grown great<br />
without having its own ships, and we have taken the first steps along these<br />
lines. We have made an approach in some ways pedestrian not<br />
I suppose emotionally exciting, but nevertheless of great importance in that<br />
we have had a look at the whole road construction programme in Australia.<br />
For the first time we have tried to get a cost-benefit analysis of what<br />
returns will come from the building of what roads in which particular area.<br />
As a result, we have abandoned previous formulae and have set aside for<br />
the next five years $ 600 million to be spent in urban areas to try and<br />
overcome one of the problems which so besets us. That is to get a free<br />
traffic flow, to enable freeways to be built, to allow people and freight to<br />
come in and out of urban centres without being held up and without<br />
frustrations and economic loss. </p>
<p>We have tried, and I think with some success in the time<br />
that we have had to advance along the road of providing for the ill and the<br />
old and the invalid and the needy. We said we would do this in the<br />
Governor-General's Speech from the Throne. And in the first Budget<br />
brought down we did take some steps in this direction. We did remove<br />
from those who had long-continued illnesses in hospital the fear that they<br />
would not be able to be looked after for the duration, though there are still<br />
things to be done in this matter in nursing homes.<br />
We did pay attention to the needs of families without<br />
breadwinners. We did a number of other things with which I will not<br />
weary you. And in this last Budget again we raised the payments to those<br />
who were most needy, we paid particular attention to the needs of widows<br />
with children and we looked after those who had been most seriously hurt<br />
in war in the defence of this country. We did these in an unprecedented<br />
way in that never in the space of little over a year had such rises been<br />
made in basic pensions and in, pensions for totally and permanently<br />
incapacitated servicemen. But we did more than that for basic to the Liberal belief<br />
is an assertion that we do not want to have a welfare state conception<br />
which believes that people should be looked after from the cradle to the<br />
grave without being required to make some effort themselves, without<br />
being required to put into the nation rather than just take out. And we do<br />
believe, as a part of Liberal philosophy, that those who have in their<br />
lifetimes practised thrift and self-help should not thereby be penalised<br />
when they come towards the end of the race of life. So we have made a<br />
breakthrough there in this Budget of great significance not yet I think fully<br />
realised in the community, in which a single man or a single woman can<br />
still receive some benefit from the state until his or her income reaches<br />
$ 44. A married couple can still receive some increase, some benefit<br />
from the state until their income reaches $ 80 per week. There is incentive<br />
now to earn more, even if you are on a pension, to contribute to<br />
superannuation, to save in other ways and this in itself is good and right<br />
and proper from a Liberal point of view. But it also, I think, has the<br />
practical advantage that in time to come there will be less and less call<br />
upon social service payments because there is this incentive to thrift and<br />
to self-help. In other fields, too, we have not been idle. In the areas of<br />
defence and foreign policy I have already spoken of the great decision<br />
to involve ourselves in joint defence of the countries to our North. And at<br />
this point, Sir, may I express some slight surprise at what the Party<br />
known as the Democratic Labor Party has, I gather, been saying about us<br />
in the last few days. Indeed, wherever I have gone today, it seems to me<br />
some reporter has sprung out from behind some pillar or from behind some<br />
door and poked something into my face and said, " What is your reaction to<br />
what the DLP or Senator Gair or Jack Little or somebody is saying?". And<br />
I haven't bothered to answer them because I was saving it for tonight. </p>
<p>4-<br />
I think in short comfpass that my reaction is this and ought<br />
to be this: That the Democratic Labor Party is a properly constituted<br />
party in Australia, that it had its genesis in a real fear of the infiltration<br />
into the Labor Party of communist ideas through the unions which the<br />
communists controlled and which were represented at the Labor Party<br />
organisation and through the unwillingness of the Labor machine and the<br />
Labor Political Party to attack communism in the unions or in public or<br />
indeed at all. And the men who formed that party were men of principle<br />
and they laid their seats in Parliament upon the line because they were<br />
men of principle. Many of them must have known that they would lose<br />
those seats when they took this action fifteen years ago. But they acted<br />
because they believed what they were doing was right, because they<br />
believed the ALP as it stood and I interpolate " as it stands" was bad<br />
for Australia, was infiltrated, had no interest in the defence of Australia<br />
and had a wrong foreign policy. It was becaus~ e they believed all these<br />
things they stood on principle and formed a new party.<br />
Since that time they have supported Liberal principles and<br />
Liberal approaches because these were more in line with their beliefs than<br />
were the approaches of the Labor Party. And now it is up to them as a<br />
political party operating in freedom to decide which approaches they wish<br />
to support at this coming election.<br />
There are two things, however, of which I am sure and in<br />
which I believe most of you would support me I think perhaps all of you<br />
would support me. One of them is that no great political party such as<br />
we are should tailor its policy or change its policy from what it thinks to<br />
be right merely in order to attract some support which ought to come to<br />
it anyway. Nor should it submit to what could be described although I<br />
do not so describe it as political blackmail.<br />
And the other points I want to make are these. You will<br />
remember that I said just now that those who formed this Party were men<br />
of principle who believed that what they were doing was good and right for<br />
Australia. What is their choice in this election now coming up? They are<br />
interested in the defence of this country. They are interested in the<br />
foreign policy of this country. Can they support candidates from the Labor<br />
Party who would immediately sign a Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty<br />
without waiting to see whether Australia's interests were adversely affected<br />
by doing it; and could they reject a Liberal Party candidate who would<br />
want, of course, an effective and efficient treaty of this kind but would not<br />
wish to sign it until he was sure it was effective and efficient and that our<br />
interests were not jeopardised by it. Could they support a candidate from<br />
the Opposition Party who would quibble and haggle and argue with the<br />
United States of America over whether a defence base of joint interest to<br />
our two countries could be established in Australia? Would they do this in </p>
<p>' r 5<br />
preference to a Liberal Party candidate who would say the ANZUS Treaty<br />
is the strongest guarantee Australia has got for its future survival, and<br />
if we are to have that treaty and make it work properly then we are<br />
required, not by a Treaty's written terms, but in decency required to<br />
help to provide a joint defence defence bases which being of interest arnd<br />
importance to the United States are therefore of interest and importance<br />
to ourselves. Could they support the Opposition's attitude on that as<br />
opposed to a Liberal Party attitude?<br />
Gould they support an Opposition attitude which says that<br />
National Service training would be abolished at once should they be elected<br />
as against the Liberal Party attitude which says that we will in the future<br />
need to keep, post-Vietnamt forces of such a size that National Service<br />
training must be retained? It will need to be retained for the purposes of<br />
defence itself and this is secondary for the immense benefit it brings<br />
to those young men who go into National Service training and come out so<br />
much better citizens than when they went in.<br />
Could they support an Opposition candidate who would at<br />
once support in his Party the withdrawal from Malaya and Singapore of all<br />
our forces ground, air and naval who would immediately scuttle from<br />
the area and once and for all indicate that we were not concerned with what<br />
happened? Could they support that as against a Liberal Party candidate<br />
who would, while not being prepared to inherit the burden that a great<br />
power, Britain, previously took on, while not being prepared to enter into<br />
mini-Vietnams, nevertheless was prepared to keep a force in being there<br />
to help against any extraneous invasion which might come?<br />
Sir, if this Party, the DLP, with its basic principles,<br />
professing the beliefs it still professes, could back Opposition candidates<br />
supporting the policies I have put before you in preference to Liberal<br />
candidates supporting the policies I have put before you, then the principles<br />
on which it was formed will have been repudiated and the reason for which<br />
it came into being will no lorger exist.<br />
And so, it is up to this Party to see, this Democratic Labor<br />
Party to see whether the choices being what they are, they can support<br />
people who stand in defiance of all they have said they believe, as against<br />
people who stand not for all they believe but much more so than do our<br />
opponents of the Labor Party.<br />
There has been in the last week or ten days much discussion<br />
about what the newspapers have defined as some great cha,-nge in policy by<br />
this Government towards the Soviet Union. I am always interested to read<br />
and know the difference between what some man says in Parliament in<br />
this case the Minister for Foreign Affairs and what the newspapers say<br />
he almost said in Parliament and make it the news. What in fact was said<br />
by the Minister for External Affairs was this. / 6 </p>
<p>6-<br />
He pointed out in his speech that the Soviet Union stands<br />
condemned for its invasion of Czechoslovakia, the anniversary of which is<br />
now with us. Hie used the words that the Soviet Union adhered to the<br />
pernicious doctrine of only limited sovereignty being allowed to those<br />
communist states who were around the periphery of the Soviet Union itself.<br />
He pointed out the need to be on guard against the Soviet Union, not to be<br />
lulled, to be careful all the time in all dealings with that country. But he<br />
did go so far, and I think that this is sensible, as to say that we in Australia<br />
had things we wished to see happen in the smaller Asian countries to our<br />
North. We wished to see them retain their independence. We wished to see<br />
them grow economically. We wished to see the benefits of that economic<br />
growth passed down to the peasants and the workers from the higher strata.<br />
We wished to see the avenues of trade opened to them so that they could<br />
help themselves. We wished to see them left in peace against extraneous<br />
attack. And he then said that we had so far not heard what the Soviet<br />
Union proposed about these countries, but they had spoken of some ideal<br />
of collective security that they hadn't spelt out. If their idea of collective<br />
security should turn out to be on all fours with what we in Australia want,<br />
if the Soviet Union should cancel some of the debts which are owing to it<br />
from these countries, should help them economically, should help them<br />
technologically, should help them to retain their independence, then we<br />
would because these are the same objectives as we have be prepared<br />
to examine such proposals with interest. That cannot surely in any man of<br />
commonsense be said to be a change in policy but rather an expression of<br />
hope, hedged with careful doubt but an expression of hope that perhaps<br />
the objectives we have for the safety of the countries to our North and<br />
therefore for our own, might possibly be brought about. At any rate, I<br />
see no great change in emphasis there, no great change in policy but<br />
merely an acceptance and an understanding that there are changes happening<br />
to our North and we will need to examine from all sources whatever may<br />
be put before us to help our own objectives and no-one else's.<br />
Well, that is my reaction to the approach of the DLP.<br />
What now remains to be done in this country? I have sketched<br />
quite briefly some of the things we have done. I've set out our attitudes<br />
and the facts of foreign policy. I've made an excursion into how those<br />
approaches in defence and foreign policy may affect another Party, but<br />
what remains to be done when we get re-elected, as we will<br />
First, ( I do not put these in any order of priority) but first,<br />
there is undoubtedly a need to build up our own defences in this country<br />
on land, on sea and in the air. But we will not go to the point of diverting<br />
to that build-up all of the increased prosperity of Australia. I do not<br />
believe we will need to put more of our GNP into it. We will need to put<br />
more money into it. We will need to increase it. Perhaps as time goes<br />
by we will need to increase it even faster but for the moment we are </p>
<p>7-<br />
ourselves under no imminent threat of attack. We must assume that attack<br />
can come in the future. But for the moment, having said that that must<br />
happen, there are other things to do. There are more steps to be taken<br />
along the road of helping those who are in need, particularly I would<br />
suggest large families on low incomes. And there are a number of other<br />
highly significant steps which ought to be taken and which I don't propose<br />
to tell you about until we make the policy speech in October. These will<br />
be spelt-out steps I will then put before you.<br />
They will in themselves be important but what will also be<br />
important are the objectives which they seek to attain. And these will be<br />
the continuing objectives of the Liberal Party only changed as " the times<br />
they are a-changing"; the continuing objectives of creating a climate for<br />
material growth and to see that to the greatest extent possible the savings<br />
of Australians are allowed to be put into the development of Australia.<br />
There will also be the objective of creating a climate, apart from the<br />
purely material kind, which provides individuals with the opportunity to<br />
develop themselves and their internal capacity to be an actor, if that is<br />
what they want, or a scientist or a horticulturist or whatever it may be.<br />
To enable them to express their own personality in whatever it is<br />
even if it happens, as in the case of Kevin and myself, that they should<br />
want to be politicians and persuade other people to put us where we want<br />
to be. Sir, I don't think there is any other party in Australia, I<br />
don't think there is any other group in Australia, I don't think there are<br />
other men in Australia who can achieve what we can if you give us the<br />
opportunity to do it. This decade ahead promises to be the most exciting<br />
in the whole of Australia's history, promises to give us the greatest growth<br />
in manpower and material benefits and in industrial muscles in Australia's<br />
history. It is a decade in which we will come of age, but con-e of age in a<br />
Liberal way if the people choose as believe they will.<br />
We have candidates I ask you to support. We have Kevin<br />
Randall who I believe will be elected with your support. And if he is<br />
elected, then he will help Australia and he will help the Government and<br />
in that way, in the long term, perhaps contribute to the creation of a<br />
nation that will be the admiration and the inspiration of the world and of<br />
great assistance to all mankind. </p>
