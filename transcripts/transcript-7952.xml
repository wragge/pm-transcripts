PRIME MINISTER 1<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF NEWS CONFERENCt, YARRA BANK, MELBOURNE<br />
12 MARCH 1990<br />
Z 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
JOURNALIST: Have you been able to speak to Mr Kelty yet<br />
about the problems with the metalworkers?<br />
PK; I did have a yarn with him on the phone last night<br />
and understand there'll be meetings tomorrow and I hope<br />
that the matter can be resolved without a dispute. Now I<br />
certainly hope that's the case, but as i've said even if<br />
there is some short stoppage, there's nothing that can<br />
detract from the record of the Accord the 60 percent<br />
reduction, 60 percent reduction in industrial disputes<br />
since my Government's been in office and that will<br />
continue and particularly so will the ref ormns of<br />
Australian industry with award restructuring. I hope<br />
there's not a hiccup with the dispute and I hope out of<br />
the meetings tomorrow that that can be resolved.<br />
JOURNALIST: What was the nature of your discussion?<br />
Will Mr Kelty be, be urging the metalworkers not to go on<br />
strike? PM: I don't think it's appropriate for me to go into the<br />
details of the discussions with Mr Kelty, but Mr Kelty<br />
would share Toy view that it's better for these things to<br />
be resolved without disputes.<br />
JOURNALIST: Who will the meetings be between tomorrow?<br />
PM: There'll be discussions involving the unions and<br />
hopefully some further discussions between the unions and<br />
the employers, but I don't really want to say any more<br />
than that. They will conduct their affairs.<br />
JOURNALIST: Would you say this is all unhelpful during<br />
an election campaign?<br />
PM: I've said I'd rather that there is no stoppage this<br />
week, but the realities are quite clear. The Australian<br />
people have got the starkest of choice when it comes to<br />
the conduct of industrial relations in this country. You<br />
can have a return to the past that's what they're<br />
promising, a return to the past where you had the free<br />
for all. Now I've introduced, in cooperation with the </p>
<p>trade union movement, the process of consultation. The<br />
simple indisputable fact is that under our approach<br />
there's been a 60 percent 60 percent reduction in<br />
industrial disputes. That doesn't mean in a democracy<br />
you're going to be disputeless, but it does mean that you<br />
can have a massive reduction in disputes and that's,<br />
that's the alternative. Basically consultation,<br />
cooperation, reduction in disputes or a return to the<br />
industrial jungle of the past.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, have you speaking of<br />
jungles been able to get yourself briefed on that Burma<br />
Railway issue?<br />
PH: I've done more than get myself briefed on the, on<br />
that issue. he soon as I saw the story I instructed my<br />
people to get in touch with our Ambassador in Thailand<br />
and ask him to get in touch with my friend, Mhe Prime<br />
Minister of Thailand, Mr Chatichai. They have done that<br />
and I'm very pleased to say that Mr Chatichai, the Prime<br />
Minister of Thailand, in his words which he's asked to be<br />
sent to me, directly to me, his words are he would never<br />
allow the glorious memory of Australian soldiers who died<br />
on the River Kwai to be desecrated in any way and he has<br />
instructed the Thai Minister of the interior to ensure<br />
that nothing is done or permitted which would in any way<br />
allow such a desecration. So as a result of my<br />
intervention, I had that direct personal message from the<br />
Prime Minister of Thailand.<br />
JOURNALIST: I project still go ahead?<br />
PM: No it would not. If it involved any, any of the<br />
sort of suggestions that have been put forward and I have<br />
the word of the Prime minister of Thailand for that and<br />
this is another example of the, of the benefits that come<br />
to this country from the fact that I've been able to<br />
establish direct close personal relations with all the<br />
leaders in the region. I've been able to get in touch<br />
with the Prime Minister directly in this way and he<br />
realised, as soon as he had the message from me, that,<br />
that anything of that sort would be unacceptable and..<br />
he's undertaking.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, Graeme Campbell said that<br />
Senator Richardson wasn't genuine on the environment and<br />
should be sacked as the Minister. Has Graeme Campbell<br />
got any case for arguing that and will any action be<br />
taken against him by the ALP?<br />
PM; Well, we're having history it's Sunday. That<br />
happened days and days ago<br />
JOURNALIST: There hasn't been any real response to it<br />
though has there?<br />
PM: Of course there has been, I mean, that's history. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Is Mr Campbell entitled to make those sort<br />
of comments in the middle of an election campaign?<br />
PM: I think he's very silly to make them.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, why is it inevitable that<br />
we'd return to what you describe as the industrial jungle<br />
under a coalition government? why in the 1990s couldn't<br />
a coalition government work with the union movement?<br />
PM: Well, let me put it this way. I will rely on the<br />
words of Mr Peacock, reported on 31. August last year,<br />
relatively recent words. His exact words were, if it's<br />
in the interests of Australia that governments withdraw<br />
from industrial disputes, there is, they should withdraw<br />
from wage fixing as such. So those are the words, not my<br />
words, the words of Mr Peacock. In other words, he's<br />
saying let it be decided directly between the parties.<br />
Now that's what they did at the beginning of the<br />
eighties, that's what gave you your 17 percent wages<br />
explosion, that's what gave you your worst recession in<br />
years. They are the people who are condemned to<br />
repeat the failures of the past because they will not<br />
learn from the lessons of the past. I am merely telling<br />
you what Mr Peacock's words are, It's reinforced by the<br />
fact that having said that at the end of August, that is<br />
governments get out, let the parties fight it out, in<br />
other words take control of disputes. Let them win their<br />
percent as they would have if it hadn't for the<br />
Government intervention, the airlines would have given<br />
them their 30 percent, the economy would have been<br />
wrecked. That's what Mr Peacock recommends. That's why<br />
the pilots have been urging his election. Now, if you're<br />
going to have that situation there's no wonder that just<br />
a few months later, at the end of November, on<br />
November, when he was asked well, what will be the wages<br />
outcome under your policies? The famous answer ' who's to<br />
know'. Now, it's Mr Peacock's own words which is saying<br />
that in the 90s you'd have a return to the disaster or<br />
the early 80s. His words, not mine, saying I can't tell<br />
you what the wages outcome would be, but I'm telling you<br />
that governments should stay out of disputes, governments<br />
should Stay out of wage fixing. Let's get back to the<br />
jungle, let the strong exercise their muscle and push up<br />
the wages to an unsustainable level.<br />
JOURNALIST: will you be seeing Mr Cain today?<br />
PM: No I don't plan to see Mr Cain today.<br />
JOURNALIST: It's Moomba time in Melbourne, doesn't it<br />
look a bit as though you're avoiding him, not..<br />
PM: You've got to have a fervid imagination my friend to<br />
say that I'm avoiding Mr Cain..<br />
JOURNALIST: Well, he wasn't at the Party launch. </p>
<p>PM: We, I mean, we've got historians here today. We've<br />
got, I mean, we've got something that happened about a<br />
week ago with Mr. Camupbell, we've got a question that's<br />
been asked and answered. Mr Cain had his Parliament on<br />
down here and he was in his Parliament. He was invited,<br />
but of course he had to be in the Parliament and have we<br />
got any more history?<br />
JOURNALIST: You're not avoiding Mr Cain?<br />
PM; Well, it's obvious I'm not avoiding Mr Cain. why<br />
would I be avoiding Mr Cain?<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you anticipate playing any further role<br />
at all in this metalworkers matter?<br />
PH: No I wouldn't think so. I've had the discussion with<br />
Mr Kelty. I don't see that I've got anything more to do.<br />
JOURNALIST: Let's move from history on to forecast. Do<br />
you think the 0pposition's going to stage a scare<br />
campaign on capital gains tax and superannuation<br />
industry?<br />
PM: Yes, what we've got is the classic conservative<br />
fortnight coming up. They never are able, in a campaign<br />
to sustain a positive campaign. Why? Because they've<br />
got no positive policies. So the classic case. What do<br />
they do? They try the scare campaign. They've done it<br />
before and they will do it, try it again. But let me say<br />
this in regard to their classic scare campaign. They're<br />
going to try and do it on capital gains, Well, we'll be<br />
ready and waiting for them on capital gains. As I just<br />
said earlier today, the classic quote in regard to<br />
capital gains comes from Professor Russell Matthews at<br />
the end of their previous period when he said the problem<br />
is to get the rich to pay any income tax at all. why?<br />
Because of the absence or a capital gains tax, the rich<br />
in this country were able to rort the system, they did.<br />
S They made the ordinary taxpayers of this country pay<br />
billions of dollars more because those with the greatest<br />
capacity to pay didn't. I brought in the capital gains<br />
tax and that means now that billions of dollars over this<br />
decade will go into the public revenue to be paid out on<br />
education, to be paid out on health, to be paid on roads,<br />
to be paid out on all the things that the great mass of<br />
Australian people want. But Mr Peacock says no, we'll<br />
abolish that tax, we'll take you back to the land of the<br />
tax rort, the tax evasion where his own Royal<br />
Commissioner said under them, tax evasion was the fastest<br />
growing industry in the land. Well if they, if they want<br />
to say that that's what they want to go back to, then I'm<br />
quite happy if that's their tack in the last fortnight of<br />
the campaign.<br />
JOURNALIST: ( inaudible)<br />
PM; Just a minute. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: You do concede that some surely will be<br />
worse of f because of the<br />
PM: No it's clear that under the arrangements that were<br />
brought in in 1988, which imposed a 15 percent tax on<br />
super funds to cover income which they'd got from<br />
dividend income, interest income and some capital gains,<br />
that under that we also allowed them to have imputation<br />
credits. That is there was a deliberate policy for the<br />
future of Australia that would encourage these quickly<br />
growing superannuation funds to invest their funds in<br />
Australian enterprises and to the extent that they do<br />
that, they get imputation credit because the company tax<br />
that is paid by the companies is then allowed as a credit<br />
and with a proper management of the funds there can be a<br />
total offset of the 15 percent tax. Now any<br />
JOURNALIST: use those credits which offset other<br />
taxes?<br />
PM: They can totally use the imputation credits to<br />
offset the 15 percent. Their income doesn't come just<br />
from capital gains. It comes from dividends, it comes<br />
from interest income as well and if they manage their<br />
funds in a way which involves investment in Australian<br />
equities, then those imputation credits can totally<br />
offset. There is no way, there is no way however you or<br />
anyone else try and beat this up, that you'll avoid the<br />
facts. And the basic fact is that this country was<br />
ruined, ruined totally through the absence of the capital<br />
gain tax. It was ruined because it was inequitable. I<br />
meunt that your ordinary Australian paid more. They<br />
walked out of office in 2983 with a top rate fo 60 cents<br />
in the dollar, a bottom rate of 30 cents. Why? ordinary<br />
Australians had to pay more because the rich weren't<br />
paying. That's Matthews' contention. That is the<br />
contention of every economist in the country. The<br />
ordinary Australian paid more because billions or dollars<br />
weren't being collected from the rich, as Matthews said.<br />
There'd been a revolt of the rich against the poor. The<br />
problem was to get the rich to pay any-thing at all and<br />
that happened because you didn't have a capital gains<br />
tax. We've brought it in and what Mr Peacock says is<br />
that they'll abolish that. That will mean inequity, it<br />
will mean the billions of dollars will not be paid by<br />
those who, who should pay. Less than one percent of<br />
Australian taxpayers pay the capital gains tax and<br />
JOURNALIST: Is Mr Peacock telling fibs when he says it<br />
will affect 4 million Australians through their super<br />
plans? PM4: Well, let's test whether Mr Peacock is telling, is<br />
in a fib telling mode. What have we had this, this<br />
week? We had this fantastic, in the literal sense of the<br />
word, this fantastic proposition that we have a $ 14<br />
billion hole in our forward estimates. Now you don't </p>
<p>need to be an economist and certainly Mr Peacock isn't,<br />
we all know that you don't need to be an economist to<br />
know that that was an outright lie because what he did<br />
was to look at the forward estimates and, and subtract<br />
' 39 from ' 92 and get this 14 billion. was a funny<br />
thing, because under the forward estimates which are<br />
talking about outlays, there are assumptions there about<br />
inflation. we had this marvellous proposition that you<br />
can assume inflation applies to one side, that is to<br />
outlays but it doesn't apply to the other side, revenue.<br />
The fact is if you apply the same assumptions which<br />
finish up with a $ 9 billion surplus at the end of ' 92,<br />
within a half a day, within half a day, mr Peacock<br />
because he'd been told by his own people, Andrew, you've<br />
been fibbing boyo notice how he dropped off that?<br />
At the same time he also tried the furphy about we're<br />
going to bring in a consumption tax. Within half a day<br />
that fib got put away because he was told, look, Andrew,<br />
this fib telling will go against you. The only people who<br />
are talking about a consumption tax are these people.<br />
Firstly, the President of the Liberal Party. My<br />
President is John Bannon he's not talking about a<br />
consumption tax, but it's the same Mr Elliott who in May<br />
of last year, after the coup, when he was asked whether<br />
Andrew Peacock would be a better leader than John Howard<br />
and he said yes. And he said, gratuitously he said, and<br />
I had a lot to do with Andrew when he was the Shadow<br />
Treasurer. I've talked to him about economic policy and<br />
he said, I think you'll like the economic policy you see<br />
coming from Andrew. Now that same John Elliott, the<br />
President of the Liberal Party, is-advocating a<br />
consumption tax. Howson wanted to include it in the<br />
Economic Action Plan, but he was talked out of it and<br />
couldn't have it then, but you know, might do it later,<br />
but you can't have it in the Economic Action Plan. The<br />
only area where a consumption tax is being talked about<br />
is by the Liberals, but what does Mr Peacock do? He gets<br />
up and says we're talking about a consumption tax. So Mr<br />
Peacock, because he's desperate, because he's got nothing<br />
positive to talk about is in the fib telling mode. The<br />
fib telling about the $ 14 billion hole which every<br />
economist has laughed him out of court on, down the<br />
gurgler, a consumption tax fib down the gurgler. So what<br />
he's saying about the capital gains tax in the same<br />
mod. JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, but surely you've accepted the<br />
fact that interest rates have cost you votes and that<br />
basically you can't predict<br />
PM; No, no, no. Let's get it straight. I didn't say<br />
that interest rates would cost us votes. I said that in<br />
fact interest rates was an issue. of course it is and I<br />
made the point that people who are thinking about<br />
interest rates, they will vote for us because our<br />
policies have been indicated by the banks as being<br />
policies under which interest rates will fall. Against<br />
that the policies of Mr Peacock must inevitably mean an </p>
<p>.4 7<br />
increase in interest rates. Why? The two things that<br />
governments can do which affect interest rates are can<br />
you control wages and what do you do about your budget.<br />
If you're going to have a wages explosion and if you're<br />
going to dissipate the budget surplus as the $ 6 billion<br />
hole of the Liberals will, then inevitably, wages<br />
explosion, busting your budget surplus means a rise in<br />
interest rates, And X'm saying that as far as the<br />
question of interest rates is in the minds of the<br />
electorates, I don't like what's happened but I think<br />
they understand. As I've said, if there'd been an easy<br />
way, we wouldn't have done it. If there were some other<br />
way, obviously would have. There was no way other than<br />
by tight monetary policy that you could slow down the<br />
level of imports which was unsustainable. We had to do<br />
that and the banking sector is saying that under these<br />
policies, mortgage rates will fall. Against that, people<br />
are thinking about interest rates, they must rise under<br />
the policies of the opposition.<br />
JOURNALIST: Sir, you don't think interest rates will<br />
cost you votes?<br />
PH: I am saying that to the extent that interest rates<br />
are thought about as an issue, then people will vote for<br />
us rather than the Opposition. I'm not saying that there<br />
may not be some people who are simply going to take the<br />
view, there've been high interest rates, we're hurt, and<br />
they'll vote against us on that. Ion saying that on<br />
balance, on balance, when people understand and they're<br />
thinking about the future. Which way are interest rates<br />
more likely to move under Hawke or under Peacock?<br />
Those people will realise that the banking sector is<br />
saying under our policies they're going to come down,<br />
whereas under his policies of a wages explosion and<br />
blowing out, blowing away the budget surplus, they must<br />
rise. JOURNALIST: But you said this morning you couldn't<br />
predict the outcome so it doesn't leave the electors much<br />
confidence in you.<br />
P14: No, and you seem may I say, with respect you are<br />
a partial'quoter or what I say. what I said this morning<br />
is that I can predict about those areas which 1, within<br />
Government, control. I can do something about wages. As<br />
I have predicted now over the past seven years on wages,<br />
we have been either spot on or the wages outcome has been<br />
somewhat lower than what we've talked about. Now we can<br />
say in regard to wages what the outcome will be. Mr<br />
Peacock can't. He shrugged his shoulders and said ' who's<br />
to know'. Everyone's to know, that is the wages will<br />
explode. The second thing that I can control is the<br />
budget outcome and under my proposal, in this election<br />
campaign, before we have promised to spend one cent we<br />
first of all fixed the savings so that whatever promise I<br />
make is fully funded. Against that Mr Peacock has a<br />
situation where he has at least $ 6 billion of unfunded </p>
<p>promises. So the two things that, that can control as a<br />
government which will affect interest rates, it goes my<br />
way because we'll have wages predictability and we'll<br />
have the preservation of the budget surplus. The other?<br />
Can't do it.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, just on dividend imputation,<br />
one final question.<br />
PM: Yes.<br />
JOURNALIST: Is it not so that dividend imputation was<br />
designed to remove what was effectively a double tax<br />
rather than, as you seem to be implying, designed to<br />
offset the impact of CGT on superannuation funds?<br />
PM: ends </p>
