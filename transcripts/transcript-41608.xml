    <content><![CDATA[<p>Well Mr President, welcome.</p>
<p>Our two nations have a shared history and we have been honouring today, the service and the sacrifice of those who fought to defend the freedom of France and the freedom of Australia a hundred years ago and who have done so in the generations that followed.</p>
<p>In the Second World War – you honoured veterans from a legion of honour, Second World War veterans – and of course as you were discussing with James, our forces worked together and are working together in the Middle East in Afghanistan today. Always defending the same values in freedom’s cause.</p>
<p>France is a Pacific power. You have 1.6 million citizens of France living in our region, in the Indo Pacific. 8,000 defence personnel in our region. We have extensive commercial and scientific partnerships.</p>
<p>We are building the most advanced submarines in the world together and as we discussed last night, Thales Australia has developed the most innovative, the finest, protective vehicles in the world, the Bushmasters. Innovation here in Australia.</p>
<p>Still, there is so much more to do.</p>
<p>Mr President, welcome. Because your presence in Australia is going to ensure that the partnership, the friendship, cooperation between Australia and France accelerates and becomes even greater still in the years to come.</p>
<p>Welcome to Australia.</p>
<p><strong>[Ends]</strong></p>
