SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER. THlE HON P J KCEATING MP<br />
TO THE AUSTRALIA-NEW ZEALAND BUSINESS COUNCIL<br />
AUSTRALIA, NEW ZEALAND AND THE REGION<br />
AUCKLAND FRIDAY. 21 MAY 1993<br />
Few relationships between countries are as close, with s0<br />
much mutual benefit and so few differences. as the<br />
relationship between Austral * ia and New Zealand. It is a<br />
relationship in which we literally take each other's good<br />
will and candour for granted, as I believe we should and<br />
always will.<br />
But where once our fellow feeling arose out of a shared<br />
sense of Isolation In this part of the world, my<br />
discussions today with your Prime Minister and Cabinet,<br />
and with your Opposition leadership, confirmed the<br />
thought I've had for some time: the basis of our<br />
relationship is rapidly changing.<br />
Today we share not a sense of isolation but a knowledge<br />
of opportunity.<br />
Not a suspicion that we are in the wrong part of the<br />
world, but a conviction that we are In the right one.<br />
Not a sense that we can depend only upon each other, but<br />
that we are both part of a great web of production and<br />
t rade f rom your South I slIand up through. East As ia to<br />
Japan's northern islands, and from Indc China to the East<br />
coast of the United States.<br />
You with your Asia 2000 program, we with the rapid<br />
reorientation of Australian Industry, are finally coming<br />
to terms with geography. We both remain determined to<br />
integrate our economies, but we are now conscious that<br />
our future lies not with each other, but In the wider<br />
region not separately, not jointly, but companionably.<br />
Like most Australians, I am well aware of the energy and<br />
rapidity with which New Zealand has been restructuring<br />
its economy, and I have followed your national debates on<br />
economic reform with great interest.<br />
And as New Zealand has changed, so too has Australia. Ii </p>
<p>2<br />
It is most visible in our trade performance. Over a<br />
decade, exports have more than doubled. A decade ago<br />
barely one dollar in eight in Australia came from<br />
exports. Today it is one dollar in five, and climbing.<br />
Today manufactures and services each rival rural exports,<br />
and both are growing. The fastest growing manufactured<br />
exports are elaborately transformed goods and New<br />
Zealand is our biggest ETM market, as we are yours.<br />
As our exports have grown and the nature of our exports<br />
has changed, their destination has also changed. A<br />
decade ago less than half of our merchandise exports<br />
went to East Asia. Today nearly two thirds do and our<br />
exports to Asia are far and away the fastest growing part<br />
of our trade.<br />
The ASEAN countries are now a more important export<br />
market for us than either the US or the EC.<br />
Behind these changes in our trading performance are the<br />
efforts of Australian industry, and deliberate changes to<br />
government policy.<br />
We have opened up the economy by floating the dollar,<br />
abolishing capital controls, and putting in place a<br />
sensible, consistent program of tariff reductions.<br />
We have doubled productivity on our wharves, and reduced<br />
crew levels on coastal shipping to the OECD average.<br />
We have introduced competition into telecommunications<br />
and deregulated air transport.<br />
We have introduced a national system of enterprise<br />
bargaining, which we intend to sustain and encourage<br />
through comprehensive legislation later this year.<br />
We have over a decade maintained an Accord with the trade<br />
union movement which has been a significant factor in<br />
reducing inflation to one of the lowest rates among<br />
industrial countries.<br />
And as a result of tax refo-rms we now have one of. the<br />
lowest ratios of tax to GDP in the OECD.<br />
The change continues today. we are cutting the company<br />
tax rate f rom 39 per cent to 33 per cent. We have<br />
liberalised depreciation provisions to encourage<br />
investment in long lived plant and equipment. We have<br />
Introduced a conditional 10 per cent Investment allowanc6<br />
for plant and equipment, and an additional 10 per cent<br />
development allowance for approved projects with a<br />
capital cost over $ 50 million. </p>
<p>After the recession of the late eighties we are advancing<br />
Into the nineties with consistently higher productivity<br />
growth than we have had for a generation, low inflation,<br />
arnd the lowest level of industrial disputes for decades.<br />
We have a trade surplus, and manufacturing production is<br />
rising.<br />
There is no doubt the structure of the Australian economy<br />
is changing, anid that we have the policies in place and<br />
under development to maintain the pace.<br />
But change is easier and faster when the entire economy<br />
Is growing rapidly, when young people are confident they<br />
will be able to find jobs and older people are confident<br />
they will keep theirs.<br />
Our growth Is still not fast enough to generate the jobs<br />
we need to rapidly reduce unemployment, and I am more<br />
than ever convinced that the package of investment<br />
incentives and company tax cuts and of jobs programs,<br />
together with an Accord which focused on employment, was<br />
the right package to put before Australians in our recent<br />
election.<br />
We are not doing as well as we need to; and the world<br />
economy is not doing well enough. It is troubling to see<br />
Europe doing so little to move out of the economic<br />
trough. It is troubling to see growth moderate at best<br />
in the US and very slow in Japan and Mr Bolger and I<br />
warmly welcomed Mr Miyazawals recent package to stimulate<br />
the Japanese economy.<br />
If there is one thing which I believe can increase<br />
confidence and optimism worldwide, it would be a<br />
successful conclusion to the Uruguay Round this year.<br />
This is Australia's single most important trade<br />
objective. President Clinton has made reaching an agreement a top<br />
priority and asked Congress for an extension of-his<br />
authority to conclude-the negotiation.--<br />
The French Government appears to have recognised the<br />
importance of concluding the round. And I particularly<br />
applaud the decision of the Japanese Government to offer<br />
last weekend a significant package of tariff cuts as part<br />
of the round.<br />
It defies logic that the US and the EC and Japan. so<br />
close to agreement, with so much to gain and with a clear<br />
choice between cheering on a world recovery and<br />
stimulating their own trade, or puncturing recovery and<br />
encouraging the decay of the trade rules which have<br />
created the modern world economy, will let the<br />
opportunity pass them by. </p>
<p>But we cannot take a successful completion of the Uruguay<br />
Round for granted. In fact, there are forces at work<br />
which may mean that the Round will simply fade away.<br />
Certainly we will do all we possibly can to advance an<br />
agreement, and already our Trade Minister Peter Cook has<br />
arranged a meeting of the Cairns Group at the end of June<br />
to register the concerns of fair traders in agriculture.<br />
But the deadlines are now real ones and there Is no<br />
guarantee that they will be met.<br />
We must have by the end of this year an agreement which<br />
can be submitted to the US Congress, which effectively<br />
means we need to see real progress by the G7 meeting In<br />
Tokyo in July.<br />
Over the last decade both our countries have greatly<br />
benefited from the mutual tariff reductions and other<br />
liberalisation undertaken as a result of CER.<br />
In the decade since we signed the agreement trans-Tasman<br />
trade has tripled. The total value of Investment between<br />
our two countries has Increased nine fold.<br />
We have continued to benefit from the free movement of<br />
people between our two countries, based on the Trans-<br />
Tasman Travel arrangement which does more than anything<br />
else to unite us.<br />
Today several hundred thousand New Zealanders are living<br />
in Australia, and might I say, -the issue Iof social.-<br />
security accounting asid e, they are contributing a great<br />
deal to the economic and social life of Australia and<br />
strengthening the bonds which bind us.<br />
In the development of our economic relationship we are<br />
now entering a highly significant new phase.<br />
We are still working towards greater economic<br />
integration, with important achievements in prospect in<br />
areas such as the recognit ion. of occupations and mutual<br />
recognition or common standards In goods. We have also<br />
made substantial progress in developing new arrangements<br />
to facilitate trans-Tasman passenger movements.<br />
But we both recognise that the main game is now our<br />
integration in the Asia-Pacific region a point which Hr<br />
Bolger put forcefully and succinctly in his Tokyo speech<br />
earlier this month.<br />
The new CER phase of integration of standards and<br />
certification has Important implicaio6ns for our<br />
iiif_ 4giia~ tT~ nith the region, as I shall explain later. </p>
<p>My conviction that the 15 member APEC group, which<br />
comprises the major economies of the Asia-Pacific region,<br />
is the right vehicle for Asia-Pacific integration is<br />
based on a few fundamental facts.<br />
The first is that North America anid the Western Pacific<br />
are infinitely better off if they work together than if<br />
they drift apart.<br />
North America is still East Asia's biggest export market.<br />
And East Asia is rapidly becoming more important to the<br />
United States.<br />
At the same time the East Asia region Is accounting for<br />
an increasing share of both world trade and world output.<br />
This has been an extraordinary, historic shift one of<br />
inestimable importance for the conduct of world affairs.<br />
Yet it has by and large occurred in advance of the<br />
sustaining net of understandings upon which trade<br />
conflict can be controlled.<br />
This is why we see today a great contrast between the<br />
mutuality In the actual trade pattern, and the acrimony<br />
in the trade rhetoric.<br />
In reality it is a great cooperative enterprise which is<br />
lifting us all up.<br />
In the rhetoric it is a bitter battle for crumbs.<br />
Given enough tfmte. ' enough ill lull, enou~ h<br />
misunderstanding, and the rhetoric will threaten to<br />
overwhelm the fact.<br />
So there is a contrast between the sophistication of the<br />
success of commerce in the region, and the rudimentary<br />
nature of the political nets which sustain it a<br />
contrast which threatens some day to threaten the<br />
underlying process of integration, and which gives life<br />
to the mistaken Idea that East Asia can go Its way<br />
without North America, -or North America without East<br />
Asia. This is the fundamental reason for the importance of<br />
APEC. But there is another reason too; and that is that<br />
APEC alone is capable of becoming the forum for arranging<br />
the next great leap In trade In the region, for improving<br />
on Uruguay Round outcomes to enhance trade in the region. </p>
<p>As I told a conference in Sydney in February, we should<br />
be seeking as our goal an integrated market which<br />
includes Australia and New Zealand, the ASEAN countries,<br />
the three Chinas, Korea. Japan and North America a<br />
market of two billion people producing half the world's<br />
output, bound together with harmonised trade rules,<br />
harmonised Investment rules. harmonised standards and<br />
certification, and an agreed way of settling disputes<br />
between members.<br />
It would be a market where trade between its members<br />
already accounts for two thirds of their own trade and<br />
where the total exports of the region already account for<br />
per cent of world exports.<br />
It would be an integrated regional market which had a<br />
place for inner markets like the CER and ASEAN's AFTA,<br />
and the North American NAFTA, but which nonetheless works<br />
towards commonality and minimum restriction in all areas<br />
in which these can sensibly be advanced.<br />
We could look at the possibilities for sectoral trade<br />
liberalisation, when the results of the Uruguay Round<br />
become clear.<br />
But quite apart from tariff changes, we ought to be able<br />
to achieve progress towards harmonisation or mutual<br />
recognition of food standards, consumer electronics and<br />
labelling.<br />
We ought to be able to work towards an arrangement where<br />
our different approaches to competition, compan-Y law and.<br />
business practice -are less of a hindrance to trade.<br />
We ought to be able to agree on investment principles to<br />
encourage and facilitate the vast growth of investment<br />
between APEC members.<br />
And we ought to be able to set up a mechanism for talking<br />
through trade conflicts between members.<br />
We should be able -to do all these things and more because<br />
they all share this characteristic it is very easy . to<br />
imagine how many -industries and how -many mil1lions of<br />
people will be better off if we do them. It is much more<br />
difficult to imagine which industries and which people in<br />
the region will be worse off.<br />
All it takes is mutual agreement that it should be done,<br />
and the time and intelligence of governments to decide on<br />
appropriate standards, the appropriate forms of mutual<br />
recognition, the appropriate harmonisation of conflicting<br />
rules. It is something Europe is already successfully doing.<br />
And It is something Australia and New. Zealand are<br />
beginning to succeed in doing. </p>
<p>while the task is obviously much easier for our two<br />
countries, New Zealand and Australia can be a model for<br />
this process of APEC-wide liberalisation and<br />
harmonisation. We have already come a very long way since 1983, not only<br />
in terms of reducing bilateral barriers to goods and<br />
services trade and Investment, but also in creating an<br />
appropriate business environment for Australian and New<br />
Zealand companies.<br />
For example, under CER we are undertaking a significant<br />
business law harmonTiation exercise and we are actively<br />
harmonising our customs and quarantine arrangements. In<br />
some areas such as our 1988 Trade in Services Protocol<br />
CER is at the cutting edge of International trade<br />
pol icy.<br />
A particularly good example of the way in which CER can<br />
reinforce what we want to do regionally is in the area of<br />
standards. Five years ago we signed an agreement on technical<br />
barriers to trade which encourages the harmonisation of<br />
standards and certification procedures.<br />
Further work is underway between our two countries.<br />
Our Cabinet decided at the begi nning of this month that<br />
we should go ahead and do more work on the mutual<br />
recognition of regulations relating to goods and<br />
occupations and on the development of joint standards.<br />
Our National Food Authority and your New Zealand<br />
counterpart are now actively working towards the<br />
establishment of a single standards setting system for<br />
Australia and New Zealand.<br />
So Australia and New Zealand have shown that<br />
administrative impediments to trade can be reduced or<br />
eliminated, and-that It. is worthwhile to do so.<br />
When completed, our integration will be a model of the<br />
success of two countries in making trade between them<br />
nearly as simple and uncomplicated as trade within them.<br />
We can bring to the APEC group some of the lessons of<br />
negotiated mutual recognition and harmonisation of<br />
standards which we are learning in the CER.<br />
These are our intermediate goals, and the APEC countries<br />
have put in place processes which can help us realise<br />
them.<br />
We have established an eminent persons group, for<br />
example, for which New Zealand has provided a<br />
secretariat. </p>
<p>I understand It Is the intention of the group, which is<br />
chaired by Dr Fred Dergeten of the United States, to<br />
produce in good time for a meeting of APEC Ministers in<br />
November In Seattle some thoughts about how regional<br />
Integration should proceed.<br />
Then there Is the preparation for the Ministerial meeting<br />
itself, which many APEC governments are giving a good<br />
deal of thought. My own feeling is that we need to adopt<br />
at that meeting some sort of framework agreement which<br />
outlines our goals, and also an action plan or schedule<br />
which will guide our work over the next few years.<br />
Last year I suggested that a process of periodic meetings<br />
of APEC leaders would also help to stimulate a stronger<br />
sense of regional commonality and mutual interest, and I<br />
have been delighted by the positive response of many APEC<br />
members. I think these are good medium term goals, and of course<br />
they beg the question of what our longer term goals<br />
should be. As I say, we would certainly encourage<br />
progress towards an integrated market. and an integrated<br />
production zone an Asia Paci-fic EconomicCommunjty.<br />
Perhaps some day It will be relevant to think about a<br />
regional free trade agreement and by this I mean an<br />
agreement open to all APEC members, which covers a high<br />
proportion of our trade, and which commits all of us to<br />
substantial liberalisation beyond that already agreed<br />
globally in the GATT.'-<br />
As parties to a very successful preferential arrangement<br />
like CER neither of our two countries can claim to be<br />
opposed to preferential agreements in principle. The<br />
United States, Canada and Mexico are building their own<br />
preferential free trade areas, as are the ASEAN<br />
countries. But I do think the issue of whether a regional<br />
preferential trade arrangement-could one day be given<br />
serious consideration can be postponied uiij we are very<br />
much further down the path of open econoic integration<br />
and of creating an Asia Pacific Economic Community.<br />
The practical and theoretical problems of creating a<br />
region-wide free trade area would of course be Immense.<br />
We need a good deal more practice in economic cooperation<br />
before we contemplate something so ambitious: something<br />
that would change the political as well as the economic<br />
configuration of the globe in fundamental ways. </p>
<p>I remain utterly convinced however, that a gelectiver<br />
trans-Pacific free trade area would fatally undermine the<br />
most fundamental reason we are pursuing KPEC, which is to<br />
knit together the North American and East Asian<br />
economies. The sort of thing I am arguing against is the idea which<br />
the United States seemed to be seriously considering last<br />
year of a network of bilateral preferent~ al trade<br />
agreements which would align some Pacific trading nations<br />
against others.<br />
Whatever slight trade advantages there might be for<br />
individual players on this side of the Pacific a link<br />
with NAFTA would to my mind be at the expense of and<br />
completely overwhelmed by the strategic damage to APEC.<br />
Earlier today in Wellington I said that Australia and New<br />
Zealand stood on the threshold of a new era in our<br />
history. We have the opportunity in this decade to<br />
integrate ourselves with the fastest growing economies in<br />
the world, and in so doing lay the basis for long term<br />
prosperity. As never before it seems to me very much a matter of<br />
making our own history, seizing our time, in our part of<br />
the world.<br />
In Australia more than a decade ago 1. and some of my<br />
colleagues, began to imagine that Australia could become<br />
a successful manufacturing and trading nation: that we<br />
could develop a creative and co-operative industrial<br />
culture: and that we could seize our opportunities to be<br />
a substantial player in this most dynamic region of the<br />
world. It seemed to some of us that, contrary to the wisdom of<br />
generations, Australia need not remain just an exporter<br />
of commodities that we could do both: we could continue<br />
to export the agricultural and rural products and the<br />
minerals, and we could make things for export.<br />
These thoughts -very. rapidly _ moved from the realm of<br />
imagination to that-of necessity.<br />
Like you, we learnt in the 1980s that there was no choice<br />
but to radically change our financial and industrial<br />
culture, to re-orient ourselves to Asia and the Pacific,<br />
and open ourselves to world at large. To add value to our<br />
products. Our economic survival depended on our willingness and<br />
capacity to do these things.<br />
This is the story of the last decade. It will be the<br />
story of the next.-In my view no previous generation of<br />
Australians or New Zealanders lived in a more exciting<br />
era, or one on which their countries' -future so depended. </p>
<p>Along the way New Zealand and Australia have at times<br />
chosen different paths. But the goal has been the same.<br />
And it remains the same. It is no less an imperative now<br />
than It was a decade ago.<br />
Yet for all we do as Governments, our success or failure<br />
ultimately depends upon our people the degree of their<br />
enterprise, the level of their imagination and skill,<br />
their willingness to co-operate, their capacity to<br />
change. In Australia it is the changes we have already made which<br />
convince me of our capacity to change in the future.<br />
Our successes in the arena of industrial relations, the<br />
transformation of workplaces, the move from an<br />
adversarial culture to a co-operative one these have<br />
been revolutionary changes in Australia.<br />
That Is one example. The proliferation of new dynamic<br />
small to medium sized businesses is another. McKinseys<br />
recently identified In Australia 700 companies born of<br />
the new manufacturing and export culture, making products<br />
Australian companies have never contemplated making,<br />
succeeding in markets where Australian companies never<br />
contemplated going.<br />
I have no doubt that New Zealand could point to similar<br />
achievements. On both sides of the Tasman it seems to me<br />
we can take considerable pride and confidence from the<br />
proof of the changes we have made, and the rewards which<br />
are now beginning to f low our way.<br />
And we might also take as a measure of our capacity to<br />
meet the challenges we face the progress we have made<br />
towards Closer Economic Relations between Australia and<br />
N~ ew Zealand. CER, too, has been a response to the<br />
challenge.<br />
CER will give us a better chance in the world. And if,<br />
taking heart from our success with CER, we push on with<br />
the task of creating an Asia Pacific Economic Community,<br />
It will have ' given us much more than that.<br />
It will have given us the basis of prosperity and a good<br />
society: it will have given us the confidence that comes<br />
with knowing that what we have we earned by dint of<br />
imagination and courage, and by believing in ourselves<br />
and in the future of Australia and New Zealand.<br />
Thank you. </p>
