PRIME MINISTER<br />
E. O. E. -PROOF ONLY<br />
PRESS CONFERENCE PRIME MINISTER BRUSSELS HILTON,<br />
4 FEBRUARY 1985, 4.30 P. M.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister there have been some developments<br />
since we left Australia on the question of the KX missile. Is it<br />
still your Government's intention to permit the U. S. to use our<br />
facilities for the tracking or monitoring or whatever of the rnisZ.<br />
I don't think it's appropriate for me to convey Governe. it<br />
decisions in such an important area via the media where I am in<br />
the position that I'm about to go to the United States. Clearly<br />
when I'm in the United States and having discussions not only<br />
with the President but with other administration officials this<br />
is an issue that will be discussed. Not only this issue itself, bi;.<br />
let me make it clear we will be discussing a range of related issues<br />
I'll. be making it very clear to the United States' administration<br />
that the Australian Government is not giving support to the<br />
strategic defence initiative. We'll be putting a firm position<br />
ac my Foreign. Minister, Bill Rayden, haa bcn putting before in<br />
respect of the CTfl. And so there's a range of related issues<br />
that I'll be dealing with in my discussions with the United<br />
States administration. Now I believe it's appropriate that when<br />
I've had those discussions that I'll be available after that t~ o<br />
discuss these matters with you.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister does that-now mean that the question<br />
of the MX is now hanging.<br />
I don't put it as hanging. .1 put it in these terms, that<br />
we that is when I say we, the then Minister for Defence, Mr<br />
Scholes, and Mr Hayden, the Foreign Minister, and myself when<br />
we considered this matter did not make a decision lightly. We Ware<br />
aware of the considerable importance of the matter. Now the issue<br />
has become a public issue and I have become aware of the extent of.<br />
ffi-llnun nn thtl 111MUC f~ jj7 WhIghl I MnA9rVtjnd Now I'm simpi'<br />
saying that I will be taking those into account. I'll be also,<br />
as I say, discussing this whole range of issues with the United<br />
States administration. And I believe it appropriate, as I hope you<br />
would understand, that it makes more sense that I talk with you<br />
on these matters after I've had those discussions.<br />
JOURNALIST-. Prime Minister, on that point, where does it leave<br />
you when obviously the Left Is against it, the Centre Left is<br />
against it, even some of your own factional support Centre Unity<br />
in Victoria and people within NSW are against it. What can you<br />
talk about with President Reagan in regard to this whole issue and<br />
still leave yourself reasonably flexible in terms of the Australian<br />
population. soI/ </p>
<p>Well I obviously have had conveyed to me certain views<br />
within Australia arnd I would be wanting to in terms of informing<br />
myself about the range of Views to wait until I got back to<br />
Australia to have further discussions. But let me say that<br />
I have no apprehension about that. I understand the very<br />
considerable feelings that there are on this issue. I will<br />
go to the United states with a very clear intention as I say<br />
of putting a strong position to the United States administration<br />
on a range of iwsue in which it will be quite clear that the<br />
position of the Australian Government is not at one with that<br />
of the United States administration. I have indicated that in<br />
regard to two matters the SDI and the CTB and it's within<br />
that framework that I will listen to what's said. I'll be<br />
putting particular points of view about those related issues.<br />
And I think it's in the light, of those discussions, which after<br />
all are going to take place in a rolativoly short time, that this<br />
whole matter will be more fruitfully open to discussion both<br />
with you, as representatives of the media, and with those various<br />
interests to which you refer in your question.<br />
JOURNALIST: Would you see it consistent with Australia's<br />
responsibilities under ANZUS and with the U. S. under the alliance<br />
not to go ahead with support for the MX missile decision.<br />
Well, I'mt not going to take that discussion any further<br />
Greg at this point. I mean I'm not going to~ avoid the issue at<br />
the appropriate time. I think it's more appropriate to have that<br />
discussion with you after I've put cQrtain positions in my<br />
* discussions in the United States. I c-an assure you that I will<br />
be open to discussions with you at the appropriate time.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke does Friday's statement still stand.<br />
P. K: Which Friday statement are you referring to.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Beazley's statement on this matter-<br />
Well I believe he made the Friday~ statement. I think be's<br />
issuing another.<br />
JOURNALISTi Ile's only said some other things that happoad, but<br />
Friday's statement was that approval had been given.<br />
Yes well that is a satement of-fact. Approval had bean<br />
given. That is true. I mean there is nothing that can be said<br />
by me now or at some subsequent stage which changes that fact.<br />
What I'm saying to you is that I'm going to have discussions<br />
in the United States. I'm obviously going to take account of<br />
what's conveyed to me by my colleagues in Australia as well.<br />
And it's going to be in the light of the discussions that I have<br />
in the United States and in the light of the assessment of what<br />
I hear also from Australia and the discussions that I have with<br />
mny Ministers in Australia that V1l1 be able to speak with you.<br />
FSCi" 4 1 </p>
<p>3.<br />
JOURNALIST: Why didn't you also have these discussions before<br />
at the time with your Ministers. Why didn't you take this<br />
matter to Cabinet as you knew it was so important.<br />
Well there is a range of issues for which you have under<br />
our set-up, the Security Committee. This matter was considered<br />
by that Commuittee and reconsidered again. Now the issue has<br />
developed further and the appropriate procesces in the light<br />
of those facts will be followed after the discussions I've had<br />
in the United States.<br />
JOURNALIST) Surely the decisions were made at the time for<br />
harsh political and military reasons. What's changed apart from..<br />
Let me make this point that it was not a decision that<br />
Mr Hayden and Mr Scholes and myself mad* flippantly. I hope<br />
that even those who are expressing most vehemently disagreement<br />
with that decision will accept that the Foreign Minister and<br />
myself and the then Minister for Defence thought about this<br />
issue in the light of the considerations then applying. Now<br />
it makes proper sense that in the light of the current<br />
circumstances that we examine tho docision, that we look at<br />
it in the light of the discussions I have in the United States<br />
and with the people in Australia who are now properly involved<br />
and concerned, And I will follow those processes.<br />
JOURNALIST: What I was going to put to you Prime Minister was<br />
is it not the case that we are presently committed to assiating<br />
the Americans with their MX missile tests and that situation<br />
could well change.<br />
As a result of the decisions that was conveyed to the<br />
Americans that is a fair statement of what the position is.<br />
Now I've made it clear I hope now this is the last time becaus-<br />
I've said it I think three or four times 6lroady that the<br />
matter will be discussed amongst others, where I'll be putting<br />
a very strong-position as I say on certain other related issues#<br />
the matter will be discussed when I'm in thc United Statas. And<br />
then it will be discussed when I get back to Australia. Now<br />
you don't have discussions for tho cako of just hearing words.<br />
It may be that out of those discussions there will be a development<br />
of position. But it's quite inappropriate that bofore I hava<br />
those discussions that I should go any further.<br />
JOURNALIST: If Australia does rescind its approval to co-operate<br />
with the MX tests could any parallel be drawn between that and the<br />
New Zealand refusal to allow port visits by nuclear powered ships.<br />
I believe not.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister is it possible that you are somewhat<br />
out of step with the feeling in Australia on this gu aion.<br />
FROM 34' 2 313e126Me2.04 20: 48 </p>
<p>I think it could be said quite clearly I mean one would<br />
be a fool to say otherwise that the decision that was made<br />
by myself and Mr Scholes and Mr Hayden and confirmed by the<br />
Security Committee, it obviously is the case that that decision<br />
is not in line with the attitude of a number of people. It's<br />
obviously clear.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister are you indicating that you are<br />
going to be influenced by the feelings in Australia now and<br />
you're going to indicate what the decisions are after you've<br />
seen President Reagan. To what extent are you going to be<br />
influenced by what you discuss with him. is he going to<br />
influence your decision.<br />
No I'm not saying that. As in the original case, no-one<br />
determines the position for this Government from outside of<br />
Australia on this or any other issue. The decision that<br />
was taken by Mr Hayden, Mr Scholes and myself was not determined<br />
externally. It was a sovereign autonomous decision by the<br />
three Ministers concerned and confirmed subsequently by the<br />
Security Committee. My Government is not in the position and<br />
not in the business of having its mind made up for it by any<br />
Government outside of Australia the United States Government,<br />
the United Kingdom Government or any other Government. And it<br />
has not been in that position up until now and it won't be in the<br />
future. JOURNALIST-Is it a case now of you going to the Americans<br />
and suggesting to them that they might like to switch the<br />
tests elsewhere. It's not a matter for me to conduct discussions with<br />
sovereign governments through a news conference and say via th.-<br />
news conference before I meet a head of government, look this<br />
is what I'm going to be talking to you about. I mean that's<br />
never the way I've conducted my business.-I don't intend to<br />
start now.<br />
JOURNALIST: Are you saying the Government isn't bound any more<br />
by the Fraser Government's decision.<br />
Well Mr Hayden and Mr Scholes and myself did not make<br />
the decision in terms of saying that a decision made by a previous<br />
Government of itself bound this Government. It was a factor<br />
that we took into account.<br />
JOURNALIST: How did you equate that decision with the Government's<br />
professed policy of not supporting the development of first<br />
strike capacity. r w o .105<br />
FROM 32 2 5130126' 85.82.04 21: 03 </p>
<p>FR* OM 32 2 5130126 185.02.04 21105<br />
Well I think if you have a look at the transcriptz of<br />
Mr Beazley's press conference. where the question of first<br />
strike was put to him, you will see an absolutely correct<br />
statement by Mr Beazley that when you talk about first strike<br />
you're not talking about a capacity, you're talking about<br />
an intention. I believe that was a perfectly correct statarnent<br />
by Mr Beazley. Let me make it quite clear by way of obvious<br />
corollary to that statement that if there by any perception on<br />
the part of we three Ministers that there was that " Intention<br />
on the part of the United States which intention is necessary<br />
for it to be a first strike, there simply would not have been<br />
any involvement by my-~ Government with it.<br />
JOURNALISTt Prime Minister are you in a position to say<br />
what influenced your decision at the time. What prompted you<br />
make the decision.<br />
Well let me say that in the statement that has been<br />
made by Mr Beazley there is an indication of the considerations<br />
that here was a position where a previous Govenment had made<br />
a decision as I said in answer, I think it was to Mike, that<br />
of itself is not enough. I mean vie are not saying that because<br />
any previous Government had made a decision our authority or<br />
capacity to consider it ceases. But in the alliance relationship<br />
that we have with the United States and on the assumptions<br />
that we made about the intention of the United States in regard<br />
to the possible use of this capacity, which I emphasise to you,<br />
our assessment was that there was no intention on the part<br />
of the United States to regard this as a first strike weapon then<br />
taking all those things into account we made the decision that<br />
we did. I'm not trying to suggest to you that it was one of<br />
easiest decisions that confronted Ministers involved. We'took<br />
it. Now obviously at this stage and I repeat, I think, for the<br />
fifth time -1 hope it will be sufficient I'm not saying it<br />
by way of criticism, I understand the interest that's involved"<br />
in this subject, but I do hope you'll accept what I've said now,<br />
I've put it-. in good faith but we obviously in our discussions<br />
with the United States on a whole range of related issues we'll<br />
be having further discussions about this matter. And included<br />
within those discussions will be the question of the attitude<br />
in regard to this capacity which has been tested and a whole<br />
range of other considerations. I'll have those discussions<br />
and further discussions when I get back to Australia. But I'll<br />
be prepared to talk with the press at both stages following<br />
my discussions in the United States and obviously when I return<br />
to Australia.<br />
JOURNALIST: Have you been surprised by the extent, breadth and<br />
depth of the reaction.-to this issue in Australia.<br />

<p>FROM ' 32 2 5130126 850.4 21 106<br />
0 6.<br />
It's a good question, it's a hard one. I can understand<br />
the concern that people have about trying to have a world which<br />
is going to have the opportunity of simply saying living at peace,<br />
but a world in which there is going to be practical progress<br />
towards producing a position between the superpowers whiare the<br />
concept of deterr-ence which has operated since 1935 to relieve<br />
the world from the horror of nuclear conflict can operate at a<br />
lesser level of armament. I can understand that and I say<br />
unashamedly that while perhaps I don't make as much noise as<br />
some people about this I yield to no-one in my concern and<br />
involvement in that area. Now I understand that the decision.<br />
has generated some concern, I believe unfoundedly, that the decision<br />
of itself represents some diminution or derogation from our<br />
Government's commitments to those high purposes. I simply want<br />
to say through this opportunity to the people of Australia tho<br />
decision that was taken by myself and my two Ministers did not<br />
represent any such diminution. Indeed I think it's a matter of<br />
record that this Government and its Foreign Minister in 1983<br />
and 1984 has pursued vigorously, and I believe demonstrably<br />
effectively in many areas, the concern of this G ' overnment with<br />
those issues. We haven't believed that the decision that was<br />
taken then obviously Mr Hayden and Mr Scholes, but Mr Hayden<br />
particularly who had a continuing responsibility in these other<br />
forums has not believed on behalf of the Government that the<br />
decision that was taken at that time operated in any way to<br />
diminish our commitment to or advocacy for a reduction of the<br />
levels of armaments in the relations between the two maior Dowers.<br />
We have steadfastly pursued in every forum, particularly in the<br />
Committee of Disarmament, processes and strategies calculated<br />
in a variety of ways to try and reduce the level of tension, to<br />
try and get processes which are going to reduce the level of<br />
armaments. We are unqualified, absolutely unqualified in that<br />
commitment. Now I see that some people regard the decition that<br />
was taken as in some sense representing a diminution of that<br />
commitment. All I say to my colleagues and to the Australian<br />
people that that is not a correct assessment. We yield to<br />
no-one in our commitment to pursue within all relevant fora to<br />
pursuit of the reduction of the level of armaments so that we'<br />
can got a more substantial basis for peaceful relations in the<br />
world than a continuing escalation of the level of armaments.<br />
