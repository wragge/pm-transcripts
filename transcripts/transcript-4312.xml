MEDIA RELEASE Released in Lismorc<br />
8 February 1977<br />
The Labor Party was getting up to its old tricks in<br />
wanzing to bring back the kind of policies that have contributed to<br />
the worst inflation and unemployment in Australia's history, the<br />
Deputy Prime Minister and Member for Richmond, Mr Anthony said in<br />
. isr. ore today. Mr Anthony said the Government was acutely aware of the<br />
damage being caused by inflation, and of the personal suffering of<br />
individuals and families caused by unemployment.<br />
The Government was doing all it could in very difficult<br />
eco:. omic circumstances to sustain the unemployed and help them<br />
through their difficulties while resolutely tackling the basic problem<br />
of inflation.<br />
0 He said the four point economic package put forward by the<br />
Opposition was based on precisely the approach that had pushed the<br />
Budget deficit to massive and highly inflationary levels.<br />
" The Government is battling to clear up the aftermath of<br />
the Whitlam Government's big spending, the effects of which are still<br />
damaging Australia through high inflation and record unemployment,"<br />
Mr Anthony said.<br />
" Yet we now have the Opposition wanting the Government to<br />
spend a lot more money at a time when we need to be doing everything<br />
we can to keep Government's spending in check and bring down the<br />
Budget deficit. Mr Anthony said the Labor Party had introduced the R. E. D.<br />
* Scheme when it was in office to try to soak up some of the unemployed,<br />
but had abolished the scheme when its cost got out of hand.<br />
" Now Labor wants us to bring back the kind of scheme it<br />
abolished," he said.<br />
He said Labor suggestions for man power schemes, youth<br />
employment subsidies and apprenticeship and other training programmes<br />
were already being im. plemented by the Government, which had introduced<br />
a series of new initiatives in these areas.<br />
Mr Anthony said that indications of the magnitude of the<br />
problem. inherited by the Government was the fact that when Labor<br />
was clected in 1972 there were 136,769 people unemployed.<br />
. hen Labor icft office in 1975, there were nearly 329.000<br />
ur. er. eloved. This meant there had been an increase in the unemployed rate<br />
from 2.4 percent to 5.4 percent while Labor was in office.<br />
" We now have the task of trying to reverse this rising tide<br />
of unemployment," Mr Anthony said.<br />
" We cannot reverse the trend until we get rid of the continuing<br />
effect of the policies which cause the unemployment.<br />
" In essence, this means bringing inflation under control and<br />
that is the job we are committed to do." </p>
