Commonwealth Heads of Government<br />
Regional Meeting<br />
Sydney<br />
13-16 February 1978 </p>
<p>1. Commonwealth Heads of Government of the Asian and Pacific Region met in Sydney from<br />
13 -16 February 1978. The Heads of Government who attended the Meeting were the Prime Minister<br />
of Australia, the President of Bangladesh, the Prime Minister of Fiji, the Prime minister of India.<br />
the Prime Minister of Malaysia, the President of Nauru, the Prime Minister of New Zealand, the<br />
Prime Minister of Papua New Guinea, the Prime Minister of Singapore, the President of Sri Lanka,<br />
the Prime minister of Tonga and the Prime Minister of Western Samoa. The Australian Prime<br />
Minister, the Rt. Hon. Malcolm Fraser, was in the Chair.<br />
2. Heads of Government welcomed the Australian Government's initiative in proposing the<br />
Meeting which they felt provided a valuable opportunity at the regional level to discuss matters<br />
of common interest, including problems of a global nature, from the varied viewpoints and<br />
perspectives of their several countries. They noted that these countries together contained<br />
nearly one fifth of the world's population and were scattered over a hemisphere of the earth's<br />
surface. With its wide variety of human and natural resources, and its pressing problems of<br />
population and development, the area was in their view of key importance to the world's future.<br />
They believ ed that this importance was too frequently overlooked, and that the region and its<br />
problems and aspirations deserved a greater share of international attention and recognition.<br />
3. They affirmed the importance of regional organisations such as the Association of<br />
Southeast Asian Nations and the South Pacific Forum, each of which, responding to the diverse<br />
conditions of different groups of countries within their respective regions, was making a<br />
significant and growing contribution to regional co-operation. It was their firm belief that<br />
these efforts should receive increasing international support in order to hasten economic and<br />
social development in accordance with the wishes of the peoples concerned.<br />
4I. They regarded their Meeting as complementing these processes of regional co-operation in<br />
a manner which, guided solely by practical considerations, sought to achieve additional benefits<br />
through programmes of further and mutually beneficial co-operation. Conscious of the realities of<br />
global and regional interdependence, and of the need for neighbouring countries in particula:: to<br />
explore every avenue of collaboration, Heads of Government expressed deep satisfaction with he<br />
results achieved at this their first Commonwealth Regional Meeting. They regarded these as having<br />
given an additional dimension to Commonwealth co-operation, thereby reinforcing the Commonwealth<br />
association as a whole. tCU AiD R1] GOaLZL POLITICAL T.-CE<br />
Recalling the full Commonwealth Meeting in London in June 1977, Heads of Government<br />
reaffirmed the consensus achieved there on a wide range of international issues and reviewed the<br />
developnient3 which had taken place since * then. These once again demonstrated the validity of their<br />
profound con~ viction that fundamL-ntal changes were continuing to take place in the traditional<br />
pattern of international relations in a manner that required much greater stress on the practical<br />
politics of interdependence, within the region no less than world-wide. They agreed that the new<br />
approaches which this called for, encompassing political as well as economic elements, which were<br />
inseparably related, must advance the fundamental values of human dignity and equality. A regiOn<br />
as variegatrdi as Asia and the Pacific held a real potential fo r advancing the cause of a wider<br />
harmony by ' 1ostering a policy of muc-ual co-operation in an outward-looking spirit. </p>
<p>Heads of Government noted the dangers* presented by Great: Power rivalry to the peaceful<br />
and harmonious development of the region. They emphasised the importance of seeking the greatest<br />
possible freedom from the tensions caused by such rivalry and of promoting international stability<br />
and co-operation. They acknowledged, however, that the Great Powers had a positive role to play<br />
in supporting the economic and social development of the region.<br />
South Asia<br />
7. Heads of Government welcomed the developments towards an improved climate for friendly<br />
relations in South Asia as holding promise for greater functional and economic co-operation amongst<br />
countries of the area. Southeast Asia<br />
8. In reviewing recent developments in Southeast Asia, Heads of Government were encouraged<br />
by the efforts of the countries in the area to hasten economic and social development within their<br />
own countries and to promote peaceful and mutually beneficial co-operation among them. They,<br />
expressed the hope that the development of friendly relations amongst these countries on tho basis<br />
of respect for sovereignty, territorial integrity and non-interference in internal affairs would<br />
enlarge the areas of understanding and co-operation, thus enhancing the prospects of peace,<br />
freedom and neutrality in the area.<br />
9. They noted with satisfaction the success of ASEAN in broadening and intensifying<br />
co-operation among the member states and between itself and other countries.<br />
Pacific<br />
Heads of Government recalled the significant changes that have taken place in the<br />
political status of many island dountries in the Pacific in recent years. They recognised the<br />
importance of the newly independent island states and welcomed the movement towards independence<br />
of several countries in that area. Expressing satisfaction that these countries were already<br />
successfully engaged in various regional co-operative ventures, they called on the international<br />
community to give greater recognition to the special problems of these countries and to grarnt<br />
special measures, which would give added impetus -to their economic and social development an~ d to<br />
promote further co-operation and progress in the area.<br />
Terrorism<br />
11. Heads of Government deplored the persistence of violence in modern society and condemned<br />
the growing incidence of acts of terrorism world-wide. They recognised that greater international<br />
co-operation was essential to combat this menace. They agreed to explore ways in which their<br />
countries could enlarge collaboration, both regionally and internationally, in combating this evil,<br />
and decided to establish an ad hoc working group to pursue such efforts. </p>
<p>Disarmament<br />
12. Heads of Government discussed the importance of continuing efforts to advance the cause<br />
of disarmament in all its diverse aspects. in welcoming the forthcoming Special1 Session of the<br />
United Nations General Assembly on disarmament as a positive step towards world peace and security,<br />
they expressed their deep appreciation of the initiatives taken by the non-aligned movement aind<br />
other countries to secure the convening of the Special Session. They expressed their sincere hope<br />
that it would lead to concrete action towards the objective of general and complete disarmament<br />
and the application of the resources thus released for assuring a better life for the peoples of<br />
the world. Indian Ocean<br />
13. Heads of Government took note of the talks between the United States and the Soviet Union<br />
on mutual limitations of their military presence in the Indian Ocean and the assurances given by<br />
both countries that they would report on the progress of their talks to the Chairman of the Ad Hoc<br />
Committee of the United Nations. In this connection they expressed the earnest hope that practical<br />
steps would be taken for the implementation of the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of<br />
Peace and other subsequent related Resolutions adopted by the United Nations General Assembly.<br />
They urged all the great powers as well as other major mnaritime users of the Indian Ocean to<br />
co-operate effectively with the littoral and hinterland states and with the Ad Hoc Committee in the<br />
current consultations for convening a conference on the Indian Oceanl. They looked forward to the<br />
forthcoming meeting in New York of all the littoral and hinterland stater, as the next step towards<br />
the eventual convening of a full scale conference on the Indian Ocean.<br />
Southern Africa<br />
,14. Reviewing the situation in Southern Africa, Heads of Government reiterated their concerns<br />
and commitments expressed in London in June 1977. Condemning the racist system of apartheid in<br />
South Africa they once again called upon the international commnunity to take effective measures to<br />
compel South Africa to bring about majority rule. They welcomed the recent talks held in MIalta on<br />
Zimbabwe in the context of the Anglo-American proposals and stressed their belief that any solution<br />
from which the Patriotic Front was excluded would be unacceptable to the international community.<br />
They expr~ szed the hope that the 5-power initiative on Namibia would contribute to speedy progress,<br />
in full co-operation with SWAPO, in effecting a transfer of power based on principles established<br />
u~ nder the relevant United Nations resolutions. Middle East<br />
Heads of Government felt that the situation in the Middle East continued to pose a<br />
serious threat to world peace. They reaffirmed the necessity of urgently moving towards a just<br />
settlement of the problem orn the basis of the relevant resolutions of the United Nations General<br />
Assembly and Security Council and the recognition of the legitimate rights of the Palestinian<br />
people. </p>
<p>INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC ISSUES<br />
16. Heads of Government reviewed the current trends and prospects in the world economy and<br />
the present state of international economic co-operation in the light of the reality that the<br />
majority of the world's absolute poor lived in the region. They noted the close relationship<br />
between adequate economic development sustained over the long term and the maintenance of political<br />
stability. They agreed that, in the context of increasing interdependence, sustained and balanced<br />
economic growth world-wide would benefit all nations and stressed the need for international<br />
action which would promote structural change in the international economic system and enable the<br />
poorest nations to earn a more equitable share of the rising world product.<br />
17. They acknowledged the value of. the assistance which the internationzl community had<br />
provided to the developing countries in the region and called for a sustained increase of those<br />
efforts. Heads of Government emphasised however that hard work, self-reliance and the pursuit of<br />
appropriate policies were the principal means for countries to achieve a satisfactory level of<br />
development and satisfy the basic needs of their populations within an acceptable period of time.<br />
18. in this connection they stressed the urgent need for all countries to adopt effective<br />
domestic policies to achieve sustained economic recovery, to overcome inflation and to secure<br />
price stability, making the most efficient use of their own resources. They recognised,<br />
however, that unsatisfactory arrangements and developments in the international economy could<br />
nullify the effects of the efforts and sacrifice which the countries of the region might make.<br />
North/ South-Dialogue<br />
19. Heads of Goverrnent welcomed the agreement reached at the 32nd Session of the uN General<br />
Assembly to establish a Cozcn-ittee of the Whole to oversee and monitor negotiations on New<br />
International Economic order proposals and other economic matters. They agreed however that progress<br />
made so far in the substantive issues under negotiation was inadequate; they called upon all<br />
nations to promote early international consensus and action on the specific issues under discussion<br />
and to take other steps to ensure that, in a world which has the means and the resources to do it,<br />
the basic needs of all mankind would be satisfied within an acceptable period of time. </p>
<p>Commw~ odities and the Common Fund<br />
Heads of Government agreed that the delay in introducing measures designed to<br />
stabilise commodity prices at remunecrative levels had adverse con'sequences for producing and<br />
consuming nations alike. They noted that the continuing instability in commodity prices generally<br />
and the recent sharp decline in the prices of some comnodities were adversely affecting development<br />
in all producing countries and aggravating the already serious balance of payments and debt<br />
servicing problem of many developing countries. They noted further that the unsatisfactory price<br />
levels were reducing the flow of much needed new investment funds into new commodity production<br />
which had a long lead tine and hence endangering adequate future supplies. They agreed to take<br />
and to promote-action in relevant international forums to secure greater progress in the<br />
negotiations on the implementation of the Resolutions of the Fourth Session of the United Nat~ ions<br />
Conference on Trade and Development and of the Conference on International Economic Co-operation<br />
on the Integrated Programme for Commodities, in which the establishment of a Common Fund is at key<br />
instrument. 21. Heads of Government expressed the hope that the UNCTAD Negotiating Conference on the<br />
Common Fund would reconvene as soon as possible. They undertook to do all they could te facilitate<br />
such an early resumption of the negotiations and indicated their willingness to participate<br />
actively and constructively in then to achieve an early successful ou . tcome.<br />
22. Heads of Government noted with interest the indications of the Government of Australia<br />
of its acce ptance of the need for adequate direct Government subscriptions to a Common Fund, and<br />
for ' other measures' while recognising the need for further examination of the scope of such<br />
activities to be supported by the. Fund.<br />
23. They welcomed the report of the Commonwealth Technical Group on the Commnon Fund as a<br />
constructive contribution to the ongoing dialogue on the subject. They supported the proposal<br />
of the Comronwealth Secretary-General for a meeting of Comronwealth M~ inisters in March to<br />
consider the report with a view to advancing international consensus in the resumed UNCTAD<br />
negotiations on the Fund.<br />
Trade Policy<br />
24. Noting the fundamental importance of freer international trade to economic development,<br />
Heads of Government emphasised the urgent need for a substantial liberalisation of the interniational<br />
. trading systerm within the current multilateral Trade Negotiations. I n this regard,<br />
they stressed the importance of improved access for agricultural products to the major consumer<br />
markets. </p>
<p>Heads of Government expressed their concern over rising protectionism in the industrialised<br />
countries against manufactured goods which countries of the region were wcll equipped to supply.<br />
They were also concerned over the damaging effects of non-tariff and other barriers in trade in<br />
agricultural products which were of major importance to regional countries.<br />
26. They noted that the restrictions in agricultural trade had a doubly adverse effect on<br />
the developing countries in that they reduced the capacity to irport on the part of those<br />
developed countries for whom agricultural exports comprised a high proportion of their export<br />
trade.<br />
27, They urged the key industrialised countries to take the lead In giving effect to the<br />
undertakings which they had repeatedly given in the past to liberalise speedily the conditions<br />
of world trade. In this connection they also referred to the need for the European Economic<br />
Community to devise apprcopriate solutions, as envisaged in the Joint Declaration of Intent, to<br />
the problems of the trade of the Asian developing countries which had arisen as a result of the<br />
enlargement of the EEC.<br />
Industrial Developrrent<br />
28. Heads of Government agreed that accelerated industrialisation of the developing<br />
countries in the region would not only sustain development in these countries but also enlarge<br />
the markets for capital and skill intensive manufactures and services which tile industrialised<br />
countries have the capability to supply. They also noted the crucial role of appropriate<br />
technology in the economic development of the developing countries.<br />
29. They urged the industrialised countries to adopt policies to improve access for<br />
manufactures from the developing countries as rapidly as possible and to facilitate the mutually<br />
beneficial process of increasing the share of the developing countries in a rising world<br />
Industrial production.<br />
They noted that the Commonwealth Team of Industrial Specialists was examining specific<br />
programmes of action to assist developing countries to industrialise, including proposals for<br />
the establish-ment. of a Commonwealth Fund for Industrial Co-operation and Development and a<br />
Centre for Development and Diffusion of Appropriate Technology. They expressed the hope that<br />
the report would be presented at an early date and would identify specific measures for<br />
facilitating industrial development in the developing countries. Noting that the Team's report<br />
would be considered by all Commonwealth members, they agreed to consult thereafter, at an<br />
appropriate time, on ways in which the Comm-onwealth countries of the region might give effect<br />
to any decisions agreed by m~ inisters. </p>
<p>External Debt<br />
31. Heads of Government reaffirmed the importance of enlarging external capital flows on<br />
appropriate termns to the developing countries in order to help them to increase their rate of<br />
economic and social development. In this connection, they reviewed the problems which some<br />
developing countries now experien~ ce in servicing their existing debt obligations. They<br />
recognised that while some developing countries had the capacity to service a higher level of<br />
borrowing, for others, renegotiations of existing debt obligations are now or shortly may be<br />
necessary. They noted that certain donor countries had waived the official debt service<br />
obligation of the least developed countries. They stressed the importance of early<br />
agreement on the appropriate machinery to examine the debt problems of the developing countries.<br />
Official Development Assistance<br />
32. Developed countries at the meeting reaffirmed their commitment to increase their ODA<br />
with a view to reaching the 0.7% target. Recalling that the commitmsent to increase their ODA<br />
towards the target and improve the quality of their assistance was also entered into by other<br />
developed Commonwealth countries, and noting that the developed countries in the region provided<br />
virtually all their ODA on grant terms, Heads of Government renewed the call for other donor<br />
countries to make a parallel effort to improve the volume and quality of-their ODA in accordance<br />
with the UN target; they also stressed the need to enlarge multilateral mechanisms which would<br />
enable developing countries to expand their assistance to each other.<br />
33. In this' connection, Heads of Governm~ ent noted that the economic situation in the<br />
least developed and ' most seriously affected' countries had shown little improvement in recent<br />
years and that in some cases it had worsened. They urged donor countries and international<br />
agencies to commit themselves to a continuing enlargement and a softening of the terms of the<br />
assistance they provide to these countries. </p>
<p>11inan Penourco Development<br />
37. Heoads of Governmecnt attached the highest importance to the development of the human<br />
resources of the countries in the region. They noted the contributions which the developed<br />
and some developing countries were already making in the form of technical assistance and<br />
training facilities for students from the developing countries in the region; they expressed<br />
the hope that this contribution would be continued and enlarged.<br />
Food Produ. ction and RuralDevelopment<br />
38. Heads of Government recognised the crucial role of increased food production and rural<br />
development in the economic development of developing countries. ' While the food supply positicn<br />
had irproved appreciably during the last few years, it wap still inadequate to meet<br />
consumption requirements. They recognised the urgency of expanding food production and also.<br />
recommended that measures be devised to improve marketing, employment and inccmes, as well ais<br />
for the provision of food aid and other basic human needs through rural development. They<br />
agreed that food surplu. s countries together with other donor countries should make special<br />
efforts to ensure world food security. They urged that the Commcnwealth Advisory Group should<br />
report at an early date on concrete measures and practical programmes towards meeting these<br />
objectives. Illicit Drug Trafficking<br />
39. Heads of Government recognised that the illicit drug traffic was a growing problem for<br />
several countries Of the region. They welcomed efforts to suppress the traffic and expressed<br />
the view that these efforts needed to be intensified. They confirmed their willingness to<br />
co-operate with each other on these matters recognisin~ g that the work of international ag~ encies<br />
formed the basis for such regional co-operation. In this context, they agreed that interested<br />
countries should b, invited to participate in a working group of officials to examine the<br />
possibilities for further regional co-operation.<br />
Commonwealth Fund for Technical Co-operation<br />
Heads of Government recognised the important contribution being made by the Comrmonwealth<br />
Fund for Technical Co-operation as a quick and flexible instrument to supplement the bilateral<br />
and other multilateral prograrmmes of technical assistance to developing countries in the region.<br />
N~ oting with a-ppreciation that the region accounted for one third of the Fund's commitments to<br />
all Commonwealth developing countries, they emphasised the importance of ensuring that the Fund<br />
played an affective role in meetin~ g the expanding needs of Commonwealth Governments, so enabling<br />
it to continue to demonstrate in a practical way the ideals of co-operation and mutual assistance,<br />
and to strengthen the -multilateral links among Commohwealth countries and peoples. </p>
<p>SPECIAI. PROnLFmS CF SIMALI, STATFS<br />
41. Heads of Government recognised that special measures and relationships were necessary<br />
to assist small States to realise their development potential. In this connection they welcomed<br />
the establishment of the Pacific Forum Line as an important vehicle for promoting the export:<br />
trade and development of the Pacific Island States. They were also mindful of the important<br />
developmental role played by regional island air carriers thirouh the Pacific and the need to<br />
sustain these cervices economically. The developed and the irdustrially advanced developing<br />
countries agreed to examine ways of meeting the needs of the islands for growing flows of<br />
concessionary finance to improve and operate their infrastructure and develop technical and<br />
professional skills, for technical assistance to enable them to ierive maximum advantage from<br />
their Exclusive Yconomic Zones, and for favourable conditions of access to the markets of the<br />
larger countries for their agricultural and manufactured products.<br />
42. Heads of Government also recognised that the range and complexity of international<br />
issues under negotiation were placing very heavy burdens on the financial and manpower resources<br />
of the small states in the Commonwealth. They acknowledged a collective responsibility to<br />
render special assistance to these countries to enable them to prsue their vital national<br />
interests. Noting that the need for such assistance will grow with the achievement of<br />
independence by a number of very small Commonwealth countries in the years immediately ahead,<br />
Heads of Government felt that systematic programmes of assistance for these countries should be<br />
cstEblished as a matter of priority. Such programmes should be particularly concerned with<br />
the problems of providing the assistance required for international representation and for<br />
support in financial, trade and other negotiations related to the promotion of their<br />
development, and with the wider question of how the Comionwealth collectively might better<br />
serve the needs of its smallest member states. Recognising that many such states were in<br />
other regions of the Commonwealth, they invited the Secretary-General to examine the most<br />
appropriate ways in which such assistance might be rendered on a Comrjonwealth wide basis and<br />
urged him to seek general Commonwealth support for such programmes. They noted the opportunity<br />
which the meeting of Commonwealth Senior Officials later this year would provide in this regard. </p>
<p>Follow up act ion<br />
43. neadu of Government were uatisfied that their Sydney meeting fulfilled the highest<br />
expectations of the discussion on regionalism at the CommonweaILh Heads of Government mecting in<br />
London last June. The-y agrcd that it served to further confirm and strengthen their faith in the..<br />
value of the Cormonwealth generally. They invited their Chairman to convey these sentiments to all<br />
other Heads of Government.<br />
44. With a view to ensuring effective follow-up action on their decisions, Heads of Government<br />
further agreed that:<br />
, The following regional Governments will act as the co-ordinators in respect<br />
of particular decisions involving follow-up action:<br />
Consultative Group on Trade ( paragraph 34) AUSTRALIA<br />
( ii) Consultative Group on Energy ( paragraph 36) INDIA<br />
( iii) Working Group on Terrorism ( paragraph 11) SINGAPORE<br />
( iv) Working Group on Illicit Drugs ( paragraph 39) MALAYSIA<br />
The Secretary-General be requested to:<br />
i) develop and put forward to the Commonwealth Senior Officials Meeting<br />
in Malaysia later this year proposals on special Commonwealth<br />
programmes to assist small states; and<br />
( ii) provide liaison facilities in relation to all follow-up action through<br />
the<br />
a consultant provided by the Secretariat and based in/ South Pacific<br />
Bureau for Economic Co-operation whose duties will include the<br />
co-ordination of all follow-up action, the provision of Secretariat<br />
resources for it as required, and keeping all regional Governments in<br />
touch with developments. The Government of Australia has offered<br />
initial financial support for the Secretariat's follow-up work.<br />
They would meet again at Delhi in 1980 to renew their conversations and to review<br />
progress on the implementation of their decisions at Sydney.<br />
APPRECIATION TO F! OST GOVE. N.! FN,<br />
Heads of Government expressed their warm appreciation of the excellent arrangements<br />
rade for the meeting by the Australian Government. They algo thanked the Australian Go'ernwert<br />
for its unstinted hospitality. </p>
