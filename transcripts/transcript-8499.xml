REMARKS BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING, MP<br />
BATTLE OF THE CORAL SEA COMMIEMORATION, TOWN HALL, SYDNEY,<br />
2 MAY 1992<br />
This week we celebrate the Battle of the Coral Sea the<br />
first battle of the Pacific War in which the enem~ y suffered<br />
a strategic setback, the first to check the tide of his<br />
advance, the first to give us respite.<br />
Because it restrained Japanese military expansion in our<br />
region, and helped make possible further victories in Papua<br />
New Guinea, the Solomon Islands and at Midway, the Battle of<br />
the Coral Sea was a turning point in the War and in our<br />
history. Because it saw Americans and Australians joined in common<br />
purpose, defending not only Australia and the region but the<br />
ideals we share, it was a turning point in our relationship.<br />
The Battle of the Coral Sea was the first test of our<br />
alliance. The bravery and sacrifice of our sailors and<br />
airmen gave it the strength to last.<br />
Fifty years later that bond endures, the friendship is as<br />
strong as ever.<br />
We owe a great deal to the American, Australian and allied<br />
servicemen who fought in the Battle Of the Coral Sea.<br />
In particular we owe much to the United States, then and<br />
still, the greatest liberal democracy in the world.<br />
The might of the US Navy and the courage of American and<br />
Australian fighting men won the day. Australians have never<br />
forgotten, never ceased to express their gratitude.<br />
But in this coming week it should not be so much the might<br />
of arms we celebrate, as the might of an idea.<br />
I mean the idea of freedom. The idea of democracy.<br />
That, I think, is what the Battle of the Coral Sea should<br />
mean to us now. </p>

if we are properly to honour those who fought and died, we*<br />
must stay true to those liberal democratic principles which<br />
they defended, true to the ideals of justice and fairness,<br />
true to their faith in what they had built at home and what<br />
they aspired to build for their children.<br />
True to the humane principles at the root of our<br />
democracies. In welcoming you back to our country, Secretary Cheney, you<br />
may be sure that we Australians have rnot forgotten either<br />
the debt we owe, or the principles which were so bravely<br />
defended. You and Dr Cheney, all those Americans on board the ships of<br />
the US fleet, and all those who are visiting Australia to<br />
join in these great celebrations, may be assured of a very<br />
warm welcome.<br />
We have looked forward to your coming. We look forward to<br />
your stay, and trust that it will be a very happy one.<br />
Thank you </p>
