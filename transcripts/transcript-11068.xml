<p> WARNECKE: </p>
<p> Mr Howard good morning. </p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER: </p>
<p> Good morning Rob. </p>
<p> WARNECKE: </p>
<p> Mr Howard, more serious matters, I understand next week you hope</p>
<p>   that the GST legislation will finally pass the Senate with support</p>
<p>   of most, not all Democrats. But I would suggest to you that there</p>
<p>   is more disquiet now then there was a couple of months ago about</p>
<p>   the GST coming in on July 1 next year. Disquiet about savings being</p>
<p>   passed on to consumers. Are you satisfied that there's sufficient</p>
<p>   rules in place to stop profiteering? </p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER: </p>
<p> Well I'm satisfied that there will be rules in place. A number</p>
<p>   of those rules have yet to be established but they will be. We will</p>
<p>   have a year in which to prepare the community for the introduction</p>
<p>   of the new system. I am more than satisfied that by the time it</p>
<p>   comes in there will be such a focus on how the new system operates</p>
<p>   and such a focus on the obligations of traders to pass on price</p>
<p>   reductions and there will be many items that will be cheaper because</p>
<p>   there will no longer be wholesale sales tax of up to 22, 32% on</p>
<p>   those items. I'm satisfied that there will be plenty of mechanisms,</p>
<p>   but also the pressure of an inquiry of well informed well educated</p>
<p>   public. For example I anticipate that in the week leading up to</p>
<p>   this, the introduction, the newspapers will carry a list of the</p>
<p>   before and after GST prices of household items. Television stations</p>
<p>   will run programmes of people scanning a supermarket shelf and being</p>
<p>   told well this item costs X now, after the GST it should cost no</p>
<p>   more than Y. And pity help the trader whose price is higher than</p>
<p>   what it ought to be. So don't imagine that the introduction</p>
<p>   of this won't be accompanied by an enormous amount of activity</p>
<p>   and an enormous amount of focus. </p>
<p> WARNECKE: </p>
<p> Because I think Prime Minister a lot of people are already suggesting</p>
<p>   the prices are being inflated now in anticipation of July 1 next</p>
<p>   year. We are getting a lot of complaints here from people saying</p>
<p>   for example, I got a letter yesterday from a woman who pointed out</p>
<p>   that food products had been downsized in the contents but the price</p>
<p>   has not gone down. And she's very sceptical about what's</p>
<p>   going to happen next July. </p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER: </p>
<p> Well I've heard people make those complaints before and long</p>
<p>   before there was any discussion about a goods and services tax.</p>
<p>   I would suggest that people who do have those complaints they take</p>
<p>   them up with the State prices and consumer affairs lobby whichever</p>
<p>   is the relevant agency in Victoria who investigate things of that</p>
<p>   nature. But there's nothing novel about people making claims</p>
<p>   about character and I know that the critics of the GST are going</p>
<p>   to try and blame it for every single and every imaginable transgression</p>
<p>   that they might find in the marketplace. But I can only repeat that</p>
<p>   there will not only be mechanisms but there will also be the huge</p>
<p>   pressure and the huge scrutiny and enormous publicity and education</p>
<p>   campaign to acquaint people with how the new system operates. We</p>
<p>   remind traders of their obligations to pass on reductions and also</p>
<p>   of course to acquaint people of the ways and means of ensuring that</p>
<p>   those reductions have been passed on. </p>
<p> WARNECKE: </p>
<p> Well the chairman of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission,</p>
<p>   Professor Alan Fells made a couple of interesting suggestions this</p>
<p>   week. One was that while he will have the task of keeping an eye</p>
<p>   on prices, and I think you've given him $27 million extra for</p>
<p>   next year to do that. He thinks he might need more, and the further</p>
<p>   question is would the government be prepared to consider giving</p>
<p>   him more? The other question though, perhaps a little more down</p>
<p>   to Earth, he's suggesting that price tags should carry the</p>
<p>   previous product....previous price for the product, the GST component</p>
<p>   and the new price. Do you support that and would you give them more</p>
<p>   money? </p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER: </p>
<p> Well we will ensure that they've got adequate resources.</p>
<p>   That's a matter for discussion between the Treasurer and the</p>
<p>   chairman. But I can assure your listeners that the ACCC will have</p>
<p>   adequate resources to do its job. The question of what amounts to</p>
<p>   adequate resources is something that needs to be discussed between</p>
<p>   him and the Treasurer. But the commitment to provide adequate resources</p>
<p>   is clearly there. The other suggestion, well it is not our intention</p>
<p>   nor is it part of the law to have other than a requirement on traders</p>
<p>   to have a GST inclusive price. In other words we're not going</p>
<p>   to adopt the American system of saying this is $20 plus tax. We're</p>
<p>   going to adopt the European system of it's $20 including the</p>
<p>   GST which is not separately identified. Now that's the legal</p>
<p>   requirement. As to what individual traders might do, well that is</p>
<p>   something that can vary but it's not our intention to change</p>
<p>   our law to require what he's suggesting. </p>
<p> WARNECKE: </p>
<p> Yes, he seems to think that particularly in the first month of</p>
<p>   the GST it might help to.... </p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER: </p>
<p> Well it may well be that some people will elect to do that and</p>
<p>   that is something that no doubt different firms will take a different</p>
<p>   approach to it. But it's not our intention to require other</p>
<p>   than a GST inclusive price. And there are many good and proper commercial</p>
<p>   reasons, particularly for smaller operators why that should be so.</p>
<p> WARNECKE: </p>
<p> You will recall as we all do with some mirth that when the GST</p>
<p>   was first mooted by your predecessor John Hewson that the debate</p>
<p>   seemed to get stuck on the question of birthday cakes and the component</p>
<p>   of birthday cakes. This time it seems to be the chook. Now there</p>
<p>   still seems to be some dispute about whether cooked chooks, whole</p>
<p>   cooked chooks should be covered by a GST. I understand from this</p>
<p>   morning's papers that the government wants whole cooked chooks</p>
<p>   GST'd. </p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER: </p>
<p> Well Ross, there are discussions taking place between the government</p>
<p>   and the Australian Democrats about the fine detail of the changes</p>
<p>   we agreed and those discussions are still underway and I'm</p>
<p>   not going to canvass those discussions publicly. They're being</p>
<p>   conducted in a very cooperative way. There's a lot of good</p>
<p>   will. The position agreed with the Democrats which we will honour</p>
<p>   in full is that basic food is going to be exempt so we're trying</p>
<p>   to give a proper legislative expression for that in a way which</p>
<p>   is as simple as possible, recognising when you tax some food and</p>
<p>   don't tax other food then there's bound to be some discussion</p>
<p>   at the margin. But I'm not going to get into the detail of</p>
<p>   it. The issue's under discussion right at the moment and it</p>
<p>   doesn't help me to be giving a running public commentary on</p>
<p>   it. </p>
<p> WARNECKE: </p>
<p> All right. Well offsetting the GST of course is tax cuts. </p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER: </p>
<p> Very significant personal tax cuts. </p>
<p> WARNECKE: </p>
<p> Well I noticed in this morning's Australian they flagged</p>
<p>   an item that they'll be running tomorrow in The Weekend</p>
<p>   Australian where they've had two, they call them the nation's</p>
<p>   top tax researchers, Professors Ann Harding and Neil Warren, have</p>
<p>   analysed the GST package and the tax package. They apparently came</p>
<p>   to the conclusion that no matter what you and the Democrats agreed</p>
<p>   to, still pensioners are going to be worse off. They will lose most</p>
<p>   under this system. </p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER: </p>
<p> Well I didn't quite read the article. I dug through that</p>
<p>   article and let me say that I haven't read the analysis by</p>
<p>   Ann Harding and Neil Warren so. </p>
<p> WARNECKE: </p>
<p> Well let me tell you, basically it's just pensioners....</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER: </p>
<p> I know the article, I've read the article in The Australian,</p>
<p>   but that article is a trailer of the analysis. What I'm</p>
<p>   saying is I haven't read the analysis and until I've read</p>
<p>   it and you've read it's a bit difficult to answer questions</p>
<p>   about it. </p>
<p> WARNECKE: </p>
<p> Does it surprise you? </p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER: </p>
<p> What? </p>
<p> WARNECKE: </p>
<p> That they find that the pensioners are in fact worse off and that</p>
<p>   the rich [inaudible].... </p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER: </p>
<p> What do you mean by.....are you saying that they are inferring</p>
<p>   that pensioners are made worse off? </p>
<p> WARNECKE: </p>
<p> Yes. They are saying pensioner couples... </p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER: </p>
<p> I don't think they're saying that. I think what they're</p>
<p>   saying is that the greater gains under the.....well what the</p>
<p>   article says [inaudible] Harding and Neil Warren are saying until</p>
<p>   I've seen their article. But I understand that article to say</p>
<p>   that a group other than pensioners will gain most out of the package,</p>
<p>   doesn't mean to say the package makes the pensioners worse</p>
<p>   off. </p>
<p> WARNECKE: </p>
<p> Well they will gain least. Let's turn it around and say the</p>
<p>   pensioners will gain least. </p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER: </p>
<p> Well I would like to see the analysis. You better remember with</p>
<p>   all of these things that it is inevitable that you have a tax cut</p>
<p>   that people earning more money will in dollar terms get a larger</p>
<p>   cut because they're paying more tax. That is an inevitable</p>
<p>   night follows day consequence of any reduction in tax. If your tax</p>
<p>   bill is $200 a week and you get a tax cut you obviously get more</p>
<p>   dollars out of that cut than somebody whose tax bill is $100 a week.</p>
<p>   But it doesn't necessarily make it unfair because the first</p>
<p>   bloke is paying more tax in the first instance. So of course in</p>
<p>   dollar terms if the cut is even right down the rate scales then</p>
<p>   he's entitled to get a bigger reduction. </p>
<p> WARNECKE: </p>
<p> Well let's wait until that article comes out tomorrow and</p>
<p>   then we can analyse for [inaudible] next week. Another matter regarding</p>
<p>   the GST, you're quite clear that the automobile manufacturing</p>
<p>   industry in this country is a little worried that with prices likely</p>
<p>   to fall from July 1 and quite substantially from July 1 next year</p>
<p>   that there may well be a buyers strike over the next 12 months.</p>
<p>   People just saying look I'll put off buying a new car until</p>
<p>   next year. And people like Ford and Toyota are talking about closing</p>
<p>   down their plants for a week or two. You would have to be concerned</p>
<p>   about that surely. </p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER: </p>
<p> Well can I just say that there is probably no section of Australian</p>
<p>   manufacturing that will gain more from the GST than car manufacturers.</p>
<p> WARNECKE: </p>
<p> That's next year. What about this year? </p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER: </p>
<p> But hang on. I mean how sort of narrow focused can you get? </p>
<p> WARNECKE: </p>
<p> Well this is..... </p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER: </p>
<p> Hang on. I have regular discussions with the car manufacturers</p>
<p>   and sure they are interested in even sales and acquisitions and</p>
<p>   such. They do take a long view and they should take a long view</p>
<p>   and the long view tells them that Australian cars....Australian</p>
<p>   manufactured cars will fall significantly in price. They over the</p>
<p>   last couple of years have endured a very strong market and very</p>
<p>   strong sales. We are monitoring on a monthly basis the buying patterns</p>
<p>   in relation to Australian cars in anticipation of the introduction</p>
<p>   of the new system and we have an understanding of the industry regarding</p>
<p>   that. We're swapping information almost on a daily basis. But</p>
<p>   I don't think it is reasonable for people to conclude other</p>
<p>   than this is a hugely beneficial deal. You've got wholesale</p>
<p>   sales tax at 22% on motor vehicles. That's going to dramatically</p>
<p>   fall, the price of Australian made cars will fall. On top of that</p>
<p>   there will be effectively a 7 cent-a-litre cut in the cost of fuel</p>
<p>   used for business purposes which will feed through in an indirect</p>
<p>   fashion to the motor vehicle manufacturing industry. They are amongst</p>
<p>   the greatest winners, the greatest winners and their employees the</p>
<p>   greatest winners out of this exercise. </p>
<p> WARNECKE: </p>
<p> It does strike me Prime Minister that their suggestion about phasing</p>
<p>   out sales tax and phasing in GST on cars over the next 12 months</p>
<p>   instead of having a sudden jump on July 1 next year is probably</p>
<p>   impractical. </p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER: </p>
<p> Well I think the arrangements that we have proposed are the right</p>
<p>   ones. I'm not getting into a public debate with the motor carriers</p>
<p>   and I don't think it wants to with me because I tell you what</p>
<p>   they are as enthusiastic as all hell about this new system. </p>
<p> WARNECKE: </p>
<p> And just pretending not to be? </p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER: </p>
<p> Well no, I'm not accusing them of bad faith. But they put</p>
<p>   a point of view and they feel the need to argue every point and</p>
<p>   I understand that. But your listeners should understand that if</p>
<p>   the price of an item includes 22% wholesale sales tax and you're</p>
<p>   going to have a GST at a rate of 10% you can see that there's</p>
<p>   going to be a huge cut in the price of that product. And you know</p>
<p>   you could argue until you're blue in the face about this and</p>
<p>   that impact on acquisitions sales and so forth. At the end of the</p>
<p>   day that's a huge benefit for the company that makes those</p>
<p>   cars, it's a huge benefit for the workers, in an industry incidentally</p>
<p>   that has seen record sales of cars. </p>
<p> WARNECKE: </p>
<p> Yeah. I suppose they probably look at the possible reductions</p>
<p>   in sales tax on some items as early as next month or the month after</p>
<p>   with sales tax dropping from 32% to 22% on things like TVs and watches</p>
<p>   and cameras, as an example of what could be done. But those items</p>
<p>   will come down well before July 1 next year. I mean they're</p>
<p>   looking at that perhaps as an example of what could be done. </p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER: </p>
<p> I mean what I'm saying is you should have a sense of proportion.</p>
<p>   They are huge winners out of this new system. I've got the</p>
<p>   responsibility of balancing every consideration and not just looking</p>
<p>   at a narrow sectional interest and answering and meeting every request</p>
<p>   that that [inaudible]. It's quite impossible to do that. It's</p>
<p>   unreasonable that some industry spokesmen expect governments to</p>
<p>   do that particularly when the benefits for that industry in the</p>
<p>   medium to longer term are so massive. </p>
<p> WARNECKE: </p>
<p> Can we move across to the question of the Kosovo refugees in Australia?</p>
<p>   Are you embarrassed as Prime Minister by what happened this week</p>
<p>   with some of them refusing to go into the Singleton army barracks?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER: </p>
<p> No I'm not embarrassed. I would imagine a number of their</p>
<p>   fellow countrymen would be embarrassed. I would imagine that the</p>
<p>   great bulk of the refugees who are immensely grateful for the safe</p>
<p>   haven that Australia's provided would be extremely embarrassed</p>
<p>   about the behaviour of a small number. </p>
<p> WARNECKE: </p>
<p> Because it really was when we pointed it all out a very small</p>
<p>   number that was causing trouble. </p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER: </p>
<p> Absolutely. And I think they would be a huge embarrassment to</p>
<p>   their fellow countrymen. But the situation Ross is that these people</p>
<p>   are free to move around our country. We made a decision when we</p>
<p>   said we would take them that we were not going to keep them in detention,</p>
<p>   that they were not going to be kept as if in an armed camp. We said</p>
<p>   to them: look we'll give you temporary safe haven. We'll</p>
<p>   provide you, at our cost, with accommodation of our nomination.</p>
<p>   And they don't have a right to pick and choose what accommodation</p>
<p>   we will provide to them and pay for. What they do have is an entitlement</p>
<p>   to stay at our expense in accommodation that we have nominated,</p>
<p>   and that includes in the case of this family that's being difficult</p>
<p>   at the Singleton army barracks. Now it might be in the eyes of some</p>
<p>   a little basic and rudimentary but we've got to keep [inaudible]</p>
<p>   where they came from. And they have a right to move around but they</p>
<p>   don't have the right to say to us: well look we don't</p>
<p>   like that accommodation which the government is providing. We require</p>
<p>   the government to provide us with some other accommodation for which</p>
<p>   we expect the government pay. Now we're not prepared to accept</p>
<p>   that. But of course if people choose to move around we're not</p>
<p>   going to try and keep them in detention. We're not in the business</p>
<p>   of arresting people. But we are in the business of saying to people</p>
<p>   that the conditions under which you came to this country are that</p>
<p>   you come on a temporary basis. We'll provide you with accommodation</p>
<p>   that we deem to be suitable and appropriate and that will be at</p>
<p>   our expense. If you want to go out of that accommodation then you're</p>
<p>   on your own and you're at your own expense. But you don't</p>
<p>   have a right to say to us well we don't like the accommodation</p>
<p>   you've given us, we want you to give us some other accommodation.</p>
<p>   I mean we can't accept that. If one family can do that then</p>
<p>   a lot of other families will say that we'll move as well and</p>
<p>   the whole system breaks down. </p>
<p> WARNECKE: </p>
<p> Are you concerned at all about Peter Costello and Jeff Kennett</p>
<p>   going toe to toe over the Brighton preselection down here in Victoria</p>
<p>   and some of the language that's being used? </p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER: </p>
<p> Well that sounds to me very much like a pretty colourful description</p>
<p>   of a preselection. I've been in this game long enough to stay</p>
<p>   out of discussion about preselections. It's a State preselection.</p>
<p>   It's got nothing to do with me. I'm not particularly interested</p>
<p>   in it. I wish the candidates well. But I don't really need</p>
<p>   to make a comment on that. </p>
<p> WARNECKE: </p>
<p> All right. The Chinese woman who was deported back to China where</p>
<p>   she allegedly had an....well we know she had an abortion, a forced</p>
<p>   abortion. She's reportedly applying for a visa. The immigration</p>
<p>   minister Phil Ruddock apparently has said she's unlikely to</p>
<p>   get it which seems to be prejudging the matter a bit. Do you think</p>
<p>   we should consider a visa for her? </p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER: </p>
<p> Well I think people who make applications for visas are entitled</p>
<p>   to have those applications considered in the normal way and I'm</p>
<p>   not going to say if she is or is not entitled to a visa. Obviously</p>
<p>   the minister who handles these matters with very great skill and</p>
<p>   care is in the position to know a little more about the detailed</p>
<p>   procedures than I because he's the minister. And I don't</p>
<p>   think anything he's said on this case has been in anyway inappropriate</p>
<p>   but.... </p>
<p> WARNECKE: </p>
<p> [inaudible] Brian Harradine seems a bit upset about it. </p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER: </p>
<p> Well I understand Senator Harradine's concerns and I've</p>
<p>   had quite a number of conversations with Senator Harradine about</p>
<p>   this and there are aspects of the lady's return to China that</p>
<p>   bothered me and that's why we've ordered an inquiry into</p>
<p>   the procedures that were adopted by the immigration department.</p>
<p>   Now I don't want to prejudge the outcome but the latest I have</p>
<p>   is that.....information I have is that the lady has returned</p>
<p>   to her hometown in China, that there were a number of assurances</p>
<p>   about her safety, about her position which were given by the Chinese</p>
<p>   government. I understand that a representative of the refugee council,</p>
<p>   Marion Le I think her name is who's been very active and very</p>
<p>   interested in this case and has spoken to the media a great deal</p>
<p>   about it, has expressed general satisfaction with the arrangements</p>
<p>   that were made which I find encouraging. We'll continue to</p>
<p>   follow her case, we're interested in it. On the other hand</p>
<p>   we respect the fact that she is a citizen of China and it must of</p>
<p>   course be remembered that she originally entered Australia illegally</p>
<p>   and it's very important that Australia be able to have a cooperative</p>
<p>   relationship with the Chinese government regarding the return of</p>
<p>   people who come to this country illegally. </p>
<p> WARNECKE: </p>
<p> All right Prime Minister, thank you for your time and let's</p>
<p>   hope we win on Sunday night. </p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER: </p>
<p> I sure do. </p>
<p> WARNECKE: </p>
<p> All right, thanks for your time. </p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER: </p>
<p> Thank you. </p>
