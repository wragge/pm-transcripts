FOR MEDIA 5 APRIL 1979<br />
DECLARATION OF KAKADU NATIONAL PARK<br />
The Governor-General in Council has approved the proclamation<br />
of the Kakadu National Park in the Northern Territory.<br />
This action puts into effect one of the most important<br />
elements of the Government's protective policy for the<br />
Alligator Rivers Region in the light of its decision in<br />
1977 to permit the development of uranium mining.<br />
The Government accepted recommendations of the Ranger<br />
Uranium Environmental Inquiry to grant Aboriginal land rights<br />
and establish a national park over the same area.<br />
On 25 August 1977, in announcing the Government.' s decision,,<br />
I said: " The Government has decided to accept the recommendation<br />
of the Ranger Inquiry that a major national park should be<br />
established in the Region to protect and preserve the natural<br />
features, the flora and fauna, the Aboriginal sacred sites<br />
and cave paintings".<br />
The first stage of the park to be declared will be of over<br />
6,000 sq. km.<br />
I am informed that a combination of cultural richness,,<br />
scientific interest and mangificent scenery will place Kakadu<br />
high among the great national parks of the world. Its<br />
scenery compares favourably with that in the famous national<br />
parks of Canada and the U. S. A.<br />
Kakadu will represent a unique conjunction of conservation and<br />
Aboriginal interest. The Aboriginal owners have in effect made<br />
a gift of their land to the Australian people to be managed<br />
by the Commonwealth as a national park.<br />
By agreement the Aboriginal owners and Northern Territory<br />
authorities will have an important role in the management.<br />
I would expect that the widespread interest already being<br />
displayed in the proposed park will result in more tourists,<br />
including foreign tourists, visiting the area.<br />
In order to adequately protect the features of the park, to<br />
provide in a meaningful way for Aboriginal participation in<br />
management and the decision-making process, and to cater for<br />
the projected increase in tourist interest, the Government<br />
is committed to a development program. Definition of the<br />
first five years of the program is already well advanced.<br />
