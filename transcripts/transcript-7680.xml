TRANSCRIPT OF NEWS CONFERENCE, GEORGE GEAR'S ELECTORATE<br />
OFFICE, PERTH 14 JULY 1989<br />
E 02 PROOF ONLY<br />
JOURNALIST: Is your Job made more difficult at the moment<br />
with a senior Minister uayjflg that the Labor Party hasn't<br />
got more than a 50/ 50 chance of getting back in?<br />
PM: No, not at all. Next question.<br />
JOURNALIST: ( inaudible)<br />
PM: I've expressed It. Haven't you caught up with today's<br />
news. r have expressed my disagreement, yes. We're<br />
going to win. And if you can get onto even money it's<br />
the best even money bet in Australia.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Button also says that<br />
PH: Senator Button.<br />
JOURNALIST: that you have a big ego. Do you have a<br />
big ego?<br />
PH: He didn't say that at all. Show me the transcript.<br />
I've read the transcript, have you?<br />
JOURNALIST; He says you've got a big ego.<br />
PM: Get me the transcript. C'mton, show the lady. Get<br />
me the transcript. Now, don't manufacture things. Do<br />
you want to see it? Just have a look at it. There you<br />
are. Next question.<br />
J'OURNALIST: feeling in the Party that something should<br />
be done about interest rates early. Obviously that warn<br />
not part of yotw agenda. Do you think that there's a<br />
nd to change the plan?<br />
PH: I've made it quite clear that it's open for people<br />
to make their suggestions. That's the sort of democratic<br />
country we have, the democratic party we've got. Now<br />
we'll1 be starting on Monday in the detai 1 ad processes<br />
of Budget formulation. We'll make the decisions am we<br />
have over-the last six years in the best interests of<br />
this country. Policies which have vroduced one and a<br />
half million new jobs, which have brought inflation down<br />
fro eleven per cent to seven per cent, which have produced </p>
<p>universal medical coverage for Australians. which have<br />
seen levels of social welfare payments, targetted welfare<br />
payments the like of which have never been seon before.<br />
We've created a more efficient and more Just society.<br />
We'll continue to make the decisions that will keep that<br />
going. JOURNALIST: Have your backbenchers lost their nerve?<br />
PM': It may be said that some of then are getting a little<br />
nervous. Look at this bloke ( George Gear), he hasn't.<br />
never has.<br />
JOURNALIST: In the business Review Weekly Mr K~ eating<br />
said that he has not been getting the recognition he deserves<br />
and that if he was in another country he might get a medal<br />
or some sort for what he's done for the economy. Do you<br />
think that's a very good thing to say<br />
PM': I think he might have had his tongue in his cheek<br />
when he said it.<br />
JOURNALIST: l On Bastille Day do you have a message for<br />
the Frenoh?<br />
PM: Yes. The French are our good friends now and we<br />
have had recently the opportunity of talking together.<br />
I've met with President Mitterand, Prime Minister Rocard.<br />
and Foreign Minister Dumas and we are on the same wavelength.<br />
I say to them now on Bastille Day, congratulations on<br />
what they have given to the world. our history of<br />
Australia au the country in the period of European settlement<br />
is almost identical in time with the period of the French<br />
Revolution. Much of the concepts that were developed<br />
in that period, concepts of equality, liberty, fraternity,<br />
are principles which have been important in the development<br />
of Australia as a great democracy. They wera very, very<br />
generous the French in 1988 In participating in the Australian<br />
Bicentennary. Very, very generous indeed. We have made<br />
some contributions to their year. I wish them well.<br />
ends, </p>
