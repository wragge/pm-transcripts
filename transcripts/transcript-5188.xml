affected by the shut down, the flow had been stopped to all<br />
vessels. There has been no official explanation from Iran or<br />
any indication how long the stoppage would last. Oil industry<br />

The head of the Australian Federal Police, Sir Colin Woods,<br />
does not want to talk about the new responsibilities he has<br />
been given to combat drugs just yet. In response to requests<br />
from newsmen for interviews this morning Sir Colin issued<br />
a short statement saying that the disbanding of the<br />
Federal Narcotics Bureau meant that the Federal Police Force<br />
had been given a job to do. It was getting on with it.<br />

full evaluation of the resources he had to do that job, he<br />
was not in a position to talk to the media.<br />
Australia's complaints about subsidised sugar exports by<br />
the Common Market have been upheld by the Council of the<br />
General Agreement of Tariffs and Trade in Geneva. The Council<br />
has adopted a report which confirms Australia's submission<br />
that the EEC subsidy system has depressed world sugar<br />
prices in recent years. The report also concludes that the<br />
EEC subsidy system constitutes a permanent source of<br />
uncertainty in world sugar markets. The Deputy Prime Minister<br />
and Minister for Trade and Resources, Mr. Anthony, said today<br />
that at a time when members of the International Sugar<br />
Agreement were subjecting themselves to stringent discipline<br />
in production and export cuts, the EEC was expanding exports.<br />
Mr. Anthony said this economic irresponsiblity by the world's<br />
largest trading bloc was deplorable, and was the main reason<br />
why Australia had submitted its complaint to the GATT Council.<br />
