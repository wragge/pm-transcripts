FOR PRESS 7 FEBRUARY, 1979<br />
ICI AUSTRALIA LIMITED INVESTMENT IN<br />
PETROCHEMICAL EXPANSIONS<br />
The Prime Minister said today he was delighted at the<br />
announcement of ICI Australia's plans to invest in the<br />
expansion of its petrochemical capacity in Australia.<br />
The Company proposes a total investment in the<br />
project of $ 900 million between now and 1986.<br />
This will provide a tremendous immediate boost to the<br />
Botany area of New South Wales where ICI' s existing<br />
complex is to be expanded and also to Victoria where<br />
ICI will develop its recently purchased 766 hectare<br />
site at Point Wilson.<br />
The Prime Minister said he understood the Company's<br />
decision represented a milestone in the development of<br />
the local chemical industry. It will involve the<br />
establishment of production facilities to operate at<br />
close to world scale and an associated improvement<br />
in Australia's competitive position. When completed<br />
the plants will make a major contribution to<br />
Australia's balance of trade.<br />
The expansion will provide more than 1,000 construction<br />
jobs in the first half of 1980 with a peak of about<br />
1,750 jobs. The projects will create an additional<br />
800 operating jobs by 1985.<br />
The Prime Minister said the significant development was<br />
further evidence of the increasing health of the economy<br />
and the success of the Government's economic policies.<br />
There is no way that a major corporation such as ICI would<br />
commit itself to an investment of this magnitude in<br />
Australian manufacturing, if it did not believe that<br />
current Government policies to bring down inflation and<br />
restore economic growth will continue and will<br />
be successful. 000---</p>
