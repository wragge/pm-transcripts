<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>[inaudible] during your time in Western Australia?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I hope to talk to some of the people whose homes have been destroyed,</p>
<p> whose lives have been turned upside, and to find out in a sensible</p>
<p> way how the Federal Government can help and we are already helping</p>
<p> under the disaster relief arrangements. They come in automatically</p>
<p> whenever something like this happens and that's the case in Western</p>
<p> Australia or indeed anywhere else. There may be other things that</p>
<p> we can usefully do. The Western Australian Premier and I will talk</p>
<p> about it. We'll tour the area that's been devastated and</p>
<p> I'll have something more to say then. But it's certainly</p>
<p> had an enormous impact on that community. It's the most powerful</p>
<p> cyclone experienced by any part of Australia in recorded history so</p>
<p> it's an absolute miracle that apparently so far there's</p>
<p> been no loss of life and I can only hope that that continues to be</p>
<p> the case.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Can the people of Western Australia expect some added financial help?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I'll talk to the Premier about that. I don't think</p>
<p> it's appropriate to speculate on that at the moment.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>I suppose it's [inaudible] for both the Opposition Leader and</p>
<p> the Prime Minister to be travelling together...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I always believe on these things that the Opposition Leader should</p>
<p> be included. That has been my practice since I became Prime Minister</p>
<p> and I'll continue that while ever I'm Prime Minister. I</p>
<p> think these things are above and beyond party politics. They should</p>
<p> always have been so in the past, and they should be so in the future.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Are you concerned for the safety of Australians in Yugoslavia with</p>
<p> the NATO strikes coming [inaudible]?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well whenever bombs start being dropped obviously casualties are inevitable.</p>
<p> We gave warning to...a consulate warning was issued a few days</p>
<p> ago for people to try and leave the country. I support the NATO action.</p>
<p> It became unavoidable because of the stubbornness and the intransigence</p>
<p> of Milosevic. There's been plenty of opportunity to accommodate</p>
<p> the ethnic Albanian position in Kosovo. The determination of the Serbians</p>
<p> to pursue continued attacks and reprisals against the ethnic Albanians</p>
<p> is really the cause of this action by NATO. It's very regrettable,</p>
<p> it's very sad. It's always deeply disturbing for this kind</p>
<p> of conflict to occur. But as history has told us if you sit by and</p>
<p> do nothing you pay a much greater price later on.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Do you fear it could take quite an extended campaign to get Milosevic</p>
<p> to back down?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Look, I don't think I can make a judgement on that at the present</p>
<p> time. Any military action is always serious and of this order is particularly</p>
<p> serious. But it is justifiable and it has the support of the Australian</p>
<p> Government. Thank you.</p>
