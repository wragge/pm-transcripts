SPEECH BY T1HE PRIME A~ INISÃ±' EA, THE AT. HION. R. G.<br />
nEN4E,_ AT BETEGON THE 1st DECEMBR16<br />
Ladies and gentlemen:<br />
This seems to me like a real old fashioned political<br />
meeting. I am particularly delighted with it because this is<br />
a by-election, and, as you have been reminded, at this byelection,<br />
as indeed at all elections, you have to choose<br />
between the Gove: nnent and the Opposition.<br />
You've heard the Government here; you've heard the<br />
" opposition" there; ( Laughter, applause) and on Saturday week<br />
you will decide what side you are on. is it difficult?<br />
( Laughter, applause)<br />
Now I've noticed that there are three types of<br />
interjections. One says rubbish; and is rubbish. ( Laughter)<br />
One, of cours, is my time-honoured and most honourable title,<br />
" Pig-iron Bob" ( Applause) ( If I hadn't been made of some<br />
material of that kind I don't suppose I would be around today.)<br />
( Laughter, applause) And the third interjection ( Interjection:<br />
" How did you get the name " Pig-iron Bob?")<br />
Oh, would you like to hear the story? ( Interjections)<br />
Now if you are prepared to remain silent IYll tell you how I<br />
got the name. Because as you know, I was given the name by<br />
the Communists, and I'll tell you, if you would like to know,<br />
how I got it.<br />
You see the Communist-led waterside workers at Port<br />
Kembla were reusing to load a ship for Japan at a time when<br />
we Yere at peace with that country. They undertook to take<br />
charge of the foreign policy of this country.<br />
Qe being the Government ( Interjections) Now,<br />
wait a moment. Are you afraid of the story? ( Interjection:<br />
" No" l) ., ell listen to it then. ( Interjections) There is<br />
one thing you must always say about the Coins they're<br />
cowardly. ( Applause)<br />
The issue at that time uas, ' Who ran the foreign<br />
policy of Hustralia?' the lawfully elected Government, or a<br />
handful of waterside workers lod by the Communist, Roach, at<br />
Port Kembla. So I went down to them at Port Kembla I<br />
didn't talk to them on the long distance telephone I wont<br />
down and met them on the spot, and told them that they wrere<br />
going back to work because we were in charge of the Government<br />
of the country. And they went back to work. ( nar'
Since then I have honourably borne this title and<br />
seen it chalked on railway bridges. Each time I see it, I<br />
say " How well they trwat me; this is the finest unsolicited<br />
publicity that I could possibly have". ( Applause)<br />
But the third matter that has been thrown up a good<br />
deal tonight during two very interesting speeches, is the<br />
matter of the Crimos Act. I just think that perhaps to<br />
dispose of this largely bogus argumnent, I might say a word<br />
about it. ( There's a young gentleman over here who w'anted<br />
to invoke the name of the Presbyterian Church. I don't know<br />
whether he is a Presbyterian, is he? Are you, Sir? No.<br />
Well, I am) ( Applause) So perhaps as a membor of the<br />
Presbyterian Church I can say this to you ( Interjection:<br />
" Does that moan the Church is wrong? The fact that 1% m not a<br />
ruembcr, does that prove the Church is wrong?) Ohl It proves<br />
nothing. ( Interjection: " Jell why did you mention it then"?)<br />
I mentioned it because I thought I might like to establish </p>
<p>0 2,<br />
that if it comes to discussing the views of the Presbyterian<br />
Church I might be more qualified than you were. ( Laughter,<br />
applause) I say, without hesitation, that the Presbyterian<br />
Assembly was misled on this matter. My distinguished<br />
colleague, the Attorney-General, who has devoted infinite time<br />
and patience, and skill to this matter has written to the<br />
Presbyterian Assembly pointing out where the errors have been<br />
made. ( Interjection: " And they still disapprove,; i")<br />
Uell, I don't know. The Presbyterian Assembly has<br />
not met since they received this letter. So who are you to<br />
say that they disapprove. ( Applause) You want to brush<br />
yourself up on the procedures of the Presbyterian Church, I<br />
can see that. The whole point about it is this or rather there<br />
are two points about it. The first is this and I put<br />
this question to you, quite se: ciously, quite coldly. Does<br />
anybody in this hall believe that we ought not to have a<br />
Commonwealth Law against treason? Or against sabotage? Or<br />
against sedition? Does anybody believe that? Of course not,<br />
The Labour Party in the Federal Parliament was so<br />
little prepared to oppose the creation of laws in respect of<br />
these matters, that it did not oppose the Second Reading of<br />
the Bill. Now remember that. The Crimes Bill wont to its<br />
Second Rleading, and the Labour Party confined its attack to a<br />
series of particular points. ( Interjections)<br />
I may remind you that this Bill was brought down in<br />
Parliament, the second reading speech was made, and it : Ts a<br />
couple of months before it came on for discussion in the<br />
House. For the whole of that time it was available to anybody<br />
who cared to read it.<br />
I wonder how many people who are making noises about<br />
it tonight, have read the Crimes Bill. I wonder if the very<br />
young man there has read the Crimes Bill. I wonder. I wonder<br />
how many of them have read the speech made by the Attorney-<br />
General explaining the Crimes Bill. I wonder how many of you<br />
know that the campaign against the Crimes Bill started after<br />
the delivery of the Governor-Ganeral's speech at the opening<br />
of Parliament. It was started by the Communist Party in its<br />
newspapers. They have spent thousands of pounds on it; and<br />
their campaign was months old before the Bill was ever<br />
introduced, and before they knew one word of what was in it.<br />
That is a very interesting fact. Then, of course,<br />
people are easily misled on these matters. And so, " A Crimes<br />
Bill' This must be terrible!"<br />
UJell what was the great argument? I'll just deal<br />
with one central point of this. They said, " Oh, this is a<br />
shocking thing. Now this offence : f sabotage, you don't have<br />
to prove anything except the man's character". That was said,<br />
Lnd said almost in terms, by somebody in the Presbyterian<br />
Assembly. It was utterly wrrong. It has been said, repeatedly,<br />
by people who haven't read the Bill, and who know nothing<br />
about the substance of it, that here is a law, which would<br />
enable the Government to grab a man up, and to have him<br />
convicted before a jury only on evidence of his known<br />
cha-racter and threfore this is a monstrous political weapon.<br />
Now the fact is that you cannot prove before the </p>
<p>0 3.<br />
jury the offence of sabotage, without proving the act that was<br />
performed and that must be proved to the satisfaction of the<br />
jury and then in addition to that, if you want to prove the<br />
purpose for which the act was done, then you are at liberty,<br />
if the Judge regards it as material, and fair, to prove the<br />
known character of the accused. Now let me give you an<br />
example. Here is a simple example of what I moan and ll11<br />
leave it to the good sense, the enduring good sense of the<br />
Australian people.<br />
( Interjection: " You'll find out on the<br />
December". Well I'll find out, no doubt. I've been told that,<br />
you know, in 1949, in 1951, in 1954 and in 1958. And you<br />
will be yelling it out to me at the next General Election.<br />
( Applause) But you'll still be wrong.<br />
Now let us take a case, because this is an<br />
important matter. It is very important that we should not<br />
have unjust, or unfair laws on the ' tatute Book. Now let us<br />
take this example. A man is engaged in technical work, or work of a<br />
technical kind in a research establishmeont having rjlation to<br />
the defence of the country, and some extraordinary,<br />
complicated, difficult, new type of mechanism has been<br />
evolved. This is of tremendous importance, let us say, to<br />
the defence of the country; and this man, at a suitable<br />
occasion, when it is nearing it's tests, and has had many,<br />
many thousands of pounds spent on it, drops something into it<br />
and smashes it.<br />
He is seen. He drops a great lump of metal, or a<br />
spanner or whatever it may be well, pig. iron if you like<br />
( Laughter) he drops it in. He is at once grabbed. He has,<br />
on all superficial appecrances, committed an act of sabotage<br />
and a very serious one. It is simple to prove what happened.<br />
Then he says, " Well I'm terribly sorry, but my hands were a<br />
bit greasy and it slipped out of my hand, and I didn't mean it.<br />
I was the most surprised man in the place".<br />
Now let me put this to you my friends. Suppose the<br />
prosecution could establish that that man was a card carrying<br />
top-line Communist who had found his way into that works,<br />
and was there in a position to do damage in line with the<br />
Communist ideas. I put this to you, as a jury yourself; Do<br />
you think that that fact ought not to be available to the<br />
jury? Do you think that that fact ought to be concealed? And<br />
a man go free of an :. ct of that kind, perhaps at the very time<br />
when the country stands in its greatest danger? Of course not.<br />
Yet we were told by a variety of people, and<br />
unfortunately the Presbyterian Guneral i'ssembly of my own<br />
Church was persuaded to believe it, that you didn't have to<br />
prove the act; all you had to do was to prove the character.<br />
Now I've established to you I hope quite plainly<br />
that you must prove the act, the very act that was done. It<br />
must be established beyond -ll reasonable doubt to the jury.<br />
And if you do that, and if the Judge, being told what the<br />
other evidence is, says, " Yes, it is material; it is not<br />
unfair that this should go in" then you can prove the other<br />
things that rel!-te to the purpose with which the act was done.<br />
Now ladies and gentleoen, I want to go back to<br />
where I really intended to start. </p>
<p>4.<br />
References have been made here tonight to Frank<br />
Timison. I want to toll you that I regard his death as a very<br />
great loss to the Parliament. That is the common view, lot mo<br />
hasten to say, of members on both sides of the House.<br />
( Applause) Because he was an irmmensely popular man greatly<br />
respected, greatly trusted by friends and by foe. It is a<br />
very sad thing that he should have gone.<br />
But, there it is, these things happen. Therefore we<br />
have a by-election and we are, I think, speaking as head of<br />
the Government, extraordinarily fortunate that we have a<br />
candidate of the obvious calibre Mr. Chipp. ( Applause)<br />
Because in Parliament at any rate, people are judged, not by<br />
the amount of noise they can utter, but by the processus of<br />
their minds, by how much they can think, how much they can<br />
expound, how much they can judge the circumstances of the<br />
times. Therefore this is a great opportunity, once norc, to<br />
put into the Federal Parliaennt a uan of training and<br />
intelligence and experience who is capable of doing all those<br />
three rather difficult thing. Because chinking, and speech,<br />
and judgment are all difficult. And he can do themn<br />
Now what has been going on since Frank Tinson first<br />
wont into Parliament 11 years ago? have had quite a lot of<br />
elections. The elections nay be . reat fun to some people who<br />
just have to attend then. But from the point of view of the<br />
fellow who slogs through then all over Australia, they are<br />
very hard work. We have had now, in ' 49! and ' 51 and 54 and<br />
and ' 58, five elections in which I myself have been all<br />
over Australia. There have boon denunciations made of the<br />
Government. : Je have been told, even by ny genial and<br />
admirable friend, . rthur Calwell, that we are on the vergo of<br />
ruin. voery time ruin and desolation have been prophesied:<br />
mass unemployment, all sorts of things. Yet the interesting<br />
thing is that on each of these five occasions, as you all saw<br />
the issue has been up. People in Australia are not so stupid<br />
as not to know their own circumstances.<br />
Uhat I object to about some of my opponents is that<br />
they think the people are so silly. I have a great respect<br />
for the wisdom of the people. And the people, exercising<br />
their wisdom, and knowing their own circumstances bettor than<br />
any politician could, has five tires in succession, returned<br />
us to office. That is worth rmoembering. ( Applause)<br />
And the ALP Candid . te, rhoever he nay be I don't<br />
know in this electorate, has a heavy task. ( Interjections)<br />
But, ladies and gentlemen, just glance over the<br />
events, the policies of these years. Ask yourselves why it is<br />
that you have voted for us so steadfastly If you look back<br />
over the 11 years you can answer that question quite simply.<br />
You look outside Australia; look at our relations with the<br />
rest of the world. They are a great deal better, aren't they,<br />
than they were 11 years ago? ( Inturjctlons)<br />
Really that's a brave remark for anybody to say " No",<br />
because I venture to say that 11 years ago, 12 years : go, our<br />
relations with the United States of A.: erica, to c. n<br />
extent, our relations with Great Britain, were lower than they<br />
had been for a long, long time,<br />
So we sot out reoairing this position. I want to </p>
<p>remind the audience of this. If they want to know what the<br />
test is to take, for an example, of our rel. tions with the<br />
United States a very important relationship. Because let<br />
me remind them, the United States is not a neutral country.<br />
The United States is the greatest power in the free world, and<br />
a great friend and assistant of other countries in the free<br />
world. Make no mistake about that. There is no question of<br />
neutrality today about the United States, any more than there<br />
is about Great Britain.<br />
Therefore just lot us consider what has happened<br />
during our term of office.<br />
I don't think the United States of America had<br />
except in the case of the North Atlantic freaty, the NAT6<br />
Organisation, comi-ittd itself in military, or semi-military<br />
terms, to other countries, because of Constitutional<br />
difficulties, because of the position of the President and the<br />
restrictions on his power.<br />
iJe have, during our term of office, secured and been<br />
largely instrumental in securing two agreements by wray of<br />
treaty with the United States of America. One is the ANZUS<br />
Pact, United States, ustralia, Now Zealand, a Pact of the<br />
most enormous importance to us, an arrangement under which, at<br />
revular intervals, there are consultations on the political and<br />
the military level, between these three countries.<br />
Later on came the South East Asian Treaty, in which<br />
the partners are Pakistan, Thailand, the Philippines, the<br />
United States, the United Kingdom, France, Now Zealand and<br />
Australia. Now here you have another form of organisation,<br />
rather similar, in some ways, to the NATO Organisation in the<br />
Atlantic. Let me remind you that but for the existence of<br />
NATO, but for the close co-operation that exists between the<br />
United States and Canada, and Great Britain, and France, and<br />
4. est Germany, but for that, and the defensive forces which are<br />
deployed in r. stern Europe, who knows whether we wouldn't have<br />
been in war years ago. These are enormously important<br />
considerations. ( Interjection: " It's not to your credit")<br />
rlol, I hope you will allow me to take a little<br />
credit for the fact that it was my Governent ( Applause) which<br />
obtained ANZUS and GEATO-on neither occsion, with any<br />
particular approval by the Labour Party. As to the other<br />
fellows, not Labour, not Liberal one hesitates to name them<br />
what their attitude wvas, I wouldn't know.<br />
But I do know this, that the security of this<br />
country has been strengthened and strengthened to an extent<br />
that concerns everybody in this hall tonight, and everybody in<br />
Australia, during the last ten years. ( Applause)<br />
Now, Sir, just lot ro for a few minutes consider the<br />
internal, the domestic side of this matter.<br />
I wonder if everybody realises that in these years,<br />
in these last few years, 10 years, 12 years, whatever it may<br />
be it all began under Mr. Calwell : hose work in relation to<br />
Imigration I think was adirablo: ( I've never denied that)<br />
we have received substantially over a million new people into<br />
this country. Our population has risen year by year, partly<br />
by migration, partly by natural increase, at a percentage rate<br />
rather higher than Japan. That is worth thinking about. </p>
<p>6.<br />
Do you remember how , we always used to be told that<br />
of course the tooming millions wont on teoiing? Our<br />
percontage increase has boon quite remarkable.<br />
Now this is not easily done. You can't bring as<br />
many people as that into a country without putting enornous<br />
strains on the oconomy of the country. You have, and very<br />
properly, great demands on the one side for houses and schools<br />
and roads and facilities. You can't have 10% of the<br />
population brand now, like that, without having all these<br />
additional demands.<br />
Of course on the other hand you add to your labor<br />
force hundreds of thousands of people who are accustoiled to<br />
working hard, who Jo into factories, who have taken on great<br />
responsibilities, in heavy industries particulaly. So you try<br />
to get some balance out of all these things.<br />
But there must have been quite a few people who<br />
thought that this large nigrition programmeo was foolish because<br />
it would throw Australians out of rwork. Don't you think it<br />
has been a pretty good achieov-nt over these ten years to take<br />
in, and absorb, these hundreds of thousands, this million and<br />
iore of people, without any unemployment at all? ( Applause)<br />
Then take another thing, take another aspect of this.<br />
You can't increase the population of the country at this rate<br />
without setting out to develop the resources of the country.<br />
Because if you didn't have the development of new resources,<br />
you couldn't carry additional population.<br />
Therefore we have had the most truemndous tas. in<br />
front of us of developing Australia, not solely that we should<br />
do it: the State Governmonts have had it; local authorities<br />
have it. But Australia, as a N.. tion has had this treeondous<br />
task of national development.<br />
I don't think " nybody on either side of the House<br />
would deny that the economic development in Australia in ten<br />
years has been almost fabulous. Even my distinguished opponent<br />
the Leader of the Opposition, had to say the other day. " I<br />
adrh-it" as if it were a matter of reluctance " that the<br />
country is very prosperous".<br />
fell there it is. ( Interjectins) My dear fellow<br />
the fact that you are alive doesn't disprove my case.<br />
( Laughter) ift., r all, that kind of odd thing must occur in<br />
the best regulated countries. ( Laughter) The fact is that it<br />
is a very prosperous country.<br />
1What is much more important, perhaps, than individual<br />
prosperity, is the fact that the whole basis of future<br />
development in Australia is being laid strongly and well. You<br />
can see it in all asp. cts of our life.<br />
In spite of L-bour doctrines to the contrary, it is<br />
not possible to develop Australia, a country of ten million<br />
people, merely by the savings of ten million people. Ton<br />
million can save a good deal we do in .' ustralia but if we<br />
are going to develop the cuuntry and take on these enormous<br />
undertakings, like the Snowy Mountains Schone a Å 450 million<br />
job if we are going to take on a lot of these other tasks<br />
and perform them, then Te must be able to attract into<br />
Australia capital from) overseas.<br />
Now I just want to say something about this before<br />
I finish capital from . verscas. ( Interjections) </p>
<p>0 7.<br />
I know that my friends opposite by opposite I mean<br />
not there, but up at Canberra that my friends opposite are a<br />
bit cold on sotting capital in fron overseas. They think, you<br />
know, Mr. Chairman, that there is somothing wrong dout<br />
allowing Americans, or Englishmon, or even Scotsmen, to come<br />
into the country and invest their capital, and take somn<br />
profits out of the country. This they regard in sono strange<br />
way, as an evil thing.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen, I wonder if they realise that<br />
our net capital ' ain, not Government borrowing, but private<br />
investment, genuine productive private investment, our capital<br />
gain fron overseas in the last eight years has avera. od at<br />
least Å 100 million a year; and last year it reached its peak<br />
at Å 200 million. But for the movement into Australia of these groat<br />
sums of refreshing money, this irrigation of Australian<br />
enterprise, this creation of work and factories and i: iploynent,<br />
the rate of progress in Australia would have been slowed down,<br />
and we could not have accomnodated the flow of migrants that<br />
we have received. That is just one of the simple facts of the economic<br />
life of the nation. I-mention it to you because although you<br />
will encounter people who will argue about all sorts of things<br />
that touch them personally, or that are toeporary, your real<br />
task now, and when the next General Election comes along, will<br />
be to say to yourselves, quite simply: " Do we think that this<br />
state of affairs will continue under the other Government?".<br />
And of course it won't, of course it won't. eocause<br />
people abroad are not fools on these matters. They are not<br />
going to invest their money, and put their enterprise and skill<br />
to work in a country if they think that it is an unstable<br />
country if they think that it is run by people who are<br />
ignorant, or incompetent. ( Interjections)<br />
My dear boy one of these days you should sit down<br />
and road a little history; it will greatly improve your mind.<br />
You will find that your ideas about what happened then just<br />
won't bear the slightest exanination.<br />
( Interjection: " Now go on Bob, tell us about<br />
inflation and r und it off. heard you') ( Laughter)<br />
Stand up, stand up and let's Lave a look you. I<br />
wish you would stand up because I reckon-( Interjections)<br />
I wish you would have stood up, because at a glanco, in the<br />
distance, I wouldn't think I needed to tell you anything<br />
about inflation at all. ( Laughter, pplause)<br />
Now, ladies and gentlemen, I have confined m: y renarks<br />
to a couple of ratters which I think are of considerable<br />
importance. I just repcat to you that you have a choice to<br />
make on this matter. All I do is to urge you to make your<br />
choice, with thought. I know that there is always somebody<br />
wsho will say, " Ah, the Government is going to get it in the<br />
neck". Iell, only the other day, metaphorically, we had a<br />
by-election in Bendigo and I was told the same thing, ,. nd what<br />
happened in Bondigo? The Government candidate got more votes<br />
than before. The Labour majority was lower than it was before.<br />
I thought it was pretty g: od.<br />
. e had a by-election in Calare. The Government<br />
majority increased. </p>
<p>There arc all sorts of calariity hu-21rs, profe ssio. nal<br />
nioaners, and those who cnt, rtain this strango oantastic,<br />
juvenile idea that thero is something clever about kicking the<br />
Govorriont ais long,-as you don't 17ick it Out,<br />
You know that is a protty poor perfrmance isn't it?<br />
They say, '" Iell it's a by-el ction, , iye them-a k: ick0 I t<br />
won't put therm out':. Of course you would neverL dreami uf<br />
voting theni out at a General Eliction, " Buit lot's Jve thorm<br />
a kick". W~ ell I have hnad a fair fe's kicks in may tj-. ime, elnd I<br />
won't loso cany sloep over it, ono a of-theoh' B3Ut I<br />
think you will, unless this election -ces T believe ujill.<br />
( Applause)<br />
Question: I would like to know why does the Goernncont<br />
consistently contest sea-ts in the country, as Liberals, against<br />
the Country Party?<br />
Pririe Ministcr: -dll, Sir, I Ui-sor., ry to,. disappoint but you) L i. my<br />
not be aware of the fact that theru are t'io m-. aterial facts<br />
here. One is that at Canberra r.-y Party and the Co: untry party<br />
work to,, thor in Govornncnt in thei neist comr~ plete am-ity and<br />
have done so for a record period of timeo.<br />
The scecond is this, that if you would cast your eye<br />
over the list of memorbers sittin-7 in thei House of Rop.-csontativizs<br />
you would find that there are more country memlbers bolanr~ into<br />
the) Libral Party than the(-rj are to any otheri Party, ( Apluse)<br />
Question: I would like to direct a-questi. an, thmhyo-u<br />
Chairman, to the Honuurablo the Prime 111inister.-4hy, a fter<br />
spe aking for so long he did no) t me,, ntion Mr, Holt' s ' hoirro2"<br />
budget? ( LauEghter)<br />
Primo Minister: Sir, the : mIswer that is qui; Uc. siimp-lci 3&amp;-cLuse it<br />
is not c, h-orror" budot it is a perifectly sensible set of vory<br />
mioderate proposals. And before we, go muchn longer in AIustralia<br />
people will re alise h-ow it s. Don't forgot that people<br />
like you were screaming blue m-ur-der: backl ir 1952. about the<br />
*-reat i3udget that was called the " Horror 31jd But by the<br />
time. i it had done its wo-rrk, the -oa., sJ ror o-elocted by<br />
the people of Australia. ( 1tippiaus,.) </p>
<p>Question: Are you prOparod to ; ive us Neti-nal Insurance in this<br />
c") untry?<br />
Prime Minister: Sir, I venture to say that the Australian system of<br />
Social Services has no sup-rior in the world. The fact is<br />
that the answor to your complaint, if it is uno, is that there<br />
have boon many, many thousands, hundreds of thousands of<br />
people come out here to .' ustralia knowing what our Social<br />
Services are. ~ nd I haven't hoard that they go back.<br />
The fact is that you can never compare one set of<br />
Social Services in ono country with another set in another<br />
country, because they have different foundations and they<br />
cover different itues. But the Social Service systom in<br />
Australia is I venture to say we can always argue about<br />
details in it in the broad, and in the substance, has no<br />
supcri', r in the world. ( Applause)<br />
Question: Will the Prime Ministor undertake soue rovision of our<br />
education policy throughout r. ustralia so that we have<br />
diplomats trained in sian languages, ministers trained in<br />
observation and history of . Asian affairs and in general a<br />
better educated Cabinet?<br />
Prine Minister: I understand you perfectly Sir. I an very happy to<br />
answer this question because I am surprised that you have not<br />
realised that if any l-rii: ne iinister in the history of this<br />
country can feel sor. pride about what has been done for<br />
University education in Australia, I'm the fellow.<br />
( Interjection: " You haven't done mnything")<br />
Oh! Haven't we? : Jcll then, Sir, I will tell you<br />
that my Govern. ient was the first Goverrnuont to establish<br />
grants to the States for the State Universities. After<br />
running tholn for a couple of yoirs, and establishing the<br />
Coli-uonwealth scholarships<br />
( Interjection: " 4f, 000 of theon")<br />
There were 3,000. Joll don't you like to hear an<br />
answer? You nay have learned Asian languages, but you badly<br />
need to learn a little courtesy. ( Applause) I'll continuo<br />
with my answoer to this somewhat jvasive inturjector of nine.<br />
After running a systole of rants I ustablished the<br />
Murray Convitteeoo. The i'urray Covinittej came out and<br />
invostigated the " ustralian Universitios. They brought donm<br />
reconreondations which involved what scoiod to us to be enorious<br />
Coli: ronwealth oxpenditures on University education iwhich was<br />
not, tochnically, our rcsponsibility.<br />
adopted overy rucoiieondtion. And, in cunsoquence,<br />
over the three years that have just finished, the C-;: innwelth<br />
itself has fund over Å 20 million towards the Universities of<br />
Australia c sui of money without which nuJt one of then: could<br />
have expanded and half of then would have ) no broke. </p>
<p>Then we appointed a Universities Coumission they<br />
nay of course, be inconpotont people. Ithink they are a group<br />
of the most distinguishod people in Australia under the<br />
Chairmanship of Sir Leslie , Mrtin.<br />
The Connission investigated the Universities. It<br />
brought down its recommendations only the other day for the<br />
second three years. Those recolmendations involved an increase<br />
in the Commonwealth payments f-om 20 mili. ons in throe years<br />
to Å 39 millions in the next three years, ihat is a total in<br />
six years of Å 59 million. Every recolmnendation they made has<br />
been accepted. And then I live long enouh to hcar some<br />
fellow get up and say, " It's time we took a bit of interest in<br />
Universities". ( Applause<br />
Question: I ask the Prime Minister; :' Is it a fact that since<br />
1949 prices have a little more than doubled? It is also a<br />
fact that your Government has given only increase in child<br />
endowment for one child only. Now wouldn't it logically<br />
follow that the value of that child endow) ont is about half of<br />
what it was originally? Do you think this is a good record?<br />
Prime Ministor: Ladies and gentlemen, this question is a perfect<br />
example of how people can got matters confused, The fact is<br />
that I don't need to be put in the dock about child endowment.<br />
My own Government introduced it. Nor do I need to be put in<br />
the dock about the extension of child endowment for the first<br />
child; because it was my Govcrnment that did it. So we have<br />
a little positive entry on u: r books of child endowment. Your<br />
Party has none.<br />
If you are going to understand the significance of<br />
Child Endowment then I want you to have a look at this.<br />
Child Endowront was introduced at a time when the<br />
Arbitration Court, as it then was, was greatly concerned to<br />
know how it could do something better for the family wagoearner.<br />
It was because of that exanination that child<br />
endowment came into the picture.<br />
Later on the . rbitr,' tion Court, and the Arbitration<br />
Commission nor, and more developed the idea that the basic wage<br />
ought to be the highest wage that industry can bear. So that<br />
it is no longer just a matter of counting up what a family<br />
needs though that may have some impact on it. The real<br />
thing is to sy, " What is the highest wage that industry can<br />
pay?". ' Wa3os in real terms have gone up since the first<br />
introduction of child endoweont very much indeed.<br />
If the gentleman putting the question will study a<br />
little the ; raph of the cost-of-living figures, the series<br />
Index, or whatever other Index figure he may care to look at,<br />
and also look at the rises in the basic waoge to say nothing of<br />
the competitive wages that are built up on top of it, he will<br />
find that there has been a very substantial increase in real<br />
wages at a time when the child endowvont payment has stood<br />
still. One adds itself to the othor; and the result has been<br />
a pretty prosperous co-munity. </p>
