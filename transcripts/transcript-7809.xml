PIRNIMISE 8E<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW WITH PAUL LYNEHAM, 7.30 REPORT<br />
14 NOVEMBER 1989<br />
E OE PROOF ONLY<br />
LYNEHAM: Prime Minister, thanks for joining us.<br />
PM: It's a pleasure Paul.<br />
-LYNEHAM: Eighteen and a half million dollars for<br />
international promotion of our tourist industry and<br />
eleven and a half for domestic promotion. What are we<br />
going to be saying overseas, " come back, we're sorry'?<br />
PM: We've got nothing to be sorry about. All the<br />
attractions of Australia are permanent features. We<br />
still are the most attractive tourist destination in the<br />
world I would suggest.<br />
LYNEHAM: But we must be on the nose a bit in Japan.<br />
PM: We're not on the nose. I've had the opportunity as<br />
you would've appreciated in recent weeks of meeting with<br />
a lot of people from Asia. Our Japanese friends were<br />
here for APEC. We're not on the nose.<br />
LYNEHAM: But yet we're not even in some of the travel<br />
pamphlets being distributed now in the East Coast of<br />
America and in Japan for the Christmas-New Year period.<br />
PM: Just let me make this point to you. The increase in<br />
international tourism to Australia as you know has been<br />
enormous. The industry and the Government is confident<br />
that that growth can be maintained. The important thing,<br />
looking at it long term which is I know what you're<br />
interested in as I am is that of course we are going<br />
into next year with an infinitely more efficient and<br />
productive airline industry than we've ever had in this<br />
country before. That's the important thing.<br />
LYNEHAM: So if I ask you how long before we get right<br />
back to taws in the international market what would you<br />
say? PM: We'll be back to taws in the international market<br />
next year.<br />
LYNEHAM: And the domestic promotion you're targetting,<br />
Tassie, the Northern Territory and North Queensland. </p>
<p>PM: It is not confined to them. There will be, as we<br />
put it, a $ 5 million generic Australian advertising<br />
campaign and then there'll be the $ 6.5 million which will<br />
be targetted most particularly at those areas that have<br />
suffered the most and that is the Northern Territory,<br />
Northern Queensland and Tasmania.<br />
LYNEHAM: What did you mean when you said recently that<br />
you thought Paul Keating might have handled his attack on<br />
John Elliott differently if he had his time again?<br />
PM: I meant one thing and one thing only. I'm not<br />
dodging the question, I'll come directly to it but it's<br />
fair that I should make this point because there has been<br />
some attempt to misinterpret, if I can put it that way,<br />
what I said. I have total faith in Paul Keating. He was<br />
absolutely right in making the point that John Elliott<br />
epitomised the total inequity and the economic insanity<br />
of the Liberals' capital gains tax policy. Let me say<br />
that I'll be shoulder to shoulder with Paul Keating in<br />
continuing that attack upon a policy which I believe is<br />
arguably the most grotesque socially inequitable policy<br />
that this country has seen and in economic terms the most<br />
disastrous. Now I simply was making the point, and you<br />
as a journalist would understand this. Politicians like<br />
journalists have sources. You as a journalist will not<br />
reveal your source. That's your ethic. And in Paul<br />
Keating's case I know from my conversation with Paul that<br />
he believed totally in the source that he had as to the<br />
accuracy of what he was putting. The difficulty of<br />
course, his difficulty was in not being able to reveal<br />
that source. Now I meant no more than this, that having<br />
made the statement he did and having the inability to<br />
reveal his source that that was a problem which if he'd<br />
had his time again he might have rearranged his<br />
presentation. But I mean no more and no less than that.<br />
LYNEHAM: So you weren't implying he should have softened<br />
his presentation?<br />
PM: Not softened his presentation because what has been<br />
done by Andrew Peacock and let me say this on the<br />
question of the involvement of Mr Elliott. Mr Elliott on<br />
many occasions has boasted publicly and openly about his<br />
involvement in policy development in the Liberal Party.<br />
Just let me give you one reference, very quickly. This<br />
was on the 14th of May on a television program I won't<br />
mention it, it wasn't yours. But on the 14th of May he<br />
was asked the question ' do you think Peacock's a wiser<br />
politician than he was a couple of years ago?' John<br />
Elliott ' I have spent some time with him as Treasurer<br />
and Deputy Leader on the economic policy. And when it<br />
comes out I think the community is going to be very<br />
pleased with it.' Now here is Elliott saying he's deeply<br />
involved. </p>
<p>LYNEHAM: There is a very real difference between having<br />
a hand in policy as Party President and having a hand in<br />
policy, a particular plank of policy for your own<br />
personal gain.<br />
PM: There is no possibility in my judgement of any<br />
rational analysis which would suggest that if John<br />
Elliott was involved, as he boasted, in the development<br />
of economic policy for the Liberal Party that there<br />
wouldn't have been, in those discussions, reference to<br />
the capital gains tax element. Now the question of<br />
whether specifically he raised the question at some point<br />
about the Harlin bid and the capital gains tax, I don't<br />
know whether he did or not. I'm simply saying that in<br />
regard to the basic issue, the central element of their<br />
policy of the abolition of the capital gains tax, it<br />
beggars belief that if Elliott is saying he was involved<br />
in discussions about economic policy that they put a<br />
barrier around him being involved in discussions about<br />
capital gains tax.<br />
LYNEHAM: Whatever Mr Elliott did or did not do you say<br />
your remarks were misinterpreted but it does seem that Mr<br />
Keating misinterpreted them too because he said, didn't<br />
he in Tokyo, that if he had his time again he would've<br />
gone in harder.<br />
PM: I've got no doubt, and you'll see when he comes<br />
back, you won't have to be theoretical about this<br />
LYNEHAM: Was it a slap in the face to Bob Hawke?<br />
PM: Certainly not, certainly not. When Paul is away<br />
LYNEHAM: You've often had troubles in the past<br />
PM: When Paul's away we stay in contact with one<br />
another. I've spoken with him, as I will not<br />
continuously but regularly while he's away. There's no<br />
problem in that regard. You wait and see when Paul<br />
Keating comes back, not only in regard to Paul Keating<br />
but in regard to Paul Keating and the Prime Minister. We<br />
will be attacking the Liberal-National Party policy. The<br />
economic policy generally but most specifically their<br />
policy to abolish the capital gains tax. Because, as I<br />
say, it is grotesquely inequitable that you can have the<br />
promise of a Government which is going to return billions<br />
of dollars to a tiny percentage, one percent of the<br />
population, including John Elliott, and deny to that<br />
Government the capacity and the revenue to look after the<br />
kids of this community. Paul Keating and Bob Hawke will<br />
be in there attacking that as vigorously as we are each<br />
capable of doing. </p>
<p>LYNEHAM: Prime Minister, this misunderstanding about the<br />
Treasurer is extremely widespread. I put it to you that<br />
you'd probably be the only person in Australia who<br />
doesn't believe that the Treasurer has openly defied you<br />
on this.<br />
PM: You can do what you like. I mean Paul was asked a<br />
question. He gave, as he is very very capable of doing,<br />
a jesting line in which he said I might as well have gone<br />
in harder. I'm simply making the point that neither Paul<br />
Keating nor Bob Hawke regarded that as any slap in the<br />
face to me. If neither he nor I do that I guess that's<br />
the most important thing. Let me say this, that the test<br />
will be, when he comes back, you watch us both in action<br />
on this issue.<br />
LYNEHAM: Is there any justification at all for<br />
Opposition claims that your wife is campaigning for Labor<br />
through her involvement with Greening Australia and<br />
Austcare? PM: No, I must say that I regard their performance as<br />
pathetic. We've seen yet again this current leader of<br />
the Opposition flip-flopping on an issue again. First of<br />
all grabbed hold of a tasteless comment by a Senator from<br />
Queensland. When you want to find not the most elevated<br />
form of political life you look at Opposition Senators<br />
from Queensland.<br />
LYNEHAM: Mr Peacock says she does seem to feature in a<br />
fair number of taxpayer-funded commercials.<br />
PM: But then what did flip-flop Andrew do? After having<br />
taken the cheap swipe he got a bath last night, and<br />
particularly from Laurie Oakes, got a bath and then said<br />
of course not, I'm not attacking Hazel, I admire her. A<br />
pretty overall gutless performance.<br />
LYNEHAM: Of course the truth is she's probably more<br />
popular than the both of you at the moment isn't she?<br />
PM: Yes, I'd be very surprised if Hazel well I'm<br />
significantly more popular than Andrew but I would be<br />
very surprised if she didn't pip us both.<br />
LYNEHAM: Thank you and good night.<br />
PM: Thanks mate.<br />
ends </p>
