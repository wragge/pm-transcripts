FINANCIAL REVIEW DINNER<br />
ADDRESS BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
SYDNEY 21 AUGUST 1991<br />
These Financial Review Post Budget dinners have become as<br />
much a fixture in the calendar as the Budget itself. My<br />
Government has brought down nine Budgets, and I have taken<br />
the opportunity to address the business community at this<br />
gathering nine times.<br />
I don't suppose any of those addresses has been delivered in<br />
so dramatic an inter-national context as this one. The coup<br />
against President Gorbachev has profound implications for<br />
the whole world, not least in its potential to halt the<br />
process of restructuring the Soviet economy.<br />
This is not the occasion to go into the deep problems that<br />
the Soviet Union faces, or the threat to the profound hopes<br />
which we all had invested in President Gorbachev's<br />
liberating achievements through perestroika and glasnost.<br />
The situation is extraordinarily volatile. But I believe<br />
that the forces unleashed by President Gorbachev in favour<br />
of a more democratic Soviet Union are too far down the track<br />
to be turned around permanently.<br />
The totally discredited system of the central command<br />
economy has collapsed. It can never be rebuilt. Should<br />
those forces which seek to turn the clock back to the 1950s<br />
triumph, the result could only be a catastrophe.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen,<br />
One thing I did notice in the coverage of the serious<br />
newspapers of the events in the Soviet Union was that on<br />
every front page the reaction of " the markets" was noted.<br />
I mention this, because it is evidence of the profound<br />
change in the way that We Australians look at the world and<br />
our place in it. And that change in attitudes is equally<br />
reflected in the way we now look at the annual Budget and<br />
its place in the economic and social policy of our nation.<br />
812 </p>
<p>The emphasis the media gave to the impact of the Soviet<br />
crisis on the markets is an example of the day-to-day<br />
interest the whole community has developed in economic<br />
affairs. Every night on the television news, right up there with the<br />
old reliables, sport and the weather, we now see the<br />
exchange rate. We have, reports on the behaviour of the All<br />
Ordinaries, the Nikkei, the Dow Jones and the FT. Selected<br />
stocks rise and fall in our living rooms.<br />
And, of course, this new level of community interest this<br />
level of economic sophistication is reflected in the<br />
response to the Budget..<br />
in the old days, Budgets were treated rather like one of<br />
those Bruce Petty econtmy machines. The Budget was the<br />
single engine of economic management, which was supposed to<br />
prime the pump, push thne buttons, pull the levers and patch<br />
the cables in the one document at the one time.<br />
Those were the days where Australians waited with their<br />
hearts in their mouths and their hands on their wallets for<br />
the great Budget headline: Beer, Cigs, Petrol Up. ( but not,<br />
of course, in a distinguished tabloid like the Financial<br />
Review.) The Budget is no longer seen as the single engine of<br />
economic management. Economic management is a continuing<br />
process, and it is in that context that the ninth Labor<br />
Budget, the first Kerin Budget, must be placed.<br />
May I say in this respect that I am amazed at the<br />
mindlessness or plain stupidity of some commentators that<br />
this Budget demonstrat~ es a lack of planning or doesn't have<br />
vision for the future.<br />
They either suffer from selective amnesia or are being<br />
deliberately perverse.<br />
This Budget is the third instalment of policy decisions<br />
which have made 1991 the year of the most substantial and<br />
far-reaching reforms, not just in the life of this<br />
Government, but in the entire post-war era.<br />
The Budget must be seen in the context of the continuing and<br />
comprehensive process of reform on which we have embarked.<br />
It must be assessed in the context of the pivotal programs<br />
we have placed on the national agenda, including those which<br />
we are seeing working through this year, such as the<br />
abolition of the two airlines policy and telecommunications<br />
reform. 813 </p>
<p>But in this year of 1991 alone we have:<br />
The program Bet in train through my March Statement<br />
the acceleration of unprecedented tariff reform; the<br />
refocussing of Australia's trade promotion to the Asia-<br />
Pacific region; waterfront reform; taxation reform,<br />
notably the simplification of the depreciation<br />
provisions and the widening of sales tax exemptions;<br />
resource security; the advance towards ' the Clever<br />
Country, with the opening of the f irst 15 cooperative<br />
research centres, and extra funding for higher<br />
education and training.<br />
Again in this year of 1991 alone there are the commitments<br />
undertaken through the Special Premiers Conference process:<br />
The National Rail Corporation; the National Road<br />
Transport Commission; the Electricity Grid Management<br />
Council; business deregulation which will sweep away<br />
the stupidity of having six sets of regulations around<br />
our nation; and the major reforms of Commonwealth-State<br />
financial relations, set down for the November 13991<br />
Special Premiers Conference.<br />
And' Tuesday's Budget must be seen as part of this<br />
unprecedented program of reform, in this yz=. of<br />
unprecedented reform.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen,<br />
The budget aims to consolidate the work of its predecessors.<br />
Its aim is sustainable growth with low inflation. It is<br />
part of a continuing process toward structural reform and<br />
social justice. It continues the work the task of the<br />
past eight years of building an internationally<br />
competitive Australian economy.<br />
It is a Budget designed to contribute to economic recovery,<br />
but I emphasise immediately the point I made at the Labor<br />
Centenary Conference in June:<br />
We are determined that this recovery will be different<br />
in character and quality from any merely cyclical<br />
recovery this country has seen in the past. We are<br />
determined that this recovery will unambiguously repay<br />
the pain of the recession with substantial and lasting<br />
gain.<br />
That means, in the first place, we must ensure that we hold<br />
the historic gains against inflation an inflation rate now<br />
lower than the average of our major trading partners. But<br />
it means much more than that.<br />
It means: a recovery which will see the resumption of secure<br />
employment growth;<br />
814 </p>
<p>a recovery in which thet competitiveness Of Australia's<br />
manufacturing industry will continue to improve;<br />
a recovery in which Australian workers will gain access<br />
to improved superannuation and,* through the<br />
continuation of award r: estructuring and the<br />
introduction of the flexibility provided by enterprise<br />
bargaining, will achieve higher levels of productivity,<br />
greater job satisfaction and better remuneration;<br />
and a recovery in which we will see further<br />
improvements in efficiency, through effective microeconomic<br />
reform.<br />
The fundamental thing about this Budget is that it is<br />
fiscally responsible. That may not be a very exciting<br />
concept to sell but it is: vital to achieving a recovery<br />
that will provide continuing employment growth and<br />
improvements in living standards.<br />
We were not persuaded by ar~ guments calling for us to spend<br />
our way out of the recession, nor by those who would have<br />
had us destroy the social welfare system in an ill-judged<br />
quest for savings at precis~ ely the time it is providing<br />
greatest assistance to Australians in need.<br />
While the Budget is the first in five years to provide for a<br />
deficit, all spending initiatives are fully offset by<br />
savings. We have protected the structural integrity of the Budget,<br />
while at the same time directing major new resources to<br />
families and disadvantaged groups, the cities and the<br />
environment. We have fully offset all these new policy decisions with<br />
savings through a careful reassessment of priorities,<br />
rationalisation of existing programs, and making them more<br />
efficient. The deficit is largely accounted for by rising income<br />
support payments and by falling tax revenues. Higher<br />
unemployment benefits alone account for around 80% of the<br />
real growth in outlays thiLs year.<br />
In 1991-92 outlays, boosted by the recession, will be 25.7<br />
per cent of GDP, considerably lower than the 28.8 per cent<br />
of GDP we inherited in 19132-83.<br />
And the forward estimates show expenditure falling as a<br />
share of GDP over the next few years.<br />
Because we were determined not to fiddle with the basic<br />
structure of the Budget, determined not to compromise its<br />
integrity, it means that as the economy recovers, so too<br />
will the surplus, and the Commonwealth's position as a net<br />
saver. 815 </p>
<p>I have said, and I Bay again, that signs of the recovery are<br />
there. We will see it actually happening this year.<br />
The Budget forecasts a three per cent inflation figure and a<br />
drop in the current account deficit of around $ 14 billion to<br />
percent of GDP. Those are very encouraging numbers.<br />
If we turn to exports, we see that the figures for last<br />
year, and the forecasts for this year, are proof of the<br />
structural changes we have brought about in the economy of<br />
this country.<br />
Firstly, the balance of goods and services is forecast to be<br />
in surplus in 1991-92 for the first time since 1979-80.<br />
Secondly, net exports are expected to contribute 1.25% to<br />
the 1.5t year average growth of GDP in 1991-92.<br />
Thirdly, we can see results of investment in the 1980s<br />
ref lected in expert growth, particularly manufactured<br />
experts. The volume of experts ( goads and services) rose by 13% in<br />
1990-91, with manufactured exports rising by 25.5%.<br />
Those are the realities. It is on that basis that we I; ay<br />
confidently: the 1991-92 Budget is appropriate for the<br />
times. It provides the foundation for a sustainable<br />
economic recovery through lower inflation.<br />
While low inflation is not sufficient in itself for<br />
sustainable growth it is a necessary pre-requisite.<br />
It allows us to have lower nominal interest rates. it<br />
encourages those with spare cash to invest it wisely rather<br />
than chasing speculative capital gains from rising pric: es.<br />
It helps business to compete in overseas markets.<br />
We have now joined the league of low-inflation nations for<br />
the first time in two decades.<br />
That will bring enduring benefits to Australia better<br />
investment, lower interest rates, improved competitiveness.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen,<br />
Wages policy is, of course, an integral part of the fight to<br />
make low inflation a permanent feature of the Australian<br />
economy. With my colleagues, the Treasurer, the Minister for Finance,<br />
and the Minister for Industrial Relations, I met the ACTU<br />
leadership last week. We discussed a range of issues, and<br />
reached a specific understanding on wages outcomes.<br />
816 </p>
<p>The Government and the Trade Union movement are commited to<br />
achieving greater flexibilty and decentralisation in the<br />
wages system through the introduction of productivity based,<br />
enterprise bargaining.<br />
This is an essential part of making Australia an<br />
internationally competitive economy.<br />
We agreed to work together towards an aggregate wage outcome<br />
in the order of 5% for 1991-92. The Government's view,<br />
published in the Budget papers, is that the actual figure<br />
will come out closer to<br />
If it is higher, it will be because enterprise bargaining,<br />
based on achieved productivity, has moved faster and further<br />
than we have anticipated, making our industries more<br />
competitive, helping cement in lower inflation by providing<br />
a productivity dividend to fund higher wages, and lowering<br />
the Budget deficit through increased tax revenues.<br />
We also reached an understanding on superannuation.<br />
In the Budget we announced that as part of our retirement<br />
incomes policy, the Goverrnent would legislate for the<br />
phased implementation of a. minimum level of employer<br />
superannuation support of 9% by the year 2000.<br />
From July 1 1992, subject to a threshold, the minimum level<br />
will be 5% of ordinary time earnings for employees where the<br />
payroll is more than S500,000, and 3% for other employees.<br />
We are determined to ensure retirement income security for<br />
all Australians. It is art axiom of the Government's Social<br />
Justice strategy that we manage the long term effects of our<br />
ageing population, that wet start paying now so that we can<br />
preserve our standard of living in the future.<br />
Ladies and Gentlemen,<br />
Not the least striking achievement of this Budget is the way<br />
in which it serves the wider social purposes of this<br />
Government, firmly in the tradition of its eight<br />
predecessors. There could be no better testimony to the<br />
fundamental strength of our achievements over the past eight<br />
years than the fact that we are able to do this in a time of<br />
recession. Again, I emphasise that new spending has been<br />
fully offset by savings.<br />
The Budget advances our Social Justice Strategy in a number<br />
of very practical ways.<br />
First, we are increasing expenditure on labour market and<br />
training programs by 50 per cent in real terms. in addition<br />
about $ 420 million has been allocated to TAFE including<br />
million in 1991-92 for extra TAFE places. 817 </p>
<p>As well as providing a safety net for people directly<br />
affected by the downturn, these measures are designed to<br />
strengthen the skills of job-seekers and workers and to<br />
ensure that skill shortages do not emerge during the<br />
recovery. Improvement of skill levels is of direct benef it to business<br />
as we embark on the recovery. We must, and we will., avoid<br />
the serious shortages of skills that were evident following<br />
the 1982-83 recession.<br />
Second, we are adjusting Medicare to make absolutely sure<br />
that this great reform in the Australian health care system<br />
is irreversibly established as part of the Australitan way of<br />
life. The measures being introduced are based on the findings of<br />
the National Health Strategy. They adjust Medicare<br />
arrangements to promote better use of medical services,<br />
higher quality of care and more efficient use of health<br />
resources. At the sane time, we have improved protection<br />
for families from high out of pocket costs for private<br />
medical services.<br />
Third, this Budget builds upon the Government's landmark<br />
reform in assistance to low income families the Family<br />
Allowance Supplement.<br />
This Budget extends that achievement by making the family<br />
support system much simpler and more consistent; by<br />
increasing assistance to low and moderate income families;<br />
and delivering greater assistance to the primary carer who<br />
is, in most cases, of course, the mother.<br />
And we have moved to change the assets test arrangements to<br />
help those families, particularly in rural Australia, who<br />
are asset rich but cash poor.<br />
These new arrangements are a further gain to the social wage<br />
which is the other side of the coin to the wage restraint<br />
demonstrated by the union movement over the past eight<br />
years. Fourth, the Budget starts to deliver on one of th~ e most<br />
urgent social and economic challenges of the 1990s to make<br />
our cities work better. In co-operation with the States, we<br />
must start to improve people's access to work, services and<br />
education through better transport links, more affordable<br />
and appropriate housing, and a cleaner urban env~ ronnent.<br />
Assistance of up to S812 million over five years will be<br />
provided to State and Territory Governments to help them<br />
undertake a range of programs to improve the quality of life<br />
in urban areas. I must emphasise that the ultimate success<br />
of the Better Cities Program will depend on the cooperation<br />
of all levels of government. The involvement of the private<br />
sector is crucial to its success. That co-operation, in<br />
itself, is a tremendous challenge for us all.<br />
818 </p>
<p>In addition to Better Cities, t: he establishment in this<br />
Budget of the Commonwealth EnviLronment Protection Agency<br />
rep rsnts another big step forward in this Governmn'<br />
cocr for the whole environment the urban as well as the<br />
natural environment.<br />
Initially, the $ 8.5 million allocation in 1991-92 will<br />
improve Commonwealth environment protection activities.<br />
However, by early next year we hope to have agreement on<br />
Commonwealth-State administrative arrangements, through the<br />
Intergovernmental Agreement on. the Environment. In this<br />
way, truly nAtñ nnal standards for air, water and land<br />
pollution can be established.<br />
I know that business is anxious that there should be more<br />
certainty, simplicity and uniformity in the areas of<br />
environmental assessment and pollution standards. National<br />
action is the only way to achiLeve them.<br />
Ladies and Gentlemen<br />
I welcome the opportunity this occasion affords to place the<br />
Budget in the context of the agenda for the nation set out<br />
in the Financial Review articles of last week.<br />
I believe the Budget, as part. of the wide-ranging process of<br />
reform and renewal we have undertaken, makes a valuable<br />
contribution towards meeting the challenges those articles<br />
posed, above all the challencle of making the Australian<br />
economy more open and more competitive.<br />
There is, however, one matter of fundamental importance on<br />
which I must take issue with the Financial Review.<br />
It is about the future of the Accord.<br />
The Review said:<br />
" The accord process has been a remarkably long-lived<br />
experiment, given the fate of similar social contracts<br />
elsewhere. But just as its time had come in the early<br />
1980s, its demise as a formal structure is close, and<br />
it should be buried with due honour."-<br />
Now, Ladies and Gentlemen, the Financial Review is<br />
absolutely correct in describing the accord as a pnaes.<br />
It is precisely because it has been an evolving process a<br />
process of consultation and agreement between Government and<br />
unions that it has endured, with such unique success. 819 </p>
<p>The Financial Review acknowledged:<br />
" The accord's gradualism delivered commitment to a<br />
number of important changes in Australia an attack<br />
from within on Australia's moribund awards, a break<br />
with the wage indexation fixation of the past, a<br />
reinvigorated assessment of the importance of<br />
productivity, and the elevation of retirement incomes<br />
and training as factors which will see the country cope<br />
better into the next century."<br />
Nevertheless, the Financial Review, having come to praise<br />
the Accord, proceeded to bury it.<br />
Specifically, it asserted that as we move towards wage<br />
decentralisation, the Accord will become irrelevant.<br />
On the contrary, I maintain that a smooth transition<br />
absolutely requires the Accord, if we are to avoid needless<br />
confrontation and disruption, and the re-emergence of<br />
inflationary pressures.<br />
As part of the agreement finalised last week, the ACTiJ<br />
committed itself, in 1992-93 and future years, to work<br />
towards wages outcomes consistent with keeping Australia's<br />
inflation at levels comparable with those of our major<br />
trading partners.<br />
I believe the Agreement reached with the ACTU last Thursday,<br />
as part * of the Accord process, meets the challenges we face<br />
today. In doing so it demonstrates the continuing<br />
relevance, the importance, and the vigour of the Accord, and<br />
the constructive, cooperative, attitudes it embodies. The<br />
Accord process is as vital as ever. Its vitality is as<br />
strong as ever.<br />
Mr Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen<br />
Let me sum up. The 1991-92 Budget is a Budget for recovery,<br />
for responsibility, for reform. It is a vital part of the<br />
whole process of national reconstruction and renewal which<br />
we have undertaken in this first year of the last decade of'<br />
the 20th Century, to equip Australia to enter the<br />
21st Century with a strong, competitive economy as the<br />
essential foundation for our national goals of a<br />
progressive, enlightened, just society, uniquely diverse.<br />
but unshakably united. It is both a Budget for the times<br />
and a Budget for the future.<br />
