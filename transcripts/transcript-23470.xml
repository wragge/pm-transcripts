    <content><![CDATA[<p>In recent weeks, as Iâve met people across Australia and read their letters and emails, Iâve been asked why do we need to make big changes in this Budget?</p>
<p>Itâs a fair question.</p>
<p>My answer is that you canât fix the economy without fixing the Budget.</p>
<p>A strong Budget is the foundation for a strong country.Â  This Budget is part of the Governmentâs Economic Action Strategy to build a stronger, more prosperous economy for a safe and secure Australia.</p>
<p>We must again live within our means â as we did in the Howard years â because thatâs the foundation for future prosperity.</p>
<p>Since then, as you know, the previous Labor government ran up five record deficits.Â  Labor also left $123 billion in deficits for coming years and $667 billion in projected debt.</p>
<p>The interest payments alone are around $1 billion every month â thatâs dead money that could have been better spent on better services â and if we do nothing it will just get worse.</p>
<p>Beyond a certain point, you donât control debt; debt controls you.</p>
<p>So, I want our country to be back in control of our destiny.Â  When a country has a strong economy there is less pressure on families and more opportunities for small businesses to create well-paying jobs.</p>
<p>At the election, you the people said that you wanted a government that would fix the Budget and strengthen the economy and that is exactly what we are doing.</p>
<p>The Budget shouldnât be about how much will be in our pockets today or tomorrow, it should be about our country and its future â and our ability to sustain for the long term important services and the social security net that is so important.</p>
<p>By all of us chipping in â we can chip away at this legacy of debt.</p>
<p>Sharing the burden makes it lighter for all of us.</p>
<p>So, the Government will do the right thing by Australia in this Budget â so that we can all share in the jobs and the prosperity that should follow.</p>
