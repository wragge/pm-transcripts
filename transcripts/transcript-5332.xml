ELECTORATE TALK<br />
Since the end of World War II, the International Law of the<br />
Sea has seen great developments. The developments continue.<br />
The Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea<br />
has just completed its ninth session. A further session<br />
is scheduled later this year.<br />
It is important that Australia effectively participate in<br />
these developments, nationally as well as internationally.<br />
Technological advances have given access to great areas of<br />
the seas and the seabed beneath. The demand for sea and<br />
seabed resources for oil, and the protein that fish<br />
provides has increased sharply.<br />
The protection of the marine environment has been seen to be<br />
increasingly important.<br />
In 1953 Australia declared its sovereign rights over its<br />
continental shelf, the undersea extension of its land mass<br />
stretching out to the deep ocean floor.<br />
In November last year, the Australian Government decided in the<br />
context of emerging internationa. law, to declare a 200 nautical<br />
mile fishing zone around our coast. All fishing activities<br />
in these waters must now be licenced by Australia law.<br />
However, the national debate on how to administer the offshore<br />
area both the three mile territorial sea and beyond that<br />
area has been drawn out and at times stormy. Arrangements<br />
with the States enabled our offshore oil industry to get under<br />
way. A basic issue remained. Whether the Commonwealth had,<br />
and should exercise, powers of complete control of the offshore<br />
area, right into low water. mark, even to the point of every<br />
wharf and jetty that juts into the sea ' round Australia.<br />
In 1973, the Labor Government had legislation passed declaring<br />
not only'the . sovereign rights of the Commonwealth over the<br />
continental shelf, but also Commonwealth sovereignty over the<br />
territorial sea, where State Governments had long exercised<br />
rights and responsibilities.<br />
In 1975, the High Court upheld this Act against<br />
constitutional challenge.<br />
T he question which faced my Government was how to establish<br />
workable arrangements that would ensure effective and harmonious<br />
administration of the offshore area, and a fair sharing of<br />
the nation's offshore resources. </p>
<p>-2-<br />
When the Labor Government introduced the 1973 legislation<br />
its intention was to deny revenue from these resources<br />
to the States.<br />
The Commonwealth could have ended up owning every-jetty and<br />
quay in the country as part of a grab for these offshore<br />
resources. Instead, my Government chose to explore with the States and with<br />
the Northern Territory the question of conferring on them a<br />
proper role and appropriate rights over the offshore resources.<br />
This issue was raised in discussions with the Premiers some<br />
three years ago.<br />
Federal/ State consultative bodies-were used fully: the<br />
Australian Minerals and Energy Council, the Australian Fisherie s<br />
Council, the Marine and Ports Council of Australia, the<br />
Australian Environment Council and the Council of Nature<br />
Conservation Ministers. The Standing Committee of<br />
Attorneys-General drew up legal ways and means of implementing<br />
the proposed arrangements.<br />
Four days ago I was most pleased to introduce into the Parliament<br />
the Coastal Waters ( State Powers) Bill as the first item in<br />
a legislative package to which all State Governments have<br />
agreed. This legislation embodies a practical solution to an issue that<br />
has bedevilled State/ Federal relationships for more than a<br />
decade. The package which is now going through the Parliament<br />
is the result of frankness, goodwill and great effort by<br />
Commonwealth and State Ministers and officials ' over a long<br />
period. * It is in accordance with the Government policy<br />
of co-operative Federalism.<br />
When this legislation is in force, joint Commonwealth-State'<br />
authorities will be established for offshore petroleum mining<br />
on the continental shelf and for fishing to , the outer edge of<br />
the 200 mile fishing zone.<br />
We have given the States a role where constitutionally they<br />
could have been completely excluded.<br />
General responsibility for the territorial si a will revert to<br />
the States, but mining royalties are to be shared, both outside<br />
and inside the territorial sea. The Commonwealth will have<br />
increased control over offshore oil fields outside the<br />
territorial sea.<br />
The Commonwealth will remain fully able to discharge its<br />
international and national responsibilities over all the offshore<br />
area. Its subsisting sovereignty will continue to exist.<br />
The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act 1957 will continue to be<br />
applicable to the whole reef region.<br />
I, would like to register my regret at the attitude taken in the*<br />
Parliament by the Opposition Spokesman for Minerals and Energy,<br />
mr. Paul Keating, who has attacked both the legislation and the<br />
State Governments which have agreed to it and which support it.<br />
/ 3 </p>
<p>3-<br />
Although two of these Governments, in his own State of<br />
New South Wales and in Tasmania are ALP Governments,<br />
Mr. Keating declared " shame on them" while I was<br />
introducing the Coastal Waters legislation.<br />
It was a " great sell out" he said. Subsequently he<br />
accused these two Labor States of breaking ALP policy,<br />
saying that this reflected no credit on them.<br />
I can only re-state that the Commonwealth will continue to<br />
follow its policy of restraint and responsibility in its<br />
negotiations with the States.<br />
There is no substitute for consultation, co-operation,<br />
discussion and negotiation. Nor should there be.<br />
The Federal system has served Australia well for 80 years<br />
providing the nation with local government for local issues,<br />
State Government for State issues, and national government<br />
to deal with national issues and international issues.<br />
