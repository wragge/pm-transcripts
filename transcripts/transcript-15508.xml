    <content><![CDATA[<p>I will be travelling to Bali, Indonesia, on Friday 27 July to meet President Yudhoyono and open the Australia-Bali Memorial Eye Centre.  I will also open the new Australian Consulate, which serves over 100,000 Australians who visit Bali each year.</p>
<p>Indonesia is a very important partner for Australia not least because of our close proximity, strong political, security and economic ties and extensive people-to-people links.  </p>
<p>I look forward to reviewing with President Yudhoyono the full range of our existing cooperative activities, including in important areas such as security, counter-terrorism and transnational crime. </p>
<p>I also anticipate discussing the recommendation by trade ministers to conduct a feasibility study into a bilateral Free Trade Agreement.  Our trading relationship is an important one: Indonesia ranks 10th on our list of export destinations. I am keen to explore how it can be further strengthened.</p>
<p>The Australia-Bali Memorial Eye Centre is part of the Bali memorial assistance measures I announced in 2003.  It will provide quality eye care for Indonesians affected by blindness. </p>
