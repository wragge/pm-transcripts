PRESS STATEMENT NO. 194<br />
1 March 1974<br />
PRODUCTION OF SUPERPHOSPHATE REFERRED TO INDUSTRIES ASSISTANCE<br />
COMMISSION<br />
As a result of a reference sent to the Industries<br />
Assistance Commission by the Prime Minister, Mr. Whitlam, today,<br />
the Commission will examine the need for the continuation of<br />
the tariff on super-phosphate.<br />
Mr. Whitlam has asked the Commission to inquire into<br />
and report on whether assistance currently accorded the production<br />
of superphosphate in Australia should be continued and, if so,<br />
the nature and extent of such assistance.<br />
Mr. Whitlam emphasised that the reference to the Commission<br />
was limited to the question of assistance for Australian production<br />
and was not concerned with the question of a bounty for users of<br />
superphosphate. Mr. Whitlam said that at present imports of superphosphate<br />
into Australia attract a duty of just under 17 per cent under the<br />
General Tariff and jusqt under 6 per cent from preferential sources.<br />
The last full report on the protective requirements of this<br />
industry was that from the Tariff Board in December 1929, although<br />
it was included in the Board's 1972 report on General Rates of Duty<br />
which dealt with preferences. Mr. Whitlam said that it is<br />
appropriate for the Commission to review the assistance available<br />
to this manufacturing industry. It is also relevant that at<br />
present the Commission is inquiring into the protective needs of<br />
the industry producing nitrogenous fertilisers. </p>
<p>-2-<br />
The reference to the Commission on superphosphate<br />
production covers items 31.03.100 and 31.05.110 to the First<br />
Schedule of the Customs Tariff 1966-1973.<br />
