CABINET<br />
F 78/ 3<br />
PRIME MINISTER~<br />
FOR PRESS 17 JANUARY 1978<br />
AGREEMENT ON VICTORIAN PUBLIC HOSPITAL COSTS<br />
Commonwealth and State Government officials have agreed that<br />
Victorian Public Hospitals are disadvantaged as a result of<br />
the tentative budget previously proposed to meet the operating<br />
costs of the hospitals.<br />
In order to bring Victoria broadly into line with other States,<br />
the Commonwealth Government has adopted a recommendation that:<br />
the approved nett operating costs budget for Victorian public<br />
hospitals for 1977/ 78 be increased by $ 9.6 million to $ 458.6<br />
million. In accordance with the normal arrangements, half<br />
will come from the Commonwealth and half from the State.<br />
The revised budget has been accepted by the Victorian Government.<br />
The Prime Minister, Mr. Fraser, said today that he met With.<br />
the Victorian Premier, Mr. Hamer, on December 16th to discus!;<br />
the financial difficulties facing Victorian public hospitals.<br />
Mr. Fraser said: " We agreed that there should be an urgent<br />
meeting of Commonweal-th. and State officers to prepare a report<br />
to Governments on this matter on the basis that there were to<br />
be no forced reductions of staff or closure of wards as a<br />
result of budgetary cuts if this affected patient care.<br />
" Officers reported th ' at despite the cost containment measures<br />
taken by Victoria, the tentative budget previously proposed<br />
was insufficient-to permit the proper functioning of<br />
Victorian hospitals at an acceptable level of patient care.<br />
" The revised allocation will briing Victoria's 1977/ 78 hospital<br />
budget increase over last ya's spending to a level broadly<br />
consistent with that of the other States." </p>
