TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE lION P. J. KEATING, MP<br />
DOORSTOP, JOHN CURTIN HOUSE, CANBERRA, 4 DECEMBER 1992<br />
E OE PROOF COPY<br />
J: What do you think of Jeff Kennett's plan to put industrial relations on the<br />
Premiers' Conference agenda?<br />
PM: We are not superstitious, we'll have anything on the agenda they want on the<br />
agenda.<br />
1: Will you put it at the top now?<br />
PM: And we are quite happy to discuss these details with State governments, but<br />
we intend to go ahcad with our agcnda.<br />
J: What about John Fahcy's threat to boycott.<br />
PM: I didn't hear him say that, but boycott what?<br />
J: Boycott the Premiers' Conference.<br />
PM: John has got to decide whether he is a Prcmier or whether hc is a court jester<br />
and if hc wants to bc in the game that's wvhere the mecting is, he can be there<br />
if he wants to.<br />
J: Are you coniccrned about the atmosphere at thc Premiers' Confercnce given<br />
those comments?<br />
PM: It's all vcry good for John Fahey to say that it's not co-operative. Three<br />
weeks ago lie was standing in Sydney on his way to Acapulco attacking<br />
John Dawkins over loan raising from Victoria which had nothing to do with<br />
him whatsoever. lie has not behaved like Nick Greiner's behaved, hc's into<br />
; ZO/ TO'd 2000N VO: TT 7,6* 3Q* V : 131 </p>
<p>every argument around the place and then he wants to talk about cooperation.<br />
J: Given that are you concerned about the atmosphere of the Conference?<br />
PM: Not at all, no, no, not a bit.<br />
J: Prime Minister, how concerned are you that John Halfpen~ ny intends to<br />
continue industrial action in Victoria?<br />
PM: The. Commonwealth's legislation will give access to the federal jurisdiction<br />
for people registered under state awards and that will deal with the problem<br />
of the decline of the a wards system in Victoria, but it won't deal with a<br />
recalcitrant government in a position of conflict with its own employees.<br />
One will never solve those issues from Canberr a.<br />
J: So it's all right for unions to continue protest thcre whatever the effects on<br />
the federal economy?<br />
PM: No, no just get this right. If Mr Kenncett wants to decimate the school<br />
system and the hospital system he has to wear the public consequences of<br />
that. In just the samc way Nick Greiner had to wear it in schools in NSW,<br />
you can't expect magic and people to lay down in the face of a government<br />
which is just tak ing no heed of community attitudes.<br />
J: Mr Kennett says that Mr Halfpenny is giving you a two finger salute.<br />
PM: I haven't even spoken to Mr Halfpenny about this matter, not once, not at<br />
any stage. This is simply a mattcr that the Kennett government had no<br />
mandate whatsoever to destroy the awards system, none. This government<br />
had a very clear mandate in 1990 not just to maintain the award system but<br />
to maintain minimum rates, we are in there to protect that mandatc and if Mr<br />
Kennett wishes to go his way then the Commonwealth is just doing what I<br />
think is both sensible and reasonable to restore confidence in Victoria and to<br />
see our national recovery going. I noticed today in today's press that the<br />
Japanese economy is in negative growth for two quarters. There's the<br />
United States limping along, the second largcst economy negative growth,<br />
we are growing at two per cent, we are on the way. Jeff Kennett and his<br />
mates want to put us back.<br />
