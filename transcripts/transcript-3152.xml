TRANSCRIPT OF PRESS CONFERENC' BY THE PRI1' B MINISTEIR OF<br />
AUSTRALIA, MR. E. G. WiITLAI. AT MANILA INTERCONTIN-NTAL HOTEL<br />
FEBRUARY 12, 1974.<br />
The Prime Minister began by explaining the reason<br />
for the delayed start to the conference.<br />
Q: As you know, the scheme whereby Leyland's are seeking to<br />
6ncourage Filipino migrants and mechanics to Australia<br />

throughout this trip to South-East Asia but when this schemeA<br />
was first rmoted in the Australian press a few weeks ago<br />
it was noticeable that there was a very considerable degree.<br />
of continuing opposition even to a scheme like this.<br />
cIo wnotnindueirn gi f oypopuo sictouilodn gtihvaet uyso u shoamvee idtoe a fatchee n ino fy otuhre stand<br />
against racism in Australia and perhaps a little analysis<br />
of what do you think the reasons for these are?<br />
A: The policy of the Australian Government and of the<br />
Australian Labor Party which composes the Australian Governmt<br />
is quite clear. Our immigration policy depends principally<br />
on family union. We want to see that people who already ( i , Q<br />
live in Australia are helped to have their relatives<br />
their brothers or sisters or their sons and daughters<br />
their mothers or fathers, their fiancees come to i:<br />
Australia to join them. Subsidiary to this is the admission of<br />
skilled persons whose skills are undersupplied in Australia.<br />

by* Leyland's for skilled workers whom they can't find in<br />
Australia whom they believe they can find in the Philippines. J<br />
Officials from Australia are coming to the Philippines<br />
to interview and counsel the persons who are willing to come<br />
to Australia. The presentation of this issue by the company<br />
concerned caused some initial misunderstanding or concern<br />
because it appeared to be based on a form of employment<br />
common in Europe of guest workers. The Australian migration<br />
program does not provide for guest workers. It provides for<br />
people coming to Australia who wish to settle in Australia. </p>
<p>page 2<br />
Q: I believe you discussed the Asia Pacific<br />
grouping or forum with President Marcos.--vc u-<br />
Can you say what degree of common ground you found ith<br />
him-on your proposal for a wider grouping of Asia-Pacific<br />
powers and his for an Asia-Pacific Forum?<br />
A: We are in complete agreement as to the objectives here.<br />
We do realise, however, that there are some current<br />
aspects which mean that it cannot be fulfilled immediately<br />
and they are the fact that some countries.-in fact allthe<br />
Asean countries,.-I believe only the Asean countries<br />
do not have at this stage normal diplomatic relations<br />
with the People's Republic of China. There is also I L<br />
the impediment that there has been no peace settlement in<br />
Cambodia and at this stage the peace settlement in Vietnaml V'LU<br />
is not very effective.<br />
Q: We understand that yguve been asked for supplies of<br />
natural gas could you give us some details of that? I0C<br />
A: This is a commercial matter which a Filipino citizen,<br />
Mr. Borromeo, has been discussing wvith _ Mlpo. The present<br />
Australian Government has introduced and is pursuing<br />
the policy of permitting tho export of resources in two<br />
circumstances. The first is where those resources are surplus<br />
to Australian needs the 6ther is that they are being sold<br />
at appropriate prices considering the prices being paid<br />
for such resources in the world generally. Mr. Borromeo has<br />
discussed this matter not only with Ampol. but with the<br />
Australian Minister for Minerals and Energy, Mr. Connor.<br />
I, myself, will be discussing it with Mr. Connor in the next few<br />
days. </p>
<p>page 3<br />
Q: With the overtures that your Government is making<br />
toward Asia, w-hat do you anticipate as the future of your<br />
country toward the West, Europe and more particularly,<br />
to Britain?<br />
A: Australia has a political system and very largely, Ap'<br />
an economic and industrial and social system derived from<br />
Britain. Obviously, there would always be very close ties<br />
between Australia and Britain. Ncve:---. heless, those ties are no<br />
longer exclusive of ties with other countries, particularly<br />
counrtries which are closer to Australia geographically<br />
and * which are now more important to Australia economically.<br />
Britain herself realises this because Britain has<br />
chosen to as she is entitled to chose the European<br />
Economic Community rather than the Commonwealth of Nations<br />
as the focus of her economic thrust. Secondly, Britain has taken<br />
stops to equate Australian citizens,'<br />
who used to be British subjects, with citizens of other<br />
foreign countries.<br />
Q: Can you tell me is your Government concerned<br />
at the continuation of martial law in the Philippines<br />
and did you discuss this matter with President Marcos?<br />
A: I think you have been told by President Marcos<br />
that it was discussud there is no need for me to go ove g<br />
the ground again -it was discussed in the context that I~~<br />
this is one of the matters in the Philippines which aoss I<br />
great interest in Australia and therefore, is an ingredient<br />
in relations between the countries. r", t </p>
<p>page 4<br />
Q: ( Indistinct) what are the plans of Australia and<br />
the Philippines for the expanded Asia-Pacific Forum? * u<br />
A: I would think it is inevitable that all the countries of i<br />
Asean will establish normal diplomatic relations with the<br />
~ People's Republic of China.. The Philippines is one of the two<br />
(-Asean nations which reconises the Government of Generalisimo<br />
Chiang Kai Chek as thie Governfent of China. Australia<br />
* did so until December 1972 w-' hen my Government was elected.<br />
As I said before the elecuion-: we would transfer Australia's<br />
Embassy to China from Taipei to Peking. We did so. Within a<br />
couple of woee-' s. It was easier fcr Australia to do it<br />
than it is for the Philippines but nevertheless I am not<br />
making a statement concerning internal politics of any<br />
country; I am merely acknowlel: ging historic inevitabilityevery<br />
country in this region will acknowledge that the Government<br />
in Peking is the Government of Chi. na and the Government in<br />
Taipei is not the Government of China, One has to recognise<br />
either of those contending Governments as the Government of China.<br />
Each of them asserts that it" is the sole, legitimate Government<br />
of the whole of China, including the province of Taiwan. So<br />
one just has to chose one o: r the other. It is inevitable<br />
that it will be recognised. the Philippines<br />
has been involved in a great number of regional associations,<br />
many of them expired, others are in-their death throes....<br />
there was ASA, there was Maphilindo there was the old SEATO<br />
based on the Manila pact, there was ASPAC, and now there is<br />
Asean. And of all of them Asean is the only one which has a<br />
proper regional relevance, the only one which has a thriving<br />
future. None of the Asean countries suggests, Australia<br />
does not suggest, that Australishould join Asean.<br />
But the Asean Secretary--General have agreed with the Australian<br />
Government that there should cje. consultations on economic projects<br />
between Australia and Asoan coll-c; ively.<br />
, That was arranged in Bangkok a f ort_ c.-i ago<br />
and there will be representative of the Asean countries coming<br />
to Australia to pursue those arr. cements within the next few<br />
weeks. No country has done more than-._ the Philippines to<br />
recognise, to promote, the idea of regional arrangements.<br />
You have in the capital of the Philippines one of the most<br />
valuable organs for regional co-. operation the Asian ^ v<br />
Development Bank which I visited this afternoon, -Neertheess,<br />
it is quite clear we ought to have some arrangements as I said<br />
in my speech in the University of the Philippines yesterday. </p>
<p>Page<br />
Q: I met you before, sir, when I was in Australia in 1972<br />
and I asked your views about SEATO<br />
A: We were right, weren't we Romulo and<br />
Q: Is it the view of the Government of Australia that the membership<br />
of Peking is necessary for any form of a loose Asian forum<br />
to be valid?<br />
A: Any organisation covering the western Pacific would<br />
be inco plete grievously inadeq'uate if China were omitted<br />
from it.<br />
Q: What do you see would be the role of Australia in re1* aion<br />
to Asian affairs in the future?<br />
A: Historically, politically., socially Australia is Duropean<br />
Economically, however, and geographically it is increasingly<br />
or already part of Asian. Certainly of east Asia. and the<br />
western Pacific. Now, already, the relations between Australia<br />
jOr\ and all the countries of that region are expanding. The country<br />
that buys more from Australia than any other country buys is<br />
Z Japan; the country to which Japan sells than any other country<br />
-exct the United States is Australia. Therefore Japan is<br />
Australia's largest trading partner. But our trade with all<br />
' ountries of the region is growing and inevitably it is going to<br />
grow more. There are many other things, such as tourism, cultural<br />
exchanges, education ( one of the greatest forms of exchange<br />
it is quite seminal to our activities in this region). All these<br />
things inevitably mean that the relations between Australia and<br />
the countries of the western-Pacific are going to grow. / e need<br />
each other. We are all there.<br />
IQ, What about the political aspects, si., considering the fact<br />
G-U( v4qthat right now there seems to be some withdrawal of American<br />
presence in the Asian area. I wonder can Australia exert some<br />
influence in this matter? </p>
<p>-a page 6<br />
A: Australia has quite a considerable influence<br />
with most of t1countries in the area. It has quite a<br />
considerable influence-I expect, with the United States.<br />
America's interest in the area is changing in so far<br />
as she would no longer feel it appropriate to have<br />
armed forces on the mainland of Asia. America, however, is<br />
clearly the greatest naval and air power in the world.<br />
o Q: I believe, Prime Minister, that you raised with<br />
l( e UPresident Marcos the question of the continued<br />
C detention of Senator Aquino. Are you encouraged by<br />
this exchange to expect or hope that you will look<br />
forward to a just and fair trial in due course?<br />
( 1 Q , t.<br />
A: I raised this matter in the same context, for the<br />
same purpose as I raised the matter of the emergency.<br />
You have thoroughly questioned the President on this matter.<br />
I have got nothing more to say on it,<br />
Q: As the prime advocate of an Asian-Pacific Forum<br />
will your Government mount a diplomatic offensive<br />
to facilitate the recognition by the nations of Jr<br />
region of the People's Republic of China thereby<br />
hastening the formation of an Asian-Pacific Forum?<br />
0 y-* vcS v^ ) W<br />
A: You said I was the prime person; President Marcos was<br />
in fact the first. It is not my country's role<br />
to launch a diplomatic offensive in these matters.<br />
Bdt my views, and the vievs of my Government, are well<br />
known in all the countries of the region. There has been<br />
exchange of views during the lasu 16 days on the subject<br />
between me and heads. of Government in alaysia, Thailand,<br />
Laos, Burma, Singapore an: d nc.: the Philippines.<br />
There had been., of course, exch. n. iges of views on this subject<br />
with all of those men-othier than the new Prime Minister<br />
of Thailand and the Chairman of the Burmese Government<br />
neither of whom I had met before. Government<br />
showed its attitude very early by switching its recognition<br />
from one of the rival Governments to the other. New Zealand<br />
did so at exactly the same time. Japan did so a few months<br />
before. It is quite clear that the move is on. It was started<br />
by Canada tJese y. ars ago.<br />

<p>page 7<br />
Q: You have spent time today in Corregidor and Bataani; I wionder<br />
U could you commuent on your observations of the trip with the<br />
President as your tour guide.<br />
1 The first time I came here after the Wiar I was here<br />
in the last few,-months of the War at that time it w., as not<br />
yet safe to go to Corregidor and besides I did not have the<br />
transport at my individual disposal. But ten years ago<br />
when I first came hero as a Parliamentarian I wovnt over in the<br />
hydrofoil the first time I had ever been in one<br />
to Corregidor to see it. It is of very great significance<br />
in this region. The delay that the Filipino and American<br />
forces put up along Bataan*, and Corregidor was quite<br />
crucial to the preservation of Austra-.-lia, in the early months<br />
of the Pacific W~ ar before we could get under way and play<br />
our considerable role in turning the tide. It would be,<br />
theref ore, incomplcte for an Australiqn Prime Miinister to<br />
visit Manila without visiting Corregidor. On this occasion<br />
j. I appreciated very much that the President, the most<br />
decorated Filipino ex-serviceman, accompanied me. He<br />
also, of course, had several of his Ministers with him.<br />
The Secretaries of Finance, Defence, Communications and the<br />
Executive Secretary. It was-a pleasant occasion,<br />
a nostalgic one, but also one in which a considerable amount of<br />
business was discussed between us between his 11inisters<br />
and the President himself and me and mny senior advisers<br />
who have accompanied me. I have with me not only<br />
-our Ambassador in the Philippines but also the Deputy Secretaries<br />
of the Prime Minister's Department, Foreign Office, Overseas<br />
V Trade and Defence Departments.<br />
Q: What are your impressions of the Philippines? What has<br />
impressed you most about the country and the people?<br />
A: There are some pcrsonal . fecelings I have about the Philippines.<br />
Of course, Manila was the ' first foreign capital I<br />
ever visited and before that I had been in Leyte for a couple of<br />
months. Accordingly I have had ever since some interest in<br />
the political and economic developments* in this country.<br />
There are some other matters which make the Philippines of<br />
particular interest to Australia because it is one of the<br />
countries the only one which is not in the Commonwealthwhere<br />
English is spoken everywhere. Also, I don't stress this<br />
matter, but it is the only country in the region<br />
other than New Zealand which is prcfess * edly Christian.<br />
The other thing I would point out, as I did at the university<br />
yesterday, is that it is high time there -were more direct<br />
links between these countries which have significant links in<br />
common than have hitherto obtained passing, as those have<br />
hitherto, principally through-the United States.* </p>
