Distinguished Guests<br />
Three years ago this site was open land.<br />
Fifteen months ago I came to Port Adelaide to open what had<br />
become a brand-new facility for the construction of<br />
Australia's planned class of submarines.<br />
It is satisfying indeed to come back today and to see the<br />
progress which you have made since then and in particular<br />
to be present at the genesis of this boat, the Farncomb.<br />
It is a special pleasure to be joined on this occasion by<br />
Mrs Jean Farncomb, the widow of Rear Admiral Farncomb whose<br />
lifetime of service in the Royal Australian Navy is<br />
commemorated in this vessel.<br />
on thi: 3 occasion of such importance to the Royal Australian<br />
Navy, it is right that I should express on behalf of us all,<br />
our pride in the skill that our service men and women have<br />
shown in recent months in the Gulf. They have done honour<br />
to themaselves, to their service, and to the nation. We in<br />
turn honour them, and we rejoice with them, and with their<br />
families, that they have been spared casualties. As I said<br />
yesterday, we hope that we can welcome them all safely home<br />
soon. A great deal is spoken about defence self-reliance. Today,<br />
with this submarine and with this construction project, we<br />
see the proof of Australia's capacity to provide, as never<br />
before, for its own defence.<br />
There are two important elements to this notion of selfreliance.<br />
