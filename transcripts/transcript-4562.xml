MINISTR CAH4JFi4A<br />
FOR PRESS 27 NOVEM4BER, 1977<br />
LAUNCESTON~ LIBERAL PARTY BAR-B-QUE<br />
it is great to be in Tasmania. Tasmania always receives special.<br />
attention from this government. The Tasmanian Liberal team in.<br />
the House is the best team that Tasmania has ever had in<br />
the Federal Parliament. I know. from sitting in. the House at<br />
Question Time just how effectively Kevin Newman in the ' nity<br />
Max Burr, Ray Groom, Bruce Goodluck and 1-sichael Hodgmnan from<br />
Backbench pursue Tasmania's interests.<br />
our economy is now on~ the move. After two years hard work, we hav04<br />
managed to regain control of expenciture, to moderate wage increases<br />
to* reduce industrial disputes-. Inflation has been reduced to9%<br />
0 and it's falling, interest rates are falling and investment is.<br />
up. We are ready to move into a new era of development with<br />
$ 6 Billion of investment. From February-unemployment will fal: l'<br />
and ) ieep falling.<br />
We have provided wide ranging tax cuts, historic tax reforms which<br />
have meant that $ 3,300 million in personal tax will be sav-d. in. our:-<br />
first two budgets. A further $ 1,000 million bar, been saved by<br />
business in that time. By putting money directly into the-hands of<br />
consumers, our Februatry tax cuts will create more jobs, because.. as<br />
demand rises, employers are encouraged to hire more people, and.<br />
by reducing-ma ginal tax rates, incentive and production are increase<br />
Our February tax cuts will* inject an extra $ 26.7 million a week into<br />
the economy. Almost a quarter of a million low income earners,<br />
including tens of thousands of pensioners, now paying tax will pay<br />
no tax at all, in lime with th~ e government's general policy of.<br />
helping those in need. This will increase consumer demand and<br />
business activity. This will. create more jobs it ; will not<br />
boost inflation because it is a tax. cut, not a wage* rise.<br />
Labor wants to do away with the F3ebruary tax cuts; tax. cuts which<br />
will create more jobs; and refuses to cow-wit itself to tax:<br />
indexation. To pay for their abolition of payroll tax, they-have<br />
to raise $ 850 million in the first half of 1978, * and $ 1900 million<br />
in 1978/ 79.<br />
They have said that they will pay for this by repealing our-February,<br />
tax cuts; even then~ they would have to raise: an additional $ 880 mill:,<br />
That's why the ALP won't commit themselvea on tax indexationk.<br />
Mr WMitlam would have to take aw~ ay at least $ 6 u week from the man<br />
on average earnings-Labor would end the jobs that the tax cuts<br />
will bring and rip off $ 2,750 million from the people of Australia.<br />
Mr Dunstan knows that the abolition of payroll tax won't increase<br />
employment. He's said that " The Government has already tried<br />
a payroll tax remission scheme and found that it does not create<br />
employment". 2 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
A recent survey of large employers revealed that not one<br />
company surveyed was prepared to forecast any inorease in their<br />
own employment levels if payroll tax were abolished. Trhe survey<br />
showed that, on the contrary, employers considered M-Whitlan<br />
and Mr Hlawke's policy of full wage indexation would make the<br />
capacity of business to create new jobs worse not better.<br />
Labor's scheme would hurt the self-employed, and many small<br />
businessmen who are already ex,-empt from payroll tax but.. w6uld<br />
be lumbered with higher wage costs and higher personal tax"<br />
conunitments. It would harm all Australians.<br />
Labor have -no coherent economic policy each on4e of Mr Whitlam's<br />
statements on tax indexation contradicts the statement be<br />
made last. Mr Willis and Mr Hayden contradicted one another0<br />
and the L~ eader of the opposition. Mrx Jjurford -the Shadow Treasur:.<br />
has to find out what Labor's latest position on tax indexation<br />
is from the newspapers.<br />
On wage indexation, Labor i. s no less' disorganised in its policy0<br />
speech. Mr Whitlam said Labor would "; cestore integrity to the<br />
wage indexation guidelines". This mean! 5 that he was conwitted<br />
to backing unions' claims for maximum wage increases.<br />
Only . a few houirs aftez-AMr Whitlamla policy speech, Mr Hayden said<br />
that Mx Witlam's formula meant support for full wage index~ Ation,<br />
but only for people on less than average weeicly earnings.<br />
Mr Wbitlam replied that Labor wanted full wage indexation for<br />
everyone,. and Mr ) 3ayden confessed he night be wrong: " I feel<br />
I'm on shaky ground", he said. He said questions on wage<br />
indexation should be directed to Mr Willis; " I work in the<br />
economic area" " It's a demarcation problem". Mr Witlam directed<br />
his press secretary to say: " There was no contradiction" between<br />
himself and -Mr Hayden on wnage indexatio". </p>
<p>They don't care how many people are thrown out-of work as a<br />
result of excessive wage demands. Mr Ilayden is abdicating<br />
responsibility for wages policy despite the fact -that he has<br />
said that unreasonable wage demands have caused serious<br />
economic difficulties.<br />
Blut that' s all forgotten when th * e unions crack the whip&gt;. The<br />
Labor Party could do nothing without the agreement of the trade<br />
union movement. Mzi Hawke admitted this on Friday when he<br />
announced that Labor would have to discuss the issue of wage<br />
indexation " with the trade union movement". Mir Hawke wouldn't<br />
try that sort of thing on this Government he knows that we won't<br />
abdicate our responsibilities.<br />
Labor's abdication on economic policy its surrender of one of<br />
the main responsibilities of Government to the unions is clear.<br />
-It happened between 1972 and 1975<br />
They would do it all over again<br />
Only a Liberal Government has no vested interest in kow-towing<br />
to trade unions. We have passed laws which bring a creater<br />
measure of fairness and commonsense to indust-rial relations in<br />
th-is country. Thes~ e laws. give more protection to individual<br />
unionists and to the general publi,, tfho have been so-outrageously<br />
harmed by industrial' disruption in the past. These laws give<br />
rank and file xuiionists the ochan1ce to have-their voices heard in<br />
the way their unions are run.<br />
We have made secret postal ballots compulsory for union OaLeotons.<br />
We have set up the Industrial Reations tureau to protect the<br />
public interest and to act as an industrial ombudiuman.. Unions are<br />
now required to report annually on their financial affairs to their<br />
members. We are protecting individuals against being forced to joi<br />
unions against their will.. E~ arlier tliis month, furthber amendments<br />
were made to thie Conciliation and Arbitration Act which. axe of<br />
particular relevance to Tasmania. The Industrial Court can now.<br />
partially or fully dezeqister a union if it hinders or interfereS,<br />
with overseas or interstate trade a-nd comnmerce.; or if it h-inders.<br />
or intarfe-res with any service provided by the Commonwealth, a State<br />
or any Govexnment Authocrity,.<br />
All this legislation is now in force, protecting Tasmania against<br />
industrial' disruption whbicb might cut off thid State. from i-he<br />
mainland, or cut off vital supplies from or to the mainlaud.<br />
The Labor Party would repeal all the industrial leg islation. . that<br />
protects individuals and protects the public interest. T'hey<br />
would unleash the industrial. disputes that cost the country 6.2<br />
million working days in 1974. Only a Liberal Government can give<br />
Tasmania the protection from industrial disruption which this State<br />
needs. I now wish to mention the special initiatives which the Government<br />
has intzoduced to help Tasmania.<br />
The freight equalisation scheme, both -north-bound and south-bound,<br />
is vital to Tasmania, for it reniioves Tasmania ' s freight disadvantagi<br />
It will cost the Goverrnent $ 23 million this financial yeaIr.<br />
The APPM multi-million dollar project at Blurnie would not have </p>
<p>occurred except for this scheme ( and thbe Goverrnent' a investment<br />
allowance).<br />
The Government has also contr~ ibuted over $ 20 million towards the<br />
cost of the Launceston G~ neral Hospital. We have also<br />
contributed a further $ 20 million to assist the Tasmanian Railways.<br />
The Maritime College in Launiceston will conumence construction in<br />
the Pew year.<br />
The Goveriiment has always given a high priority to rural industry<br />
throughout Australia. We have given considerable assistance to<br />
the beef industry by obtaining increased acodess to overseas<br />
mrkets, by ending the Labor Party I meat inspection. charge-, by<br />
providing a cash subsidy to beef. growers for disease control<br />
measures and spayig measures, by investigating a better marketing<br />
system for beef and by spending very large sums indeed in the<br />
cauipaign to eradicate brucellosis and tuberculosis in cattle.<br />
The Government has also helped the dairying industry -by extendinm<br />
underwriting arrangements and helping to Increase overseas markeV<br />
particularly the Japanese cheese market. we have-helped the wool<br />
industry by raising thbe minimum reserve price and guaranteeing that<br />
higher minim-= price for two years. We have also promised, in<br />
co-operation with the Iiustzralian Wool Council and the Australiato<br />
Wool Industry conference, to investigate ways of improving theW<br />
wool marketing system.<br />
in the light of the Callaghan Report, which we omissioned,<br />
Senator Cotton, and X~ evin' Newman have announced a ten-point plan<br />
to implement major recommendations of that report. We are<br />
studying as a matter of urgency the feasibility-of a pilot<br />
induatkial etate in the La unceston area..<br />
Senator Carrick, the Minister for Education, is examining ways<br />
of establishing more specialist courses of national interest fo@<br />
the Tasmtanian College of Advanced Education at Launceston. The<br />
* Goverrnent'policy of-buyi~ ng Australian. goods. will be applied to<br />
the fullest possible extent in Tasmania.<br />
The Minister for Defence, Jim Killen, has commenced a reiwof@<br />
defenace activities in Tasmania. The Minister for Productivity,<br />
Ian Macphee, is undertaking a review of the Launceston Preoision<br />
* Tool Annexe with a View to expanding its operations. The<br />
Government is also examining ways to help the forestry, f ishing<br />
and tourist industries. the new Decentralisation Assistance<br />
Board will examine Tasmanian projects, such as a new convention<br />
centre for La-unceston, with a view to Commonwealth financial<br />
assistance. The Public Service Board will report to me on the scope available<br />
for relocation of commonwealth activities in Tasmania. The Board<br />
will particularly examine the feasibility of accelerating the<br />
transfer of the Antarctic Division to Kingston. The Secretariat<br />
of the Advisory Council on Intergovernmental. Relations has of<br />
course already been established in Hobart. </p>
<p>in my policy speech last week, I also outlined rnmerous other<br />
programmnes which will be of assistance to Tasmanians. The<br />
Niational Water Resources Programmne will assist town and rural<br />
water supplies throughout Australia. Our progralmmes to boost<br />
the standards of public urban transport will also helpfrTasmanians.<br />
What would Labor do for Tasmania?<br />
The freight equalisation scheme is thxeatened by Labor. Mr Burford<br />
said in H~ obart on 24* June 1976 that the freight equalisation scheme<br />
was not effective. This extraordinary statement shows how much<br />
Labor iscompletely out of touch with the needs of Tasmanians.<br />
Under Labor, the " PMI project at Burnie would be threatened. The<br />
economicsof that project are dependent on the continuation of the<br />
freight equalisation. scheme and the investment allowance. Under<br />
Labor, both these subsidies may be removed.<br />
Under Labor, Tasmania could not expect any decentralisation<br />
assistance. Labor would redirect such funds; to mainland " growth<br />
centres". The Tasmanian textiles industry would be threat-ened. too.<br />
The vital protection which we ha%-e given and maintained, Labor<br />
would remove. In. July, Mr Whitlaii said to the, National Press<br />
club: " There is no doubt that Australian industry is excessively<br />
protected tbat is the basic trouble with our manufacturig<br />
industry."<br />
Th-is month, Senator Wriedt said at Rockhampton ( on 6 November),<br />
0 Labor would4 reduce tariffs ' immuediately and he made it clear this<br />
would proceed regardless of', the adverse effects this would have on<br />
unemployment The position is clear-Labor would again ig-nore the Tasmanan<br />
0 State Government and the interests of* a11 Tasmaniafla<br />
A Liberal Government is the best Government for Tasmania -no<br />
Government has done more for Tasmanians.<br />
A Liberal Government is thd best Government for all Australians<br />
we are doing the job we were elected to do, and we will keep on.-<br />
doingj it. </p>
