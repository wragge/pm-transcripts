PRIME MINISTER<br />
BOOST FOR AUSTRALIA'S FOOD EXPORT DRIVE<br />
I am pleased to announce the appointment of Mrs Fay McGuigan to the Prime<br />
Minister's Supermarket to Asia Council.<br />
Mrs McGuigan is a worthy addition to the Council, which was established in<br />
September to remove barriers to greater exports and increase Australia's<br />
competitiveness and marketing of food products in Asian markets.<br />
Mrs McGuigan has been the export manager of McGuigan Brothers Wines Limited for<br />
the last 10 years. During her tenure with the company she gained an excellent<br />
reputation in developing export markets from scratch. She negotiated export<br />
agreements in 28 countries and built export sales for her company from nothing into a<br />
business of$ 16 million a year.<br />
These valuable skills ideally lend themselves to the objectives of the Council, which<br />
will benefit from her experience when it next meets on Wednesday 18 December 1996.<br />
17 December 1996 </p>
