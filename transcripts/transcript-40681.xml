    <content><![CDATA[<p>I will host Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan for a working meeting in Sydney on 14 January.</p>
<p>This will be an excellent opportunity to discuss our countries’ close trade, defence and people-to-people links. I also look forward to building on my personal friendship with the Prime Minister.</p>
<p>Japan has been an important friend to Australia for many decades. We are united as friends and partners by our common values. A strong Australia-Japan relationship delivers tangible benefits to the people of both nations.</p>
<p>We are committed to advancing our economic, investment and trade relationship, our defence and security cooperation, and our common commitment to a secure and prosperous region.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Abe and his wife, Mrs Akie Abe, will be accompanied by a delegation of Japanese business leaders. Lucy and I look forward to welcoming them to Australia.</p>
