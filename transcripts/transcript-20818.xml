    <content><![CDATA[<p>Thank you very much General, Leader of the Opposition, Colonel Frewen, Assistant Commissioner Ben McDevitt, Commissioner Mick Keelty of the Australian Federal Police, men and women of the Australian Defence Force and of the Australian Federal Police.</p>
<p> I want on behalf of the Australian Government and the Australian people to thank you for your professional commitment that will take you to the Solomon Islands, to say that you have the very strong support and the total good wishes of the Australian community for what you are doing. We are responding to a very heartfelt request from a small country in our region that needs our help so that it doesn';t become a failed state and fall further into disorder and disorganisation, posing in time not only a threat to the safety and wellbeing of its own citizens, but potentially the whole region, which is so important to Australia.</p>
<p>Any mission like this involves an element of danger, but you have the great advantage of going superbly trained. You are going in sufficiently large numbers to deliver the maximum conditions of safety and security, and that is a very deliberate decision by the Government, on the advice of the defence forces and the Australian Federal Police. You go on the invitation and with the full legal security and guarantee of that invitation from the government of the Solomon Islands, and importantly you';re also going in company with men and women from other countries in the region. It is a regional exercise properly titled in pidgin âOperation Helpem Fren';, and that is very much what this is about. It is Australia being a good Pacific neighbour and helping a very small country that really does need help and has cried out for assistance, and we';re going to provide it, as we should. Not only is it good that we do that for the wellbeing of the people of the Solomon Islands, but it';s also important we do it for the long-term stability and security of our whole region. And in the end, that';s in Australia';s interests, which is the most important thing in my mind and I know in the minds of all of you.</p>
<p>The only other things I want to say is good luck, I hope to have you all back safe and sound as soon as possible. The ADF personnel obviously a bit earlier than the police because it is essentially a policing operation, but we need to be there in sufficient numbers from the ADF and the police to guarantee a secure and a speedy establishment of law and order. And to the families that will be left behind, you will be very much in our thoughts. We will endeavour, both through the defence forces and in other ways, to provide you with support and encouragement in the time that your loved ones are away, just as we did in relation to our recent deployment in Iraq. I think it is tremendously important when men and women go abroad in uniform in the name of Australia, that those they leave behind and their families are looked after. It';s all part of preserving morale and sending a message that what you';re doing is appreciated.</p>
<p> So to all the men and women, good luck, godspeed, hope to see you soon. You';re going on a great mission with the total support of the Australian people. Thank you.</p>
