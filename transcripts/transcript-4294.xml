STANDARD OF OVERSEAS AIR TRAVEL<br />
Following a Public Service Board decision that st~ iff<br />
employed under the Public Service Act will travel overseas<br />
by air at the same standard as they travel in Australia,<br />

for overseas air travel to Commonwealth employees outside the<br />
Public Service Act staff of statutory authorities..)<br />
This will mean that the new standard will be economy class,<br />
except for staff with a salary equal to Level 1, Second<br />
Division or above. The revised standards are to apply to<br />
overseas travel commencing on or after 1 January 197 7.<br />
This decision is further evidence of the Government's.-<br />
intention to exercise restraint in all areas of public<br />
spending. oiol-epl-<br />
