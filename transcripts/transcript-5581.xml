FOR MEDIA FRIDAY, 8 MAY 1981 1J-<br />
PRIME MINISTER'S PRESS SECRETARY<br />
I express my disgust at the remarks made in the Parliament<br />
yesterday about my Press Secretary, David Barnett. Mr Barnett<br />
is a responsible and professional journalist and has carried<br />
out his duties in a proper and professional manner. The<br />
remarks made about him, if made outside the Parliament, would<br />
be libellous.<br />
The Opposition is abusing Parliament by making use of<br />
Parliamentary privilege for a cowardly attack of this kind.<br />
Anyone who knows David Barnett will condemn it. S ~ C~ L </p>
