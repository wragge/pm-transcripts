    <content><![CDATA[<p>At tomorrow's Council of Australian Governments meeting, I will be indicating the Commonwealth's willingness to fund a further 200 medical school places, additional to the 400 that I announced on 8 April this year. I will be putting this offer on the table in the hope that it will enable Premiers and Chief Ministers to agree to a comprehensive package of health workforce reforms that responds to the Productivity Commission's report into the health workforce released late last year.</p>
<p> Importantly, these places are also being offered on the condition that Premiers and Chief Ministers provide an effective guarantee that they will provide sufficient resources and undertake appropriate planning to ensure high quality clinical training placements and intern training for all of these new Commonwealth-funded places.</p>
<p> I am aware that some Premiers have indicated that this is their specific intent and that Victoria has backed this up with a public funding guarantee to cover an expanded clinical training commitment. I welcome this Victorian commitment.  However, some vaguer and less convincing guarantees have also been made by other states.</p>
<p> Given that Premiers have continued to pressure the Commonwealth for medical school places, this guarantee is of utmost importance to ensure the ongoing high standard of the Australian health workforce.</p>
<p>  If agreement is reached at COAG, this would bring the total new Commonwealth health workforce contribution to 600 new medical school places, at a cost to the Commonwealth of about $120 million over four years, as well as over 1000 new nursing places and 573 other health-related places.</p>
<p>  The new medical school places, would be implemented gradually, with some of the places commencing in 2007 and the full 600 becoming available by 2011.</p>
<p>  The places would be allocated to a range of universities across Australia. Eighty places would be allocated to the University of New England and the University of Newcastle to establish a new medical school at the University of New England, with a strong focus on rural medical practice.</p>
<p>  Thirty new places would be given to each of the University of Melbourne and Monash University, on top of the forty places earlier announced for Monash University's Gippsland campus, to address unmet rural medical workforce needs in northern Victoria. Monash and Melbourne Universities already have a well-established network of affiliated hospitals and primary care facilities in northern Victoria and this injection of places will further expand clinical opportunities in Bendigo, Shepparton, Mildura, Swan Hill, Echuca and Wangaratta.</p>
<p> Further information on the proposed allocation of these medical places across states,  and universities is at Attachment A.</p>
<p>To support these new medical school places, the Commonwealth would also be prepared to provide $48.5 million in new capital funding for a number of universities, subject to matching funding from State governments. This includes $15 million to James Cook University, $7.5 million to the University of Queensland and $3 million for a new joint programme at the University of New England and University of Newcastle.  The figure also includes capital funding of $18 million for Deakin University and $5 million for Monash University, which I announced on 8 April 2006 and which will be matched by the Victorian Government.</p>
<p> In addition, the Minister for Education, Science and Training has received a number of requests from universities to create some additional medical places through the conversion of existing student places in other disciplines. These requests are under consideration.</p>
<p> From 2000 to 2006, the number of commencing Commonwealth-funded medical places increased by more than 400 places.   The measures I am putting forward for COAG's consideration, in conjunction with other recent increases in places, would result in a 97 per cent increase in the number of commencing Commonwealth-funded medical school places from 2000 to 2011.</p>
<p> To further strengthen Australia's future health workforce, I am also pleased to announce today information on the allocation of over 1000 new nursing places (as detailed in Attachment B) and 573 other health-related places (as detailed in Attachment C) that will commence in 2007 as part of Backing Australia's Future. These places will be available across a range of disciplines including physiotherapy, pharmacy and dental studies.</p>
<p> Further announcements on the allocation of the remaining Backing Australia's Future places will be made by the Minister for Education Science and Training in coming weeks.</p>
<p> On 5 April 2006, as part of the Commonwealth's contribution to the COAG mental health package I announced additional mental health nursing places and clinical psychology places which will also contribute to the expansion of the health workforce.  Information on the allocation of 210 additional clinical psychology places is at Attachment D, and 431 additional mental health nursing places is at Attachment E.</p>
<p> The previously announced investments in Australia's health workforce, along with   my offer of additional medical school places, forms a significant part of the Commonwealth's contribution to a COAG package of health workforce reforms.</p>
<p> It is my great hope that Premiers and Chief Ministers will tomorrow provide the guarantees and agreement necessary to lay the groundwork for a sustainable health workforce, and I look forward to meeting with them to discuss these issues further.</p>
