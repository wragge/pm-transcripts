1973o NUCLEAR T7STING: AUSTRALIAN LETTER TO<br />
SECRETARY-ENERAL OF TI UNITED NATIONS<br />
~ The following is the text of a letter presented in New<br />
York early today to the Secretary-General of the United Nations,<br />
Dr Waldheim, by the Australian Ambassador and Permanent<br />
Renresentative to the UoN., Sir Laurence Mclntyre<br />
O " On instructions from my Government I have the honour<br />
to bring the following to Your Excellencyts attention.<br />
0The recent actions of the Governments of France and China<br />
in detonating nuclear devices in the atmosphere at Mururoa Atoll<br />
in the South Pacific and the Sinkiang region of North West China<br />
respectively have caused deep concern to the Government and people<br />
of Australia. The Government of Australia is compelled to state<br />
in addition that these actions reveal a regrettable disregard for<br />
the clearly exoressed views of the United Nations and its institutions<br />
The United Nations, through resolutions adopted by the<br />
General Assembly and the specialised agencies, has repeatedly<br />
f. oA/ </p>
<p>-2-<br />
condemned nuclear weapons testing in the atmosphere. The radioactive<br />
fallout from such tests creates hazards to the health of<br />
present and future generations and to the environment. Moreover,<br />
oppnosition to atmospheric testing by the preponderance of<br />
international opinion has found expression in multilateral<br />
instruments, including the Treaty Banning Nuclear Weapons Tests<br />
in the Atmosphere, in Outer Space and Under Water of 1963.<br />
Prohibition of atmospheric testing may fairly be claimed to have<br />
become a rule of customary international law.<br />
Australia has consistently advocated the negotiation<br />
and achievement of effective measures of comnlete and general<br />
disarmament and was one of the co-sonsors of a General Assembly<br />
resolution 2934A ( XXVIT), adonted on 29 November 1972 by an<br />
overwhelming majority, which called unon all nuclear weapons<br />
states to suspend nuclear weapons tests in all environments and<br />
called ucon the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament to<br />
give urgent consideration to the pressing need for the early<br />
conclusion of a Treaty banning all nuclear weapons tests.<br />
As recently as 23 May 1973, the World Health Assembly<br />
meeting in Geneva adopted a resolution which recognised that the<br />
fallout from nuclear weapons tests is an uncontrolled and<br />
unjustified addition to the radiation hazards to which mankind<br />
is excosed, condemned al? nuclear weanons testing which results<br />
in an increase in the level of ionizing radiation in the<br />
atmosohere and urged its immediate cessation. ./ 3 </p>
<p>-3-<br />
In respect of the program of nuclear testing by the<br />
Government of France it will be recalled that in 1963, following<br />
the develonment of strong onnosition, esnecially in Northern<br />
Africa, to the atmosnheric testing of nuclear weapons in the<br />
desert region of Algeria, that Government decided to move its<br />
nuclear weapons testing centre to the South Pacific Ocean.<br />
Since then, the Australian Government and the Governments<br />
of other countries in the South Pacific region and elsewhere have<br />
repeatedly expressed their aDnrehension and concern at the conduct<br />
of atmosnheric nuclear weapons tests in the region adjacent to them.<br />
The people of Australia are entitled to the rotection<br />
of Australia's territorial sovereignty, which they regard as<br />
clearly infringed by the continued denosit unon Australian soil<br />
without the consent of the Government of Australin, of radioactive<br />
substances from French nuclear tests in the Pacific, and they<br />
cannot be exnected to accent the nrogressive nollution of their<br />
environment which these successive atmosnheric exnlosions have<br />
been shown to cause,<br />
By a Note of 3 January 1973, the Australian Government<br />
sought an as-: urance from the French Government that no further<br />
tests would take place in the Southern Pacific region. No such<br />
assurance was given in the redly of the Government of France<br />
dated 7 February 1973. The Australian Government subsequently<br />
demonstrated its desire to resolve the situation amicably by<br />
seeking the assurance in ouestion through direct and detailed S./ 4 </p>
<p>-4-<br />
discussions with the Government of France. At the end of these<br />
discussions, however, it was evident that the French Government<br />
adhered to its firm intention to conduct further atmospheric<br />
nuclear weapons tests in the South Pacific region.<br />
It was against this background that the Australian<br />
Government on 9 May 1973 instituted proceeding. s in the<br />
International Court of Justice.<br />
On 22 June 1973, the Court ruled in favour of an<br />
Australian request for interim measures of protection pending<br />
its final judgment on the merits of the case. It indicated that<br />
the Governments of Australia and France should each of them ensure<br />
that no action of any kind be taken which might aggravate or<br />
extend the dispute submitL-ted to the Court or prejudice the rights<br />
of the other Darty in respect of the carrying out of whatever<br />
decision the Court may render in the case and, in particular, that<br />
the French Government shou~ ld avoid nuclear tests causing the<br />
deposit of radioactive fallout on Australian territory.<br />
Ir detonating a nuclear device on 22 July ( Australian<br />
time) the Government of France has openly disregarded the Court's<br />
ruling. The nuclear explosion carried out on that date will cause<br />
widesnread radioactive fallout. There is a virtual certainty that<br />
this will cause the denoosit of such fallout on Australian territory.<br />
On 22 July the Australian Embassy in Paris handed over a Note<br />
of -protest at the action of the Government of France. </p>
<p>The Government of the People's Republic of China has tested some<br />
nuclear weapons devices in the atmosphere since 1969. These<br />
tests are reported to have taken place at the Lop Nor test site<br />
in the Sinkiang region in north-west China. The Australian<br />
Government formally protested to the Government of China on<br />
April 1973, expressing Australia's strong opposition to the<br />
conduct of nuclear weapons tests, particularly in the atmospheie,<br />
and reaffirming the Australian Government's view that atmospheric<br />
nuclear weapons testing is contrary to international law.<br />
The Government of China exploded a nuclear weapons<br />
device in the atmosphere on 27 June 1973. The Australian<br />
Ambassador in Peking handed over on 29 June 1973 a further Note<br />
of protest, reiterating Australia's opposition to atmospheric<br />
nuclear weapons testing, and expressing deep regret that China ' had<br />
not taken full account of th-e views of the Australian Government<br />
and the world community as a whole, as shown in repeated resolutions<br />
of the United Nations General Assembly. The Note also drew to the<br />
attention of tie Government of the People's Republic of China the<br />
recent decision of the International Court of Justice in favour<br />
of the Australian aDprlication for interim measures of protection<br />
and stated that all governments, including the Government of the<br />
People's Republic of China, have a clear international obligation<br />
to -prevent the danger of environmental pollution. The Note ca~ lled<br />
u-oon the Government of China to cease nuclear tests in the<br />
atmosphere and to associate itself with the international community<br />
in moves to bring about the ending of all nuclear w. eapons testing.<br />
I have the honour to request that this letter be circulated as a<br />
document of the General Assembly under the item ' Ur. 7ment need for<br />
susnension of nuclear and thermonuclear tests'." </p>
