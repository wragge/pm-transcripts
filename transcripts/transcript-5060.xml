FOR MEDIA 5 JUNE 1979<br />
VISIT BY BRITISH PRIME MINISTER<br />
I am very pleased to announce that the newly elected Prime Minister<br />
of Great Britain, the Rt Hon. Margaret Thatcher, MP, has accepted<br />
an invitation to visit Australia and will be here on 30 June<br />
and 1 July. The visit is particularly welcome, coming as it<br />
does so soon after Mrs Thatcher's assumption of office.<br />
Mrs Thatcher's association with Australia is a long standing one,<br />
which is appreciated by all of us. She visited Australia in<br />
1972 and again in 1976, and her visit on this occasion as Prime<br />
Minister will serve to emphasise the close consultation that<br />
has been such a feature of relations between Australia and<br />
Britain over the years. Both Governments value their close<br />
association, which reflects the very real interests and traditional<br />
ties between our two countries.<br />
As -ell as providing an opportunity for a broad review of<br />
Aus-ralia-United Kingdom relations, the visit will permit both<br />
Pri-. e Ministers to discuss other important mratters, including<br />
the results of th* e Tokyo Sumit, the forthcoming Commonwealth<br />
Heads of Government Meeting to be held in Lusaka in August, and<br />
international developments generally.<br />
All Australians will give Mrs Thatcher a very warm welcome during<br />
her visit. </p>
