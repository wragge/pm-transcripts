FOR PRESS : I P. M. No. 51/ 1966<br />
LIBERAL NOMINATIONS PLAN IN QUEENSLAND<br />
Comment by the Prime Minister. Mr. Harold Holt<br />
The Queensland State Division is well known to be<br />
strongly of the view that it should campaign actively through all<br />
areas of Queensland in order to build support for the Party in a<br />
growing State, and to make the policies of the Party more widely<br />
known. It has been the practice for each State Division<br />
of the Liberal Party to decide its own policy on the selection of<br />
candidates and the seats whioh it will contest. W hen the position<br />
of members of the Federal coalition ' Ministry could be affected by<br />
these dtoisions, it has been usual for some discussion to take<br />
place between the Division concerned and the Federal Parliamentary<br />
Leader. I have been in touch with Dr. Hartwig, the President of<br />
the Queensland Division, suggesting that as he will be in Canberra<br />
for the meeting of the Federal Executive to be held on Thursday,<br />
we take the opportunity to have a talk about the matter. He said<br />
he would welcome a discussion between us.<br />
The coalition Government, although drawn from two<br />
Parties, has not at any time functioned along Party lines. WVVe have<br />
developed a very good personal relationship. Our teamwork has been<br />
close, harmonious and co-operative. It follows that I could not<br />
join in opposing loyal Cabinet colleagues in my own Government.<br />
CANBERRA, 8th June, 1966 </p>
