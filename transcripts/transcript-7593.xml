PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 12 MAY 1989<br />
Following the introduction of self-government in the<br />
Australian Capital Territory, and the consequent effect on<br />
the workload of the Minister for the Arts and Territories,<br />
the Hon Clyde Holding MP, his responsibilities are to be<br />
changed. After discussions with the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the<br />
Environment, Tourism and Territories, Senator the Hon Graham<br />
Richardson, I have agreed that Mr Holding have<br />
responsibility for tourism matters under Senator Richardson,<br />
and that Mr Holding's title be amended to Minister for the<br />
Arts, Tourism and Territories. He will retain<br />
responsibility for other territories and will be involved<br />
with relations between the ACT and the Commonwealth.<br />
I will be recommending to His Excellency the<br />
Governor-General that Mr Holding be appointed to his new<br />
office before the commencement of the next Parliamentary<br />
sitting period.<br />
The appointment of Mr Holding will ensure that the vital<br />
tourism industry continues to receive the close attention of<br />
this Government.<br />
