RjA,' ALIA L<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 11 May 1983<br />
The following message has been sent to His Excellency<br />
Mr Zhao Ziyang, Premier of the State Council of the People's<br />
Republic of China:<br />
" Dear Premier Zhao,<br />
My Government welcomes the announcement of your<br />
Government's decision to award contracts for oil<br />
exploration in the South China and Yellow Seas to<br />
a consortium which includes Australia's largest<br />
company, Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd.<br />
In our recent talks, we agreed that there was<br />
considerable scope for further developing<br />
relations between our countries and noted that<br />
there were particular opportunities for economic<br />
and commercial co-operation.<br />
The participation of Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd<br />
in the consortium is an example of how we can<br />
co-operate in practical ways for our countries'<br />
mutual benefit. It is very pleasing, indeed, that<br />
your Government's decision follows so soon after<br />
our discussions during your visit to Australia,<br />
building on those discussions in the most practical<br />
sense. I am sure that there will be other opportunities<br />
through which both our countries can continue to<br />
develop the relationship which was so much advanced<br />
by your recent visit.<br />
With best wishes,<br />
Yours sincerely,<br />
R. J. L. Hawke" </p>
