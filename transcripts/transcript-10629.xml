    <content><![CDATA[<p>E&amp;OE...............................................</p>
<p>Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen. I have called this news conference</p>
<p> with the Defence Minister to announce that this morning, Cabinet decided</p>
<p> that Australia would make a contribution to any United States-led</p>
<p> military operation against Iraq. I stress at the outset that Australia</p>
<p> still hopes that force will not be necessary, that it is our fervent</p>
<p> desire that this matter be settled without resort to force. We will</p>
<p> continue in cooperation with the United States and other countries</p>
<p> to urge upon the Iraqi leadership the commonsense, both from Iraq's</p>
<p> point of view, for the welfare of the population of Iraq, for the</p>
<p> stability of the Middle East and for broader world security interests,</p>
<p> that Iraq comply with the resolutions of the United Nations and allow</p>
<p> inspection by the UNSCOM teams of particular sites in Iraq. And if</p>
<p> that is to occur, then the use of force and the consequences of that</p>
<p> for Iraq can be avoided and the region and indeed the rest of the</p>
<p> world can breathe a great deal more easily.</p>
<p>But if it does become necessary for a United States-led coalition</p>
<p> to use force then Australia has decided that it will make a contribution</p>
<p> to that effort. We believe it would become regrettably necessary for</p>
<p> that force to be used because if Iraq is allowed to thumb it's</p>
<p> nose at the rest of the world, to continue developing it's capacity</p>
<p> to deliver chemical and biological weapons, not only does that pose</p>
<p> an immediate threat to neighbouring countries to Iraq, because it</p>
<p> should be remembered that this foul material can be delivered not</p>
<p> only through missiles, but also through the use of aircraft. And if</p>
<p> Iraq were allowed to go on unchecked then, of course, other countries</p>
<p> might be tempted to imitate what Iraq has done.</p>
<p>So there is an imperative for the security of the region and indeed</p>
<p> in the long-term the security of the rest of the world that Iraq be</p>
<p> denied this capacity in relation to weapons of mass destruction. Also</p>
<p> involved in this dispute is upholding the authority of the United</p>
<p> Nations because the inspections which are sought at Iraqi installations</p>
<p> are authorised under United Nations resolutions.</p>
<p>In assessing the kind of contribution that Australia might make we</p>
<p> have already initiated discussions with the United States and what</p>
<p> we have in mind are, for example, special forces including a detachment</p>
<p> of the Special Air Service for search and rescue operations. We also</p>
<p> have in mind two Boeing 707s for refuelling purposes and also, in</p>
<p> addition, some individual specialists in areas of intelligence and</p>
<p> medical skills.</p>
<p>I want to say again that we fervently hope that military action will</p>
<p> not be necessary and we will continue all of the diplomatic efforts</p>
<p> that have been undertaken and they will be intensified over coming</p>
<p> days.</p>
<p>I have informed the Leader of the Opposition of the Government's</p>
<p> decision. I appreciate the public comments that Mr Beazley has thus</p>
<p> far made on this issue. I will continue to keep the Opposition fully</p>
<p> informed and I will make available the Defence Chiefs and any other</p>
<p> advisers of the Government that the Opposition may wish to speak to</p>
<p> so that there is a full communication and a full flow of appropriate</p>
<p> information from the Government and it's advisers to the Leader</p>
<p> of the Opposition.</p>
<p>Immediately after this news conference I intend to telephone President</p>
<p> Clinton and to brief him on the Government's decision.</p>
<p>Can I say that I will do everything I can over coming days and weeks</p>
<p> to keep the Australian public fully informed of what is involved and</p>
<p> to ensure that the public at all times understands the purpose of</p>
<p> the Australian Government's commitment and the reason why it</p>
<p> is in Australia's interests that we make this commitment to support</p>
<p> any United States-led activity that may become necessary.</p>
<p>I ask the Australian people to understand the reasons for the Government's</p>
<p> decision, to see it in the context of our national interest and to</p>
<p> give its support to the Government's decision. May I also say</p>
<p> that if military action does become necessary, the thing uppermost</p>
<p> in my thoughts and prayers will, of course, be the safety of Australian</p>
<p> service personnel. Because it is they who will be taking the gravest</p>
<p> risks and be exposed to the greatest danger. I hope that it is not</p>
<p> necessary in the final analysis for them to be involved in those operations.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, when do you expect our people to be deployed?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>It is too early to say. We have commenced discussions with the United</p>
<p> States. Now that the Government's decision has been taken it</p>
<p> is, of course, possible for the Chief of the Defence Force to put</p>
<p> in motion steps that will be necessary in the event that the sort</p>
<p> of offer that we have in mind integrates effectively with what the</p>
<p> Americans have in mind.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Is this the maximum Australian contribution or could it be added to</p>
<p> at a later date?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I wouldn't think that we would be adding to it. What we have</p>
<p> in mind is a contribution of this order. If it turns out to be the</p>
<p> case that after discussion with the Americans over the next few days</p>
<p> some other contribution of a similar order of magnitude, and I stress</p>
<p> that, a similar order of magnitude, would be more appropriate then</p>
<p> that, or part of that would be substituted.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, what is the order of magnitude...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>We are looking here about 250, maximum, of Australian personnel in</p>
<p> the order in relation to the special units of about 100 to 110.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>How much is this going to cost, Prime Minister?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I don't know yet but obviously there will be additional expense</p>
<p> involved. The security of the personnel and the diplomatic and foreign</p>
<p> policy and national security considerations have been upper-most in</p>
<p> my mind. Quite frankly, I haven't yet been briefed on the cost.</p>
<p> I think it is too early to be canvassing those matters.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, the Federation of Islamic Councils urged you yesterday</p>
<p> not to go ahead with this and they have said that Islamic communities</p>
<p> in Australia will be put under enormous pressure. Do you have a message</p>
<p> for them today?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I have a message and that is that this is a free and open and</p>
<p> liberal, democratic society. And no Australian should be exposed to</p>
<p> any form of victimisation or vilification by reason of any foreign</p>
<p> policy decision or nation security decision taken by any Australian</p>
<p> government. At the end-of-the-day we take decisions based upon the</p>
<p> Australian national interest and the Australian national interest</p>
<p> is one and indivisible, irrespective of the ethnic derivation of individual</p>
<p> Australians.</p>
<p>But I want to say to Australians of Islamic faith and of Islamic background</p>
<p> and of Arabic background that all of you are fully and totally part</p>
<p> of the Australian community and in no way is this decision an adverse</p>
<p> judgement on your contribution to the Australian community. You have</p>
<p> our understanding and our support but we have our responsibilities</p>
<p> to the total Australian community and the total Australian national</p>
<p> interest. And I am certain that, just as in the Gulf, time of the</p>
<p> Gulf war, there was great understanding amongst all Australian people,</p>
<p> I am sure there will be on this occasion and I appeal to all Australians</p>
<p> not to see Islamic or Arabic Australians as being in any way responsible</p>
<p> for the conduct of the Iraqi leadership.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Was the reluctance of other nations, particularly France and some</p>
<p> of the European nations, to join America at this stage, taken into</p>
<p> account Cabinet's discussions?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well the likely reaction of other countries was canvassed and I think</p>
<p> it is too early to make the judgement implicit in your question. I</p>
<p> would expect that there will be material contributions from quite</p>
<p> a number of countries. But it is not, of course, for me to make announcements</p>
<p> about what other countries are going to do.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, would you have preferred an ANZAC force?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I prefer a contribution by Australia which is appropriate, proportionate</p>
<p> and effective. Now, if in the course of doing that it can be meshed</p>
<p> in with a New Zealand contribution, then all the better. But it is</p>
<p> a question of what is operational and what fits in with the overall</p>
<p> plan and what best suits the Australian national interest. But there</p>
<p> is obviously some advantage, all other things being equal and there</p>
<p> being such a contribution or a contribution under that name.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, what is the likely impact on the 29 Australians that</p>
<p> are in Iraq? What's their disposition and are there any moves</p>
<p> to get them out?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well there aren't any moves at the moment. We have obviously</p>
<p> discussed that and we will keep that matter under very close attention</p>
<p> and I think it is not appropriate for me to say any more than that</p>
<p> but we have given it a lot of thought. We not only have 29 Australians</p>
<p> but there are, I think, 16 New Zealanders to which we have consular</p>
<p> responsibility and their welfare, and taking steps to secure their</p>
<p> welfare, their continued welfare - if that is necessary - will of</p>
<p> course be kept constantly in mind by the Government.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>... made by Australia, announced by Australia today comensurate with</p>
<p> the sort of response the US was asking for? I mean, is it in line</p>
<p> with that?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well the US was not so presumptuous as to say what the response should</p>
<p> be. The US asked us. The President made a formal request to me. We</p>
<p> discussed it in some detail and we decided that this was the best</p>
<p> on the advice that we got from our military advisers and we have been</p>
<p> talking to them and to the Defence Department and to the Department</p>
<p> of Foreign Affairs and the intelligence agencies quite actively and</p>
<p> intensely over the past few days, and that was the advice that we</p>
<p> were given and we believe it is appropriate. We think it of course</p>
<p> will make a significant contribution in the areas of the expertise</p>
<p> of the people involved and they of course, particularly in relation</p>
<p> to the special units, they have a very fine and deserved reputation</p>
<p> for expertise around the world.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Could you explain why Cabinet decided not to send in the Australian</p>
<p> Navy like we did in 1991?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>One of the reasons why at this stage that's not in contemplation</p>
<p> is the time constraint. There is such a thing as steaming time and</p>
<p> you have to bear that in mind.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, the search and rescue operations you have mentioned,</p>
<p> would they possibly involve Australian troops going onto Iraqi territory?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, what we have in mind at this stage is the use of these special</p>
<p> personnel in rescue and search operations. I don't want at this stage</p>
<p> for reasons I hope you will understand go into the detail of what</p>
<p> that might be. It's still being discussed and of course at this</p>
<p> stage it is hypothetical.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>How high is the risk of Australian casualties, Mr Howard and will</p>
<p> we be following the American example of inoculating our troops against</p>
<p> the possibility of anthrax?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I can assure you that the Australian Army and the Australian</p>
<p> forces have a world class reputation in preventative measures and</p>
<p> all of the measures that are necessary will be taken. I don't</p>
<p> want to put a limitation on them by naming one or two measures. Australians</p>
<p> have always been, may I say better at that than most and we will certainly</p>
<p> be taking great steps in that direction.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, your comment about time constraints and ruling out</p>
<p> the frigates, does that indicate that you think a military strike</p>
<p> could occur within two weeks?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Not necessarily. I just indicate that that's one of the reasons</p>
<p> why we believe what we are canvassing here is more appropriate. You've</p>
<p> got to remember that in relation to Desert Storm there was a very</p>
<p> long lead time.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, Jordan is the latest country to come out against the</p>
<p> air strikes. Are you concerned that there is a very solid Arab unit</p>
<p> now opposed to the US action?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No. I believe that what will, what is already the case are there are</p>
<p> indications of different levels of support from a number of the Arab</p>
<p> states.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Where will the special forces personnel be based, Mr Howard?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Look, I am not going to... it is altogether too early for me to talk</p>
<p> about that because these are matters that will need to be discussed</p>
<p> with the United States and discussed with the commanding officers</p>
<p> of the units involved.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>... we will be sending our own helicopters?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I think the United States will be providing assistance in that department.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>When will they be leaving, Mr Howard?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I cannot tell you. Look we took the decision a couple of hours ago.</p>
<p> We are now putting into action discussions with the United States</p>
<p> and with the units involved, and as further information is available</p>
<p> to me I will make it available to the Australian public and to the</p>
<p> Australian media and we are very keen to ensure that there is a full</p>
<p> flow of information that can go to the media and to the Australian</p>
<p> public but many of these things, it is just too early for me to be</p>
<p> able to answer because decisions have not been taken.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Will there be a restriction on special forces troops being used only</p>
<p> for search and rescue operations or could they be used for offensive</p>
<p> operations as well?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>The purpose that I outlined was the former.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, you spoke in passing of the dangers potentially facing</p>
<p> the Australian service personnel. Have you had from the military any</p>
<p> estimates of possible casualties?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>We haven't had any estimates, no. I mean, we have obviously been</p>
<p> told that there is in any theatre of war the possibility of casualties</p>
<p> but as to the quantum, of course we haven't had any estimates</p>
<p> and I don't intend to go into that but I have to, in all candour,</p>
<p> as anybody at this news conference would know, acknowledge that the</p>
<p> possibility of casualties is always there whenever force is used.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>.... in terms of international support. Will you be hoping to extract</p>
<p> any trade commitments out of the US?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>This has got nothing to do with trade. The two things are quite separate.</p>
