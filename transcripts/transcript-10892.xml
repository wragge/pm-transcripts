    <content><![CDATA[<p>E&amp;OE............................................................................................</p>
<p>  Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the launch of the Government's</p>
<p>   tax plan for Australia's future. This is a very important day</p>
<p>   for the economic future of Australia. The plan that is being launched</p>
<p>   today represents the biggest single remake of the Australian taxation</p>
<p>   system since Federation. It involves some historic changes in relations</p>
<p>   between the Commonwealth and the States. It lays the groundwork</p>
<p>   for Australia going into the 21st century growing more</p>
<p>   strongly, generating more jobs and being able to compete more effectively</p>
<p>   on world markets. It also involves a very major remake of Australia's</p>
<p>   social security system, which will do two very important things.</p>
<p>   It will remove many of the poverty traps that now exist in the social</p>
<p>   security system and will provide incentives for work and thereby</p>
<p>   continue the policies of the Government whereby we have sought to</p>
<p>   rebalance the incentives within the Australian community towards</p>
<p>   work and away from welfare dependency.</p>
<p>  The Government is particularly proud of the changes that are involved</p>
<p>   in the relations between the Commonwealth and the States. For as</p>
<p>   long as any of you can remember one of the least ignobling characteristics</p>
<p>   of government in this country has been the annual begging-bowl pilgrimage</p>
<p>   to Canberra by the States. For the first time ever a Commonwealth</p>
<p>   Government has tackled this full-bloodedly head-on. We are giving</p>
<p>   the States the entire proceeds of the goods and services tax revenue.</p>
<p>   It will be their tax administered by us on their behalf. They will</p>
<p>   pay for its operation, they will get its full proceeds. It will</p>
<p>   not be possible for the rate to be varied without the total support</p>
<p>   of the governments of all of the States and Territories, the Federal</p>
<p>   Government and the Senate and the House of Representatives.</p>
<p>  In other words, I don't think it is going to happen, because</p>
<p>   to get an agreement at all of those levels is indeed a mammoth task</p>
<p>   and something that I think more than anything else guarantees a</p>
<p>   long period of time for the rate, and indeed, works very strongly</p>
<p>   against its change. What that particular change will do will be</p>
<p>   to give the States far greater freedom and far greater resources</p>
<p>   over time. On our calculations rising to about $25 billion more</p>
<p>   cumulatively by the year 2010 over and above what they would be</p>
<p>   likely to get under the operation of the present system through</p>
<p>   to the year 2010. It will therefore give to the States greater resources</p>
<p>   to do the things for which they are constitutionally responsible.</p>
<p>   It will probably lead to the end of the annual Premiers conference's</p>
<p>   and some of you may well be disappointed about that but there will</p>
<p>   be others who may not be so disappointed about that development.</p>
<p>  So that does represent a very, very important shift and a very,</p>
<p>   very significant and historic one as we approach the centenary of</p>
<p>   the Federation. Not only will we have a new State for a new century</p>
<p>   but we will have a new tax system and we will have a new arrangement</p>
<p>   between the Commonwealth and the States for a new century. And the</p>
<p>   historic importance of that should certainly not be underestimated.</p>
<p>   I said when I announced that there will be taxation reform that</p>
<p>   there would be five principles that would guide that reform. And</p>
<p>   if you go through the plan you will find that at every point those</p>
<p>   principles have been faithfully honoured. To start with, there will</p>
<p>   be lower tax collected under the plan. This plan reduces overall</p>
<p>   tax collection. There will be a $13 billion reduction in the area</p>
<p>   of personal income tax cuts and on top of that the additional family</p>
<p>   initiatives are worth about $2 billion.</p>
<p>  I am immensely proud of the fact that under this plan the top marginal</p>
<p>   rate paid by 81 per cent of Australian taxpayers will be 30 cents</p>
<p>   in the dollar or less. In other words, you can pass from $20,000</p>
<p>   of annual income to $50,000 of annual income without going into</p>
<p>   a higher tax bracket. You can almost call it the "bracket creep</p>
<p>   abolition provision" of the tax plan because if you look at</p>
<p>   the working, the income profile of so many low and middle income</p>
<p>   earners to pass from $20,000 through to $50,000 would be the experience</p>
<p>   of their working life and probably no more. And 81 per cent of people,</p>
<p>   we must always remind ourselves that 81 per cent will be on 30 per</p>
<p>   cent or less and that is a particularly important change. We have</p>
<p>   changed the rates at every point except the top rate. What we have</p>
<p>   done with the top rate is to alter the threshold but to keep it</p>
<p>   at 47 cents. We have increased the tax-free threshold from $5,400</p>
<p>   to $6,000. We have dropped the bottom rate from 20 to 17. The 30</p>
<p>   cent rate cuts in at $20,000 and carries you through to $50,000</p>
<p>   and then there is a 40 cent rate between $50,000 and $75,000. So</p>
<p>   the benefits for low and middle income earners are enormous under</p>
<p>   this package. The incentive for doing more overtime, the incentive</p>
<p>   for extra effort and the incentive for harder work is very self-evidently</p>
<p>   there.</p>
<p>  We have, of course, included in the plan a number of things that</p>
<p>   have not been widely speculated about or even thought of outside</p>
<p>   a very narrow range of people. I am delighted to be able to announce</p>
<p>   that as part of the plan provisional tax will be abolished. And</p>
<p>   that will be of enormous encouragement to many people in business,</p>
<p>   many self-employed people, and it will be a very great advantage</p>
<p>   to many self-funded and retired people. Very importantly for that</p>
<p>   group also we are introducing a system whereby we are going to fully</p>
<p>   refund imputation credits. And that is very, very important to people</p>
<p>   on modest incomes who hold shares who will get dividends franked</p>
<p>   to the tune of 36 cents, which is the company rate, and they might</p>
<p>   be on 20 and they can't get the other 16. Well under this system</p>
<p>   they'll get the other 16 as a refund on the franked increment</p>
<p>   from the Taxation Office.</p>
<p>  We have gone to very great care to ensure, as I outlined in the</p>
<p>   five principles, that low and fixed income and modest income people</p>
<p>   including pensioners will be fully protected. On July 1 pensions</p>
<p>   and other benefits will rise by 4 per cent and the proposals contain</p>
<p>   a guarantee that at all stages there will be a real increase of</p>
<p>   1.5 per cent in the pension over and above CPI increases. And that's</p>
<p>   a very, very important cushion, a very, very important additional</p>
<p>   protection. We are also increasing the retired persons' rebates.</p>
<p>   We are introducing special untaxed payments Â one of $1,000</p>
<p>   for all people 60 and over who have investment income and a further</p>
<p>   one for self-funded retirees of and above pensionable age of $2,000.</p>
<p>   There will be full eligibility for that; $20,000 a year and under</p>
<p>   and phasing out to $30,000. And importantly also, not only for this</p>
<p>   section of the community but for the entire community, the plan</p>
<p>   involves the introduction with effect from January of next year</p>
<p>   of a 30 per cent tax credit or rebate on the cost of taking out</p>
<p>   private health insurance. This will be for 80 per cent of the Australian</p>
<p>   community as valuable or more valuable than full tax deductibility</p>
<p>   of the cost of taking out private health insurance. This benefit</p>
<p>   will be available to everyone. It will not be subject to an income</p>
<p>   test and it will represent a very significant further incentive</p>
<p>   for people to take out private health insurance. That is important,</p>
<p>   not only for the contribution that private health insurance makes</p>
<p>   in its own right to the aggregate health system in Australia but</p>
<p>   also for the load that it will take off the public hospital system.</p>
<p>   And, of course, it follows the decision of the Commonwealth Government</p>
<p>   to inject a further $915 million over five years into the public</p>
<p>   hospital system, representing real increases over the five year</p>
<p>   period of the new Medicare agreement of 17 per cent at a time of</p>
<p>   virtually zero inflation. So we are particularly pleased about the</p>
<p>   contribution that that initiative is going to make.</p>
<p>  This is an extremely good tax plan for the bush. Country people</p>
<p>   will benefit enormously through the massive reduction in fuel costs.</p>
<p>   The reductions in fuel costs are worth about $3.5 billion a year.</p>
<p>   That involves something in the order of a net reduction in relation</p>
<p>   to diesel of $2 billion and the additional capacity of people to</p>
<p>   get a rebate because it is an input cost of the cost of other forms</p>
<p>   of fuel. So the benefit of this for the bush and the extent to which</p>
<p>   the economic consequences of what has long been described as the</p>
<p>   tyranny of distance in this country, those economic disabilities</p>
<p>   will be ameliorated by this package are really quite enormous. And</p>
<p>   the benefits in relation to diesel fuel will not be restricted to</p>
<p>   farmers, they will flow through to people like ferry and marine</p>
<p>   operators and will be of particular benefit to many tourist operators.</p>
<p>   And will also be of benefit particularly to the State of Tasmania</p>
<p>   which in recent times has been experiencing a very significant boost</p>
<p>   in its tourist industry as a result of changes that have been made</p>
<p>   by the Federal Government in other areas.</p>
<p>  The package, of course, as widely predicted, includes the introduction</p>
<p>   of a 10 per cent Goods and Services tax. It will, of course, be</p>
<p>   known as a Goods and Services tax, or a GST, and that 10 per cent</p>
<p>   will be introduced to replace 10 other taxes. And those 10 taxes</p>
<p>   are, of course, the wholesale sales tax, which will be abolished</p>
<p>   in its entirety. And there will be Commonwealth and State taxes,</p>
<p>   the Financial Institutions Duty, the bank account debits tax, stamp</p>
<p>   duty taxes on business conveyancing, on mortgages, on shares and</p>
<p>   marketable securities, bills of exchange, cheques, promissory notes,</p>
<p>   bed taxes, which will be abolished, it's part of the deal that</p>
<p>   they must go by the 1st of July in the year 2000. So</p>
<p>   it does represent a very straight-forward, simple, clearly defined,</p>
<p>   well put together, broad-based, consumption tax. The exemptions</p>
<p>   are minimal but important.</p>
<p>  Local government rates and water and sewerage charges are exempt</p>
<p>   and we are going to use the description of ÂGST free'</p>
<p>   to describe something that was previously described as zero-rated.</p>
<p>   And health and education, childcare and a number of other things</p>
<p>   that are listed in the document, including regulatory charges such</p>
<p>   as motor vehicle registration fees, will be free of the GST. And</p>
<p>   there will be another category that will be Âinput tax'</p>
<p>   which is the new description that we are bringing in instead of</p>
<p>   Âexempt' which is the equivalent description under an</p>
<p>   earlier document.</p>
<p>  We think the Goods and Services Tax is a modern, fair tax. One of</p>
<p>   the great advantages of the introduction of the Goods and Services</p>
<p>   Tax is the way in which we can increase the dividend for honest</p>
<p>   taxpayers out of the black economy. And you can't do that without</p>
<p>   a GST. You can't get $3 billion out of the black economy over</p>
<p>   three years without a GST.</p>
<p>  And the GST's introduction has also paved the way for the introduction</p>
<p>   of new and simplified methods of collection of business tax...group</p>
<p>   reductions and the like, which are described in detail in the document.</p>
<p>  The Goods and Services Tax will, of course, come into operation</p>
<p>   on the 1st of July in the year 2000 and, simultaneously</p>
<p>   with the introduction of that tax, of course, the personal income</p>
<p>   tax provision, which I've outlined.</p>
<p>  I've already had a number of preliminary discussions with the</p>
<p>   Premiers and Chief Ministers and it would be the intention of the</p>
<p>   Government, if returned at the next election, to convene an early</p>
<p>   meeting of Premiers and Chief Ministers at which the Treasurer and</p>
<p>   I will outline in more detail the proposals that we have.</p>
<p>  In the area of business tax we have made a number of decisions and</p>
<p>   we have set down a number of goals and objectives. The first thing</p>
<p>   that I should say about this package, so far as business is concerned,</p>
<p>   is that it reduces the cost burden of Australian business by an</p>
<p>   annual amount of $10 billion. What a lot of people still don't</p>
<p>   understand is that the cascading effect on business cost of the</p>
<p>   existing wholesale tax and indirect tax system, you can't get</p>
<p>   them back Â once you pay the taxes, you can't get them</p>
<p>   back from the Tax Office, they go into your cost base. The advantage</p>
<p>   of a Goods and Services Tax is that you can get it back.</p>
<p>  Could I just give you a simple illustration I have that will resonate</p>
<p>   with everybody in the room and that is that the savings for business</p>
<p>   in relation to petrol is worth seven cents a litre. Because seven</p>
<p>   cents a litre is the per cent, per litre equivalent of the 10 per</p>
<p>   cent GST. You can't get that back now but you can with a Goods</p>
<p>   and Services Tax. So that is of an enormous benefit to business.</p>
<p>  There's a $4.5 billion cost saving for Australian exporters.</p>
<p>   And at a time when this country has, more than ever in its history,</p>
<p>   a need to do well by exporters, it is imperative that we take the</p>
<p>   load off the backs of exporters. And one of the tremendous advantages</p>
<p>   of this proposal of the Government's is the way in which it</p>
<p>   reduces those business costs.</p>
<p>  The Treasurer will be outlining to the Business Council tomorrow</p>
<p>   the way in which we intend to handle and review consultative mechanisms</p>
<p>   that are alluded to in the document with the business community.</p>
<p>  We have the goal of moving towards a company tax rate of 30 per</p>
<p>   cent. Obviously in moving towards that there needs to be a consideration</p>
<p>   of some of the trade-offs that might be involved between achieving</p>
<p>   that goal and the maintenance of some of the tax preference arrangements</p>
<p>   that exist under the present legislation. And, quite plainly, different</p>
<p>   sections of the business community have different views on how that</p>
<p>   might be achieved.</p>
<p>  We have indicated in the document our intention to move to an entity</p>
<p>   system of taxation, and that's very important for the future</p>
<p>   of trust arrangements. We have outlined in the document some proposals</p>
<p>   whereby trusts, in effect, from the 1st of July, 2000,</p>
<p>   will be taxed in the same way as companies. Now, those changes are</p>
<p>   subject to certain provisions which strike, I believe, a fine and</p>
<p>   correct balance between the need to prevent the abuses that are</p>
<p>   occurring through the use of trusts but, by the same token, to acknowledge</p>
<p>   the contribution that those arrangements have made to the viability</p>
<p>   of many rural and other businesses throughout Australia. And the</p>
<p>   document details that balance that has been struck. And, in addition,</p>
<p>   the Treasurer is announcing today some specific measures which are</p>
<p>   targeted at particular tax avoidance practices using trusts. And</p>
<p>   we believe that those measures alone will enhance the revenue and</p>
<p>   make a very significant contribution.</p>
<p>  We've also, in the document, outlined some of the goals that</p>
<p>   we have in relation to reform of the capital gains tax, that they</p>
<p>   once again will be brought up in the review consultation mechanism,</p>
<p>   about which the Treasurer will have more to say tomorrow. I might</p>
<p>   also mention in that context that one specific announcement that</p>
<p>   has been in relation to capital gains tax that will further liberalise</p>
<p>   the rollover provisions in relation to capital gains tax.</p>
<p>  Ladies and gentlemen, it is neither possible nor desirable in a</p>
<p>   presentation such as this, with all of you having the full amplitude</p>
<p>   of the documentation available to you and, no doubt, a very keen</p>
<p>   desire to return to it, and also with what I can assure you is an</p>
<p>   excellent PowerPoint presentation that you are about to receive</p>
<p>   from the Treasurer, I don't think it's appropriate for</p>
<p>   me to go on any longer.</p>
<p>  I am especially proud of so many features of this tax policy. It</p>
<p>   does, importantly, build further on the additional assistance to</p>
<p>   families which was contained in the Government's Family Tax</p>
<p>   Initiative which we announced before the last election and which</p>
<p>   we introduced on time, in full, without deduction from the beginning</p>
<p>   of 1997. It will greatly enhance the choices available to Australian</p>
<p>   parents about the caring arrangements for their children. There's</p>
<p>   a lot of debate about this issue and there are a lot of false notions.</p>
<p>  The philosophy of the Government and the personal philosophy of</p>
<p>   the Prime Minister in this area has always been that maximising</p>
<p>   choice is the desirable thing. It is not the role of the Prime Minister</p>
<p>   or the role of the Government to stereotype a particular pattern</p>
<p>   of family behaviour or to say what families ought to do in relation</p>
<p>   to the arrangements of their infant children. It is the responsibility</p>
<p>   of the Government, within the bounds of fiscal capacity, to give</p>
<p>   maximum choice. And one of the features you will find as you absorb</p>
<p>   the detail of the new arrangements regarding family payments is</p>
<p>   that not only are they more generous, not only will we be achieving</p>
<p>   the consolidation of 12 payments down into three, not only will</p>
<p>   we be simplifying their delivery to the public by the establishment</p>
<p>   of a special family office, but they will particularly enhance the</p>
<p>   choices available to parents in relation to their young children.</p>
<p>   And they will capture the need that many of us are very familiar</p>
<p>   with, of having a tax and welfare system that allows people to go</p>
<p>   from a situation of two parents in full-time work to one for a period</p>
<p>   of time and then one of those back to part-time work and then one</p>
<p>   of those, over another period of time, back into the full-time workforce.</p>
<p>  And what we've tried to do with these changes is to maximise</p>
<p>   the choice, not to dictate stereotype but to maximise the choices</p>
<p>   that are available to parents in relation to those arrangements.</p>
<p>   And I think they will make a very healthy and a very welcome and</p>
<p>   a very positive contribution to achieving that particular goal.</p>
<p>  Ladies and gentlemen, this is an immensely visionary taxation reform.</p>
<p>   We have confronted the need for root-and-branch change. We have</p>
<p>   not squibbed any of the difficult issues. We do not underestimate</p>
<p>   the extent to which our opponents will try to conduct a fear campaign.</p>
<p>   We take a positive, hopeful, optimistic view about Australia's</p>
<p>   future. We believe that properly explained, the Australian people</p>
<p>   will embrace a tax plan that is good for Australia and fair to them.</p>
<p>   They are the two criteria, the two great tests. And applying those</p>
<p>   criteria and applying those tests, I believe that this plan passes</p>
<p>   both of them with flying colours. It will give Australia a new system,</p>
<p>   a better system for a new century. It will boost growth, it will</p>
<p>   boost jobs, it will improve fairness, it will generate greater incentive,</p>
<p>   it will improve the business climate, it will reduce the operating</p>
<p>   costs of business in country Australia. It will simplify and make</p>
<p>   more humane and sensitive the interaction between the tax system</p>
<p>   and the social security system, it will give a much needed boost</p>
<p>   to private health insurance. Overall, it is a tax plan for all Australians,</p>
<p>   and a tax plan that will be of enormous benefit to the future of</p>
<p>   our country and before concluding I would like to personally record</p>
<p>   my gratitude to my colleague Peter Costello, to the fine work that</p>
<p>   he has done in relation to the compilation of this package. Like</p>
<p>   all of these things they are team efforts, and as many of you know</p>
<p>   here, many of the things that I've canvassed this morning are</p>
<p>   issues to which I have committed in terms of policy change more</p>
<p>   than half of my political life, and I find in the launching of this</p>
<p>   plan this morning the achievement in a personal sense as well as</p>
<p>   in a political sense, a lot of the things that I've wanted</p>
<p>   to do. But you can never do those things alone, and I do appreciate</p>
<p>   immensely the commitment and personal skill that Peter has brought</p>
<p>   to the effort and I'd also like to take the opportunity of</p>
<p>   warmly thanking the members of the Treasury taskforce chaired by</p>
<p>   Dr Ken Henry who's seen many a tax package from both sides,</p>
<p>   and he's handled himself with enormous professional flair and</p>
<p>   skill and also many others, Michael L'estrange and David Stevens</p>
<p>   from the Cabinet Policy Unit, and of course the irrepressible Arthur</p>
<p>   Sinodinos who is the head of my office and who has a great economic</p>
<p>   understanding. So to all of those people can I express my immense</p>
<p>   gratitude.</p>
<p>  It is a moment of great excitement for me. It is a moment of immense</p>
<p>   satisfaction that we have been able to put together a plan that</p>
<p>   is good in the long term for the future of our nation and that is</p>
<p>   what public life is about, that is what doing things in politics</p>
<p>   is all about, and we are than happy to go the length and breadth</p>
<p>   of the country which I will start doing tomorrow to explain to the</p>
<p>   Australian people the benefits of this plan. We believe in it, we</p>
<p>   believe it is good, we believe it is fair and we believe it will</p>
<p>   deliver a better and a stronger and a happier Australian community.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  Some of the States say they won't cop this....?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well I look forward to campaigning in the State of Queensland if</p>
<p>   Mr Beattie opposes this package. I can't see that a State with</p>
<p>   it's vast distances and its heavily decentralised population</p>
<p>   and its significant areas of strong provincial business, I can't</p>
<p>   think of a State that will benefit more as a result of the transport</p>
<p>   measures that I've announced today than Queensland. The effect</p>
<p>   of these measures will be to reduce transport costs by an average</p>
<p>   of 6.7%. The impact of the diesel changes and things associated</p>
<p>   with it will massively reduce the cost of transporting goods over</p>
<p>   long distances. And that in Queensland, given the structure of Queensland,</p>
<p>   is more important than any other.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  What if they just say they don't want it?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well, I'm sorry I didn't hear your question.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  What if they just say they don't want it?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well I think they will. And can I tell you what will be happening.</p>
<p>   We will be going to the public with this plan and if we get the</p>
<p>   support of the public whenever the election is held, and I make</p>
<p>   no comment about that, we will expect the opposition parties in</p>
<p>   the Senate, whoever they may comprise, to let the plan go through</p>
<p>   because if ever an election campaign is going to have as a really</p>
