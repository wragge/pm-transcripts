PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW WITH STEVE LIEBMANN, A CURRENT<br />
AFFAIR, 22 AUGUST 1990<br />
E OE PROOF ONLY<br />
LIEBMANN: Prime Minister thanks for joining us.<br />
PM: It's a pleasure.<br />
LIEBMANN: Last night Treasurer Keating told the people<br />
of Australia that their faith in your Government is now<br />
being repaid and yet we' re told that living standards are<br />
going to fall and unemployment's going to rise and I'm<br />
sure a lot of people are saying today hey that's some pay<br />
back. PM: Real disposable income will, in per capita terms,<br />
will stay at about the same level. What we've had to do<br />
Steve and it's not an easy job, but we've had to impose<br />
sufficient restraint so that we're not going to be as a<br />
nation importing more imports that we can pay for, but at<br />
the same time not be so tough as to plunge the economy<br />
into recession. Employment will still grow during this<br />
year, we'll bring down our current account deficit and<br />
inflation will come down.<br />
LIEBMANN: But a lot of Australians are going to say how<br />
much tougher does it have to get. You walk through a<br />
suburban shopping centre, every second shop's empty. You<br />
talk to housewives, the supermarket bills are going up.<br />
The stories of bankruptcies and business collapses are<br />
continuing. How much tougher has it got to get?<br />
PM: Well let's put that in perspective and I don't Steve<br />
in any way want to minimise the hurt that some people<br />
have suffered. But let's remember this, that we have had<br />
up until a recent period the highest levels of investment<br />
in our country's history. And that investment which has<br />
flowed from our economic decisions which has involved<br />
restraint in wages, a move to profits and into<br />
investment, that has involved the fundamental process of<br />
restructuring of our economy, adding to our capital stock<br />
which is making us more competitive, which is now<br />
producing a situation where the Treasurer's able to point<br />
to the fact that in this next year, with the restraint in<br />
domestic demand the whole of our growth is going to come<br />
from net exports. We are becoming more competitive in a<br />
situation where employment will still grow in 1991. So </p>
<p>these things have been done to create an Australia which<br />
can continue into the future to be more competitive. Now<br />
I simply ask the Australian people to say well look do<br />
you know Hawkey, he's been around in public life now for<br />
over thirty years. I've never once tried to do something<br />
which is going to be against the interests of my country.<br />
LIEBMANN: Prime Minister, there's probably two million<br />
Australian pensioners today who would say we thought we<br />
knew Hawkey until last night.<br />
PM: No, no. Let me be quite clear about that. What we<br />
did last night was something which in fact was absolutely<br />
necessary and which will be in the best interest of<br />
pensioners. Well let's go to the two things Steve. I<br />
don't say things lightly. There are two things. There's<br />
the pharmaceuticals.<br />
Q LIEBMANN: They would say that's a broken promise.<br />
PM: No, not at all.<br />
LIEBMANN: Didn't Brian Howe say before the election no<br />
charges? PM: What in fact is going to be the situation is that no<br />
pensioner will be worse off. The most Steve, I ask you<br />
to understand the most, in my judgement, perhaps the<br />
single most important statistic in Paul Keating's budget<br />
speech last night was this one, talking about the<br />
pharmaceutical benefits scheme. It took nearly 40 years<br />
for the cost of that scheme to reach half a billion.<br />
That was from 1948 to 1985. In the next four years the<br />
next half a billion. Now what had to be done, and this<br />
is recognised by all independent commentators, and may I<br />
say totally accepted by the Opposition, everyone<br />
understands that that couldn't go on.<br />
LIEBMANN: But why did Brian Howe just a couple of months<br />
ago then, I mean if this was becoming apparent to you and<br />
the Treasurer, why did he say there'll be no charges?<br />
PM: If we'd just put charges on and done nothing else,<br />
then that would have been a contravention of all that had<br />
been said and all we stand for. But the $ 2.50 increase<br />
in pension will not only compensate but for very very<br />
many pensioners will mean they are better off. They can<br />
only pay $ 130. Once they reach $ 130 they don't pay<br />
another cent. And yet in the year they get that $ 130 by<br />
way'of pension increase.<br />
LIEBMANN: Do you acknowledge though that you may be<br />
imposing unnecessary trauma, anxiety, confusion on them,<br />
that coupled with<br />
PM: I understand. I understand that for our elderly<br />
citizens, change of any kind can always be worrying. I<br />
mean I would be the last person in the world to want to </p>
<p>impose an unnecessary hardship upon a pensioner.<br />
Uncertainty there will be, but I believe that through the<br />
processes of our public servants in the Department of<br />
Social Security, through welfare organisations, through<br />
the media, that our pensioners will understand why these<br />
decisions were right and necessary and how, in fact, in<br />
regard to the other factor, the deeming, what decisions<br />
they will need to take to take advantage of the decisions<br />
LIEBMANN: But they're hard decisions for someone who's<br />
plus. I mean one pensioner organisation today on that<br />
budget provision about the $ 2000 plus and the<br />
interest is saying that it's piracy.<br />
PM: Well it is not piracy. The piracy that's been going<br />
on is as far as the banks are concerned. I'm not saying<br />
they are pirates but it's been just a straight out<br />
subsidy by the elderly of the banks. The banks getting<br />
their money from the elderly, three to four per cent and<br />
then lending at 18%.<br />
LIEBMANN: But how do they decide where their money is<br />
safe? I mean we're talking about senior citizens now.<br />
PM: Ok. What we've done there is significantly to<br />
increase the financial counselling services within the<br />
Department of Social Security so that our elderly<br />
citizens who may be uncertain or confused can go there<br />
and get competent professional advice as to what they<br />
need to do.<br />
LIEBMANN: Yes, but I've got to say to you, I mean, we<br />
had a Victorian Treasurer who was telling people that<br />
their money was safe and look what happened.<br />
PM: That is no response to what I'm saying because there<br />
is no financial commentator today you get any financial<br />
commentator you want, get onto your program and say, with<br />
competent advice, within the banking system, I mean<br />
banking system, can you get 10% on your money safely and<br />
securely and everyone will say yes you can.<br />
LIEBMANN: Alright, finally on the Middle East crisis.<br />
Are you any more confident today than you were when<br />
Kuwait was invaded that this crisis can be settled by<br />
diplomatic solution?<br />
PM: If we were dealing with a rational man then my<br />
answer would be an unequivocal yes. Because what's<br />
happened since the invasion would lead any rational man<br />
to the conclusion that the interests of his people could<br />
only be served by a withdrawal from Kuwait.<br />
LIEBMANN: But?<br />
PM: But you've got to say that on the evidence of<br />
history, where this man has engaged in an eight year long </p>
<p>war with Iran, where he's gassed his own people, the<br />
evidence is that the man is not entirely rational. My<br />
hope is that there will be sufficient people around this<br />
man who will understand the truth of what I'm saying,<br />
that they will be able, if he doesn't come to that<br />
conclusion himself willingly, to be able to force him to<br />
that conclusion.<br />
LIEBMANN: But in the meantime our Australians sit there.<br />
What do we say to them? Be strong, be firm, we're<br />
confident we're doing all we can to get you out?<br />
PM: That's right. We are doing everything we can to get<br />
an end to this horrific situation.<br />
LIEBMANN: Prime Minister, thanks for talking to us.<br />
PM: It's been my pleasure Steve.<br />
ends </p>
