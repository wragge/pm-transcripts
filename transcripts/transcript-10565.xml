<p>ANNOUNCER:</p>
<p>But we begin the final programme of the last week before Christmas</p>
<p>   with the Prime Minister, who has joined us in the studio. Clearly</p>
<p>   the Government has not yet switched to holidays work and worked</p>
<p>   continued yesterday with the announcement that the Queensland QC,</p>
<p>   Ian Callinan will fill the High Court vacancy left by the resignation</p>
<p>   of Justice John Toohey. The Opposition has called the announcement</p>
<p>   a blatant attempt to stack the High Court, but opinion in the legal</p>
<p>   profession is mixed. Well the Prime Minister is here to talk about</p>
<p>   that and other issues and he is speaking with out chief political</p>
<p>   correspondent, Matt Peacock.</p>
<p>PEACOCK:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, when Tim Fischer took this appointment to the Governor-General</p>
<p>   yesterday was he getting the capital "C" conservative</p>
<p>   that he had been asking for?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Ian Callinan is an outstanding appointment to the High Court. He</p>
<p>   will do a first-class job, he is widely respected in the Australian</p>
<p>   legal community and he is also widely respected as a man of breadth</p>
<p>   and a good knowledge of life generally in the Australian community.</p>
<p>   I think he will do an excellent job for Australia on the High Court</p>
<p>   bench. The attack made on the appointment by the Labor Party is</p>
<p>   cheap and opportunistic, does no merit to the Labor Party. It contrasts</p>
<p>   with the fact that we had enough respect </p>
<p>for the High Court when we were in Opposition not to make cheap</p>
<p>   political attacks on appointments made by the former government.</p>
<p>   So I just dismiss that as being a bit of cheap politicking that</p>
<p>   demeans the Labor Party and certainly does not damage Ian Callinan,</p>
<p>   who will do an outstanding job on the bench.</p>
<p>PEACOCK:</p>
<p>But he has made clear his views on, what he calls, this over mighty</p>
<p>   court and it's so-called activism in relation to Parliament</p>
<p>   in the past. They are views that you'd no doubt share?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I am not going to get into a debate about judicial activism or</p>
<p>   this or that label that may be put on people. What matters is whether</p>
<p>   the person has got the legal ability, the integrity and the broad</p>
<p>   understanding of life to fill the role. Now on every count Ian Callinan</p>
<p>   has, and that is all that matters. If anybody is suggesting that</p>
<p>   he lacks integrity or lacks the legal ability to do the job, I haven't</p>
<p>   heard it and I don't believe I will hear it, because quite</p>
<p>   clearly he has got full integrity, he is widely respected in the</p>
<p>   community and he is a first-rate lawyer of long experience. I can't</p>
<p>   think of a better qualification for somebody to sit on the highest</p>
<p>   court in Australia. And I congratulate him on the appointment, I</p>
<p>   wish him well and I know that he will serve his country splendidly</p>
<p>   in that appointment.</p>
<p>PEACOCK:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, we had more good economic news yesterday. Have</p>
<p>   we seen the worst of this greater Asian melt-down as your Treasurer</p>
<p>   describes it?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yesterdays news was fantastic. I mean what the Government has done</p>
<p>   in turning around a $10.5 billion deficit into a prospective surplus</p>
<p>   of $2 billion or more next year, is quite extraordinary. It is an</p>
<p>   heroic economic achievement, achieved in the face of enormous obstruction</p>
<p>   from the Labor Party and others in the Senate and in the face of</p>
<p>   tremendous criticism from other sections of the Australian community.</p>
<p>   But as Australians go to Christmas they can take comfort from the</p>
<p>   fact that the efforts of their Government to tackle the economic</p>
<p>   problems we inherited mean that we have a better, a brighter, a</p>
<p>   more prosperous and a more forward looking Christmas than would</p>
<p>   otherwise have been the case. In the words of one newspaper this</p>
<p>   morning, we have fire-proofed the Australian economy against the</p>
<p>   ravages of the Asian economic melt-down.</p>
<p>PEACOCK:</p>
<p>But not totally though Prime Minister, you would be a miracle-maker</p>
<p>   to do that. Do you think the worst is over there?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I don't know precisely what is going to happen over the months</p>
<p>   ahead. I do know, that although there will be some impact on Australia,</p>
<p>   of course, and nobody suggests for a moment there wouldn't</p>
<p>   be some impact. But it is not going to be severe, and the reason</p>
<p>   it is not going to be severe is that we have got our own economic</p>
<p>   foundations in very solid shape. The International Monetary Fund's</p>
<p>   rescue package has been of enormous benefit to the region. Australia</p>
<p>   has played a full and active part, because we have been strong enough</p>
<p>   to do so, and isn't it good that Australia is strong enough</p>
<p>   to help its regional neighbours. If we hadn't have taken corrective</p>
<p>   measures we wouldn't have been and we wouldn't be going</p>
<p>   to this Christmas held in such high regard in the Asian-Pacific</p>
<p>   region.</p>
<p>PEACOCK:</p>
<p>And are some of those neighbours and the leaders, whom you have</p>
<p>   got to know in the past year, strong enough, do you think, to give</p>
<p>   the medicine that is required?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I am quite certain that the leadership of all of those countries</p>
<p>   understands the seriousness of the position, understands the commitments</p>
<p>   that have been made by other countries in the region, like Australia</p>
<p>   and that they are quite determined to do what is necessary to get</p>
<p>   their own foundations in better order. It will take time, and there</p>
<p>   are a lot of lessons that come out of what has happened in Asia</p>
<p>   recently. And the strongest of all lessons is, that unless you have</p>
<p>   the economic foundations sound, unless you tackle the basic problems</p>
<p>   like getting the deficit down, lowering inflation, cutting interest</p>
<p>   rates, building business investments, reforming the tax system,</p>
<p>   freeing labour markets, providing more competitive economic conditions,</p>
<p>   unless you do that you are going to run into trouble. And it is</p>
<p>   because Australia has done those things that we haven't run</p>
<p>   into anywhere near the trouble that countries in our region have.</p>
<p>PEACOCK:</p>
<p>Now it has been pretty wild political year, has it been your best</p>
<p>   or your worst, or a bit of both?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>It is for others to make those judgements. Inevitably governments</p>
<p>   have good periods and bad periods, but we end the year very strongly.</p>
<p>   We end the year having achieved this tremendous economic turn around</p>
<p>   and the absolutely stunning diplomatic success at the Kyoto Conference.</p>
<p>   That was an extraordinary achievement, that Kyoto summit, an absolutely</p>
<p>   extraordinary achievement. And it was against all the odds, I mean</p>
<p>   the Labor Party wanted us to capitulate in a way that would have</p>
<p>   threatened Australian jobs. What we were able to do at Kyoto, was</p>
<p>   both make a massive contribution to the world environmental effort</p>
<p>   to cut greenhouse gas emissions, but also to protect Australian</p>
<p>   jobs.</p>
<p>PEACOCK:</p>
<p>But they would have done the same if they had been in power, wouldn't</p>
<p>   they?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I can only judge people on what they say in the positions they</p>
<p>   occupy. And Labor Party spokesmen from about 6 months ago were calling</p>
<p>   on me to sue for peace. They were calling on me to grovel to the</p>
<p>   Europeans, to capitulate, to give in, to sacrifice the interests</p>
<p>   of miners, for example in the Hunter Valley and in the Bowen Basin</p>
<p>   in Queensland, and in all the other regional mining areas of Australia,</p>
<p>   and I said no, I wasn't prepared to do that. And we held out,</p>
<p>   and thanks to the superb negotiating job that Robert Hill did at</p>
<p>   Kyoto, we achieved a win for the environment and a win for Australian</p>
<p>   jobs. It was an absolutely stunning achievement by Australia. It</p>
<p>   was something that we prosecuted with vigour on behalf of the Australian</p>
<p>   national interest and we achieved it with no help at all from the</p>
<p>   Labor Party and in the face of a lot of cynical criticism from other</p>
<p>   quarters.</p>
<p>PEACOCK:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, I see that, just briefly, Nick Sherry is coming back</p>
<p>   to the Senate. Do you wish him well?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well of course I wish anybody who has been through the experience</p>
<p>   that he has been through well. I don't make any comment, at</p>
<p>   this stage and in that context, on the events that led up to it.</p>
<p>   Suffice to say that anybody who has gone through that kind of experience,</p>
<p>   it is not something that one would wish on anybody, equally, of</p>
<p>   course, I have to make the point that the criticisms that were made</p>
<p>   of him by my colleagues at the time were utterly justified and completely</p>
<p>   defensible and, of course, completely in accord with the facts.</p>
<p>   And any suggestion that criticism should attach to any of my colleagues</p>
<p>   for those events is, of course, totally misplaced.</p>
<p>PEACOCK:</p>
<p>And next year the ex-Senator Kernot looks like joining you in the</p>
<p>   Lower House. Is her star on the wain, as you'd hoped by now?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I am not quite sure the context of that. I don't think her</p>
<p>   star was ever as in the ascendant as you imagined. You say she is</p>
<p>   going to join us? Well she hopes to.</p>
<p>PEACOCK:</p>
<p>Well she can hardly lose against Tony Smith, could she? Someone</p>
<p>   defending slapping his wife and visiting a prostitute.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I am not going to get into discussion about personal matters.</p>
<p>PEACOCK:</p>
<p>Should he be replaced do you think?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>The question of his endorsement is a matter for the Queensland</p>
<p>   division. But I can make it very plain, that we will be fighting</p>
<p>   very hard to retain that seat for the Liberal Party. And anybody</p>
<p>   who thinks that Mrs Kernot is going to automatically inherit that</p>
<p>   seat is very badly mistaken. We will be fighting very hard on policy</p>
<p>   issues. I mean, my interest in Mrs Kernot is the policy stances</p>
<p>   that she takes.</p>
<p>PEACOCK:</p>
<p>What about these stories about her affair with the school Captain</p>
<p>   25 years ago. Are they of any public importance?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I am not the least bit interested in Mrs Kernot's private</p>
<p>   life. I don't think people's private lives should be part</p>
<p>   of the public debate. I do believe, however, that her public policies</p>
<p>   should be very much part of the public debate.</p>
<p>PEACOCK:</p>
<p>And these stories didn't come from anyone close to you as</p>
<p>   she says?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Certainly not.</p>
<p>PEACOCK:</p>
<p>The lack of a Government apology on the stolen children Prime Minister,</p>
<p>   I think has hurt you, you did apologise personally, how much do</p>
<p>   you think these stories have shocked white Australians?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I think it is very hard to judge Matt. There are a lot of Australians,</p>
<p>   like myself, who, in a personal sense, of course, regret and are</p>
<p>   distressed by any examples of the ill-treatment of Aboriginal people</p>
<p>   or indeed any section of the Australian community. You must remember,</p>
<p>   of course, that these practices were sanctioned by law at the time,</p>
<p>   not all of them were implemented in a harsh, insensitive fashion</p>
<p>   and many....</p>
<p>PEACOCK:</p>
<p>And many....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Sorry, no I am sorry, could I just finish. I think it is very important</p>
<p>   that I be allowed to give the full context of my view on this. And</p>
<p>   it is very important to remember that a lot of the people involved</p>
<p>   at the time believed that what they were doing was beneficial and</p>
<p>   they did it in a compassionate and in a sensitive way. Now time</p>
<p>   has moved on, it is now seen as quite unacceptable and whilst I</p>
<p>   have said on a number of occasions, and I say here again this morning,</p>
<p>   that of course I am sorry for any ill-treatment that occurred and</p>
<p>   of course I regret that. And I have said that repeatedly and I will</p>
<p>   go on saying it. But it is an entirely different thing for some</p>
<p>   kind of formal national apology to be given in relation to something</p>
<p>   that was sanctioned at the time. Now that is my view, that is the</p>
<p>   view of the Government and what we think should happen is that we</p>
<p>   should move on.</p>
<p>What the Royal Commission, what the HREOC Commission actually recommended</p>
<p>   as the most important thing that the Government could do was to</p>
<p>   help reunite families that had been separated and broken up as a</p>
<p>   result of these practices. And that is the main thrust of the policy</p>
<p>   that was announced a few days ago by Senator Herron. He said that</p>
<p>   the whole focus of the Government's response was on future</p>
<p>   unity of family members, future reconciliation, addressing the consequences</p>
<p>   of these practices rather than dwelling upon what occurred. And</p>
<p>   that, I think, is the way forward that most Australians would be</p>
<p>   attracted to.</p>
<p>PEACOCK:</p>
<p>Are we though ignorant, do you think, of this side of our history?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, I don't think we are ignorant. I think over the years</p>
<p>   we have become more familiar with our history, the good and the</p>
<p>   bad. And I think all Australians should face the truth about the</p>
<p>   past, equally we should not be intimidated into believing that everything</p>
<p>   about our past is negative and backward looking. The last couple</p>
<p>   of hundred years have been a period of heroic achievement by the</p>
<p>   Australian people and I do take a rather more optimistic view of</p>
<p>   what this country has achieved than many others.</p>
<p>PEACOCK:</p>
<p>Well can I try a quick trick question that I have asked quite a</p>
<p>   lot of my friends. You could probably name four American Indian</p>
<p>   tribes, could you name four Aboriginal tribes?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I could name, the Pitjantjatjara, the Gurindji, the Arrerente</p>
<p>   and the Waanyi.</p>
<p>PEACOCK:</p>
<p>I was going to say Wik, well done. Have a good holiday Prime Minister,</p>
<p>   what do you want for Christmas?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I want for Christmas to be an occasion for maximum happiness and</p>
<p>   contentment for Australians and their families. But I do want it</p>
<p>   to be a time at which the bulk of us, who have a reasonably comfortable</p>
<p>   life, to reflect for a moment on those who don't. I would like</p>
<p>   Australians who can afford to do so to give generously to those</p>
<p>   great institutions like the Salvation Army and the St. Vincent de</p>
<p>   Paul and the Smith Family who help the less fortunate people at</p>
<p>   this time of the year. I think it is an occasion when those of us</p>
<p>   who can afford to do so should help our fellow Australians who are</p>
<p>   in not such good circumstances. And can I take the opportunity of</p>
<p>   wishing you and your listeners a very merry Christmas, and above</p>
<p>   all, a very safe New Year.</p>
<p>PEACOCK:</p>
<p>Thank you very much and the same to you. And one quick final question,</p>
<p>   one that is on the minds of many Australians no doubt over summer,</p>
<p>   is Shane Warne too fat?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I am sorry, I just lost my ear-piece I apologise to the listeners.</p>
<p>   I wouldn't be game to get into that. I tell you what, he is</p>
<p>   still a venomous bowler and any member of the South African or New</p>
<p>   Zealand team that thinks he is other than still our greatest bowler</p>
<p>   is going to be sadly mistaken over the next couple of months.</p>
<p>PEACOCK:</p>
<p>Thanks Prime Minister, have a happy Christmas.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>[Ends]</p>
