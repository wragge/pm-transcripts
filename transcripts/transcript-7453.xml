PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 12 JANUARY 1989<br />
The Government proposes to recommend to the Governor-General<br />
the appointment of the Honourable J H Muirhead QC to be the<br />
next Administrator of the Northern Territory.<br />
It is expected that Mr Muirhead, who was nominated by the<br />
Northern Territory Government, will take office in the<br />
middle of the year. He will succeed His Honour Commodore<br />
Eric Johnston AM OBE who has been Administrator of the<br />
Northern Territory since 1980.<br />
Commissioner Muirhead will continue to head the Royal<br />
Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody until<br />
approximately the end of April.<br />
I wish to take this opportunity to express the Government's<br />
great appreciation for the work that has been done by Mr<br />
Muirhead and to wish him well in his future appointment.<br />
The interim report into Aboriginal deaths in custody<br />
prepared by Commissioner Muirhead is a significant<br />
contribution towards the resolution of the difficult issues<br />
into which the Royal Commission is inquiring. Relevant<br />
Commonwealth and State Ministers are making arrangements for<br />
early consideration and implementation of Mr Muirhead's<br />
recommendations. I am writing to State Premiers and to the Chief Minister of<br />
the Northern Territory about appropriate successor<br />
arrangements to ensure that the Royal Commission is able to<br />
complete its important inquiries. </p>
