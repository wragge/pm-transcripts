    <content><![CDATA[<p>E&amp;OE.....................................................................................................................</p>
<p>Thank you Michael and to my Parliamentary colleagues, ladies and</p>
<p>   gentlemen. I want to again thank the New South Wales Division for</p>
<p>   organising this post-budget gathering, to give me an opportunity</p>
<p>   in my home town and not very far from, if the curtains were open</p>
<p>   I could wave to the family, but to say a few things about the Budget</p>
<p>   and to say a few things about the current political context. </p>
<p>It is true that it was a good Budget and I think all of the nice</p>
<p>   things that have been said about it were thoroughly deserved and</p>
<p>   any of the ungracious things that were said about it were not merited</p>
<p>   and not deserved because it is the first time in eight years that</p>
<p>   we have an underlying surplus. It is true that we have achieved</p>
<p>   in two years a turn around on $13 billion from a deficit of $10.5</p>
<p>   to a surplus of $2.7 billion. But the story on debt reduction, which</p>
<p>   in the long term is what the future prosperity of this country is</p>
<p>   very much tied up with, the story of debt reduction is even more</p>
<p>   spectacular. I don't want to burden you with a lot of dreary</p>
<p>   figures but you've got to have some figures when you talk about</p>
<p>   a budget otherwise people might think you are not taking it very</p>
<p>   seriously.</p>
<p>In 1995 - 96, Australia's Federal Government debt accounted</p>
<p>   for about 20 per cent of our annual wealth generation, about 20</p>
<p>   per cent of our gross domestic product. When you factor in the proceeds</p>
<p>   of the sale of the remaining two thirds of Telstra, by the year</p>
<p>   2000 - 2001 we will have reduced that 20 per cent of annual wealth</p>
<p>   generation to a bare 1.5 per cent of the annual wealth generated</p>
<p>   by the Australian nation. And if we can go into the 21st century</p>
<p>   essentially free of Federal Government debt, and the next Coalition</p>
<p>   Government in New South Wales does as I know it will do, and that</p>
<p>   is privatise the electricity authorities of this state and if we</p>
<p>   can get a few other sensible privatisations carried out at a state</p>
<p>   level we are going to be able to look at the next century largely</p>
<p>   free of government debt.</p>
<p>Now that is something that I don't think anybody in this room</p>
<p>   in their lifetime would have thought possible and if you are looking</p>
<p>   to the future and if you are looking at the long term prospects</p>
<p>   of this country, being able to give to the generations of the third</p>
<p>   millennium, to the generations of the 21st century, being able to</p>
<p>   give to them an essentially debt-free nation, is a remarkable aspiration</p>
<p>   and I can't think of anything that would better set up the</p>
<p>   society which my children and the children of many here today will</p>
<p>   inherit, in fact to have something that is essentially debt-free</p>
<p>   and I am very proud that it's been my Government through the</p>
<p>   three budgets that we have now brought down, we has really been</p>
<p>   able to get the debt monkey off the back of Australians and we have</p>
<p>   been overburdened with debt for a very long period of time and there</p>
<p>   are some in the community who have said to me, what do you do with</p>
<p>   the surplus? You have $2.7 billion sitting there. Well it doesn't</p>
<p>   of course sit there. It is used to repay the accumulated debts of</p>
<p>   the last few years.</p>
<p>I notice that my opposite number said I was lucky, that I had led</p>
<p>   a very lucky Government. I didn't think it was terribly lucky</p>
<p>   when I discovered the state of the books that day after the election,</p>
<p>   not far from here when I saw the then-head of the Prime Minister's</p>
<p>   Department and he gave me the news, but putting that aside, I think</p>
<p>   the debt achievements, the way in which we have been able to reduce</p>
<p>   that debt has been a remarkable tribute to what the Government has</p>
<p>   done. </p>
<p>Another thing of which I am immensely proud is that for the third</p>
<p>   time in a row we haven't increased any taxes. There were no</p>
<p>   increases in income tax. There were no increases in excise and there</p>
<p>   were no increases in sales tax. Of course, when you were living</p>
<p>   in an era of virtually zero inflation, which we are at the moment,</p>
<p>   the nightmare of automatic indexation, which used to bedevil a lot</p>
<p>   of people particularly if you are in the spirits industry or if</p>
<p>   you are in some other, or you relied very heavily on fuel purchases</p>
<p>   to run your businesses and so forth, they were a real menace and</p>
<p>   we are living now in an era of virtually zero inflation, and it</p>
<p>   is something that I hope will continue for a period into the future.</p>
<p>   However, I repeat this. For the third time in a row, no increases</p>
<p>   in tax, be it income tax, company tax, excise duty or sales tax.</p>
<p>All of these things have occurred according to a plan. When we</p>
<p>   came to government we set out to get the country's books back</p>
<p>   into balance and into surplus and to pay off all of the debt that</p>
<p>   had been accumulated over the previous seven or eight years and</p>
<p>   we decided to do it largely by reducing Government expenditure.</p>
<p>   I am now very happy to say that we have in prospect Government expenditure</p>
<p>   levels that we haven't seen in this country since the years</p>
<p>   of the early 1970s. When you bear in mind that in the early 1970s</p>
<p>   the unemployment rate was a lot lower than what it is now and that</p>
<p>   the demand made on the social welfare purse by, for example, the</p>
<p>   Sole Parents Benefit and so forth and the things that have increased,</p>
<p>   I am not criticising this, I am simply making the observation that</p>
<p>   there are now demands on the public purse that didn't exist</p>
<p>   in the 1970s because of changed patterns in society and higher levels</p>
<p>   of unemployment. </p>
<p>When you take that into account, it is quite remarkable that we</p>
<p>   have been able to get back to the 1970 levels of expenditure because</p>
<p>   when Gough Whitlam was elected Prime Minister of Australia in December</p>
<p>   of 1972, the level of unemployment in this country was less than</p>
<p>   two percent. Indeed, if unemployment in the 1950s or 60s ever got</p>
<p>   anywhere near 2 per cent it was regarded as a national scandal.</p>
<p>   Now over the last generation it has become much harder to return</p>
<p>   unemployment to levels like that and that of course imposes a strain</p>
<p>   on the budget that wasn't present back in those years and I</p>
<p>   mention the point to illustrate the magnitude of the achievement</p>
<p>   of the Government in bringing it back towards those levels. </p>
<p>It is also true, as Michael said, that we have been able to insulate</p>
<p>   Australia against the worst of the Asian economic turmoil. It is</p>
<p>   impossible of course to think about Australia's future without</p>
<p>   looking at the juxtaposition of this country to the Asia Pacific</p>
<p>   region. The Asian economies are important to Australia. The great</p>
<p>   bulk of our exports go to the Asia Pacific region. Japan and Korea</p>
<p>   between them take 33 - 34 per cent of all of the exports of Australia.</p>
<p>   Although our outward foreign investment is more heavily directed</p>
<p>   towards the European Union in North America, our trade future is</p>
<p>   very much linked up with the countries of the Asian Pacific region</p>
<p>   and it is impossible to believe that we can be left completely unaffected</p>
<p>   by what has happened in Asia. The really good thing is that the</p>
<p>   impact has been dramatically less than would otherwise have been</p>
<p>   the case if we had followed a different economic path when we came</p>
<p>   to power. If we had said, forget about the deficit, if we had said,</p>
<p>   don't worry about getting the budget back into balance, can</p>
<p>   you imagine the impact that would now be having on the sections</p>
<p>   of the Australian economy. Can you imagine the impact that would</p>
<p>   be having in places like Wall Street on the attitudes, the impact</p>
<p>   of that on people's perception towards the way in which the</p>
<p>   Australian economy was being managed.</p>
<p>By doing what we have done, by taking the sort of decisions we</p>
<p>   did in the first couple of years, incurring some political criticism,</p>
<p>   running the gauntlet of many interest groups who have naturally</p>
<p>   criticised some of the decisions that have affected them, we have</p>
<p>   delivered in 1998 a measure of protection and a measure of inoculation</p>
<p>   from the impact of the Asian economic virus that would not have</p>
<p>   even been remotely possible if we had followed a less responsible</p>
<p>   course. </p>
<p>And we are able, as Peter Costello said the other day, to contemplate</p>
<p>   the possibility that we could be the fastest growing country in</p>
<p>   the Asia-Pacific region. Now that would have been unthinkable a</p>
<p>   few years ago. Now that's not to strike any note of complacency.</p>
<p>   It's not to discount the fact that because of what's happened</p>
<p>   in Asia our growth is going to be less now than would otherwise</p>
<p>   have been the case. But economic management and political achievement</p>
<p>   is all about what is possible and what is realistic and what is</p>
<p>   achievable, and what we have been able to do by way of insulating</p>
<p>   Australia from the Asian turndown has been quite spectacular and</p>
<p>   I think very very praiseworthy.</p>
<p>And we are of course now experiencing the lowest inflation rate</p>
<p>   for more than 30 years, the lowest interest rates, and I'm</p>
<p>   delighted to say that at long last it's starting to happen</p>
<p>   in the small business area, where many of the interest rates are</p>
<p>   starting to come down in the way in which housing interest rates</p>
<p>   have come down. And some of that has been due, let me say, in so</p>
<p>   small measure to the greater amount of competition which is in the</p>
<p>   financial sector and I want to pay tribute to the way in which the</p>
<p>   financial system's growing competition has contributed. Because</p>
<p>   at the end of the day, those immutable rules of commonsense economics</p>
<p>   normally work. If you have more competition in an industry, you</p>
<p>   normally do get a better deal for the consumer. That of course is</p>
<p>   what we have in mind when we try to do something about the waterfront.</p>
<p>   Although I promised myself I wouldn't spend more than half</p>
<p>   my speech talking about the waterfront, so I won't unless you</p>
<p>   provoke me. It is very barely thought to salute the role of competition</p>
<p>   in the Australian economy and competition in the financial sector</p>
<p>   has meant lower housing rates and lower small business rates, and</p>
<p>   we are very committed to a further expansion of that competition.</p>
<p>   And I think we have a good story to tell. It's been a very</p>
<p>   successful Budget, it's been a very well received Budget. It's</p>
<p>   also contained a number of measures which recognise the contribution</p>
<p>   of people, particularly older Australians, the contribution that</p>
<p>   those people have made to Australia. But of course the Budget is</p>
<p>   only one part of the economic story, and it's only one part</p>
<p>   of the political responsibility of my Government. We are a reformist</p>
<p>   Government and I am very very proud of that fact. I do hold the</p>
<p>   view, as Michael said, that there is really no point in being in</p>
<p>   Government unless you are willing to do something with it. I have</p>
<p>   been in politics for, it will be 24 years on the 18th of this month,</p>
<p>   since on a very rainy Saturday in 1974 I was elected as the federal</p>
<p>   Member for Bennelong and I went in after Gough Whitlam had been</p>
<p>   Prime Minister for 18 month, and it is almost a quarter of a century</p>
<p>   ago, and it almost naturally seems like the proverbial yesterday.</p>
<p>   And having become Prime Minister a couple of years ago, I've</p>
<p>   taken the view that having been given that enormous privilege, there</p>
<p>   is very little point in frittering away the opportunity and the</p>
<p>   privilege by leaving untouched those things that ought to be changed</p>
<p>   and ought to be reformed. And we set ourselves three or four major</p>
<p>   reform goals.</p>
<p>The first and most important of those was to reform Australia's</p>
<p>   industrial relations system, and I don't think there would</p>
<p>   be anybody in this room, and I don't even think there'd</p>
<p>   be any of our political opponents now, who would argue for a moment</p>
<p>   that we haven't tried to reform Australia's industrial</p>
<p>   relations system. And we have been very successful. The Maritime</p>
<p>   Union of Australia the activities of the waterfront of course still</p>
<p>   bulks very large in people's minds. Let me say to you again</p>
<p>   that we are absolutely determined to finish the job that we started</p>
<p>   in reforming the Australian waterfront.</p>
<p>And we are not doing that because we dislike the Maritime Union</p>
<p>   of Australia, or because we want to destroy unionism or because</p>
<p>   we want to discriminate against unionists. We are doing it because</p>
<p>   it is in Australia's interests to have a more efficient waterfront,</p>
<p>   and it is in Australia's interests to have voluntary unionism</p>
<p>   on the Australian waterfront, and we remain absolutely committed</p>
<p>   to that objective. We set ourselves, of course, the great goal of</p>
<p>   fixing the Budget and economic mess that we inherited in March in</p>
<p>   1996 and I've dealt at some length on that subject. But the</p>
<p>   other issue we've set ourselves the task of tackling of course</p>
<p>   was the fundamental issue of taxation reform. I have watched, and</p>
<p>   I think there are few people in this room who have watched some</p>
<p>   attempts being made by former Governments to reform the Australian</p>
<p>   taxation system. As Treasurer in the Fraser Government I made two</p>
<p>   attempts to persuade that Government to fundamentally reform the</p>
<p>   Australian taxation system. Paul Keating when he was Treasurer in</p>
<p>   the Hawke Government, to his credit, tried to reform the Australian</p>
<p>   taxation system, and I might say on that particular occasion I supported</p>
<p>   it, even though not everybody in the Liberal Party at that particular</p>
<p>   time agreed with my doing so because I have always believed that</p>
<p>   we had to reform our taxation system. John Hewson, to his credit,</p>
<p>   tried very hard in the lead up to the 1993 election to persuade</p>
<p>   the Australian public of the wisdom of taxation reform and unfortunately</p>
<p>   through the efforts of the then Prime Minister, my predecessor at</p>
<p>   that attempt was unsuccessful.</p>
<p>We now have what I believe to be the last great opportunity in</p>
<p>   the foreseeable future of doing something fundamental to reform</p>
<p>   the tax system. If you can't change it from the vantage point</p>
<p>   of Government, if you can't change it where there's a</p>
<p>   growing body of opinion in the community that it ought to be changed,</p>
<p>   if you can't change it when the common sense of this country</p>
<p>   needing a more competitive taxation system cries aloud for action,</p>
<p>   I can't believe that there will ever ever be such a conjunction</p>
<p>   of circumstances in the foreseeable future where you are going to</p>
<p>   be able to change it. And if somebody comes along and says, now</p>
<p>   look, we think it would be a good idea to fix the tax system but</p>
<p>   this is not the right time. I mean we had almost zero inflation,</p>
<p>   so if you are going to change the tax system on that score alone,</p>
<p>   that is a tremendously good reason why you should try and do it.</p>
<p>   We have the pressure of needing to be more competitive in our own</p>
<p>   region. That's a reason to do it. We have the Budget in balance</p>
<p>   - that's another reason to do it. </p>
<p>We have a greater congruence of support for tax reform between</p>
<p>   the business community and the welfare lobby despite some of the</p>
<p>   remarks that have been made in the past few days than we've</p>
<p>   ever had before. Now, I can't think of a better circumstance</p>
<p>   in the 25 years that I've been in politics which are more sufficient</p>
<p>   so far as taxation reform is concerned than the circumstances we</p>
<p>   now have . So if we blow this opportunity as a country, if all of</p>
<p>   those who are collectively responsible and that includes the Opposition</p>
<p>   as well as the Government, if we blow this opportunity, no public</p>
<p>   figure in Australia will in the foreseeable future have any credibility</p>
<p>   to say, oh well, now is not the right time but some time in the</p>
<p>   future might be the right time. I mean, does anybody really believe</p>
<p>   that we can go on indefinitely with the present ramshackle wholesale</p>
<p>   tax system that we have. </p>
<p>Does anybody believe that we can go on indefinitely with a personal</p>
<p>   income tax system which in a year or two's time we'll</p>
<p>   have people on average weekly earnings paying 47 cents in the dollar</p>
<p>   on some of their income. I don't think there are many people</p>
<p>   when confronted with those realities that believe that we can go</p>
<p>   on doing it. And therefore I am amazed beyond belief that the political</p>
<p>   irresponsibility of the Leader of the Opposition Mr Beazley saying</p>
<p>   last night : well, even if the Australian people vote for tax reform,</p>
<p>   I Kim Beazley, I am going to try and frustrate it. Now not only</p>
<p>   is that negative and destructive and the politics of a spoiler and</p>
<p>   not a leader, it is also an attitude which is arrogant towards the</p>
<p>   wishes of the Australian people. </p>
<p>I mean, one of the things you have got to do in politics, either</p>
<p>   when you are Government, or when you are Opposition, there are some</p>
<p>   things that cry aloud for a national interest decision and not a</p>
<p>   partisan political decision. When I supported the efforts of the</p>
<p>   former Prime Minister to change the tax system in the mid-1980s</p>
<p>   I did that because I thought it was the right thing to do for the</p>
<p>   country, and I think that the decision that Mr Beazley announced</p>
<p>   last night, is a negative, spoiling, backward looking decision and</p>
<p>   one that does no credit to him and no credit to the party he leads.</p>
<p>   What could be fairer or better than an incumbent Government saying,</p>
<p>   we will lay out a taxation plan, we will campaign on that, we will</p>
<p>   run all the political rifts that are involved in that, according</p>
<p>   to the conventional political wisdom, and if we win the election,</p>
<p>   having laid out our plans, then we ask the parties controlling the</p>
<p>   Senate, because under our present system, it is impossible for one</p>
<p>   side of politics to absolutely control both Houses of Parliament</p>
<p>   and that has been the case now for fifteen years since the size</p>
<p>   of the Parliament was increased by the action of the Labor Party</p>
<p>   back in 1983. Nothing could be fairer, nothing could be more open,</p>
<p>   and I want to say to the Opposition Leader and to the people of</p>
<p>   Australia, I think the public deserves better than that. </p>
<p>I think the public is entitled to have an honest contest about</p>
<p>   a policy, to have votes cast in a ballot box and then for the referee's</p>
<p>   decision to be adhered to. And if at the next election the Australian</p>
<p>   public votes for tax reform presented by the Government, I think</p>
<p>   there's a moral and political obligation on the parties who</p>
<p>   opposed it to accept the verdict of the Australian people. But apparently</p>
<p>   those who sit opposite do not take that view, and apparently those</p>
<p>   who sit opposite are determined to destroy and spoil and frustrate</p>
<p>   no matter what the verdict of the Australian people is.</p>
<p>It would be a different matter if we kept our plans under wraps.</p>
<p>   I mean, a lot of people have said to me, why do you talk about tax</p>
<p>   reform before the election? I talk about tax reform before the election</p>
<p>   because I don't think it's honest to say to the public,</p>
<p>   I'm not going to change the tax system and then get into power</p>
<p>   and say, oh look I've read the wrong page or something, I really</p>
<p>   meant to say the opposite. I mean that's not very credible.</p>
<p>   We are going to lay it all out so people know what they will get</p>
<p>   and having known that I think the honest, decent thing for any self</p>
<p>   respecting Opposition to do is to say, we'll accept the verdict</p>
<p>   of the people. </p>
<p>But apparently that is not the case. I mean, I don't often</p>
<p>   say nice things about my predecessor but I've got to say at</p>
<p>   least he had the guts and the strength before the 1993 election</p>
<p>   to say, if Hewson wins I'll let the taxation reform package</p>
<p>   go through.' And that is the course of action that I thought</p>
<p>   Mr Beazley was going to follow. It's the course of action that</p>
<p>   he said he was going to follow. And he made it very plain a few</p>
<p>   months ago, in fact in August of last year, and he said this, if</p>
<p>   John Howard goes to the next election with a clearly and honestly</p>
<p>   described GST tax proposal, and he wins the election, Labor will</p>
<p>   regard that as a mandate and not seek to block the introduction</p>
<p>   of a GST.' Well that's his sort of description of the</p>
<p>   tax reform and he repeated that on a number of occasions. Anyway,</p>
<p>   I think you've got my point. I think you understand that I</p>
<p>   am not very impressed with what he's done. </p>
<p>And more to the point, I don't think the Australian public</p>
<p>   will be very impressed with what he's done. I think the Australian</p>
<p>   public is fed up with the politics of spoiling and destruction and</p>
<p>   negativism. I think they are fed up with the situation where a government</p>
<p>   can get a very large majority in the House of Representatives and</p>
<p>   find that so many of the important elements of its programme has</p>
<p>   been frustrated in the Senate. But we will all live to fight another</p>
<p>   day on that, and at the end of the day the Australian people will</p>
<p>   resolve these things exercising the great common sense that they</p>
<p>   always do in relation to such great matters.</p>
<p>The very, very last thing that I want to say to all of you is this,</p>
<p>   that we have absolutely no intention on giving up on our reform</p>
<p>   agenda. We set ourselves a number of goals when we were elected</p>
<p>   in 1996. We set ourselves the goal of IR reform, we had to stick</p>
<p>   to that to the bitter end. We set ourselves the goal of fixing the</p>
<p>   Budget. We've essentially, but not totally, done that job and</p>
<p>   we can't afford to be complacent. We set ourselves the goal</p>
<p>   of a great privatisation programme and we're well down the</p>
<p>   track on that. And we set ourselves the goal of taxation reform.</p>
<p>   And I believe that that last mentioned goal of reforming Australia's</p>
<p>   taxation system is the greatest piece of unfinished economic reform</p>
<p>   business in Australia. The financial system was fixed in the 1980's.</p>
<p>   We are no longer a country that dwells behind high tariff barriers.</p>
<p>   We are a country which now has a more modern, contemporary, flexible</p>
<p>   industrial relations system. We have now recognised the wisdom of</p>
<p>   governments not running business enterprises that they are not equipped</p>
<p>   to run. But the last piece of really unfinished, big economic business</p>
<p>   in Australia is taxation reform. We have a responsibility to do</p>
<p>   it, despite the obstruction, despite the spoiling tactics of our</p>
<p>   opponents, we intend to proceed.</p>
<p>And finally can I pay a particular tribute to the work that Peter</p>
<p>   Costello as Treasurer has done, not only in preparing a large Budget</p>
<p>   but also in the work that he has done in preparing the two Budgets</p>
<p>   that went before it. And also because the Treasurer gets most of</p>
<p>   the headlines and all of the publicity on Budget night that I also</p>
<p>   pay a tribute to John Fahey as the Finance Minister who has worked</p>
<p>   so very, very closely with Peter in preparing the Budget. I believe</p>
<p>   that I am served by a very able group of Ministers. I think the</p>
<p>   Government that I lead has the best reform credentials of any government</p>
<p>   in the economic area since World War II. I made that claim a few</p>
<p>   weeks ago and I was criticised, not surprisingly, by some of my</p>
<p>   opponents for doing so. But I mean it very sincerely and if you</p>
<p>   look at the checklist, if you look at the reforms that have been</p>
<p>   undertaken over the last couple of years, I think they are plainly</p>
<p>   thought out. </p>
<p>But I haven't been able to do that alone. I've needed</p>
<p>   the assistance of a very able group of Ministers and particularly</p>
<p>   in this Budget week I pay tribute to Peter Costello's work</p>
<p>   as Treasurer. I pay tribute to the support that he's received</p>
<p>   from John Fahey and I want to thank all of my other Ministerial</p>
<p>   and Parliamentary colleagues, many of whom are here today for their</p>
<p>   tremendous help. And really finally can I thank all of you for the</p>
<p>   continued support you give to the Liberal Party, for the interest</p>
<p>   you display in our activity and I know the great encouragement you</p>
<p>   give to the party organisation which Michael Osborne and Remo Nogarotto</p>
<p>   as the President and the Director find so very helpful and so very</p>
<p>   encouraging. Thank you very much. </p>
