PRIME MINISTER<br />
New South Wales Bushfires<br />
The Prime Minister today expressed his concern<br />
at the extent to which bushfires had broken out in<br />
New South Wales this summer.<br />
In conveying his sympathy to bereaved families<br />
and to those injured and suffering property loss, Mr Fraser<br />
said that it was a tribute to the efforts of the many<br />
volunte-ers, fire fighters and service personnel who had<br />
been involved in the fire fighting operations that more<br />
damage to property and injury to life had not occurred.<br />
The Prime Minister went on to say that he had<br />
contacted the Premier of New South Wales and advised<br />
him that as well as the physical support already provided<br />
by the Defence force the Commonwealth stood ready to provide<br />
financial assistance to the Government of New South Wales<br />
under the terms and conditions of the Natural Disaster<br />
Assistance Arrangements should that prove necessary.<br />
