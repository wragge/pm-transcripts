    <content><![CDATA[<p> It is with great sadness that I learnt today of the death of Sir Mark Oliphant, an event which marks the passing of a great Australian, who was involved in one of the landmark scientific achievements of the twentieth century vis the splitting of the atom.</p>
<p>Sir Mark's distinguished academic career at home and overseas and a term as Governor of South Australia highlighted his contribution to the nation both as a scientist and public figure.</p>
<p>Born in South Australia and educated at Unley and Adelaide High Schools, and Adelaide University, Sir Mark became a Senior Scholar at Cambridge University and a fellow of the Royal Society of London in 1937.</p>
<p>It was early in his career, at Cambridge, that the then Mark Oliphant worked with the team at the Cavendish Laboratory which succeeded in 1932 in splitting the atom.</p>
<p>Sir Mark became a tireless campaigner against weapons of mass destruction after leading a team of British scientists to the USA in 1943 to work on development of the atomic bomb.</p>
<p>On his return to Australia in 1950 he became the founding Director of the Research School of Physical Sciences at the Australian National University in Canberra, a post he held until 1963.</p>
<p>He was the founding President of the Australian Academy of Science, and served as Head of the Department of Particle Physics at the ANU before returning to research.</p>
<p>Following retirement from the ANU Sir Mark performed distinguished service as Governor of South Australia from 1971-1976, and is fondly remembered for his contribution to public life in that role.</p>
<p>On behalf of myself, my wife Janette, and the Federal Government I extend deepest sympathies to Sir Mark's daughter Vivian Wilson, daughter-in-law Monica Oliphant, and their families.</p>
