FOURTEENTH COLOMBO PLAN CONFERENCE HELD IN<br />
MELBOURNE DURING OCTOBER NOVEMBER, 1962<br />
Consultative Coimittee Meetingheld on<br />
12th November 2<br />
Inauiural address by the Prime Minister, RtiHon, R. G, Menzies<br />
Mr. Chairman, ladies and gentlemen<br />
It gives me very great pleasure to welcome you<br />
all to Australia and to this Meeting,<br />
We played our own part at the time of the foundation<br />
of the Colombo Plan and since then we have maintained a very,<br />
very close interest in it, I don't think that anybody<br />
would have thought ten years ago that it could have reached<br />
such proportions as it now hasE or have been r. sponsible for<br />
so much assi. stance to new coun; ries as it has in fact<br />
provided over the last decadeo All this is very satisfactory,<br />
but it is ro real reason for us becoming smug or selfsatisfied<br />
because there is much to be done,<br />
One of the things that strikes the observer in<br />
recent times I'll say broadly in the period since the last<br />
war is that many countries have emerged into political<br />
independence, political independence being something very<br />
dear to the heart of man. but they have not necessarily at<br />
the same time emerged in6o economic independence. There<br />
are many politically independent countries in what is called<br />
the New World which still have great economic problems and<br />
one of the basic ideas of the Colombo Plan was, of course,<br />
to try to attack that problem by giving effective aid for<br />
the raising of economic standards and of living standards,<br />
but great difficulties have presented themselves.<br />
We have quite a few illustrations in these times<br />
of great financial aid being given to nations financial<br />
aid designed to help them to develop their own production<br />
and to export the products of their labours only to find<br />
that when they are ready to export them they are confronted<br />
by high tariff barriers or by fluctuating prices or by some<br />
other uncertainty in the world market which tends to defeat<br />
the effect of the aid that they have been given. This to<br />
me is one of the very great problems of our time. We discussed<br />
it in London at a Prime Ministers' Conference, It has been<br />
discussed elsewhere from time to time. I believe myself that<br />
there is a growing consciousness of this problem right round<br />
the world. For indeed it is quite clear, quite elementary<br />
indeed, that a nation which is, as I have described it, coming<br />
into the direction of economic independence striving to<br />
back its political independence with a genuine strength in its<br />
own country it is quite clear that that is a country that<br />
needs to be able to import capita] l goods.<br />
Even we in Australia who are, relatively speaking,<br />
a highly developed country and a highly industrialized one,<br />
still need capital beyond the amount that we can generate<br />
ourselves out of our own savings. Fortunately for us no<br />
doubt as the result of the resounding virtues of the Government<br />
we still receive year by year very large sums of capital inflow<br />
from other countries. If that is true of us it is doubly<br />
true about a great number of the countries represented here.<br />
They can't hope to produce all their capital from their<br />
internal efforts and therefore they must be able to get from<br />
overseas, capital, capital goods, capital equipment, of the<br />
* o / 2 </p>
<p>kind that they will need for developing the resources of their<br />
own country. And if they are to do that and not get these<br />
things merely as a donation forever then they must be able to<br />
earn these things by the export of their goods to the rest of<br />
the world, This is the final state of national dignity when<br />
each nation pays its way by selling to the world what it<br />
produces and getting from the world what it needs, and that's<br />
a tremendously important thing, not only economically but<br />
humanly and we have, as I am sure you have, time after time<br />
pointed out to some of the great industrial nations of the<br />
world how self-defeating it is to provide money even on the<br />
most lavish scale without contributing to a stability of<br />
world markets, an assurance of world markets, some guarantee<br />
that prices will be profitable prices, payable prices,<br />
This is of the essence, I believe, of any new<br />
economic world order and we must all work towards it. If we<br />
do, the Colombo Plan will increasingly find itself coming in<br />
aid of national development, a development soundly and hopefully<br />
to be engaged in because of the knowledge that what is<br />
produced will find a market in the world at a price which is<br />
adequate to the labour expended on it.<br />
I am a little optimistic about modern developments<br />
on this. In the London conference of Prime Ministers, a<br />
great deal of headway w'as made in relation to it. There has,<br />
I believe been a considerable amount of headway, though it is<br />
as yet a little indefinite, in discussions among the European<br />
powers. But increasingly we, and for that matter, most of<br />
the Prime Ministers who were at that conference, were convinced<br />
that the problem I have just been discussing is at the very<br />
heart of the developments of the next fifty years and, unless<br />
the problem is solved, such frustrations will be developed,<br />
such hostilities will be developed, that all the generosityinthe<br />
world will meet a poor response. The real generosity in the world,<br />
great as it has been in this Plan, onderful as it has been, the<br />
ultimate generosity will be the helping to establish new nations<br />
with proper markets'for wiihat they produce and steadily rising<br />
living standards. This will be the ultimate proof of what's done.<br />
Before I conclude Sir, I'd just like to say that<br />
there is another aspect of this matter, it's really another<br />
aspect of the same point, and it's this, There has boon for<br />
a long time in the world a tendency to classify nations as<br />
those who have and those who have not, and undoubtedly there<br />
has been a big gap between the standards of living of the<br />
heavily industrialized, capital-rich countries and those who<br />
are in a more nrimary state of development. The trouble is<br />
that that is a gap which tends to widen because the rate of<br />
advancement in countries of great technological skill is mo:: e<br />
rapid than the rate of advancement in countries engaged in<br />
primary industy. Therefore unless we watch it we will find that<br />
with all the goodwill in the world this is a gap which widens<br />
and if that gap widens too much then the tensions in the world,<br />
the hostilities, the misunderstandings will grow deeper and<br />
more serious, And the way in which to avoid that, of course,<br />
is again as I say, to take every conceivable step to add to the<br />
rate of economic growth in the nations which I have described<br />
as the newly-emerging nations of the modern world.<br />
Sir, I know you have all these things in mind3 in<br />
fact I rather gathered from one paper I saw that this is going<br />
/ 3 </p>
<p>3<br />
be among the thneom es that you consider on this occasion, and<br />
so I content myself having taken up your time to that extent<br />
by saying for myself and for the Government how delighted we<br />
are to see you here. Nobody would have expected ten years<br />
ago to see so many nations represented here, such a diversity<br />
of interest and of talent, and if, bet-woeeon all those things,<br />
you can't produce some results which will add to humanity,<br />
add to civilization, add to growth and brotherliness, then I<br />
shall be grievously disappointed.<br />
I welcome you very much, </p>
