PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 27 JUNE 19g0<br />
JOINT STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER AND THE MINISTER FOR<br />
IMMIGRATION, LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND ETHNIC AFFAIRS, MR HAND<br />
PRC nationals in Australia on 20 June 1989 will be able to<br />
stay in Australia for four years under a s pecial category of<br />
temporary residence permit. No PRC national in Australia on<br />
June 1989 will be required during the four years or<br />
subsequently to return to China against their will unless<br />
they have seriously breached Australian laws.<br />
Whether PRC nationals in this special category who wish to<br />
stay beyond the four years gain an extension of their<br />
temporary residence status or whether they gain permanent<br />
residence will depend upon conditions then prevailing in<br />
China. Unless we were confident that the situation in the<br />
PRC was such that human rights were no longer generally at<br />
risk, permanent residence would be granted to those who<br />
apply, subject to normal health And character checks. The<br />
timing of such a grant of permanent residence, will depend<br />
on the rate at which places can be provided in the<br />
immigration program at that stage, and in the meantime their<br />
temporary residence permits would be extended.<br />
In reaching this position the Government has had regard to<br />
the inherent uncertainty of developments in China over the<br />
coming years. The Government does not believe that PRC<br />
nationals in this group should be compelled to make<br />
decisions in the near future about their longer term plans<br />
in conditions of such uncertainty and risk. This decision<br />
therefore combines the government's humanitarian<br />
obligations to this group of people, with its responsibility<br />
to maintain control over the size and structure of<br />
Australia's immigration program in the national interest.<br />
The decision to allow four years' temporary residence to<br />
this group before considering the option of permanent<br />
residence will give these people a generous period in which<br />
to assess developments in their homeland before deciding<br />
whether they wish to return there, or stay in Australia. In<br />
making those decisions they will obviously be heavily<br />
influenced by developments in China over that time. But<br />
they will also be influenced by the pull of homeland, family<br />
and friends. Many may choose to leave Australia over the<br />
next four years. A good number has already done so. 8293 </p>
<p>The special four-year permit will carry the same conditions<br />
as those applying to the permits to be granted to those<br />
given refugee and humanitarian status under the new Asylum<br />
policy announced today. Holders of the special permits will<br />
be allowed to work. They will be entitled to lodge<br />
sponsorship for their spouses and dependent children after 1<br />
February 1991. The Government will now be considering in<br />
detail the terms attaching to the temporary residence<br />
permits to be held by this group, including such issues as<br />
access to income support, health services and labour<br />
market/ training programs. An announcement on these matters<br />
will be made soon, after Cabinet consideration.<br />
Chinese nationals in Australia on 20 June may apply for the<br />
special four-year permit from 1 August 1990, when the<br />
regulation creating the category will come into force.<br />
They will not need to seek refugee or humanitarian status<br />
to qualify for the special four-year permit, and those who<br />
have already sought such status should seriously consider<br />
withdrawing those applications and apply instead for the<br />
special permit. There are long processing queues for<br />
residence on refugee or humanitarian grounds, and while in<br />
the queue, applicants will not have the sponsorship rights<br />
of those in the special group.<br />
Tertiary students in Australia on 20 June 1989 can apply for<br />
the balance of the four years at the conclusion of their<br />
courses. The same applies to PRC nationals in Australia on<br />
June who are unsuccessful in their applications for<br />
permanent residence.<br />
PRC nationals who arrived in Australia after 20 June 1990<br />
will not be entitled to the special four-year permit. The<br />
government assumes they will return home when their entry<br />
permits expire, like any other temporary residents.<br />
These people went through revised exit procedures before<br />
leaving China, and they entered Australia on a temporary<br />
basis, in full knowledge of the conditions in their country.<br />
Anybody who arrived after 20 June 1989 who believes he or<br />
she has particular claims is of course entitled to apply for<br />
refugee or humanitarian status but such claims will be<br />
assessed on a case by case basis.<br />
