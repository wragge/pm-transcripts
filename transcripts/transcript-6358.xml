PRIME MINISTER<br />
SPEECH NOTES FOR THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
FEDERAL CHAMBER OF AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRIES<br />
CANBERRA 5 APRIL 1984<br />
I am pleased to attend this dinner tonight with<br />
delegates from the automotive industry in Australia<br />
Representing motor car and component producers,<br />
importers and distributors<br />
The motor car industry holds an important position in<br />
the Australian economy and industry structure<br />
In 1981/ 82, motor vehicle and component production<br />
along with vehicle distribution and sales employed<br />
more than 150,000 people<br />
and contributed over $ 3,600 million to GDP<br />
The motor vehicle also holds a special place in<br />
Australian society<br />
As our fundamental means of transport in a big<br />
country where large distances need to be covered<br />
It is not surprising, therefore, that my Government<br />
would wishes to ensure that we have a healthy automotive<br />
industry providing up-to-date vehicles at competitive<br />
prices The motor vehicle industry, in Australia and overseas,<br />
has been required to meet three great structural<br />
challenges over the last ten years. These are:<br />
A rapid and enormous rise in the price of petrol<br />
and as a result a swing in demand to smaller, more<br />
fuel-efficient cars<br />
The strong penetration of overseas markets by<br />
Japanese vehicle producers<br />
The huge escalation in costs in bringing a single<br />
new vehicle model into production </p>
<p>The industry throughout the world has responded by<br />
massive adjustment in its activities<br />
Through internationalisation of vehicle production:<br />
common basic designs for cars are produced in a<br />
number of countries, concentrating vehicle and<br />
component production where cost advantages are<br />
greatest By huge re-investment programs: for example, the<br />
United States motor vehicle industry is estimated<br />
to spend more than $ US8O billion in 1985 to meet<br />
the Japanese challenge<br />
Through rationalisation of production by company<br />
mergers and co-operation in design and production.<br />
As well, the industry is moving into new technologies,<br />
and this trend is expected to grow strongly in future<br />
years This includes new materials, such as plastics and<br />
ceramics in vehicles<br />
And use of robots and other advanced machinery in<br />
production.<br />
In these ways the industry is restructuring not only to<br />
meeting present challenges but to address the issues of<br />
the future This will contribute to guaranteeing the industry's<br />
viability in the longer term<br />
And assist in achieving higher standards of living<br />
for the whole community.<br />
As I have said on a number of occasions, the Government<br />
is committed to facilitating structural change in the<br />
economy To reinforce prospects for sustained medium to<br />
longer term economic growth<br />
And to provide enhanced employment opportunities<br />
and improved living standards<br />
I would emphasise that in approaching structural change<br />
in industry the Government does not intend imposing<br />
policies arbitrarily<br />
We seek an ongoing dialogue with the community as a<br />
whole and industry members in particular to assist<br />
in encouraging a more favourable climate for change<br />
and in developing suitable mechanisms for<br />
adjustment </p>
<p>The steel industry plan is an example of the<br />
Government's co-operative approach<br />
Entailing contributions from Government, business<br />
and unions.<br />
The Government is convinced of the need for increasing<br />
change in the Australian motor vehicle industry to<br />
ensure it becomes more internationally competitive<br />
Without change<br />
Australian consumers will continue to be<br />
disadvantaged by high prices for motor<br />
vehicles Australians will suffer lower incomes because*<br />
resources are not used wisely in producing<br />
several, low volume models and<br />
other parts of the economy will be<br />
disadvanataged by inefficiencies in the<br />
industry<br />
The Australian motor vehicle industry must confront the<br />
need for change<br />
indeed, some rationalisaton has already occurred in<br />
the component industry<br />
But as commentators have pointed out, existing policy on<br />
the industry has not been as successful as it might have<br />
been Protection provided to the industry has increased<br />
and yet employment has fallen and the<br />
competitiveness of the industry appears to have<br />
stagnated.<br />
Indeed the increase in protection levels over the last<br />
decade has removed some of the impetus for gradual<br />
adjustment. The Government aims to promote reductions in the costs<br />
of producing vehicles in Australia. In part this will<br />
mean reductions in protection levels towards the<br />
manufacturing industry average consistent with the<br />
maintenance of motor vehicle production at around its<br />
present level<br />
The Government will be seeking gradual but<br />
consistent changes which take into consideration<br />
the costs of adjustment<br />
We also aim to establish a stable policy<br />
environment within which companies can invest with<br />
confidence for the future </p>
<p>4.<br />
Accordingly, the Government is presently reviewing the<br />
assistance arrangements for the industry after 1984 when<br />
the present arrangements expire<br />
Our deliberations will be aided by the report of<br />
the Car Industry Council as well as the IAC Report<br />
on assistance for light commercial vehicle<br />
production<br />
In making our decisions we will be taking into account<br />
the views of all parties<br />
We will be guided by our desire to foster a n<br />
outward-looking, efficient and competitive economic<br />
environment<br />
We expect the Australian Motor Vehicl~ e Industry to<br />
continue to make a very significant contribution to our<br />
economy and general well-being<br />
For its part, the Government is working to remove<br />
obstacles to progress<br />
In this way we look forward to a continued major<br />
contribution from the Motor Vehicle ' Industry to<br />
Australia-Is continued economic prosperity. </p>
