FOR MEDIA WEDNESDAY OCTOBER 27 1982<br />
DROUGHT RELIEF MEASURES QUEENSLAND AND SOUTH AUSTRALIA<br />
I have today written to the Premiers of Queensland and<br />
South Australia indicating that the Commonwealth has approved<br />
for inclusion in the natural disaster relief arrangements<br />
certain new relief measures requested by those States.<br />
Under the arrangements, expenditure by the State on approved<br />
measures above its base amount for a financial year<br />
million for Queensland and $ 3 million for South Australia)<br />
is eligible for Commonwealth assistance on a $ 3 Connonwealth<br />
to $ 1 State basis.<br />
For Queensland the Commonwealth has agreed to provide<br />
financial assistance under the arrangements for the<br />
construction by local authorities of simple bulk storage<br />
facilities for molasses in drought affected areas in<br />
Western Queensland. These facilities, to be constructed<br />
adjacent to railway lines, will enable more efficient bulk<br />
transport of molasses to be used as fodder for livestock<br />
in remote areas. This measure will also have longer term<br />
benefits extending beyond the duration of the current drought.<br />
In addition, the Commonwealth has agreed to provide financial<br />
assistance under the natural disaster relief arrangements for<br />
a measure to provide low interest loans for horticultural -crop<br />
growers in the Mundubbera-Gayndah area, where severe losses have<br />
been caused by frost damage in association with low rainfall.<br />
The Government has also agreed to a request by the South<br />
Australian Government that expenditure on relief measures<br />
for frost damage in the SA Riverland in June be considered<br />
as eligible for Commonwealth assistance under the natural<br />
disaster relief arrangements.<br />
Assistance to orchardists for frost damage has not previously<br />
been an eligible measure under the arrangements, but the<br />
Commonwealth has agreed to it in these instances as a special<br />
measure because of the severity of the,* frost damage and in<br />
recognition of the serious difficulties . facing rural industries<br />
at the present time. It is not to be seen as a precedent for<br />
the future.<br />
These measures are additional to those previously announced for<br />
the current drought. I am pleased to note that both States have<br />
substantially implemented the proposals made by the Commonwealth<br />
for extensions to the range and levels of the relief measures<br />
undeXz the natural disaster relief arrangements.<br />
