F76/ 80<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR PRESS 7 May 1976<br />
THE TODD PAPERS<br />
, The Todd papers which were tabled yesterday make it<br />
quite plain that whoever Mr Todd is he was commissioned<br />
by Mr Bjelke-Petersen without any authority from myself<br />
or ftom the Commonwealth.<br />
From the moment I received a Commission from the<br />
Governor-General on 11 November last year the terms of<br />
that Commission were observed scrupulously.<br />
Appropriate instructions were given to the relevant<br />
people overseas. Our Ambassador in Switzerland was instructed<br />
to have nothing to do with the investigations'being<br />
carried out on behalf of the Queensland Government.<br />
This was reported at the time.<br />
