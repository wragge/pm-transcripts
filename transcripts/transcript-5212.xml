FOR. MEDIA FRIDAY, DECEMBER 7 1979<br />
PREMIERS' CONFERENCE DISCUSSION<br />
ON AUSTRALIA/ JAPAN RELATION~ S<br />
The Premiers' Conference today discussed Australian relations<br />
with Japan in the context of the great and growing importance<br />
of Japan to Australia and the extensive involvement of Japan<br />
in the economies of the Australian States.<br />
The meeting recalled that the Ad H1oc Working Group on<br />
Australia/ Japan Relations ( the Myer Committee), which reported<br />
to the Commonwealth Government in September 1977, had emphasised<br />
the positive contribution which Australia's federal structure<br />
can make in enhancing the relationship with japan. The Report<br />
noted the-desirability of seeking to achieve a suitable<br />
co-ordination of broad national aims with specific State<br />
expertise. In announcing the Commonwealth Government' s acceptance of this<br />
Report on 30 May 1978, the Prime Minister undertook to. meet<br />
Premiers to clarify areas of responsibility and explore<br />
better means of improving co-ordination.<br />
In discussions today, the Premiers' Conference agreed that<br />
there was a clear and growing need for consultations between<br />
the Commonwealth and the States on the various aspects of the<br />
relationship. To meet this need, it was agreed that there<br />
should be consultations at least annually on relations with<br />
Japan.<br />
These consultations would focus on the broad political and<br />
economic relationship, and would in no way cut across existing<br />
Commonwealth/ State consultative machinery.<br />
The Premiers' Conference concluded that these agreed measures<br />
demonstrated a shared concern to see relations with Australia's<br />
largest trading partner maintained and strengthened. </p>
