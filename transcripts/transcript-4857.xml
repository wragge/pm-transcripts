PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR PRESS 22 OCTOBER 1978<br />
ELECTORATE TALK<br />
shortly, the Primary Industry Bank of Australia will begin<br />
processing its first applications from farmers for long term<br />
loans. The establishment of the bank fulfills a pledge by the Government<br />
to cater for the special credit needs of rural Australia.<br />
Access to long term capital on suitable terms had become a<br />
serious problem for the family farm. With the commercial market<br />
unable to meet this need a new and unique insitituion was<br />
required. While the demand for credit for capital expenditure and working<br />
capital has grown significantly over recent years, many producers<br />
because of depressed markets, adverse seasons or possibly both<br />
experienced great difficulty in increasing their earnings to the<br />
stage where they can either finance investment from their income<br />
or prove themselves sound borrowers.<br />
Denied access to long term finance, farmers often had to postpone<br />
vital investment decisions essential to the long term viability<br />
of their properties. They were also less equipped to ride out<br />
those recurring periods of low market returns.<br />
The Government realised that to provide farmers with long term<br />
loans at suitable terms a special institution was required. The<br />
Primary Industry Bank is the result of a long period of research<br />
and negotiation. It combines both government and private funds<br />
to lengthen the term of loans and reduce the interest rate.<br />
The Board of the Bank brings together people with wide experience<br />
in financial and agricultural policy fields and in farming itself.<br />
The two farmer representatives on the Board will make sure that<br />
the interests of farmers are heard.<br />
As announced by the Minister for Primary Industry and the Treasurer,<br />
the new Bank will be making loans available to farmers and I<br />
should also include fishermen and foresters for periods of<br />
eight to thirty years at an interest rate of only 10.5% for loans<br />
under $ 100,000. A rate of 12.5% will be charged on loans above<br />
$ 100,000. The loans will be on terms and conditions considerably<br />
more favourable to the borrower than normally available from<br />
commercial sources. / 2 </p>
<p>Primary producers will now be able to finance farm investments<br />
on a loan term more appropriate to the expected life of the<br />
investment. It is significant that longer term loans reduce the annual amount<br />
farmers must put aside each year for debt servicing.<br />
For example, the annual payment of principal and interest on<br />
a $ 30,000 loan at 10.5% over eight years is $ 5,726. But over<br />
years the annual payment is only $ 3,645, a reduction of<br />
just over $ 2,000 a year.<br />
The Bank will not only provide longer term funds for the rural<br />
community but will be the means of replenishing supplies of<br />
rural credit available form non-government sources.<br />
Over the past ten years there has been an enormous increase in<br />
government funding of the rural sector debt.<br />
Currently, some $ 1,000 m. or 35% of rural indebtedness to<br />
institutional lenders is covered by funds directly advanced by<br />
the Commonwealth Government. This represents an increase in<br />
excess of 60% in government lending since 1970, during a period<br />
when a number of institutions such as pastoral houses,<br />
insurance companies and the trustee houses have withdrawn<br />
loan funds from the rural sector.<br />
The Government strongly believes in providing the opportunity<br />
for farmers to obtain their credit needs on conditions of<br />
repayment which enable them to plan long term investment<br />
programmes. The Primary Industry Bank will provide this facility and by<br />
using funds raised commercially in its lending operations the<br />
Bank could well boost the aggregate flow of credit to the rural<br />
sector. I believe that, through the operations of the Bank, the family<br />
farm will be able to look to the future with great confidence. </p>
