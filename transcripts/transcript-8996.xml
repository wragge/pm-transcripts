PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW WITH TIE PR[ ME MMSTER, THE EON.<br />
P. J. KEATING, MP.<br />
PERT WESTERN AUSTRALIA<br />
SUNDAY 10 OCTOBER, 1993<br />
J: Mr Keatin&amp; do you think your isiz to West= ui Australia has achieved<br />
anythilic<br />
PM; I think so. I think, amoWt other thin&amp; i I bad a chance to talk to the public and<br />
to talk to my own Party last night at a very large fncdon, and to run rough<br />
the big issue. I had a ' ezy good talk to Carmn LAwrence as well as the<br />
Premier and so, I think it has been wothwble. I also bad the pleasure this<br />
morting of being involved with the Royal Flyiig Doctor appeal<br />
On otto of the major issues between us that I si! oke to Premier Court about<br />
yesterday we should correct the impression in Western Agauab that this is a<br />
matter between the Cozmnonwealth Gvonvxwtnt and the State Govenunen;<br />
that this is a maner which the Comtnwealth Governmenw is ying to push<br />
onto the State Government. Thau is not so. Ttis is a matter of mstalihn law.<br />
This is a matter of the High Court of Autrali dcidin8 that thee is a native title<br />
in the common law. And the Western Aura! ian Government has got to come<br />
to tmswith dat Thve gotd toe d de wbal: 1hey want to do about that.<br />
We're saying that what we have is a scheme, te best possible scheme to deal<br />
with it And tostay out of it sirmly mea u grt eat uctainty would obtain<br />
in Western Australia. So, this is notia soxt of igassic Commonwealth/ Stue<br />
matter of Perth verua Canberm This is Paet versus the igh Co4IT of<br />
Austraa. This is what this is and I think all Weiten Australians should<br />
ndersmand this. That the problems that c= ariSe from this because of the Sawe<br />
Govenmentrs iansienee with the Ibh Crnt decision with the dccision of<br />
the highest court in our land. Now what Im trying to do is to fnd a solution for<br />
verybody in tha decision. And it's not Canbffm seeking to impose anmhing<br />
an the State, but the State in avmyu4eal way not recognisiig die<br />
supremracy and prniacy of the High Court of Australia.<br />
I: Inaudible.. </p>
<p>TEL 2<br />
PM: Wel4 I di inre Praier knows that hcan go onaboftand nojoinxthe<br />
Commonwealth and other states in this remember there are othe Coalition<br />
govmrments involved in ts, these discussions. He can not join them but how<br />
does he resolve the problem for Western Australian people? How does he<br />
resolv the problem for the Western Austaia ri~ itin industry, the W4: stcn<br />
Australian pastoral industry, for the Western Aiztraian Ab~ original co! munity,<br />
for the Western Australian people? I mean, tis is somethng I have arrived<br />
here saying " Look Permier, I have a scheme hetea which I think will work for<br />
you here, well. Now, why don't you sit down orid talk to us about this scheme?<br />
But if you don't want to talk at all, the Froh Court's decision is going to stand.<br />
But what would happen is there would be nio ceitainty of title for the big mining<br />
operations some of them aud for pastoral ltases arid it is up to the Premier<br />
to get a soluton.<br />
MrC1 ourt sems to think though. that ther could be a High Court challenge to<br />
your legislation. He has not riled tha out this mlomni&amp;<br />
PM: Yes. but the 9i4h Court is not going to challenge its own decision.<br />
1: On Land administration on the States right.<br />
PM! This is not a matter of States rights. This is a matter of the rogts of Aboriginal<br />
people who are Zvennativetifle inthe common law. This is therghrt of<br />
Abofignal people im thii country who our highv,; cowlt has * ven a nativ ttl<br />
inthe connonaw and no appeal othe Ith C,) isgoing to get ovcr that<br />
principal fact. Now, whatwve wil tyand do isI. gislatea scheme that ataf<br />
makes it work. It has become very bard going comning over to a state sTaIg<br />
" Look here we are to help yoo. Here is the Cozamonwealth, government and<br />
other states with a scheme to help you out of the hole you are and the state<br />
saYiIIg " No. no, we don't want to be he~ pe&amp; We; will take mayhem instead."<br />
There miust be a scheme of arrangement for Wc-aen Australia or otherwise,<br />
Aborigina people will just take their land claims to the High Court.<br />
J: Has anythng changed as a result of your weeken d visit here?<br />
PM: WelI dre Premierknow ft besa g ot dIoea l wi he national<br />
goverment. That this idea that it is sort of Wes tern Australia versus the rest of<br />
Austa. ia not just Canberra but every other State -reafly is not very<br />
tenabhle,<br />
J: But Mr Court argues that Western Australia is the s= at most affocted by this<br />
decision and tft it really doesn't malter int other states like Virton; A.<br />
TiEiL:. Oct. 93 8: 29 No. 001 P. 02/ lU </p>
<p>TEL: 1I. Oct. 93 8: 29 No. 001 P. 03/ 10<br />

PA; It will matter less in Victoia but it MUl matter gratly in Queensland. It wMl<br />
matter substantiafly in South Australia. It is not a matter of whether the High<br />
Coutt under our Contitution enjoys sovureignty in these matters. it Ias decided<br />
there Is a natie tifle in the commoni law. If Abo riginal people cAn mount a<br />
native title clam. on land which is now Crowni lAd that land will become native<br />
tite land.<br />
Now, there is nothfing that the Premier can do atbout that other than to work out<br />
how he wishes to run the state. It is no good sa5i4 " We are affected more." It<br />
is not a matter of who is affected more. It is a ftatter of whether the decision is<br />
right; and whether tho-th ' Jm1a AyVm1-t1A a Tt ink itil<br />
the fight decision, so now an! or us Piave got to nmaie it wontK im not me r tr y<br />
and push something down t Premies nieck I am invitin him into a scheme<br />
of arrangement which is good for Western AustialiA, good for Australimn<br />
generally.<br />
J: Do you find M~ r Courfs position ftustrating?<br />
PM; 1 Whnk that you can run this argument for Ion enough., that this is a matter for<br />
the people of Perth and Western Australia versus, the rest of Au~ tra~ ia. Unti the<br />
people of Perth and Western Australia understand that the Prcemier is running<br />
Them up a blind alley, that there is a Hig Court Jecision and it is the law of % he<br />
land all this land including Western Australia and it has to be dealt with.<br />
And the onlcheeodeal w it isthe onewichs in the hands of the<br />
federal government.<br />
J: Are you disappointed that some of the Abongic s you met with~ yesterday ane<br />
sayn that the meeting acieved nothing?<br />
IM: If you get ten Aboriginal people together and say what was thc outcome of the<br />
meeting you will get ten different anwers most likely. And you wil never get<br />
unanimnity. But, again, there is I think a much be ttr understanding and some<br />
very positive responses to the discussions I had. I don't know that a lot of<br />
Aborigina people particularly from the outstations really understand what Mabo,<br />
means to thein and when they have tho opportumity of talking to somebody lie<br />
me and have it explained to them some things become more clear. Now the<br />
Aboriginal community has got its professional, cynics thc same as the non<br />
Aboriginal community but so wbat<br />
