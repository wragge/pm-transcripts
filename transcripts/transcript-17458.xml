Prime Minister Julia Gillard and Minister for Foreign Affairs Kevin Rudd today welcomed the release of Aung San Suu Kyi from house arrest on behalf of the Australian people.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister said the nation had the greatest admiration for Aung San Suu Kyi, who has become the symbol of the struggle for democracy and freedom in Burma.</p>
<p>Aung San Suu Kyi paid a heavy price for advocating freedom, having spent 15 of the last 21 years in detention.</p>
<p>Her detention was completely unjustified and release long overdue . The Government condemned her most recent conviction and sentencing in August 2009 in the strongest of terms.</p>
<p>Minister for Foreign Affairs Kevin Rudd said the Government was seeking an early opportunity to speak with Aung San Suu Kyi, to convey Australia's support for her and her struggle for democracy in Burma.</p>
<p>We will closely monitor her situation, including any restrictions imposed on her freedom of movement or association.</p>
<p>Australia continues to call on the Burmese authorities to immediately and unconditionally release the more than 2000 political prisoners still detained in Burma.</p>
<p>We also call on the Burmese authorities to embark on an inclusive and genuine process of national reconciliation and engage in dialogue with all of Burma's ethnic groups.</p>
<p>The release of Aung San Suu Kyi offers the Burmese authorities an opportunity to move the country forward. Australia calls on Burma to grasp the chance to make genuine progress towards democracy and greater international engagement. </p>
