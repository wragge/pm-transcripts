Australia-China Clean Coal Initiative, Australia-China Free Trade Agreement,   North Korea, East Asia Summit</p>
<p>E&amp;OE...</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister what was top of the agenda this morning?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well the two big subjects discussed were the working group on clean coal technology, and we've agreed to details of that, and I've put out a statement and the Chinese will be doing the same, announcing the establishment of the group. This is an area where Australia and China have common interests. It's in the future interests of both countries that we develop clean coal technology and we'll work together in so many different ways in order to bring that about and the group will report to the respective ministers. The second issue we discussed was the strong commitment we both have to achieving a good outcome through the Free Trade Agreement negotiations. Now I stress again that Australia already has a very good trade relationship with China, but we should seek to make it better and both of us reaffirmed our personal commitments on each side to bring about a good result. The eighth negotiating session will commence in Beijing in about two months time. It could take longer still. I think the next session will deal with matters of investment. It's not an easy negotiation on either side because there are sensitivities in sectors in both China and Australia. The important thing is that there is high level political commitment to trying to achieve a good outcome. I'm prepared to put the effort in, as is Mr Truss, the Minister for Trade, and I am quite satisfied that both President Hu Jintao and the Premier, Mr Wen Jiabao are also very strongly committed. The other matters that we touched on briefly of course were...included North Korea. And we both reaffirmed our desire that this be successfully dealt with. It's not easy. The right contexts are the Six Party talks and it's important that pressure be maintained on North Korea to comply with the provisions of the Security Council resolution. They were the main issues discussed. I think it's fair to say that both the Premier and I agree that relations between the two countries are in very good shape. We meet at a high level very regularly. I met the President at the APEC meeting, had an extensive bilateral with him there. I was in China myself earlier during last year and the Premier, he came to Canberra in March of last year and we keep in touch on a very regular basis. It's a relationship that bulks very large in Australia's considerations.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister did you get any feeling from the Chinese about them adopting a 16 member ASEAN trade block?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>We didn't talk about that.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister the clean coal technology, how committed do you think the Chinese are towards cleaner coal bearing in mind the size of the economy?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well they recognise, as we do, the value of reducing greenhouse gas emissions when using coal. China is at a different stage of development from Australia. We have to understand that. We have grown our economy and enjoyed a rise in wealth and productivity off the back of coal, which is now regarded as emitting far too many greenhouse gas emissions, and we have to understand the feeling of countries like China that are at a different stage of development. But that doesn't alter the fact that if we approach the thing in a constructive fashion and try and work together and pool our experience, pool our knowledge, then that can be of benefit to both countries.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister you mentioned in the early stages of the meeting that you didn't go for your walk this morning, was that because of security?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I never talk about those things, accept I remain a dedicated early morning walker.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>So does the Chinese Premier.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well he is.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>The FTA negotiations, what are the challenges there? It must be an enormous challenge dealing with such a huge economic superpower?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well there are sensitivities on both sides and the important thing is that there is high level political and professional commitment to bringing about a good outcome. And I'm not going to say more than that at this stage. It's a hard task. There are sensitivities on both sides and we both must work very hard towards achieving an outcome. </p>
