<p>E&amp;OEâ¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Will you be advising Mr Reith to repay the entire $50,000?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>The position, Allison, is that weâve sent it to the Solicitor-General. Weâll see what the Solicitor-General has to say. I believe in doing these things one step at a time. The right procedure has been followed. We had a police investigation â it said no prosecutions. Weâve now asked the Solicitor-General to give an opinion. You can interview me again when we have the opinion of the Solicitor-General. The only other point Iâd make is this. At no stage has Mr Reith personally benefited from what has occurred. There seems to be a mistaken view in the minds of many that he has got $50,000 that heâs not entitled to. Whatâs happened is that, in circumstances that I do not know and nobody seems to know fully, this card has been improperly used. Now heâs acknowledged an error in relation to his son. There have been denials made by his son about the disclosure of details to other people. But I do emphasise that at no stage has Mr Reith got a dollar out of this and where there is clear evidence of use in relation to his son he has paid that money. So the idea that heâs pocketed $50,000 and he should repay something he shouldnât have got is not an accurate reflection.</p>
<p>Having said all of that, I as a taxpayer am angry about it and I understand why Australians are angry that $50,000 one way or another should have been racked up and theyâre left with the bill. I understand that. I just ask them to accept that Iâm approaching the matter very conscientiously. Iâm following the right procedures. Iâm trying to get to the bottom of what has occurred. Iâm trying to establish whether there is a legal liability in civil law. When I have the answers to those questions Iâll say something further.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>When do you expect to get the Solicitor-Generalâs advice and will you be publicly releasing it when you get it?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I donât know when Iâll get the advice. All I know is that the Solicitor-General is an independent adviser to the Government and I donât put deadlines on him. It wouldnât be proper to do so. I imagine that he will prepare the advice as promptly as the circumstances allow but I donât think itâs right to breath down his neck and Iâm not going to do that. I donât think itâs right to try and set a deadline. Heâs an independent adviser. Heâs an eminent Queenâs Counsel, widely respected in the legal profession, and Iâm quite certain his advice will be worth reading and worth understanding. You asked me what I will do with the advice. Well, I havenât seen it yet and I donât know what form itâs going to be delivered in. What I can assure you of is this â I will handle that matter in the appropriate correct fashion.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>You acknowledge public concern about the political saga, the episode. How much political damage is being caused to your Government?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Look I havenât sort of sat down and tried to assess that. What you do in something like this Alison is to try and handle it correctly. I want the Australian public to know that I understand their anger that they might be left with a bill for $50,000 which is not their fault. I want them also to accept that Mr Reith hasnât got that $50,000 â itâs $50,000 of unauthorised use in circumstances weâre not completely aware of. So donât anybody imagine that Iâm not mindful of the public anger about this and I donât like it either. Itâs $50,000 that shouldnât have been racked up on his bill but he didnât get the money. Itâs not like somebody whoâs claimed a benefit to which theyâre not entitled, whether theyâre a member of Parliament or a member of the public, because theyâve actually been enriched by an amount they are not entitled to. In this case that hasnât occurred so Mr Reith hasnât got the $50,000 in his pocket. Nonetheless I understand why people are saying well we donât quite know what the circumstances are but we shouldnât have to pay. I understand that people feel that way and I sympathise with them.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, in light of that public concern though, isnât it time for you to stand down your Minister while the Solicitor-General considers the matter?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, that is not the right thing to do. That has never happened. Normally what occurs is that while something is being investigated, the Minister continues and itâs only if a charge is brought that the Minister stands down. That is a practice that is normally followed on both sides of politics. Oppositions always call for people to be stood down. Itâs never appropriate to stand someone down unless a charge has been made. Mr Reith has acknowledged that he shouldnât have given the details to his son. I donât think he should have either. That was a foolish thing to do but he did it for the best of parental motives. However, heâs identified expenditure that flowed from that in relation to his son and heâs paid that money. The rest of the money we donât precisely know at this stage who is responsible for that and, as I say, we will get the Solicitor-Generalâs advice and I will then have something more to say. Thank you.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Last night you indicated your support for the Chief Minister. Does that mean you also support a government which broke a law and illegally spent millions of taxpayer dollars?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I support the present government because itâs been a good government for the ACT. I donât automatically accept your analysis of what happened in relation to the Bruce Stadium.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Iâm sorry, thatâs not my analysis. Thatâs the Auditor-Generalâs analysis...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well there are different people who have different analyses of the Auditor-Generalâs report. Speaking of the question that we all have to address and that is who will make the better government for the ACT? I believe a Liberal government led by Mrs Carnell will make a better government than a Labor government and thatâs why I said what I did last night and I stand by every word of it.</p>
