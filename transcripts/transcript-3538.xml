PRESS STATEMENT NO. 407<br />
9 December 1974<br />
Report Tyre Cord and Tyre Cord<br />
Fabric<br />
The Prime Minister, Mr Whitlam,. announced today<br />
that as a long term objective the Government has accepted the<br />
recommendations of the Industries Assistance Commission in its<br />
report on Tyre Cord and Tyre Cord Fabric.<br />
Mr Whitlam said that in view of current economic<br />
conditions and the possible employment consequences of introduction<br />
of the reduced duties recommended by the Commission, at this time,<br />
the Government considered that the recommended duty rate would<br />
best be phased in. The Government's decision was also made<br />
having regard to the Commission's supplementary recommendations<br />
received on 26 November 1974.<br />
Implementation of the Government's decision will<br />
mean in the case of viscose tyre cord fabric, current duties<br />
will continue until 31 December 1976 and then reduce to<br />
General until 31 December 1977 and then further reduce to the<br />
rate of 15%. General recommended by the Commission. In the case<br />
of other tyre cord fabrics, the current rates of duty will be<br />
increased to the Commnission's supplementary recommended rate<br />
General until 31 December 1975 then be reduced to the rate<br />
of 15% General recommended by the Commission in its report.<br />
In respect of viscose tyre cord fabric the Government<br />
did not implement the Commission's supplementary recommended rate<br />
as Courtaulds is already receiving assistance of $ 200,000 under<br />
the Special Assistance for Non-l Metropolitan Areas scheme which<br />
was announced by the Minister for Manufacturing Industry on<br />
21 November 1974. A detailed statement of the Customs tariff changes<br />
arising from the Government's decision will be issued by the<br />
Minister for Customs and Excise when arrangements have been<br />
finalised to implement the new duty rates.<br />
