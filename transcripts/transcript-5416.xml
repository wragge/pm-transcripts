PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MED IA WEDNESDAY, 13 AUGUST, 1980<br />
OPENING OF EUROBODALLA SHIRE COUNCIL,<br />
NEW HEADQUARTERS, MORUYA, N. S. W.<br />
Thank you for the invitation to be with you on this<br />
important occasion. And thank you also, for your warm and<br />
generous welcome.<br />
I am told it is more than a generation since you were<br />
visite-d by a Prime Minister, and I an certainly pleased to<br />
renew the association. You need no telling that this is a<br />
favourite refuge for Canberra visitors during weekends and<br />
holidays. Since many of your visitors are public servants,<br />
escaping the hard grind of government, perhaps I'should<br />
claim some credit for your tourist boom. But I suspect the<br />
popularity of the area has much more to do with its great<br />
natural beauty and the amenities which serve the community<br />
so well. Now, to these amenities is added this new Shire<br />
Headquarters, climaxing a long and sustained period of<br />
development in Eurobodalla Shire.<br />
Economic growth and development are important elements to our<br />
future ' well-being as a nation; and it is a delight to be here<br />
in one of the fastest growing shires in New South Wales.<br />
I know that this growth has placed great demands on local,<br />
government administration. It has called for additional<br />
services water, sewerage, roads and bridges. And these<br />
have been provided. But the Commonwealth's commitment to local<br />
government is not based solely on the ability of local<br />
authorities to provide efficient services.<br />
In a country of Australia's size, local government is essential<br />
for the development of community identity. They are very often<br />
the driving force behind community spirit. And it is this<br />
identification with the community that enables local government<br />
to be responsive to community needs. These needs can * not be<br />
adequately met by remote and bureaucratic structures. They<br />
almost always depend for their solution on local understanding<br />
and local action. That is why my Government is dedicated to<br />
the decentralisation of decision-making, especially in decisions<br />
involving local government.<br />
We are committed to the creation of a genuine partnership<br />
between Federal, State and local government; and we have<br />
translated that commitment into action. In 1976, we introduced<br />
legislation to give both the States and local government a<br />
guaranteed share of personal income tax, without strings attached.<br />
SIR q--otr"-Rcy y4s,_, tr&gt; </p>
<p>-2<br />
Last year, we increased the local government share from the<br />
original 1.52%/ to 1.75%. Now we have raised it to fulfilling<br />
an undertaking that I gave before the last election.<br />
Last week, the Secretary of the Local Government Association<br />
of New South Wales, described the measure as, " the most<br />
signfi cant financial' development i. n local government this<br />
century." In money terms, this has meant an increase in general<br />
purpose assistance to local government from about $ 80 million<br />
in 1975-76, to over $ 300 million this year.<br />
And it means a very great deal more in terms of local<br />
government being master of its own affairs, not simply an arm<br />
of State or Federal Government. It enables local authorities<br />
to plan ahead with assurance, and to choose their own priorities.<br />
I know that road development is an issue of real concern to<br />
local authorities, and I know also that your concern is even<br />
greater, dependent as you are almost wholly on road transport.<br />
The Co= monwealth views Australia's road development as a matter<br />
of high priority. At the recent Premiers' Conference, we<br />
announced that $ 3.65 billion would be provided in grants to the<br />
States and the Northern Territory for roadworks during the<br />
next-five years. And we have effected a significant shift in<br />
emphasis towards local road funding.<br />
In 1975-76 this occupied about 18% of the total allocation<br />
for roads. In the coming year, local road funding stands<br />
at 24% of the total Cornonwealth provision. Of course, your<br />
ultimate fate is in the hands of the New South Wales Government,<br />
and I hope your representations thare receive a sympathetic<br />
hearing. The Commonwealth has always been pleased to play its role in<br />
the provision of very important services arising out of local<br />
growth and development. As a result, out of a total cost of<br />
$ 1.45 million for the Eurobodalla Shire Nursing Home at<br />
Dalmeny, we will contribute $ 900,000. 1 understand the site<br />
for the home has been chosen and that planning is well advanced.<br />
I wish that venture every success.<br />
All this activity reflects the strength of community commitment<br />
within this area.* It reflects favourably indeed, on the strength<br />
of your local administration. I commend the President and<br />
his Councillors on their continuing capacity to keep pace<br />
with development.<br />
This new Shire facility is an appropriate symbol of the extent<br />
of that capacity. It is a credit to you all that the project<br />
has been possible through your own initiative and, more<br />
importantly, your own finance.<br />
The offices are certainly a far cry from the original Council<br />
Chambers built nearly 70 years ago when Noruya was just a<br />
small coastal township serving a pastoral and fishing region.<br />
Of course, as Eurobodalla developed, additions were built and<br />
adjoining houses were purchased. </p>
<p>-3-<br />
But almost three years ago you felt that you had simply<br />
outgrown the original facilities. I am more than familiar<br />
with the problem of working in a building that was designed<br />
for a different era. I am also looking forward to new<br />
he. adquarters, but they are a few years off yet.<br />
I congratulate you on the sense of purpose that has<br />
enabled these offices to be functional within three years<br />
of setting up a sub-committee to investigate the project.<br />
This fine new building is a confident investment in the<br />
continued growth and prosperity of this area. I am sure<br />
your confidence is well founded.<br />
Thank you again for inviting me to be present for this<br />
important occasion. I have great pleasure in declaring your<br />
new Eurobodalla Shire Headquarters officially open.<br />
