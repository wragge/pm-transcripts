    <content><![CDATA[<p>I am pleased to announce that the Governor-General has appointed Ms Kerri-AnneÂ Kennerley to the Council for the Order of Australia.</p>
<p>Ms Kennerley is a distinguished media personality and a presenter of a numberÂ of national television programs. Her interaction with such a wide cross-sectionÂ of the Australian community will add a further dimension to the deliberationsÂ of the Council which meets twice a year to consider nominations and to makeÂ recommendations for awards in the Order of Australia to the Governor-General.</p>
<p>I am delighted that Ms Kennerley has agreed to join the Council and giveÂ freely of her time to this important national body. She brings to the CouncilÂ for the Order of Australia a breadth of experience and achievement whichÂ many Australians respect and admire.</p>
<p>Ms Kennerley replaces Ms Anne Fulwood. Ms Fulwood has served on the CouncilÂ since 1996 and I would like to acknowledge on behalf of the Government andÂ myself, appreciation for the important contribution she made to the workÂ of the Council.</p>
