    <content><![CDATA[<p>I am pleased to announce that the Governor-General has appointed Ms Kerri-Anne Kennerley to the Council for the Order of Australia.</p>
<p>Ms Kennerley is a distinguished media personality and a presenter of a number of national television programs. Her interaction with such a wide cross-section of the Australian community will add a further dimension to the deliberations of the Council which meets twice a year to consider nominations and to make recommendations for awards in the Order of Australia to the Governor-General.</p>
<p>I am delighted that Ms Kennerley has agreed to join the Council and give freely of her time to this important national body. She brings to the Council for the Order of Australia a breadth of experience and achievement which many Australians respect and admire.</p>
<p>Ms Kennerley replaces Ms Anne Fulwood. Ms Fulwood has served on the Council since 1996 and I would like to acknowledge on behalf of the Government and myself, appreciation for the important contribution she made to the work of the Council.</p>
