    <content><![CDATA[<p>E&amp;OE..........................................................................................................................</p>
<p>Thank you very much Major Evans. To Kim Beazley and General Baker.</p>
<p> Before I say a few words of my own I would like to read a message</p>
<p> from the Governor-General as follows:-</p>
<p>"My thoughts are very much with the members of the Australian</p>
<p> Defence Force who are leaving for overseas today. Can I ask that you</p>
<p> tell them that they leave with my warmest good wishes and my prayers</p>
<p> that they have a successful mission and a safe return".</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen I want to say a few very simple things to you.</p>
<p> I want, first of all, to express my personal thanks and that of the</p>
<p> Australian people for the fact that, first of all you have devoted</p>
<p> your life to the Australian Defence Force. And the contribution that</p>
<p> all of you have made to the training, the rigour, the discipline and</p>
<p> the lifestyle of the Australian Defence Force is something that I,</p>
<p> and I know that millions of your fellow countrymen and women appreciate</p>
<p> very much.</p>
<p>I want to thank you very much for the mission that you are about to</p>
<p> undertake. You are undertaking a mission for a good cause. It is in</p>
<p> the interests of civilised countries that the sort of conduct of the</p>
<p> Iraqi leadership is not allowed to go unchecked. And there is a very</p>
<p> strong moral case for the ultimate use of military force if it becomes</p>
<p> necessary. And it is not something that is remote and unconnected</p>
<p> from Australia, it is something that in the long run if not dealt</p>
<p> with can have serious consequences for our country.</p>
<p>We still hope at this stage that it won't be necessary to use</p>
<p> force and we continue to support the diplomatic efforts that are now</p>
<p> under way. But it is very important that we be willing, if necessary,</p>
<p> to use force. The authority and the reputation of the United Nations</p>
<p> is also very much involved.</p>
<p>I know that you will have mixed feelings. In many senses this mission</p>
<p> is a fulfilment of the years of training and so forth in your regiments.</p>
<p> And it will be seen by many of you as the kind of thing for which</p>
<p> you have trained. I know as professional soldiers, professional men</p>
<p> and women, you will be aware also of the risks that are involved.</p>
<p> And that is something of which your Prime Minister and your Leader</p>
<p> of the Opposition and I know the Chief of your Defence Force and your</p>
<p> fellow Australians are also very much aware.</p>
<p>You can go overseas knowing that you have behind you the most superb</p>
<p> training imaginable, and something that is so tremendously important</p>
<p> to you and it will be a source of great sustenance and support. And</p>
<p> I can say that you go overseas with our goodwill, our support, our</p>
<p> good wishes. I know that inevitably the families you leave behind</p>
<p> will feel a sense of anxiety. In the best way possible we will all</p>
<p> try and share that and to help them.</p>
<p>You will go overseas with our good wishes. And may I say to all of</p>
<p> you, that God's speed, a safe return, a very successful mission.</p>
<p> You go with the good wishes and the goodwill of an immensely proud</p>
<p> Australian nation.</p>
<p>Ladies and Gentlemen, thank you for what you are doing for a just</p>
<p> cause, thank you for what you are doing for Australia. My thoughts</p>
<p> will be with you constantly over the weeks ahead.</p>
<p>Thank you very much.</p>
<p>[Ends]</p>
