FOR RE~ SS -3JAN 1968<br />
NEW ZEALAND BUTTER IN AUSTRALIA<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister and<br />
Minister for Trade and Industry<br />
( Mr. J. McEwen), replying to suggestions<br />
that New Zealand Butter might<br />
be imported into Australia.<br />
Speaking as Minister for Trade and Industry,<br />
Mr. MoEwen said that the New Zealand Prime Minister ( Mr.<br />
Holyoake) had raised with him during talks in Canberra<br />
last week the question of the likelihood of Australia being<br />
unable to fill her full quota of butter for the British<br />
market this season because of the drought in Australia.<br />
He agreed that if Australia could not fulfil its quota he<br />
would be glad if New Zealand could make good Australia's<br />
shortfall this season.<br />
Mr. Holyoake had apparently discussed this matter<br />
with the British Prime Minister ( Mr. Wilson).<br />
Mr. McEwen said that notwithstanding the drought and<br />
notwithstanding any re-structuring of Australia's dairy<br />
industry, Australia would still be an important exporter of<br />
butter and certainly would not be prepared to import butter.<br />
This had been a basic point in the Australia New<br />
Zealand Free Trade Area Agreement, he said.<br />
Canberra, A. C. T.<br />
24th December, 1967. </p>
