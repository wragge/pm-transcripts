LUNCHEON AT HOTEL CANBERRA REX, CANBERRA JUNThE 1968<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, RT. HON. J. G. GORTON, M. P.<br />
Mr President, Distinguished Guests, Ladies and Gentlemen:-<br />
This must necessarily be a truncated report on visits recently paid<br />
to the United States, Viet Nam, Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia.. Being<br />
brief, it can only touch on some of the matters discussed and that-without<br />
going into the matters in any depth, Indeed, if it were to do anything else,<br />
iwould deprive you of that which you have come along to do, and that is to<br />
Wsuch searching questions as may have occurred to you before this Luncheon<br />
took place. One of the main purposes of the visits to these countries nearest<br />
0~ Mr President, was to demonstrate that although there had been a change of<br />
mie Ministers in Australia, there had been no change in our interest in or<br />
desire to co-operate with those Asian countries in our region. I wished to<br />
demonstrate that that policy:-furthered so well by my predecessor, was a<br />
continuing policy of the Australian Government and, as I believe,' of the<br />
Australian people.. This, I think, the visit succeeded in doing,<br />
A further purpose was to make personal contact with the leaders<br />
of the countries visited and with other senior people in the Administration<br />
of those countries., It is always a good thing if you are at some later stage<br />
to speak to, or to write to an individual,. to have met that individual<br />
feto face and for him to have met you.<br />
6 A third purpose, and indeed not third in point of importance, was<br />
a desire to see and meet with and bring greetings from Australia to those<br />
Australian forces which are serving overseas in various areas and which are, in<br />
pnt of-numbers, the greatest forces we have had serving overseas since the<br />
clusion of the Second World War,<br />
These visits. Mr President, took place against an international<br />
background of change,.<br />
Firstly, the President of the United States was trying to bring<br />
North Viet Nam to the conference table to see whether a just and honourable<br />
peace could be negotiated in that war-torn country, and to that end, he had<br />
ordered at some considerable military sacrifice, a cessation of bombardment<br />
over a large area of North Viet Nam, He had announced that he, himself,<br />
would give up any hope of being re-elected ae President of his great nation,<br />
so that he could devote his efforts to that end and so that he could not be<br />
accused of devoting his efforts to that end for personal political purposes..<br />
This had led to a flood of speculation that the United States might withdraw<br />
altogether from Asia: might withdraw altogether from Viet Nam, might accept,<br />
in the words of the President of the United States.. a " fake" peace which was<br />
merely a prelude to a takeover by North Viet Nam of the South, and might lose<br />
all interest in involvement in this area of the world,, </p>
<p>An assessment of the answers to these questions was clearly of<br />
importance to Australia's future planning, and I sought to make this<br />
assessment in personal talks with the President and with such of his<br />
likely successors as I was able to meet, and I have reported on this,~<br />
Secondly, Mr President, there had been a fundamental change in<br />
the basis on which Australia~ s strategic planning had for more than two<br />
decades been predicated,~ This was caused not only by the accelerated<br />
British withdrawal from the Malaysia/ Singapore area, but also and this<br />
is of at least equal importance by the uncertainty that surrounded the<br />
questions as to when, and with what forces and under what circumstances<br />
the British would contribute to the defence and stability of the region<br />
to our Near North after their withdrawal.<br />
Clearly, a concept of forward defence by troops stationed<br />
outside Australia. valid when based upon participation with Incal forces<br />
of a major power, needed minute examination when the forces of that<br />
major power were to be withdrawn and the circumstances of their re-entry<br />
were unknown., Clearly any contribution by us to the stability of the<br />
ion after 1971 cannot be fixed until we know what Britain, New Zealand,<br />
* aysia and Singapore will do, or are likely to do, in the future..<br />
Against this background ' I have asked before the visits took place<br />
that our Defence Committee should prepare a new strategic assessment, a<br />
~ wstrategic appreciation, taking into account those fundamental changes<br />
ch had occurred some four to five months ago, and which had so radically<br />
altered those assessments which, for more than two decades, we had accepted.<br />
These journeys, and the initial meetings of the Five Power Pact<br />
countries in Kuala Lumpur, have provided some of the answers to the questions<br />
that we have to ask ourselves, The new assessment from the Defence<br />
Committee when it is presented to Cabinet, as I expect it will be by<br />
August at the latest,. will enable us, together with the facts gathered<br />
on these journeys, properly to assess what the far future role of Australia<br />
should be and I say " far future" because the end of 1971 is still three<br />
and a half years away.,<br />
0 But against this background, and until we get that appreciation<br />
and assess it and set it up against the facts gathered in the conferences<br />
and the journeys that have taken place, until we have examined a number<br />
6 various possible alternatives for long-range planning, it would be<br />
~ esponsible to settle long-range military planning, We would not<br />
propose to do it until we have the full facts on which to settle those<br />
plans; which is not to say that our forces will not gro~ w greatly in<br />
capacity next year; for they will,<br />
Against this background, there was added value in meeting<br />
personally the leaders of Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesiaz In the case<br />
of Indonesia, this was not because she was involved or is in any way<br />
likely to be involved in such decisions as we may make in conjunction<br />
with New Zealand, Britain-Singapore and Malaysia, but because she is our<br />
nearest neighbour, because she is a significant power in this area, and<br />
because that being so, I thought it proper and right that these matters<br />
should be the subject of discussion between her President and myself,<br />
Now, I turn very briefly to the countries visited on this<br />
Asian tour,~ 9 o/ 3 </p>
<p>In Viet Nam * the fighting is as fierce and as cruel as ever<br />
There are indications that since the partial embargo on bombing of North<br />
Viet Nam: i there has been a very great build-up of North Vietnamese<br />
regular forces in South Viet Nam.. It is belived these forces will be<br />
used over the coming months in co-ordinated attacks on Saigon and other<br />
centres of population, designed primarily to influence public opinion<br />
outside South Viet Nam, and designed in the hope of influencing the<br />
talks at present going on in Paris, These are talks which it is all<br />
too easy to describ. e as peace talks, but which in fact are not, but<br />
merely preliminary talks to see whether there is a basis for the<br />
negotiation of a just and lasting peace, talks which regrettably have<br />
so far made no discernible progress, talks which, as I said when they<br />
were initiated, contained the seeds of hope, but talks which so far have<br />
not shown any indication of the germination of those seeds.<br />
I found an intention on the part of the South Vietnamese<br />
Government to increase their own armed forces., to make a stronger<br />
contribution themselves to the war-~ and I found;. too, a nagging fear<br />
amongst all with whom I spoke that there might be in Paris some<br />
further military concession without reciprocal concession by the<br />
Worth Vietnamese which would undermine the morale of the armed forces<br />
of South Viet Nam and of the population of South Viet Nam. I do not<br />
believe these fears are justified,<br />
Turning now, Mr President, to Singapore, I had long talks with<br />
Wee Kuan Yew and with'the Foreign Minister Rajaratnam-There was<br />
evidently a lively appreciation there of the need to build up Singapore's<br />
capacity to defend itself, and a determination to do this side by side<br />
with the successful efforts presently being made to provide better<br />
living conditions for the people of Singapore.<br />
There was a purposefull attempt being made to tackle the<br />
problems of unemployment. which are still great, and a conscious attempt<br />
to forge the divergent races living in Singapore into a unified whole<br />
owing allegiance to that city state giving loyalty to that city state<br />
and not to the origins from whence they sprang.<br />
There is no doubt of the genuine belief of Lee Kuan Yew that<br />
the defence of Singapore and Malaysia is indivisible and there is no<br />
doubt of his intention to contribute to that defence and to do what he<br />
* can to see that this indivisibility is not in any way divided,<br />
For ourselves; it seemed to me that what we could do best to<br />
help was to provide technical assistance defence aid in the form of<br />
equipment and matters of that kind: to encourage private investment<br />
in Singapore and to continue -that government assistance which we<br />
already are contributing<br />
In Malaysia. too ' there was an equal awareness of the<br />
indivisibility of defence between Singapore and Malaysia and an<br />
equal awareness of the need for defence in adequate strength in<br />
in that area., defence to which they must contribute,<br />
There I had the opportunity to speak at some length with the<br />
Tunku and his Cabinet in private on these matters,' and had the honour of<br />
being the first Commonwealth Prime Minister to be received on the floor<br />
of the Malaysian Parliament and to receive an address of welcome by<br />
the Prime Minister and by the Leader of the Opposition. Although I should<br />
point out to this gathering that there are so many different parties<br />
in the Opposition that they have been unable to agree amongst themselves<br />
who is the leader, so the leader is designated by the Prime Minister, </p>
<p>Sir.' if I have spoken largely of defence, it is because the<br />
question of defence looms so largely in the minds of the leaders., both<br />
in Singapore and in Malaysia. I found in these countries no acceptance<br />
whatever of the proposition that what they need is economic aid in lieu<br />
of defence. but rather the reverse, although; of course, they need both.<br />
In Indonesia, on the other hand-the emphasis in all our talks<br />
was on the economic conditions, particularly in Java, and what might<br />
be done by the Indonesian Government itself for that must play the<br />
primary part and by other nations in conjunction with the Indonesian<br />
Government to improve those conditions.. This will take a massive effort<br />
by the major powers and will require careful selection of projects and<br />
effective administration in order to be successful,.<br />
I found there, too, complete acceptance by the Indonesian<br />
Government of Australia's peaceful intentions and complete acceptance<br />
of any decisions we might make to contribute to Singapore's and<br />
Malaysia-s defence after 1971.<br />
Now, Mr President I know you wish to get to questions;. and I<br />
Would merely conclude on thi's note. because after all, the question of<br />
what is happening in Viet Nam is of major importance -in this country.<br />
I see no reason for any change in Australia's attitude to this<br />
~ truggle, We belive the Americans are right to seek for the South<br />
ietnamese the right to elect their own government, to carry out that<br />
election free from invasion, terrorism or threat and to have such<br />
decision as they may make respected by all,<br />
We belive that we have a stake in demonstrating that armed<br />
aggression must not succeed.. We believe we now contribute sufficient<br />
forces from Australia to carry out our duty in this respect,: and we<br />
have the will to continue this contribution in concert with our Allies<br />
until the political objective which the military operations are aimed<br />
at is achieved; and until, if such political objective is achieved, we<br />
can turn. as I would like to turn our efforts. to rebuilding that<br />
ounryand providing to its people that kind of life which I feel under<br />
terown control they can achieve..<br />
I think I had better stop so that you have plenty of time for<br />
use t on s Th a n k yo u<br />
QUESTON SESSION:<br />
Q Bob Baudino: Mr Prime Minister, if I may be forgiven, I<br />
intend to indulge in the fashion of the Indonesian press<br />
conferences and to ask you two entirely unrelated questions.<br />
You have referred to our defence planning and mentioned it would<br />
be irresponsible to go ahead with forward defence planning of<br />
this kind You have also added that our forces will continue<br />
to grow in the meantime.. Could you give us further details of<br />
the interim plan for defence--Secondly,. at Nui Dat,, when<br />
addressing our own troops, you told them that for every nut<br />
who held up a placard or sat on the road in Australia-there were<br />
one hundred others behind them. I think there may be points of<br />
clarification needed here,~ C. </p>
<p>1W<br />
PM: Thank you, Mr Baudino. The answer to the first question<br />
you have asked is this-As a result of decisions already taken on<br />
defence, there will in the 1968-69 financial year be significant<br />
growth in the Australian defence capacity. There will, during that<br />
period, be delivered the 24 Fill strike aircraft which will be<br />
arriving and be put into service.. There will be 36 Macchi jet trainer<br />
fighters delivered ( which have an operational capacity). There will<br />
be delivered one new corvette to the Navy.. There will be delivered<br />
a large amount of new Army equipment, There will be delivered to the<br />
Army. apart from the ordinary equipment from memory, I think some<br />
36 light aircraft and light helicopters, And the size of our<br />
Regular Armed Forces will grow by at least 3,. O00O men, In addition,<br />
there will be very large works programmes carried out for the Army,<br />
the Navy and the Air Force in areas spread throughout the whole of<br />
Australia.. Even that is not a complete list of the new equipment<br />
to be delivered during this period of time. For example, another<br />
Oberon submarine will be delivered and put into service during<br />
1968/ 69., So there will be during the coming year great accretion of<br />
defence hardware, if I can put it that way. and an increase in<br />
defence forces There will also be a considerable increase in<br />
defence expenditure for it will, on any estimate I can make, go up<br />
to at least $ 1,250,000. The overseas requirements that we will have<br />
to extend will rise from round about $ 350 million this financial<br />
year to something like certainly well over $ 400 million next<br />
financial year. So there is no interruption to defence planning;<br />
there is no interruption to the accretions to the strength of our<br />
Forces.. But seeking to look a long way ahead, it will probably<br />
be towards the end of the year before some new Three-Year Programme,<br />
to be operative not in the next financial year but in the one after<br />
and in the two years after that-will be able responsibly to be<br />
brought down, That would be the answer I would give you to the<br />
first question. On the second question, that relating to ' nuts-, I would<br />
like to make two things clear. One is that this is not to be taken<br />
as a reference to those who oppose a course a government is taking,<br />
and who use the proper channels to express that opposition the<br />
proper channels being the newspapers,. being any media of public<br />
expression that can be attained, being the holding of public<br />
meetings, being seeking to influence public opinion against the<br />
last expression of majority public opinion; for this must be<br />
maintained as a right of any minority. As Voltaire indeed said:<br />
" I disagree with what you say, but I would defend to the death<br />
your right to say it" But if that minority opposition is extended<br />
to actions -actions such as throwing things at people with whom<br />
the disagree, actions such as throwing paint over the cars of<br />
representatives of nations with whose policies they disagree, actions<br />
such as carrying placards and lying down in roadways to disrupt<br />
traffqic; then that-I think, is something not known and not proper<br />
to a democratic society, because it is not an assertion of minority<br />
rights to seek to change majority opinion,. It is -the beginning, an<br />
incipient requirement of a minority to force a change in majority<br />
opinion by breaking the law and by disrupting the rights of the<br />
majority,. This kind of thing, beginning in this way, can ultimately<br />
lead to the sort of tragic consequences we have seen in other<br />
countries, and I belive that perhaps ' nut' is rather too mild an<br />
expression for those who break the law and disrupt the traffic and<br />
throw and threaten those representatives of majority opinion with<br />
which they disagree, A minority has rights which must be protected,<br />
but it has no rights to seek to impose its will by any degree of<br />
force on a majority which disagrees with it, .7 6 </p>
<p>Q Herschel Hurst. Melbourne Sun: Prime Minister. you said<br />
in-your speech here today, in effect, '. that you believed the South<br />
Vietnamese people wouldn~ t be sold out at the Paris talks, In the<br />
course of your discussions with President Johnson in Washington<br />
recently, did the President indicate to you just how far the United<br />
States was prepared to go in concessions to the communists to end<br />
the Viet Nam war?<br />
PM: The President of the United States indicated to me both<br />
privately and in public that he would not be prepared to accept<br />
anything which he described as a ' face' peace; a " fake" peace as<br />
I understand him to mean being a peace which was a formula designed<br />
to cover a withdrawal without obtaining the objective of giving the<br />
South Vietnamese people a change in freedom to express their own views.<br />
He has said this privately, he has said this publicly, and I believe<br />
that as far as he and his Administration are concerned he will not<br />
make concessions which would lead to such an outcome, This<br />
Administration. of course, has some six or seven months to run. He<br />
spoke for himself as President, He made it clear he could not speak<br />
for his successor as President and neither can I, but I did gather<br />
the impression from the likely successors to whom I spoke that there,<br />
too, there would be unlikely to be concessions which led to a disguishel<br />
surrender and a disguished abandonment of the objectives which were<br />
initially sought to be attained,.<br />
Q Chris Forsyth: Sir, you mentioned a whole list of defence<br />
hardware deliveries that we were going to get this year, It was<br />
before your time that the decisions were made several years ago, Your<br />
Government has delayed the Three-Year Defence Programme by a year, Sir,<br />
Does this mean that Australia will have a years pause in defence<br />
hardware buying and planning with obvious repercussions for deliveries<br />
in the future?<br />
PM: Well,. some of that hardware that you refer to wasn't before<br />
my time.. In fact the submarine was ordered while I was Minister for<br />
0the Navy, if you dont mind my saying so., Oh, you mean before I was<br />
Prime Minister .,, but I do claim the ordering of some of that<br />
hardware that will be in service during the coming year,, The point<br />
of your question is should we not already have ordered a lot more<br />
hardware for the subsequent year. and I don't believe that that is a<br />
valid suggestion. When you order a ship., you are seeking to case your<br />
mind forward to see what you want that ship to do for the next<br />
twenty to twenty-five years, what part you want it to play in an<br />
overall defence plan., When you order an aircraft you are seeking<br />
to cast your mind forward to see what that aircraft is going to do<br />
for the next ten to fifteen years, what part it is that you want<br />
it to play in an overall defence programme, With such fundamental<br />
changes as we have had and with the new strategic assessment coming<br />
up, and with further matters to be resolved in the Five-Power Pact;<br />
then I think it would be irresponsible until all the data is in<br />
to order further hardware for immediate delivery,, It is more<br />
responsible to wait until we have been able to assess and announce<br />
where it is we believewe are going in five or six years time because,<br />
after all, up until 1971, three and a half years' time it is known<br />
what will happen there,, It would be irresponsible to assess beyond<br />
that time before we have had a proper assessment and appreciation; and<br />
if that is disagreed with, then it is disagreed with but it is the<br />
view that the Government takes, C rc/ </p>
<p>Q Frank________ ain Agence France Press and Macquarie<br />
Radio: Can you tell us, Mr Prime Minister, whether this steady<br />
rise in defence expenditure will lead to a steady decline in social<br />
services and in national development?<br />
PM: No. I don't believe the steady rise in defence expenditure<br />
does mean a steady decline in social services and your other point<br />
was national development because there will be a steady rise in<br />
GNP, there will be a steady rise in national production and in its<br />
value Indeed., we are now going through what I call the tantalising<br />
years because two years ahead or two and a half years ahead, that<br />
kind of period of time, we can see coming in to us the full benefits<br />
of the minerals which are now being mined throughout the length and<br />
breadth of this continent. We can see coming into to us the import<br />
replacement value of the oil which is being discovered., We can see<br />
coming in to us the benefit of the increased employment and the<br />
increased industrial muscles which these will generate and which<br />
other things will generate. So I not only see no decline in social<br />
is services, but it is as I have said before, essential that we should<br />
look at the areas of most need in social services and seek to overcome<br />
them as part of a project of complete overhaul of our approach to<br />
social services, Having said that, it is also clear that resources<br />
spent on defence cannot be spent in other areas of national development<br />
whether they be social services, whether they be education, whatever<br />
they may be. It doesn't mean a decline, It does mean less capacity<br />
to increase-<br />
Q Jack Commins, ABC: Sir, has your recent visit led to any<br />
rethinking on defence on your part? I refer to your initial statement<br />
after becoming Prime Minister that the facts and future defence<br />
expenditure must be balanced against internal development. I suppose<br />
you answered that to a degree in the previous answer, but overall, I<br />
think the question in all our minds is whether an increase in expenditure<br />
will lead to an increase in taxation in the new Budget?<br />
Now: really, do you honestly expect an answer which may<br />
forecast Budget possibilities taxation. ( Commins: It was worth<br />
a try') So youve tried, so thank you-<br />
Alan Wood: Bearing in mind your reply to Mr Forsyth~ s<br />
question,. I wonder if you could tell us where the defence hardware<br />
already on order and ordered on the basis of an out-of-date defence<br />
assessment, will fit into the new assessment?<br />
PM: Before I answer that question, I would like to say that I<br />
dont accept your statement that what has bee. n ordered has been<br />
ordered on an out-of-date defence assessment, For example, I would<br />
believe that the strike aircraft ordered would be necessary whatever<br />
the future defence assessment may be-They have been ordered in the<br />
United States you asked me, I think, where they had been ordered.<br />
The submarine to which I referred and which also, I think, is an<br />
integral part of a Navy however we may imagine that Navy to be<br />
operating, has been ordered from the United Kingdom, as has its<br />
predecessors. The Macchi jet trainers have been; or rather will be<br />
built in Australia itself-The 12 Mirage fighters. which I omitted to<br />
mention will be added to our defence capacity in the next year. will<br />
be built in Australia itself. All the works programmes to which I<br />
referred will obviously be handled in Australia itself, I cannot give<br />
you them item by item because I haven't got it in my mind all the<br />
pieces of defence hardware; but that would give various examples of<br />
where this is coming from, and you will perhaps have noticed that we<br />
have recently placed orders for electronic equipment for defence<br />
purposes, again with Australian industry. </p>
<p>QStan Hutchinson: " Mr Prime Minister, when you were abroad,<br />
you made an enigmatic reference to an Israeli-type army, Now the<br />
Israeli-type citizen soldier depends for his emotional stimulus on<br />
virtually being able to look out his window and see what he can<br />
identify as an enemy, What would you substitute for that to keep<br />
the Australian citizen soldier keen and enthusiastic?<br />
PM: We have had two world wars in which we have from the<br />
beginning relied very considerably on that citizen soldier to which<br />
you refer Indeed., I think, at the beginning of both the First and the<br />
Second World Wars, we had no regular army worth the name to put<br />
into the field.: In both those cases. we had time to prepare to call<br />
the citizen soldier into camp, to weld him into a unit, to then send<br />
him abroad whether he had chosen to join the AlP at the beginning or<br />
whether subsequently he went as reinforcements. Now we do have a<br />
Regular Army stronger than before, but it needs, I believe to be<br />
backed up by Citizen Military Forces, adequately trained, able to be<br />
quickly mobilised. I think it unnecessary to suggest that they need to<br />
look out of a window in order to be galvanised into giving their<br />
services in this way. I believe there are many Australians who are<br />
prepared to devote their time to Citizen Military Force training<br />
so that there will be able to be a back-up force for a Regular Army.<br />
It appears to me, particularly in a country which for decades will have<br />
a requirement to build its strength through development, that this kind<br />
of back-up force is good, is effective and is necessary-<br />
Q Harry Stein: Mr Prime Minister:, during your recent journey,<br />
you were not able to obtain a non-aggression pact with some of the<br />
nations, which you had indicated you would like-I put it to you, Sir,<br />
dont you think that ata time when there are no Australian troops<br />
fighting against Asians as they are doing now in Viet Nam, that it<br />
will be easier to establish a non-aggression pact with our Asian<br />
neighbours?,-<br />
P Well I would put it back to you that I don't think anything<br />
of the kind In the talks that I had with the leaders of the Asian<br />
nations to whom I spoke.-that is in Singapore; in Malaysia and in<br />
Indonesia, I had no indication whatevey that there was any suggestion<br />
that Australian troops should not be engaged in seeking to protect, as I<br />
believe they are seeking to protect, the rights of the people of South<br />
Viet Nam It would have been a little strange, would it not, had it<br />
been otherwise; because after all, the people of Singapore and leaders<br />
of Singapore and of Malaysia are interested in their own defence and<br />
in exercises to help their own defence, which will involve Australian<br />
troops. So it would be quite an odd volte face if what you suggest were<br />
so., By whatever name you call it, I don't think it matters, but I would<br />
agree with what Mr Hasluck said in the House before I went away or<br />
rather,-what I think he said in a conference before I went away that<br />
non-aggression pacts in this area and the area fairly close to us could<br />
do no harm and could indeed do good.. This was not a major objective<br />
of my visit, but I have some hopes that as time passes, we could at<br />
least obtain declarations from the countries in the region that they<br />
respect. the one to the other, the territorial integrity and sovereignty<br />
of each other.. While the cynics may say this means nothing; at least<br />
it is; I think,' something which it would be hard to attack as wrong to<br />
seek to obtain. / 9 </p>
<p>Q Mr Prime Minister, do you believe a resumption of the<br />
bombing of North Viet Nam would necessarily jeopardise the Paris<br />
preliminary talks?<br />
PM: I haven't had any conversations or any suggestions<br />
concerning hypothetical questions such as that.<br />
Q Chalmers: Mr Prime Minister, this week Mr Holyoake was<br />
quoted as saying thlat in lieu of a visit he was contemplating to<br />
Canberra, he had a long telephone conversation with you. I was<br />
wondering whether you could tell us anything of the telephone<br />
conversation, particularly what he may have said, and in particular<br />
whether that conversation contemplated a meeting between yourself<br />
and Mr Holyoake either here or in Wellington?<br />
PM: No, not really.. Mr Holyoake stayed behind in Kuala Lumpur<br />
rather longer than he had intended in the hope that we might have had<br />
a discussion there on what had transpired at the Five-Power Talks and<br />
what he saw as the future after 1971 and matters of that kind. But<br />
* there was a fa. irly split-second schedule arranged and except over a<br />
dinner which was not a completely appropriate occasion, this kind of<br />
discussion was unable to be properly developed. So he did ring me<br />
up on the morning that I returned and he put to me then his own<br />
tentative views, his own forecasts and asked me for mine and they were<br />
purely discussions, exploratory and tentative in character. He was<br />
seeking to find out what was in my own mind and I was seeking to find<br />
out what was in his for some considerable time in the future.<br />
QPeter Samuel: Mr Prime Minister, two months ago, our<br />
delegate at the United Nations spoke on the nuclear non-proliferation<br />
treaty and he expressed a lot of strong reservations about this treaty,<br />
and this led to the expectation that we might join India and France in<br />
not signing the treaty, Since then, you have been to the United States,<br />
you have been to Asia,, I wonder if you can give us any more indication<br />
of your thinking on this treaty?<br />
Pie You will have noticed that the resolution which was passed<br />
by the General Assembly was to comment the treaty. You will also have<br />
noticed that we in Australia indicated that we agreed with the principle<br />
of such a treaty but wanted to be sure before we signed it that it was an<br />
effective treaty and that we would be requiring answers as to the<br />
method of withdrawing from the treaty, questions as to control over<br />
people from the international agency who might be sent to be stationed<br />
here to examine various defence installations, questions as to the<br />
rights one had for the civil uses of atomic energy, questions as to whd<br />
in fact was going to sign the treaty and who in fact wasn't, and a large<br />
number of related questions, So, yes in principle, we think that a<br />
treaty of this kind, if it can be made effective, would be good, We<br />
have therefore voted to commend it, it is open to signature, but we<br />
would wish the answers to a lot of questions we raise to be given to<br />
our own satisfaction before we would sign what we commend in principle.<br />
Q Could I just ask a supplementary question to that one?<br />
Will this our decision whether or not to sign depend to any extent<br />
on the major strategic re-assessment that you spoke of and-expect in<br />
August? </p>
<p>PM: I don't believe so. No, I don't believe so. We have to look<br />
decades ahead on this particular matter you have raised. After all, as<br />
far as Australia itself is concerned, we have no nuclear capacity at all.<br />
We have no nuclear plants at all, nor are likely to have any chance<br />
of manufacturing any nuclear defence for at least a decade, so it is not<br />
an immediate matter with which we are concerned. It is rather a matter<br />
of seeking to see how it will work and, as far as one can, to look ahead<br />
to the future of not you or I but younger ones living in Australia.<br />
Q David Solomon: Prime Minister can you see any end to the Viet<br />
Nam war coming other than through the Paris talks?<br />
PM: Well, Mr Solomon, so far, I can see no end at all to the Viet<br />
Nam war coming through the Paris talks because up to this stage there has<br />
been nothing but an exchange of polemics, a refusal on the part of the<br />
North Vietnamese to admit that there are any North Vietnamese troops<br />
in South Viet Nam, a refusal on the part of the North Vietnamese to admit<br />
that they are providing the rockets and mortar shells to bombard Saigon<br />
in return for Hanoi being freed from bombardment, and this all carried on<br />
in public0 So that is answer to a part of your question0 The answer<br />
* to the second part is that it must merely be an impression and an<br />
assessment. It cannot be taken as a clear indication of what will happen.<br />
Of course it can't, looking ahead. But I believe, given sufficient will,<br />
that the military objective of obtaining political freedom for the people<br />
of South Viet Nam can be attained.<br />
In the light of that answer, Sir, and in the light of your<br />
earlier statement about the bombardment of Saigon and the build-up<br />
following the cessation of American bombing, would you like to see, as<br />
the American newspapers have suggested, some deadline put on the bombing<br />
halt?<br />
PM: I have already had a question similar to that from, I think,<br />
the " Sydney Morning Herald" 0 This is a sort of hypothetical question<br />
which I would not wish to give an answer to0<br />
Sir, on the question of taxation, which you dismissed earlier,<br />
Wcan I put it to you, how would it be possible to increase defence<br />
expenditure by such a large amount and not neglect social services and<br />
national development without increasing taxation.<br />
I thought I had endeavoured to give an indication of the answer<br />
Wto that, and I am not to be taken as forecasting anything concerning the<br />
Budget this or future Budgets one way or the other, but as a country<br />
grows, and as its population grows and as its GNP grows and as its taxable<br />
income grows, so there is a capacity to increase not only one facet of<br />
expenditure but a number of facets of expenditure0 Now, it is a matter<br />
for decision as to whether they are increased sufficiently, or which ones<br />
are increased sufficiently0 But there is not a fixed sum of Government<br />
revenue which remains fixed year after year so that taking from that sum<br />
a greater amount for Project A leaves lessfor Projects B and C and D,<br />
rather there is a growing sum which year after year grows, and from the<br />
growth, there can be distributed to Project A, B9 C or D that part of<br />
that growth which it is believed contributes best to the national good.<br />
Q David Gilmorgan: Mr Prime Minister, as there is no embargo<br />
on culture, what is the point of having a cultrual pact between two<br />
countries?. 0.00/ 11 </p>
<p>I think it a little surlxising,, Sir, that you should suggest there<br />
is no value in a cultural pact merely because there happens to be no embargo<br />
as you put it on culture I would have thought that if two countries,<br />
who are as close together as are Indonesia and Australia, both indicated<br />
publicly that they were interested in and would do what they could to<br />
exchange artists; whether they be manual artists or performing artists<br />
to exchange teachers, to exchange visits, to ( in the case of Indonesia<br />
make known in Australia the materials they produce if you like, the<br />
special batiks they produce the kind of ballet telling the stories long<br />
rooted in Indonesian history, the sort of music which comes from parts of<br />
that country and in exchange to receive the opportunity to hear music<br />
of a different kind from our own symphony orchestras, to see dancing of a<br />
different kind from our own culture., that this could do nothing but good,<br />
and that it was rather a negative approach to say there is no embargo on<br />
culture so let us do nothing, It is rather a positive approach to say<br />
both our governments think that the more that can be done to see that each<br />
country sees the culture of the other, the more each country may tend to<br />
. understand the other, and that if that happens, this is not an insignificant<br />
advance..<br />
Q Stewart Harris: Sir.; I think next year Indonesia is going to<br />
give West Irian an act of free choice to decide whether to stay under<br />
* Indonesian administration or become independent. In the last six years<br />
since Indonesia took over the administration of West Irian, Australia has<br />
received in New Guinea about sixty-three refugees and their dependants from<br />
West Irian,. Next year I think it is possible that the number may increase<br />
for one reason or another., The frontier between West Irian and Papua/ New<br />
Guinea is not defined on the ground and is not agreed to by the<br />
Governments of Indonesia and Australia,. There could be problems on the<br />
border-, I was recently up there.. There is no contact at the moment<br />
between the Administrations of West Irian and Papua/ New Guinea. There was<br />
i~ n the time of the Dutch:, Australia~ s relations with Indonesia are now<br />
excellent-You were. in Djakarta yourself recently, Sir, so I was<br />
0wondering if you could get contact going on the ground between the<br />
* Administrations of West Irian and Papua/ New Guinea so that any problems<br />
that might occur next year could be understood in advance?<br />
IM: I think that is a matter, Mr Harris, that I would need to<br />
* discuss with the Minister for External Territories and the Minister for<br />
External Affairs. You surprise me a little because perhaps wrongly<br />
but nevertheless certainly I was, and am, under the impression that the<br />
boundary between West Irian and Papua/ New Guinea is on the map agreed<br />
between the Government of Indonesia and ourselves. Certain exercises have<br />
been carried out to demarcate the boundary and to seek to mark it insofar<br />
as it can be marked. Cairns of stones have been built on the particular<br />
parallel which,; I think, is accepted by both countries. But in between<br />
those cairns, of course, there is just wild jungle, and so indication<br />
of boundaries as one would find in more heavily populated areas, so that<br />
one could easily wander across the boundary without knowing it, from Papua/<br />
New Guinea into West Irian or from West Irian into Papua/ New Guinea-It<br />
will take a long time before this can be stopped, All I can say in answer<br />
to your specific question is that I would have to take that up with the<br />
Minister for External Affairs and the Minister for External Territories,<br />
But I do think that our relations with Indonesia are so good that if there<br />
are problems there they are more likely to be overcome now than they might<br />
ever have been likely to have been overcome in the past. </p>
