TRANSCRIPT OF PRESS CONFERENCE AT THE GREAT HALL OF THE<br />
PEOPLE AFTER MEETING WITH DENG XIAOPING BEIJING<br />
20 MAY 1986<br />
PM: I must say that it was one of the most remarkable<br />
experiences I have had to be able to have nearly 1 a hours<br />
with Chairman Deng. He was very generous in his time<br />
and his exposition. I think what is remarkable is not<br />
merely the magnitude of the of the changes which are<br />
envisaged but also the realism and the preparedness to<br />
admit that mistakes will be made, that they will have<br />
to be faced up to. He has pointed out that when the reform<br />
started in 1980 they were put in terms of looking at<br />
a quadrupling of per capita national income from the<br />
US$ 250 that it was then up to US$ 1000 by the end of this<br />
century. He said of course that they had had outstanding<br />
success in the 5 years of the Sixth Five Year Plan from<br />
1980-85 where the reforms were initiated in the rural<br />
sector associated with significant increases in production<br />
and lifts in income. He said that as they have come to<br />
look again at the problems and the fact that as they<br />
go towards the end of century there will be a lift in<br />
population up perhaps to 1.2 billion or that sort of<br />
order that they have revised somewhat their expectations<br />
to perhaps a level of between US$ 800 1000 per capita<br />
income. It may be that they will be able to get towards<br />
the upper levels of that expectation.* He says now that<br />
of course the reforms are moving thto the more complex<br />
more difficult area of urban economic reform that the<br />
burdens that have been on the back of China in the past<br />
as they have gone about growth must be removed. There<br />
are two areas of burdens which he identified the burdens<br />
of very high levels of subsidies in so many areas of<br />
consumption accommodation as well as actual consolidation<br />
of goods and the burden of the total centralising in<br />
the past of decision making. There must be the removal<br />
of that burden so that actual enterprises have the opportunity<br />
and the responsibility of decision making. He says that<br />
as those two burdens are removed there will be, he believes,<br />
an easier path to growth. It is very interesting that<br />
Chairman Deng also projects as far as into the middle<br />
of the next century where he puts the aim of China<br />
approach the level of the developed countries of the<br />
world. If they have reached US$ 1000 by the end of the<br />
century then they can think again of the quadrupling<br />
in a similar period of time which would be something </p>
<p>the end of the first quarter of the next century. And<br />
so you can see that there approach is of a pattern. It<br />
is not just thinking, about today, next year but the lifting<br />
of China towards the levels of the developed countries.<br />
All this is associated with the belief, and I think this<br />
is fundamental to understand, that they see peace as<br />
absolutely necessary to the achievement of their objectives.<br />
Chairman Deng makes the point that they have changed<br />
their thinking from where in the last decade they saw<br />
war as inevitable they no longer see war as inevitable.<br />
And they see a . growth in the forces for peace. They point<br />
out that four fifths of the world's population are in<br />
developing countries with China 1 billion, India<br />
three quarters of a billion and that for these countries<br />
peace is important and as China grows in economic strength<br />
it will increase in its power as a force for peace. One<br />
interesting comment that the Chairman made in response<br />
to a question when I wondered whether the radical changes<br />
in China may have some effect within the Soviet Union<br />
he said that that may be the case but he said what was<br />
essential for the processes of reform and growth and<br />
change and development was flexibility and China had<br />
that and doubted whether the Soviet Union had that same<br />
flexibility. Now I am sorry that I can't speak longer<br />
but those were parts of the essentials of what was perhaps<br />
one of the most interesting l1 hours of my life I would<br />
think.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, did yo have any discussion<br />
on what role Australia may play in China's future development?<br />
PM: Not in details because that is obviously more appropriately<br />
a matter for discussion with the Premiers and other officials.<br />
May I say at the beginning it was very interesting to<br />
note that Chairman Deng said that he sits back, he says<br />
he doesn't interfere, he has great confidence in the<br />
capacity of his leaders and occasionally he said he gives<br />
them some advice but not too much he said because he<br />
doesn't need to. He has great confidence in them. So<br />
I mean that in a sense is a reflection of the fact that<br />
Chairman Deng is more concerned with the broad sweep<br />
issues. He has obviously been the great inspiration of<br />
what's happened in recent years and is still obviously<br />
revered and will continue to be. But he is concerned<br />
with the broad sweep. But let me say this that he did<br />
say how importantly they regard the relationship with<br />
Australia. They regard Australia as a country with a<br />
close identity of views and perceptions on a wide range<br />
of issues.<br />
JOURNALIST: Did you talk at all about the political<br />
stability in China </p>
<p>PM: Yes, he expressed the view that quite frankly in<br />
the past and he said even perhaps in some areas now there<br />
have been the sceptics. But he said their approach is<br />
to allow the facts to be evidence. And he said the facts<br />
are evidence for the correctness of our policies and<br />
increasingly as the facts of achievement become more<br />
and more apparent so he believes will the acceptance<br />
of the processes of change be accepted.<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you take the fact that he has given you<br />
an audience on this visit as an endorsement of your Government's<br />
China policy?<br />
PM: Well I think it would be perhaps taking things too<br />
far just to say that. I think that it is quite clear<br />
if you look at the almost unparalleled arrangements that<br />
have been made for me on this visit with Secretary-General<br />
Hu Yaobang accompanying me and then Hu Chi Li accompanying<br />
me after that that the meeting with the Chairman Deng<br />
is part of a reflection on the part of the Chinese leadership<br />
of the very, very high importance that they attach to<br />
our relationship. And I am deeply gratified, I mean it<br />
is a question not just of personal satisfaction, but<br />
I think on the behalf of Australia we should be very<br />
gratified that clearly the whole Chinese leadership attaches<br />
such importance to our relationship. It does seem to<br />
me to constitute a re-affirmation in the strongest possible<br />
terms of the importance reciprocally that they as we<br />
do attach to the relationship between our two countries<br />
and the possibility for very extensive growth in that<br />
relationship, not merely in economic terms although that<br />
is important but in the whole range of relations in cultural,<br />
scientific, sporting fields as well as in the area of<br />
economic and commercial relations. </p>
