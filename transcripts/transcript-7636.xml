PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 13 JUNE 1989<br />
During Question Time in the Senate today, Senator Hill asked<br />
Senator Walsh to table a letter which I had sent to Premier<br />
Li Peng of China.<br />
As a matter of policy and practice, I do not release the<br />
contents of my private correspondence with foreign Heads of<br />
Government on issues of on-going policy importance.<br />
In view, however, of the depth of public interest and<br />
concern in Australia over the tragic events in China, I have<br />
agreed to make an exception in this case and a copy of the<br />
letter will be tabled in the Senate at the earliest<br />
opportunity. </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER CANBERRA<br />
12 JUN 1989<br />
I write to you with a deep sense of tragedy and sympathy<br />
for the people of China, following the terrible events<br />
of the past few days.<br />
The Australian Government and people have expressed<br />
their condemnation of the brutal massacre of unarmed<br />
civilians in Beijing by military forces under the<br />
control of your Government. I do not seek to conceal<br />
the depth of feeling among Australians, nor my own sense<br />
of outrage, on this issue.<br />
But my purpose in writing to you goes beyond this. I am<br />
concerned with the future of China, the future of the<br />
Asia-Pacific region and of the world, and the future of<br />
Australia's relations with China.<br />
For nearly two decades no country has done more to<br />
develop friendly and cooperative bilateral relations<br />
with China than has Australia. Moreover, our Government<br />
has been active in spreading the good word about<br />
developments in China and their significance among our<br />
neighbours in Asia and the Pacific and among western<br />
countries with which we have close relations.<br />
We have regarded the emergence of China along the path<br />
of economic reform and openness to the outside world as<br />
one of the most positive developments, regionally and<br />
globally, of our time. Australians have drawn great<br />
encouragement from the progress and stability achieved<br />
within China and from the constructive role China has<br />
played in our neighbourhood and on the international<br />
stage. This makes the tragedy and the set back of the<br />
events of June 1989 so much the greater.<br />
The future interests of China will, I am convinced,<br />
continue to be served by economic reform and the open<br />
door policy. But, as I have said on a number of<br />
occasions to Chinese leaders, this process-will<br />
inevitably create pressures for political reform. That </p>
<p>this is inevitable makes it the task and challenge of<br />
leadership to accommodate these pressures peacefully and<br />
by dialogue. Only in this way will the great creative<br />
capacities of the Chinese people be deployed fully to<br />
achieve the goal of modernisation.<br />
Tragically, on 4 and 5 June the Government of China took<br />
a different an abhorrently different way. That<br />
tragedy will not be forgotten. But, as we look to the<br />
future, it is vitally in China's interests that armed<br />
violence against innocent civilians should cease.<br />
Equally, it is not in China's interests to repress<br />
intellectuals, teachers, students, workers who have<br />
recently sought to express their political views<br />
peacefully. Thus, I earnestly hope that all those<br />
people, including people in positions of high<br />
responsibility, who have expressed contrary views, will<br />
be treated with dignity and humanity. Any other course<br />
of action will not only further damage China's<br />
international reputation. It will directly undermine<br />
efforts for the economic and technological advancement<br />
of the Chinese people.<br />
I make these comments out of a spirit of genuine concern<br />
for China and of deep admiration for your great country.<br />
My comments are dictated by the affection I feel for the<br />
people of China and my profound-conviction that the<br />
world needs a China, prosperous, peaceful and in harmony<br />
with other nations.<br />
My plea to you is to replace the processes of violence<br />
with the processes of dialogue, the processes of<br />
repression with the processes of tolerance, the<br />
processes of suspicion with the processes of trust. On<br />
this basis, China will in time be able to resume the<br />
path of reform and modernisation. And on this basis,<br />
Australia remains prepared to play a constructive and<br />
cooperative role with China, as it has since 1972.<br />

Premier of the State Council of the<br />
People's Republic of China<br />
