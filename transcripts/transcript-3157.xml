I was pleased to take up on behalf of the<br />
Government of South Australia a proposal that Her Majesty<br />
be in Adelaide on 9 March to open the Festival of Arts and<br />
this she has now agreed to do.<br />
To do this it was necessary to have the agrepnment<br />
of the Premier of Western Australia..<br />
Both The Queen and I are grateful-to the Premier<br />
of Western Australia for consenting to the change in the<br />
Perth program so as to allow the Adelaide Festival opening<br />
