TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING, MP<br />
7.30 REPORT WITH PAUL LYNEHAM<br />
MARCH 1992<br />
E&amp; EO PROOF COPY<br />
PL: Your battle with Dr Hewson, it's getting pretty<br />
personal isn't it?<br />
PM: No<br />
PL: No?<br />
PM: No, no. It's about exposing fightback for the fraud<br />
that it is.<br />
PL: So you don't really dislike him as much as it appears?<br />
PM: and proposing Labor's program for the next four<br />
years.<br />
PL: It is pretty personal, you call him spiteful and<br />
vindictive and wicked and all sorts of things.<br />
PM: Well he has made a few brutal assaults on us, but<br />
that's all part and parcel of it all.<br />
PL: Well if you're such good mates tell us about his good<br />
qualities. Has he got any?<br />
PM: Well I am not good mates with him, but I don't have any<br />
personal problems with him.<br />
PL: Unlike your problem with Mr Howard, for example.<br />
PM: Well he stepped over the line, and I had to show him a<br />
lesson.<br />
PL: So we are not to believe there is any personal animus<br />
here across the chamber. </p>
<p>PM: We are fighting over things worth fighting about. He<br />
thinks we can fix the nation's troubles, he has told<br />
us, by putting a 15 per cent tax on everything we buy,<br />
and everything we use, food, clothing etc. I know<br />
that's wrong, I have been round this game a long time,<br />
around the Treasury a long time, that's wrong. What we<br />
propose is something which I think has vista, vision,<br />
which will lift recovery, employment, improve our<br />
nationa. efficiency, and basically give Australians a<br />
real chance in the 1990s.<br />
PL: You said today that Dr Hewson's Fightback package was<br />
already finished, sinking in the water. I mean, I<br />
would have thought the latest polls were saying it was<br />
about neck and neck, with roughly a quarter of the<br />
population waiting to see.<br />
PM: Forget the polls, there has been a sea change here this<br />
week. The Government in two weeks of Question Time and<br />
the Treasury and its analysis of the Fightback Package<br />
it's basically holed, it's taking in water and it is<br />
sinking. Now Dr Hewson had two days notice, he had the<br />
National. Press Club to come back and rebut the<br />
Treasury's findings, that 4 out of 5 tax payers will be<br />
worse off, and 7 families out of 10, 7 households will<br />
be worse! off. He couldn't, he didn't, and we found<br />
today in the Financial Review, " Hewson vows to top up<br />
the tax cuts". From what was just the be all and end<br />
all with, Fightback is now gone.<br />
PL: To be fair, it wasn't the be all and end all. I can<br />
show you. quotes of his some weeks ago, where he was<br />
saying those tax cuts were merely an indication of<br />
where he; was going.<br />
PM: Look, basically he knows that he has been caught out.<br />
He was trying to say that this was a great package for<br />
business. He spent $ 6 billion cutting payroll tax and<br />
$ 6 billion removing petrol tax, which is largely paid<br />
by business. If you are going to transfer that to<br />
business where does it come from? It comes from<br />
households, and the Treasury had the temerity to point<br />
this out, that most households will be worse off. So<br />
straight away the be all end all program is now back to<br />
being, hang on don't worry, I will top it up with more<br />
tax cuts, I will find more money, it doesn't matter if<br />
I blow the Budget deficit, I will buy my way back to<br />
power. In other words the great stitched together,<br />
knitted together, tight little package, is basically in<br />
bits, and he had a chance to defend it, to attack the<br />
Treasury ana lysis and he couldn't, and to beat off the<br />
Government.. He couldn't do either.<br />
PL: But look, y6o'u can still make fine tuning to you~ r<br />
proposals, you have got the August Budget, perhaps even<br />
a small statement in the new year before the election,<br />
and you're not going to take those chances, to -tweak it<br />
up a bit here and there? </p>
<p>PM: But I have never said that this was the be all and end<br />
all, thiLs was the package which will change all.<br />
PL: But neither has he.<br />
PM: Yes he has, now come on Paul, yes he has. The<br />
Fightback was presented as a package of reform for<br />
AustraliLa. In reality it was an excuse for a t; ax, a<br />
very nasty, very large consumption tax on food,<br />
clothing and services. It was a transfer of wealth to<br />
business and the high paid. That's what it was. It<br />
has been exposed for what it is by the Government and<br />
the Treasury, he has no comeback to it and now his only<br />
comeback is don't worry I will conjure up a new trick.<br />
Fightback mark I is dead, that's now throwback,<br />
dieback, Fightback mark II will be unveiled as the<br />
electoral pressure comes on. I mean the question is<br />
what will Dr Hewson do to buy his way to office, how<br />
much damage to the national economy and fiscal policy<br />
will he undertake?<br />
PL: Haven't you appeared, though, to have made a tactical<br />
blunder with your proposed tax cuts by appearing to<br />
neglect those earning less than $ 20,000 a year?<br />
PM: Oh come on Paul look, when I became Treasurer the<br />
lowest r. ate of tax on low incomes was 30 per cent.<br />
PL: Yes, but: that's all history now.<br />
PM: No, it Jis not history. It has to be paid for, and it<br />
is paid for every year, it's now 20 per cent, it was<br />
reduced by 33 1/ 3 per cent, the lowest tax rate. At<br />
the same time we introduced a family allowance<br />
supplement, which is a tremendous boost to low income<br />
families, at the same time we are supporting a national<br />
wage adjustment, still, for the low paid.<br />
PL: Yes, but thait is not the tax system.<br />
PM: Dr Hewson is now saying, he won't have a national wage<br />
adjustment for the low paid, and he is now looking at<br />
his tax cuts under $ 20,000 which don't even cover the<br />
cost of the consumption tax.<br />
PL: But why should people on $ 30,000 get a tax cut and not<br />
people on $ 20,000?<br />
PM: Because the people below $ 20,000 got tax cuts all the<br />
way through the ' 80s, when people above $ 20,000 and<br />
between $ 40,000 didn't get as large a tax cut.<br />
PL: And you have still got the Budget and the Statement<br />
next yeEar perhaps. </p>
<p>PM: And in the ' One Nation' Package a tremendous fillip for<br />
families and another $ 250 million for the family<br />
allowance supplement.<br />
PL: Twice today you seemed to duck the question of whether<br />
you will give back the proceeds of bracket creep from<br />
now on. Any chance of a direct answer on that?<br />
PM: Absolutely, this Government has given back more than<br />
the proceeds of bracket creep, that's the impact of<br />
inflation on the tax system, over the course of its<br />
Government and it will again.<br />
PL: And it will again?<br />
PM: And it will again. But it won't be doing it with any<br />
automaticity, it will be doing it as we say in the ' One<br />
Nation' Package in 1994-95 and 1995-96. In other words<br />
we will return to tax payers the impact of inflation,<br />
even low inflation on the tax system.<br />
PL: Look, if you are really so confident, and Fightback,<br />
you betray the Opposition as, what was your phrase,<br />
handcuffed to the black box while the Exocet missile<br />
came down.<br />
PM: Well Dr Hewson basically handcuffed them all to this<br />
thing. A lot of them didn't like it you know, they<br />
were very worried about it. It's blown up, they all<br />
know, look around these corridors, in the Parliamentary<br />
corridors, they know it's as dead as a doornail.<br />
PL: Look, if you're on such strong ground why not accept<br />
their challenge instead of just having the Wills byelection,<br />
have a general election?<br />
PM: But why should we short-change the public with a short<br />
Parliament, a Parliament which we fought over in 1990<br />
and where the Government secured a majority, where the<br />
public expect you to run your full term, where the<br />
Government should go on governing, why would I<br />
recommend to the Governor-General that we dissolve this<br />
Parliament to do what?<br />
PL: So in the public interest, reluctantly relinquishing<br />
what you: see as a winning position?<br />
PM: Dr Hewson and his party came second at the last<br />
election, and the price of coming second is that you<br />
wait for the next one. The next one is about 15 months<br />
from now.<br />
PL: The republican issue, when you raised it were you aware<br />
that within a few days that Saulwick poll would come<br />
out showing 57 per cent of Australians in favour of a<br />
Republic? </p>
<p>PM: I never raised a republican issue, I talked about<br />
Australians having a confident position about<br />
themselves, about our independence.<br />
PL: You gave the Poms a good kicking didn't you?<br />
PM: Well, with the point in mind, of saying to some of the<br />
Anglifiers in Australia, some of the people here who<br />
present themselves, I mean, less confident Australians<br />
who seek to lead the nation and call the tune for our<br />
destiny, who still want to attach themselves to<br />
something, which is now finished for Australia, that is<br />
an old relationship with Britain, where Britain had the<br />
cultural. and political hand in the relationship it is<br />
over.<br />
PL: Well should we be a Republic Prime Minister?<br />
PM: Well, I am not certain of that, I think we probably<br />
will eventually. When that will be Paul, I don't know.<br />
PL: Well ALI' policy is a referendum aimed at the year 2001.<br />
PM: Look, I was certainly not arguing that case, but the<br />
fact of the matter is, I do certainly argue that we<br />
should be whole-hearted Australians and not halfhearted<br />
Australians. Not forelock tuggers to anybody,<br />
and certainly not tugging the forelock while trying to<br />
present themselves as leaders of the<br />
PL: And an independent, confident nation forging those<br />
links in with Asia, that's the scenario isn't it?<br />
PM: Exactly..<br />
PL: But we are not really part of the Asian club are we?<br />
Do you think we ever will be?<br />
PM: Well we have got 73 per cent of our exports going<br />
there, and 67 per cent of our imports. That makes us<br />
pretty mauch part of the club.<br />
PL: Yes, but we'are different aren't we, we are not: really<br />
in the middle of it are we, we are just sort of that<br />
funny mob down the bottom of the map?<br />
PM: Well no--one is in the middle of it, the middle of it is<br />
the PaciLfic Ocean basically. The Asia-Pacific is a<br />
basin, we are around it, the same as everybody else,<br />
and we are having our share of that growth, and we are<br />
becoming a competitive country, an open competitive<br />
country, and the increments to wealth, and employment,<br />
living standards which can come from that trade, are<br />
obvious: ly coming from the Asia-Pacific' I mean the<br />
days when most our trade was with Europe or wit~ h<br />
Britain are gone. </p>
<p>PL: And finally, in terms of the fine art of Parliamentary<br />
debate, what does burble, burble, burble mean?<br />
PM: Things worth fighting about are worth exposing the<br />
issues on, There is a contest for ideas in this<br />
Parliament between a package which basically puts a<br />
heavy tax on people's way of life. Well let me just<br />
make this clear, Dr Hewson was saying in a barrage that<br />
there was a conspiracy between the Treasury, the<br />
Government, the ABC, and I was simply making the point<br />
that it was gibberish. If you can think in a second<br />
what the physical manifestation of gibberish is and do<br />
better, good on you, but that's what I was trying to<br />
say. To say of our national broadcast, that it has<br />
sold out to the Labor Party, to say of the Treasury<br />
that it has been operated for and by the Government is<br />
of course a dastedly attack upon those institutions and<br />
I was saying so. And to say, if you want to defend<br />
your package, defend your package, but don't shoot the<br />
messenger, Dr Hewson.<br />
PL: That's all we have got time for, thanks a lot.<br />
