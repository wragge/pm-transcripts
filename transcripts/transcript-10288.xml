PRIME MINISTER<br />
March 19" 7 TRANSCIPT OF THE' PRIME MIlNISTdER<br />
THE HON. JOHN HO0WARD MP<br />
SPEECH TO AUSTRALIJAN CHAMBER OF COMMERCE<br />
SHANGHAI CHINA.<br />
E OE<br />
Thank you very much for that welcome. To Minister Liu Qi, Vice Mayor Zhao Qizheiig<br />
to Mr Marc Gauci, rnany other distinguished guests. ladies and gentlemen.. I want to thtank<br />
the China Australia Chamber of Commerce for the forum that it has given rne today, the<br />
first occasion to deliver a speech on my very important visit to China. I want to<br />
ackniowledge the contribution of the Chamber to business and commercial relations between<br />
Australia and China and I also want to acknowledge the contribution of the Australia China<br />
B1usiness Council whose President, lohxi Allen. is amongst the members of the business<br />
delegation accompanying me. Both of those organisations make an immzense contrilution to<br />
fostering good business and inevitably therefore good personal relations -between Australia<br />
-and China.<br />
This lunch brings together a very strong cross secton of the Australian business presenice in<br />
China and I am delighted to have accompanying me on this visit a very senior delegationi of<br />
mena and women who ame leadcrs in Australian business. It is without doubt the strongest<br />
business delegation ever to accompany an Australian Primec Minister alroad and it<br />
underlines two things; my determination to present the Australian Government and the<br />
Australian business community as partners working together to secure long tean economic<br />
partnerships in China and also -an illustration of the diversity of the commercial and business<br />
links that already exist between Australia and China.<br />
It is of course no accident that Shanghai bas been cho ' sen -as my farst port of call as it were in<br />
China. Shanghai is China's pre-eminent industeial and commercial city. It is famous in thte<br />
West for so many things. the Australian business conmmunity has close historical link with<br />
Shanghai. The Wing On and Sincere departmc~ nt stores which have been the main<br />
departmzent. stores in Shanghai for mnost of the last So years were in fact begun in Sydney<br />
by the Guo and Ma families. From modes: beginnings they set up branchres in Shanghai and </p>

How -a r~ I"~; 2A1-P.<br />
in all the major cities along the Chinese coast and today they remain among-the largest<br />
department store chains in East Asia.<br />
This visit is also a reminder to me and indeed many, of the great conitribution that<br />
Austr-Aians of Chinese descent have maide to our nation and to the relationshdp between<br />
Australia and China. There are sonme 300,000 Australians of Chinese descent. My own<br />
electorate has one of the hidghest proportions of Chinese Austrlians in any part of Australia<br />
They have made-a massive contributiou to every aspect of Australian life and particularly<br />
the Shaughainese. Probably the best known of Shanghiainese Australians was the late Victor.<br />
Chang, the eminent hearit suirgeon who was ttagically, murdered a few years ago. He was<br />
born -in Shanghai and later as a child emigrating to Australia.<br />
Australia's business presence in Shanghai is an impressive one. Au stratlian com~ panies have<br />
around 250 investment projects here, 52 of which were approved in 1996 alone. Some of<br />
Australia's largest investments in China are in Shanghai. They include CUB Fosters, which<br />
is developing a new market for beer, an fine example of a well-known. Australian product<br />
being adapted to a new environment. They include the ACI Glass bottling plant, which<br />
incorporates some of the most advanced-glass forming technology in the world..<br />
Other Australian, operations here include Vinidex Tubemeaker's plastie pipes factory,<br />
Suspension Compoaents work in automotive party, and Air Interiational's air conditionin<br />
operation-Boral is currently constructing a large pl aster board factory here the largest<br />
such factory in China. And I bad the pleasuri just in hour ago of anowcing'a joint venture<br />
between Sigtech and its Chinese pairtner, Da Zhong Taxis, to develop a state of the art taxi<br />
communication system. That venture is a reminder of the important role that small and<br />
rnedium-si~ rzd businesses can play in fostering the partnership and winning niche markets.<br />
That firm employs fewer than 50 people and ihat is a fine example that you dont have to be<br />
a large company to do well in such a rapidly growing mrket.<br />
Thesc and other projeccts highlight the scaleof the business links between Australia and<br />
China. In many ways they are a paradigm for our economic relationship with China<br />
generally. The experience of the Baoshan iron and steel works which imports 40 per cent<br />
of its iron ore needs from Australia mneans that many from Shanghai know Australia as a<br />
reliable supplier of raw materials for the industries that are leading China's export growth.<br />
Baoshan alsouses control computer systems which were supplied by Ck Technology in<br />
Sydny; and the materials-handling control systems were supplied by Motherwell Systems<br />
in Perth.<br />
had the pleasure yesterday of course of visiting BHP's steel roll formng laT. BH,<br />
incidentally. has been trading in China for over 100 years. The plant is an excellent<br />
example of our economic cornplernentarities with China. Australia supplied the' primary'<br />
products-it also supplied the high technology used to process those products. So Shanghai<br />
knows that Australian investment can bring to China technology as advanced as that of any<br />
nation in the world. </p>

Australia and China, ladies, and gent lemen, are very different. It is fair to say, however, that<br />
over the past ten years we have both been responding in our own ways to sudden and<br />
profound shifts in the international econormic order. The same forces oif globalisation,<br />
technological revolution and international competition are driving chanige in both countries.<br />
Both our economics are undergoing fundamenTal reform albeit from different directions<br />
and from different stages of development. I want during my visit to China to discust with<br />
her leaders how our economic co-operation might be lifted to a new level.. In doing so. we<br />
can build on the trust and mutual ktmwledgc that our respective business communities -have<br />
built up over the years.<br />
The growth and increased openness of the Chinese ec-onorny presents enormous<br />
opportunities for Australia. China's economy has been growing at around 10 per cent a yewi<br />
for the past 15 years. Australias ekports to China have been growing twice as fast as our<br />
global exports. It is important to remember that Australia has had a long and reliable and<br />
been an imnportat supplier of commodities to China for very miany years. We supplied<br />
grain to China for many years well before diplomatic relations were catablished and when<br />
others would not. We now supply sixty per cent of China's iron ore import a major input<br />
to China's massive and growing steel-mnaking industry. We are a major supplier of wool.<br />
Australia will remain a reliable supplier of raw materials of quality but we can both gain<br />
more from exploiting opportunities for two-% way investment which would iricrease returns to<br />
both of US.<br />
Chinese companies already have equity in some resource projects. Expansion of ths wvould<br />
be very welcome. New areas of cooperation are waiting to be opened up in the minimng<br />
sector and in LNG, for examnple, to fee China's vast energy deinands. Members o-f my<br />
businecss group have some ver imaginative and-attrctive propositions.<br />
We need to remove constraints-to further growth in areas where we have~ traditionally<br />
cooperated. I am hoping that we shiall be abl e to do this in the wool trade, for example, in<br />
the context of our bilateral negotiations on China's accession to the World Trade<br />
* Organisation<br />
Economic change in both countries has hingllighted new sectors for cooperation. The<br />
business group accompanying me reflects the growing diversity of our economic<br />
relationiship and in Australia's particular strengths in financial, accounting and legal'<br />
serices. Australiani insurance companies such as ColonialMutual Group and National<br />
Mutual are keen to operate in China and come with strong pedigrees-AMP has just been<br />
given approval to open a representative office in Beijing.<br />
In Beijing, I will be opening a seminar being held by the Australian Stock Exchan'ge about<br />
the opportunities that listing of Chinese companies would provide for raising capital. We<br />
aim to show the advantages for high quality -Chinese companies of listing9 on the exchange.<br />
Two Australian legal firms, Aliens Arthur Robinson and Mallesons Stephen Jacques, have<br />
licenses to operate here. Other well-known firms such as Slake. Dawson Waldron, H4unt </p>

and Hunt, Minter Ellison to name a few are also keen to enter China &amp; Whday e much to<br />
offer. Australia's services sector is among the most advanced in the developed world. Moreover,<br />
it hats mi established record of achievement and contacts throughout the. Asia-Pacific region.<br />
The growth of our two-way investmient links is a sign of a maturing economic relationship.<br />
Australian contracted investment in China has grown strongly in recent years and is now<br />
around $ 5 billion. Australia is one of the top destinations for Chinese investment abroad.<br />
Growth in China has been the result of economic reform and the opening u p of the Chinese<br />
economy which began in 1978 udder Denzg Xiaoping. That gxowth has been good for the<br />
Chinese people, for economiues in the region and for tha world economy. MoreoVer, the<br />
rapid development of trading and investment links between China and countries inthe Asia-<br />
Pacific region has been importanit in engendering a sense of commuhity and4 shared interests<br />
among regional countries. The recent reaffirmation of cbntinued commitment t6 reform by<br />
China's leaders is therefore a very -welcome sign of continuity for China's Auktraliahi<br />
business parters; and for the relationship generally. My firm conviction athat government<br />
works best when it allows the enterprise of individuals full scope to flourish; when it<br />
unshackles btisiness from the often unnecessary regulations and bureaucracy that tie down<br />
the dynamism and creativity of business. In Australia*, my governmenrt has takena number<br />
of significant measures to lift national savings, Ito improvi flexibility and competitiveness in<br />
our labour market, and to lift the constraints on small business.<br />
My government is strongly commtitted to an ongoing micro-economnic reform: programime<br />
which will produ~ c a more competitive Australian economy. That in turn will help the<br />
efforts of Australian companies as they develop their business in China.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen, I am particularly pleased to have 6ad this opportunity to talk about<br />
our economic relationship with China in general and Shanghai in particular. Shanghai will<br />
continue to occupy a special place in the Australia-China relationship. Qur busines<br />
communities have built up over many years a strong reservoir of goodwill and miutual trust.<br />
This lunch is fine evidence of that.<br />
Our links with Shanghai have a dimension that is important to the development of<br />
Australia's overall relationship with China. Our early cooperation through Baoshau has<br />
meant that Shanghai has been important to the growth of pem, onal contacts between our two<br />
nations. Some of China's mnost important leaders, including President Axang Zernin, have<br />
held important posts in Shanghai. In those ' posts, he his predecessors and successors have<br />
come to know Australia well and the contribution that we can make to China.<br />
What I have seen and heard over the past two days hits given me gret cordiderice in<br />
Shanghai's prospects. It is an extraordinary city. It is eleven years since I last visited it and<br />
it is almost urecognisable. The change-that has occurred over that 1I year period is quite<br />
phenomenal1 and it is no exaggeration to say that over tb6 last two days I have witnessed a </p>

tiny fraction of the activity that is involved in the area of the world that is iridustrialising at a<br />
faster rate and at a more intense maniner than any other part of thc globe:.<br />
I congratulate those who have been responsible. for this. I wvish them well in the future-I<br />
offer on behalf of the Australian Goverument, the Australian business community, and tbe<br />
Australian people a partnership, a partnership that recognises that there are differences. You<br />
have your way of doing things in China, we have our way of doing things. in Australia.' But<br />
providing there is a mature understanding~ of those differences and that the relationship is<br />
always as a proper relationship between two dignified, sovereign counties should be based<br />
on mutual self respect then there is every prospect that through concentrating ort the future<br />
goals that we may share and concentratifig on the ways which we can com~ plemtent each<br />
other, particularly in the area of economics, comm~ erce and business, there is every prospect<br />
to believe that an already close and valuable relationship to both partners can grow even<br />
more in the future and that subsequentt Prime inisters, of Australiaaxd % ubsrquent business<br />
leaders of Australia can see the associati on * between Chinia and Australia and every start of<br />
an economnic life as being one of the most of natural things in the world,<br />
To the Chamber, maylI take this opportunity of publicly thun~ ing the Vice Mayor of<br />
Shanghai for the very great courtegy that he has, -extended to me wA through him can I thank<br />
the -people of Shanghai for the great hospitality and friendliness that they have demonstrated<br />
towards mne and my party. I have io say to you, Mr Vice Mayor, that walking along the<br />
Buid last night with that very large and enthusiastic gathertng of people, I fell as though it<br />
were February or March of 1996, on the eve of o-or election rather than in March of 1997. It<br />
was very welcome and it was a nice taste of the innate fi-iendliness of the: people of your<br />
city. I wish you well. I come with the goodwill of the Australian~ people and of the<br />
Australian Government.<br />
Thank you-</p>
