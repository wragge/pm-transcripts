NQ 87 DAE 17 June 1974<br />
STATEMENT BY PRIME IaNISTER AFTER FRENCH NUCLEAR WEAPONS TEST<br />
The Prime Minister, Mr Whitlam, said today that<br />
the Australian Government had reason to believe that the<br />
French Government had exploded a nuclear weapon device in the<br />
atmosphere over Mururoa atoll today 17 June.<br />
The Prime Minister said that it was a matter of<br />
9 deep concern to the Australian Government that the French<br />
Government had proceeded to yet another program of nuclear<br />
testing in the Pacific, which was likely to lead to the<br />
deposit of radio active fallout within Australian territory.<br />
The feelings of the Australian Government and people against<br />
these tests had been made kn~ own in the past in the clearest<br />
way. Nothing had changed in the Australian attitude since<br />
' I last year. The Prime Minister said: " The fact that this<br />
further test has been held is all the more regrettable<br />
because a new French Government is now in office, and<br />
because I have sent a message to the new French President<br />
expressing the sincere desire to develop relations between<br />
our two Governments and peoples. These relations have been<br />
regrettably affected during recent years by the dispute over<br />
nuclear testing in the Paz-ific, which we had not sought but<br />
which had become inevitable when our repeated protests were<br />
consistently ignored."<br />
The Australian Government had noted the French<br />
Government's statements expressing an intention to cease<br />
/ 2 </p>
<p>2-<br />
atmospheric testing after the present series was completed.<br />
As Senator Willesee had pointed out. these statements were<br />
a step in the right direction, but the French Government<br />
had not given the Australian Government any satisfactory<br />
commitment that further atmospheric tests would not be<br />
held. The new French Government could not claim to be in<br />
ignorance of the strong feelings of the Australian people<br />
that there should be no atmospheric test in the Pacific, or<br />
indeed anywhere. 9<br />
The Prime Minister recalled that on 22 June 1975<br />
the International Court of Justice had made an order<br />
granting to Australia interim measures of protection which<br />
required France to refrain from conducting any further tests<br />
which might lead to the deposit of radio active fallooat on<br />
Australian soil. This order of the Court had been ignored by<br />
France in 1975 and was now being ignored again. MIr ? 7hitlam<br />
said that he had hoped that the French Government would abide<br />
by this order and be prepared to co-operate in having this<br />
continuing dispute resolved in a responsible mrainer by the<br />
International Court in accordance with international law.<br />
This had not proved to be the case. but the Prime Pinister<br />
reaffirmed that, for its part, Australia would continue to<br />
seek resolution of the dispute by the Court, and work vigorously<br />
elsewhere for a complete cessation of nuclear weapons testing. </p>
