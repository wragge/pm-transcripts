    <content><![CDATA[<p>GRIMSHAW:</p>
<p>With me now in the studio is Prime Minister John Howard.  Prime Minister, thanks for your time.  If Australians do turn away from Bali I guess it would be understandable but do the terrorists win?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>In the short-term they do.  Whenever they achieve the goal of frightening people away or disrupting an economy or unsettling a government, they have a short-term victory but it's the long-term victory, the long-term outcome that results.  I'm sorry to have to say this but we're going to have to endure this kind of thing in our region for some time into the future.  There isn't going to be an easy victory over terrorism.  I wish I could tell your viewers otherwise.  We must, of course, understand though that this event in Bali, which affects us a lot because we love the place and a lot of our fellow Australians go there, it does not automatically translate into Australia being more vulnerable to a domestic attack.  I think we have to keep those two things separate.  It's a terrible outcome for the Balinese people and of course I grieve with all Australians for those of our fellow countrymen and women who have lost family members - that young 16 year old boy, the lady from Newcastle.  I mean they're innocently having a holiday.  It's a terrible loss and it's a terribly brutal world that's produced that outcome.</p>
<p> GRIMSHAW:</p>
<p>You've said it doesn't necessarily translate into a potential attack here, but Mick Keelty told us on Today this morning that it's almost possible to police this sort of attack.  If a terrorist can walk into a Bali restaurant with a backpack full of explosives, why can't it happen here?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Tracy, it could, and every time virtually I do an interview like this, I say I can't guarantee it won't happen.  The point I'm making is that the terrorist network is not as organised and is not as widespread and is not as insidious in this country as it is in Indonesia.  That's not to say there's not a problem and that's why we've strengthened the laws.  London demonstrated that there could be a homegrown attack in a society very similar to our own.  And British society and Australia society has a great more deal similarities than Australian society and Indonesian society.  But I'm just trying to keep a sense of perspective.  It's important in my position that I be very upfront with people.  It's also important that I not exaggerate anything and this is a terrible event and I feel deeply for the people of Bali as well as for those who've lost loved ones from Australia.</p>
<p> GRIMSHAW:</p>
<p>Indonesia is on heightened alert.  Are we on some form of heightened alert?  Might we see crackdowns on terrorist sympathisers or terrorist cells here in Australia in coming days and weeks?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well once again the response needs to be different because we don't have any information, as I speak, justifying a lift in the terrorist alert from what's called medium, and medium means is that there could be a terrorist attack in Australia but we don't have any specific information that there's likely to be one.  If there were specific information well we'd lift the terror alert.  But the point I'm simply making is there is an organised group in Indonesia.  I don't think there's much doubt that somebody associated with Jemaah Islamiah carried out this attack, although we don't have direct proof of that yet but the signs are of that yet but the signs are irresistible that JI was involved.</p>
<p>  GRIMSHAW:</p>
<p>President Yudhoyono has warned of the likelihood of more attacks there and we're hearing reports that Australian expatriates have had text messages of possible warnings, specifically naming Seminyak.  On your understanding might they be credible?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I've asked that the Federal Police check that out and... but I, as of a little while ago I hadn't heard of any credible suggestions.  But Tracy, when you're living in an atmosphere like this there are a lot of rumours.  I mean we have been warning in general terms that Bali is a dangerous place to visit . The whole of Indonesia is and we've been actually saying, talking about the possibility of bomb attacks now in our travel advisories.  Now people have decided, notwithstanding that, to go and I understand that, because people have got a right to make their own decisions, but we have an obligation to lay information before them.</p>
<p> GRIMSHAW:</p>
<p>The fact that Australians have begun flocking back to Bali in record numbers, Tony Abbott is among them, does that indicate we've become complacent about the risk?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, I think it indicates we're all human.  After the passage of time, a period of two or three years goes by, it's an attractive place, the Balinese are lovely people, it's a good economic holiday, it's very close, all of those things are very compelling and it's a very important part of the Indonesian economy.  But that's human nature, Tracy.  There'll be an exodus and I imagine that in the years to come some will go back, although I think sadly for the Balinese, it will be a lot slower and be a lot fewer people on this occasion.</p>
<p> GRIMSHAW:</p>
<p>Alright, thank you for your time.</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Pleasure.</p>
