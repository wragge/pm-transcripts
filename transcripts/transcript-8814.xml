IP D PRIME MINIISTER<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
SPEECH AT THE NATIONAL PRESS CLUB, CANBERRA, 9 FEBRUARY 199<br />
" INVESTING IN THE NATION"<br />
When I opened this campaign on Sunday I said that the main issues were going to be the<br />
economy, unemployment and the protection of our way of life.<br />
The statement we have released today goes to the heart of those issues.<br />
If we are to reduce unemployment the revolution in our economy must continue.<br />
But we must take the people with us. Our ambition must remain a fair, just and cohesive<br />
democracy. That is why we must confront the realities of unemployment.<br />
But the reality is that unemployment will not be easily reduced.<br />
Growth is too slow. It is slow here. It is slower still in most other parts of the world.<br />
And at the same time our work places are changing.<br />
Employers are replacing the people who once worked for them with new technologies and<br />
new systems, more people are working part-. time, there are more -women in the workforce.<br />
Confronting the reality of unemployment means providing a social net to ease the<br />
hardship. It also means providing all the training opportunities we can.<br />
But above-all -else it means we* must create more-growth.<br />
Squarely faced, our problems are daunting, without question. </p>
<p>2<br />
But the same realistic appraisal of our position, gives every reason for confidence in what<br />
we can do, and pride in what we have done.<br />
We have real strengths on which we can build.<br />
We have them particularly in the enterprise of private companies in the energy and<br />
initiative of small to medium sized businesses who are now showing the way in<br />
Australia's drive to develop an international export-oriented economy.<br />
This is where we can provide a spur to economic growth and employment.<br />
Today's statement offers new incentives to business in Australia small, medium and<br />
large. It offers an environment for free enterprise as competitive as any in the OECD, and<br />
competitive with most in Asia.<br />
The Statement is modest in size but because it is so focussed, so targetted, it can mark a<br />
new age for Australian business.<br />
The One Nation statement we brought down nearly a year ago was designed to increase<br />
investment through public spending on projects of long term value to the nation while<br />
private investment was subdued.<br />
One Nation reflected our determination to marry social and economic imperatives. To<br />
meet short term needs without sacrificing our responsibility to the long term interests of<br />
Australia. Today's statement reflects the same deermination.<br />
The vast majority of the measures outlined in One Nation have been enacted or<br />
implemented.<br />
As a Labor Prime Minister, I am proud of the decisions we made in One Nation and at<br />
other times during the year watershed decisions, such as the establishment of a National<br />
Training Authority, the deregulation of civil aviation, the construction of a National Rail<br />
Highway, an environmental overhaul of our greatest inland river system.<br />
These are great projects of enduring value to Australia<br />
I am equally proud of the decisions announced in the Youth Statement and the Budget that<br />
directly assist the unemployed.'<br />
-It-is partly as a result-of One-Nation that the Australian economy has grown in the past<br />
twelve months, while other economies have slipped back.<br />
Modest as the growth is, we might take some small measure of satisfaction in the fact that<br />
what we achieved last year we achieved ourselves and against the odds: against the </p>
<p>international trend and with much of our corporate sector concentrating on reducing debt<br />
and cutting costs.<br />
There can be no onc now wbo does not understand how imperative it is to be competitive,<br />
to be international, to go into the world, and to go especially where the world is growing<br />
fastest the Asia Pacific.<br />
The truth is that the race for competitiveness never ends. This time five years ago it was<br />
the goal. It is the goal now. It will be the goal, we can be sure, in five years or ten years<br />
time. The thing to remember is that we are now in the race. Unlike a decade ago, we are<br />
competitors. And each year we are doing better.<br />
Amid the hardship wrought by the recession and the blow to our confidence it delivered,<br />
in times when many of the signs are negative and might be read as indicating the necessity<br />
for retreat there are also sure signs that we can advance.<br />
We are more than twenty five per cent more competitive than we were a decade ago.<br />
We have the lowest inflation in the world and, Victoria notwithstanding, the lowest<br />
number of industrial disputes for thirty years.<br />
These are the changes which have put us in with a chance a better chance in many<br />
respects than Australia has ever had before.<br />
The evidence is manifest. We produce one third as much again as we did in the early<br />
eighties. Our exports have doubled and are now nearly a quarter of everything we produce.<br />
More and more of them go to Asia.<br />
We are now a much more competitive country by virtue of conscious decisions, by virtue<br />
of conscious decisions by Government, business and workers.<br />
It is the result of our choosing not to drift, but to take up the challenge. It is what<br />
Australians have done by and for themselves.<br />
A recent McKinsey Report to the Australian Manufacturing Council attests to the success<br />
of a large number of Australian businesses which have grown up in the past few years.<br />
McKinsey found 700 high value-added manufacturing firms in Australia playing a<br />
significant part in Australia's exportgrowth.<br />
The Report says: </p>
<p>The entrepreneurship and ingenuity of these firms is exciting. Throughout the<br />
study, we have been constantly amazed and inspired by the stories of these<br />
individual firms, their determination and their success.<br />
The authors point out their success has largely gone unnoticed in Australia.<br />
Yet these firms were responsible for over $ 8 billion in exports in 1990-91 and<br />
McKinsey's estimate the figure is likely to double by 1997.<br />
These companies are exemplars of the change in the business and industrial culture of<br />
Australia. They are marked by the dynamism of their leadership; by their flexibility; their export<br />
orientation and their success in capturing niche markets, particularly in Asia.<br />
These are the Australian companies of the future. The companies which will provide<br />
work rewarding, interesting work for our children.<br />
A large percentage of these companies were " born global", meaning that they considered<br />
the world as their market from the first day of their existence.<br />
There is no better evidence of the emergence of an international business frame of mind.<br />
They are the off spring of a new export culture.<br />
The McKinsey Report is a significant indication of the direction economic policy should<br />
take. A sign that recovery will be hastened, and jobs created, by the rapid expansion of<br />
vigorous and innovative small and medium sized businesses in the main, companies.<br />
That is on the assumption that the number of these firms continues to increase at the<br />
present rate.<br />
A principal aim of today's statement is to Increase that rate.<br />
The national quest upon which we are now embarked is for two things production and<br />
employment. One Nation promoted these things with public investment through an ambitious program<br />
of infrastructure spending.<br />
But the private economy has been slow to respond and we have not had the large<br />
ncemetsto production and employment which we need.<br />
But One Nation never pretended that the large and continuing increments to production<br />
and employment Australia needs could be delivered by or in the public sector. </p>
<p>These things must come from the private economy, from private investment, from private<br />
businesses like the ones McKinsey has described.<br />
A large part of today's Statement focuses on this the role of the Australian company in<br />
the dynamism of Australian business.<br />
The measures I am announcing will make the Australian company a more effective<br />
device, playing a more effective role as an instrument of national achievement and<br />
enterprise. The Australian company, large and small, will be the basic device that powers our<br />
innovation, marshals our capital and our productive power.<br />
And we all know when that happens the other thing marshalled is employment.<br />
We have decided that the simplest and most effective way to encourage Australian<br />
companies to work for Australia is to lower their tax burden.<br />
So, under a Labor Government, on July 1 this year the company tax rate will be reduced<br />
from 39 cents in the dollar to 33 cents.<br />
Coming on top of the accelerated depreciation allowances announced in One Nation, this<br />
will make the Australian corporate tax system highly competitive within the OECD<br />
countries. But, more importantly, we will also be competitive with the countries in our region.<br />
Australian companies will thus be much better placed to trade with Asia the region<br />
where it is going to matter most-<br />
I might add that it should give Dr Hewson food for thought: under Labor a business tax<br />
rate of 33 per cent, under Fightback a rate of 42 per cent, plus a 15 per cent GST.<br />
in One Nation we introduced a Development Allowance for projects involving<br />
investments of $ 50 million or more.<br />
By the end of December 1992 we had received applications to a value well in excess of<br />
$ 100 billion $ 130 billion in fact.<br />
This of course is a wonderfully encouraging response.<br />
We intend to bring forward -the development of as many of these projects as we can.<br />
But we are also determined to enlist new ones. I-</p>
<p>To do this a Labor Government will establish a generalised Investment Allowance which<br />
will help small to medium sized companies invest in job creating industries.<br />
It will also help bring forward the enormous stock of projects which are already seeking<br />
the development allowance.<br />
Increased investment is the key to economic expansion and the key to higher employment.<br />
But the corporate sector has not been investing enough.<br />
It has been cutting costs at the same time as the banks have tightened their lending<br />
guidelines. New businesses and businesses wanting the necessary finance to grow have been<br />
subjected to more stringent tests.<br />
As business stirs the banks must respond. Australian business must have access to finance<br />
when it needs it.<br />
In a speech late last year I outlined the need to encourage a new culture in Australian<br />
banking.<br />
The consequences of lending based on the value of security have been all too evident in<br />
recent years, as first inflated asset prices saw credit expand rapidly and then collapse as<br />
asset prices fell.<br />
Instead, we need a culture which lays more stress on establishing close relationships<br />
between banks and their customers.<br />
I encouraged the banks to provide extra training for staff so that they can better evaluate<br />
the risk and potential of proposals; and to be much more prepared to lend on cash flow.<br />
If we are to develop and expand innovative small and medium business in Australia, this<br />
sort of closer relationship banking is essential.<br />
If Australian banks can develop their skills of evaluation and monitoring, the rewards for<br />
business will be very considerable.<br />
So too, obviously, will be the rewards for banks.<br />
In this we have something to learn from the German and Japanese banking systems.<br />
While we should not be imitating their systems, it does provide another lesson in the<br />
strength to be derived from partnerships in the economy. </p>
<p>In future, to ensure that our banking system is working effectively, under a Labor<br />
Government the Reserve Bank will establish the machinery to regularly monitor the<br />
conduct and patterns of bank lending.<br />
In addition, the Reserve Bank will conduct quarterly surveys of small businesses to<br />
establish a better understanding of their relationships with banks.<br />
To provide the RBA with more detailed information and advice, the Reserve Bank will<br />
also establish a large and representative Advisory Council whose members will be<br />
principals of small and medium businesses.<br />
To encourage banks to establish the appropriate structures and to increase the lending to<br />
small and medium business, the Reserve Bank will pay market interest rates on bank<br />
deposits it holds, thereby increasing the revenue of banks by about $ 140 million.<br />
Mr Chairman<br />
As you will see there are more measures in this Statement than it is possible for me to<br />
address here. Let me mention just two two which illustrate the broad front on which we<br />
have to work.<br />
The solutions to our problems depend on both on our continuing willingness to change<br />
and our ability to adapt to change.<br />
Let me mention just two examples. There is a trend towards part time work in the<br />
economy and there is a need to provide for unemployed people as much access to this<br />
work as possible.<br />
Consequently today's Statement changes existing programs of assistance for the<br />
unemployed to provide greater incentives for recipients of allowances to take part-time<br />
and casual work.<br />
These measures have the dual purpose of enabling people to supplement their allowances<br />
and maintain their links with the labour market, which means increasing their chances of<br />
gaining permanent employment as the economy improves.<br />
To become a truly competitive nation we must ensure that our workforce is adequately<br />
educated and trained, and able to adapt to the needs of an evolving economy.<br />
We must also recognise that in some cases it is appropriate to devise special policies or<br />
programs which encourage people to look for work.<br />
One such group is women with young children.<br />
The level of women's participation in the labour market is remarkable: it ' has doubled in<br />
the post-war period, and is now increasing at a faster rate than men's. </p>
<p>These measures move child care into the 21st century.<br />
8<br />
The future growth of the Australian economy and the living standards of Australians will<br />
benefit from the participation of women in the workforce.<br />
But there are barriers to this.<br />
For the more than 50 per cent of women with children under 12 in the workforce, child<br />
care is a paramount concern.<br />
Since 1983 we have increased the number of child care places more than four-fold, and<br />
our program of fee relief has made child care affordable for low and middle income<br />
families. Nevertheless almost two-thirds of working women who use child care use informal care,<br />
often because they are unable to find, or afford, places in the formal child care system.<br />
It is time we began to treat the needs of working parents with the same seriousness as<br />
education or aged care.<br />
It is time we faced up to the implications of child care as an employment related program<br />
and recognised that it is a cost necessarily incurred by parents in the earning of income.<br />
In recognition of this we have decided both to greatly expand our child care program and<br />
to fundamentally reform its design.<br />
First, we will dramatically increase the number of funded places with the aim of meeting<br />
projected demand for work-related child care by the year 2001. We have set an interim<br />
goal of meeting 84 per cent of demand by 1997.<br />
Second, in recognition of the high cost of care, we will introduce a 30 per cent cash rebate,<br />
in addition to existing fee relief arrangements, for all families using child care while in<br />
employment, training, studying or looking for work.<br />
This cash rebate, which will be claimable through Medicare offices, is vastly superior to a<br />
tax rebate. The amount received will depend on child care expenses actually paid, and not<br />
on how much tax is paid. And unlike a tax rebate which can only be claimed once a year,<br />
parents will be able to collect their cash rebate as often as once a week.<br />
The maximum cash rebate will be $ 1466 a year for one child, or $ 3182 a year for two or<br />
more children.<br />
-1Tdijto ensure that-child-careis safe and secure,. and that it provides children with a<br />
stimulating envirornent, we have decided to introduce a system of national accreditation<br />
of child care centres. </p>
<p>Taken with other child care initiatives outlined in the Statement, they mean that Australia<br />
becomes the first nation to put together a coherent and integrated program which caters to<br />
the needs of the working parents.<br />
It is a program to be proud of, and one that I hope will make the often stressful job of<br />
juggling work and family responsibilities easier for working parents.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen<br />
As said before, today's Statement is modest in size. It will add $ 692 million to the<br />
Budget in 1993-94, declining to $ 387 million by 1996-97.<br />
We will achieve these modest costs principally by reorganising company tax<br />
arrangements and reducing our holding in the Commonwealth Bank to 51 per cent.<br />
We remain committed to maintaining a majority stake in the bank. We think there is a<br />
place in the banking system for a majority Government -owned major bank.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen<br />
It remains to urge you to read the Statement. It contains much more than it is convenient<br />
for me to talk about just now.<br />
The salient thing is this. The Australian economy undoubtedly has in it the potential for<br />
growth. Being close to the most rapidly growing markets in the world offers a potential we have<br />
never known before. Already new Australian companies have emerged to seize the<br />
chance. The Asia-Pacific region is one great advantage. Much that we have done here, as these<br />
new companies testify, has created a number of others.<br />
Having a robust democratic system, a broad consensus on the need for social justice,<br />
including justice in the labour market, and believing as we do in social improvement gives<br />
us an even greater advantage. It gives us both strength and incentive.<br />
My belief is that these things must never be threatened that we will not make progress of<br />
any kind by subjecting these values to attack.<br />
GXood policy-freats -the economy and -society. in concert.<br />
Today, I believ q, is an example of good policy. </p>
<p>4. What we propose for the Australian company should help create levels of energy and<br />
excellence we have rarely if ever seen in our history companies suited to the<br />
opportunities available.<br />
It should liberate the private sector for growth and employment.<br />
By our radical improvements to our child care system we also recognise the social needs<br />
which change creates.<br />
That is the essential thing radical change where it is necessary, but always sensitive to<br />
social needs and our social goals. </p>
