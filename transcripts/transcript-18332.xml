Prime Minister Julia Gillard today announced the Australian Government would provide $15 million towards the redevelopment of Bellerive Oval.</p>
<p>This Commonwealth funding will contribute to the extension of the Southern Stand boosting the capacity to about 20,000. </p>
<p>The Members and Players Pavilion will also be extended and allow other sports including AFL to house their Tasmanian headquarters at the oval.</p>
<p>Bellerive Oval currently has a capacity of around 16,000 and over past summers has regularly sold out major sporting contests. </p>
<p>Once the redevelopment is complete, more Tasmanians will get to see more sporting matches right here in Hobart.</p>
<p>In 2015, Bellerive Oval will be ready to host matches as part of the Cricket World Cup.  In addition the upgrade will lock in North Melbourne AFL matches at Bellerive.</p>
<p>The project will also boost tourism in and around Hobart.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister thanked the Member for Franklin, Julie Collins, for her continued representations on behalf of the people of Tasmania.</p>
<p>Bellerive Oval is a much-loved ground for Tasmanians and the Federal Government is proud to be working with the State Government in this redevelopment. </p>
