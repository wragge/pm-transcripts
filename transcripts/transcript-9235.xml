TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING, MP<br />
DOORSTOP, STAFFORD STATE SCHOOL, STAFFORD, BRISBANE<br />
16 MAY 1994<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
PM: Just a couple of words to say that I was very pleased to be with the<br />
Premier, at Stafford, where we saw, at first hand, Queensland in its<br />
successful efforts to develop Asian language studies and, particularly,<br />
language and the facility of language, through the Queensland school<br />
system and now extending that as a result of decisions taken at COAG<br />
at Queensland's initiative, to extend Asian language teaching across<br />
Australia. And, I had the pleasure of announcing a $ 48 million<br />
program in the Budget to begin this exercise. But, I wanted to<br />
congratulate the Premier on the initiative at COAG and I think what we<br />
have seen here today is an illustration of the competency of Australia,<br />
the facility of Australian kids mastering at least one substantial primary<br />
Asian language.<br />
WG: Could I just say that we now have about 100,000 students in<br />
Queensland schools learning an Asian language and I think this is<br />
going to be tremendously valuable to their education, but also to the<br />
Queensland economy in the years ahead. I think it is also important in<br />
terms of the development of our national identity and future<br />
generations seeing themselves as part of a multicultural country in the<br />
Asia-Pacific and not a European colony on the other side of the world.<br />
Queensland is very pleased with the progress of our program to date.<br />
We did propose at COAG the development of a national strategy and<br />
the working group chaired by Kevin Rudd, the Director of our office of<br />
Cabinet, has come up with a report that has been endorsed and it has<br />
been a cooperative effort between the Federal Government and State<br />
Governments. And, from a Queensland point of view, we are<br />
committed to the Asian languages program, but we are absolutely<br />
delighted to see in the Federal Budget a substantial funding<br />
commitment towards taking this program national. Among other things<br />
it will mean a lot more teachers coming into the system, and the </p>
<p>teachers are absolutely vital. And, it will mean, we believe, in a couple<br />
of years time we will have Asian languages right down through the<br />
high schools, down to as far as grade three. And, it is at that young<br />
age, as you saw today, that these kids have such a tremendous facility<br />
to learn and to understand a foreign language.<br />
J: Prime Minster, what has been decided by Federal Cabinet regarding<br />
the republic, and talking about the republic through the Government?<br />
PM: Well I noticed a report today in the Sydney Morning Herald, which was<br />
more zealous than it should have been, obviously, someone has<br />
provided to a journalist some details of proposals put to the Cabinet,<br />
but not adopted by the Cabinet, about general development of<br />
understanding about the Constitution. Now, the Cabinet will return to<br />
this question at some point, no doubt. Because I think that one of the<br />
things which the Republican Advisory Committee revealed in its report<br />
was the dearth of understanding, particularly in schools, of our<br />
constitutional arrangements. I mean the Premier and I were just<br />
saying coming in the car that we often are concerned about children<br />
losing their enthusiasm for public processes and for politics and for<br />
Government, and being disillusioned by it. And one can understand<br />
this when there is not even a primary understanding of the nature of<br />
the Constitution and the role of the Commonwealth and the federal<br />
system. But the Cabinet didn't decide at this point to develop or<br />
activate or move on, or pick up the recommendations of this particular<br />
report, and therefore, whoever has given information out didn't say,<br />
because they probably didn't know, that the Cabinet decided not to act<br />
upon it, certainly at this stage.<br />
J: Is there anything for the monarchists to fear? I see that New South<br />
Wales has said that if a kit does come out they won't accept it.<br />
PM: Who said that, by the way?<br />
J: The New South Wales...<br />
PM: Well this is the sort of knee-jerk response, which is pretty pathetic in<br />
Australia. I find that surprising because basically the Premier of New<br />
South Wales believes in the republican case. But that is not the point<br />
of any such proposal. The point of such a proposal is not to put a yes<br />
for no case about the republic, but rather it is just to fill in some of the<br />
gaps which are not easily understood in our constitution, because they<br />
are not explicitly referred to. For instance, the Cabinet is not referred<br />
to in the constitution in a way which would give anyone to understand,<br />
other than the Executive Council for instance, that the Cabinet is the<br />
power, the principal power in the Executive. The reference in the<br />
constitution is to the Executive Council, I mean all these sorts of<br />
things, which I think, a proper understanding of the constitution would<br />
reveal. </p>
<p>J: Prime Minister that we might help out with troops in Rwanda, can<br />
you tell us whether the Government is considering that? I-there is a<br />
considerable down side, isn't there?<br />
PM: Well, we are considering and I think we have generally responded<br />
positively to proposals by the United Nations in these sorts of<br />
exercises, in this case looking at the provision of aid and facilities to<br />
these people. But at this stage I don't think the UN have quite<br />
developed their proposals, and hence we are not in a position to say<br />
whether we would be part of any operation or not. But our general<br />
policy has been one of sympathy with these kinds of exercises and we<br />
have committed people to them in the past.<br />
J: Some Defence leaders, today, said that they would prefer a peace<br />
plan in place first before you considered...<br />
PM: Well, I mean, peace plans can't be hatched up when everyone thinks<br />
they should be. We -have seen this in various places around the<br />
world, but still you have got a very big humanitarian problem there to<br />
be dealt with, and the UN is obviously thinking about it.<br />
J: Have you got anything to say on John Hewson's drop again in<br />
approval, and on the re-emergence of Fightback?<br />
PM: Well Fi ghtba c k he said was dead and buried two weekends ago at the<br />
retreat, and now we find that it isn't really at all. That as I have been<br />
saying the philosophical attachment of the Liberal Party to some of the<br />
brutal nostrums of Fightback is basically alive and well. And Mr Reith<br />
is telling us so, flushing Dr Hewson out who confirmed his view. So,<br />
the Liberals just never seem to learn. That is, in saying that they are<br />
abandoning it and seeking a more, if you like, inclusive complexion on<br />
their policies, they then go back to endorse all of the things that, of<br />
course, Mr Downer said on the weekend that there wasn't going to be<br />
any tax rises, only outlays cuts. So, presumably, they would be the<br />
same outlays cuts which they had in Fightback. And they were the<br />
very things that made it very clear that Fightback was the antithesis of<br />
inclusion. It was about basically straightening up the poor,<br />
straightening up the disadvantaged. So, at least we know where the<br />
Liberal Party stands. It still stands four square behind the philosophy<br />
of the package which was rejected at the last election.<br />
J: So, Fightback is live and well, rather than dead and buried?<br />
PM: Well, it is obviously part and parcel of their mainstream philosophy.<br />
They haven't been able to move away from this hard edged economic<br />
rationalism which they have adopted, and Dr Hewson's attacks upon<br />
multicultural ism last year, on school teachers and renters, and all<br />
these other categories of people was, I think, only giving you evidence<br />
of the view that Fightback held, and basically is still with them. </p>
<p>J: Prime Minister, the latest Morgan Poll has Labor ahead and Hewson at<br />
an all time low, will you maintain your lead until the next election?<br />
PM: Well that is what I would most certainly like to do. There is no point in<br />
coming second in this business.<br />
J: does it have you towards an early election?<br />
PM: I answered that weeks ago, that question.<br />
J: Premier, have you reached a decision yet on the Daintree package?<br />
WG: As I said the other day, we are regarding the offer in the Federal<br />
Budget as a very generous offer, and one that we propose to take<br />
advantage of. We weren't aware of the full details of the funding and<br />
we are still talking to the Federal Minister, or rather our Minister will<br />
now be talking to the Federal Minister, and seeking to work out a<br />
cooperative program to implement that, and to put the whole of the rain<br />
forest back into the rain forest.<br />
J: Do you still think it is likely that you will have go for four or five years,<br />
rather than three?<br />
WG: Well that is one of the things that I have got our Environment Minister,<br />
I have asked her to talk to the Federal Minister about. She has been<br />
away and only got back this weekend, and I spoke to her this morning<br />
and she will now pursue that. As I said to you last week our Budget<br />
was locked up last Monday, but we regard the offer as too good and<br />
too generous to walk away from. So, one way or another we are going<br />
to find a way to access it.<br />
PM: Can I just say that I am very pleased with the Premiers response to<br />
that. I think it is a great collaborative thing that we are doing here, and<br />
I think again, it shows how the Federal Government of Australia and<br />
the State Government of Queensland, Labor Governments, can work<br />
together to do some of these things. When this area was declared a<br />
heritage area. and there were substantial exclusions, one is this area<br />
called the so-called hole in the heart. And to be able to bring that area<br />
back to pristine, a pristine forest, which will be difficult, but which is<br />
possible, it is best to be begun with an acquisition program to see that<br />
the damage doesn't continue and development in the area doesn't<br />
proceed. So, let me say, I think for one of the great areas of Australia,<br />
of its heritage, of its national estate, the Daintree Rain Forest and<br />
Queenslands management of it, I think, and for the Queensland, and<br />
indeed, Australian tourist industry I think this is a really good thing to<br />
be doing, I am very pleased about it.<br />
J: The Premier said that you had fallen in love with the Daintree, is that a<br />
fair assessment? </p>
<p>PM: Well I think very few countries will have the joy of preserving areas like<br />
these. I think anybody who has actually been across to Daintree falls<br />
in love with it. The notion of this forest extending from the high<br />
reaches of the mountains to the beach and repairing that damage<br />
which has been done, preserving for ever this important ecosystem for<br />
Australians is a tremendously good thing to be doing.<br />
J: Do you think business fully understands the value of a clean<br />
environment that we have in Australia relative to the rest of the world?<br />
PM: Well certainly the tourist industry does. And I think to see tourism<br />
grow they need these primary assets to grow on.<br />
