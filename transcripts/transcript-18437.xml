The Gillard Government today released new proposals to raise the quality of vocational education and training across the country.</p>
<p>The Government has put $1.75 billion on the table to work with the states and territories to deliver on reforms to the VET system over the next 5 years.</p>
<p>Key measures in the offer to the states and territories include:</p>
<p> * 	Working with the states and territories to ensure courses delivered by the VET sector are subject to independent quality assessment.<br />
 * 	States and territories will be required to implement these independent checks over the next two years.<br />
 * 	States and territories will have to set strict criteria to ensure only quality providers with an established record can access public funding.<br />
 * 	States and territories will be required to provide strategies that will continue to support and strengthen the public providers of vocational education and training (TAFE) over the next five years.<br />
 * 	Each state and territory will be required to implement strategies to improve the quality of VET teaching.</p>
<p>Students training for a job deserve the best possible education.</p>
<p>With high skilled jobs increasing at 2.5 times the rate of other jobs and some 4.1 million Australians not having post-school qualifications, the nation may face a significant shortfall of suitably skilled workers in coming years.</p>
<p>The Government is determined to remove the barriers preventing Australians from accessing further training, but we will not let this come at the cost of quality.</p>
<p>These reforms that will make it possible for more Australians to obtain the high quality skills they need.</p>
<p>The offer of $1.75 billion is in addition to the $7.2 billion the Government will made available to the states and territories over the next five years for the VET system.  </p>
