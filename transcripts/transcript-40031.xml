    <content><![CDATA[<p>I welcome today’s announcement from Clarence House confirming the visit of Their Royal Highnesses The Prince of Wales and The Duchess of Cornwall to Australia from 10-15 November.</p>
<p>The visit will provide an opportunity to showcase Australia’s great regional and urban cities to The Prince and Duchess as they tour Adelaide and Tanunda, Canberra, Sydney, Albany and Perth.</p>
<p>While this will be Their Royal Highnesses’ second joint visit to Australia, it will be the Prince of Wales’ 15th visit and on behalf of the states and territories involved, I look forward to welcoming them back to Australia.</p>
<p>Their tour engagements will focus on areas that encompass Australia’s community, culture and conservation.</p>
<p>I look forward to joining Their Royal Highnesses to mark Remembrance Day in Canberra in our centenary year of the Anzacs.</p>
<p>Lucy and I will be delighted to welcome The Prince and Duchess and expect Australians will be eager to display our country’s hospitality to the Royal couple.</p>
