PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF UNEDITED INTERVIEW WITH IAN McMINN, RADIO<br />
3AW, 9 NOVEMBER 1990<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
McMINN: Prime Minister, thanks for joining me this<br />
afternoon. PM: Pleasure Ian.<br />
O McMINN: How significant do you believe yesterday's<br />
announcement on changes to telecommunications can be both<br />
in two areas'? First of all, in making it more efficient?<br />
Secondly, providing work for Australians?<br />
PM: Well it's hard to overstate the importance of<br />
yesterday's statement on both counts. It will produce<br />
the most competitive telecommunications system in the<br />
world, I think, and it will mean that users, your<br />
listeners, will get the benefits both as individuals on<br />
their household phones and the business community. STD<br />
calls, it's estimated, will come down in charges by about<br />
and this must mean benefits for individuals. But it<br />
must mean economic benefits generally as all sectors of<br />
industry are going to be provided with a more competitive<br />
lower priced system. As far as employment is concerned,<br />
it must mean an increase in jobs within the industry,<br />
both in terms of providing telephones and associated sort<br />
of telecommunications system but also within the<br />
Australian industry as a base for export into the region.<br />
As I said in my speech, we are very fortunately placed.<br />
Asia, the countries of Asia, the near region have about<br />
half the world's population but only about 17% of the<br />
world's 500,000,000 telephones. Now the number of<br />
telephones are going to double by the end of the century<br />
and we will see an enormous growth in demand in the<br />
region and Australian industry is going to be well placed<br />
as it expands now with our own developments to play a<br />
part in meeting the demands of the region.<br />
McMINN: Do you think the unions will accept the plan<br />
that it's virtually open slather after 1997?<br />
PM: Well I believe so because they must see it as part<br />
of a process which is going to expand employment<br />
opportunities, which is going to give them as workers<br />
more jobs and as a union a greater sphere of influence. </p>
<p>McMINN: Now of course right now you'd be also interested<br />
we might just get a few easy ones out of the way.<br />
You'd be interested in how Charles Blunt managed to rack<br />
up $ 270,000 iLn mailing fees.<br />
PM: It's got me licked.<br />
McMINN: You've been working out that one for a while.<br />
PM: No, it -ust occurred to me. I'm just like that.<br />
McMINN: But how did he manage? Is it in fact what<br />
really occurred the National Party used the Leader's<br />
account to pay for part of their election campaign?<br />
PM: I don't know what happened. It's being<br />
investigated:-It would be quite improper for me to<br />
suggest what happened. It sounds strange, just let's say<br />
that. It sounds very strange but the appropriate<br />
investigation will take place.<br />
McMINN: Is it a criminal matter?<br />
PM: I've got no idea, I've got no idea and I certainly<br />
won't make any accusations when I don't know all the<br />
facts. All I'm saying is that everyone, but everyone,<br />
across the political spectrum is saying it's more than<br />
passing strange.<br />
McMINN: It certainly is.<br />
PM: And it's very interesting that the matter arose from<br />
the Opposition asking me a question trying to, apparently<br />
thinking apparently thinking that they were going to nail<br />
US. We're not nailed.<br />
McMINN: No, well $ 278,000 would buy you a lot of stamps.<br />
PM: Yes.<br />
McMINN: Are people entitled to believe they're in a<br />
recession or are you still sticking to the fact that it's<br />
technically not?<br />
PM: It's not a matter of I'm sticking to the fact. I<br />
mean, I don't make the economic definitions. The<br />
economics profession has its definition and that says<br />
that in a technical economic sense that a recession<br />
occurs when you have two successive quarters of negative<br />
economic growth. But I'm not, as I say, nailing my flag<br />
to that particular mast. If people want to use the<br />
phrase, recession, then of course it's appropriate they<br />
do. I mean the word recession is not the monopoly of<br />
professional economists. The fact is that we've had to<br />
slow down the level of activity and there's been a<br />
significant slowing down and there's hurt been involved<br />
which has been necessary because if we hadn't done that<br />
the world would have imposed a much worse solution upon </p>
<p>us. But I mean the word doesn't frighten me at all. I<br />
mean the fact is that's the technical economists<br />
definition of recession and that's all I've said. But<br />
I'm not walking away from the word.<br />
McMINN: Did you and the Treasurer and the Cabinet<br />
realise the damage that would be done when you went, as<br />
you put it, slow down the economy?<br />
PM: Not only realise, it was a necessary intent. We had<br />
the simple fact which you don't have to be an economist<br />
to understand this in the previous year this country<br />
had increased its expenditure by increased its<br />
production of goods by Now the country can't keep on<br />
doing it. You'd just drive the country right into the<br />
ground. You'd just destroy the country if you allowed<br />
that thing to go on. So we had to slow things down.<br />
That was what we intended to slow things down.<br />
McMINN: Well who's fault was that, that we were spending<br />
too much?<br />
PM: Well you had a situation where you had turn-round in<br />
the terms of trade, a massive increase in prices for what<br />
we got at that time and that money was then spent. The<br />
problem was not the acquisition of the means to spend,<br />
the problem was that the economy wasn't producing more.<br />
This economy, let me remind you, for 31 of the 34 years<br />
before we came to power this country was in the control<br />
of the conservatives. The basic economic infrastructure,<br />
the capacity of the economy, the attitudes of the<br />
community were shaped by 31 years of conservative rule<br />
where there was no attempt to have reform, to make our<br />
industry more competitive, to get decent work practices,<br />
decent management practices. You had a situation where<br />
income increased, you didn't have the capacity with our<br />
industrial structure to produce more goods and services.<br />
Now what we're about, what our whole program of<br />
micro-economic reform is about, of which yesterday was an<br />
important part, was precisely that; to make our industry<br />
more efficient, more competitive so that this country can<br />
produce more goods, not only for its consumption here but<br />
importantly, for export.<br />
McMINN: Well I mean no-one will doubt the 31 years out<br />
of 34 but the point is that this is your fourth term in<br />
Government. PM: And look at what's happened in that four terms.<br />
McMINN: What?<br />
PM: OK. Well let me tell you what's happened in the<br />
four terms. In the period before we came to office, the<br />
seven years before we had a situation where nothing was<br />
done in terms of moving to restructure the economy and we<br />
have in our period of office had a rate of employment<br />
growth five times faster than in the previous seven </p>
<p>years. That's what's happened in this period of<br />
Government. Employment growth fives times as fast then<br />
and twice as fast as the rest of the world. We've had a<br />
situation where we are now moving to the point where our<br />
exports of manufactured goods are increasing. Last year<br />
an increase in manufactured exports, the best part of<br />
In this eight years I'll tell you what's happened<br />
in regard to education. Two out of three of our kids<br />
stay on in school now where when I came to office one in<br />
three of our kids stayed on in school. We now have a<br />
situation where I go to Melbourne last week and opened<br />
the first Victorian University in the western suburbs so<br />
that the kids of the relatively less privileged in the<br />
Australian society are now not only staying on at school<br />
but they are going on to TAFE and universities and they<br />
are having universities in their own areas rather than in<br />
other areas. Those are the things that have happened in<br />
this period. We now have an economy which is infinitely<br />
better equipped than it was when I came to office. But<br />
we've still got to do more.<br />
McMINN: Well if it's so glowing, Prime Minister, if it's<br />
so good why everyday I sit behind a microphone listening<br />
to people saying that they're laying off staff, they're<br />
going broke, they can't meet their commitments, they're<br />
worried about their kids future in terms of employment.<br />
Then why is that the case?<br />
PM: Because at this present time things have been slowed<br />
down for the reasons I put it. You couldn't continue to<br />
have the rate of expansion that we were having while we<br />
weren't producing more goods. I mean does anyone believe<br />
that you could go on as a country increasing your<br />
consumption, increasing your consumption by 8% but your<br />
production by You can't keep on doing that so we've<br />
had to deliberately slow things down. But the economy<br />
will recover as we go into next year because we've now<br />
had five successive reductions during this year in the<br />
level of interest rates. With that reduction in interest<br />
rates and with the increases in consumer power, which<br />
will come from the tax cuts in January, and the wage<br />
increases that are now in the pipeline you will have the<br />
situation where there will be the lift in activity but it<br />
will be in the context where we'll be able to sustain it,<br />
as compared to that period before, where we simply<br />
couldn't. McMINN: Do you think people will believe you when you<br />
say that, and I say that with the greatest respect, I've<br />
known you for a long time as you know. I mean you've got<br />
a situation now for the first time in my living memory<br />
you as a preferred Prime Minister is trailing your<br />
opponent and that even takes into the period of time<br />
before you were even in the Parliament. What you're<br />
saying now is that interest rates will come down and<br />
things will be OK. It would appear to me that a lot of<br />
people are saying well we're not sure if Bob Hawke's got<br />
it together again. </p>
<p>PM: Well thety are saying that at the moment and I'm not<br />
losing any sleep about that. What I'd be losing sleep<br />
about was that if I didn't have the guts to take the hard<br />
decisions because I love this country and I'm certainly<br />
not going to refuse to take the hard decisions which are<br />
necessary now to protect the future of this country. I<br />
will not attempt to buy cheap popularity by prejudicing<br />
and mortgaging the future of this country. I've devoted<br />
over 30 years of my life to public life and public<br />
service and 1: haven't done that to now say oh look I<br />
might be a little bit unpopular if I take a tough<br />
decision, therefore I won't take it. That's not the way<br />
I operate.<br />
McMINN: So you don't think you've lost the plot a bit?<br />
PM: No, not at all. We are committed to the goals that<br />
we had when we came to office of creating a more<br />
S competitive Australia and certainly creating a fair<br />
Australia. x've found it repugnant that the kids of<br />
ordinary Australians had a lesser chance of going on in<br />
school and having their talents developed and the kids of<br />
the wealthy went on and had that right. I wanted to see<br />
an Australia where by the time I left office I could look<br />
at it in the face and say, now it doesn't matter what the<br />
income level of your parents is that you've got just as<br />
much chance of being fully educated as if your parents<br />
come from Toorak or Vaucluse. That's the Australia we're<br />
creating and that's what I'm proud of.<br />
McMINN: My uncle works in the electrical trade he's<br />
retired now. He has been trading there for the last<br />
twenty years. He was telling me last year, or this year,<br />
sorry, is the first year that company recorded a loss and<br />
they've had -to lay off a third of their staff and it's<br />
not a huge company, it's about 250 people. They've laid<br />
off 70 people.<br />
PM: Yes, well you know it just is a matter of fact that<br />
if you're going to deliberately slow the economy down to<br />
address that imbalance, you have to just by<br />
definition if you slow the economy down some people are<br />
going to be hurt. I mean if you can tell me a way of<br />
slowing an economy down and it not entailing hurt well<br />
I'd like to know. I mean it's a contradiction in terms.<br />
You can't discharge your obligation of slowing the<br />
economy down and not have hurt.<br />
McMINN: What about Victoria? The other day you were<br />
quoted I believe accurately you were quoted saying<br />
that the disaster called Victoria, or words to that<br />
effect. Why is Victoria so much worse off, it would<br />
appear, than the rest of the country?<br />
PM: Well there's been two things, two points to make.<br />
Victoria is the manufacturing base of Australia, much<br />
more so than NSW and where therefore you had a slowing </p>
<p>down of activity it was going to be affected more.<br />
Secondly, of course, you've had a loss of confidence in<br />
Victoria associated with the financial difficulties that<br />
the Government's hlad. So you take those two things<br />
together and it's worse off. You've got to remember it's<br />
come from a higher base. They had higher levels of<br />
employment, ' Lower levels of unemployment and once those<br />
other two factors come into operation, well you see a<br />
more significant decline in that State.<br />
McMINN: In the past you've admitted mistakes. I mean<br />
it's been one of your strengths. You said that you're<br />
not the fountain of all knowledge and when you've made a<br />
blue you've admitted it. Now I put to you a question I<br />
put to the Premier the other day, Mrs Kirner. That is I<br />
think there'd be a whole lot healthier atmosphere here if<br />
the former Prvemier, John Cain, and the former Treasurer,<br />
Rob Jolly, basically just came out and said there's<br />
probably not a vote in it but it might do something to<br />
the climate -and came out and said look we blew it,<br />
we're sorry.<br />
PM: Well I don't know about Rob Jolly. I haven't<br />
because whatever he may have said didn't get the same<br />
coverage. But I can distinctly recall remarks from John<br />
Cain acknowledging mistakes.<br />
McMINN: Well it certainly, it wouldn't appear to have<br />
made huge press. See, what's happening<br />
PM: Well largely you know, you talk about making huge<br />
press, politicians can say and do things but whether they<br />
get reported or not is another matter. Let me just give<br />
you the specific example, Ian, I mean it is as though<br />
it's a matter of what politicians all we've got to do<br />
is say it and it gets reported. I was down in Victoria<br />
last Friday, a week ago, I did two things of importance.<br />
On the Friday morning I went to the western suburbs and<br />
opened the Western Institute as a part of the new<br />
Victorian University of Technology. Victoria's new fifth<br />
university and the first ever in the western suburbs. In<br />
the afternoon I went and opened the most modern state of<br />
the art tyre factory in the world, which will have the<br />
best productivity of any tyre factory in the world.<br />
Which will be competitive with the rest of the world. it<br />
will export 25% of its production, including to Japan,<br />
into the most competitive markets. The media was there<br />
at the opening of the University and at the opening of<br />
this tyre plant and they were there at both and they also<br />
had a press conference with me. At the press conference<br />
they asked me about this bloke, Booker, and his absurd<br />
comments that I had put Australian ships under the United<br />
States command and I just pointed out that he was<br />
wrong. Now what got covered? I'll tell you what got<br />
covered. Not the exciting fact of opening a University<br />
in the western suburbs of Melbourne, not the fact that<br />
we'd opened the most modern state of the art tyre<br />
production factory in the world but the Booker story. So </p>
<p>don't give me this business about what gets reported.<br />
Two fundamentally important things a new university,<br />
opportunity for kids in the western suburbs, the most<br />
modern state of the art factory in the world, and what's<br />
covered? Booker.<br />
McMINN: I can tell you what's being covered right now at<br />
a local level and that is you can't pick up a newspaper<br />
or watch television or listen to radio without listening<br />
to John Halfpenny, the Secretary of Trades Hall<br />
PM: That's because you fellows in the media, the whole<br />
lot of you, have given John Halfpenny the floor. He was<br />
Secretary of the Trades Hall. Whenever you wanted to<br />
have a story, John Halfpenny. So I don't find it<br />
surprising when you say that all that's being covered is<br />
John Halfpenny. I mean you people build him up before he<br />
was ever heard of in the Victorian Trades Hall<br />
O secretaryship. McMINN: Well the question that's being asked in Victoria<br />
right now it leads me to my next one. The first one is<br />
who's running this State, John Halfpenny or Joan Kirner?<br />
It leads me to my next question. Can Labor win federally<br />
if it can't turn around Victoria? The latest polls<br />
indicate the Opposition's are leading the Government 56<br />
to 26.<br />
PM: Yes, it's a great Opposition too, isn't it? Are the<br />
people of Victoria in love with Alan Brown and company?<br />
McMINN: No, they're probably not but they're certainly<br />
not in love with the Labor Party.<br />
PM: Well it's all I'm saying is that the fact is that of<br />
course in Victoria the Government is unpopular. Joan<br />
acknowledges that and she acknowledges that she's got a<br />
O tough road ahead of her. But I believe that she and her<br />
Ministers will make the decisions which are necessary to<br />
turn their fortunes around and they will have our support<br />
in doing that. I mean in the end people have got to ask<br />
themselves the question, well OK it is true that mistakes<br />
have been made by the Cain Government, there's no doubt<br />
about that and as I've said John Cain has admitted it.<br />
But the fact is that now they have a Government which is<br />
committed to getting Victoria moving. They've got to ask<br />
themselves the question as to who can better do that,<br />
that Government or the mob that are in Opposition. I<br />
mean they have been a joke for the best part of a decade,<br />
the Liberals in Victoria. Have they suddenly got better?<br />
Look at the State of Victoria. Look at the State of<br />
Victoria before Labor got in. I mean they were one of<br />
the most inefficient governments in the country. They<br />
had no concept of reform either in the economic sphere or<br />
in the social sphere. I mean they embodied the principle<br />
of conservatism in this country. That is the privileged<br />
are the ones that count and the responsibility of Liberal<br />
governments is to entrench the position of those already </p>
<p>privileged. Don't worry about the kids who come from the<br />
homes of the lower/ middle income. They are not our<br />
bailiwick. The bailiwick are those who are already<br />
privileged. They embodied, they made that into an art<br />
form of government. Damn the majority of people, let's<br />
look after the privileged. Now there has never been any<br />
suggestion as far as the Victorian Labor Government is<br />
concerned of any personal venality or any of that sort of<br />
thing, not a breath of it and yet what you've had was<br />
conservative governments. There's questions about the<br />
appropriateness of behaviour of people as individuals and<br />
you had a per-petuation of privileged under those types of<br />
government. They are-<br />
McMINN: State Bank, Prime Minister.<br />
PM: I beg your pardon?<br />
McMINN: They didn't lose a State Bank.<br />
PM: Well OK, but I tell you what, they lost thousands of<br />
lives in terms of kids who should've been able to go in<br />
an education system and have their lives developed by<br />
having all their talents trained and educated. Those<br />
people who are growing up into adults will never be able<br />
to reclaim their lost lives, the opportunity that<br />
should've been given to them. When you're talking about<br />
Labor in Victoria never forget that it was a government<br />
which was committed in the area of education and social<br />
welfare to ensuring that the resources of Victoria were<br />
in fact in terms of a distribution, made available to<br />
those who should be assisted by government. True it is<br />
and I've acknowledged it and said so publicly. They've<br />
made some griLevous mistakes in economic management but in<br />
terms of theiLr concepts of who should be helped in the<br />
community in terms of trying to get a better education<br />
system, a faiLrer society, they were light years in front<br />
of the Liberals and the National Party. And they remain<br />
light years : Ln front of them.<br />
McMINN: Prime Minister, if I can just turn your, I know<br />
you're almost out of time, but just turn your attention<br />
to the Middle East right now. Some very disturbing<br />
developments.. We've got James Baker going to London<br />
after talks with the Saudi King. We've got Margaret<br />
Thatcher the other day talking about the fact that Saddam<br />
better get out of Kuwait or else. Are we heading to a<br />
war? PM: No and when I say no, no-one can say whether we're<br />
heading to a war or not. There is no-one in the world,<br />
including President Bush, I think who can say at this<br />
moment whether there's going to be war. But what we are<br />
faced with is a situation where you still have installed<br />
in Kuwait a dictator who has said to hell with all the<br />
standards of international law and convention, I am going<br />
to destroy another State, my neighbour, and acquire it<br />
and keep it. That cannot be tolerated. It's my hope, </p>
<p>it's my sincere hope, as I'm sure it is of President Bush<br />
and other leaders, that this man will respond as he<br />
should rationally to all the evidence before him. That<br />
is that the interests of the Iraqi people are at very<br />
grave risk by a continuation of his attempt to say that<br />
he can spurn international law and convention and just<br />
take another country by force. Now there is still some<br />
hope, I think, that rationality will prevail and that he<br />
should withdraw. But the world cannot tolerate a<br />
continued situation where he says that I'll acquire a<br />
neighbouring State by force. If the world allowed that,<br />
condones that, tolerates it, then international law and<br />
order ceases to exist.<br />
McMINN: But we've got from George Bush an announcement<br />
that another 100,000 troops are going to be sent to the<br />
Middle East. We've got Baker also talking to the<br />
Soviets, winning their support. I mean reading between<br />
the lines I get the feeling and you might know better<br />
than me, you probably do, but I get the feeling that<br />
basically evetryone's just closing the bases or closing<br />
the options, if you like, and they're moving towards a<br />
situation of striking?<br />
PM: Well they are wanting the sanctions to work. I mean<br />
we all want the sanctions to work. The hope is that they<br />
will. He's making, Saddam Hussein is continuing to make<br />
the statements that he will not withdraw from Kuwait,<br />
that that is done and the world has got to accept that he<br />
has swalloweed a neighbour. Now what is being said by the<br />
world and the sort of things that you are referring to<br />
reflect the fact that the world is saying we are not<br />
going to allow that in the end of the Cold War era and in<br />
this new post Cold War era where the world must show its<br />
capacity to resolve problems, he's been told that the<br />
world is not going to accept that position. And if<br />
you're not going to accept it you can't just sit idly by<br />
and say well that's what we're telling you, Mr Hussein,<br />
we're not gon', ng to accept it and not given to understand<br />
that you mean what you're saying.<br />
McMINN: One final point. I'm in the business of<br />
possibly selling my house in Sydney. Things are going<br />
quite well in Melbourne. I love working here and living<br />
here. But the market is flat as a tack so can I ask<br />
your PM: Do you want to know if I want to buy it?<br />
McMINN: When will the economy turn around?<br />
PM: I've saiLd in the Parliament and I'll repeat on your<br />
program that I believe that as we go through to the first<br />
part of 1991 that the economy will be picking up.<br />
McMINN: The first part of 1991? </p>
<p>PM: By June. By the middle of 1991 I think we'll see<br />
the pick up.<br />
McMINN: OK, I hope you're right.<br />
PM: So do I..<br />
McMINN: Prime Minister, thank you very much for your<br />
time. PM: It's a pleasure Ian.<br />
ends </p>
