COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA<br />
SPEECH BY<br />
The Rt. Hon. HAROLD HOLT, M. P.<br />
ON<br />
GOVERNMENT POLICY<br />
Ministerial Statement<br />
[ From the " Parliamentary Debates," 8th March 1966]<br />
Mr. HAROLD HOLT ( Higgins-Prime<br />
Minister).-by leave-I am taking this first<br />
opportunity after meeting the House to<br />
speak on some of the more significant<br />
matters with which we have been dealing<br />
since the Government took office. The new<br />
Government was sworn in on 26th January<br />
-Australia Day. We have been in office,<br />
therefore, just short of six weeks. They have<br />
been weeks of unusually intense activity. As<br />
I give an account of the highlights of events<br />
over that period, I shall also be mentioning<br />
some important policy decisions not previously<br />
announced. Ministers who will be<br />
speaking later in the debate on this statement,<br />
or introducing statements of their<br />
own, will provide more detail on several<br />
matters which I shall only be able to touch<br />
briefly. It is to be expected that a new Government<br />
will have a busy time in its early weeks<br />
as it takes up the reins of government. But,<br />
in addition to the tasks normally to be<br />
expected in these circumstances, we have<br />
found ourselves engaged in discussionssome<br />
of a profound and far-reaching<br />
character-in the fields of defence and<br />
foreign policy. On the domestic front, we<br />
have concluded a review of the current state<br />
of the economy. This followed discussions<br />
with official economic advisory bodies<br />
2874/ 66 assisting the Government and with representatives.<br />
of industry. We have devoted a<br />
good deal of attention to the drought situation'<br />
persisting over large areas of the<br />
Commonwealth and the . problems arising<br />
from the ramifications of the drought.<br />
Before commenting on . these matters, I<br />
would like the House to know that the<br />
Government will be. inviting it-on two<br />
occasions I shall mention-to give recognition<br />
to the distinguished -public and parliamentary<br />
services of my predecessor, Sir<br />
Robert Menzies. Sir Robert established a<br />
remarkable record of more than 18 years of<br />
leadership as Prime Minister,. more than<br />
double the previous record -length of service<br />
in this office. Tomorrow, I: shall present a<br />
resolution to the House enabling us to place<br />
on Parliamentary record our appreciation of<br />
his many years of service. On 17th<br />
March, the Government will be holding a<br />
Parliamentary dinner in honour of Sir<br />
Robert and Dame Pattie.<br />
DEFERMENT OF THE REFERENDUM<br />
PROPOSALS.<br />
I also mention the Government's decision<br />
to defer, until the next Parliament, the<br />
referendum on the two proposals to amend<br />
the Constitution which were passed by both </p>
<p>Houses of Parliament towards the end of<br />
last year. We would have preferred to let<br />
the question of deferment stand until such<br />
' time as we could have benefit of parliamentary<br />
discussion and decision concerning<br />
it. But this course was not open to us<br />
because, as matters stood, the Chief Electoral<br />
Officer would have been required<br />
under the provisions of the Act to post the<br />
arguments for and against the proposals to<br />
some 6,000,000 voters before the end of<br />
February. Therefore, in practical terms, it<br />
was necessary for us to make and announce<br />
the decision before we met the Parliament.<br />
In pursuance of this decision, we will<br />
recommend to the Governor-General in<br />
Council that he should not issue the writ<br />
provided for in section 5 of the Referendum<br />
( Constitution Alteration) Act. We remain<br />
strongly in support of both proposals. But<br />
we are a new Government and, inevitably,<br />
much occupied not only with the very many<br />
important and pressing matters arising at<br />
home and abroad, but with other matters<br />
which beset a new Government. A ref erendum<br />
campaign would be an extra and<br />
lengthy commitment. in these circumstances,<br />
and because there is no -urgency about<br />
either of the proposals becoming law this<br />
year, we believe that it would be better to<br />
defer the holding of the referendum.<br />
However, we intend, ' early in the life of<br />
the next Parliament, to introduce the necessary<br />
legislation to enable a referendum to<br />
be held on the proposal to break the nexus<br />
between the two Houses of Parliament. We<br />
will also -then give a general indication of<br />
our intentions in relation to the distribution<br />
proposals which would be made should the<br />
referendum prove successful.<br />
We intend, at the same time, to present<br />
also the proposal relating to Aborigines.<br />
This proposal has been supported by all<br />
political parties, and there was indeed no<br />
negative case prepared for circulation to<br />
the electors. Any delay in passing the referendum<br />
in relation to the counting of<br />
Aborigines will have no adverse practical<br />
result because, in fact, the Commonwealth<br />
Statistician does count the Aboriginal<br />
natives in the community and makes the<br />
figure public. The provision in the Constitution<br />
does not amount to an impediment<br />
against this counting. Nor does it prevent<br />
Aborigines voting; many of them do. We,<br />
nevertheless, believe that the provision should be taken out of the Constitution. It<br />
is outmoded and misleading, and gives<br />
unwarranted cause for criticism both inside<br />
and outside Australia by people unaware<br />
of the actual situation.<br />
As I said when announcing our decision<br />
to recommend a deferment, we are sensitive<br />
to the fact that the Parliament has<br />
supported in both Houses the referendum<br />
legislation which the Menzies Government<br />
presented. We believe, however, that members<br />
in both Houses will recognise the<br />
reasons which have influenced us, and will<br />
approve our decision to defer the proposals<br />
for the time being. The deferment is being<br />
made with a view to strengthening, rather<br />
than weakening, the prospect of success for<br />
the two proposals.<br />
I turn now to aspects of foreign affairs<br />
and defence with which we have been dealing<br />
over recent weeks. In our first month<br />
of office, we had visits from Mr. Denis<br />
Healey, the British Minister for Defence,<br />
Mr. Hubert Humphrey, Vice-President of<br />
the United States, and His Excellency Field<br />
Marshal Thanomn Kittikachorn, Prime<br />
Minister of Thailand. Each of these discussions<br />
was of importance for Australia. Each<br />
of them required considerable preparation<br />
and close consultation with our civilian and<br />
military advisers.<br />
VISIT BY, MR. HEALEY.<br />
Mr. Den is' Healey, the British Minister<br />
of Defence, visited us for four days from<br />
Monday, 31st January. The talks, although<br />
occurring within the first week of our taking<br />
office, were most timely. They were<br />
held at a -time when the United Kingdom<br />
Government was coming to major long<br />
term decisions, subsequently incorporated in<br />
the White Paper on defence recently presented<br />
to the United Kingdom Parliament.<br />
Mr. Healey had been set the task of framing<br />
a defence programme which would contain<br />
British expenditure on defence in 1970<br />
within the equivalent in that year of<br />
Å E2,000 million sterling today. This task<br />
called for some drastic adjustments. One of<br />
the possibilities coming under public<br />
discussion in Britain was a withdrawal of<br />
British forces east of Suez. Mr. Healey<br />
made it clear to us that his Government<br />
did not hold any views on these lines. But<br />
the general proposition had found support<br />
amongst -highly placed parliamentarians on </p>
<p>both sides of politics. The United Kingdom<br />
Government decided-in our view, very<br />
wisely-that it would continue to maintain<br />
a global role in world affairs and that as<br />
part of this role it would continue to maintain<br />
substantial forces in South East Asia.<br />
The Canberra talks were of tremendous<br />
value in enabling us -to make a frank<br />
exchange of views. Mr. Healey made it<br />
clear to us, in direct but friendly fashion,<br />
that if British troops had to leave Singapore,<br />
then either they would have to be accommodated<br />
in base facilities on the. Australian<br />
mainland or they would have to go home.<br />
For our part, we were willing , to plan<br />
against the contingency that Singapore<br />
might become untenable at some future<br />
point of time and have now put in hand a<br />
study, at the Service level, of various possibilities<br />
and their feasibility. However, we<br />
emphasised strongly the need for a continued<br />
British presence in South East Asia,<br />
and we affirmed that the bases in Singapore<br />
and Malaysia, in which we share and to<br />
which we have made substantial contribution,<br />
should be retained for as long as<br />
possible. The British presence on the mainland<br />
of Asia provides an essential stabilising<br />
and moderating influence, and aid to morale.<br />
British departure from the scene could have<br />
disastrous consequences. We are gratified<br />
that the United Kingdom Government has<br />
confirmed, in the White Paper, its firm<br />
intention to continue to maintain the bases<br />
in Singapore and Malaysia so long as the<br />
Governments of Singapore and Malaysia<br />
make this possible on " acceptable conditions".<br />
For Australia this is a most significant<br />
and welcome decision.<br />
Mr. Dean Eyre, the New Zealand Minister<br />
for Defence, participated in all the<br />
discussions with Mr. Healey. This Government<br />
wishes to increase its co-operation<br />
with New Zealand in defence matters and,<br />
indeed, in all other matters of mutual interest.<br />
The Anzac tradition was forged between<br />
us in another great struggle fought by<br />
the forces of freedom to resist aggression.<br />
The grim events in Vietnam and Indonesia's<br />
ill-conceived confrontation of Malaysia have<br />
brought us closely in association again. Our<br />
discussions revealed complete identity of<br />
view between our two Governments.<br />
It is worth recording that the British<br />
Government carried out its recent defence<br />
review in a way which was, we believe, unique in British history. It was probably<br />
the first time the British Government has<br />
ever tried to look so far ahead in planning<br />
its foreign and defence policy-Mr. Healey's<br />
talks with us ranged over the period from<br />
the 1970' s to the 1990' s-and it is also the<br />
first occasion on which the United Kingdom<br />
has consulted so closely with its allies before<br />
final recommendations were adopted by the<br />
Cabinet. Arising from the Canberra talks, it was<br />
agreed with the representatives of Britain<br />
and New Zealand that consultations will<br />
continue at ministerial level. We felt that<br />
there should be discussions between ourselves-<br />
that is, the three Governments-and<br />
United States representatives on our<br />
respective activities in South East Asia.<br />
These should not be confined to political<br />
and defence matters. We all are involved<br />
in military action in one area or another<br />
but we all are also participating ' n programmes<br />
of economic and social aid in the<br />
area. It would ' be of great advantage to<br />
develop the widest possible agreement on<br />
policy aspects and to see how far our<br />
activities can be co-ordinated.<br />
VISIT BY VICE-PRESIDENT<br />
HUMPHREY.<br />
It was of great advantage to us to receive<br />
a visit from Vice-President Humphrey and<br />
Governor Harriman so soon after the<br />
defence discussions with Mr. Healey. The<br />
Vice-President was with us on 18th and<br />
19thFebruary. This is only the second occasion<br />
on which a Vice-President of the United<br />
States has visited Australia. Mr. Humphrey<br />
came to us after a rapid tour embracing<br />
a number of the key countries of South<br />
East Asia. He was able to bring us a complete<br />
account of the talks between President<br />
Johnson and Prime Minister Ky of South<br />
Vietnam. We found our own assessment<br />
of the situation there, based on information<br />
reaching us from our own sources, to be<br />
very much in line with that conveyed by<br />
Vice-President Humphrey to us. In his public<br />
statements in Australia he brought out<br />
compellingly the critical and fundamental<br />
character of the struggle in South Vietnam.<br />
We had earlier told him we applauded the<br />
initiatives advanced by Prime Minister Ky<br />
and President Johnson for a vigorous programme<br />
of economic and social reform.<br />
We all recognise that there is far more to<br />
checking of the Communists by military </p>
<p>means. There is a need of reconstruction<br />
and rehabilitation. There is a need for an<br />
effective national administration pressing on<br />
with desired reforms and the improvement<br />
of standards.<br />
Most of the people of South Vietnam<br />
live in villages and hamlets. Many of these<br />
have suffered the ravages of terrorist activities<br />
for years. First, -the affected areas<br />
must be cleared of the enemy and made<br />
secure against Vietcong reinfiltration. The<br />
next phase is the establishment of effective<br />
administration so that the benefits of modern<br />
the problem of South Vietnam than the<br />
services can be brought to scattered rural<br />
communities. So many leaders have been<br />
murdered that the Government of South<br />
Vietnam has launched an extensive, but<br />
concentrated, programme of training. It<br />
aims to produce as quickly as possible successive<br />
teams of people who will return to<br />
the ravaged areas as leaders in various<br />
activities of significance to the local communities.<br />
They include people trained in the<br />
business of administration and government,<br />
and in health and rural development;' they<br />
include also teachers -and personnel trained<br />
to undertake such rehabilitation tasks as the<br />
building of homes, schools, roads and hospitals.<br />
Already hundreds of these teams are<br />
operating and the South Vietnamese<br />
Government plans to have many more<br />
available by the end ' of 1966. The<br />
Government is planning in this way for<br />
the progressive rebuilding of the social<br />
fabric of the community. Australians<br />
are assisting in this valuable work. I speak,<br />
in particular, of our surgical teams, which<br />
are providing medical help in a country<br />
which has far too few trained doctors serving<br />
the community of 14 million people.<br />
Australians -are also helping as advisers in<br />
agriculture and road building.<br />
I pay tribute, also,. Mr. Speaker, to the<br />
contributions made by. Australian forces in<br />
the'area. Since 1962, we have had military<br />
advisers with the South Vietnamese forces.<br />
These are highly trained and dedicated men,<br />
who at'great risk, and . in some cases casualty,<br />
to themselves, have stood beside their<br />
South Vietnamese counterparts in the field.<br />
Since 1964, a flight of Royal Australian<br />
Air Force Caribou aircraft ' has been used<br />
in a great variety of ways for general transport<br />
purposes, and to bring supplies quickly<br />
to meet emergency needs. Last year Australia committed the First Battalion of the<br />
Royal Australian Regiment to Vietnam,<br />
which was subsequently expanded to a<br />
battalion -group. The Battalion has to great<br />
effect and purpose been conducting operations<br />
from its base at Bien Hoa, and has<br />
earned praise and respect from our South<br />
Vietnamese and American allies. Vice-<br />
President Humphrey made particular reference<br />
during his visit here to the high<br />
value placed on the Australian contingent,<br />
both in their role as fighting men and their<br />
conduct generally amongst the Vietnamese<br />
people. The Vice-President spoke of the overall<br />
prospects in terms of what he described as<br />
" restrained optimism". The information<br />
we and the Americans have is that the tide<br />
of war is turning in our favour. Progress is<br />
being made in rescuing new areas, in clearing<br />
them of Vietcong and in preparing<br />
them for orderly civil government. The<br />
critical nature of the conflict in South Vietnam<br />
has not been fully recognised by all,<br />
and this certainly includes many members<br />
of the Opposition. We are told that we<br />
over-simplify the issue there. It is more<br />
accurate to say that our critics overcomplicate<br />
it. We still hear from some representatives<br />
of the Opposition that this is<br />
a civil war and that we have no good cause<br />
for participation. This view runs against all<br />
the information and advice reaching us.<br />
The discovery by our own forces of extensive<br />
headquarters and military facilities<br />
in close vicinity to Saigon illustrates the<br />
lorng-term planning and the years of pre-<br />
-paration with outside assistance which lie<br />
behind the* activities of. the Vietcong. This<br />
is no civil war. It is the principal present<br />
manifestation of the expansionist activities<br />
of Communist China. These activities are<br />
channelled through, and " directed from,<br />
Hanoi. All the countries in South East Asia<br />
are facing the threat of Communist China's<br />
expansion in one form or another. In Laos,<br />
for example, there is fighting between<br />
Chinese-supplied Pathet Lao-or Communist<br />
forces-:--and the forces of the Government.<br />
The Prime Minister of Thailand and<br />
the senior Ministerial colleagues who<br />
accompanied him gave us a graphic account<br />
of increasing Communist subversion, infiltration,<br />
and terrorist activities threatening<br />
that country. In India there, have been<br />
direct attacks by troops of the Communist<br />
Chinese Army across the Indian border. </p>
<p>Honorable members will see in these and<br />
other countries the manifestation, in one<br />
form or another, of externally-directed<br />
Communist aggression.<br />
VISIT BY FIELD MARSHAL THANOM<br />
We were able to discuss all these matters<br />
fully and frankly with the Prime Minister<br />
of Thailand and his distinguished Ministers<br />
in Canberra recently. We shared a common<br />
view of the situation in Vietnam and agreed<br />
about the incessant and widespread nature<br />
of Communist pressures in South East Asia.<br />
The Thai Government, let it be said, has a<br />
proud record of domestic achievement. It<br />
is a responsible Government which has committed<br />
the services and facilities of government<br />
and administration to the goals of economic<br />
and social progress in the spread'of<br />
education, health and medical facilities and<br />
social services generally. Its record of economic<br />
advance is impressive. National income<br />
has been increasing at an annual rate<br />
of seven per cent. for the past decade. Agricultural<br />
production is currently increasing<br />
annually at about 6.3 per cent. This is a<br />
country under Communist pressure. It is a<br />
country that we are glad to have as an ally<br />
and we look forward to the multiplication<br />
of our interests and associations.<br />
STRUGGLE AGAINST COMMUNISM<br />
IN SOUTH VIETNAM<br />
The war in South Vietnam has many<br />
brutal aspects. What has been far too little<br />
perceived is the systematic destruction of<br />
leaders in the villages and hamlets in which<br />
most of the population of South Vietnam<br />
lives. The Communists deliberately eliminate<br />
any elements in village communities who<br />
might hold out some hope of effectively rebuilding<br />
their community. In the last two<br />
years, more than 3,000 local officials and<br />
civilians have been murdered. The leaders<br />
include teachers, medical workers, leaders<br />
in politics and administration, and technical<br />
experts of one kind and another. We can all<br />
picture the mental anguish and physical<br />
distress caused by this systematic butchery<br />
and the dislocation it brings to the life of<br />
the community where it occurs.<br />
All this is what Communism in Asia<br />
means. It does not stand for peaceful political<br />
and economic change. In the words of<br />
a leading Communist military theoretician-<br />
General Giap of North Vietnam--" armed struggle and political struggle are very closely<br />
co-ordinated Of South Vietnam he says,<br />
armed struggle has budded forth from<br />
political struggle." Communism in Asia is<br />
the politics of brutality, the politics of disruption,<br />
the politics of the exploitation of<br />
backwardness. Its highest form is the<br />
people's war "-that is to say, the brutality<br />
and , viciousness of guerrilla warfare practised<br />
against an entire population-men, women<br />
and children alike. A study of North Vietnam's<br />
pronouncements in respect of South<br />
Vietnam reveals the complete rejection of<br />
peaceful coexistence. Its language is the language<br />
of power, of protracted struggle, of<br />
repression, and it shows no disposition to<br />
tolerate the existence of neighbouring social<br />
and political systems other than its own.<br />
Neither we, nor our allies, are in South<br />
Vietnam for territorial gain or colonial<br />
power. We are there to establish conditions<br />
, n which ordinary men and women-and<br />
there are 14 million of them in South Vietnam<br />
alone-can pursue their lives in freedom.<br />
We are there because while Communist<br />
aggression persists, the whole of South East<br />
Asia is threatened; while the Chinese Comirunist<br />
-philosophy of world domination persists,<br />
the whole free world is threatened.<br />
During the suspension of bombing in<br />
December and January, every conceivable<br />
effort was made to bring the North Vietnamese<br />
authorities to the conference table.<br />
The)' rebuffed every approach. The search<br />
for peace will go on, but a long period of<br />
fighting is the prospect which we have to<br />
face. The critical fighting in the area increasingly<br />
involves units and personnel<br />
trained in North Vietnam and directed and<br />
equipped from Hanoi and Peking. As pressure<br />
on the Viet Cong has increased, North<br />
Vietnam has sent in reinforcements of<br />
regular North Vietnamese troops on a very<br />
substantial scale, there now being nine and<br />
possibly more regiments of the North Vietnamese<br />
Army in South Vietnam. These<br />
reinforcements continued during the bombing<br />
pause, as did work on repairs and<br />
improvement to the infiltration system. Only<br />
when it is convinced that South Vietnam,<br />
the United States and other allies have the<br />
will and the cohesion to see the struggle<br />
through is the other side likely to desist. At<br />
the present time the evidence is that it wants<br />
to continue the fighting and to test our will<br />
and cohesion. </p>
<p>ADDITIONAL AUSTRALIAN FORCES<br />
FOR SOUTH VIETNAM.<br />
The Government has for some time been<br />
made aware of the desire of the Government<br />
of South Vietnam that we increase<br />
the size of the Australian force there. There<br />
has been a very large build-up in strength<br />
of the United States forces. It is evident<br />
that the allies must put forward an increased<br />
effort if military successes are to be achieved<br />
and then followed effectively by the tasks<br />
of reconstruction.<br />
Honorable members will be aware that<br />
there are at present serving in Vietnam more<br />
than 1,500 Australian Service personnel<br />
comprising the Army training team, the<br />
battalion group, and associated headquarters<br />
and Royal Australian Air Force personnel.<br />
Of these forces, the main element, namely,<br />
the infantry battalion-the First Royal Australian<br />
Regiment-is due to be, and will be,<br />
relieved on the conclusion of its tour of one<br />
year in the theatre. Its personnel, other<br />
than those who will have served a considerably<br />
shorter period, will return by air to<br />
their home station in Australia during the<br />
first two weeks in June.<br />
Measuring the availability of Australian<br />
troops in the light of our other commitments<br />
and in consultation with our allies, and at<br />
the request of the Government of South<br />
Vietnam, the Government has decided that<br />
the battalion will be replaced by a selfcontained<br />
Australian task force under Australian<br />
command embracing all personnel<br />
serving there and enlarging our contribution<br />
to a total of some 4,500 men-in effect, a<br />
trebling of the current strength of our -military<br />
forces there. The task force will contain,<br />
in addition to its headquarters, two<br />
infan-try battalions, a Special Air Services<br />
Squadron, and a substantial force of combat<br />
and logistic support units. The task<br />
force will need close helicopter support and,<br />
for this purpose, we are incorporating with<br />
it a flight of eight Royal Australian Air<br />
Force Iroquois helicopters. Provision of the<br />
flight of Caribou aircraft and of the team<br />
of 100 Army advisers will be continued.<br />
This force will make a greatly enlarged<br />
Australian contribution to the maintenance<br />
of security throughout South East Asia. It<br />
is, of course, in addition to our other force<br />
contributions in the region for the defence<br />
of Malaysia, Singapore * and Thailand. It is<br />
our judgement that this is the most militarily effective way in which we can assist the<br />
overall allied effort in South East Asia at<br />
this time.<br />
Honorable members are aware from<br />
previous statements by the Government that<br />
the obligation to discharge national service<br />
with the Army includes an obligation to<br />
serve overseas if necessary. The Australian<br />
task force which we will be sending to<br />
Vietnam in the middle of the year will<br />
contain two Army battalions, the 5th and<br />
6th Battalions, Royal Australian Regiment,<br />
each of which will contain a proportion<br />
of fully trained and integrated national<br />
servicemen as will all future substantial<br />
Australian Army units deployed overseas in<br />
any theatre. That proportion may vary to<br />
some extent from unit to unit, but it will<br />
be a continuing feature. The normal tour<br />
of duty in Vietnam of personnel in the task<br />
force will be 12 months. The Government<br />
has also decided that the national<br />
service intake will be continued at 8,400<br />
each year.<br />
I am sure that honorable members wiN,<br />
in the light of what I have already said,<br />
appreciate the necessity for the Government's<br />
decisions. They are decisions great<br />
responsibility and we have not taken them<br />
lightly. Australia cannot stand aside from<br />
the struggle to resist the aggressive thrust<br />
of Communism in Asia and to ensure conditions<br />
in which stability can be achieved.<br />
Our own national security demands this<br />
course. Do honorable members vpposite,<br />
wvho are interjecting, deny that?<br />
Mr. Calwell.-Yes. I deny it flatly.<br />
Mr. HAROLD HOLT.-If they do, let<br />
them stand and be counted when the time<br />
comes. We cannot be isolationist or neutralist,<br />
placed as we are geographically and<br />
occupying, as we do, with limited national<br />
strength, this vast continent. We cannot<br />
leave it solely to our allies-and their<br />
national servicemen-to defend in the<br />
region -the rights of countries to their<br />
independence and the peaceful pursuit of<br />
their national way of life.<br />
I am confident that a majority of this<br />
Parliament and of this country will warmly<br />
support this increase in the Australian contribution.<br />
It has been heartening to the<br />
Government to have had, from the outset,<br />
the unanimous support of members of -the<br />
Government parties for Australian participation<br />
in resisting Communism in South </p>
<p>Vietnam. The overwhelming support given<br />
by the Congress of ' the United States of<br />
America in recent days to -the amounts<br />
sought by the President for the conduct of<br />
military and aid operations is encouraging<br />
testimony of the strength of purpose of the<br />
American people. The free world has cause<br />
to be grateful for -the clear sighted view<br />
President Johnson has held at all times of<br />
the menace and fundamental character of<br />
the challenge to freedom in South Vietnam,<br />
and we have admired the resolution with<br />
which he has met that challenge.<br />
DEFENCE SUPPLIES<br />
One matter which has had and is still<br />
having our attention at ministerial level is<br />
the matter of supply of goods and material<br />
of various kinds by Australian industry to<br />
the American forces in South Vietnam.<br />
Late last year, the present Minister for<br />
Defence ( Mr. Fairhall), when Minister for<br />
Supply, outlined personally, to the United<br />
States Secretary of Defense Australia's<br />
capacity to provide a wide range of military<br />
supplies. The Minister's talk has been<br />
followed up actively at the official level<br />
and, as one result, agreement has now been<br />
reached on the sale of a substantial quantity<br />
of Australian small arms ammunition to the<br />
American forces. We have also been asked<br />
to quote for a number of other important<br />
items most of which are needed in large<br />
quantities. We are now working on these<br />
requests. I might add that we took the<br />
opportunity to put this whole matter in the<br />
mind of Mr. Humphrey on his recent visit.<br />
We believe that Australia can, with<br />
advantage to the allied effort, to the<br />
strengthening of our own capacity and to<br />
the advantage of our own nation play an<br />
increasing part in this matter of supply.<br />
VIETNAM MEDAL.<br />
From our recognition of the fundamental<br />
significance of the struggle against<br />
Communist aggression in South Vietnam,<br />
and the special nature of the service which<br />
our armed forces are giving there, the Government<br />
has felt it appropriate that a<br />
special award should be made to Australian.<br />
and, if the New Zealand Government<br />
agreed, to New Zealand servicemen posted<br />
to South Vietnam. I conveyed our view on<br />
this to the Prime Minister of New Zealand,<br />
the Right Honorable Keith Holyoake. As I have already mentioned, New Zealand<br />
takes precisely the same view of the issue<br />
in South Vietnam as we do. I am glad to<br />
say that Mr. Holyoake fully and immediately<br />
welcomed the proposal, and we are<br />
jointly recommending to Her Majesty that<br />
a special medal for service in Vietnam be<br />
struck. Her Majesty has told us that she<br />
will be pleased to make this award. The<br />
detailed conditions of eligibility are being<br />
worked out, and will be announced following<br />
Her Majesty's approval of them.<br />
This new special* medal for service in<br />
Vietnam will replace the General Service<br />
Medal 1962 with clasp " South Vietnam",<br />
which has hitherto been available for Australian<br />
servicemen in the area. The new<br />
medal will apply to Australian servicemen<br />
who have been in South Vietnam at any<br />
time since 29th May 1964, which is the<br />
date when the role of the Australian Army<br />
training team in Vietnam was extended to<br />
permit its employment in the field with<br />
South Vietnamese Army units in contact<br />
with the Vietcong.<br />
The Prime Minister of New Zealand and<br />
I have seen the issuance of a special medal<br />
as another welcome link in the chain of the<br />
Anzac tradition. I am sure the medal will<br />
be worn with pride by all who participate<br />
in the South Vietnam campaign and it will<br />
carry with it to the wearer an expression<br />
of the gratitude of our two countries for<br />
service in the highest order of duty.<br />
VISIT TO VIETNAM.<br />
I am hopeful it will prove possible for me<br />
to make a visit within the next few months<br />
to South Vietnam and some of the other<br />
centres in South East Asia where Australian<br />
troops are on active service. My colleague,<br />
the Minister for External Affairs ( Mr.<br />
Hasluck), was in the area as recently as last<br />
December, and I propose to arrange for<br />
other visits by appropriate Ministers so as<br />
to keep the Government in close and<br />
frequent contact with developments in this<br />
and other centres where our servicemen are<br />
engaged. Mr. Reynolds.-What about opportunities<br />
for Opposition members as well?<br />
Mr. HAROLD HOLT.-I would be glad<br />
to consider that proposition if it were put to<br />
me seriously by the Leader of the Opposition<br />
( Mr. Calwell). </p>
<p>OVERSEAS AID.<br />
Australia has an expanding role to play in<br />
South East Asia and, indeed, in the world<br />
at large consistent with its -growth in<br />
economic strength and the development of<br />
its natural * resources. The growing influx of<br />
immigration, investment capital and official<br />
visitors, the substantial increase in<br />
tourism, all signify * an increasing world<br />
interest in Australia and its growing stature.<br />
Growing responsibilities carry with them<br />
enlarged obligations. Our three-year defence<br />
programme now in its first year of duration<br />
is one measure of our -response to our<br />
obligations. In the four years between 1962<br />
and 1966, the defence vote has doubled,<br />
from approximately $ 400 million to $ 800<br />
million. Large forward commitments have<br />
been undertaken for new and improved<br />
equipment, for which substantial payments<br />
must be made as the Services arm themselves<br />
to meet the defence requirements of<br />
-the future. But even a rapidly growing bill<br />
for defence expenditure is not the only way<br />
in which Australia's general external policy<br />
should -find material expression.<br />
* Aid appropriations from our Budget<br />
totalled $ 114 milion this year. This is more<br />
than nine times the amount given in the<br />
year before we took office. This is practical<br />
recognition of the needs of other countries<br />
for our assistance. T'he Territory of Papua<br />
and New Guinea, for which we have<br />
special responsibilities, remains -the major<br />
recipient of our aid. Indeed, this is a commitment<br />
which Australia has been carrying<br />
alone. Australia played a pioneering role<br />
-in the evolution of ' the Colombo Plan.<br />
Through this instrument we channel the<br />
largest component of Australian aid to<br />
Commonwealth and foreign countries, the<br />
amount this year being $ 12 million.<br />
Although we are a capital importing<br />
country our programmes of aid for overseas<br />
compare well in scale with those of<br />
other major donors of aid. We are currently<br />
spending about 0.6 per cent, of our gross<br />
national product on external aid. There are<br />
few donor countries which can match this<br />
record. We have joined . the Asian Development<br />
Bank, on the basis of an Australian<br />
subscription of $ US85 million. This is a<br />
substantial contribution quite disproportionate<br />
to our population and national<br />
wealth, even when compared with the subscrip<br />
tions of major donors such as the United States and Japan. Our contribution<br />
reflects our willingness to play a significant<br />
part in promoting greater prosperity and<br />
security throughout the South East Asian<br />
area and our hope that this new instrument<br />
will play an increasingly significant part<br />
in that process.<br />
We recently offered a'id to India to a<br />
value of $ 8 million, principally in the form<br />
of food, as a contribution : towards meeting<br />
the critical shortages occurring there.<br />
We believe that much remains to be done<br />
by -the international community to alleviate<br />
hunger problems of this kind, and we are<br />
doing what we can -to stimulate a willingness<br />
on the part of industrialised as well<br />
-as other food producing countries to join<br />
in ' helping the less ' favoured and less<br />
developed countries of the world. Our<br />
capacity to increase expenditure on defence<br />
and foreign aid will depened on -the success<br />
of our efforts to ensure ' that our own<br />
economy is soundly based and continues to<br />
develop rapidly in stable conditions.<br />
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS.<br />
I now turn to our latest survey of the<br />
economy. This Government retains the<br />
same broad economic objectives which,<br />
successfully pursued by Governments led by<br />
Sir Robert Menzies, resulted in the greatest<br />
era of economic development in Australia's<br />
history. Our slogan of " growth wvith<br />
stability will continue to guide us. We shall<br />
aim at the highest practicable level of<br />
national development and growth of industry.<br />
A policy of full employment has<br />
been successfully conducted with remarkably<br />
little -fluctuation throughout our years<br />
of office. It remains in the forefront of<br />
economic policy. Our national growth has<br />
been associated with a programme of immigration<br />
on the large scale. This will be<br />
continued at the highest level we find it<br />
practicable to sustain. The inflow of people<br />
has been accompanied by an inflow of<br />
capital responding to a climate favorable<br />
to enterprise, skill and initiative.<br />
Mr. Pollard.-Put a bit of ginger into it.<br />
Mr. HAROLD HOLT.-That was the<br />
honorable member's urging to me after the<br />
last Budget. He had better get another<br />
slogan to break the monotony.<br />
Mr. Pollard.-Give Holt a jolt. </p>
<p>Mr. HAROLD HOLT.-Well, a jolt is<br />
better than a removal job. Judged on the<br />
latest statistics of the volume of capital and<br />
the stream of official visitors coming here<br />
from various parts of the world to study<br />
investment prospects, Australia can look<br />
forward confidently to this inflow continuing<br />
strongly. Its extent is the more remarkable<br />
because the Governments in the two<br />
principal source countries from which this<br />
investment comes-the United Kingdom<br />
and the United States of America-have<br />
both imposed some restraints on external<br />
investment. The combination of favorable<br />
growth prospects and stable economic and<br />
political conditions are proving strongly<br />
attractive. Australia finds 90 per cent. of<br />
its capital investment from its own savings,<br />
but our rate of growth has been greatly<br />
assisted by the savings of others who bring<br />
new industry, new techniques, new equipment<br />
and new skills to us.<br />
Within the past fortnight, we have had<br />
discussions with representatives of industry<br />
and commerce and finance. These have been<br />
followed by discussions in the Cabinet. It<br />
is clear that the measures adopted in last<br />
year's Budget succeeded in bringing about<br />
a better balance between supply and demand<br />
in the economy. There are, I know,<br />
apprehensions about some weaknesses in the<br />
economy which, if they were to spread and<br />
combine, could create an undue slackening<br />
of demand and unemployment. The Government<br />
certainly does not want this to happen<br />
and will take any steps necessary to prevent<br />
it happening. The general trend of demand<br />
must be kept rising sufficiently to preserve<br />
full employment and provide jobs for the<br />
additional labour coming forward locally<br />
and from the rising migrant inflow. From<br />
the preliminary information available to us<br />
there was a sharp fall in registrants for<br />
employment during February.<br />
A substantial additional amount of<br />
finance, estimated at $ 24 million, is being<br />
provided by the savings banks for housing<br />
in the second half of 1965-66. The effect<br />
of this has yet to show up fully. We have<br />
under consideration other measures to give<br />
further support to housing. The same<br />
approach applies to other sectors-subject<br />
always ' to the consideration that we must<br />
be guided first and foremost by the trend<br />
in the general level of demand and activity<br />
and the need to ensure that resources are available for the priority requirements of<br />
defence and for developments of a kind that<br />
will increase exports: It is for this latter<br />
reason that we have been especially concerned<br />
with the problems created by the<br />
drought and the still wider problem of<br />
finance for rural industries.<br />
The drought in New South Wales and<br />
Queensland has been a great misfortune in<br />
many ways. Most of all, it has been a misfortune<br />
for -the producers in the drought<br />
areas. They have suffered heavy losses and<br />
a great deal of personal hardship. Our<br />
sympathy goes to them as we join our hope<br />
to theirs for early relief. The drought has<br />
been a misfortune-for the industries which<br />
serve the rural producers, such as the<br />
makers of agricultural machinery. It has<br />
been a misfortune for the economy because<br />
it has brought a heavy cut in rural output.<br />
We have felt the effects in exports for this<br />
financial year and we will possibly feel it<br />
still more heavily in exports for 1966-67.<br />
The Commonwealth Government and its<br />
agencies have, from the start, viewed the<br />
drought as a nationalproblem. The first<br />
requirement is that of assistance while the<br />
drought is still on. The provision of finance<br />
for this purpose rests largely with the trading<br />
banks and, from all the information I<br />
have, they have done an excellent job. They<br />
have been assisted in this by the Reserve<br />
Bank which has seen to it that there was<br />
no policy restraint on their ability to lend<br />
for the purpose and that they had the liquid<br />
resources to support their customers all<br />
through the drought areas. The Commonwealth<br />
Government has backed the State<br />
Governments with finance in all the relief<br />
measures they have found necessary. It has<br />
done this by grants and advances to enable<br />
the State Budgets to carry the costs of<br />
drought relief and to make loans to drought<br />
affected producers on easy terms. In fact<br />
it has assisted the States on a quite unprecedented<br />
scale to carry out drought relief<br />
measures. Unfortunately, the drought has not<br />
passed even in Queensland, where there<br />
have been rains, and in New South Wales<br />
it is worsening. The Commonwealth will<br />
continue to assist the States to finance their<br />
drought relief measures as far as necessary<br />
and for as long as necessary. Where rains<br />
have fallen, and the restocking of properties<br />
has become possible, a need for restocking </p>
<p>finance has arisen and is expected to grow<br />
as and when the drought is relieved. Here<br />
again, ' the provision of finance will largely<br />
be a matter for the trading banks. The<br />
Reserve Bank will support them in this to<br />
the full extent. The Commonwealth<br />
Development Bank has also been lending<br />
for the purpose and the Government will<br />
ensure that it has the resources to continue<br />
doing so.<br />
There will, however, be producers who,<br />
for one reason or another, cannot get<br />
adequate bank finance for restocking. The<br />
Premier of New South Wales has written<br />
to me about this. He has proposed that<br />
the system of loans the State is making to<br />
producers for relief purposes should be<br />
extended, with necessary adaptation, for restocking<br />
purposes. Under this system, loans<br />
are made up to certain limits at low rates<br />
of interest and with provision for a deferred<br />
repayment period. I have advised the<br />
Premier of New South Wales and also the<br />
Premier of Queensland that the Commonwealth<br />
is prepared, for this purpose, to<br />
extend the support it has been giving to the<br />
State for other drought measures. Obviously,<br />
it is only sensible and very much in the<br />
national interest that, so far as finance is<br />
necessary and can help to keep down<br />
drought losses and get farms and stations<br />
back into full production as the drought<br />
lifts, it should be made available. The need<br />
to sustain and increase rural production for<br />
domestic requirements and for exports is<br />
as important -today as it has ever been in<br />
our history.<br />
The drought itself has demonstrated a<br />
need for more investment in rural industries<br />
to strengthen them in various ways<br />
against a recurrence of drought from which<br />
we have had the good fortune to be relatively<br />
free over a long period. This need<br />
for drought mitigation work merges into a<br />
wider need for increased capital investment<br />
in the rural industries. On the one hand, we<br />
will need more and more rural output to<br />
provide exports. On the other hand, the<br />
scope exists for progressively increasing<br />
rural output in a variety of ways, all of<br />
which require increased capital expenditure<br />
on farms.<br />
We have had a great many opinions as<br />
to where the main need lies and, while they<br />
vary in detail and emphasis, they all converge<br />
in a requirement for improved facilities to provide longer term rural<br />
development finance on a term loan basis.<br />
We are convinced, however, that the need<br />
is not so much for any radical innovations<br />
or new machinery as for improvement and<br />
extension of facilities which have already<br />
proved their worth.<br />
The Commonwealth Development Bank,<br />
established in 1960, has already made a<br />
valuable contribution towards meeting the<br />
needs for development finance by rural and<br />
other industries. However, we believe that<br />
the special problems of the farmer would<br />
be better served if there were facilities<br />
exclusively devoted to his credit needs.<br />
Accordingly, the Government has under<br />
consideration -the establishment of a<br />
separate Rural Division within the Commonwealth<br />
Development Bank. Legislation<br />
will be required for this.<br />
The Government believes it is desirable<br />
to provide the farmer with greater access<br />
to medium and long term capital for<br />
development purposes -through his own<br />
private bank. The term loan funds, introduced<br />
in 1962, already go some way<br />
towards meeting this purpose. The Government<br />
now proposes to consult with the<br />
trading banks with a view to establishing<br />
farm loan funds separate from the existing<br />
term loan arrangement. The funds would<br />
provide finance for medium and long<br />
term development purposes including the<br />
purchase of land and measures ' for drought<br />
recovery and mitigation of future droughts.<br />
Subject to suitable arrangements being<br />
made with the banks, it is envisaged that<br />
a sum of $ 50 million will be available for<br />
these farm loan funds. This will be in<br />
addition to the arrangements now being<br />
made by the Reserve Bank to increase<br />
existing term loan funds by $ 20 million.<br />
So, from -those two 6ources a total of<br />
$ 70 million, most of which will be for rural<br />
purposes, will be available.<br />
Mr. Calwell.-At what rate of interest?<br />
Mr. HAROLD HOLT.-As the honorable<br />
gentleman knows, there has always<br />
been a preferred rate of interest for rural<br />
borrowers. It is contemplated that overdraft<br />
lending to farmers will continue as before.<br />
In addition, the trading banks will, we hope,<br />
be lending from the new funds on a long<br />
term basis on reasonable terms and conditions.<br />
I hope to be able to make arrangements<br />
for the Treasurer ( Mr. McMahon) </p>
<p>and myself to discuss these matters with the<br />
Reserve Bank and the trading banks in the<br />
near future.<br />
The Government is exploring an insurance<br />
scheme to cover loans made from<br />
the farm loan funds of the banks. This will<br />
be done in order to ensure that this kind<br />
of lending is not unduly restricted by<br />
security considerations where projects otherwise<br />
offer excellent prospects of success.<br />
From the national standpoint, action in this<br />
area is directed initially to the building up<br />
of our export capabilities, which are one<br />
of the great key requisites for ensuring<br />
continued growth. As such, it is to be seen<br />
as part of a many sided programme<br />
embracing not only assistance, direct and<br />
indirect, to exporting industries, but all that<br />
goes to the discovery and development of<br />
resources, such as mineral exploration, oil<br />
search, water conservation, road, ail and<br />
port improvements, scientific research and<br />
extension services, in fact, most of the main<br />
branches of developmental work.<br />
One of the most encouraging facts about<br />
exports in recent years has been their increasing<br />
deversification. Rural exports still<br />
predominate, and will do so for many a<br />
day to come. But they are being increasingly<br />
and most opportunely supplemented by<br />
exports of minerals and of manufactures.<br />
One of the main topics discussed with<br />
industry representatives last week was that<br />
of export incentives for manufactures. It<br />
was the unanimous view that the scheme<br />
introduced in 1962 had yielded excellent<br />
results. The Export Development Council<br />
told us that it was making a general review<br />
of the subject, on which it would be reporting<br />
to us. It asked that certain features of<br />
the existing scheme which had come to<br />
be regarded as anomalous should be removed,<br />
and we have undertaken to consider<br />
this. It strongly recommended that<br />
the Government should give an assurance<br />
that export incentives will be continued after<br />
the present legislation expires next year. It<br />
is certainly the general intention of the<br />
Government that this should be done.<br />
Industry representatives also urged upon us<br />
most strongly the need for encouraging the<br />
pursuit of research and development in<br />
manufacturing industry. The Government<br />
has been impressed by these views and is<br />
considering various proposals for assistance<br />
to industry in this field. NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT.<br />
Our approach to development generally,<br />
and northern development in particular, will<br />
continue to be-both vigorous and comprehensive.<br />
Achievements to'. date have been<br />
very much more impressive than published<br />
criticisms would suggest.. When account is<br />
taken -of current and proposed work, the<br />
total of public and private investmcnt for<br />
northern Australia is in the vicinity of<br />
$ 2,000 million. The Government will maintain<br />
close co-operation with State Governments<br />
for development purposes. The<br />
planning and construction of public developmental<br />
projects are primarily matters foi<br />
State Governments. The Commonwealth<br />
Government has assisted the States to undertake<br />
a variety of projects by means ot<br />
special grants and loans. We recognise, howeverl,'<br />
that while our activities can sometimes<br />
trigger off worthwhile developments, or act<br />
in aid of the development undertakings of<br />
others, the major contribution will be made<br />
by private enterprise and the initiative of<br />
private investors.<br />
A recent example of co-operation between<br />
the Commonwealth and the States towards<br />
development was the announcement by the<br />
Minister for National Development ( Mr.<br />
Fairbairn) on 24th February that the Commonwealth<br />
and Sta te Governments have<br />
agreed that Australia should increase its rate<br />
of softwood planting from the present<br />
40,000 acres a year to 75,000 acres for the<br />
next 35 years. The programme recommended<br />
will meet Australia's most urgent<br />
needs in the foreseeable future. Imports of<br />
' timber and other forestry products now cost<br />
Australia more than $ 200 million a year.<br />
This cost could treble by the end of the<br />
century if we fail to increase our planting<br />
rate. The Commonwealth Government has<br />
offered the States about $ 20 million in longterm<br />
loans over the next five years to help<br />
lift the planting rate in the Government<br />
softwood plantations. These loans will be<br />
interest -free for the first 10 years.<br />
Commonwealth-State co-operation led to<br />
the formation some four years ago of the<br />
Australian Water Resources Council. Thanks<br />
principally to the provision of Commonwealth<br />
funds of about $ 5.5 million, expenditure<br />
on the investigation of water resources<br />
will increase by 60 per cent. in the three </p>
<p>years to 1966-67. A further expansion of<br />
this work in the succeeding three years is<br />
being discussed . by . Commonwealth and<br />
State officers in Canberra this week.<br />
Examples of -this' co-operation are too<br />
numerous for. me to list them all here, but<br />
I mention the agreement entered into<br />
between the Commonwealth and Queensland<br />
Governments in 1962 to develop<br />
4+ million acres of land for beef production<br />
in the brigalow belt of central Queensland,<br />
with the Commonwealth providing $ 14.5<br />
million to finance -the scheme. Despite<br />
severe drought conditions in 1964 and 1965,<br />
go Iod progress has * been made in development<br />
of the area and, : as recently as last<br />
Friday, I talked' in ' Canberra with the<br />
Premier of Queensland about a similar<br />
scheme for a further area of nearly six million<br />
acres in central Queensland.<br />
Expansion in the mining industry has<br />
been the most spectacular development in<br />
the north in the post-war period. New industries<br />
-have been established at a number<br />
of places-bauxite development at Weipa<br />
and Gove, manganese at -Groote Eylandt,<br />
iron ore on the northwest of Western Australia,<br />
and at two centres in the No rthern<br />
Territory, and coal at two centres in<br />
central Queensland. In addition, considerable<br />
expansion has taken place at Mount<br />
Isa, involving private investment of some<br />
$ 130 million. In this case, the Government<br />
has made this development feasible by providing<br />
$ 34.5 million towards the cost of<br />
reconstruction of the railway to Townsville.<br />
In the case of the bauxite deposits<br />
at Gove in the Northern Territory, the Government<br />
has negotiated arrangements for<br />
development of the field by a company<br />
with 50 per cent. Australian equity and<br />
with conditions requiring establishment of<br />
a plant on the site to process bauxite into<br />
alumina. The -Commonwealth Government<br />
through its financial assistance in connection<br />
with the beef cattle roads has made an<br />
enormous contribution to the development<br />
of better road transport facilities throughout<br />
Northern Australia leading to a larger<br />
turn-off of cattle. Drought effects were alleviated<br />
by movement over these roads to<br />
better pastures. Since 1961-62, approval has<br />
been given for assistance totalling $ 41.5<br />
million towards the construction and upgrading of roads for cattle transport in<br />
Queensland, Western Australia and the<br />
Northern Territory.<br />
. The sugar i * ndustry which supports the<br />
bulk of the -population in the north of<br />
Queensland has gone through a phase of<br />
expansion since 1950 with acreage and<br />
output both . increasing by approximately<br />
100 per cent. This expansion has been made<br />
possible by the successful negotiations of<br />
the Government which have enabled it to<br />
establish markets at home and abroad to<br />
absorb the increased output. Development<br />
of the industry over the past 15 years has<br />
led to substantial growth of cities and<br />
towns on the north Queensland coast and<br />
to developm * ent and modernisation of harbour<br />
and transport facilities.<br />
DECIMAL CURRENCY.<br />
The changeover to the new decimal currency<br />
system for which work and planning<br />
have proceeded over several years went<br />
remarkably smoothly. The fact that it did so<br />
reflects great credit on the many people<br />
in all walks of life who played an active<br />
part in one aspect or another of the planning<br />
for this highly complex operation.<br />
Naturally, there were some uncertainties,<br />
and even an element of confusion, as was<br />
to be expected, in a few areas during the<br />
early stages, but, by and large, the general<br />
public has ' rapidly become familiar with<br />
the new coins and notes.<br />
The United Kingdom bad a team of<br />
offici , al observers in Australia at the time<br />
of the changeover. Presumably these must<br />
have reported favorably, because shortly<br />
afterwards the United Kingdom Government<br />
announced its own firm decision to<br />
change to a decimal system in 1971. New<br />
Zealand will be moving into decimals in<br />
July of next year, and several other smaller<br />
countries will also be following suit over<br />
the next year or two. There will be very<br />
few, if any, countries remaining outside the<br />
decimal family by the time of the British<br />
changeover. Australia thus will have become<br />
part of a world-wide decimal currency<br />
community. IMMIGRATION.<br />
The Government has been making a<br />
review of the restrictive aspects of our immigration<br />
policy. Australia's increasing involvement<br />
in Asian developments, the rapid </p>
<p>growth of our trade with Asian countries,<br />
our participation on a larger scale in an<br />
increasing number of aid projects in the<br />
area, the considerable number of Asian<br />
students-now well over 12,000-receiving<br />
education in Australia, the expansion of<br />
our military effort, and the scale of diplomatic<br />
contact, the growth of tourism to<br />
and from the countries of Asia, combine to<br />
make such a review desirable in our eyes.<br />
It is, at the same time, important that<br />
there should be a clearer understanding in<br />
Asia of our policy, and the reasons for it.<br />
It is certainly not based on any false notion<br />
of superiority. We are fully aware that many<br />
of the peoples of Asia can point to cultures<br />
dating back centuries before those of<br />
Western Europe. But, in these modern times,<br />
every country reserves to itself the right to<br />
decide what the composition of its population<br />
shall be; it has regard to the preservation<br />
of standards and of national characteristics<br />
and to the maintenance of the essential<br />
homogeneity of its people. Australia derives<br />
strength from its unity and a community<br />
life free from serious minority and racial<br />
problems. All countries in South East Asia<br />
maintain restrictions against immigration to<br />
serve their own national policies. Our basic<br />
policy has been firmly established since the<br />
beginning of our Federation. It is widely<br />
supported. But it has been the wish of the<br />
Government, as it would be of the community<br />
at large, that the policy should be<br />
administered with a spirit of humanity and<br />
with good sense.<br />
Following our most recent review, the<br />
Government has decided on some modification<br />
and a degree of liberalisation. Under<br />
current policy, a non-European admitted on<br />
a long-term entry permit, must complete 15<br />
years in Australia before applying for resident<br />
status and Australian citizenship. We<br />
have decided that, in future, application can<br />
be made in these cases after five years, the<br />
same period as applies for naturalisation<br />
application by settlers from Europe. There<br />
are other changes which, while maintaining<br />
the basic principles of our policy, can be<br />
made with advantage to enable more<br />
flexibility in administration. The Minister for<br />
Immigration ( Mr. Opperman) will shortly<br />
indicate to the House the Government's<br />
conclusions in more detail. LEGISLATION PROGRAMME.<br />
Honorable members will realise, from<br />
what I have been saying, that the Government<br />
has been, and will be, active on many<br />
fronts. Legislation will be needed to put<br />
into effect some of the matters I have mentioned<br />
to-night, and, of course, there will<br />
be numerous other items not covered in<br />
this statement, encompassing as it does the<br />
broad field rather than the detail.<br />
The legislation being prepared will cover<br />
a wide and important range of subjects.<br />
Some of them are complex measures which<br />
will require much drafting and consultation,<br />
such as the shipping provisions for the trade<br />
practices legislation, and measures relating<br />
to copyright and off-shore petroleum. In<br />
relation to off-shore petroleum we have had<br />
a remarkable instance of effective Commonwealth<br />
and State co-operation in the<br />
arrangements reached after the discussions<br />
which have occurred. There is also the comprehensive<br />
review of the defence legislation.<br />
Other subjects will reflect our immediate<br />
preoccupations at home and abroad, such<br />
as the legislation seeking approval of our<br />
decision to join the Asian Development<br />
Bank, and legislation in regard to drought<br />
relief. I am sure that all honorable members<br />
will welcome our proposal to give full<br />
voting rights to the member for the Australian<br />
Capital Territory. This is a matter<br />
which I shall leave until tomorrow, when<br />
my colleague, the Minister for the Interior<br />
( Mr. Anthony), will be making a statement<br />
on it. CONCLUSION.<br />
My fellow Australians will find reflected<br />
in what I have said tonight the change of<br />
orientation which marks Australia's situation<br />
in this second half of the 20th century.<br />
We find ourselves playing an active and not<br />
uninfluential part, in the world community,<br />
but we have become increasingly involved<br />
in the affairs of Asia. We have found our<br />
external responsibilities increasing as we<br />
have increased our population and economic<br />
strength. Others expect us to play an increasing<br />
part in military assistance, in international<br />
aid and in diplomatic discussion.<br />
We are all conscious of a heightened<br />
influence on our community life from a<br />
quickening spirit of nationalism. We see<br />
dangers ahead, but they seem to occupy far<br />
less of the horizon than happier vistas of<br />
national growth. We have the good fortune </p>
<p>to live together in a true democracy. We<br />
breathe the air of freedom. We do not<br />
always succeed in doing so, but we have<br />
learned to co-operate effectively at all levels<br />
of Government, and in the relations between<br />
Government and industry. We are confident<br />
that our greatest years have yet to be.<br />
Mr. Whitlam.-Hal<br />
Mr. HAROLD HOLT.-I appreciate the<br />
chagrin of the honorable gentleman opposite.<br />
I hope that he and his colleagues will<br />
be able to eradicate the repression under<br />
which they suffer. It is a privilege for all members of this<br />
Government to have the opportunity,<br />
through their Ministries, to make a contribution<br />
towards Australia's progress. We<br />
commit ourselves to the tasks ahead with<br />
enthusiasm, with our hard work and our<br />
devotion. I present the following paper-<br />
Statement of Policy by New Government-<br />
Ministerial Statement 8th March 1966--<br />
and move-<br />
SThat the House take note of the paper.<br />
BY AUTHORITY: A. J. ARTHUR, COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT PRINTER, CANBERRA </p>
