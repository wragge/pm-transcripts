PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING, MPD<br />
DOORSTOP, PARLIAMENT HOUSE<br />
9 NOVEMBER 1993<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
PM: Last night [ an McLachlan, the Liberal front bencher, was brazenly<br />
defying the High Court and endorsing the general thrust of the<br />
fanatical views put by Professor Blainey wh~ o said that the Chief<br />
Justice had failed in his duties and should seriously consider making<br />
way for another Chief Justice. In other words, here's the Party that has<br />
always believed in the rule of law, and the sanctity of private property,<br />
saying the High Court only works when it works for us, and when. it<br />
doesn't work for us the High Court Judge, Chief Justice, should either<br />
explain himself or resign his position.<br />
Ian McLachlan then endorsed that general thrust of those views. Now,<br />
I think, that it is imperative that Dr Hewson dissociate himself from Ian<br />
McLachlan's endorsement of Professor Blainey's fanatical right wing<br />
views about the High Court to dissociate himself from those remarks,<br />
and Mr McLachlan's remarks that he endorses the start of a process of<br />
reversal of the Native Title decision. And to not do so would leave Dr<br />
Hewson accused of the same arrogant refusal to accept a decision of<br />
the High Court, which even Mr Hugh Morgan describes as the<br />
keystone of the Constitutional arch.<br />
So, here is a High Court decision very much along the lines of similar<br />
Supreme Courts in other countries. One that it is a sound legal<br />
decision, and now where a front bencher of the Opposition says the<br />
Chief Justice should resign.<br />
Now, last week Alexander Downer was the only Liberal that came out<br />
and said that Mr McLachlan was out of court, he was out of line and he<br />
should be corrected and put back into line or stand down from the front<br />
bench and that Dr Hewson should ensure that he does. Dr Hewson<br />
has done no such thing, his weakness in relation to the High Court and<br />
Mabo, that is, a Liberal Party leader considering and tolerating such an<br />
attack upon the High Court for this decision simply means, I think, that </p>
<p>Dr Hewson -now has no strength in dealing with the High Court, he is<br />
showing no leadership whatsoever in his Party, and that was again<br />
endorsed this morning by his make up with Senator Bishop. Senator<br />
Bishop has been campaigning for his job. A Week ago he was kissing<br />
her on the cheek in a slilly make-up, and today, apparently in another<br />
display of a total lack of leadership and weakness, he is saying it is ok,<br />
Bronwyn, if you are quiet it will be all right with me. The fact is John<br />
Hewson should try and stop Senator Bishop where she wants to start,<br />
in the pre-selection for the seat of Mackellar, he is not doing that. He<br />
is going to let her through and now let her slide onto the front bench<br />
providing they all kiss and make up.<br />
Well, I just say to you, Dr Hewson is a weak leader. I told you last<br />
weekend that I think his days as leader are finished, and to tolerate the<br />
brazen contempt by Mr McLachlan for the High Court in endorsing the<br />
fanatical views of Professor Blainey just makes that abundantly clear.<br />
J-How long do you give Dr Hewson in the job?<br />
PM. Not long. I think now, any Liberal who would have seen his interview<br />
with Laurie Oakes on the Sunday Program last weekend would simply<br />
despair about the state of the Opposition leadership.<br />
J: Prime Minister, didn't you earlier in the year also invite criticism of the<br />
High Court for leaving a lot of the questions unanswered on Mabo?<br />
PM: No, there is one thing about'the tidiness of the judgement, that is,<br />
whether or not some of these questions about leases etc should have<br />
been referred to, that is, leaving so much of it to the Parliament. It is<br />
another thing to say that the whole decision is illegitimate and the<br />
Hight Court and the Chief Justice should stand down. It is an absolute<br />
outrage. They were always invoking Menzies, I mean, Menzies would<br />
turn over in his grave on this sort of an attack on the High Court.<br />
These are people that believe in the rule of law. The West Australian<br />
Government is contemplating the most far reaching obliteration of<br />
private property rights in the country's history. They want to. take<br />
Native Title and extinguish it.<br />
J. Prime Minister, do you think Mr Blainey is a racist?<br />
PM; We know of his notorious positions on these things, you can put him in<br />
the Hugh Morgan category. The problem here is McLachlan,<br />
McLachlan is a front bencher in the Opposition. He is endorsing<br />
Blainey's views that the Chief Justice should stand down, that * the<br />
Justices should explain themselves or stand down. And the leader of<br />
the Opposition is letting that position remain, and letting those remarks<br />
stand without disciplining Mr McLachlan. </p>
<p>J: Does Professor Blainey have a point when he says that Aborigines<br />
have too much land and that anyone who criticises that is being<br />
labelled a racist?<br />
PM:* Well, in 1788 they had all the land didn't they. What are they to get<br />
now? Not that in the coastal periphery of the country, but only in the<br />
main, in the hinterland and only where they can establish native title on<br />
a customary basis. In the end, these people don't want to see land<br />
conferred on people, they want to see land conferred by Parliament<br />
they don't want to see it as an inherent right of indigenous people.<br />
J: Prime Minister, when will we see your legislation on Mabo?<br />
PM:-Probably, you'll see it when I introduce it in the Parliament not so far<br />
from now.<br />
SYou can't give us a date yet'?<br />
PM: I think probably about the 16th or 17th.<br />
J: Prime Minister, do you see a democratic right to be able to criticise the<br />
High Court the Labor Party's position on the ad ban decision?<br />
PM: It is not a democratic right to go and say that the principal and most<br />
supreme court in the country should explain itself or resign over a<br />
matter like this, not when the party who is endorsing it was saying that<br />
the native title decision was correct. I mean, in a statement which Dr<br />
Hewson published in June he said the Liberal Opposition supports,<br />
the Coalition, supports the native title decision of the High Court. Now,<br />
to have a front bencher say that the High Court, endorsing a view that<br />
the Chief Justice should explain himself or resign is an outrage.<br />
J: That was only a principle, it wasn't policy.<br />
PM: Yes, that was only a principle, it wasn't policy that's right. We<br />
discovered that with your very important probing on Sunday Laurie<br />
( Oakes).<br />
J: Mr Keating, you talk about a vested interested, in your statement, you<br />
talk about vested interests are you talking about Mr McLachlan being<br />
a pastoralist there?<br />
PMVI No, but look, Mr McLachlan is a pastoralist and a substantial one and<br />
he comes from that area of Australian life that believe that the<br />
country's bounty is for them to enjoy, but nobody else. The fact is, the<br />
Court has made a principled decision here and Professor Blainey's<br />
views are an outrage, but the greater outrage is the endorsement of<br />
them by Mr McLachlan and the failure of the Leader of the Opposition<br />
to stand him up. What is politics coming to? </p>
<p>J: Mr Keating, the Greens seem to be suggesting now that there won't be<br />
time to consider this legislation this year are you concerned that it<br />
won't get through the Parliament this year?<br />
PM: I would like to see it through the Parliament this year and the Greens<br />
have got to know and have got to understand this well, that what<br />
Richard Court wants to do is to extinguish native title. He wants to<br />
wipe out the private propert rights of Aboriginal people, that is what's<br />
on here. Richard Court wants to take the private property rights and to<br />
use Mr McLachlan words " start the process of reversal of the native<br />
fitle decision". I mean, they're the stakes here, so we are not worried<br />
about some petty debate about time tables, we are worried about<br />
matters here of great principle.<br />
J So, will the Federal legislation override the West Australian<br />
legislation?<br />
PM: Well, you wait to see that. Look, the Federal legislation will take<br />
primacy in these matters.<br />
J: And you are convinced that the West Australian legislation will be<br />
unconstitutional?<br />
PM: I am convinced that the Commonwealth Parliament's power to legislate<br />
in respect of Aboriginal people is secure, sound.<br />
J, Prime Minister, what is your response to yesterday's opposition<br />
questioning in Estimates about the Lodge?<br />
PM:-I thought it was appalling and I mean Dr Hewson sanctioning this sort<br />
of behaviour could you imagine Menzies raking over John Curtin's<br />
tenure or staff arrangements at the Lodge or John Curtin raking over<br />
Joe Lyons family arrangements at the Lodge this is the sort of dirty<br />
linen view that the Liberal party now specialise in, Where is the<br />
Liberal party under this man? How low does Australian politics need to<br />
sink? Can I say, I was also appalled at just how quickly the voyeurs of<br />
the Press Gallery took this up in a London tabloid way with alacrity that<br />
would even surprised the London tabloids, and ran it all on pages one<br />
and two of the newspapers. I might also refer you to the correction<br />
The Canberra Times hid on page two of its edition today after running<br />
two front pages on Saturday and Sunday about this phoney story<br />
about prints in the Cabinet Room. The Press Gallery ought to get on<br />
with the big issues and wake up to itself.<br />
ends </p>
