Senator The Hon. K. S. Wriedt and The Minister for Minerals<br />

and included the Minister of Finance, His Excellency Mr K. Aichi,<br />
the Minister of Agriculture and Forestry, His Excellency<br />
Mr Y. Sakurauchi, the Minister of International Trade and<br />

of State for Ec onomic Planning, His Excellency Mr Z. Kosaka.<br />
The Prime Minister of Japan, His Excellency Mr Kakuei<br />
Tanaka, sent a message of welcome to the meeting.<br />
In their keynote speeches, the two Foreign Ministers<br />
noted the encouraging development of relations between Australia<br />
and Japan in all fields and the firm basis of mutual co-operation<br />
which existed between them.<br />
They recognised that a high level of interdependence<br />
had developed between the economies of the two countries.<br />
They acknowledged that it was essential that a spirit<br />
of friendship and co-operation should continue to govern<br />
relations between the two countries in the economic and related<br />
fields, and it was therefore agreed that the two Governments </p>
<p>-2-<br />
would begin discussions on a broad bilateral treaty in these<br />
fields. The Committee held wide ranging discussions on economic<br />
and financial matters of mutual interest.<br />
It reviewed the economic situation of the respective<br />
countries. It noted with satisfaction the prospects for growth in<br />
the long term in the * two countries, and the opportunities which<br />
this offers for increased co-operation in the economic field<br />
between the two countries.<br />
Concern was expressed on the question of the<br />
inflationary tendencies now apparent in the international<br />
economy and Ministers reported actions which their respective<br />
Governments were taking to deal with these problems, bearing<br />
in mind the growing interdependence of nations in a world<br />
economy. Ministers exchanged views on the progress being made<br />
towards reform of the international monetary system, designed<br />
to provide a basis for the stable long term development of<br />
international economic relations.<br />
The Committee welcomed the achievements of the recent<br />
GATT Ministerial Conference held in Tokyo and reaffirmed that the<br />
multilateral trade negotiations should result in the expansion<br />
and the ever greater liberalisation of international trade of<br />
both industrial and agricultural products.<br />
Ministers pledged their cooperative efforts to assure<br />
early and constructive results of these negotiations in concert<br />
with other countries of the world.<br />
Ministers recognised the close interdependence andDI<br />
complementary nature of the bilateral trade between Australia<br />
and Japan which was of such great importance to the two<br />
countries and welcomed the evidence of further expansion of<br />
the trade. In view of the important developments which had taken<br />
place in trade between the two countries in the decade since<br />
the agreement on commerce was last revised in 1963, Ministers<br />
considered that it would be appropriate to review the agreement </p>
<p>-3-<br />
taking account of the discussions referred to in paragraph<br />
above. Australian Ministers explained the basic policies of<br />
the Australian Government or, foreign investment and noted that<br />
foreign investment would continue to play an important role in<br />
Australia's economic development.<br />
They further noted that all foreign investment<br />
proposals in Australia would in future be examined more closely<br />
to assess the benefits of such investment for Australia.<br />
Japanese Ministers stated that freer movement of<br />
international capital investment was essential for the sound<br />
development of free and open international economy.<br />
They further explained, and Australian Ministers noted,<br />
that the nature of the investment from Japan to Australia had<br />
been not to own and control the Australian resources but to<br />
contribute to the development of resources and secondary<br />
industries in Australia mostly through participating in the<br />
Australian initiated projects.<br />
The Committee recognised the contribution which<br />
capital investment has made to the development of the<br />
economies of the two countries0<br />
Australian Ministers explained the more liberal<br />
import policies initiated by the new Government and especially<br />
tariff policies including the 25 per cent across the board<br />
tariff reduction. Japanese Ministers explained the 20 per cent cut<br />
across the board reduction in Japanese tariffs0<br />
The Committee recognised that both actions were<br />
significant contributions to the liberalisation of international<br />
trade0 The Japanese Ministers noted with appreciation the<br />
positive response by the Australian Government to the points<br />
made by the Japanese Government about Australian tariff<br />
policies following the last Ministerial meeting.<br />
While the various actions taken had met some points<br />
of concern the Committee recognised the need for further<br />
discussions at the official level on these matters. </p>

Australian Ministers recognised Japan's concern to<br />
obtain stable and adequate supplies of primary products,<br />
especially foodstuffs, and materials for industry.<br />
They stated that Australia looked forward to the further<br />
development of trade in these products in a way which would bring<br />
benefits to both countries.<br />
The Committee reviewed the measures taken by the<br />
Japanese Government in response to the hope expressed earlier<br />
by Australian Ministers for greater and more predictable<br />
access to the Japanese market for Australian primary products and<br />
discussed the question of the supply and demand situationan<br />
access for agricultural commodities.<br />
It was agreed that it was desirable for discussions<br />
between officials to be initiated on these matters.<br />
The Committee noted that such discussions would<br />
signify an important aspect of the further development of<br />
cooperative relations between the two countries.<br />
Stable and continuing growth in trade in these items<br />
was very important to both countries and ministers recognised<br />
that, where appropriate and feasible, international commodity<br />
agreements and mutually beneficial long term supply arrangements<br />
which were consistent with their international obligations<br />
would contribute to the achievement of this goal.<br />
Australian Ministers expressed the view that Australia<br />
should develop strong and healthy secondary industries which<br />
would provide employment and contribute to the welfare of the<br />
Australian people.<br />
They took the opportunity to outline to Japanese<br />
Ministers the new measures and policies extending beyond tariff<br />
assistance that are currently being developed to promote the<br />
development of a more efficient secondary industry in Australia,<br />
Ministers recognised the mutual interdependence<br />
and complementarity of Australia and Japan in energy and<br />
natural resources. The Committee emphasised the importance of the mutual<br />
reliability of the Japanese market for Australian natural<br />
resources on the one hand, and on the other, of Australia as </p>
<p>a source of' supply of' these resources.<br />
Ministers reaffirmed that it was desirable for officials<br />
of the two Governments to continue to have discussions and exchange<br />
of information on various aspects of their mutual interests in<br />
developing, and processing and trade in mineral and energy<br />
resources including uranium in Australia.<br />
Ministers discussed the world situation on energy<br />
supplies and noted the importance to both countries of continued<br />
access to oil supplies.<br />
Ministers also discussed alternative energy sources<br />
and the increasing use of nuclear fuels for the production of<br />
energy. Ministers noted that Australia had the potential to<br />
become an important source of nuclear fuel.<br />
The Committee welcomed the recent measures taken by<br />
both countries to facilitate entry and stay for business<br />
purposes, and agreed that the two Governments should continue<br />
to give full consideration to this matter for mutual benefit.<br />
The Australian Prime Minister introduced the W 1<br />
Minister for Defence and Foreign Relations of Papua New Guinea,<br />
Mr Maori Kiki, who gave an explanation of recent developments<br />
in Papua New Guinea.<br />
He reviewed the progress being made towards<br />
independence, and explained Papua New Guinea's current<br />
development policies as well as its interest in obtaining<br />
development assistance from overseaso<br />
Japanese Ministers noted the developments in Papua<br />
New Guinea, expressed the wish that Papua New Guinea would<br />
attain independence at an early date and noted that Japan<br />
looked forward to the progressive establishment of full<br />
cooperative relations with Papua New Guinea in all fields.<br />
Australian MVinisters expressed their appreciation for<br />
the hospitality and arrangements made by the Japanese Government<br />
for this meeting of the Ministerial Committee.<br />
At the conclusion of the meeting Australian and<br />
Japanese Ministers expressed their pleasure at the wide<br />
ranging and cordial nature of the discussions. </p>
<p>-6-<br />
Encouraged by the success of this meeting, Australian<br />
and Japanese Ministers looked forward to the next meeting of<br />
the Ministerial Committee, which has been provisionally<br />
scheduled for 1974 in Canberra. </p>
