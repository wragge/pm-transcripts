FOR MEDIA 13 FEBRUARY 1990<br />
Discussions between my Ministers and the Victorian<br />
Government on the forests of East Gippsland have at all<br />
times been on the basis of commitments regarding job<br />
security and security of resource for the forest industries.<br />
I confirm the following undertakings:<br />
S Any agreement reached by the Commonwealth with the<br />
Victorian Government will be on the basis of the<br />
implementation of that agreement causing no loss of<br />
jobs; and<br />
S All of the contracts between the Victorian Government<br />
and the industry will be honoured.<br />
Should the industry or the unions at any time believe that<br />
the implementation of any such agreement has resulted in job<br />
losses, I would be happy to meet with representatives of the<br />
industry and its employees to discuss their concerns.<br />
Furthermore, my Ministers will consult with the industry and<br />
the trade union movement on the processes for giving effect<br />
to any agreement reached with the Victorian Government. </p>
