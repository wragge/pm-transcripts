    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Commonwealth and South Australian Governments will help build a stronger economy for South Australia by committing $1.5 billion to the North-South Road Corridor, a vital route for Adelaideâs motorists and freight heading to key transit hubs.</p>
<p>The North-South Road Corridor will significantly reduce congestion and commuter delays, while boosting freight efficiency and productivity.</p>
<p>The Commonwealth will contribute $944Â million to the project and the South Australian Government will contribute $572 million to ensure both the Darlington Interchange and the Torrens Road to River Torrens sections of South Road can be constructed at the same time.</p>
<p>This is the single largest infrastructure investment in South Australia by any Commonwealth Government and is a win for all South Australian motorists.</p>
<p>The North-South Road Corridor will drive economic growth and productivity uplifts through more efficient movement of freight through direct connections to Port Adelaide, Adelaide Airport and the Islington Intermodal Terminal.</p>
<p>The long-awaited upgrades will also improve access for commuters and heavy vehicles to the rapidly expanding industrial and residential growth areas in the north and the south, making Adelaide an even better place to live and do business.</p>
<p>The works will include:</p>
<ul><li>Upgrading the existingÂ  Darlington Interchange to expressway standard, including an interchange connection with the Southern Expressway and grade separations at Flinders Drive and Sturt Road; and</li>
</ul><ul><li>Widening South Road between Torrens Road and River Torrens and introducing a 1.4Â kilometre non-stop section with a lowered road extending beneath Port Road, Grange Road and the Outer Harbour rail line.</li>
</ul><p>The Commonwealth Assistant Minister for Infrastructure and Regional Development the Hon Jamie Briggs and South Australian Minister for Transport Stephen Mullighan will have responsibility for planning and delivering the projects.</p>
<p>The Commonwealth is working closely with the South Australian Government to get both projects moving with early works set to commence later this year. It is expected that major construction works will commence in 2015 and the upgrades will be open to traffic by 2018â19.</p>
