1 April 1997 TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
THE HON. JOHN HOWARD MP<br />
OPENING OF THE ANZ BANK BEIJING BRANCH OFFICE<br />
BEIJING, CHINA<br />
E&amp; O E<br />
To the Governor of the People's Bank of China, to Mr Alastair Maitland, Mr Rick<br />
Smith, the Australian Ambassador in China, other distinguished guests, ladies and<br />
gentlemen. I am really delighted that the ANZ Bank has been granted a license to operate in<br />
Beijing. I want on behalf of the Australian Government to thank the monetary<br />
authorities in China for that decision. I also want to thank the Australian Embassy for<br />
work that it did in sponsoring and helping the application. But most particularly I want<br />
to congratulate the ANZ Bank on the success it has achieved in gaining that license<br />
and thereby being able to open a branch, the second of its branches, in China.<br />
One of the features of my visit to China has been to stress the diversity of the<br />
economic relationship between our two countries. Traditionally that relationship has<br />
been expressed through commodity trade and emphasis on mining and industrial<br />
matters but it is also important to underscore the range of sophisticated financial and<br />
other services we have available and the great strength of the banking system and the<br />
banking industry and the quality of banks in Australia.<br />
Without in any way diminishing the continued value of Australia's mining industry and<br />
our agricultural product and our other activities I believe in the years ahead the<br />
support and the opportunities that the Australian service sector, particularly the<br />
financial services, will offer to China will be quite immense.<br />
Australia has a very strong and stable banking system. The ANZ Bank has long been<br />
part of that very stable banking system and it is no surprise to me nor to other<br />
observers of the Australian financial system that it should have sought and obtained<br />
this license here in Beijing. </p>
<p>2<br />
I am sure that the ANZ Bank will make a real contribution to providing a wide range<br />
of financial services to businesses not only here in Beijing but in years ahead in other<br />
parts of China.<br />
So, let me conclude my remarks by again congratulating the ANZ Bank on what it has<br />
achieved, thanking the monetary authorities of China for granting the license and<br />
remarking that this is yet another element of the burgeoning economic, commercial and<br />
business association between Australia and China.<br />
The economic links between nations are best expressed through the vigour of private<br />
sector participation in the respective affairs of the two countries and the decision of the<br />
ANZ Bank to seek a branch here and the decision of the Chinese authorities to grant<br />
the license is evidence of a determination on both sides to ensure that the relationship<br />
deepens and broadens.<br />
I wish the ANZ Bank Beijing branch much business.<br />
Thank you. </p>
