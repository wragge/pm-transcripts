FOR PRESS: P. M. No 68/ 1970<br />
BRITISH ELECTION RESULT<br />
Comment by the Prime Minister, Mr._ ohn Gorton,<br />
I warmly congratulate Mr. Heath on his electoral success and<br />
on his becoming Prime Minister. I have had a number of opportunities<br />
both in Britain and Australia to get to know him. As a personality he is<br />
familiar to all Australians not only in his capacity as a British political<br />
leader but as a sportsman. His recent visit to Australia and his close<br />
personal links here mean that he carries with him in his task o Prime<br />
Minister of one of the world's most influential nations a first hand experience<br />
of Australia and its people. I look forward to a close and fruitful collaboration<br />
with him on a wide range of matters of particular and mutual interest to our<br />
two countries.<br />
CANBERRA June 1970 The Prime Minister has sent a personal message of congratulation<br />
to Mr. Heath. </p>
