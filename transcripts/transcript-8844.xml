PRIME MINISTER<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON PJ. KEATING NIMP<br />
The swearing in of the second Keating Ministry will take place at 10.30 am today,<br />
Wednesday 24 March. I am pleasedito announce the composition of the ministry which I<br />
will be recommending to the Governor-General.<br />
The complete list of the ministry, with details of representation of ministers in the other<br />
chamber, is attached.<br />
There will continue to be thiny ministers, with a Cabinet of nineteen and ten<br />
parliamentary secretaries.<br />
As well as bringing new figures into the Cabinet and the Ministry, I have taken the<br />
opportunity to make several changes indepartmental arrangements to reflect emerging<br />
priorities. But the basic structures themselves a Labor reform have served well and<br />
will remain.<br />
As before the election, the Cabinet includes a number of ministers with long experience in<br />
government. I am pleased to announce that Senator Graham Richardson will once again<br />
bring his considerable abilities to the Cabinet. The talented Cabinet team has also been<br />
augmented by the elevation to Cabinet of Peter Baldwin, a minister of outstanding ability<br />
who will be able, as a Cabinet member, to build on his earlier experience as a minister.<br />
I also welcome to the Cabinet three new members who have not previously held<br />
ministerial posts. They are Bob McMullan, Laurie Brereton and Michael Lee who I am<br />
confident will be able to make major contributions to the work of the government in the<br />
portfolios of Arts and Administrative Services, Industrial Relations, Tourism and<br />
Resources. It is also the intention to appoint Michael Lavarch as Attorney-General after<br />
the poll for the seat of Dickson.<br />
In. addition, there.. will be six new ministems.. not in the Cabinet. They are Frank Walker,<br />
who as Special Minister of State in my portfolio will have particular responsibility for<br />
facilitation of major development projects: George Gear; Chris Schacht; John Faulkner,<br />
Rosemary Crowley and Duncan Kerr. The infusion of new talent they represent will help<br />
ensure that the government continues to be relevant and responsive to the changing<br />
conditions and circumstances of the 1990s. Mr Kerr will act as Attorney-General pending<br />
Mr Lavarch's appointment. </p>
<p>2<br />
Of the Parliamentary Secretaries, six are new to the position. The institution of<br />
Parliamentary Secretary provides a very inexpensive means not only of giving talented<br />
individuals executive experience but providing Ministers with needed support.<br />
I wish to draw attention to the important modifications in ministerial arrangements.<br />
As Prime Minister I am already significantly involved, through my department and<br />
Ministers assisting me, in the major areas of social and cultural change in Australia<br />
represented by the Office of the Status of Women. the Office of Multicultural Affairs and<br />
the Aboriginal Reconciliation Unit. The 1990s will see us carry further the shift towards a<br />
more diverse, outward looking and just society and I intend to enhance the role of the<br />
Prime Ministership in this.<br />
Accordingly there will be an Office of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs in the<br />
Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, and the Minister and ATSIC will be<br />
located in my portfolio. The Office will not be large, but have a policy advising capability<br />
and will house the Aboriginal Reconciliation Unit. The Office will also be able to provide<br />
advice and services to the minister when it would be inappropriate for the only source of<br />
advice to be ATSIC. For example where Aboriginal groups engage in litigation against<br />
the Commonwealth there may be a nced-for instructions to the Commonwealth's legal<br />
advisers of a kind which ATSIC would regard as inconsistent with its role.<br />
I emphasise, however, that there is no intention in establishing the Office to undermine the<br />
primary role of ATSIC as adviser to the government on Aboriginal matters. Excellent<br />
working relationships have been established between the portfolio and ATSIC on major<br />
issues and this will continue. The Office will complement ATSIC and its creation<br />
highlights the importance the Government attaches to addressing issues affecting<br />
Aboriginal and Tones Strait Islander people and, in particular, to pressing ahead<br />
effectively with the reconciliation process.<br />
Some particular programs for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people will remain<br />
with the specialised Departments, for example DEET in the area of education. But Mr<br />
Tickner, as Minister with overall responsibility in the field, will take a strong and<br />
continuing interest in all the Government's activities in Aboriginal affairs.<br />
Senator Evans, who will be the Minister for Foreign Affairs, will be joined in the Foreign<br />
Affairs and Trade portfolio by a second Cabinet minister, Senator Cook, who takes on the<br />
vital responsibility of pursuing our overseas trade interests. His ability to concentrate<br />
effort upon this will be enhanced by the presence in the portfolio of a third Minister,<br />
Gordon Bilney, who will take over development assistance activities, formerly with the<br />
Trade Minister.<br />
Mr Howe, the Deputy Prime Minister, will be Minister for Housing, Local Government<br />
and Community Services. We are concerned to improve the quality of life in our cities<br />
and particularly people's access to services through improvements in service delivery and<br />
planning. Mr Howe will have particular responsibility for initiatives in this area, along<br />
with continuing responsibility for housing matters, including the better cities program,<br />
augmented by local government which has been in the immigration portfolio, and<br />
locational disadvantage studies which have been in the Department of the Prime Minister </p>
<p>3<br />
and Cabinet. Mr Howe's portfolio will also take responsibility for the National Capital<br />
Planning Authority.<br />
I expect health issues to have an even higher focus during the next parliamentary term.<br />
We need to examine service delivery issues to improve the efficiency with which the<br />
medical system meets customer needs. We need also to look at the relationship between<br />
the public and private health systems to ensure we are using both optimally, and to make<br />
the most of the linkage between the two. Reflecting this and especially the Medicare<br />
arrangements, there will be another Cabinet minister in the Health. Housing, Local<br />
Government and Community Services portfolio. This is Senator Richardson, who<br />
becomes Minister for Health.<br />
Reflecting this government's commitment to families, there will also be a Minister for<br />
Family Services in the Health, Housing, Local Government and Community Services<br />
portfolio, which will be further enhanced by the addition of the Child Protection Council<br />
and the International Year of the Family secretariat, from the Prime Minister and Cabinet<br />
portfolio. Rosemary Crowley, the Minister for Family Services, will also be Minister<br />
assisting me for the Status of Women.<br />
As promised before the election, there will be a ministry with special responsibility for<br />
regional development. The Department of Industry, Technology and Regional<br />
Development, under Mr Griffiths, will co-ordinate national programs to bring vigorous<br />
new industries to declining regions and to equip people with the skills needed for these<br />
new industries. The Office of Northern Development will move from my department to<br />
the Department of Industry, Technology and Regional Development and Mr Ted Lindsay,<br />
the Parliamentary Secretary in that portfolio, will have special responsibility for Northem<br />
Development issues.<br />
There has been significant structural change in many industries in recent years and,<br />
increasingly, this is being linked to broader competition policy issues. The current Hilmer<br />
Review into competition policy should reinforce these linkages. In this climate. I have<br />
decided to move responsibilities for competition policy into the Treasury, so that it may<br />
complement further the government's continuing microeconomic reform agenda.<br />
Consumer interests will, however, continue to be handled by the Minister for Consumer<br />
Affairs, Ms McHugh, in the Attorney-General's portfolio.<br />
I have also decided to streamline the Cabinet commitee_. systeniand have committees<br />
rather than full Cabinet handle the initial consideration of Cabinet matters.<br />
This approach will leave the Cabinet free to concentrate on broader strategic issues rather<br />
than some of the more detailed deliberations which can take considerable Cabinet time.<br />
Committee decisions will continue to be submitted to Cabinet for endorsement and<br />
Cabinet will be expected to consider the major policy issues, but without getting bogged<br />
down in detail which can be settled in the Committee discussions.<br />
The new Cabinet structure will consist of:-<br />
Expenditure Review Committee<br />
Structural Adjustment Committee </p>
<p>4<br />
Social Policy Committee<br />
Security Committee<br />
General Policy Committee<br />
Parliamentary Business committee<br />
A General Policy Committee has been added to the structure to pick up the issues not<br />
falling within the terms of reference of the other policy committees and the Sustainable<br />
Development Committee has been abolished as its principal task of developing the<br />
Ecologically Sustainable Development and Greenhouse strategies has been completed.<br />
New administrative arrangements were put in place in December 1992 to handle the<br />
authorisation of draft legislation and there is, therefore, no longer a need for a Legislation<br />
Committee. Details of the membership of committees will be released separately.<br />
Also attached is a list of departmental secretaries.<br />
The government is well served by the public service and regards stability at the top as<br />
desirable. We do, however, have a policy of rotating secretaries after several years in their<br />
positions and have taken : he opportunity of the appointment of a new ministry to effect a<br />
small number of changes<br />
Mr Tony Cole, the Secre: ary to the Treasury, will become Secretary to the Department of<br />
Health, Housing, Local Government and Community Services. Mr Ted Evans, a former<br />
Deputy Secretary in the Treasury, moves from his current post at the International<br />
Monetary Fund to become Secretary to the Treasury. Mr Derek Volker, Secretary to the<br />
Department of Social Security, moves to Employment, Education and Training to be<br />
replaced by Mr Tony Blunn from the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment and<br />
Territories. Mr Stuart Hamilton, from Health, Housing and Community Services will<br />
become Secretary to the Department of Environment, Sport and Territories.<br />
Dr Geoff Miller. currently Secretary to the Department of Primary Industries and Energy,<br />
is a candidate for the position of Director-General of the United Nations Food and<br />
Agriculture Organisation. In recognition of his need to spend a good deal of his time in<br />
pursuit of this objective, and to enhance his prospects. Dr Miller has asked to be relieved<br />
of the full time burden of his present duties The government is strongly supportive of<br />
Dr Miller's candidacy. and accordingly we have decided to appoint him Associate<br />
Secretary for Agriculture in the Department of Primary Industries and Energy. He will be<br />
succeeded as Secretary by Mr Greg Taylor, from Employment, Education and Training.<br />
He will, however, remain Secretary to the Department of Tourism.<br />
I wish to. take this. opportunity to. thank. those. Secretaries whoare moving for their<br />
contributions to the government and the nation over the last few years. I am confident<br />
they will continue to maintain the quality of public administration.<br />
