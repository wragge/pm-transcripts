    <content><![CDATA[<p>Nine young Australians have today been named winners of the Think Climate, Think Change Schools Competition, following an outstanding response from schoolchildren across the nation.</p>
<p>The winners of the competition are:</p>
<p>     * Category Grades 3-4: Isabella Compton, Our Lady of the Rosary Primary School, NSW.</p>
<p>     * Category Grades 5-7: Young Environment Protectors, Manchester Primary School, VIC (comprising Krystal Vanschoonhoven, Rhiannon Warner, Ashleigh Basham, Tani Watts, Thomas Stevens, Jessica Gilbee, and Isabelle Pope).</p>
<p>     * Category Grades 8-9: Michelle Aitken, John Curtin College of the Arts, WA.</p>
<p>The winners were able to show their artwork to Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, Deputy Prime Minister Julia Gillard and the Minister for Climate Change and Water, Senator Penny Wong, at Parliament House. They were able to raise their ideas about what climate change means to them.</p>
<p>Senator Wong said the widespread interest in the competition showed just how much young people cared about climate change.</p>
<p>âIt is our future generations that will feel the strongest impacts of climate change and the tremendous response to this competition shows just how concerned our youth are about climate change,'' she said.</p>
<p>âYoung Australians understand that we need to take action now.''</p>
<p>The competition was inspired by letters received from school children across Australia asking about climate change and sharing their ideas for solutions to the issue of climate change.</p>
<p>âI am greatly encouraged by the enthusiasm Australian students and teachers have shown for the competition  -  we received 7666 entries, which is a tremendous response,â Senator Wong said.</p>
<p>âI congratulate the winners and finalists and thank every student who took the time to enter the competition and share creatively what climate change means to them.â</p>
<p>The Government received entries in all forms, including paintings, short stories, cartoons and drawings. Students raised their concerns about what the environment may look like in the future if we do not act now and also explained ways people could help, such as using energy wisely. Entries came from as far away as Thursday Island and the Cocos (Keeling) Islands.</p>
