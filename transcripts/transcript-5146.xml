I ilC" ~ I<br />
FOR MEDIA 20 SEPTEMBER 1979<br />
PRIME MINISTER'S STAFF<br />
Mr Darcy Tronson, who has been Principal Private Secretary<br />
to the Prime Minister since the latter part of last year,<br />
is rejoining the Federal Secretariat of the Liberal Party.<br />
Until his appointment to the Prime Minister's staff,<br />
Mr Tronson had been Assistant to the Party's Federal Director.<br />
He will return as Manager ( Special Projects), augmenting<br />
the Party's head office staff in the lead-up to election<br />
year. This additional assistance at the Federal Secretariat<br />
will also permit the Federal Director, Mr Eggleton, to give<br />
more time to his responsibilites as Campaign Director and<br />
to his political advisory role.<br />
The Prime Minister said today that he greatly appreciated<br />
the contribution that Darcy Tronson had made to the<br />
Private Office over the past year. He was glad that<br />
Mr Tronson would be returning to the Party' s professional<br />
ranks, where his experience would be particularly valuable<br />
in the period ahead.<br />
Mr Tronson will continue to serve as Principal Private-<br />
Secretary for the time being, until alternative arrangements<br />
can be made for the management of the Prime Minister's office. </p>
