Prime Minister Julia Gillard today said the 2011-12 Budget would deliver on a number of key election commitments made during the 2010 election.</p>
<p>The Government has already met more than half of its 2010 election commitments in the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook (MYEFO). </p>
<p>The 2011-12 Budget continues to deliver major policy initiatives committed to during the election in areas such as health, education and infrastructure.</p>
<p>Most of all, it honours our election commitment to return the Budget to surplus in 2012-13, which will underpin our long-term economic success.</p>
<p>Major election commitments delivered in this Budget include:</p>
<p> * 	$771.9 million over five years to support families cover the costs of raising teenagers and encourage them to stay at school;<br />
 * 	$425 million to reward great teachers through performance-based bonuses and $18.1 million to encourage bright, highly skilled professionals into a teaching career, over the next four years;<br />
 * 	$222 million for the expansion of the school chaplaincy program to up to 1,000 additional schools;<br />
 * 	$20 million to provide mentoring for trade apprentices to help them choose the right training pathway and supporting them to complete their training.</p>
