4l,, AUS AL1A<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR PRESS 28SEPTEMBER 1977<br />
LETTER TO MR FUKUDA<br />
The Prime Minister tel'exed the following letter to the<br />
Prime Minister of Japan, Mr Fukuda, today.<br />
My dear Prime Minister,<br />
I regret that I feel compelled to raise with you again the<br />
question of Australian exports of beef to Japan.<br />
Mr McKay, the leader of the Australian delegation to the<br />
bilaterial discussions with your officials in Tokyo on<br />
Monday and Tuesday of this week, has now reported to me.<br />
He has told me that no progress was made in establishing a<br />
more reliable and predictable basis for our beef trade.<br />
I am deeply disappointed that the understanding which we reached<br />
in our discussions, inKuala Lumpur, that officials should<br />
continue discussions in even closer fashion with a view<br />
to finding ways for more stability in exports, has yielded<br />
no results. I would have thought that the achievement of<br />
more stability -would at least have meant a move from the<br />
present six monthly quotas for beef imports to a twelve<br />
monthly basis.<br />
In our discussions in Kuala Lumpur we each recognised the political<br />
difficulties which each of our Governments face in<br />
relation to our beef industries. The beef issue is one which is<br />
infecting our trading relationship and indeed our total<br />
relationship. The close and friendly relationship which we<br />
now have and which we are both concerned to develop should not<br />
be put at risk.<br />
Knowing your concern about this matter, I would hope that you<br />
might personally review the position with a view to encouraging<br />
some progress towards a mutually satisfactory solution.<br />
I suggest that we should agree to resume the talks at an early<br />
date, and I would be happy to send one of my senior Ministers to<br />
Tokyo for this purpose.<br />
Yours sincerely,<br />
( Malcolm Fraser) </p>
