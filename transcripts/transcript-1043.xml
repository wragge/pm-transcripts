FOR PRESS EMBARGO: Midnight, 25.1.65<br />
AUSTRALIA DAY MESSAGE<br />
By the Acting Prime Minister, 11r. John McEwen<br />
Today, our 177th birthday, we look back with thankfulness<br />
and pride on the ability, energy and great vision of those who founded<br />
our country. They helped make Australia the wonderful nation we live<br />
in today. On this day we should dedicate ourselves to carry on their<br />
good work in the growth to becoming a great nation.<br />
Our forebears were adventurous people who, by their<br />
determination, carved out the structure which is the base of our<br />
efforts for the future. In the years ahead we will certainly have<br />
problems, but we have surmounted them in the past and will overcome<br />
them in the future.<br />
We have co-operated with our neighbours and friends, and<br />
will continue to do so. We wish to continue to work in peace and<br />
harmony with them.<br />
On this our national birthday, I ask New Australians to<br />
S share with Native-born Australians the heritage of which we are so<br />
proud. Each and every one of us should celebrate this day as a day<br />
of dedication.<br />
Canberra, January 25, 1965. </p>
