PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF SPEECH AND INTERVIEW WITH THE PRIME MINISTER,<br />
THE HON P J KEATING, M. P.<br />
GEELONG WOOL COMBING PLANT OPENING, CORIO, VIC<br />
FRIDAY 10 DECEMBER, 1993<br />
( Opening Remarks Speech):<br />
I am very delighted to be here on this occasion. I think this says a great deal<br />
about the change which is taking place In Australia, Indeed, In just this last<br />
couple of days you can see the threads of the potential of the nineties coming<br />
together.... with a conclusion of the GATT Round drawing to a close the<br />
benefits of which, as you know, Australia has put the Cairns group together and<br />
fought within the GATT now for seven years. And this agreement looks likely to<br />
be conservatively worth about two and a half billion to Australia, which will make<br />
a tremendous amount of difference not just In agriculture but In the trade In<br />
goods and services. We have seen, yesterday, news of -further employment<br />
growth In the economy leading now to 100,000 new jobs In three months which<br />
means the economy is ticking away We had confirmation just a week or two<br />
ago of the economy growing at about three and quarter percent and a week<br />
before that with Inflation around two percent.<br />
These are good things and we are seeing plants like this being developed in the<br />
wake of Australia's competitiveness which has now been with us for the better<br />
part of about six or seven years. So, this is a very great change and one which,<br />
I think, these various portents hold for the 1 990s and for Australia taking Its<br />
place more fully as a trading entity In the world </p>
<p>-2-<br />
( Doorstop Interview):<br />
J: Prime Minister, have you had any response from the United States about<br />
your concerns about the Blair House agreement?<br />
PM: Well, we will be pursuing the m arket access questions right up until the<br />
last moment but I think we have to record that the seven years of<br />
organlsation and lobbying which Australia has organised through the<br />
Cairns Group has now paid substantial dividends for us because we have<br />
kept the pressure on the system and we are going to get an agreement<br />
under the GATT and that agreement will conservatively be worth two<br />
and a half billion dollars to Australia. That's the bulk of It. And its a case<br />
now of understanding that with the large part of the bulk of It In place<br />
we're now chasing down the last of the market access questions and we'll<br />
do that right up until the agreement Is concluded.<br />
J: What was the detail of the letter?<br />
PM: Well, just saying that we'll still be pressing for access on particular<br />
commodities but recording, with the President, our pleasure with the<br />
United States' position to maintain the thrust of the Blair House<br />
agreement, the Blair House Accord between the Government of the<br />
United States and the European Community. That's what we wanted<br />
most preserved. And the substance of that has been preserved and so<br />
we're encouraging the President to complete the round, or have pressure<br />
on to complete the round, also saying that In terms of some of the market<br />
access questions we'd like to pursue these so that Australia walks away<br />
with the best possible deal we can get.<br />
J: ( naudible).. angry that it's been watered down?<br />
PM: The Australian media wants to be permanently angry. What about being<br />
permanently happy for a change? And that Is to say that we've got an<br />
outcome that we could not have envisaged seven years not even<br />
have envisaged seven years ago. At least a two and a half billion dollar<br />
benefit to Australia; most of that agricultural change that Is there Is<br />
because of this government. This government has built the structure to<br />
develop a real place In the negotiations of an International GATT Round.<br />
And we're now starting to draw some of the success from that in the<br />
closing days of the Uruguay Rou nd. So, for Australia it's going to be a tip<br />
top outcome. And if you take a plant like this plant here this plant will<br />
now feed its product into a world textile Industry which Is no longer<br />
constrained by the multi-fibre agreement, it's a two hundred billion dollar </p>
<p>-3-<br />
Industry and Wts going to be opened up to us, These are the sort of<br />
opportunities which the GATT can produce which Australia has gone for<br />
from the first moment It started In 1986.<br />
J: If GATT was to go ahead with the amended Blair House Agreement In<br />
place would It still be a tip top agreement?<br />
PM: Let me just make a more general point because I haven't got all day here<br />
I think what the GATs going to do Is underwrite a real pick-up in<br />
confidence In the world and In Austraia. And that's coming as we confirm<br />
that the Australian economy Is growing at three and a half percent, as we<br />
saw yesterday the creation of 100,000 jobs In three months, as we saw<br />
two weeks ago Inflation at around two percent. Australia is really well<br />
poised to ship products competitively into the world as It renews Its own<br />
economic recovery. And so, we're now a better set-up than perhaps<br />
we've been In the last 20 or 30 years probably since the war to<br />
participate In world trade as a competitive, Innovative nation and doing it<br />
in a way which also brings the. regions of Australia Into It, like Geelong<br />
and other regional parts of the country.<br />
J: ( inaudible)... on rice, what would you consider a good outcome?<br />
PM: I'm not here to give you a blow by blow, commodity by commodity answer<br />
to that... simply to say that I was at the 1986 OECD meeting where the<br />
Europeans were resisting putting agriculture Into the OECD communique.<br />
Australia got It into the communique, we got It onto the G7 Summit In<br />
Tokyo which was presided over by President Reagan, and a<br />
consequence of that Is that agriculture went Into the round. And not just<br />
agriculture, all the other things Australia Is Interested In, trade In services<br />
and International property rights. So, we will have set up in a background<br />
In trade that which we have never had before, and a large part of that<br />
structure has been put there by Australia. Anid that's why I think the<br />
Australian community should understand that a very big thing Is<br />
happening here, and, I think, a very great achievement and one that I<br />
hope will stand our economy in good stead for the next half century.<br />
J: Can I ask a question about South Australia? What chance for Labor?<br />
PM: In ele ctions you have to wait and see, as we found In March 1993. 1<br />
notice there Is very demure punting by the media these days once<br />
bitten, twice shy and all I say Is, that's a good policy.<br />
Ends. </p>
