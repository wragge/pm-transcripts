Prime Minister Julia Gillard and Premier Anna Bligh have announced that flood response and recovery efforts in Queensland will be bolstered with two Australian Defence Force (ADF) Sea King helicopters being sent to Roma.</p>
<p>The helicopters will support the response and recovery of towns and properties affected by flooding in the Condamine and Moonie rivers in south-west Queensland including Surat, St George, Dirranbandi and Thallon.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister said that the support from ADF will assist communities along the Condamine and Moonie rivers which are still experiencing rises as floodwaters move inland.</p>
<p>Already C-130 Hercules have delivered supplies from Brisbane to Mackay, these were then transported to Rockhampton.</p>
<p>These deliveries continue with more planned in coming days to ensure the Rockhampton community maintain food, water and other essential items.</p>
<p>Premier Anna Bligh said the unprecedented flooding being experienced in Queensland has seen tremendous support from the ADF.</p>
<p>The Navy Sea King helicopters will be on stand-by in Roma for use in various roles from resupply efforts to medical emergencies and evacuations.</p>
<p>These helicopters have a large lift capacity, able to lift loads greater than a Land Rover, and can operate day and night.</p>
<p>An Army Chinook is also on stand-by in Townsville should it be required by disaster managers.</p>
<p>Black Hawk helicopters will continue to be used in Central Queensland with evacuations.</p>
<p>A Royal Australian Air Force C-130 Hercules also delivered a 'flexible habitat', a purpose built temporary accommodation module, late last week which is now being used by the people of Emerald.</p>
