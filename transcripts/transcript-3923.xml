SPEECH BY THE PRIM11E M INISTER, AT THE PARLIM ENTARY LUNCHEON<br />
FOR THE PRIM E MINISTER OFM14ALAYSIA, 16 OCTOBER 1975<br />
On each of my nine visits to your capital<br />
since 1962 as Deputy Leader of the Opposition, as Leader<br />
of the Opposition, as Prime Minis ter of: Australia, you have<br />
always received me and I have been able to draw on your<br />
wisdom and experience. I have valued that highly and<br />
equally value the warmth of your friendship. It may be<br />
that in Australia we cannot welcome you with that natural<br />
grace, the instinctive elegance, the unaffected charm which<br />
is the characteristic of the Malaysian people. But there<br />
is nothing lacking in our warmth of feeling in our welcome<br />
to you and Toh Puan Rahah and our warmth and goodwill<br />
towards your people and your nation.<br />
My pleasure in welcoming you here on your first<br />
Prime Ministerial visit derives in considerable part from<br />
the honour I find in being host to a leader who must rank<br />
as South East Asia's longest serving and most dedicated<br />
and industrious servant of his people. For 20 years from<br />
the beginning of national independence, you have served as<br />
a Minister. Under your guidance the last five years have<br />
been years of marked growth and development within Malaysia.<br />
I recall my previous visits to your country<br />
not only because -of the pleasure the memory holds for me<br />
but as a measure of the remarkable and beneficial changes<br />
which have occurred in our region in that period. in<br />
1962 ASEAN could not have existed, could hardly have been<br />
contemplated. Confrontation has given way to regional<br />
cooperation which as made ASEAN one of the world's most<br />
truly effective regional associations. All the nations<br />
of our region except our commuon great reighbour Indonesia<br />
refused with varying degrees of hostility and ignorance,<br />
to recognise the reality of China. A thirty-year civil war<br />
in Indo-China was in a temporary lull before its bloodiest<br />
and most catastrophic renewal. The concept of a zone of<br />
peace, freedom and neutrality for the region would have<br />
been dismissed as dangerous nonsense as indeed it still<br />
is in certain quarters.<br />
As Prime Minister, Tun, you have been very much<br />
in the vanguard of those who have had the foresight to<br />
take positive steps in the developments which have ended<br />
old hostilities and the old sterilities. You led the way<br />
in recognising the reality of China and others have followed<br />
this lead. And now with the end of the Vietnamese and<br />
Cambodian wars your Government is actively working for<br />
harmony amkongst all the nations of South East Asia. I<br />
cannot but agree that the end of the war in Indo-China<br />
provides the region with its first real opportunity to<br />
achieve peace, progress and stability. You are to be<br />
commended for making cooperation and conciliation the<br />
basis of your relations with the new Indo China G overnments. ./ 2 </p>
<p>2.<br />
You realistically ackanxledge , I know, that the<br />
process of reconciliation will not be without its<br />
frustrations. But you will persevere. In the end<br />
trust and goodwill will be rewarded with the development<br />
of lasting links and mutual respect. You have<br />
urged ZOPPAN. Our region must not be the area of<br />
confrontation and competition between the Great Powers.<br />
It is gratifying to reflect upon our<br />
exchanges in Kuala Lumpur in January 1974, when the<br />
0 war in Indo China still raged, and note that many<br />
of the hopes we held then for the future of the region<br />
have come to be fulfilled.<br />
The relationship between our two countries<br />
today is deepening and widening. Trade, investment,<br />
development assistance, defence cooperation, participation<br />
in common regional organisations and in particular,<br />
the Commonwealth of Nations, and student exchange, and<br />
tourism, make our relationship meaningful, fruitful,<br />
living. We share common inheritance of institutions,<br />
Q particularly those relating to parliamentary democracy<br />
and the rule of law.<br />
Q We share the Federal system and a<br />
bicameral system, we share to a varying degree the experience<br />
of the difficulties of both. You, Prime'Minister,<br />
may even have experienced the passing pangs which come<br />
from the pretensions of provincial satraps.<br />
There may even be occasional murmurs against the cerntralists<br />
in Kuala Lumpur as there are against your counterparts<br />
in Canberra. Democracy, particularly in a federal system,<br />
is extraordinarily complex and extraordinarily fragile.<br />
Around the world it is going through its most challenging<br />
time. It is under challenge in nations with a<br />
relatively brief tradition of Parliamentary democracy,<br />
and in those with a long tradition. We are two of the </p>
<p>3.<br />
handful of Parliamentary democracies left in our*<br />
region. There are those in both our countries, who<br />
in their different ways, are challenging the system,<br />
challenging the tradition. The Aalaysian national<br />
Parliament is only twenty years old. It would be<br />
natural that such a nation would look to nations<br />
with a more mature Parliamentary system, an older<br />
tradition, well-entrenched democracy conventions,<br />
as an example nations like Australia, Parliaments<br />
like the Australian Parliament. It would be<br />
appalling if we were unable to get t-hat example.<br />
You, Mr Prime M1iniser, have battled valiantly in your<br />
country to uphold the essence of democracy. You<br />
have done your part. May I say in this Parliamentary<br />
gathering, as one Parliamentarian-to another, I<br />
intend to play mine. </p>
