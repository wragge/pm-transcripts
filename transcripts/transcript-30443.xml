    <content><![CDATA[<p>Â I am pleased to announce the membership of the Commonwealth Governmentâs Youth Pathways Action Plan Taskforce.</p>
<p><font size="3">The Taskforce will be chaired by Captain David Eldridge of the Salvation Army. I am especially pleased that Captain Eldridge has agreed to take on the role of Chairman, following his outstanding leadership of the Youth Homelessness Taskforce.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">The Taskforce includes members drawn from the community, academic and business sectors along with Commonwealth and State governments. A list of members and the terms of reference are attached.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">Importantly, the Taskforce will continue the work of building a social coalition with government, the business community, individuals and the non-government sector all playing important roles.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">From within the social coalition framework, the Taskforce will contribute to the development of youth policy, especially in the areas of:-</font></p>
<ul><li><font size="3">employment opportunities;</font></li>
<li><font size="3">education and training;</font></li>
<li><font size="3">supporting all young people to gain basic and workplace skills;</font></li>
<li><font size="3">homelessness and family breakdown;</font></li>
<li><font size="3">prevention of youth suicide;</font></li>
<li><font size="3">access to services;</font></li>
<li><font size="3">financial and economic difficulties; and</font></li>
<li><font size="3">other social problems such as drug use.</font></li>
</ul><p><font size="3">The Youth Pathways Taskforce will focus on strengthening community support for young people and their families. It will examine ways that government, community organisations and business can help young Australians as they approach adulthood and assume productive and independent lives of their own.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">The establishment of the Taskforce reflects the Governmentâs belief that this country's most important resource is itâs young people.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">It also reflects the belief that a strong and stable family life is an essential source of support and security for them as they make choices about their future.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">The expertise of the Taskforce will be directed at setting out new approaches to tackling disadvantage and social problems that impede the progress of young people, as they move to becoming young adults who value, and are valued by, their community. In particular, it will consider new approaches based on prevention and early intervention.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">The Taskforce will report to the Ministers for Education, Training and Youth Affairs and Family and Community Services on the development of a Youth Pathways Action Plan. The broad objectives of the action plan will be to improve outcomes for young people by:-</font></p>
<ul><li><font size="3">strengthening existing pathways for young people;</font></li>
<li><font size="3">improving early assistance for young people at risk;</font></li>
<li><font size="3">strengthening and supporting the capacity of familiesâ and communitiesâ to help young people; and</font></li>
<li><font size="3">finding innovative ways of expanding opportunities for young people to fully participate in the economic and social life of their communities.</font></li>
</ul><p><font size="3">The Taskforce secretariat will be jointly provided by the Department of Education, Training and Youth Affairs and the Department of Family and Community Services.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">The first meeting will be held at Parliament House from 12 to 14 October 1999.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">The Taskforce will provide a report to the Government by March 2000. I wish them well with the task ahead of them and look forward to their report.</font></p>
