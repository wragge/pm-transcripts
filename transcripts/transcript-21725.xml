    <content><![CDATA[<p>Commander George McGuire, Admiral Ritchie, my parliamentary colleagues, my fellow Australians. I'm here to today to express the great joy of Australia and the gratitude of all of the Australian people to the wonderful men and women of HMAS Kanimbla, for their outstanding job that they have done in our name-so let's all give them a big hand.</p>
<p>It's great to have you back and it's great to be able on this beautiful Sydney morning to say thank you for the magnificent way in which you have done for Australia, what Australia is very good at doing and that is helping others. And the great relief and assistance that you brought to the people of Indonesia, so tragically affected by the tsunami and then the subsequent earthquake is something that will long live in the recollection of all of your fellow Australians.</p>
<p> You were of course touched by tragedy, the loss of nine of your mates in very sad circumstances, added to the magnificence of the work that you did. The way in which your commanding officer, Commander McGuire, let's have a very special hand for him, he's done a wonderful job. The way in which he blended, leadership, strength and compassion at a very difficult time is a tribute to the training he's received in the Royal Australian Navy and it is also a tribute the strength of his own leadership and to his character.</p>
<p>But to all of the ship's company, thank you from the bottom of my heart and I know from the rest of your fellow Australians for the wonderful job you've done, welcome home, spend the rest of the day with your family and loved ones, it's great to have you back, we love the job you've done and as Australians we're immensely proud of everything that you've done in our name.</p>
<p> Thank you.</p>
