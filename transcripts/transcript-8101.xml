PRIMEST MINISTE<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF QUESTION AND ANSWER SEGMENT, AUSTRALIAN<br />
FINANCIAL REVIEW POST-BUDGET DINNER, SYDNEY CONVENTION<br />
CENTRE 22 AUGUST 1990<br />
E OE PROOF ONLY<br />
QUESTION: Would the Prime Minister enlighten me as to<br />
the decision making process which led to the decision to<br />
send our Australian naval ships to the Gulf?<br />
PM: Let me first of all and I'm sure none of you<br />
think this. There are some members of this community<br />
who suggest that what happened was that I was sitting<br />
there in the Lodge playing with Whiskey the cat waiting<br />
for George Bush to ring. I'd given no thought to this<br />
matter at all. I mean George rang and George said send<br />
some ships. I said yes George, thank you. Well that's<br />
not how it happened. That's not how it happened. He<br />
rang me on a Friday which was the end of a process not<br />
the beginning. There had been raised in Washington<br />
earlier that week at the diplomatic level and then at the<br />
forces level the question as to whether Australia may be<br />
prepared to send some force. So there had been a great<br />
deal of discussion going on. I was in the fortunate<br />
position of being informed about all that discussion,<br />
being privvy to the intelligence about what was going on.<br />
I'd also had the good fortune to have met with my Cabinet<br />
ID on the Monday when they had unanimously agreed to the<br />
sanctions that we had agreed to put on immediately and<br />
that involved the stopping of the imports of oil from<br />
Iraq and exports from Australia. A unanimous decision by<br />
the Cabinet on that Monday the 6th of August that we<br />
would endorse and support any United Nations Security<br />
Council resolution. So I had a clear sense of the mind<br />
of Cabinet on that Monday the 6th of August. So there<br />
was my knowledge of the Cabinet. I was involved in being<br />
informed about developments in the area and also the<br />
discussions -that * were going -on-in,-Washingtonat the<br />
levels to which I referred. And so I had come to the<br />
conclusion very quickly in considering all these things<br />
that while this was one of the most serious decisions<br />
that I had to come to that essentially the principles<br />
were clear. I took the opportunity of discussing the<br />
matter with the members of my Security Committee which<br />
has the responsibility of dealing with issues of this<br />
kind. I had their unanimous support. So by the time<br />
President Bush rang me on Friday I had a clear view a) of<br />
the facts, b) of the principles involved, c) of the mind </p>
<p>Of My Cabinet. Armed in that way I was able to indicate<br />
to President Bush what my view and the view of my<br />
Government would be. So without going any further they<br />
were the processes. The second question was what<br />
mechanism does the Prime Minister believe will lead to<br />
the referendum on abolition of States' rights being<br />
successful? I don't know where that question comes from<br />
because I've got no proposal and I'm not aware of anyone<br />
else who's got a referendum to abolish State rights. So<br />
all I can say is if anyone conjured up the idea and tried<br />
to put it I'd like to be having a bet on the outcome. I<br />
haven't got any such proposal. What I have got, which is<br />
very important is a, what I hope will be a path breaking<br />
proposal to bring the Premiers together with me on the<br />
last two days of October in Brisbane. Whoever would have<br />
thought a couple of years ago that you would have been<br />
having a constitutional convention of Premiers in<br />
Brisbane to talk about the relationships between the<br />
Commonwealth and States. But such is the rapidity of<br />
change in the world in which we live. That conference,<br />
and I pay full tribute to the Premiers, including you<br />
know that rare species now, a Liberal premier, Nick<br />
Greiner, I give him absolutely full marks for his<br />
positive response. At that conference what we will be<br />
doing will be to discuss how we can responsibly as<br />
political leaders in this country go about in a more<br />
effective way the discharge of our functions. There's<br />
too much overlap and duplication now. What we are going<br />
to seek to do is to work out ways in which, if it's<br />
better for the States and local government to do<br />
something, then we would get out. If it's better that we<br />
do it, they would get out. It is not a cost saving<br />
exercise although obviously cost, there would be savings.<br />
But that's a residual. The purpose is to try and get<br />
more efficient, effective government and delivery of<br />
services to the citizens of this country. That's the way<br />
in which to go about reform in this country. I don't<br />
know where this idea of a referendum to abolish State<br />
rights comes from. It hasn't come from me.<br />
QUESTION: The question I'm afraid comes back to a<br />
subject that's had a lot of exposure and it's the one of<br />
foreign debt. I say that you made no reference in<br />
referring to your forward policies on reduction or even<br />
stabilisation of foreign debt other than your comment on<br />
increasing exports and lower imports. I pose two<br />
questions that you could perhaps comment on. First is<br />
your view. of. the trend -of foreign.. debt and the second<br />
one, where are the increased exports coming from?<br />
PM: Let me say this and I know in opening a reply in<br />
this way there may be some guffaws and hee-haws. But<br />
nevertheless what I say by way of opening is, I think,<br />
indisputably true, that the origins of our problem in<br />
this regard were what we inherited. Now let me say that<br />
that is not seen as simply a statement of convenience by<br />
myself. I refer you to what was said on page 2, dot 56,<br />
2.56 of the authoritative budget statements which are </p>
<p>prepared not by the Government but by the Treasury. They<br />
make, I believe, an extremely telling point in their<br />
conclusion on this section. They say finally the marked<br />
deterioration in Australia's external accounts which has<br />
its roots in the deterioration in the public sector's<br />
financial position between the mid 1970s and early 1980s<br />
has left the Australian economy with a long task of<br />
adjustment. Now that as I say is the assessment of the<br />
Treasury as to the origins of the problem. We had a<br />
country which was in very very serious decline when we<br />
came to office. Australia was unable to stand up to<br />
international competition. It had for too long suffered<br />
under a overvalued currency and it had drawn itself<br />
behind protectionist barriers, and as you know a massive<br />
public sector deficit which at the Commonwealth level was<br />
over $ 9 billion when we came in and that's not counting<br />
the States. That massive public sector deficit more than<br />
accounted for the imbalance between domestic savings and<br />
investment. Now what we have been doing is to try and<br />
tackle the fundamental problems which mean restructuring<br />
the Australian economy to make it more competitive. Let<br />
me say that you would be aware I'm sure of the basic<br />
success that has been achieved there now. We've had, as<br />
you know, a massive surge in investment in this country.<br />
It came to its peak over 1988 and 1989. And this has<br />
involved the beginnings of a fundamental restructuring of<br />
the Australian economy which is what is necessary to deal<br />
with the fundamentals of our debt problem. Now obviously<br />
that investment as it occurred added to our debt problem.<br />
Obviously it added to our debt problem. But the basic<br />
thing is it's improved Australia's productive capacity<br />
and as such it's reduced and enhanced our ability to<br />
repay and to reduce foreign borrowings in the future.<br />
Now obviously in this respect if you're looking about<br />
trends, what this Government has done has been of<br />
fundamental importance in reducing the call by the public<br />
sector on the savings of this country. You ought to<br />
understand the magnitude of that achievement. It's been<br />
unparalleled. What we've done is succeeded in turning<br />
around a public sector borrowing requirement of over<br />
seven per cent of GDP in 1983-84. That's what it was<br />
the public sector borrowing requirement to the<br />
situation where again now we have a zero public sector<br />
borrowing requirement. Now obviously that represents<br />
with a GDP now of $ 400 billion, that turnaround of 7.1%<br />
represents a reduction of $ 28 billion in the call by the<br />
public sector on the savings of this country. So if<br />
you're talking about trends. and. what's happening in<br />
fundamentals in regard to our debt, that's the great<br />
contribution which this Government has made with the<br />
co-operation of the community. It simply means that by<br />
the massive surpluses that we've created, and it's been a<br />
bloody hard job to create them, it's taken thousands and<br />
thousands of hours over these last seven years sitting in<br />
that damned Expenditure Review Committee examining line<br />
by line, department by department, making massive<br />
savings. But that's meant that we have ensured now that<br />
the public sector is now making no net call on national </p>
<p>savings. In the result we're now seeing the situation<br />
where we can say to you in this Budget that the current<br />
account deficit is being reduced by a full one per cent<br />
of the GDP. Obviously also as a result of these<br />
successive surpluses, and I remind you of what I said in<br />
the speech, that since comparable records have been kept,<br />
there have only been four occasions in which the<br />
Commonwealth has been in surplus and that's our last four<br />
years. As a result of that it's enabled a massive<br />
program of debt repayment as far as the Commonwealth is<br />
concerned, including as you'd appreciate, very<br />
substantial repayments of foreign currency denominated<br />
debt. That's what we've done. I ask you in those<br />
circumstances to look at the composition of Australia's<br />
overseas liabilities. This is the latest figures as at<br />
the 31st of March. The private sector, the private<br />
sector owed 64% of our debt. State governments owed 16%.<br />
Statutory authorities owed 25%. And the Commuonwealth<br />
Government is a net foreign currency creditor making a<br />
four per cent contribution, a negative four per cent<br />
contribution to debt. So those are the figues. If you<br />
want to look at the trend we have a situation now where<br />
the debt is, that's our net debt I'm talking about, at<br />
the 31st of March was $ 124.3 billion. That was 34.2% of<br />
GDP. That is a situation now which is the same as it was<br />
in September of 1986. In other words we haven't had a<br />
deterioration since then. Now my friends I don't give<br />
that answer, and rather long answer with any sense of<br />
complacency I can assure you. Because, as I said in my<br />
speech, we have the problems of inflation and of our<br />
external position but I do believe that we are showing<br />
now that we're moving into a position where we're getting<br />
that move to the balance we wanted. We've got to have a<br />
reduction in domestic demand. Gross national expenditure<br />
will be zero this year in terms of increase and the whole<br />
increase in our gross domestic product will come from net<br />
exports. And that's what this country's got to do.<br />
We've got to continue to do it for some time. So we<br />
shouldn't be complacent but we should recognise also,<br />
another factor which you will have heard myself and Paul<br />
Keating refer to and that is that in this period that<br />
we ' ye in office we've seen our Australian investment<br />
overseas grow to the order of $ 60 billion. Now if we<br />
hadn't done that, and that is going to be for the long<br />
term benefit of Australia, as it plugs in to the best<br />
developments overseas, if we hadn't had that our net debt<br />
position would have been at the order of $ 50 billion<br />
which is a -very . dif ferent f igure.. -So when you take all<br />
those things into account I think we have reason not for<br />
complacency but for a fairly considerable degree of<br />
confidence in the capacity of Australia to meet these<br />
problems, particularly as long as you continue to have a<br />
government which is going to do what no other government<br />
has done and that's keep on whacking out pretty<br />
significant surpluses for you.<br />
QUESTION: Prime Minister, the Government has done a<br />
great deal to discourage spending. Is there anything you </p>
<p>intend doing to encourage personal savings among<br />
Australians? PM: Well of course the most significant thing that we've<br />
done there and something that should've been done a long<br />
time ago is to encourage people in the field of<br />
superannuation. You don't want me to go into detail to<br />
all the changes that we've made. But when I mention<br />
superannuation look at the smile that comes over the face<br />
of my friend, Stewie Fowler, here. Look at it. I mean<br />
he beams as soon as I mention the word and so he should.<br />
Because what we've done is to, by specific decisions in<br />
the fiscal area, encouraged people to make provision for<br />
their own future and that's the single most important<br />
thing that any government could do. You know the sorts<br />
of figures that have now been talked about as to what<br />
that will mean in the generation of additional savings by<br />
the end of the We were talking in terms of hundreds<br />
of billions of dollars that are going to be accumulated<br />
as a result of these decisions. But we haven't confined<br />
ourselves to those sorts of decisions, as important as<br />
they are. We've also tried to persuade the trade union<br />
movement and employers that it makes a great deal of<br />
sense to channel a path of their claim upon the growing<br />
wealth of the community, not only in terms of payments<br />
for money wage increases but to do it by way of payments<br />
of superannuation. Now that has had the combined affect<br />
of being a significant part of increasing the savings of<br />
the community but also of itself reducing the demand that<br />
otherwise would've been made for wage increases which<br />
would've been inflationary and of itself been counter<br />
productive to savings. So there you have the basic<br />
contribution that this Government has made and which has<br />
never looked like being made by any other government<br />
before us very specific provisions in the field of<br />
taxation to encourage people to save and a redirection of<br />
the large measure of the thinking of the trade union<br />
movement to ensure that they think in terms of making<br />
their claims not just in a way which can add to inflation<br />
but which is more likely to have the long term benefit<br />
flowing from an addition to savings. Now those are the<br />
things that we've done, nothing ever looks like it's been<br />
done before and it's going to make a very significant<br />
difference through this last decade of this century and<br />
into the beginning of the next in marshalling the savings<br />
of the community.<br />
QUESTION: . Mr. Prime Minister,. we. can. certainly empathise<br />
with your problems and frustrations, sitting for hours<br />
and hours on the Expenditure Review Committee of your<br />
Government. You should try sitting on the expenditure<br />
review committee of our company. The question is please<br />
summarise the reasons why you believe it is not in<br />
Australia's long term interests to introduce a broadly<br />
based consumption tax.<br />
PM: Well I'll certainly be very pleased to answer that<br />
question. But may you first of all permit me a gentle </p>
<p>rejoinder to your lament about the problems you have in<br />
your company by saying this; that before you, at your<br />
company meeting, engage in your whatever period it is, a<br />
quarter of an hour or hour of lament, please go on your<br />
knees and thank my Government for what we've done for you<br />
because under this Government we have massively changed<br />
the distribution of national income from wages to<br />
profits. When we came to office company profits were<br />
down at an abysmally low about 11%. They peaked up at<br />
19% and they are now averaging, as you know, a figure far<br />
beyond anything you experienced before we came to office.<br />
Not surprising because the other side of that coin is of<br />
course that under the period of my Government non farm<br />
real unit labour costs have been reduced by 10.1%. So<br />
two sides of the one coin. What we've done is to<br />
persuade the trade union movement to exercise massive<br />
restraint, shift the share of national income from wages<br />
to profits which by and large the business community has<br />
then reflected into increased investment. So before you<br />
go into your lament period give us thanks for all that.<br />
Now is regard to the consumption tax, let me say that we<br />
have already ruled out a consumption tax and we see<br />
absolutely no reason to change our position. Let me make<br />
it quite clear as Paul did in the House today. We were<br />
contemplating and seriously contemplating back in 1985<br />
but the whole tax structure has changed since then. The<br />
business community in its " wisdom" in 1985 used its best<br />
endeavours and here again Stewart's sort of shuddering<br />
a bit because he knows some of the background to it but<br />
the business community in its infinite wisdom at the tax<br />
summit in 1985 put its thumbs down on a consumption tax<br />
and INTERJECTOR: Fools.<br />
PM: They may have been fools but nevertheless the<br />
business community's representatives said no to a<br />
consumption tax at the tax summit in 1985. So if you've<br />
got any concern about there not being one where it<br />
would've been appropriate to bring it in, you talk to the<br />
representatives of the business community who gave it its<br />
thumbs down in 1985. So having been in a position where<br />
the trade union didn't want it, the representatives of<br />
the welfare community didn't want it, the trade unions<br />
didn't want it, we then went about a fundamental<br />
restructuring of the tax system and we now have a quite<br />
different position in 1990 from that in which it was<br />
sensible-o-. contemplate-the-~. consumption tax-in 1985. Now<br />
there were obviously very many difficulties in ensuring<br />
that low income earners and those on fixed incomes would<br />
be adequately protected. Indeed the best estimates that<br />
are available from our official sources are that if you<br />
were to bring in the consumption tax rate of 15% that Mr<br />
Reith he's the Shadow Treasurer that he's been<br />
talking about he's a special I can tell you, he's a<br />
special. You talk about 15% consumption tax and you<br />
brought that in, it would be at a cost to revenue after<br />
you're given full compensation of some $ 3B or $ 4B at </p>
<p>least. That would be the cost, the nett cost. In<br />
addition to that, of course, look at what would happen to<br />
inflation. You would have a very significant boost of<br />
probably something like 10 percentage points to<br />
inflation. Now my friend, the Leader of the Opposition,<br />
with the language that could only come from a rather<br />
naive academic, said that would raise the price level but<br />
it wouldn't increase inflation. Well this is a nonsense<br />
because of course the very fact of that very significant<br />
increase at that point of time would be fed into the<br />
wages level. We couldn't have a situation in 1985 in our<br />
discussions where the trade union movement would buy the<br />
proposition of discounting to that affect and a Liberal<br />
Government would never be able to get that agreement. So<br />
you'd have a massive increase in the price level which<br />
would then be fed into the inflation position of the<br />
country. You couldn't begin to contemplate the<br />
introduction of a consumption tax from the point of view<br />
of a Liberal Government where you didn't have a wages<br />
Spolicy. They have no wages policy and therefore a<br />
consumption tax would be a guarantee for a continuing<br />
boost to the inflation level in this country. So all<br />
those reasons are not something, I can assure you my<br />
friends, that are flippantly delivered. We seriously<br />
thought about it at a time when it was appropriate to<br />
consider it. The community, including the business<br />
community and significantly the business community, gave<br />
it the kybosh. So we have brought about a situation now<br />
where we have one of the most efficient and fairest tax<br />
systems in the world. As the Treasurer said in his<br />
Budget speech<br />
INTERJECTOR: inaudible<br />
PM: Well you get the ooh's and the aah's from the<br />
thoughtless. The fact is, as was said in the Budget<br />
speech, that according to the recently delivered OECD<br />
figures Australia has the third lowest taxation of all<br />
OECD countries. The only two countries which have a<br />
lower taxation regime are the United States and Turkey.<br />
It's not a bad performance and for all the reasons I've<br />
given it would be deleterious for the welfare of<br />
Australia now to introduce a consumption tax.<br />
QUESTION: The ACTU has just finished its executive<br />
meeting in Melbourne which endorsed an across the board<br />
approach of direct negotiations with employers to achieve<br />
the.-aims.-of-accord mark-6. In. a.. press conference a short<br />
time ago the ACTU President, Mr Martin Ferguson, said it<br />
was possible that the ACTU would not go through the<br />
Industrial Relations Commission at all. He described it<br />
as irrelevant. Do you support this type of direct<br />
negotiation? PM: Well I read what you say as reporting what Martin<br />
Ferguson has said. I would want to see and hear from<br />
Martin Ferguson precisely what he said because you will<br />
have noticed those of you who watched the television last </p>
<p>night that Martin Ferguson went out of his way to restate<br />
the commitment of the ACTU to the agreement that had been<br />
reached with the Government. Those were his very<br />
precise, specific, unarguable words that he used last<br />
night in his comments on the Budget. He said that they<br />
intended to adhere to their position and that's one which<br />
is enmeshed into and foundational to the Budget where we<br />
have predicated a 7% movement in earnings during 1991.<br />
So I would be very surprised therefore if either Martin<br />
Ferguson or the ACTU has in the next 24 hours changed<br />
that position. Now as to what they may be saying in some<br />
sort of negotiating phrase before the September meeting<br />
of the Industrial Relations Commission which has now<br />
been scheduled, I don't know. But my belief is that the<br />
ACTU and this is the important thing as far as the<br />
community is concerned will adhere to the commitment<br />
it's made to the Government of an aggregate wages outcome<br />
of 7% in this financial year. Now if they have some<br />
different view about whether that will be done in part by<br />
negotiation and part by the Commission, I'm not aware.<br />
But the important thing, the foundationally important<br />
thing as far as I'm concerned is that they retain a<br />
commitment to that aggregate wages outcome because it's<br />
that which is relevant to proper macro economic<br />
management. QUESTION: Mr Hawke, you have spoken a lot tonight about<br />
the discussions in regard to the telecommunications<br />
industry or that are forthcoming. Our question is will<br />
the outcome of the forthcoming debate about the form of<br />
the telecommunications industry play an important part in<br />
determining who is your successor as Prime Minister?<br />
PM: Well I'm very thrilled to see, and I hope you<br />
understand the important implication of your question<br />
and it is this that we will win the next federal<br />
election. I thank you for the confidence that you repose<br />
in me because we will, I believe, win the next election<br />
as we deserve to. Now that is the point at which the<br />
question of my successor will arise and I don't want to<br />
contemplate on that, you know what my thoughts about it<br />
are. The question of a successor will not arise before<br />
the next election so what our friend here, Michael Davis<br />
from Merrill Lynch International Australia Limited, is<br />
telling you so it's a good tip, you ought to get your<br />
money on ALP is going to win next federal election.<br />
That's the headline that should come out of tonight. Now<br />
as to what will happen in that very important debate, I<br />
can't say with precision. I addressed it in my speech<br />
but I do believe that the Party will understand that<br />
there has to be change. In the process of that debate,<br />
Michael, and in the processes leading up to the<br />
conference there will be a pretty vigorous exchange of<br />
views and some of the people who in some later years will<br />
be appropriately considered for the leadership of the<br />
Party, will play a part in that debate. Obviously the<br />
man most likely to succeed me after the next election is<br />
Paul Keating, he'll be involved in the debate. Another </p>
<p>young man with ability who could be properly considered<br />
down the line, Kim Beazley, he'll have a pretty important<br />
part to play and<br />
INTERJECTOR: inaudible<br />
PM: Well that's enough. You see we have a problem in<br />
the Labor Party and so do the Libs, but it's a different<br />
problem. Our problem is the great spread of talent. The<br />
Labor Party is going to be in the very fortunate position<br />
of having to choose, after my humble performance, they<br />
will have to choose and they will have Paul there to<br />
choose then they'll have a great range of talent from<br />
which to choose after that. The Libs have got a<br />
different problem, a paucity of talent.<br />
QUESTION: Prime Minister, I realise you said in your<br />
speech earlier that the $ 8.1B surplus was, in your words,<br />
already used and I noticed that in answer to questions<br />
during the question time that you've been pretty<br />
confident about a 7% aggregate outcome on wages. But I<br />
wonder whether you think there might be some opportunity<br />
for using that surplus to perhaps extend tax cuts as part<br />
of an accord mark 7 if the situation in the Gulf<br />
worsens and oil prices make their way into the CPI and<br />
make life difficult between yourselves and the unions.<br />
PM: Well let me be very precise in answering this<br />
question because I know that if I'm not careful in what I<br />
say that headlines will be there of Hawke promising tax<br />
cuts or something like that. I preface my reply, Gerry,<br />
by saying this; if there's one thing that's characterised<br />
political and economic commentary over the last 7-1/ 2<br />
years it's the continuing pronouncement of the imminent<br />
demise of the accord. No body or institution has been so<br />
continuously sentenced to an imminent death as has the<br />
accord. That began in February of 1983 when it was said<br />
that the accord was simply a stunt to help Hawke win the<br />
election, that he went to the Trades Hall Council in<br />
Melbourne there in the campaign, cooked up the accord and<br />
once he won it would be dead. And from February ' 83<br />
they've continued to announce its imminent demise. The<br />
fact is, as you know, Gerry, very well from your<br />
background that the accord has been a remarkably flexible<br />
instrument and that has been because of two things.<br />
Firstly, we have in this country a remarkably responsible<br />
trade union leadership. Vide these things; one I've<br />
already mentioned, a 10.1% reductionin non farm real<br />
unit labour costs, which has led point two, to the<br />
creation of 1.6 million new jobs, the overwhelming<br />
proportion of them in the private sector and point three<br />
which has led to a more than 50% reduction in industrial<br />
disputes. There is the proof. It's not an opinion,<br />
ladies and gentlemen, there is the proof, the irrefutable<br />
proof of the responsibility of the trade union movement.<br />
That has been matched and has only been possible because<br />
we've had a corresponding responsibility on the part of<br />
the Government. What the essence of the accord and </p>
<p>there's been books and volumes written about it but<br />
it's extremely simple, the concept of the accord. It is<br />
this; that there is a mutual right of those who employ<br />
and those who are employed to improve their real<br />
position. Employers have a legitimate right to seek to<br />
improve their profits with a view to be able to expand<br />
their business and those representing working men and<br />
women have a legitimate right to maintain and through<br />
time to improve their real standards of living. What<br />
follows from that is that the accord says well let's see<br />
what are the most economically responsible ways of<br />
meeting those dual legitimate objectives. There is a<br />
belief on the part of the trade union movement and of the<br />
Government that it makes more sense for the Government,<br />
as far as it can, to pick up a share of meeting that<br />
desire for an improved standard of living through the<br />
social wage so that there will be a lesser impact upon<br />
employers in meeting that aspiration of the workers<br />
through increases in money wages. Now that's the guts,<br />
the very basic principle of the accord. And so it has<br />
worked that the Government, by significant increases in<br />
the social wage which my friends, without being<br />
exhaustive had been reflected in massive increases in<br />
real terms in education. A situation where now after 7-<br />
1/ 2 years of my Government two out of three of our kids<br />
stay on in the education system instead of one in three<br />
when I came to power, massive increases in social welfare<br />
to those most in need at the lower income families. By<br />
those increases in the social wage the trade unions have<br />
been prepared to take a lesser increase in money wages.<br />
That has involved, as I said earlier, this very<br />
substantial transference in national income shares from<br />
wages to profits. The trade unions have been prepared to<br />
accept that because they've had the increase in the<br />
social wage. So that's been the dominant feature which<br />
has allowed us to create 1.6 million new jobs which means<br />
that now Government is able to manage a lowering of<br />
demand without falling over into recession because that<br />
restraint has given a resiliency in the labour market<br />
that under every previous Government had been lacking.<br />
Now you will see the relevance of that background to your<br />
question because we've demonstrated between us, the trade<br />
union movement and the Government, a capacity to adjust<br />
to changing circumstances. Circumstances which on the<br />
one hand have seen a massive decline in the terms of<br />
trade with all the associated problems of macro economic<br />
management that go with that and then the problems that<br />
come-. paradoxically. with-a massive improvement in the<br />
terms of trade. But in our negotiations with the trade<br />
union movement we've dealt with these things. There's<br />
been a number of instruments and methods that we have<br />
used to be adaptable and flexible. Without being<br />
exhaustive then they have meant some preparedness at<br />
times on the part of the trade union movement to delay<br />
the timing of wage increases. Other times there has been<br />
the preparedness to substitute tax cuts, which was the<br />
direct part of your question. There has been a<br />
preparedness to accept tax cuts. So my point in answer </p>
<p>4, 11<br />
to your question is this, Gerry. On the basis of our<br />
record over 7-1/ 2 years looking at both the principle<br />
of the accord and the practice of the accord you are<br />
entitled to expect that the trade union movement and the<br />
Government will be able on the basis of that principle<br />
and that practice to deal with any problem that may<br />
arise. I believe that I'm entitled to the confidence of<br />
the community on the basis of that record.<br />
