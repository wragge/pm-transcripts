    <content><![CDATA[<p>Today the Government is moving urgently to commence the process of listing the murderous Boko Haram group as a terrorist organisation.</p>
<p>The kidnapping of more than 200 schoolgirls in Nigeria by Boko Haram has caused revulsion and indignation around the world. Boko Haram is also reportedly responsible for the deaths of more than 300 people in north-east Nigeria.</p>
<p>The deadly activities of Boko Haram are a salutary reminder that global terrorism remains a serious threat to our security as well as an affront to our values as a nation.</p>
<p>Consistent with normal processes, and based on advice from Australiaâs intelligence and security agencies, the Commonwealth will be consulting expeditiously with relevant stakeholders including the states and territories with a view to finalising a listing under the Criminal Code as soon as practicable.</p>
<p>Terrorist organisation offences carry penalties of up to 25 yearsâ imprisonment.</p>
<p>In banning Boko Haram as a terrorist organisation, Australia will be acting consistently with Nigeria and also with our international partners including the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada and New Zealand.</p>
<p>The Government is firmly committed to maintaining our national security and upholding our values.</p>
