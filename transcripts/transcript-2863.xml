THE PROGRESS OF QUEENSLAND<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
THE HON. E. G. WHITLAM, M. P.,<br />
AT THE OPENING OF THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT CENTRE,<br />
ANN STREET, BRISBANE, FRIDAY 23 MARCH 1973<br />
This is my first visit to Queensland since<br />
my Government took office. It is a happy occasion for me.<br />
It has also provided me with my first opportunity as<br />
Prime Minister to talk to the Queensland Premier and his<br />
Ministers. This, too, has been personally gratifying.<br />
Our talks have been no less cordial for being overdue, and<br />
I thank Mr. Bjelke-Petersen for his invitation to meet him.<br />
I trust that no one will detect any sinister symbolism in the<br />
fact that my first official duty here is to open new offices<br />
for the national Government. This splendid building should<br />
be regarded in no sense as a foreign mission. Contrary to what<br />
some people are saying, Queensland is still part of Australia.<br />
My Government's interests and Australia's interests are one and<br />
indissoluble, and for my part we are determined to work together<br />
to advance them. My Government's commitment to the welfare and<br />
progress of Queensland is both general and specific. It is<br />
based on two great themes. There is first our general commitment<br />
to the cities. In Queensland 60 per cent of the people live in<br />
Brisbane and its suburbs. It is in these areas that my<br />
Government's attack on the problems of land and housing costs,<br />
schools opportunities, hospitals, public transport, unemployment,<br />
migrant welfare and access to community resources for recreation,<br />
sport and culture are principally directed. We have already<br />
established a Department of Urban and Regional Development to<br />
co-ordinate our work of rebuilding and regenerating our cities.<br />
Queensland will share in that process. The related task of<br />
bringing new standards of social welfare to the people a<br />
fundamental theme of all Labor governments has been entrusted<br />
to our new Department of Social Security. I remind you that<br />
this Department is headed by a Queenslander, my colleague<br />
Bill Hayden. / 2 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
The second part of my Government's commitment to<br />
Queensland is a specific one. It is in our policies for<br />
northern development. That Department is also headed by a<br />
Queensland Minister, Dr. Rex Patterson. It is our aim, in<br />
co-operation with the Government of Queensland, to develop<br />
the vast and valuable resources of northern Australia for<br />
the benefit of the Australian people. It is in the north<br />
that the great sugar and cattle industries and much of our<br />
mineral industries have been established. It is in the north<br />
that Australians face their greatest challenge in retaining<br />
the ownership of the nation's resources and developing new<br />
industries under Australian control.<br />
My Government has made one other specific pledge<br />
to the Queensland people. We have undertaken that one of our<br />
two main initiatives in regional development will be concentrated<br />
in Townsville. I said last year in my policy speech that the<br />
national Government was already responsible for decisions which<br />
have determined the growth and the burdens of Townsville<br />
more than any other Australian city except Canberra itself.<br />
What is being done for Albury-Wodonga in the southern States<br />
can be done for Townsville and other centres in Queensland.<br />
Albury-Wodonga is one of the best examples to<br />
date of what fruitful collaboration between the States and the<br />
new national Government can achieve. It is the sort of<br />
co-operation we must foster and preserve. My meeting with<br />
Mr. Hamer and Sir Robert Askin on 25 January was the first time<br />
the Governments of the two oldest States had come together-with<br />
the Commonwealth to plan the development of a new city.<br />
I trust that with similar co-operation in Queensland the<br />
prospects for the future growth and prosperity of Townsville<br />
will be as bright as those for Albury-Wodonga.<br />
As one instance of my Government's determination<br />
to give greater importance and prestige to Townsville, we have<br />
undertaken that Townsville will be made an international airport.<br />
Townsville, the gateway to the Barrier Reef, is vital to our<br />
developing tourist industry. It is vital to Australia as a whole.<br />
There has been one other notable example since my<br />
Government took office of what co-operation between the States<br />
and the national Government can achieve in the interests of all.<br />
Early this month, I met the Premiers of New South Wales, South<br />
Australia and Victoria to discuss the future use of the waters<br />
of the River Murray. This meeting was called on the initiative of<br />
one of the States South Australia. Its results will be<br />
largely to the benefit of that State. I believe the measures<br />
which will flow from that meeting will improve the quantity and<br />
quality ' of the waters of the Murray available to South Australia.<br />
I am proud that my Government, through its participation in that<br />
meeting, will help bring these benefits to that State, and I hope<br />
that through similar co-operative ventures we will bring similar<br />
benefits to the people of Queensland. / 3 </p>
<p>-3-<br />
Since My Government took office I have made<br />
numerous offers to the State Governments, including Queensland,<br />
to assist them with local and regional problems common to all<br />
of us. One of these was an attempt to control the soaring prices<br />
of land and housing, which are denying a decent home to thousands<br />
of Australian families. My Government proposes to set up Land<br />
Development Commissions to acquire and make available residential<br />
land on reasonable terms. I have Vritten . to all the Premiers<br />
proposifigi action on these lines.<br />
I have also written to the Premiers offering-special<br />
grants to overcome the backlog in sewerage services in the principal<br />
cities. I have written to them outlining the terms of my Government's<br />
offer to take over the uneconomic State railway services which im~ pose<br />
crippling financial burdens on all State Governments. My Government<br />
has offered the States additional funds totalling $ 52 million for<br />
unemployment relief works of which Queensland's share was<br />
$ 5.6 million. We have approved for Queensland an extra $ 5,124,000<br />
from the $ 27.5 million increase in the borrowing program for the<br />
States' local and semi-governmental authorities.<br />
Our most recent action was my Cabinet's decision this<br />
week to amend the Commonwealth Grants Commission Act to allow us to<br />
make special grants to the States for local government. This is<br />
in line with our policy of allowing local Government full participation<br />
in, and access to, the fund-raising processes of this country.<br />
I am confident that in all these initiatives we will<br />
receive the ready co-operation of the States. I am confident that<br />
the people will not be side-tracked and hood-winked by specious<br />
slogans about centralism and States rights. What our opponents<br />
like to call centralism is the overdue recognition by the national<br />
Government of-its responsibilities in areas which that Government<br />
alone can discharge. our responsibility is t6 ensure Viable<br />
and efficient local government. Local government in this city<br />
happens to be the most efficient and progressive system of local<br />
government in Australia.<br />
I It is efficient and progressive because it is<br />
organised on broad regional lines. It is, if you like, the most<br />
distinctive example of centralism in Australia. Similarly, when<br />
we talk of States rights, let us remember that the rights of people<br />
are more important that tne rights of Governments. My Government<br />
emphasises people's rights their rights to a decent home, to a<br />
modern transport service, to a full education, to a pleasing and<br />
unpolluted neighbourhood, to an equal share in life's opportunities<br />
for recreation, leisure and cultural fulfilment. These are the<br />
rights we hold paramount.<br />
I pay tribute to all those who planned and built<br />
this new Government centre. It will provide a link between<br />
Governments and people. I hope it will be seen as a symbol of the<br />
co-operative spirit that must prevail between Queensland and the<br />
Australian Government. The true progress of our people depends on this<br />
co-operation. There is much that our Governments can do alone; there<br />
is much more they can do together. The greatest enemy of progress,<br />
development and efficiency in our country has been the old-fashioned,<br />
discredited rivalry that has prevailed between States and between<br />
centres within the States. Queensland in many ways is the State<br />
which has best managed to suppress these rivalries. It is in many<br />
ways the proudest and most individualistic of States. Despite its<br />
enormous size it has a unique cohesion and corporate pride. </p>
<p>-4-<br />
It is of all States the least urbanised, the<br />
most decentralised, the most diverse in its climatic conditions<br />
and natural resources. I make this earnest appeal to you all:<br />
Let us work together in co-operation and good will for a<br />
greater and more prosperous Queensland in a greater and more<br />
prosperous Australia. It will be a tragedy for the Queensland people<br />
if local jealousy, parochial sentiment and intolerant suspicion<br />
are allowed to stand in the way of Queensland's progress.<br />
I offer a lasting contract of mutual goodwill and shared<br />
purpose between our Governments. Our ultimate interests<br />
are the same, and I am sure that our common aims will be<br />
approved by the people of your great State and by your<br />
fellow Australians.<br />
