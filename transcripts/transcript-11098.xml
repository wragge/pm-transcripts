<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>It's Marvelous. It's a real sort of , you sort of wallow</p>
<p> in history going through all of that.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>With the full sale of Telstra would this complex be doubled?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>You'd be much better off with the full sale of Telstra.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>If the sale goes through tonight, when can we expect the whole thing</p>
<p> to get going?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>That really is a matter for the market. But it'll be done as</p>
<p> soon as is appropriate, and we'll have less debt and we'll</p>
<p> have more happy shareholders.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>So as early as October?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I don't want to put a time on it. I think it's a matter</p>
<p> for the market.</p>
