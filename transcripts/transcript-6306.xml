PRIME MINISTER<br />
ADDRESS BY THE PRIME MINISTER, HON. R. J. L. HAWKE, AC, MP<br />
DINNER GIVEN BY THE PRIME MINISTER FOR THE JAPANESE<br />
PRIME MINISTER, MR NAKASONE<br />
IMPERIAL HOTEL<br />
TOKYO 2 FEBRUARY<br />
MR PRIME MINISTER, MRS NAKASONE, MR PRESIDENT, MR SPEAKER,<br />
MEMBERS OF THE DIET, DISTINGUISHED GUESTS, LADIES AND GENTLEMENT.<br />
MAY I THANK YOU AGAIN MR PRIME MINISTER, AND MEMBERS OF YOUR<br />
CABINET, FOR THE WELCOME YOU HAVE EXTENDED TO ME WHILE I HAVE<br />
BEEN IN TOKYO.<br />
MAY I ALSO EXPRESS, ON BEHALF OF MRS HAWKE AND MYSELF, OUR PLEASURE<br />
AND HONOUR AT HAVING LUNCHEON TODAY AS GUESTS OF HIS IMPERIAL<br />
HIGHNESS, THE EMPEROR OF JAPAN. WE TAKE THIS AS AN EXPRESSION OF<br />
F: RIENDSHIP ADDRESSED TO THE PEOPLE OF AUSTRALIA BY THE PEOPLE OF<br />
JAPAN. WE KNOW THAT IT ALSO REFLECTS THE PERSONAL INTEREST AND<br />
FRIENDSHIP OF THE IMPERIAL FAMILY FOR AUSTRALIA.<br />
THE DISCUSSIONS WE HAVE HELD HERE IN TOKYO HAVE REAFFIRMED ME<br />
IN MY CONVICTION THAT THERE IS A VERY GOOD, VERY SOLID AND VERY<br />
CLOSE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN OUR TWO COUNTRIES.<br />
AS ONE WHO IS NO STRANGER TO AUSTRALIA YOU WOULD KNOW, MR PRIME<br />
MINISTERP THAT ' AUSTRALIANS SPEND MUCH TIME REVIEWING THE<br />
RELATIONSHI1P WITH JAPAN. POLITICIANS DO IT, OUR BUEAUCRATIC<br />
ADVISERS DO IT, AND NEED I SAY JOURNALISTS DO IT. I THINK<br />
THE SAME HAPPENS IN JAPAN. WE ASK THE QUESTIONS: DOES JAPAN<br />
UNDERSTAND AND DOES JAPAN CARE ABOUT AUSTRALIA AND ABOUT AUSTRALIAJAPAN<br />
RELATIONS? FROM OUR DISCUSSIONS I BELIEVE THE ANSWER IS YES.<br />
THIS IS A POLITICAL COMMITMENT THAT WE EACH SHARE AND VALUE.<br />
AT THE SAME TIME IT IS A COMMITMENT THAT WE AGREE REQUIRES<br />
CONTINUING WORK TO BE SUSTAINED AND TO GROW AS IT SHOULD.<br />
I AM REMINDED OF THE I ' EUCALYPTUS SOLUTION' YOU PROPOSED LAST<br />
NIGHT. MR PRIME MINISTER, IT WAS NEARLY TWELVE YEARS AGO THAT YOU<br />
BROUGHT EUCALYPTUS SEEDS FROM AUSTRALIA TO YOUR VILLA HERE IN JAPAN.<br />
YOU HAVE NURTURED THEM AND SEEN THEM GROW INTO STRONG STURDY TREES.<br />
OVER A SOMEWHAT LONGER PERIOD THE AUSTRALIA/ JAPAN RELATIONSHIP<br />
HAS SIMILARLY GROWN AND MATURED. NOW PERHAPS, WITH KOALAS COMING<br />
TO JAPAN, WE NEED TO BE CAREFUL THEY DO NOT GET AT YOUR TREES<br />
THEY LOVE GOOD EUCALYPTS BUT INSTEAD CONTRIBUTE POSITIVELY TO THE<br />
DEVEiLOPMENT OF RELATIONS BETWEEN OUR COUNTRIES. </p>
<p>2.<br />
EITHER WAY, THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN OUR TWO COUNTRIES<br />
SHOULD NOT BE TAKEN FOR GRANTED IT MUST BE WORKED ON.<br />
M1R PRIME MINISTER,<br />
TrHE INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC SITUATIONS ARE AT<br />
A CRITICAL JUNCTURE.<br />
IN INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL AFFAIRS THERE ARE MANY REGIONAL<br />
' TENSIONS AND CONFLICTS. AT GLOBAL STRATEGIC LEVEL A SENSE<br />
OF EXASPERATION AND DEEP CONCERN AFFECTS US ALL.<br />
IN ECONOMIC AFFAIRS WE ARE AT A CRUCIAL STAGE OF RECOVERY.<br />
IN BOTH SPHERES, WE NEED TO APPROACH THE FUTURE WITH A DETERMINATION<br />
q'OT ONLY TO DEFEND OUR NATIONAL INTERESTS, BUT ALSO TO GRASP<br />
OPPORTUNITIES FOR DIALOGUE AND THE CONSTRUCTION OF NEW FRAMEWORKS FOR<br />
PEACE AND PROSPERITY.<br />
IN THIS REGARD, MR PRIME MINISTER, I AM IMPRESSED BY THE MANNER IN<br />
W4HICH YOU ARE MAKING JAPAN'S VOICE HEARD IN WORLD AFFAIRS AUSTRALIA<br />
WELCOMES THIS.<br />
IN THE INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL AND SECURITY ARENA THERE IS SOMETIMES<br />
A DICHOTOMY OF CHOICE: TO STAND MILITANTLY AGAINST THE SOVIET UNION<br />
AND ITS ALLIES, OR TO CAPITULATE. THE REALITY MUST BE BETWEEN THESE<br />
' TWO STARK ALTERNATIVES.<br />
WE KNOW THAT YOUR OWN RELATIONS WITH THE SOVIET UNION HAVE<br />
FRENQUENTLY BEEN DIFFICULT AND VERY RARELY RELAXED OR PRODUCTIVE.<br />
JAPAN HAS NEVERTHELESS CONTINUED TO SEEK CONSTRUCTIVE DIALOGUE AND<br />
CO-OPERATION IN THE FACE OF SOVIET INFLEXIBILITY. AUSTRALIA TAKES A<br />
BROADLY SIMILAR APPROACH.<br />
THE CONSOLIDATION AND FURTHER EXTENSION OF SOVIET MILITARY POWER<br />
WITHIN THE ASIAN REGION, WHICH ALREADY FAR EXCEEDS NORMAL DEFENSIVE<br />
REQUIREMENTS, MUST BE A SOURCE OF CONTINUING CONCERN TO ALL OF US.<br />
WE RECOGNISE THAT JAPAN MAKES AN EFFECTIVE CONTRIBUTION TO WESTERN<br />
STRATEGIC INTERESTS THROUGH ITS SELF DEFENCE FORCES AND THE PROVISION<br />
OF BASES AND OTHER FACILITIES FOR THE UNITED STATES IN JAPAN, WITHIN<br />
THE FRAMEWORK OF YOUR MUTUAL SECURITY TREATY.<br />
I KNOW THAT THERE IS INTENSE PREOCCUPATION IN JAPAN ABOUT FUTURE<br />
DEFENCE AND SECURITY POLICY. I HAVE BEEN ASSURED, IN OUR<br />
DISCUSSIONS, THAT JAPAN WILL, WHEN EXERCISING ITS SOVEREIGN RIGHTS IN<br />
THIS AREA, CONTINUE TO MAKE A SUBSTANTIAL AND POSITIVE CONTRIBUTION<br />
TO REGIONAL STABILITY, PARTICULARLY THROUGH ECONOMIC ASSISTANCE, BUT<br />
ALSO THROUGH POLITICAL AND DIPLOMATIC ACTIVITY. THAT CONTRIBUTION,<br />
MADE AS I KNOW IT WILL BE WITH DUE CARE AND SENSITIVITY FOR THE<br />
INTERESTS OF COUNTRIES OF THE REGION, IS APPRECIATED.<br />
THE CAMBODIAN SITUATION, BROUGHT ABOUT BY THE VIETNAMESE INVASION<br />
WHICH AUSTRALIA AND JAPAN HAVE EACH CONDEMNED, CARRIES DISTURBING<br />
-IMPLICATIONS FOR PEACEFUL RELATIONS AMONG AI. L COUNTRIES OF OUR<br />
REGION. </p>
<p>WE BELIEVE THAT RESOLUTION OF THE SITUATION IN CAMBODIA REQUIRES<br />
THE FOLLOWING ELEMENTS:<br />
* A PHASED WITHDRAWAL LEADING TO TOTAL WITHDRAWAL OF<br />
VIETNAMESE TROOPS<br />
* AN ACT OF SEL-DETERMINATION BY THE CAMBODIAN PEOPLE<br />
* THE CREATION OF CONDITIONS WHICH WOULD<br />
PERMIT DISPLACED CAMBODIANS TO RETURN TO<br />
THEIR COUNTRY<br />
* THE EMERGENCE OF A FREE, INDEPENDENT AND<br />
NON-ALIGNED CAMBODIA.<br />
WE RECOGNISE THAT VIETNAM'S PRESENT POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC ISOLATION<br />
IS THE RESULT OF DELIBERATE AND CONSCIOUS ACTIO1NS UNDERTAKEN BY<br />
ITSELF. AUSTRALIA NEVERTHELESS ATTACHES CONSIDERABLE IMPORTANCE TO<br />
THE ENDING OF THAT ISOLATION AND THE ASSOCIATED GROWING RELIANCE ON<br />
THE SOVIET UNION WHICH IN OUR JUDGEMENT, IS SIMPLY ENTRENCHING GREAT<br />
POWER RIVALRY IN THE REGION.<br />
BECAUSE AUSTRALIA HAS AN ABILITY TO SPEAK TO ALL THE MAIN<br />
PROTAGONISTS IN THE INDO-CHINA PROBLEM THE ASEAN COUNTRIES, CHINA,<br />
THE UNITED STATES AND VIETNAM ITSELF WE WILL CONTINUE, WITHIN THE<br />
LIMITS OF OUR CAPACITY, TO DO WHAT WE CAN TO PROMOTE PROGRESS TOWARDS<br />
A SETTLEMENT.<br />
AS YOU KNOW I WILL SHORTLY BE VISITING CHINA AND I UNDERSTAND THAT<br />
YOU WILL ALSO IN MARCH. IT GIVES US GREAT CONFIDENCE TH4AT RELATIONS<br />
BETWEEN CHINA AND JAPAN AND THE UNITED STATES HAVE MADE SO MUCH<br />
PROGRESS IN RECENT YEARS. THE HIGH LEVEL VISITS BETWEEN CHINA AND<br />
JAPAN, CULMINATING IN THE VISIT HERE LAST YEAR OF SECRETARY GENERAL<br />
HU YAOBANG, MARK AN IMPORTANT AND MUTUALLY RESPECTFUL RELATIONSHIP<br />
BETWEEN TWO GREAT ASIAN COUNTRIES. THE HIGH LEVEL. VISITS BETWEEN<br />
CHINA AND THE UNITED STATES, ORIGINALLY THAT OF MR DENG AND NOW THAT<br />
OF MR ZHAO AND MR REAGAN, CARRY THE PROMISE OF GREATER STABILITY AND<br />
UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN TWO VITALLY IMPORTANT MAJOR POWERS.<br />
WE ALL HAVE A CLOSE INTEREST IN CONTINUED PROGRESS IN THESE CONTACTS.<br />
THERE ARE ALSO A NUMBER OF MAJOR ECONOMIC CHALLENGES WE ALL FACE.<br />
AS WE ENTER 1984i THERE ARE GROUNDS FOR OPTIMISM THAT THE ECONOMIC<br />
RECOVERY WHICH COMMENCED IN THE UNITED STATES LAST YEAR WILL CONTINUE<br />
AND WILL STIMULATE A RETURN TO GROWTH IN OTHER REGIONS. IT IS VITAL<br />
THAT THE OPPORTUNITIES PRESENTED BY THE RECOVERY ARE NOT LOST.,<br />
INFLATION FOR THE MOMENT. HAS MODERATED BUT THE ECONOMIC UPTURN HAS<br />
YET TO MAKE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON UNEMPLOYMENT IN MOST COUNTRIES<br />
OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. IT IS MY VIEW THAT THE SUCCESS OF THE<br />
RECOVERY MUST ULTIMATELY BE JUDGED BY ITS IMPACT ON EMPLOYMENT AS<br />
WELL AS IN TERMS OF INCREASED TOTAL OUTPUT.<br />
OPTIMISM ABOUT THE COURSE OF THE RECOVERY MUST BE TEMPERED, HOWEVER,<br />
BY THE REAL CONCERNS GENERATED BY LARGE BUDGET DEFICITS, CONTINUING<br />
HIGH REAL INTEREST RATES, PROTECTIONISM AND RESISTANCE TO STRUCTURAL<br />
CHANGE, THE DEBT PROBLEMS OF MANY DEVELOPING COUNTRIES, AND VOLATILE<br />
EXCHANGE FLOWS, THIS LIST IS LONG AND THE ISSUES ARE INTER-CONNECTED. </p>
<p>THE SOLUTION TO THESE PROBLEMS DOES NOT LIE WITHIN THE CAPACITY OR<br />
CONTROL OF ANY ONE COUNTRY. IT REQUIRES A MIX OF APPROPRIATE<br />
DOMESTIC POLICIES AND CO-OPERATIVE APPROACHES AT BOTH THE REGIONAL<br />
AND GLOBAL LEVEL.<br />
AUSTRALIA AND JAPAN SHARE A KEEN INTEREST IN THE MAINTENANCE OF<br />
AN OPEN INTERNATIONAL TRADE SYSTEM.<br />
WE SHARE THE VIEW THAT SIGNIFICANT, SUSTAINABLE AND BROADLY BASED<br />
ECONOMIC RECOVERY IS DEPENDENT UPON AN EXPANSION IN WORLD TRADE.<br />
THERE IS AN URGENT NEED TO EXPLORE WAYS OF REDUCING OBSTACLES IN<br />
THE PATH OF SUCH AN EXPANSION.<br />
FULL AND EFFECTIVE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PROGRAM AGREED AT THE 1982<br />
GATT MINISTERIAL MEETING IS AN ESSENTIAL FIRST STEP. A NEW ROUND OF<br />
MULTILATERAL TRADE NEGOTIATIONS, AS PROPOSED MOST NOTABLY BY YOU, MR<br />
PRIME MINISTER, COULD BE AN INVALUABLE FURTHER STEP.<br />
I PROPOSED IN A SPEECH IN BANGKOK LAST NOVEMBER THAT WE AS A REGION<br />
CONSIDER HOW WE MIGHT BEST APPROACH PREPARATIONS FOR SUCH<br />
NEGOTIATIONS. I SAID AT THAT TIME THAT THE CHANCES FOR SUCH<br />
NEGOTIATIONS. I SAID AT THAT TIME THAT TH4E CHANCES OF ACHIEVING AN<br />
APPROPRIATELY STRUCTURED ROUND OF NEGOTIATIONS WOULD BE GREATLY<br />
ENHANCED IF COUNTRIES OF THE REGION WERE DELIBERATELY TO IDENTIFY<br />
THEIR OWN INTERESTS IN SUCH A ROUND, WERE TO CONSIDER HOW BEST TO<br />
SECURE ATTENTION TO THEIR INTERESTS, AND WERE TO APPLY THEIR FULL AND<br />
UNITED WEIGHT TO THEIR ACHIEVEMENT.<br />
I STRONGLY BELIEVE THAT WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO ENHANCE THE PROSPECTS<br />
OF BROAD MULTILATERAL ACTION AND THUS CONTRIBUTE IMPORTANTLY TO<br />
GLOBAL ECONOMIC WELFARE THROUGH CONSTRUCTIVE REGIONAL CO-OPERATION.<br />
I DO NOT WANT, OF COURSE, TO UNDERSTATE THE DIFFICULTIES INVOLVED.<br />
OUR SPECIAL INTERESTS ARE DIVERSE.<br />
THE DYNAMISM OF THE MARKET ECONOMIES OF THIS REGION, HOWEVER, HINGES<br />
ON A COMMON APPRECIATION OF THE IMPORTANCE OF TRADE LIBERALISATION.<br />
FOLLOWING MY TALKS HERE IN TOKYO, MR PRIME MINISTER, I AM CONVINCED<br />
THAT SCOPE EXISTS FOR US TO CO-OPERATE CLOSELY WITH EACH4 OTHER AND<br />
WITH OTHER COUNTRIES IN OUR REGION IN PREPARATIONS FOR A NEW TRADE<br />
ROUND IN A MANNER THAT COULD RESULT IN BENEFITS TO US ALL.<br />
I KNOW YOU SHARE THIS CONVICTION.<br />
TO LEAVE TOKYO WITH THIS IMPRESSION ALONE WOULD HAVE JUSTIFIED MY<br />
VISIT. BUT, MR PRIME MINISTER, THIS HAS BEEN ONLY ONE ASPECT OF AN IMMENSELY<br />
SATISFYING FEW DAYS.<br />
I THINK IT ALSO IMPORTANT THAT WE HAVE MANAGED SO CLEARLY TO<br />
ESTABLISH WHERE OUR COMMON INTERESTS LIE, AND ON THIS BASIS TO<br />
HAVE IDENTIFIED FURTHER FIELDS FOR CO-OPERATIVE ENDEAVOUR BETWEEN OUR<br />
TWO COUNTRIES.<br />
A GOOD START HAS BEEN MADE IN REVITALISING THE IMMENSELY IMPORTANT<br />
AUSTRALIA/ JAPAN RELATIONSHIP.<br />
I WOULD VERY MUCH HOPE MR PRIME MINISTER THAT BEFORE VERY LONG<br />
YOU WOULD BE ABLE TO VISIT US IN AUSTRALIA TO CARRY FURTHER WHAT<br />
WE HAVE BEGUN HERE SO SUCCESSFULLY. </p>
