    <content><![CDATA[<p>10 June 2004</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p> Mr Howard, the State Government says it's not going to put money into this project until 2008.  Is the Federal Government going to remain true to its commitment if that's the case?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> Yes. This is a genuine commitment from the Federal Government and I've just heard Senator Campbell and Mrs MacTiernan on the radio and they seem to be in furious agreement. We've put our money on the table and the State Government I'm sure will cooperate and I hope it does because the public of Australia are fed up with blame shifting and the public of Australia want outcomes, they want roads, they want health improvements and they want State and Federal Governments to cooperate.  And we've cooperated, we've put the money on the table and it's there, it's genuine and the sooner the project can start the better.</p>
<p> JOURNALIST:</p>
<p> The State Government says the money for funding the roads would have been much better spent up in the (inaudible) where they really do need them for road works.</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> Oh so the State Government is against... I don't know which State Government you're talking about. I just heard the Roads Minister in Western Australia, MacTiernan.</p>
<p> JOURNALIST:</p>
<p> Alannah lMacTiernan was saying yesterday that the money that you've spent on AusLink for some of the places in the eastern states would have been better...</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> Well, we are all Australians. I mean, of course, you will get individual State Ministers always saying all the money should be spent in their state, but I have responsibilities to the whole of Australia, as does Senator Campbell, and this money out of AusLink for Western Australia is very good news and of course this particular Mandurah bypass is excellent news for this part of outer metropolitan Perth.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p> Prime Minister, just this morning there was a double fatality, two trucks collided on the Hume Highway near Gundagai. Is that an indication that this type of Commonwealth funding is sorely needed?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> Well, no amount of funding will abolish road fatalities. I think we have to recognise that. No matter how much money you spend on roads, there will still be some road fatalities. So, I think it's a bit unrealistic for anybody to think that you can abolish roads accidents by spending ever larger amounts on roads. What you can do is to make them safer, is to increase the number of lanes, and of course the whole purpose of a large part of AusLink is to increase investment in the very busy roads all over Australia, to do them in a fair way and to do them in a way where the Commonwealth does its share but also the states carry their share. Bear in mind that the states are all much better off now as a result of the GST. Western Australia has done very well out of the Grants Commission reallocation of money with the GST. It's their right and that's done by an independent body. But any extra money spent on roads will make them safer. But we have to be realistic to recognise that we're never going to be able to completely eliminate the human factor in road accidents and we have to be realistic about that.</p>
<p> JOURNALIST:</p>
<p> Prime Minister, do you see view Peter Garrett as a threat to the Liberal Party?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Sorry?</p>
<p> JOURNALIST:</p>
<p> Do you view Peter Garrett as a threat to the Liberal Party with Labor taking on his 'Green' credentials so to speak?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> No, I think people vote according to policies. I think people will have a look at the environmental policies of the two parties and then they'll make up their mind. They'll also have a look at the impact of extreme Green policies on economic development. You need balance in these areas. You don't want extreme Green attitudes because extreme Green attitudes are anti-investment and anti-jobs. It's not much good having a pristine environment in a bankrupt country.</p>
<p> JOURNALIST:</p>
<p> Given his voting history, this morning you questioned his passion for politics and for the country.</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> Well, questions have been raised and he's got to explain himself. And the point I was making this morning is plain that if he has not been on the roll and if he hasn't voted on the last three occasions - he's not very passionate about the political future of this country.</p>
<p> JOURNALIST:</p>
<p> Do you think his association with the Labor Party will translate nationally given that he is a national figure?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> I don't think so.</p>
<p> JOURNALIST:</p>
<p> So do you view Peter Garrett as a threat?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> No.</p>
<p> JOURNALIST:</p>
<p> (inaudible) sort of a one issue person?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> Well look, I don't know him very well and, you know, let the public work that out.</p>
<p> JOURNALIST:</p>
<p> Do you think he'll be a force in the party?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> Don't know, he hasn't joined my party.</p>
<p> JOURNALIST:</p>
<p> What do you think of having these types of celebrity...</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> Look, I'm not going to give a commentary on that. He's the Labor Party's problem.</p>
<p> JOURNALIST:</p>
<p> Mr Howard, Sev Ozdowski in his report of four weeks ago called for the release of children from immigration detention by today.  Is that something that the Government is still considering?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> Well, that matter is being considered and Amanda Vanstone will speak for the Government on the issue. Okay.</p>
