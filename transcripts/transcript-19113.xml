    <content><![CDATA[<p>Sydney</p>
<p>Today our nation mourns the loss of one of its premier business and philanthropic figures, James Strong AO.</p>
<p>Mr Strong led some of Australia's foremost companies including as CEO of Qantas, and Chairman of Woolworths and IAG, displaying remarkable vision and dynamism during a period of rapid economic change.</p>
<p>Mr Strong's impeccable sense of dress, manners and style marked him as a true gentleman, and he was widely admired as an accomplished public speaker.</p>
<p>Mr Strong brought his exceptional business skills to the benefit of the arts and sports sector, and drove reform in these sectors through his philanthropy and leadership.</p>
<p>He was a true champion for the arts over many years, most recently as Chairman of the Australia Council from 2006-2012, where he promoted innovative arts performances, exhibitions and festivals, and the need for stronger partnerships between government and the private sector.</p>
<p>Mr Strong also served as Chairman of the Sydney Theatre Company, the Australian Brandenburg Orchestra, the Australia Business Arts Foundation and the State Library of Victoria. In addition, he served as a director of Opera Australia, and chaired a review in 2005 which helped place our nation's orchestras on a more sustainable financial footing.</p>
<p>A proud advocate for motor sports, Mr Strong was Chair of V8 Supercars and a member of the Australian Grand Prix Corporation. In addition, as Chair of the ICC Cricket World Cup 2015 he worked passionately to ensure Australia and New Zealand will host the best ever Cricket World Cup in 2015.</p>
<p>He was also a member of the Anzac Centenary Advisory Board and made a significant contribution towards the planning and preparations for the 100th anniversary of the First World War.</p>
<p>With the death of James Strong, Australia has lost one of its most gifted corporate leaders who significantly enriched the life of our nation.</p>
<p>Our thoughts are with the Strong family on the passing of this great Australian.</p>
