ThE THIRD ADELAIDE FESTIVAL OF ARTS<br />
AT ADEL,. IDE, SOUTH Ai73TRdJIA<br />
Official Opening b_ the Prime Minister,_ the Rt., Hon. Sir Robert<br />
Menzies. K, CH; QC; MP.<br />
My Lord Mayor, Mr, Premier and Ladies and Gentlemen<br />
As her most inadequate substitute, I would like to<br />
read to you right away a message which 1er Majesty The Queen<br />
Mother invite d mo to convey to you on this lovely and memorable<br />
occasion. She says this:<br />
" As Patron of this, the Third Adelaide<br />
Festival of Arts, it is a great sorrow to me<br />
that I can't be with you today at this Opening<br />
Ceremony. I have learned with pleasure of<br />
the outstanding achievements of the two previous<br />
ventures. You may indeed look with pride on the<br />
results of your original idea, for the Adelaide<br />
Fcstival of Arts is no longer an experiment but<br />
an established feature in the cultural life of<br />
Australia with an ever-growing reputation<br />
oversea s.<br />
To all those who have been associated<br />
with this Third Festival I cffer my congratulations<br />
and my warmest good wishes for its success.<br />
S igned ELIZABETH REGINA."<br />
( Applause)<br />
Sir, I have stated that I was an inadequate<br />
substitute. I had a little to do originally with the proposed<br />
visit of Her Majesty because your Premier asked me on one of my<br />
visits to London to find out, a little delicately, and of course<br />
I am famous for my delicacy, whether there might be a favourable<br />
response to an invitation. All I can tell you is that the well<br />
known and lovely eyes of Her Majesty The Queen Mother lit up with<br />
pleasure at the very thought of it. I know that she is genuinely<br />
tremendously sorry not to be here. She was looking forward to it.<br />
All I can say, as His Excellency the Governor-General said the<br />
other day in his speech at the Opening of Parliament, is that all<br />
of us will regard her visit not as cancelled but as merely<br />
postponed. Her Majesty, I don't need to say to any of you has<br />
an assured place in our hearts. Long long ago in this country,<br />
she captivated the hearts of millions of people and they still<br />
have the warmest place in their memories of her. She also<br />
challenges the mind stimulates the imagination. She is really,<br />
if I may say so, with all humility one of the very great women<br />
of the century in her own right, ( Applause)<br />
She, herself, in the Message that I have just read<br />
to you, indicates one reason why she wanted to be here, Of course<br />
there is a second reason. She really has a very soft spot in her<br />
heart for Australia. She has now on at least two occasions, very<br />
happy memories of this country and of the people of this country<br />
and it is not to be wondered at becauso we, as a people, have<br />
always made it clear to her in what deep affection we hold her and<br />
this produces inevitably a feeling of warmth in her own heart, a<br />
feeling of pleasure in her own mind. She will indeed be desperately<br />
sorry not to be here. </p>
<p>-2-<br />
She mentioned that this Festival is an imaginative<br />
effort. It began this is the third occasion now it began no<br />
doubt as an experiment. It was enormously to the credit of<br />
Adelaide and its citizens that it was an experiment made not in<br />
the largest city in Australia but in a city which had imagination,<br />
some understanding of what the arts mean in the history of the<br />
country. Those who began it must have wondered, just as those<br />
who began the Edinburgh Festival wondered. Edinburgh is not the<br />
largest city in the United Kingdom; it is not the largest city<br />
in Scotland, but the Edinburgh Festival now has a name that rings<br />
around the world, one of the great artistic events, not only in<br />
the history of Edinburgh or in the history of Scotland but in the<br />
history of the modern world.<br />
And Sir I speak without exaggeration when I say<br />
that this Festival in Adelaide is not only unique in Australia,<br />
is not only becoming extremely famous in Australia but that it<br />
attracts world figures, world names in the fields of art in all<br />
its various manifestations. And therefore this Festival has made<br />
the name of Adelaide, the spirit of Adelaide, the imaginative<br />
understanding of Adelaide well known all over the English-speaking<br />
world and I have no doubt that by the time the sixth Festival has<br />
been organised and put on, it will have a fame that extends to<br />
every continent in the world.<br />
Now Sir, this is a wonderful thing for a city to<br />
achieve when it is not one of those cities with millions of people,<br />
with vast accumulated wealth, but a comparatively small city<br />
though the capital of a great State. And this, therefore, is<br />
a remarkable achievement. I hope that every person in South<br />
Australia has a just pride in it. I hope that we will all feel<br />
immensely gra-eful to the people who organised it, who have<br />
succeeded in the remarkable feat of bringing so many people from<br />
so many places. All I ask that you give to me is a slight<br />
suggestion of credit for the fact that whatever the other limitations<br />
on the powers of the Commonwealth may be, we have legislative<br />
authority over meteorology ( Laughter) and since I know that there<br />
would be some people who would blame us if it were raining today,<br />
all I ask is a humble meed of praise for the magnificent day that<br />
we have brought with us. ( Laughter) ( Applause)<br />
Sir, I myself am immensely sorry and so is my wife,<br />
She is even more sorry because she is what they call a balletomane.<br />
I am immensely sorry that we shall have to be away from here<br />
tomorrow, but so that you may understand some of the rigours of<br />
life from the point of view of a battered old Prime Minister, may<br />
I tell you that tomorrow night I have to deliver a nost learned<br />
lecture lasting for forty-five minutes or fifty minutes out of<br />
Melbourne and that on Monday morning I go to Sydney to open the<br />
Annual Conference of the Graziers' Association, so that I may<br />
condole with them about the disastrously low price of woolo<br />
( Laughter) Sir, I need to say no more. The procession waits;<br />
it is headed by the Scots Guards band, and I am told if I don't<br />
stop, it will start and once it starts, nobody will want to hear<br />
one word from me and nobody will. ( Laughter) Therefore, Sir in<br />
acknowledging the honour that you have done me in the regrettable<br />
absence of Her much-loved Majesty The Queen Mother, I declare the<br />
Festival open and in declaring it open and wishing it all success,<br />
I would rather like to be able to connunicate with The Queen<br />
Mother, if I may, as her representative on this occasion and tell<br />
her that by their applause the people of Adelaide sent not only<br />
their humble duty but sent her their love.<br />
