    <content><![CDATA[<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> I don't want to talk about internal party meetings but I think everybody feels very strongly that the Liberal Party brand in Queensland is the strongest political brand in that State, certainly if you look at things federally, and I am a strong Coalitionist and I will do everything I can do help the two parties do well in the next Queensland election, whenever that may be.</p>
<p> JOURNALIST:</p>
<p> Should Mark Vaile give up his job as Trade Minister?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> I beg your pardon?</p>
<p> JOURNALIST:</p>
<p> Should Mark Vaile give up being Trade Minister?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> That is not something that I would talk about here, he's doing a very good job as Trade Minister. If he wanted some different arrangement I would naturally talk to him about it.</p>
<p> JOURNALIST:</p>
<p> Ron Boswell says that he should stand aside from that portfolio and take a domestic portfolio, he said that this morning. Will you be looking at that and particularly...?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> I am not going to canvass that here.</p>
<p> JOURNALIST:</p>
<p> Prime Minister, do you believe the merger would help the Coalition parties in Queensland?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> I think myself that the only two scenarios can be the one that I described a couple of days ago and that is everybody joining the Liberal Party in Queensland or alternatively, a very strong functioning Coalition.</p>
<p> JOURNALIST:</p>
<p> Do you think that first option would help them though?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> I think that if the two parties worked together in Coalition they will get the best result.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
