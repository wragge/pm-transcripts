PRIME MINISTER 106/ 93<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON. P. J. KEATING<br />
PRIMS MINISTER'S RURAL AND REGIONA TASK FORCE<br />
I am pleased to announce today the formation of a new<br />
Prime ministerS Rural and Regional Task Force to help<br />
the Federal GovernenL better meet the needs of<br />
Australians living outside the capital cities.<br />
The task force is based largely on the successful former<br />
Country Task Force but its role has been broadened and<br />
will be co-ordinated with other Government activities<br />
already underway, especially those associated with<br />
regional development.<br />
The key aims of the Task Force will be:<br />
1. To inform rural Australians of relevant Government<br />
programs. 2. To assess the suitability of Government programs<br />
which assist rural Australians.<br />
3. To reporL on the effectiveness and efficiency of<br />
those programs.<br />
4. To advise the Prime Minister of any impediments to<br />
improving the performance of rural industries and, in<br />
particular, rural export performance.<br />
The decision to establish the Task Force was made<br />
yesterday at a meeLing between mryself and the minister<br />
for Primary Industrie6 and E~ nergy, Mr Crean, the Task<br />
Force chairman, Mr Harry Wood5, Secretary Bob Horne, and<br />
Senator Sue West. </p>
<p>Like the Country Task Force the new body will deal with<br />
all rural and socio-economic issues, including small<br />
business, the delivery of services, issues affecLing<br />
women, care fo~ r the elderly, employment and primary<br />
production. Its work will be directed as mu~ ch to people<br />
living in provincial towns and cities as to the farm<br />
sector. The Task Force will make regular visits to rural and<br />
regional Australia to meet with a wide range of conrnunity<br />
groups and other representatives and will report directly<br />
to me.<br />
Mr Woods can be contacted on ( 006) 42 6356.<br />
Mr Dick Adams ( Depu-ty Chairperson) on ( 003) 31 2033<br />
