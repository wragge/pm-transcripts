PRIM MNSTER<br />
FOR MEDIA TtESDA133 JUNfE 190.-<br />
SIR RUSSELL DRYSDALE<br />
( Statement by the Acting Prime Minister)<br />
I was deeply saddened to learn of the death of<br />
Sir Russell Drysdale.<br />
He was the first person to celebrate our vast Outback.<br />
He found beauty even in a drought-stricken landscape.<br />
Before Sir Russell, not many of us were awareof<br />
the Outback its beauty and its character -* from the drover's~<br />
wife to the aboriginal stockman, and to those fellows who tell<br />
yarns in country pubs.<br />
The sun-burnt colour that Drysdale found in our<br />
landscape is the colour of Australia.<br />
He was a prince of Australian art.<br />
On behalf of the Government I offer my deepest<br />
sympathy to Lady Drysdale and her family. </p>
