    <content><![CDATA[<p>I intend to recommend to the GovernorâGeneral, His Excellency General the Honourable Sir Peter Cosgrove AK MC, that he appoint the Hon Margaret Stone as Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security for a period of five years from 24 August 2015.</p>
<p>Ms Stone has had a distinguished legal career and was a judge of the Federal Court of Australia from 2000 to 2012. She has been the Independent Reviewer of Adverse Security Assessments since December 2012. She brings a wealth of experience and expertise to the position.</p>
<p>Australiaâs intelligence agencies make a vital contribution to our national security, particularly at a time when we face a serious threat from terrorism.</p>
<p>The Australian intelligence community operates within a robust oversight and accountability framework, and the Inspector-General plays an important role in reviewing the activities of the intelligence agencies.</p>
<p>I thank Dr Vivienne Thom whose term as Inspector-General finishes on 18 July 2015. Dr Thom has carried out the role with diligence and integrity and I wish her well for the future.</p>
<p>Mr Jake Blight will act as the Inspector-General until 23 August 2015.</p>
<p>16 July 2015</p>
