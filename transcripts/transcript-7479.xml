CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
BANQUET SPEECH<br />
BANGKOK 2 FEBRUARY 1989<br />
Thailand and Australia have been close friends for many<br />
years now. It is a friendship based on common international<br />
Sinterests and on an expanding economic relationship.<br />
Moreover, Mr Prime Minister, we have a shared commitment to<br />
the democratic processes. Unfortunately we live in a world<br />
where this cannot always be said with conviction.<br />
Mr Prime Minister, it is because we can build still further<br />
on that friendship and forge new ties between us, that I am<br />
delighted to return once more to the great city of Bangkok<br />
and the beautiful country of Thailand.<br />
On my last visit in 1983, I paid tribute to the tremendous<br />
changes that were taking place in Thailand.<br />
Mr Prime Minister, if anything I had underestimated the<br />
magnitude of those changes.<br />
For Thailand's economic achievements since then have been<br />
truly remarkable. Indeed on the basis of rapid<br />
Sindustrialisation and with a recent annual growth rate of<br />
around 10 per cent, Thailand is fast emerging as another<br />
tiger in a region already acknowledged as the fastest<br />
growing in the world.<br />
Once again I congratulate you, Mr Prime Minister, and<br />
through you the Thai people, for your energy,<br />
resourcefulness and determination.<br />
It is particularly gratifying that these developments have<br />
been accompanied by an obvious and substantial increase in<br />
the pace and quality of Thailand's relationship with<br />
Australia. </p>
<p>2.<br />
Two-way trade between us has more than doubled since 1983<br />
and is now worth over A$ 600 million. In that time<br />
Australian investment in Thailand has also more than<br />
doubled. Yet it remains true that, given the potential depth of our<br />
relationship, we have still only scratched the surface.<br />
Mr Prime Minister,<br />
The issues we discussed this morning, the friendly and<br />
constructive nature of those discussions and the breadth of<br />
the agreements that we reached make it clear that both our<br />
Governments are determined substantially to expand our<br />
relationship. Indeed, I believe we can claim to have put in place a new<br />
framework for the future.<br />
We agreed to start work on an Economic Co-operation<br />
Agreement which will provide a formal channel of<br />
communication between us across the entire spectrum of<br />
our economic relationship.<br />
We agreed to set a new target of A$ 1.3 billion in two-way<br />
trade by the end of 1991 an ambitious but achievable<br />
target which reflects our confidence in the future.<br />
For Australian's part we see mutual benefit in expanding our<br />
economic and technical co-operation to encompass new and<br />
more productive activities, such as power generation and<br />
distribution, as well as communications, railways,<br />
education, and agro-industry.<br />
We agreed to negotiate a concessional finance agreement to<br />
facilitate further links between us.<br />
We are to renew negotiations on a double taxation agreement.<br />
We have reached an understanding on energy co-operation.<br />
And, not least significantly, we have agreed to a new focus<br />
for Australian development assistance, broadening its<br />
emphasis to encompass support for private sector growth and<br />
the development of public infrastructure and utilities.<br />
This not only includes new areas of Australian expertise; it<br />
also represents our recognition that Thailand's<br />
needs are changing as it grows. I </p>
<p>Mr Prime Minister,<br />
The mutual respect, the practical endeavour and the fruitful<br />
co-operation of our relationship is well illustrated in the<br />
pressing field of law enforcement, particularly in tackling<br />
the international trade in narcotics and in combatting<br />
organised criminal networks.<br />
I would like to pay a special tribute tonight to the men and<br />
women in both our countries who work tirelessly to frustrate<br />
the efforts of those who seek profit from the suffering and<br />
misery of others.<br />
I am pleased that during my visit, I will be able to inspect<br />
the Royal Crop Substitution Program. This project stands as<br />
a testament to His Majesty's commitment to assisting<br />
disadvantaged groups in your country, particularly those<br />
rendered vulnerable through their poverty.<br />
Mr Prime Minister,<br />
Australian-Thai relations, which are so strong at the<br />
official level, are reinvigorated on a daily basis by the<br />
significant numbers of our people who travel between our two<br />
countries. Thousands of Thai students are studying in<br />
Australian educational institutions, and they are welcome<br />
among us. At the same time, increasing numbers of<br />
Australian tourists are visiting Thailand for business and<br />
holidays. An Australian Parliamentary delegation returned recently<br />
from Thailand and its chairman has already reported<br />
to me on the useful and positive talks that he and his<br />
colleagues held with their Thai counterparts.<br />
All these exchanges help build those intangible but vital<br />
links which are the soundest of all foundations for friendly<br />
international relationships.<br />
Mr Prime Minister,<br />
The impressive bilateral co-operation that has characterised<br />
the Thailand-Australia relationship has been complemented by<br />
our joint efforts internationally through the Cairns Group,<br />
and in other forums, to create a fairer trading environment.<br />
I pay tribute to the Thai contribution to this fundamentally<br />
important mission. </p>
<p>For, without a more equitable global trading system, the<br />
goals which we both seek for our peoples could be<br />
jeopardised.<br />
The failure of the Montreal Review to make progress on the<br />
issues of vital concern to us was very disappointing. It<br />
highlights the need for a still more determined effort by<br />
the Cairns Group in the lead up to the Geneva meeting, and<br />
beyond. The major economies of the United States, the European<br />
Community and Japan need to have sheeted home to them the<br />
fact that, without agricultural reform, there can be no<br />
equitable or meaningful reform of the international trading<br />
Ssystem. I am very pleased that in our discussion today, Mr Prime<br />
Minister, you expressed considerable interest in ideas for<br />
enhanced consultation. Our two Governments have agreed to<br />
explore this matter further, leading to an assessment of<br />
possible more formal intergovernmental arrangements than<br />
presently exist in the region.<br />
I welcome the fact that you will be discussing this with<br />
your ASEAN partners and we too of course will be consulting<br />
with them.<br />
Mr Prime Minister,<br />
In recent years we have seen an improvement in superpower<br />
relations leading to a greater degree of optimism than has<br />
been justified for many years. We must grasp the<br />
opportunities this presents to resolve problems in our own<br />
part of the world, and to work together in building a more<br />
peaceful, stable and prosperous region.<br />
It was towards this end that I announced, in June last year,<br />
a regional chemical weapons initiative which is intended to<br />
complement the development of a global chemical weapons<br />
convention. An expert team from Australia is currently<br />
visiting South-east Asia to continue the dialogue which has<br />
already commenced within our region.<br />
This is not an isolated example of close consultation<br />
between our Governments on international political and<br />
security issues. Over the years a habit of close and wide<br />
ranging dialogue has developed, of benefit to both sides. I </p>
<p>We value, too, our dialogue status with ASEAN, an<br />
organisation that has an enviable record in building<br />
regional peace and prosperity.<br />
Perhaps on no issue have we been in closer and longer<br />
contact than on the resolution of the problems in<br />
Indo-China.<br />
Last November, Mr Prime Minister, at the Foreign<br />
Correspondents Club of Thailand, you spoke of transforming<br />
Indochina from a war zone into a peace zone, linked with the<br />
rest of South-East Asia through close ties of trade,<br />
investment and modern communications.<br />
Shose comments echo my own sentiments and they truly reflect<br />
the aspirations of Australians.<br />
We very much welcome the new approach that you personally<br />
have brought to Thai policy towards Indo--China by building<br />
ties with Vietnam and Laos.<br />
Vietnam must be encouraged to see that its future lies not<br />
in being an island of stagnation in a sea of progress, but<br />
in participating in that regional prosperity which is now so<br />
obvious here in Thailand. There are signs that Vietnam's<br />
leaders now appreciate that fact.<br />
The peaceful resolution of the conflict in Cambodia is a<br />
crucial issue. This has now been a source of regional<br />
tension for more than ten years and must be resolved and put<br />
behind us if our region is fully to realise its potential.<br />
The Jakarta informal meeting process, the discussions<br />
between Prince Sihanouk and Hun Sen, and improvements in<br />
SSino-Soviet relations give cause for more hope than at any<br />
time in the recent past. Your own initiatives, Mr Prime<br />
Minister, which have involved dialogue with Vietnam, Laos<br />
and all the Khmer factions and, indeed, throughout the<br />
region have played a most valuable part in the drive towards<br />
a peaceful solution.<br />
Many problems, however, remain, not the least being<br />
agreement on transition arrangements leading to elections<br />
and the creation of a neutral, independent and sovereign<br />
Cambodia. There is also the need to ensure that Pol Pot and<br />
those of his barbaric regime have no role in Cambodia's<br />
future.<br />
Australia stands ready, as part of the region, to play its<br />
part in any restoration of peace in Cambodia. </p>
<p>It is significant, Mr Prime Minister, that the Government of<br />
Thailand and Laos have recently agreed on the<br />
desirability of building a bridge between your two<br />
countries over the Mekong River.<br />
Accordingly, in response to your request to me this morning,<br />
I am pleased to say that Australia is prepared, subject to<br />
further consultations and agreement with yourselves and the<br />
Government of Laos, to take on the design and construction<br />
of this project.<br />
We see it as an important physical link that can play a<br />
valuable role in the region's economic growth. Perhaps just<br />
as importantly, bridge building is a welcome symbol of the<br />
transformation of Indo-China from a war zone into a peace<br />
zone.<br />
We also strongly support the efforts of your Government and<br />
others in the region to examine realistic and humanitarian<br />
options for dealing with the continuing exodus of people<br />
from Indochina, and in working towards an international<br />
conference on this issue.<br />
Australia's record in resettling refugees, including from<br />
Indochina, is second to none. It is a record of which we<br />
are proud. Aside from Aboriginal Australians who can<br />
proudly claim to have resided in our continent for at least<br />
40,000 years, every Australian can trace his or her roots<br />
back to immigration at some point during the past 200 years.<br />
We are indeed a nation of immigrants.<br />
Although in the past our immigration selection procedures<br />
were conducted in a discriminatory fashion, I can assure you<br />
that since the early 1970s every trace of discrimination on<br />
grounds of race, and every last vestige of the outdated<br />
White Australia policy, has been expunged.<br />
I can give you my commitment that such practices will stay<br />
in the history books where they belong. Australia will not<br />
reverse that.<br />
To do so would be, as I have said in the Australian House of<br />
Representatives, not only morally repugnant but also<br />
economically insane.<br />
It would be to deny the active and equal membership of the<br />
Asian-Pacific Region towards which successive Australian<br />
Governments have worked and through which our economic<br />
future undoubtedly lies. So this is something on which<br />
there will be no compromise. </p>
<p>Mr Prime Minister,<br />
Australia is not selectively committed to the affairs of<br />
this region. We are totally committed to them.<br />
So I am grateful, Mr Prime Minister, for the warm reception<br />
I have received in your country and for the hospitality that<br />
the Royal Thai Government has extended to me and Hazel.<br />
I am particularly pleased that, we have been able to<br />
establish on a personal basis such a friendly and positive<br />
dialogue.<br />
SIn doing so, we have reaffirmed the warm Thai-Australian<br />
friendship and continued the close dialogue that has, for<br />
many years now, characterised our bilateral relationship.<br />
But let us look forwards, not back.<br />
Australia and Thailand share a future of enormous scope and<br />
potential. It is a future offering virtually limitless<br />
benefits to our people and to the people of our region.<br />
Let us together seize those benefits and secure that future<br />
in a spirit of friendship, co-operation and diligence. 1 </p>
