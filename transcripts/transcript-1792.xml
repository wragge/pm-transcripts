FOR PRESS: PM, No. 27/ 1968<br />
ZTAMF RECEIPTS DUTY<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, Mr John Gorton<br />
The Prime Minister today released the text of correspondence<br />
( attached) between the Commonwealth and the States on the question of<br />
the Victorian State Receipts Duty legislation as It applied to incomes.<br />
The Prime Minister said that the Commonwealth did not<br />
object In principle to the extension of State Taxation into the general field<br />
of business receipts or business turnover provided this was not carried to<br />
the point where It could significantly affect the carrying out of Commonwealth<br />
policies or revenue collections.<br />
But he emphasised that the Commonwealth believed that<br />
State Receipts Duty should hot be collected on wages or salaries and had<br />
reached this belief after careful consideration of possible effects on I<br />
taxpayers and on the economy should this form of taxation become established<br />
and Increased. He said It was true that a State Tax on wages and salaries<br />
at the rate of one cent in ten dollars Is not, In itself, a major impost but<br />
it Is inconsistent with the principle of uniform income tax, Is contrary to<br />
the conditions under which the Commonwealth is providing general revenue<br />
grants to the States, and could be extended to lead to a situation where this<br />
type of income tax might be Imposed by the States on a significant scale.<br />
He said the Commonwealth could not stand by and permit<br />
this to happen because the Imposition of income tax, and the rates of Income<br />
tax imposed, have major implications for national economic and social<br />
0 policies applicable throughout the whole natiork and the Commonwealth<br />
could not allow them to be Impaired.<br />
He said he was sure that the majority of Australians had<br />
no wish to return to the dual Income taxation system which existed before<br />
the introduction of uniform income tax.<br />
