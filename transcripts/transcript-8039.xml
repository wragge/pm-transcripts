SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
LUNCHEON IN HONOUR OF MEXICAN PRESIDENT SALINAS<br />
CANBERRA 22 JUNE 1990<br />
It is my great pleasure to welcome you to Canberra today,<br />
Mr President, on this the first visit to Australia by a<br />
President of Mexico.<br />
That fact alone makes this a most significant occasion for<br />
us. We hope that you will take home with you a warm and<br />
positive impression of Australia from your first hand<br />
experience here, and that your visit will open a new chapter<br />
in the friendly relations between us.<br />
You and your distinguished party are very welcome guests to<br />
Canberra and to Australia.<br />
Mr President, it is now nearly a quarter of a century since<br />
diplomatic relations were established between Australia and<br />
Mexico in 1966.<br />
It is true to say, Mr President, and appropriate to<br />
acknowledge, that relations between our two countries since<br />
then have not lived up to their potential whether that be<br />
measured by the exchange of goods and services between us,<br />
visits by tourists and business leaders, or contacts in the<br />
fields of culture, scholarship, or entertainment.<br />
Yet there is much that we have in common that should form<br />
the basis not just of a friendly relationship but of a more<br />
profitable and productive one than in the past.<br />
Not least of those things that we have in common,<br />
Mr President, is a long Pacific coastline. And we are<br />
increasingly recognising that this fact of our geography<br />
must become a central element in our economic life.<br />
Mexico of course has had a Pacific orientation for several<br />
centuries, even in that long-gone era when your country,<br />
Mr President, went by the Eurocentric name of New Spain and<br />
my country was a little known continent called New Holland. </p>
<p>2.<br />
But in our own time the Asia-Pacific region is seeing a<br />
surge in economic activity that is dramatic in its intensity<br />
and unprecedented in its scope. That has brought with it<br />
new prosperity and also the new challenges of managing and<br />
fostering that activity, including through closer policy<br />
co-ordination and greater policy flexibility in our domestic<br />
and international arrangements.<br />
This visit of yours then, Mr President, comes at a very<br />
important time. The many positive moves you have taken to<br />
bring about stable economic growth in Mexico are beginning<br />
to pay dividends, and Mexico is showing a heightened<br />
interest in the Pacific.<br />
Let me say, Mr President, that your program of liberalising,<br />
modernising and restructuring the Mexican economy is one we<br />
applaud and support. Mexico is already the largest and<br />
strongest of the Latin American economies bordering the<br />
Pacific and, from Australia's vantage point on this side of<br />
the ocean, your reform program presents exciting and<br />
encouraging opportunities.<br />
So as this reform process continues, we may look forward to<br />
the day when new and strong economic ties span the Pacific<br />
and link Mexico more closely to this region opening the<br />
way for a more active involvement by Mexico in the political<br />
and economic affairs of this region.<br />
Mr President, you have rightly insisted that developing<br />
countries must accept responsibility for stimulating their<br />
own economic growth.<br />
At the same time, Mexico has shown a readiness to engage in<br />
the hard but constructive work of multilateral dialogue<br />
and indeed not simply a readiness but a positive and<br />
energetic capacity. This is apparent in a number of fields;<br />
let me refer to three of them.<br />
I refer first to Mexico's supportive contribution to the<br />
painstaking work of regional and international arms control<br />
and disarmament particularly relating to chemical weapons.<br />
Your work in the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva, and at<br />
the Government and Industry Conference Against Chemical<br />
Weapons that we hosted here in Canberra last year, was both<br />
welcome and valuable.<br />
I refer too to Mexico's involvement in the European Bank for<br />
Reconstruction and Development, in the establishment of<br />
which Australia too has played a part. Following the<br />
breathtaking revolutions in Eastern Europe last year, it is<br />
encouraging that we are demonstrating in a tangible way,<br />
through this new Bank, our shared commitment to assisting<br />
the East Europeans in the restoration of democratic<br />
processes and the rehabilitation and expansion of economic<br />
activity. </p>
<p>And perhaps even more importantly, Mr President, I consider<br />
Mexico's decision back in 1986 to become a contracting party<br />
to the GATT the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade<br />
and the steps taken since then to open the Mexican economy<br />
to foreign imports and foreign investment to have been<br />
highly significant and welcome developments.<br />
Like Mexico, Australia is a firm believer in the GATT. We<br />
have made numerous representations in recent years to<br />
encourage the lowering of subsidies for farm production and<br />
exports by the world's leading trading nations, both through<br />
the Uruguay Round and particularly through our chairmanship<br />
of the Cairns Group of fair trading nations.<br />
We have welcomed Mexico's positive approach to these<br />
negotiations. Your speech to the GATT last February,<br />
Mr President, was a significant political contribution to<br />
the success of the Round. You described the Uruguay Round<br />
as, and let me quote, " the best opportunity this century to<br />
promote and defend a system of trade that offers benefits<br />
that can be shared by the entire international trading<br />
community." I cannot overstate the extent to which those words find<br />
support here in Australia. Your emphasis on our global<br />
interdependence gives a totally accurate perspective on an<br />
issue that too often is considered by the major trading<br />
nations in a blinkered, sectoral and shortsighted fashion.<br />
Mr President, we hope, as we know you do, that one of the<br />
major results of your visit will be a boost to the trading<br />
opportunities between our two countries. Although modest by<br />
world standards, our two-way trade has increased<br />
substantially in the past five years.<br />
Efforts to restructure both our economies should create<br />
further opportunities for trade and investment in the years<br />
ahead. Australia has the expertise to assist you to develop<br />
and modernise Mexico's priority sectors such as agriculture,<br />
mining, power generation, transport and communications.<br />
Your visit, Mr President, together with the contacts made by<br />
the senior business people who have accompanied you on this<br />
occasion, will play an important part in this process.<br />
We have also today seen the signing of an Extradition<br />
Treaty, the first Australia has had with any Latin American<br />
country, and testimony, I believe, to our cooperative<br />
working relationship. </p>
<p>4.<br />
Mr President, I have mentioned many of our shared interests<br />
and values but I have failed so far to mention our shared<br />
achievements in the sporting world. Both Australia and<br />
Mexico have proud sporting traditions and we have both been<br />
successful hosts of modern Olympic Games in Melbourne in<br />
1956 and in Mexico City in 1968. Australia is, as you know,<br />
currently pursuing our bid for Melbourne once again to host<br />
the Games in 1996, because we believe we can provide world<br />
class facilities, a secure environment and a warm welcome<br />
from a community totally committed to this bid and fully<br />
dedicated to furthering the Olympic ideal.<br />
Mr President,<br />
Both our countries are blessed with rich resources, not<br />
least with two great peoples. And, ultimately, it is the<br />
people-to-people links between Australia and Mexico which<br />
will replenish and renew our relationship providing us with<br />
the best possible foundation for an even better and brighter<br />
future. I wish you, Mr President, every success in continuing to<br />
meet the challenges of government in Mexico, and in further<br />
developing Mexico's important and constructive role in the<br />
world. </p>
