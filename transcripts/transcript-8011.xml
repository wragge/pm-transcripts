PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF NEWS CONFERENCE, NATIONAL PARK CENTRE,<br />
ECEABAT, GALLIPOLI, 25 APRIL 1990<br />
JOURNALIST: Well, how do you feel, Mr Hawke?<br />
PM: I think, like all the rest of you, still very<br />
emotionally effected by, by this morning and just<br />
particularly, as you've seen, I've spent a lot of time<br />
with the old veterans and just to sit and listen to them<br />
is a most moving experience. Most of them are still<br />
thinking about the mates they left behind which is very<br />
moving. JOURNALIST: And how are they Mr Hawke?<br />
PM: I think they're in great shape. It's surprising<br />
really to, to see the resilience of them. You know,<br />
you're young and fit and, you know, when you've come far<br />
and across the world that you feel a bit, you know, down<br />
and you've got to take a while to get yourself together.<br />
Well, here are these fellows of an average age, I<br />
suppose, of about 94 or 95 and vibrant, their eyes<br />
sparkling. I think it's just the remembrance of their,<br />
their mates here and being back here that's just lifted<br />
them. JOURNALIST: Was it what you expected this morning?<br />
PM: I guess so.' It was hard to tell in the dark at<br />
first, of course. I didn't realise just how very close<br />
we were to the beach where we did the service. I thought<br />
perhaps we were a bit further up the hill, but then when<br />
the light came up and you saw there was the water, the<br />
very water out of which those men had stepped and into<br />
that hail of death, it was unbelievably moving.<br />
JOURNALIST: What part of the ceremony did you find most<br />
effected you?<br />
PM: I think probably when you saw the ones who stood up.<br />
for the national anthems and the ones who wanted to, but<br />
who couldn't quite make it. I think that was, you know,<br />
perhaps the most moving part in a sense.<br />
JOURNALIST: Did you ever have to fight back tears?<br />
PM: No, not fight back, but I wouldn't have tried. I<br />
don't think anyone there today was really trying to fight </p>
<p>anything back. If it happened, it happened. No-one need<br />
feel any sense of shame about tears there today.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, the big question of course is that<br />
the significance of this is perhaps the last visit that<br />
the veterans may well make here.<br />
PM: Yes.<br />
JOURNALIST: What's going to happen to the Gallipoli<br />
legend afterwards?<br />
PM: I think it will, it will live on and in fact this<br />
pilgrimage today I think will serve to ensure that that<br />
happens because the new generation of Australians is<br />
going to have seen the commitment of these men of<br />
years ago, who were here 75 years ago, they are going to<br />
see that and this is a sort of a regeneration of the<br />
spirit of ANZAC which will go on I think.<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you think that's true of young people<br />
today? PM: I think so. You looked at the, at the number of<br />
people there today. I particularly noticed as I was<br />
coming out, because it was too dark when we were going<br />
in, but by the end of the service I was able to move<br />
around at the end of it amongst the,-the people there and<br />
as I was driving away I also saw them. Just hundreds and<br />
hundreds of young people and they weren't there just as<br />
tourists. You could tell that in listening to them and<br />
talking to them. I was with a sense of pilgrimage that<br />
they were there.<br />
JOURNALIST: Did you find yourself looking up at the<br />
sphinx and looking up at the hill and wondering?<br />
PM: I looked there and I didn't see the sphinx from<br />
where I was, but-I really have a feeling that this<br />
afternoon when we go back there, I'd just like to get out<br />
of the car and away from the groups and just, literally,<br />
just walk by myself through the, through the battle<br />
points. I'd love it if it's possible, I don't know<br />
whether it is, to go to Quinn's Post. I mean, I think in<br />
all the reading of, about Gallipoli, that was very much<br />
in my mind because it was a remarkable achievement. It<br />
was attacked throughout the period of the eight months by<br />
the Turks and it was never once relinquished and the, the<br />
intensity of the fighting there which is unimaginable and<br />
I'd just like to get out for a walk around and get<br />
the feel of it directly.<br />
JOURNALIST: Did you find that, after all the reading<br />
you've done on Gallipoli, actually being there and seeing<br />
the landscape made it all, brought it all home to you?<br />
PM: Brought it back and you just try and, you know,<br />
close your eyes and imagine the men landing in the water </p>
<p>3<br />
and the making their way up the, up the hill. You've got<br />
to remember that it's quite different now in a sense from<br />
what it was. That road that goes through the middle<br />
where we were was not there before. It was just a fairly<br />
sheer climb that they had there in 1915. But even<br />
making allowances for that, you could get an impression<br />
of what an enormous achievement that was to get from the<br />
beach up to that ridge. You've got to remember that the<br />
first day was the day they made their, their furthest<br />
incursion and at the end of that first day they'd reached<br />
about a mile and a half inland some of them, not a lot<br />
of them and that was the furthest point that was<br />
reached in the whole of the eight months.<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you think every Australian should make an<br />
effort to get to Gallipoli one time in their life?<br />
PM: Yes, I think it would be good for all Australians to<br />
get there. Yes, it is and I must say for myself, I'd<br />
never read so intensely about it as I had in preparation<br />
for coming here and I just feel I know more about my<br />
country now as a result of having done that.<br />
