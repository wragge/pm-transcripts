PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA SUNDAY, 10 AUGUST, 1980<br />
ELECTORATE TALK<br />
Both the world economy and the Australian economy have been<br />
through a difficult period since the first energy crisis in<br />
the early ' 70s. All of the Western industrialised countries<br />
felt these pressures. But the response in Australia by the<br />
Whitlam Government was in itself a transparent crisis of<br />
management and policy because in many ways Australia had<br />
been in a more fortunate position than other countries.<br />
Our natural resources, our great endowment of energy, our<br />
long record of low inflation these should have provided<br />
the basis for relative improvement in Australia during<br />
those testing and difficult years. Yet we lost ground.<br />
Australia suffered a severe loss of international<br />
competitiveness. Our industry lost export markets. It<br />
faced increasing competition from importers and as a result<br />
had to really battle just to survive. Now, five years later<br />
as a result of policies that have at their heart the<br />
reduction of inflation forces are at work in our economy<br />
and our industries which give us cause for optimism.<br />
There is no doubt we faced a formidable task in restoring<br />
the conditions on which Australia's future wealth and welfare<br />
depend and in many ways the job has been much more<br />
difficult than many people believed. But we have achieved<br />
success because of our commitment to overcoming inflation and<br />
responsibly restoring a stable economic climate in which<br />
business can make decisions.<br />
In essence, what we have been about has been to rein-in<br />
the demands of Government and to reduce what is called the<br />
Budget defi ' cit. Last financial year the Budget deficit was<br />
reduced to just over $ 2,000 million well below the deficit<br />
'-of $ 3.4 ' million in the previous year. That deficit was<br />
equivalent to substantially less than 2 per cent of the<br />
Gross Domestic Product, which is in marked contrast to the<br />
per cent recorded in 1975-76 when Australia was counting<br />
the cost of the Whitlam Government's spending binge,<br />
There is no doubt that in difficult world conditions our<br />
policies have had encouraging success. / 2 </p>
<p>2-<br />
The economy has been steadily growing in strength during<br />
the past few years and our relative position in the world has<br />
substantially improved. ' Inflation in Australia has been<br />
below that for major industrial countries since 1978 and<br />
that margin has widened in our favour to about 3 percentage<br />
points. In other words, during the Labor years Australia lost<br />
ground, slipped behind the rest of the world, because of<br />
the policies followed by the Government of the day.<br />
But today the position is reversed. We have pulled ahead of<br />
our competitors because we have been willing to take the<br />
necessary tough decisions., As a result, our competitive<br />
position has returned to levels that were last achieved in<br />
Australia in the very early 1970s. Our exports have greatly<br />
expanded, having risen by 33 per cent last financial year.<br />
And our balance of payments position has strengthened<br />
accordingly. Continued strength is in prospect in 1980-81 despite the<br />
gloomy economic conditions facing many countries. Of course,<br />
the good news is not confined to exports. The Australian<br />
Bureau of Statistics' Survey of Investment suggests that a<br />
surge in capital spending will take place this year with gains<br />
in all parts of the economy.<br />
The Government also knows of at least $ 29 billion worth of<br />
investment in the 1980s that is firmly committed or ready to<br />
go ahead. Employment growth has also been strong during the<br />
last year. The number of people employed has risen by<br />
175,000 while this week's figures show that total unemployment<br />
in July fell by 21,000 from the previous month. The figures<br />
showed that the unemployment rate, although too high, is<br />
below that at this time last year.<br />
Australians do not need reminding that irresponsibility will<br />
certainly sweep aside these hard-won gains, That irresponsibility<br />
is already stalking the stage in wage demands and in<br />
confidence-shattering spending and tax proposals. If it is<br />
allowed to persist without challenge, faith and optimism for<br />
the future will be eroded and improvements in wealth and<br />
incomes forestalled.<br />
Like Mr. Whitlam before him, Mr. Hayden clearly has thrown<br />
away any vestige of the essential commitment and sense of<br />
duty required of government leaders to strive for the best<br />
for all Australians. His commitment is to big spending.<br />
His** faith is in an open-ended cheque book that bears the<br />
* name " Australian taxpayer".<br />
The ALP has already committed itself to $ 2,000 million a year<br />
extra expenditure and that in only about five areas of<br />
government. When all the other Shadow Ministers put in their<br />
bids and all the other commitments are met the additional<br />
spending under Labor will be-much more than the taxpayers of<br />
Australia could ever afford. </p>
<p>3<br />
Without exception, each of Labor's so-called policy<br />
initiatives that Mr. Hayden trots out comes with thepromise<br />
to spend up big. It is all trussed up to look moderate and<br />
reasonable. But beneath the word games, Mr. Hayden's answer<br />
in every policy area is simple spend, spend, spend.<br />
Australians were conned once by Mr. Whitlam's big spending.<br />
They won't be caught again. The plain truth is that sound<br />
and stable economic management is what is required the<br />
type of management that my Government has undertaken<br />
in the last five years.<br />
The Budget to be brought down in just over a week's time<br />
will demonstrate our continuing and unyielding commitment<br />
to sound and responsible economic policies. For without<br />
this we can never hope to control inflation, increase<br />
employment, encourage investment and development and secure<br />
a future for all Australians. Certainly many challenges lie<br />
ahead of us. We are determined to play our role with<br />
responsible economic decision-making as we move through<br />
