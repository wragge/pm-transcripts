SPEECH BY THE PRIMIE MINISTER;~ THE HON R. J. HAWKEr-AC, NP,<br />
AT THE QUEENSLAND ELECTION CAflPAIGN OPENING<br />
BRISDANE<br />
2 OCTOBER 1983<br />
THERE'S NO DOUBT AT ALL THAT THE ELECTIONS ON THE<br />
22ND OF OCTOBER ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT IN QUEENSLAND FOR MORE<br />
THAN A QUARTER OF A CENTURY.<br />
THAT'S NOT JUST BECAUSE OF WHAT THIS ELECTION MEANS<br />
TO QUEENSLAND, IT'S WHAT IT MEANS To AUSTRALIA,<br />
BECAUSE, WE WON'T BE ABLE TO ACHIEVE AND SUSTAIN<br />
THE FULL ECONOMIC RECOVERY WE ARE WORKING FOR IN AUSTRALIA<br />
FOR THE WHOLE OF AUSTRALIA WITHOUT THE MAXIMUM CONTRIBUTION<br />
AND EFFORT AND CO-OPERATION FROM THIS GREAT STATE OF QUEENSLAND,<br />
AND ONLY THE WRIGHT GOVERNMENT THE WRIGHTr LABOR<br />
GOVERNMENT THE KEITH WRIGHT LABOR GOVERNMENT CAN GIVE<br />
THAT CONTRIBUTION, THAT CO-OF%--ATION.<br />
AND I DO NOT SAY THAT IN ANY NARROW PARTY POLITICAL SENSE.<br />
IT IS JUST A STATEMENT OF FACT,<br />
IT'S NOT ONLY A MATTER OF THE PROGRESSIVE POLICIES,<br />
THE LABOR POLICIES, THAT KEITH WRIGHT IS PRESENTING TO THE PEOPLE<br />
OF QUEENSLAND. s s a/ 2 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
AND IT'S NOT JUST A MATTER OF KEITH WRIGHT'S COMMITMENTAND<br />
LABOR'S COMMITMENT To CO-OPERATION WITH OUR AUSTRALIAN<br />
GOVERNMENT TO SECURE~ THE BEST POSSIBLE DEAL FOR QUEENSLAND<br />
AND QUEENSLANDERS, AND IT'S NOT JUST A MATTER OF THE REFUSAL BY THE<br />
FORMER COALITION GOVERNMENT, AND NOW BY THE SO-CALLED MINORITY<br />
GOVERNMENT TO PARTICIPATE IN-JOB CREATION SCHEMES AND THE<br />
RECOVERY PROGRAMS PROVIDED BY OUR GOVERNMENT, OR EVEN TO<br />
SPEND THE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS WE HAVE PROVIDED FOR QUEENSLAND<br />
TO CREATE JOBS HERE.<br />
ALL THESE MATTERS ARE IMPORTANT AND SERIOUS,<br />
BUT OVERRIDING THEM ALL, IS THE FUNDAMENTAL FACT THAT<br />
ONLY A LABOR VICTORY ON THE 22ND OF OCTOBER CAN RESTORE STABILITY<br />
AND DEMOCRACY TO QUEENSLAND.<br />
EVERY QUEENSLANDER KNOWS THIS AS WELL AS I DO,<br />
ANY OTHER RESULTr THAN A LABOR VICTORY MUST MEAN EVEN<br />
MORE INSTABILITY AN EVEN WORSE CRISIS THAN THE ONE WHICH BEGAN<br />
TWO MONTHS AGO.<br />
AND UNLESS THERE IS A RETURN TO STABILITY THE<br />
STABILITY THAT ONLY A WRIGHT GOVERNMENT CAN GUARANTEE THEN<br />
QUEENSLAND WILL NOT BE ABLE TO GET O'N WITH THE JOB, ALONG WITH<br />
THE. REST OF AUSTRALIA, OF BEATING THE GREAT PROBLEMS AND<br />
DIFFICULTIES WE ALL FACE TOGETHER. a B / 3 </p>
<p>-3-<br />
AND THAT IS WHY THE ELECTION ON THE 22ND OF OCTOBER<br />
IS SO VITAL FOR QUEENSLAND AND AUSTRALIA FOR ALL QUEENSLANDERS,<br />
FOR ALL AUSTRALIANS., AND LET ME STRESS THIS POINT: THE OVERWHELMING<br />
NEED FOR QUEENSLAND AND AUSTRALIA AT THIS CRITICAL POINT IN OUR<br />
HISTORY IS GENUINE CO-OPERATION BETWEEN GOVERNMENTS, BU. INESS<br />
AND UNIONS, AND SPEAKING FOR THE AUSTRALIAN LABOR GOVERNMENT,<br />
THE CO-OPERATION AND UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN MY GOVERNMENT AND<br />
THE AUSTRALIAN BUSINESS COMMUNITY IS UNPRECEDENTED CLOSER AND<br />
MORE GENUINELY CONSTRUCTIVE THAN AT ANY TIME IN OUR COUNTRY'S<br />
HISTORY$ AND IT S THAT SORT OF CO-OPERATION AND UNDERSTANDING<br />
BETWEEN GOVERNMENT AND BUSINESS WHICH THE WRIGHT LABOR GOVERNMENT<br />
WILL BRING TO QUEENSLAND$<br />
IT S TRUE THE TASK AHEAD FOR KEITH WRIGHT AND THE<br />
LABOR PARTY IN QUEENSLAND OVER THE NEXT THREE WEEKS IS MASSIVE.<br />
IN TERMS OF SEATS WE HAVE TO WIN, IT IS A BIG GAP<br />
TO CLOSE, I<br />
BUT AFTER NEWPORT, THERE'S NOTHING DAUNTING ABOUT<br />
THAT. s/ 4 </p>
<p>WHAT COUJTS IS THE BEST SKIPPER AND THE BEST TEAM,<br />
AND CAN THERE BE ANY DOUBT THAT THAT IS JUST WHAT WE HAVE IN<br />
QUEENSLAND WITH KEITH WRIGHT AND A LABOR PARTY, VIGOROUS AND<br />
UNITED, READY FOR ACTION, READY FOR GOVERNMENT?<br />
IN THE LAST TWO YEARS, THE PEOPLE AROUND AUSTRALIA HAVE<br />
SHOWN THAT WHAT THEY WANT IS THE STABLE, MODERATE, COMPASSIONATE,<br />
CO-OPERATIVE, PROGRESSIVE GOVERNMENT THAT ONLY LABOR CAN PROVIDE,<br />
NOW IT IS QUEENSLAND'S TURN.<br />
THE 22ND OF OCTOBER WILL BE A GREAT DAY FOR LABOR,<br />
IT WILL BE A GREAT DAY FOR QUEENSLAND.<br />
IT WILL BE A GREAT DAY FOR AUSTRALIA.<br />
KEITH WRIGHT WILL BRING TO THE GOVERNMENT OF<br />
QUEENSLAND THE QUALITIES OF VIGOUR AND VISION, COMPASSION AND<br />
CONCERN, UNDERSTANDING OF THE REAL NEEDS AND PROBLEMS OF THE<br />
PEOPLE, AND NOT LEAST, THE INTEGRITY, THAT QUEENSLAND SO<br />
BADLY NEEDS. THERE COULDN T BE A CLEARER CHOICE, A CLEARER<br />
CONTRAST, WITH THE ALTERNATIVE. </p>
<p>AND I REPEAT AND EMPHASISE: THERE IS NO ALTERNATIVE<br />
TO A LABOR VICTORY AND A WRIGHT LABOR GOVERNMENT ON THE 22ND<br />
OF OCTOBER, IF YOU ARE TO HAVE ANY SEMBLANCE OF STABLE, DECENT,<br />
DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT IN THIS GREAT STATE OF QUEENSLAND.<br />
QUEENSLANDERS AND FELLOW AUSTRALIANS, I HAVE THE<br />
HONOUR TO INTRODUCE TO YOU THE LEADER OF THE AUSTRALIAN LABOR<br />
PARTY IN QUEENSLAND, THE NEXT PREMIER OF QUEENSLAND KEITH<br />
WRIGHT, </p>
