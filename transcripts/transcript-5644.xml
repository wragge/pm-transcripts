ELECTORATE TALK<br />
( The weekly Prime Ministerial electorate talk o ve r A. -HA milto6n<br />
today is given by the Minister for Health,* The Hon. M. J. R. MacKellar)<br />
I want to speak to you briefly about the new health insurance<br />
arrangements which start on Tuesday, 1 September. I think that<br />
by this stage most people will be quite clear in their minds<br />
as to what they should do to protect themselves against health<br />
costs from that date.<br />
Very briefly, the arrangement is that unless you are eligible<br />
for free care ( and over three million people will be) you will<br />
need to take out health insurance. Those eligible for free<br />
care include pensioners and sickness beneficiaries who have a<br />
pensioner health benefits card, peopl&amp; in special need and<br />
these are people on specified low incomes, people on unemployment*<br />
benefits on certain income levels, migrants and refugees for<br />
their first six months in this country.<br />
For those who need to take out private health insurance, the<br />
health insurance funds have been announcing details of their<br />
benefits offered and the oontribution rates charged. It is pleasing<br />
to note that the net cost of such health insurance will be cheaper<br />
under the new arrangements than it is now, due to the effect of<br />
the taxation-rebate made by the Government. The first of September<br />
will see the start of a system of health funding that will preserve<br />
the element of choice by both the providers and the users of health<br />
care, it will protect those in special need against health care<br />
costs, it will require State Governments to take up their proper<br />
constitutional responsibilities for health services, and it will<br />
encourage a s.. ense of personal responsibility in using and paying<br />
for health care.<br />
The new arrangements reflect the Commonwealth Government's corrnmitrnent<br />
to'small Government'. This is important if people are to be free<br />
to decide how they will spend their money rather than having the<br />
Government take the decisions for them through heavier taxation<br />
burdens. This is a basic difference between the philosophies of<br />
the Government and the Labor Party, who are apparently still committed<br />
to a monopolistic, centralised, tax-financed,' Government healt~ h schen-. t<br />
I say " apparently" committed because so far the Labor Party is, a<br />
Party without a health policy. ./ 2 </p>

* The fact that they do not have a health * policy goes a long way towards<br />
explaining the " spoilt child" behaviour of the opposition during -these<br />
last few weeks in attempting to spread misunderstandings within<br />
the community. This is unfortunate, because in any change, people*<br />
n. eed to consider what they need to do to take best advantage of the<br />
coverage available.<br />
We believe that the new health arrangements will serve the country*<br />
well preserving and encouraging the best elements and standards of<br />
our hicj. h quality health care delivery system. lie also believe that.<br />
the new arrangements will avoid the destructive effects of so-called<br />
tfree" health schemies.-There is no such thing as a free health scheme.<br />
The Government will use community funds, gathered th-rough . general<br />
* taxation, to fully protect the less well-off, the elderly, and others<br />
in our. community in special neied. * For the majority' of people who do<br />
not fall into these categories, the Government will heavily subsidise<br />
private health insurance rates. These subsidies are expressed by way<br />
of taxation rebates, and direct financial grants through medical<br />
benefits and subsidies to private hospitals. I believe that<br />
this kind of approach represents a reasonable and a proper balance<br />
between the Government's role and the right to individual choice<br />
and responsibility. 000---</p>
