EBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER AT OFFICIAL DINNER<br />
GIVEN BY PRIME MINISTER AKBUWUT<br />
ANKARA 23 APRIL 1990<br />
Mr Prime Minister and Mrs Akbulut<br />
Distinguished Guests,<br />
I am privileged to be the first Prime Minister of Australia<br />
to visit this great country, so rich in its history, its<br />
civilisation and its cultures. It is a happy coincidence<br />
that tday shulthb<br />
T I-&amp; UsJ4" ido u bLWe 91h Ã± SDy, 1 0m. an<br />
institution to which you, Mr Prime Minister, made such a<br />
notable contribution as Speaker.<br />
It is a remarkable illustration of the strange workings of<br />
history, Mr Prime Minister, that I should be here in Turkey<br />
to commemorate the 75th Anniversary of the first great<br />
encounter between our two countries a tragic meeting, as<br />
adversaries, on the field of battle.<br />
Let it be said at the outset, however, that this was not a<br />
conflict which engendered lasting hatred. Indeed, even<br />
before it was over, it had imbued the adversaries with a<br />
dtede p jea nd agbcifd iingg cer easjp ectT tfo r etrh. e, , courage, prowess, endurance<br />
S qaL ~ egrce xenrate in commemorating<br />
the landing of the ANZACs on Gallipoli, and honouring those<br />
who fought and fell there.<br />
The Gallipoli campaign, of course, has a special and solemn<br />
significance for Australians.<br />
The Australian Commonwealth had been created only fourteen<br />
years before. It was at Gallipoli, for the first time, that<br />
the youth of Australia came together in the supreme ordeal<br />
of war. In these fires were forged many of the qualities we<br />
still most value in the Australian character. The events of<br />
Gallipoli have never lost their hold on the minds and hearts<br />
of the Australian people.<br />
Tt~ jor thAn rP;, nnm C. a 11yr1 i rnAr~ Ad AM AtIn. h A<br />
significant event in the development of Australian<br />
nationhood. 6927 </p>
<p>2<br />
And in that context the context of our mature sense of<br />
nationhood I should acknowledge the very welcome and<br />
representative presence tonight of the Leader of the<br />
opposition in the Australian Parliament, Dr John Hewson, who<br />
accompanies me on this pilgrimage, not as a pcolitical<br />
opponent, but as a parliamentary colleague.<br />
As you have remarked, Mr Prime Minister, the Gallipoli<br />
campaign also marked an important step towards the emergence<br />
of modern Turkey.<br />
It was through his brilliant defence of the Gallipoli<br />
a, QZ -41la his exlozits O~ i thee f -nts in the~<br />
First World War, that the great Mustapha Kema. Ataturkc<br />
demonstrated the singular qualities of leadership which<br />
enabled him subsequently to create the Turkish Republic.<br />
It is remarkable to reflect that the tragedy of our first<br />
encounter has been the source of nationhood for both our<br />
countries. As you have noted, Mr Prime Minister, we are living through<br />
a period of profound change in the world, a period, indeed<br />
an epoch, not without its danqers certainly, but of immense<br />
promise and hope.<br />
But, even as we note and welcome the historic<br />
transformation, in Eastern Europe especially, it is<br />
important to acknowledge the continuing relevance of the<br />
RO~~ ft LISS. TV~ tay, SOa M) O p~ rawafep ad, Ln<br />
Asia;-PacTiC1Oregion, Australia. It is as important as ever<br />
that we should maintain the strength and stabiLlity essential<br />
to ensuring that the opportunities now beckoning achieve<br />
their potential.<br />
Australia and Turkey have achieved international<br />
reconciliation and mutual understanding. These are the same<br />
objectives which we must encourage in international<br />
relations generally in the last decade of thii3 century, a<br />
century which has seen such dreadful conflict, such<br />
destructive antagonisms.<br />
The encounter between our countries in war has been<br />
transformed into a constructive relationship in peace.<br />
Since the Tenth Anniversary of the Gallipoli landing was<br />
sawaAeseated qjidt a b~ aeh seewasny an oallipIli in 1039,<br />
thousands of Australians have visited your country to pay<br />
homage to the fallen. In doing so they have increased<br />
Australia's knowledge of Turkey and our regard for its<br />
people. In 1985 on the 70th Anniversary of the Gallipoli landing, in<br />
an exceptional gesture of friendship to a former foe, your<br />
Government agreed to rename that part of the Gallipoli<br />
Peninsula where the ANZAC landing took place, " Anzac Cove".<br />
69328 </p>
<p>To reciprocate this qesture we established the Ataturk<br />
Memorial Garden in Canberra, within the precincts of the<br />
Australian War Memorial.<br />
The garden features a commemorative stone with a bas-relief<br />
of Ataturk and an inscription of his tribute to his<br />
opponents in the Gallipoli campaign. This memorable tribute,<br />
written by Ataturk in 1934, is eloquent testimony to the<br />
complete reconciliation of former enemies.<br />
It reads: " Those heroes that shed their blood and lost their<br />
IL-oo you avo snetp 1iv in * ho: coil ^ F a f4" I<br />
country. Therefore rest in peace. There is no<br />
difference between the Johnnies and the Mehmets to us<br />
where they lie side by side here in this country of<br />
ours You, the mothers who sent their sons from far<br />
away countries, wipe away your tears; your sons are now<br />
lying in our bosoms and are in peace. After having lost<br />
their lives on this land they have become our sons as<br />
well".<br />
These same words are inscribed on the memorial stone at<br />
Anzac Cove.<br />
We have also named a part of the Northern Shore of<br />
Canberra's Lake Burley Griffin, " Gallipoli Reach" and the<br />
entrance to Princess Royal Harbour in Albany, Western<br />
Australia, from where the ANZACs sailed, " Ataturk Entrance".<br />
Thoa oo* io airmbolA., o * ho S^". Aw raa'o aeA fr-ini~ ahip<br />
which unite our nations, reinforced over the past twenty or<br />
so years by migration from Turkey to Australia.<br />
There are now over 60,000 people of Turkish origin in<br />
Australia. The members of this community are making a<br />
valuable contribution to Australia's multicultural society<br />
and I an delighted that so many Turks have chosen to make<br />
Australia their hone.<br />
I myself have the honour of representing over 3,000 members<br />
of the Turkish community who live in my own constituency in<br />
Melbourne. mr Prime Minister, the talks I have had today with President<br />
Ozal and yourself reflect the maturity of the relationship<br />
which has developed between our two countries. Accordingly,<br />
our widz ranging diaeueeaioro covorod tho full aoopo of<br />
political, economic and trade issues of mutual interest,<br />
including the rapid pace of change in Europe and the USSR,<br />
developments in the Middle East, the need for a just<br />
resolution f or Cyprus, and human rights.<br />
I have been particularly impressed by the reports I have<br />
seen and by what I have heard here in Ankara on the<br />
South-Eastern Anatolia ( GAP) Project which will be one of<br />
the world's great agricultural engineering feats. Australian 6929 </p>
<p>companies are actively seeking to participate in this<br />
project and assist in bringing it to successful completion.<br />
It is indicative of the importance my Government attaches to<br />
the further development of trade with Turkey that tomorrow,<br />
in Istanbul, I will open a new Australian Consulate-General<br />
and Trade Commission Office.<br />
With the signature of the Trade and Economic Cooperation<br />
Agreement between Australia and Turkey in 1988 we now have a<br />
mechanism for regular consultations on trade and economic<br />
cooperatioa&amp;. w luuk CuLward Lu wuluuming a Turkish<br />

for the first round of consultations under the Agreement.<br />
Mr Prime Minister, we are indebted to you for the great<br />
generosity and cooperation shown by the Turkish Government<br />
at all levels in making this pilgr mage possible. There<br />
could not be a stronger testimony to the nature of the<br />
relationship between our countries than this visit we<br />
Australians are making, the reason for that visit, and the<br />
circumstances we attach to it.<br />
I believe one can search the annals of war and not find a<br />
parallel the honour, care and respect shown to the memory<br />
of a departed enemy by a people who were defending<br />
themselves against an invaderl and seventy five years later,<br />

to be the honoured guests of that people.<br />
This in itself contains a great tribute to the spirit of the<br />
people of Turkey.<br />
Mr Prime Minister, the mutual respect between our nations<br />
which was forged on the battlefields of Gallipoli has proved<br />
to be a sound and enduring foundation for the warm and<br />
substantial relationship which has developed between us, a<br />
relationship which I am confident will continue to develop<br />
and deepen in the years to come.<br />
