    <content><![CDATA[<p>JONES:</p>
<p>The Prime Minister is on the line. Prime Minister, good morning.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Good morning, Alan.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>Thank you for your time. Simon Crean said yesterday this - if the Prime Minister thought that the allegations of rape was an appropriate basis for the Governor General to stand aside today, then why did he not demand this in December last year when he was first told of the allegation by Dr Hollingworth, or in March this year when the application was made to the Victorian Supreme Court.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, there's a very different set of circumstances. Back in December when I was told about it, it was a bare allegation. On the face of it, it seemed extraordinary, an allegation of that kind emphatically and totally denied. It, in December, was merely an allegation contained in a letter from a solicitor. I, in fact, at that time gave consideration to how the matter might be handled if ultimately it turned into a full-blown court case. Now, at the time, it was made public and bear in mind that a lot of confidential information comes in to a Prime Minister's hands, a lot of allegations are made against people and if you get to a situation in this country where the mere making of an allegation can bring about a person standing aside no matter who that person is, then I think you run the risk of making the place ungovernable. Now, what occurred was that the letter was written by a lawyer, it was shown to me by the Governor General, he said this is absurd; he then subsequently gave me his full story. I took some advice, I don't think it's appropriate to go into that at this stage. Then we watched the matter proceed. The question of the suppression order, well in the end that was a decision taken by the Governor General having sought his own counsel. We did discuss the pros and cons of that and in the end I said to him that he had rights as a citizen, like anybody else, and he had to take his own counsel. He now had injected into... the court case has been injected into the other controversy and plainly, it created a situation that was quite different from the situation in December.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>Do you have some concern though that in the presentation of all of this, sometimes the facts aren't presented which seems to be designed to be disadvantageous to the Governor General? I mean, the suppression order, for example, was first taken out by this poor unfortunate woman, wasn't it?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>That's my understanding, yes.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>And, indeed, you would be aware of the allegations now, or the confirmation of the Brotherhood of St Laurence that the affidavit alleging this act by Peter Hollingworth was confirmed or supported by a picture of Peter Hollingworth in the Brotherhood of St Laurence News in June of 1964, that's contained in the affidavit by the unfortunate lady and yet, in the June 1964 newsletter of the Brotherhood of St Laurence there is no picture of Peter Hollingworth.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I've been told that, yes.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>So, what does this say for public office in this country? I mean, for example, you've now got a federal frontbencher indicating, which has caused this to erupt, that he would place questions on notice about the rumoured suppression orders involving the Governor General when Parliament resumes this week. So in other words, the Member of Parliament seeking to subvert the processes of the court for whatever reason. Is that an acceptable way that the public would view the performance of Members of Parliament?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I don't think it is. I mean, once a suppression order was made, everybody is obliged to obey it and it seems highly improbable, to say the least, that Mr Tanner wouldn't put those questions on notice or talked about putting them on notice if he hadn't been told of this by somebody. Now, that somebody has clearly breached the terms of the suppression order. Now, Mr Tanner knows who it is but Mr Tanner will have to answer to that. I mean, you talk about questions on notice, there are a few questions that ought to be put on notice for Tanner.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>Just hang on, I'm just wondering... you seemed to have faded there...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I felt the...</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>Here we are, we're right then.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Am I back now? I don't want to fade on you, Alan.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>No, not at all. We're back to again now. You made the point that there should be some questions put on notice about [inaudible], such as?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I mean, I would like to know who informed Mr Tanner? What was he told? Did he discuss this with Mr Crean? Why didn't he, if he was genuinely concerned about the issue, generally concerned about the interests of the parties, he could have made a private inquiry of my office. And, you know, it is possible in our system of Government when information of his kind comes into your possession and you have some appreciation of its sensitivity, it is possible to make private inquiries, even of your dreaded political enemies, to establish what the real situation is. And, of course, it's further compounded tragically by the poor lady's death.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, on that question of the lady's death, it's obvious that she sought the suppression order for a variety of reasons, which most probably not germane to the question I'm going to ask you. But nonetheless she did commit suicide when it appears to have become apparent to her that the secrecy she sought had been breached or was about to be breached, which would spiral her into publicity that she obviously feared. Surely at the end of the day, someone's got to answer a few questions about this?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I'm not aware of whether that description is accurate, I'm not saying it's wrong, I'm just not aware of that. And unless and until I am aware of it, I don't want to answer that question.</p>
<p>JONES:  Well, the Greens leader, Bob Brown, I mean we're talking about an individual Australian here, and you constantly said, and we'd all believe that the presumption of innocence is certainly valid and equally, in all of these things you have to try to be fair and consistent. Bob Brown, the Greens leader, seems to have an opinion on most things, says the decision taken yesterday didn't address the wider issue that of - quote, </p>
