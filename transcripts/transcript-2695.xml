PRIME MINISTER<br />
MACQUARIE NETWORK WEEKLY BROADCAST<br />
BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE RT. HON.<br />
WILLIAM McMAHON 1I,_ MP.<br />
UNEMPLOYMENT FIGURES 18 OCTOBER 1972<br />
Interviewer Paul Lynch<br />
* Prime Minister, some weeks ago in your weekly<br />
report on Macquarie stations you said that you would be<br />
pleased with the unemployment figures to be released<br />
this week and that they would be figures not capable of<br />
misinterpretation. The figures have come out and evidently<br />
people on your side of the House in Canberra are very pleased<br />
with them. I wonder what you would like to say about these<br />
figures now that they are public?<br />
PM: I want to confirm what you have said that most<br />
people would have to be pleased with them because both in<br />
actual numbers, that is, the fact themselves, there was a<br />
substantial reduction in unemployment, and as well, there was<br />
a reduction in the numbers of people seasonally unemployed.<br />
And as I think I pointed out on that occasion, you didn't<br />
want to take too much notice of seasonally unemployed figures.<br />
They are for the experts and not for the ordi! r., ry person,<br />
the average person, because the average person wants to look<br />
at the numbers and the facts, and doesn't want to care too<br />
much about analysis.<br />
Q. There was, of course, a lot of speculation about<br />
the improvement you are talking about. A lot of people said<br />
the figure would be something like 5,000 more people that is<br />
of course about 8,000. Were you, yourself, surprised that the<br />
decrease in unemployed was so great?<br />
PM: Yes. I thought that it would be about 5,000 and<br />
I had taken the view that unless it was more than 4,500, we<br />
would have to take some supplementary action to reduce the<br />
numbers. When it turned out a reduction of 8,000, I can assure<br />
you I was delighted. ./ 2 </p>
