SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
ANNIVERSARY OF THE FOUNDATION OF<br />
AMNIESTY INTERNATIONAL<br />
CANBERRA 28 MAY 1991<br />
Ministerial eand Parliamentary Colleagues<br />
Members of Amnesty International<br />
Friends Thirty years ago today an article appeared in a London<br />
newspaper written by a British lawyer, Peter Benenson. A<br />
defence lawyer for political prisoners in Hungary, South<br />
Africa and Spain and a human rights campaigner, Benenson<br />
began his article with these words:<br />
" Open your newspaper any day of the week and you will<br />
find a report from somewhere in the world of someone<br />
being imprisoned, tortured or executed because his<br />
opinions or religion are unacceptable to the<br />
government."<br />
He continued " The newspaper reader feels a sickening sense of<br />
impotence. Yet if these feelings of disgust all over<br />
the world could be united into common action, something<br />
effective could be done."<br />
Just a few weeks after the appearance of that newspaper<br />
article, Benenson spoke on Australian radio. Over fifty<br />
listeners immediately wrote asking what they could do to<br />
help. This response was repeated worldwide, and from the<br />
idea of a single individual grew a movement which today has<br />
over one million members, subscribers and regular donors in<br />
over 150 countries, together with over 4,200 local volunteer<br />
groups. I<br />
In Australia, Amnesty International has over 30,000 members<br />
and supporters; and 180 local groups.<br />
Peter Benenson' s message stemmed from a simple belief in the<br />
dignity and riLghts of all human beings to express their own<br />
beliefs free of the threat of physical abuse or<br />
intimidation. </p>
<p>This belief still forms the basis of Amnesty International's<br />
charter today: the immediate and unconditional release of all<br />
' prisoners of conscience';<br />
fair and prompt trial for all political prisoners;<br />
and an end to all torture and executions.<br />
Since its inception Amnesty International has been one of<br />
the most consistent and compassionate voices in defence of<br />
human rights across the globe. Over the last three decades<br />
it has taken up more than 42,000 cases.<br />
It was in just recognition of this organisation's<br />
achievement that in 1977 it was awarded the Nobel Prize for<br />
Peace. And only last December, Amnesty helped draw the attention of<br />
the world to the human rights violations by Iraq during its<br />
brutal and illegal occupation of Kuwait and it has continued<br />
to report on the human rights situation in Kuwait.<br />
It is a telling tribute to Amnesty International's<br />
independence and impartiality that it has achieved support<br />
and recognition across the entire political spectrum.<br />
Amnesty International Australia is the first section of the<br />
movement to have a Federal Parliamentary Group, listing<br />
almost two-thirds of MP's as members and having as its<br />
patrons representatives from all parties represented in the<br />
Parliament.<br />
My friends<br />
The success of Amnesty in gaining support in Australia and<br />
throughout the world should not lead us to underestimate the<br />
challenges which still beset those committed to the human<br />
rights cause.<br />
It is estimated that prisoners of conscience are still being<br />
held in nearly half the countries of the world, and in<br />
countries political prisoners can still be held without<br />
charge or trial.<br />
In 1989 torture and ill-treatment of prisoners were reported<br />
in 96 countries. Extrajudicial executions, and death from<br />
torture or ill-treatment in custody, were reported in more<br />
than 40 countries, and ' disappearances' in more than<br />
Political prisoners were detained in at least 92 countries,<br />
and unfair trials in political cases were known to have<br />
taken place in 31 countries.<br />
These statistics point to a litany of injustice and human<br />
rights abuses which continue to occur throughout the world. </p>
<p>But more than that, the figures are evidence that the<br />
principles of hu man rights enshrined in the United Nations<br />
Declaration of 1948 and elaborated on in the many<br />
declarations, covenants and conventions of the United<br />
Nations are still far from being fully accepted throughout<br />
the global community.<br />
And for this reason it is imperative that government and<br />
non-government organisations alike continue to pursue the<br />
cause of hum-an rights.<br />
I think Australia can be proud of its record in this area.<br />
Generations of Australians, and their parliamentary<br />
representatives, have worked to give practical effect to the<br />
principles and spirit of the Universal Declaration both in<br />
our own society and in broader international forums.<br />
It gives me particular pleasure to welcome the many young<br />
people here today who will carry on this great task.<br />
The current positive climate of international realignment<br />
presents, I believe, an historic opportunity to carry this<br />
work forward.<br />
Of course we are unlikely to see a complete end to human<br />
rights abuses. Tensions in many parts of the world require<br />
us to work hard if we are to ensure that the rights to<br />
freedom of expression, economic organisation and selfdetermination<br />
are met in the most humane and peaceable way.<br />
Australia has never accepted the view, still occasionally'<br />
espoused, that action aimed at the improvement of human<br />
rights in some way constitutes intereference in the domestic:<br />
af fairs of individual countries.<br />
Our position on this is now increasingly shared by the<br />
international. community.<br />
We continue t: o be one of the most active countries in the<br />
world pursuing human rights issues on a bilateral basis.<br />
In 1989/ 90, for example, we made direct representations at,<br />
ministerial or official level in relation to 443 different<br />
groups or individuals in 87 different countries.<br />
We have also taken a particular interest in regional issues:<br />
We have expressed our concern about the situation<br />
in Myanmar and, in particular, the failure of the<br />
military to hand over power to a civilian<br />
government. We have made clear our concern about the<br />
continuation of human rights abuses in China and<br />
our continuing concern about the tragic cycle of<br />
violence In Sri Lanka. </p>
<p>We have reached an agreement with the Chinese<br />
Government to send a delegation to that country to<br />
examine and discuss human rights and related<br />
matters an agreement which we hope will be a<br />
first step in developing a serious and<br />
constructive bilateral dialogue on human rights<br />
issues And, while we have acknowledged the overall<br />
improvement in the human rights situation in East<br />
Timor in recent years, we continue to urge that<br />
existing problems be dealt with fairly and<br />
humanely and that domestic and international<br />
concerns be allayed.<br />
Australia's active pursuit of human rights issues is a<br />
cornerstone of our foreign policy, and demonstrates our<br />
intention to be a good international citizen in the full<br />
sense of the term.<br />
It is equally true that we have worked to remedy domestic<br />
human rights concerns.<br />
One area in which Amnesty International has taken an<br />
interest in Australia has been in the treatment and status<br />
of Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders.<br />
The final report of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal<br />
Deaths in Custody was tabled in May by the Minister for<br />
Aboriginal Affairs. This comprehensive report gave<br />
considerable information to the Government indeed to all<br />
,' Australians on the present position of Aborigines in<br />
Australian society today.<br />
Putting it simply, the main finding of the Royal Commission<br />
was that too many Aboriginal people are in custody too<br />
often. In fact they are in custody at a rate, calculated<br />
nationally, 29 times that of the general community.<br />
The Royal Commission report indicts the legal and corrective<br />
services systems in Australia and points to a society-wide<br />
range of Aboriginal disadvantage.<br />
The Government has committed itself to ensuring that there<br />
is a co-ordinated and comprehensive national response to the<br />
Royal Commission's final report.<br />
I have written to all the Premiers and Chief Ministers<br />
seeking their co-operation in a joint strategy of response<br />
and I am confident that the necessary co-operation will be<br />
forthcoming.<br />
We are conscious that there will continue to be considerable<br />
international interest in how all Governments in Australia<br />
and the Australian community as a whole reacts to what the<br />
Royal Commission has to say and how we set about<br />
implementing the recommendations. </p>
<p>Foremost among these, I am sure, will be Amnesty<br />
International. For it is a measure of Amnesty International's credibility<br />
and the breadth of their concern that they will leave no<br />
area of the world untouched and demand nothing less than<br />
universal adherence to their principles.<br />
And it is a measure of the high regard in which Amnesty<br />
International is held by so many people in this country,<br />
that any subject in which Amnesty involves itself<br />
immediately becomes a centre of attention and a very good<br />
reason for governments to take a hard look at their<br />
policies. For that we have good cause for gratitude and I appreciate<br />
the opportunity you have given me today to congratulate<br />
Amnesty International on its thirthieth birthday. </p>
