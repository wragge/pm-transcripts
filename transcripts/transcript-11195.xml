<p><b>PRIME MINISTER:</b></p>
<p>I think you’ve reached a stage now where the Australian people will resolve this, which is as it should be in a free democratic country. I hope they decide to stay with the system that has helped give this country probably the best democracy in the world. But ultimately that is a matter for them, and as I said at the beginning of this, I will respect the outcome and accept it whatever it is. I just think we’ll be better and more secure with the present system.</p>
<p><b>JOURNALIST:</b></p>
<p>The early trend is showing support for the ‘no’ vote. Are you confident it will get up?</p>
<p><b>PRIME MINISTER:</b></p>
<p>Well, I don’t think you take much notice of early trends at polling booths, I just think you wait and see until every vote is counted.</p>
<p><b>JOURNALIST:</b></p>
<p>What about the Australian Rugby Union team tonight?</p>
<p><b>PRIME MINISTER:</b></p>
<p>There we are, now, we can all get together on that – Republicans and anti-republicans alike – and I just want to say to John Eales and all the boys, I along with millions of Australians will be sitting up until the wee hours of the morning cheering them on, and this country will collectively lift its roof if they defeat France, and I reckon they will. It will quite a contest, but they are a great team, and good luck John, you’ve got millions of Australians barracking for you.</p>
<p><b>JOURNALIST:</b></p>
<p>What about the score?</p>
<p><b>PRIME MINISTER:</b></p>
<p>I don’t know about predicting the score, but it will be a great match and it is coming at the right time for them. They’ve played consistently and their victory last weekend was a fantastic effort and a very controlled victory and I think it will be a great contest, the French are not to be taken lightly.</p>
<p><b>JOURNALIST:</b></p>
<p>Are you going to be watching it at home or at a pub….?</p>
<p><b>PRIME MINISTER:</b></p>
<p>I’ll be watching it at home, very eagerly. So it’ll be a very long but exciting night watching the football.</p>
<p><b>JOURNALIST:</b></p>
<p>So you won’t be watching for the outcome of the referendum?</p>
<p><b>PRIME MINISTER:</b></p>
<p>Of course I will.</p>
