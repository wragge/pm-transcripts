<p>Dame Elisabeth Murdoch lived a great Australian life. </p>
<p>Her example of kindness, humility and grace was constant.  She was not only generous, she led others to generosity. </p>
<p>Australia's children and Australia's artists have lost one of their greatest benefactors.</p>
<p> Dame Elisabeth's name will rightly be remembered by countless Australians and in many Australian places where her philanthropic work was so deeply appreciated.</p>
<p>Australia has lost an amazing Australian woman. </p>
<p>As many have recalled today, Dame Elisabeth was the first woman trustee of the National Gallery of Victoria, chair of the committee which established the Victorian Tapestry Workshop, trustee of the regional McClelland Gallery and a benefactor to many including the Australian Ballet, Opera Australia and the Bell Theatre Company.</p>
<p>The death of a parent at any age is one of the saddest moments we endure in life.  Dame Elisabeth's children, grandchildren, great and great-great-grandchildren and her large extended family have lost a beloved matriarch.</p>
<p>On behalf of the Government, I send my condolences to the Murdoch family.</p>
