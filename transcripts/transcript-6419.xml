PRIME MINISTER]<br />
E. O. E. PROOF ONLY<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW WITH IAN McMINT4,-MACQUARIE NE-TWORK<br />
CORRESPONDENT 28 JUNE 1984<br />
McMINN: What I would like to basically talk to you about<br />
Es the union thing in particular and, as I see it, as a<br />
catalyst in many things, Prime Minister, and that is as I see<br />
it, the Labor Party if you are beholden to sectional<br />
interests which are totally impractical and the Labor Party is<br />
not going to achieve in a social reform situation. And that<br />
is my basic position.<br />
Prime Minister, you have been distinctly silent in the last<br />
couple of weeks and there have been many events that people<br />
would regard as set-backs to you. One of the bigger things<br />
that most people are talking about is the fact that the<br />
Victorian branch of the Labor Party last weekend decided that<br />
four right wing unions should not be re-affiliated. Since<br />
then there are appearances that the federal executive would<br />
intervene. So I would like to find out your falling on the<br />
Victorian branch's decision and what the Labor Party should do.<br />
PM: Yes, Ian, before I go to those specific questions that you<br />
aisk, let me make the point in response to your observation<br />
about my silence. I have taken the view that the matters will<br />
be decided at the top levels of the Party at the national<br />
executive or perhaps the national conference and I have not<br />
sought'to go into the great public debate about it, but as,<br />
people now outside the conferences have seen fit to air their<br />
views and like being involved in a lot of the expressions by<br />
others, it seems to me appropriate that I should respond to<br />
your specific question about the unions.<br />
I have made it clear earlier in the year, Ian, that the four<br />
unions involved have a right to be affiliated to the Party.<br />
I have made the distinction between the unions and some<br />
individuals if there are any individuals in respect of whom<br />
it can be established that they are either now or have<br />
recently been associated with some prescribed organisation like<br />
the NCC, then they would have to do the same thing as members<br />
of any other party. They would have to see the time before<br />
they could become members. But the principle regard to the<br />
four unions in my judgement is crystal clear. And that is that<br />
clerks,-. men and women, in Victoria; shop assistants,. men and<br />
women, in Victoria, are entitled through their union, if they so<br />
wish, to be affiliated with this party which is a trade union<br />
based party. Let me make a particular point in regard to the<br />
/ 2 </p>
<p>shop assistants. I must say I find it totally amazing<br />
that the party in Victoria co~ uld have in the State election in 1982<br />
have accepted willingly financial support and the availability<br />
of resources from that union to heavily support the Labor<br />
Party in that 1982 State election and then in the next year<br />
in 1983 happily accepted $ 50,000 from this union. Now, I don't<br />
know where principles start and end if you recognise this<br />
union, accept their support in so substantial form, but say, no,<br />
they are not entitled to be affiliated to the Party.<br />
McMINN: But Prime Minister, aren't we really talking about<br />
authority, now. I mean, you are in the happy position, if<br />
you like, of commanding popularity within the Australian<br />
community. The Labor Party seems to be commanding the same<br />
popularity, but it seems that you have been challenged on the<br />
very thing that could undo you and that is your own credibility<br />
that is are you controlling the Party or is the Party controlling<br />
you? PM: I don't think it is as simple as that. I have never<br />
sought, from the moment I obtained the leadership of the Par:. ty<br />
to say that I controlled the Party, but I believe what is<br />
clear involving your question, I think Ian, that the people of<br />
Australia, given the Party under my leadership and the sort of<br />
support to which you are referring and my leadership is<br />
significant in that. And it is important, I think, that the<br />
people of Australia see that the sorts of principles which I have<br />
clearly enunciated, are accepted by the Party. That doesn't:<br />
mean in any way explicitly or implicitly ' but there can't be. debate or<br />
there shouldn't be debates, about issueIs that on the one ILn<br />
particular that you have raised, the question of rights of<br />
unions to be affiliated to the Labor Party. The principle is<br />
crystal clear. These unions are official, registered unions<br />
which in other states are affiliated with the Party. They<br />
are affiliated with the Trades and Labor Councils. They have<br />
been operating under the law where leaders are there as a result<br />
of democratic elections under the law. Now this Party cannot<br />
get into the position in my judgement where it is going to<br />
have double standards, where you will Say yes it is your right<br />
to have, for instance the builders labourers, for instance a<br />
union which has consistently since we have been in government<br />
fought to try and undermine the Prices and Incomes Accord and<br />
that was the case of a particular union in Victoria. But you<br />
are not going to have another union or unions in because you<br />
don't happen to like their leadership.<br />
McMINN: But aren't you treading on dangerous ground here. It<br />
seems to me the feeling was that you had a successful national<br />
conference and no-one rocked your boat then it would seem to<br />
me from what you are saying and from what other people that. I<br />
have contacted have said, that you are prepared to take it on.<br />
There is a risk, sure, in taking on the Victorian State Branch. </p>
<p>3.<br />
PM: It's not a question of taking on the Victorian State<br />
Br-anch. What is involved in politics it seems to me is to<br />
be prepared in the appropriate forums to argue the case,<br />
the principle. For instance on the question of uranium,<br />
it was put to me in 1979 as we came up to the ACTU Congress<br />
that the clear position that I had was one for which I<br />
wouldn't be able to get the numbers at the ACTU Congress<br />
and indeed some of my friends said, look, we'll put the<br />
resolution bec ause we don't want to see you in a position<br />
where you can't carry it. And I said, look, the position is<br />
clear. The principle is clear and it is right. So I argued<br />
for it. And may I say that in 1979 that I said that I<br />
understood the trade union movement and I knew that they<br />
would support my position and not the position that was<br />
carried and of course I have been proved absolutely correct<br />
on that.<br />
McMINN: Has it hurt you, Prime Minister, to sit back over<br />
the last couple of weeks now and watch what some people could<br />
perceive as the underming of what you have achieved in the<br />
last year or so be the things that people are reading every<br />
day. Does that worry you?<br />
PM: Obviously any political leader would be quite dishonest<br />
37 he didn't acknowledge that he would not rather see a<br />
position where his Party was not engaging in exercises which<br />
could potentially do damage to his Government and obviously I<br />
would be happier if that were not occurring, but I believe that<br />
the people of Australia, as distinct from perhaps some<br />
people who are getting carried away on single issues, of<br />
passionate concern to them, that the people of Australia are<br />
continuing their very very large support for this Government<br />
because they understand what the basic issues are. They<br />
understand that they wanted the economy turned round out of<br />
recession into growth. They understand that under my<br />
Government we now have the highest rate of growth in the<br />
western world.<br />
McMINN: But why don't the people in your Party or some of<br />
the people in your Party understand that?<br />
PM: Well, I think the majority of them do and they will show<br />
That by the way they make their decisions at the conference!, yes.<br />
McMINN: Are you sure about those very key issues, the foreign<br />
banks, Timor and more particularly uranium.<br />
PM: I am confident that common sense will prevail. / 4 i Irl, </p>
<p>4.<br />
McMINN: What are you going to do Prime Minister, to tell the<br />
Australian community that basically this growth of concern at<br />
the grass roots of-the Party does not influence you as a<br />
Government in other words you are still on course with<br />
most Australians.<br />
PM: Well, I think I need to say very little about that.<br />
I mean we have had a series of polls within the last week.<br />
We've had the Gallop Poll out of the Melbourne Herald group<br />
which showed 55% support for the Government which is 5 above<br />
March ' 83 in the election. 73% for myself, we've had the<br />
Bulletin this week showing a 53% support for the Government,<br />
still very, very much up above the election and over for<br />
myself. Interestingly in that, well over 90% support of Labor<br />
vote is for myself. So,. these things are there and people understan~ d<br />
them I believe.<br />
McMINN: So, I guess on the Tuesday address to the Conference<br />
you'll be talking about the achievements of this Labor Government.<br />
Is there any possibility that you'll also talk to the Part),<br />
or the broad mass of Australianson the basis that you are ILn<br />
control?<br />
PM: I think that is understand. Certainly, my speech will<br />
cover a wide range of issues Ian. I don't want to and I know<br />
you don't expect me to canvass them in detail, but I'll<br />
certainly be . going to the achievements of the Government, and<br />
the confidence the Australian people have in the Government.<br />
And the importance therefore for the Party, this goes back<br />
to one of your earlier questions importance for the Party<br />
to not do anything which is going to in any significant way<br />
undermine-the basis of that support.<br />
McMINN: Specifically, if I can go to. Thursday and Friday of<br />
the National Executive what do you think is a reasonable outcome.<br />
Do you think that two of the unions should be re-affiliated,<br />
do you think that the four of them should? Do you take on the<br />
Victorian Branch, what are the mechanics of it as you see iLt?<br />
PM: Oh well, the mechanics are I believe that there are already<br />
a couple of appeals in, or on their way as I have been informed<br />
by the-Secretary, and the Executive therefore will discuss it<br />
It is quite clear and that the principles that I have referred<br />
to in my.: earlier answers to your questions are universal.<br />
I don't think they allow distinction.<br />
McI4INN: Can I ask you one final thing Mr Hawke, and that is<br />
Mr Hartley standing. f or the number 3 spot in Victoria. Is it<br />
wise? PM: I believe that the Victorian Branch will make the right<br />
decision in this matter.<br />
McMINN: But you wouldn't like to see him there?<br />
PM: Well, let's not discuss hypothetical questions. He's not<br />
a candidate. As I say I believe that the Victorian Branch will<br />
make the correct decision. </p>
