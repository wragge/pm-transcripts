FOR PRESS 15 FEBRUARY 1977<br />
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AID FOR VICTORIAN BUSHFIRE VICTIMS<br />
The Federal Government will provide direct and significant<br />
assistance to families hit following last weekend's serious<br />
bushfires in Western Victoria.<br />
The Federal Government will assist in four key areas. The<br />
Government will:<br />
Meet the full cost of the disposal and burial<br />
of dead and maimed stock<br />
Provide special funds for replacement of boundary<br />
fences along highways and railway lines<br />
Provide loans of up to $ 15,000 to help meet the<br />
difference between insurance cover and the<br />
replacement cost of property<br />
Remove a State Government restriction that specifies<br />
the transport of fodder by road is not subsidised<br />
if it comes within 40 miles of the disaster area.<br />
A senior officer from the Department of the Prime Minister and<br />
Cabinet held discussions with State officials on the spot on<br />
Saturday ( February 12) so that unnecessary red tape could be<br />
avoided.<br />
The Government has been concerned that aid gets to the area<br />
quickly, without fuss and without delay. This is being done,<br />
and agreement has been reached with the Government of Victoria.<br />
The Hamilton office of Telecom have been working round the clock<br />
to repair lines and . nstal phones in many areas.<br />
Four field officers from the Hamilton office of the Department<br />
of Social Security including a social worker have also been<br />
in Streatham and are providing much needed assistance in that<br />
district.<br />
I wish to pay special tribute to the firefighters and relief<br />
workers who worked tirelessly over the weekend to comb-at the<br />
bushfire. / Background </p>

Background The Commonwealth has a major role in the relief of<br />
natural disasters.<br />
It provides funds for the immediate relief of personal<br />
hardship and distress at a dollar for dollar basis with<br />
the State Government. It also meets all State expenditure<br />
necessitated by major disasters in excess of a set figure<br />
which in the case of Victoria is $ 3.5 million a year.<br />
As well as personal hardship and distress, disaster relief<br />
covers grants for the restoration of Government, local<br />
Government and semi-Governmental assets and facilities.<br />
It also covers loan assistance on concessional terms<br />
for primary producers to enable them to get back into<br />
operation. </p>
