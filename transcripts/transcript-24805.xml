    <content><![CDATA[<p>In recent days, for obvious and understandable reasons, there has been a great deal of concern on all sides of this Parliament about the unfolding humanitarian crisis on the borders of Syria.</p>
<p>I deeply respect the contributions that Members of Parliament have made and I now wish to update the House on decisions that the Government has taken to respond.</p>
<p>Obviously, Mr Speaker, all of us were shocked as a nation at the disaster that we saw on our television screens and all of us as a nation wanted to help.</p>
<p>If I may say so, Mr Speaker, that’s the Australian way: when we see a problem we roll up our sleeves and do what we can to help.</p>
<p>That’s what we have always done.</p>
<p>Collectively and individually, at home and abroad, that's always what we have done.</p>
<p>But it is important, Mr Speaker, as always to think before we act and it is important that the Government has considered the report from Minister Dutton in Europe and spoken to our expert advisers and officials here in Australia in preparing this response.</p>
<p>As the House knows, Minister Dutton consulted with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees. He also spoke to senior representatives of the International Organisation of Migration and the Red Cross.</p>
<p>It was obvious after discussions in Europe that the immediate need in order to help people stranded on the borders of Syria is for more money.</p>
<p>It's also obvious from discussions in Europe and here at home that there are many, many people, members of persecuted minorities currently displaced from their ancestral homes, who will never ever be able to go back to their homes in Syria.</p>
<p>So, I can announce today, Mr Speaker, that the Government will make available an additional $44 million.</p>
<p>This will assist some 240,000 people currently in camps with food, clothing and shelter as winter approaches and this will take the total Australian Government contribution – humanitarian contribution – to people on the borders of Syria and Iraq under the former government and under this Government to some $230 million.</p>
<p>I can also advise the House, Mr Speaker, that we will take an additional 12,000 people from the Syria-Iraq conflict over and above our existing refugee and humanitarian programme.</p>
<p>This is an important and generous act by Australia.</p>
<p>I stress that we are taking people who are persecuted minorities.</p>
<p>We are determined to prioritise women, children and families on the borders of Syria in Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan.</p>
<p>All of the people that we bring will be subject to the usual health, security and character checks. We will bring people as quickly as we can, but we do owe to it the Australian people to get these checks done and to bring people in in ways that resettlement services can cope.</p>
<p>Why are we doing this, Mr Speaker? We’re doing this because people are suffering.</p>
<p>And why are they suffering? In part, Mr Speaker, they’re suffering because of the activities of the Daesh death cult.</p>
<p>We have seen on our screens what this death cult has done. We have seen the beheadings, the crucifixions, the mass executions, the sexual slavery. We have recoiled in horror from our screens as we have seen the new and ever more barbaric ways of killing people that this death cult has devised.</p>
<p>As Members know, our armed forces have been engaged in military operations in Iraq for the best part of 12 months. In particular, the Royal Australian Air Force has been conducting air strikes against Daesh targets in Iraq.</p>
<p>At the invitation, at the request of President Obama, the Government has decided to extend our airstrikes to include Daesh targets in Syria as well.</p>
<p>We are doing this under Section 51 of the UN Charter which gives countries the right of collective self-defence.</p>
<p>Iraq is threatened by Daesh forces based and supplied from Syria and Syria is unable or unwilling to act against those forces. So, in conjunction with our coalition partners Australia will act.</p>
<p>Can I say, Mr Speaker, that I am proud of the work of our armed forces who, as always, have acted in our name and under our flag with courage, professionalism and commitment.</p>
<p>But, most of all, may I say, Mr Speaker, I am proud of our country.</p>
<p>Today, we act decently in the best traditions of the Australian people.</p>
