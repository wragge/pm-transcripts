Prime Minister Julia Gillard and Indigenous Affairs Minister Jenny Macklin today announced the Government's next steps to improve the future of Indigenous Australians living in the Northern Territory.</p>
<p>Over the last four years we have made significant progress in improving people's lives in the Northern Territory, but the situation for many Indigenous families remains critical.</p>
<p>The Gillard Government will now start consultation on future plans to tackle this unacceptable level of disadvantage with a particular focus on improved education for children, expanded employment opportunities and tackling alcohol abuse.</p>
<p>We know that a stronger future can only be built in partnership with Aboriginal people and communities, because the issues we want to tackle are the issues which many Indigenous people confront every single day.</p>
<p>The Government's new discussion paper, Stronger Futures in the Northern Territory, will form the basis of this conversation over the coming months as the Northern Territory Emergency Response (NTER) winds up in mid next year.</p>
<p>The paper looks at where the previous response worked, where it could be improved and what the future priorities are including:</p>
<p> * 	School attendance and educational achievement<br />
 * 	Economic development and employment<br />
 * 	Tackling alcohol abuse<br />
 * 	Community safety<br />
 * 	Health<br />
 * 	Food security<br />
 * 	Housing<br />
 * 	Governance</p>
<p>Our unprecedented investment in the Northern Territory is beginning to change the lives of thousands of Indigenous people living in over 70 remote communities, town camps and urban communities through improved services, better houses and safer and healthier communities.</p>
<p>Feedback from these communities to date is that people now feel safer, children are being better cared for, alcohol and gambling abuse is lessening and indigenous job opportunities are improving.</p>
<p>But there is no quick fix to overcoming entrenched disadvantage.  It will take time, investment and a commitment to work together to deliver lasting improvements.</p>
<p>It is our intention to ensure that consultation is genuine and involves the advice and experience of people on the ground.</p>
<p>The Government will now hold one-on-one and group meetings across remote communities, regional centres and in town camps in the Northern Territory.</p>
