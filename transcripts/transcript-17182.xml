The Rudd Government will invest $8.3 million to enhance cancer care infrastructure at Bundaberg Hospital, as part of the Central Integrated Regional Cancer Service.</p>
<p>With some cancers, patients from rural areas are up to three times more likely to die within five years of diagnosis than their counterparts. The $8.3 million investment in Bundaberg will work towards improving the services and care for the more than 18,400 Queensland residents diagnosed with cancer each year.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Kevin Rudd made the announcement at Bundaberg Hospital, and said it will allow for an additional 14 chemotherapy chairs.</p>
<p>This service will help give Queenslanders with cancer, the care they need as close to home and family as possible.</p>
<p>Cancer services provided at Bundaberg will work together with the Rockhampton Hospital, where the Prime Minister yesterday announced a $67 million investment in additional radiotherapy bunkers and 16 chemotherapy chairs.</p>
<p>While Australia has better overall cancer survival rates than comparable countries, there is still unacceptable variation for some people, depending on the type of cancer, a person's socioeconomic status or where they live.</p>
<p>It is of great concern that for the 30 per cent of Australians living in rural and remote areas, outcomes are worse than for people living in the city.</p>
<p>The Central Integrated Regional Cancer Service forms part of the Rudd Government's $560 million investment in regional cancer centres across Australia. Since coming into office, the Government has committed over $2.3 billion in cancer infrastructure, medicines, screening and research.</p>
<p>Today's announcement also shows the benefit of the Federal Government stepping up to the plate and providing funding for health services across Australia.</p>
<p>Under the National Health and Hospitals Network, the Rudd Government would provide 60 per cent of the funding for capital upgrades for public hospitals.</p>
<p>The Rudd Government's plan will see health services funded nationally and run locally through local hospital networks to deliver better outcomes for local communities. </p>
