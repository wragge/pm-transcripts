INTERVIEW WITH DEREK 6ALLANTYNE ( 3AW) 5 December 1985<br />
B. Priority One off and running, is it going to have some really<br />
concrete worth when it's all over and done with?<br />
U. There's no question about that, Priority One is not going to be over<br />
and done With, this is not something that we've just conceived for<br />
IYY 1985. It is a continuing program, which emphasises as it says<br />
the priority which this Gov't gives to the issues of youth. And it<br />
has a number of elements, perhaps the most significant in a sense is<br />
the new concept of traineeships which introduces a quite revolutionary<br />
new idea of vocational training in this country, Derek, which is<br />
directed towards those young people who have been leaving the<br />
education system early. If they get employment they're going into<br />
dead end jobs with no training provided. Now we'll be moving to<br />
have a situation where by 1988 we'll have 75,000 of these traineeships<br />
which will mean that young people will go in for jobs and not simply<br />
do the particular jobs that they are recruited for but on the job<br />
will get training for a wider range of responsibilities and for a<br />
quarter of the year will be offered full time training in TAFE<br />
institutions or their equivalent. So that we will gradually change<br />
the situation where so many of our young people have moved into dead<br />
end positions, where the community has ceased it's obligations to them<br />
in: terms of education and training and their continuation of the"<br />
responsibility of the community so that we will gradually create a<br />
strongeri more skill based young workforce which will be good for<br />
the Australian economy but most importantly will be good for young<br />
people themselves. Also aspart of Priority-One we're undertaking a<br />
rationalisation of youth income support payments so'that in two or<br />
three years we will have eliminated the existing financiallidincentives<br />
that has built over the years for people to go on unemployment<br />
benefits rather than to remain in education On education allowances.<br />
And we will also be consolidating a number of youth training programs,<br />
which will be community based programs, and also giving added emphasis<br />
within the CES to have youth centres within the CES so that young<br />
people when they leave school and are looking at what is available to<br />
them in the workforce and in terms of training opportunities will<br />
have a centralised fooAs within the CES centres to be able to be<br />
informed of services available to them. In all these ways we can see<br />
that this is a continuing program, already the evidence is that the </p>
<p>2<br />
concept is being warmly embraced by the young people themselves and<br />
by the community. ' for youth<br />
B. Now Mr. Hawke there were a number of temporary job schemes~ in the<br />
past, but you seem to be moving away from those, because they did<br />
not offer in the long term any real hope for the young?<br />
H. When we came to Government we inherited a situation where there was<br />
a whole hotch-potch of unrelated unco-ordinated programs in the<br />
area of temporary job schemes, training programs. What we've done<br />
as a result of having the Kirby inquiry and the OECD group coming<br />
here is toh then making a series of decisions which co-ordinate the<br />
programs. And there will--be moze 6mphasis on trying to have programs<br />
which create a capacity within young people to be better equipped to<br />
take on full time employment, or if not full time employment a<br />
combination of employment graonudp training and education.<br />
B. I was addressing a school~ yesterday about careers as a matter of fact,<br />
and talking to some of those kids afterwards they did appear<br />
still to have a little bit of bitterness, of disillusionment there<br />
about their life and times. They felt that staying at school, leaving<br />
in the next year or { w they still didn't have any.. great<br />
confidence that there was much out there waiting for them.<br />
H. There's still some of that but if you make a comparison Derek with<br />
the beginning of ' 83 when we came to Office there was almost total<br />
black despa ir st youth. That has been very largely removed2And<br />
the evidenceas to why there should be more optimism with significantly..<br />
reduced unemployment in this country, including unemployment amongst<br />
young people.' There's been a significant increase in the number of<br />
jobs available for them. And they see that with this co-ordinated<br />
program w're going to be making it more worthwhile for young people<br />
to stay in education. We're not only just spending money on these<br />
things to lift allowances and to make more places, there will be<br />
20,000 additional places in this coming training in tertiary<br />
institutions. Something like an additional 75-85,000 places<br />
in TAFE, but we are also giving effect to the recommendations of<br />
the Committee of Inquiry headed by Prof. Karmel to look at the<br />
quality of our primary and secondary education system, because one of<br />
the problems of the past has been the education system hasn't been<br />
intirely relevant to the needs of young people and the needs of<br />
industry And in the resource agreement that we're negotiating with<br />
the State we are sure that in the coming years there will be an<br />
. ww </p>
<p>improvement in the quality of the output Of oUr education system.<br />
B. in your phone-in program-I'ib sure you're going to relieve a lotI<br />
of frustration because the young do have ideas and very bright ideas,<br />
what they didn't have, and what they didn't have up till-now, is<br />
anyone to listen to them.<br />
H. Well that's right Derek. I mean I've been fairly close ' to young<br />
people right through my public life-, and one of the things that<br />
became increasingly clear to me was that they did have this feeling<br />
that we oldies were standing of f and saying, we know what theI<br />
problems were and practically what the answers were and tending to<br />
impose solutions upon them without involving them in our consideration<br />
of what should happen. So that's why I promised in my address to<br />
the Nation in August that while we would accept our responsibility<br />
to start these new moves, I then wanted tq be able to listen to<br />
the young people of Aus. to get th4exr ideas, and we will. This is not<br />
iom6 cosmetic exercise1 the whole of the phone-in program is<br />
computerised, we will have then at the end of it,. in addition to<br />
my direct opportunity of listening to young people all the phone-ins<br />
ideas 11ials I say be comnputerised and brought together and to<br />
the extnt that ve see things out of that which lead us to the<br />
conclusion that certain aspects of what we're doing should be<br />
modified, those modifications will be made.<br />
B. Given that youLte suye to get many ideas good ones and bad ones,<br />
in fct illhavethefinl . determining<br />
who ifatwlhaetefnlresponsibility in . which ones<br />
will be taken up?<br />
H. Well, it won't be just our responsibility we will arrange to have<br />
consultations with the representative Council of Youth, we'll be<br />
talking with them and they will have access to the results of the<br />
phone-in and so we here in Gov't in consultation with the representa-'.-<br />
tives of youth will then consider all the material.<br />
B. Now you're not going to be able to please everyone I guess it's a<br />
fact of political life that you can never achieve that result, but<br />
I wonder if you feel that the other end of the scale, I'm talkingI<br />
about the unemployed in their 50' s for instance. A lot of those<br />
people feel a bit worthless they feel they've been dumped on the<br />
scrap heap and there is no future for them. I wonder If there'd<br />
be a tinge of bitterness at that end of the scale about what you're<br />
doing for youth?<br />
H. I don't think so at all for two reasons, the older people in this<br />
country are parents &amp; hd they take the view that the most important<br />
asset Of this country i~ s our young people they want us to have<br />
C. S7. </p>
<p>-4-<br />
a priority for addressing the needs of young people. The second<br />
point of course is that whi16 this is priority One that doesn't<br />
mean there aren't other priorities; and programs in the area of<br />
re-training and job creation, ate relevant for that older age sector<br />
as well so * e are very substantially increasing both the number of<br />
jobs available in the community which wi1~ eb~ efit to older people<br />
as well, but also having relevance to training and re-training<br />
programs which are going to assist them.<br />
B. I did hear a discussion the other day, somebody arguing that we<br />
should get politics off the front pagewell they'd be very disappointe<br />
today, because I noticed in all the Melbourne papers the name<br />
Haewke crops up in the Headlines. You've " Go softly on super" and<br />
you're supposed to be jumping on the ACTO over super. Is this a<br />
matter of that much concern to you?<br />
1. I want the community to understand, business and trade unionsthat<br />
we have, in co-operation wi6th the trade unions, over the past two<br />
and three quarter years. through the processes of the Accord, turned<br />
this economy around from one of being in the worst recession for<br />
years to one where: i, 51k now having very significant economic<br />
growth and record employment creation. Now there is nothing to be<br />
done which is going to Jeopardise that, and the Accord provides ways*<br />
in which the productivity increise that is available will be<br />
impleniented-. by way of superannuation. And that should be done<br />
by negotiation, unions and employers. And I have Mr Keating today<br />
meeting with the ACTU and next week going to be meeting with<br />
representatives of the employers, after those discussions with Unions<br />
and Employers we will then establish the guidelines for the<br />
implementation of the new occupational superannuation. It's important<br />
that thi~ s great benefit, the benefit not only for employees but<br />
it's going to be very benefiCial for industry as well. Because it's<br />
going to mean that we'll get a greater degree of mobility in our<br />
work force. Up till now there-would have been a hesitation in many I<br />
areas of the workforce about moving to other jobs because they would<br />
have thought they ' d lose the benefit of existing superannuation which.<br />
didn'L encourage portability with it. Well under this development<br />
that we have now and the extension of superannuation we'll have a<br />
more mobile workforce which is going to be of benefit to industry.<br />
B. The Headline in the Australian for instance has Hawke, Keating, Willis<br />
jumping on the ACTU, that sort of smacks of confrontation looming<br />
over thiLs issue?<br />
1. No not confrontation, there's no confrontation looming in any sense.<br />
-w t Of 4 </p>
<p>What has been accepted very very generally by the trade union<br />
movement is that there will be negotiation, that there won't be<br />
any implementation of this before July 1 of 1986, it will be spread<br />
over two years and that is overwhelmingly accepted by the trade<br />
union movement.<br />
B. Do your views differe from those of Mr. Keatingon the how the ACTU<br />
should handle this situation?<br />
No. it's very Interesting on that point to see that Mr. Noakes of the<br />
CAI concedes that if you look fully at what Mr Keating said, you<br />
can't assert that he was supporting Industrial Action and indeed as<br />
Mr Keating made It perfectly clear yesterday he is not supporting<br />
or condoning industrial action in support of super claims.<br />
B. And finally Mr. Hawke in the Age I noticed that Michelle Grattan<br />
talks about you winding down after a tough year, has it been tough? 7<br />
H. Oh yes, you couldn't have had it tougher first half of the year than<br />
I had, I was, as put it, incarcerated here in Canberra on the<br />
preparation of the May Statement which was a hell of a lot of hard<br />
work in that. We were cutting through expenditure programs, saving<br />
about 1 Billion dollars. Then there was the whole tax package that<br />
was<br />
Aworking on it, and then preparation for the Budget. So the first<br />
half of this year was a murderous period and I couldn't Tccept that<br />
there'Id ever had a harder six months or so than that, but4 not any in<br />
sense complaining about that, it's true that I'glad-thefcend of the<br />
year is coming, we're in excellent shape and I'm looking forward to f<br />
a bit of a break to do some reading, swimming, perhaps a bit of<br />
fishing, some golf.<br />
B. SO Priority one the Youth of Aus. and maybe Priority One and Half<br />
abit of a rest eh?<br />
H. That's fairly put Derek yeah.<br />
