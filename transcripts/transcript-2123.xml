FEDERAL ELECTIONS 1969<br />
POLICY SPEECH<br />
PRESENTED BY THE PRIME MINISTER,<br />
MR. JOHN GORTON<br />
NOT FOR RELEASE BY ANY MEDIA UNTIL 8 P. M.<br />
WEDNESDAY 8 OCTOBER<br />
EMBARGOED. EMBARGOED </p>
<p>INTRODUCTION: A little less than twenty years ago the Australian people<br />
dismissed a Labor Government and installed a Liberal/ Country Party<br />
coalition. They were tired of controls, for the sake of controls. They<br />
were dismayed by unemployment and general strikes. They were frightened<br />
of the doctrinaire socialist approach of a Labor Party strongly influenced<br />
by communist unions. They were sick of stagnation.<br />
So they turned to us who believe the individual is the basis<br />
of the state, and that the state will best progress if the individual is given<br />
the greatest possible amount of freedom and of opportunity to take risks<br />
and to reap rewards. Since that time Australia has progressed at a rate before<br />
undreamt of.<br />
In the last ten years alone our exports have doubled.<br />
Our work force has grown from under four to over five<br />
million and they are fully employed.<br />
There has been, and there continues to be, a spectacular<br />
rate of growth due to a high rate of capital inflow, yet<br />
inflation has been kept in check.<br />
A little less than two years ago, I became the Leader of<br />
the Liberal/ Country Party coalition, at a time when Australia was faced<br />
with new problems and changing situations at home and abroad. And I<br />
report to you that, in less than two years, we have done much.<br />
We have decided that even though Britain withdraws from<br />
our North we shall keep ground, sea and air forces there<br />
as a visible expression of our continuing interest in helping<br />
to preserve that region against possible external attack.<br />
For we believe that to meet our needs at home we must<br />
be prepared to accept insofar as our power allows<br />
our responsibilities abroad. We cannot choose one, and<br />
reject the other. We must try to meet both our<br />
responsibilities or we may meet neither.<br />
In 1968/ 69 our economic growth, at 8. 7 per cent at constant<br />
prices, has been greater than at any previous period in<br />
our history.<br />
Last year dwelling construction reached an all-time record<br />
with 138, 000 commencements and 130, 000 completions. / 2<br />
L </p>

* More migrants were brought to Australia than in any previous<br />
year.<br />
* We have removed the financial fear of those faced with long-term<br />
illnesses in hospitals.<br />
* We have increased the basic rates of all social welfare pensions<br />
by unparalleled amounts.<br />
* We have introduced a tapered means test and provided taxation<br />
concessions as an incentive to saving and to thrift.<br />
* We have provided greatly increased sums for education and<br />
have broken through the cobwebbed barrier which previously<br />
prevented us helping the running costs of independent schools.<br />
* We have made known the terms and conditions which we expect<br />
overseas investors to observe when contemplating new<br />
ventures in the development of Australia.<br />
* We have sought to protect Australian-owned companies from<br />
unfair take-over offers.<br />
* We have established an overseas shipping line so that Australian<br />
produce can begin to be carried in Australian ships and so<br />
that we will know what are fair freights to charge Australian<br />
producers.<br />
* We have added half a billion dollars to funds available for roads<br />
and ensured that much of this money will go to alleviate the<br />
urban traffic problems which have been clogging our cities.<br />
I have given a necessarily brief and incomplete account of<br />
our stewardship over the last twenity months. And I am proud that we have<br />
achieved what we have.<br />
As a result:-<br />
* We find ourselves with the respect of the United States, and of<br />
Britain, for not reneging on our responsibilities to stand<br />
ready to counter the threat of communist expansion through<br />
the use of force.<br />
* At home we enjoy that strong, growing and balanced economy<br />
so vital to the achievement of our national destiny.<br />
But the jobs, the development, the growing material strength<br />
essential as a basis for defence and for social welfare all of these depend<br />
on an economy most delicately balanced, on an economy in which we must<br />
take care that the demand for labour and pressure on resources does<br />
not exceed present pressures. </p>
<p>3-<br />
For if this happens as a result of irresponsible promises<br />
being made and accepted, then all these things will be in jeopardy.<br />
We cannot get something for nothing.<br />
And the result of the Opposition's promises would be either<br />
a great increase in inflation which will hit the wage earner and the pensioner<br />
most severely or an increase in taxation which would hit all Australians.<br />
In the result we would have gained nothing and paid a great price for it.<br />
You see around you the results of what we have done and<br />
the increasing opportunities for greatness because we have done it or<br />
rather because you have done it under the conditions of Government we<br />
have provided. Do not risk this. Do not put it all in jeopardy turning to an<br />
Opposition which still believes in nationalisation, in direction for direction's<br />
sake, which is strongly influenced in at least one state by communist<br />
influenced unions and which makes promises they cannot keep.<br />
I believe there is too much at stake for Australia to risk<br />
a Labor Government still controlled by non-elected outside bodies a<br />
Government which would make us falter in our steps towards greatness.<br />
I turn now to the specific policies we shall follow if you<br />
re-elect us as a Government.<br />
But, I repeat, we must apply these policies against the<br />
background of that responsible economic management of which I have<br />
spoken and against a background not only of our needs as a Government<br />
but also of the needs of the states as Governments.<br />
Our task is to protect Australians against inflation and<br />
increased burdens of income tax. Our task is to continue immigration,<br />
to continue the inflow of development capital, to continue full employment,<br />
to ensure that we do not try to do more than we have the men and resources<br />
to accomplish. This must and will be overriding. Others may make<br />
glittering and irresponsible promises for which you will, in one way or<br />
another, pay. We will not. / 4 </p>
<p>4-<br />
DEFENCE: Adequate defence is the rock on which national security<br />
stands. Without it, debate on internal matters could be academic. Over<br />
the years ahead we shall maintain and increase our defence capacity.<br />
There are more Australians under arms today than ever<br />
before in our history except in time of major war. They are better equipped<br />
and they have greater mobility.<br />
We shall keep the Army up to at least its present strength<br />
of nine battalions. We shall retain National Service training in order to do<br />
it. For it will no-. otherwise be done.<br />
We shall improve the capacity of theAirForce, in fighter,<br />
reconnaissance, and strike aircraft and shall see that aircraft provided frr<br />
Australians to fight in are the best obtainable in the world.<br />
We shall strengthen the 1Mvy with the types of ship the Navy<br />
advise us that they most require including the new light destroyers and<br />
the fast combat support ships asked for by that Service.<br />
We shall progressively increase the sums spent on defence<br />
in the years ahead, for to do less would weaken our own security and invite<br />
the suspicion of our allies both within the region and without.<br />
We have already announced that Learmonth Airfield, in<br />
Western Australia, is to be upgraded to an operational base on the Indian<br />
Ocean. We believe that broad considerations of Australia's<br />
geo-political position and national development point to the conclusion that<br />
naval support facilities in Western Australia will also be required in the<br />
future. Our fleet numbers will increase and we will have to take an<br />
increasing interest in the Indian Ocean as the British withdraw. Therefore<br />
we have decided that we should begin the planned development of a naval<br />
base at Cockburn Sound in Western Australia.<br />
The first step, as recommended in the study made by our<br />
consultants, is the construction of a causeway linking Garden Island<br />
( Garden Island, Western Australia) to the mainland. We shall at once<br />
proceed to the detailed design of this causeway and will begin construction<br />
next financial year. Thereafter the naval facilities will be progressively<br />
installed over a period. 0 </p>
<p>Our alliance with the United States under the ANZUS Pact<br />
is vital to our defence. It requires that we should be true allies, that we<br />
should be prepared to give, as well as expect to receive, assistance.<br />
Therefore we shall continue to co-operate with the United States in the<br />
construction of bases, for our joint defence. Bases of value to us both,<br />
in Australia. We shall not sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty<br />
until we are sure that it is an effective Treaty, that it provides real<br />
protection to its signatories, and that Australia's security in the future Is<br />
not endangered.<br />
VIETNAM: On Vietnam, we believe that we were right to help the<br />
people of South Vietnam resist aggression. And we believe we are right<br />
to continue to do so.<br />
The immorality in the Vietnam War lies in the aggression<br />
of the North against the South. We do not seek the conquest of North<br />
Vietnam, nor domination of North Vietnam.<br />
What we seek is an opportunity for the people of South<br />
Vietnam to choose the kind of government under which they wish to live.<br />
We believe this to be a proper aim, and that to leave Vietnam before<br />
the South Vietnamese people are assured of this right would be a tragedy<br />
in itself and would hold the seeds of future tragedy.<br />
Should there be developments which result in plans for<br />
continuing reduction of United States forces over a period then we would<br />
expect to be phased in to that programme and would see that we are. But<br />
we will not unilaterally withdraw. To do so would be to abandon an<br />
objective to betray our allies, and, I believe, to imperil our future security.<br />
MALAYSIA / SINGAPORE: Australia cannot fail to be affected by what happens in the<br />
nations in the region to our North.<br />
What affects their security can ultimately affect our security.<br />
We will ther-efore adhere to our decision to maintain in the region of<br />
Malaysia/ Singapore forces of all arms and will maintain in Australia a<br />
capacity for swift additional assistance. / 6 </p>
<p>-6-<br />
We willcontinue to support the concept of a regional security<br />
pact in that region in which we will participate.<br />
But we will exert all the influence at our command to prevent<br />
participation by Russia in such an arrangement. We believe that our<br />
security would be threatened by the establishment of any Russian naval<br />
or military bases in that area. We believe that any military alliance or<br />
arrangement between Russia and a country in our region would pose a<br />
threat to ourselves. For we cannot forget Czechoslovakia and Hungary<br />
and other occupied nations, and we believe that Russian communism still<br />
has as its objective the spreading of its system throughout the world. / 7 </p>
<p>-7-<br />
TAXATION REFORM:<br />
I turn now to a subject that is of great concern to the<br />
average man. That is income tax.<br />
In recent years many changes have been made to meet<br />
specific needs. These include increases in wives and dependants'<br />
allowances, deductions for education, larger deductions for life<br />
insurance and so on.<br />
But with rapidly rising incomes the existing taxation<br />
structure needs to be reformed.<br />
The operation of the present progressive rate scale has<br />
shifted a growing proportion of the weight of taxation on to<br />
personal income taxpayers, especially wage and salary earners.<br />
A Iarge number of taxpayers in the lower and middle income groups<br />
with incomes ranging from modest levels up to those earned at<br />
executive, administrative and professional levels are involved.<br />
To correct thi s will be a maj or task of great complexity.<br />
We have and are still studying this problem so that beginning in<br />
the next budget we can bring forward speci fic proposals aimed at<br />
improving the system and correcting the inequities which have<br />
developed. As a responsible government we must proceed within<br />
the limits of what is economically feasible at any given time. But<br />
our aim wi 11 be so to reduce personal income tax, over the three<br />
year period beginning with the next budget, that at the end of that<br />
time we will be providing relief, to lower and middle income<br />
earners, of the order of $ 200 million as compared with the amounts<br />
which would be payabl e by them under the present income tax<br />
structure. / 8 </p>
<p>-8-<br />
NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT:<br />
We shall adopt new specific proposals for National<br />
Development. Because lack of water is one of the greatest limitations<br />
on Australia's growth, we shall set aside $ 100 million<br />
over the next five years, to be spent in co-operation with<br />
the Stat es under t he national water resources development<br />
programme, This money will be available for water<br />
conservation including conservation in small dams for<br />
flood prevention and mitigation and for carrying out<br />
surveys of underground water resources.<br />
We shall, during the next Parliament, take Australia into<br />
the atomic age by beginning the construction of an atomic<br />
plant at Jervis Bay, to generate electricity. We believe<br />
that Australia will make increasing use of atomic power in<br />
the years ahead and that the time for this nation to enter<br />
the atomic age has now arrived.<br />
We will embark on developing the Port of Darwin at a cost<br />
which is estimated, together with ancillary services, at<br />
some $ 16 million.<br />
We shall build the Port Augusta/ Whyalla Railway at an<br />
estimated cost of $ 8 million.<br />
We shall build the Port Pirie/ Adelaide Railway, at an<br />
estimated cost of $ 30 to $ 50 million over two years.<br />
/ 9 </p>
<p>9-<br />
-DUCATI ON:<br />
Our direct assistance to education throughout Australia is<br />
great and growing. We are providing science blocks and libraries for<br />
all schools. We are providing $ 10 million a year for secondary technical<br />
schools. We have allocated $ 10 million a year for state-controlled<br />
teacher training colleges, and we are now engaged in a co-operative<br />
study with State Education Departments into the future needs of<br />
education at the school level and this survey covers both state and<br />
independent schools.<br />
When that survey is completed the States and ourselves will<br />
discuss the assistance we should each provide to promote the ftvrther<br />
development of education in all schools. And the survey will include<br />
the provision of in-service training for Australia's primary and<br />
secondary teachers.<br />
There is also a clear need for more educational research, a<br />
need for greater co-operation and co-ordination of effort in particular<br />
fields, and we shall provide $ 250, 000 a year, beginning in the next<br />
budget for this purpose.<br />
We shall introduce, under the control of the Department of<br />
Labour and National Service, vocational training schemes for married<br />
women and single women who have been restricted by domestic<br />
responsibilities but who have now reached a stage where they may wish<br />
to enter employment. And we shall set up a scheme to give vocational training to<br />
workers displaced by technological change who may need training to<br />
convert their existing skills into skills required for alternate service.<br />
And in recent years the government has greatly supported<br />
scientific activity at all levels.<br />
We now intend a new and significant step.<br />
Vie are an island continent and we need a much greater<br />
knowledge and understanding of the biological and physical<br />
recources in and beneath the sea around us.<br />
We shall therefore establish an Institute of Marine Science<br />
at Townsville. </p>
<p>10<br />
EDUCATION: PAGE 2<br />
The Institute will have an independent directorate, and<br />
research in the area of the Great Barrier Reef will be one of the first<br />
priorities of the new Institute.<br />
The capital cost is estimated to be of the order of $ 3 million<br />
and we expect that it will become a centre of excellence that will give<br />
Australia the world reputation in marine science which she already<br />
enjoys in the field of astronomy.<br />
SOCIAL WELFARE: I do not believe that there has ever been, in such a concentrated<br />
period, so much done to improve social welfare as has been done by my<br />
government. We promised and we have matched performance to that<br />
promise. We shall continue general improvemait in social welfare as<br />
and when we can responsibly do so, without causing inflation or<br />
increasing tax burden. And we regard increasing the help given to<br />
poor families as of greater importance than abolishing a means test<br />
so pensions can be paid to rich families.<br />
During the next Parliament we shall pay special attention to<br />
the needs of the young family; to the positive rehabilitation of the<br />
handicapped and invalid so that they may return to normal life; to a<br />
more fruitful partnership with voluntary bodies, including both church<br />
and lay bodies, who serve the old, the sick, and the needy.<br />
We shall pay pensions at standard rates instead of at married<br />
rates to aged couples who lose the economics of living together by<br />
reason of failing health for example if one or both of them is in a<br />
nursing home. We shall give capital assistance on a 2 for 1 basis to approved<br />
institutions which give training for the various kinds of handicapped<br />
children the blind, the deaf, the spastic, the crippled and the mentally<br />
retarded. / 11 </p>
<p>11<br />
SOCIAL WELFARE: PAGE 2<br />
The results already achieved through the aged persons<br />
homes and sheltered workshops encourages us to expand our policy<br />
of partnership with voluntary bodies.<br />
The Meals on % ieels organisation is one of the worthiest<br />
such bodies in the community. In the next budget we will make<br />
available to each separate organisation in the Meals on Wheels<br />
organisation a $ 1 subsidy for every 10 meals served in the past year,<br />
such money to be used for the expansion of their activities, or to be<br />
donated to another Meals on Wheels organisation of their choice.<br />
HEALTH: In health, the removal of financial hardship arising from<br />
illness has had a high priority with us. Today we not only describe<br />
our objectives, we can point to our achievements:<br />
Full hospital benefits for hospital patients who are<br />
chronically ill;<br />
Supplementary nursin-i home benefits for patients needing<br />
and receiving intensive nursing care;<br />
Special benefits for handicapped children under 16;<br />
Medical and hospital benefits, without payment of<br />
contribution, for persons receiving unemployment or<br />
sickness benefit, or for families with incomes below $ 39<br />
a week and for migrants during their first two months in<br />
Australia; Special financial assistance to the States for the development<br />
of co-ordinated programmes cf home care to strengthen home<br />
nursing and home care services, particularly for the frail<br />
aged. All this has been done. It has gone far to eliminate financial<br />
hardship for people with special needs. Only one problem of any<br />
significant size remains in relation to people with lengthy illnesses.<br />
Some people after paying health insurance contributions for many years<br />
find that they are obliged to spend long periods under intensive care in<br />
/ 12 </p>
<p>12<br />
HEALTH: PAGE 2<br />
nursing homes as distinct from hospitals.<br />
We shall negotiate with the health insurance funds to arrange<br />
for the payment of increased benefits, properly related to reasonable<br />
nursing home fees, for persons who have been regular contributors<br />
to health insurance funds and who need intensive nursin-1 home care.<br />
At the same time we have been moving to bring in improvements<br />
in the Nhtional Health Scheme so that it will operate more efficiently,<br />
more economically and more satisfctorily for the community as a<br />
whole. Vie have the Nimmo Committee Report which defines the areas<br />
where reforms are needed for example, more economical management<br />
by some of the health funds and a reasonable, orderly policy in the<br />
alloc-ation of reserves. We shall attack and overcome these problems<br />
and will bring about the reforms that are necessary.<br />
WY,-e are well advanced in negotiations with the medical<br />
profe ssion and the health insurance funds so that all patients will be<br />
assured of medical benefits more closely related to doctors' charges.<br />
Commonwealth medical benefits and fund benefits will be<br />
increa Fred so that the difference between the benefit entitl ements and<br />
the common fee charged by doctors will not at any time exceed<br />
even for the most complicated and costly surgical procedures. For<br />
simpler procedures which are less expensive, the difference between<br />
the benefits and doctors' common fees will be very much less.<br />
This is estimated to cost the Commonwealth some $ 16 million.<br />
The successful introduction of these proposals will mean that no<br />
section of the community which is prepared to insure itself need<br />
flear hardship from the cost of medical services. </p>
<p>13-<br />
HOUSING: The Home Savings Grant Scheme has already benefited<br />
some 153,000 young couples.<br />
Hitherto the grant was only payable if the value of the home,<br />
including land, did not exceed $ 15, 000.<br />
We shall increase this limit and the grant will now be<br />
payable for houses which, including the cost of land, do not exceed<br />
in value $ 17,500.<br />
This amendment will apply to people who contract to buy<br />
or build their houses on or after Monday 27 October 1969. </p>
<p>14<br />
IMMIGRATION The factor which prevents Australia doing all that we, and the<br />
State Governments, wish to do is not primarily lack of money or indeed<br />
pressure on materials. It is that we do not have all the manpower we need.<br />
Bringing increasing numbers of migrants to this country, and<br />
providing conditions which induce them to stay here, and to become<br />
Australians, is therefore one of our fundamental tasks.<br />
280,000 settlers have come to Australia since I took office in<br />
January 1968 and in this last year a record 175, 600 arrived.<br />
We shall in the next three years intensify our efforts in this<br />
field. And, internally, we shall take new initiatives.<br />
Because of the importance of the English language to migrants<br />
the Commonwealth, recognising its obligations, is prepared to take the<br />
initiative in promoting, and to accept responsibility for financing:<br />
1. The expansion of existing facilities for the instruction<br />
of adult migrants;<br />
2. The provision of intensive full-time English language<br />
courses for those who must know English in order to<br />
follow occupations for which they have been trained;<br />
3. And, special classes in existing schools for migrant<br />
children of all ages to ensure that they achieve the<br />
education to which their intelligence and natural skills<br />
entitle them.<br />
Further, within our community there are people in need and<br />
unaware of information which could relieve them from worries they need<br />
not endure. Their own knowledge of the range of benefits, services and<br />
assistance available to them is inadequate and we will propose to the States<br />
that grants be made through the municipal authorities to subsidise the<br />
employm ent of suitably experienced people who might provide the<br />
information and the guidance which these migrants need. </p>
<p>15<br />
ARTS We believe a nation not only expresses itself through its<br />
material achievements, but also through its participation in, and its<br />
development of, the arts.<br />
The late Prime Minister established the Australian Council for<br />
the Arts and this year we increased by 70 per cent the money available to<br />
foster the development of music, ballet and theatre, in Australia. We<br />
established an Interim Council to inv stigat and report on the establishment<br />
of a National Film and Television Training School.<br />
We believe that it is time Australia developed its own film<br />
industry and we shall, in our next period of government, establish an<br />
Australian Film and Television Development Corporation to administer a<br />
film and television fund which will invest in, and make loans to, film and<br />
television producers for the making of quality films and programmes in<br />
Australia with a significant Australian content, and otherwise to encourage<br />
the production and distribution overseas of A ustralian-made films of high<br />
quality. An amount of $ 1 million will be provided as the initial capital<br />
for the Corporation and supplementary grants will be provided during the<br />
early years of its operation so that the Corporation will have available, at<br />
the beginning of each financial year, one million dollars and amounts<br />
repaid from its investments or advances will be retained by the Corporation<br />
for further development. / 16 </p>
<p>16-<br />
TRADE: Australia has begun to emerge as an industrial nation. More<br />
and more we look to the continued healthy growth of our manufacturing<br />
industries for our strength and our security.<br />
The Government believes it is essential to ensure that its<br />
policies adequately reflect the important role manufacturing industry plays<br />
in the nation's economy.<br />
Industry cannot be expected to achieve the full development of<br />
its efficiencies and skills alone. In today's world, industry needs the<br />
support of effective government policies.<br />
In the life of the next Parliament, we will re-examine present<br />
government activities and policies in this important area with a view to<br />
strengthening the Gov ernm ent's programme of assistance to Australian<br />
industrial creativity and efficiency.<br />
But the development of manufacturing industry ultimately<br />
depends on the protection given to industry in the Australian market against<br />
import competition. Australia must have continued industrial growth to create each<br />
year the new jobs required to sustain a growing population and a dynamic<br />
immigration programme. The Government regards its tariff policy as a vital<br />
factor in providing a firm basis for this industrial growth. The traditional<br />
policy that reasonable and adequate protection should be given to economic<br />
and efficient Australian industries has served this country well and will not<br />
be changed. The Government retains full responsibility for Australian tariff<br />
policy. The Government recognises that in cases involving relatively high<br />
protection the benefits have to be weighed very carefu'jy against the possible<br />
effects on other industries and the community generally. But, the Government<br />
does not accept any pre-determined upper limit to the level of protection<br />
which might be accorded. The decision in each case must be determined<br />
by the Government and by the Government alone in the light of all<br />
circumstances of any particular case. / 17 </p>
<p>-17<br />
PRIMARY INDUSTRY: The Department of Primary Industry which will issue a<br />
supplementary statement is continuing its intensive study of the long-term<br />
problems of rural industries.<br />
The Government has recently had before it special reports on<br />
these questions and in the recent budget speech announced a number of<br />
measures to assist primary producers.<br />
The policy of providing compensation in the case of primary<br />
industries that suffered from British devaluation, in cases where loss is<br />
unavoidable and demonstrable, will be continued in 1970 on the same basis<br />
as it was in this year.<br />
The A pple and Pear Industry has submitted a proposal for a<br />
stabilization scheme; and the Government will give full consideration to<br />
these plans.<br />
SHIPPING AND TRANSPORT:<br />
In the past, the Commonwealth Government has encouraged<br />
several forward-looking transport policies, for example railway standardisation,<br />
the development of beef cattle roads, and container shipping. It will continue<br />
to implement measure s which will lead to the reduction of internal transport<br />
costs. The-problem of traffic cong: estion in the citie-s is on-2 of great<br />
urgency. We have made a significant contribution to easing that congestion<br />
problem through our allocations for urban art-: erial and sub-arterial roads.<br />
But there is a great deal more to be done, espe cially in improving public<br />
transport systams. The populations of the major cities ar. e growing so that by 1981,<br />
Sydney could have C-population of 3.3 million, and M-elbourna 3. 1 million<br />
and with this prospect, it is vital that public transport service2s do not decline.<br />
/ 18 </p>
<p>18<br />
SHIPPING AND TRANSPORT Page 2<br />
We will direct attention to this and to shipping and to port<br />
problems. In recent years the shipping industry has undergone major<br />
changes the introduction of roll-on roll-off ships, specialised bulk<br />
carriers and container ships. It is important that the trends towards more<br />
modem ships should be continued because it means lower freights.<br />
The changes in shipping technology have in many cases made<br />
existing port facilities obsolete. There is therefore an urgent need for an<br />
extensive study of port needs and for putting work in hand which will provide<br />
what we need over the next ten years.<br />
We shall do this and we shall set up a Bureau of Transport<br />
Economics, to analyse the costs and economics of transport in Australia,<br />
and, in co-operation with the States, where necessary, will seek to take<br />
measures to reduce such costs. / 19 </p>

On October 25 you will make your choice.<br />
You will choose which defence policy you prefer,<br />
You will choose which foreign affairs approach you prefer.<br />
You will decide whether to continue with that responsible<br />
economic management which has brought us such prosperity, growth and<br />
employment opportunity or whether to accept irresponsible promises for<br />
which you will, in one way or another, pay,<br />
You will choose between growth with stability and our opponents<br />
proposals designed to bring inflation.<br />
You will decide whether our record on social welfare and health<br />
is such that you believe we will make further advances as soon as possible.<br />
You will choose between our proposals to lighten income tax<br />
on the family man and proposals which must prevent such a lightening<br />
and are likely to lead to an increase.<br />
The future is in your hands.<br />
I ask you to consider your choice very carefully.<br />
For Australia's sake I ask you not to put all our present<br />
achievements at risk not to put all the great possibilities for the future<br />
and present at risk.<br />
For Australia's sake I ask you to support the Government on<br />
October </p>
