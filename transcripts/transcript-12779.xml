    <content><![CDATA[<p>As announced a short while ago, I shall travel to Bali today to attend, amongst other things, a memorial service for those who died in the bomb outrage on 12 October 2002. I will be accompanied by the Deputy Prime Minister and I have also invited the Leader of the Opposition to accompany me.</p>
<p>During my absence, the Treasurer, Mr Costello, will act as Prime Minister.</p>
<p>I believe that the Australian consular staff in Bali are doing an excellent job in very challenging circumstances. To augment the personnel already there I have asked the Australian Ambassador in Jakarta Mr Ric Smith – who is shortly to assume the position of Secretary of the Department of Defence – to go to Bali as the overall co-ordinator of the Australian effort.</p>
<p>So many Australians deserve our thanks for what they are doing in most appalling and tragic circumstances. This applies particularly to the medical people, police, forensic experts, volunteers and consular staff engaged in the most trying of all responsibilities namely the identification of the dead.</p>
