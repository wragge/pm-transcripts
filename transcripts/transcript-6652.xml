TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW BETWEEN THE PRIME MINISTER AND<br />
JOHN LAWS, RADIO 2GB<br />
JOHN LAWS:<br />
BOB HAWKE:<br />
LAWS: HAWKE: LAWS: HAWKE: LAWS: HAWKE: LAWS: HAWKE: As I promised, the Prime Minister of Australia<br />
is my guest in the studio now.<br />
Prime Minister, good morning and welcome.<br />
Good morning, John, thank you.<br />
Did you have a good holiday?<br />
Beaut, thanks, John, marvellous.<br />
You look very, very well.<br />
I feel it.<br />
Is Lizard Island as good as they tell me it<br />
is? It is very good, very restful, not too many<br />
people. Obviously you needed a rest because you<br />
have iwalked into a turmoil on your return<br />
really, haven't you?<br />
I don't know about a turmoil, we ecpected<br />
that there was going to be not only exrpected,. fl </p>
<p>-2-<br />
but we want a wide ranging community<br />
debate on our tax proposals, and that is<br />
what is happening and we are indebted to<br />
people like yourselves. John, for the viay<br />
in which you are facilitating that.<br />
LAWS: Yes. I see a lot of headlines have been<br />
pretty tough " Give way, Mr K11, the Sun<br />
editorial said yesterday, a lot of people<br />
saying that what you are doing io going to<br />
cost you office, " What a rip-off", we are<br />
reading here, there and everywhere; has the<br />
reaction been greater than you thought it<br />
would be?<br />
HAWKE: No, much as I expected. I was a little bit<br />
disappointed in some areas, John, that there<br />
hasn't been the attempt to look at the package<br />
as a whole.<br />
Whien you are talking about tax reform in a.<br />
country like Australia. of a system that has<br />
been running down for over 30 years, then<br />
it is inevitable that in an overall package<br />
there will be elements that some people won't<br />
like, and some elements that may. Just<br />
considered by themselves, hurt them and so<br />
if there is a. concentration on particular<br />
elements you will get those headlines.<br />
I just wish people would lookt at the package<br />
as a whole.<br />
LAWS: Is that the thing that has disappointed you the<br />
most, the fact that people have been motivated </p>
<p>by how they are going to be affected themselves<br />
rather than the effect the package will have<br />
generally on the country?<br />
HAW KE: Yes, I think so, John, although I understand<br />
that people will try and see how It Is going<br />
to affect them, but I think they have tended<br />
to be mislead into saying " Well, look, some<br />
prices are going to rise, It Is going to cost<br />
us more", but what they need to do Is to<br />
look at what additional money they are going<br />
to get in their pockets from ' the very<br />
substantial tax cuts that are proposed and<br />
In net terms they wil be better off.<br />
I think it Is a pity that they don't understand<br />
that, but secondly and more importantly, if<br />
they are concerned not just with assessing<br />
their own particular position at this moment,<br />
but if they were to think about what sort of<br />
country they want this to be for their children,<br />
whether they want a country which is going<br />
to be efficiently placed'to best organise its<br />
resources, then I think they should take<br />
the wider view, and we do need to mahk<br />
these changes to make Australia not just<br />
more equitable but more efficient.<br />
The country * wil pay a very high price if<br />
we just .91Uow the tax system to run down<br />
in the way It has been.<br />
LAWS: Are people, do you think, really aware that<br />
in fact some items are going to be cheaper<br />
and some Items will vary very Lttle in<br />
cost, and of course some and some consider<br />
the most Important -will be more expensive, </p>
<p>-4-<br />
but all we seem to hear about is the fact<br />
that things are going to be more expensive,<br />
but not all things are going to be more<br />
expensive?<br />
H-AWKE: No, that's right. We have at the present<br />
time a wholesale tax system which br-ings<br />
in about $ 4.7 billion.<br />
Vie are going to scrap that, that has a wvide<br />
range of goods within it with tax rates ranging<br />
from 7% up to 20% and up even further to<br />
Just to name these goods cars, TVs, radios,<br />
soaps, detergents, pet food, soft drinks,<br />
insecticides, toys, toilet paper, watches,<br />
shavers, cosmetics, toiletries, pens and<br />
handbags they should all become cheaper<br />
because the very high rate of wholesale tax<br />
will be abolished.<br />
LAWS: But is it not true that those items that in<br />
fact wil be cheaper, or not very much more<br />
expensive, are in fact the items more<br />
likely to be bought by the higher wvage<br />
earners than the lower wage earners?<br />
HAWKE: I don't know. As far as I know, I think<br />
most people buy toilet paper a bit of<br />
class distinction there!<br />
I hope that is true, I think so.<br />
LAWS: I didn't hear You aay toilet paper in the<br />
list. I certainly would agree i-ith thct. </p>
<p>But I mean to look at it generally, motor<br />
cars, for . crample, tho biggcst savings will<br />
be made in the biggest cars.<br />
HAWKE: Yes, but nevertheless I don't think % je In<br />
this society now think of motor cars as<br />
luxury items, a commodity which are bought<br />
only by the highest income people.<br />
Your general point is right, John, that there<br />
is going to be a whole range of goods which<br />
are going to be cheaper and that is of<br />
course one of the reasons vhy a 121% broadly<br />
based consumption tax is not going to<br />
produce a 12,% increase in prices, because<br />
the estimated 6% increase in the CPI<br />
represents an amalgam of price increases and<br />
price decreases and price neutralities.<br />
We have deliberately calculated that tax<br />
cuts, that's in direct personal tax, in terms<br />
of ensuring that people will be in net<br />
terms better off.<br />
Let me just give the figure again. The<br />
average weely earnings figure, which is<br />
$ 22,500 a year, an average single person<br />
on that average weeldy earnings will get<br />
$ 31 a week more In his or her pay packet<br />
as a result of tax cuts.<br />
They will pay $ 16.80 a week more through<br />
increased prices, they will therefore in<br />
net terms be $ 14.20 a weeh better off.<br />
If you take not that average weekly earnings<br />
figure, people might nay that is a bit high, </p>
<p>take the figure of $ 19,000, where the 460<br />
in the dollar marginal rate cuts in, the average<br />
person there will get $ 25 a week more in<br />
their pay packet, they will pay $ 15 a week<br />
more in increased prices. In net terms<br />
a week better off.<br />
LAWS: What about those people who have a fixed<br />
income?<br />
HAWKE: There Is a range of considerations there<br />
LAWS: A low fixed Income.<br />
HAWKE: Essentially the package does these things, John.<br />
To the extent that even with low Incomes<br />
they are still within the taxable income<br />
level, they get the benefit of the tax cuts<br />
which will more than compensate.<br />
To the extent that they are the recipients of<br />
social welfare payments pensions or other<br />
forms of social welfare payments, there will<br />
be more than compensation, without running<br />
through the whole range let me take the case<br />
of the single pensioner, the calculation is that<br />
the 61% increase hi prices would require<br />
$ 6 a week increase in pension to cover that,<br />
In fact, what will be given -ill be a $ 9 a week<br />
incr'oaso. There will be substantial increases<br />
of 14% in the areas of spouse rebates and<br />
faintly allowances 14% increases, and so every<br />
point at which there la a dependency upon<br />
welfare payments the compensation will be<br />
more than Js necessary to meet the price<br />
increase. </p>
<p>LAWS: S71<. a.=""></.>
If a pensioner, for example, has a nest egg<br />
set aside, a couple of thousand dollars or<br />
ive thousand dollars or whatever it might<br />
be, to make life a little more comfortable on<br />
odd occasions, surely that $ 2,000, $ 5,000<br />
or whatever it might be, Is immediately worth<br />
121 less?<br />
What you have to ask yourself is if they have<br />
got this nest egg set. aside and it carries<br />
an income stream which puts them in the<br />
tax area, then they get the tax benefit<br />
because the direct tax cut Is of benefit to<br />
them, so that more than offsets, or vill<br />
offset, what happens in regard to the increase<br />
in prices that will occur as a result of the<br />
increase and the imposition of a broadly based<br />
consumption tax.<br />
But if they don't pay tax<br />
If they are in the region where they don't<br />
pay tax and they are the beneficiaries, social<br />
welfare beneficiaries, as I have said, there<br />
is a significant over-compensation of those<br />
benefits and those payments, and part of<br />
that over-compens'ation has been put there<br />
in pait to take account of the sort of<br />
consideration that yoa talk about.<br />
Yes,. but if there Is a saving set aside, in<br />
fact in true terms that saving Is worth 12%<br />
loss?<br />
HAWKE: LAWS: HAWKE: LAWS: </p>
<p>-8-<br />
HAWKE: To the extent that prices go up, then that<br />
tYll be so if the value of their saving doesn't<br />
increase. It depends upon the form in which that<br />
saving Is held, because, you see, if prices<br />
rise then the prices of certain assets that<br />
are held can rise as well, and therefore if<br />
there Is a corresponding rise in the price<br />
of the asset in which the saving is held<br />
then they are not disadvantaged.<br />
I concede that in some circumstances of course<br />
what you eay is right.<br />
LAWS: . The big leaguers, and there are plenty of<br />
them about, are obviously going to try and<br />
find a way to deal with the capital gains<br />
ta.. One way that Is evident to me, and I imagine<br />
to you as well, is if the family is ezempt from<br />
capital gains tax I am sure vie are going to<br />
end up with some fairly extravagent family<br />
homes, aren't we?<br />
IIAWKE: Well, I don't know, I don't think this has been<br />
the experlqnce of other countries, John.<br />
Yotq see, 41l the debate about the capital<br />
gains tax seems to be to some extent put upon<br />
the basis . hat rhat the Australian government<br />
Is suggesting in something unusual.<br />
It operatces in virtually every other country<br />
in the world, and it hasnft produced these </p>
<p>oorts of results, I think that there are<br />
limits upon what people will d, how they<br />
will allocate their resources, I don't think<br />
that they are going to deliberately distort<br />
the wany in which they spend their money<br />
to avoid something which I remind you is<br />
not a tax on nominal gains, they are still<br />
going to be able to invest in other assets<br />
and to the extent that those other assiets<br />
simply appreciate in line with the general<br />
level of' inflation will attract no capital gains<br />
tax.<br />
LAWS: But surely if they are going to<br />
HAWKE: I accept that there may b&gt; e some element of<br />
what you say-<br />
LAWS: it is unavoidable though, Isn't it?<br />
HAWXE: Yes. I meamn, if you are going to adopt the<br />
capital gains tax for the basic reason which<br />
I support It, and that is as a means of<br />
helping the fight against tax avoidance and<br />
evasion, then that is the justifIcation, the<br />
basic justification, not the revenue you are<br />
going to get. which is not much over<br />
$ 100 millonhc in the totality of tax<br />
revenues is rather small.<br />
But isthe white paper points out, John, the<br />
basic argument for a capital gains tax Is<br />
as a weapon to stop tax avoidance and<br />
evaclon. </p>
<p>LAWS: Some questions that listeners have aked<br />
that I salt of you, I will do on their behalf<br />
as I said I would will the taxes fall on<br />
special dietary food, In particular for<br />
diabetic children as they are excessively<br />
expensive already?<br />
HAWKE: John, the proposal Is for no exemptions, and<br />
I want to say this to you, that the reasons<br />
for that are as follows:<br />
Firstly, if there Is one thing that has come<br />
through to us and our advisers In the months<br />
of work that has been done on the tax paper,<br />
It is both from the countries where they<br />
have these forms of taxes and from independent<br />
experts is'to say no exemptions.<br />
The reason they say "~ no exemptions", recognitsing<br />
t -hat there can be the sort of thing you talk<br />
about perceived hardship is this, that<br />
you immediately increa~ e enormously the<br />
administrative costs because the retail outlets<br />
have to have separate accounting systems,<br />
differentia ted cash registers and so on,<br />
whereas If you Just have no exemptions then<br />
at the end of the month, the end of the<br />
period, they-just take off 12j% and that is<br />
It. it increases the opportunities for evasion,<br />
* but also vcry Importantly, John, it goes<br />
back to the point that you were talking<br />
about before that IB not sufficiently recognised, </p>
<p>-11-<br />
that we do have now a very wide ranging<br />
tax on goods.<br />
LAWS: Will there be sales tax on things lke diabetic<br />
foods for children, specific requirements?<br />
HAWKE: There would be no exemptions yes, to the<br />
extent that that was<br />
LAWS: But I mean would there be sales tax existent<br />
on those now that could be ' removed, I am<br />
not sure?<br />
HAWKE: No, generally speaking there is not on food,<br />
generally. You get into this dividing line<br />
between confectionary and food where you<br />
have the stupidy that I think Kit-Kats attract<br />
a tax and chocolate biscuits don't.<br />
So there in those sorts of absurdities, but<br />
I was leading to the point, John, that once<br />
you have any sort of-exemption at all then<br />
you have created the absurdity that we<br />
have got now.<br />
With this wholesale tax system you have tax<br />
on certain goods, you don't have them on<br />
others where there is a great similarlty;<br />
you have a tax of 7% on some, 32r% on<br />
others. That wholesale tax system is a total chaotic<br />
mess. Successive governments independcnt<br />
of political persuasion are always under<br />
pressure if you exompt this, cer-mpt that,<br />
have a different rate on this, a diffeecnt<br />
A </p>
<p>-12-<br />
rate on that.<br />
As far as the problems that are created by<br />
having a tax on foods generally, or on particular<br />
aorta of foods. I go back to the point, Joh-n.<br />
tht the compensation that is going to be<br />
given in tax cuts in direct personal income<br />
is going to be very much greater than the<br />
increase in prices associated rith the broadly<br />
based consumption tax, as Is the increase<br />
in payments of social welfare benefits.<br />
So people are going to have more in net<br />
terms than they otherwise would have.<br />
LAWS: -Yes, but in specific areas, for example these<br />
foods for diabetic children or specific<br />
requirements for diabetic children, they iAUl<br />
in fact be 12NA dearer because there is no<br />
sales tax to tale off in the first place?<br />
HAWK( E: Yes, that's right.<br />
LA WS: And thero Is no avoiding that, you have to<br />
tahe a hard line on that and say " That's<br />
it"?<br />
HAWK( E: it Is not a question of taldng a hard line,<br />
It roally Is the point that once you tall.<br />
about an exemption for one thing YOU Create<br />
an administrative chaos and you create thc<br />
* situation ivhere governments are going to<br />
be subject to aaylng " Wlyou ernempt that,<br />
w~ hy not, t1jis, why not that, w7hy not that?",<br />
end if~ ve were giving people le1s by wany<br />
of tax cuts on their direct tax area so that<br />
in not terma they are w~ orse off, then yiou </p>
<p>would feel really bad about it and you<br />
w~ oudn't do It, but there is that cushion<br />
of surplus In the direct tax cuts and in<br />
the nocial welfare payments.<br />
LAWS: I underatand you are saying that it Is not a<br />
hard line because you see it as a necessary<br />
line, and when it is necessary It then ceases<br />
to be hard, but I imagine the mothers of<br />
the diabetic children are going to see It<br />
as a pretty hard line.<br />
Nothing can be done about It?<br />
HAIVKE: . I see that they would see that as a difficulty,<br />
and the probiem one has, John, is this<br />
that if you are talking about difficulties<br />
the greatest difficulties that have been<br />
imposed upon people like that, ordinary<br />
Australians, is that an increasing proportion<br />
of the more privileged of us in this society,<br />
the more privileged Australians, have been<br />
avoiding tax altogether.<br />
The most regressive burden that you can<br />
place upon ordinary people, including the<br />
sort of people tha~ t you are talldng about<br />
here who have these particular burdens,<br />
Is to have a tax system which Is breaking<br />
down and imposing increasingly a greater<br />
burden of tax upon ordinary wage and<br />
salary earners.<br />
Wihat this reform is about Is to create overall<br />
a more equitable Dyntem where the tax<br />
burden will) be chared more equitably, where<br />
A 17 </p>
<p>-14-<br />
people whatever their station In life, are<br />
going to have to pay tax where they have<br />
been avoiding it, so overall you will be able<br />
to reduce the burden on ordinary people.<br />
That is the main, and I believe a noble and<br />
proper, objective.<br />
If in the process of achieving that there are<br />
some particular problems, t-ell, in a cense<br />
that is unavoidable but you are going to<br />
create overall a greater fairness in the<br />
society, a greater equity.<br />
LAWS: You know that I understand the motive of it,<br />
because the day after it came out when I<br />
talked to you on the telephone I said that<br />
if we are all proper Australians we should<br />
say " This is the way it should go because<br />
the average Australian to going to be better<br />
o'ff if the majority of Australians are going<br />
to be better off".<br />
I certainly understand the motive, and I<br />
certainly see that realistically those people<br />
who have been in a position to abuse the<br />
tax. schemes-In Australia have abused them<br />
out of hand and now they are going to pay<br />
the price and many people don't like it.<br />
I do, however, think it is pretty tough that<br />
people like the families who have diabotic<br />
children paid the price bofore by oubsldising<br />
those who evaded and avoided tax, but<br />
now they are paying the price again. </p>
<p>HAWKE:. Well, John, I hope you understand the point<br />
I am making.<br />
One gets no pleasure if a particular group of<br />
people, wiorthy people, have some additional<br />
burden placed upon them. I mean, that<br />
is not something that you want to achieve,<br />
but I hope you appreciate that the unanimity<br />
of the advice, not from harsh mnonsters but<br />
from well1 motivated people, the unanimity<br />
of advice to government that if you have<br />
exemptions then you are creating a monster<br />
that will start to emerge again as something<br />
which is destructive of the totality of<br />
equity for everyone.<br />
tf there was a way in which you could create<br />
a perfect tax systemn in which there were<br />
no problems for anyone then I would love to<br />
do It, no-one would love it more.<br />
I mean, both on humanitarian grounds and may<br />
I say on political grounds, there is no<br />
politician, there is no prime minister, who<br />
wants unnecessartly to create problems and<br />
I certainly don't want to do It.<br />
LAWS: No, well obviously you have endeavoured to<br />
create what you consider to be a near to<br />
the perfect tax system.<br />
HAWKE: As'near as we can,<br />
LAWS: Whflat about disabled people riheelchairs and<br />
things 111, e th~ at that have been currently<br />
enempt from taxation? Sr </p>
<p>-1-<br />
HAVIKE: In the area where they were exempt from the<br />
existing sales tax to the extent that you<br />
are absolishing a sales tax which hasn't<br />
applied to them, clearly If you now bring<br />
in a broad based consumption tax in the<br />
area where there wasn't a tax, then prima<br />
facie they would be adversely affected.<br />
I don't know whether in straight medical terms<br />
like that, disability terms, whether there is<br />
a consideration available for exemption there,<br />
but again it seems to me that you run into<br />
the same sort of problem that I was talking<br />
about before, that once you create one<br />
area of exemption you open up the whole<br />
issue. But as it stands now it is true that if they<br />
are not paying a wholesale tax, if they are<br />
exempted there, and there is a non-exempt<br />
broadly based consumption tax brought in,<br />
then It would catch that area and it v; ould<br />
have to be the case, I would say, that I<br />
would apply the same sort of observations to<br />
that as I did to the other area.<br />
At the summit, John, these sorts of things<br />
are going to be open to be put to the government.<br />
I have made it quite clear form the beginning<br />
in the election campaign that the ninth principle,<br />
that is, a broad community support, is<br />
imp6rtant. We are going into this summit not with t bol-na<br />
charade. but to Listen intently to all the<br />
submissions that are put on behalf of all </p>
<p>-17-<br />
groups in this country, and both Paul Keating<br />
and I have said that the government will Usten<br />
very closely to what Is said. we will sctudy<br />
in the weeks after the summit very closely<br />
all the submissions that are made.<br />
It could be that in regard to the final decisions<br />
that are taken that you could see some<br />
particular areas where the general observations<br />
I have made against exemptions would be<br />
capable of Isolation, so that they would not<br />
of themselves open up further claims for<br />
exemption.<br />
LAWS: I can tell you are concerned about the fact<br />
that disabled people might have a 12,% tax.<br />
HAWKE: I am concerned about It.<br />
LAWS: Yes, I can tell you are.<br />
HAWKE: I am.<br />
LAWS: But then again you find yourself in a bind<br />
because If you do permit exemptions there<br />
you have over-ruled what you said " srongly<br />
to me prior to that, so it Is not an easy<br />
job, Is it?<br />
HAWKE: It Is not an easy job. Let me, without<br />
commitment, because one has, as I any,<br />
to study very carefully all these considerations,<br />
if a ggovernment were porouaded that<br />
here wore some particular areas of, cay,<br />
medical dllabfIfitles whore they quite clearly<br />
tjore capable of isolation and never able to </p>
<p>be used as a precedent for other areas,<br />
it is conceivable that you would be able to<br />
do something in those areas.<br />
But what any government would have to guard<br />
against, John, which is what I was talking<br />
about In my first answer, would be exemptions<br />
which of themselves were capable of leading<br />
to other broader classes of exemption because<br />
that is what has lead to a wholesale tax<br />
system now, which as I say Is a chaos and<br />
totally illogical.<br />
( Interview continues at 0930 and separately<br />
transcribed) ø f </p>
<p>BOB IIAWKE:<br />
Ii ( Continuation of Interview commencing 9 o'clock)<br />
ø o<br />
I'd like to have room to move where and I'm<br />
now saying this obviously without commitment<br />
but as you can see, I would be terribly worried<br />
ohrmit mrr cno' a o hiQa hip if It e, nnn i, t it<br />
in terms of medical terms, disability terms<br />
Impose a hardship which didn't currently exist,<br />
and I would think a government could look<br />
at a category of that kind which clearly was<br />
not capable of uses of precedent.<br />
I would certainly liaten to those submissions<br />
closely because there's no way I would be<br />
about trying to do something for a disadvantaged,<br />
a medically disadvantaged group, if It were<br />
capable of avoidance in a way which wouldn't<br />
open up rorts elsewhere.<br />
I'm not saying that's a rort, but there could<br />
be rorts elsewhere.<br />
\ S </p>
<p>LAWS Oh no, I know. But then of course you're<br />
going to find that the mother of a diabetic<br />
child is then going to react.<br />
H-AWK{ E: Yea. Well, I use the term broadly " medical".<br />
If you've gone to two instances which in a sense<br />
are medically identifiable a's either in the one<br />
case a disability, a physical deformity which<br />
requires a particular sort of vehicle or instrument<br />
or apparatus to help that person.<br />
The other was another sort of medical disability.<br />
don't want by my comments to create a<br />
situation where I'm breakting down the concept<br />
of no exemptions of a kind which were capable<br />
of applying to everyone.<br />
If you could see a situation in strictly medical<br />
terms which were not capable of then being<br />
pushed to general type exemptions, then I<br />
thitlt that's worth lookin g at.<br />
LAWS: Thc supposed experts have had lots of things<br />
to say, but a comment that I read that I<br />
found interesting concerning Margaret Thatcher:<br />
" Nnance Department economists reminded<br />
Cabinet that when the Thatcher government<br />
in Britain Imposed a big VAT, value added<br />
tax, increased within a month of assuming<br />
low office, low Income earners ivere cushioned<br />
by the enemption of food items.<br />
" Mrs Thatchcr's ultra conservative administration<br />
exempted fuel and power and children's clothing<br />
as well".<br />
J* </p>
<p>Now, obviously she'd taken the line that<br />
she didn.' t want any exemptions, but ultimately<br />
had to bow to them.<br />
HAWJKE: But let me say this, that you can't just make<br />
a straight comparison between what Mrs<br />
Thatcher did and what we're about, because<br />
this Is a much more s~ ophi-Aicated, if I may<br />
121sand more complete package bcuse<br />
where we are different from others is that<br />
we are simultaneously with the proposals for a<br />
broad based consumption tax we're simultaneously<br />
more than compensating by very substantial<br />
cuts in direct income tax so that people in<br />
net terms are going to be better off.<br />
In other words, the impact upon the sort of<br />
categories of people that you're talking about<br />
-of increases in food prices and clothing; prices,<br />
Is more than covered by more money in the<br />
pockcets of those people.<br />
LAW'S: John Mcflean, the New South Wales Labor<br />
Council, has said today that the package isand<br />
to quote him " stone dead unless food is<br />
exempt from consumption tuxc".<br />
HAWKE:-Yes, John has said that earlier and Paul has<br />
replied to him. I don't accept that that's<br />
an accurate statement of the position.<br />
LAWS: What about charitable organisations? What about<br />
meals on Wheels that really do a job to help<br />
people that tire underprivileged? </p>
<p>-4-<br />
What about the Matthew Talbot Hostel here<br />
in Sydney and centres that help peoplo who<br />
can't help themselves?.<br />
HAW KE: Ifl terms of their purchases?<br />
LAWS: Yes.<br />
HAWKE: Well, as It stands now the purchaseo which<br />
they make of goods and services would be<br />
subject to tax.<br />
W1hat you've Uot to appreciate is thet in the<br />
whole area of Social W1elfare benefits that the<br />
recipients are going to be in a, In net terms,<br />
better position than they were before because<br />
we're going to more than compensate weolfare<br />
beneficiaries by the increase that will be made<br />
in those payments compared to the Increase In<br />
prices. So we're not ignoring -not only not ignoring<br />
the area of people ivho are disadvantaged we're<br />
going to deliberately ensure that in their<br />
income terms they will be better off, so that<br />
If you look at the vielfare area as a whole, dohan,<br />
I thinlk you can see that we've veriy deliberately<br />
taken Into account those concerns.<br />
LAWS: Would there ever be a possibility that the<br />
consumers tax could be turned to the benefit<br />
of Australia? I wiau talking about it yest~ erday.<br />
I was thinking outL loud about It yeaterday in<br />
my radio programme which I spend a lot of<br />
timo doing, that perhaps it could be to the </p>
<p>betterment of Australia if certain items created<br />
and produced In Australia could be tax enempt<br />
to encourage people to purchase those over and<br />
above overseas Items and luxury Items.<br />
For example, the good old Onkaparinga blanhets<br />
which everybody needs, whether you're rich,<br />
poor or Indifferent, Ieverybody needs a blanlcet,<br />
if it didn't have a tax on It and people were<br />
encouraged to buy it it would be Good for<br />
Australian industry.<br />
If h1owever People Wanted to go and buy Christian<br />
Dior or I.. nvin blankets they would pay a bigger<br />
price and tax on it as we.<br />
John, the way in which you make decisions in<br />
government about the encouragement of Australian<br />
indus~ tvre and the~ trelativem nr1ce levels, of<br />
HAIVKFAustralian products and imported proC<br />
not via the mechanism of exemptions ii<br />

You have your whole Tariff structure,<br />

to Australian production and Austral. ia<br />
consumption, and thnt'a the appropria<br />
of doing it -not via the method of ex<br />
In a consumption tax for all the reaso<br />
before.<br />
LAWS: I would have thought It wyould have b~<br />
to encouraGe Australian Industry In tl<br />
and make it a bit easter on people bu~<br />
that are In fact essential. lucts is<br />

<p>-6-<br />
But then I. fuppose you'd have the producers<br />
of the non-essential products not being too<br />
pleased.<br />
HAWKE: Well, you're opening up the whole range of<br />
problems that I referred to before if you start<br />
using exemptioins within a corni. umption tax<br />
system for other purposes.<br />
You've got a range of instruments as government<br />
available to you to try and say we twant to<br />
encourage that sort of industry, vis a vis imports,<br />
and you should uae those instrumerts rather<br />
than the exemption concept within a consumption<br />
tax system.<br />
LAWS: A lot has been made of the effect that losing<br />
the expence account is going to have on<br />
I know that you wiere Interviewed recently<br />
in Adelaide on the subject. I've heard a lot<br />
of people discuss it. I haven't quite seen it<br />
the same way but In'' interested in how you ree<br />
it.<br />
HAWKE: Well, let me say this, John. Firstly I believe<br />
that if a business deal is worth coneummating<br />
it's not going to live or die on whether there<br />
is a subsidigation of a meal in a restaurant.<br />
If you and I want to complete a deal which tie<br />
think is worth doing anC vie've got to do it<br />
over a meal, then we're going to do that<br />
irrespective of whethor there's a subaldisation </p>
<p>by the general taxpayer of our five course<br />
meal and for you a bovely bottlo of Fronch<br />
wine and for me, some beaut Perrier Water.<br />
J think If we think that the deal's worthwhile<br />
we'll go ahead and do it and consummate it<br />
over that mecal.<br />
Blut let me make the more obvious point. You've<br />
travelled overseas, John. You've been to France.<br />
There's no shortage of 5-star restaurants in<br />
My instant pirgurnnt to that of cource was<br />
there are more people in France, but your<br />
answer to that va-s there are more restaurants<br />
too. That's right. The ratio of restaurants to<br />
persons in France Ws a much higher one than<br />
here. The realitieu are of course that it's not seen<br />
as necessary In other countries for the ordinary<br />
person, the ordinary wagie and salary corner to<br />
be subsidising people who want to have their<br />
meals in restaurants and it's been rorted as well,<br />
as8 you hnow,.. that where you have thesc backdating<br />
of credit cards where executives ;-ill take their<br />
families out on the weehend to a meal In a<br />
restaurant and have the thing back-dated so it<br />
appears to be a business exerctse during the<br />
week this is a luxury that Austria can do<br />
without, and all the experience of other countries<br />
shows that the restaurant business Will Ltill<br />
survive and prorqper. as it should.<br />
. r<br />
' a.<br />
LAWS: HAhWKE: </p>
<p>LAWS: This i8 another question from a caller. What<br />
Is Mr Hawke going to do to Incorrect the<br />
imbalance of public servants to private<br />
enterpise work~ force, assuming of course<br />
that you cee it as an Imbalance, which Is<br />
4.8 to 1 apparently at the moment.<br />
Also how much longer can the Australian<br />
economy stand this Imbalance.<br />
H A WK( E: I'm not quite Lsure whlat the listener means about<br />
the imbalance. The fact Is, if you loolc at<br />
Australia as a whole, that 75% of the jobs in<br />
Australia are in the private sector and that's<br />
why since we've been in government vie've done<br />
everything , we can to try and create the proper<br />
environment for the pri1vate sector.<br />
Indeed the 375, 000 ndditional jobs that we've<br />
created sinvc we've been in office have been<br />
very, very substantinlly In the privato -lector.<br />
I'm riot one. who's here an apolof~ ist for or<br />
protector of the public service. I thinh that<br />
In the public service of the commonwealth level<br />
and the stgtc level there hits over the years<br />
accumulated certain areas where more loanness<br />
can be Introduced.<br />
We're gradually moving to do that and we'll<br />
continue to do it.<br />
But I want, to any thia to people: if you're<br />
going to have proper defence forces, if you're </p>
<p>going to have a fair and substantial social<br />
welfare ystem to protect those in the<br />
community in need; if you're going to have<br />
your roads built and your bridgeu built and<br />
your tchools built and so on, then these<br />
things don't just happen. You've got to have<br />
a public service to help In the creation and the<br />
delivery of these things to the people.<br />
The secret, John, is to try and make sure that<br />
you have a public service which is not unnecessarily<br />
large or obese, and I can assure all your lioteners<br />
that I am very, very responsive to this, and in<br />
the long exercise, John, that we went through<br />
earlier this year which led to a $ 1.26 billion<br />
dollar saving in the May statement, part of that<br />
involved considerable cutting back of claims for<br />
additional respurce of bodies in the public<br />
sector, and ' ll continue to adopt that approach.<br />
LAWS: Will you make an attempt however to curb that<br />
sort of public, spending?<br />
HAWKE: I will say more than that: not only will I attempt<br />
to curb it, I've already done it.<br />
Just take the comparison between the previous<br />
government and this one: look at all the nonsense<br />
that they went on with that Razor Gang exerclse,<br />
and it produced in the end something like about<br />
$ 300 million.<br />
In our first year in 1983 we had a very, very<br />
substantial exercise. Again this year 11 billion<br />
cutting. We just don't talk about hard decisions, </p>
<p>_ 101<br />
as distinct from our opponents. They used to<br />
talk, corm to the hurdle and say, 11Oh, that's<br />
a bit difficult. We won't'jump that one".<br />
It was in the area of the public service, in the<br />
area of foreign banks, in the area of floating<br />
the dollar. in the area of deregulating the<br />
financial system. All these things that ought<br />
to have been done to help the private sector,<br />
to mnake a more toug h competitive Australian<br />
economy, they did the-work,. wouldn't make the<br />
decision. We do the work and we take the decisions.<br />
LAWS: The 1983-84 wages for public servants amounted<br />
to $ 4.9 billion. The projected budget for ' 84-' 85<br />
Is 5.3 billion. That's a fair Increase.<br />
HAWKE: Well, I can't say whether those fgures are<br />
accurate. I'm not saying they' re inaccurate,<br />
I just haven't got the statistics In front of me.<br />
So I ' m just in a position where I can't say that<br />
that's right or wrong. What's the source of<br />
them?<br />
LAWS: -The Bureau of Statistics.<br />
R AVWK Is it -the Comnmonweailth Public Service Bill?<br />
LAWS: It's the wages for public'servants. 4.9 billion<br />
HIAWKE: Well, as I say, I'm not arguing about the figures.<br />
I can't say ycs!. they're right or they're wrong.<br />
Yj ; i </p>
<p>-11-<br />
But let me just make the general point, that I<br />
assure you and the particular listener concerned,<br />
John, that where we can halt the growth of the<br />
public uerv~ cc where wie believe that can be done<br />
in areas where growth is not necessary, twe have<br />
done it, and to the extent that we make decisions<br />
that there can be some cutbacks in arezL3 where<br />
there are too many, we have done It. We'll<br />
continuo to do it.<br />
I don't wiant to have one more public service<br />
on the commonwcalth public payroll than io<br />
necessary. It's not the earjest thing in the world just to say,<br />
" Well, you're going to cut this, cut that, cut that",<br />
but what you can do is to ensure that where there<br />
have been requests which I think have been based<br />
on past assumptions that you put a request up<br />
and It will be granted and there'll be more public<br />
servants there. 11e are very astringent about that,<br />
and by the process of attrition in certain areas<br />
there will Occur cutbacks.<br />
What this government has done, what no other<br />
government has done, is to impose the constraints<br />
of the trilogy upon us, that is to constrain the<br />
growth In public expenditurps, and that to a<br />
very substantial extent Includes expenditure on<br />
public se r vic6 salaries.<br />
kiaving said all that, I think It is fair for us not<br />
to in4~ l( lle in) thin orgy of 01. attack upon public<br />
servants3.<br />
j. fIT </p>
<p>-12-<br />
Either w--e want defence anid education and<br />
roads and social welfare or we don't. If<br />
we want them and I understand that the<br />
listener Involved and all listeners would<br />
accept that those things are necessary for<br />
a fair, efficient and equitable Australia, then<br />
we've got to understand, as I say, those<br />
things don't grow on trees.<br />
They are delivered by human beings, employed<br />
on behalf of the community.<br />
W1, hen we talk about public servants, don't let's<br />
dca~ lse them, let's understand that they ar~ e<br />
people employed on behalf, not of M~ r Fraser<br />
or Bob Havwlce or Paul Kecating or John Howard.<br />
They are there to serve the public, to provide<br />
defence for the public, to provide education for<br />
the public, to provide roads and bridgres and<br />
all these sorts of things for the public, and what<br />
we ought to do is to try and have pride as a<br />
community in acquiring a public service which<br />
is efficient, talented -we don't want to have<br />
our best people being leechcd out of the public<br />
service Into the private sector. The public<br />
is entitled to have high quality people there<br />
ensuring that we get g. ood public service.<br />
So I say, yes. there is fat that's accumulated<br />
over time.: We're trying to cut that out. But<br />
I am not going to be party to an attoec upon<br />
public servants as euch..<br />
LAWS: There's a very strong suggestion if the tax<br />
reforms tire implemented, that you will then<br />
require yet another army of public servants<br />
to monitor and adminiuter It.<br />
p f </p>
<p>-13-<br />
HAWKE: John, the calculations about the increosed cost<br />
that will be involved I think are of the order of<br />
million.<br />
That will certainly require some additional<br />
public servants but I would have thought that<br />
your ordinary listener would approve of the<br />
fact that employing more people in the tax office<br />
to cut out tax avoidance and evasion which is<br />
what we've done, is to their benefit.<br />
If we can ensure that people who've been avoiding<br />
and evading their payment of taxes which h a<br />
meant that your ordinary listener has had to pay<br />
more. then if by the employment of more people<br />
to get a more efficient tax system. if that means<br />
in the end they are better off I think they'll<br />
' welcome it,<br />
LAWS: I would imagrine they would. Five of the nation's<br />
leading business groups and you would know<br />
them attacked the government's ta.. reforms<br />
claiming they would severely damage the economy<br />
and they would coct jobs.<br />
I don't think that sits very well for the tax cummit,<br />
does it?<br />
HAWKE: Obviously I would have preferred that they<br />
hadn't said what they did. It would be<br />
dishonest to say otherwise.<br />
But let m say this, that the emergence of the<br />
government's White Paper has reflected to a very </p>
<p>-14-<br />
considerabl * e extent the input of a number of<br />
buuineas organlzationn including some of<br />
those that are Included in that statement of<br />
the five, and we have had inputs from<br />
business repi'esentntives which suggest for<br />
instance that the approach In the fringe<br />
benefits area which is adopted In the White<br />
Paper is the best way to go.<br />
I think that those organistions of business are<br />
like trade unions, like an ACTU. They have<br />
a big constituency, a lot of people, different<br />
elements in their constituency.<br />
I think what they've done is to issue genoral<br />
statements at this stage. I don't think it's<br />
closed off their willingness or capacity to think<br />
about the package as a whole and I'm, still<br />
hopeful that out of the summit there can be<br />
broad support.<br />
Let me . rep * cat what I've said from the beGinning.<br />
We do not go into the, tax summit with a closed<br />
mind. I s aid carlier this wveol that I believe<br />
if you're putting the beat position that there<br />
should be the IV, that there shouldn't be<br />
exemptions, but I've said-and I rdipent here<br />
on your programme, it's appropriate that I<br />
should thatwe are going to listen to wjhat<br />
the business community a-nd the trade unions,<br />
the welfare. community has got to say.<br />
We'll itsten to them. We hope reciprocally they'll<br />
listen to un. </p>
<p>We've put a lot of work into this. We are not<br />
about doing something that would hurt the<br />
Australian commuiity. That would be contrary<br />
to everything that has characterised this<br />
government since we've come into office.<br />
We are about economic growth, and I say to those<br />
business representatives, under what government<br />
have you had the turnaround from recession<br />
to record levels of growth.?<br />
It's under this government because we've made<br />
the decisions to produce that result and we are<br />
not deliberately about making decisions which<br />
would turn that growth process around.<br />
i<br />
I think that thcy will respond to those arguments.<br />
LAWS: You don't agree that it would increase corporate<br />
tax payments by up to 30%, as they claim?<br />
HAWKE: No.<br />
LAWS: A fair escalation, isn't it?<br />
HAWKE: Yes, and it's not only trade unions which are<br />
capable of maklting ambit claims, John.<br />
LAWS: What about charities? They're currently<br />
tax exempt to such a large extent anyway.<br />
Care they buys for lotteres miss the<br />
wholesale taxt. Their executive gets normal<br />
perks like cars and things.<br />
Are charities going to be affected? I imagine<br />
they'd have to be, wouldn't they?<br />
7. M </p>
<p>-16-<br />
HAWKE: HAWKIC: No, John. It's not a fair assessment. I think<br />
If you. look back to the very beginning of this<br />
during the Ipst election campaign and everything<br />
that I've sid throughout, I've said we've got<br />
a responsibility as a government to do two<br />
things. Firstly to analyac the inadequacies of the<br />
exristing system, and then to fsay, " Well, here<br />
are the avenues in which there can be reform" and<br />
No. The whole question of. exemptions for<br />
charities in regard to donations and so on,<br />
that's not affected by these sets of proposals,<br />
John. What about if they want to buy a car In order<br />
to have a lottery? Up until this time they've<br />
missed that 20% wholesale tax which will now<br />
be gone, but will they pay the<br />
To the extent that car6 generally are reduced<br />
from a 20% wholesale tax down to 12generally<br />
the price of cars should be better.<br />
But what normally happens In regard to<br />
charities Is, I think, companies make donations<br />
in respect of the cars. I don't think that the<br />
attitude of companies is going to change.<br />
There's a groing body of opinion that says<br />
both you and Paul Keating refuse to compromise<br />
on the taic package so that you'll be allowed a<br />
chance to dump it saying, % Wtrileldv ean d<br />
you didn't want it".<br />
is there any truth in that?<br />
LAWS: H AW KE<br />
LAWS: </p>
<p>-17-<br />
I think as a government we havc a responsibility<br />
to say, " Well, we thinIc here is the best iway of<br />
doing it".<br />
I remain convinced in my mind on all the<br />
discussion that's taken place to this point<br />
that the preferred option in the White Paper,<br />
John, Is the best way.<br />
I concede It's not without problems. Of course<br />
there are problems, but I'm not going to lead<br />
a government which walks away from issues because<br />
there are problems involved in It.<br />
I don't think Autstralians want governments like<br />
that. We paid too heavier a price between ' 75 and<br />
' 83 for a government which. walked away from<br />
decisions because there were problems..<br />
I repeat the floating of the dollar, the<br />
deregulation of the financial system, the<br />
entry of foreign banks, the establishment of<br />
appropriate relations between the commonwealth<br />
and the state governm~ nts. In oil of those<br />
fundamental areas It was clear what the right<br />
decivion wns.<br />
But there were probleme involved In it, so<br />
government walked away from It, and average<br />
Australians 1paid a heavy price.<br />
In all of those areas we' ye made the decisions,<br />
despite the suggestion there wecre problems<br />
because we knew it was right for. Austraa </p>
<p>In this process, John, what we've done is to<br />
nay, " eIwe think this is the beat wiay of<br />
going." Wie know there' are problems because it's so Important,<br />
the whole tax urea.' We're not going to Impose that<br />
upon you, we're going to open it up for discusssion.<br />
If in that process of diacussion in the community<br />
at the summit, before It, and after it If out of<br />
all that it's clear that the Australian community<br />
very broadly thinks there's a better way they<br />
prefer to go, well then, okay. We will respond<br />
to that.<br />
But I think at this stage leading up to the summit,<br />
I've got a responsibility and Paul's got a<br />
responsibility of arguing what we see on the<br />
best evidence available to us as the best thing<br />
to do for Australia.<br />
I believe it is, but I don't go to the summit with<br />
a closed mind. I'm going to listen Intently and<br />
I'm going to study intently everything that's<br />
said, and if at the end thcre is need for refinemcnt,<br />
then there will be refinement.<br />
But I've got a responsibility to put what I think<br />
in the right.. case now.<br />
LAWiS; If there's going to be need for adjustment on<br />
a Inlrge scale, will you just drop it?<br />
H A WKE: I don't think the community reaction to this<br />
point has talhed about the dropping of tax<br />
reform. </p>
<p>-19-<br />
LAWS: Of this particular tax reform?<br />
HAWKE: What I think could emerge and I'm being<br />
hypothetical now I hope It doesn't because<br />
I think the preferred option is the right one.<br />
It could be, John, that you could have a situation<br />
where it's said, " Look, there are certidn<br />
refinements of that which would appear to command<br />
a much broader community support".<br />
If that -were to happen it's not a question of<br />
dumping something but it is a question of<br />
refining something.<br />
We've made it clear that our minds are open.<br />
But there is a difference In responsibility.<br />
It's not a point of Kcating and Havwke standing<br />
back and saying, " We've done our job there<br />
it is", now we wait for the summit and listen<br />
to what people have got to say.<br />
If we believe on the evidence that's available<br />
to us now as a result of a hell of a lot of<br />
work that's gone into this, and let me juc't<br />
interpolate there to say no government in its<br />
right mind does something which it t Inkc is<br />
going to be against the economic Interests of<br />
a country, or against the interests of the<br />
majority of people.<br />
We believe fervently and with integrity that<br />
" this is the right way to go, so we are out there<br />
trying to sell it, John. </p>
<p>But I say on this ais I've said from the beginning<br />
of the asaumption of Prime Ministership, I've<br />
never beikeved in public life that I am necessarily<br />
right on everything that I tackle.<br />
I hope that I've done my best to get to the right<br />
conclusion. But if it occurs, that in this process<br />
up to and at the Bummit, that we can see that<br />
there's either a better way of going or a way of<br />
going which Is going to have broader support,<br />
then we'll listen to that and we will certainly<br />
be disposed to try and do that.<br />
But In the meantime if I believe and If X~ eating<br />
believes that on the evidence available to us<br />
to this stage. that this is the best thing for<br />
Australia, then I'm going to try my best to sell<br />
it.<br />
LAWS:-Has the going been tougher than you imagined<br />
it would be?<br />
HAWKE: Much as I thought. I think by and large, John,<br />
that if you looked no, tried to make an objective<br />
assessment, I think what you'd have to say is<br />
this: no one's come up with a detailed alter~ native<br />
pack~ age which they say is better to meet wihat<br />
99% of Australian people say is the caze, that ithat<br />
the existing system's crook. It's gone,<br />
it's had it," it's unfair, Wte inefficient.<br />
No one's really in all the discussion come up a-16<br />
said,. " Look, here we are that's better".<br />
They've pointed out some things they don't<br />
like, and I think we haven't donp too badly uo<br />
far. Y3ut it's a tough process.<br />
A* CC </p>
<p>-21-<br />
LAWS: Sure is. Thank you very much for your<br />
time. You've given us a lot of it as usual.<br />
We're very grateful for it, and good luck.<br />
HAWKE:; John, could I say a very sincere thank you to<br />
you. I know you don't agree with every single<br />
