<p>CARLTON: </p>
<p>Down to business, national affairs. The big issue of course, the</p>
<p>   Government's tax reform package including the GST which we</p>
<p>   get next week. You've heard in the news that today the Prime</p>
<p>   Minister moved on health and hospitals with another cash offer to</p>
<p>   end the brawl on funding for the States. And there's other</p>
<p>   questions around as well of course but you could perhaps be forgiven</p>
<p>   for thinking there's an election on the way and sooner rather</p>
<p>   than later. With me in the studio, the Prime Minister. Good afternoon.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER: </p>
<p>Hello Mike, nice to be here again.</p>
<p>CARLTON:</p>
<p>Thanks for coming. The critical question, I think most of us want</p>
<p>   answered, is the merger between the St George Dragons and Illawarra</p>
<p>   which seems to be on the cards. Are you in favour or not?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Providing they keep the colours red and white and play under the</p>
<p>   name St George, yes. As patron of the great St George Rugby League</p>
<p>   Club what else should I say and indeed what else would the supporters</p>
<p>   of that club want. I don't think anybody, if they had their</p>
<p>   druthers, would want any mergers anywhere. The reality of the game</p>
<p>   in the late-1990's dictates otherwise. I hope the mergers that</p>
<p>   must occur do so in a way that preserves as much local fervour and</p>
<p>   support and enthusiasm as possible.</p>
<p>CARLTON: </p>
<p>Okay, but St George, Dragons and Steelers is all right with you?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER: </p>
<p>Well, on those conditions.</p>
<p>CARLTON:</p>
<p>On those conditions. Got to be red and white otherwise....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>And the same name too.</p>
<p>CARLTON: </p>
<p>And the same name?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER: </p>
<p>Oh yes. You can't possibly trade the greatest name in the</p>
<p>   world as far as club rugby league is concerned. It is, after all,</p>
<p>   the most, has been the most successful rugby league club in the</p>
<p>   world without exception.</p>
<p>CARLTON:</p>
<p>Otherwise there will be a Prime Ministerial veto.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Indeed.</p>
<p>CARLTON: </p>
<p>Some of the more serious matters. A simple person might think there</p>
<p>   was an election in a couple of months.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER: </p>
<p>I don't know when the election will be. I haven't made</p>
<p>   up my mind. It will be at the right time and sometime between now</p>
<p>   and when it's due.</p>
<p>CARLTON:</p>
<p>Why have you gone over the head of your Health Minister, Michael</p>
<p>   Wooldridge, with this extra offer on funding?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I haven't gone over his head. We've talked about</p>
<p>   it for some weeks. What we're prepared to do is put another</p>
<p>   $915 million over five years into the public health systems of the</p>
<p>   States and Territories. Now that is a very good additional injection</p>
<p>   of money.</p>
<p>CARLTON: </p>
<p>That will be a total of $3.8 billion?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER: </p>
<p>Yes, it will be a total of $3.8 billion and what it means is...</p>
<p>CARLTON:</p>
<p>But the States want 5.5.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yeah, but the States wanted $5.5 billion more and we've been</p>
<p>   prepared to give $915 million more and it will mean that there's</p>
<p>   been a 10.2 percent increase and 17 percent increase over the five</p>
<p>   years from now through to the early part of the next century. </p>
<p>CARLTON:</p>
<p>It's still less and they are asking a lot.....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>It is less, but you always get a bit of ambit in claims made by</p>
<p>   States on the Commonwealth. The important thing, and this is good</p>
<p>   news for the people of Australia because the public hospital system</p>
<p>   is really the core element of health provision in Australia and</p>
<p>   the public hospitals are the responsibility of the States but we</p>
<p>   have obligations to contribute. Now we made a very good offer at</p>
<p>   the Premiers' conference....</p>
<p>CARLTON:</p>
<p>And they walked out.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>They walked out. I thought that was silly but that's history</p>
<p>   now. The important thing is the outcome, the outcome is good for</p>
<p>   the patients in the public hospitals and to put another $915 million</p>
<p>   into the public hospital system over five years is, in anybody's</p>
<p>   language, a very healthy injection of cash and it will help the</p>
<p>   public hospital system which I have a great deal of faith in and</p>
<p>   the Government is a great believer in. Public hospitals are integral</p>
<p>   to our health system. They are indeed the very essence of our health</p>
<p>   system.</p>
<p>CARLTON:</p>
<p>Is this the last and final offer, not another red cent, that's</p>
<p>   it?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, no this is it and it has been accepted by....it has been</p>
<p>   formally accepted by every State except New South Wales and New</p>
<p>   South Wales will undoubtedly play a political game until 11:59pm</p>
<p>   on the evening of the 28th of August 1998.</p>
<p>CARLTON:</p>
<p>And that's the deadline?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>That's the deadline for them to accept the offer. I have no</p>
<p>   doubt Mr Carr will accept the offer.</p>
<p>CARLTON:</p>
<p>Really, I'd be surprised if they do.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well they don't get the extra money unless they sign the agreement.....</p>
<p>CARLTON:</p>
<p>And that's it?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>That's it. The other States have signed up and Queensland</p>
<p>   and the Northern Territory, that had previously indicated their</p>
<p>   agreement, they will of course share in the additional base funding.</p>
<p>CARLTON:</p>
<p>Right. Why not just put the extra money into the public hospital</p>
<p>   system, why not just shove it straight in there?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well we can't because we don't run them.</p>
<p>CARLTON:</p>
<p>But you can earmark it for that.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well that's what we are doing.</p>
<p>CARLTON:</p>
<p>All right. There are still other strains on the health system that</p>
<p>   drain the stampede away from private health insurance, it's</p>
<p>   placing enormous strain on the public hospital system, what are</p>
<p>   you going to do about that?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I don't think you have seen the full working through</p>
<p>   of the measures the Government has already brought in. There's</p>
<p>   not only the health insurance rebate that's worth $450 a year</p>
<p>   for a family but you have also got the impact of that high income</p>
<p>   earner surcharge. I don't think it will be for another month</p>
<p>   or two but a lot of those people when they get their tax assessments</p>
<p>   and find that they have to pay this extra amount because they haven't</p>
<p>   taken out private health insurance, I think you will then see a</p>
<p>   possible return of some of those people into the private health</p>
<p>   insurance system.</p>
<p>CARLTON:</p>
<p>Are you going to subsidise more people into private health insurance?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, we've got a policy on that and we....</p>
<p>CARLTON:</p>
<p>Are you going to up the rate....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well we are not in the business of sort of just putting and taking</p>
<p>   on policies like that. We have got a policy. I don't think</p>
<p>   it has fully worked its way through as yet and I don't think</p>
<p>   you can make a judgement on the policies that are already in the</p>
<p>   pipeline until they have had an opportunity of fully working their</p>
<p>   way through.</p>
<p>CARLTON:</p>
<p>Have you got something on that in the tax package next week?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Good try Mike. The simple rule on this tax package...I can't</p>
<p>   say yes or no to anything. If you do, you then say well what about</p>
<p>   the next thing, the next thing.</p>
<p>CARLTON:</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Exactly and that is why you asked me the question, and that is</p>
<p>   why I neither confirm nor deny anything that I am asked about the</p>
<p>   tax package now, no matter how close or wider the market may be</p>
<p>   depending on what the question is.</p>
<p>CARLTON:</p>
<p>All right, but chunks of it have been comprehensively leaked Â</p>
<p>   10 per cent GST, not on health education, childcare, income.....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well all of that's been speculation.</p>
<p>CARLTON:</p>
<p>Comprehensively leaked by persons close to either the Treasury</p>
<p>   or the Prime Minister's Office.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No. No.</p>
<p>CARLTON:</p>
<p>Is it good speculation?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I am not going to confirm or deny it. Michael, this will be a tremendous</p>
<p>   plan for the future of Australia. It will give us a tax system for</p>
<p>   the 21st century and it's not an end in itself tax</p>
<p>   reform or tax relief. It's part of the process of building</p>
<p>   a stronger and more competitive economy and we have done a lot of</p>
<p>   other things. And the next thing that needs to be done is to change</p>
<p>   the taxation system and there will certainly be personal income</p>
<p>   tax relief, particularly for families, and that will be of enormous</p>
<p>   benefit...I mean a goods and services tax is only part of it,</p>
<p>   the whole plan. It's far more than a goods and services tax.</p>
<p>   I can assure the Australian public of that.</p>
<p>CARLTON:</p>
<p>You are starting to sound like Arthur Daly! The big concern we</p>
<p>   get here at 2UE is from retired people. People on pensions, fixed</p>
<p>   incomes, people with a nest egg put away. Now they are not paying</p>
<p>   a lot of income tax most of them, they are very concerned they will</p>
<p>   be hit with prices, higher prices for everything without any compensation,</p>
<p>   now you must be aware of that?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh look I can understand in this sort of five minutes before midnight,</p>
<p>   five minutes before the release of the plan, I can understand a</p>
<p>   lot of questions arising. I wish I could start answering them now</p>
<p>   but....</p>
<p>CARLTON:</p>
<p>Can you tell them now?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Can I just say to them Michael that when they see the plan and</p>
<p>   they see the provision that has been made for people on the pension</p>
<p>   and for people on fixed and low incomes, they will agree with my</p>
<p>   claim made over many months that it is a very fair package.</p>
<p>CARLTON:</p>
<p>That is a huge concern for that age group....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Mike, I understand that and both as an individual, as an Australian,</p>
<p>   as well as the Prime Minister, I am very conscious of that. That</p>
<p>   generation of people have made an enormous contribution to the Australian</p>
<p>   community and they are entitled to have security and protection</p>
<p>   and not be....</p>
<p>CARLTON:</p>
<p>You've got that in there, that's what you are saying?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes, yes.</p>
<p>CARLTON:</p>
<p>Iron clad?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes. They will love it.</p>
<p>CARLTON:</p>
<p>They will love it?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes. </p>
<p>CARLTON:</p>
<p>They are very concerned that with a GST they'd be paying tax</p>
<p>   again having paid tax all their working lives and here's John</p>
<p>   Howard going to clobber us in our retirement.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>You just...I just say to them, have a look at the whole plan.</p>
<p>   Don't under any circumstances imagine that the plan I am bringing</p>
<p>   out is a plan to dump a goods and services tax at whatever rate</p>
<p>   people might think it will be.</p>
<p>CARLTON:</p>
<p>10 per cent.....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I say nothing about the rate. I am not going to dump this GST at</p>
<p>   Âx' per cent on top of the existing taxation system. It</p>
<p>   has always been intended as a replacement indirect tax, to replace</p>
<p>   things like the wholesale sales tax which have all these hidden</p>
<p>   rates of up to 45 per cent. 22 per cent on many household items,</p>
<p>   32 per cent on your television and video. I mean that is a crazy,</p>
<p>   uneven, lopsided system and wouldn't it be more logical to</p>
<p>   have a different rate, lower rate, on everything.</p>
<p>CARLTON:</p>
<p>Can you say to these people now, many of whom are listening, that</p>
<p>   retired people, people on fixed incomes will not be worse off?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I can say that, they won't be worse off and when the plan</p>
<p>   comes out I invite them to have a very careful look at it and they</p>
<p>   will find they are not worse off. They will find they have been</p>
<p>   fully protected and better off.</p>
<p>CARLTON:</p>
<p>Will the States get a better deal out of the GST?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I think the States will find it a good deal. I am going to talk....I</p>
<p>   have had some discussion and I am continuing discussions with the</p>
<p>   Premiers but they certainly won't be any worse off.</p>
<p>CARLTON:</p>
<p>Will they get a guaranteed share?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, they will get a good deal out of it. I am not going to go</p>
<p>   into the detail of that, I am sorry, except to say that the States</p>
<p>   will certainly not be worse off. And I believe they will find themselves</p>
<p>   better off.</p>
<p>CARLTON:</p>
<p>Will it be a move away then from the annual brawl of Premiers'</p>
<p>   Conferences and Loans Councils, or whatever they are called these</p>
<p>   days, COAGs or whatever they are? The horse trading that goes on...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I don't know that you will ever eliminate that, but this will</p>
<p>   certainly be a cleaner, simpler approach.</p>
<p>CARLTON:</p>
<p>All right. You are sure you have got it right. No confusion over</p>
<p>   birthday cakes, candles etc?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I am ready for the first birthday cake question.</p>
<p>CARLTON:</p>
<p>All right, okay, I am sure you are.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I am all primed up for birthday cakes, but I probably won't</p>
<p>   get asked.</p>
<p>CARLTON:</p>
<p>Bet you're good on cakes. Unemployment. The new figures today</p>
<p>   starts rising again Â 8.3 per cent in July. You had a problem</p>
<p>   there, it was going down, it is going up again.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well the participation rate has gone up. That is there are more</p>
<p>   people looking for work now because they think things are better.</p>
<p>   If it were going in the other direction it would mean they were</p>
<p>   thinking things were getting worse. The total number of jobs went</p>
<p>   up again....</p>
<p>CARLTON:</p>
<p>By 10,000.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes, we have now created 303,000 jobs Â 303,000 jobs in two</p>
<p>   years and four months. That's not bad. </p>
<p>CARLTON:</p>
<p>This is the same script that Bob Hawke used to trot out and Paul</p>
<p>   Keating used to trot out and Simon Crean used to trot out Â</p>
<p>   "it's created more jobs". Unemployment hasn't</p>
<p>   shifted.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>It is a question of whether it is right.</p>
<p>CARLTON:</p>
<p>Oh all right.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, we have created 303 000 jobs. </p>
<p>CARLTON:</p>
<p>The Budget forecast is 7.75% unemployment, going down. Yours is</p>
<p>   going up.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, you have to understand that it does bounce around from year</p>
<p>   to year Â month-to-month, I'm sorry.</p>
<p>CARLTON:</p>
<p>Are you concerned that this Jobs Network thing has got faults,</p>
<p>   flaws and holes in it, that it needs perhaps repairing, fine-tuning?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>The information I have as of yesterday is no, that inevitably when</p>
<p>   a very different and new system like that is brought in, that you</p>
<p>   have some settling-in challenges and problems, but the preliminary</p>
<p>   statistics - and I know Dr Kemp will be having something more to</p>
<p>   say about this very soon - that it has been in a number of important</p>
<p>   areas more successful than the CES.</p>
<p>CARLTON:</p>
<p>A lot of the private companies are saying they can't make</p>
<p>   it work for them, they're not making an income out of getting</p>
<p>   people into jobs, they're not getting the computer access they</p>
<p>   need, and there are suggestions that there is chaos in some parts</p>
<p>   of it.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, you have to understand that when you have a multiplicity</p>
<p>   of people involved, you are going to get, I guess, a multiplicity</p>
<p>   of reactions. I mean, this is something that is quite new, it has</p>
<p>   never been tried before, and inevitably there will be some settling-</p>
<p>   in problems and it really is too early to be making a judgement</p>
<p>   of the kind that is being made. I notice one of the newspapers -</p>
<p>   The Australian - is running a series of articles condemning</p>
<p>   it. I mean they ran a series of articles a few months ago alleging</p>
<p>   that the National Heritage Trust of Australia had been rorted in</p>
<p>   favour of Coalition electorates, and yet when we threw it back to</p>
<p>   the Auditor-General he said that that claim was completely wrong.</p>
<p>   I would ask of Job Network that it be given more time before people</p>
<p>   start making adverse judgments, otherwise they may end up with very</p>
<p>   red faces on the subject.</p>
<p>CARLTON:</p>
<p>All right. Pure politics now, perhaps. Has One Nation got the Coalition</p>
<p>   rattled?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No. I think it has unnerved some individuals but ....</p>
<p>CARLTON:</p>
<p>It's unnerved the National Party.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I don't believe it has unnerved the leadership of the National</p>
<p>   Party, and I don't believe it has unnerved the great bulk of</p>
<p>   the Nats. I think some people in Queensland were surprised at the</p>
<p>   result in that State. You've got to remember that was the State</p>
<p>   election. I find it quite astonishing that people suggested that</p>
<p>   some how or other it was a judgment on the Federal Coalition.</p>
<p>CARLTON:</p>
<p>People like Bob Katter for example.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Because after all it was a State election. The only way that you</p>
<p>   can deal with One Nation effectively is to offer the Australian</p>
<p>   public something better. This idea that there is one....</p>
<p>CARLTON:</p>
<p>But they are having a... their shadow is looming larger. Things</p>
<p>   like the back down on Telstra and so on.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>You have to take a medium and longer term view of these things.</p>
<p>   You can't react in an overnight sense to One Nation or indeed</p>
<p>   to anything else. In the end you are judged by the quality of the</p>
<p>   positive things you do, not by the way you react to your opponents</p>
<p>   and the best thing that the Coalition can do is to govern well,</p>
<p>   to continue to offer good policy and good leadership on important</p>
<p>   issues and that is why we are pressing ahead with our tax reform</p>
<p>   plan. Now this tax reform plan will be the biggest single change</p>
<p>   to the Australian taxation system since World War II. It will further</p>
<p>   strengthen our economic future. It will offer a sense of leadership</p>
<p>   and direction into the 21st Century that neither the</p>
<p>   Labor Party led by Mr Beazley or One Nation led by Mrs Hanson is</p>
<p>   willing to do. On this issue Beazley and Hanson are inseparable.</p>
<p>   Beazley and Hanson are both about....</p>
<p>CARLTON:</p>
<p>Hey?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>They are. Mr Beazley and Mrs Hanson on tax reform are absolutely</p>
<p>   the same. Neither of them...</p>
<p>CARLTON:</p>
<p>What do you mean? They don't want a GST.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>They don't want to change the present system. They are content.</p>
<p>   I mean, you can't walk both sides of the street on tax reform,</p>
<p>   any more than you can walk it on any other issue that is important.</p>
<p>   You are either for or against the present Australian taxation system.</p>
<p>   And Mr Beazley and Mrs Hanson are in exactly the same posi</p>
