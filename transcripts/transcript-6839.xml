FOR MEDIA February 14 1986<br />
Mrs Penelope Seidler has been appointed a member of the official<br />
Establishments Trust for a three year term. She is a practicing<br />
architect with an interest in historic buildings and has been<br />
involved with the Institute of Architects on restoration awards.<br />
This appointment fills a vacancy created by the retirement of Mr<br />
Guilford Bell who has served on the Trust since its inception in<br />
September 1979 and before that with the Committee on Official<br />
Establishments since September 1976.<br />
I would like to place on record the Government's appreciation for<br />
the valuable time and effort given by Mr Bell during his period<br />
in office.<br />
Two other members of the Trust have had their terms of<br />
appointment extended; the Chairman, Sir John Bunting, AC, KBE,<br />
for a further three years to January 1989 and Mrs F. D. Crean for<br />
three years to September 1988.<br />
The official Establishments Trust advises the Government on the<br />
conservation, development and efficient operation of the<br />
buildings and grounds of the four official residences, Government<br />
House and The Lodge in Canberra and Admiralty House and<br />
Kirribilli House in Sydney.<br />
other members of the Trust include Lady Parkinson of Canberra and<br />
Mr J. G. Gosse of Sydney. </p>
