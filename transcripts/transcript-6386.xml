PRIME MINISTER<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, DINNER FOLLOWING<br />
OPENING OF THE FEDERATION OF ETHNIC COMMUNITIES COUNCIL<br />
OF AUSTRALIA HEADQUARTERS, SYDNEY., 26 APRIL 1984<br />
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN<br />
IT GIVES ME GREAT PLEASURE TO BE WITH YOU THIS EVENING AS WE<br />
CELEBRATE THE OPENING OF THE NEW HEADQUARTERS FOR THE<br />
FEDERATION OF ETHNIC COMMUNITIES COUNCIL OF AUSTRALIA,<br />
IDO NOT BRING TO YOUR AREAS OF INTEREST SOME CONCERN RECENTLY<br />
ACQUIRED AS PRIME MINISTER OF AUSTRALIA. FOR FROM MY EARLIEST<br />
TIME OF CONTEMPLATION ABOUT OUR GREAT COUNTRY I HAVE PERCEIVED<br />
MUCH OF THAT GREATNESS, AND POTENTIAL FOR GREATNESS, TO BE<br />
ASSOCIATED WITH OUR READINESS TO OPEN UP OUR LAND TO THOSE<br />
WHO WOULD JOIN US FROM OTHER COUNTRIES.<br />
IN JOINING THE* AUSTRALIAN LABOR PARTY IN MY FIRST YEAR AT<br />
THE UNIVERSITY OF W. A. IN 1947, AND IN ESTABLISHING THE FIRST<br />
BRANCH OF THE PARTY THERE IN 1948, ONE. OF THE REASONS WAS A<br />
SENSE OF EXCITEMENT AND IDENTIFICATION WITH THE VAST<br />
IMMIGRATION PROGRAM THEN BEING INITIATED BY THE GREAT LABOR<br />
GOVERNMENTS OF THE WAR AND IMMEDIATE POST-WAR PERIODS.<br />
IN MY WAY, THEN, I ATTEMPTED TO PLAY SOME PART IN THIS<br />
OPENING UP PROCESS BY ESTABLISHING ALSO THE AUSTRALIAN-OVERSEAS<br />
STUDENTS CLUB AT THE UNIVERSITY TO BR[ NG CLOSER TOGETHER THOSE<br />
FROM DIVERSE NATIONAL BACKGROUNDS, </p>
<p>2.<br />
AND AS PRESIDENT OF THE AUSTRALIAN COUNCIL OF TRADE UNIONS<br />
IN THE DECADE OF THE 1970' s I PARTICIPATED FULLY WITH THE'<br />
GOVERNMENTS OF BOTH POLITICAL PERSUASIONS IN THEIR WORK<br />
DEALING WITH IMMIGRATION POLICIES AND PROGRAMS.<br />
AND SO I STAND BEFORE YOU TONIGHT, PROUDLY, AS ONE WITH<br />
ALMOST FORTY YEARS OF COMMITMENT TO, AND ACTION IN SUPPORT<br />
OF THOSE CONCEPTS AND ISSUES WHICH ARE SO IMPORTANT TO ALL<br />
OF YOU,<br />
THE FEDERATION IS MAKING AN IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTION TO THE<br />
QUALITY OF AUSTRALIAN LIFE, YOUR ROLE IN PROMOTING JOINT<br />
ACTION AND CO-OPERATION BETWEEN THE ETHNIC COMMUNITIES ON<br />
ISSUES OF COMMON CONCERN IS CRUCIAL, YOURS IS NOT JUST<br />
A CO-ORDINATING ROLE, YOU ALSO HAVE A ROLE IN HELPING TO<br />
ENSURE ETHNIC COMMUNITIES IN AUSTRALIA ARE ABLE TO<br />
PARTICIPATE IN AUSTRALIAN LIFE ON AN EQUAL BASIS,<br />
AS WELL YOU HAVE A ROLE IN ENCOURAGING THE DEVELOPMENT<br />
OF THE SOCIAL AND CULTURAL LIFE OF THE VARIOUS COMMUNITIES.<br />
YOUR CONGRESS LATER THIS YEAR WILL BE A LANDMARK IN BRINGING<br />
ETHNIC COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT AUSTRALIA TOGETHER. </p>
<p>THE DISTINCTIVE CONTRIBUTION THE ETHNIC COMMUNITIES MAKE TO<br />
OUR SOCIETY ENSURE$ A RICHER, MORE DIVERSE AND BETTER<br />
AUSTRALIA, I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE PARTICULAR MENTION OF THE<br />
CHINESE COMMUNITY, UNDERSTAND THE SUPPORT EXTENDED BY THE<br />
CHINESE COMMUNITY HAS BEEN VITAL TO THE FEDERATION. MORE<br />
SPECIFICALLY I HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT THE NEW HEADQUARTERS<br />
HAVE BEEN MADE AVAILABLE WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF THE CONSIDERABLE<br />
GENEROSITY OF THE CHINESE COMMUNITY THIS GENEROSITY IS TO<br />
IE APPLAUDED.<br />
AT* THE HEART OF THE FEDERATION' S TASK HAS BEEN THE PROMOTION OF<br />
A: M4ULTICULTURAL AUSTRALIA.<br />
THERE IS NOTHING ffHIGH-FALLUTIN" OR 11NE W FANGLED" a ABOUT THE<br />
IDEA OF A MULTICULTURAL AUSTRALIA, AUSTRALIA HAS BEEN<br />
DEVELOPING TOWARDS A MULTICULTURAL SOCIETY FOR NEARLY 200<br />
YEARS AS EACH SUCCEEDING WAVE OF IMMIGRANTS HAS ADDED TO THE<br />
DIVERSITY OF OUR CULTURAL TRADITIONS. THE PROCESS HAS<br />
ACCELE RATED MARKEDLY IN MORE RECENT TIMES AND PARTICULARLY<br />
SINCE THE END OF THE LAST WAR# THE EFFECT HAS BEEN THAT VIE<br />
HAVE NOW DEVELOPED AS ONE OF THE MORE TRULY GLOBAL NATIONS;<br />
OP THE WORLD. </p>
<p>L.<br />
' MULTICULTURAL' IS MORE THAN A DESCRIPTIVE TERM TO DESIGNATE<br />
A SOCIETY MADE UP OF DIFFERENT ETHNIC GROUPS-IT IS ALSO AN<br />
APPROACH TO POLICY FORMULATION AND RESOURCE ALLOCATION WHICH<br />
SEEKS TO PROVIDE FOR EQUALITY OF ACCESS AND OPPORTUNITY-IT<br />
DESIGNATES A SOCIETY WHICH SUPPORTS A COMMON GROUP OF<br />
INSTITUTIONS, LEGAL RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS, WHILE LEAVING<br />
INDIVIDUALS FREE TO MAINTAIN THEIR RELIGION, LANGUAGE AND<br />
CULTURAL CUSTOMS. A MULTICULTURAL SOCIETY IS A VITAL AND<br />
TOLERANT AND PROGRESSIVE COMMUNITY IN WHICH ALL GROUPS, BE<br />
THEY ABORIGINAL, ANGLO-CELTIC, EUROPEAN, ASIAN, LATIN<br />
AMERICAN, OR MIDDLE EASTERN, OR FROM ANY OTHER OF THE ETHNIC<br />
GROUPINGS WE FIND IN OUR SOCIETY TODAY, MAKE AN IMPORTANT<br />
CONTRIBUTION TO THE RICHNESS, THE DEPTH AND TRADITIONS OF<br />
OUR NATION*<br />
MR JEGOROW<br />
SOME TIME AGO YOU SAID;<br />
" AUSTRALIAN PEOPLE HAVE ACCESS TO THE MAJORITY OF THE<br />
WORLD'S CULTURES AND LANGUAGES. HAVE THE MEANS<br />
TO BUILD UP A NATION WITH EQUALITY OF OPPORTUNITY FOR<br />
ALL AUSTRALIANS REGARDLESS OF RACE, CREED OR CULTURAL<br />
ORIGIN THAT IS A NATION THAT IS SOCIALLY COHESIVE,<br />
PROSPEROUS AND CONSCIOUS NOT ONLY OF ITS OBLIGATIONS TO<br />
ITS OWN PEOPLE BUT ALSO OF ITS RESONSIBILITY TOWARDS<br />
C: </p>
<p>POORER AND LESS FORTUNATE COUNTRIES-SUCH DEVELOPMENT<br />
WILL NOT OCCUR ACCIDENTALLY BUT ONLY THROUGH GOOD WILL,<br />
AWAR* ENESS AND RESPECT OF OUR COMMON HUMANITY, AND THE<br />
REALISATION THAT ALL CULTURES HAVE POSITIVE ASPECTS<br />
WHICH CAN BE SHARED,.<br />
TIS I BELIEVE IS THE LOGIC OF A MULTICULTURAL APPROACHPERSONALLY<br />
I-FULLY SUBSCRIBE TO ITFEw'OF<br />
YOU HERE TONIGHT WOULD DISAGREE WITH THE BROAD TER~ MS<br />
OF A MULTICULTURAL SOCIETY-M'AN4Y OF YOU, HOWEVER, HAVE MORE<br />
SPECIFIC CONCERNS, CONCERNS WHICH YOUR FEDERATION HAS BEEN<br />
ASSI DUOUS IN DRAWING To THE ATTENTIONOF GOVERNMENTS. FECCA<br />
HAS MADE SUBMISSIONS TO VARIOUS BODIES SUCH AS THE HUMAN<br />
RIGHTS COMMISSION AND THE SCHOOLS COMMISSION, TO REVIEWS<br />
BEING. UNDERTAKEN SUCH AS THAT INTO THE SPECIAL BROADCASTING<br />
SERVICE AND THE AUSTRALIAN INSTITUTE OF MULTICULTURAL<br />
AFFAIRS. THE. FEDERATION ALSO MADE A USEFUL CONTRIBUTION TO<br />
THE DELIBERATIONS OF THlE NATIONAL ECONOMIC SUMMIT LAST YEARONE<br />
01e THE UNDJERLYING THEMES OF YOUR SUBMISSIONS HAS BEEN<br />
THE CONCERN THAT THE NEXUS BETWEEN ETHNICITY AND<br />
DISADVANTAGE BE BROKEN. THE AUSTRALIAN LABOR GOVERNMENT<br />
SHARES THIS CONCERN. THE PARTICULAR CONTRIBUTION TO<br />
AUSTRALIAN LIFE OF THE ETHNIC COMMUNITIES SHOULD BE<br />
RECO6NISED AND APPRECIATED AS PART OF OUR NATIONAL HERITAGE-</p>
<p>6Ã¸<br />
THE GOVERNMENT GIVES PARTICULAR PRIORITY TO ITS SPECIAL<br />
MIGRANT AND ETHNIC PROGRAMS AND SERVICE AS WELL AS TO<br />
DEVELOPING MORE RESPONSIVE MAINSTREAM SERVICES THROUGH EQUAL<br />
EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY PROGRAMS.<br />
THE GOVERNMENT.-IS ALSO DIRECTLY , SUPPORTIVE OF BODIES. SUCH AS<br />
THE FEDERATION-I CAN ASSURE YOU I RECOGNISE TNE IMPORTANCE<br />
TO THE FEDERATION OF ADEQUATE GOVERNMENT SUPPORT.<br />
ANY SOUND IMMIGRATION POLICY MUST DE BACKED BY APPROPRIATELY<br />
SUPPORTIVE EDUCATION POLICIESEDUCATIONAL<br />
SUPPORT IS CRUCIAL TO HELPING NEW ARRIVALS BOTH<br />
FEEL MORE AT HOME AND MORE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN OUR<br />
SOCIETY. THROUGH THE ADULT MIGRANT EDUCATION PROGRAM THE<br />
COMMONWEALTH FUNDS " ON-ARRIVALM AND ' ON-GOING* ENGLISH<br />
LANGUAGE TRAINING COURSES FOR MIGRANTS AND REFUGEES.<br />
EXPENDITURC FOR THESE PROGRAMS ROSE BY OVER 14 PER CENT LAST<br />
YEAR, AND INCLUDED PROVISION OF FUNDS FOR INCREASING THE<br />
NUMBER OF PERMANENT TEACHERS IN THIS AREA. ARRANGEMENTS ARE<br />
ALSO UNDERWAY TO ESTABLISH A NEW MATERIALS AND SYLLABUS<br />
DEVELOPMENT CENTRE TO INCREASE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF ENGLISH<br />
LANGUAGE TEACHING THROUGH BETTER PROFESSIONAL SUPPORT-</p>
<p>7.<br />
AS WELL, FUNDS HAVE BEEN ALLOCATED TO EXPAND AND IMPROVE<br />
OCCUPATIONAL ENGLISH CLASSES FOR MIGRANTS IN THE WORKPLACEA.<br />
MAJOR THRUST OF MY GOVERNMENT'S EDUCATION POLICY HAS BEEN<br />
TO PROVIDE EQUALITY OF EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITY TO ALL<br />
CHILDREN. WE AIM TO ENSURE THAT NO CHILD'S EDUCATION OR<br />
DEVELOPMENT SHOULD BE PENALISED BY ECONOMIC, SOCIAL OR<br />
CULTURAL BACKGRfOUNDi LACK OF FINANCIAL SUPPORT OR LACK OF<br />
SUITABLE OPPORTUNITIES. IN THIS REGARD ETHNIC CHILDREN'S<br />
NEEDS COMMAND PARTICULAR ATTENTION.<br />
WE ARE WELL AWARE OF THE IMPORTANCE OF EDUCATION IN<br />
ASSISTING MIGRANTS IN THE SETTLEMENT PROCESS THIS HAS BEEN<br />
VERY MUCH PART OF OUR THINKING IN ADDRESSING EDUCATION<br />
ISSUES* EXISTING COMMONWEALTH EDUCATION PROGRAMS ARE BEING<br />
CHANGED TO GIVE INCREASED EMPHASIS AND ASSISTANCE TO THOSE<br />
SCHOOLS MOST IN NEED. THE GOVERNMENT HAS AN UNSWERVING<br />
COMMITMENT TO THIS APPROACH. REGRETTABLY A<br />
DISPROPRTIONATELY LARGE NUMBER OF ETHNIC CHILDREN ARE AMONG<br />
THE STUDENTS OF SUCH SCHOOLS. INDEED I WOULD NOTE THAT THE<br />
MAJORITY OF NEEDY GOVERNMENT AND NON-GOVERNMENT SCHOOLS ARE<br />
MORE OFTEN THAN NOT PRECISELY THOSE HAVING TO CATER FOR A<br />
WIDE RANGE OF ETHNIC AND SOCIO-ECONOMIC BACKGROUNDS-THE<br />
NEEDS OF SUCH SCHOOLS HAVE BEEN GIVEN A PARTICULAR PRIORITY<br />
IN GOVERNMENT FUNDING ARRANGEMENTSAs" </p>
<p>THE GOVERNMENT HAS ALSO INTRODUCED THE PARTICIPATION AND<br />
EQU~ iTY PROGRAM TO TACKLE CONCERNS WE HAVE BOTH AT THE LOW<br />
NUMBERS OF CHILDREN COMPLETING FULL SECONDARY EDUCATION,<br />
EITHER IN SCHOOL OR TECHNICAL AND FURTHER EDUCATION, AND AT<br />
THE INEQUALITY IN EDUCATIONAL OUTCOME FOR CHILDREN FROM<br />
DIFFERENT BACKGROUNDS. THIS PROGRAM HAS ALSO, IN LINE WITH<br />
THE OENERAL THRUST OF THE AUSTRALIAN INSTITUTE OF<br />
M'ULTICULTURAL AFFAIRS REVIEW OF THE~ POST ARRIVAL PROGRAMS<br />
AND SERVICES, GIVEN EMPHASIS TO THE SPECIAL NEEDS OF<br />
M4IGRANTS. THE~ I$ OERNME14T RECOGNISES THAT THE LANGUAGES OF ITS ETHNIC<br />
AND ABORIGINAL COMMUNITIES ARE A VITAL NATIONAL RESOU~ RCEWE<br />
ALSO ATTACH CONSIDERABLE IMPORTANCE TO THE PROVISION OP<br />
TEACHING ENGLISH AS A SECOND LANGUAGE, PARTICULARLY USING A<br />
BILINGUAL APPROACH WHEN CHILDREN DO NOT SPEAK ENGLISH-IT<br />
Is IMPORTANT THAT POLICIES IN THIS AREA BE PART Of A<br />
CONERENTo PROPERLY CO-ORDINATED APPROACHIWOULD<br />
ALSO NOTE THAT TRANSLATION AND INTERPRETATION<br />
SERVICES ARE VITAL FOR ENSURING ACCESS TO COMMUNITY SERVICE<br />
AND BENEFITS-</p>
<p>9..<br />
YOU WILL BE AWARE THAT THE SENATE STANDING COMMITTEE ON<br />
EDUCATION AND THE ARTS IS CONDUCTING AN INQUIRY INTO A<br />
NATIONAL LANGUAGE POLICY. THEIR REPORT IS DUE IN THE MIDDLE<br />
OF. THIS YEAR-IN THE MEANTIME COMMONWEALTH AUTHORITIES SUCH<br />
AS THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AND YOUTH AFFAIRS AND THE<br />
BUREAU OF STATISTICS HAVE BEEN CONDUCTING SURVEYS ON<br />
LANGUAGE LEARNING IN SCHOOLS AND LANGUAGE USAGE INTHE<br />
COMMUNITY. OUT OF THESE INQUIRIES AND REVIEWS I SHOULD HOPE<br />
A BASIS MIGHT BE FOUND FOR ThE DEVELOPMENT OF COHERENT AND<br />
APPROPRIATE POLICIES IN THIS IMPORTANT AREAMY<br />
COLLEAGUE SENATOR RYAN, THE MINISTER FOR EDUCATION AND<br />
YOUTH AFFAIRS, HAS RECENTLY ANNOUNCED THE MEMBERSHIP OF THE<br />
NATIONAL ADVISORY AND CO-ORDINATING COMMITTEE ON<br />
MULTICULTURAL EDUCATION TO BE HEADED BY PROFESSOR<br />
JAYASURIYA, HEAD OF THE DEPARTMENT'OF SOCIAL WORK AND SOCIAL<br />
ADMINISTRATION AT THE UNIVERSITY OF WESTERN AUSTRALIA. THIS<br />
COMMITTEE WILL ADVISE THE GOVERNMENT ON THE CULTURAL<br />
RESOURCES AVAILABLE AND CHANGES NEEDED TO THe EDUCATION<br />
SYSTEM SO THAT IT BETTER REFLECTS THE ETHNIC COMPOSITION OF<br />
THE AUSTRALIAN COMMUNITY AND PROVIDES FOR EQUITY OF OUTCOMETHIS<br />
COMMITTEE IS AN IMPORTANT STRENGTHENING OF THE LINKS<br />
BETWEEN THE ETHNIC GROUPS IN THE COMMUNITY AND THE EDUCATION<br />
SYSTEM-I HAVE NOTED THAT THE FtOERATION HAS ITS OWN LINKS<br />
WITH THIS IMPORTANT COMMITTEE-</p>
<p>WHEN MIGRANTS ADOPT AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP THEY TAKE ON THE<br />
RIGHTS AS WELL AS THE RESPONSIBILITIES OF THEIR NEW<br />
NATI. ONALITY-* THEY HAVE THE RIGHT TO WORK TO FULFIL THEIR<br />
DREAMS FOR FREEDOM AND ECONOMIC BETTERMENT FOR THEMSELVES<br />
AND THEIR FAMILIES. THEY ALSO HAVE THE RIGHT OF RECOGNITION<br />
THAT. THEIR CHILDREN ARE THE CHILDREN OF AUSTRALIA, AND THAT<br />
THOSE AUSTRALIAN CHILDREN MUST HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO<br />
DEVELOP THEIR FULLEST HUMAN POTENTIAL.<br />
IT . IS BECAUSE OF THEIR DETERMINATION TO REALISE THESE DREAMS<br />
FOR THEMSELVES AND THEIR CHILDREN THAT WOMEN FROM ETHNIC<br />
COMMUNITIES HAVE FOR SO LONG WORKED IN JOBS OFTEN INSECURE,<br />
POORLY PAID, UNDER-UNIONISED AND UNHEALTHY. A LACK OF REAL<br />
OPPORTUNITIES FOR MANY OF THEM TO LEARN ENGLISH HAS LED TO<br />
THE PERPETUATION OF THESE DISADVANTAGES-IT IS NOW<br />
WELL-KNOWN AND WELL-DOCUMENTED THAT THESE WOMEN SUFFER<br />
PARTICULAR DISADVANTAGES RELATING TO HEALTH, OCCUPATIONAL<br />
HEALTH AND SAFETYj PSYCHIATRIC CARE, DISCRIMINATION IN<br />
EMPLOYMENT, AND LEARNING ENGLISH AS A SECOND LANGUAGE.<br />
IN LINE WITH ITS ELECTION COMMITMENTS, THE GOVERNMENT HAS<br />
TAKEN MANY INITIATIVES TO REDRESS THE PROBLEMS FACED BY<br />
MIGRANT WOMEN-WE HAVE PASSED THE SEX DISCRIMINATION ACT,<br />
WHICH WILL PROVIDE REDRESS FOR MIGRANT WOMEN WHO SUFFER FROM<br />
DISCHIMINATION IN EMPLOYMENT, HOUSING OR ACCESS TO SERVICES,<br />
OR FROM SEXUAL HARRASSMENT IN THE WORKPLACE' </p>
<p>rL II I 1II<br />
WE HAVE ESTABLISHED A MIGRANT WOMEN'S DESK IN THE DEPARTMENT<br />
OF IMMIGRATION AND ETHNIC AFFAIRS, WE HAVE PROVIDED<br />
SUBSTANTIAL FUNDS FOR CHILD CARE FACILITIES IN ASSOCIATION<br />
WITH ENGLISH LANGUAGE CLASSES, TO HELP ENSURE THAT MIGRANT<br />
WOMEN ARE ABLE TO ATTEND THOSE CLASSES, WE HAVE ALLOCATED<br />
FUNDS WITHIN THE WOMEN's EMERGENCY SERVICES PROGRAM TO<br />
EMPLOY ETHNIC WORKERS IN WOMEN'S REFUGES, MIGRANT WOMEN<br />
WILL BE REPRESENTED IN THE GOVERNMENT'S NEW ARRANGEMENTS<br />
FOR CONSULTATION WITH WOMEN'S ORGANISATIONS AND INTEREST<br />
GROUPS, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN<br />
AUSTRALIA'S IMMIGRATION POLICY IS FIRMLY GROUNDED IN THE<br />
POLICY OF NON-DISCRIMINIATION INTRODUCED BY THE LABOR<br />
GOVERNMENT IN 1973, AND CONTINUED BY THE COALITION. IT IS<br />
APPLIED EVENLY REGARDLESS OF NATIONALITY, RACE OR CREED,<br />
NO RACIAL GROUP OR GEOGRAPHICAL AREA IS BEING FAVOURED BY OUR<br />
MIGRATION POLICY.<br />
A BIPARTISAN POLICY IN THIS AREA IS OP CRUCIAL NATIONAL<br />
IMPORTANCE SPLITTING THE DEATE ALONG POLITICAL AND<br />
PARTISAN LINES WOULD ONLY SERVE TO CAUSE WHOLELY UNDESIRABLE:<br />
DIVISIONS WITHIN OUR SOCIETY. </p>
<p>12.<br />
THERE IS NO DISCRIMINATION IN ANY PART OR ASPECT OF<br />
AUSTRALIA'S IMMIGRATION PROGRAM-WE HAVE PUT BEHIND US<br />
FOREVER THE DAYS WHEN ANY SUCH DISCRIMINATION MIGHT HAVE<br />
BEEN ALLOWED TO OPERATETHE<br />
RECENT INCREASE IN THE ASIAN PERCENTAGE OF THE TOTAL<br />
MIGRATION PROGRAM IS A RESULT OF FACTORS SUlCH AS LESSENING<br />
INTEREST IN SPONSORSHIPS FROM MIGRANTS IN MORE TRADITIONAL<br />
SOURCE COUNTRIESJ THE PREVAILING PATTERN IN THE GOVERNMENT'S<br />
REFUGEE PROGRAM AND THE STRONG PRIORITY GIVEN BY THIS<br />
GOVERNMENT AND THE WHITLAM AND FRASER GOVERNMENTS TO THE<br />
REUNION OF FAMILIES. PARTICULARLY THOSE CAUGHT IN TRAGIC<br />
CIRCUMSTANCES OP WAR AND CIVIL STRIFEAUSTRALIA<br />
HtAS A PROUD IECORD IN ASSISTING REFUGEES. MANY OF<br />
YOU HERE WOULD KNOW THE ANGUISH, THE HUMAN SUFFERING, THE<br />
HUMAN WASTE OF TIlE REFUGEES' PLIGHT. I BELIEVE AUSTRALIANS<br />
WILL CONTINUE TO SUPPORT STRONGLY POLICIES PROVIDING FOR A<br />
SUBSTANTIAL INTAKE OF REFUGEESTHE<br />
GOVERNMENT BELIEVES, HOWEVER, THAT RESETTLEMENT ALONE IS<br />
NOT THE ANSWER TO THE REFUGEE PROBLEM. PROVISION SHOULD<br />
ALSO BE MADE FOR VOLUNTARY REPATIIATION TO COUNTRIES OF<br />
ORIGIN, ORDERLY DEPARTURE ARRANGEMENTS ( AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO<br />
THE COST AND TRAUMA OF ILLEGAL DEPARTURES), AND INCREASED<br />
INVOLVEMENT BY THE UNITED NATIONS HIGH COMMISSIONER FOR<br />
REFUGEES. </p>
<p>THESE ARE ALL NECESSARY ELEMENTS IN ANY SOUNDLY BASED<br />
REFUGEE POLICY. THE GOVERNMENT IS WORKING TO SEE THAT ITS<br />
OWN APPROACH-REFLECTS A BALANCED MIX OF' ALL THESE ELEMENT91<br />
* PUTTING THE SAME POINT ANOTHER WAY -WE HAVE MOVED FROM A<br />
SIMPLE RESETTLEMENT POLICY TO A POLICY WHICH SEEKS A VARIETY'<br />
00OLtO NG-TERM SOLUTIONS TO A COMPLEX PROBLEM.<br />
As REG ARDS IMMIGRATION POLICY MORE GENERALLY, THE<br />
GOVERNMENT CONSIDERS THAT ANY RETURN TO A DISCRIMINATORY<br />
* QUOTA SYSTEM IN OUR MIGRATION PROGRAM WOULD BE A RETROGRADE<br />
STEP. IT WOULD ENCOURAGE THE PREJUDICED. IT WOULD DEPRIVE<br />
OUR COUNTRY NOT ONLY OF ITS INTERNATIONAL REPUTATION AS A<br />
HUMANE AND TOLERANT SOCIETY, BUT ALSO OF THE CREATIVE<br />
VITALITY WHICH IS BUILT UP THROUGH THE CULTURAL<br />
CONTRIBUTIONS FROM ALL ETHNIC GROUPS.<br />
IT IS SOMETIMES ASSETED THAT TODAY'S MIGRANTS ARE COMPETING<br />
IN A MARKET WHERE JOBS ARE SCARCE AND DEPRIVING THOSE<br />
ALREADY HERE OF JOB OPPORTUNITIES. WE NEED TO BE WARY OF<br />
DRAWING TOO SIMPLISTIC CONCLUSIONS ON SUCH MATTERS. NEW<br />
ARRIVALS, AND THERE HAVE BEEN SIGNIFICANTLY-FEWER OF THEM<br />
LATELY, NEED NOT NECESSARILY BE COMPETITORS FOR A LIMITED<br />
NUMBER OF JOBS. AUSTRALIAN IMMIGRATION POLICY,. WHILE REFLECTING<br />
A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT CRITERIA. DOES INCLUDE A CONSIDERED<br />
ASSESSMENT THAT THOSE ADMITTED ARE THOSE BRINGING SKILLS<br />
IN SCARCE SUPPLY. </p>
<p>141.<br />
A TOTAL* LABOUR FORCE PLANNING SYSTEM AS IT AFFECTS MIGRATION<br />
POLI CIES IS EXPECTED TO OPERATE FROM THE BEGINNING OF<br />
1984/ 85, IT WILL INVOLVE INTEGRATING FOR THE FIRST TIME<br />
,~ AUSTRALIAN LABOUR PLANNING, EDUCATION AND IMMIGRATION<br />
POLICIES. THE SYSTEM WILL INVOLVE A FORWARD ASSESSMgNT OF LABOUR<br />
REQUIREMENTS IN THE APPROXIMATELY 60 MAJOR SKILLED<br />
OCCUPATIONS, o IN WHICH INTERNATIONAL MIGRATION HAS RECENTLY<br />
PLAYED A SIGNIFICANT ROLE, THE DEPARTMENT OF EMPLOYMENT AND<br />
INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS HAS BEEN TASKED WITH PROVIDING AN<br />
ANNUAL REPORT ON SKILLED LABOUR MARKET NEEDS FROM WHICH A<br />
CEILING OF OCCUPATIONAL ANNUAL SHARES WILL BE SET FOR<br />
SKILLED MIGRATION PURPOSES, THESE CEILINGS WILL BE<br />
REASSESSED HALF YEARLY.<br />
WHERE LONG TERM CHANGES IN THE BALANCE OF EDUCATIONAL<br />
POLICIES AND PRACTICE ARE IDENTIFIED THESE WILL THEN BE FED<br />
INTO THE COMMONWEALTH TERTIARY EDUCATION COMMISSION' S<br />
TRIENNIAL PLANNING PROCESSg<br />
MY COLLEAGUE THE MINISTER FOR EMPLOYMENT AND INDUSTRIAL<br />
RELATIONS, MR WILLIS, ALSO EXPECTS TO USE THE RECENTLY<br />
ANNOUNCED REVIEW OF COMMONWEALTH LABOUR M~ ARKET PROGRAMS AS A<br />
BASIS FOR DEVELOPING AND IMPROVING FLEXIBILITY IN TRAINING<br />
AND RETRAINING SYSTEMS. </p>
<p>151<br />
THE NEW STRATEGY IS TO COVER SHORT TERM SHORTAGES, AND IN<br />
THE LONG TERM, CHANGE THE BALANCE BETWEEN DOMESTIC AND<br />
OVERSEAS SKILLED LABOUR SUPPLY TO THE BENEFIT OF WORKERS<br />
WITHIN AUSTRALIAl<br />
THE OPENNESS OF OUR SOCIETY SHOULD ALLOW AUSTRALIANS TO<br />
HOLD MANY DIFFERENT AND SUBSIDIARY IDENTITIES AND LOYALTIES<br />
WITHOUT DETRACTING FROM OUR NATIONAL UNITY@ THE' OLD<br />
STEREOTYPE OF THE ftTYPICAL AUSSIE" CAN GIVE US ALL SOME REASON<br />
FOR HISTORICAL PRIDE BECAUSE IT EMBODIED MANY DESIRABLE<br />
QUALITIES; BUT IF SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EQUITY, WHICH ARE<br />
AMONGST THOSE QUALITIES, ARE TO REMAIN MEANINGFUL CONCEPTS<br />
IN TODAY'fS AND TOMORROW'Is AUSTRALIA, THEN THE VISION<br />
OF OURSELVES As AUSTRALIANS MUST REFLECT THE CHANGING<br />
REALITIES OF OUR DEMOGRAPHIC AND CULTURAL COMPOSITIONt<br />
MY GOVERNMENT IS COMMITTED TO ACHIEVIHG SOCIAL JUSTICE AND<br />
EQUITY IN A NUMBER OF WAYS; THROUGH PROPOSED AMENDMENTS TO<br />
THE AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP ACT TO ELIMINATE DISCRIMINATORY<br />
PROVISIONS; THROUGH THE INCLUSION OF PEOPLE OF NON-ENGLISH<br />
SPEAKING BACKGROUND ON ADVISORY COUNCILS AND OTHER REPRESENTATIVE<br />
BODIES; AND THROUGH MAKING GOVERNMENT STRUCTURES MORE<br />
GENERALLY ACCESSIBLE TO THE ETHNIC COMMUNITIES4<br />
AUSTRALIA HAS CLEARED FROM ITS STATUTE BOOKS, BOTH STATE AND)<br />
FEDERAL, MOST OF THE RELICS OF LEGISLATION WHICH<br />
DISCRIMINATED ON THE BASIS OF RACE. THE RACIAL DISCRIMINATION<br />
ACT IS A CORNERSTONE OF LEGISLATIVE PRACTICE IN THIS AREA. </p>
<p>lb,<br />
BUT WE CANNOT REST UNTIL NOT ONLY THE STATUTES, BUT THE<br />
PERCEPTIONS AND PRACTICES OF THE COMMUNITY ACKNOWLEDGE THE<br />
INHERENT FAIRNESS OF NON-DISCRIMNATIONTHE<br />
GOVERNMENT WILL BE ALLOCATING $ 200,000 OVER THE NEXT 3<br />
YEARS TO COMMISSION PRODUCTION OF A SERIES. OF SHORT MEDIA<br />
SEGMENTS TO PROMOTE RACIAL AND ETHNIC TOLERANCE IK<br />
AUSTRALIA. THIS PROGRAM HAS MY PERSONAL ENDORSEMENT.<br />
CONSIDER THAT COMMUNITY EDUCATION PROGRAMS ARE ONE OF THE<br />
BEST WAYS OF ADVANCING THE GENERAL CAUSE OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND<br />
RACIAL TOLERANCE IN THIS COUNTRY. THE MEDXA HAS A MAJOR<br />
RESPONSIBILITY IN THIS REGARD-INDEED I SHALL BE<br />
CONSIDERING CLOSELY THE REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE OF REVIEW OF<br />
THE SPECIAL BROADCASTING SERVICE WITH THIS POINT IN MINDMY<br />
GOVERNMENT BRINGS AN UNSWERVING AND FUNDAMENTAL<br />
COMMITMENT TO PROVIDE POLICIES AND TO TAKE INITIATIVES WHICH<br />
DEVELOP AUSTRALIA AS A FAIR, HARMONIOUS AND PROGRESSIVE<br />
MULTICULTURAL SOCIETY-WE WANT A SOCIETY IN WHICH ALL<br />
GROUPS HAVE THE SAME RIGHTS, RESPONSIBILITIES AND<br />
OPPORTUNITIES# THE FEDERATION OF ETHNIC COMMUNITIES COUNCILS-AND YOUR<br />
MEMBER ORGANISATIONS IN THE STATES AND TERRITORIES HAVE AN<br />
IMPORTANT ROLE TO PLAY IN HELPING PROMOTE THIS-I HOPE YOU<br />
WILL NEVER LET UP IN YOUR EFFORTS-* em </p>
