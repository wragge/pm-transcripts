    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Parliament has passed important legislation to keep high risk terrorist offenders behind bars.</p>
<p>This legislation will keep Australians safe from convicted terrorists who continue to pose an unacceptable risk to the community at the end of their custodial sentences.</p>
<p>The importance of the new scheme is highlighted by the number of convicted terrorists currently behind bars and the unprecedented number of Australians – 55 people from 24 counter-terrorism operations – charged with terrorism offences since September 2014.</p>
<p>The Government is doing everything it can to prevent terrorism. We have strengthened our ability to detect, disrupt, arrest, prosecute and detain those who would do us harm.</p>
<p>This new law ensures that, where terrorist offenders cannot be rehabilitated, we will have the power to keep the community safe.</p>
<p>The Government thanks the states and territories for their close engagement in this process and for putting public safety first.</p>
<p>The Criminal Code Amendment (High Risk Terrorist Offenders) Bill 2016 was the second piece of national security legislation passed by the Parliament yesterday, and the third in the past fortnight.</p>
<p>The Coalition Government has now secured the passage of eight tranches of national security legislation through the Parliament since 2014. This is the most significant programme of national security legislation reform since September 2001.</p>
<p>The Turnbull Government is getting on with the job, delivering for the Australian people and keeping the community safe.</p>
