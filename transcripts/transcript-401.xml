NO. I TV RECORDING: " TALK TO ' THE NATION"<br />
BY THE PRIME MINISTEli THE RiT. HON. R. G. MENZIES<br />
NOVEMBER. 19o.<br />
Ladies and Gentlemen:<br />
Before this election campaign is finished you will<br />
listen, if you have the patience to many arguments on many<br />
matters; some arguments on grea issues and some arguments, no<br />
doubt, on side issues.<br />
But 1 t:. ought I would like to take a fairly early<br />
opportuni'., 7 of putting this to you. Th~ re is one great issue in<br />
this election and that is the issue of what kind of government<br />
you want. You have had a Government headed by myself now for a<br />
long time you may think rather too long. But that doesn't<br />
matter, WhA-. t has happened in our time of government will, I<br />
think, have a profound influence on what you -think on Polling<br />
Day. Because if the truth is and I think it is that we<br />
have enjoyed in Austra-ia 12 years of remarkable -rowth and<br />
remarkable prosperity, with a remarkably high lc~ vel of<br />
employment, notwithstanding small occasions, if these things<br />
have happened and the nation is stronger, and the people<br />
themselvos are better off, happier, freer, then I would doubt<br />
very much whether you would want to change the goverrnent and<br />
hand it over to whom? Hand it over to a collection of<br />
people -and about those people I want to say this with great<br />
respect -a collection of people wrio haven't been able to live<br />
together, politically, haven't been able to yovern themselves,<br />
politically? And now they are asking you to put us out and to<br />
let themn goverr~ this country for you. That seems to me o be<br />
the very great issue in this election.<br />
Now having said that I just want to mention to you<br />
because I can't mention everything a few matters by which I<br />
invite you to test the position. b<br />
First of all whatever may be said about-us and I<br />
know we have our critics, I read them every day, I hear them<br />
quite frequently, and no doubt there is a lot to be said for<br />
them but whatever may be said by our critics we have been for<br />
the whole of this time, although we have consisted of two<br />
parties, the Liberal Party and the Country Party, we have been<br />
completely united. .1e have never had any discord in my<br />
government; we have had nothing but loyalty, one to the other;<br />
and we have had nothing but loyalty from those who sit behind<br />
us in Parliament. Now that is a tremendously important thing.<br />
You can't really run the business of the country well if the<br />
Board of Directors is engaging in wrangling and disputing.<br />
waec t. e don't wrangle, and dispute. ge argue, we agrez. e,<br />
And in these last 12 years, while it would be silly<br />
for any government to pretend we did everything, the truth is<br />
that a good government a loyally composed government, a<br />
government that co-operates, one member with another, a<br />
government that has ideas and has ambition for the future of<br />
Australia, can produce and, we believe, has produced an<br />
economic climate, a political climate, in which the country can I<br />
go on getting stronger and stronger. That is the great task<br />
of a government: not ? o try to run all the buSiness in the<br />
community, but to make it possible for the community itself,<br />
to grow and to develop. There: fore we have had stability of<br />
government. </p>
<p>You are being asked to change it for what I would<br />
imagine would be the most unstable 8overnment representing the<br />
most unstable Party that Australia has seen for a long time.<br />
Then there is another tiiing that perhaps you might<br />
recall. The public credit of this country is very high. Now<br />
that is not just " high finance" talk. This is not intended to<br />
say something that is a little mysterious and shows how<br />
superior wae are. There is something quite simple about high<br />
public credit if you can establishwitiiand maintain it.<br />
Because it means that people will be willing to invest in<br />
Australia, not only Australians themselves,' who are investing<br />
in this country ma-, nificently, but people outside Australia<br />
people who ' nave, over these recent years been investing hunareds<br />
of millions, and an immense amount of accumulated skill in the<br />
development of industry in Australia. I know that my opponents<br />
say they don't like it. Presumably they will cut it off. IL<br />
will be a s.-d ' lay for Australia if they do, because without the<br />
investment of capital in this country our progress would be<br />
slowed down almost im.-measurably. But there it is: high<br />
public credit establisled and maintained over this last decade.<br />
There is a third thing. I believe that even our<br />
opponents regard us as having a decent sense of fair play. And<br />
fair play the sense of fair play, translated into the<br />
industrial world, means an enormous amount because it brings<br />
about a sense of justice, and therefore continuity of work; in<br />
short, industrial peace.<br />
Do you know that thne days of work lost under my<br />
Government have never been as great as the lowest number lost<br />
under the preceding Labour Government? That's a very<br />
remarkable thing. And all the moro remarkable because some of<br />
you will remenbe:. i being told by our opponents, or by my<br />
opponent, " Oh, of course they will never be able to ret on withi<br />
the Unions, they'll never be able to get on with organised<br />
labour",. But we have thie greatest record of industrial peace<br />
that this country can point to. Now that is a good thing. 1<br />
want it to continue, because it is only when people have the<br />
opportunity of continuity of work and production that<br />
Australia can develop more and more as it has developed over<br />
the last 10 years.<br />
Then, Sir you know I say " Sir" ~ because I'm rather<br />
in the habit of that in the H-ouse, but I'll address you sir, as<br />
" Sir" then Sir, think of what has g-one on in national<br />
development, I will probably have more to say about this<br />
before the campaign finishes, but really when you look north,<br />
South, east and west in Australia at the enormous works of<br />
development that have occurred, employing thousands and scores<br />
of thousands of people, producing water for irrigation,<br />
producing power for factory development, producing ports,<br />
better ports for coal export, producing minerals, producing an<br />
increased outturn of beef for export look I needn't dwell on<br />
all thes~ e things because I hope you will hear a lot about them<br />
before Polling Day. But when I look back over them I want to<br />
tell you that whatever you do with me on Polling Day I shall<br />
always be proud to have had some association with a process<br />
which so far from having finished is only getting going, The<br />
last 12 years will be really small compared to what can be<br />
done in the next 12 if you have stable , overrb-ent, sensible<br />
government, responsible g5overnment; and government that has<br />
some imagination about the future. </p>
<p>4 3.<br />
Then finally, the only other thing that I have time to<br />
mention to you is perhaps this: This country is more secure<br />
than it ever has been before. That is a big thing to say. You<br />
may say to me " Well, no country is secure". That is true<br />
enough. None of us can feel entirely secure with Khrushchev and<br />
the Communists beating the big drum, setting out to frighten us,<br />
and to frighten other people by these crude demonstrations of<br />
power. Nobody can feel utterly secure about these things, It<br />
is a pretty good thing for this country of ours to have this<br />
measure of security that its government has, in all these<br />
years, set about making close, abiding friendships, not only<br />
with Great Britain, not only with the mother country, and the<br />
other British counruries, but also with the United States of<br />
America, wl. h powerful allies in the South-East Asian Treaty<br />
Organisation, with the United States and with New Zealand in<br />
the ANZUS ' Treaty. These are all things that we have taken a<br />
great hand in creating.<br />
Our stocks, our personal stocks abroad are, as I<br />
happen to know, very high. -de hal~ e powerful friends And in a<br />
world in which trie threat and terror of force are to be<br />
observed day by day, the most important thing for a small<br />
country is to have powerful friends who stand by it, and by whom<br />
it stCands. And of course we couldn't stand by our friends, even<br />
in a small way, if it were not for the fact that our defence<br />
preparation at this moment, is at the greatest pitch of<br />
efficiency it has ever reached in time of peace. Even our<br />
critics in Australia have ceased to criticise what has gOne on<br />
in the Army, in the Navy and the Air Force, in research and<br />
development, in the long range guided missile department, in<br />
i'oomera. This has been a remarkable effort. At least I did<br />
think that the Labour Party would say, " Well ve won't touch<br />
that; we'll keep that; we do want to have that measure of<br />
capacity to defend ourselves". But the only statement, so far,<br />
made by the Labour Party, and of course one never knows what<br />
will come along, has been to the effect that the defence vote is<br />
too great, and ought to be reduced.<br />
Now I come back to -,. here I began:. there are all<br />
sorts of side issues, but the central matter in this election,<br />
from the time it began until Polling Day, is " Do you want to<br />
change your present government in favour of the kind of<br />
government that is offered to you by our opponents?"<br />
If we had a poor record of performance I could well<br />
imagine you saying, " Well they've had their chance they haven't<br />
done well, this is the time for experiment, let's try somebody<br />
else".* But nobody really can honestly say that this country<br />
hasn't been prospering, that this country hasn't been going<br />
through a period of wonderful 5, rowth, that ordinary standards of<br />
living haven't been rising, that we haven't enjoyed the<br />
confidence and goodwill of the world, Nobody can honestly tell<br />
you that. Therefore what you are really being invited to do by<br />
our opponents is to take a wild experiment, a sort of excitable<br />
act arising from the very prosperity of the country, " Well<br />
we're pretty well off, let's see what we can do with the people<br />
who now sit on the front Opposition bench at Canberra"<br />
quarrelling with each other, mostly disliking each other, with<br />
hardly an ounce of mautual loyalty.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen, quite frankly, I can't see you<br />
doing it, I profoundly hope you won't even think of doing it. </p>
