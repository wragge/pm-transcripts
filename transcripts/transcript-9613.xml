STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
MR HOWARD'S EMPTY HEADLAND<br />
The Leader of the Opposition's so-called " headland" speech tonight is a<br />
hollow collection of cliches, exposing his complete paucity of policies.<br />
Mr Howard has now been leading the Liberal Party for four months, and the<br />
best he can produce in that time in a prepared text issued tonight is a<br />
collection of lightweight truisms, which he calls " a framework for a future<br />
Coalition Government."<br />
Far from presenting serious, detailed alternative policies, the speech<br />
confirms that Mr Howard has a bad case of policy phobia.<br />
Along the way, he has also confirmed the cynicism of the Opposition's recent<br />
poll-driven misappropriation of the word " battlers".<br />
Mr Howard let the cat out of the bag when he said: . after a week of us<br />
fighting for the interests of the Australian battler". The Labor Party has been<br />
fighting for the rights and living standards of Australian workers for more than<br />
100 years not just the past week.<br />
Those same Australian workers indeed all Australians will also see<br />
through Mr Howard's claim that they " may not want government out of their<br />
lives, but they do want it off their backs." This is Liberal Party code for cutting<br />
Government spending on welfare payments and other programs designed to<br />
increase equity in the Australian community. But you won't find any mention<br />
of spending cuts on this headland.<br />
Nor will Australians be taken in by Mr Howard's smug reference to a " profamily<br />
industrial relations policy". What is pro-family about ripping away<br />
award protection and attacking unions?<br />
Mr Howard has also committed a Coalition Government to the destruction of<br />
the Commonwealth's external affairs power. Among other things, this would </p>
<p>see the Federal Government's role in the protection of the environment<br />
seriously impeded.<br />
Mr Howard says that the use of the external affairs power by this Government<br />
has been " illicit". Illicit means unlawful and forbidden. What an extraordinary<br />
claim for the alternative Prime Minister to make. A claim which yet again<br />
reveals how deep and irrational is his Party's obsession with States' rights.<br />
On Foreign Affairs, Mr Howard offered not a single specific policy towards our<br />
region, apart from saying " the next Coalition Government will continue ( the)<br />
pattern" of stressing the importance of our relations with nations in the Asia-<br />
Pacific region.<br />
On health, Mr Howard has reaffirmed his commitment to Labor's policies.<br />
Suddenly, he is a defender of Medicare and bulk billing. And, what's more, he<br />
has endorsed the Government's long-standing policy aimed at lifting the level<br />
of childhood immunisation. This year's Budget committed $ 24 million over<br />
two years, in part to set up a national register to record how many children<br />
are missing out and why, and to broaden the existing education campaign.<br />
While we welcome his support for our policies, it is dishonest for him to claim<br />
them as his own.<br />
The republic issue is a prime example of the Mr Howard's determination to<br />
follow, rather than lead. The only conclusion we can draw is that Mr Howard<br />
is afraid to state his true position on the republic which is that he is opposed<br />
to a republic, and therefore does not want an Australian to be our head of<br />
state. He also attacks what he terms " a few interest groups" driving the Government<br />
away from the " mainstream". Mr Howard should name the interest groups of<br />
which he speaks; the interest groups which would be deprived of access to a<br />
Coalition Government.<br />
I have news for Mr Howard. The interest groups he so carefully avoids<br />
naming are ordinary, decent Australians.<br />
I did not see Mr Howard deliver his speech tonight, but surely he blushed as<br />
he spoke. This was no headland; this was bluff.<br />
