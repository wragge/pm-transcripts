PRIME MINISTER58/ 95<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
DESTRUCTION OF HONORARY FRENCH CONSULATE, PERTH<br />
I am disturbed and disappointed by the destruction of the premises of the Honorary French<br />
Consulate in Perth in the early hours of this morning.<br />
I understand that police must ascertain the cause of the fire before it can be proved to have<br />
been a wilful act of destruction However, if it is proved that this action is a violent<br />
protest against the resumption of French nuclear testing in the South Pacific, it must be<br />
condemned for the extreme form it has taken.<br />
All Australians have been angered by the French decision-It is the right of every citizen to<br />
voice their disapproval of the French Government's decision, including by peaceful protest.<br />
However, the deliberate destruction of property is not part of the Australian way of life<br />
and must be rejected on every occasion.<br />
As a nation, Australia has made its strong protest to the French Government through<br />
Senator McMullan, as acting Foreign Minister, calling in the French Ambassador on<br />
Wednesday. Further, as the leader of the South Pacific delegation Senator Evans will<br />
meet the French Foreign Minister in Paris on Monday to convey our condemnation of<br />
their decision to resume nuclear tests.<br />
