ONE<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, MR E, G. WHITLAM, M, P.<br />
TO THE FEDERATED MUNICIPAL AND SHIRE COUNCIL EMPLOYEES'UNION<br />
26 MAY 1975<br />
No GROUP OF AUSTRALIAN EMPLOYEES HAVE HAD GREATER<br />
RESPONSIBILITIES IMPOSED UPON THEM THROUGH-THE POLICIES<br />
OF MY GOVERNMENT THAN EMPLOYEES IN LOCAL GOVERNMENT. EQUALLY,<br />
NO GROUP OF AUSTRALIAN EMPLOYEES HAVE HAD THEIR OPPORTUNITIES<br />
MORE ENHANCED THAN THOSE EMPLOYED BY LOCAL GOVERNMENT$<br />
IN ACCEPTING YOUR INVITATION I ACKNOWLEDGE THIS, ACKNOWLEDGE<br />
OUR DEBT AND AFFIRM OUR MUTUAL OPPORTUNITIES. THE POLICIES<br />
OF THIS GOVERNMENT CANNOT SUCCEED WITHOUT YOUR CO-OPERATION,<br />
IN A VERY REAL SENSE, LOCAL GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES<br />
ARE THE FRONT-LINE TROOPS IN OUR BATTLE TO PROMOTE THE<br />
QUALITY OF LIFE IN AUSTRALIA'S CITIES AND REGIONS, AND TO<br />
PROMOTE EQUALITY BETWEEN REGIONS. FRONT-LINE TROOPS MUST,<br />
OF COURSE, EXPECT TO COP A GREAT DEAL OF THE FLAK, WE CAN<br />
* ALL ANTICIPATE IN THE COMING MONTHS A STRENGTHENING OF THE<br />
ATTACK ON THE GROWTH OF THE PUBLIC SECTOR, ON THE SO-CALLED<br />
BLOATED BUREAUCRACY. " THESE ATTACKS ALWAYS HAVE ONE AIM<br />
TO DIVIDE THE COMMUNITY, TO BUILD'UP RESENTMENT AGAINST<br />
PUBLIC INITIATIVES,_ TO DEPICT-THE WORKFORCE AS BEING COMPOSED<br />
OF TWO MUTUALLY HOSTILE SECTORS THE WORKERS VERSUS THE<br />
DRONES. FOR THE PURPOSE OF THAT PARTICULAR EXERCISE,<br />
THOSE PAID BY GOVERNMENT FEDERAL, STATE OR LOCAL ARE<br />
DEPICTED AS THE DRONES. THIS COMPARTMENTALISATION IS<br />
ESSENTIALLY PHONEY. IT IS IMPOSSIBLE, IN TERMS OF PRODUCTIVITY<br />
OR SOCIAL WORTH, TO DRAW A DISTINCTION BETWEEN EMPLOYEES IN<br />
THE PUBLIC SECTOR AND THOSE IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR. </p>
<p>-1A7<br />
ACCORDING TO THE FALLACY OF PRIVATE WORTH VERSUS PUBLIC<br />
WASTE, THE CLERK IN ONE OF THE 110 PRIVATE HEALTH FUNDS<br />
IS ECONOMICALLY PRODUCTIVE WHILE THE CLERK DOING EXACTLY<br />
THE SAME WORK THROUGH MEDIBANK IS A BLUDGER. THE PRIVATE<br />
BUS OPERATOR PRODUCESJ THE PUBLIC TRANSPORT WORKER IS<br />
A PARASITE. THE BREWERY WORKER CONTRIBUTES TO THE<br />
GROSS NATIONAL PRODUCT; THE WATER BOARD MAN DOES NOT.<br />
THE SHIRE ENGINEER IS IN SOME WAY A LESS USEFULj,, LESS<br />
PRODUCTIVE CITIZEN THAN A PRIVATELY-EMPLOYED ONE,<br />
OF COURSE THIS ' IS ALL SO MUCH NONSENSE. </p>
<p>-2-<br />
ECONOMICALLY AND SOCIALLY, THE PRIVATE SECTOR AND<br />
THE PUBLIC SECTOR ARE INTERDEPENDENT. No MODERN COMMUNITY<br />
CAN SENSIBLY OR MEANINGFULLY DRAW A SHARP DISTINCTION<br />
BETWEEN THE PRIVATE OR PUBLIC PROVISION OF GOODS AND<br />
SERVICES, WHOEVER PRODUCES OR PROVIDES THEM. IN MODERN<br />
COMMUNITIES, THE PROVISION OF SERVICES, EVEN MORE THAN<br />
THE PRODUCTION OF GOODS, DETERMINES THE REAL LEVEL OF<br />
A COMMUNITY S WELFARE AND A FAMILY S STANDARD OF LIVING.<br />
AND INCREASINGLY THOSE SERVICES MUST BE* PROVIDED BY THE<br />
COMMUNITY ITSELF, OR THEY WILL NOT BE PROVIDED AT ALL,<br />
WHO WOULD NOW ARGUE THAT THE PRODUCTION OF PRIVATE CARS<br />
WAS A MORE ACCURATE OR MORE RELEVANT MEASURE OF<br />
PROSPERITY THAN THE QUALITY OF PUBLIC TRANSPORT? WHO<br />
WOULD NOW ARGUE THAT A SUBURBAN HOME STOCKED WITH<br />
EVERY GLITTERING MODERN APPLIANCE WAS SATISFACTORY IF'IT<br />
LACKED THE BASIC AMENITY OF SEWERAGE?<br />
I SET OUT THE BASIS OF AN APPROACH IN THE<br />
POLICY SPEECH OF 1972 IN THESE TERMS:<br />
" EVEN-THE MOST ENLIGHTENED AND EQUAL APPROACH<br />
TO SOCIAL WELFARE CAN ONLY SCRATCH THE SURFACE OF THE<br />
BASIC PROBLEM OF EQUALITY AND WELL-BEING OF MOST OF OUR CITIZENS$<br />
WE CAN DOUBLE AND TREBLE SOCIAL BENEFITS, BUT WE CAN NEVER<br />
MAKE UP THROUGH CASH PAYMENTS FOR WHAT WE TAKE AWAY IN<br />
MENTAL AND PHYSICAL WELL-BEING AND SOCIAL COHESION THROUGH<br />
THE BREAKDOWN OF COMMUNITY LIFE AND COMMUNITY IDENTITY. 1-1/ 3. </p>
<p>-3-<br />
INCREASINGLY, A CITIZEN'S REAL STANDARD OF LIVING, THE<br />
HEALTH OF HIMSELF AND HIS FAMILY, -HIS CHILDREN'S<br />
OPPORTUNITIES FOR EDUCATION AND SELF-IMPROVEMENT, HIS<br />
ACCESS TO EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES, HIS ABILITY TO<br />
ENJOY THE NATION'S RESOURCES FOR RECREATION AND CULTURE,<br />
HIS ABILITY TO PARTICIPATE IN THE DECISIONS AND ACTIONS<br />
OF THE COMMUNITY ARE DETERMINED NOT BY HIS INCOME, NOT<br />
BY THE HOURS HE WORKS, BUT BY WHERE HE LIVES. THIS<br />
IS WHY . LABOR BELIEVES THAT THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT MUST<br />
INVOLVE ITSELF DIRECTLY IN CITIES AND CENTRES WHERE<br />
MOST PEOPLE LIVE,"<br />
THE MAJOR INSTRUMENT FOR THE PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATION<br />
OF THAT PHILOSOPHY IS LOCAL GOVERNMENT. WHAT IS NOW<br />
UNDERWAY IS A TRANSFORMATION OF THE ROLE OF LOCAL<br />
GOVERNMENT AND CONSEQUENTLY A TRANSFORMATION OF THE ROLE<br />
OF LOCAL* GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES. OON'T FORGET AND DON'T<br />
O LET THE PUBLIC FORGET THAT WHEN BUSINESS, AND THE PRESS<br />
ATTACK THE BUREAUCRACY, THEY ARE NOT JUST AIMING AT THE<br />
CANBERRA PUBLIC SERVANTS; THEY'RE AIMING AT YOU AND YOUR<br />
FELLOW-MEMBERS AS WELL. IN FACT IN 1974-75 THE FASTESTGROWING<br />
SEGMENT OF THE PUBLIC WORK-FORCE WAS NOT THE<br />
FEDERAL PUBLIC SERVICE BUT EMPLOYMENT THROUGH LOCAL<br />
GOVERNMENT. THE GROWTH OF THE FEDERAL PUBLIC SERVICE<br />
WAS THE LOWEST OF THE THREE FEbERAL, STATE AND LOCAL. </p>
<p>-4-<br />
FEDERAL EMPLOYMENT FROM MARCH 1974 TO MARCH 1975<br />
INCREASED 4.8 PER CENT, STATE GOVERNMENT EMPLOYMENT<br />
BY 6,4 PER CENT AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT EMPLOYMENT BY<br />
11,4 PER CENT, I SHOULD POINT OUT THAT THE LOCAL<br />
GOVERNMENT FIGURE SIGNIFICANTLY REFLECTS THE OPERATION<br />
OF THE REGIONAL EMPLOYMENT DEVELOPMENT SCHEME, THE<br />
FIGURES DO, HOWEVER, EXPLODE THE MYTH OF UNCONTROLLED<br />
GROWTH OF THE FEDERAL PUBLIC SERVICE,<br />
I SHOULD FURTHER POINT OUT THAT ONE OF THE<br />
MAJOR FACTORS DETERMINING THE RATE OF GROWTH OF<br />
THE FEDERAL PUBLIC SERVICE IS THE NEED TO RECRUIT<br />
STAFF TO PLAN AND OPERATE PROGRAMS DIRECTLY RELATED<br />
TO LOCAL GOVERNMENT ACTIVITIES, THIS GOES MUCH<br />
FURTHER THAN THE CREATION OF THE DEPARTMENT OF<br />
URBAN AND REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND THE CITIES<br />
COMMISSION AND THE NEW INVOLVEMENT OF THE GRANTS<br />
COMMISSION IN REGIONAL AFFAIRS, A GREAT NUMBER OF<br />
FEDERAL DEPARTMENTS ARE NOW WORKING DIRECTLY WITH<br />
STATE AND LOCAL GOVENMENT TO DEVELOP A WHOLE. RANGE<br />
OF NEW LOCAL PROGRAMS; INCLUDING SOCIAL SECURITY,<br />
HEALTH, EDUCATION, LABOR AND IMMIGRATION, ABORIGINAL<br />
AFFAIRS, TOURISM AND RECREATION, TRANSPORT, AND<br />
HOUSING AND CONSTRUCTION, </p>
<p>THIS EXPANSION OF ACTIVITIES HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH<br />
CENTRALISM. IT DOES MEAN VASTLY EXPANDED. OPPORTUNITIES<br />
FOR CO-OPERATION BETWEEN THE THREE LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT<br />
AND A VASTLY ENHANCED ROLE FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT. WE<br />
HAVE SOUGHT TO MAKE LOCAL GOVERNMENT A GENUINE PARTNER<br />
IN AUSTRALIA'S FEDERAL SYSTEM,<br />
WHEN As LEADER OF THE AUSTRALIAN LABOR PARTY<br />
IBEGAN TO BR ING LOCAL QUESTIONS TO THE CENTRE OF THE<br />
NATIONAL DEBATE I WAS SAID TO BE DEMEANING BOTH THE<br />
DEBATE AND MY SELF, REMEMBER THE SYDNEY MORNING HERALD<br />
THOUGHT IT HILARIOUS THAT A NATIONAL LEADER SHOULD<br />
SUGGEST, FOR I NSTANRE, THAT SEWERAGE WAS A-NATIONAL<br />
QUESTION. MY APPROACH WAS AND IS THAT THE NATIONAL<br />
GOVERNMENT MUST ACCEPT A GREATER INVOLVEMENT IN A WHOLE<br />
RANGE OF MATTERS WHICH WERE ONCE DEEMED TO BE THE SOLE<br />
RESPONSIBILITY OF THE STATE OR OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT.<br />
THAT IS-NOT BECAUSE OF ANY BELIEF IN THE INHERENT<br />
SUPERIORITY OF CANBERRA. IT IS SIMPLY THAT UNDER THE OLD<br />
APPROACHj. THE SERVICES WHICH A MODERN COMMUNITY NOW<br />
REQUIRES SHOULD BE PROVIDED THROUGH ITS ELECTED<br />
REPRESENTATIVES WERE EITHER PROVIDED INADEQUATELY<br />
OR NOT AT ALL, WERE FINANCED INADEQUATELY AND UNFAIRLY,<br />
OR NOT AT ALL, IT IS NOW INEVITABLE THAT THE NATIONAL<br />
GOVERNMENT SHALL ACCEPT INCREASING RESPONSIBILITY TO<br />
FINANCE THESE FUNCTIONS AND SERVICES FAIRLY AND ADEQUATELY.<br />
WHAT THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT HAS TRIED TO DO IS TO CREATE<br />
THE INSTITUTIONS AND MACHINERY, AND TO APPOINT THE MEN AND<br />
WOMEN WHEREBY THIS INEVITABLE GROWTH OF RESPONSIBILITY<br />
CAN BE DISCHARGED EFFICIENTLY AND FAIRLY. </p>
<p>-6-<br />
THE GREAT OBJECTIVE HAS BEEN TO EXPAND OPPORTUNITIES AND<br />
EQUALISE OPPORTUNITIES BETWEEN REGIONS, THE MAJOR<br />
INSTRUMENT IN THIS TASK IS THE GRANTS COMMISSION. THIS<br />
YEAR $ 56 MILLION HAS BEEN MADE AVAILABLE TO 806 LOCAL<br />
GOVERNMENT AUTHORITIES UNDER RECOMMENDATION MADE BY THE<br />
COMMISSION, I MENTIONBRIEFLY SOME OTHER NEW PROGRAMS WHICH<br />
DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY PROVIDE NEW OPPORTUNITIES FOR<br />
YOUR MEMBERS. LAST YEAR WE PROVIDED $ 28 MILLION UNDER OUR<br />
NATIONAL SEWERAGE PROGRAM. THIS YEAR THE ESTIMATE IS<br />
$ 108 MILLION AND THE PROGRAM. HAS BEEN EXTENDED TO TOWNS<br />
WITH A POPULATION OF MORE THAN 10,000,<br />
FOR THE. FIRST TIME WE HAVE MADE URBAN LOCAL<br />
ROADS ELIGIBLE FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE FROM THE<br />
AUSTRALIAN. GOVERNMENT,<br />
THIRTEEN'AREA IMPROVEMENT PROGRAMS COSTING $ 14 MILLION<br />
ARE NOW OPERATING.<br />
THE DEPARTMENT OF TOURISM AND RECREATION AND<br />
OTHER AUSTRALIAN DEPARTMENTS SUCH AS DEPARTMENT OFURBAN<br />
AND REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT ARE CONSULTING AT LOCAL LEVEL ON<br />
THE RECREATIONAL NEEDS OF THE PEOPLE. </p>
<p>-7<br />
OUR GRANTS PROGRAM HAS MADE A START TOWARDS MEETING THOSE<br />
NEEDS. WE HAVE THIS YEAR ALLOCATED $ 2.25 MILLION FOR<br />
GRANTS FOR LOCAL TOURIST ATTRACTIONS AND FACILITIES. WE<br />
ARE ESTABLISHING ADVISORY COMMITTEES FOR CONSULTATION WITH<br />
LOCAL GOVERNMENTo REGIONAL TOURIST ORGANISATIONS AND<br />
INDUSTRY REPRESENTATIVES TO PLAN REGIONAL TOURIST DEVLEOPMENT1<br />
WE HAVE EXPANDED THE PROGRAM OF LOCAL OWNERSHIP OF<br />
AERODROMESS LOCAL GOVERNMENT HAS PARTICIPATED IN THE INTERIM<br />
PROGRAM FOR PRE-SCHOOL AND CHILD-CARE SERVICES. ABOUT<br />
HALF OF THE 122 CAPITAL PROJECTS UNDERTAKEN THROUGH OUR<br />
CHILD-CARE PROGRAM WERE SPONSORED BY LOCAL.. GOVERNMENT BODIES.<br />
WE HAVE MADE AVAILABLE MORE THAN $ 3k MILLION<br />
IN DIRECT GRANTS TO LOCAL GOVERNMENT AUTHOR ITIES FQLR<br />
ABORIGINAL ADVANCEMENT IN THE PAST YEAR. MOST OF THAT<br />
WAS ALLOCATED UNDER THE SPECIAL WORK PROJECTS SCHEME<br />
ADMINISTERED BY LOCAL GOVERNMENT AUTHORITIES.<br />
WE HA VE COOPERATED CLOSELY WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENT<br />
THROUGH THE CREATION OF THE REGIONAL COUNCILS FOR SOCIAL<br />
DEVELOPMENT IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE AUSTRALIAN<br />
ASSISTANCE PLAN. II I </p>
<p>-8-<br />
THE LEGISLATION FOR THE HOSPITALS AND HEALTH<br />
SERVICES COMMISSION PROVIDES FOR THE COMMISSION TO<br />
MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS ON FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO BE MADE<br />
AVAILABLE BY THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT TO LOCAL<br />
GOVERNMENTS AFTER CONSULTATIONS WITH THE STATES., THE<br />
COMMUNITY HEALTH PROGRAM AND THE COMMUNITY MENTAL HEALTHI<br />
ALCOHOLISM AND DRUG DEPENDENCY PROGRAM, BOTH INTRODUCED<br />
IN 1973, PROVIDE FOR DIRECT GRANTS TO* LOCAL GOVERNMENT<br />
ORGANISATIONS, LOCAL GOVERNMENT NOW HAS AN OPPORTUNITY<br />
TO PARTICIPATE DIRECTLY IN THE PROVISION OF A WIDE RANGE<br />
OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES AND FACILITIES AT THE COMMUNITY<br />
LEVELI WHERE IT9 PARTICIPATION CAN BE MOST EFFECTIVE, </p>
<p>p THROUGH ALL THESE AND OTHER PROGRAMS, WE ARE<br />
STRIVING TO EXPAND AND EQUALISE OPPORTUNITIES FOR ALL<br />
REGIONS AND AS BETWEEN REGIONS. IT IS NOT ONLY A MATTER<br />
OF IMPROVING THE QUALITY OF LIFE FOR ALL CITIZENS, FOR<br />
ALL PEOPLE LIVING IN AUSTRALIA, WHEREVER THEY LIVE IN<br />
AUSTRALIA THOUGH THAT IS THE BASIC AIM. THESE PROGRAMS<br />
WILL INEVITABLY PROMOTE THE OPPORTUNITIES OF YOUR<br />
MEMBERS, NOT JUST FOR EMPLOYMENT, BUT FOR MORE REWARDING,<br />
MORE SELF-SATISFYING EMPLOYMENT. WHEN LOCAL GOVERNMENT<br />
WAS TREATED AS THE CINDERELLA OF GOVERNMENT, WHEN<br />
LOCAL GOVERNMENT WAS POORLY FINANCED AND LOWLY REGARDED,<br />
ALL THOSE ASSOCIATED WITH IT, AND EMPLOYED THROUGH IT,<br />
PAID A PRICE IN SALARY AND WAGES AND IN PUBLIC<br />
ESTEEM. THIS IS NOT ENDED YET: THERE IS STILL A<br />
LONG WAY TO GO. MUT UNTIL LOCAL GOVERNMENT IS A<br />
GENUINE, A FULL AND COMPLETE PARTNER IN THE FEDERAL<br />
SYSTEM,. THOSE EMPLOYED AT THAT LEVEL WILL SUFFER..<br />
THE FACT IS THAT STATE AND LOCAL AUTHORITIES HAVE<br />
BEEN LOUSY EMPLOYERS. THIS IS THE PRINCIPAL REASON WHY<br />
MOST STRIKES THE MOST FREQUENT STRIKES, THE WORST<br />
STRIKES, THE LONGEST STRIKES OCCUR IN THE GREAT SERVICE<br />
INSTRUMENTALITIES AND AMONG EMPLOYEES UNDER THE GREAT<br />
PUBLIC AUTHORITIES, STATE OR LOCAL. IN RAISING THE<br />
LEVEL AND PRESTIGE OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND SEMI-GOVERNMENT<br />
AUTHORITIES, THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT HOPES, NOT ONLY<br />
TO PROMOTE THE QUALITY OF AUSTRALIAN LIFE, BUT TO MAKE IT<br />
POSSIBLE FOR THOSE PUBLIC AUTHORITIES TO GIVE THEIR OWN<br />
EMPLOYEES AS GOOD CONDITIONS, AS GOOD REMUNERATION, AS<br />
GOOD OPPORTUNITIES, AND AS GOOD A CHANCE FOR A DECENT,<br />
FULFILLING OCCUPATIONAS ANYJEPLOYEES IN AUSTRALIA. </p>
