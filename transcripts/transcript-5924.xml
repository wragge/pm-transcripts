AS DELIVEREDI<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA MONDAY, 27 SEPTEM4BER 1982<br />
ADDRESS TO THE CHAMBER OF MANUFACTURES, SYDNEY<br />
I would like to thank you very much for asking me-to share<br />
this evening with you. It is an important one. Manufacturing<br />
industry is vastly important to the state of New South Wales<br />
and to Australia. It provides a large part of our national<br />
income and employs a very large number of people and it is going<br />
through a fairly rugged time. I am well aware of that, but<br />
I do not know how many of you here would like to swap with me the<br />
last two weeks that you have had for the last two weeks I have<br />
had. There are two good things that have happened in the last<br />
couple of weeks, Carlton won and they were the underdogs and<br />
they came through bec ause they had more skill and they knew<br />
what they were about and I knew they were going to win. Then<br />
I went out and had lunch with John Utz and John Reid yesterday<br />
and Parrammatta won. I am not allowed to be so partisan in<br />
Sydney about league but I thought Parrammatta did quite well.<br />
Quite obviously you are affected very much by a number of<br />
circumstances which make life difficult, the economic downturn<br />
overseas and that effects output, it effects orders, it effects<br />
your capacity to employ. You have also been very much effected<br />
by the wage explosion of the last 18 months and the arguments<br />
about shorter hours and this of course has been compounded in<br />
its impact because it was coming at the very time when people<br />
overseas were starting to realise that they had to work harder<br />
and some were recognising that they had to work harder to<br />
significantly less.<br />
When the Government was forming this last Budget we were therefore<br />
doing it in a climate which was quite different to previous<br />
years. In earlier times we were doing it against the expectation<br />
and reality that private business investment was going to<br />
expand and the Government needed to draw back quite hard to<br />
make room for that private investment, but even though private<br />
investment on Treasury predictions is estimated to stay high<br />
through the course of this year, by the end of the year it<br />
will of course be running at a lower rate than at the beginning<br />
and it is unlikely that new and significant business decisions,<br />
investments are going to be made in the curr~ ent climate.<br />
Against that background the Government's Budget was obviously<br />
to an extent a compromise. It would have be en possible to<br />
have a hair shirt budget which would have done more for<br />
inflation, it would have done even more perhaps for interest<br />
rates, but I suspect not much, because I think the overseas / 2 </p>
<p>CHAMBER OF MANUF.-2<br />
influences in relation to that are substantial, but it would<br />
not have done anything at all to help people who were in<br />
difficulties or families who might be in difficulties as a<br />
result of the present circumstances and it would not have<br />
done anything at all to help industry and to help to mitigate<br />
some of the impact of the overseas downturn.<br />
Instead of having a hair shirt Budget which might have been<br />
on the advice ' of some purist economists and on the advice of<br />
Syntac, but I don't know how many of you buy Syntac, because<br />
I know cheaper ways of getting exactly the same advice and I<br />
suspect a number of you do too. We did not do that; we had<br />
an overall domestic budget surplus of about $ 200 million and<br />
an overall deficit of about 1.6 billion, about 1% of gross<br />
domestic product, still one of the lowest deficits in the<br />
western world. I think that makes it an economically responsible<br />
budget. but within that we have been able to encompass tax<br />
cuts, especially tax cuts which are designed to help families,<br />
families with children, family allowances, people buying off<br />
their homes. As a consequence a family with one income<br />
earner of say about $ 300 a week with a wife and two children<br />
is $ 17 to $ 18 a week better off as a result of that Budget.<br />
I believe that that makes it reasonable to argue for and expect<br />
wage restraint because if you had to get the same amount from<br />
an employer, what is it $ 25 or $ 30 a week and that could make<br />
the difference between profit and loss, survival or not<br />
through the course of this coming year. In framing the Budget<br />
we very much had in mind something that would make it reasonable<br />
not only to argue for but to expect wage restraint.<br />
In addition we wanted to provide what support we could to industry<br />
and you know there were all those terrible IAC inquiries through<br />
last year, all sorts of nerve's were touched on the raw because<br />
I suppose everyone knew what the IAC was going to recommend<br />
but nobody necessarily knew what the Government was going to<br />
decide as a consequence. The IAC in part seems to be coming<br />
a body to which you have to refer something to make it legally<br />
possible for a Government to make a decision which is notnecessarily<br />
related all that closely to the IAC recommendations.<br />
I suppose that is the only part that the newspapers tomorrow,,<br />
which are entirely free trade in their consequences and attitudes<br />
and which do not have any competition from overseas at all<br />
because of the nature of the work they do, will say that<br />
I have mercilessly and unreasonably attacked the Industries<br />
Assistance Commission. Somebody said here, here I should have,<br />
but it was not meant in that sense, it was a friendly sort of<br />
comment just relating the facts.<br />
We did want to do things that would help industry and as a<br />
result of the IAC reports over the year we made a certain<br />
decision as you know, not to reduce protection in current<br />
circumstances. We also made decisions about'depreciation which<br />
from what I have been told should over time be of substantial<br />
2 </p>
<p>CHAMBER OF MANUF.-3<br />
support and assistance to industry in enabling them to write<br />
off capital equipment much more rapidly arid therefore make<br />
sure that Australian industry is as technologically advanced<br />
as any in the world and depreciation allowances are being<br />
provided for buildings for the first time. In addition to that<br />
of course there is a substantial increase in the Government's<br />
own expenditure for capital works and that again was very<br />
much related to the particular circumstances of this year.<br />
For small companies an. increase in the rentention allowance,<br />
fulfilling an election policy pledge from the last election..<br />
Tax relief on the first thousand dollars of dividend income<br />
may be small in its consequences, but important for small<br />
investors and important as a statement of philosophy, as<br />
a statement of attitude. I hope it can be regarded as a<br />
significant and useful start and also changes that would<br />
encourage employees to invest in shares of a corporation<br />
for which they work, again something that might be small in<br />
its cost but important from a philosphical point of view and<br />
from the breadth of support which might be available to the<br />
private enterprise system.<br />
I think there have been some positive results from the Budget<br />
starting with the Remuneration Tribunal which in case you<br />
do not know effects politicians, and public servants and judges,<br />
Commonwealth judges not state judges because state judges do<br />
much better than ours I think or so I am told by Commonwealth<br />
judges. They have arguments between themselves too about some<br />
basic matters but the Remuneration Tribunal came in with<br />
a recommnendation for the Acadamic Salaries Tribunal-immediately<br />
followed with the South Australian, West Australian, and<br />
Northern Territory public services the Commonwealth public<br />
service 6 to The Australian editorials might say this is<br />
all 6 to 6 or 7% too much, but it is very, very much better<br />
indeed than 13% or 14% which would have been disastrous for<br />
Australian industry and for Australian employment.<br />
I believe the members of the Parliamentary Remuneration Tribunal<br />
who responded to arguments which said don't ask yourselves<br />
what you think politicians are worth, you might all say that,<br />
is absolutely nothing, but ask yourselves in this instance<br />
what Australia can afford not just for politicians, or ministers<br />
or Prime Ministers or judges and public servants, but imagine<br />
the percentage that you are going to . put. flows right across the<br />
board. That was the first tribunal which r-ame down with a<br />
decision which was but delayed three mor-ths so that made<br />
it a little les s than that, but without that I do niot bp. lieve<br />
that the other t-ibunals would come down with the same decisions<br />
and so I hope the members of the Remuneration Tribunal can<br />
take some pleasure From the fact that they have set by their<br />
recommendations a national lead which I believe is vastly important<br />
for all of us in the period ahead, becau-e wage restraint is<br />
going to be absolutely vital in re-establishing in an appropriate<br />
way, the competitive base of Australian induistry and then in<br />
making it possible for Australian industry to employ more people<br />
a. q of course it must if unemployment levels are to fall. / 4<br />
3 </p>
<p>CHAMBER OF MAJNUF.--<br />
Other things have happened which again I hope providing some<br />
assistance. The exchange rate is down about 15% against<br />
the United States dollar since the end of 1981 and by 11-12%<br />
against the trade weighted index over the last year. That<br />
obviously is important . again in the competitive base from<br />
which Australian industry must get out and compete.<br />
There are some other positive signs. There have been falling<br />
interest rates in the United States. There is now over the last<br />
week or so, asia result of a thoroughly successful tender<br />
for Commonwealth paper some falls in interest rates in Australia.<br />
Bob White has not given me any particular indications as to what<br />
is going to happen in the future, but I am certainly not going<br />
to give my political opponents any mileage to fly with by<br />
making some predictions about the future. I did that once<br />
and even though the predictions came true, they keep on saying<br />
it did not. That just leads to a very unnecessary argument,.<br />
but at least the omens in that front are a little bit better than<br />
they might have been some time ago.<br />
I would like to point out in particular to those purist economiqts<br />
who wanted u-s to wear a hair shirt during this Budget and who<br />
as a consequence of the Budget said that is going to be bad<br />
for interest rates and bad for this and bad for everything else,<br />
in spite of in their view the Budget being bad for these<br />
things, the Commonwealth bond rate is down about 2% since the<br />
6th of Auqust.. So, maybe it is just as well we did not accept<br />
that hair shirted advice.<br />
Industrial relations or the figures of strikes, the June figures<br />
have been the best for 13 or 14 years and that at least must<br />
be pleasing from one point of view, but I think it is a very<br />
sad thing indeed that we seem to need, not need, because<br />
nobody wants it and everyone would seek to avoid it, but it<br />
seems to be only in circumstances of significant unemployment<br />
that that kind of situation can be achieved. That is somethi-ng<br />
that establishes a challenge for all of you here and for<br />
Barry Unsworth and his colleagues because we ought to be able<br />
by management and labour getting together much better than we<br />
ever have to establish the circumstance in which it is possible<br />
to have a good industrial relations record even with much<br />
better levels of employment.<br />
At least we seem to be starting to learn the lesson much quir. ker<br />
than it was learnt in Britain. Thp~ ir unemployment rate is now<br />
about 14% and it was well over 10% approaching 12% before they<br />
had to learn that continual strikes and difficulties are just<br />
going to harm people and cause a great deal of divisivness<br />
and difficulty.<br />
On a mild note, because I Am told this is a non-political<br />
occasion I would like to make the point that Mr Cain's Budget<br />
in Victoria was a curious one becauqe it follows almost exactly<br />
Mr Whitlam's first Budget. I suppose that makes all Victorians<br />
very happy just at the moment. Taxes were up 23 point something<br />
per cent, expenditure was up 24% and I do not know if Victorians<br />
4 </p>
<p>CHAMBER OF MANUF.<br />
are going to be enthralled to learn that if Mr Cain'follows<br />
Mr Whitlam's Budget, in his second Budget he will be spending<br />
24% more. That seems rather lot in slightly difficult<br />
circumstances. It is worth noting that that kind of increase,<br />
in expenditure comes out not far apart from the kind of<br />
budget that Mr Hayden said he would introduce in response<br />
to John Howard's Budget speech. He never put figures on it,<br />
but it was analysed very closely and the analysis is available<br />
for anyone to see and read if they want it, but it comes out an<br />
an overall deficit of something between $ 4.7 and 5.7 billion,<br />
a figure on which Bob Hawke and Bill Hayden seem to be<br />
unanimous because Mr Hawke on the Sunday after the Budget said<br />
that all the countries overseas have budget deficits of 4%<br />
of gross domestic product that is obviously therefore responsible<br />
and riqht and that comes out at something like 6 billion<br />
which is at the upper reaches of what Mr Hayden apparantly had<br />
in mind. * I think it is worth keeping that in mind. The political<br />
Opposition I don't believe have learnt very much from the<br />
lessons of the past, that you cannot spend your way as a<br />
government out of economic problems and difficulties.<br />
There is one other thing that I would like to speak about<br />
and. I believe that the great bulk of the business and commercial<br />
world needs to get its act together to make sure that the broader,<br />
the total Australian public understand that the great bulk of<br />
the business and commercial world behave not only legally<br />
but with a sense of ethics, with a sense of understanding<br />
of the needs and of their responsibilities of the broader<br />
Australian public. I know that that is what most of the business<br />
and commercial world does, but everyone out in the street kno~ w<br />
that that is what most of the business and commercial world<br />
does because there have been some actions in recent times which<br />
have done a. great deal to the fabric of Austra * lian society.<br />
which have led many average Australians to believe that the<br />
system is unfair and stacked against them and they get a bit<br />
annoyed about it as a result and I they are justified at some<br />
of the things-that go on and I am sure that many of you are also.<br />
John Howard has done more to overcome tax evasion than any other<br />
Treasurer in the whole history of the Commonwealth and that<br />
I think ought to be recognised. There has been legislation<br />
against over fifty schemes and a new Part 4A of the general<br />
anti-evasion, anti-avoidance legislation that was introduced<br />
18 months or so ago, but still the fight goes on. Over the<br />
last few weeks, largely as a result I suppose of the publication<br />
of the McCabe-Lafranchie Report and largely as a result of the<br />
publication of the Costigan Report, these matters seem to have<br />
come much more to public notice. Incidentally with all the<br />
wisdom of hindsight' it is not very difficult to see how the<br />
Painters and Dockers became embroiled in tax evasion because<br />
if there were promoters who wanted somebody with no name ' and<br />
no position or who could be given a new name and a new position<br />
a different identity and if they wanted somebody who belonged<br />
to a closed secret society which in the words: of the<br />
Royal Commisioner is not a union, but a criminal society, then<br />
6 </p>
<p>CHAMBER OF MANUF.-6<br />
and one that can enforce its own laws there have been 22 murders<br />
associated with the union and only 2 prosecutions and that is<br />
not a bad record for Australia then of course you go to the<br />
Painters and Dockers and it is not surprising that some<br />
promoters of certain schemes also had people who were going<br />
to recruit Painters and Dockers who would end up signing bits<br />
of paper which I suppose would end up at the bottom of one or<br />
other of the harbours-around Australia. That is as I understand<br />
it how the term bottom of the harbour came to be formed.<br />
We have stopped the worst of the schemes through the Crimes<br />
Taxation Of fences. Act of 1980 which because it could not<br />
be stopped in any other way put in criminal penalties against<br />
the device and all the evidence before the Tax Commissioner<br />
is that the particular piece of legislation has been remarkably<br />
successful. That has left the problem which has become very<br />
evident, what happens about the tax that was not paid and so<br />
John Howard introduced legislation last week which is designed<br />
to recoup the tax that had not been paid, but ought to be paid<br />
from those who benefited from the device. It is not criminal<br />
legislation, there are no criminal penalties attached to it.<br />
It'is taxation legislation and it will result in taxation<br />
assessments being issued.<br />
I do not know how widely the so called bottom of the harbour<br />
scheme is understood, but in my understanding it is one in which<br />
a company with significant current year profit is sold at a<br />
price that makes it perfectly plain that neither the seller nor<br />
the purchaser has any intention of paying any tax. In other<br />
words -the vendor-shareholder gets a price for his shares which<br />
is much greater tha.-he could get if he was going to pay tax<br />
or if the purchaser was going to pay tax. I am told there<br />
are a cirucmstances in which the vendor-shareholder did not<br />
know that the purchaser was going to pay tax and that therefore<br />
he did not know that the tax was not going to be paid. I might<br />
at times find it difficult that he did not know because<br />
the test, and this is part of the test of the legislation, is<br />
that on the basis on the price he gets for the shares, which<br />
is of course a capital price, there is not enough money left<br />
in the company to pay the tax. If you add the fee of the<br />
promoter together with the price of the vendor-shareholders,<br />
there was generally nothing left and so how was the tax going to be<br />
paid. -obviously in many cases it was not.<br />
It is not surprising that a good many people get annoyed about<br />
this and expect that something should be done about it. There<br />
is an argument about retrospectivity and nobody likes retrospective<br />
legislation, but I would like to make a point. about that because<br />
some considerable time ago a-conservative government in the United<br />
Kingdom in somewhat similar circumstances the same kind of<br />
legislation was introduced. It is worth noting I think that<br />
when the particular legislation was on appeal in the court of<br />
appeal in the United Kingdom, the senior judge of that court<br />
made one or two significant comments and he said<br />
" For y ears a battle of manoeuvre has been waged~ between the<br />
legislature and those who are minded to throw the burden of<br />
6 </p>
<p>CHAMBER OF MANUF. 7-<br />
taxation of f their own shoulders onto those of their fellow<br />
subjects. In that battle the legislature hWas often been<br />
worsted by the skill, determination, and resourcefulness of its<br />
opponents of whom the present appellant I do not know who<br />
he was has not been the least successful. It would not shock<br />
us in the least to find that the legislature has determined to<br />
put an end to the struggle by imposing the severest of penalties.<br />
It scarcely lies in the mouth of the taxpayer who plays with<br />
fire to complain about burnt fingers."<br />
He also said, " The fact that the section has to some extend a<br />
retroactive effect acaain appears to us of no importance when it<br />
is realised that the legislation is a move in a long and<br />
fiercely contested battle with individials who well understand<br />
the rigour of the contest."<br />
That was said in 1942. Then again the Lord Chancellor, Viscount<br />
Simon, who I understand was a somewhat distinguished jurist<br />
in the United Kingdom had this to say about a similar case and<br />
the same piece of legislation: " Judicial dicta ma . y be cited<br />
which point out that, however elaborate and artificial such<br />
methods may be, those who adopted them are ' entitled' to do so.<br />
There is, of course, no doubt that they are within the4r legal.<br />
rights. but that is no reason why their efforts, or those of the<br />
professional gentlemen who assist 1them ( the British are always<br />
so polite) in the matter should be regarded as a commendable<br />
exercise of ingenuity or ais a discharge of the duti-s of good<br />
ctizienship." He also upheld the legislation.<br />
He continued, " rTh the contrary, one result of such methods, if<br />
they succeed, is nf course to increase pro tanto the load of<br />
tax on the shoulders of the great bodT of good citizens who<br />
do not desire, or do not know ' now, to adopt these manoeuvres".<br />
That was said ; n 1943 as a result of conservative leqislation<br />
introduced in the 1930s.<br />
A Government as mine does not, does not like retrospective<br />
legislation, but in this instance and in relation to bottom of<br />
the habour schemes alone has introduced retrospective legislation<br />
to recoup the tax that should have been paid from people who<br />
profited from the device. That is not the only principle that<br />
governments govern by. I believe my Party and I hope my<br />
Government as a whole, has another principle which I believe is<br />
enormously, the principle to govern fairly and honestly for<br />
all Australians. It is a question therefore of competing<br />
principles. ' It is not fair to let people get away with<br />
the profits of bottom of. the harbour schemes. Are we going<br />
to place retrospectivity of fairness first in this particular<br />
contest and the Government has made the decision that fairness<br />
must be given greater weight than our abhorrence of retrospectivity<br />
in relation to this particular contest because what has happenead<br />
is patently unfair, has patently placed a greater burdea on<br />
certain citizens right across the Commonwealth and we need to<br />
understand that this cannot be tolerated and will not be<br />
allowed to continue. / 8 </p>
<p>CHAMBER OF MANUF.-8<br />
I think it is going to be terribly important, not only as<br />
a Government to establish the circumstances in which this<br />
situation is seen to he fair, but I also think it is going to<br />
be terribly important for the business of the industrial world,<br />
for the financial world, for them also to demonstrate that they<br />
regard the mere performance of a legal obligation<br />
is not sufficient -and that there<br />
needs to be an ethical base to business activities and to<br />
financial transactions. It is the law together with an-ethical<br />
attitude of society to the people with whom one does business,<br />
that makes this country and if we have to legislate fbr every<br />
wrongful act that people might have in mind, then we will be<br />
so subsumed in legislation of every kind Sir Lawrence Street<br />
and ever Judge in the land will have to work overtime and<br />
never get a Sunday off because so much would have to go the<br />
courts.<br />
What happens, what kind of country this is, does not just<br />
depend upon laws and a strict observance of the law, it also<br />
depends very much on the attitudes it has to each other, the<br />
way in which people do business with each other, the relationships<br />
which are conducted between companies and corporations and<br />
financial instititutions. If Australia wants to say to me<br />
that there is no ethical base in that, that it all has to<br />
be governed by law, then that is not the country that I know<br />
and it is not the country that I love.<br />
So ladies and gent'lemen in a mild way I offer a challenge,<br />
let all the good, and I know that that is overwhelmingly the<br />
majority all the good and honourable industrialists, businessmenand<br />
financiers and in this city and around this nation, rise up<br />
and join in the condem-nation of practices that are unethical<br />
that ought to be repudiated, that are being outlawed by the<br />
law and which drag this nation into disrepute.<br />
