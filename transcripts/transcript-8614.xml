TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON Pi J KEATING MP,<br />
ADDRESS TO THE SA ALP ANNUAL CONVENTION, TRADES HALL,<br />
ADELAIDE, 9 AUGUST 1992<br />

Delegates, ladies and gentlemen.<br />
Can I perhaps start by saying In times of difficulty the<br />
ALP In often more maudlin than the community at largo and<br />
it's so used to progress on all fronts whenever the<br />
progress is thwarted or blunted It has a propensity to<br />
become Introverted and reflective, There's an old saying<br />
that when the going gets tough the tough get going and<br />
that's basically what the federal Government has done.<br />
We're ploughing on, we're making changes, we're<br />
Instituting remedies and we're certainly not looking<br />
back. The economy has been In recession, this we all know is<br />
true, but the Government's doing everything possible for<br />
us to emerge from it as quickly as possible.<br />
Unemployment has risen we are doing everything we can<br />
to get egiplqym~ ent going again, but we say that we must<br />
move together, that economic progress and social progress<br />
must be as one, moving in tandem, moving together. We<br />
nay that economic change Is Imperative, but we won't let<br />
the unemployed carry the burden of the adjustment of that<br />
change, we say society must advance togpther, that we<br />
have to look after those who are left behind and we say<br />
that the great Australian and Labor traditions of<br />
egalitarianism and fairness and decency. can only be<br />
preserved In this way, moving together. The Government<br />
using the power of Government, drawing down community<br />
support, engaging in dialogue with various interest<br />
groups, finding solutions, acting in concert, acting in<br />
friendship. Real social change can only be assured in<br />
this way, with the Government playing a role. That is,<br />
not the Government withdrawing from society, but the<br />
Government engaging society and playing a role<br />
particularly when that role L3 necessary to make changes.<br />
For many of the years that this Government has been in<br />
office 41l of Its years we've used a consensus model<br />
and much has been achieved. And don't let anyone tell<br />
you that a consensus model has slowed change. Ln fact it </p>

has facilitated Change, it's facilitated economic change<br />
and It's facilitated social change, that is talking to<br />
people, talking to Interest groupa. understanding their<br />
Positions, encouraging them to do things they mightn't<br />
otherwise do and getting progress as a result,<br />
In the 19808 Labor reletyed the foundations or Australia,<br />
be totally certain of that. We ga~ ve Australia a new<br />
external orientation, we developed for the first time an<br />
open market economy, but we did it grafting on to it a<br />
comprehensive and progressive social policy. We went and<br />
put together something which I think has been unique<br />
amongst nations, that Is a very rapidly changing economic<br />
scene and policy wrapped together with a social policy<br />
which ha. basically let the country move forward.<br />
In other words we took the steps as all Labor Governments<br />
are required to take thp steps, the tough steps to give<br />
Australia an open market economy, but the difference Is<br />
we did it with a Labor heart, we did It differently to<br />
the way many other countries did it. And we made great<br />
strides and it's worth recalling those strides.<br />
In 1983 we started with a labour market of six million.<br />
Today, despite the unemployment, it's a labour market of<br />
million, It's twenty five per cent larger. We've<br />
largely kept the gains of the 1980E it's just that it's<br />
not now growing as rapidly although we saw 85,000 Job<br />
growth in the last two months. But those. large gains,<br />
that focus on employment we had in the~ 1980s has been<br />
largely preserved.<br />
GDFP, the total size of the economy in 1983 was 200<br />
billion, this year It's over 400 billion. Expmrts whichl<br />
we sought to provide for ourselvet from the industries In<br />
the places where people live, In manufacturing industry<br />
this~ year for the first time in our post-war history<br />
we've seen manufactured exports outstrip mining and rural<br />
exports for the first time. We defeated inflation,<br />
wo've got the lowest Inflation rate in the OECD, we<br />
defeated the thing which robs working pepople of their<br />
savings which puts big mortgages on their backs which<br />
makes us uncompetitive and gradually drains our economic<br />
life blood away. We change the labour ifiarket with<br />
enterprise bargaining in a way which will see trade<br />
unions and business work together to Product productive<br />
Industries and companies in a way we've never had under<br />
the old centralised structure before. And of course,<br />
we've revolutionised training, trade training and tertiary<br />
education all In this period as well. We've set up<br />
Medicare to give Australians the right to medical access<br />
regardless of Income. We've improved participatioll in<br />
education, as you know only three kids In ten completed<br />
sde-coindary'school in 1983, that's now seven in ten and<br />
we're heading for nine In ten. We've set up one of the<br />
boat income support systems in the world with the Family<br />

auperannuation for the whole work force and we've<br />
revolutionised aged care with home and community care,<br />
the hostel and nursing homes programs an~ d we've<br />
revolutionised of course, Childcare by Multiplying by<br />
five the number of places which existed when we came.<br />
But as good as that is, it Is important as 41l that is we<br />
want to build upon these things and make Australia a<br />
country I think, that can be the envy of people abroad, a<br />
society which has pride in itself and does things<br />
together and does things with comprehension and<br />
understanding. Australians I think, have got a great and unique<br />
opportunity. We're the only nation in the world that has<br />
a continent to itself arnd accordingly we have space, we<br />
have clean air and we have good housing. There's not too<br />
many countries like this, not now and as well as that we<br />
have a good aocial Policy to look after people as well<br />
and these possibilities are possibilities which I think<br />
few have. Few in this room would exchange those things<br />
to live~ in Tokyo or to live in Los Angles or to live in<br />
New York. They are not possibilities which exist In<br />
those places. But here if you are sick you get access to<br />
Medicare. in the United States t you rolled up to a<br />
hospital without that blue cross card In your pocket you<br />
get turned away, whether their acute or otherwise.<br />
Where In this country, aR I said a moment ago, seven kids<br />
In tan complete secondary school and soon we hope to be<br />
nine in ten, we've created fifty per cent of additional<br />
places for universitios to give Australian kids access to<br />
education, not fee paying, full fee paying like in many<br />
countries like as Dr Hewson would have it but acceag<br />
regardless of income and woe support you you're on a<br />
low income with Austudy arid we even support you in years<br />
eleven and twelve with it.<br />
Or vocational eucation. In the last Couple of wooks tho<br />
Government with the States has revolutionised vocational<br />
education. We'll see In a policy in which your own<br />
Premier played a substantial and key role the development<br />
of a national training authority whIeb will dofor<br />
vocational education what the Commonwealth was able to do<br />
for universities and give working class kids the great<br />
bulk of kids who come out of secondary school or earlier<br />
that change of participation in life in that training<br />
through to a Job.<br />
So whether It be in the sick or in education or the aged,<br />
if you're old you get support with the basic pension or<br />
as I said all the other things that are added on to thnt<br />
rent assistance, home and community care, the hostel<br />
program etc and If you're unemployed you get benefits,<br />
you're not tipped out after nine months as Dr Howson<br />
would propose or in the United States loft to yourselves,<br />

you to get you bank In the workforce and of course,<br />
generally training after that and now as we have throuuh<br />
the 19800 jobs and as we want in the 1990s jobs, hot<br />
interesting jobs.<br />
go, we can guarantee a good existence for ourselvots with<br />
an economy which serves us, which provides jobs where we<br />
lI ve In the capital cities and interosting jobs, but<br />
importantly doing the clever things. NJow a deleqate a<br />
few moment. ago mentioned this term the clever country<br />
and that's what we want to be and indeed that's what wo<br />
must be, but remember what the Liberals did to tie. They<br />
left UID as an Industrial muSetum. They thought the lucky<br />
country only had to dig up another mound of rocks or grow<br />
another paddock fuall of wheat and that's all we needed to<br />
do and if you went to find a job you found it at a mining<br />
site, in the rural areas of Australia, in South<br />
Australian or Queensland or Western Australia, If youi<br />
wanted a job you went there. But it wasn't enough. We<br />
had to find the jobs In the capital cities and the<br />
provincial cities where people live, doing clever things.<br />
They provided us with no research and development, that<br />
had pretty well collapsed. As I said there was no<br />
training in school, how could you have a clever country<br />
when only threp kids In ten completed secondary school?<br />
and fewer completed tertiary qualifications. Our terms<br />
nf trade were slipping: in the 1950s a bag of wheat<br />
brought you a truck load of manufac~ tures by the 1980s it<br />
brought you virtually nothing, yet these were the staples<br />
we were selling and of cotirse, the service sector as we<br />
know it today barely existed. This was the thing which<br />
the Coalition Left us.<br />
But of course, what they want to do is do the unclever<br />
thing again. They now want us to compete in the<br />
international division of labour which will do<br />
Australians no good and they now want to drive wages<br />
down, drive down the wages of young people and-p6-t-<br />
Australians onto three quarters of their award pay to try<br />
to make the place, as they put it, competitive. But<br />
competitive with who? Competitive with the IndnnesiAn6?<br />
I was In Surabaya abouit two months ago, Surabaya has hid<br />
billion US of investment for iwoe consecutive yearn.<br />
It's basically a modern Industrial region. Its proceso<br />
workers are employed at $ 1.30 Australian a day, $ 7 a<br />
week, for semi'. skilled process workers. That's the<br />
division that Dr Hewson wants us to compete in.<br />
The same people in Australia are paid $ 375 per week. So<br />
even if you cut the pay In half you wouldn't be<br />
competitive and yet to try and embark Upon such a policy<br />
iz nnt only cruel, but a hoax driving Australians to ao<br />
the things which other people are going to do more<br />
cheaply. The unclever things that we should be out uf<br />
and Into the things which we can do well and we know woe<br />
can do well. </p>

But this Idea of $ 3 per hour, or three quarters of your<br />
current pay, no awards, holiday pay, all the other<br />
conditions of employment to go under common law<br />
contracts, the law of the jungle to provide to obtain in<br />
the Industrial relations area, rancour, division,<br />
confrontation R1l for what? To do something more<br />
clever? No. To try and do the old things that we're now<br />
trying to remove ourselves from to do the more clever<br />
things that give us a future.<br />
We made a decision for instance, to have a car inut. r.<br />
We believe the role of Government says that you decide<br />
what you want to do and to decide what things and In<br />
which Industries people employed. In this State, In this<br />
city the car industry Is Important, Labour decided we<br />
want a car Industry, we've had it, we continue to want<br />
It, we want an efficient lower cost industry, but we want<br />
a car industry. We're not going to wipe It out with a<br />
zero tariff. We want a chemical industry through our<br />
Factor F program. We want a computer industry. We want<br />
strong parts of tie textile, clothing and footwear<br />
industry to remain strong and viable for AustraliA. We<br />
want to do the clever things, but we don't want to be<br />
doing the things that we can't and haven't been able to<br />
do well in the past and can't do competitively in tho<br />
future. In elaborately transformed manufactures, we've.<br />
now seen about thirty per cent growth a year, they've<br />
literally trebled since the early 1980s and are now<br />
leading the charge in our manufactured exports. We want<br />
to be Fielling our brains not our brawn and how can you<br />
hope to sell you brains if you're happy for kids to leave<br />
school untrained at sixteen to wander around the labour<br />
market looking for dead end jobs that have long since<br />
disappeared and not putting the effort into vocational<br />
education or not putting the support Into universities or<br />
to say that freedom to achieve to a kid is to go and buy<br />
a full fee paying place in a university if their paronts<br />
can afford the $ 15,000 or $ 20.000 a year after tax to put<br />
one person through liniversity.<br />
That's their idea of opportunity anid freedom, their Idea<br />
of adding value, their Idea of Osoing the clever thing,<br />
their Idea of the clever country.<br />
Now of course, as we know stmple ideas were never the<br />
stuff of Government. Government is a complex matter and<br />
it's a difficult matter and everybody who has any<br />
axperience of it knows this to be true. But we're now<br />
being fed this diet by the Conservatives that a simplo<br />
thing-and simple Ideas will change Australia, where we<br />
know that Australia is * a complex, like every other<br />
country in society, a complex thing where complex<br />
policies need to be bought to bear. And Dr Heweon's<br />
proposing that we should have a consumption tax as a way<br />
of solving all of our evils. As If another Primary tax<br />
is going to change Australia or change it for the better<br />
or solve all of the problems, long stonding problems<br />
which Australia has had. </p>

Ito basically has one policy with two prongs, Putting<br />
prices up and cutting wages. Putting prices up with a<br />
fifteen per cent CST and cutting wages by cutting awards<br />
and letting the award system expire and going to common<br />
laiw contracts. And tho view Is that that simple policy<br />
will change the way the country works. As if, for<br />
instance labour rates in this c~ ountry are axceedingly<br />
high, it's untrue. The wage share in the economy is at<br />
1960s levels, the profit share wilt spring back to Its<br />
highest level ever once there's some volume back there on<br />
the bottom line of companies. It's not true that we need<br />
a cut in wages. The average rate of income tax In<br />
Australia Is 2 . S per cent. A 15 per cent consumption<br />
tax Is a massive addition to taxation, a massive addition<br />
to prices, a percentage point addition to prices<br />
which will add 6-7 percentage points to Inflation which<br />
will 6-7 per centage points to interest rates. And that<br />
higher interest rate will buy more support for the<br />
exchange rate, the exchange rate will appreciate, the<br />
country will be less competitive.<br />
These are the policies which they're supporting. They<br />
think simple policies which they think will change<br />
Australia. Or the view that medical protection goes,<br />
that you got a health voucher, it basically Involves<br />
reople Insuring themselves for health. And all the<br />
people now who don't pay any Medicare levy, people up in<br />
the $ 20-30,000 range with children who pay no levy at<br />
all, will then he required to insure themselves through<br />
private insurance. And of course, in education the<br />
notion that the right of a working class kid to move<br />
through secondary school and then stream into university<br />
or into a high quality TAFE, that's a notion which Is<br />
totally foreign to them, they're saying basically, the<br />
places in universities will be left for those who can<br />
afford the fees. This ts the sort of view they have and<br />
of course, if you're unemployed it's because you<br />
basically don't want to work and if you're unemployed,<br />
you can go and took after yourself, go down to the St<br />
Vincent de Paul society or the Smith Family after nine<br />
months because you're on your own. And If you develop an<br />
underclass in Australia, a group that slips behind,<br />
something which for the first time In our life as a<br />
society we would tolerate and all the divisions which<br />
come with that, don't take any notice of that, they can<br />
fend for themselves because If the wealthy are doing well<br />
somp crumbs will drop from the table and they'll get<br />
tugged along.<br />
Now the tact is life in not simple, life is complex and<br />
Government is complex. Since February this year, if you<br />
lock at the things we've done as I've Said in the ' One<br />
Nation' statement we set up the start then and just<br />
completed the National Training Authority to lift up tho<br />
one great weakness in our education system which is<br />
vocational training. We're going to rebuild the rail<br />
highway of Australia with a standard gauge between </p>
<p>TEL 9. Aug. 92 19: 09 NO. 009 P. 07/<br />
7<br />
Adelaide and Melbourne so that Perth and Brisbane are<br />
linked via Melbourne through Adelaide for the first time<br />
a ribbon of rail around the country that a competent<br />
trading nation should have. That Is, an option in rail<br />
for the carriage of heavy goods and light goods If they<br />
are to be carried competitively and efficiently against<br />
road it's something a trading nation needs.<br />
And can I say while I'm on that, that today I've written<br />
to John saying that we're going to spend $ 12 million<br />
refurbishing the Indian Pacific-rail We going to<br />
spend $ 4 million iitiona I to the $ 3 million we<br />
announced In ' Onle Nation' to spend at Islington, that's a<br />
furthor $ 4 million to try and improve the quality and the<br />
service and the maintenance facilities of this part of<br />
the national rail system. We'll develop a better<br />
interface between the ports and wharves of Australia<br />
because we need it. And whether it be Port Adelaide or<br />
Port Melbourne through Dynon or Fisherman Islands at<br />
Prisbane or better access across the continent across the<br />
Nullabour from Fremantle, all these things we need<br />
because a private company is not going to do it, a<br />
private company Is not going to build a national rail<br />
highway of Australia, a private company I' not going to<br />
put together a new national training authority, a private<br />
company 18 not going to put together the new airline<br />
system we're currently in then position of putting<br />
together, a private company is not going to build the view<br />
road highway between Adelaide and Brisbane, a private<br />
company Is not going to build those arterial ring roads<br />
around the capital cities which we need to take traffic<br />
out of the contre of the cities arnd to allow better<br />
streaming of traffic~ around the continent.<br />
All these things we have done in the last couple of<br />
months, reshaped national training and developed am well<br />
this great transition from school to work, the Carmichael<br />
pilots which we~ had support for at the national meeting<br />
on youth which we're now funding and with the National<br />
, Training Ath) r-ity will concertina down by yiais tj<br />
important transition to regard those 15-19 years as a<br />
period of vocational preparation. That we'd done in the<br />
last couple of months, established a flew airline system<br />
in the last couple of months, if we can glet the Senate to<br />
agree a new pay TV system in the last couple of months, a<br />
refurbishment of the national rail highway and the two<br />
billion expenditure this year on roads.<br />
We'vie done these things because they need to be done.<br />
They're not going to be fixed with a simple Idea of a<br />
consumption tax. How's a consumption tax going to change<br />
the way in which the rail system works? Or a consumption<br />
tax change the way in which trade training works or the<br />
slrlinet? Government io complex and it's got to be dealt<br />
with with its complexity and the Government has to deal<br />
with talk to each of the groups In the community to see<br />
what can be done and to draw down that strength which<br />
we'va always been able to entwine together to produce </p>

something stronger and better for Australia. Th~ at is,<br />
giving Australia and giving the Government a proper role<br />
and understanding what that role Is.<br />
N~ ow with Dr Hewson-of course, we have simple ideas,<br />
ideology always penalties. Everyone has to wear a<br />
penalty. There's no notion that it ahould be an<br />
objective of Government in Australia to actually pay<br />
people more money, that higher incomes Is an objective of<br />
Government policy, that a better social system is an<br />
objective of Government policy. Their view is no, lower<br />
wages Is an objective, l* Ss of a system Is anl objective,<br />
penalties. Dr Hewuon wants to run the government so the<br />
government can do leass. The ILtberals want government in<br />
Australia so government can withdraw, so that government<br />
can get out to let the private economy do these things.<br />
There's no country in the world where this is vogue<br />
anymore, wher~ e the greed is good syndrome iR the vogue.<br />
It might have been tn the United States, in Reagan'R<br />
republican America of the 1980s or in Thatcher's Britain.<br />
It is no longer in the United States, it Is no longer in<br />
Rrttaln, it's not longer the theme of Prime Minister John<br />
Major for instance. It's no longer the themes you see<br />
running at the deumocrati~ c convention or In the US press.<br />
Rut here in Australia Heweon believes that greed ia good,<br />
survival of the fittest, simple Ideas, pushing people<br />
down iA the way forward and thinks he can get the jump<br />
all because the recession has meant employment has<br />
stopped. That Is because employment has not been growing<br />
in the last eighteen months like it did ferociously<br />
through the 1980s that this It his chance to impose this<br />
sterile drab ideology upon the rest of us.<br />
Well the fact In we've still got news for him and we'll<br />
be fighting him on that philosophy right the way throuigh,<br />
H~ is view is Government without consultation, talk to<br />
nobody, don't talkt to unions, don't talk to businese,<br />
he's attacked the unions won't have anything to do with<br />
them, he's attacked business for talking to the<br />
Ahovernment and supporting us, every week he lectures them<br />
on not supporting him enough with his barren ideology and<br />
this week we see that not only Is It going to be<br />
government under him, would It bO government without<br />
consultation, but it will also be government without<br />
bureaucracy. Because now he is going t~ o have the five<br />
major accountancy firms In there Crafting the tax laws,<br />
in an improper policy that no major party worth its sait<br />
would dare utter, which no Coalition government in the<br />
past would dare embrace, having the five accountancy<br />
firms in there sitting drawing up the taic laws of this<br />
country.<br />
This is the sort of stuff he is: turning theResorwo<br />
Rank o~ n its head and as the Governor of the Reserve Bank<br />
said eloquently " I'm not going to sit by why some<br />
dIckhead minister puts Attila the Hun in charge of<br />

The Liberals say we're always the ones, we're the people<br />
who break the traditions. We don't break the traditions,<br />
Labor always abides with the traditions mainly beanse we<br />
mae most of it. But the traditions of fairness, Aqutty,<br />
fair go, pulling people along, not having an under claiss<br />
of deprived people who can't find a job who don't got<br />
benefits, who don't get 8 right to treat themselves when<br />
they're sick, who don't get a right to educate their<br />
kids. That sort of thing is busting the traditions of<br />
Australia. This guy's a wrecker, he want's to come in<br />
with an ideology which is not only barren but entirely<br />
strange to the rest of us. Strange to the Labor Party<br />
Indeed, strange to the Coalition and a lot of the<br />
mainstream people In the Coalition would regard this<br />
stuff As poison, but sitting-there because ostensibly he<br />
has a lead In the polls, but not Bitting there with any<br />
comfort at this sort of policy.<br />
So we say thete Is role for government In Australia. If<br />
you want to run the government of Australia It's to let<br />
the Government do things. And whether that Is creating<br />
industries or supporting industries or leading structural<br />
change or continuing with a social policy which is<br />
spreading the joy. which is making the place fairer or<br />
more decent or finding our place in the world or coming<br />
to terms with the original Australians living at peace<br />
with the landscape, worrying about the environment,<br />
making Australia a better, nicer, fairer place to live to<br />
what government Is all about. It's not about government<br />
getting out, about government withdrawing, about leavinU<br />
It only to the wealthy to do well and leaving the rest<br />
fall behind,<br />
Now these are the things the next election will be fought<br />
over. Because I think at the next election we're going<br />
to see an ideology divide like we haven't seen in a long<br />
time. Now I know all Labor party leaders say that<br />
there's them and tin, but this time there really is themn<br />
and us,. Tt's them with an ideology which is barren and<br />
now forgotten In the northern hemisphere, being given its<br />
last trot in Australia in the 1990s, by someone who has<br />
had virtually only a cursory association with public<br />
life, who doesn't understand the society of Australia and<br />
has never listened to the resonances of Australia, Wh~ o's<br />
come in wit~ h a doctrinaire ideological policy which has<br />
the market being the sole arbiter of all that is good.<br />
the note device upon which all change is produced and<br />
where the role of government Is basically to get otat.<br />
Now we may it's wrong and we say It's wrong because we're<br />
continuing the changes. We're not sitting by maudlin<br />
saying well isn't It a pity we've had a recession and<br />
employment has stopped. We're saying look, we started<br />
with six million jobs, we've job seven and a halt still,<br />
7.6 in fact.. We've put this great social change int~ o<br />
place and we're going to improve it, we'll be improving<br />
It we improved it in ' One Nation' and we'll improve it<br />
in the coming Budget. We're going to continue with the </p>

big nocial chaiges and economic changes, whether It be<br />
the development of a proper vocational education system,<br />
giving AustraliAns the right to travel by air at<br />
reasonable prices, developing back our rail system which<br />
hasi fallen into disrepair, pulling the States outlying<br />
from Sydney and Melbourne closer in through these rail<br />
and road highways and making Australia truly, as we said<br />
In February, one nation.<br />
These are things that show Labor is the great building<br />
part~ y of Australia and we're still in there doing it, we<br />
haven't lost our way, we haven't lost our faith and we<br />
haven't lost our heart and we haven't lost the will to<br />
drive the changes on. And they can attack us about the<br />
recession, but to make the point here is to make the same<br />
point about Britain, the Unites States, Canada, Germany,<br />
France, Japan, they are all in the same boat, growing at<br />
tinder two per cent this year, we-re all living with the<br />
debt~ hangover of the 1980a, but we'll soon shake it off.<br />
But as we do we.' ll keep pride in our achievements and<br />
keep making them, adding one achievement to the next and<br />
not looking back, not wondering about the past, but just<br />
comprehending the future and giving Australiane that<br />
unique place In the world as t said. A continent to<br />
ourselvesc situated in the fasted growing part of the<br />
world the Asia-Pacific, looking to that area of the<br />
world PxternAlly, having our orientation shifted out not<br />
In, developing smairt and clever jobs, producing smart and<br />
clever things to give Australians good work and good pay,<br />
doing interesting things and looking after those who've<br />
not been able. to look after themselves as well as we<br />
would like.<br />
Thene are the things we stand for and that's still<br />
currency in the life blood of Australian politics,<br />
That's why we're still In there with a chance, a biq<br />
chance. So don't be Introspective or reflective or<br />
aiaudltn, just get on with It and understand that we are<br />
the only great party of change in Australia and we're<br />
still the ones who will make the changes Australia neFeds.<br />
Thank you. </p>
