PRIME MINISTER SATURDAY, 22 FEBRUARY, 1980<br />
ADDRESS AT OPENING OF HELLENIC CLUB, CANBERRA<br />
It really is a wonderful occasion, being asked to open this<br />
Club which has had so much effort put into it and which has<br />
been so evidently a very great success. To have a membership<br />
of 4,000, and a rising one, is really a tribute to those~ who<br />
conceived the Club in the first place and who conceived it not just<br />
as a place where Australian Greeks may come and enjoy themselves<br />
and make their friends, but as a place where all Australians<br />
might meet in the spirit of multiculturism. So, all praise<br />
and all credit to those who have conceived and who have worked<br />
so hard for the establishment of this Club.<br />
Indeed, i t is quite common to open a building, or a Club, that<br />
has been used for a little while. This occasion is no exception.<br />
But I think this is the first occasion in which I have been<br />
asked to open a venture which has been so much a success that<br />
after the opening I have been immediately asked to go and look<br />
at the plans for expansion. Again, I think that is further<br />
confirmation of the wisdom and the foresight of those who have<br />
brought the Club to this particular point.<br />
Hellenis : SMv4e ry much embodied in this Club's development,<br />
and the conception of it. As Gilbert Murray, in The Legacy<br />
of Greece, speaking on Hellenism and Ancient Greece described it:<br />
" a thing of the spirit, not dependent on the race to which a<br />
man belonged or on the place where he was born." It is very<br />
plain that that spirit is very much a part of this Club. That<br />
is the reason why I am so pleased to have been asked to<br />
participate in this opening ceremony.<br />
Greeks in Australia have been very much a part of Australian<br />
history for a very long while. I have been able to find<br />
that the first recordings of Greeks in Australia goes back<br />
to the 1830s. A small group then from the Ionian Islands<br />
established a wine industry at Camden. In 1898 the first<br />
Greek Orthodox Church was established in Sydney. Now, there<br />
are 120 parishes, 80 odd churches and half a million members.<br />
It is clear that Greeks in Australia are a significant religious,<br />
cultural, gocial and economic force, very much part of<br />
Australia's life.<br />
The contribution of the community to Australia has been great<br />
and significant in many different fields. The sons and grandsons<br />
1of Greece have certainly served Australia well down through<br />
the years: Sir Nicholas Lorantis, philanthropist; George Polites<br />
* of Greek parents; Gecrge Peponis, Captain of the Australian Rugby League<br />
Team; Greeks in acaddmia and law and medicine, in pharmacy, in<br />
commerce, have excelled and shown how much they can contribute<br />
and are contributing to the Australia that we all know. / 2 </p>
<p>-2<br />
my most distinguished predecessor, Sir Robert Menzies, once<br />
said: " we are all Greek because the Western culture was<br />
spawned in Greece". That also, I think is very true.<br />
Scholars have argued that Ancient Greece made man aware of<br />
himself and of his infinite capacities. The contribution of<br />
Greece and its people, and their influence, has been embedded<br />
in the history of the centuries and it is embedded in today's<br />
society and in today's values.<br />
Athletisism derives from the Greek concept of striving and<br />
contending. The great Greek athlete in ancient times, Hermes,<br />
is immortalised in sculpture. To the Greeks, Hermes embodies<br />
simplicity, balance, the pursuit of idealism, the joy of living<br />
in fellowship and the striving after perfection, and how much<br />
we should pursue that in these times.<br />
The Olympic Games, as we all know, has been very much derived<br />
from these ideals; the lamps of ancient Greek art inspired<br />
the modern Olympics. The modern torch is given to and received<br />
by other countries as the Olympic Gamnes have been held in recent<br />
times.<br />
But the values of Greece, the values of Olympia and of the*<br />
Olympic Games sometimes do get lost in propaganda; sometimes<br />
get lost-in the use to which the Games have been put, not once<br />
in this century but more than once in this century. The<br />
Government has been giving some thought to how in the future<br />
the Olympic Games might well be able to proceed with propaganda<br />
and politics really apart from it, as is meant to be in the<br />
Olympic charter but which, if we face it fairly, is not so in<br />
practice has not been so in practice over a great many years.<br />
The hopes and ideals of the Olympics have rarely been matched<br />
in practical effect. Perhaps the only way in which the Olympic<br />
Games and the spirit of the Olympics, the ideal of the Olympics<br />
can be preserved in the future is to make sure that the Olympic<br />
movement has its own permanent home, to make sure that it cannot<br />
be used for the politics of one country as a mark of approval<br />
or of disapproval in the years ahead. The suggestion,---therefore,<br />
that the Olympic Games should have a permanent home in Olympia,<br />
a piece of ground dedicated by the Greek Government to the Olympic<br />
movement, as has been suggested by the Greek Prime Minister, I<br />
believe deserves the most serious consideration by the whole<br />
Olympic movement and by national Olympic Committees right around<br />
the world.<br />
It is a decision that they would have to make. But I really<br />
believe that they do need to make decisions that will enable the<br />
Olympic Games to be held in future years fully in accord with<br />
the spirit of the Olympic movement and not paying lip service to<br />
that spirit as happens now and has happened so often in past years.<br />
If the spirit of Hermes and of Olympia are to prevail down through<br />
the years, the Government believes that that would be the best way<br />
to achieve it. If that is the wish, ultimately, of the Olympic<br />
movement, and it makes a decision in principle that it is prepared not<br />
just to talk about it, then the Government will be prepared to<br />
provide practical assistance to help the modern Olympic movement<br />
find a permanent home in Greece. Government assistance would<br />
be available for that. </p>
<p>3<br />
What is the spirit of the Olympic movement, as it ought to be,<br />
is very much a part of the spirit of this Club: bringing<br />
people together no matter what their background where they<br />
can learn to know each other and make their friendships.<br />
Again, I would like to congratulate all those who have been<br />
a part of it. They have set an example which many others<br />
could well follow in the way they lead their normal and daily<br />
lives and I have very great pleasure, therefore, in declaring<br />
this new Hellenic Club officially open. I wish many thousands<br />
of people many hours of happiness and friendship within the<br />
walls of the Club. I will look forward to seeing the expansion<br />
of the development of. the Club down through the years.<br />
