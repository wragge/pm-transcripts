VISIT TO US, CANADA AND UK<br />
OTTAW~ A, CANADA<br />
RESPONSE BY THE PRIME MINISTER, MR. HAROLD HOLT<br />
TO THE OFFICI AL WELCOME BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
OF CANADA 4th JUNE~, 1967<br />
Mr. Prime Minister, Mrs. Pearson, distinguished members of the<br />
Diplomatic Corps, ladies and gentlemen.<br />
It is a very great personal pleasure for Mrs. Holt and myself, and a<br />
privilege in which my Government and my countrymen share, to be with you on<br />
a period of your national history which has such significance for you.<br />
This is my second visit to your country and I regret the interval which<br />
has elapsed since I was last here. But that also was an occasion of some historic<br />
significance for Canada. It was the year 1952, in which In this distinctive<br />
Parliament building you were host to the Parliaments of the Commonwealth<br />
through the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association. It was my great honour<br />
to be Chairman of that notable conference. I have long, wished since then to be<br />
able to see something more of your country and to meet more closely with your<br />
people. Although I had heard and read much of the great economic and cultural<br />
development which had occurred over the years, I confess to still experiencing<br />
some surprise at the remarkable growth which has occurred in this capital city<br />
of yours, at seeing how imaginatively you have developed your architecture and<br />
the beautification of the city. This I believe symbolizes the notable growth which<br />
has been occurring throughout Canada, strengthening your economy and making<br />
you a more significant member country of the United Nations.<br />
Your contribution there, of course and this has been particularly<br />
marked during the period of office of your distinguished Prime Minister has<br />
been influential well beyond the numbers of your people. Vie like to think that<br />
as you, with populations that are not large as world populations are marked<br />
these days and as the populations of many other countries can demonstrate, that<br />
we do have a performance out of relation to our numbers and even an influence<br />
going well beyond our numerical strength and I welcomed very warmly, Mr.<br />
Prime Minister, the things that you have said in your short but very meaningful<br />
speech here this afternoon of the desirability of the closeness of our two countries,<br />
which have so much in common, which have built a friendship in the comradeship<br />
of war and in the pursuits of peace, in the growth of trade between our two<br />
nations. Vblth so much in common, if we pursue them as closely as we can, our<br />
policies together can make a contribution growing in significance with the years<br />
ahead of us. You and I have already talked of this in an informal way. I hope<br />
that in the years ahead, not only as our populations increase and our economic<br />
strength develops, but as our own contribution to a peaceful and progressing<br />
world is enhanced, that our discussions together, the better knowledge we shall<br />
I hope develop of each other, will contribute more significantly to the peace,<br />
to the progress and the prosperity of the world.<br />
You have spoken of our participation in EXPO ' 67. It has not been in<br />
the Australian tradition to take part in these great international expositions.<br />
Wie have felt that we could make a more significant contribution in relation 2/ </p>
<p>to our own national situation if we took part by ourselves from time to time<br />
in the expositions of individual countries. But when we took into account the<br />
significance for Canada, our historic Commonwealth partner, in the<br />
celebration of its centennial, then we came unhesitatingly to the conclusion<br />
that Australia should be there. And it gratifies us indeed, Mr. Prime Minister,<br />
to feel that you have judged our contribution to be a worthy one.<br />
Certainly the attendances already have more than flattered our<br />
expectations and we hope that this experience will continue throughout the<br />
period of the Exposition. As to the talking chairs, I must confess that while<br />
at one time rabbits were regarded as the principal plague in Australia, there<br />
are fellow countrymen of mine who think that talking politicians now rank in<br />
the same category and it is perhaps not without some appropriateness that,<br />
as you recline in a comfortable chair in the Australian pavilion, one of our<br />
more notable citizens, sometimes in the political field but I hope more<br />
frequently in other fields of science or culture, will address you on some<br />
matter of national moment.<br />
You were good enough to say that we had established some degree of<br />
international supremacy in the fields of tennis and swimming. ' We hope to<br />
maintain that. But being an ambitious people, we think that before the year is<br />
out we may have chalked up another notable gain by taking for the first time in<br />
its history, I believe, the Americas Cup back from that country to Australia.<br />
If we can get it there, I think our American friends and allies will find it even<br />
more difficult to regain outside the Heads of Sydney Harbour than the Davis<br />
Cup on one of our tennis arenas.<br />
However, I am sure that, despite the friendship you have with your<br />
great neighbour, you will be wishing us well. We smaller countries always<br />
like to see the other tackle the bigger fellow and succeed. It is a commendable<br />
ambition and one in which I am sure we shall have your good wishes.<br />
Now I don't want to add another chapter to the record of long-talking<br />
Australian politicians by abusing your patience on this warm afternoon. Your<br />
record for hospitality has been evidenced again today in that, after a period<br />
of cool weather, you have turned on a sunny Australian day with a temperature<br />
that must be very uncomfortable for that handsome guard I have just had the<br />
honour to inspect. And so I must not detain you at length.<br />
But thank you again for the warmth of your welcome to Mrs. Holt and<br />
myself and our party representing as we do in your eyes the Australian<br />
Government and people. We are greatly looking forward to the remainder of<br />
our stay with you and we are delighted to have an opportunity of contributing<br />
by our presence to the success of the ambitious and imaginative project which<br />
you are so successfully carrying out.<br />
Long, may Canada prosper, long may it strengthen in its influence<br />
and its economy, long may the friendship between our two countries be<br />
successfully sustained. </p>
