<p>Australia and Nauru have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) for the establishment of a regional processing centre in Nauru, Prime Minister Julia Gillard and the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship Chris Bowen announced today.</p>
<p>The MOU was signed in Rarotonga earlier today by Australia's Parliamentary Secretary for Pacific Island Affairs and for Foreign Affairs Richard Marles and the Nauru Foreign Affairs and Trade Minister Kieren Keke.</p>
<p>The MOU is the next step in implementing the recommendations of the Expert Panel on Asylum Seekers and an important development in setting up the regional processing centre for irregular maritime arrivals in Nauru.</p>
<p>The signing today formalises this arrangement between Australia and Nauru.</p>
<p>The Government is committed to working in partnership with Nauru to establish a regional processing centre at the earliest opportunity.</p>
<p>This MoU sends a clear message that countries in this region are working together towards a lasting regional response in taking action necessary to undermine people smuggling networks, stop those dangerous boat journeys and prevent the loss of life at sea.</p>
<p>It also reaffirms the commitment of both countries to the Refugee Convention, with people to be treated with dignity and respect in line with human rights standards.</p>
<p>The Government is committed to implementing the expert panel's key principle related to a strategic, comprehensive and integrated policy approach that provides no advantage to people considering risking their lives on dangerous boat journeys.</p>
<p>Defence personnel are continuing work on temporary accommodation on Nauru and the Government is progressing arrangements on a number of fronts including contracting service providers and sourcing supplies.</p>
