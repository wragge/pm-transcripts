    <content><![CDATA[<p>a<br />PRIME MINISTER<br />I1I November 1996 TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER<br />THE HON JOHN HOWARD MP<br />ADDRESS AT AUSTRALIAN WAR MEMORIAL<br />Your Excellencies, Sir Phillip Bennett, General Gration, General Gower, members of<br />the Foundation, other distinguished guests, Ladies and gentlemen.<br />I first camne to this War Memorial in May of 1952. 1 then paid my first ever visit to<br />Canberra with my parents. I saw Parliament House for the first time in the flesh, so to<br />speak, and I later on came over to the War Memorial. I have to confess, an odd<br />confession given the late event that my life took, but I spent a great deal more time at<br />the War Memorial than I did at Parliament House. I was absolutely captivated by the<br />Memorial, I was fascinated by those dioramas depicting the battles of World War I and<br />the general layout and presentation of the Memorial and I have carried with me since<br />then, and I guess it was kindled in other ways in my upbringing some understanding, I<br />hope, of the enormous sacrifice made by successive generations of Australians in<br />defence of our country. We all can, I suppose, recite the experiences on an occasion<br />like this, none of course more so than those who actually served. But I can remember<br />visiting the cemeteries of northern France and walking through that magnificent<br />Australian War Memorial at Villers-Bretonneux and quite literally being overcome by<br />the sheer immensity, if I can put it that way, of the youth of the people who died in<br />defence of this country. To watch headstone after headstone recording an age of 17,<br />18, 19, 21, 22. The awfu~ l horror and waste and sacrifice of so many young men and<br />women in defence of Australia.<br />We owe everything that we have to those who died to defend our country. We owe<br />immeasurably to those who put their lives on the line. The maintenance of this War<br />Memorial which I agree stands tall amongst the war memorials of the world, I haven't<br />seen any better and I want to congratulate those who over the years have worked so<br />very hard to keep the War Memorial going. I want to assure you of the ongoing and<br />strong support of the Federal Government and in saying that I know I speak for both 2019</p>
<p>sides of Politics, because honouring the Australian war dead is something that<br />transcends all other divides.<br />May I say , Sir Phillip, that I am very impressed with the quality of the members of the<br />Foundation that you have assembled. You have got together a group of people who<br />have been successful in commerce, who have an understanding of the history of the<br />Memorial and an understanding of the history of the Australian sacrifice in battle all<br />around the world.<br />So in launching the Foundation I give with that launch the very strong support of the<br />Government. I want to join Sir Phillip in publicly thanking Sir William Deane, Mr<br />Kerry Packer and Mr John Laws for their own exceptional contribution to the success<br />of the Foundation.<br />A partnership between the Government and private individuals in the corporate sector<br />is to be encouraged in something of this kind. In case anybody needed any reminding<br />all contributions to the Foundation are naturally fully tax deductible and I wouldn't like<br />to let the opportunity go by without making that very obvious point.<br />Now in one's life you get tied up with a lot of foundations. You get tied up with<br />foundations associated with sporting organisations and I have even been tied up with<br />the odd foundation associated with schools at which one's children are educated.<br />Some of them are very good, some of them are not so good, I think this one is going<br />to be the very best because it is in a case that binds all of us together. It is always a<br />good thing in national life to try to focus on things that unite Australians rather than<br />things that divide them and if there is one thing that unites all Australians it is a deep<br />heartfelt gratitude to those men and women who gave everything to save our country<br />and who gave everything to give us the peace and the tranquillity and the way of life<br />that we enjoy today.<br />So can I wish you, Sir Phillip, and all of the members of your council great success,<br />great fundraising expertise, which I know you have. And you carry with you the good<br />wishes and the affection of all of the Australian people to honour our war dead is the<br />most uniting and ennobling of causes and one that will attract the support of all<br />Australians.<br />Thank you.<br />2020</p>
