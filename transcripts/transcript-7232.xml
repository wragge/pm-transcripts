    <content><![CDATA[<p><strong>6 October 1987</strong></p>
<p>I have decided to recommend to the Administrator that he appointÂ Professor Ray Martin to. the position of Chairman of theÂ Australian Science and Technology Council ( ASTEC) for a threeÂ Year term commencing January 1988.</p>
<p>Professor Martin,-who is 61, succeeds Professor Ralph SlatyerÂ whose term ends in December. He has had a distinguished careerÂ as a research chemist in both academic and industry spheres, andÂ as an academic administrator. Professor Martin was educated atÂ the University of Melbourne-and Cambridge University, lectured atÂ the University of New South Wales, led a research team at IC1,Â was Professor of Inorganic Chemistry first at the University ofÂ Melbourne and then at the Australian National University. InÂ 1977, he was appointed Vice-Chancellor of Monash University, aÂ position he held with distinction until his term concluded earlyÂ this year.</p>
<p>Professor Martin comes to ASTEC at a time of considerable changeÂ in the structure of Government science and technology inÂ Australia and I have complete confidence that he will give theÂ leadership needed to ensure that ASTEC provides the best adviceÂ to me and my Government on science and technology matters.Â ASTEC'S role in providing an overview on science and technologyÂ matters throughout . Government administration and advising whereÂ co-ordination is necessary will be particularly important in Â the period ahead. So also will its contribution to strategicÂ thinking on the role of science and technology in the economicÂ and social development of Australia.</p>
<p>Under Professor Slatyer's leadership, ASTEC has emphasised theÂ importance of science and technology in increasing innovation andÂ competitiveness of Australian manufacturing industry and inÂ stimulating increased exports of medium and high technologyÂ products. A major stimulus to industrial research andÂ development has been the introduction of the 150 percent taxÂ incentive following ASTEC recommendations.</p>
<p>Significant achievements of Professor Slatyer's five year periodÂ as Chairman of ASTEC have been the report on Australia's role inÂ the nuclear fuel cycle which charted the course for GovernmentÂ policy on uranium mining and safeguards, and the series of majorÂ reports on the quality and relevance of Government funding ofÂ R&amp; D. These have led to a substantial restructuring of CSIRO andÂ of higher education research funding with the recentÂ establishment of the Australian Research-Council. I wish toÂ thank Professor Slatyer for his contribution to AustralianÂ science and technology and wish him well in his return to aÂ full-time academic career.Â </p>
