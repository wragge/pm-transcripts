<p>Later today I'll meet the Premier of Victoria Mr Bracks for important talks on the future of one of Australia's most critical resources, the Murray-Darling Basin.</p>
<p>In January I announced the Government's $10 billion National Plan for Water Security, outlining a once-in-a-generation opportunity to change forever the management of the nation's biggest river system.</p>
<p>Under the plan, the Commonwealth will take responsibility for key water management functions in the Murray-Darling Basin.</p>
<p>A referral of powers to enable the Commonwealth to manage water in the Murray-Darling Basin is the only way to ensure decisions are taken in the national interest. It also provides certainty for all parties.</p>
<p>Mr Bracks and I will be trying to resolve the remaining issues today. My Government has taken a patient and constructive approach to resolving the concerns of the Victorian Government.</p>
<p>We're not asking anything of the Victorian Government that has not already been agreed to by all other state and territory governments. The Parliamentary leaders of the Oppositions in all states and territories offered their unanimous support for the initiative at a meeting in Sydney during the weekend.</p>
<p>It should be remembered that the $10 billion water plan does not involve one dollar in extra funding from the state governments.</p>
<p>I'll be asking Mr Bracks to sign up to the plan quickly so that this critical resource can be properly managed.</p>
<p>It's time to act to protect the Murray-Darling Basin and to provide certainty for those farmers and rural and regional communities who rely so heavily on its sustainability.</p>
