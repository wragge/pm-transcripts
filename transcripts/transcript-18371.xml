The Australian Government this morning boosted its assistance to flood-affected Australia, providing a RAAF Hercules C-130 to conduct an aero-medical evacuation of low-dependency patients from St George Hospital in Western Queensland to hospitals in Brisbane and the Gold Coast.</p>
<p>The C-130 Hercules joins the eight Australian Defence Force (ADF) helicopters already assisting in the flood relief efforts in South East Queensland.</p>
<p>The situation in the area of St George deteriorated yesterday and overnight resulting in the need to evacuate patients from the St George Base Hospital to the Gold Coast.</p>
<p>The Air Force C-130 Hercules aircraft was on stand-by for such an emergency and will assist with the transport of these patients quickly and effectively to the Gold Coast. The Queensland authorities requested this assistance for the welfare of these patients and the Commonwealth immediately responded.</p>
<p>The Commonwealth continues to cooperate closely with the Queensland and NSW Governments in this unfolding flood situation, standing ready to help wherever we are called.</p>
<p>Four Black Hawk and four Kiowa helicopters, based at Oakey, continue to assist with search, evacuation and the resupply of people affected by the flood in the area of Roma, St George and Dirranbandi, South East Queensland.</p>
<p>Overnight the focus of the helicopters has been St George and Charleville as the floodwaters continue. The helicopters have winched people to safety in the area of St George and provided much needed food, bedding and medical supplies, as well as other equipment such as generators, to those affected by the flooding.</p>
<p>Emergency Management Australia has liaison officers in flood-affected regions to ensure that requests for any further assistance can be actioned immediately.The Commonwealth continues to work with the Queensland and NSW Governments to provide financial assistance to local communities affected by recent heavy rains and flooding through the Natural Disaster Relief and Recovery Arrangements.More information on this financial assistance can be found at <a href="http://www.disasterassist.gov.au">www.disasterassist.gov.au</a></p>
