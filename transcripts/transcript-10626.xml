    <content><![CDATA[<p>O'BRIEN:</p>
<p>John Howard, I know that you are still hoping for a diplomatic</p>
<p>   solution, on Iraq, what do you think the odds are of that solution</p>
<p>   being found diplomatically?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Difficult, Kerry. I spoke to President Clinton after I had made</p>
<p>   the Government's announcement to the Australian people and</p>
<p>   he still entertains some hope that there could be a diplomatic solution</p>
<p>   and he believed, and there is some support for the view, that the</p>
<p>   greater the gathering of international opposition to Saddam, perhaps</p>
<p>   the greater the opportunity there might be some compromise.</p>
<p>But I have to be honest and say to you, and through you, to the</p>
<p>   Australian public, that the prospects are not terribly strong, that</p>
<p>   there will be a diplomatic solution that we must continue to try</p>
<p>   because I don't want there to be a military strike. It's</p>
<p>   the hardest decision that we have had to take, in terms of personal</p>
<p>   responsibility, because it might involve the exposure of Australian</p>
<p>   lives. It's certainly the most solemn and the most serious</p>
<p>   decision I have had to take as Prime Minister and I just don't want</p>
<p>   any stone left unturned to try and find a diplomatic solution.</p>
<p>O'BRIEN:</p>
<p>How much has the President told you about the range of options</p>
<p>   that might be covered, by what America is calling, a substantial</p>
<p>   attack on Iraq?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, you understand that I can't go into too much detail,</p>
<p>   and he didn't go into an enormous amount of detail, but he</p>
<p>   made it very clear that perhaps one of the worst of all worlds would</p>
<p>   be if military action were needed and taken, and that military action</p>
<p>   were only token, and that served to strengthen Saddam Hussein's</p>
<p>   position in Iraq and amongst his neighbours. I mean, what has to</p>
<p>   be done, if a military strike is necessary, is to cripple the capacity</p>
<p>   for the retention and delivery of the weapons of mass destruction.</p>
<p>   The biological and chemical warfare material which could reek havoc</p>
<p>   on, not just thousands but millions of people, if it is used indiscriminately.</p>
<p>   And we have not only got to deny that in relation to Iraq but also</p>
<p>   by demonstration, in relation to other countries, that might feel</p>
<p>   that they also can do it if Saddam Hussein gets away with doing</p>
<p>   it.</p>
<p>O'BRIEN:</p>
<p>To what extent would the forces be hamstrung by a lack of knowledge</p>
<p>   about where some of these chemical weapons caches might be, given</p>
<p>   that the inspection teams have not been able, really, to pin-point</p>
<p>   all that they suspect is there?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I can't assert that the knowledge is total, and therefore</p>
<p>   there has to be some constraint there, but the advice I have received</p>
<p>   is that the Americans have a great deal of information and that</p>
<p>   their capacity to deliver an effective, disabling strike, in relation</p>
<p>   to that material, is quite high.</p>
<p>O'BRIEN:</p>
<p>Are you disappointed that so few countries have pledged military</p>
<p>   support, so far, compared to the powerful alliance of the Gulf war?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, because I don't think the returns are all in on that.</p>
<p>   I think you will find, over the days and weeks ahead, that there</p>
<p>   will be more contributors. You have got to remember, with Desert</p>
<p>   Storm, that there was a four or five month lead time. The Desert</p>
<p>   Storm operation was mounted after the Iraqi occupation of Kuwait</p>
<p>   and there was a deadline set, the line in the sand, which is passed</p>
<p>   into our language, this is a different situation and I think it</p>
<p>   is all together premature to say that the response has been insignificant.</p>
<p>O'BRIEN:</p>
<p>Is Australia there for as long as it takes, and if it comes to</p>
<p>   that, how long might that be? Is this an open-ended commitment?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well nothing is open-ended, of course it is not open-ended. I mean,</p>
<p>   we have made a measured decision and we are talking about the sort</p>
<p>   of forces that have been discussed in the news tonight. It is not</p>
<p>   certain that they will be the forces that end up going. They're</p>
<p>   the type of forces that we are discussing with the Americans that</p>
<p>   might be suitable, it could well be that the Americans will come</p>
<p>   back to us and say, look, it would be better if you considered something</p>
<p>   else of a like order of magnitude. But, I want to make it plain</p>
<p>   that we are not considering any kind of open-ended commitment. It</p>
<p>   is quite defined, it is quite limited but it is very effective and</p>
<p>   we want it to be strategic.</p>
<p>O'BRIEN:</p>
<p>Norman Schwarzkopf, the hero of Desert Storm, says of the Clinton</p>
<p>   plan quote: "We run the risk of doing the same thing we did</p>
<p>   in North Vietnam. We escalated the bombing and every time they survived</p>
<p>   it, they came back, came out, brushed themselves down and said,</p>
<p>   well, we survived and it toughened their resolve. What weight do</p>
<p>   you give to General Schwarzkopf's concerns?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I certainly give a great deal of weight to General Schwarzkopf's</p>
<p>   military capacities and I understand the enormous role that he played</p>
<p>   in Desert Storm. I think you have got to - I don't know the</p>
<p>   total context of those remarks and it is always difficult to just</p>
<p>   comment on one segment of the speech of that kind - but the fact</p>
<p>   remains a matter of, I guess, elementary principle, that if Saddam</p>
<p>   Hussein is allowed to thumb his nose at the authority of the United</p>
<p>   Nations and thumb his nose at, what I think is, collectively, the</p>
<p>   civilised world, then that makes the Middle East a lot less secure</p>
<p>   and it also sends a signal to other nations around the world that</p>
<p>   similar conduct by them could perhaps suffer the same lack of response.</p>
<p>O'BRIEN:</p>
<p>What consideration have you given to the possibility that this</p>
<p>   alliance might be playing into President Saddam Hussein's hands,</p>
<p>   given the cat-and-mouse games he has played in the past, it is openly</p>
<p>   being speculated in the UN circles that his game plan may be to</p>
<p>   provoke military action, which is inconclusive, heightens anti-American</p>
<p>   sentiment in the region, particularly, and results in a weakening</p>
<p>   of sanctions against Iraq.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well that sort of argument can always be mounted. I guess that</p>
<p>   goes back to an earlier comment of mine that if the military strike</p>
<p>   - if it regrettably becomes necessary - is not sufficiently strong,</p>
<p>   then that could be the result. I mean, one of the worst outcomes</p>
<p>   would be to have a moderate strike that doesn't disable, builds</p>
<p>   the propaganda status of Iraq, that would be damaging.</p>
<p>O'BRIEN:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, your reaction to the lack of progress among the</p>
<p>   Republicans to the Convention. I hope you are not too distressed.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, I don't think you have heard the last word on this. I</p>
<p>   think the Convention has been very successful and I am still very</p>
<p>   confident that a clear voice in favour of a particular republican</p>
<p>   model will come out of the Convention. I hope it does because I</p>
<p>   have pledged my Government to have a referendum next year and at</p>
<p>   no stage have I tried to stop a clear expression of republican opinions.</p>
<p>   I haven't tried to be obstructive. I have tried to facilitate,</p>
<p>   to help, to urge and encourage people to get together and talk and</p>
<p>   reach an agreement. I want unity and national Australian purpose</p>
<p>   to be maintained on this issue and I think the spirit of the Convention</p>
<p>   has been remarkably positive right across the board.</p>
<p>O'BRIEN:</p>
<p>What vote would you accept? As a rough rule of thumb, what vote</p>
<p>   would you accept as significant enough to become the model that</p>
<p>   you would put to a referendum?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I am sticking to what I said at the beginning, and that is a clear</p>
<p>   view. Now I am not going to start dealing in numbers. You know that</p>
<p>   it would be very...</p>
<p>O'BRIEN:</p>
<p>No, I think we would be very puzzled at this stage as to what you</p>
<p>   mean.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, I don't think many people at the Convention would be puzzled</p>
<p>   about that.</p>
<p>O'BRIEN:</p>
<p>I bet you've got a number in your head.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No I have a clear view and the clear view depends on the circumstances.</p>
<p>O'BRIEN:</p>
<p>If there is no clear republican model, or no clearer view of a</p>
<p>   republican model by the end of the week, then I guess we are left</p>
<p>   with your commitment to a plebiscite. Would you reserve the right</p>
<p>   to campaign individually for the monarchist status quo in that plebiscite</p>
<p>   and/or referendum?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Kerry, I have stated the Government's decision and that is</p>
<p>   that at any referendum or plebiscite, members of the Liberal Party</p>
<p>   of Australia will have a free or open vote and it follows from that</p>
<p>   that if we have a referendum next year, the Government won't</p>
<p>   be supporting either a yes case or a no case.</p>
<p>O'BRIEN:</p>
<p>But you seemed the other day in your comments to be leaving open</p>
<p>   the possibility that you may all campaign individually on different</p>
<p>   ....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well yes, I mean, and it follows, if you have an open vote then</p>
<p>   you don't have a Government position. Now what I as an individual,</p>
<p>   look, I mean look Kerry, I have never disguised the fact that I</p>
<p>   will vote as of now to support the status quo. I will vote for the</p>
<p>   status quo at the Convention in the final run off with a preferred</p>
<p>   republican model because I don't think any alternative I have</p>
<p>   seen will deliver a better system of government. Now I am not trying</p>
<p>   to ram that down people's throats but I have been consistent</p>
<p>   on that all along.</p>
<p>O'BRIEN:</p>
<p>But you are leaving open the possibility that you as Prime Minister,</p>
<p>   one individual, but as Prime Minister, campaigning for your preferred</p>
<p>   position if and when a referendum, or even a plebiscite...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Of course I am leaving that open but the extent to which I campaign,</p>
<p>   if I were to decide to do that, could take many forms.</p>
<p>O'BRIEN:</p>
<p>And if we have a plebiscite, I am just interested in this because</p>
<p>   we could have you campaigning for the status quo, we could have</p>
<p>   Peter Reith campaigning for the... Peter Costello going for the</p>
<p>   McGarvie model, Peter Reith campaigning for an elected president,</p>
<p>   Robert Hill pushing another one. I mean, that's a fascinating</p>
<p>   concept.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>And of course on the other side, if you wanted to continue it,</p>
<p>   you could have Peter Beattie, the Labor leader in Queensland and</p>
<p>   Geoff Gallop campaigning in one direction and Kim Beazley in another</p>
<p>   but in a sense, I think the Australian people accept the maturity</p>
<p>   of the Liberal Party's decision to allow a free or open vote</p>
<p>   but can I say in relation to the plebiscite, I think a plebiscite</p>
<p>   would be a big mistake. I think what we want is a clear republican</p>
<p>   model out of this Convention and that can be pitted against the</p>
<p>   status quo next year. I have said all along I want a vote so that</p>
<p>   if people do want to change, the change can come into effect on</p>
<p>   the centenary of our federation as a nation, the first of January,</p>
<p>   2001.</p>
<p>Equally, if the public doesn't want a change next year, then</p>
<p>   it's off the agenda for the centenary celebration. I am not</p>
<p>   saying it's off the agenda for all time because obviously it</p>
<p>   wouldn't be. It's the sort of thing that could always</p>
<p>   come back and probably would. I think the temper of this issue is</p>
<p>   that it will, if it's defeated next year, it could easily come</p>
<p>   again in a few years time. It may not be defeated next year. I don't</p>
<p>   know and I don't think we should take too much notice of opinion</p>
<p>   polls except to note that even the best republican result in that</p>
<p>   Newspoll this morning, which was 56 per cent for a direct president</p>
<p>   against the status quo, 56 per cent is not a big lead to start with.</p>
<p>O'BRIEN:</p>
<p>It's pretty significant compared to the other votes, though.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, except that there was some referenda proposals in 1988 that</p>
<p>   started with 80 per cent in opinion polls so all I am saying is</p>
<p>   that there's a lot of sort of volatility in this issue and,</p>
<p>   can I say of the Convention, I think it's been an outstanding</p>
<p>   success but the spirit that it's demonstrated, I have seen</p>
<p>   people right across the political divide and within each side have</p>
<p>   completely different points of view and they have done it with immense</p>
<p>   stability and decency and I think it really bodes well for the soul</p>
<p>   of Australia that we can have a gathering like this conducted in</p>
<p>   such a simple manner.</p>
<p>Omanner.</p>
<p>O'BRIEN:</p>
<p>John Howard, thanks for talking with us.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>It's a pleasure.</p>
