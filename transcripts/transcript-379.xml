My colleague having said uverythingt I shall nov proceed<br />
to sal it again. 1hat's fair t. gh I think.<br />
3ut two things struck me very :'! uoh dfrhof 1 came In here*<br />
The first was that Odhs din religious air, this cloak or darkness,<br />
seemed to so to be a sort of fittin, surround ' or a politician<br />
( Laughter) asort of sjmbollsm whbich 1 didn exi. ect -ro. my<br />
somewhat matter of fact colleague Kro -ulmov. And -Ae 3econd thing<br />
that struck me, ratber unpleasantly, ias that -you know hat my<br />
opponents jay about soe thero was a &amp; rout pla. card right In front of<br />
as, which says OHMO.( High Altituade Measurement) ( Laughter) jut apart<br />
from these two incidents I am delighted to have the opportunity of<br />
openiing this Exhibition*<br />
Xy aoflcaga* e, Mr. 4' ulmep Is 4-, uito r h. vo) n no lays that<br />
the work done in ros arch and dorelopient , In ustrai. ia is really most<br />
romarkable. I tnm ure there iero jpople in the rid % i! to Im ginned<br />
that we 4ero not up to it just as theeo have been,, in my own<br />
ifetime9 people in the cild who thought triaL , utstralia was<br />
incapable of manuf act iring Zoods on the Zmad zcalo and in the<br />
highest qality. It takes a whie C'or ,. eople to realse that this<br />
cjuatry of ours is a modern conunity wi th as Iuuch c~ paoi ty per head<br />
of . opulation, as can be found anywhere else in the jorid; and, I<br />
sometimes think,, perhaps a little more.<br />
This is demonstrated in Lhe field of scientific research,<br />
applic tion. of it in research nd deielopsont of 4Iea,-ons. It is a<br />
4reat pity that in this w'orld 4e sho~ ld hat* to devote so uoh time<br />
arid talent and money to the prodaacti,) n of weoapons, but we umv that<br />
are living in that kind of dorld and that we can't afford to be<br />
without protection. iut the work that has been done has 1 believe,<br />
beew of a 41nd of whioh every Australian ought to be pro; 1. I<br />
haven't been able to poor through the gloomi, so L'ar and see what<br />
is here but there are one or two things that ' ave loon produced on<br />
this sile of Sup-typ like lHallarra. for examploo ihich have became<br />
quite accepted around the 4orld as showing the way in the<br />
production of a part. oulcr -reapon of war. n. rd the work tMat has<br />
been done at ' doomera has -As you Anow, been dork which has attracted<br />
the attention of the whole world and part'lcularly of the free<br />
-iorld. his kind of thing isaft done except by Lretlendous, talent<br />
and great enthusiasm. doomera is not just a stretch of earth.<br />
People think, pqrhaps, of aiRocket Hang. as being a place<br />
4here, you need to have a great deal of distance in front of you and<br />
some particular means of recoverinig the rocket ihen It comes down*<br />
3Iehind all this ' space' on the etirtll-there is a Lremendous<br />
coawentzation of talent, or tremendous research effort, 0 of<br />
productive activity, Any body who ; ianted to get a now conception of<br />
what ustralia in doing in this field sho-ild take the first<br />
oppirtufity, if he is allowed to br my colleagues the minister,<br />
provided the journey is not boycotted for ainy reason or other of<br />
going,, not only to omers, but to SalisbWr in aiouth wstralfa<br />
and to see thlisproject right from the first elements of resear&amp;<br />
until the final testing of the finished product, It is, 1 1 think,<br />
one of the exciting things In . ustralia* And it hasp already, 0 in<br />
the ease of at least two matters,, demonstrated an Inventive and<br />
original genius In this country, viich marks it out among countries<br />
of the world as being a true home of thoaght, and of talent. It is<br />
a very pod thing Indeed, therefore, that we should all, those of us<br />
who are relatively stricken in years, have a look at dhat is here. </p>
<p>But it Vi, 1 believe, be particularly attractive,<br />
*.. citing, to the minds of younger people those 4ho are interested<br />
in science, those iho are about to go to a Jniversity', or to a<br />
technological institute for the purposes of further scientific<br />
training. They will find here something tremondoual( interesting<br />
because they will see how in this cmplex departmeort of science<br />
the concentration of skil zid of effort have beer, able to lead<br />
the most astanishing results. 1 was happy to remind ; aiself the<br />
other day that the Departiont or Supply ias an elaborate system<br />
for providing for wbat i will call cadet training along these lines.<br />
I do hope that there will be thousands of younger oople who will<br />
come here and have their minds iind imaginations t1mulated, not for<br />
thie purpose of destroying eople in ti world but to pursuo the<br />
search of scientific knowledge and to add I-heir own knovlede to<br />
what we so badly need in tustralla.<br />
Nov what 1 don't knov about science is, of ciurse<br />
consid-rablo. rIan ". ulme has just jeen bold enorgh to say that I<br />
know nothing about science this is competi/ untrie. 1 aa<br />
extremely familiar with the irst law of p1Vsics ' which, if i<br />
remember it correctly is that action and re-action are equal ;, nd<br />
opposite. 10a sure tiis has a ; re. t de31 o . o Aith politics.<br />
klauihter) i's sure it has, I am aiso not at all sure that it<br />
hasnt got a good iil to do with projectin,; a rocket i-Ito 3paOe.<br />
3ut for z who h the easy mastery that i have or the 0irat<br />
prineiple of physics, to be accased of havingj no knowlad, e of<br />
physics is really ar very, very, unkind cut, ( iauhtor)<br />
ArWhow we won't keop you from his. fo. i must peer<br />
throu the Lloon. lou will see these things hanging in the air<br />
don't Kflov whether that is the moon or the sun, or a star. iut<br />
I did read in my notes for this occasion, with great envy, that my<br />
colleague the Kinister for iupply, luis alreadi -onduoted a<br />
oonirersation that was bounced off Le moon. I'l try it at my<br />
nexL fPoA. Icy 3pech it might et over the b-rr.. oade of interjectors,<br />
( Lauzhter) 4ouuldn't that be a mag. ificent idea. % loon and back.<br />
And my opponents would then say exactly ' And thatts just ihat it<br />
sounded like'. tIuahtor)<br />
I have the very greatest pleasure in Jeclaring this<br />
zhibition open* ( Applause) </p>
