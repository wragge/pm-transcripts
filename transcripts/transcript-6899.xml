CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY<br />
EXTRACT FROM REMARKS BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
AUSTRALIAN MINING INDUSTRY COUNCIL DINNER<br />
CANBERRA 1 MAY 1986<br />
Before turning to some matters specific to this industry, I<br />
wish to devote some brief remarks to one or two issues in<br />
the current debate on economic policy generally.<br />
There is no denying that the March quarter CPI, which showed<br />
a rise of 2.3 per cent in the quarter and 9.2 per cent over<br />
the year, came as something of a disappointment to the<br />
Government. But that is not the same as saying that it has<br />
led us to markedly revise our expectations of inflation.<br />
A number of transitory factors were at work in the March<br />
quarter which suggest that the economy is not set on a new<br />
upward trend in inflation. These transitory factors<br />
include a delayed adjustment of motor vehicle prices<br />
following the depreciations of 1985 and an apparent rise in<br />
the average of petrol prices in the quarter, largely due to<br />
the effects of an industrial dispute in Melbourne early in<br />
the quarter.<br />
Most importantly, powerful forces remain at work to pull<br />
down our inflation rate in the period ahead.<br />
The initial inflationary effect of depreciation is likely to<br />
wane over coming quarters.<br />
Moreover, under the terms of the renegotiated Accord, the<br />
Government has argued for a 2 per cent discount from wages<br />
indexation in the national wage case now before the<br />
Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. That discount will<br />
ensure that the higher costs of the imported goods component<br />
of the CPI in 1985 do not become built into our domestic<br />
costs structure. This, in turn, will limit the longer-term<br />
inflationary potential of the depreciation and will thus<br />
help to preserve the substantial improvement in our<br />
competitiveness which has been achieved. </p>
<p>I would add that the payment of the current wage case<br />
decision seems likely to be delayed longer than usual while<br />
the Commission hears a number of related matters.<br />
That in itself will provide an additional, though admittedly<br />
unplanned, circuit breaker. I applaud the union movement<br />
for its restraint while these proceedings are in train and<br />
urge all parties to continue to abide by both the letter and<br />
the intent of our approach to centralised wages fixation.<br />
It is quite mischievous of some commentators who note the<br />
proposed size of the proposed productivity award and add all<br />
of the 3 per cent to their estimate of wages growth in 1986<br />
to generate seemingly horrendous estimates of possible wages<br />
growth. The reality is that, under the terms of the Accord,<br />
payments will be spread over two years, with different<br />
industries paying the award at different times, depending on<br />
their circumstances. In fact the impact on aggregate labour<br />
costs in 1986 is likely to be relatively small.<br />
The timing of these payments is also very much delayed as<br />
compared with the preferred position of the ACTU around the<br />
middle of last year. This delay was agreed to by the ACTU<br />
explicitly so as to provide a further mechanism to absorb<br />
the effects of depreciation without adding to domestic<br />
costs.<br />
As a result the productivity payment is not expected to add<br />
to aggregate inflation over the life of Accord II.<br />
These general downward pressures on inflation will be<br />
reinforced in the period ahead by the lagged impact of lower<br />
petrol prices, which we expect to ratchet inflation down by<br />
more than 1 percentage point over the next year or so.<br />
The Government's decisions on the handling of lower world<br />
crude oil prices strike a balance between the need, on the<br />
one hand, to fund necessary public services while, on the<br />
other, to pass on to consumers to the maximum extent<br />
possible the decline in crude oil prices. The alternative<br />
of a massively larger budget deficit simply could not be<br />
countenanced. All told the Government confidently expects that the annual<br />
inflation rate has peaked in the March quarter and that a<br />
significant fall is in prospect, starting with the current<br />
( June) quarter.*<br />
Taken together with continued firm compliance with<br />
centralised wages fixation these imply that the very<br />
substantial improvement in our competitiveness ( based on<br />
comparative wage movements) can be substantially preserved<br />
over the life of Accord II. </p>
<p>3.<br />
This leads me naturally to another area of contention at<br />
present, namely the pace at which we can expect an<br />
improvement to occur in our balance of payments.<br />
As you know I have just returned from a visit to the United<br />
States and Europe in which I sought to raise the level of<br />
awareness of Australia's position as a non-subsidizing<br />
exporter of agricultural products caught in a notentially<br />
very costly artificial trade war betweeen the USA and the<br />
EEC.<br />
while no one should harbour unrealistic expectations of how<br />
quickly these policies will be changea, I was pleased to see<br />
develop in all capitals : a deeper appreciation of the<br />
large costs imposed on efficient producers such as Australia<br />
of the EEC/ US conflict for world markets; and an undertaking<br />
to do the best that can realistically be done to ensure that<br />
Australian producers are not bloodied in the cross fire.<br />
The latter included specific assurances in some key areas<br />
that the EC and the US will act in a way to ensure that<br />
Australia will be able to preserve its access to traditional<br />
markets and that surplus stocks will not be disposed of in a<br />
way which disrupts markets.<br />
I was also pleased to receive high level support for the<br />
notion that the crisis in world agricultural trade is so<br />
acute that the time has come for discussions on agriculture<br />
to assume a key role in the new round of negotiations about<br />
the rules which govern world trade ( the so called MTN<br />
Round). Because of the sicinificance of rural exports, these<br />
assurances are vital to Australia not just the rural<br />
sector. More generally Australia's balance of payments deficit has<br />
been judged by the world to be unsustainably large. This<br />
was a major factor leading to the large depreciation of the<br />
$ A in 1985, a depreciation which contains within it the<br />
potential progressively to reduce that deficit certainly<br />
as a share of GDP.<br />
As many commentators have'noted our progress in reducing<br />
that deficit to date has been small. But then, as so many<br />
of you here tonight know at first hand, Australia has had a<br />
very large monkey on its back; a monkey in the form of a<br />
deterioration in our terms of trade which was far sharper<br />
than expected; but which by the closing months of 1985 would<br />
have added almost $ 4 billion to our annual current account<br />
deficit. </p>
<p>But even though we've shouldered the monkey, there are<br />
encouraging signs that the necessary improvement in our<br />
current account is underway. In seasonally adjusted terms,<br />
the merchandise trade deficit for the three months ending<br />
March was only a little over half that for the previous<br />
three months. Again allowing for seasonal factors, imports<br />
in March of goods and services most directly sensitive to<br />
the pace of domestic activity and changes in the relative<br />
costs of imports were some 16 per cent below the level of<br />
three months before.<br />
I would expect that more discernible evidence of improvement<br />
will become increasingly apparent as time passes.<br />
Having said that I recognise that minerals exporters face a<br />
particularly difficult trading environment because of excess<br />
supply in many areas. This is an environment which may<br />
become more difficult in the short-term if lower oil prices<br />
impact too heavily on the prices of energy-related<br />
commodities, but which may also be lightened a little in the<br />
medium to longer-term as economic activity worldwide picks<br />
up, including as a consequence of the lower level of oil<br />
prices. Even so it is pleasing to note that, notwithstanding the<br />
difficulties, there have been some encouraging developments<br />
in your industry. For 1example on the latest AMIC data<br />
profits rose by about 3in 1984/ 85 in the non-petroleum<br />
minerals industry; and the latest mining production index<br />
shows record production levels for the December quarter,<br />
with substantial gains in 1985 for coal, zinc, gold and<br />
diamonds. Before I leave this topic I would add that, in my<br />
discussions abroad, I found considerable support for the<br />
notion that world growth can be maximized at present by<br />
greater co-ordination of the economic policies of national<br />
Governments. It was particularly noted that responsibly expansionary<br />
policies in countries blessed with both low inflation and a<br />
favourable balance of payments would hasten the process of,<br />
external adjustment of countries in balance of payments<br />
deficit, and thus could contribute to a more stable<br />
international trading environment. In my discussions I<br />
indicated the support of the Australian Government for<br />
co-ordinated action of this kind.<br />
GENERAL POLICY APPROACH<br />
The expected progressive improvement in our net sales of<br />
goods and services abroad over the course of 1986-87 is<br />
expected to provide a significant stimulus to domestic<br />
employment and activity in that year. </p>
<p>The task of general economic policy will be to both permit<br />
and support that development by ensuring appropriate<br />
moderation in the pace of domestic demand, after the<br />
frenetic pace of 1.985.<br />
The upshot is that we continue to expect respectable growth<br />
of non-farm GDP in 1986-87, though somewhat lower than the<br />
average of more than in our first three years.<br />
Fiscal restraint aga. n will be required in 1986/ 87 to ease<br />
the public sector's call on domestic savings and to directly<br />
assist the adjustment of our external accounts. Our<br />
objective is to bring in a deficit below the level required<br />
by the trilogy.<br />
Indeed the intention is to conduct fiscal policy in a way<br />
which will also permit an easing of monetary policy, so as<br />
to enable Australian interest rates to decline at least in<br />
line with world trends and thus to support as high a level<br />
of business investment as possible.<br />
Of course the Accord will remain the centre piece of policy.<br />
The Accord has produced not only realistic outcomes for<br />
wages but also a startling improvement in the levels of<br />
industrial disputation. </p>
