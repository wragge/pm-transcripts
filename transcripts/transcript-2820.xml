PRIME MINISTER TN INDONESIA<br />
Following is the text of an address by the Prime<br />
Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Whitlam, at a<br />
State banquet given by the Government of Indonesia in Jakarta<br />
tonight, Tuesday, 20 February:-<br />
" I regard this occasion as a narticularly hapry omeifor<br />
me and my Government. It is one that brings me a special<br />
personal satisfaction. T1his is my eighth visit to Indonesia,<br />
and my first as Prime Minister of Australia. Apart from a<br />
brief visit to New Zealand, this is my first visit as Prime<br />
Mini'ster to an independent neighbourinE country.<br />
This is not by chance. Relations between Australia<br />
and Indonesia have always been cordial and strong. It is my<br />
Government's intention that they will become stronger still.<br />
I stressed this during the recent elections. The Australian<br />
people have endorsed the objective. Individually there is much<br />
our tw. o countries can achieve for the welfare of our region.<br />
There is even more that we can achieve together. </p>
<p>-2-<br />
In visiting Indonesia I am most pleased by the<br />
opportunity to renew personal contact with President Soeharto.<br />
I attach great importance to establishing relations of mutual<br />
confidence with him. I deeply admire his qualities of leadership<br />
which combine dignity and realism with great positive<br />
achievements. Under President Soeharto Indonesia's course<br />
has steadied and become firm. This is a source of great hope<br />
and encouragement to Australia.<br />
What, Mr President, lies at the basis of this confident<br />
relationship that we have? We can hardly be more different in<br />
history, in size, both of population and area, in cinlture, in<br />
language and in origin. It is, of course, a curious thought<br />
that, had the trade winds not blown so persistently from the<br />
south east, Australia could well have been, indeed almost<br />
certainly would have been, a continent populated by Malays.<br />
It nearly happened. There is much evidence of Javanese interest<br />
in an abortive settlement in the north west of Australia.<br />
We do not have a commonly shared colonial history. We<br />
in Australia are a transplant. We are the descendants of the<br />
colonial authority. In all too sad a sense we are the colonizers,<br />
and my Government, Mr President, will strive mightily to right<br />
the wrongs that have-been done to the original Australians. 3 </p>
<p>Of course, there is some recent history from 1945 on<br />
which has contributed to our friendly relations. There are<br />
national and neighbourly ties in security, in trade, and in<br />
the contacts of proximity. Wc perceive that each of us is<br />
really very important to the other. Others have come to the<br />
area and have gone, or are going home. We are both going to<br />
stay here. Our future is intertwined forever. And, for all<br />
our differences, we share, I believe, tolerance, humour,<br />
friendliness, reasonable modesty and an unshakeable belief<br />
in the brightness of our destiny.<br />
I believe that Australia and Indonesia and let it be<br />
said, Papua New Guinea as well are necessarily involved in<br />
one another's destinies. This has already been so. No countries<br />
in the region have a firmer foundation of trust and co-operation<br />
on which to build.<br />
SAustralia was one of the first countries to support<br />
Indonesia's struggle for independence in the postwar years.<br />
The Australian Labor Party and the Australian trade union<br />
movement actively encouraged your independence movement, both<br />
bilaterally and in the international sphere. The United Nations,<br />
through a Good Offices Committee on which Australia was the<br />
Indonesian nominee, played a mediatory role in the peace<br />
settlement which led eventually to the transfer of sovereignty tc<br />
an Indonesian Government representing the Indonesian people.<br />
That link is symbolised tonight by the nresence of the Honorable<br />
Sir Richard Kirby, the President of our Conciliation and </p>
<p>-4-<br />
Arbitration Commission, who, as His Honour Judge Kirby, was the<br />
Australian Representative on the Good Offices Committee, and<br />
whose'affection and regard for your country has continued<br />
undiminished. In the difficult days of confrontation there were<br />
enough people of wisdom in both countries to keep up the bridges<br />
of friendship. Today, Australia and Indonesia remain steadfast<br />
supporters of the United Nations, of which Indonesia became<br />
the 60th member in 1950 when her struggle for national independence<br />
was won. I am sure it is an auspicious sign that Indonesia and<br />
Australia will be working together in partnership especially<br />
during the coming two years as members of the United Nations<br />
Security Council. We welcome the great progress you have made since the<br />
difficult days of 1965. We admire the efforts your country has<br />
made to strengthen the security and Drosperity of our region.<br />
Your concern for the welfare of the region has been shown by<br />
your active suopport for ASEAN and your sponsorship of the Asian<br />
Conference on Cambodia in 1970. We respect your free and active<br />
foreign policy, and your reluctance to become involved in<br />
obsolescent military alliances.<br />
Cultural links, too, are of growing importance in the<br />
relations between our countries. We are proud that Australian<br />
universities are currently training more than 200 Indonesian<br />
post-graduate students selected by your Government. I take<br />
this opportunity to announce that Australia will contribute </p>
<p>$ A200, OOO over five years to the UITE? C Fund for the Restoration<br />
of the Temple of Borobudur.<br />
I want now to explain to you the broad principles and<br />
ideals that will sustain and guide my Government's international<br />
relations. Let this be known to all:<br />
With a new Government there will be a new emphasis<br />
in Australian foreign policy of profound importance. I want<br />
this nev! emn'hasis to be clear and unmistakable amonp, the nations<br />
of our region, particularly here in Indonesia, where we attach<br />
such importance to the warmth and cordiality of our relationship.<br />
You may know that foreign nolicy decisions were among the very<br />
first initiatives undertaken by our Government during its first<br />
days of office. The aim of these decisions, as with all future<br />
decisions, is to establish a re-nutation for Australia as a<br />
natinn with an independent and distinctive foreign policy. We<br />
want to be regarded as a friendly, tolerant and co-onerative<br />
neighbour and at no time open to any suggestion of racism.<br />
Let me be more snecific about Australia's intentions<br />
in this region. We believe the oeaceful progress and development<br />
of South-East Asia will-be more speedily achieved if the region<br />
is insulated from great -power rivalries. We support the ASEAN<br />
concept of a zone of peace, freedom and neutrality in South-<br />
East Asia. While we support the concept and will encourage all<br />
nations involved in our region to support it, we also acknowledge<br />
our existing obligations to our friends.<br />
We have declared our willingness, should Indonesia ./ 6 </p>
<p>-6-<br />
so desire, to make arrangements with your Government and<br />
equally with an independent Papua New Guinea to provide<br />
assistance in the training of forces, and in technical facilities<br />
and the supply of equipment. We seek no binding treaty or formal<br />
alliance, merely an understanding based on mutual trust and<br />
friendshipo. We will be charting a new course in our foreign<br />
policy, with less emphasis on the kind of military pact that is<br />
no longer relevant to the realities of the<br />
The keystone of our foreign policy for the 70s will<br />
be the search for regional co-operation. In this we look first<br />
and foremost to our great neighbour and firm friend, Indonesia.<br />
We will be discussing with Indonesia and all our friends in the<br />
region the possibility of new forms of co-operation to complement<br />
existing arrangements like A13EAN which we regard as a model of<br />
regional co-operation. We see regional co-operation as offering<br />
the best hope for peace and progress in our part of the globe.<br />
Working together, in understanding and mutual trust, there is<br />
much we can do to enhance the living standards of all our<br />
neighbours and to mitigate the ancient scourges of poverty,<br />
ignorance and disease.<br />
This is our paramount task. We are impressed by what<br />
your Government has already done, through its policies, and through<br />
the national philosophy of Pancasila, to achieve progress for<br />
your people and political and economic stability. We pledge our<br />
continuing encouragement and support for a new form of regional<br />
co-operation that will speed your progress and bring nearer the<br />
fulfilment of your goals. 7 </p>
<p>-7-<br />
The future peace and progress of South-East Asia will depend<br />
largely on how quickly and successfully these goals are achieved.<br />
This region, I believe, is entering a new and more<br />
hopeful era. There are three principal reasons for my<br />
optimism. The first is the ceasefire in Viet-Nam, which has<br />
brought to an end 20 years of bloodshed, suffering and turmoil.<br />
My second reason for optimism is in the Drogress which<br />
Indonesia herself has made under your guidance, Mr President<br />
to achieve peace and development, and to restore fully the<br />
principles of-harmony and justice, democracy and freedom embodied<br />
in your Constitution of 1945. A just and prosperous Indonesia is<br />
an essential condition of a just and prosperous South-East Asia.<br />
We in Australia have looked to you to set an example to our<br />
neighbourhood of progress and social transformation. In this,<br />
our expectations have not been disappointed. I am confident<br />
that Indonesia's progressive development will continue.<br />
The third reason for my optimism if T may be bold<br />
enough to say is the election of a new Government in Australia<br />
committed to close regional co-operation and determined in every<br />
way to promote the peace and welfare of our neighbours, We hope<br />
to gain increasing standing in the eyes of Indonesia and our<br />
other friends as an independent, tolerant and helpful neighboulr.<br />
There are still vast problems beforf us all, but also vast<br />
opportunities. It is my earnest hope that, working together,<br />
we can do much to advance the prosperity and happniness of all<br />
our peoples. </p>
