PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 24 APRIL 1984<br />
The Gallipoli Legion of ANZACS of Australia recently wrote<br />
to me asking that the Australian Government approach the<br />
Turkish Authorities in an effort to have that part of the<br />
Gallipoli Peninsula where the ANZAC landing took place<br />
69 years ago formally renamed Anzac Cove.<br />
The Legion has also suggested that some part of Australia<br />
be named to commemorate the bravery of the Turkish soldiers<br />
who took part in those bloody battles.<br />
I believe that there is a great deal of merit in the suggestions<br />
and I have asked Bill Hayden to arrange for the Australian<br />
Embassy in Ankara to make representations to the Turkish<br />
Government indicating Australia's full support for the proposal.<br />
If this proposal were accepted the bravery of the two armies<br />
who fought so vigorously nearly 70 years ago would be commemorated<br />
in an appropriate and enduring way. It would keep alive for<br />
future generations of Australians and Turks alike the memory<br />
of acts of heroism and self sacrifice that distinguished<br />
both the ANZACS and Turkish participants in the campaign. </p>
