<p>The Gallipoli Legion of ANZACS of Australia recently wrote to me asking that the Australian Government approach the Turkish Authorities in an effort to have that part of the Gallipoli Peninsula where the ANZAC landing took place 69 years ago formally renamed Anzac Cove.</p>
<p>The Legion has also suggested that some part of Australia be named to commemorate the bravery of the Turkish soldiers who took part in those bloody battles.</p>
<p>I believe that there is a great deal of merit in the suggestions and I have asked Bill Hayden to arrange for the Australian Embassy in Ankara to make representations to the Turkish Government indicating Australia's full support for the proposal.</p>
<p>If this proposal were accepted the bravery of the two armies who fought so vigorously nearly 70 years ago would be commemorated in an appropriate and enduring way. It would keep alive for future generations of Australians and Turks alike the memory of acts of heroism and self sacrifice that distinguished both the ANZACS and Turkish participants in the campaign.</p>
