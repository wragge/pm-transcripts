    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Prime Minister, Mr. Holt, has received the following message from President Johnson:-</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">" A quarter century ago I found out that if you had to be away from home and fighting a war, the best country to be in is Australia. I hear that the first group of our servicemen to come to you from Viet Nam has arrived at the same conclusion.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">I know the  thought and care and warmth that went into the arrangements made for our men.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">I thank you, and through you, the people of Australia for what you are doing.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Sincerely,<br />LYNDON B JOHNSON "</p>
<p>Mr. Holt, in welcoming the message today, said: "It is good to learn that the U. S. servicemen coming here for R. and R. have formed such a favourable impression of Australia."</p>
<p>13 October 1967</p>
