    <content><![CDATA[<p>I am pleased to announce the first round of grants for the Greater Western Sydney region under the National Community Crime Prevention Programme (NCCPP).</p>
<p>The successful projects will assist the community of Greater Western Sydney to directly address crime and the fear of crime in their local area.</p>
<p>Under the Greater Western Sydney region component of the NCCPP, the Australian Government has provided $8 million over 4 years towards strengthening grassroots initiatives to assist in the prevention of crime in the region.</p>
<p>This $8 million in funding is in addition to the $50 million committed by the Australian Government to the National Community Crime Prevention Programme, a community grants scheme that provides funding for crime prevention projects that demonstrate strong community partnerships, target priority areas and provide ongoing benefit to the community.</p>
<p>  The round attracted strong interest from the Greater Western Sydney region with 78 applications.  All applications were carefully considered by the Advisory Group for the Greater Western Sydney region component involving local community representatives and chaired by Mr Tim Priest.</p>
<p>Eight worthy projects have been selected by my colleague, Senator the Hon. Chris Ellison, Minister for Justice and Customs, taking into account the Advisory Group's recommendations.</p>
<p>  The successful programmes cover a diverse range of community activity. All are excellent examples of the Western Sydney community taking action to fight the causes of crime and fear of crime in their own neighbourhoods.</p>
<p>  A new round of grants for National and Greater Western Sydney will be advertised in late August 2005.</p>
<p>More information on the NCCPP and how to apply for grants is available on the website, <a href="http://www.crimeprevention.gov.au">www.crimeprevention.gov.au</a>.</p>
