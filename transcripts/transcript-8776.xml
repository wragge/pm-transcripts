PRIME MINISTER 148/ 92<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING, MP<br />
OATH OF ALLEGIANCE<br />
The Government has decided today that the time has come to amend the Citizenship Act<br />
and the Oath of Allegiance.<br />
The Government has proposed to introduce, at the earliest opportunity, a new preamble to<br />
the Citizenship Act which defincs citizenship as a. common bond involving reciprocal<br />
rights and obligations uniting all Australians.<br />
The Legislation proposes that, in future, people seeking to become Australian citizens will<br />
pledge, or swear as an oath, the following:<br />
" From this time forward, ( under God)<br />
I pledge my loyalty to Australia and its people,<br />
whose democratic beliefs I share,<br />
whose rights and liberties I rcspcct, and<br />
whose laws I will uphold and obey."<br />
Cabinet has agreed that the amended Citizenship Act and Oath of Allegiance will better<br />
reflect the contcmporary reality of Australia and our national aspirations.<br />
