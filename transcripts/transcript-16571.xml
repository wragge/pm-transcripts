    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Rudd Government today welcomed the announcement of $16.15 million in new training facilities at Central Gippsland Institute of TAFE (GippsTAFE).</p>
<p>The Government is pleased to announce today that these new training facilities will be used to help train workers to build the $43 billion National Broadband Network.</p>
<p>This means GippsTAFE will supply some of the on average, 25,000 jobs each year it will take to construct a National Broadband Network over the next 8 years.</p>
<p>Today's $16.15 million announcement will mean GippsTAFE can:</p>
<p>     * Upgrade its existing telecommunications, gas and electricity training yard </p>
<p>     * The training yard allows trainees to learn how to lay underground and overhead telecommunications cable.</p>
<p>     * Build three new state of the art technology training classrooms; and</p>
<p>     * Construct a new fibre optic training room.</p>
<p>Today's announcement is one of the 31 projects funded in this year's budget as part of the $934 million round two funding from the Education Investment Fund.</p>
<p>GippsTAFE will become one of a series of technical colleges across the country with the specialist facilities to provide training for NBN workers.</p>
<p>The specialist training facilities at GippsTAFE's Chadstone campus will enable jobseekers to gain the competencies required to participate in the construction of the biggest nation-building project in Australian history.</p>
<p>This project will establish a world-class 21st century training and education facility in an area of identified skills need.</p>
<p>GippsTAFE is one of few specialist telecommunications and energy sector training facilities.</p>
<p>GippsTAFE is also investing a further $3 million towards this project.</p>
<p>The Education Investment Fund will transform our tertiary campuses into 21st century environments that will not only play a key role in delivering a sustainable future through teaching and research but also act as demonstration sites for new and emerging technologies and enable them to be tested at scale.</p>
<p>The GippsTAFE project at its Chadstone Campus will advance the Government's priority of creating a world-leading tertiary education sector in Australia. In addition, this investment will stimulate economic activity in the short term and expand growth potential in the medium-to-long-term.</p>
<p>The Government has also announced a nominal allocation of $500 million for EIF Round 3, which will include around $200 million for projects to help universities.</p>
<p>In some cases this will be facilitated through partnerships with vocational education and training (VET) providers to adjust to the new directions in higher education announced in the Budget.</p>
<p>In addition the Government will also undertake a special $650 million Sustainability Round of the Education Investment Fund in 2009.</p>
<p>The funding for vocational education and training providers and higher education and research institutions is an opportunity to give immediate practical effect to sustainable design, energy and research. </p>
