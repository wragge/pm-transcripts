STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING, MP<br />
SOUTH PACIFIC FORUM<br />
I shall attend the 23rd South Pacific Forum in Honiara<br />
from 8 to 9 July, leaving Australia on 7 July and<br />
returning on 10 July. The Minister for Foreign Affairs<br />
and Trade, Senator Gareth Evans, will represent me at the<br />
South Pacific Forum Leaders' Retreat on 6 July and at<br />
Solomon Islands Independence Day celebrations on 7 July.<br />
The Forum provides an opportunity for the countries of<br />
the South Pacific to discuss regional cooperation on a<br />
wide range of important issues, including economic<br />
development, the environment and regional security. I<br />
look forward to the opportunity to discuss these matters<br />
with my regional colleagues.<br />
In addition to the formal proceedings of the Forum, I<br />
expect to have bilateral meetings with the Prime<br />
Ministers of Solomon Islands, New Zealand and Fiji.<br />
