REGIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE 4' ORLD HEALTH ORGANISATION<br />
HELD IN NEd GUINEA<br />
Oi 5TH SEPTEMBER. 1963<br />
Speech by the Prime Minister. the Rt. Hon. Sir Robert Menzies<br />
Sir Distinguished Representatives of your various Countries,<br />
Ladies and Gentlemen My colleague, Senator Wade, rather glorifies me<br />
this morning. He attributes my presence entirely to virtue on<br />
my part. I would like to tell you that the last time I was<br />
here though not in this building they did their best to kill<br />
me. ? Laughter) They cooked me, they cooked me, they cooked me,<br />
they ran me around and I agreed to come this time on strict<br />
condition that the weather would be better. ( Laughter) And<br />
so it is. So it is not only a matter of pure virtue but of<br />
personal comfort. Sir, the Constitution of the World Health Organisation<br />
not only contains those splendid words that were quoted by<br />
my colleague, but they also contain a definition of health, and<br />
SI read this with great interest. They describe " health" as a<br />
W state of complete mental, physical and social well-being and not<br />
merely the absence of disease or infirmity. I think most of us<br />
must be rather unhealthy. " A state of complete mental, physical<br />
and social well-being" Well, give those words an extensive<br />
interpretation and they will cover almost all of the material<br />
problems of mankind today and therefore they would tend to defeat<br />
themselves. But what I like about the work of the W. H. 0 is that<br />
it has not lost itself in generalisation it has rather concentrated<br />
its mind upon the proposition that health in the nations<br />
and among the people does not represent merely the absence of<br />
* disease but includes these great activities to which my colleague<br />
has referred. In brief, the World Health Organisation has not<br />
been just academic in its approach to problems. On every occasion,<br />
it has sought to give a practical application to the work of<br />
medical scientists and discoverers and to give that practical<br />
application in particular places for particular purposes.<br />
I was informed before I came', here that 100 health<br />
projects had been'assisted by the World Health Organisation in<br />
the Western Pacific 100 different and specific projects.<br />
N6w', Sir, having said that to indicate that I do understand the<br />
essentially practical purposes that you have, I perhaps ought to<br />
remind those of us who are not medical men that it is a'pretty<br />
modern idea that public health problems are capable of solution,<br />
I don't think that people troubled much about public health<br />
problems, as we understand them, a couple of centuries ago. In<br />
Great Britain the eighteenth century has become known as the<br />
century of good taste, and indeed it was in many ways, but it<br />
must have produced mrany bad tastes in its fashion. because public<br />
health, as we understand it, was entirely unknown and indeed the<br />
practice of medicine in any of its forms was extraordinarily<br />
primitive. Indeed, one has only to go back to the middle of the<br />
nineteenth century a period which'was well remembered by people<br />
like my own parents, so that we are not so far removed from the<br />
middle of the nineteenth century. Up to that time when the Red<br />
Cross was created, when the great figure and genius of Florence<br />
Nightingale became known nursing as we understand it, treatment<br />
of the wounded, as we understand it, was . almost entirely unknown.<br />
For the most'part in the dreadful occurrences of war, the wounded<br />
were left to die; casualties which turned out to be fatal </p>
<p>2<br />
casualties were enormous compared to what they would be under<br />
similar circumstances today. And it was a good long time after<br />
that before it was realised by the hard economic elements in the<br />
community that disease is economically wasteful, that no country<br />
can afford to have any disease which skill and effort can avert.,<br />
that economically this wastage of the economic contribution made<br />
by the individual is not to be tolerated. That is a very modern<br />
idea, And so we have entered what we are pleased to believe<br />
to be the modern and enlightened era of which the World Health<br />
Organisation is a manifestation, with 115 members and a record of'L<br />
immense vigour and practical quality. But Sir, the health work<br />
of the modern world and the health work of the WJ. H. O. can't be<br />
done in a vacuum, they can't be done extra-territorially. What we<br />
all need to do, what you have shown you understand you must do, is<br />
to get down to cases, not to be too abstract, not to regard any<br />
problem as being capable of being solved in an office or a lab.<br />
somewhere else in the world.<br />
And, therefore, as I understand the W* H its main<br />
function is to stimulate activity in specific areas and to a great<br />
extent in relation to specific diseases of great endemic or<br />
epidemic proportions. Your topic for this Conference is an<br />
illustration of this fact, and when you have a conference you are<br />
not merely engaging in a series of abstract remarks, you are<br />
concentrating your attention on a particular problem and pooling<br />
experience and skill7as it turns out here, from thirteen or fourteen<br />
different countries. Now Sir, you happen to be in Australian territory and<br />
I happen to be by the grace of the electors of Australia, though<br />
only narrowly ILau ghter), the Prime Minister. Now, in these<br />
Territories Papua and New G uinea we in Australia have accepted<br />
great responsibilities responsibilities much too great to be cast<br />
off our shoulders lighZ-heartedly or in a spirit of pure theory.<br />
We have immense responsibilities in these Territories and vie<br />
propose, of course, to discharge them. W4e look forward to the<br />
time when these Territories, the people of these Territories will<br />
be completely politically and economically independent, when they<br />
will be a living vital country controlling their own destiny. : This<br />
is the great objective of intelligent people in the twentieth<br />
century. But in the meantime, we, the Government of Australia<br />
have tremendous responsibilities and we will carry them forwarA to<br />
a conclusion, not slowly, not in a wild hurry, always with the<br />
understanding that the paramount consideration is the welfare of<br />
the people of the Territories and not a mere desire to satisfy<br />
somebody else, Now this is a health organisation conference and<br />
therefore I should tell you that in the pursuit of this duty to<br />
which I have referred, the Administration, while very far from<br />
satisfied none of us can afford to be satisfied; if you were<br />
satisfied about the state of health in the world, you wouldn't<br />
be here; this is something about which you will never get<br />
satisfaction and therefore the Administration is not satisfied,<br />
but I venture to say that it can be very properly proud of what<br />
has been done, remembering always that these Territories embrace<br />
hundreds of different types of peoples, literally hundreds of<br />
different languages, stages of civilisation or of uncivilisation<br />
which-are perhaps not to be found very easily in any other part of<br />
the world, ranging from what you see around you in Port Moresby<br />
to what we naight see if we had the time and took the trouble and<br />
had the endurance to go into some of the maore remote parts of<br />
Papua and New Guinea. This is a tremendously difficult place and<br />
soooe.. 0/ 3 </p>
<p>3-<br />
yet, I repeat, the Administration may be very proud of what has<br />
been done. So far as we have been able to discover, there was<br />
simply no evidence of any established medical system in this great<br />
tract of country until European settlement first occurred. The<br />
indigenous inhabitants, as was not uncommon perhaps at that stage<br />
in the world's history, believed that disease was a product of<br />
somae mysterious force, perhaps a sorcerer, perhaps some form of<br />
witchcraft. There were rather obscure, almost instinctive and<br />
superstitious ideas about how illness came about and how it ought<br />
to be dealt with, In other words there was a state of affairs<br />
here only a decade three, four decades ago, five decades ago<br />
whic&amp; strongly resembled the state of affairs which existed in a<br />
great number of our countries hundreds and hundreds of years ago,<br />
so that the task was a difficult one and had to be concentrated<br />
into a fairly short period of time.<br />
Well, by 1923 that's only forty years ago there<br />
were in these Territories 14 hospitals and 13 medical officers.<br />
No great matter was it? Fourteen hospitals, 13 medical officers<br />
represented an enormous improvement on what had been but it was<br />
still no great matter. Then the progress that followed was<br />
interrupted by war because this country saw war and saw it in a<br />
destructive form. Itve been reminded that the war destroyed every<br />
hospital except those at Port Moresby and at Samarai. Here is a<br />
splendid example, if that is the right word to choose of the<br />
destruction that war can bring about. Only two hospitals left<br />
standing. But of course the war also, by the strange irony of<br />
fate or the not-always-unaerstood wisdom of Providence, brought<br />
great advances in medicine with the anti-malarials and the<br />
insecticides and the anti-biotics and the vaccines. I suppose that<br />
two of the remarkable effects of the war were that in medical<br />
science the discovery of how to fight disease was accelerated<br />
beyond words while, at the same time, in the world of the physicist,<br />
we saw results following upon the splitting of the atom which have,<br />
up to now, rather increased the apprehensions of mankind but may,<br />
in due course, properly understood, add enormously to its resources.<br />
So there was a plus; there was a minus.<br />
Well, Sir when the war was over the Administration<br />
resaunmddh as p ese on with increasing activity ever since.<br />
Great territory-wide campaigns by 195? were being waged against<br />
yaws, against against malaria, leprosy there was an<br />
increasing medical examination of schoolchildren and, after all,<br />
it isntt so long since there were hardly any schoolchildren because<br />
there were hardly any schools. This has been a tremendous<br />
development that I dontt take time to speak of this morning but<br />
there has been, over this period, an increasing medical examination<br />
of schoolchildren and a dental health service,<br />
In 1962/ 63 the last financial year, there was an<br />
extensive procurement ol vaccine against what? Very interesting<br />
to recall the diseases that were being attacked. Against<br />
tetanus, against whooping-cough, which in some of our countries<br />
is regarded sometimes as a sort of juvenile eccentricity, regarded<br />
with indifference by husbands and causing immense trouble for<br />
wives, but still, whooping cough in a country not so well developed<br />
can be a dread disease, and it was attacked. . Diphtheria,<br />
poliomyelitis, smallpox, cholera, T. B all these things being<br />
attacked by the procurement and use of vaccines with tremendous<br />
personal work being done by regular health patrols and, of course,<br />
by the improvement of nutrition,<br />
I said then " by regular health patrols". If you look<br />
at the relief map out in the foyer outside, somewhat exaggerated<br />
0 00 60 00/ </p>
<p>-4-<br />
no dou'st for purposes of demonstration, you will realise that<br />
this is, in many respects a tremendously mountainous country<br />
with here and there a roe d, with here and there a track, but f'or<br />
the most part presenting the most tremendous difficulties of<br />
access, Therefore, perhaps, cmabling more and more small<br />
communities in small valleys or in remote corners to be suffering<br />
from some disease, to be almost extinguishing themselves without<br />
access from the people who might be able to help them. And if<br />
anybody ought to go down in history here with immense fame, it<br />
is the people who have gone out on patrol, who have put up with<br />
all these hardships, who have reached these inaccessible places<br />
in order to bring medical health and apply medical resources to<br />
the needs of the country. That goes indeed in Papua and New<br />
Guinea for almost all the activities of administration, We are<br />
living in an age in which, to bring the ordinary instruments of<br />
peace and progress and benefit to people, requires immaense<br />
personal courage on the part of hundreds and hundreds of young<br />
men out on the trail.<br />
Now, Sir, I hesitate to speak about money because<br />
I find that sums of money that I think are quite big are regarded<br />
by my opponents as trivial. But I think that I should say that<br />
health services as you all know, are costly. Indeed, it is<br />
because you realise that that you have these regular meetings in<br />
order to produce more and more efficacy in the treatment of<br />
disease, because the more efficient, then the more justified is<br />
the expenditure of money. Now, since 1953, that's ten years ago,<br />
the health services in these countries have cost us œ C33M. I had<br />
forgotten to add up the figures. All I remembered in a hazy way<br />
was that my colleague and friend, Mr. Hasluck who is the Minister<br />
for Territories in my Government has a very Leguiling way of<br />
getting more money for the Territories than the rest of us at<br />
first thought proper and, looking back on it, there it is œ P33M.<br />
In the last financial year which closed only the other day,<br />
on health services that amounts to 501-per head of the population,<br />
and to all that you must add in these Territories, the<br />
immense work, the devoted skilled work of mission medical workers,<br />
. So that you will see, just at a glance, that what<br />
has been done here has really been done generously, enthusiastically,<br />
and of course, when I say that, I am the first one to realise that<br />
what looks like a big figure this year will look like a fairly<br />
small and comfortable one before we are another five years older,<br />
If you add together the work of the Administration<br />
here and the work of the missions and this is the last fact<br />
I want to put before you if you add those two together, and<br />
you have in mind that after this last war there were two hospitals<br />
loft standing a mere handful of medical people immediately<br />
available, and then listen when I tell you that in June of this<br />
year there were 100 Government hospitals 100 and a very large<br />
number which I don't have by me of mission hospitals, there were<br />
5' 28 maternity and child welfare centres, there were 1 693 aid<br />
posts or medical centres 1,693 there were 148 doc~ ors and<br />
there were 41., 400 other medical personnel all this on June<br />
1963 and you will see that you have come here representing all<br />
your talent, devotion, experience to a country which affords a<br />
splendid example of an Administration with the co-operation of<br />
the people, going forward along the lines that you have been so<br />
much concerned with, bringing to the people a new chance of<br />
prolonged life, higher medical standards, better living, a better<br />
future, taking them out of the primitive and superstitious a 0 0 0 </p>
<p>5<br />
darkness before the medical era and giving them the benefit<br />
of the best that the world can provide. This in other<br />
words, is a great experimental area in the world and I am<br />
delighted that you should have come here in order to bring<br />
your minds together on a disease well known in these<br />
Territories so that the sum of knowledge may be added to,<br />
so that the enthusiasm of those on the spot here will be<br />
refreshed, so that our determination to go forward may be<br />
made stronger and it is in that spirit and having in mind<br />
all these things that I welcome you on behalf of the Government<br />
of Australia and I have pleasure in declaring your Conference<br />
open. I </p>
