HOST: Prime Minister, good evening. Thank you for your time. You say people of the west should not be regarded as second rate. Who says that they actually are?</p>
<p>PM: I was referring to a community's need for recognition and respect.</p>
<p>Sydney's west is a fantastic place. I've had a great day here today and I've had the opportunity to meet people who are doing things like caring for their fellow Australians with disabilities.</p>
<p>I've seen people in local sporting groups. I've had the opportunity to meet with the local councillors. Greater Western Sydney is a place of incredible strength.</p>
<p>And as a Government, we want to work with western Sydney to help today and to build a stronger future tomorrow, which is why of course I have announced that we would invest in an infrastructure project which got people to the city and freight to the port.</p>
<p>HOST: Prime Minister, there are people tonight that can't even put food in their fridge in Sydney's west. They can't do that.</p>
<p>Do you realise it's as bleak as that and you talk about the investment, the potential investment in roads, but what about helping them put food on the table?</p>
<p>PM: We've been working with people here in western Sydney and around the country to alleviate cost of living pressures.</p>
<p>I understand it can be really tough, which is why we have the School Kids Bonus to help with the costs of getting the kids to school; the shoes on the feet, the uniform thank you need to buy, the books, the pens, the paper.</p>
<p>We've also got the tax cut, meaning you don't pay any tax until you've earned more than $18,200.</p>
<p>That matters here in Sydney's west to more than half a million people and it matters right around the country.</p>
<p>Unfortunately these things are in contest at the next election.</p>
<p>We're saying that they should definitely stay because they help people manage cost of living pressures.</p>
<p>HOST: Well PM, I think they want more from you. Thank you for your time.</p>
<p>PM: And I will be here, happy to keep talking to people out here in western Sydney. I've very much enjoyed today.</p>
