TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING MP<br />
DOORSTOP, BASS HILL, SYDNEY, I SEPTEMBER 1995<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
J: Prime Minister, is the federal party moving away from NSW Labor over<br />
its broken promises in the run up to the federal election?<br />
PM: I think the public of NSW, like the public of most States, know what is a<br />
federal issue and what is a state issue. These issues here of notoriety<br />
toliways are a state issue and, I think, that they understand that.<br />
J: As a member of Western Sydney, are you disappointed at this<br />
particular action taken by the Carr government?<br />
PM: I think that promises of this variety governments and oppositions<br />
need to know if they can be Implemented. Now, all new governments,<br />
I suppose, as scales fall from their eyes when they arrive, but it does<br />
get people's hopes up and then it dashes them and, I think, this is a<br />
great pity because one needs the moral strength of public life, of<br />
commitments from the public to keep the whole thing going. That is, in<br />
a democracy we draw our strength from the public and from the public<br />
only. So, keeping the public's belief in the integrity of the system is<br />
important.<br />
J: Is the government bowing to union pressure by putting off the sale of<br />
ANL for two months?<br />
_ PM: No, It Is just that It is a very large change. We are seeking to sell ANL<br />
to P&amp; O. P&amp; O has extensive interests on the waterfront as well as at<br />
sea and It gives the unions and the government a chance and P&amp; O<br />
together the three of us to map out a course for the future including<br />
for ANL which we can't do with a quick document over lunch. So, I<br />
think, it Is like a policy due diligence and it Is a good thing that it is<br />
happening this way. It is a very good thing for the waterfront, a very<br />
good thing for ANL, for the seaman, a good result for employment of<br />
Australian people at sea. I had a conversation with Lord Stirling<br />
yesterday from P&amp; O where he was talking about training more officers<br />
and engineers in Australia to serve, not just on ANIL vessels, but on<br />
1 1 I1 N o . C C 4 F 0 </p>
<p>TEL 2<br />
the 240 odd other P&amp; O vessels around the world, or some of them.<br />
And also, training ratings who serve at sea, perhaps up to petty officer<br />
standard so that they can get higher incomes and do more interesting<br />
work. So, I think, it is going to be a pretty good outcome.<br />
J: Prime Minister, Richard Court says it is disgusting that you have<br />
attacked the judge in such an open and blatant personal way. Is he<br />
right?<br />
PM: He is not a judge, he is a commissioner set up under Richard Court's<br />
government.<br />
J: It is a legally constituted royal Commission, Prime Minister.<br />
PM; What it is is Richard Court believing that governments have authority<br />
even if they abuse the authority. Governments do have authority, but<br />
again, authority comes with the respect only of the community and<br />
when governments poison the authority as Richard Court has now<br />
poisoned the royal commission's power, for everybody, then he can<br />
expect nothing more than this sort of general criticism of the<br />
motivations by him of establishing or seeking to use the royal<br />
commission's power in this way.<br />
J: What about the legitimacy of the royal commission, do you think that<br />
your comments may have reduced that?<br />
PM: Well, it is very obvious here, the Royal Commissioner has himself said<br />
that there is no crIme here, there are no misdemeanours here. The<br />
royal commission was set up with political motives in mind. It is now<br />
turning sour on Richard Court because mostly, nearly always, every<br />
political stunt reacts against the people who establish them or do them<br />
and that Is what he is now living with.<br />
J On the Mabo legislation, why are you moving towards this<br />
amendment?<br />
PM. Simply because the High Court has made some decisions about<br />
procedural process. That is, that the Native Title Tribunal has to be<br />
the agent of the federal court and not to be seen to be usurping<br />
functions of the court. So, I think, the Brandy Case meant that the<br />
High Court has said that certain procedural processes should be<br />
followed and we will be making procedural technical amendments<br />
accordingly.<br />
J: In this session?<br />
PMV: We may not draft it early enough for this session. We may even be<br />
able to draft it for presentation this session, but they don't go to the<br />
heart of the principles of Mabo. Again, they are procedural fulfilment<br />
of the Brandy High Court Case. TEL: ep. 95 1: 11 No. 004 F. 02/ 03 </p>
<p>TEL: i ~ e j j No U4 ruF* r<br />

J, What about the advertisements in the newspapers?<br />
PM: It is for the Government a very proud statistic and for the community a<br />
-very encouraging one that we have now had 16 quarters of<br />
consecutive growth four straight years of growth and we are<br />
growing now at just 3 3/ 4 per cent just under four per cent. In other<br />
words we are really moving along at a good pace, a good sustainable<br />
pace with low inflation. What the budget papers show is that the<br />
Treasury expects these numbers to continue for the next four years.<br />
So, if this Is the first time in 24 years that we have had 16 consecutive<br />
quarters of growth and we have another four years or three years out<br />
in the budget forecast as the Treasury is forecasting, that sort of<br />
period six or seven years of consecutive growth it will be way<br />
beyond any Australian experience and as we are already seeing with<br />
16 quarters. So, for the public who have been mislead to thinking it is<br />
all going to be five minutes of sunshine or something else, I don't know<br />
how many five minutes there are in four years, someone can do the<br />
sums, but there are many of them.<br />
J: On the Australia Remembers celebrations you said that it helped the<br />
soul of the nation, can you expand on that?<br />
PM: The things Australians celebrate are the things they do together<br />
community things and the greatest community action in Australia in<br />
the last half century, of course, was the Second World War. And it is<br />
that we commemorate. We commemorate those who served and<br />
those who died, but we commemorate the fact that we fought together<br />
and the country worked together during this crisis. If you look back on<br />
all of the various things we both celebrate and commemorate, it is the<br />
things we do together, are the things we feel most strongly about.<br />
J: Do you think it enhances our move towards a republic..<br />
PM: I think Australians now feel that we have such confidence about<br />
ourselves now, a pride in the country we have become, of the place we<br />
have made for ourselves here, that Australians are coming to<br />
recognise that we can only be the complete Australian nation if our<br />
head of state is an Australian person. I think that is the point.<br />
ends </p>
