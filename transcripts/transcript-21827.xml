    <content><![CDATA[<p>Can I start by saying how very sorry I am, the death of the young man Mr Ly in London as a result of the terrorist attack.  I extend my sympathy to the family. It's a reminder of how that attack was an attack on us all and not just on the British people, but on many people who visit that wonderful city. Alexander Downer has already announced the arrangements for helping the family and we'll do everything we can to assist them in our very great grief.</p>
<p> So as far as my visit is concerned, I am looking forward very much to again seeing President Bush, the Vice President and the Secretary of State and other senior members of the Administration as well as Dr Alan Greenspan whose views on the world economy and such things as oil prices will be very interesting to glean.  It is a very appropriate time to be in the American capital, to talk not only about things such as the war on terrorism and the international security situation but also matters that are important to the long term economic functioning of the world and in particular, trying to make sure that the DOHA trade round is a success. There are very important issues at stake and I will be discussing those matters along with other things with the President and other people I see. I expect to see Mr Portman, the new Special Trade representative whose taken over from Bob Zellick and he of course, now is leading the American advocacy in relation to trade matters, any questions.</p>
<p> JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  Mr Howard, I don't know if you are aware but the US Appeals Court ruled in the case of...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> Yes I am aware of that.</p>
<p> JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  Okay, Hick's lawyers are saying today there is no excuse to rush in before a  Military Commission, that he should have own turn of a Federal Court hearing.</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> Well we have a position and our position is that we are agreeable to him being tried before a Military Commission, particularly in the light of the changes that have been made to the Military Commission rules. What the District Appeals Court has done is to confirm the stance taken by the Administration that the use of  Military Commissions is quite proper and constitutional and as I read the press report this morning, authorised by the Resolution of Congress.</p>
<p> JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  So will you be mentioning David Hicks with the President, in your session with the President?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> Only to the extent of saying that we think that the Military Commission hearing should go ahead as soon as possible; that has always been our position. I am not expressing any opinion about his guilt or innocence but we do think he should be tried as soon as possible. Bear in mind, however, that if there's an appeal against the Appeals Court decision, there could be a further delay and that would not be a delay of our instigation or a delay at the instigation of the Administration.</p>
<p> JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  Mr Howard we still don't have a US Ambassador to Australia, what is the chance that you might make an announcement on that while you are here?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> Well look I don't know that is a matter for the American Administration.  They have different processes in relation to that. I don't think that it is impairing a close relationship. I don't want in any way down play the significance of American Ambassadors to Australia - Tom Schieffer was a great representative of the Administration but I am sure they will deal with that in accordance with their own processes.</p>
<p> JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  But would you like to hurry them up?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> Look it's not for me.  I don't think we should get diverted on that; the relationship is very very close. I don't think anybody could argue otherwise.</p>
<p> JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  You recently appointed Bill Farmer as Ambassador to Indonesia, what have you had back from Indonesia about that appointment?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> Certainly nothing negative.</p>
<p> JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  As it stands, David Hicks, whose case won't come up until next April, his father says he is not well, I mean isn't this going to be a long time for him to wait?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> He has been taken into custody.  You are aware of the claims made about him.   We've been over this time and time again.  I certainly want to see him brought before the Commission as soon as possible but the delay that has occurred recently has not been a delay on our part, or a delay on the part of the Administration.</p>
<p> JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  So much has changed since you were here a year ago, are you concerned how long this is taking, is there is anything you can do to expedite the process?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> I am concerned to see that the truth of the matter is established and I am satisfied that the rules governing the Military Commission will do that.</p>
<p> JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  On the ID card issue, Prime Minister, when do you hope to see something, as you say it's now on the table, when would we see further development?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> Well I can't tell you that - it is on the table. What I am saying is that in the wake what has happened in London you naturally have a look at everything again and this is one of those issues. We shouldn't see an ID card as being a solution to the problem but I do think the world is different from what it was in the late 1980's when that issue was lasted debated in Australia and therefore people who might have had a view and I as you all know, was opposed to the Australia Card, but that was 17-18 years ago. The world is very very different since then and may be this is one of the things that is needed to be added our armour, maybe... it's in that context that I said the matter was back on the table.</p>
<p> JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  Prime Minister, so the matters, the issues of principles under which you rejected the Australia Card all those years ago, no longer apply?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> What I am saying Jim is that changed circumstances have been into play - different competing principles.</p>
<p> JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  So in other words, or so we do have to accept some kind of restriction on our personal liberties and our rights in these circumstances, is that what you're saying?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> Well whenever you take measures to tighten the law or to require of citizens the availability of more information about them, it could be argued you are affecting their rights, but you have to put that against the right all of us have to expect of our Government, and it takes all reasonable measures to protect us against the behaviour of terrorists. Now it's a balance - any democratic society requires a constant re-adjustment of that balance. If you look at it just as a civil liberties issue, you would never change anything, if you just looked at it as a protection against terrorism issue, you would authorise many changes that people would regard as unacceptable. My responsibility and that of the Government is to strike a balance.</p>
<p> JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  [inaudible] benefits or otherwise?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> Not to me, [inaudible]. I have only just arrived.</p>
<p> JOURNALIST:</p>
<p> You had a happy re-union down stairs.</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> Yes.</p>
<p> JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  How long is it since you've seen your son?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> On this occasion, six months and we were very happy to see him.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  So is he working here in Washington?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> He's here as a result of, he worked here as a volunteer during the election campaign and he is just here under his own steam at the present time.</p>
<p> JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  Will you have any public events or will you be spending  the next few days with your son?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> I certainly won't have any public events tomorrow except a walk - that is always very public.</p>
<p> JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  Are we welcome?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> It's a very very public event, yes. Thank you.</p>
