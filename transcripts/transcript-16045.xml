    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Australian Government today announced its support for a ground breaking new initiative, the Australian Employment Covenant.</p>
<p>The Australian Employment Covenant is a private sector initiative lead by Mr Andrew Forrest, the CEO of Fortescue Metals Group.</p>
<p>The Australian Employment Covenant will rally employers to commit to providing opportunities for 50,000 Indigenous Australians to step out of welfare and step up to permanent full time paying jobs.</p>
<p>Just as the Government has set targets to close the gap between Indigenous and non indigenous Australians, Andrew Forrest is going to ask Australian businesses to be similarly bold.</p>
<p>Under the Australian Employment Covenant, Indigenous Australians who want to work will be encouraged to opt out of the welfare system.</p>
<p>Indigenous Australians who decide to take this first step can then enrol in a short intensive training course that will get them ready for on-the-job mentoring with a participating employer.</p>
<p>Participating employers agree through the Australian Employment Covenant to employ Indigenous people qualified to the training-ready level.</p>
<p>The Government's part of the bargain is to help bridge the training-ready gap. The Government will match this commitment with appropriate pre employment training.</p>
<p>Andrew Forrest and his steering committee  -  including Noel Pearson, Warren Mundine and Rod Eddington - will be encouraging every Australian employer to join them in tackling Indigenous unemployment in a way that only the private sector can  -  with real jobs. </p>
<p>The Government welcomes this imaginative and ambitious plan which will build on existing initiatives on the part of individual companies.</p>
