JOURNALST: Sunday Age poll. Now does that gel with<br />
your sort of research? What's your assessment of the state<br />
of play? Are there a lot of people that you still have to<br />
convire?<br />
PM: Taking part of your question first Mike, I think<br />
there are a number of people, a considerable number of<br />
people we still have to convince. Under our preferential<br />
system of course, if people are going to cast a valid vote,<br />
and they want to cast a vote for some candidate outside the<br />
major parties, if the vote is qoing to be valid they then<br />
have to make a decision as to who their preference qoes to.<br />
And I'm confident Mike that by the end of the yno in<br />
regards to that sector and I think it probaby a a larger<br />
sector this time than in previous elections I think a<br />
clear majority of those people, andt particularly those who<br />
are going to cast their vote on environmntal grounds, will<br />
give their second preference to Labor. I-meant after all i<br />
somne, number one concern is the environment and they a~ d<br />
going to vote for an environmental candidate, number one.<br />
Then if they begin to be serious, if they begin to be<br />
serious in their concern about the environment they mast<br />
give their deciding preference to Labor. Because I rend<br />
you of the record of the conservatives in this area, would<br />
have dammed the Franklin, are still in a position where they<br />
would be mining in Kakadu, every major environmental<br />
protection decision that was made, they have vehemently<br />
opposed and so in that area I'm confident that we will do<br />
very, very much better than the conservatives.<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you find it frustratinq, despite your record<br />
on the environment, there are still people who think you<br />
haven't done enough and how important do you see that is?<br />
what ert of<br />
PK: I don', t know whether frustrating is the right word. If<br />
people have a purely environmental prism in their eyes, then<br />
I suppose for then there is always going to be something<br />
else that they would like done. Now I've said already in </p>
<p>2.<br />
this campaign, I said yesterday, that one of the quite<br />
fundamental tasks of government these days, not only in<br />
Australia but around the world, is to get that balance<br />
right, between the need for development and the obligation<br />
you have to protect the environment because development is<br />
foundational. Without economic growth there aren't jobs,<br />
there isn't a capacity for sustaining and gradually<br />
developing and improving living standards and so you have<br />
got to have development and it is the basis also for<br />
discharging your obligation, for looking after the most<br />
needy in the community. When specific decisions arrive<br />
Mike, you can never or rarely let me put it be dogaatic<br />
and say I've got that absolutely right. I aean on the<br />
Franklin, no doubt at all about that one, I mean never had<br />
the slightest doubt, that had to be done. Kakadu. But in<br />
other areas there can be valid arguaents both ways and the<br />
task of getting the balance right is difficult. All I can<br />
say to the Australian people, and particularly those who are<br />
concerned with matters environmental, is that we have done<br />
the best we can and I think the record isn't bad. As I've<br />
said, when you look at it this way, economic growth twice as<br />
fast as it was. And employment growth twice as fast as the<br />
rest of the industrialised world in our period of office.<br />
At the. sae time the World Heritage Bureau saying that no<br />
country has done more to advance world heritage values than<br />
Australia. So we've done a fairly good job in getting the<br />
balance right. What the people in the environmental<br />
movement know is that in my Government they have a<br />
Government which is always prepared to listen to their<br />
argument. We may not on every single issue be able to go to<br />
every point thay want. But it's not bad to have Australia<br />
in a position where it is said of it that no country has<br />
done more to advance world heritage values than we have.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, I've been around the markets this<br />
morning in Cairns just talking to the grass roots people of<br />
North Queensland. There are two questions that really come<br />
to mind here. The first one is that with Cape York space<br />
base. There is a lot of hard feeling. The Aboriginal<br />
people it seems that they are because of the development<br />
up there. And have you decided to definately go ahead with<br />
the space base?<br />
PM: No. What we have said is that that's something that is<br />
worthy of consideration, but we have talked with the<br />
Queensland Government and what we have agreed is that we<br />
will prepare a joint land use study plan of the Cape<br />
York. In that joint study between the two Governments and<br />
is being the situation now where you have got a<br />
government that you can deal with on realities of issues<br />
rather than just being rejected on the basis of prejudice.<br />
With the Goes Government you can sit down and talk with<br />
them. We've agreed that we will have this joint land use<br />
study in preparation of a plan. That will not be something </p>
<p>3.<br />
that will be'rushed. It could take up to three years.<br />
There may be some interim reports come through but it is ' not<br />
something that will be done lightly. In that study we will<br />
be lookinq at both environmental matters and the needs and<br />
concerns of the Aboriginal people as well as developmental<br />
proposals. JOURNALIST: There seems to be a lot of pressure on the<br />
PM: I've been used to pressure. I can stand it as distinct<br />
from the Opposition. Look at the pilots dispute. 7 can<br />
stand pressure. The others can't.<br />
JOURNALIST: OK. If you could just consider another<br />
question that came up earlier this morning Why can't<br />
this Government lead the way to be the first country in the<br />
world to ban all herbicides and pesticides? A man I spoke<br />
to at the markets this morning, who was selling his organic<br />
0 bread, which was made from all natural grains and<br />
everythinq, said that<br />
PK: That's great.<br />
JOURNALIST: inaudible<br />
PUt WÃ± s is the sort of food I thrive on.<br />
JOUPRNLST: inaudible<br />
PK: Let me come to this point. Of course the question of<br />
all controls of herbicides and pestacides is not just a<br />
matter for the Commonwealth Government. We don't have the<br />
select constitutional powers in these areas. But I can we<br />
have I think a very good record in being prepared, in<br />
consultation with the States, to look at these issues and<br />
make decisions. I think our record will stand up and if<br />
there was some particular proposals in regard to any<br />
particular herbicide or pesticide, we would be prepared to<br />
look at it. And please thank the gentleman for the broad.<br />
I shall have some later on today.<br />
JOURNALIST: With the question of road funding in Australia.<br />
PM: The question of road rundinq. Yes, the question of<br />
road funding.<br />
JOURNALIST: Have you got any comitzents to give us?<br />
PM: I ight be able to tell you something during the<br />
election. Just let me say something about roads. Get it<br />
into perspective. As far as Queensland is concerned you<br />
have this situation, if you want to look at our period in<br />
office we've comitted. $ 1.8X to Queensland road fuhding in<br />
our period in office and that is a 17% increase in real<br />
k </p>
<p>terms in funding as compared withi our conservativO<br />
opponnts. And that-Is a pretty substantial increase a 1.7%<br />
increase in road funding. Now we know it's an issue and we<br />
night have sousthinq further to say about it during the<br />
election. ends </p>
