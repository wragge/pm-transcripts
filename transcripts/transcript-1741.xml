TEXT OF STATEMENT ON NATIONAL TELEVISION. BY<br />
THE PRIME MINISTER, THE RT. HON. JOHN McEWEN, MP<br />
19TH DECEMBER, 1967<br />
We all share the terrible grief which Mrs Holt and her family<br />
are suffering. On behalf of the nation I have conveyed to Mrs Holt our<br />
deepest sympathy. It is dreadful that In the prime of his life this good, able and<br />
devoted Australian should have been taken from us.<br />
Early this afternoon I accepted a commission from the Governor-<br />
General as Prime Minister. I have told Lord Casey that I Intend to retain<br />
the office of Prime Minister until the Liberal Party has chosen fok Itself a<br />
new leader. I have told the Governor-General that when this has been done,<br />
It Is my Intention to step aside.<br />
At my request, the Govern or-General will tomorrow swear all<br />
the present Ministers in their existing portfolios.<br />
During this period, my Government will continue with the policies<br />
and administrative processes of Mr Holt's Government.<br />
A number of very important official persons from overseas will<br />
come to Australia to attend the Memorial Service for Mr Holt. President<br />
Johnson has already decided to come to pay his tribute. Mr Holyoake, Prime<br />
Minister of New Zealand, Is coming. Indications have been received that a<br />
number of other Governments will be represented.<br />
The very high calibre of many amongst the visitors who will have<br />
travelled tremendous distances for this Service Is major tribute to the regard<br />
and respect In which our Prime Minister was held internationally. I would<br />
expect that advantage will be taken of the opportunity of their presence to have<br />
discussions on great matters of mutual Interest, and I have asked my Cabinet<br />
colleagues to be available. I am very sure Mr Holt would have wished this.<br />
We are at this time deeply involved in world events. We share<br />
with our Allies in Viet Nam the responsibilities and agonies of making It<br />
certain that aggressive communism cannot overrun a free people. We are<br />
having continuous communication with the British Government about its plans<br />
for the extent of their continuing involvement in Asia.<br />
My Government will continue to act as a responsible and concerned<br />
member of the international community with an especial understanding for<br />
Asian people and their problems. Our involvement In defence matters is<br />
entirely related to working with like-minded people to bring about a more<br />
stable world. On another front we are working with all our energies towards<br />
fairer international trading opportunities for all countries.<br />
The export industries of our country today have many problems.<br />
We will press ahead with the work which Mr Holt Initiated at his last Cabinet<br />
meeting to study the problems of Australia's rural Industries and the devising<br />
of policies for their betterment.<br />
There must be no Interruption of the great task of developing and<br />
strengthening this land of our heritage. It is my intention, as It ever has been<br />
to make the best contribution of which I am capable to establishing strong and<br />
stable government for Australia. </p>
