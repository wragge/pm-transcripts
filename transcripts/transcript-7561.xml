FOR MEDIA 10 APRIL 1989<br />
The Federal Government's goal for Australia's economy is to<br />
make it strong enough to compete with the world's best.<br />
Labor inherited a closeted economy denied access to goods<br />
and services at world prices, which made consumers worse<br />
off, and held back potentially efficient industries.<br />
Australian industry was fragile, and uninterested in<br />
competing on world markets.<br />
A pre-condition of change was a responsive financial sector,<br />
so early priorities were to float the dollar, relax exchange<br />
controls, free up the banks and allow new bank entrants.<br />
Other early changes included a range of industry plans to<br />
revitalise several key industry sectors, and the abolition<br />
of State purchasing preferences.<br />
Work in an array of other areas advanced to the point where,<br />
on 6 July 1987 at Ballarat, I was able to announce an agenda<br />
of twelve areas for microeconomic reform during our third<br />
term. Micro-economic reform since July 1987 has been<br />
unprecedented in Australia's history, such that all areas I<br />
mentioned in Ballarat have been addressed or will be<br />
addressed over the coming two months.<br />
The Attachment highlights some of the more important past<br />
and foreshadowed microeconomic reforms of this Government,<br />
against the background of the commitments we made to<br />
specific reforms.<br />
Today, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr<br />
Kerin, has announcedsignificant legislative change in<br />
relation to wheat transport, handling and marketing.<br />
The wheat industry provided $ 1.8 billion of exports in<br />
1987-88. While this industry has shown it can respond to<br />
change, it can only deal with the difficulties it currently<br />
faces on world markets if it is allowed to transport, handle<br />
and store its product as efficiently as possible.<br />
This point was recognised by my Government and all States<br />
when we jointly established the Royal Commission into Grain<br />
Storage, Handling and Transport.<br />
The Royal Commission recommended measures that offer cost<br />
savings of up to $ 10 per tonne. </p>
<p>While the Commonwealth is implementing those recommendations<br />
it can, the lack of general action at State level has been<br />
disappointing, even though the States have acknowledged the<br />
importance of the problems.<br />
Given the importance of this issue for our national export<br />
performance, and to ensure the grain industry can handle and<br />
market our grain as efficiently as possible, we are prepared<br />
on this occasion to legislate to override restrictive State<br />
legislation.<br />
We do not take this step lightly.<br />
We are committed to consultation, not confrontation. In<br />
this case there has been extensive, genuine consultation<br />
from the establishment of the Royal Commission, a joint<br />
project of ourselves and the States, to the protracted<br />
discussions which Mr Kerin has conducted.<br />
on Wednesday night the Treasurer will announce details of<br />
the wage/ tax trade-off, which will facilitate the most far<br />
reaching labour market reform ever attempted in Australia.<br />
On Wednesday, the Minister for Industrial Relations, Mr<br />
Morris, will provide details of further Commonwealth support<br />
for this process. The Minister for Employment, Education<br />
and Training, Mr Dawkins, will announce new measures to<br />
improve the effectiveness of our vocational education and<br />
training systems to underpin the award restructuring<br />
process. The culmination of considerable work in other areas will<br />
be seen in microeconomic reform announcements during May.<br />
These will include announcements on coastal shipping, the<br />
waterfront, science policy, air freight, defence industry,<br />
and a statement about progress in government business<br />
enterprise reform, particularly the communications pricing<br />
formula to be administered by AUSTEL.<br />
Continuing microeconomic reform is necessary to shape an<br />
economy which can deliver durable improvements in the<br />
day-to-day lives of Australians more jobs, more work<br />
satisfaction, greater growth, fewer people dependent on<br />
welfare and capacity to afford adequate assistance for the<br />
truly needy. micro reform serves, very profoundly, human<br />
needs.<br />
While an unprecedented amount has been done, the Government<br />
will continue to identify and pursue microeconomic reforms. </p>
<p>ATTACHMENT<br />
MAIN MICROECONOMIC REFORMS<br />
TO DATE IN LABOR'S THIRD TERM<br />
A. DURING THE ELECTION CAMPAIGN LABOR FORESHADOWED TARIFF<br />
REFORM Achievement has been as follows:<br />
Motor Vehicle tariff reform. Tariff quotas on<br />
motor vehicles were removed and tariffs are to be<br />
reduced from 571% to 35% by January 1992.<br />
Textiles, clothing and footwear protection reform.<br />
Quotas are to be phased out by 1 July 1995 to leave<br />
tariff-only protection.<br />
General tariff reform. With the exception of the<br />
above two industries and a small number of rates<br />
that would otherwise have become anomalous, all<br />
tariffs above 15% are being reduced to 15%, and<br />
those tariffs between 10% and 15% are being reduced<br />
to 10%, all over 4 years to July 1992. The general<br />
revenue duty of 2% was abolished at a cost of<br />
$ 240m.<br />
May 1988 Agriculture Reforms. Assistance to sugar,<br />
dried vine fruit, tobacco and citrus industries was<br />
converted to tariff and subject to the same<br />
reductions as applied to manufacturing industry and<br />
some domestic administered price arrangements were<br />
liberalised ( eg dairy). Removal of fertiliser<br />
subsidy.<br />
B. THE MAIN VEHICLE FOR ANNOUNCING THE IMPORTANCE OF MICRO<br />
REFORM IN THE THIRD TERM WAS A SPEECH I MADE AT<br />
BALLARAT, ON 6 JULY 1987. I LISTED " TWELVE ITEMS ON THE<br />
IMMEDIATE ECONOMIC AGENDA OF A THIRD HAWKE<br />
GOVERNMENT"( p. 6-9)<br />
The 12 items were as follows:<br />
1. Sweeping reform of the nation's transport<br />
infrastructure. Specifically mentioned were:<br />
terminate the two airline agreement, allowing<br />
greater competition and lower air fares<br />
announced on 7 October 1987, to take effect on<br />
October.<br />
complete the national highway of the<br />
16,000km, only one small section ( 75 km) in<br />
the Pilbara region remains to be completed. </p>
<p>improve performance in the rail freight<br />
network, including grain hadig-addressed<br />
by today's announcements to over-ride<br />
restrictive State grain transport regulations,<br />
particularly those establishing rail<br />
monopolies. improve our performance on the waterfront to<br />
be addressed in May.<br />
In addition the Government liberalised air freight<br />
restrictions on the mix of cargo consignments<br />
have been removed, and a large degree of<br />
automaticity is now provided in approving<br />
charters. These moves have increased air<br />
freight capacity, and the policy has attracted<br />
a number of new operators.<br />
coastal shipping to be addressed in may.<br />
2. Deregulate crude oil marketing<br />
Effective from 1 January 1988 refiners and<br />
crude oil producers are able to negotiate<br />
freely the quantities and prices of crude oil<br />
they buy and sell.<br />
In addition Natural Gas The Government has terminated<br />
the administered pricing formula allowing a<br />
more flexible approach to price setting, and<br />
relegating export controls to a strictly<br />
reserve power.<br />
3. Help treble the size of Australia's high technology<br />
computer and communications industry<br />
Telecommunications reform package of May 1988<br />
allows effective competition in the<br />
provision of customer premises equipment ( eg<br />
PABX), value-added services ( eg answering<br />
machines) and other telecommunications<br />
services ( eg phone maintenance, installation<br />
of second and subsequent phones) through<br />
regulatory changes and the establishment of<br />
AUSTEL. This latter independent body will<br />
subsume Telecom's regulatory functions, so<br />
allowing effective competition. </p>
<p>Information industries plan The Government<br />
in 1987 established the Partnership for<br />
Development program to encourage multinational<br />
computer companies to increase their R and D<br />
and manufacturing operations in Australia.<br />
4. Ensure spin-offs from the construction in Australia<br />
of six new submarines and eight new frigates<br />
Significant electronic and software work from<br />
the submarines contract awarded to Australian<br />
Submarine Corporation has flowed to industry<br />
in NSW, Victoria and SA. The total contract<br />
value is $ 4.3 billion ( April 1988 estimate).<br />
Proposals for the Frigate project are<br />
currently being evaluated but both tenderers<br />
( AMECON and AWS) have offered domestic<br />
industry work in excess of that flowing from<br />
the submarine project. Over 70 per cent of<br />
the total cost of the 8 Australian frigates is<br />
expected to be accounted for by Australian<br />
content.<br />
Encourage gradual amalgamation of trade unions and<br />
make necessary reform to the industrial relations<br />
system. The Industrial Relations Act 1988 places<br />
special emphasis on settling disputes at the<br />
workplace level, provides scope for greater<br />
flexibility with respect to working<br />
arrangements and remuneration, requires unions<br />
to increase membership to at least 1000 and<br />
facilitates union amalgamation.<br />
6. Steadily continue to eliminate unnecessary business<br />
regulation Request and response procedure for review of<br />
existing regulations announced in December<br />
1988, provides for industry-driven regulatory<br />
reform.<br />
7. Take further steps to help Australian firms tap<br />
export markets<br />
Particulalry Retain Austrade, and the Export Market<br />
Development Grants Scheme Done ( Liberal<br />
policy was to abolish the former and slash the<br />
latter). </p>
<p>Attack protectionism which has corrupted the<br />
world's agricultural markets. The Cairns<br />
Group's success was reflected over the weekend<br />
in Geneva.<br />
8. Further refine our research and development skills<br />
Particularly Create an Australian Research Council Done.<br />
The 150% tax deduction for R and D to be<br />
retained until 1991, when it will be replaced<br />
by a 100% deduction.<br />
In addition a Science Policy Statement will be released in<br />
May.<br />
9. Continue to encourage the elimination of outdated<br />
work and management practices.<br />
The Government has actively supported both<br />
second tier agreements and award<br />
restructuring.<br />
To be further advanced by the Treasurer's<br />
Statement on Wednesday.<br />
Further steps to build value-added processing<br />
industries As part of the TCF Plan, incentives for<br />
further processing are offered, mainly AIDC<br />
equity participation and grants of up to<br />
$ 800,000 for approved projects. Some 10 new<br />
operations are being established in Australia.<br />
Under the joint DITAC/ AUSTRADE Investment<br />
Promotion Program the Government has<br />
encouraged direct investment in early stage<br />
processing of wool, cotton skins and hides.<br />
11. Promote further enmeshment of the Australian<br />
economy with our dynamic regional neighbours<br />
Most recently, I launched a new initiative to<br />
ensure greater regional co-operation. The<br />
proposal has received wide regional support. </p>
<p>12. Further develop the tourism industry<br />
Terminate the two-airline agreement, as<br />
already mentioned.<br />
Liberalise international passenger charter<br />
policy, as of 7 October 1987.<br />
Build third runway at Kingsford-Smith Airport<br />
and commence wo rk at Badgery's Creek.<br />
Award restructuring, which will progress the<br />
removal of restrictive work practices in this<br />
vital area.<br />
C. OTHER INITIATIVES DURING THIS THIRD TERM<br />
Company tax -reform. Reduction in company tax rate<br />
from 49% to 39% and rationalisation of a range of<br />
distorting tax deductions.<br />
Establishment of Resource Assessment Commission.<br />
Announced in November 1988, to inquire into major,<br />
complex land use proposals via public hearings and<br />
reports.<br />
Reform of Government Business Enter prises ( GBEs).<br />
Over 40 longstanding controls have been removed<br />
from nearly all GBEs, including their right to<br />
enter into contracts without Ministerial approval,<br />
exemption from processes under the Public Works<br />
Committee Act 1969, their ability to invest surplus<br />
monies and enter loan contracts without Government<br />
approval, the right of the board to dismiss the<br />
Chief Executive, the removal of many public service<br />
staffing and administrative practices, and their<br />
right to establish their own superannuation<br />
schemes.<br />
D. MAY ANNOUNCEMENTS Coastal Shipping<br />
Waterfront Science<br />
A statement on continuing change in defence<br />
industries<br />
Air Freight arrangements<br />
Continuing progress in GBE reform, particularly<br />
communications pricing forumla to be administered<br />
by AUSTEL. </p>
