TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
DOORSTOP, VICTORIAN COLLEGE OF THE ARTS, MELBOURNE<br />
2 NOVEMBER 1995<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
J: Prime Minister, superannuation. The Coalition appears to have adopted a<br />
key part of your policies as their own, and called It their own now what's<br />
your response to them?<br />
PM: Well, the obvious response is If people want good, progressive policy,<br />
keep the authors of the policy not some faker who is trying to pick it up<br />
on the cheap.<br />
J: Prime Minister, retail'trade is down a fraction is that a good sign of the<br />
economy?<br />
PM: Oh, God knows, pal. That needs to be deciphered by geniuses like you.<br />
J: Prime Minister, on what do you base your claim that you say Victoria has<br />
the lowest arts spending of all the States where do you get that from?<br />
PM: Oh, Just on a few simple statstics. I don't know whether I have still got the<br />
piece of paper, but It's materially below all of the other States Victoria<br />
spends less money on the arts than any of the other States, and, of<br />
course, can I also just quote Mr Haddon Storey in terms of<br />
Commonwealth speniding. In writing to Michael Lee earlier this year, [ he]<br />
said * 1 was particulal pleased to learn of the Initiatives that are to be<br />
developed In the State of Victoria. Once again, may I commend you for<br />
the development of the cultural policy, and for the initiatives that begin to<br />
address the Imbalance in allocation of Federal resources that has<br />
unfortunately become the characteristic of arts funding over the past </p>
<p>decade". Now, a lot, of course, of the national companies are here. Now,<br />
they can't simply be counted as simply Commonwealth/ Canberra<br />
Institutions. They are actually institutions which are shared by all of us,<br />
including the city of Melbourne.<br />
J: Do you accept that ( inaudible)<br />
PM: No. I don't. And it's like these-shonky ads by Jeff Kennett this morning. I<br />
mean, what he has done. is publish the 94-95 spending on a project<br />
that.. he's published spending of $ 1,370,000, but the project cost $ 16<br />
million. Now, that's just shabby and dishonest<br />
J: What do you think is behind his attack then, Mr Keating?<br />
PM: Well, he's just trying to help Howard out. He's beyond help he shouldn't<br />
bother. I say this to Jeffrey look after yourself.<br />
J: What do you think of the report this morning that the Liberal campaign<br />
slogan is going to be lime's Up, Paul'?<br />
PM: Well, I always say to our people that Andrew Robb is the Kim Philby of the<br />
Labor Party he Is our man helping us out, because almost everything he<br />
touches turns to clay. You know, always remember that he is in there<br />
helping us.<br />
J: Will you rule out a December 9 election?<br />
PM: Oh God, you know I get asked that sort of silly question daily let me give<br />
you the standard answer. Say this to your news director with feeling, that<br />
what I believe Is the public expect to have real value from the parliaments,<br />
that they don't expect the Government to be going early, or to be shortcircuiting<br />
the opportunities the Legislative and Governmental<br />
opportunities.<br />
J: Mr Keating, back on superannuation you say don't believe John Howard<br />
when he gives these various commitments do you believe Mr Costello,<br />
and secondly, do we need another inquiry into the financial system?<br />
PM: Is that what they have said?<br />
J: Yeah.<br />
PM: They will say anything, I tell you. I mean, here they are the last Inquiry<br />
inyto the financial system you know, I will tell you a little story. When I<br />
first became Treasurer which 1s now quite a long time ago I came Into </p>
<p>this dingy litte office which Mr Howard used to occupy, arnd they had<br />
cleared out all of their things. You know, the cupboards were bare. Arnd<br />
there was a copy of the Campbell Report on the shelves, and it must have<br />
been sitting in the sun, and it had gone yellow. HeI commissioned it, and<br />
did nothing with it. The thing about Mr Howard he's not a conservative,<br />
he Is a reactionary. I mean, Menzies was a Conservative. Conservatism<br />
is about maintaining the status quo, and perhaps incremental movements<br />
forward. Mr Howard always wants to go back. So, they commissioned<br />
that study which came, really, from an idea of one of the staff members<br />
of Malcolm Frasers office he did nothing with ft. The float of the dollar,<br />
the opening up of the financial markets all of these things were left on<br />
the shelf, and they were done by this Govemment. We have now got a<br />
burgeoning, growing financial market, the exchange rate the price of It<br />
set in the markets, interest rates are set in the markets, we have got a<br />
very.. there's a lot of tone on our financial markets. I think about the last<br />
thing we need now is another inquiry Into the financial markets. I mean,<br />
they say these things every day you're just wasting your time and mine.<br />
J: What about the regulation of the financial markets?<br />
PM: There's no regulation left. What regulation? The exchange rate is set in<br />
the market, the Interest rates are set In the market.<br />
J: Well, the various; regulatory authorities like the Competition Commission<br />
and....<br />
PM: You don't like those?<br />
J: Well, he doesnt He says that there's too many, and they're too much<br />
overweight.<br />
PM: Oh, yeah. I know he says all sorts of things.<br />
J: Our State Government has released details of a city<br />
link ( inaudible) they're trying to push people onto a basically privately<br />
run freeway have you got any views on that?<br />
PM: I mean, here we are, where In the last decade, our GDP has more than<br />
doubled, and we're seeing the Stock Market climb by a factor of five,<br />
where the country Is much wealthier than It used to be, but we can't afford<br />
to run an ambulance service. We can't even afford to leave open the<br />
toilets on the railway stations. I mean, Jeff Kennett has got the lock and<br />
chain on the toilets on the railway stations. What's the world coming to? I<br />
mean, what does he think he's doing? He's looking after his pals down<br />
there at the Casino, and, as I said a moment ago, the Casino here in </p>
<p>Victoria is a tax on the poor, and a blight on the State of Victoria. And, no<br />
doubt, If he gets up to any other tricks be it the Albert Park Grand Prix,<br />
or the City Unk he'll try and shut all the roads off so people must pay the<br />
money. Now, as I said a moment ago, Jeffrey is a very worried man. He<br />
has finally worked out that people don't like him very much, and they don't<br />
like him for these sorts of shenanigans. That Is, trying to jam the roads of<br />
to make you pay the toil. I mean, what's he doing? The thing is, you see,<br />
he believes in public squalor this is the sort of snaky Uberal Party view<br />
these days this Is how the Uberal Party has changed so much. It<br />
believes now in public squalor can't afford a toilet In a railway station.<br />
can't afford an ambulance If you have had a heart attack, can't afford a<br />
road through a capital city, you can't drive through It If you don't want to<br />
take the freeway. As I said, he has got the building down in Treasury<br />
Place done out like the Reichstag, he's sitting up there and, you know, in<br />
the end this community will hate him. They will hate him for all of the<br />
things he is doing which are so un-Australian. They will hate him for ft.<br />
J: Prime Minister, John Howard was in Melbourne last night wooing the<br />
Chinese community<br />
PM: Look, John Howard couldn't woo anybody. He couldn't woo anyone. He<br />
can't even woo them in a Uberal Party conference. The last time I saw a<br />
Uberal leader at the Chinese community, was Alexander Downer chasing<br />
a meatball around a plate with a pair of chop-sticks. It's on film you'll<br />
find him. He chases it all around the plate, you know. John Howard<br />
wooing the Chinese community well, well, well. I'll tell you one thing<br />
about the Chinese they are very smart. They won't be taken in by him.<br />
Because let me tell you every time he's had the chance to kick the racial<br />
can In Australia, he has. You know what those Chinese think about him,<br />
deep In their hearts? They think if this bloke had a fair go at us, he would<br />
send us back. That's what they think about him.<br />
J: Your comments on the Casino being a tax on the poor and a blight can<br />
you expand on that?<br />
PM: Well, of course it's a tax on the poor. They open up, everyone turns up in<br />
their zoot suits, their dinner suit and the champagne, four days later,<br />
they're emptying people out from the working suburbs of Australia. You<br />
know, when they have run out of money, they pour them out the door. I<br />
mean, its a bad cultural and social development.<br />
J: Does that apply everywhere, Mr Keating? </p>
<p>PM: I hate the things I don't like Casino's. I mean, I don't have that much in<br />
common with Rupert Murdoch, but one thing I do is I think Casino's are<br />
bad news.<br />
J: What about some regulation in that area?<br />
PM: Well, thats for a smart journo like you to get right onto, mate.<br />
J: Could you still run an election campaign and attend the CHOGM and<br />
APEC meetings?<br />
PM: Well, there's a political science unit near here you want to go and throw<br />
that question in, and see what answer they give you.<br />
ends. </p>
