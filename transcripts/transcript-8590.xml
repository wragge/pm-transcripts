PRIME MINISTER<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P* J KEATING MP<br />
REVIEW OF AUSTRALIA ' S INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES<br />
In the light of the fundamental changes in the world since<br />
the end of the Cold War, the Government commissioned<br />
earlier this year a review of the overall impact of changes<br />
in international circumstances on the roles and priorities<br />
of the Australian intelligence agencies and of the<br />
Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade as a provider of<br />
reporting.<br />
The review examined how Australia's interests have been<br />
affected by the rapid and significant changes in<br />
international circumstances, whether Australia still needs<br />
the intelligence structure it has and, if so, whether the<br />
roles and pRiorities of our intelligence agencies need to<br />
be adjusted. It also looked at how changes in<br />
international circumstances would affect management and<br />
coordination arrangements between the Australian<br />
intelligence and security agencies, and Australia's<br />
partnership and liaison arrangements.<br />
The review was conducted by the Secretaries Committee on<br />
Intelligence and Security, the principal group of officials<br />
advising Ministers on security and intelligence matters.<br />
It includes the Secretaries of my Department, Foreign<br />
Affairs and Trade, Defence, Finance, and the Attorney-<br />
General's Department; and the Chief of the Defence Force<br />
and the Directors-General of Security and of the Office of<br />
National Assessments.<br />
The agencies subject to the review were:<br />
the Office of National Assessments ( ONA);<br />
the Defence Intelligence Organisation ( DIO);<br />
the Defence Signals Directorate ( DSD);<br />
the Australian Secret Intelligence Organisation ( ASIS);<br />
the Australian Security Intelligence Organization<br />
( ASIO); and<br />
the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade as a<br />
provider of reporting on overseas developments.<br />
The Government considers that global and regional<br />
relationships, freed from the rigidity of the Cold War<br />
ideological and strategic divide, will become more complex<br />
and diverse. A more fluid international environment will<br />
require a sharper appreciation of Australian interests and </p>
<p>2<br />
priorities, of the resources available to pursue our goals,<br />
and of the need to allocate those resources effectively.<br />
As with our defence policies, our approach to the<br />
collection and assessment of intelligence will need to be<br />
increasingly self-reliant.<br />
The requirement for accurate, informed judgments about the<br />
issues and regions of most importance to Australia will not<br />
diminish with the end of the Cold War. The intelligence<br />
community, whether by collecting information which is not<br />
available elsewhere, or by providing high-quality analysis<br />
and assessment of political, economic and strategic matters<br />
important to our national interests, will continue to have<br />
a vital role to play.<br />
The Government has decided not to alter the basic structure<br />
of Australia's intelligence community which was set in<br />
place after Mr Justice Hope's comprehensive reviews, for<br />
reasons of enduring concern relating to efficiency and<br />
effectiveness. Essential to that structure is the<br />
separation of the assessment, policy and foreign<br />
intelligence collection functions -a philosophy which the<br />
Government continues to embrace.<br />
The Government endorses the judgment in the review that,<br />
since the completion of Mr Justice Hope's first Royal.<br />
Commission on Intelligence and Security, the priorities of<br />
the Australian agencies have been properly focused on<br />
regional areas and issues of most relevance to Australia's<br />
national interests. The end of the Cold War, therefore,<br />
does not call for a fundamental reordering of priorities.<br />
In general terms, political and strategic questions will<br />
remain the first priority for Australia's intelligence<br />
agencies. Economic issues will, in relative terms, become<br />
more important in the post-Cold War era of the 1990s, but<br />
assessment in economic areas generally depends less on<br />
intelligence sources than is the case for political and<br />
strategic subjects. Issues relating to transnational<br />
criminal activity, the mass movement of people, and<br />
proliferation of weapons of mass destruction will also<br />
warrant higher priority.<br />
Consistent with the philosophy of a separation of the<br />
assessment, policy and foreign intelligence collection<br />
functions, the Government considers that the existing roles<br />
of the individual agencies remain valid in the 1990s. The<br />
rationale outlined by Mr Justice Hope for ASIO as a freestanding,<br />
non-executive, advisory intelligence security<br />
agency remains relevant in the 1990s and the Government has<br />
therefore decided that ASIO should continue to have the<br />
roles and responsibilities laid down in existing<br />
legislation. The Soviet threat certainly informed an important component<br />
of ASIO's activities, but threats from other sources of<br />
foreign interference and politically motivated violence<br />
have been important to ASIO for some time, and will remain<br />
so. However, the implications for ASIG of the changes in </p>
<p>the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe are more farreaching<br />
thian for the other agencies.<br />
The Government has therefore dec ided that, while ASIO's<br />
capacity to meet its responsibilities must be maintained,<br />
there is scope for resource reductions.<br />
The Government has also decided to pursue important changes<br />
to management and coordination arrangements.<br />
A new medium-to-long-term planning mechanism is to be<br />
established. This mechanism will, for the first time,<br />
embrace both overt and covert intelligence collection,<br />
recognising the centrally important role of the Department<br />
of Foreign Affairs and Trade in keeping the Australian<br />
Government informed about developments abroad.<br />
The new mechanism, to be called the Foreign Intelligence<br />
Planning Document, will provide for the integration of<br />
judgments about changes in the international environment<br />
with decisions about resources and the balance and mix of<br />
skills across the intelligence agencies.<br />
The Government has also decided to revise the agencies'<br />
annual reporting requirements. Henceforth, the agencies<br />
will be required to present advice to the Government<br />
concerning the allocation of approved resources against<br />
strategic priorities and program objectives.<br />
The review stresses the need for a self-reliant<br />
intelligence capability in those areas and issues of<br />
highest priority for Australia, but recognises the benefits<br />
which continue to flow to us from the long-standing<br />
partnership agreements with the United States, United<br />
Kingdom, New Zealand and Canada. It also recognises the<br />
importance of developing and strengthening regional<br />
intelligence liaison arrangements.<br />
Because assessments and judgments made now about the<br />
implications of changed world circumstances need to be<br />
monitored to ensure their continuing validity, the<br />
Government is taking steps to ensure that the review just<br />
completed does not constitute a one-off exercise; rather it<br />
is the starting point for a process of change with specific<br />
issues being addressed in an on-going way, ensuring<br />
Australia's intelligence and security agencies remain able<br />
to meet our needs in a rapidly changing world.<br />
Given the sensitivity of the issues involved, a public<br />
version of the review report will not be prepared. But in<br />
accordance with established practice, I have provided the<br />
Leader of the Opposition with a copy of the full report<br />
which informed the Government's decisions.<br />
