FOR PRESS P. M. No. 43/ 1966<br />
THE VIET NAM MEDAL<br />
Stater:: ent by the Prime Minister, 1M1r. Harold Holt<br />
Her Majesty The Queen has signified her approval to the<br />
award of a special medal for service in Viet Nam, and to the<br />
desi8n of a ribbon for the medal.<br />
The approval follows a joint approach by the Prime<br />
Minister of Nev,, Zealand, the Rt. Hon. Keith Holyoake, and<br />
myself to Her Majesty for a medal which would recognise<br />
service by Australian and Ne:; Zealand servicemen in Viet Nam.<br />
In consultation with New Zealand + he ribbon has been<br />
desi-ned to incorporate the colours traditionall symbolic of<br />
the Three Services and also red and yellow, whic are the<br />
national colours of the Government of the epublic of Viet Nam.<br />
Supplies of the ribbon are on their way to Viet Nam and will<br />
be issued to our men shortly. The award will represent a<br />
recognition of the excellent service our Forces have given in<br />
the cause of freedom and the resistance of Communist aggression<br />
in South Viet Nam. Australian servicemen have over t e years<br />
been found serving the cause of freedom in many parts of he<br />
world, and we are proud on this occasion that the medal is being<br />
made available in the ANZAC tradition.<br />
To qualify for the medal it will be necessary for a<br />
serviceman to have been attached to a unit posted to South Viet<br />
Nam for at least one day or in the case of aircrew, to have<br />
flown one sortie over Viet tam. The medal will be available to<br />
members of the armed forces and also to accredited members of<br />
philanthropic organisations who wear the prescribed uniform.<br />
n all cases, the relevant service must be on or after 29th<br />
May, 1964. The Government of New Zealand is being consulted on a<br />
design for the medal for submission to Her Majesty for approval.<br />
As with all medals awarded by The Queen, the obverse will bear<br />
an effigy of Her Majesty. The reverse will carry a suitable<br />
theme to mark the nature of the award. Themes for the reverse<br />
are now being considered, and the 1inister for Defence will be<br />
making a furlher announcement on this subject when approval for<br />
the theme has been received.<br />
