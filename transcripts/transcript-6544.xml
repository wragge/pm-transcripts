Minister for Resources and Energy, Senator Peter Walsh<br />
EMBARGOED UNTIL 10,30 AM, WEDNESDAY, 7 NOVEMBER 1984<br />
ADDRESS BY THE MINISTER FOR RESOURCES AND ENERGY,<br />
SENATOR PETER WALSH, AT THE OPENING OF THE<br />
13TH ANNUAL BUREAU OF MINERAL RESOURCES ( BMR) SYMPOSIUM,<br />
CANBERRA, WEDNESDAY, 7 NOVEMBER<br />
THE MAJOR FOCUS OF THIS SYMPOSIUM AND ITS ASSOCIATED ACTIVITIES<br />
IS ON THE FORMATION AND DISCOVERY OF HYDROCARBON RESERVES.<br />
IN RECENT YEARS AND CONTRARY TO EXPECTATIONS FORMED IN THE LATE<br />
1970S, NOMINAL AND REAL OIL PRICES HAVE FALLEN SUBSTANTIALLY.<br />
THAT TREND AT LEAST IN REAL TERMS SEEMS LIKELY TO CONTINUE FOR<br />
SOME TIME.<br />
AGAINST THAT BACKGROUND THE GOVERNMENT NOTES WITH SOME<br />
SATISFACTION THAT OVERALL DRILLING ACTIVITY IN 1984 IS SET TO<br />
ESTABLISH A NEW RECORD. IF THE RATE ESTABLISHED IN THE FIRST<br />
THREE QUARTERS OF THIS YEAR IS MAINTAINED, 242 EXPLORATION WELLS<br />
AND 484,500 METRES WILL BE DRILLED AN INCREASE OF 9.5% AND 7.1%<br />
RESPECTIVELY ON THE PREVIOUS RECORD, -1-</p>
<p>THERE WILL BE A MAJOR INCREASE IN ONSHORE ACTIVITY, OFFSHORE<br />
EFFORT IS SET TO EQUAL THE RECORD LEVEL OF 1983,<br />
NEITHER THE EXCISE ON NEW OIL ONSHORE NOR THE OFFSHORE<br />
GREENFIELDS RESOURCE RENT TAX POLICY HAVE INDUCED THE EXPLORATION<br />
DECLINE WHICH SOME HAD ASSERTED THEY WOULD,<br />
IN JANUARY 1983 IT WAS PREDICTED THAT EXPLORATION ACTIVITY WOULD<br />
DECLINE SUBSTANTIALLY IN 1983 AND IN SUCCEEDING YEARS, IT WAS<br />
ALSO ASSERTED THAT THE DECLINE WOULD ACCELERATE IF ANY CHANGES<br />
WERE MADE TO COMMONWEALTH TAX POLICY, THE PREDICTION AND<br />
ASSERTION HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO BE QUITE WRONG, THE GOVERNMENT'S<br />
JUDGEMENT THAT THE NEW TAX ARRANGEMENTS ARE EFFICIENT AND<br />
REASONABLE AND INDEED ABOUT WHAT THOUGHTFUL EXPLORERS HAD<br />
ALWAYS EXPECTED HAS BEEN CONFIRMED BY EVENTS,<br />
SOME, WHO HAVE SEEN THEIR PROPHECIES REFJTED, HAVE: ARGUED THAT<br />
ONLY PERMIT OBLIGATIONS, ESPECIALLY IN OFFSHORE AREAS, HAVE<br />
SUSTAINED ACTIVITY, THIS IGNORES THE FACT THAT COMPANIES WOULD<br />
SURRENDER PERMITS IF THEY BELIEVED, ALL THINGS COTSIDERED, THAT<br />
FURTHER INVESTMENT WAS NOT WARRANTED,<br />
IN THE LAST THREE YEARS VERY LITTLE NEW OFFSHORE ACREAGE HAS BEEN<br />
ALLOCATED, THIS COULD AFFECT ACTIVITY IN FUTURE YEARS, BUT PLANS<br />
ARE ON HAND TO AWARD NEW PERMIT AREAS EARLY NEXT YEAR,<br />
-2-I </p>
<p>CLEARLY THE ASSERTION THAT THE GOVERNMENT'S TAXATION POLICIES FOR<br />
NEW OIL HAVE DETERRED EXPLORATION CANNOT BE SUSTAINED,<br />
IN REGARD TO OLD OIL, THE OLD OIL EXCISE SYSTEM PRECLUDED THE<br />
DEVELOPMENT OF SEVERAL MINOR FIELDS IN BASS STRAIT,<br />
I AM PLEASED THAT, FOLLOWING CONSULTATIONS WITH THE PERMIT<br />
HOLDERS, A CONCESSIONAL EXCISE SYSTEM HAS BEEN DETERMINED AND WAS<br />
ANNOUNCED BY ME LAST MONTH,<br />
THIS WILL RESULT IN A NEW MULTI-BILLION DOLLAR DEVELOPMENT<br />
PROGRAM IN BASS STRAIT, WITH A FURTHER BOOST TO OIL<br />
SELF-SUFFICIENCY OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS, MORE THAN 1,000 JOBS<br />
WILL BE CREATED BY THE INVESTMENT PROGRAM,<br />
THE BMR's PRIMARY ROLE DURING THE NEAR FORTY YEARS IT HAS EXISTED<br />
HAS BEEN TO PROVIDE THE FRAMEWORK OF KNOWLEDGE AND THE BROAD<br />
GEOLOGICAL ASSESSMENT WITHIN WHICH MORE SPECIFIC EXPLORATION<br />
TARGETS CAN BE IDENTIFIED AND TESTED, USUALLY BY THE PRIVATE<br />
SECTOR,<br />
THERE DOES NOT APPEAR TO HAVE BEEN SIGNIFICANT DISSENT FROM THE<br />
BASIC PRESUMPTION THAT BROAD ASSESSMENTS ARE BEST CONDUCTED BY A<br />
GOVERNMENT AGENCY OR AGENCIES, OR THE CONCLUSION THAT THE BMR HAS<br />
DISCHARGED ITS DUTIES WELL, </p>
<p>IT IS ALSO AGREED, I BELIEVE, THAT THE BUREAU MUST CONTINUALLY<br />
REVIEW ITS ACTIVITIES AGAINST A BACKGROUND OF ACCUMULATING<br />
KNOWLEDGE AND CHANGING TECHNOLOGY AND OBJECTIVES,<br />
SUBSTANTIAL CHANGES RECOMMENDED BY THE ASTEC REPORT IN 1979 ARE<br />
BEING IMPLEMENTED,<br />
PROBABLY THE MOST SIGNIFICANT OF THE CHANGES IS THE INCREASING<br />
EMPHASIS ON PETROLEUM ASSESSMENT, IN 1983 THE GOVERNMENT<br />
ENDORSED THE CONTINENTAL MARGINS PROGRAM MORE PRECISELY KNOWN,<br />
I UNDERSTAND, AS FRAMEWORK STUDIES OF AUSTRALIAN OFFSHORE AREAS<br />
A PROJECT CLOSELY RELATED TO THE THEME OF THIS SEMINAR,<br />
THE GEOSCIENCE RESEARCH VESSEL RIG SEISMIC HAS BEEN CHARTERED AND<br />
ARRIVED IN AUSTRALIA LAST MONTH, COMMITMENTS HAVE BEEN MADE TO<br />
PURCHASE THE SCIENTIFIC APPLICATIONS COMPUTER WHICH COMPLEMENTS<br />
THE SEISMIC AND GEOSCIENCE PROGRAM AND THE COMPREHENSIVE<br />
DATABASE, FUNDS HAVE ALSO BEEN SECURED FOR CONTRACT DRILLING AT<br />
CONSIDERABLE DEPTH OF PREVIOUSLY UNTESTED AREAS ONSHORE,<br />
THE NEW PROGRAMS HAVE REQUIRED A VERY LARGE INCREASE IN FUNDS<br />
FROM THE LOW LEVELS TO WHICH FUNDING HAD SUNK IN THE 1978-1982<br />
PERIOD, THIS YEAR $ 31.1 MILLION HAS BEEN APPROPRIATED A 48%<br />
INCREASE ON THE $ 21 MILLION SPENT IN 1982-83, </p>
<p>GIVEN THE FINANCIAL DISCIPLINE TO WHICH THE PRESENT GOVERNMENT<br />
COMMITTED ITSELF FROM THE OUTSET, THERE WAS A PRIMA FACIE CASE<br />
AGAINST EXPENDITURE INCREASES OF THAT MAGNITUDE, INDEED ONE<br />
INFLUENTIAL GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENT OFFERED THE OPINION THAT THE<br />
PROPOSED EXPENDITURE WAS AN EMBARRASSMENT, COMING AS IT DID FROV<br />
A MEMBER OF THE GOVERNMENT'S EXPENDITURE REVIEW COMMITTEE,<br />
NORMALLY I WOULD BE RECEPTIVE TO THAT SORT OF VIEW, BUT BELIEVE<br />
THE GEOSCIENCE AND SEISMIC EXPENDITURES SHOULD BE REGARDED AS<br />
INVESTMENT FOR THE FUTURE, NOT CONSUMPTION IN THE PRESENT, THE<br />
ERC AND CABINET AGREED A TRIBUTE I BELIEVE TO THE COMMONSENSE<br />
OF MY COLLEAGUES, RATHER THAN TO MY UNIQUE SKILLS AS AN ADVOCATES,<br />
THE STRONG' COMMERCIAL INTEREST TOUCHED OFF BY THE BUREAU'S DEEPER<br />
SEISMIC SURVEY OF THE PREVIOUSLY ABANDONED BASS BASIN IS A<br />
SIGNIFICANT EXAMPLE OF THE VALUE OF SUCH WORK,<br />
BEFORE CLOSING I WISH TO MENTION TWO RECENT INITIATIVES INVOLVING<br />
THE BUREAU,<br />
FIRSTLY, THE PROVISION IN THE 1984 BUDGET OF STAFF AND EQUIPMENT<br />
TO MONITOR NUCLEAR EXPLOSIONS AND CONTRIBUTE TO AN INTERNATIONAL<br />
DATA CENTRE,<br />
SECONDLY, PURSUANT TO THE MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING SIGNED BY<br />
ME LAST YEAR, AN AUSTRALIAN SCIENTIFIC PARTY WILL VISIT CHINA<br />
NEXT YEAR TO SELECT AN AREA FOR A DETAILED JOINT GEOSCIENTIFIC </p>
<p>I le<br />
STUDY, THIS FURTHER STRENGTHENS THE DEVELOPING RELATIONSHIP WITH<br />
CHINA, PROVIDES OPPORTUNITIES FOR INVOLVEMENT BY AUSTRALIAN FIRMS<br />
IN CHINESE MINERAL DEVELOPMENT, AND REINFORCES AUSTRALIA'S<br />
ALREADY FAVOURABLE POSITION TO PARTICIPATE IN THE INTERNATIONAL<br />
TRADE OPPORTUNITIES ASSOCIATED WITH, CHINA'S ECONOMIC GROWTH,<br />
FINALLY IT IS MY PLEASURE TO DECLARE THIS SYMPOSIUM OPEN.<br />
