    <content><![CDATA[<p> I welcome the constructive approach taken by business and community</p>
<p> leaders who gathered in Canberra today for the first-ever Business</p>
<p> and Community Partnerships Round table to discuss strategies aimed</p>
<p> at enhancing partnerships to benefit the nation.</p>
<p>Australia must be prepared to meet the social challenges of the new</p>
<p> century that requires more effective links between Government and</p>
<p> the corporate and community sectors.</p>
<p>While the Federal Government retains the primary responsibility for</p>
<p> the social safety net, there is a need to further encourage the already</p>
<p> significant roles played by the business and community sectors in</p>
<p> the development of our society.</p>
<p>I have been encouraged by the attitudes and ideas expressed at today's</p>
<p> meeting. There is a readiness in the community for a more co-operative</p>
<p> approach, which signifies a greater civility in dealing with each</p>
<p> other as Australians.</p>
<p>I congratulate the Round Table members on their positive deliberations,</p>
<p> and look forward to the development of strategies designed to achieve</p>
<p> improved outcomes for our society.</p>
<p>The Round Table participants included Family Services Minister Warwick</p>
<p> Smith and 21 prominent Australians from the corporate and community</p>
<p> sectors.</p>
<p>Mr Smith said the Round Table meeting had agreed on a shared approach</p>
<p> towards developing strategies in a number of areas, including taxation,</p>
<p> education and the protocols for Prime Minister's Awards recognising</p>
<p> effective partnerships between the business and community sectors.</p>
<p>There was a recognition at the Round Table that this is truly an idea</p>
<p> whose time has come, Mr Smith said.</p>
<p>A lot is already happening. What we need to do now is to assist in</p>
<p> the creation of networks where ideas can be developed and successful</p>
<p> experiences exchanged. One suggestion was a website for business and</p>
<p> community partnerships.</p>
<p>There is scope for the business sector to use its resources and expertise</p>
<p> the help build the management and technology capacity of the community</p>
<p> sector. Similarly, the community sector can inform corporate Australia</p>
<p> of the facilities it needs, so that appropriate partnerships can be</p>
<p> created.</p>
<p>The Government has been encouraged by the willingness of both the</p>
<p> business and community sectors to identify areas of mutual interest</p>
<p> and benefit.</p>
