PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR PRESS 31 OCTOBER 1978<br />
MEETING WITH SIR CHARLES COURT AND MR. BJELKE-PETERSEN<br />
I have had a report from the Acting Minister for Trade and<br />
Resources and Minister for Special Trade Representations,<br />
Mr. Garland, after his meeting with Sir Charles Court at<br />
the-weekend.<br />
I have also had a very useful telephone discussion with<br />
Sir Charles Court today.<br />
Following that conversation I have responded positively<br />
to the Premier.' s suggestion that there should be discussions<br />
with Sir Charles and the Queensland Premier on the<br />
Government's minerals export guidelines after the Loan<br />
Council meeting in Melbourne next week. </p>
