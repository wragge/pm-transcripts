LIBERAL PARTY SPEAKERS' GROUP DINNER<br />
Southern Cross Hotel, Melbourne 27 FEBRUARY 1968<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, M4R JOHN GORTON<br />
Mr President of the Speakers' Group, Mr President of the State Division of<br />
the Liberal Party and Ladies and Gentlemen:<br />
You know, Bob, when you spoke, you reminded me a little<br />
of " old forgotten far-off things and battles long ago". Remember when you<br />
were speaking of the time you were thrown out of the meeting and I was<br />
quite unable to give you any assistance; It brought back to my mind an<br />
occasion I think it was the Communist Dissolution Bill or the Banning of<br />
Communists whatever It was way, way In the past when much the<br />
same thing happened to me. But not quite the same because I remember<br />
vividly in the middle of an Inspiring speech by the former Prme Minister,<br />
Sir Robert Menzies, somebody was Interjecting rather annoyingly and I<br />
was much younger than I am now and I remember approaching him and<br />
saying I'm not going to say that I said this, but the newspapers next<br />
day said I said this " Would you like to have It In here or outside, you<br />
yellow rat! Whereupon I was grabbed by an enormously large policeman<br />
and frogmarched half-way to the door, and the Prme Minister Interrupted<br />
h is policy speech to say " Hey, you can't throw him out. He's one of my<br />
lot" And he had much more effect than I had on you. But still 1 think the<br />
spirit was the same in both cases In yours and in mirke.<br />
You did say something very pleasant Indeed, too, about<br />
my wife, and she has one enormous advantage. Most of the speeches that<br />
she makes are made in Indonesian, and nobody five years later, or even<br />
five days later because they don't understand them is able to say, " Yes,<br />
but five days ago, you said this or you said that". At least, very few people<br />
can, and probably those who really do understand It would not be able in time<br />
to translate It and drift it back to Australia. This is something that most<br />
politicians must regard as a promised land, where you don't get things<br />
thrown back up at you things which I remember being thrown up to<br />
me the television Interview with the ABC, that marvellous undertaking<br />
which we finance but do not control. 1968 somebody said to me,<br />
" Yes. In your maiden speech in 1950, didn't you say this?" Well, I did.<br />
It is quite right. As a matter of fact, he was a very nice man. He wasn't<br />
wrong. Anyway, what I said then wasn't much different from what I am<br />
saying now. But at least she Is spared this risk, which Is an occupational<br />
risk of most of the rest of us as politicians.<br />
It Is here on this night, in this room of this hotel, a<br />
most memorable experience for me to be able to talk to you on this occasion,<br />
My mind goes back, as the minds of man y but not all of you will go<br />
back, because not all of you are old enough, to the time when this party<br />
which you have supported for so long was formed, and to the conditions which<br />
prevailed In Australia and which led to the formation of this party, and to<br />
the work which you and others have put Into it for two decades. It is worthwhile<br />
at this point t o go back and remember, to go back and bring into<br />
our minds what it was then which so motivated so many people that they<br />
were prepared to leave the professions In which they were engaged, that </p>
<p>2-<br />
they were prepared to give up time which otherwise would be devoted to<br />
their own entertainment, that they were prepared to take the risks which at<br />
that time were real risks, In order to try to change the situation in which<br />
Australia then found Itself, in order to try to direct it along a path which they<br />
thought, and I believe thought properly, would be a better path for the nation<br />
to which they belonged. just think what then was the situation. We had then In this<br />
country an approach by those who were charged with directing the affairs<br />
of this country, which was prepared to accept that It was reasonable that<br />
there should be from five to eight per cent of unemployment, and If we<br />
attained seven per cent that was pretty well full employment, as far as<br />
any country could achieve It.<br />
We had then people who were prepared to maintain that there<br />
ought to be, not for any observed or reasoned process, but that there ought<br />
to be constraints and restrictions of various kinds just because those<br />
constraints and restrictions had once been Imposed, and having once been<br />
imposed, ought to be maintained merely for their own sake.<br />
And we had a government then which was prepared to suggest<br />
that In the name of planning, although it ougit not to have been In the name of<br />
planning, In the name of social action, although It ought not to have been in<br />
the name of sccial action, governments ought to take action In order to see<br />
not that an individual was able to express himself for his own sake and for<br />
the sake of the nation to which he belonged; governments ought to take<br />
action not to see that exploitation was not carried out as sometimes It can<br />
be carried out by individuals, but which was prepared to go further and to<br />
say not we think social action is necessary to improve matters, but we think<br />
social action is necessary to prevent people from engaging In some particular<br />
field of activity, to stop people engaging, for example, In banking activities<br />
not in competition with the State but to stop them altogether; to stop people<br />
from sowing wheat fields if they felt Inclined to take the risk of sowing wheat<br />
fields; to prevent individual initiative. And that is what we then had.<br />
I think because of the Impact of this on those of you In this<br />
room who remember It and those of you in this room to whom the memory<br />
of those days has been passed down, you were ready then to ta-ke risks,<br />
you were ready then to give effort and to give work to change that approach,<br />
to throw out that kind of government, to put in something which fitted more<br />
In with the beliefs that you had as to what you wished to see.<br />
You were prepared to reject entirely the Idea, which was an<br />
Idea Inherent In a government of two decades ago, that you existed, and the<br />
rest of the Australian citizens existed to serve a state, and you were prepared<br />
to put In the place of that idea, an Idea that a state existed to control, yes,<br />
but existed for the sake of the Individuals that lived under It, and not for its<br />
own sake, demanding from Individuals complete support.<br />
This was a watershed, I think, In Australian development<br />
and Australian history, and because we were successful then, and because<br />
under two great Prime Ministers we have since then, with the application<br />
of the principles they then set out, so far advanced this country that those<br />
living twenty years ago could not have envisaged the situation which we<br />
are now In, so I believe you will support those approaches. If you do support<br />
those approaches, then in two decades from now, we will be as far ahead of<br />
our present Imagination as today we are ahead of the Imagination of two decades<br />
ago. / 3 </p>
<p>-3-<br />
. As the result of what you initially did, surely we<br />
have transformed this nation to take the examples I used before transformed<br />
It where Instead of five to eight per cent of unemployment, we believe and<br />
have brought Into operation the belief that full employment Is possible and If<br />
we have one or one and a half per cent unemployment, then this becomes<br />
a matter of comment. Surely over the last decades we have built up In thip<br />
country Industrial muscles which have enabled us to take In the Immigration<br />
which In that period of time has taken place.<br />
How often do I remember members of the Opposition saying,<br />
" T~ hat are you going to do next year when x thousand school-leavers come on<br />
to the market?" Year after year have I heard it said, and year after year<br />
have x thousand school-leavers been absorbed into the industries and the<br />
opportunities which have been created because of the climate which has been<br />
made by the government not because of what the government has da2 bit Oemase<br />
of what the underlying philosophy which motivates the government<br />
has enabled you and the other citizens of Australia to do.<br />
Surely we have transformed our whole approach from one<br />
which at one time said " VIe don't want to encourage In this country home<br />
ownership because that creates little capitalists" into an approach which<br />
says we wish people-to hold their own homes and to have other ownership<br />
and to have a stake in the development of the country In which they live,<br />
and which has been successfully, I think, translated Into action so that here<br />
In this country In these two decades we have created a society in which more<br />
people own their homes and have a stake In their country and have other<br />
owinership of material things than has ever been dreamed of In this country<br />
bef ore. Here, surely, In these last two decades, we have grown from<br />
some small, relatively unconsidered nation, a nation shielded through Its<br />
whole existence by the shield and buckler of the British Navy, into a nation<br />
which yet still needs shielding, but which has become not a great power in the<br />
world, because of course as yet we are not, bu t a power, the voice of which<br />
has some significance In the councils of Asia, thanks particularly to the late<br />
Prime Minister, Mr Holt; and to which so many of the peoples near us, and<br />
I think some of the peoples of the great powers further away, look not now<br />
as some significant world force, because we are not, but as some potential<br />
world force, because if we go on In the way in which we have been moving, we<br />
will be in two or three decades In the future some really significant world<br />
force. as long as the roots are not cut by a reversal to that kind of approach,<br />
which two decades behind us we left.<br />
People say and it Is a proverb which has some significance<br />
that the proof of the pudding is in the eating. Now those of us who are in<br />
this room, and those of us who over the years have contributed In one way or<br />
another to the pudding which now Is before the Australian people, will I think<br />
agree that sa far If the proof of the pudding is in the eating, then the proof on<br />
the record Is a good proof, even though there has been in these two decades<br />
behind us, as there will be in the two decades in the front of us, even amongst<br />
us in this room, even am ongst us with a general political philosophy, and<br />
as there must always be amongst such people, differences of opinion as to<br />
particular facts, differences of interpretation as to particular approaches,<br />
arguments, because it Is of the very lifeblood of a political party that there<br />
should be arguments inside It, solved inside it, and agreed by all in that<br />
political party after they have been solved by it, even though that should be so<br />
as it has been In the past and as It undoubtedly will be in the future, yet that<br />
play and Interplay has brilliantly justified Itself under the two great men who<br />
v / 4 </p>
<p>-4<br />
for the last two decades have led Australia.<br />
And now you, and many others like you throughout<br />
Australia, have asked me for a while to try to continue to advance that work<br />
which has been so well begun. I know, as I have said before, I cannot do<br />
it without you and others like you throughout Australia, arguing, contesting<br />
agreeing, if you don't agree, being told to go aloft In a particular way, to try<br />
and continue this. And believe me, Indeed you know, we have before us<br />
in the next two decades problems to be overcome which are perhaps even<br />
more difficult, even more Intransigent than the problems which already<br />
have been surmounted. There is nothing wrong with this, because this is true of<br />
a mants life, any man's life, any woman's life, and any nation's life that<br />
you don't by removing a problem, remove all problems. You merely, by<br />
overcoming a problem and a challenge, provide yourself with a new problem<br />
and a new challenge, and if you overcome that In turn, another one after that.<br />
But each one that Is overcome is a new step up the ladder to the destiny which<br />
I believe we can together bring to this country of ours.<br />
I have made, In the election for which I have just stood, on<br />
behalf of the Government which will shortly be sworn In, no finite promises<br />
to you or to Australia, except that we will continue, as best in us lies, to<br />
follow the paths which have been blazed before.<br />
And yet all of us can see the problems which do need to be<br />
overcome. We must and this I put highly, not overwhelmingly but highly,<br />
because I regard it as the test of the success of any society, not just the<br />
material success of any society, but the success of a society as a group of<br />
people In which individuals are looked after an-asisted we must re-examine<br />
from top to bottom our social services systemr 7f that Is what you wish to<br />
call It, our welfare system.<br />
WAe must seek to Isolate to examine and Isolate those cases<br />
In which real need exists and In which real poverty prevails, and seek to see<br />
that this is not something which crushes the human spirit of those under real<br />
poverty or under real need. But this is not enough of Its own because we must<br />
seek to make at the same time after all, we are all going to contribute to<br />
this to make more efficient the methods we adopt in order to try to eliminate<br />
this poverty and this need, and to see that there is no waste in the way In which<br />
we attack that particular requirement of a really advanced community.<br />
In doing this we must seek to try and not destroy the Incentive<br />
of people during their working life to save and to provide for themselves, not<br />
to sq uan der their savings In order to get more assistrance from the community<br />
at the end of their lives. All these in this one matter a matter of great<br />
Importance to us If we are to hold up our heads and say this Is a country which<br />
Is not only materially but spiritually great all these are the bread and butter<br />
which must be looked at, which must be closely examined, which must be<br />
analysed, on which work must be put in to see that we attain the goal which<br />
I have briefly outlined to you.<br />
And in doing It, as we must and will do it, we have got to<br />
steer between Scylla and Charybdis. Ie must avoid the approach so<br />
prevalent in England under, I think. the thinking of a socialist government<br />
that all Is provided without cost q rclatively shoddy way to everybody a </p>
<p>at in fact a final cost which prevents in our case, or would, a growth to<br />
greatness which has In its application, as I believe, In the United Kingdom<br />
led to some decline from greatness, not because of the United Kingdom<br />
people whom I believe to be as great in themselves as ever they were, but<br />
because of this imposition which two decades ago, thank God, we got rid<br />
of In Australia. These things and I have presented one problem to you<br />
alone are not done over-night. There have been propositions easily thrown<br />
around " Let's Integrate things. Let's have a Minister of Social Wlelf are<br />
and an Assistant Minister for Social Services and an Assistant Minister<br />
for Health and an Assistant Minister for Housing, who all come in to the<br />
point of the Minister for Social Welfare". Indeed, tbis has an attraction,<br />
but It is also an attraction which has a very difficult objecdion, because you<br />
can't have Assistant Ministers under the Constitution under which we live.<br />
Well you can, but you can't pay the m anything or else they lose their seat<br />
In Parliament. So these easy approaches, and they are easy approaches,<br />
are not necessarily to be accepted at face value. But what is to be accepted<br />
Is that there does need to be an overall look at the whole of this field and<br />
somebody whatever they are called, to correlate these to see that waste<br />
does not occur, that duplication does not occur, that the areas In which<br />
assistance is required are the areas to which assistance goes, and that we<br />
do not destroy that self -reliance on which, really, Australia's future depends.<br />
This, I promise you, we will try to do. It Is not done<br />
overnight, but If it takes months to do, what of it, because If It Is done<br />
properly, then It will for decades after it has been done, justify the expenditure<br />
of those months and help our children and our grandchildren In this country.<br />
That Is and I have expanded on it mo re than I meant to do<br />
an indication of one of the problems which now lies before us. It is one of<br />
many because we must, in these decades ahead as well, continue to bring Into<br />
this country the immigrants which Mr Sne" den has been bringing In and must<br />
continue to bring in, in order to see that we become not in terms of numbers<br />
because In terms of number, no matter what our immigration policy is, we<br />
will never catch up In terms of numbers with the countries nearest to us, but<br />
to bring In sufficient to see that the technological advantages we now have,<br />
and the technological advances we will mae, which we call Into the balance<br />
to redress our lack of numbers, will have sufficient numbers to ensure that<br />
those advances will keep us in the forefront as we have been In the forefront<br />
in our region of the world.<br />
Bringing these people in I s not easy, Is not a matter of<br />
waving a wand, and is not inexpensive. Wle need, and we must do our best<br />
to ensure that In meeting these two problems I have already mentioned,<br />
in meeting the need for providing defence for this country which relatively,<br />
for the first time in its history, finds Itself, of itself, relatively defenceless,<br />
so to try to direct our efforts, that while we realise that we ourselves, by<br />
ourselves, cannot stand against some great world power, yet we can and<br />
have a responsibility to provide sufficient In the way of defence, to contribute<br />
to the stability of our neighbouring countries and to be able to take, ourselves,<br />
the first shock of any attack upon ourselves should it in the future come. I am<br />
not saying it will, but should It in the future come as In the past it has come,<br />
and as in the past It might have come much more seriously to take the first<br />
shock of that. And to believe, being able to do that, and having contributed e / 6 </p>
<p>-6<br />
to the alliances to which we are contributing that we could depend that<br />
having taking that first shock, we would be able to require, not as of right,<br />
but as of decency that those powers with more significant capacity than<br />
ourselves would then come In, should it be necessary, to help us. This is<br />
not cheap, this Is not inexpensive, this Is not easy.<br />
' ie have a requirement, of course, In our Industrial<br />
areas to try to see that we remove ourselves from the dependence that we<br />
have had In the past almost completely, and still for four-fifths completely,<br />
on primary produce to provide our overseas exchange; and so to foster<br />
not to denigrate primary produce but to foster alternative methods of<br />
exporting manufactured goods from this country to such countries as will<br />
take them. This Is not inexpensive and this Is not easy and this requires<br />
effort. I would If I had time, but I would weary you if I did,<br />
expand that list to Indicate the other things in the public sector which we<br />
need to do to expand the areas of education which today are such that if<br />
someone two decades ago had looked Into the future, they would have thought<br />
completely unattainable; to endeavour to see that the research already<br />
encouraged in Australia Is encouraged more so that we, and not some other<br />
country, get the benefits of inventions and of patents which come from within<br />
our own community; to try to endeavour to see that scientific activity<br />
generally In this country is directed towards an end which will quickly and<br />
immediately solve some of the problems in any field In which you care to<br />
look. This Is not cheap and this Is not inexpensive.<br />
These are just some, just a random grab-bag I put<br />
before you of the problems which now lie ahead of us, but problems which<br />
in great part have been created because of the advances we have made, you<br />
have made, and therefore not matters for despair, but rather matters for<br />
exhilaration because it is a growing nation which has these problems, not<br />
a stagnant nation, The fact that we have them indicates we are not stagnant,<br />
we are growing, we are moving into a future which, If we approach it In<br />
the way we approached it twenty years ago will, I believe bring benefits<br />
not just in arithmetical progression but in geometrical progression over what<br />
we know and what we grew up with.<br />
You may think, and If you do so, you are wrong that In<br />
presenting to you these problems which are before us, I present them in<br />
some spirit of worry. I do not. I merely put them before you because I<br />
believe It is possible, though I do not think it is so, but I believe It t3 possible<br />
after two decades of government, people may look back only to the problems<br />
which have been overcome, to the advances which have been made, and may<br />
lose their enthusiasm for attack on those which now exist and those which are<br />
still to be overcome. You would not be here, there would not have been, I<br />
think, so much support for the Liberal Party as there Is now In Australia if<br />
It were not true that most Australians are looking to the same approach as they<br />
have had I don't mean exactly the same approach the same principles<br />
as they have had applied. Perhaps some of them are looking for them to be<br />
applied in a new and imaginative way to overcome the uew and different<br />
problems which lie before us. It has been most encouraging I believe,<br />
certainly to myself, and I think to nearly all of us in the Federal Parliament<br />
to see this resurgence of Liberalism which will continue to have arguments,<br />
as an underscoring of the fact that the Australian people still want to advance<br />
and still want to advance with the same dynamo, with the same avoidance<br />
of the other side which has led to advances so far. </p>
<p>-7<br />
Let me conclude in this way; just as we attacked<br />
problems and overcame them before, so we will attack and overcome<br />
them in the next twenty years not as a reactionary party, not as a<br />
conservative party, but as a pragmatist party which examines problems<br />
and sees the best way to overcome them, and applies those approach es,<br />
and If those approaches don't work, then applies some other approach In<br />
order to reach the required objective.<br />
WNe are not and In spite of what has sometimes been<br />
said never have been a party which, using the word in Its proper sense,<br />
has been opposed to socialism, because socialism, using the word in Its<br />
pzoper sense, means social action for the benefit of the community as<br />
a whole. We have been prepared, of course, to apply social action for<br />
the benefit of the community as a whole, and you only need to look at the<br />
hospitals which are provided by social action, at the Irrigation systems<br />
which are provided, the roads which are provided, the railways, the post<br />
office, all those areas through social action, that Is through a government<br />
taking money from you and using It for social purposes that are applied for<br />
the benefit of the community as a whole. There are none of us, I think,<br />
who would object to this.<br />
What we do object to, what I believe we will fight to the<br />
death against is that conception of socialism which brought this party to<br />
Its first great success, the conception which said unequivocally The<br />
State does not exist to serve the IndtIvual; the S1tate does not exist to try<br />
to provide a climate In which the Individual Is able to expand himself In<br />
any way in which he sees fit, provided he doesn't exploit his fellow -beings.<br />
No. T1he individual exists to serve the State, which was the underlying<br />
concept of what was previously overthrown.<br />
W~ e object to that concept of socialism which says not:<br />
" Yes, we will use social action for the benefit of the community,' but" We<br />
will use social action to deny and prohibit and prevent an individual<br />
engaging in some particular form of activity in which we think he should<br />
not be allowedto engage. So we will stop him engaging In banking activities."<br />
We are prepared to compete with him In banking activities, but they say,<br />
" No. We will stop him engaging In It. Wle will stop him sowing wheat.<br />
We will stop him doing anything which our planners say he shouldn't do."<br />
This we oppose, and this would be the kiss of death for this country if ever<br />
It were accepted again. To me the great encouragement, and to my colleagues<br />
the great encouragement Is that all of -you here have come tonight as I<br />
believe, with the same general approach as the one I have sought to put<br />
before you, with the same willingness to work and sacrifice for that same<br />
general approach, and that you are multiplied outside this room, as I<br />
believe by a majority of Australans with that same general approach and<br />
with that same willingn~ ess to work for that general approach. Because If<br />
this impression of mine Is true, as I think it is, then I have no doubt<br />
whatever that we will In how many decades I don't know but we will<br />
become the Queen Continent of this Hemisphere, that we will have the<br />
material strength of the United States and the spiritual strength of Europe, and<br />
will be able to be a shining example of people who came to a harsh country<br />
and by effort conquered it, because only by effort can things be attained,<br />
and that we will In time not only see'the vision splendid of the sunlit<br />
plains extended", but attain'the vision splendid of the sunlit plains extended"<br />
together. </p>
