    <content><![CDATA[<p><strong>1 October 1986</strong></p>
<p>I warmly welcome today's announcement that President Reagan andÂ General Secretary Gorbachev will meet at Reykjavik, Iceland on 11Â and 12 October in-preparation for a full summit meeting in theÂ United StatesÂ later this year.</p>
<p>The announemntÂ confirms recent encouraging signs of anÂ improvement in the general atmosphere of East-West relations asÂ well as a strengthened commitment on both sides to look for waysÂ forward inÂ Â the arms control process. The prompt resolution ofÂ the Daniloff affair confirms both sides' interest in managingÂ East-West relations on a more constructive basis.</p>
<p>The ForeignÂ Minister, Mr Hayden has met leaders of bothÂ super-powersÂ during his current visit to the United Nations and Â has reported on the significantly improved mood in relationsÂ between them.</p>
<p>As I said in my recent address at the University of New EnglandÂ on 'Australia's Role in International Peace initiatives', thereÂ currently exist historic opportunities for the restoration ofÂ stability and realistic understanding between the superpowers onÂ nuclear weapons.</p>
<p>The Australian Government will continue to use all opportunitiesÂ to encourage progress in this direction.</p>
