    <content><![CDATA[<p><strong>1 October 1986</strong></p>
<p>I warmly welcome today's announcement that President Reagan and General Secretary Gorbachev will meet at Reykjavik, Iceland on 11 and 12 October in-preparation for a full summit meeting in the United States later this year.</p>
<p>The announemnt confirms recent encouraging signs of an improvement in the general atmosphere of East-West relations as well as a strengthened commitment on both sides to look for ways forward in  the arms control process. The prompt resolution of the Daniloff affair confirms both sides' interest in managing East-West relations on a more constructive basis.</p>
<p>The Foreign Minister, Mr Hayden has met leaders of both super-powers during his current visit to the United Nations and  has reported on the significantly improved mood in relations between them.</p>
<p>As I said in my recent address at the University of New England on 'Australia's Role in International Peace initiatives', there currently exist historic opportunities for the restoration of stability and realistic understanding between the superpowers on nuclear weapons.</p>
<p>The Australian Government will continue to use all opportunities to encourage progress in this direction.</p>
