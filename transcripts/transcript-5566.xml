FOR MEDIAFRIDAY, 10 APRIL, 1981<br />
SHAREHOLDINGS IN THE RUNDLE PROJECT 5~ 4.<br />
I.-<br />
I understand that Mr. Derryn Hinch, in his radio programme<br />
this morning, siated that the Minister for Business and<br />
Consumer Affairs, Mr. Moore, has held shares in companies<br />
associated with the Rundle project.<br />
There is an implication from Mr. Hinch's statements that<br />
Mr. Moore has done so since becoming a Minister and that<br />
there is an impropriety.<br />
Mr. Moore '-as assured me that, since he became a Minister<br />
last Nova-J. er, he has not personally held any shares in any<br />
of the c--ard-es associated with the Rundle project nor has<br />
he held anv such shares through any company, partnership or<br />
trust. sall number of these shares have been held for<br />
some 2-3 y-ears by his children but have not been traded since<br />
their acquisition.<br />
Clearly there has been no impropriety.<br />
I believe that Mr. Hinch has been irresponsible in making<br />
such imputations without any foundation.<br />
