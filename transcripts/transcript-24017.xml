    <content><![CDATA[<p>Former Australian Federal Police Commissioner Mr Tony Negus APM will become Australiaâs High Commissioner to Canada.Â </p>
<p>Mr Negus has had a distinguished career with the Australian Federal Police, serving most recently as Commissioner from 2009 to 2014.</p>
<p>In recognition of his contribution to our national security, Mr Negus was awarded the Australian Police Medal as well as awards from Indonesia, the United States and Interpol.</p>
<p>He has served on law enforcement boards including as Chairman of the Australian Crime Commission.Â Â </p>
<p>Mr Negus will take up his appointment in January 2015.</p>
<p>Australia and Canada are family.Â  We speak the same language and we share values and heritage.</p>
<p>We also share a common purpose as members of the coalition determined to defeat ISIL in Iraq.Â </p>
<p>Australia and Canada have long worked together in the United Nations for progress on non-proliferation, human rights and development.Â  Today, as members of the G20, we strive for credible global action to generate strong, job-creating growth â including most recently at the G20 summit in Brisbane.</p>
<p>We also have strong trade ties. Australia and Canada have enjoyed nine per cent annual growth in two-way investment.Â  In 2013 Australian investment in Canada was almost $54 billion, Canadian investment in Australia was $27 billion and bilateral trade was over $5Â billion.</p>
<p>
We thank outgoing High Commissioner Louise Hand for her work to strengthen Australiaâs relations with Canada since 2012.<br />
