CHANGE TO IWY PROGRAM<br />
The Prime Minister, Mr Whitlan, announced today<br />
that, when the financial allocation for International Women's<br />
Year activities was determined, it was also decided to review<br />
the proposed program of events for the remainder of the year.<br />
In keeping w~ th the program's original aims, preference will<br />
continue to be given to projects directed towards Australian<br />
women. One outcome of this review is that the United Nations<br />
Inter-Regional Seminar on Women, The Media and The Arts:<br />
The Communication of. 3Attitudes, which had been scheduled for<br />
Sydney at the end of the year, will not now take place.<br />
In conveying this decision to the Secretary-General'<br />

expressing its regret.<br />
