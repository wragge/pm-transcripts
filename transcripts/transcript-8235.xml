FOR MEDIA 13 DECEMBER 1990<br />
JOINT STATEMENT WITH THE MINISTER FOR ABORIGINAL AFFAIRS,<br />
THE HON ROBERT TICKNER NP<br />
The Government has given in principle support to a framework<br />
for advancing a process of reconciliation between Aboriginal<br />
and Torres Strait Islander people, and the wider community.<br />
The Government wishes to consult with the opposition and the<br />
Australian Democrats before releasing full details of the<br />
proposal. Under the proposal, the Government would establish a Council<br />
for Aboriginal Reconciliation composed of prominent<br />
Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Australians. The Council<br />
would play an educative and leadership role in bringing<br />
about a deeper understanding of the history, culture, past<br />
dispossession and continuing disadvantage of Aboriginal and<br />
Torres Strait Islander people.<br />
The Government believes there is considerable agreement in<br />
Australia that there needs to be a process of reconciliation<br />
between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal people. We believe<br />
such a process could lead to an instrument of reconciliation<br />
giving formal recognition to the place our indigenous people<br />
should hold in Australia. The Council for Aboriginal<br />
Reconciliation would initiate extensive community<br />
consultation on this matter and, most importantly, ascertain<br />
whether Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people believe<br />
the reconciliation process would be advanced by the<br />
development of a formal instrument.<br />
The Government's desire is that the process of<br />
reconciliation and the issues involved be considered<br />
thoroughly and thoughtfully by all Australians. We have<br />
sought to remove party politics from the Aboriginal Affairs<br />
portfolio and foster a bipartisan approach on Aboriginal<br />
issues so these important matters can be considered solely<br />
on their merits. The Government is pleased that the move<br />
has been strongly supported by political leaders across<br />
Australia, as well as by church and community groups.<br />
In honouring its commitment to work co-operatively on this<br />
issue, I have today contacted the Leader of the Opposition,<br />
Dr Hewson, and the Leader of the Australian Democrats,<br />
Senator Powell-, seeking consultation on the detail of the<br />
proposal for a process of reconciliation. The Minister for<br />
Aboriginal Affairs will conduct these discussions on behalf<br />
of the Government. </p>
<p>2.<br />
He will then initiate further consultation with the<br />
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and leaders in<br />
the wider community before final decisions are taken by the<br />
Government. The Government believes these proposals can build greater<br />
bridges of understanding between the first Australians and<br />
the wider community. We believe they can forge a better<br />
future for all Australians, but a future recognising and<br />
respecting the special place in this country of Aboriginal<br />
and Torres Strait Islander people. </p>
