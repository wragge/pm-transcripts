SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
PARLIAMENTARY DINNER IN HONOUR OF<br />
THE PRIME MINISTER OF PNG<br />
THE RIGHT HONOURABLE RABBIE NAMALIU<br />
CANBERRA, 2 SEPTEMBER 1991<br />
Prime Minister,<br />
Ministers, Distinguished Guests,<br />
Ladies and Gentlemen<br />
On behalf of the Government and the people of Australia, it<br />
gives me great pleasure to welcome Papua New Guinea's Prime<br />
Minister, the Right Honourable Rabbie Namaliu, and his wife<br />
Margaret, to Australia and to Canberra.<br />
We in Australia place great value on the warm, close and<br />
regular contacts which are well-established between Australia<br />
and Papua New Guinea. As two sovereign and independent<br />
nations, each pursuing our individual national objectives, we<br />
have built a close and valued partnership based upon shared<br />
values and mutual interests.<br />
This is, of course., your second official Prime Ministerial<br />
visit to Australia., Rabbie.<br />
Last year you and Margaret hosted a superb visit to PNG which<br />
will always be for both Hazel and me a treasured memory. A<br />
highlight of that visit was a trip to your beautiful home<br />
province. Ministers from both our countries took part in the Australia-<br />
Papua New Guinea Ministerial Forum which took place here in<br />
Canberra last February. I am especially pleased to see<br />
regular and routine Ministerial, Parliamentary and officials<br />
visits between our two countries.<br />
And I want to take this opportunity to say how much I<br />
personally value the warm contacts between you, Rabbie, and me<br />
over the past three years. </p>
<p>The relationship between our two countries is built firmly<br />
upon the strength of the interests we share. Fundamentally<br />
this means the strength of our bilateral political and<br />
economic linkages. But it also means, increasingly, seeing<br />
ourselves as partners-in the Asia-Pacific region, and working<br />
together to build our respective capacities to take advantage<br />
of and contribute to this region's dynamism.<br />
For Papua New Guinea, like Australia, this means looking<br />
outwards taking internal decisions consistent with a stable,<br />
open and internatiLonalised economy; developing a positive<br />
international profile through constructive contributions on<br />
regional and inter7national issues; and forming and<br />
strengthening strategic regional partnerships.<br />
Papua New Guinea's moves to diversify its political and<br />
economic relationships already reflect a growing international<br />
consciousness, and Australia recognises and welcomes this.<br />
In particular, we admire the way that you have built on your<br />
treaty of mutual respect, cooperation and friendship with<br />
Indonesia to deepen and strengthen your relations with your<br />
closest neighbour, and to work effectively with Indonesia to<br />
manage cooperatively the situation along your common border.<br />
This is an issue on which you and your government have shown<br />
statesmanship of a high order. We are grateful to you for it,<br />
because it will al. ways be important to us in Australia to see<br />
close cooperative relations between our two near neighbours.<br />
We see Papua New Guinea's candidature for the Presidency of<br />
the United Nations; General Assembly this year as also very<br />
much in line with this trend; and as a fitting reflection of<br />
Papua New Guinea's; international standing. Australia strongly<br />
supports Sir Micha~ el Somare ' 5 candidature, and we are working<br />
actively for its success.<br />
And by hosting the! forthcoming South Pacific Games, Papua New<br />
Guinea will contribute to developing a sense of regional<br />
cooperation through the important medium of sport. The<br />
impressive preparations underway for this major event reflect<br />
the spirit, energy and application of the people of Papua New<br />
Guinea. Australia wishes you all the very best for a<br />
successful Games.<br />
Under your leadership, Rabbie, PNG has achieved much at home<br />
too in recent years. I want to pay special tribute to the<br />
skill and persistence ' that you have shown in achieving this<br />
year the significant reforms to PNG's constitution for which<br />
you have strived so long. By giving PNG more stable<br />
government, these reforms are a major contribution to your<br />
nation's future. I know you have further reforms under way,<br />
and I wish you success with them. </p>
<p>We appreciate the magnitude of the difficulties you continue<br />
to face on Bougainville. Thanks to your government, PNG has<br />
managed the economic consequences of the crisis effectively.<br />
As you know, Australia firmly supports your Government's<br />
efforts to ensure your nation's integrity. Like you, we<br />
believe that any satisfactory resolution of the Bougainville<br />
situation must see Bougainville remain part of PNG. For that<br />
to be possible, some political solution must be found which<br />
will satisfy Bougainvillians' aspirations for more autonomy<br />
while maintaining PNG's sovereignty. Such a solution cannot<br />
be found by force. The resumption of talks on Bougainville is<br />
a good sign, and in our view a politically negotiated<br />
settlement remains the best way to achieve a comprehensive and<br />
enduring solution. We have already offered practical forms of<br />
assistance and we stand ready to assist in future.<br />
Like Australia, Papua New Guinea is rich in natural resources.<br />
And the immense potential of your country is still largely<br />
untapped. Great opportunities lie ahead for you, but it will<br />
be crucial to your long-term economic prosperity that you<br />
harness and manage your resources carefully. The Porgera Gold<br />
Mine, which I saw during my visit last year, the Chevronmanaged<br />
oil field and other mineral developments will lead to<br />
very substantial revenue flows by 1995-96. The right balance<br />
in investment and expenditure strategies will be the key to<br />
the effective long-term utilisation of your resource wealth.<br />
Investment promotion, such as your United States " Roadshow",<br />
will also contribute significantly to the creation of<br />
important investment and commercial partnerships for Papua New<br />
Guinea. But despite the pr. omise of many good things to come in the<br />
future, we cannot underestimate the enormity of the problems<br />
and challenges that face Papua New Guinea right now in social<br />
and economic devel~ opment. The problems are, of course, for<br />
you to resolve, just as it will be for you to reap the rewards<br />
of meeting and ovetrcoming the challenges that face you.<br />
Prime Minister,<br />
I know from our many conversations on this subject, and from<br />
the evidence of the work you have set in train within your own<br />
Government, of thE-committed approach you are taking to Papua<br />
New Guinea's sericous law and order problems. Both our<br />
Governments understand the need for security if development is<br />
to proceed, and for development if security is to be<br />
maintained. I heartily endorse: your Government's decision to give priority<br />
to law and order and internal security and to provide a<br />
comprehensive plan. of action in the context of your<br />
forthcoming budget that will see a shift of resources to the<br />
areas of real need.<br />
We recognise, as I know you do, that hard decisions and strong<br />
leadership will be required to create for PNG the institutions<br />
it needs to meet its current urgent law and order needs. </p>
<p>As I said to you today, Australia's commitment to your<br />
country' s sovereignty and independence means that we cannot,<br />
and would not, presume to tell your Government how Papua New<br />
Guinea should org anise its law and order priorities and<br />
programs. But we are very willing to cooperate with you in areas where<br />
we can best help, and where your government takes the lead in<br />
establishing commitments and setting priorities.<br />
That is why I am pleased that we have signed today an Agreed<br />
Statement on Security Cooperation which sets out clearly the<br />
principles under which we cooperate, the priority areas for<br />
our assistance, and new procedures which will ensure that all<br />
our cooperation in this area is part of a comprehensive,<br />
integrated and planned approach to internal security.<br />
Australia and Papuia New Guinea, as partners, neighbours and<br />
friends, share a relationship based on firm and unshakable<br />
foundations. The conclusion of the Joint Declaration of<br />
Principles in December 1987 provided a comprehensive framework<br />
for the conduct of our relations now, and into the next<br />
century. The Treaty on Development Cooperation, concluded in May 1989,<br />
has laid the groundwork for the more professional delivery of<br />
development assistance. One of the major tasks facing us now<br />
is to ensure the right content and balance of development<br />
assistance to ensure the maximum long-term benefits. In line<br />
with Papua New GuiLnea's stated goal of achieving fiscal selfreliance,<br />
AustraliLa and Papua New Guinea have together<br />
reaffirmed our shared commitment to the gradual phasing out of<br />
budget support by the year 2000. At the same time,<br />
Australia's project aid to Papua New Guinea will increase<br />
forging mutually beneficial links between our two countries<br />
based on focused and practical assistance directly related to<br />
your specific development needs.<br />
I am confident that with continuing close cooperation between<br />
us on these issues, we can achieve the best possible<br />
arrangements to carry us into the next century.<br />
The nature of the relationship between Australia and Papua New<br />
Guinea, solid and enduring though it is, is changing, and will<br />
continue to change into the 90s and next century. The habit<br />
of dependence has been well and truly broken. New generations<br />
will develop different perceptions of each other from those<br />
which marked, and sometimes marred, earlier relations between<br />
our countries. Both our countries will look increasingly<br />
outward to devel. oping and strengthening our place in the<br />
world and this can only enrich and strengthen our own<br />
bilateral relations. </p>
<p>At the political level, I believe we have gone a long way to<br />
developing close and cooperative contacts within a more mature<br />
relationship. But I would very much like to see this<br />
translated across the full spectrum of our contacts<br />
including between business people, young political leaders,<br />
and academics. I am pleased to see increased sporting<br />
contacts between us and especially we look forward to the<br />
forthcoming Kangaroo tour of Papua New Guinea.<br />
As in any partnership between two independent nations, there<br />
will be times when our interests diverge. This is nothing to<br />
be afraid of. We both recognise our legitimate rights to act<br />
in our own national interests as we see them. But Papua New<br />
Guinea can be assured that the solid foundations of our<br />
relationship remain secure, and that Australian commitment to<br />
the relationship is enduring. </p>
