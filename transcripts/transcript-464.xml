    <content><![CDATA[<p><strong>P. M. No. 22/ 1962</strong></p>
<p>AUSTRALIA AND WEST NEW GUINEA<br /> </p>
<p>There are plenty of words in Mr. Calwell's statement, but not much common sense or, for that matter, understanding of the facts. I will deal briefly with his central proposition, the<br />" key note" so to speak, around which the whole of his very long<br />statement turns. It is that " if Indonesia seeks Lo usa force<br />to create a potential threat to Australia's security, then I say,<br />with all due regard to the gravity of the situation, that the<br />threat must be faced".<br />What does this mean?<br />If it means that Australia should be ready and willing<br />to protect its own territories, i. e. Australian New CG'in: oa and<br />Papua, the answer is that I said so in plain terms in<br />statement of Government policy on January 12th a state. cent<br />which stands. If his statement means that an Australian gcvernment<br />should convey in relevant quarters its views against agr. cession<br />and in favour of self-determination, the aswer is that rcmy own<br />Government has done so on vjry many occasions by personal contact<br />and through diplomatic channels, over the last 12 months and<br />indeed long before that. This applies not only to the Netherlands<br />and Indonesia but also to the United Kingdom and the U. S. A. with<br />whom we have had very frequent exchanges. ie have also maintained<br />close contact with the Secretariat of the United Nations. It<br />would not be proper for me to state the attitude of either the<br />government of the United Kingdom or the administration of the<br />U. S. A. But they are most familiar with our desire that every<br />possible pressure should be exercised to deter the use of force.<br />If Mr. Calwell's statement means that, without any<br />regard to what might be the attitude or action of these great<br />powers, Australia should, in the event of armed Indonesian<br />aggression against Dutch Now Guinea, declare war against<br />Indonesia, it is clearly crazy and irresponsible.<br />For it is the inoscapable fact that, though we have<br />throughout recognised Dutch sovereignty in West New Guinea, every<br />nation in Asia supports the Indonesian claim.<br />Mr. Calwoll's vaguely bellicose attitudes do nothing but<br />harm. No nation has more to gain by peace and the peaceful and<br />just settlomant of disputes in and around South East Asia than<br />Australia. No nation has given clearer evidence of its attachment<br />to the principle that under-developed peoples should have, after<br />adequate and helpful preparation, the choice of their own future.<br />No country has done more in an endeavour to secure a persuasion of<br />Indonesia against the use of force.<br />Whatever the result may be and we do not despair of a<br />peaceful and just solution Mr. Calwell appears determined to<br />create an atmosphere which would make it difficult in future to<br />live in a state of harmony with our neighbours.<br />To call our policy and actions " appeasement" is to<br />trifle with the facts and to gamble with the future of our<br />country.</p>
