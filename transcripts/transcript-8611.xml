Joint statement by the Prime Minister, the<br />
Hon P J Keating, and the Minister for Land<br />
Transport, the Hon Bob Brown MP.<br />
PRIME MINISTER ANNOUNCES START TO $ 181 MILLION<br />
OF ONE NATION NATIONAL RAIL NETWORK PROJECTS<br />
The reality of ' One Nation: one national rail freight system' came a step closer today.<br />
Prime Minister Paul Keating and Federal Land Transport Minister, Bob Brown,<br />
announced Federal Government funding of $ 181 million as an initial instalment in a<br />
program of mainline rail tmprovements around the country as part of the One Nation<br />
jobs creation and economic package.<br />
The release of One Nation rail fundmg coincided with today's official opening by Mr<br />
Keating of th e ational Rail Corporation headquarters at Parramatta. The Corporation<br />
has adopted the business name ' National Rail'.<br />
Mr Keating and Mr Brown said formation of National Rail with participating states as<br />
shareholders, and the massive reinvestment planned for the national railway network was<br />
a response to Australia's need to re-equip and restructure its institutions to meet the<br />
future economic and social needs of the Australian community.<br />
' A responsible acceleration of infrastructure investment can directly boost employment in<br />
the short term, while improving the economy's long-term growth potential', they said.<br />
The projects announced today are the first stage of the $ 454 million national rail network<br />
investment program contained in the Federal Government's One Nation economic<br />
statement, which aims to generate more than 6000 rail reconstruction jobs directly in the<br />
next two vears. A further 6000 jobs will be created indirectly.<br />
A total of 18 projects and groups of projects has been approved. A list of these is<br />
attached. Detailed planning is continuing on other projects, which are likely to be<br />
approved during the coming months. / 2<br />

<p>In addition, the NSW Government has agreed to guarantee<br />
AN access to the Broken Hill-Parkes line until September<br />
1997 to allow the Indian Pacific continued use of that<br />
route after standardisation of the Melbourne-Adelaide<br />
line. ADELAIDE 9 August 1992 1135<br />

These projects, together with establishment of National Rail to take control of all<br />
interstate rail freight operations, will help remove the physical and parochial barriers that<br />
have long inhibited the efficiency and competitiveness of the national rail network', Mr<br />
Keating and Mr Brown said.<br />
' Federal Government approval for the initial projects has been subject to a commitment<br />
by the ACTU, rail unions and the Corporation to a greenfields enterprise award under<br />
which NRC employees would work.<br />
' The enterprise award will provide the basis for a new, more productive work<br />
environment where all company employees can focus on quality customer service.<br />
National Rail's first corporate plan, approved recently by the company shareholders,<br />
targets unit cost reductions of 45 per cent.<br />
' It also targets a market share increase of 10 per cent during the next five years', they<br />
said. Mr Keating and Mr Brown said the One Nation rail program would, for the first time in<br />
Australia's history, provide a uniform gauge rail track linking all mainland state capitals<br />
and Alice Springs.<br />
Projects on the Sydney-Brisbane and Sydney-Melbourne corridors comprise the design<br />
and replacement of bridges, track upgrading and new sleepers. Melbourne-Adelaide<br />
gauge standardisation will involve design work for the section between Melbourne and<br />
the South Australian border, conversion of broad gauge track from Ararat to the border<br />
and construction from the border to Adelaide.<br />
Connections to ports include a standard gauge connection to the Port of Brisbane at<br />
Fisherman Islands, upgrading of the South Dynon ship-rail container terminal and a<br />
direct road link to the Port of Melbourne, and design of the Outer Harbour terminal in<br />
Adelaide. Overall, crossing loops, track upgrading and gauge standardisation over rail corridors<br />
from Brisbane to Perth will require the purchase of significant quantities of rail and<br />
concrete sleepers from local manufacturers. Initial contracts for the supply of some 3000<br />
tonnes of heavy 60 kg rail and one million concrete sleepers are being let.<br />
