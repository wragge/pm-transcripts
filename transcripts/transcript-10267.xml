Fax from 12 March 1997 TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
THE HON JOHN HOWARD, MP<br />
DOORSTOP INTERVIEW ECHUCA<br />
E&amp; OE I.<br />
I'd like to start this river-side press conference by inviting all of the community groups<br />
of Echuca and the surrounding districts, the local service clubs, interested businesses<br />
and other community organisations to participate in and get behind the Government's<br />
work for the dole scheme. It does have a lot of strong support. It is seen as one of the<br />
ways of tackling the problem of unemployment and I hope that this district contributes<br />
mightily to the community effort to get behind the scheme. The details of it were<br />
endorsed yesterday. We'll be introducing the legislation nexct week. I want to know<br />
where the other parties stand. Are they for or against changing the Act so that people<br />
can be required to do some work in return for the dole? That's the major change that<br />
we're proposing and I don't want any of this shilly shally-ing around of, you know,<br />
' we'll try and amend it but we'll sort of let it through but we'll still reserve the right to<br />
knock it off'. Now are they for or against it? We're for it, are they against it? I think<br />
the Australian people want to know where they stand.<br />
JOURNALIST: ( inaudible)... . Mr Beazley says that the Labor Party will pass the legislation but he has<br />
attacked it as unfair, He was suggesting that young people, young unemployed in<br />
Woollstonecraft would get to lie in in bed in the morning.<br />
PRIME NMNISTER:<br />
Well I don't know why he's dragging Wollstonecrall into it. Is he, sort of; trying to<br />
get some kind of class jealousy into this. Unemployed people are the same all around<br />
Australia and what we are fairly doing, fairly doing, is to focus initially on those areas<br />
of very high unemployment. There's absolutely no intention on our part to advantage<br />
one particular group of unemployed people, that is absurd class prejudice and I'm<br />
rather disappointed that my opponent should have brought such elements into a debate<br />
about an important national issue. I just want to know whether they are for or against<br />
the compulsory element. Because I keep reading where they're going to let the<br />
Faoxr' ~ 12/ 03/ 97 18: 03 Pg: 1 </p>
<p>Fax from legislation through but they're against compulsion. Well you can't have it both ways,<br />
you're either for or against the compulsory element and I'd like to know precisely<br />
what their position is on that aspect of it.<br />
JOURNALIST: ( inaudible).. your actuarial advisory committee that you set up last year was to report<br />
on the Super surcharge on October the<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
The which, P'm sorry?<br />
JOURNALIST: ( inaudible).. . the actuarial advisery committee set up to look into the super surcharge.<br />
Nick Sherry says that you are holding the information from that back because it was<br />
damning, and he says that the super surcharge wasn't viable. Is this true?<br />
PRIME rMISTER.-<br />
I haven't the faintest idea. You'll have to ask Peter Costello that. I don't know<br />
what's happened to that committee.<br />
JOURNALIST: .( inaudible). Are you going to release your legal advice on the superannuation<br />
surcharge? PRIM MINISTER:<br />
Well whatever Peter Costello said about that this morning is the Government's<br />
response. He made it clear that like any other piece of legislation we got advice that it<br />
was constitutional. I think he also said that in the light of the opinion that was tabled<br />
yesterday he's seeking further advice. But our position is that this is a fair measure.<br />
The Labor Party is trying to destroy a fair element of the budget. The Labor Party is<br />
trying to reduce the budget to a document that only effects middle and low income<br />
earners in the Australian community. What kind of Australian justice is that?<br />
JOURNALIST: You say you're not going to back down but Peter Costello says he's going to review<br />
the advice. If the advice tells him it is unconstitutional, are you going to back down?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
You heard what I said yesterday.<br />

Mr Howard can you give an iron clad assurance that Super members on less than<br />
000 won't have to pay this surcharge?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I can give you an iron clad assurance that we will implement the policy announced by<br />
the Treasurer on budget night.<br />
JOURNALIST: How are you going to ensure that people submit their tax file numbers though so that<br />
people PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Oh look, I'm not going to give a detailed commentary on administrative matters. But<br />
what I am going to do is to firstly assert the fairness of the measures, secondly,<br />
condemn the Labor Party for trying to sabotage a fair measure, and thirdly repeat that<br />
when we put the legislation together we were told it was perfectly constitutional-<br />
JOURNALIST: ( Inaudible) But Mr Howard, estimates say that enforcing tax file numbers being<br />
lodged will cost a great deal of money to the Government or to Superannuation<br />
companies which they are not going to.,<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well of course superannuation funds are speaking out of self-interest. What the<br />
superannuation fu~ nds want is to encumber every business man and woman in this<br />
country with administrative complexities. The superannuation funds are talking out of<br />
their pockets on this issue. They are a section of the Australian economy that has<br />
privileged access to the resources of Australians because superannuation contributions<br />
are compulsory. They have been against this from day one because it effects them.<br />
Now, there's nothing high and mighty or altruistic about that. I mean, let's call a<br />
spade a spade. The funds are trying to destroy this because it effects them. I'm trying<br />
to defend it because it's fair.<br />
JOURNALIST: ( Inaudible) Does it concern you being on the Murray today to know that in the future<br />
it may be controlled by small Australians<br />
PRI[ ME MINISTER:-<br />
Yes it does. I think the water of this nation belongs to all Austraians. And the notion<br />
that one group of Australians should own water and that other Australians should be </p>
<p>Fax from 12/ 03/ 97 18: 03 Pg: 4<br />
tenants of that ownership is quite unacceptable. The water of the nation belongs to the<br />
entire nation.<br />
JOURNALIST; ( Inaudible)<br />
PRIMIE MINISTER:<br />
Well, we are looking at the whole Native Title issue at the present time and I'm not<br />
going to sort of respond in a piece-meal fashion. I know it's a difficult problem. I'm<br />
addressing it. I'm going to produce a result that is fair to everybody.<br />
JOURNALIST: ( Inaudible)<br />
PRIME MINISTER.-<br />
Well I expressed my concern the other day about certain people who couldn't get legal<br />
aid and it's quite wrong that if the situation is that some people involved can get legal<br />
but others can't.<br />
JOURNALIST: ( Inaudible)<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well it could be made fair.<br />
JOURNALIST; ( Inaudible)<br />
PRIM1E MINISTER:<br />
( inaudible).... Well, we're just looking at the possibility of it because there has been a<br />
great improvement in it. But it hasn't got beyond that and you really have to pursue<br />
that with the Defence Minister, I don't have all the details I'm sorry.<br />
JOURNALIST: ( Inaudible)<br />
PRIE MINITER:<br />
The clubs? Yes. </p>
<p>Fax from 12/ 03/ 97 18: 03 Pg:<br />
JOURNALIST: ( Inaudible)<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well we don't intend to tax clubs.<br />
JOURNALIST: ( Inaudible)<br />
PRIME MINISTER;<br />
Well, we don't intend to do it.<br />
JOURNALIST: ( Inaudible)<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well I've generally followed it. Have you got a general question about it?<br />
JOURNALIST: ( Inaudible)<br />
PRIM MINISTER:<br />
Well that's something that will be looked at in the budget context.<br />
JOURNALIST: ( Inaudible)<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, I mean, we're sympathetic. Bruce Reid talks to me about it every week. He<br />
never gives me any peace on it. But we've got to look at in the budget.<br />
JOURNALIST: ( Inaudible)<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Yeah sure, go ahead. </p>
<p>Fax from JOURNALIST: ( Inaudible)<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well we want a system which is fair. I would be concerned if under Native Title<br />
procedures a claimant had legal aid but a respondent didn't and we will do something<br />
about that if that is the case. We'll have a level playing field dare I use that dreaded<br />
expression. JOURNALIST: ( Inaudible)<br />
PRHME MIlNISTER:<br />
Well, what I will do is have a far approach to legal aid. What that far approach<br />
involves is that people are on an equal footing. And at the moment many farmers and<br />
local government groups claim they are not and I expressed my concern about that the<br />
other day when I2 was asked this question. And if that is the case and I'm having it<br />
investigated further then I will do something to make it fair.<br />
Thank you. Fa rom12/ 03/ 97 18: 03 Pg: 6 </p>
