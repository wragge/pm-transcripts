PARIS TALKS PROCEED<br />
Comment in the House of Representatives by the<br />
Prime Minister, Mr. John Gorton<br />
I welcome the fact that as a result of discussions<br />
between the United States and the Republic of Vietnam, the way<br />
is now open for talks to proceed in Paris.<br />
As I informed the House on 5 November, Australia<br />
had already advised the South Vietnam Government that we felt<br />
their interests would be best served by their representatives<br />
attending the talks in Paris. I am therefore glad that as the outcome<br />
of talks between the United States and the Government of the Republic<br />
of Vietnam an understanding has been reached that clears the way<br />
for the Government of the Republic of Vietnam to take part.<br />
The Australian Government has always regarded it<br />
as essential that the position of the Republic of Vietnam should be<br />
safeguarded both in the conduct of hostilities and in any moves to<br />
bring those hostilities to an end.<br />
For the information of the House, I present copies of<br />
the statements issued in Saigon and Washington a few hours ago.<br />
CANBERRA 26 November 1968 </p>
