AUSTRALIA<br />
PRIME MINISTER Press Statement No. 457<br />
22 February 1975<br />
SENATE VACANCY<br />
Mr Lewis will be flouting the unanimous wishes of<br />
the Senate, the Parliamentary Liberal Party in Canberra and<br />
now the Liberal Party Federal Executive if he goes ahead with<br />
his defiance of convention in filling the Senate vacancy.<br />
It is apparent to everyone except Mr Lewis and<br />
the more backward elements of the Country Party that<br />
conventions of this kind must be preserved if our democratic<br />
parliamentary system is to survive.<br />
The fact that the Liberal Party Federal Executive<br />
has had to hedge its support for the convention is clearly<br />
the result of the difficulties in which Mr Snedden has<br />
placed it by his inability to do anything but lead his party<br />
from behind. The appointment of a Senator by a State is not<br />
an " internal affair" of the State. It is something which,<br />
unless carried out in accordance with Australia-wide custom,<br />
can disrupt the whole Parliamentary, system.<br />
Events of the last week have demonstrated just how<br />
ineffective the Liberals would be if they were in government<br />
in Canberra. On two major issues affecting the Australian<br />
constitution, they have been unable to get the co-operation<br />
of the Country Party and the two Liberal-Country Party Premiers.<br />
Mr Lewis has disregarded Mr Snedden over the Senate<br />
replacement; Mr Bjelke-Petersen has disregarded Mr Snedden<br />
over the way in wHich Australia's overseas trade should be<br />
conducted. It is clear that the Liberal and Country Party are<br />
at odds with the Australian Parliament and the Leader of the<br />
Liberal Party is unable to secure co-operation of the Premiers<br />
of New South Wales and Queensland.<br />
If Mr Snedden can't get-the Premiers to agree with<br />
him on matters involving the propriety of appointments to the Australian<br />
Parliament and the conduct of foreign trade, how hopeless<br />
would he be facing the more difficult tasks of government.<br />
