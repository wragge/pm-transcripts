PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIP? OF ITERVIEW WITH MARIO D'ORAZIO, 6WF, 28 Janutry 1986<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
D'ORAZIO: Good morning Mr. Hawke.<br />
PM: Good morning Mario.<br />
D'ORAZIO: Well, bow do you feel the election campaign<br />
is shapiriK up for Brian Burke<br />
PM: Very Well. That's as it should be because<br />
a number of reasons. Firstly, his performance has been<br />
outstanding. Last three years Australia has been<br />
turned right around from recession into the most<br />
rapidly growing economy in the Western World. This<br />
has been again recogni., sed internationally,<br />
and within that overall Australian performance<br />
the West Australian performance has been quite<br />
outstanding, above the national average. If I<br />
can use the current Jargon, has the runs very much<br />
on the board. And he is going to the people with<br />
constructive policies for a continuation of that<br />
outstanding success. Against that, what the people<br />
of Western Australia are offered total negativism<br />
and smeaur-campaigns. I don't believe they are<br />
uoffering a serious alternative and of course they<br />
are faction ridden, divided against themselves.<br />
They. Mr. Hassell, Mr. Howard are at odds on<br />
basic issues like interest rates, privatisation.<br />
The Liberals haven't won an election in mainland<br />
Australia since 1980, and they're not going to<br />
break their duck here in WA in 1986.<br />
D'ORAZIO: So you think the Burke government will be<br />
returned, despite the liabil-ity that land rights<br />
poses for you<br />
PM: Well, I'm not sure that it does pose a liability.<br />
I believe that he's made the position and I believe<br />
his position Is understood and accepted by the majority<br />
of Western Australians.<br />
D'ORAZIO: I would have thought the liability for him<br />
waG the fact that there's a lot of pressure in your<br />
gov. rn,( ejt to introduce uniform land rights. </p>
<p>2<br />
PM: Well, you see Mario, one of the things that<br />
fascinates me about Australiani politics i3 how*<br />
commentators, like yourself, get well paid Lo talk<br />
about affairs, but don't seem to understand your<br />
basic facts. What we have sald is Lhat we were,<br />
the first situation, where the States handled this<br />
matter themselves. Holding has made iL clear that<br />
we have looked at this generally, general ideas about<br />
it. We have talked and he's talking Lo the States<br />
and various interested bodies to try and get a<br />
situation where the States will handle this matter<br />
in accordance with those general principles. And<br />
he's in the process of having discussions around<br />
Australia with various State Governmuents, interest<br />
troups and Mr. Burke has made his positioit clear.<br />
I understand that. And I believe that we're going<br />
to be able to resolve this matter in a way which iG<br />
acceptable and we'll recognise the rights of WA.<br />
I would also make this point-I find it rather<br />
annoying that when people are talking about what<br />
governments are going to do for Aboriginal people.<br />
They talk about land rights and forgeL that there<br />
is so much that has to be done in Lhe areas of<br />
health and education and those sorLs of things<br />
which in many senses is much more important to<br />
Aboriginals than the question of land rights.<br />
D'ORAZIO: The mining community is very concerned<br />
about the question of land rights. Another maLtcr<br />
that they are also very worried about is, which<br />
featured very prominently in advertisements in today's<br />
press, is the gold tax. What's the latesL situation<br />
there, will you be introducing one<br />
PM: Well, what we've done is to set up an indvpendent<br />
inquiry, in the person of Gerry Gutman. And he will be<br />
investigating this issue of course, asud taking<br />
submissions from interest parties, which include<br />
particularly the gold mining industry In WA and the<br />
WA Govt. And I was able to indicate yesterday Mario<br />
that I understand that MR. Mr'-4 is prepared to<br />
extend the period of inquiry, including the periodM. T. C. </p>
<p>3<br />
for the taking of submissions. . And that means that<br />
it is certain that the WA private secLur and Government<br />
will have a full opportunity Lu prepare and present<br />
their case and I made it clear to Mr. Burke LhaL they<br />
will be given particular consideratiuon, because it's<br />
a most important issue for Western Australia. They'll<br />
have full opportunity to devv. lop, prepare and put their<br />
case when Mr. Gutman reports we'll consider thaL report.<br />
D'. ORAZIO: What's your inclination though.-Do you feel<br />
there's a strong case to exempt Western Australia from<br />
that sort of a tax.<br />
PM: Well, I think there's a strung case to examine<br />
whether there should be a tax and I would think' that<br />
the WA industry itself would accept there's a strong<br />
case for investigating it. They think there's an even<br />
stronger case for having investigated it, that there<br />
shouldn't be one. But I don't think thuL anyone would<br />
argue that we have a situation where you have one<br />
industry which is exempted from the tax, and the<br />
economics of the environment within that was donehas<br />
changed, they wouldn't, so there shouldn'L be &amp; n<br />
examination of that. But, well, as to whether, after<br />
that examination we do or do not depends on that report.<br />
It is independent. I have no idea what will come out<br />
of Mr. Gutman's examination.<br />
D'ORAZIO: So the gold tax is by no means definite.<br />
PM: Well, you can't say it's-definiLe when you've<br />
established an independent inquiry into it.<br />
D'ORAZIO: One of the other issues that's troubling<br />
the State Government at the moment has been the<br />
question of interest rates. And most people have<br />
agreed that the State Government is fairly powerless<br />
to do anything about that and they point to oversean<br />
factors and the way the Federal Giovernment has handled<br />
that. Can you see any respite fur people who'vc<br />
got mortgages<br />
PM: Well, certainly here in Western Australia as a<br />
result of the decision taken by the WA Government, there<br />
has been a protection of their position. As far as<br />
the movement in interest rates it concerned, M. T. C.<br />
A </p>
<p>4<br />
Mr. Burke has pointed to the fact that the range<br />
of independent economic coiiiuicntators suggested<br />
that the iaterest rates had peaked and will come<br />
down and it's appropriate for him to point to<br />
those assessments. But all I can say is that I'm<br />
not going to, myself, enter Into that in any further<br />
detail, because I du'L think that's appropriate.<br />
I just want to make Lhe more general point, which is<br />
the relevant on-e, that Australians, I think<br />
they are very sophisticated now in their analysis<br />
of the econoumy and what's happening. And they<br />
understand that there's no point in looking just<br />
at interest rates, but look at the whole of the<br />
GovernmentiL's economic policy. I think that<br />
they Lake very considerable pride in the fact that<br />
we in Australia, which has again been recognised<br />
this week internationally, the top of the international<br />
performance board for the economic management of<br />
this country.<br />
D'ORAZIO: Well, if your economic policies seem<br />
to be working surely we can express some confidence<br />
about uinterest rates levelling off in the next<br />
Six months or so.<br />
PM: Well I think it's appropriate that people<br />
should analyse what's happening. Look at the<br />
latest indicaLtors. Look at the strengthening of<br />
the dollar and what's happeni'ng in money supply<br />
terms, reduction in the growth and rate of money<br />
supply, and appropriatec for them 0to be drawing<br />
their conclusions. All I'm saying Mario is that<br />
I don't want at this point to be coming out ahead<br />
of tlhose developments. I am happy with the way<br />
things are going-leLt me put it that way.<br />
D'ORAZIO: Two issues that concern the rural electorates<br />
in WA are transport in petrol prices and, of course,<br />
the pihosphate issue. I read a report that suggested<br />
that perhaps the drop in fuel prices would not be<br />
cvumpletely passed on. Why was that<br />
PM: I siniply said that the government will be<br />
looking at this issue In it's normal review, There M. T. C. </p>
<p>5<br />
has to be a decision from the 1st March. An4 when you,<br />
the Government, look at that, look at what's happened<br />
to international fuel prices, because they've fallen<br />
very substantially and in the regiment, if you like,<br />
that we take account of, is mixture 80-20 of spot<br />
price and official price, so you've got to look at<br />
what's happening on the spot market and the<br />
official price of Saudi Arabian light crude. So LhaL's<br />
one factor, what's happening to crude prices<br />
internationally. The second is what's happening<br />
to the exchange rate. Now at this stage, what's<br />
happening on the international crude market, that<br />
would suggest, you know, reductions. I simply sounded<br />
the note of caution if you like. But with the sortu<br />
of very massive reductions in crude prices that<br />
people were predicting for this period up until<br />
March, those sorts of reductions, if just automatically<br />
passed on, would mean very, very signaifiLcant losses<br />
of revenue for the government from its application<br />
of policy which has beeoon bipartisan. I mean, this<br />
was Introduced by our predecessuors, import parlty<br />
pricing policy. Now the government will have to<br />
take all those factors into account. That's all I've<br />
said. D'ORAZIO: Can we expect any sort of discounts at<br />
all PM: What happens In discount'ing at the pump is basically<br />
a question for decision by the oil companies. That's<br />
a matter for decision by them. Discounting is not<br />
a result of<br />
D'ORAZIO: What I meant was if you were to pass on<br />
your savings, can we expect to see azny cut in the take<br />
of the Federal Govertnment<br />
PM: I'm simply saying to you that we will be<br />
undertaking the review of this policy, well, not a<br />
review of this policy, a review of the pricing according<br />
to the requirements we Imposed upon ourselves and<br />
looking at this each two months. That's the sixt<br />
decision, due for the 1st March. All the factors<br />
I've referred to will be taken into account and we<br />
will, ag in all areas of policy, be making M. T. C. </p>
<p>6-<br />
the decision best calculated to be of benefit to<br />
Australian consumers in all aspects.<br />
D'ORAZIO: Mr. Hawke. About two or three weeks. ago<br />
the Premier returned to WA to headlines of great<br />
victory to WA farmers. And this was over the<br />
phosphate question. It seems that some commentatrs<br />
believe that the decision that you made then might<br />
be overturned over the next year or so.<br />
PM: Oh well. As 1 say I'm fascinated by the<br />
commentators in this area. They, most of them,<br />
speak from a vast reservoir of ignorance.<br />
It is always fascinating to see what comes out of<br />
that sort of basis. The facts are very simple.<br />
Under legislation, anti-dumping legislation which<br />
has been imposed for many, many years now and has<br />
been acted upon by both sides In government, dhdiœ<br />
that legislation a decision was made to impose an<br />
anti-dumping duty and that was appropriate under the<br />
legislation. Now, Mr. Burke, in an electoral context,<br />
he had a problem. No one can hide that and he<br />
came to see me In a situatlon where Cabinet was not<br />
meeting again until 20Lh January and I had the<br />
two relevant Ministers there. Andl said well we've<br />
got this issue put before us, I think we need to do<br />
something because we didn't wanL to have a situation<br />
where, as a result of the decision that was required<br />
under the legislation, farmers were particularly<br />
adversely hurt. Now we simply'had the WA situation<br />
put before us. I made, in consultation with my<br />
colleagues, a decision to give that relief and did<br />
it in the clear statement and Intention that the<br />
position as whole would be considered by Cabinet<br />
when it resumed on the 20th January. We considered<br />
it then and we will move to give rvlief t farmers<br />
generally. And we've spoken to the National F4ariaers<br />
Federation and they've agreed in that sort of<br />
context where we've indicated we'd give that relief,<br />
to look at the whole question of the super phosphate<br />
industry In this country and the Natiuztul Farmers<br />
Federation are going to be involved with us in that<br />
review. M. T. C. </p>
<p>7<br />
D'ORAZIO: A lot of people would have said that<br />
perhaps you may not have extended that relief<br />
had there not been such an outcry from other<br />
statA. PM: Well, some people might say that, but some<br />
people wuuld be wrong.<br />
D'ORAZIO: Mr. Prime Minister thank you for talking<br />
to us this morning.<br />
PM: O. K. Mario, it's been a pleasure. Thank you<br />
very much.<br />
