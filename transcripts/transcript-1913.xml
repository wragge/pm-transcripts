COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA<br />
SPEECH BY<br />
The Rt Hon. J. G. GORTON, M. P.<br />
ON<br />
APPROPRIATION BILL ( No. 1) 1968-69<br />
Second Reading<br />
( BUDGET DEBATE)<br />
[ From the ' Parliamentary Debates', 27 August 1968]<br />
Mr GORTON ( Higgins-Prime Minister)<br />
, D: 8. O]-This House has been asked, in the<br />
farm of an amendment moved by the<br />
Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Whitlam), to<br />
express the opinion that the Budget is<br />
inadequate. I am sure the House will do<br />
nothing of the kind and, indeed, I believe<br />
that* the only thing inadequate connected<br />
with the Budget is the speech upon it made<br />
by the Leader of the Opposition. The<br />
presentation of a Budget gives to an opposition<br />
the opportunity to analyse a government's<br />
assessment of the state of the economy.<br />
It gives the opportunity to criticise<br />
P Ãµ ~ e objectives of the Government, to criti-<br />
-cise its economic policy and to question the<br />
methods by which a government seeks to<br />
attain those objectives. It is perhaps significant<br />
that virtually no -attempt was made<br />
the Leader of the Opposition to use those<br />
~ pportunities. Instead we listened : to a<br />
speech which began with shallow and baseless<br />
generalities, which proceeded to quote<br />
misleading statistics to buttress an unsustain-<br />
21691/ 68 able argument and which complained of a<br />
lack of statistical information, although that<br />
information was publicly available, and publicly<br />
available to him. It was indeed-this<br />
has not gone unnoticed-scarcely a speech<br />
on the Budget at all.<br />
To support what I have said aboult shallow<br />
and baseless generalities let me draw<br />
your attention to the Opposition Leader's<br />
claim that yearly budgeting ' has denied Australians<br />
opportunities for education, employment<br />
and enterprise'.<br />
As to education, the great Commonwealth<br />
contributions through grants<br />
to universities, grants to colleges of<br />
advanced education, teacher training colleges,<br />
technical schools, science blocks and<br />
now libraries, have not been the subject of<br />
yearly budgeting at all. They have been<br />
triennial grants. The measure of the opportunity<br />
' denied' is that these grants have<br />
risen from $ 55m in 1961-62 to $ 210m this<br />
vear. </p>
<p>As to opportunities for employment<br />
' denied', registered unemployment is below<br />
the total of a year ago or for that matter<br />
years ago. During the financial year just<br />
passed employment increased by 131,000.<br />
Vacancies have been rising faster than usual<br />
and placements of persons in employment<br />
in July were an all time record for the<br />
month of July. As to the denial of opportunity<br />
for enterprise, the economic advances<br />
of our nation since 1949 have proceeded<br />
at a rate unparalleled in our history.<br />
Mr Stokes-Say that again, sir.<br />
Mr GORTON-The economic advances<br />
of our nation since 1949 have proceeded<br />
at a rate unparalleled in our history.<br />
Gross national product at constant prices<br />
has increased from about $ 8,600m to<br />
S19,500m last year. Moreover, on the basis<br />
of our recent advances we can look forward<br />
to a further doubling of the size of<br />
our economy within the next 13 years. The<br />
accelerating growth and development<br />
throughout Australia, which is there for all<br />
who have eyes to see, provides visual refutation<br />
of this generality expresscd by the<br />
Leader of the Opposition, and the Commonwealth<br />
Statistician's figures on private capital<br />
spending provide the statistical refutation.<br />
Those sweeping statements of the Opposition<br />
Leader, made at the beginning of his<br />
Budget speech, are just not true, or perhaps<br />
I should say are just not correct. Nor is<br />
it correct for him to claim that he did not<br />
have available to him adequate statistical,<br />
information. To give an example, in<br />
discussing the growth of the construction<br />
industry he stated that building approvals<br />
both in total and for new houses and fiats<br />
were lower in May this year than they were<br />
last December, and then went on to state<br />
that there was no more recent information<br />
available to him and went on to take the<br />
Treasurer ( Mr McMahon) to task for withholding<br />
more recent information from the<br />
House. In -fact there was more recent<br />
information available. It is contained in the<br />
statement ' Building Approvals Australia,<br />
June 1968' and it was issued by the Commonwealth<br />
Statistician on 23rd July 1968<br />
before the Budget Speech was dellivered and<br />
long before the Leader of the Opposition<br />
made his speech. But the significant fact is that total building approvals during the<br />
last financial year-this is what we are concerned<br />
with-moved up from $ 546m in the<br />
December quarter to $ 555m in the March<br />
quarter this year to $ 575m in the June<br />
quarter this year, which is a record. It serves<br />
-no purpose for an honourable member or<br />
a Leader of the Opposition to come into<br />
this House and seek to support an argument<br />
by selecting one month's statistics when that<br />
argument is refuted by the year's statistics<br />
and by each quarter's statistics, all of which<br />
were known, ought to have been known<br />
and could have been known to a Leader of<br />
the Opposition.<br />
There are other instances of attempted<br />
sleight of hand arguments dotted throughout<br />
the speech, but they merely support the<br />
general glib approach I have illustrated and<br />
I will, not weary the House with them.<br />
Rather will-I discuss some of the main<br />
Budget features-the economic objectives<br />
of the Budget and the methods chosen to<br />
attain them.<br />
One of the Budget features is the vote<br />
for defence. The Leader of the Opposition<br />
claims that this is not a defence Budget. If<br />
he means that all else is not sacrificed tt<br />
defence, then -he is right: although the very<br />
great sums appropriated for defence do<br />
prevent us from doing many things that we<br />
would wish to do. But if, on the other hand,<br />
he means that the defence capacity of Aus<br />
tralia will not increase during this year a.<br />
a result of the defence vote in this Budget<br />
-his glancing references to defence seemed<br />
designed to give this impression-then he<br />
is demonstrably and, I think, deliberately<br />
wrong. The vote for defence shows the<br />
importance we place on defence, and,<br />
subject to what I say later, the<br />
importance we will continue to place on it.<br />
From the money appropriated' this year<br />
the strength of our regular forces will increase<br />
during the year by some 3,800 and<br />
the strength of the Citizen Military Force,<br />
by some 2,200-odd. 2<br />
During the year, the Navy will take<br />
delivery of 12 coastal patrol boats, the<br />
third guided missile destroyer will join the<br />
fleet in Australia, the third Oberon sul'<br />
marine will arrive in Australia, while wor.)<br />
will -be continuing on the fourth submarine<br />
due to be commissioned next August. </p>
<p>Mr Barnard-You have not mentioned<br />
the Fill1.<br />
Mr GORTON-Oh, I will. There is a<br />
great deal of defence equipment that is<br />
going to arrive and this is why I am refuting<br />
the impression that -the Leader of the<br />
Opposition sought to give that there would<br />
be no increase in Australia's defence capacity<br />
this year. The aircraft carrier ' Melbourne',<br />
having completed its extensive and<br />
expensive refit, will rejoin the fleet with<br />
its complement of Tracker and Skyhawk<br />
aircraft. Work will be further advanced<br />
on two type 12 frigates at present under<br />
construction, the first of which is due to be<br />
commissioned in something like one year's<br />
time. The Army will take delivery of 27<br />
light aircraft and helicopters and equipment<br />
and arms worth some $ 331m.<br />
Examples of such equipment-and they are<br />
merely examples of such equipment-are<br />
47 armoured personnel carriers, 700 Land<br />
Rovers, 550 21-ton trucks, and ammunition,<br />
arms and so on which it would take<br />
too long to detail.<br />
7) The Air Force-and this, I think,<br />
interested somebody on the other side a<br />
moment ago-will take delivery this year of<br />
24 Fill strike reconnaissance aircraft. It<br />
wvill take delivery of 12 Mirage fighters, of<br />
J6 Macchi jet trainers which have an operaional<br />
capacity, 8 HS748 navigational and<br />
aero-electronic trainers; and during this<br />
financial year the last of the Orion long<br />
range anti-submarine aircraft have, in fact,<br />
already arrived. So any suggestion that we<br />
will not be better defended because of<br />
money appropriated in this Budget is an<br />
untrue suggestion.<br />
As to the future we are now engaged in a<br />
fundamental strategic reassessment. I will<br />
not anticipate its outcome, but I will say<br />
two things.<br />
DFirstly, in the years ahead the amount<br />
spent on defence will grow in volume, and<br />
must grow as the -nation grows and as the<br />
situation in which the nation finds itself<br />
develops. Australia's capacity to fight will<br />
Nncrease and the industrial capacity to back<br />
-, gur fighbting forces will also expand. Defence<br />
will not in any way be neglected.<br />
Mr Devine-Who wrote this? Mr GORTON-I did. Secondly, there are<br />
many competing needs in the years aheadthe<br />
need to build our population, the need<br />
to, strengthen our industrial muscles and<br />
improve our technology, the need to develop<br />
our resources, the need to improve education,<br />
the need to eradicate poverty, and<br />
many other needs. Meeting these needs, Mr<br />
Deputy Speaker, will, in itself, increase and<br />
improve our ability to defend this nation,<br />
and under present international circumstances<br />
we do not intend to sacrifice theseother<br />
needs. We do not intend to seek guns<br />
instead of growth at the cost of stunting<br />
our growth. We will not ignore our other<br />
requirements in order to mobilise for war;<br />
but our forces will grow, their fighting<br />
power will1 grow, the cost of defence will<br />
grow, and this will be regarded as one<br />
important need among many for the nation,<br />
though not as a need which overrides all<br />
else. I move on to consider the question of<br />
welfare. We were told that this is not a<br />
welfare Budget, but it is. It neither. solves<br />
nor pretends to solve in a final way the<br />
complex problems involved in selecting all<br />
those who are in most need and catering to<br />
those needs, but it does take significant steps<br />
towards that solution. In the first speech I<br />
made asking the electorate of Higgins to<br />
select me for the House-which I am glad<br />
to say they did-I said:<br />
No nation can be great unless it seeks not only<br />
materially to progress but also to take care of the<br />
weaker, within it, the aged within it and the ill<br />
within it.<br />
This I believe to be true, and my Government<br />
will make a continuing effort to<br />
achieve those ends.<br />
In health we have taken a great step<br />
forward in this Budget by providing that<br />
insured persons will receive the full hospital<br />
benefits for which they are insured whether<br />
in a public ward, an intermediate ward or<br />
a private ward, no matter how long their<br />
illness may continue and no matter how<br />
long they may be required to stay in hospital.<br />
We have begun a three-tiered attack<br />
on the problem of bed care for those who<br />
are ill. We seek to keep those who need<br />
only light nursing at home by co-operating<br />
and offering financial inducements to the<br />
States in financing and running home nursing..<br />
We are providing more daily allowances,<br />
greater daily allowances, for those </p>
<p>who need heavy nursing care-for those<br />
who cannot stay at home and need heavy<br />
nursing care in approved nursing homes.<br />
We are offering $ 1m a year to help build<br />
State nursing homes so that -the increased<br />
benefits we offer patients will be the less<br />
likely to be absorbed in increased fees. As<br />
I have said, we have solved the problems<br />
of those who are insured and who suffer<br />
long continued illnesses.<br />
We know there still remains the problem<br />
of enabling all our citizens to insure themselves<br />
without hardship. We know there still<br />
remains the problem of a possible rise in<br />
hospital fees causing a possible rise in<br />
insurance rates, but the Welfare Committee<br />
of Cabinet and the Nimmo inquiry<br />
into hospital funds is working on these<br />
matters now and we are determined to<br />
solve them. In the field of social services<br />
we sought to identify those most in need<br />
and selected, as a first step, families<br />
without bread winners-families of widows<br />
and invalid pensioners, for example-as<br />
those to whom in this first Budget we<br />
should give most. In repatriation we have<br />
quite deliberately devoted the money available<br />
to those who have suffered most from<br />
defending this country and who are, terefore,<br />
likely to be most in need-the totally<br />
and permanently incapacitated ex-soldier,<br />
the intermediate pensioner, the ex-soldier in<br />
receipt of a 100% war pension because<br />
of war caused injuries. There is the<br />
area in which we think it most likely<br />
that need exists and to which we<br />
think we should pay special attention.<br />
We believe that most ex-soldiers would<br />
wish to see available resources devoted to<br />
those who have suffered most in the defence<br />
of their country.<br />
We had perforce-because it is not<br />
possible in 6 months thoroughly to overhaul<br />
a social services structure which has not<br />
been overhauled for some decades-to raise<br />
social service pensions generally across the<br />
board. This will mean that some single and<br />
married pensioners who may need more will<br />
not get more, but this problem, too, we are<br />
determined to work towards solving. Our<br />
aim is a society where the fear of the<br />
crippling cost of illness is removed from<br />
those who are able and willing to contribute<br />
towards removing it through insurance. Our<br />
aim is a social welfare structure which<br />
identifies the most needy and sees that those who have no other means are provided<br />
with enough to live on in a modest, self<br />
respecting way without requiring any other<br />
assistance from outside the pension. Our aim<br />
is to encourage all to work and to save so<br />
that they can live at a standard above that<br />
minimum. What we want to see is that the<br />
aged needy, the ill needy, those really suffering<br />
from some unfortunate circumstances<br />
through no fault of their own, are<br />
adequately pro. vided for by the nation, but<br />
that this should be done without destroying<br />
the incentive to save and without destroying<br />
the incentive to self reliance. These goals<br />
are not easy to achieve, but we have set<br />
our hand to the plough and we will not<br />
turn back. Step by step we will achieve<br />
them. Mr Deputy Speaker, a Budget is designed<br />
so to manage the economy that certain economic<br />
objectives are attained. If we are to<br />
achieve the goals we have set ourselves in<br />
defence, in development and in social welfare,<br />
we must ensure as an essential a<br />
healthy and balanced growth of the economy.<br />
On the economic side this is the<br />
primary aim of this Budget. We must prevent<br />
demand from running to an inflationary<br />
excess, but, equally importantly, we must<br />
ensure that all we can supply and all we<br />
can acquire are demanded and are used<br />
for growth. The general objectives of this<br />
Budget are to achieve this. Firstly, the<br />
Budget seeks to ensure that there will be<br />
in the year ahead a continuation and an<br />
acceleration of that growth and development<br />
which have characterised the year just<br />
past. The Budget seeks to ensure that there<br />
will be full employment opportunities for<br />
the present work force, for the migrant<br />
intake-we have made provision for a<br />
record migrant intake-and for the natural<br />
addition to the work force from within this<br />
country. The Budget seeks also to ensure that these<br />
things will happen without the development<br />
of conditions in which demand for manpower,<br />
materials and goods outstrips production<br />
and supply. For the development<br />
of those conditions does not add to growth;<br />
it adds merely to the cost of growth and<br />
to the difficulty of selling exports and earning<br />
foreign exchange. Those conditions,<br />
once allowed to develop, require for their<br />
correction far more stringent measures than<br />
are required to prevent their development. </p>
<p>In seeking growth, national development,<br />
accretion to our strength, we do not accept<br />
the view that this can be best achieved<br />
mainly through government spending. So we<br />
have in this Budget cut the rate of growth<br />
in government spending rather than place<br />
more limitations on the growth in private<br />
spending. We believe that true growth<br />
depends on the economic climate created by<br />
a government and on a government assisting<br />
the development by private enterprise<br />
of the resources of the country. We believe<br />
that true growth depends on the amount<br />
of private investment and private saving<br />
within Australia from Australian resources.<br />
If we are to grow quickly, as I believe it<br />
is imperative that we should, this depends<br />
also on the attraction of overseas development<br />
capital, without which we could not<br />
grow as quickly as the times demand. We<br />
have maintained and improved the climate<br />
for growth. We are attaining significant<br />
private savings. We are attracting development<br />
capital. But the full benefit of this,<br />
indeed the continuation of it at its present<br />
level, depends on maintaining relatively<br />
stable costs and prices. This does not mean<br />
-any preoccupation with stability as such, for<br />
stability as such is not enough. One can<br />
Chave stability in conditions of stagnation.<br />
But it is an affirmation of the need to see<br />
that while all our resources for growth are<br />
used to the utmost demands are not created<br />
Cwh ich cannot be met from our production<br />
. and from what we are able to import. We<br />
C. should earn more this year from our<br />
exports. Mr Beaton-You will need to.<br />
Mr GORTON-We will, of course.<br />
Mr Beaton-You will not, you know.<br />
Mr GORTON-The honourable member<br />
is underlining what I am saying-that<br />
we should earn more from our exports.<br />
CaB ucta piint alt hien flyoewa r asa hleaargde , woer cnaenarnloyt arse llya rgoen,<br />
as we had last year. So, ' believing this and<br />
C noting the trend of rising demand in Australia,<br />
we have thought it necessary to<br />
budget for a lower deficit in order to<br />
restrain our expenditure. Two or three<br />
Qimntoemrjeecntti oangso infdriocmat ed, thMe r DOeppuptoys iStipoena kera,<br />
that honourable members opposite may<br />
be thinking along the same lines. This is<br />
the first indication we have had from them as to the economic objectives of this<br />
Budget. The measures we have taken will<br />
mean that the amount of bank credit<br />
pumped into the economic bloodstream<br />
could be reduced by about one-third in<br />
the coming financial year.<br />
Against the background I have sketched.<br />
-are these objectives wrong? Are the<br />
measures taken to achieve the objectives<br />
wrong? On these points the Leader of the<br />
Opposition ( Mr Whitlam) was virtually<br />
silent in his speech. There were no answers<br />
to the questions I -have just asked. It<br />
appears that by default the -members of<br />
the Opposition agree that we are right.<br />
This is, Sir, as the Leader of the Opposition<br />
said, the nineteenth successive Budget<br />
introduced by the Liberal-Country Patty<br />
Government. In those 19 years Australia<br />
has been transformed. Our<br />
steel production has increased from<br />
1.2 million tons to 6.3 million tons.<br />
Our output of cement increased from 1<br />
million tons to 3.8 millions tons. Electricity<br />
generated increased from 9,000 million kilowatt<br />
hours to 44,000 million kilowatt hours.<br />
Our population has risen from less than 8<br />
million to 12 million.<br />
Dr J. F. Cairns-Are you responsible for<br />
that too?<br />
Mr GORTON-Not all of it. Real personal<br />
consumption expenditure per head has<br />
increased from $ 760 to $ 1,020. Motor<br />
vehicle registrations have risen from 1 million<br />
to over 4 million. More than 70% of<br />
occupied dwellings in Australia are either<br />
owned by or are being bought by the occupants-<br />
a higher proportion than in any other<br />
advanced country. The number of students<br />
receiving university education has risen<br />
from about 33,000 to about 100,000. Manufacturing<br />
and heavy industries have gone<br />
from strength to strength. [ Extension of time<br />
granted.] I thank the House and again will<br />
not trespass upon its generosity.<br />
Greatly increased production is coming<br />
from the land and new vistas are opening<br />
for Australia from its mineral discoveries.<br />
It we keep the economy on the growth<br />
path which, as a result of these years of<br />
Liberal-Country Party Government have led<br />
to the improvements and increases I have<br />
enumerated, if it follows that path which </p>
<p>it has followed for the last 5 or 6 years,<br />
a child born today will, on reaching the<br />
age at which it could graduate from high<br />
school, enter a work force in Australia<br />
with an economy two and a half times its<br />
present size. That record of what has been<br />
done, and that promise of what can be<br />
done, provided the administrations which<br />
brought about what happened before continue, is why I say that though Australia<br />
is not yet great in the councils of the world<br />
it is destined so to be. This is no record<br />
of opportunities denied, as we were told;<br />
this is a record of achievement and of<br />
management carried on in a very real sense<br />
for the true welfare of the people of Australia.<br />
This is a record we propose to continue<br />
and improve.<br />
