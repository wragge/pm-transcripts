J~ AUSTRALIA<br />
PRIME MINISTER PESS STATEMENT NO. 232<br />
19 April 1974<br />
MR SNEDDEN'S ECONOMIC POLICIES<br />
Mr Snedden has now patched together another bewildering<br />
instalment of the Opposition's economic policy.<br />
From all the backtracking, confusion and deception<br />
evident in his statement one thing stands out: The Opposition's<br />
economic policies would give an intolerable boost to inflation.<br />
Let it never be forgotten that my Government inherited<br />
from the Liberals a sick economy with massive unemployment and<br />
severe inflation. The seeds of that inflation were sown in Mr Snedden's<br />
own disastrous Budgets of 1971 and 1972.<br />
On top of that, in common with every major and trading<br />
industrial nation, Australia last year faced an unprecedented<br />
upsurge in world inflation.<br />
The Government took a whole series of decisions last year<br />
to restrain inflation, including tariff cuts, revaluations, monetary<br />
measures and trade practices legislation.<br />
Every one of those measures was opposed by Mr Snedden.<br />
The Liberals in the Senate refused even to allow debate on the trade<br />
practices bill. Now he puts forward a policy that would increase inflation<br />
still further. He proposes to remove restrictions on the inflow of<br />
capital and release a flood of foreign money into the country.<br />
His proposed $ 600 million tax cut so strenuously resisted<br />
by Mr Anthony is equally irresponsible at this time. It is contrary<br />
to all economic practice and good sense. It is the opposite of<br />
everything the Liberals themselves did to reduce inflation when they<br />
were in office. / 2 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
Naturally we are in favour of reducing taxation for those<br />
who carry the most severe tax burden. We have pledged to restructure<br />
the tax system to help those on low and middle incomes. We will do<br />
it when the time is right, not as an ad hoc election gimmick but<br />
only after thorough study.<br />
Mr Snedden will create further confusion by his talk about<br />
interest rates. For months he has been promising to cut interest<br />
rates. He has now backtracked on his promise.<br />
In effect, he now says that interest rates would be cut<br />
when inflation is reduced. He has acknowledged that the Government's<br />
interest rate policy is justified as an anti-inflationary measure.<br />
Mr Snedden has also backtracked on his vague talk about<br />
a pay and price freeze. He knows such a freeze would not work.<br />
He has backtracked on the question of reducing Government<br />
expenditure. He no longer says he would cut expenditure. He merely<br />
says the rate of growth would be reduced.<br />
He gives no clear indication of where reductions would be<br />
made. The great welfare and education policies initiated by my<br />
Government would be at risk.<br />
Mr Snedden's only firm commitment is to hand the national<br />
pipeline system over to private developers. This is a doctrinaire<br />
concession to the Liberal Party's backers. It would make no<br />
difference to inflation whether the pipeline was built with private<br />
or public capital. The public will be left to speculate on which parts of<br />
Mr Snedden's economic policies are approved by the Country Party and<br />
the D. L. P. The chorus of confusion and contradiction on this subject<br />
will further diminish public confidence in the Opposition's policies<br />
and motives.<br />
