QPE" ING OF THE NEW MIDDLE SCHOOL AT<br />
CHRISTIAN BROTHERS COLLEGE,<br />
WAVERLEY, N. S. W, FEBRUARY 1970<br />
Speech by the. Prime Minister, Mr John Gorton<br />
Mr Chairman, Your Grace, Parliamentary Colleagues both Federal and<br />
State, Distinguished Guests, Ladies and Gentlemen:<br />
May I thank you for the warmth of your welcome and thank you<br />
in particular, Brother Simmons, for what you had to say and tell you that I regard<br />
this occasion to be an honour for me and one which gives me great satisfaction.<br />
I regard it as an honour because I have been asked to be associated<br />
today with those who planned and worked and strove and finally completed their<br />
task. And I find it of immense satisfaction, because as I look at this new block<br />
and cast my mind into the future, I believe there will come from it and from the<br />
resources which it includes, hundreds and hundreds of young men into the<br />
Australian community, better educated than they would otherwise have been. I<br />
believe they will be inculcated with the desire to put their talents and their<br />
privileges at the service of their country, and contributing to this nation not to<br />
any segment of it but to this nation more than they would have been able to<br />
contribute had this building not beetr conjtrucfed.<br />
This, of course, is a special day for Waverley. It is a concrete<br />
illustration of the advances now being made in educational thinking, in educational<br />
techniques, and in the application of technology to make teaching more easy, more<br />
interesting, more satisfying and more comprehensive. It is, too, a shining example<br />
of the use of funds, both private and public, to the best possible advantage from the<br />
poin . t of view of getting value for every dollar spent.<br />
This Middle School block, Sir, is a notable addition to a notable<br />
school, a school with a long history and fine tradition. And I would like to<br />
congratulate Brother Simmons and his staff and the members of the College Advisory<br />
Council on what they have achieved and what we see before us today as a result of<br />
that achievement. I think, too, that this is a justification if justification were needed<br />
of the policies of governments, both State and Commonwealth but I speak for the<br />
Commonwealth of the policies adopted towards providing encouragement and some<br />
assistance to Independent schools; a policy based, I believe, on principles of<br />
justice, of economic commonsense, and of an appreciation of how best to serve<br />
the true interests of education generally throughout our nation. a. / 2 </p>
<p>Allow me for a moment to set before you what in fact that policy<br />
towards education is, because there seems to be some mistaken belief growing<br />
in the community, some mistaken idea that governments are only providing<br />
help to independent schools, that such schools are the pampered darlings of the<br />
Commonwealth Government and this is not true.<br />
It is true that Commonwealth spending on education in Australia<br />
has risen to $ 22 a head of population from some $ 4 ten years ago, but the vast<br />
majority of this sum and the vast majority of this increase is provided for<br />
sectors of public education, and that should be borne constantly in mind. Science<br />
blocks have been provided throughout Australia to all secondary schools, which<br />
means that 75 per cent of all monetary provision for this has gone to public, not<br />
to independent, schools. Libraries a programme now getting well under way, but still<br />
to be brought to full fruition are being provided to all secondary schools<br />
throughout Australia, which means some 75 per cent of the finances provided goes<br />
to State and not to independent schools. Expenditure on secondary technical<br />
education, so essential for the future of our nation, is almost entirely confined<br />
to'government schools. Teacher training colleges are provided with unmatched<br />
funds by the Commonwealth, on condition that ten per cent of the places reserved<br />
in them for trainees are reserved for those who will teach in independent schools.<br />
In colleges of advanced education, in assistance to universities,<br />
the public sector is the sector which receives all expenditure.<br />
So no-one can say that the needs of publi c education are being<br />
in any way ignored, and that is the first point which I wish to make.<br />
Yet there are those who oppose any assistance being given to<br />
independent schools, who oppose the provision of science blocks to such schools,<br />
of libraries to such schools and, more particularly, oppose the recent provision<br />
of assistance towards the running costs of such schools.<br />
I believe that those who so oppose this policy are completely<br />
wrong. I can understand though I would entirely reject an argument advanced<br />
in some quarters that there should be no private independent schools allowed.<br />
That at least is a simple argument, and, I think, simply refuted. But I cannot<br />
understand the argument which would say to some Australian citizens " Although<br />
you have paid your full share of taxation for a public school system which you do<br />
not use, thereby relieving the strain on it; although you have paid additional<br />
charges and are paying them to provide a school of a type which you prefer<br />
although you are doing all this, yet you should nevertheless be prohibited from<br />
receiving any assistance at all from the taxation revenue to which you have<br />
contributed. This seems to me to be entirely unjust, and that is why I said<br />
earlier that our policy is based on principles of justice the policy of giving<br />
some assistance. vo e. / 3 </p>
<p>And the economic argument which supports the provision of<br />
assistance to independent schools is irrefutable. How much more would be<br />
required from the taxpayers of Australia if there were to be no private schools<br />
tomorrow, and those who attended them were to be moved to a state system<br />
tomorrow? What great sums would be required, not to improve the existing<br />
state schools, but merely to keep them at their present standards? I think<br />
the economic argument and the commonsense are quite unassailable.<br />
But moving to the interests of education, you, Brother Simmons,<br />
said that what was required of our educational institutions was that they should<br />
have independence, that they should seek for excellence and that they should<br />
be able to experiment and to have variety. What better way can these ideals<br />
be achieved than by having a state school system on the one hand, and independent<br />
school systems on the other, so that there is no risk of uniformity being applied<br />
by a central education department. There is an opportunity for innovations<br />
suich as we have seen here today, and innovations not only from independent<br />
schools they can come both from state and independent but innovations which<br />
once they are made and once they have been proved to be successful, are not<br />
confined to the sector which made those innovations, but are available for the<br />
whole broad field of education throughout Australia.<br />
So both from the point of view of justice, of economic commonsense,<br />
and of serving the. interests of education, I believe the policies of<br />
assistance which have been adopted are right, and I assure you that those policies<br />
will continue and will not be changed,<br />
There are those who think that by expressing disagreement and<br />
opposition to these policies, which they have a perfect right to do, they are<br />
serving the interests of the state sector of education. It may well be indeed<br />
I believe it is that if they were to achieve the objectives they seek, they<br />
would not be defending government schools at all, but merely preventing the<br />
improvement of government schools, which will be able the more quickly to<br />
be improved if the independent schools are provided some assistance over and<br />
above the burdens borne by those who support them, to enable more of the<br />
taxpayers! dollars to be left to improve the state school system itself.<br />
We as a government are not interested in just one sector of<br />
education. We are, as you know, awaiting the report of an enquiry by all state<br />
governments into the needs of education, both in state schools and in<br />
independent schools throughout Australia. We believe that the method of such<br />
an inquiry by each state government is the best way to carry it out. We know<br />
that there are further improvements required to primary and secondary<br />
education generally. And we will, as time and opportunity permit, seek to play<br />
our part with State Governments in this field. But because we are interested in<br />
the whole field of education state as well as independent we will not turn<br />
our backs on our interest in the independent sector. a o. a / 4 </p>
<p>May I, Sir, before I declare the Middle School open, merely<br />
say this That as long as there are throughout Australia people who are prepared<br />
to give of their income, to give of their time, to give of their effort in order to<br />
try to create better opportunities for education, then I think that we can face<br />
the future with a high heart. Because there will come from all our schools in<br />
greater numbers those better able to grapple with the new problems which will<br />
face us, those provided with the technical skills to harness the inventions now<br />
being made for the service of mankird, and those with a belief in rightness, in<br />
service and in dedication which must be the true end and requirement of education<br />
in whatever school that education may take place.<br />
And now, Sir, I have great satisfaction in moving to the tablet<br />
and declaring open this new Middle School of Waverley College. </p>
