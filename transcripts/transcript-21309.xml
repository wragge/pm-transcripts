    <content><![CDATA[<p>  The United Kingdom and Australia share a unique political and cultural heritage.  Our ties are broad, strong and enduring. The relationship between our governments, our economic enterprises and the people of our two countries reflects this natural affinity. The relationship has evolved into a mature partnership of mutual respect that is modern and forward looking.  Our goals for a secure, prosperous world free from the threat of terrorism and able to access expanding opportunities for advancement stem from our shared values, especially our commitment to robust and democratic processes, the rule of law and free trade.</p>
<p>We have stood side by side in defence of these values throughout many conflicts. Tomorrow, when we join together with others in Normandy to commemorate the 60th Anniversary of D-Day, we recall that our commitment to freedom has sometimes come at a very high price.  The threats to liberty and freedom in the contemporary world today are global and call for the same resolve and clarity of purpose if they are to be overcome.  The United Kingdom and Australia have worked closely together in facing such serious challenges and we will continue to do so.</p>
<p>Our meeting today reaffirmed our determination to continue to work together with the Iraqi people and our international partners in pursuit of stability, security and democracy in Iraq. Achieving these ends would be a huge gain for the security not just of the Middle East region but of the world.</p>
<p>In this regard, we welcome the transfer of sovereignty to the Interim Iraqi Government. We pledge our ongoing support for the new Iraqi administration as it works to re-establish a stable and prosperous Iraq, one which can offer its people a future of their choosing.</p>
<p>We recognise the difficulties which need to be overcome to achieve that goal. But we also recognise the scale of what is at stake in Iraq.  We have faced difficulties in Iraq, but the appointment of a new Iraqi Interim Government gives us fresh hope and a renewed determination to see the job through and enable Iraqis to determine their own future in freedom and security.</p>
