PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF NEWS CONFERENCE, SEAGULLS FOOTBALL CLUB, TWEED<br />
HEADS -17 AUGUST 1990<br />
E OE -PROOF ONLY<br />
JOURNALIST: Sir, does your use of the biography of Mr<br />
Churchill imply that you're an admirer of Mr Churchill?<br />
PM: Not unqualifiedly, but in regard to that period he was<br />
outstanding. He unflinchingly and against great odium that<br />
was directed against him, tried to warn not only his own<br />
country but the world about the follies of appeasement and<br />
the price that would be paid. I obviously would have lots<br />
of disagreements about aspects of Mr Churchill's career but<br />
on that issue he was supreme.<br />
JOURNALIST: Without crystal ball gazing, how do you think<br />
your supporters will judge you in the light of your<br />
decisions in a few weeks time?<br />
PM: History will tell that. But I've never as Prime<br />
Minister taken the view that I should make decisions on the<br />
basis of how I'll be judged. If you think a thing is right<br />
then you've got to do it.<br />
JOURNALIST: The reaction to your current decisions as<br />
you're moving around, from the public?<br />
PM: Overwhelmingly supportive. There's been the odd<br />
protest expressed. I guess that's as it should be in a<br />
democracy. I mean that's what we believe in, what we're<br />
trying to defend.<br />
JOURNALIST: How do you feel about Mr Whitlam criticising<br />
you Sir?<br />
PM: I've already said something about that. I've made the<br />
observation that Gough seems to be going into a period of<br />
gratuitous advice as I put it. That's fair enough because I<br />
think Prime Ministers have generally found it a little bit<br />
difficult to retire and stay out of things. I probably may<br />
have some of the same difficulty myself when the time comes<br />
down the track. But I think the best comment about this<br />
recent period of Gough came from one of his own previous<br />
staffers, as I've just said recently, who rang up my office<br />
when Gough was proffering advice on how to run the economy.<br />
As he put it, he said having Gough advising you on how to<br />
run the economy was something like Nero giving advice on ( 1 9 </p>
<p>firefighting services. As I said, I think Gough would have<br />
been proud of that line himself.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, regarding the crisis in the Middle<br />
East at this stage, we've heard that a number of overseas<br />
hostages have been gathered together in Kuwait. Do you know<br />
if the Australians are part of that gathering together?<br />
PM: I spoke to my office this morning and at that stage<br />
they believed not.<br />
JOURNALIST: Has there been any further advice throughout<br />
the day or is that<br />
PM: No, I have not received any further advice. I think I<br />
would have if that had been the case.<br />
JOURNALIST: Sir at this stage do you see any parallels with<br />
Vietnam? PM: None at all.<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you support Senator Richardson's views on<br />
the ICAC, or can you give us your views?<br />
PM: Those are the views that have been expressed by Senator<br />
Richardson. He speaks for himself on this issue. It's not<br />
a Government position.<br />
JOURNALIST: And what about your views?<br />
PM: I have no views for public expression on that point.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, if we could touch on some local<br />
issues.<br />
PM: Yes of course you can.<br />
JOURNALIST: About unemployment in the area. Do you have<br />
any specific plans to curb this problem?<br />
PM: I was asked a similar question this morning and what I<br />
said was this. You have to, in regard to the presence<br />
situation, put that in the context of Australia's recent<br />
experience. When we came to office in ' 83, unemployment was<br />
at dreadfully high and unacceptable levels. We have pursued<br />
economic policies to stimulate growth and the success of<br />
that is to be measured by the fact that the rate of<br />
employment growth in Australia under my period of Government<br />
has been twice as fast as the rest of the world. Now we're<br />
proud of that. We reached a point though however a year ago<br />
when this fact had emerged, that Australia's consumption had<br />
increased by eight per cent, consumption broadly defined,<br />
and our production only increased by four per cent. In<br />
other words that gap was taken up by imports. We couldn't<br />
responsibly as a nation keep going like that. So we've had<br />
to slow the level of activity down in the economy for those<br />
external reasons, reasons of external balance. And </p>
<p>inevitably that has meant, with a slowing of rate of growth,<br />
some slowing in the rate of employment growth and some<br />
slight increasing in unemployment. Now that has been<br />
deliberate, it's been necessary in the interests of the<br />
country. So I want to say that with the success we've had<br />
in achieving that slowdown I'm looking to a situation where<br />
the economy will begin to grow again, or significantly in<br />
next year. Of course those are the sorts of general<br />
measures you've got to take. obviously in Australia there<br />
are going to be areas which will have different employment<br />
and unemployment experiences. It is the case that in this<br />
region there has been somewhat higher levels of unemployment<br />
than elsewhere. Now we don't generally intend to take<br />
measures for specific areas to deal with them. However let<br />
me say this, that since I've been here there have been a<br />
number of issues raised with me which I'm going to look at.<br />
I'm going back with a swag of submissions from various<br />
people. I give the undertaking that all of those will be<br />
examined closely. If there are any things out of that which<br />
are capable of being done within this general framework I'm<br />
talking about we'll do them. But I don't want to mislead<br />
the people in this area and say well look, we've got a<br />
specific employment generation program for it. But we'll do<br />
what we can.<br />
JOURNALIST: Will there be any special initiatives for small<br />
business at all.<br />
PM: Well in regard to small business you'll see some<br />
initiatives in the Budget. The most important thing is that<br />
now the Minister for Small Business is David Beddall who as<br />
you know last year chaired the committee of review of small<br />
businesses. We have made a specific reference to the<br />
Industry Commission to look at the capital requirements of<br />
business and small business in particular. So there are a<br />
range of things that are being done to look at this issue<br />
but by and large of course what small business needs to<br />
prosper is an economy which is not blowing out. We've<br />
stopped that. As we move to a position where there can be<br />
further reductions in interest rates, as there will be in<br />
the future, then that will be to the benefit of small<br />
business.<br />
JOURNALIST: Talking of interest rates, when do you expect<br />
interest rates to come down again?<br />
PM: It's a good try mate. But all I can say to you are two<br />
things. One that in this year, as you know, there have been<br />
two reductions in interest rates. Those haven't been fully<br />
reflected, that's in prime rates, as a result of Government<br />
policy. Those haven't been fully reflected right through<br />
the structure of interest rates and it is the case that the<br />
business community generally is paying something of a price<br />
through the banking sector's attempt to cover the losses<br />
that they have incurred through perhaps injudicious spending<br />
policies in the past. We will move at the time that we<br />
think it's appropriate towards a further reduction of rates<br />
and we will not delay that one day longer than is necessary. </p>
<p>But we won't bring it in a day before we think we can do so<br />
responsibly. So the prospect is for reduction but I'm not<br />
putting a time on it.<br />
JOURNALIST: Sir, home owners have seen one half a per cent<br />
reduction. Can you hold any more hope out to them?<br />
PM: Yes. The future is for a reduction I believe. But I<br />
repeat what I said. I'm not saying that's tomorrow or the<br />
day after because neither home owners nor small business nor<br />
anyone else would benefit from a premature reduction of<br />
interest rates and a premature resurgence of unsustainable<br />
levels of activity.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, on another subject. The premature<br />
leaking of the debate on the telecommunications plan to the<br />
media. What's your reaction to that?<br />
PM: Oh, it's something we would've been better of f without.<br />
Of course I don't welcome it but it was not a terribly wellkept<br />
state secret that there are some differences of opinion<br />
within my Ministry about this. I've had discussions with<br />
the two Ministers particularly concerned. I believe that by<br />
the time the Government has to formulate a position and go<br />
to the Conference with it that we'll have an agreed<br />
position. The important thing to understand is this. While<br />
there are some differences of view within my Party, there is<br />
an agreement between the two Ministers concerned and others<br />
that we've got to have competition in this area. But we've<br />
got to have competition within a situation where there is<br />
going to be a publicly owned and operated telecommunications<br />
facility. That's what the important issue is in politics in<br />
this country because that distinguishes my Party and my<br />
Government from the Opposition. Because we've seen this<br />
incredible position now where Brown, the spokesman for the<br />
opposition, has come out and said that they'll sell Telecom.<br />
In other words, what they are offering the people of<br />
Australia is a situation where the vital telecommunications<br />
industry will be totally in private hands. That is a recipe<br />
for disaster for this country. And however we sort it out,<br />
and we will, it will be in a framework where there will be a<br />
publicly owned telecommunication facility. And the<br />
retention of such a publicly owned telecommunication<br />
facility is essential if you're going to protect the<br />
interests of this country.<br />
JOURNALIST: Would transport come under the same sort of<br />
category as telecommunications?<br />
PM: Well not the same sort of category, but let me say what<br />
I see as the relevant considerations in transport. As I've<br />
said before, political parties, trade unions, employers,<br />
governments have got to understand that we live now in the<br />
most rapidly changing time in human history. None of us can<br />
afford just to keep the assumptions and the attitudes of the<br />
past. There may have been shibboleths, sacred cows before<br />
which we've worshipped and so on and it may have been<br />
appropriate to do that. But we've got to now be prepared to </p>
<p>ask ourselves what are the right priorities. Now in the<br />
area of transport, I think the overwhelming need for this<br />
country now is for a program which will deliver an<br />
integrated rail, road, freight system. It's unintegrated at<br />
the moment. There are vast diseconomies which occur because<br />
of the lack of integration. What my ambition is and<br />
intention is to see that we can as a national government put<br />
capital resources into rectifying that situation and to do<br />
it in co-operation with the States. But you've got to have<br />
the capital platform from which to do that and I believe<br />
that one way of providing that capital platform is to<br />
question whether in terms of relative priorities it makes<br />
sense for a government to have resources sunk in running<br />
airlines. There is a relationship between your capacity to<br />
do things in the area of transport which are crying out to<br />
be done and whether that's not sensible to look at freeing<br />
up some resources in other areas. That's the discussion in<br />
part which has been sensibly and I think without great<br />
passion being conducted within my Party. I welcome that<br />
discussion but I think we'll come out with a sensible<br />
outcome. JOURNALIST: Have you decided to lead your Party to the next<br />
election? PM: I had decided and announced that a long time ago mate.<br />
You know that.<br />
JOURNALIST: Senator Jim McKiernan has put out a statement<br />
today on behalf of the Left<br />
PM: Senator?<br />
PM: Jim McKiernan from Western Australia has put out a<br />
statement calling for assurances that Australia's<br />
involvement in the Gulf will remain strictly passive. Are<br />
you going to be able to give those assurances or be willing<br />
to give them?<br />
PM: I've spoken on that. I just repeat again our position.<br />
The decision we've made has been on the basis of our own<br />
consideration and in discussion with others, including the<br />
United States, and it is accepted as a sensible use of<br />
limited Australian forces. I have said that there is a<br />
considerable period of time now, some 18-19 days before the<br />
ships will reach that area. In that period we'll use that<br />
time to have discussions with others. If, and I've just<br />
said this conditionally, if it appears that there is a case<br />
for any broadening of the Australian involvement then that<br />
is a matter which would be discussed within the Government.<br />
It's not something on which I would unilaterally make a<br />
decision But I don't expect that that will be necessary<br />
and indeed, as I said at lunch, my great hope, my great hope<br />
is that in that period of the best part of three weeks that<br />
events will have developed in a way which will render any<br />
further presence unnecessary. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Are you more concerned for the fate of<br />
Australians there now that the Britains have been ordered<br />
PM: It's always been a great concern of mine the fate of<br />
the Australians in Iraq and Kuwait. We have just constantly<br />
through our own diplomatic representatives and where we<br />
haven't got a diplomatic representative, as in Kuwait,<br />
through other diplomatic representatives to try and ensure<br />
the greatest degree of protection we can for Australian<br />
citizens.<br />
JOURNALIST: If the war does break out would you rule out<br />
the use of Australian troops on the ground?<br />
PM: I don't answer hypothetical questions. You know that.<br />
I just believe that good sense is going to prevail. We<br />
haven't directed our mind to that. Neither has anyone else<br />
asked us to direct it. We have no such request from anyone.<br />
JOURNALIST: With the interceptions now going ahead in the<br />
Gulf, is there a fear how Iraq may react to that?<br />
PM: The general observation I made in the past is relevant<br />
to that question in that if you were dealing with a person<br />
who appeared to make decisions on rational grounds you would<br />
conclude that what you must say now is that the best<br />
interests of Iraq are served by withdrawing from Kuwait.<br />
Now if that was purely rational consideration<br />
applied. Now unfortunately when you look at the record it<br />
seems that not entirely rational considerations do apply.<br />
So it's very difficult to try and project an answer to what<br />
may happen. I just hope that it will become clear that<br />
fortunately the world is saying to Iraq we are not going to<br />
tolerate this sort of action. It must be coming clearer<br />
with each passing day that that's the case and that the<br />
occupation and purported annexation of Kuwait is not<br />
acceptable for the rest of the world. I hope, I mean the<br />
logic of that situation will prevail in the mind of Saddam<br />
Hussein. JOURNALIST: At the best totally unpredictable at the<br />
moment. PM: Yes well, no intelligent person looking at the record<br />
could predict with certainty. When you make predictions in<br />
regard to any situation it's on the basis of being able to<br />
say well we know what the criteria are that the person is<br />
going to follow, what rational sort of decisions.<br />
Unfortunately when you're dealing with a record of<br />
irrationality predictions become a bit more difficult.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, if we could just talk about rail<br />
transport again. Mr Newell has called for motor rail and<br />
rail services to be restored in the region. Is the<br />
chance of that happening likely to occur?<br />
PM: Well I don't want to be misleading on that. I respond<br />
to that by saying that I believe there is an urgent </p>
<p>A 7<br />
necessity for getting a national rail-road system in place<br />
which is going to be rational and effective. Now I intend<br />
to have discussions with the States about this issue. How<br />
that particular service would fit into that I just can't say<br />
at this stage. But I can understand the concerns that have<br />
been expressed by Mr Newell but I can't make a promise about<br />
that. I think it will a part of an overall consideration.<br />
What's important for the nation is that we get a better and<br />
more integrated system than we've had in the past.<br />
JOURNALIST: In your speech you spoke about Japanese<br />
investment, or overseas investment<br />
PM: I didn't mention Japan as I recall.<br />
JOURNALIST: overseas investment in manufacturing and in<br />
services. Do you feel that investment in land and property<br />
is covered in that same<br />
PM: I think, I mean you can't say to the rest of the world,<br />
at least I don't think you can rationally say to the rest of<br />
the world look we want your investment in our country for<br />
this purpose but we won't have it for another. I mean they<br />
are likely to say well I won't put it in the vernacular<br />
but they could express rather rudely what you could do with<br />
your country. So I think what involved, we've got to<br />
say yes we are part of the world community and we welcome<br />
investment not only in manufacturing and services but in<br />
land. But the qualifications that I expressed exist. I<br />
mean we just have to be intelligent without being stupidly<br />
jingoistic, acknowledge that any country has a right to get<br />
a balance between foreign investment and a natural desire<br />
for a national automony in economic matters. When you say<br />
that, that means that on certain investments you'll get what<br />
may be a quite legitimate difference of view as to whether<br />
you're coming down on the right side. But my overwhelming<br />
point is that we must, as a matter of principle, welcome<br />
foreign investment. The worst thing that we could do in<br />
this country for the future of our kids would be to create<br />
the impression generally, and you mentioned Japan in<br />
particular, or with Japan, that people are not welcome here<br />
and their money is not welcome here. Because the realities<br />
are that Japan for instance is our major trading partner.<br />
As far as we can see into the future they're going to remain<br />
a massively important trading partner. If we are going to<br />
see our future, as it inevitably will be enmeshed in Asia,<br />
which is the most dynamic and fastest growing region of the<br />
world, then it's important that Asia sees us as a country<br />
which wants to be part of the development of the region.<br />
Now that's necessary for the benefit of our kids and future<br />
generations. So that's the way we've got to see it and the<br />
way we've got to handle it.<br />
JOURNALIST: What would you see as an appropriate degree of<br />
overseas ownership in a privatised Qantas or Australian<br />
Airlines? </p>
<p>8<br />
PM: I would very firmly have the view that in such a<br />
situation the majority ownership and control should be in<br />
Australian hands. I mean that's the major issue. Then just<br />
where the minority level was held well I'd have some<br />
flexibility about that. But my point is that ownership<br />
control, majority ownership control must remain in<br />
Australian hands.<br />
JOURNALIST: On Australian Airlines, one more if I may. If<br />
Australian Airlines is sold off to private interests, would<br />
you prevent Sir Peter Abeles from coming in to buy it?<br />
PM: Not only would I prevent that I'm glad on this final<br />
question that that question has been raised. Because I<br />
notice that some informed people, including one ex-Minister<br />
of mine, has uttered the absurdity that what Hawke's about<br />
is selling off to Sir Peter Abeles. If I wanted to help Sir<br />
Peter Abeles in regard to the airlines, the best thing I<br />
could do would be do kill off the privatisation debate.<br />
That's the best thing that could happen for Sir Peter<br />
Abeles. You leave an Australian national airline starved of<br />
funds and just gradually being privatised by market share<br />
with Abeles getting more of the market. The worst thing for<br />
Sir Peter Abeles, I would think, would be a reinvigorated<br />
Australian national airline providing him more competition<br />
with greater access to more capital from the private sector.<br />
That's the biggest challenge for Sir Peter. Under no plan<br />
that I have would Ansett be able to acquire any interest in<br />
Australian national Airlines.<br />
