TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE MION P. J. KEATING MP<br />
DOORSTOP, MARITIM HOTEL, BONN, TUESDAY, 7 MARCH 1995<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
PMVI Ihis morning I met with the Presidlent of the Federal Republic and, of<br />
course, a meeting and iuflcn with the Chancellor. Perhaps I mnight deal<br />
wih the Chancellor's meetiNg anid lunch first and say I think rarely have I<br />
had a discusiv1 as good as this one, we found substantial common<br />
cause in Germany and Australia doing more things together. This3 is the<br />
third largest economy in the world. Our investments here are reasonably<br />
small so too are they in Australia. There is no cause why this should be<br />
so. They are now interested in the Aoia-Pacific 03 Wc are. They want to<br />
do more things there. I think they are inclined to be doing more with us.<br />
The Chancellor proposed some things and so did 1. One was ho thought<br />
that wc should have a cultural agreement between our two countries. He<br />
couldn't understand why this hadn't happened in the past. I told him that I<br />
thought we should be underpinning investment more strongly between us.<br />
saying that there is going to be an Australian German Rusiness<br />
Association Convention later in the year, which I will be attending and I<br />
asked him wh~ ether one of his senior Ministers mightr attendl and he<br />
concurred inl that<br />
He was surprised nlow much of a common) view uf tha wui Id we had. We<br />
had a long discussion aout Europe, about Germany's role in Europe,<br />
about Itic future of the European monetary system, about how Curope<br />
mlight develop in the future, Germanys historic opportunity and we had a<br />
long discussion about the Asia-Pacific, about the role of thio various<br />
countries, how we saw the Asia-Pacific and thon, of course, how we<br />
might do more together. </p>
<p>TEL: . Mar. 95 10 : 24 No .007 P. 02/ 03<br />
We also had a discussion about Germany and German history which is<br />
one of my interests and German architecture and a few other things which<br />
he was very interested in. He paid me the compliment at the end by<br />
saying sometimes I do these things as a chore, this has been a real<br />
pleasure and it was for Me too.<br />
I met the President this morning and again I had a very good discussion.<br />
one of the paints I made to the Chancellor and the President was that on<br />
this question about the convergence criteria in Europe to join the<br />
European Union, the only three countries in the OECD who fit the<br />
convergence criteria are Germany, Luxenburg and Australia. So, it is a<br />
measure of how competitive Australia is and a measure of the standing of<br />
our economy that in this rigorous convergence criteria in Europe, outside<br />
of Germany and Luxenburg, the only other country in the developed world<br />
that would qualify this year is Australia. I hope my opponents In Australia<br />
might take some note of that.<br />
This was a telling point, I think, with the Chancellor and the President, but<br />
I also asked the President about his role, the role of an appointed<br />
President, in the Federal Republic. He made a couple of telling points<br />
about it being a non-political position, that him not being a member of a<br />
political party, that speaking for the country was something he thought<br />
Germans wished him to do, but doing it in a way which didn't bear upon<br />
the executive prerogatives of the Government. He said these things had<br />
all been thought about in 1949 and he was sure that Germans had<br />
designed their constitution well, looking at past history. 1 told him we<br />
were having a similar debate in Australia and was very interested In his<br />
view of his role here in this constitution and then in this Republic.<br />
I think they were both, the President and the Chancellor, very agreeable<br />
in terms of me telling them the changes In Australia and of our economic<br />
circumstances of our outward external orientation, our commitment to<br />
growth with low inflation, the fact that at CeBIT we will have 200<br />
companies high technology companies that we are no longer just a<br />
producer of coal and iron ore and wool and wheat and tourism, but also of<br />
high technology products and they see. I think, Australia being a really<br />
useful interlocker for them in the Asia-Pacific.<br />
So, I rated both meetings highly successful.<br />
J: Mr Keating, do you think the German model of a non-elected President is<br />
one worth examining more closely in the Australian context?<br />
PM: I think his point was that were It to be an elected * person, the political<br />
parties would operate the election and that a political person would be </p>

wamwite He thought German's felt more comfortable with somebody who<br />
could speak for the nation but was not partisan,<br />
J: Prime Minister. itituteslingly enough in Singapore now they have gone the<br />
othier way. They nlow have an elected President.<br />
PM: This is the largest republic in Europe and It has got a long history and tho<br />
1949 coflStitution was eY, very well thought over, comprehensively<br />
thought over and thought through. There are all sonls of models of<br />
presidencies around tho world wh'ere there is a lot of executive power in<br />
the Amorican Presidency and the French Presidency, but this is a<br />
parliamentary democracy, with parliamentary reprsentativA Government,<br />
at, we have it. It was just interesting, ttwAr are not too many of these, so<br />
when one Meets the President one at least asks.<br />
J; Do you think our P'arliament couldI ever agree?<br />
PM: I think, this Parliament In Germany agreesj, anid it'Ut Geii Parliament<br />
can, tho Australian Parliament could.<br />
J: What albuut the Australian people, Mr Keeting, there seems to bo a<br />
preference at the moment for an elected prosidcnt ratheir than an<br />
appointed president<br />
PM. We are having a debate on this as a motion wnd there will be 2tages in<br />
this debate end one of tho stages will be whore the Government says<br />
where it stands on this issue and the public will then debate these thing. s<br />
But, I have got no doubt that when one invests the nation in a person, In a<br />
reprosentative sense as it the mae here with the German Presidency, the<br />
fact that that person isn't elected and draws political authority In a<br />
partisan way, a party political way from the constituency of the country,<br />
moans that our system Mf Government doesn't chlange and the systein of<br />
government didn't mnange here and It wouldn't U itnge under those<br />
circumstAneps In Australia. In other words. the representative democracy<br />
we have where members of Parliament are actually relating to their<br />
Constituency know the oirgenisation. know the municipal authority, know<br />
the parents and friends association, know all the representative groups, it<br />
is a very comprehensive represetation process. That is what they have<br />
here and, at least, President Herzog said that he thought that the German<br />
people wished him to speak for them, but not in a partisan way.<br />
J. Prime Minister, what is your reaction to Graham Richardson's suggestion<br />
that ho had spoken to you about dealings with Packer anti r12aiming that<br />
he had tried to convince you there was no deal? </p>
