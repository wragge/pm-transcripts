    <content><![CDATA[<p>E&amp;OE..........................................................................................................................</p>
<p>Thank you very much, Sally-Anne; to Mr Samaranch, the President of</p>
<p> the International Olympic Committee; to Doctor Primo Debiolo; to my</p>
<p> parliamentary colleague, Andrew Thomson, the Federal Minister for</p>
<p> Sport; to the Chairman of the Organising Committee, Mr Michael Knight;</p>
<p> to Frank Sartor, the Lord Mayor of Sydney; to John Coates, the President</p>
<p> of the Australian Olympic Committee, other very distinguished guests,</p>
<p> ladies and gentlemen.</p>
<p>May I, as Prime Minister of Australia, welcome all of our overseas</p>
<p> visitors to this very important gathering. And can I say, not only</p>
<p> as the Australian Prime Minister but also as someone who has had Sydney</p>
<p> as his home town for all of his life, say to all of our visitors just</p>
<p> how tremendously excited all Australians are about the prospect of</p>
<p> hosting the Olympic Games here in Sydney in the year 2000.</p>
<p>Australians are, as many of you know, great sports loving people.</p>
<p> Sport has defined the character of the Australian nation and the Australian</p>
<p> people, perhaps like no other nation on earth. It is a source of enormous</p>
<p> pride to Australians that we share, with Greece, the honour of being</p>
<p> one of the only two countries that have participated in all of the</p>
<p> Olympics of the modern era. But when it is borne in mind that in 1896</p>
<p> Australia got formally federated as a nation and we have a population</p>
<p> of probably only four million people, that is a remarkable achievement.</p>
<p>I know that Sydney will host the Games in 2000 with style, with flair</p>
<p> and, I believe, with ease. I want to congratulate those responsible</p>
<p> for organising the Games for the tremendous work they have already</p>
<p> achieved. I believe the complimentary remarks made by the President,</p>
<p> Mr Samaranch, are well deserved and well merited.</p>
<p>I want to say, on behalf of the Federal Government, that this is a</p>
<p> united Australian effort. It brings great pride and credit to Sydney</p>
<p> but, above all, it is a compliment to all Australians.</p>
<p>The Games in the year 2000 will belong to all Australians. We will</p>
<p> have the opportunity to showcase our magnificent nation to the rest</p>
<p> of the world. And being the great sports lovers that we are, we will</p>
<p> barrack like never before for the achievements and the successes of</p>
<p> the Australian team. All Australians drew great pleasure and store</p>
<p> from the achievements of our team at Atlanta and we look forward,</p>
<p> eagerly, to the efforts of our team in Sydney in the year 2000.</p>
<p>May I congratulate you, Mr President, on your very strong statement</p>
<p> about drugs in sport. Can I say that my Government totally shares</p>
<p> your feelings and we believe the very high standard you have set by</p>
<p> those remarks is well merited.</p>
<p>I see the Olympic Games as a tremendous opportunity not only to showcase</p>
<p> Australia to the world but once again to bring together the young</p>
<p> men and women of the world in open enthusiasm and competition.</p>
<p>Sport can unite and enable and encourage and can inspire the best</p>
<p> in men and women. And I'm very proud, as Prime Minister of Australia,</p>
<p> that my country, our country, will play a central role in these great</p>
<p> Games at the turn of the century.</p>
<p>I hope all of you enjoy your time in Sydney. I promise you continuing</p>
<p> hospitality. I promise you a great and rapturous welcome in the year</p>
<p> 2000. And my Government will do all it can to make the Games of the</p>
<p> year 2000 the most memorable yet. Thank you. I formally open the conference</p>
<p> and I welcome you all.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>[Ends]</p>
