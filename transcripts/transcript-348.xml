Sir, YOar 1 xcll]* n, and ladies and gentlewen, and fellow studentst<br />
I want to telU you that I have a hat here which it In<br />
eonsider~ d correct to put on. ( Laughter) Like that. ( Tau6-h1: r)<br />
And once one baa put it on and lifted It with due reverence ii the<br />
right quarters one takes it off arnd i1ves it to an Innocent<br />
bys tander. (? aughter)<br />
I was truumendously Interested in the cable from R* rvoy,<br />
( Laeghter) There was one thing missing In the cables I would have<br />
expee~ d tfat It would have ended up () illect" ( Laughtr) I don't<br />
know w~ hat makes as think of that except that I anm in Wes tern<br />
Australia. ( Laushter) You have been reminded by the Chairnan, with<br />
some difficulty I gatheredi, that I an Prim Minister ( Laaghte: and I<br />
very well remember that Shen I was first Prime Binister, mRAWan<br />
years zi ( Laughter) I had a telegram from 4estern Austrzaliaq from a<br />
representative of the wheat-growers who, as sowe of you, the iwre<br />
literate among you, may know produce a political commodity called<br />
" wheat, This telegram said to so tVat unless something was done<br />
for the Western Australian wheat growers all. would fail, all would<br />
come to &amp; n end and cmnfusion. At the end of this long, argumentative<br />
and costly telegram, he ended up br saying * or position is P)<br />
doubtful, so daniprous that I an sending this telegram ceallmt'".<br />
( Lamahter) I'm not ping to be disingenuous ensough to say tthat I<br />
paid for It personally; but we did, In the office* Anid later~ on the<br />
wretched man came into Parliament. ( Laughter)<br />
how what I really want to say to you Is that I think this Is<br />
about as remarkable an event as I've ever been invited to tako pat<br />
in be cause I an not unaomaatomed o ion my friend the Premier could<br />
tell, you this to having cases put to as which involve som finding<br />
of may from, the inexhaustible purse of the Coinnve-alth. Ide<br />
in the university field it has been my ovn great plesure and great<br />
prIvIleam to have something to do with the remrible develojimnt In<br />
Universities in the last few years, something that 1 hope I irill, be<br />
permitted to be proud of and wihich has involved an enormous<br />
co-operativ effort between ioneath Government, 3 tate 3Ornnts<br />
and a mass of people intereste in higher education in AustraLia.<br />
11ut this I think,, Sir, is the first occasion on which I have been<br />
invited to open a fine 9. ldan gc ostly building, paid for by the<br />
personal sacrifice and efforts of undergraduates. 1 think th-is Is a<br />
remarkable event. ( Applause)<br />
I don't want to flatter you unruly characters ( Laughter)<br />
unly but I am bon to say that this is the nest spectacnaJi piece<br />
of self-help tlat I have seen In this field. This Is a vondewrful<br />
per formanice and would lke to congratulate everybody who hans been<br />
connected with it.,<br />
I think : it Is partiamlarly appropriate that it shoulda taks<br />
the form that it does for residential and what 1 will callg in a<br />
broad way social purposes. Things have moved on a lot in modern<br />
times. Ww~ n I was at the University of Melbourne and it may shook<br />
some of you to knw that 1 " a once at a University, ( Laughter) the<br />
amenities, If I may call then suchg for students were very skestchy,<br />
I don'tt know that we had very much enter,. rise in those days; or<br />
perhaps we veren't as rich as you are now* Juat certainly we ! didn't<br />
dream of things like this. It is terribly Important that they should<br />
have been dreamed of and brought to performance here because it helps<br />
to remind us of the true character of a university educzition.<br />
The University sads : or not simply the provision of the<br />
means of instruction,, the means of teaching, though they aire, of<br />
eourms essential, Overy tUnlvarsity today knows that it has great<br />
problems about the number of staff compared to the evor-rising<br />
number of people who want University training, or tertiary edacation </p>
<p>of on kind or another, This is an enomus problem not oully of<br />
money, but a great problem of tz'ainin, and procuring tenecessary<br />
standairds. of staff. This is a problem that I think will be a<br />
teasing one over the next five or six years than perhaps any other<br />
proulen we have<br />
But all that relates to instruction, to teachiig., it<br />
inclades the provision of equipment -M equipment wthich, todayll If it<br />
is to be of the proper 3tnard Is infinitely more complex,<br />
infinitely more expensive than it ever was before.<br />
Jut a Univarstty doesn't exist just f'or some to twich<br />
or for others to be taught. It is not an undesirable t: An,, that in<br />
addi tion to sitting in lectures, one should do a little stA4Pj<br />
tocln on thn edniogt here J~ ut when we have c. : sllored<br />
tei-_._ ii; Itelfwih~ al hecalls taitmakes onpeople o1f reat<br />
Ã± Mai nd of great dedic-jtiofl, and we add to that thne stidy that a<br />
staiit must put in on his own &amp; a. countif he is to reap tti Ail<br />
tiarest of being at a great Ulniversity we should then ijdd to those<br />
the third element of dniversity education by no means the 14iast<br />
which is contact 14ith students the learning to live in a attidents?<br />
society, the subtle iLndefinable, educational quality of rabbing<br />
shoulders with people, people who are in other faculties aighter)<br />
Us., I kno... I ai1Abt hL-e known somebody would be ahead of uw.<br />
( L, au~ hter) 3ut you know 1 think that a lot of people who are not<br />
diractly concerned with universities soumetimes fail to roalive that<br />
what seems to some of tl-e no". dour among them to be a waste of<br />
time -the social life that exists in a placo like this* the life<br />
of Vin~ p laying fields the argraaents that go on of a highly<br />
specalative, and somehmues violent kind, the infinite superimwity<br />
of zhe second year medical student over the poor humblet final, year<br />
1a4 student -( Laughter) are all 3plendid things because they sean<br />
thit in a strange way, such is the wisdom of providence, tho<br />
studentse are educating each other.<br />
flow that is the great point albout a university, rtht~ t is<br />
the Zret point about bringing people together in a place like<br />
this, the 4rout. point about them. having some social existencmi In<br />
the student body, of having ontact with other minds and othor<br />
disci~ plines* The ; reat value of this is that it broadeiw tte mind<br />
and sends out not merely a highly skilled eraduate in a teacnial<br />
way, but a developed human being who can be a &amp; ood altisen arid a<br />
wiise man or a wise woman.<br />
Therefbre I approve . if that mans anything PrOveO<br />
warrly of what has boen done here, not ozilj because it is a<br />
nazalficient example of self.-help, but because, I believe that this<br />
kind of thing Is of the essence of aL university, M4y own appaoach<br />
to t-e financial problem of universities for the last can years has<br />
bean fzom the very beginninj that It isn't enouagh just to provvide<br />
tho " inimm classrooms. I have always believed it Zoos far toyand<br />
these thin~ s. Sarly in daalin&amp; with this na, er the questioi<br />
cropped up, for example, about residential colleges and my fIrst<br />
comittee wasn' t v ry interested in doinj anything about -thau. I<br />
saidj You must Include some ra zjaondation about residerstia.,<br />
ool o~ res even small ones, but we must have same*, And z; w nser<br />
quite common at that time was " Buat these are frills, residential<br />
coLleg; es are frills# halls of residence are ilrills; uni n houses<br />
nre : rills". T~ his is a pretty stark outlookc on university tzaining.<br />
and from begtinning to end I have said " I voa't have this. A<br />
University must be a body which is a comprehensive arffir, tieft<br />
caters not only for the bare minima of teachingv the batre minima of<br />
acoomo-dation, libraries and so on, but provides also for ths,<br />
altinnte production of men and women of consequence*.<br />
I want to say quite seriously to all of you that the </p>
<p>3.<br />
fttur, of Australia., the wisdomi of this ountry the truie otandig<br />
of this oountry, h4 true level ofeivilisation Ini this country w<br />
depend far more upon those who are now undergr4uastes and who~ are<br />
Zetting the advantag* of these things, and the responhibiiity of<br />
these things, than they will. upon people like myself 4~ ho have<br />
grovn, or are proving old in the servioe of the country.<br />
Rovever there it is, it is in a real ionsa iii your hands;<br />
ann the measure ofthe success of this university this re'latively<br />
yoang university, will in the long run be thei kin&amp; of people it<br />
sends out and sent out not only into . jestern ', ustrilla but Into<br />
Australit. and the -orld, their quality and their contritlton.<br />
And this is really, all Joking apart, a splendid exanpbe<br />
of imagination on the pairt o! ttm undergraduateo body, niot ody<br />
self.-sacrifice in a monetary way# but of Imagination and lbrexight*<br />
Sir, f'or all those reasons I am deli,; htc1 to tt,'-eze even<br />
tft* u-gh it do'qs involve me putting, on at gown,% I aight to Alain<br />
this gown to you: I have been made an honorary ; raduate oi'a great<br />
number of universities for some reason or other I o Otem much<br />
more easily than I got my own de.&amp; roes In M~ elbourne in r. V ' iii time<br />

a villainous combiition of oolours (! Aughter) 11 1~ : mnoi &amp; ebout it<br />
