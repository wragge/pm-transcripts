-I L SOVIET EXPANSIONISM MUST BE KRSIST_\<br />

Association and the N. S. W. Department of Agriculture at<br />
Rothbury Estate, Pokolbin Friday, 18th January, 1980.<br />
One of the things that has been very much on the<br />
Government's mind in the last few days has been our relations<br />
with the Soviet Union.<br />
Trade between Australia and the Soviet Union is<br />
getting to the point where it runs about 70 to one in our favour.<br />
To some people, this might be the over-riding consideration.<br />
There's no need for me here to go through all the<br />
implications for our relationship of current events in<br />
Afghanistan except to say that the Government is very deeply<br />
concerned about what has happened in that country, and about<br />
the course of events in the future.<br />
What this fresh focussing of interest on the Soviet<br />
Union does is remind us that'there are ways of life and<br />
systems of government very different from our own.<br />
We are reminded that our people and our industric<br />
exist and operate under regimes that differ vastly from those<br />
of some other coun: ries.<br />
Our agriculture, for example, is affected quite<br />
directly not only by the weather, but by the economic airv<br />
political systems under which it exists.<br />
In free-enterprise societies like ours, people know<br />
that they can apply their skills and their initiative, use<br />
their capital and their physical strength, to embark on<br />
enterprises which, if they succeed, will bring them rewards<br />
of many kinds. They know they are free to take risks, to be stimulated<br />
by the incentive of likely rewards.<br />
But in a country like the Soviet Union, things are<br />
very different and we ought to remember that they're different.<br />
Certainly Russia's harsh climate is a big burden on<br />
its agricultural industries, but I think the Soviet Union's<br />
political and ecolnom: ic system is an important factor, iin Lhat<br />
country's failure to keep pace with the wesiern nat: ionri in<br />
agricultural ind other development.<br />
From what I've seen in the Soviet Union, and fro-my<br />
reading, I've gained the impression that the Soviet systcm of<br />
sociali. 3m is the fundamental cause of the sluggishness, the<br />
ponderousness, the inefficiency of the Soviet economy. / 2 </p>
<p>One shudders to think how the wine industry's<br />
enterprising moves into the development of the tourist business<br />
might have fared under the inadequacies and stultifying influence<br />
of a Soviet-style system.<br />
The point I'm making to: lay is t Lli, Sov . ieL t-: i<br />
comcs out very badly in a comparison with our own.<br />
We have a political and economic system, and a way of<br />
life, that are worth safeguarding.<br />
We have a responsibility to do whatever we can to<br />
resist the efforts of the Soviet Union to impose its will on<br />
others. We must understand that the Soviet Union is determined<br />
to expand its influence and its control and its inefficient<br />
system. These ambitions clearly are reaching into the regions<br />
of the world of which we are part, and we cannot ignore what<br />
is happening. We face greatly changed international circumstanres<br />
as the Soviet Union pursues its aims, and Australia must. ( do all<br />
it can to prepare itself to respond to those changed circums'tances<br />
as sensibly and realistically as it can. </p>
