Journalisti Should Simon Crean step down as leader of the<br />
ACTU? Prime Minister: I don't believe so and I can speak with a<br />
certain amount of experience on this I don't think that<br />
there has to be the sort of gap that would be available if<br />
you step down now because the election as I have said could<br />
be as far away as the middle of next year. I have said the<br />
election will be from the latter part of this year until May<br />
or June of next year. I think it will be appropriate that<br />
there are certain activities of the ACTU from which Simon<br />
would disassociate himself and it is quite clear already<br />
for instance that he would not be involved in the wage/ tax<br />
negotiations that we will be having and he and Kelty have an<br />
appropriate sense of understanding in those matters but<br />
there is still many duties in the ACTU presidency which he<br />
will be able to continue to fulfil with great competency and<br />
authority as he has up to this point.<br />
Journalist: Mr Hawker is Simon Crean good enough to<br />
eventually fill your shoes?<br />
Prime Minister: I have said, yes, that I think he would<br />
make a good Prime Minister. No one ever fills anyone elses<br />
shoes they are different. I mean Simon didn't fill my shoes<br />
as the President of the ACTU but that doesn't mean he hasn't<br />
been as good a President. I mean different people do the<br />
Sjob in different ways and I think that Simon has the<br />
V capacity to make an immediate contribution to the good<br />
Government of this country once he comes into the Parliament<br />
and ultimately yes he can be a Prime Minister.<br />
Journalist: Do you think he will replace Mr Keating as the<br />
man most likely to attempt to fill your shoes?<br />
Prime Minister: I have answered that on last Sunday I said<br />
I believe that Paul Keating is still the front runner but it<br />
is going to be good to have a situation and I am sure Paul<br />
agrees with me it im gning to bo good, thai when the time<br />
comes that I do retire, that the Party will have a range of<br />
people to choose from within the immediate sense and to have<br />
a spectrum from whom to think about for a longer period. </p>
<p>Journalists Mr Hawke what is your reaction on the<br />
Indonesian courts decision on the Blenkinsop shooting?<br />
Prime Minister: Let me say these things about that. I can<br />
understand that the family of Mr Blenkinsop would have a<br />
feeling that perhaps the sentence is too lenient, I can<br />
understand that feeling. But let me say this, that on all<br />
the evidence that we have had the Indonesians have conducted<br />
this trial strictly in accordance with the Indonesian legal<br />
processes. You will recall that at the time I made a very<br />
very strong statement that this sort of action that has<br />
taken place can not be accepted and tolerated. And the<br />
Indonesians to their credit have made sure that the<br />
processes normally followed should be followed and indeed in<br />
this case two things can be said. They made sure that a<br />
representative of the Australian Embassy was able to be<br />
present at all times and inripri the prnceedings were open to<br />
foreign reporters beyond the way in which they normally<br />
would be. So I think that there is no basis upon which we<br />
are able to argue that the processes, the Indonesian<br />
processes, haven't been followed and having said that I can<br />
understand some feeling on the part of the Blenkinsop family<br />
0 but Australia is not in a position where we tell other<br />
countries how to run their judici~ al processes. All I can<br />
say is that their normal processes seem to have been<br />
followed. Journalist: so you won't be seeking any sort of an appeal?<br />
Prime Minister: Well, it is not for the Australian<br />
Government to be seeking any sort of appeal. I mean, that<br />
is not the role of Government.<br />
Journalist: mr Hawk. what do you think of the decision to<br />
start work on the pulp mill in Tasmania?<br />
Prime minister: Well let's get it clear they haven't<br />
started work on the mill. As I understand how they have<br />
rationalised what they are doing, they say they have a very<br />
tight timetable to meet what they see as their deadline of<br />
completion by the middle of 1991. And so they have decided<br />
to do some preliminary sort of road work in this period.<br />
Because they say that a sort of period of 3 weeks or so<br />
which will be involved before we would make a decision is<br />
something that ought to be used. Whether they have done<br />
anything or not will not affect our decision. The position<br />
is we have a longstanding agreement with Mr Gray, very<br />
simply says the Tasmanian Parliament will make its decision.<br />
When they have made its decision it will be transmitted to<br />
us then my Ministers involved will make recommendations and<br />
submissions and the Cabinet will consider those and make a<br />
decision and we will make it expeditiously.<br />
JournalistjL So you don't think it improper that the<br />
preliminar-. y wnrk... </p>
<p>Prime Minister: There is nothing improper, it is their<br />
property. They own the property on which they are working<br />
it is a matter for them to make that decision that doesn't<br />
involve any irreversible sort of outcome and it certainly<br />
will be not something we will take into account because they<br />
decided to spend some money on preparing a road. That will<br />
have no bearing on our decision.<br />
Journalist: in other words the risk is on their heads?<br />
Prime Minister: Well yes it is their expenditure. It is a<br />
decision they made, they are perfectly entitled. If you own<br />
an area and you want to start to build a road, well okay<br />
start to build a road. But that won't influence our<br />
decision. Journalist: mr Hawke how do you feel about the number of<br />
places that haven't lowered their flags today?<br />
Prime Mi . nister: Well I am glad you asked me that question,<br />
I was very surprised to read my papers this morning that<br />
Hawke had backed down. Now let me make it quite clear that<br />
when you are Prime minister of this country you don't<br />
izsVVlVg YUU&amp; elf III eVOLy deuiuion made by eVeLy minister<br />
and every department. A decision was taken and was taken by<br />
the minister and the department according to normal<br />
practices. When it was brought to my attention I took the<br />
view that I could understand that in respect of places like<br />
the War Memorial, repatriation hospitals and gardens of<br />
remembrance, that in places like that I could understand the<br />
feeling of concern so while it was approrip ate that on<br />
normal government buildings the convent io'is should be<br />
followed and I insist that they should be. In those places<br />
I see no reason for not giving them the discretion. I can<br />
understand the feelings of people that they wouldn't want in<br />
those places to have the flag at have mast and it was<br />
appropriate that they be given that discretion. So there<br />
was no question of backing down on my part once the issue<br />
was before me I made the decision which I thought and think<br />
is appropriate. Let me make it clear that in doing that I<br />
don't in any way retract from the position which the<br />
Australian community knows full well is my position. And<br />
that is in terms of Australia's welfare now and for future<br />
generations we must understand the reality that Japan is a<br />
major trading partner and it would be a gross dereliction of<br />
duty on the part of anyone in Australia to not<br />
understand that fact and not to do everything we can to<br />
ensure that Australia's opportunties of trade and investment<br />
with Japan should be increased because that is going to be<br />
to the benefit of this country and may I say to the benefit<br />
of the region. Within that framework, however, on this<br />
particular issue in regard to those buildings and places I<br />
don't see any reason why the sensitivities of some<br />
Australians should be upset.<br />
Journalist: will you be working with the opposition to<br />
sLuduu Lhae yiveLLy of youth in Australia </p>
<p>Prime Minister: well as I have said, i am often very<br />
critical of the opposition and Mr Howard and I will continueto<br />
be on many things and I must say unequivocally I welcome<br />
the reaction of Mr Howard that this was not a matter for<br />
party political point scoring and I welcome that and that<br />
will be my attitude as i had cause to say inside here. The<br />
position is one where the whole of Australia must share a<br />
sense of tragedy that there are so many young people who are<br />
in this condition. Let me just make the point in regard to<br />
what I said in the election campaign in 1987 that statement<br />
was made sincerely and is being sincerely fulfilled and it<br />
will be the case that by 1990 there will be no financial<br />
need for any child in Australia to live in poverty. But as<br />
I say you can't by Government see it stop the interaction of<br />
social and personal forces which mean that kids leave home<br />
or are thrown out of home. So what Governments, the<br />
community and the Australian families together have to do to<br />
face u-this problem. Let me remind you as I said yesterday<br />
that we have had a 507% increase in the money that we have<br />
made available for refuges in this country since we have<br />
been in office. There has never been an increase in funding<br />
like we have made. Last October with a Minister I made an<br />
offer of another $ 40 million to the States for additional<br />
funding to help the homeless and those in crisis. So we<br />
will do the sorts of things in a financial way that are<br />
necessary. After we have considered the report in detail I<br />
will then meet and talk with the Premiers, and I hope that<br />
the attitude expressed by Mr Howard will be reflected by the<br />
Governments of either political persuasions and I hope that<br />
together and together with community organisations we can<br />
make some in-road to helping those in this present position<br />
and also if we can to creating a better attitude in the<br />
community so that families where ultimately this<br />
responsibility rests will be in a better situation that we<br />
won't have so many kids in this tragic situation.<br />
Journalist: So what is the forecast for 1990 now?<br />
Prime minister: The forecast for 1990 is as I have put it<br />
and that is, that as a result of the outlays of well over<br />
half a billion dollars additional money which is a result<br />
from my promise of 1987 there will be no financial need for<br />
any child to live in poverty as I have said right from ' 87.<br />
And it really is a very uncomplicated matter and I can't<br />
understand why, and it seems to be a Melbourne problem more<br />
than any other, I don't know whether you have your mental<br />
processes a bit coagulated here, but it is a very<br />
uncomplex situation and I am surprised now that after two<br />
years you can't quite understand it. A Government can make<br />
a promise that it will outlay over half a billion dollars by<br />
increased family allowance supplements so that that money<br />
will be made available into families and there will be no<br />
financial need as a result of that decision for any child to<br />
live in poverty because we would have provided the money to<br />
eliminate that financial need. There was never any<br />
situation in a democratic country where you can say now<br />
having provided that money that there won't be operating in </p>
<p>families either stupidity on the part of parents who are<br />
going to spend it on grog or the races rather than on the<br />
kid or any capacity on the Government to say that the kid is<br />
not going to run away from home or the parents are not going<br />
to throw them out. No Government in a democracy can affect<br />
that situation. I made a promise, which will be delivered,<br />
that there is no financial need for any child to live in<br />
poverty.<br />
