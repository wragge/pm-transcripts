FOR MEDIA 22 MARCH 1989<br />
JOINT STATEMENT FROM THE PRIME MINISTER AND<br />
THE MINISTER FOR TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS,<br />
THE HON RALPH WILLIS<br />
The Government has decided to develop a third runway at<br />
Kingsford-Smith Airport ( KSA) subject to the satisfactory<br />
completion of normal EIS processes, and to begin the development<br />
of a second airport at Badgery's Creek.<br />
The proposed mode of operation for the third runway would not<br />
allow departures to the north, and would confine use of the eastwest<br />
runway to circumstances when adverse weather conditions<br />
preclude the use of other runways for safety reasons.<br />
Preparation of an EIS for a medium-spaced parallel runway at KSA<br />
will start immediately.<br />
Local resident groups, local councils and all other interested<br />
parties will be invited to participate fully in the EIS<br />
processes. The EIS will consider, among other things, the noise<br />
and social effects of the third runway and its environmental<br />
impact on Botany Bay and surrounding areas.<br />
The Government will move now to acquire the remainder of the land<br />
needed for the development of Badgery's Creek. A General<br />
Aviation facility will be constructed immediately, as a first<br />
stage. In anticipation that the second stage will<br />
provide for both domestic and international services, detailed<br />
design work will commence immediately. Consultations will be<br />
undertaken as soon as possible with the State Government on such<br />
issues as road and rail access, provision of State utilities,<br />
land use zoning and the need for relocation of existing<br />
infrastructure. Traffic management measures at KSA will be implemented within the<br />
next few months. These will include a reduction in General<br />
Aviation traffic at KSA during peak hours and measures to<br />
alleviate the problems caused by the common domestic airline<br />
practice of cluster scheduling. There will be urgent<br />
consultations on these matters with the aviation industry and the<br />
State Government. </p>

These decisions have been taken following an exhaustive analysis<br />
of the economic and aviation policy aspects of all options for<br />
meeting Sydney's airport needs. The complexity of the issues<br />
required the most sophisticated analysis yet undertaken of the<br />
interaction between demand growth, airport capacity and traffic<br />
management at Sydney. This analysis, conducted by Commonwealth<br />
officials, reveals that the economically rational option is to<br />
build a third runway at KSA subject to an EIS, and proceed with<br />
the development of Badgery's Creek but not on a fast-track basis.<br />
The decision to build a third runway will not result in an<br />
increase in the number of people severely affected by aircraft<br />
noise. Indeed, the Government is advised that the number of such<br />
people will decline from 56,200 at present to about 35,500; that<br />
is, a decline of 20,700 or 37 per cent. This will be made<br />
possible by a combination of new generation quieter aircraft and<br />
greatly reduced usage of the present east-west runway. There<br />
would be a noise reduction of approximately three-quarters in the<br />
local government areas affected by operation of the east-west<br />
runway ( Hurstville, Kogarah, Rockdale, Botany and Randwick).<br />
There would be an increase of one quarter in areas to the north<br />
of the airport ( Ryde, Hunter's Hill, Lane Cove, Leichhardt,<br />
Marrickville, Drummoyne, Sydney).<br />
In present economic circumstances the Government cannot justify<br />
the expenditure of more than $ 2 billion on an ambitious and early<br />
development of a full-scale international airport at Badgery's<br />
Creek. The development of Badgery's Creek will proceed at a pace<br />
consistent with anticipated growth in traffic demand for the<br />
Sydney region.<br />
The decisions the Government has taken were not simple or easy<br />
ones. They have been taken in the long range national interest<br />
and, in particular, of Sydney as Australia's principal<br />
international gateway. They represent the most decisive action<br />
by any Government to resolve the Sydney airport issue and to<br />
position Sydney to meet our aviation needs into the next century. </p>
