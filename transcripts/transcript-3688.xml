Press Statement No. 491<br />
8 April 1975<br />
HIGH COURT OF AUSTRALIA BUILDING<br />
Work will begin this month on the construction<br />
of a building for the High Court of Australia. The building<br />
is expected to be completed in three and a half years.<br />
The project, the contract price of which is<br />
$ 18.4 million, has been awarded to PDC Constructions ( ACT)<br />
Pty Limited. This company is also building the Australian<br />
National Gallery, which is being built nearby and is of<br />
closely compatible architecture.<br />
The design of the building is the result of a<br />
major competition which began in mid-1972 and was won by<br />
the late Chris Kringas of the company Edwards Madigan Torzillo<br />
and Briggs, the architects who designed the Gallery.<br />
The High Court building will be one of Canberra's<br />
major national buildings located near the shores of Lake<br />
Burley Griffin in the Parliamentary Triangle where its siting<br />
will be related to Parliament House, the National Gallery<br />
( now under construction) and the National Library.<br />
The building will be 40 metres high and have a<br />
gross floor area of 18,515 square metres consisting of:<br />
* a large central public hall;<br />
* 3 courtrooms including the ceremonial court;<br />
* 8 storeys of administration, library and justices' chambers;<br />
* 2 levels of basement car parking;<br />
landscaping, ceremonial forecourt and site works.<br />
The predominant building material will be selected<br />
aggregate concrete using off-white cement. The exterior and<br />
some interior surfaces will be Natural Concrete.<br />
The public hall will be enclosed on the north<br />
and south by large window walls. The building will be fully<br />
air conditioned.<br />
