    <content><![CDATA[<p>I'm announcing today that the Government will bring forward the full amount of our Renewable Energy Fund  -  the full half billion dollars  -  for investment in the next 18 months.</p>
<p>$100 million will be available to be spent in 2008-09, and $400 million will be available in 2009-10, subject only to availability of suitable demonstration projects.</p>
<p>The Fund was established to help to reduce the cost of demonstrating and deploying key energy technologies that may play a critical role in energy supply and security over the next few decades.</p>
<p>The Renewable Energy Fund includes the Renewable Energy Demonstration Program, the $15 million Second Generation (Gen2) Biofuels Research and Development Program and the $50 million Geothermal Drilling Program.</p>
<p>Bringing forward this funding will:</p>
<p>     * Turbo charge investment in solar and renewable energy projects</p>
<p>     * complement the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme</p>
<p>     * stimulate the economy, and</p>
<p>     * create low pollution jobs of the future.</p>
<p>The Government believes the time has come to prepare a solar revolution, and renewables revolution, for Australia's future.</p>
<p>It's good for jobs and good for our low pollution future.</p>
<p>Applications for funding through the Geothermal Drilling Program close on 5 January 2009 and applications for funding through the Second Generation Biofuels Research and Development Program close on 30 January 2009.</p>
<p>We will be releasing the guidelines for applications to the Renewable Energy Demonstration Program early in the new year.</p>
