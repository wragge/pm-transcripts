NOTES FOR THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR THE OPENING OF EBER BUNKER'S HOUSE, COLLINGWOOD,<br />
LIVERPOOL, 6 SEPTEMBER 1975<br />
1. I IMAGINE IN MELBOURNE TODAY THERE WOULD BE<br />
A MUCH BIGGER CROWD TO SEE COLLINGWOOD THAN<br />
THERE IS HERE IN LIVERPOOL. IN MELBOURNE<br />
THEY HAVE A MUCH GREATER SENSE OF HISTORY.<br />
COLLINGWOOD FANS ARE NUMBERED IN THEIR<br />
THOUSANDS-ESPECIALLY ON SATURDAY AFTERNOONS,<br />
2. COLLINGWOOD WAS THE HOME OF CAPTAIN EBER BUNKER,<br />
THE FOUNDER OF THE AUSTRALIAN WHALING INDUSTRY.<br />
I HOPE NO ONE WILL CONFUSE EBER BUNKER<br />
WITH CLEAVER BUNTON. ONE LIVED IN A HOUSE IN<br />
LIVERPOOL AND THE OTHER SITS IN A HOUSE IN<br />
CANBERRA. BOTH HOUSES HAVE 19TH CENTURY<br />
ASSOCIATIONS AND ARE BADLY IN NEED OF REPAIR.<br />
3. LOOKING BACK THROUGH THE LIST OF FORMER OWNERS<br />
OF COLLINGWOOD, AFTER EBER BUNKER, I FIND THERE<br />
WERE INDUSTRIALISTS, PASTORALISTS, MEAT TYCOONS,<br />
LANDOWNERS AND DEVELOPERS, A FORMER TREASURER<br />
OF SIR SAUL SAMUEL, AND A SECRETARY OF<br />
THE AUSTRALIAN JOCKEY CLUB, GEORGE ROWE. THEY<br />
WERE ALL ADMIRABLE CITIZENS BUT NOT THE SORT OF<br />
PEOPLE WHO NORMALLY SUPPORT MY GOVERNMENT.<br />
WERRIWA WASN'T SUCH A SAFE LABOR SEAT IN THE OLD<br />
DAYS. SO IT'S AN UNEXPECTED HONOUR TO BE ASKED<br />
TO PERFORM THIS OPENING. ,/ 2 </p>
<p>14. WHENEVER I AM GIVEN THE KEYS TO A HOUSE, THE<br />
P-RESS AND THE OPPOSITION ACCUSE ME OF ACQUIRING<br />
ANOTHER OFFICIAL RESIDENCE. THE LODGE,<br />
KIRRIBILLI, AND NOW COLLINGWOOD, I WANT IT TO<br />
BE CLEARLY UNDERSTOOD THAT WHILE COLLINGWOOD<br />
IS IN MY ELECTORATE, IT IS NOT FOR MY PERSONAL<br />
USE. IHAVE TO MAKE THAT CLEAR BECAUSE WE<br />
ARE SPENDING A LOT OF PUBLIC MONEY ON THE<br />
RESTORATION. MANY PEOPLE AND ORGANISATIONS HAVE BEEN0<br />
ASSOCIATED WITH THIS SPLENDID PROJECT. THE<br />
FIRM OF STOCKS AND HOLDINGS HAVE COLLABORATED<br />
WITH LIVERPOOL CITY COUNCIL IN THE<br />
RESTORATION. STOCKS AND HOLDINGS HAVE GIVEN<br />
$ 10,000 AND CARRIED OUT RESTORATION WORK TO<br />
THE VALUE OF $ 3,000. My GOVERNMENT HAS MADE<br />
GRANTS TOTALLING $ 35,000 THROUGH THE NATIONAL<br />
ESTATE PROGRAM. THE FINAL COST OF THE0<br />
RESTORATION WILL BE ABOUT $ 110,000.<br />
6. WE HAVE BEEN SLOW TO GRASP THE IMPORTANCE OF<br />
OUR HISTORIC HOUSES AND BUILDINGS. ALL TOO FEW<br />
OF THEM HAVE BEEN PRESERVED OR RESTORED,<br />
IAM DELIGHTED THAT ONE OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL<br />
AND FAMOUS OF OUR OLD BUILDINGS IS BEING<br />
PRESERVED HERE IN LIVERPOOL, A PART OF SYDNEY<br />
WHICH FOR ALL ITS HISTORIC ASSOCIATIONS Is<br />
LACKING IN EXAMPLES OF HISTORIC ARCHITECTURED s / 3 </p>
<p>7,<br />
89 -3-1<br />
IAM HOPEFUL THAT FURTHER FUNDS WILL BE X/' j) Q "<br />
AVAILABLE FROM THE NATIONAL ESTATE PROGRAPI.<br />
THE COUNCIL'S REQUEST FOR A FURTHER GRANT<br />
' OF $ 15,000 HAS 8EEN REFERRED TO THE INTERIM<br />
COMMITTEE OF THE NATIONAL ESTATE, WHO WILL<br />
SHORTLY BE FORMULATING THEIR RECOMMENDATIONS<br />
TO MR UREN ON TH E 1975/ 76 FINANCIAL<br />
ASSISTANCE PROGR AM. AN ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE<br />
NEXT NATIONAL ESTATE PROGRAM IS NOT EXPECTED<br />
BEFORE NOVEMBER,. AFTER THE APPROPRIATION<br />
BILLS HAVE BEEN PASSED AND PROGRAMS APPROVED<br />
BY STATE AND AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT MINISTERS.<br />
My GOVERNMENT FROM THE BEGINNING HAS GIVEN<br />
STAUNCH SUPPORV-TO THE PRESERVATION OF THE<br />
NATIONAL ESTATE -THE UNIQUE AND BEAUTIFUL<br />
THINGS, THE THINGS WORTH KEEPING IN OUR<br />
COUNTRY IN OUR FIRST FULL FINANCIAL YEAR,<br />
1973-74, NO FEWER THAN 101 NATIONAL ESTATE<br />
PROJECTS WERE APPROVED AT A COST OF $ 2.5 MILLION.<br />
LAST FINANCIAL YEAR WE PROVIDED $ 8 MILLION<br />
FOR NATIONAL ESTATE PROJECTS, ( I17576 ( hAd 3e7 a// a cqe<br />
ILOOK FORWARD TO THE DAY WHEN THE RESTORATION OF<br />
THIS BUILDING IS COMPLETED AND IT CAN BE SEEN<br />
IN ALL ITS FORMER DETAIL AND PAST GLORY. IT<br />
WILL DRAW VISITORS To LIVERPOOL FROM ALL OVER<br />
AUSTRALIA. IT WILL BE A FITTING REMINDER OF<br />
ONE OF OUR GREAT PIONEERS AND THE SUPERB<br />
ARCHITECTURE OF A PAST AGE.-I CONGRATULATE<br />
ALL THOSE WHO HAVE MADE POSSIBLE THIS PROJECT. </p>
