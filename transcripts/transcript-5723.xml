FOR MEDIA 18 December 1981<br />
UNICEF<br />
The attached is the text of a letter the Prime Minister today<br />
sent to the Representative of the United Nations Children's<br />
Fund in Australia, Mr Hugo Idoyaga. 21 </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER CANSEERRA<br />
Dear Mr Idoyaga,<br />
I would like to pay tribute to the work of the<br />
United Nations Children's Fund on the occasion of<br />
its 35th Anniversary<br />
UNICEF, since its inception in 1946 has done valuable,<br />
indeed vital work, initially in providing emergency<br />
assistanc&amp; to children in war-ravaged countries and<br />
subsequently in responding to the continuing struqqlec<br />
of the vast majority of the world' s children simply to<br />
survive and to enjoy a basic social and physical<br />
environment which might allow them decent opportunities<br />
for continued well-being.<br />
Australians have every reason to be proud of their<br />
country's association with the establishment of<br />
UNICEF and its contributions through the years.<br />
When UNICEF came into being Australia was one of the<br />
first four countries to pledge its support and was<br />
represented on UNICEF's first Executive Board, and is<br />
currently a member. The Australian Government's<br />
contribution to UNICEF for 1982 will be a $ 3.5 million,<br />
one of the ten highest on a per capi'ta basis, amnongj<br />
the 157 member countries of the United Nations.<br />
In my opinion, UNICEF is special in two ways it<br />
puts its emphasis on children as the hope of the future,<br />
and it serves as a means through which governments and<br />
private people around the world can work together to<br />
deal with the problems of children in need. </p>
<p>The Australian Government gives full support to<br />
UNICEF in its mission of responding to immediate<br />
emergencies, to long-term deprivation and to acting<br />
for the improvement of the conditions and opportunities<br />
of children all over the world.<br />
Again I extend to UNICEF my own congratulations on the<br />
occasion of its 35th Anniversary and wish it well in<br />
its important mission ahead. Yours sincerely,<br />
N<br />
' I K;<br />
( Malcolm " Fraser)<br />
Mr Hugo Idoyaga,<br />
Representative, United Nations Children's Fund,<br />
