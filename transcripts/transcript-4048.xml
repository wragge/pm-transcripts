difficult economic problems with emphasis on the vital importance of<br />
overcoming inflation, restoring confidence and achieving sound and<br />
sustained recovery in activity and employment.<br />
New Tax Sharing Arrangements<br />
on the question of income tax sharing the States gave their preliminary<br />
reactions to the general principles which the Commonwealth had suggested<br />
might be followed and the discussion clarified the issues which are involved<br />
in a most useful way. The supplementary statement issued at the cor~ tencement<br />
of the Conference briefly outlined the proposed general principles.*<br />
All States have agreed to participate in work to develop the matter further.<br />
The States will set down in more detail their views on the matters raised<br />
and tc-, fz . iiirata . te cxor-idezati&amp; ov of the proposed tarrangements<br />
at a subsequent Conference, a working group of Commonwealth and State Treasury<br />
off icers will be established to examine certain technical issues.<br />
Assistance for Local Government<br />
The Commonwealth's proposals for a new system of assistance for local<br />
government to commence in 1976-77 were welcomed by the.-Premiers. </p>
<p>In essence, under the new system local government wgill have access<br />
to funds on a continuing and guaranteed basis.<br />
The funds are intended for two purposes a per capita grant to all<br />
local government bodies, and an equalisation or topping up grant.<br />
The Premiers have agreed to write setting out any comments they might<br />
have on questions of detai-l which were raised.<br />
They will be consulting local government in the process of formulating<br />
their comments.<br />
The Grants Commission will continue its current * inquiries into certain<br />
aspects of local government finances. The Commission will advise<br />
on the distribution of funds as between the States for local government<br />
in i976-77.<br />
Under the proposed new arrangements. it will not now be recommending<br />
on amounts of assistance for individual councils, but the information<br />
it is assembling will be used in the future arrangements.<br />
The amount of assistanco to be provided to icoal government in 1976-77<br />
under the proposed new arrangements will be determined by the Commonwealth<br />
as early as practicable in the light of general budgetary considerations.<br />
Legislation to amend the Grants Commission Act to accord with these<br />
ar. Langaments will be introduced in the coming Parliamentary session.<br />
Road Grants<br />
It was agreed that road grants of S64 million provided in the Commonwealth's<br />
1975-76 budget as a supplement to the amount payable under existing<br />
legislation will be paid by the Commonwealth to the States, but that<br />
million of this amount will be held over over for payment in<br />
1976-77.<br />
The Commonwealth expressed the strong view that a high proportion of<br />
these additional grants should be directed to local governments<br />
which have been hard hit by the cut back in the road programme inherited </p>
<p>from the previous government.<br />
Wages The Premiers agreed there would be advantages in regular meetings of<br />
Commonwealth and State Wage Pixing Tribunals which werecognised<br />
will be a matter for them to determine. They also agreed that the<br />
