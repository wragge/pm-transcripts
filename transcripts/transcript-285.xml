W AUSTRALIA CLUB DINNER<br />
LONDON. ON MONDAY. MARCH 20. 1961<br />
Speech by the Prime Minister, the Rt. Hon. R. G. Menzies<br />
Sir, My Lords and Gentlemen,<br />
I think I ought to begin by saying how grateful I am<br />
to His Royal Highness the . Duke ( of Gloucester) for having once<br />
more presided over one of these dinners. He and I were recalling<br />
earlier this evening an occasion in this very hotel, in one of<br />
those less civilized days when one wore a stiff shirt and white<br />
tie; and I arrived with a temperature of 1030, which I am told<br />
is a high temperature. I got up and read the speech and<br />
couldn't see the audience at all they were like floating<br />
clouds -and at the end of it I didn't know what I had said, nor,<br />
I imagine, did anybody alse. Because of this very high<br />
temperature I turpied to His Royal Highness, who is a former<br />
Governor-General of Australia and a stout-hearted friend of<br />
Australia, and if I may say so, Sir, always a kind friend of<br />
mine; I turned to him and said, " Sir, I am terribly sorry.<br />
Could you understand what I was saying, because I couldn't."<br />
And his reply deserves to be immortalized, He said,~ " I think,<br />
on the whole, it is the best speech I have ever heai'd you make.'<br />
And then, of course to add to my embarrassment, we<br />
have here Lord Slim, another lPormer Governor-General of<br />
Australia a very remarkable man who, since he c6ased to be<br />
Governor-aeneral has always treated me with thegreatest<br />
affability. All the time I was supposed to be his chief<br />
constitutional advisor you knew, going around saying, " If you<br />
don't mind, Sir, I don't think you should have made that<br />
speech; let me write the next one." To which he would always<br />
reply, " Let it be a little literate for once." AUl this time<br />
I was terrified of him, but since he gave up being Governor-<br />
General-, we have become very good friends. Therefore, I am<br />
permitted to say to you that I think he is a very great man and<br />
that Australia had a great honour in having him. I won't dwell<br />
on the fact that he knows my mind and knows the feelings of the<br />
people of Australia. But then Sir, I look to my left and see this calm,<br />
benign, non-contentious character Lord Hailsham. He was<br />
involved the other day in a slight fracas in the House of<br />
Lords. We don't want -to dwell on it in any way, but somebody<br />
said to me " What do you think about that?" " Well" l, I said,<br />
" You can't understand that unless you understand Hailsham,<br />
because when he found himself, willy-nilly, cast into the House<br />
of Lords, he protested very violently. I don't go as far as to<br />
say that he reflected on his father's choice or anything of that<br />
kind, but he certainly did make do you remember? a little<br />
bit of an uproar: " Why should I go into the House of Lords? I<br />
would sooner ring bells elsewhere." But, having been beaten down<br />
on that subject, and having resigned himself to being a member<br />
of the House of Lords God bless it he then decided that he<br />
would try and approximate the House of Lords to the House of<br />
Commons; or, you might say, to the House of Representatives in<br />
Australia. And so he chose to debate accordingly. You alT<br />
know what I mean, or if you don't, you are not good Australiaihs,<br />
And then there is this wretched creature, the Maste. 1<br />
of the Rolls. Until tonight, I have always admired him<br />
enormously. I have even put myself to the trouble of reading<br />
some of his judgments. I have even persuaded myself occasion.'.* w,<br />
as a former lawyer, that they were right which I think arguefa<br />
high degree of Ch~ istian charity, on my part, This croatuir-.<br />
What does he do? He brings in cricket, It is, of course, an </p>
<p>admirable thing to bring in; we could have done with a bit of<br />
it in the last week. But having brought it in, he makes a<br />
glancing reference to Old Trafford.<br />
Now if somebody wants to he is at perfect liberty to<br />
talk about Old Trafford because, so far as I can remember, there<br />
never has been a test match played at Old Trafford for donkey's<br />
years. Everybody got worked up and everybody got excited the<br />
newspaper critics, you know, these geniuses, those rather underbred<br />
geniuses who write about all these things they had it all<br />
worked out for Old Trafford. But for three consecutive tours,<br />
not a ball was bowled at Old Trafford because it turns out that<br />
at Old Trafford they specialise in rain. Anyhow, he drags in<br />
Old Trafford as if he was a sort of what is the word? an;<br />
archaeologist even an anthropologist, I would think, He drags<br />
that in, and then he says this I think I wrote down the<br />
ipsissima verba, " Winnie ille N1i" you must attend to your<br />
pronunciation: " And then we went to a wool sale."'<br />
This, of course, fascinated rme enormously because<br />
tonight I'm wasting my time on you and tomorrow I'm going to<br />
Leeds where I am to open, I'm told though ho I haven't been<br />
told a wool research institute, Anid I'm going to be given<br />
one of my many unearned degrees. I think Lord Slim 1 ' s one$<br />
They thought it rather odd that he should al one have an unedrned<br />
degree so they joined me in, you see glad to have a second<br />
and then I make a speech to the Lord Mayor. It is much harder<br />
to make a speech to a Lord Mayor than to have a speech made by a<br />
Lord Mayor to you. But that is going to happen. And so this<br />
wretched character Evershed, he said, " And so we went to a.<br />
wool sale." ' If I had made a remark so fatuous to him as counsel,<br />
he would have looked at me and said, " W~ ell, Mr. Menzies" or<br />
" Mr. Minges" to people who are well trained " what do you mean<br />
by a wool sale?" It was just like the occasion in my own<br />
humble jurisdiction in Victoria, which Sir Edmund Herring will<br />
remember very well, when I ventured to say to a celebrated<br />
equity judge -and he is one anyway I think so none of the<br />
common lawyer -we won't go into that but I ventured to say to<br />
the celebrated equity judge, " Well, Sir, the difference you are<br />
putting to me is merely thie difference between tweedlo-dum and<br />
tweedle-dee." 1 Well like all politicians I thought this not<br />
highly original but singularly brilliant the difference between<br />
twoedle-dum and dweedle-deo. And the old boy put the tips of<br />
his fingers together and said, " Mr. Menzies, I hope you don't<br />
think you are solving the problum!" I say this, Master, only to<br />
indicate that although we have overcome all social distinctions,<br />
these distinctions between equity and the law are still<br />
prevalent. And, as a common lawyer, I think this is not without<br />
merit. I say no more than that.<br />
But the Master of the Rolls, towards the end of his<br />
speech, made some reference to the Commonwealth. I think it<br />
might be regarded as a little odd if I did not say something<br />
myself about the events of the last week or ten days. Because<br />
there is one odd thing about conferences nowadays: Every morning<br />
you open your ten newspapers and you read ten different versions,<br />
each particularly authoritative, about what went on before.,' I<br />
have never known what happened at this conference until I have<br />
read the newspapers; and I have read some of the most astonishing<br />
things. But what I want to say to you tonight I say as a<br />
man who won't be accused of not being a Commonwealth man. I<br />
have, through the whole of ray public life, been a devoted<br />
servant of the Crown. That doesn't go for eve.-. yb~ ody in the<br />
Commonwealth the old Commonwealth and the new Commonwealth.<br />
I think therefore one should say a little about some of the<br />
events of the last ton days and some of the dangers, as I see<br />
them of the results of the last ten days. Because I believe </p>
<p>that last week we had some of the most dramatic events in<br />
Commonwealth history and if we don't think they are dramatic,<br />
then vie have lost all interest in the Commonwealth and what<br />
happens to it. Because after all what happened last week was<br />
that a foundation member of the British Commonwealth, to wit<br />
South Africa, was in effect told to leave. I use those words.<br />
I will justify them in due course. And that country, South<br />
Africa, has left. Now this is not something to be tossed off<br />
lightly as a morG incident; this is a foundation member of the<br />
Commonwealth, a country which became a member of the Commonwealth<br />
after bitter wars, after bitter disputes,. and after a<br />
superb act of statesmanship by the United Kingdom which created<br />
the Union. Now Sir, we have had in the newspapers, speculation,<br />
propaganda, and if you will allow me to say so, not a little<br />
: Usehood, about the events of the last ten days. Therefore, I<br />
want to say something about the events as I saw them and as, in<br />
an extremely obscure capacity, I have had some part in it.* Sir,<br />
all this argument has arisen about something'which is called<br />
" apartheid", which means, as I understand it, separate<br />
development. Separate development., has been rightly or wrongly<br />
the policy of the Government of South Africa. And : rvdeed I would<br />
like to remind you it has been the policy of South P. 1rica since<br />
it was first erected by J. C. Smuts. I can't cimplain about<br />
Field Marshal Smuts because he was the most distinguished of all<br />
members of the British Commonwealth outside this country. I<br />
delivered the first Smuts lecture last year at Cambridge and in<br />
the course of preparing myself for it I even road Smuts' book on<br />
Holism which very few of you have tried to do, He was a<br />
philosopher, a statesman, a scholar, and he found himself<br />
Confronted by the choice which every Power finds itself<br />
confronted by the choice between having a policy of integration<br />
when you have people of different races, or a policy of separate<br />
development. Nov that, I would have thought, in my innoceihce,<br />
a problem of statesmanship. In the old colonial days it was<br />
putting on one side the Africans apartheid. You had the<br />
European colonising Power doing this and that; running the<br />
country and building people up, all very properly; a process<br />
which has led to the creation of nation after nation in this<br />
world; or you have some other view. nd so South Africa'<br />
decided it would have this policy of separate development. Now<br />
for reasons I am going to give to you I don't agree with this<br />
policy. But the great problem that we have to confront is<br />
whether, because you disagree with the policy of a country a<br />
member of the Commonwealth you push it out ofthe Commonwealth.<br />
And those are two questions that ought to be kept completely<br />
distinct one from the other. The whole problem is not one of<br />
moralizing, or being superior, or passionate; the whole problem<br />
is one of statesmanship. Now I have said to you that I don't myself agree with<br />
this. I am talking to you tonight and I say this particularly<br />
to my Australian fellow-countrymen I am the only Prime<br />
Minister who, until this conference, has never publicly offered<br />
an opinion on South African policy. And I stand by that. I<br />
think that was right, because I am a believer in the Commonwealth,<br />
I ami a believer in the members of the Commonwealth<br />
meeting together, not arguing with each other not lecturing<br />
each other, not sitting in Judgment on each other, but scekinj<br />
to discover between themselves what points of agreement they<br />
have, how far they may assemble their moral force in the woriK<br />
And, therefore, in my Parliarient, and I daresay not much iDmy<br />
advantage, I said " No. South Africa runs its own affairs; we<br />
run our own affairs; Canada runs its own affairs. W4ho are we<br />
to be sitting here in judgment one on the other? I don't have<br />
any observations to make on what the other man does." But a].<br />
this is ' old hat' now because everybody has a go at it. </p>
<p>I would not be saying anything about it tonight if it<br />
wore not for the fact that in this conference Dr. Verwoera, thle<br />
Prime Minister of South Africa, himself acce'. cx t o the idea that<br />
we ought to have a chance between us all to thrash this matter<br />
out. So I pause here, and say this about Dr. Verwoerd: he has<br />
been accused sometimes by people who speak, I understand, in<br />
the name of dhrsistianity I am a simple Presbyterian myself.-<br />
he has been accused of something that almost approximates to the<br />
bitterness of murder. I want to tell you that I, in fact,<br />
formed the impression never having met him before that h<br />
was a man of iUmmense integrity and of great courtesy. He came<br />
out of this conference, personally, whatever you might think of<br />
his policy, with the very high respect of the people who sat<br />
with him. La I say that at the very beginning because I don't<br />
want to have it thought that I am one of those people who want<br />
to lecture him as if he were a wicked man with no moral sense.<br />
I believe he is a man of utter integrity. I don't agree with<br />
his policy. But I am not bound to your policy. If I diwoe<br />
with your policy I don't mean to tell yet', you arc a man of no<br />
character. And I hope you won't be calleu upon to tell me ' that<br />
. I am a man of no character because you don't agree with my;<br />
poli cy. The whole genius of the British Commonwea*;' and by<br />
Jove,_ I believe in the British Commonwealth with a L~ ith in my<br />
guts -the whole genius of it has been that we are tolerant, we<br />
agree to disagree, we seek to understand we look for points of<br />
agreement, but we don't stand up and lecture each other in the<br />
face of the world; and never until this year, have we sat in<br />
Judgment on each other. Those are things wart h remembering.<br />
Here is a problem of statbsmanship. Now I, never having before<br />
offered a public word about SDuth African policy, am now called<br />
on to do so and not by my wish. I am old-fashioned enough to<br />
believe in tolerance, and in living and letting live, and in the<br />
virtues of Christian faith, hope and charity. I believe in<br />
these things but if thcis is out of date and I am to be<br />
misunderstool about those matters. thsn I simply say this to you:<br />
here is a time of passion and rhetoric; of broad, sweeping<br />
statements, the kind of things you expect to have in the United<br />
Nations Assembly but not in the Bi~ itish Cotmionwealth. The-se<br />
are the times, -and therefore I say to myself: " Must I say<br />
something?" I believe I must, and I say it. I don't moralize<br />
about South African policy because I tftink moralizing is a<br />
pretty cheap thing. All I say is that I ' Ion't think it will work,<br />
You see this is the pragmatic British approach and I<br />
am happy to say that I am completely British. I don't want to<br />
be offensive to the Master of the Rolls, but I believe I am in<br />
the tradition of the British common law and this involves<br />
pragmatic JudL,; ents will it work? &amp; nA it won't work. Nothing<br />
was more impressive to all of us at this conference than the way<br />
in which Dr. Verwoerd, with obvious honesty, with great courtesy,<br />
with great lucidity, explained his policy. He told us what his<br />
Government was doing for the Bantu: for the Bantu in their<br />
territories, for the Bantu in the ordinary provinces. He told<br />
us of the amount of money they were ! p ending on education and<br />
health which I may say is quite an example to all the other<br />
countries in Africa. And he believes that all this will work<br />
out vory nicely. Well, and I speak with great reluctance, I<br />
don't think it will, because I believe in this day and<br />
generation that the more his policy succeeds, the more he br.. L<br />
the Bantu up in terms of health and living standards and<br />
education, the more intolerable will they find it to be secor.-<br />
class citizens. N-ow this is purely, I say purely, a pragmatiapproach.<br />
It is not sentimental, it is practical. And I sa..<br />
to him time after time in private " I know you believe this is<br />
right, but I believe that the more it succeeds in the first </p>
<p>0<br />
instance, the more it will fail in the long run. Because the<br />
more you succeed in building up the Bantus, the more you succeed<br />
in giving them proper standards educational standards and<br />
universities the more you will develop that proper pride in<br />
people which will make them say, ' I am not to be pushed to one<br />
side', And if it goes on that way then you may find that the<br />
ultimate conflict will be bloody and devastating." Now that<br />
sii. ly is my own view, and I offer it for what it is worth, and<br />
he is familiar with my views on this matter. But if he goes<br />
back to his own country and says " I am unmoved by that; this is<br />
our policy", then I want to tell you I stand for the right of<br />
any Commonwealth country to run its affairs in its own way.<br />
May I remind you Sir I don't want to be too long<br />
but may I remind you that In May of last year, which is less<br />
than a year ago, we had a Prime Minist( ursl conference on this<br />
matter; well not on this matter, but on a number of matters,<br />
but this was the first matter to come up. And after we had had<br />
a discussion we issued a communique. In this great organisation<br />
of ours we do not produce a communique unless it is unanimous.<br />
And this communique said: " The Commonwealth is an association of<br />
independent, sovereign States, each responsible for its own<br />
policy." Now these are, I venture to say Sir fine wiords and<br />
true words. And I emphasise that because, wlthou. bo.&amp;, t<br />
ing, if somebody in a Prime Ministers' conference Li to t: l1<br />
me what the policies of Australia ought to be, I would tell them<br />
to go and jump in the Serpentine. I know mine is an unfashionable<br />
idea, but there is much to be learned from the history of<br />
the past. The Charter of the United Nations and that is a body<br />
with which I don't invariably agree the Charter of the United<br />
Nations concedes-the point. It says: " Nothing contained in the<br />
present Charter shall authorize the United Nations to intervene<br />
in matters which are essentially within the domestic jurisdiction<br />
of any State". And Sir if I may add to that last year,<br />
after this conference in which these matters had been informally<br />
discussed, I went off, dreadfully daring, to Cambridge to give<br />
the first Smuts Memorial Lecture. It was a piece of irony you<br />
know, as I look back on it, because it was Smuts who devisod the<br />
policy of apartheid. He wouldn't have done it in the same way<br />
no, of course not. But he was a great man, a great figure in<br />
the history of the Commonwealth. Would you mind if I quoted from<br />
this Smuts lecture? You could of course buy it for a few<br />
shillings from the Cambridge University Press, but I know how<br />
impoverished you are and I won't dwell on that. But I really<br />
think this is something I oug.-ht to put to you:<br />
" During the recent tragic episodes in South Africabecause<br />
remember that this declaration I have just been quoting<br />
to you was made after ' Sharpeville, afe Langa, afe those<br />
events which are now celebrated by gentlemen with sashes across<br />
their cLests " During the recent tra!, ic episodes in South 1frica<br />
there were not wanting suggestions that South Africa<br />
should be expelled presumably by majority vote from<br />
the Commonwealth. Any such suggestion, in my opinion<br />
misconceived the nature of our association. We do not dc,..<br />
with the domestic political policies of any one of us, i:<br />
we know that political policies come or go with governinG&gt;.<br />
and that we are not concerned with , overnmients and their<br />
policies so much as wo are with nations and their people!--<br />
If we ever thought of expelling a member nation of the<br />
Commonwealth it would, I hope, be because we believed th" 7<br />
in the general interests of the Commonwealth that nation<br />
a nation was not fit to be our associate. </p>
<p>" The Prime Ministers' Conference would break up in<br />
disorder and the now Cormmonwealth would disintegrate if we<br />
affected to discuss and decide what we thought to be the<br />
proper measure of democracy in our various couhtries;<br />
whether particular groups should or should not have the<br />
vote; whether oppositions should be respected; whether a<br />
Parliament should control the Executive. On all such<br />
matters ' autonorious' or ' independent' nations must have the<br />
right to manage their own affairs in their own way.<br />
" We are not a court. We are brothers in a special<br />
international family."<br />
Now let ne emphasise this every Government, every<br />
member of the Commonwealth, has achieved self-governmaent, a<br />
right of complete independence. Do I want to go around and to<br />
say to any one of them, " This is how you ought to govern yourself?"<br />
Of course not. That is too stupid for words. You will<br />
have a high degree of authoritarian government in one country.<br />
You will have an advanced stage of parliamentary government in<br />
another. But when you look back on these things and you<br />
remember from first to last, from the Balfour Declaration onwards,<br />
we emphasise that we are autonomous governrent-niaters<br />
of our own fate, masters of our own problems. Don"-<br />
it is a monstrous thing for us to be sitting in jud.: o&gt;<br />
another? I wouldn't have said a word about South African pcLicy,<br />
which I think is doomed to disaster, except that I am the only<br />
man yet among the Prime Ministers who hasn't said something<br />
about it. And it has all been exposed to the public eye and<br />
therefore no one can be misrepresented. But really, basically,<br />
I am a great believer in autonomy meaning autonomy, and selfgovernment<br />
meaning self-government. And if we are to reach a<br />
state of affairs in which, instead of meeting to discover points<br />
of agreement that we might have struggling to understand each<br />
other's problems, every now and then finding out there is some<br />
matter on which we can jointly achieve some results, forward<br />
some good cause we are not to do that but are to adopt the new<br />
rule that when we meet somebody is on trial and we analyse their<br />
differences, then, next time it may be Australia.<br />
How do I know? We have things in our policy which are<br />
our policy and our business but with which somebody may disagree.<br />
I wouldnit tolerate having these things discussed by other<br />
people. I wouldn't tolerate being lectured by other people on<br />
what we ought to do. But alas, when emotional judgment comes in<br />
and there are all sorts of banners being borne in the sky,<br />
people can be misled into misunderstanding what it is all about.<br />
Today it is the fashion to talk about racialism. It is still<br />
the fashion to talk about colonialism so long as you don't<br />
talk about Communist colonialism, which is the greatest and the<br />
most aggressive colonialism in the world. But who talks about<br />
the rule of Parliament? Who talks about the rule of law? Who<br />
talks about an uncontrolled press? Who talksaboutnoimprisonment<br />
without trial? I could very simply, if I am allowed to stay in<br />
office long enough, have a word or two to say about these things.<br />
If the drill is that in the Cormonwealth, which was a communion<br />
of friends who didn't order each other about but met to discuss<br />
and as far as they could, agree; if this is to be changed so<br />
that we are sitting in judgment, so that we are a species of<br />
courts, so that we have accused, and charges, and verdictsi t-<br />
I am bound to tell you with all that inherent courtesy which<br />
characterises me, I will have something to say about that. } I<br />
by tk: time I have said it, and by the time the answers have.<br />
been made there won't be any Commonwealth because we will al.<br />
have expelled each other.<br />
Sir, I think this is really a most unhappy event an-</p>
<p>the last thing I want to say to you is this: don't fall into the<br />
error, which many people are falling into of thinking that the<br />
Commonwealth this our most glorious con~ ribution to civilized<br />
life in the modern world is a sub-division of the United<br />
Nations; don't begin to think of it as if it consisted-of<br />
resolutions and amendments and lobbying and votes,~ I r. x-Isist this.<br />
This has nothing to do with the United Nations. I Q. ni ind if<br />
the representatives of ninety-nine nations in New Vo.. 1 go on<br />
making speeches lasting two and a half hours each, andJ keep going<br />
into committee, and doing all these things to amuse .! eople.<br />
Forget about that. This is highly experimental. It may produce<br />
some good results. But what hurts me is this: thatthis great<br />
Commonwealth is being dragged into this area of thought which has<br />
no relation to it.<br />
In 1935, 1, for the first time, attended a moeeting of<br />
Commonwealth Prime Ministers. It wasn't called the Ccm; J-1.; alth<br />
then, it was called the Imporial Conference and the thX.' L iiMe<br />
Minister of Australia, my late friend and leader Mr. Lyons, was<br />
ill. He asked me to attend for him. That was twontys. x: years ago<br />
and, man and boy since then, I have had a lot of exrnrionce of<br />
these things-. Nothing will ever persuade me that u<br />
identify the exquisite intimate personal relations<br />
Commonwealth with the debating society that goes on \ w .1W : c<br />
God bless the debating society in New York. The Isv~<br />
burgeoning out your Royal Highness from the old all~. ance zo<br />
the-Throne, burgeoning out from the old Crown Commonwealth through<br />
these various processes which I don't resist or resent, so that<br />
you have republics, so that you have countries all of whom have<br />
had old associations with us. I look here at my friend Yousuf<br />
from Pakistan. You can't argue about India. They have all. had<br />
the most wonderful relations with the old British Raj. True,<br />
the allegiance to the Throne, both dear to my heart and to the<br />
heart of so many of you, is no longer the sole condition. But at<br />
any rate we have had a special family relationship with the Queen<br />
as the Head of the Commonwealth, the Queen as our Sovereigu Lady.<br />
If anybody wants us to do something which converts the Commonwealth<br />
with all its warmth and its intimacy, its capacity for<br />
hostility within friendship, which is the great thing about any<br />
family relationship into a forum where we are to sit in judgment<br />
on each other, then all I can say is with great devotion to Her<br />
Majesty it is a sorry day for the Commonwealth.<br />
Why can't we disagree with the South African policy<br />
without pushing South Africa out and believe me it was pushed<br />
out. If Verwoerd hadn't gone when he did, I would have been<br />
surprised. Harold Macmillan, the most distinguished Prime<br />
Minister of this country with his colleagues, and with myself,<br />
worked like horses to develop a communique which would expose the<br />
criticisms of other members of the Commonwealth and the answer of<br />
the Prime Minister of South Africa and, having exposed them, would<br />
then make it possible for South Africa to remain within the<br />
Commonwealth as a republic as every other republic has. When<br />
finally Mr. Macmillan came in and said A" Dr. Verwoerd agrees", I<br />
was delighted. I thought, " This is it' in my innocence I<br />
thought " This is it we will now have ihe criticism fairly<br />
stated, the answer fairly stated... and South Africa rem~ ains in"..<br />
I say this as I have read some awful rubbish in the newspapers<br />
not for the first time I've read some awful rubbish to the<br />
effect that Mr. Macmillan pushed them out. This is monstrous<br />
man worked harder than he did. No man worked harder thanDl<br />
Sandys with him, to produce what you might call a formula und..<br />
which the argum~ nt this way was stated, and the argument that<br />
was stated. But I must tell you in view of all this propagai<br />
that goes on that while I was saying to myself in my simple,<br />
colonial fashion, " Well, I think this fixes it," one, two, thi-</p>
<p>4 0 8.<br />
four, five people got up and made it completely clear that they<br />
wouldn't have this, that they didn't want South Africa in, and<br />
that every convenient opportunity, or inconvenient opportunity,<br />
would be taken to attack her.<br />
Well I'm not Dr. Verwoerd and I'm not the apostle of<br />
apartheid though I have my own immigration policy and I'm<br />
bound to say that in hfs plac,, 1 would have loft certainly not<br />
later than he did. So don't lot us have humbug. There is an<br />
awful lot of humbug in the world and, on the whole, I think that<br />
humbug is one of the more serious offences in the world. So don't<br />
let us have it. The faczt is that in all these circumstances South<br />
Africa is out. And what I am saying to you so many of wi-om are<br />
Australians like myself is, " Don't let us Jump on this latest<br />
band-waggon. Let us think of this Commonrealth of ours. What<br />
does it mean in tolerance, in understandinig, in points of<br />
contact, and to us who are Australians, in a superb allegiance to<br />
the Throne?" What does it mean? If we think it means nothing then<br />
it doesn't matter; let it all go to the United Nations. But if<br />
we think it means something, then I beg of all of you to look back<br />
on these events, not with hilarity for I feel no hilarity about<br />
them but to look back on them saying, " Did we go wrong? Has<br />
what has happened strengthened the Commonwealth?" And the<br />
answers to these questions will depend on whether you think our<br />
marvellous association depends upon tolerance, kindness, and<br />
understanding and the long view; or upon the popular passion for<br />
denunciation. I don't need to tell you that I don't feel good<br />
about this. I apologise for having inflicted my views on you.<br />
But since my earliest days in politics I have had a great A sion<br />
of what the Commonwealth should stand for. I hate to think that<br />
it is blurred. </p>
