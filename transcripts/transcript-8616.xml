TR-ANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MIN1STER* THE HON P J KFATING MP,<br />
INTERVIEW WITH KEITH CONLAN, RADIO SAN, ADELAIDE,<br />
TO AIR 10 AUGUST 1992<br />
E OE PROOF COPY<br />
KC: Prime Minister, thanks very much for your time.<br />
PM: Good Keith.<br />
KC: I guess there are only two things that matter in a sense at the moment for all of us<br />
-Ih and the economy, and the recovery. But first could I just pass by some of the<br />
topics of the day, so to speak. We've all been troubled as I'm sure you have, by the<br />
news from Yujoslavia, the holocaust as it is now being called. Is there a role for<br />
Australia? Do we have a position as the United Nations?<br />
PM: We've had an immediate role in the peace keeping force and opening up the airport<br />
in Sarajevo to essential goods and medical supplies, and we've had people<br />
Involved In that. That service I think Is coming to an end, either has come to an<br />
cnd over the last day or two or will be in the next day. I think we regarded it as<br />
largely an European matter, wc thought that European forces would make the<br />
difference there, but they haven't to date unfortunately. But I'm not certain<br />
whether any diplomatic solution is capable of being achieved or weather another<br />
course of action will be sought, but military action is being proposed by some<br />
people and resisted by others.<br />
KC: Do we have a position on that?<br />
PM: No, not at this stage. We're not being asked to get Involved in any such thing. To<br />
see, I think, from our point of view is to sec what approaches are made to us.<br />
We've played I think a good citizen's role in the thing to date, but it's not in our<br />
area of influence, it's not In our sphere.<br />
KC: Well, back to local matters, you've been at the ALP Convention privatisation<br />
means Sagasco in South Australia at the moment, it mcans internal disruption,<br />
cries of traitor over tradition, industrial embarrasment perhaps in the future for </p>
<p>TEL: 10. Aug. 92 18: 27 No. 023 P. 02/<br />

John Bannon. It means Qantas to you on this weekend, does the Qantas<br />
privatisation mean potentially the same sort of problems for you?<br />
PM: I don't think so, I think that people are getting much smarter about all these things.<br />
I mean Qantas is a company which is debt laden and it doesn't have enough equity,<br />
it's been left to trade outside of Australia, not inside Australia. ' This Government is<br />
the first Government ever to actually give it rights within Australia by letting it<br />
acquire Australian Airlines. We can't recapitalise it, it would cost too much<br />
money off the Budget to do so and we're not, I don't think, getting the sort of<br />
management culture Into the thing that it deserves. I think there's got to be a<br />
distinction in the minds of people, including people in the Labor Party, about the<br />
value of an instit ution for its institutional value itself as distinct from Its value as a<br />
government entity. The important this is are we building a better Institution.<br />
Institutions are very hard to create In a country like Australia and when we lose<br />
institutions, for instance in the last decade or so th; eBank of Adelaide disappeared,<br />
we've seen the Elders Pastoral Company almost fold, I mean they are both sort of<br />
Adelaide based institutions. All too often Australian institutions evaporate and go.<br />
What we're trying to do hcre is to take one and build a new one. I had the<br />
privilcge of doing so with the Commonwealth Bank. T'he Commonwealth Bank is<br />
now the largest domestic bank, it was largely an Institution that flew on one wing,<br />
it flew on its big deposit base in NSW, it didn't have the big deposit base In<br />
Victoria. We've now acquired the State Bank in Victoria and sold down 30 per<br />
cent of the stock. Now this was resistcd in the first instance, but it's now worth<br />
150 per cent, 70 per cent of it is worth 150 per cent of what wc started with, we've<br />
created something biggcr and better, we've created a new institution, a better bank.<br />
In the same way this will be true of Qantas. Owning Australian Airlines, giving it<br />
the rights to fly domestically and to make those links to its ongoing carriage to<br />
international services will make Qantas a company that it could never have been.<br />
And the other thing is, I think a lot of people have got a very romantic view of<br />
Qantas. It's got about forty odd aircraft, companies like British Airways have got<br />
400. It's a relatively small carrier but we can make it a successful one, a<br />
reasonable carr ier and a successful one for Australia, Australasia. But it needs<br />
money, it needs capital and I think It needs some private ownership.<br />
KC: ' Prime Minister, the John Bannon Government is looking to the NFP as an entity<br />
which will rise from the swamps at Gillman, it will rise in a lot of other places too<br />
it hopes as a national body. Is it dead in the water nationally as Ian McLachlan<br />
says?<br />
PM: No, I made it clear that we were supporting it by nominating it for funding in the<br />
, one Nation' package, to give it that national support.<br />
KC-But is that tided up or was that really just a little bit of better cities diverted off into<br />
Gillman? </p>
<p>T1EL0:. Aug. 92 18: 27 No. 023 P. 03/(<br />

PM: No, it wasn't. The fact is had we chosen to make purely a South Austraian matter<br />
we wouldn't have so nominated It. Now there is all sorts of things that will cross<br />
the trail of the development ovcr time of the NFP, but I think it Is a very good<br />
opportunity for South Australia and it's one of the best sites in the country. I don't<br />
know a site like this in any capital city with this proximity which Is capable of<br />
being developed. So we've played our role we provided the funds to get the<br />
basic developments started so that there Is an infrastructure there of which the<br />
Government of South Australia can use with private investors developed further.<br />
KC: Finally before we got on to some of the very big ongoing Issues, the Olympics.<br />
John Major's one to bat for Manchester, why not Paul Keating going to bat for<br />
Sydney in 2000?<br />
PM: Well I've just had more pressing things here to do. In the weeks the Olympic<br />
have been on rve been able to put together fortunately, with the help of some of<br />
my coleagues in the States, a ncw National Training Authority, a national<br />
vocational education system to sit up there beside universities for ever, so to speak,<br />
a revolutionary route and branch change to our education system. Those things are<br />
on the go and to leave them and go to the Olympics was not really a possibility for<br />
me. But I did support NSW, we gave NSW $ 5 million to support the bid, and<br />
better $ 5 million now than $ 5 million later, and I think we have at this stage kept<br />
our options open. I'm told by those who wcrc there that they think that if there was<br />
a poll taken now we'd be in front, that is Sydney would be in front, but it's another<br />
year to go so a lot of water will go under the bridge. So I don't think too much will<br />
be lost in me not being there and I don't know at any rate whether the International<br />
Committee is going to be persuaded by Prime Ministers whoever they are.<br />
KC: Prime Minister, to one of the big on going issues the health issue. I'm not going<br />
to ask you if you're going to raise the -Medicare levy because you won't tell me, but<br />
in South Australia now we have less than half the people we used to have on<br />
private medical benefits and they are flooding the hospital system, we do have a<br />
crisis. What's the equitablc way out of this? Is Dr Hewson right that we ought to<br />
give some sort of tax relief to those who look after themselves?<br />
PM: No, 1 think if you take on the Hewson approach which is to say remember Dr<br />
Hewson went to the Australian Medical Association one Sunday about eight<br />
weeks ago and said you csttecommo~ n e. Now that was a direct way of<br />
saying to the doctors you can charge what you tle, you can add to the national<br />
health bill as you sec fit and the rest of us will pay to cover ourselves. We either<br />
pay directly or we'll pay indirectly through Insurance. This Is not a way of holding<br />
down the national cost of health, this is what happened in the United States. The<br />
United Statcs health care is now so expensive that if you're taken acutely sick to a<br />
hospital, if you don't have that blue cross card in your pocket they turn you back.<br />
They just won't deal with you, they will not support you, they will not care for<br />
you. Now I would hope wc never have that in Australia, that the System we have<br />
gives people access to medical protection, that is consultation with doctors and<br />
TEL: </p>
<p>TEL: 10. Aug. 92 18: 27 No. 023 P. 04/<br />
4<br />
access to hospitals regardless of income. And the Medicare levy which you Asked<br />
me about is for a husband and wife and a couple of kids, I forget exactly the<br />
threshold where the levy starts, but I think it's about $ 24,000, you don't pay any<br />
levy under that, tUnder the scheme proposed by Dr Hcwson Is people would pay a<br />
set price for pfivate insurance regardless of Income, so the low Income family, the<br />
low income person pays as much as the high income person. There is no capacity<br />
to pay augmentative, you pay flat and basically you're paying to keep the Incomes<br />
of doctors how doctors think It should be. Now on the other hand the Gove rnment<br />
has kept the national health cost, the cost of medicine at a very low proportion of<br />
national GDP by largely making certain that over use, abuse, fraud, but most<br />
importantly the fces charged by doctors are reasonable. And so It's on that basis<br />
that the system hangs together, that people can have that affordability and in terms<br />
of public hospitals I think Statcs have got to decide that they should more<br />
adequately and effectively stream people through the hospitals without accruing<br />
waiting lists, only to be answered with the hollow charge well if you're all<br />
privately insured you'll be ok. They wouldn't be ok, they'd just pay much more.<br />
KCC: What about public hospital patients being fed Into private hospitals where the beds<br />
are waiting?<br />
PM: I'm not sure whether they're waiting, but there's no reason why the States cant<br />
accommodate public patients in private hospitals if they so choose.<br />
KC; There's not philosophical divide for you?<br />
PM: In the end, what does a private patient have, for instance in a public hospital? You<br />
can have a private patient sitting in a room, multiple person room, the idea once<br />
that you had your own private room, as a private patient and doctor of choice.<br />
Essentially the way the medical profession operates the system these days, if you<br />
go to a specialist and that specialist is accredited for services the public hospital<br />
and you admit yourself. The greatcr possibility Is in the majority of cases that<br />
specialist will serve you. So people are going needlccsly insuring themselves and<br />
because fewer arc Insuring themselves it means that those who are left privately<br />
insured and in some cases sicker people arc paying a bigger premium because the<br />
other healthier people have left the system. Now this concerns us, it concerns the<br />
Federal Government and we'll be in signing new agreements with the States later<br />
this year, that is renovating the Medicare agreement, to try and deal with this<br />
problem. We will try and deal with it and talk to the States sensibly about it, but<br />
we don't want to throw the baby out with the bath water, say well look there's a<br />
problem in the efficiency of streaming people through public hospitals, therefore<br />
what we'll do is we'll take every Australian person and family and charge them<br />
through the nose for health protection so that in the end what we're really doing..<br />
I mean this is what really gets me about l-cwson, he's so savage on unions, he<br />
wants to cut young peoplc's pay to $ 3 an hour, he wants to cut workers to three<br />
quarters of their incomes, he thinks unions are an abomination except the doctors </p>
<p>* TEL: 10. Rug. 92 18: 27 No. 023<br />
union which he goes to on a Sunday and hands over to them the check book of a<br />
nation and says write your own check.<br />
KC: When It comes to those agreements later in the year, will be there some relief for<br />
what is now a public hospital crisis here. We are talking about going backwards<br />
by several per cent, closing hundreds of beds. Is there relief In sight?<br />
PM: Keith, the Commonwealth is prepared to talk sensibly to the States about<br />
improving that position, but it Is going to be in negotiation and if I were to say to<br />
you look, this is what we are prepared to do, the States would simply put that<br />
straight in their pockets and come and ask us for something else. T1hey've got to be<br />
in this too, it's no point in them simply weighing In the Commonwealth for<br />
inadequacies in the management of the health system across the country, rm<br />
talking about South Australia, but across the country. So there is a role I belief for<br />
private hospitals, there is also a clcar role for the public hospital system and I think<br />
the thing that worries people most and particularly the aged, that is for elctive<br />
surgeryy which is necessary like hip replacements for instance.,<br />
KC: It's really a crime to call it elective isn't it?<br />
PM: T7hat's right. It's necessary surgery, it may not be acute, immediate, but it still is<br />
necessary and those things I think we would like to try and deal with.<br />
KC: Prime Minister to the economy and ' One Nation': we know about now the pluses<br />
for tax payers, we know about the tax deductions to come, we know about big<br />
national projects, some more announced on the weekend in Adelaide, the Indian<br />
Pacific project and so on. That's all based, is it not on money coming Into the<br />
Federal coffers which would be as a result of healthy growth in the economy over<br />
the next three years. You've had to back off some of those projections, so what has<br />
to go on the give away side?<br />
PM: Keith, in the 1980s when growth was strong and privatc investment was stronger<br />
than the nation could stand and the demand for goods and labour was higher than<br />
we could afford and we were satisfying a lot of it by imports. When we didn't<br />
need a public stimulus, this Government turned the Commonwealth's budget into a<br />
surplus. In other words we withdrew the fiscal stimulus from Commonwealth<br />
spending and we've put about $ 20 billion away In a surpluses, In the savings<br />
account of the country. We're now using them for when we nccd to use them.<br />
KC: Didn't we pay off the foreign dcbt with that? Isn't that what we said we were<br />
doing at the time?<br />
PM: No, not the foreign debt, we just rcduced the Commonwealth domestic debt. But<br />
we've got it now down to v'ery low levels, in fact if we were to produce surpluses<br />
for three more years we will have no Commonwealth debt whatsoever. Tuat is, no<br />
bond would have been outstanding from the turn of the century onwards. What </p>
<p>T1EL0: . Aug. 92 18: 27 No. 023 P. 06/<br />
6<br />
we're saying now Is with the private economy slow with private Investment down<br />
this Is the time for public Investment, but not only In a stimulatory sense, but In a<br />
micro-economic sense as well. It just matters to Australia to have a standard<br />
gauge railway from Perth to Brisbane via Adelaide and Melbourne, I mean as a<br />
trading company it simply should be therc for large containers or heavy items that<br />
need to be carried around the country or even light ones which can be carried well.<br />
There is a case for developing an electricity grid, it's not going to be done by a<br />
private company, the railway is not going to be re-established by a private<br />
company. This notion that Dr Hewson has with the that it's all private Initiative,<br />
private reward all we will.<br />
KC: But these arc arguments for maintaining the Infrastructure side and so on.<br />
PM; It's not just maintaining them but doing them when private investment is down.<br />
KC: Ycs, and maintaining these projects within your ' One Nation' package. But now<br />
that the growth figures aren't there, thc critics say you could drive a truck through<br />
it because you won't have thc income to do It.<br />
PM: No, what we're saying is thc deficit will be larger than we envisaged in February.<br />
KC: And that's dangerous because the overseas markets look at it and say..<br />
PM: I don't think its dangerous because in this sense, I mean it's there naturally, the<br />
Federal Budget's a shock absorber, it's a cushion, it's a buffer at thc end of the<br />
station that when the economy is languishing and you want that extra stimulus, it<br />
cushions things by lower reccipts, higher unemploymecnt benefits, higher outlays,<br />
higher spending. In other words in cushions the shock. That's what it should be<br />
there for, it should be there doing. Now we'll carry a bit more debt,<br />
Commnonwcalth debt than we envisaged in February, but again, our debt to GDP,<br />
to the Commonwealth is very low by world standards.<br />
ICC: Some want you to go further, some including traditional Labor voters who phone<br />
say we don't want tax deductions now, this country nceds so much of what<br />
you're talking about that we'll forgo those. What's your response to that?<br />
PM: think you've got to find a balance betwecn those things. Two weeks ago we set<br />
up this National Training Authority. As I said earlier that will revolutionise the<br />
education system of this country. We will develop a system which we'll set beside<br />
the univcrsities for a root and branch branch change to the education system. It<br />
will cost us some money, but it is money well spent and It Is the role for<br />
Govenrncent. This is what find curious about the Librals. Dr Hewson Is saying<br />
' I want to run the Government so the Government can do less, so the Govcrnment<br />
can withdraw from the problem'and will hide behind this sort of ideology, if you<br />
throw enough money to the wealthy and to the companies they'll all get out thcre<br />
and do things and in the doing of it pull the rest of us along. It won't happen,<br />

companies wouldn't rebuild the rail highways of Australia, they won't build the<br />
road highways, they won't refurbish the ports, they won't build a national training<br />
authority, it will only be done by Government. So there Is a role for Government.<br />
What I think the Labor has done this decade, it's done two things. It's for the first<br />
time and the great irony of all this it's taken a Labor Government to get Australia<br />
an open market economy, but it's done it with a social heart, it's done It with a<br />
heart, theres a social policy grafted on to it: access to health protection, access to<br />
education, aged care, child care, occupational superannuation. We've taken the<br />
place along together, forwards together and the notion that therm's no role for<br />
Government, that you drop out and if there isn't a quid in It for somebody then it<br />
shouldn't be done, will mean that most of the social and micro-economic things<br />
we talk about, rail, road, air just wouldn't be done. I don't believe we can be the<br />
sort of country we need to be, that is an efficient trading country with an educated<br />
workforce, without that public investment and all those things.<br />
KC: Prme Minister, you're talking about the heart around the country, that's the<br />
difference you're telling us between you and the Hewson alternative, but to the<br />
mature adult full time workers or the ones who would like to be who are out of<br />
work at thc moment, some 60-70,000 of them in South Australia, wheres the heart<br />
for them? Where's the heart for the kids who go through your smart country Idea,<br />
who go through the training authority only to come out the other end to find that<br />
the job that is offered, if there is one, is part time, is casual, Is not Career orientated.<br />
What's in it for them?<br />
PM: This may be true in some cases Keith right now, but if you look at the 1980s it was<br />
not true, the kids who qualify themselves in the 1980s found themselves jobs. I<br />
think a lot of Australians look the unemployment is sad, it's to be regretted, that<br />
we haven't been able to keep the growth in employment going. We are sharing<br />
this position with just about every other comparable country, Britain, United<br />
States, Canada, Japan, Germany, France, they are all in the same position, all<br />
growing less than two per cent for the current year as we've been. We kept most of<br />
the gains of the 1980N, people I think just focus on the fact that in 1983 when this<br />
Government came to office the work force was six million In size, today It Is 7.6<br />
million, it's over twenty Five per cent bigger. We've largely kept those jobs, gross<br />
domestic product the size of the economy In 1983 was 200 billion. Today it is<br />
over 400 billion. T7here has been a huge impetus to growth and wealth In the<br />
1980s. What's happencd is that the growth for the last 18 months has stopped. We<br />
haven't been topping It up, we haven't been taking up the ncw entrants to the<br />
workforce. By and large we haven't lost most of what we created in the 1980s and<br />
we've kept all the social policy up there as well, the childcare, the Medicare and<br />
the child support agency and home and community care for the aged, 25 per cent<br />
AWE for the pension, occupational super, all those things are there industry<br />
policy, award restructuring all those great advances have been theme, what's<br />
stopped is employment g. owth. But once we gct that started and in the last two<br />
months we've seen 86,000 job growth and certainly unemployment has risen in the<br />
period because more people are looking for work, but at least we are starting to see </p>
<p>% b sje.. S. Pointaa.<br />
TEL: 10. Aug. 92 18: 27 No. 023' P. 08.'<br />
that employment come throush now and if it comes through more strongly as I<br />
believe it will over the course of this financial year then Australian will be going<br />
back on the road to being aspin, a more fully emiployed society, but one where<br />
we're not letting anybody fall behind. We're not taking the view that Dr Hewson's<br />
saying, if you're on unemployment benefits after nine months, sorry you're out,<br />
down to the St Vincent de Paul or Salvation Army. We're not taking that view, we<br />
believe that a whole country has got to move together and stay together.<br />
KC: Prime Minister, when It finally comes to the campaign, we are on about the image<br />
it's you versus the Doctor and it's going to be that way until you the name the date<br />
until you come to the election. Is really the best chance of this Federal Labor<br />
Government that the Liberal Opposition will once agan shoot itself in the foot and<br />
that's why you're there now really, they shot themselves last time. Is your only<br />
hope that Dr Hewson won't hold the troops together, won't hold his vision<br />
together,<br />
PM: No, I think these days and it has been for many years now that people basically<br />
vote on the parties. I don't think matter all that much in the way in the end the<br />
national tally is taken. I think people see the parties for what they institutionally<br />
stand for. Dr l-ewson has basically one policy. It's got two prongs. One is to<br />
increase prices, higher prices through a consumption tax and the other is lower<br />
wages, abolishing awards, cutting rates of pay. I don't think that making people<br />
poorer, making them pay more is a policy. It's not going to change education,<br />
health, you just mentioned hospitals, not going to change that, not going to change<br />
enterprises, not going, to make thc place more efficient, it's going to produce<br />
rancour, division, disheartening and for what? To guarantee that those who've<br />
already got a buck get more and those who haven' t or who are unemployed gct put<br />
to the back of the queue.<br />
KC Or is he offering the short term pain that would see us go into the same ranks as<br />
New Zealand which is now on very high, if not at the top of the competitive list<br />
according to some of the world forums?<br />
PM: Let's just make this clear. We had more growth in Australia in the 198N than<br />
there is total GDP in the New Zealand economy. When I was Treasurer we<br />
provided more growth than there is total product in their economy. They have<br />
about the same number of people in work today they had in 1983, we have 25 per<br />
cent more people in work today than 1983. Forget New Zealand as a comparison.<br />
It doesn't matter to me New Zealand. If Dr Hewson wants to run over there fine,<br />
but let everyone understand what happened over there. A generation was left<br />
behind, this didn't happen In Australia.<br />
KC: Prime Minister thanks for your time today.<br />
PM: Thank you very much. </p>
