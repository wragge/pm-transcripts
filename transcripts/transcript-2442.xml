FOR PRESS-: PMI No. 71/ 1971<br />
DEA7H OF SIR FREDERICK SHEDDEN<br />
Statement by-the Prime Minister, Mr. William McMahon<br />
It is with deep regret that I learnt of the death of Sir<br />
Frederick Shedden. Sir Frederick had a long and distinguished career in the<br />
Commonwealth Public Service and was an eminent figure in defence<br />
administration. He was Secretary of the Defence Department from 1937 to<br />
1956, spanning the critical years of World War 11 and the unsettled period<br />
which followed. From 1.939 to 1946 he was Secretary of War Cabinet and from<br />
1943 to 1945 Secretary of the Advisory War Council.<br />
Earlier in his career Sir Frederick Shedden was attached to<br />
the British Cabinet Office and the Committee of Imperial Defence where<br />
he was closely associated with Lord Hankey.<br />
Sir Frederick participated in many important overseas<br />
missions with the Prime Minister and Minister for Defence.<br />
On the basis of experience during World War II, Sir Frederick<br />
Shedden had developed arrangements in the Defence Department which had<br />
laid the foundations for closer co-ordination and direction of defence policy<br />
and administration. The Prime Minister said that Sir Frederick Shedden would be long<br />
remembered for his outstanding service to Australia.<br />
On behalf of the Government I extend sympathy to his widow.<br />
