MACQUARIE~ NETWORK WTEEKLY BROADCASTS<br />
BY THE PRI-T MINISTER, TIF RT. HON. WILLIAM<br />
McMATION, CH. 12 ARIL, 1.972<br />
Good Evening: Maccuarie Network has made available one night each<br />
week so that I can speak to the A11ustralian people on matters of<br />
great national interest. I welcome the opportunity they have<br />
given to me to speak to you.<br />
Naturally enough on an occasion like this, I think it<br />
would be desirable if I spokr about the mini-Budget we introduced<br />
into the House of Rex~ resentatives last night.<br />
You will probably remember that when we introduced<br />
the last Budget in the middle of last year, we made the statement<br />
that if we felt the economy needed an additional stimulus, or that<br />
a change in policy was necessary, w~ e would do so immediately.<br />
Since then, we have confirmed the view that it is<br />
better to make our policy decisions known as scon as we could, rather<br />
than to wait for another Budget or to wait until an election<br />
policy speech was made.<br />
So throughout the year in accordaince with this<br />
decision, we have gradually given increased stimuli to the economy.<br />
We started off with monetary Do] Lcy early in the year. We then<br />
had the Premiers' Conference %,, here we made large sums of money<br />
available for works and housing and for other purposes.<br />
We made sumns of money available for education,<br />
particularly at the independent schools, and for buildings in<br />
the public schools. And now we have made several very important<br />
decisions that intimately affect you.<br />
The first of these decisions relates to income tax.<br />
During the Budget last year we increased income tax by 2 per<br />
cent. We have now decided that this part of the tax will be<br />
takpn off, and it will mean that you will have an extra $ 117 million<br />
over the year in your own pockets rather than paving to the<br />
Income Tax Commissioner. We have also decided to increase Pensions and<br />
repatriation benefits. In the case of pensions, the base rate<br />
will be ipcreased by $ 1 per week, -and in the case of married<br />
couples, by 75 cents per week. And we have also decided that in<br />
the case of people with incomes of their own, that we will<br />
liberalise the tapered means test so that they can still receive<br />
a part pension and have a total income, in the case of a single<br />
individual of $ 6.50, and in the case of a married couple. of_ 4&amp; l<br />
per week. Now there were three reasons why we carried out these<br />
changes. </p>
<p>= 2-<br />
The first onc3 was so that we could increase<br />
purchasing power in the corrnunity and give people a greater<br />
opportunity to purchase in the retail stores.<br />
The second was undoubtedly humanitarian,<br />
in order to provide assistance to those whom we felt were in the<br />
greatest need, and to whom we could give the greatest benefit.<br />
Third, we wanted to increase confidence in the<br />
community, because with increased confidence we feel that demand<br />
would increase, and as demand increases, the economy will grow,<br />
unemployment will reduce and we will have the kind of society and<br />
the kind of economy that we want and I know that you people want<br />
too. There is one other change that we will make.<br />
We have decided to carry out a review of the total taxation<br />
structure of the Cormmonwealth. This will cover not only your<br />
personal taxation, but will also cover indirect and corporation<br />
taxation as well. Uip till the moment we have been carrying out an<br />
enquiry witkin Treasury itself. But we ca~ me to the conclusion<br />
that the people of this country would not be satisfied if we relied<br />
wholly upon Treasury advice. We thought it-would be much better,<br />
therefore, if we had an open enquiry by a judge, or by a group of<br />
individuals who could carry out a public examination and then could<br />
make their recommendations to the Government. This course we will<br />
follow. we hope it will be for your benefit.<br />
So I want to sum up in this way. We have made<br />
these changes because we wanted demand to increase, and particularly<br />
consumption expenditure to improve, and wffe wanted retail sales<br />
to improve as well. We had the humanitarian purpose of helping<br />
those people in the greatest need, and we also wanted to assist the<br />
growing confidence in the community because we wanted to improve<br />
and to help in the obiectives the Government has set of full<br />
employment and a continually growing economy.<br />
I am confident that what we are doing is right,<br />
and if you will join me in this confidence, I can assure you<br />
that we will have the kind of economy the ' Government wants and<br />
the kind of economy I am sure you want as vell. </p>
