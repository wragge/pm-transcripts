. I. ME MINISTER'S SPEECH AT PUBLIC MEETING, PORT AUGUSTA<br />
2 NOVEMBER 1975<br />
Mr Wallis, ladies and gentlemen. I was asked about<br />
six months ago to come to Port Augusta today because it's<br />
the Diamond Jubilee at the Diocese of Willochra. And this<br />
was a somewhat unexpected invitation, so novel in fact, that<br />
I penned it in six months ago in my diary. And in the*<br />
meantime-some other events have occurred, so I thought that<br />
yesterday I would travel to Port Augusta via Alice Springs<br />
and Whyalla. And I'm happy to have an audience of Labor<br />
supporters in this electorate of Grey just before I go in<br />
about twenty minutes time to the other celebration.<br />
The last time I was here was in April and I was<br />
passing through on the way to Tarcoola to inaugurate the<br />
biggest railway project in Australia since the transcontinental<br />
was started in Port Augusta at the outbreak of the First World<br />
War. The biggest railway project in Australia for over<br />
* sixty years. And shortly after that, you'll remember, that<br />
we tried to put through the South Australian Parliament the<br />
agreement to hand over the financial and management responsibility<br />
to South Australia's non-metropolitan railways to the Australian<br />
Government. And the Legislative Council of South Australia<br />
* blocked it. And you had an election in South Australia.<br />
And there were two big issues in that election. One was the<br />
excellence of this financial deal that the Dunstan Government<br />
had made with my Government to hand over the non-metropolitan<br />
railways to the Australian Government which would mean an<br />
immense financial advantage to the State Government; and<br />
also an immense improvement in railway services, in South<br />
Australia and through South-Australia, frorai all the other States<br />
and up to the NorthernTerritory. That was the first issue.<br />
And the other issue was the obstruction by an Upper House against<br />
the policies of an elected government. And that's the thing<br />
which is happening in the Australian Parliament now.<br />
And I'm satisfied that we are going to win this issue<br />
in the Australian Parliament throughout Australia, the same way<br />
as Don Dunstan won on this issue last July in South Australia.<br />
The simple fact is that governments, whether they're<br />
the Federal Government or the* State Governments are made or<br />
unmade in the Lower House. If a Party or Parties have a<br />
majority in the Lower House, the House of Representatives or the<br />
House of Assembly, then that's the Government. You can't be<br />
the Government of Australia or South Australia or of any of the<br />
States, unless you have a majority in the Lower House. And<br />
* twice now, in December 1972 and in May last year, the Australian<br />
Labor Party secured a comfortable majority in the House of<br />
Representatives. And on each occasion, in December 1972 and<br />
again in May 1974, the election was about who was-* to be the<br />
Government of Australia for the next three years. Before half<br />
that time-was up, in April last year, the Senate threatened to<br />
block Supply, to say: " Well, look we won't give the Government<br />
the authority to spend the taxes which are being collected.<br />
We'll bring the business of Government to a standstill." / 2 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
Now, at that time I said., " Right, we'll have a double dissolution;<br />
there are six Bills which the Senate has held up, which it's<br />
rejected twice, and we can settle the issue of Medibank, we<br />
can settle the issue of equal electorates, electorates of the<br />
same number of electors, we can do that now." And we had a<br />
double dissolution, and we won. We got an overall majority,<br />
a comfortable majority, in the whole * Parliament. And when on<br />
a third occasion the Senate voted against the Medibank Bills<br />
and a third time the Senate voted against the Electoral Bill;<br />
and the third time the Senate voted against the Petroleum and<br />
Minerals Authority Bill, which was designed to give-Australians<br />
the opportunity to develop their own natural resources; when<br />
a third time all those things happened, we had a Joint Sitting.<br />
And at that Joint Sitting we comfortably passed all those<br />
Bills. And never since has the Government been beaten in<br />
any division, and there's scores of divisions which have taken<br />
place in the House of Representatives.<br />
We are clearly entitled to see out our three year<br />
term. We were elected as the Government, and in the House<br />
of Representatives where governments are made or unmade, we<br />
still have a comfortable majority. And the proposition which<br />
is being put by the Liberals and the Country Party is, that<br />
because we haven't got a majority in the Senate, they can<br />
blackmail us, hold us up, hijack us, whenever they wish. But<br />
they haven't got a majority in the Senate either.<br />
Now Governments are never made in the Senate; they<br />
never have been; you can't have a Prime Minister in the Senate;<br />
you can't have a Treasurer in the Senate and the Constitution<br />
says that the Senate can't initiate Money Bills; the Senate<br />
can't amend Money Bills and all. that the Senate can do is to<br />
make a request to the House of Representati. ves to amend the<br />
Money Bills. And the House of Representati~ ves may, if it sees<br />
fit, accept the request or it can reject the request. That's<br />
the sum total of the Senate's powers as laid out in the<br />
Constitution. Let's go back to what happened in May last year, when<br />
there was an election for both Houses. The Labor candidates<br />
for the Senate got 165,000 votes more than the candidates of<br />
all the other Parties represented in the Senate. But because<br />
it's a complicated electoral system and so on, we ended up with<br />
29 out of 60 Senators; and the Liberals and the Country Party<br />
ended up with 29 out of 60 Senators; we got more votes but<br />
they got as many members; but they didn't-get a majority, we<br />
didn't get a majority. And in the Senate if the votes are<br />
equal on any issue then the vote is lost. If there is a motion<br />
for a Bill comes before the Senate and there are as many<br />
people voting against it as for it, then it's lost. It's rejected.<br />
Now after the election an Independent from Tasmania<br />
joined the Liberal Party. And on our side, Senator Murphy<br />
was appointed to the High Court fair enough that there should<br />
be a Labor Attorney-General on the High Court, for the last ten<br />
years there has been a Liberal Attorney-General, Barwick<br />
himself,' it's fair enough that there should be an Attorney-<br />
General from each side on the High Court. And then later<br />
Senator Milliner died, the Labor Senator from Queensland. </p>
<p>-3-<br />
And the New South Wales Government -a Liberal Premier and<br />
the Queensland Government a Country Party Premier appointed<br />
replacements for Murphy and Milliner, who opposed the Labor<br />
Party. The one from Queensland is the worse case Field,<br />
Pat the Rat but still, still the Liberals and the Country<br />
Party haven't got a majority in the Senate.. They have 30, one<br />
of the Independents joined them, they've got 30. That is, even<br />
if they thought they were entitled to-be the government, they<br />
couldn't get the things through the Senate without the support<br />
of the people who don't belong to their Party. And they have<br />
no chance of getting a majority for any proposition they put<br />
up in the House of Representatives.<br />
So you have this situation, that at the moment the<br />
Senate is not the Senate that the people elected in May last<br />
year. There are two Senators who were appointed by anti-<br />
Labor State Governments until there is an election for the<br />
Senate and they belong, they are opponents of the Labor Party.<br />
It's a stacked Senate. It is a tainted Senate. And on the<br />
* basis of this Senate different to what it wa's when there was<br />
last an election in May last year; and different because a<br />
Liberal Premier and a Country rParty Premier. have done the wrong<br />
thing; on this Budget the Liberals and the Country Party<br />
relying on a stacked pack of cards, a tainted Senate, take<br />
* it on themselves to say: we won't allow the Australian<br />
Government to have the authority to spend the taxes which<br />
everybody still has to pay.<br />
Now it has never happened before in Australia's<br />
history. There have been many occasions, particularly since<br />
there was proportional elections for the Senate introduced<br />
in 1949, when the Government hasn't had a majority in the<br />
Senate. There were many occasions when Holt, and Menzies before<br />
him and Gorton after him, didn't have a majority in the Senate.<br />
But nevertheless t-he Senate always passed the Government's<br />
Money Bills. The Senate can't initiate them; it can't<br />
amend them; it can only make a request to amend them and the<br />
House-of Representatives can accept or reject that request.<br />
But never on all the occasions when a Government has not had<br />
a majority in the Senate, has the Senate ever presumed to<br />
reject the Budget. On 139 occasions Money Bills have been<br />
put by the Government to the Senate when the Senate didn't<br />
have a majority of Government Senators. And on every occasion<br />
the Senate has passed those Bills.<br />
Now I want to point out that on this occasion, the<br />
Sienate hasn't yet rejected the Bill; it hasn't voted on it.<br />
What has been passed is a motion to defer. debate; to stall;<br />
* the Senate has gone on strike. Liberals and Country Party<br />
Senators have gone on strike. And on this motion the voting<br />
was 29 to 28, that is, there was one majority. If Senator<br />
Milliner had still been there he would have been voting with<br />
the 28; it would be 29 all. And in those circumstances the<br />
motion to defer debate on the Budget Bills would have been<br />
rejected. There is not a majority against the Budget in the<br />
Senate. And all that Mr Fraser is doing, is keeping his<br />
Senators sufficiently in line to vote for a deferment. Some<br />
of them have said, Senator Bessel of Tasmania said on Four<br />
Corners last weekend that in a vote on the Budget itselft he .4 </p>
<p>-4-<br />
would not vote against the Budget. And he also said, Senator<br />
Bessell on Four Corners last weekend that there were many other<br />
Senators of the same mind. So once there is a vote on the<br />
Budget Bills in the Senate, the Budget Bills will be passed.<br />
And the motion which has been carried, just because Senator<br />
Milliner is dead; the motion was carried as Senator Steele<br />
Hall said " over a dead man's corpse". They say " If there is<br />
going to be an election, we'll pass the Budget". That is,<br />
there is nothing wrong with the Budget according to the Liberal<br />
and. Country Parties.<br />
True enough, Mr Fraser made a few criticisms of the<br />
Budget after it was introduced, a week after it was introduced.<br />
And his criticisms, of course, were shown to be very damaging<br />
to his cause. And one of the things that the Liberals proposed<br />
was that if they got into Government they would go back to the<br />
old system of income taxation where there was Federal income<br />
tax and State income tax as well. And this is the proposal<br />
which would benefit maybe the people of Victoria and in<br />
New South Wales it would be equal fifty-fifty, it would make<br />
no difference but in the four smaller States everybody would<br />
have to pay higher income tax. That's what used to be the<br />
case in Australia before uniform income tax was introduced by<br />
a Labor Government in 1942. It was the case still in Canada,<br />
if you're in the smaller Canadian provinces you pay ' higher<br />
State income tax, provincial income tax, than you do if you're<br />
in the big one, the prosperous one like Ontario and British<br />
Columbia. All the other provinces pay a higher tax. And this<br />
is what Mr Fraser was proposing in his alternate Budget. He<br />
realised that it was very unpopular in the four smaller States,<br />
including yours. So he now says that his Budget proposals are<br />
inoperative. You remember that great phase of President Nixon's<br />
Press Secreatry came out, President Nixon was caught out in<br />
giving a reply which wasn't accurate in Australia if anybody<br />
does that he's sacked but in the United States they said: The<br />
answer was " inoperative". And Mr Fraser at a press conference<br />
on Wednesday week used the same phase: my Budget proposals<br />
are " inoperative*. So there is nothing wrong with the Budget; it is.<br />
just a hijack operation. They say they want an election now.<br />
Now of course, they didn't say in May last year, at the last<br />
election that if they lost they wouldn't accept the verdict; they<br />
didn't say then that they would use any numbers they got in<br />
the Senate to prevent the Government governing for the full three<br />
years for which it was elected. Arnd, of course, back in that<br />
was Billy Snedden was in charge of it that time it's getting<br />
very uncomfortable for me, you know; I'm in the process of<br />
demolishing the fifth Liberal leader: Holt, Gorton, McMahon,<br />
Snedden, Fraser; they're all lasting less time as time goes on.<br />
Watch for the next fascinating instalment, ladies and gentlemen.<br />
But last April., April last year, when I yielded to<br />
this blackmail we had an election which meant that we were<br />
without a national Parliament for three months. The two Houses<br />
were dissolved on the 10th of April. and we had the earliest<br />
election we could; we had the quickest count we could; and<br />
then we assembled the Parliament as quickly as possible. And<br />
we couldn't bring it together until the 9th of July, one day<br />
short of three months after Parliament had been dissolved. </p>
<p>I don't believe that at this time in our battle against inflation<br />
and unemployment, we can afford to have the Australian<br />
Parliament suspended for another three months. We must get<br />
on with the Budget; we must get on with the economic recovery;<br />
we must get people back to work, particularly the school<br />
leavers in the next month or two months. And the Liberals<br />
and the Country Party are deliberately holding the country<br />
to ransom; their strike is designed to promote unemployment<br />
and dissatisfaction. Now we must make it plain to the Australian people who<br />
are the guilty men. Because Mr Fraser when he took over from<br />
Mr Snedden and when he realised that Mr Snedden had been<br />
destroyed by taking the advice of the Country Party Leaders<br />
and the newspaper proprietors, he said, very properly, that he<br />
believed strongly that if a government had been elected it was<br />
entitled to govern for its three year term. And he made an<br />
exception; he said: " unless there are reprehensible.<br />
circumstances." And as the pressure has grown on him from<br />
the Country Party Leaders, as the pressure built from the<br />
newspaper proprietors, he forgot his principles, he was<br />
casting round for some reprehensible circumstance. And he's<br />
never been able to find any at all. Every weekend he gets<br />
more and more desperate in his abuse of me. And the Country<br />
Party Leaders too. -But I've had no associations with CIA<br />
money in Australia, as Anthony has. My wife hasn't received<br />
any $ 16,000 necklaces for launching ships overseas, as<br />
Sinclair's wife did. I haven't got, or my family hasn't got,<br />
superph. 6sphate subsidies as Fraser's has. No income tax troubles<br />
in my family. That is, they've been able to get nothing on me.<br />
And they're getting more and more desperate, these men who<br />
are subsidised by the CIA or overseas ship builders, or the<br />
superphosphate people. They're getting more and more desperate<br />
in their personal abuse of me and the whole of the Labor<br />
Government. They've got nothing on us; there are no<br />
reprehensible circ-, unstances at all. The only reprehensible and<br />
extraordinary circumstance is the fact that for the first time<br />
in 75 years a Senate is stalling on the votes on Money Bills.<br />
They haven't voted against them; they know that they wouldn't<br />
all line up at the barrier to reject the Budget. No Federal<br />
Budget has ever been rejected in the 75 years that we've had<br />
a Federal Parliament. And no Upper House in the world nowthe<br />
House of Lords or Canadian Senate or any of these countries<br />
which still have Upper Houses would ever reject a Budget.<br />
It wouldn't happen anywhere else in the world. We've been<br />
made the laughing stock of all our neighbours and in all the<br />
longer settled. democracies around the world by these<br />
shenanigans of the Liberals.<br />
What is at stake is this: are we ever to have in<br />
Australia, the opportunity of changing a government at the<br />
ballot box and being sure that that government will have the<br />
chance to carry out the policies upon which it was elected?<br />
Because if you accept the situation that the Senate, by rejecting<br />
a Money Bill or even just by stalling a Money Bill can produce<br />
an election for the House of Representatives, then you can have<br />
this situation arising twice a year. Because every October<br />
the Budget is brought up to authorise the expenditure of taxes<br />
and loan funds for the whole of the financial year, from the<br />
1st of July past until the 30th of June f~ llowing. / 6 </p>
