    <content><![CDATA[<p>E&amp;OE...........  </p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, the Prime Minister of Malta and I have had a wonderful discussion.  I said at the beginning of our discussion that the bilateral relationship between our two countries is of a type that you always want to exist between two countries.  It's warm and friendly with no complications.  Australia has the largest Maltese diaspora anywhere in the world and Australian citizens claiming a Maltese heritage probably number in excess of 200,000 and given the size of Malta that is a remarkable human link between our two societies.<br />
Australians, particularly the older generation, will always remember the heroism of the people of Malta during World War II and our close alliances in fighting Nazism and other totalitarian attitudes during World War II.  And, indeed, the association stretching back to the Gallipoli campaign between the Anzacs and Malta is also very deeply embedded in the Australian understanding of the relationship.<br />
We've talked about Malta's negotiations for entry into the EU and discussed the situation in the Middle East.  And can I say that the Prime Minister is very, very welcome in our country.  I know he's caught up with a lot of Australians of Maltese heritage and I';m sure that he's been very, very warmly welcomed.<br />
PRIME MINISTER FENECH-ADAMI:<br />
Thank you.  Well, I';m very grateful to be here on this working visit.  As the Prime Minister has just said we spoke about the relations between our two countries, which I cannot describe but as excellent on all levels, whether it's government-to-government, seeing eye to eye on most international issues, particularly the Commonwealth and, of course, there's this very human relationship which is of more than 200,000 Maltese living in Australia, proud to be Australians but also proud of their Maltese identity.  I've been visiting the Maltese community here and I can say that I have found that the Maltese community are quite a happy lot than Malta and, of course, this is because Australia is such a great country, a country of big opportunities even for my people.<br />
It is, indeed, a pleasure to be here again and no doubt the relationship between our two countries will continue to be consolidated.  We have a number of agreements in force which, every now and then, will need updating and the governments will see to that.  And as regards to the way forward Malta will, I hope, soon become a member of the European Union and I think that gives a new dimension to Malta and I would say also to the relationship between Australia and Malta.  When Malta joins the European Union we'll add to Mediterranean dimension of Europe.  We are at the southern most tip of Europe, right in the centre of the Mediterranean.  And of course Malta being an active member of the Commonwealth we too will add another important dimension to the European Union.  And I can assure you, Prime Minister, that you will have a friendly voice within the European Union when Malta does join.<br />

PRIME MINISTER HOWARD:<br />
We did discuss Zimbabwe.  I reported on where it was, the diplomatic efforts, and pointed out that the eleven Commonwealth countries at the Pacific Islands Forum had all agreed that the present situation in Zimbabwe was most unsatisfactory.  Neither the Prime Minister nor I is particularly optimistic about the likely responsiveness of President Mugabe and clearly we're both unhappy with that and clearly the aspirations many people have of some improvement through dialogue between the Government and the Opposition in Zimbabwe has not been realised.  We're both alarmed at the growing poverty, food shortages and generally arbitrary conduct which is occurring in that country.<br />
JOURNALIST:<br />
[Inaudible]<br />
PRIME MINISTER HOWARD:<br />
Well, I've indicated before that there are some diplomatic moves in process at the present time.  They will take, not a long time but I'd like a little bit more time to go by before I respond to that question.  But I can tell you that Australia is very unhappy and I think most Commonwealth countries are very unhappy with the lack of responsiveness by the Mugabe Government to the Commonwealth's reasonable expectations.  Now, you have to bear in mind that this has been going on for a long time and, in the eyes of many, Zimbabwe was given extra time at the Coolum meeting and the troika was authorised to deal with the matter.  We reacted to the unambiguous evidence from the observer group that the election had been conducted improperly and contained many abuses and clearly there are consequences flowing from that but I don't want to say anymore right at the moment.<br />
JOURNALIST:<br />
[Inaudible]<br />
PRIME MINISTER HOWARD:<br />
Well, are there any other - I mean, perhaps we'll come back to that to be courteous to our guest.<br />
JOURNALIST:<br />
[Inaudible]<br />
PRIME MINISTER HOWARD:<br />
Well, I think what it…a new member of the European Union?  I think, as the Prime Minister expresses, it will give another focus inside the European Union from a country that has especially close relationships.  I mean, if I think of, you know, the linkages, you think of course obviously of, inside the European Union, the very close links we have with Britain and Ireland and with Italy and Greece, being source countries but proportionately, as I said earlier, we have the largest Maltese diaspora than anywhere in the world here in Australia and that does mean that the Australian perspective will be even better understood and I welcome that because we sometimes have our differences with the European Union, as you know.<br />
JOURNALIST:<br />
[Inaudible]<br />
PRIME MINISTER HOWARD:<br />
How does it effect the expansion?  Well, I think it depends very much on the impact of the expansion on the common agricultural policy.  If the expansion brings about some dilution of the common agricultural policy because of the reluctance of countries such as Germany and Britain to fund the equal treatment of the new countries, particularly Poland, under the common agricultural policy - and this really is a crunch issue for the European Union - because if you're going to treat the new entrants on the same basis, which they will naturally expect, understandably, then that will add enormously to the cost of the common agricultural policy.<br />
JOURNALIST:<br />
Was there a similar condition between the two of you on [inaudible]?<br />
PRIME MINISTER FENECH-ADAMI:<br />
Well, we discussed the issue Middle East and the situation isn't [inaudible] over at all, although there seems to be a new ray of light with what happened over the last few days when the Israelis are pulling out of Bethlehem.  I think the solution has to be definitely that Palestine will be recognised as a State on its own and that the security for the two countries that have to live together has to be ensured.  But it's the situation is very ,very, very difficult but I think one mustn't give up hope, of course that area of the world is of very great interest to my country.  So I may say that Malta has had and still has very good relations both with the Israeli Government and the Palestinian authority and we only can say that we hope for the best but it's very difficult to see rapid progress.<br />
PRIME MINISTER HOWARD:<br />
Can I say I agree with the Prime Minister.  Our policy, as you know, has always been of unswerving support for Israel's territorial integrity but, equally, a recognition of the rights of the Palestinians to a homeland and there needs to be security for both.  We're immensely depressed at what has happened over the last 18 months and I remain quite mortified at the failure of anything to come out of the initiative of the former Israeli Prime Minister which I regard as having been very courageous and generous given the history of what's happened.  But I';m ever so slightly encouraged by what is happening right at the moment and we have to remain optimistic.  It's not easy but there does seem to have been some tentative steps taken towards an accommodation and the arrangements surrounding the withdrawal from Bethlehem are moderately encouraging but I don't want to put it any more strongly than that.<br />
JOURNALIST:<br />
[Inaudible]<br />
PRIME MINISTER FENECH-ADAMI:<br />
Well, I think the situation in Iraq is a very difficult one.  No doubt we are all interested in what's happening in Iraq and what they could be up to.  Of course much depends on the right intelligence as to the true position.  I think Iraq has to come to its senses and behave as any decent country has to.  I think the situation has to be re-evaluated as we go along.  I think that probably the point hasn't been reached where preventative action should be taken and that would be extremely worrying if we ever come to that point.<br />
PRIME MINISTER HOWARD:<br />
I don't want to deny you your domestic questions seeing that you've waited so patiently.<br />
JOURNALIST:<br />
[Inaudible]<br />
PRIME MINISTER HOWARD:<br />
Well, I don't have a comment on that.<br />
JOURNALIST:<br />
You don't think there's a double standard at all.<br />
PRIME MINISTER HOWARD:<br />
No, I don't.<br />
JOURNALIST:<br />
[Inaudible] the wheat board says that they've been told by the Iraqi officials…<br />
PRIME MINISTER HOWARD:<br />
Are you talking to me?<br />
JOURNALIST:<br />
Yes.<br />
PRIME MINISTER HOWARD:<br />
This is very much the last one.  I';m a soft touch.<br />
JOURNALIST:<br />
The wheat board says that Iraqi officials say that they'll continue the wheat trade as long as the Australian Government looks back appeasement and diplomacy.  Are you concerned that the Iraqi Government's trying to put you to ransom and say that there'll only be wheat trade if you toe their line?<br />
PRIME MINISTER HOWARD:<br />
I think I'll let that question go through to the wicket keeper.<br />
Thank you.</p>
