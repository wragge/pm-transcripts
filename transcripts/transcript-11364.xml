<p>  Good evening. At the beginning of the year I recommitted the Government</p>
<p>   to tackling unemployment and we are making solid progress. Today I can report</p>
<p>   that the jobless rate has fallen to 6.7 per cent, the lowest in almost 10</p>
<p>   years. 568,000 new jobs have been created since March 1996.</p>
<p>  Unemployment has fallen by about 125,000 and earlier this year we achieved</p>
<p>   the lowest number of unemployed teenagers looking for full-time work than</p>
<p>   at any time in the last 20 years. But I know that unemployment remains too</p>
<p>   high in some rural and regional areas. We must do more and we are.</p>
<p>  A secure job starts with a strong work ethic. That is why we extended Work</p>
<p>   for the Dole earlier this year and achieved 90,000 more new apprenticeships</p>
<p>   than under Labor.</p>
<p>  The number of Job Network sites will increase by 700 to 2,100. Already the</p>
<p>   Job Network is out performing the old CES by about 50 per cent. Now, the</p>
<p>   number of sites outside of the cities will increase from 600 to over 1,100.</p>
<p>   More than half of the 150 locations which will receive a permanent Job Network</p>
<p>   site for the first time will be in rural and regional areas.</p>
<p>  Lower company tax will help keep Australian jobs at home. Lower capital</p>
<p>   gains tax will boost jobs particularly in small business. And exporters</p>
<p>   will be $3.5 billion better off under the new tax system.</p>
<p>  This year we won the battle to retain youth wages saving up to 230,000 jobs</p>
<p>   according to retailers and we'll continue to fight just as hard to exempt</p>
<p>   the new employees of small business from unfair dismissal laws.</p>
