    <content><![CDATA[<p>E&amp;OE....................................................................................................</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, when I became Prime Minister and had the first</p>
<p> opportunity to address a gathering of the Liberal Party organisation</p>
<p> I acknowledged the fact that I was a creature of the Party organisation,</p>
<p> that I had devoted all of my adult life to the service of the Liberal</p>
<p> Party and that what I had achieved in politics was largely due to</p>
<p> the courtesy and the good favour of the Liberal Party. And tonight</p>
<p> in honouring Tony Staley I'm in a sense doing so because not</p>
<p> only does he have great personal qualities but what I'm about</p>
<p> to say about him is in a sense a metaphor for the affection that I</p>
<p> feel for the entire Liberal Party of Australia.</p>
<p>As the video we've just seen demonstrates, Tony is a person possessed</p>
<p> of three very great qualities and characteristics. First and foremost</p>
<p> and indisputably he has immense personal courage. Anybody who survives</p>
<p> what he went through and came back to leave a mark on national political</p>
<p> life is an extraordinary individual who has extraordinary qualities.</p>
<p> The second of his very great qualities is that he's possessed</p>
<p> Â I was about to say and he's demonstrated it beautifully,</p>
<p> he's possessed of a great sense of humour. And you need a sense</p>
<p> of humour to be Federal President of the Liberal Party, and I'll</p>
<p> return to that in a moment. And the third thing is that he's</p>
<p> also possessed of considerable grace and eloquence. And his speeches</p>
<p> are always entertaining. They are always beautifully delivered and</p>
<p> they are always very eloquent. And it is a joy to listen to him as</p>
<p> a speaker.</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, there are sort of categories of Federal Presidents</p>
<p> of the Liberal Party. There are those who reigned as Presidents during</p>
<p> the great years of government - people like Phillip McBride and Jock</p>
<p> Pagan and Bob Cotton, people who presided over those long, unending</p>
<p> summer years between 1949 and 1972. And I think it's fair to</p>
<p> say that John Atwill, as Federal President, presided over a sort of</p>
<p> a return of those summer years during the period of the Fraser Government.</p>
<p> But there are those others who had to do the hard yards in Opposition</p>
<p> Â people like Jim Forbes and Ashley Goldsworthy, who's with</p>
<p> us tonight. And it's pretty joyless being the head of the organisation</p>
<p> when you're in Opposition. And Tony Staley is one of those who</p>
<p> endured three years of Opposition as Federal President before we came</p>
<p> back into office in 1996. And during that time he did a number of</p>
<p> things that other Federal Presidents hadn't done. He controversially</p>
<p> but very decisively intervened in a public fashion in matters relating</p>
<p> to the leadership of the Parliamentary Party. People will debate the</p>
<p> propriety or otherwise of that but who can argue that in the long</p>
<p> run his interventions were courageous, his interventions were moulded</p>
<p> by his desire to serve the Liberal Party and to achieve the best outcome</p>
<p> for the Party. And sometimes you do have to break with tradition and</p>
<p> break with convention. Now, as you know I favour doing that on some</p>
<p> occasions and in relation to some issues and not with others. But</p>
<p> Tony, Tony decided in relation to that particular matter that it was</p>
<p> desirable to break with tradition. And in doing so he demonstrated</p>
<p> an intelligent commitment to the future of the Party and an intelligent</p>
<p> understanding of its histories and the needs of the moment.</p>
<p>It was a great privilege for me to have Tony with me in that suite,</p>
<p> the Australia Suite, appropriately, at the Intercontinental Hotel</p>
<p> on the evening of the 2nd of March 1996. And for him to</p>
<p> be there at the Wentworth Hotel when Janette and I and our three children</p>
<p> came in to formally claim victory after, and in so doing to end 13</p>
<p> very baron and frustrating and unhappy years of being in Opposition,</p>
<p> years to which none of us ever intend to return, do we.</p>
<p>But, ladies and gentlemen, Tony throughout his presidency has been</p>
<p> a great servant of the Liberal Party. He's always put the Party</p>
<p> first. I couldn't have asked for a firmer friend and ally in</p>
<p> the time that I have been Leader of the Federal Parliamentary Party.</p>
<p> We don't always agree on every issue. We will have arguments</p>
<p> and lively debates about particular issues. But as the head of the</p>
<p> organisation he's been a wonder to work with. And he's been</p>
<p> the President for a number of years. He brought us back into government</p>
<p> and that's a huge achievement. He's produced a well oiled</p>
<p> Party machine. He's worked closely with my office. He's</p>
<p> worked closely with the Parliamentary Party. He's worked closely</p>
<p> in a partnership, first with Andrew Robb and more recently with Lynton</p>
<p> Crosby and always through those years with Ron Walker, our indefatigable</p>
<p> Federal Treasurer. And he has been a great servant of our Party. He's</p>
<p> done great things for Australia. He's overcome great difficulties.</p>
<p> And I really am very proud as Prime Minister and as Federal Parliamentary</p>
<p> Leader of the Party to express to you, Tony, our affection, our gratitude,</p>
<p> our thanks, our admiration and, above all, on behalf of the Liberal</p>
<p> family throughout Australia our great debt to you for what you have</p>
<p> done and the way in which you've led the organisation so skillfully</p>
<p> and so effectively over the last six years. Thank you.</p>
<p>[Ends]</p>
