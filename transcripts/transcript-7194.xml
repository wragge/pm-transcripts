A I<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF IUTkRVIEW WITH ALANI JONES, 2UE, SYDNEY<br />
3 JUJLY 1987<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
JONES! 4 A week tomorrow Australians go to the polls. Every<br />
election for a now government is significant s0 its perhaps<br />
cliche ridden to say that this Is one of the most significant<br />
elections in a long time. I've said before that in maq# ways<br />
Australia is in the ambulance chronically ill. This<br />
election isn't about finding blame, but finding answers.<br />
Like every election the polls are playing their part, and<br />
today they suggest that the gap between the leading parties<br />
is closing. In 1990 at this time in the campaign Bill Hayden<br />
was well in front. Malcolma Fraser changed direction, Bill<br />
Hayden ignored the advice of Noville Wran and decided to<br />
tough it out and lost. Remember that Bob Hawks only needs a<br />
handful of votes and about nine seats to go against him and<br />
his government could lose. The real test of the gamble he<br />
took in calling the election is about to be reflected in<br />
eight days time on the political scoreboard. The Prime<br />
NinisLar is my guest this morning. Good morning Prime<br />
Minister. PM: Cood morning Alan.<br />
JONES: Prime Minister, could we just forget for the moment<br />
perhaps if It's possible that you're Bob Hawks, Prime<br />
Minister, and just imagine that you're, say, Bob Adams from<br />
Annandale and there's a bloke out there called Hawks who's<br />
saying I want you to vote for me in this next election, and<br />
he says, well ON, I'll listen to your story. The story he's<br />
told is that when Bob Hawk,-first came to office, the foreign<br />
debt was about $ 29 billion and now Its about $ 105. For the<br />
first time almost every month we've had a current account<br />
deficit for many months. We find that interest rates have<br />
escalated. Inflation In relative terms is worse than it was<br />
when they threw out Malcolm Fraser because they said he was<br />
managing the. show unsuccessfully. What do you think this<br />
bloke at Annandale would say if that record was recited to<br />
him? PH: What that blolce would say that's Alan Jones who is not<br />
putting an Impartial story. He's putting his loaded story<br />
and not putting it accurately.<br />
JONES: Could we take those points through? </p>
<p>PM: Yes, s~ ure, of course we can.<br />
JONES: $ 29 billion to $ 105. Is that accurate?<br />
PM: Can 1 go through them all? The fact is that there has<br />
been an increase in debt and the overwhelming proportion of<br />
that has been in the private sector. The net debt for which<br />
the commorxweatlh is responsible,* the net overseas debt, is<br />
billion. JONF'S: So you're not responsible for-<br />
PH: Woll., if the private sector in fact increases its<br />
borrowings overseas, as they have, that is a decision Alan,<br />
as you realise, that is made on commercial grounds. They<br />
assume that they are going to be able to finance out of the<br />
Investment and service the debt.<br />
JONES: So you've got no control over that?<br />
Pk: You have got no control over the private sector. if<br />
S that's the sort of economy you want when you're going to stop<br />
the private sector borrowing overseas, well then so be it.<br />
What we've had to do, and what we will continue to do is to<br />
exeroise on our own economic front, that is the<br />
coymonwealth, a bringing down and I'd tell that chap out<br />
there that when I came to of fice the deficit that John Howard<br />
left me was $ 10 billion.<br />
JONES: Not really. on tho forward estimates. You know<br />
that. PH: And I know that the chap who was standing on the same<br />
platform last night with you and John Howard, that is John<br />
Stone, came to ne the day after I was elected that John<br />
Stone, not someone else and told me that's what's In<br />
prospect and we've got to do something about it. Nov I would<br />
tell this chap out thero, Alan, that you're talking about, so<br />
that he didn't get a I'd say now look, in the area under<br />
my control, I have brought that down at a rate of descent of<br />
deficit that hasn't been seen before to a point where instead<br />
of having nearly $ 10 billion that John Howard left me, I've<br />
got $ 3.5 in 86--87, it'll be down to S2bin 1987-88. As a<br />
proportion of gross domestic product, I've brought the<br />
deficit down from St to less that It. That's what I'd tell<br />
him and I'd tell him also, that that's a significantly better<br />
thing that's been done In any other western country. And<br />
then on the inflation where I've been given<br />
JONES: Could I comie to the debt? So you can't control,<br />
you're saying because I find this difficult to believe<br />
you're saying to Australia and middle Australia, who Is<br />
terrified about this escalating debt which Is affecting<br />
interest rates fairly dramatically, which is affecting the<br />
prices of houses and all that stuff, that Bob Hawke can only<br />
look after the commonwealth debt and there's nothing else<br />
they can do.<br />
PH: Now wait a minute. Let me finish the answer. I'm<br />
saying that in respect of the area that I can-directly </p>
<p>control, that is, what the commonwealth's net position is in<br />
terms of its oconxiu operation, that's * what I can directly<br />
control. And I'ma telling the story of what I've done, of<br />
thait largo Inherited deficit which I've brought down from St.<br />
51 of the gross domestic product, to less than 1*.<br />
JONES: How?<br />
PM: By the biggest cutting in commonwealth expenditure<br />
that's ever been seen.<br />
JONES: Whon you came to government, commonwealth outlays<br />
were $ 43 611liun.<br />
PM: Why do you need to point the finger Alan?<br />
JONES*. I'm not. I'm asking a question. $ 43<br />
PM: Well that's what you were doing Alan.<br />
JONES: Wcll OX, I don't want to point thut finger at you. I<br />
ivight do that later, but not now. $ 43 baillion were your<br />
total commonwealth outlays. In five years they've doubled to<br />
about $ 86 billion. Now does that mean that you are the<br />
biggest spending government In history?<br />
PH: It means that what we have done is that In 1987-85<br />
commonwealth outlays as a proportion of GDP will be It lover<br />
than they were a few years ago. Next year we will have<br />
brought them, as a proportion you seem to think that as the<br />
economy grows, we have more pensioners, as we inherited, as<br />
we did, more unemployed, we had 250,000 thrown onto the<br />
wiemployuuent scrapheap in the last twelve months of Howard<br />
but as the econotay grows, expenditures contract. I'm telling<br />
you that in 81-86 Alan, the commonwealth outlays as a<br />
propuition of GDP' will be a percentage point lower.<br />
JONES: It took 81 years to get commonwealth outlays to $ 43<br />
b. mllion. You have extended It, you've doubled that. Are you<br />
voaying that you can got around that argument about your being<br />
a big spending government, at a time when this election is<br />
about whether you want lower government expenditure, not as a<br />
percenitage of anything, In real terms?<br />
PH4: Of course you've got to say Its an expenditure of the<br />
total product. if population grows, does that mean less<br />
oxpenditure? if yo'vs got a growing population, and if<br />
you've got an increasingly aged proportion of that<br />
population, then the obligations on government of any<br />
political persuasion are going to be greater. Simply because<br />
of the fact of population growth.<br />
JONES: So we can't cut that expenditure?<br />
I'M: Woll what I'n<br />
JONESt You havo, but can you cut It more?<br />
PM: What we have done in to cut It mure In that last May<br />
statemount than ever had been done before. S4 billion of<br />
expenditure. It wax the greatest expenditure reduction Alan, </p>
<p>in tho last 30 years. Thatt's what's been done.<br />
JONES: Many people are saying you need even more severe<br />
structural. and expenditure adjustment to get us out of the<br />
difficulty we are in, which your own Treasurer has said, and<br />
you said, put us almost on a war footing were your words, and<br />
your Treasurer said like a banana republic. Now can you do<br />
better? PH: if you've finished your advocacy which is all thIs is so<br />
far -I<br />
JONES: No, I'm questioning you.<br />
PH: No you're not. You' ve advocating.<br />
JONKS: No I'm not.<br />
PH: Now donot let's argue with ones another. This<br />
JONES: I'm questioning you arnd it= offering fact.<br />
PH: What I'm suggesting Alan, if you read the transcr~ lpt,<br />
you'll see that this is Alan Jones Advocate. And I'm not<br />
worrying about that. It's what I expected. Just give me a<br />
chance JONES: No, well I mean, you're under contest, you're<br />
standing for Prime Ministership. I'm entitled to question<br />
you. PM: Yure entitled to be an advocate. Lot MG<br />
JONES: No I'm not being an advocate, I'm being a questioner.<br />
PM: I nee alright.<br />
JONES: If that's too difficult for you say so.<br />
PM: No it's not too difficult.<br />
.0 JONES: OR, well lot's answer the guestion.<br />
PM: Well wilil you give we -a chane. Let's come to the<br />
Interest rate aspect of what you're saying. You're<br />
saying that as a result of what we're doing In the area of<br />
expenditure, the people have now got these record interest<br />
ratos. The facts are that the highest interest rate in the<br />
1980s was under John Howard. It peaked at 221. After I came<br />
to office don't furrow your brows, that's a fact. It<br />
peaked at 22t under Howard. Now when I came to office we<br />
broUqht Interest rates down until we got hit by the declining<br />
terms of trade. Now what's happening, as you know, that<br />
Interest rates are coming down markedly, falling, and that the<br />
statement of the banking industry is that they are going to<br />
continue to..<br />
JONES: Some. Some. Wall Street said last week that there<br />
have) to be greatar adjustments. You launched your campaign<br />
here in Sydney, didn't you... </p>
<p>S<br />
PM: You tAaid I could answer.<br />
JON( ES: OK, away you go.<br />
PH: As far as interest rates are concerned, they are<br />
failing. You're saying that the statemeant put to gentlemen<br />
o. ut where~ ver he Isi Alani what'n ' is Flame we were giving<br />
him a picture, he had to be given a picture of rising<br />
interes; t rates. Tho faut is that interest rates are falling.<br />
The fact Is that inflation is falling. The fact is that<br />
government expenditure as a proportion of GDP Is falling. The<br />
fact is that employmuent is rising. The fact is that we've<br />
had double the rate of employment increase In this country<br />
compared to the rest of the world. The fact is that<br />
investmuent Is rising. Those are the facts. Those are not<br />
the putt ing of a piece of propaganda.<br />
J3ONES: I'm not propagandaising, I'm asking you questions.<br />
I Im simply saying that you launched your campaign here in<br />
Sydney. There is a massive housing crisis hero In Sydney and<br />
1. wundor whe~ ther you wliderstand that. Otnuu upon a time you<br />
were identified with the little bloke. Now you've had a tax<br />
ia~ batit, and we're talking about tax policy. That's got<br />
advertised everywhere. No bloke under $ 20,000 gets a cent<br />
out the tax policy changes on July 1. This follow out In<br />
middle Sydney whore you launched your campaign finds himself<br />
PH: Can we deal with that. The fell. ow out there has already<br />
got. his tax cut. You're Implying In your question that what<br />
happens on July I is tho only stage of the tax cut, as you<br />
know, and you should be dispassionate enough to say so.. Its<br />
the second stage of the tax cuts and that bloke that you're<br />
talking about is getting a $ 10 a week tax cut. And if you<br />
want to compare I just wonder whether you'll interrupt<br />
JONES: No I won't interrupt you.<br />
PM: Just look at that.<br />
JONLWS! ON, what do you went no to r&amp; Ad to them"<br />
PH: I want to 0% read the comparison Alan, of<br />
JONES: betwecen Liberal and Labor.<br />
PM: Liberal or Labor -the comxparison of net benefits on<br />
Liberal and Labor family packages.<br />
JONES: Well, let's take a break and I will read it.<br />
Break JONFS: The Primec Minister is suggesting I should have been<br />
more subtle.<br />
PM; Not should have been, I expected you to be.<br />
JONES: You expected me to be more subtle?<br />
PM: Yen. </p>
<p>JONES: Revs Juspt presented n with a statement about the<br />
relative positions between the Liberal tax cut and the Labor<br />
Party tax cut. Now I'm not hore to argue the Liberal<br />
position. If I want to argue that I'll argue with John<br />
Howard about it. I'm hors to talk about your position and I<br />
wonder whether, I'm simply asking you, in this tax cut that's<br />
out on July 1, in the current economic environment. should a<br />
bloko on $ 50,000 because you're criticising John Howard for<br />
offering tax cuts when in fact we should be reducing the<br />
deficit and we should be making sure the debt quotient is<br />
reduced should a bloke on $ 50,000 be getting $ 26 tax<br />
rebate? I mean, who does Bob Hawke represent? You've had<br />
andorsement from the millionaires, from Alan Bond and lorry<br />
Packer. Is your constituency saying, many of the Labor<br />
people, Bob Hawke's lost touch with us.<br />
I'M: No they're not. On the contrary, and all the evidence<br />
shows that they're not. WIX t .1 y understand is that they<br />
were the ones who in 84 weT~ i re tax cuts $ 7.60 skewed<br />
down to the bottom all loa~ ded down to the bottom. That was<br />
the first stage. Then they got the tax cuts last year in<br />
[ December. They got theirs. $ 10 a week, a bloke on average<br />
weekly earnings. Here you're now getting the impact of the<br />
benefit for the people with the rate coming down from 60-49.<br />
That's not just iDomething that's happened out of the clear<br />
blue sky. it's been a matter that's been a part of the<br />
public discussion and with the trade union movement, as well<br />
as business.<br />
JONES: ILookIng after the rich'?<br />
PM: Not looking after if you want to ask the question of<br />
looking after the iich, just let's look at the comparative<br />
package. Will you examine the fact that under the Howard<br />
package it's not until you're at $ 75b0 a week that you get a<br />
net benefit out of the combined tax family package of Howard.<br />
14ot until you get to $ 750 a week. If you want the comparison<br />
between Hlawke and Howard, lot me give it to you. As far as<br />
the Prime IMinister IVr conflrnind. the flot inpint upon as an<br />
Prime M( inixter wan a loiss of $ 5s4 a week, because I taxed that<br />
part of the allowances, which under the Inherited Liberal<br />
position, was untaxed. I got the benefit of coming from<br />
cents to 49. That's more than of fset by the fact that I<br />
taxed the whole package. Under the Howard package, as Prime<br />
Minister, there would be nearly another $ 400 a week going<br />
into his pocket. So If you want to look at the question of<br />
whero you actually help the poor, and where the rich get<br />
hurt, it's again the Howard package which Is loaded in favour<br />
of the rich. Under his package, until you're on $ 750 a week,<br />
you don't get a net benefit oLA'of his package.<br />
JONESi Right, but we can confirm that yesterday, on July I<br />
whenever July 1 was, the bloke under $ 20,000 got nothing. So<br />
in spite of the fact that he might. have got something before,<br />
fie got nothing yesterday.<br />
PM: We]) 11f you want to keep-<br />
JONES: But you're not telling the people that. </p>
<p>PM: I've told themn<br />
JONES: You're telling then now.<br />
PM: I'va told them that they got the second stage ot the<br />
whole tax reform package on July 1. The first stage was in<br />
December and as a result of the total tax package, the bloke<br />
on average earnings in regard to tax is $ 10 a week better<br />
off. What he's got to choose now is a position whether under<br />
Howard he wrants a tax and family package regime where you've<br />
got to wait until you're $ 750 a week before you get a net<br />
benefit, which is the position under Howard, or whether you<br />
got a significantly greater benefit under the labor package.<br />
JONES: Wall let's talk about Bob Hawke.<br />
PM: Sure.<br />
JONES: On the fringe benefits~ tax. Now you've defended this<br />
high and low. I initially didn't believe that you didn't<br />
believe in It, that it was pushed onto you, but you've<br />
defended it.<br />
PM: yov.<br />
JONES: Now the fringe benefits tax being paid by the<br />
employer. Now this means that Bob Hawke goes enjoying<br />
] KIrribilli Houses the Lodge, stationery, office space, cheap<br />
meals, free cars, drivers, VIP aircraft. Most people out<br />
there would say they don't deny the Prime Kinsiter the<br />
entitlement to those benefits. Nonetheless, they're not<br />
being taxed. But out there, if a bloke is giving someone a<br />
motor vehicle to do his business, the employer in paying tax<br />
on that. Now what's happened is, that they have then stopped<br />
giving that benefit, and the motor vehicle lndue-ry as you<br />
know, is in disarray, just as the housing industry.<br />
PK: OX. Nov you've finished that particular part of your<br />
Let's look at the facts rather than the advocacy.<br />
JONES: They're questions Prime Minister and you achieve no<br />
benefit to yourself or anyone else to suggest that I'm an<br />
apologist for anybody. I m simply challenging you and I'm<br />
asking questions that others don't ask and you must allow me<br />
the right to at least Well don't use the work advocacy if<br />
you don't mind. I'm here to question the Prime Minister<br />
and if you don't like the heat of the questioning, really we<br />
shouldn t be here.<br />
PM: I'm quite prepared to stay here.<br />
JONE. S: OX, well if you can't take the heat you should<br />
get out of the kitchen. But it's a nonsense to say I'm<br />
advocating. What I've just proposed to you is the truth.<br />
You are not paying a fringe benefit~' u ] Kirribilli House or<br />
the Lodge, you're not paying it on your VIP flights.<br />
PM: Alan, you won't got me upset by this. Let me just make<br />
the point.<br />
JONRS: Well answer the question. </p>
<p>PH: NOW I would lust suggest Alan, when I can resume<br />
Answering the question, if you look at your transcript you<br />
will œ ftS that it's not an asking of a question, it ic an<br />
assertio. n in regard to the motor vehicle industry that it's<br />
In disarray because of the FBT. Nov I'm answering that, in<br />
I. fact, what this government did in 1985-86, not because we<br />
wanted to, we brought in a tight monetary policy.~~ a<br />
situation where the world wiped $ 9-1b1i11l io ofah~ eoo<br />
capacity of this country. Not through any fault of any<br />
workors or employers or farmers or miners. They just started<br />
suddenly paying us very very isuch less for our coal, our iron<br />
ore, our wheat, our dairy products and our sugar. That was<br />
$ 9 billion wiped off. We had to bring back the standard of<br />
living In this uountry. we had to lower the level of<br />
economic activity because we weren't earning enough to pay<br />
for the imports that we were bringing in. So not because any<br />
politician Alan, or any Prime Minister, likes high interest<br />
rates. We brought in a tight monetary policy to lower the<br />
level of activity. And part Alan, of that increase of<br />
intarovt rates, a deliberate thing to do, was reflected in<br />
the motor vehicle industry. All I'm saying to you Alan, is<br />
tlhat if you look at the statistica of motor vehicle sales, it<br />
was the result of that, plus other things that were happening<br />
within the motor vehicle industry, but particularly high<br />
Interest rates had their imapact it was not the FBT.<br />
JONES: OR, can we take the FBT. You said to me once before,<br />
that the reason the FBT was paid by the employer and not the<br />
V14-1 will. But don't say that when you say the motor<br />
vehicle industry is In disauray because of the FBI' that's<br />
what you said the motor vehicle industry Is in disarray<br />
because of the FBT<br />
JONES: Well, why Is It in disarray?<br />
PM:: Let me just point out tou you, that in fact if you look<br />
at the compononts of the muotor ve hicle sales, that the area<br />
where the FBT applies is not the area In which the loss of<br />
cAles has occuxred. it is in the consumer, the ordinary<br />
consumer, not In the fleet sales. That Is a fact, which-<br />
JONES: . high Interest r-ates are stopping the consumer<br />
from borrowing muoneiy to buy a vehicle.<br />
P14: ThatL's right. That's absolutely right. And in fact<br />
what we'did in 1985-86-<br />
JONES: So It is your fault?<br />
PH4: Well<br />
JONES: Hligh interest rates.<br />
PH: Well can I finish or are you just going to keep<br />
interrupting and make your advocacy. I can finish can 1,<br />
good. JONES: word, advocacy. You can be an advocate and I<br />
can't. Away you go. DD OUI IUU4 DO r U4 </p>
<p>eiapluyee was that the unio~ n movement wouldn't wear it. Why<br />
should a tax be imposed on someone who doeon't enjoy the<br />
betiefit? if' you're going to have a fringe benefits tax, whay<br />
shouldn't and that's your entitlement because you're Prime<br />
minister -why shouldn't the tax be paid by those enjoying<br />
the benefit and why shouldn't then real leadership say, by<br />
JBob Hlawke and Paul Keating and everybody, I'm going to pay<br />
tax on my benefits. My Xirribilli House, my Lodge# my free<br />
cars, my VIP aircraft? Then isn't that legitimate<br />
leadership? Why do we say the rules apply to others but not<br />
to Je?<br />
PM: That's not accurate. What in fact happened is, that<br />
what I did to myself In respect to the composition of my<br />
Income was to inpose a disadvantage on myself. As a result<br />
of the Hawke/ Keating tax reform, I was $ 54 a week worse off.<br />
So don't try and say that I didn't apply to myself a<br />
disadvantageous rule. if you want the comparison-<br />
JONES: Tax Isn~' t paid on all those things.<br />
PH: But let me. put the point to you-<br />
JONES: There's no tax paid on Xirribilli Houve, thu VIP<br />
aircrafts, the free Stamps.<br />
PM: Of course there'a no tax because that is part of the<br />
naecessary discharge of the duties of office. In. the same<br />
way, If in business you have an interest cost, that Is tax<br />
deductible. Do you suggest, in other words-<br />
JONES: Well what Is a fringe benefit?<br />
PHf: A f-rinqe beunefit. is something where an emolumenat is<br />
paid to someone as a substitute for a norm. 1al'vq b~ alry. Now<br />
let's just be clear. What has happened as a' esult ot the<br />
bzinging in ot the fringe benefit is that you are having a<br />
change of' the cimouent structure. A lot of companies said,<br />
alright here'n execuitive. Instead of paying him $ 150,000<br />
a yeax, whicb~ tract, full tax as their ordinary employer<br />
Llauy bdy well we will givo luu 4 was, ww will giv ytau fr&amp; 6<br />
educ ion, we'll give you the education of your kids. we'll<br />
pay tor the education o~ f your kids In a private school -I<br />
JONES: Prime Hinivter. Not your educ~ ation. We say look<br />
it'is nonsense to ask the Prime Hinister to work for $ 100,000<br />
but how we make it attractive is we say we'll only give you<br />
$ 100,000 but we'll give you a house here, a house there.<br />
That's how' we got people Into office.<br />
H: o not at all. It's been a deliberate decision of past<br />
Prino Mnisters, past governments, under all governments to<br />
say that. to discharge the duty of Prime Minister there's a<br />
rosidence in Canberra. They also say a residence in Sydney.<br />
But they say that you fly in VIP aircraft. Nov that's been<br />
going on under successive It's not a perk, it's not a<br />
substitute for my salary. It is a necessary part of doing<br />
the job, the same way as if In a executive's position, there<br />
is something that's he's doing which is a necessary part of<br />
hig job, then that's not a fringe benefit. It ' s where there<br />
is a dioivion that instead of paying you a salary, you will </p>
<p>-Aa oidthe situation of attracting tax on salary. Well1<br />
instead pay for the education of your kids. It's not in any<br />
sense a necessary part of the doing of your job.<br />
A: 116 20 to 10 and its Alan Jones with you till 12. 1<br />
am spieakin~ g with Australia's PM, Mr Robert Hawke.... on 1' ritige<br />
PM: Yeah<br />
A j Bob Hawke's got a question about FBI<br />
PM: Nu. I just wanted to point out thut thc rrco of theLlb<br />
Party Mr John Vaider, good friend of yours I iblnk....<br />
Aji what was, that?<br />
r w Your eyes blinked*<br />
Aji Cati I just stakc the polni. If you have an uffliation<br />
with the lab Party ( inaudible) it you have It with the<br />
other side you are not. Does that disqualify ine?<br />
PM-. I just wondered wheuther you were at freind of john's.<br />
Aji He would be able to tell you that better than 1.<br />
PM1 But I just wanted to say tljuL the Pies of the Llb party<br />
&amp; greet, witli me opi the 00<br />
Aji Who have you Ijeen talking to?<br />
PM: John Volder has been talking and this tip Out lie has to<br />
say, lHe talks about the whole deseaee of FD. " I have got to<br />
say that it to a fair and just thing in this country to get rid<br />
* of it"..,. and that Is what( hie is saying. His words.<br />
* AJ: What you tre talking about is fair about school feet;<br />
and all that stuff is right.<br />
PM1 But letp see what the Prcs of the Llb Party says. Let<br />
me remind you of what he says. He said " I would like to see<br />
them ( thats tle Lah Party) do thes v. hard things ( gietting rid<br />
of F11) because electorally that is the fact of the matter they<br />
are going to get into trouble. They are not easy to do.<br />
So I have said nany times, let tiC Lab Party get on<br />
imaplemeinting the more necessary but the los popular<br />
patt of our policies. And lets hope they get thaem into place<br />
and promiptly Ilo~ office. And I think that would be a v. good<br />
Oeeflo. .1 In1 other words any political leader who says, that has<br />
no political morality wbatso ever. Arid I uni t1ulte prepared<br />
to say that to Mr Valder. That is an unacceptable rofWvpiaO to put<br />
to anybody.<br />
PM: WL-11 that Is the Pre&amp; of the Llb Party.<br />
Well that is &amp; nr unacceptable proposition and would be<br />
unacceptatble to decent and fair minded people In the community.<br />
Can 1 just take the second pilt Okough about policy positions. </p>

You ald then that tlie motor vehicle industry. arn You acknowledse<br />

What about Ini this rotate thc housing industry? Negativye gearing.<br />
Negul~. ve genrlng dOeff apply arnd a lot of people don't understand<br />
it, do 1tlICy1 that you can make a loss on an investment and write<br />
if Off Igainst income. I can do that if I own a boot shop at the<br />

it off against Income I have earned elswhere. I can't do that If<br />
I put mny snoncy in &amp; anoime. Now you don't come from thin etate<br />
but you launched your canqpaIgn here and there is an awful mecss<br />
In the housing Industry. On thc on c hand you can't got money into<br />
it and on the second hand because people have got the Ir iloney I ii<br />
it and now scan't negatively genr they hove got to charge high rentals.<br />
So we liave ucitioalelevels or rental and the incapacity for<br />
people to buy and money in the industry drying uap. Are you saying<br />
that neg. gearing In the housing industry haui't produced that<br />

a couple ot points about the housings. uio rtl n~ hcn<br />
we have donie. When we came to offl tt 1' h ou a In % sBit I crlO~ MH Ft ly,<br />

But in the same circumstances I talked to you &amp; bout before wherc<br />
wehdd thet lowe~ r ativity we brought that back, it will<br />
flow be running OVUL' 120,000 this year. The 1 g ene rnI y<br />
speak ii. With regard to public housinig, we have as you know very<br />
VVL-y substantilly tnereasea the number I think It Js 40 odd tp<br />
In real termst, the tunding for public housing. So we are<br />
conbcious of the problem that exists, We have had! particular<br />
policics Including the firot home owner~ policy which has Sot<br />
now I ntillioij yvunig Austrdlians into homes and acknowledged<br />
* Liy the housing-industry to be the best piolicy that has been<br />

with regard to housing Senerally. In riegard tu tieg. gearing<br />
the problem wds that process was used by somne people to<br />
provide renital aLCvirsnneuodaia but it was a substantial tax<br />
avoidancc measure. So we were faced with a ffituntion where<br />
we wanted to sash the tax. avoidance industry in this countr.-<br />

Into the future but we have wIth thle treasurer and the minJi 4ter<br />

witin the last period of 6 monlths when we were considering<br />

PM: yes, it was,<br />
AJ: D~ o you think that too many of the statemento that you have<br />
made ini the past, about cap gains tax, about levels of interest<br />
rates.' For example, you have said that interest rateii are going to<br />
fall in the next 12 months. And yet you have also said that you<br />
will m'ointairi the real value of wages. Now how the hell can you<br />
maintain the real value of wages and pay for that arnd presumably<br />
pay for It1twf burgeoning deficits and at the samc time reduce<br />
the level of interest rates. It seems to me that they are completely<br />
Incompatible... uflless of coursc you are speaking out of another<br />

PM: Now let me pick up the first p~ art of your long queon,<br />
and I will accept that It i* a question. You refer to what I said<br />
about cap gains tax... that iv Implying on your part that there was<br />
a broken promise there. 6.. fow that is totally dimi seed in what you read<br />

PM; Ok. Why can I read it rather tiadl your intrepretatian<br />
of Whatf I said?<br />
* AJ; YOu wouldn't read it as Well as I Would<br />
PM: But I would read it accuraitely. Respones Original<br />
W commitment was given in the context of the 1983 election caumpaign.<br />
There was no capital gains tax In Labor's first term, the period,<br />
for which the commitment was made. Labor's position on tax reform<br />
during the second term was made clear in the 1984 campaign. Labor<br />
pledged to overhaul ( inaudible) and reform the tax system after<br />
process of consultation based on the national tax summit. Labor<br />
spelt out 9 principles of taxation reform which included that any<br />
reform paCkage must have wide cominunity support. A cap p gins<br />
tax was Introduced in our 2nd term as part of the package developed<br />
by the govt in the light of those consultations, In othar words<br />
the promirie in 1983 was kept. No cap gains tax In our first term.<br />
I said when I went to the next election the whole questiLon of tax<br />
Including cap gains tax is on the table there is no breaking that<br />
promi se.<br />
AJ: No groping of the hands* under the table you don't think.<br />
You didn't tell them that you were goingi to introduce cap gains tax<br />
because you would hftve been knocked off.<br />
PM: In 1984..... </p>
<p>11' you had said in 1964 under Peacock that you were going~<br />
to introduce cap gains tax they wculdv'e gonse after you.<br />
Wouldn't they?<br />
PM: In 1984 1 said It is on Lhe table the whole question<br />
including Cop plan3 tax, is oni thc table.<br />
Do you trust the Austn people?<br />
IPM; 1 Certainly do. Arid Infinately 111UL't than John Howard<br />
because I tell Lhoai what is going to happen.<br />
Aj: You are not going to tel I thcm wha. t is going to be in your<br />
budget. PM; On the contrar'y it is 4ll there. It to done.<br />
So we can't have any muore expcnditure cuts. Wo &amp; r6 Aoina<br />
to lace interest rates as they are?<br />
? NJ: No we aire not we are going Lu face intereat rates falling...<br />
Aji But you bald<br />
PeM: Let me quote you what Mr Cullen said....<br />
Aj; but for every one you quute in your fAvour there 1Is<br />
muost probably one against<br />
PM: No there Isn't. YOu find me the banker who aus~ e<br />
AJ: But banikerb are not Bletty Bloggs at Dairnair are they?<br />
Who 1,6 out there paying interest rates and taxed to the eyebullu.<br />
P'M: The bduskerai Alan, the bankers net the interest ratoo.<br />
And all I can say Is Mr Cullen, Austu baiikers assn. ML-Cullen weas<br />
asked, after I said the day before, that I expected inter-tvt rates<br />
to0 all1 9 4<br />
A] Hdve you ductieseed t hese people though?<br />
PM; Now colse on be fair....<br />
AJ. Well have~ you, have you, have you?<br />
PM: No I haven't Alan. I don't know Mr Cullcn,<br />
AJ. What about your media 1egielat'ian.?<br />
lPg atOW? Como 117A Did you speak to the. barons over the media<br />
I. Don't dodge away<br />
* AJ: B~ ut did you speak to the med~ ia barons over the legislation.<br />
PM.-I w1ill talk to you In a minute about.... en I finis4h<br />
interest ratcB?<br />
Well therc's your next quetionw... I will put It On noticei. </p>
<p>PM: Mr Cullen was asked after Mr H~ awke * dd that rtat<br />
rates would fall. He was asked whether Mr H was, entitled to say<br />
that arnd he went on and said that " the beat judAement of the moment<br />
is that the trends look favourable.. Gnd we would certainly hop<br />
to be able to reduce mortgage rates before the end of the year.<br />
lie wits asked, " would you 5say that the trend towards lower interest<br />
rates is as a consequence of the Hawke Labor govte economic<br />
policy", lie said: " not entirely because of us but he said that<br />
the Sovt policy in a number of rcivpects has undoubtedly contributed<br />
to the present situation". Now you see that is a spokesman for the<br />
banks. They are saying that interest rates are going to be falling,<br />
They are saying that the U~ s judgemnent is one that we agree with.<br />
AJ; But listen. If productivity to lgoingt to be around about<br />
inflat ion and you have said yesterday and I can't believe,<br />
that wages will maintain their real value how are you going<br />
to pay for those wages? Because productivity is not going to pay<br />
for themr. Are you going to pay for It by Increasing the debt?<br />
And if'you do that can you possibly reduce interest rates? It<br />
4J e fn ' t irike acee to me.<br />
rM: Now will you listen while I tell you?<br />
Ready to listen.<br />
PM: Good. Lets look at the Jebt vitumt ion, when we broultht, fr<br />
the last buidget we made an estimate of what the current accourid<br />
deficit figure would be in 1986/ 87. As a result of the policies<br />
that we. are bringing in that current account deficit for 86/ 87<br />
will be $ 11 bn less than we estimated, in Aug of last yeair and It<br />
will fall further in 87/ 88. So the currenit ac deficIt is falling.<br />
Our increases in exports arc beyond expectations. And most importantly<br />
in the area of manufactured exports 34% Increase. So all those<br />
trends on our external situation are in the right direction. Internally<br />
with regnrd to your question about wages.... the situation is that<br />
we expect wages and prices, during 87/ 88 to move by about the<br />
same proportion about 6 Now the important thing. Not<br />
only does that mean that you hold the real value of wages, here in<br />
Aust, at about their level, but importantly we are going to improve<br />
our competitive position with the rest of the worldiat. Bvcause<br />
while Inflation Is coming downa In Australia,..<br />
Still not competitive with the real ol the world this.<br />
IBM1 Can I finish? That is exautly what I am goiig to talk<br />
about before you interrupted. Thbe Inflatioi in Aust Is comning<br />
down moving down, and it is $ joing up In the rest of the world<br />
amofl~ st our trading competltors. In other words.<br />
Aj; From the lower bass...<br />
P'M; The gap, in oter words ts narrowing cigntfi'cantly.<br />
Al: I concede that.<br />
Phi: And what is happening Is thatt ix ts; beig relctecl in<br />
our capacity, Alan to conipcte in &amp; L-CaS of export that wa could<br />
never do berore. I don't know whether you have had the opportunity,<br />
but one of the most etcciting t hingsa thtt is happening In the Lountry<br />
now and I ought&amp; a take you arounl with me sometime and you could<br />
see it to go to manufacturing enterprises in Auistralia which are </p>
<p>now going out anrd beatinug thd hell out of the AItbertcanik, the Japu<br />
and th. e Europeans in the most Competitive markets in the world.<br />
For instance I was un in Bundaberg last week, a really excit ing<br />
cane cutting equipment sophisticated trench digging equipment.<br />
Now they are selling those can* cutters now in the most competitive<br />
markets. On th~ e other side of this most sophisticated Ltrogich<br />
digging equipmcnt we currently had been Importing that equipment from<br />
the USA. Now the fella himself says he says as a result of your<br />
govt policies and the specific assistance yuhave given to Industries<br />
like ours we are now going to take the hole of tat market off<br />
the yanks here in Australia. Without the rhetoric Alan it really<br />
to v. exciting to see those things happening,<br />
AJo How do we get more conapetitivat NOw Bob* Hawke * aid when he<br />
was Pros of the ACTU that there should be no sanction~ s. The sanctions<br />
that apply to other people... for Instance, t'drive dowa the wrong<br />
side of the road$ 1 am hauled over. Drive down the wrong side of the<br />
industrial road should there be sanctions? Should the union movement<br />
be above the law?<br />
Pie No it certainly shouldn't be. And under the peoposals that<br />
v, were putting in under the industrial relations bill not only<br />
d'ii we not say that but we Increased the sanctions. Now the employers<br />
said Chat they didn't like the way we were doing it and I said after<br />
discussions with them that I thought It was against their own interests.<br />
Alawni1l sa to ou honestly that I just don't understand what<br />
the employers are bout. 0 Because what we were doing, was in effect<br />
to bring in a tougher set of sanct ions. But the employers didn't<br />
likkI that and they said that they would prefer to keep it as it was,<br />
With access to conwaokalaw. With access to,.,<br />
Aji out you took that awayt<br />
PM: No I didn't. What we did do was to bring a&amp; situation where<br />
you wouldn't conteunperonerously have 2 sets of actions available but<br />
they still would've been able to have gone welt they still would've<br />
had access to the trade practices legislation but it would've been<br />
within the framevwork of the labour court. They said. they didn't like<br />
St so I have given them Alan,* the unequivocal conxnitmeuit which the<br />
W ness, Council of Aust and the CAI accept. I have no argument<br />
h them at alli. -They accept what I say and said the posit ion<br />
will stay as It i G" ( PM:<br />
A~ tSo the legislation is out. W( We'll taka a broak.<br />
Mr Hawke one of the issues that has been raised fairly regularly on<br />
this show, through calls, and I don't quite kitow its origins,<br />
concerns the whole question of FAbian Socialism. And Ithink I<br />
have an obligation, and many people have asked this, to clarify a<br />
few things,-if. you can. You said in your 1984 centenary IT eech<br />
to the FAb ah Society and I quote: " I gladly acknowledge the<br />
debt of my own govt to Fabianism".. Yet the philosophy of that society,<br />
written in 1887 and I am sure you are aware of this, says and I quote<br />
again: " the Fabian society aims at the re organisation or society<br />
by the emancipation of land, and industrial capital from individual<br />
and class ownership." it went on. " The society works for the<br />
extinction of private property". Now I may that because Neal Dlewett<br />
last year at the ALP SAustn. branch conference said and I quote " Let<br />
me say as a socialist that Its the interests of the commiu'. nity that shoulwi </p>
<p>cogme before the Individual. We shouldn't get too hung up as eoicalistt.<br />
on privacy because privacy in many ways is the bourgeois right that<br />
is v. much associated with the right to own private property". Your<br />
presence at that dinner would seem to endorse the notion of FAbian<br />
sOC. lal isri)...<br />
PM; Which dinner?<br />
AJ: The Centenary Dinner of the Fabian Society in Mdlb In 1984/,.<br />
PM: I completely reject any proposition, explicit of Inhorent<br />
ogalinst the right to own priv. property. 1 don't only have to make<br />
that observation which is so clear....<br />
Aj: YOU knew that Neal Blewctt said that?<br />
PM: I don't Know the exert words of Neal Blewatt.<br />
AJi Kerctuble, wouldn't you think?<br />
PMi I certainly wouldn't have said those sorts of things in<br />
those words. But a. qain to be fair to Neal, it is easier enough<br />
S for you to say, and I am not saying that you are doing this<br />
deliberately, all you have got is some quotes In front of you.<br />
It may be if you look at the whole of what Neal had said that<br />
thut sort of thing....<br />
S A] Jl We should'nt get hung up en privacy??<br />
PM: What I am saylng.... could take an Alan Jones address to<br />
his players, 1 would think, I have never listened to one...<br />
AJ: You should come along oamatlme.<br />
PM; 1 am not good enough to play.<br />
AJ: Why do you send a teleA to Patrick Cash in the 1ut<br />
round of Wimbledon wishing him well, but rever to Andrew Slack?<br />
S PM: That&amp; not right. I have scnt a message to you pople and<br />
you know that. So on't...<br />
S AJ: 1984.<br />
PM: Let me say this. If I took a paesage out of Alan Jones'<br />
speech just one, god look at that'. It would make you look terrible.<br />
But I guess If I put It in the whole context of your speech it would<br />
look fairly inspiring. L. cts get to the point of private properly<br />
and prlv. entereprise. From Day I I said to the Austn. people and<br />
I say it again, unless we have a healthly priv. sector we won't have<br />
a healthy Australia. And that is what 1 have been talking about since<br />
Day 1 to stimulate the priv. sector. To get jobs and investment In<br />
the priv. sector. 75% of all people who are employed In this country<br />
arc employed in the priv. sector. That is why for instance as I<br />
was saylng to you off air, I brought in the most generous research<br />
and development taxation schme for the priv, section. Because unless<br />
we have that priv. sector in this country investing in research.<br />
Investing in development. Being able to become more profitable...<br />
Look what we have done. When we came to office the profit sector </p>
<p>of the CDP' wa's the lowest it had been In mamory and I Wad that wc<br />
had to hiv e a move back to prof it. Because unless you have a move<br />
' back, you won't have investment. YOu won't have employment arnd that<br />
to what we havo don.<br />
AJ So you are agin the FAbidn notiori of getting rid of priv.<br />
property? Ph I~ Certainly.<br />

Hwas there was social welfare fraud but what we say Is 2 thitn SO<br />
