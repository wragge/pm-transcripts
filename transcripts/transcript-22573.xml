    <content><![CDATA[<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, Tony Blair said the war on terror will last a generation, was that a topic of discussion in your conversation with him last night?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>The views that he expressed echo views I have expressed on a number of occasions. You can't put a date on it but it will go on for a long time and his sentiments and those of the head of MI5 are very similar to my own.  We talked about Iraq and that obviously has a context in the war against terrorism because if there is a western defeat in Iraq that will be a huge boost to the terrorists.  We also talked about climate change issues and we agreed that the different interests of different parts of the world had to be accommodated and I've frequently said, and I say it again, that we have to bring the perspective of our own region to this issue and not just the perspective of Europe.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Did he support your idea of a new Kyoto?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>He recognises that the existing framework is inadequate.  Absolutely. I did mention to him that the Japanese have made it very plain at the Nairobi meeting that they thought we'd had to go on from the existing arrangements.  Thank you.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, on a totally different topic, Belinda Emmett passed away this morning, I'm not sure if you're aware?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, I'm not.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Do you have any thoughts on that?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I'm not aware of the circumstances. I'm sorry. I will say something later, I was not aware of the circumstances.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Do you have any specific strategy in relation to Iraq?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I have made my position clear on that before. Thank you.</p>
