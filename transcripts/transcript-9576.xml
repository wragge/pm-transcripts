SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
OPENING OF VICTORIA UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY<br />
SUNBURY CAMPUS, VICTORIA, 12 MAY 1995<br />
** CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY"*<br />
I'm very pleased to be invited to open the Sunbury Campus of the Victorian University<br />
of Technology. It's a beautifiil campus, and a fine example of the emerging integration<br />
of post-compulsory education.<br />
The Sunbury Campus is proof of the potential which exists when the two essential<br />
elements of tertiary education, TAFE and universities, are linked.<br />
It is a natural development stemming fr~ om the reforms to post-compulsory education<br />
initiated by John Dawkins in 1988.<br />
New institutions like Sunbury been made possible by the increased revenue flowing<br />
into higher education from the establishment of the fairest and most innovative<br />
financing mechanism in the world, the Higher Education Contribution Scheme.<br />
Since the education reforms in 1988, Australian post-compulsory education has<br />
undergone extraordinary changes and expansion.<br />
The previous separation of TAFE and higher education, which restricted the access of<br />
the less advantaged to many forms of skills development, is now being broken down.<br />
It is becomidng recognised that the distinctions between vocational and academic<br />
education are essentially arbitrary and a reflection of history and inertia.<br />
TAFE is no longer seen as the poor and distant cousin of tbe university system, and<br />
propitious arrangements for credit transfer which no-one foresaw are now emerging.<br />
And it is not only here: two months ago I visited the University of Southern<br />
Queensland which has developed close and imaginative links with NSW TAFE.<br />
Sunbury is going in exactly the right direction. We want a more complementary and<br />
united formal skills development program and that is what Sunbury is doing.<br />
The students who derive the advantages of Sunbury's innovative educational reform<br />
can, in important ways, trace their good fortune to HECS. </p>
<p>H-ECS was introduced in 1989 to a cacophony of student complaints. We were told<br />
that: free education is a right; HECS will restrict the access of the poor to higher<br />
education; higher education helps all society and thus should be fully paid for by the<br />
Government; and that women will be discouraged from enrolling.<br />
I want to spend a minute or two addressing some of these issues.<br />
There is no such thing, of course, as " free" education somebody has to pay. In<br />
systems with no charges those somebodies are all taxpayers.<br />
This is a pretty important point: a " free" higher education system is one paid for by the<br />
taxes of all, the majority of whom haven't had the privilege of a university education.<br />
Ask yourself if you think that is a fair thing.<br />
The most common complaint was that if we asked students to pay for some part of<br />
their higher education, the poor would be deterred even if they didn't have to pay<br />
until they were earning at least the average income. This most common argument was<br />
in fact the hardest to believe, simply because HECS was designed to insure that<br />
students paid nothing when they couldn't afford to.<br />
Nevertheless, the Government has kept an eye on the disadvantaged. And there have<br />
been several independent studies of this issue.<br />
The evidence that HECS deters the disadvantaged is a bit lie a policy statement from<br />
my opponents: the more you look, the less you see.<br />
The most recent study, published in the Current Affairs Bulletin in January 1995, puts<br />
it this way: introduction of HECS does not seem to have had any discernible<br />
effects on the composition of the student body".<br />
But a major effect of HECS has been to allow the system to grow at an extraordinary<br />
rate since 1989, and this has unquestionably helped the disadvantaged by creating more<br />
places. From 1988 to 1993, for example, the number of higher education students<br />
from the poorest of backgrounds has grown by around 30 per cent.<br />
igher education generally has expanded at a similar pace, with one of the major<br />
reasons being that all of the HECS revenue has been used for this purpose for higher<br />
education, as the Government promised. The increase in total outlays on higher<br />
education of about $ 3 billion since 1990 has been underwritten to the tune of about<br />
billion from HECS repayments.<br />
This means that 50 per cent of the new places are here because of HECS revenue; that<br />
up to 100,000 of today's students more than likely would have been doing something<br />
else probably something far less interesting and beneficial. </p>
<p>The capital provided for the Sunbury initiative has come from the Commonwealth<br />
through AINTA, the State Goverrnent, and the university. As well, the Victoria<br />
Institute of Technology will receive $ 15. 9m from the Commonwealth as part of the<br />
incorporation of higher education capital funding into institutions' operating grants<br />
over the 1995-97 triennium.<br />
Without HECS, and the support from both ANTA and the Victorian Government,<br />
then, it is much less likely that we would be able to open the Sunbury Campus today.<br />
And is undoubtedly true that, without HECS, there would be far fewer students in<br />
general, and far fewer disadvantaged students in particular.<br />
But is it fair to charge at all when society derives considerable benefits from tertiary<br />
education shouldn't this mean a subsidy? Certainly, education and training beget<br />
technological change, and technological change is the only way in the longer term for<br />
our collective incomes to grow.<br />
Moreover, education and training are a fundamental part of governments' armoury for<br />
breaking the nexus between parental poverty and childrens' access to material and<br />
social gain through skills formation.<br />
For these reasons the HECS charge is only about 23 per cent of the costs of a place,<br />
and not 100 per cent. For these reasons TAPE costs are overwhelmingly met by<br />
governments. Finally, female enrolments have grown relatively quickly since 1988. Women now<br />
outnumber men in our universities HECS hasn't hurt here either.<br />
The case for HECS is overwhelmning. Not charging means allocating scarce resources<br />
provided by all to students who generally come from advantaged backgrounds and<br />
who inevitably get the best and most highly paid jobs. But charging only when former<br />
students are doing well financially ensures there are no barriers.<br />
Now I have to come clean and tell you that HECS does have a problem: the Coalition<br />
is not commnitted to it.<br />
In the last election the Coalition's higher education policy was to allow universities to<br />
charge up-front fees. Sure, they said, they would keep HECS places as they were and<br />
just allow this as a top-up.<br />
But, as sure as night follows day, HECS would have been eroded. Don't forget, the<br />
Opposition is completely committed to drastic cuts in public expenditure. In time,<br />
higher education would have become a very easy target, and up-front fees the norm. </p>
<p>HECS is spreading throughout the world as the right way to charge for university<br />
attendance ( and variants of it have now been introduced in the US, New Zealand, the<br />
Czech Republic, and it is recommended by the World Bank for developing countries).<br />
HIECS covers the vast majority of post-graduate Australian courses, and an extension<br />
to cover even more has recently been offered as a possibility by the Stanley Committee<br />
Review in the event that fees in this area which only apply to 15 per cent of students<br />
present access problems in the future.<br />
Sadly, the Opposition can't see the beauty of our financing arrangements.<br />
For the next election, then, write this down: the Government guarantees HECS, the<br />
Opposition doesn't. The Governent will not compromise access to post-compulsory<br />
education, the Opposition will. The Government is repulsed by the notion of full upfr~<br />
ont fees for undergraduates, the Opposition embraces them.<br />
It is one of the more bemnusing refrains of contemporary Australian politics, to hear the<br />
Opposition talk about microeconomic reform as a means to greater productivity and a<br />
more internationally competitive economy, while refusing to commit themselves to<br />
equality of opportunity in a sophisticated education and training system.<br />
As if clearing the way for the development of all our human resources and the fullest<br />
expression of all our human potential is not a microeconomic reform of the most<br />
fundamental kind.<br />
Nothing is so basic a prerequisite of our economic future and the future well-being of<br />
Australian society.<br />
It is an integral part of our economic and social policy, our national strategy and<br />
vision, to establish an innovative and integrated formal skills system in Australia.<br />
ANTA and higher education funding, with State government support, together<br />
committed to the expansion of opportunities.<br />
Education and training are the fundamental building blocks for our future prosperity.<br />
Education and training are the answers to sustained and healthy productivity growth.<br />
Education and training are the key to the break-down of entrenched inter-generational<br />
poverty. As I have said before, for both the individual and the nation, education and training<br />
constitute the bridge between the past and the future.<br />
In last Tuesday's Budget the Government set out a revolutionary long-term retirement<br />
plan for the nation. It will guarantee that the incomes of future senior citizens will be<br />
higher and more secure.<br />
The Budget means that there will be considerably greater domestic savings available to<br />
finance our investments. This helps to provide insurance against adverse international<br />
financial fluctuations. </p>
<p>Australia's revolutionary new means to greater vastly greater national savings is of a<br />
kind with the reform, expansion and equitable financing of post-compulsory education.<br />
Both help to set the country up for the 21st century both are major investments in<br />
our future.<br />
Both represent progressive and imaginative policy: both are motivated by national<br />
need, designed to develop the economic fundamentals, and delivered in ways that<br />
improve the social and material circumstances of those with the least advantages.<br />
Both, I might say, are Labor to the bootstraps.<br />
The Sunbury Campus is an institutional manifestation of Labor's commitment to<br />
educational, social and economic reform. It encapsulates the big idea.<br />
And so it is with great pleasure that I formally open it. It is a great pleasure because I<br />
know that this campus will well serve this community and thousands of tertiary<br />
students from now on into the next century.<br />
