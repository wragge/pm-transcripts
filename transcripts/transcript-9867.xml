SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING, MP<br />
ANNIVERSARY DINNER OF THE ISRAEL CHAMBER OF<br />
COMMERCE, SYDNEY<br />
MONDAY 4 DECEMBER, 1995<br />
It is a very great pleasure to be here this evening to mark the 25th anniversary<br />
of the Australia Israel Chamber of Commerce.<br />
The Chambers achievements over that quarter century are substantial and Its<br />
potential is even greater. So there are many reasons to celebrate tonight and! I<br />
will cc-me to them shortly.<br />
But I hope you will forgive me if I begin on a more sombre and personal note.<br />
Only it month ago I made my first visit to Israel, for the funeral of Yitzhak<br />
Rabin. They were the saddest of circumstances in which to make such a<br />
joury. The number of leaders who had travelled to Jerusalem from around the world<br />
was testimony to Yitzhak Rabin's remarkable life. He had physical courage, of<br />
coursia and not only as a soldier, but as a politician too. But It was in his<br />
moral courage that his true greatness lay. He was a man whose whole life had<br />
been devoted to the survival and security of Israel. But when it mattered, he<br />
had thie imagination, flexibility and courage to see that that same cause was<br />
now served best by a policy of negotiation with the Palestinians.<br />
The Image of King Hussein of Jordan, President Mubarak of Egypt, Prime<br />
Minister Chemomyrdfin of Russia and President Clinton standing together In<br />
Jerus. Wemn, In the Mount Herzl national cemetery and speaking of their shared<br />
loss was, surely one of the most moving public moments of the late twentieth<br />
century. But, in a way, just as moving for me as that ceremony was what the funeral<br />
revealed about Israel Itself and about Israelis. The quiet, determined faces of<br />
the thousands of young people lining the streets holding up peace signs, the<br />
Informality and simplicity of the funeral and the memorial service solemn but </p>
<p>without high pageantry or panoply all struck a powerful chord with me as an<br />
Australian, because they were a signal of a deep sense of democracy and<br />
equality which Is at the essence of both our countries.<br />
I often think that immigrant societies, wherever they are placed, are closer to<br />
each otlher in tenor and tone than they are to the countries from which their<br />
populations originally sprang. I felt that strongly in Israel.<br />
Yltzhatk Rabins assassin robbed Israel and the world of a life that mattered,<br />
and punctured the dream of Jewish people everywhere ftht Israel, above all<br />
other things, was a place of sanctuary.<br />
But ho did not kill that dream. I came away from my short visit convinced that<br />
the people of Israel would draw strength from the tragedy of Rabin's death.<br />
And that this was a society which would come through the ordeal it now faced<br />
strongier and more able to meet the challenges and they are profound<br />
challenges which lie ahead.<br />
Because the work of peace which Rabin supported has much further to go.<br />
The interim agreement between Israel and the PLO was signed on 28<br />
September but it now has to be implemented.<br />
The negotiations still to come on permanent arrangements for the peace<br />
settlement will be even more difficult. Above all else they will require goodwill<br />
and generosity. And it will be very important, though immensely difficult, to<br />
narrow the differences between Israel and Syria over the next few months.<br />
All of -us hope tat reaction to Yitzhak Rabin's murder will constrain extremism<br />
as these negotiations proceed, but we cannot be confident of that. People on<br />
all sides both the malevolent and the frightened will no doubt continue to try<br />
to derail the process.<br />
My dis3cussions in Jerusalem with Prime Minister Peres left me In no doubt that<br />
he, like Mr Rabin, sees no alternative for Israel or its neighbours to following<br />
the path of peace, however difficult it might appear and however careful the<br />
steps along it must be.<br />
His objective, as he told the Knesset on 22 November, is ato arrive if possible<br />
by the end of th~ s century at a comprehensive peace in the Middle East. To<br />
create a Middle East without violence, without bloodshed, without terrorism,<br />
without war and without the factors which lead to all of these, poverty,<br />
ignorance, backwardness and prejudice%<br />
It Is hardly credible for an Australian Prime Minister, from this distance and from<br />
the security of our continent, to offer detailed advice on these vital issues of<br />
security and peace to those who struggle with them daily and I will not try. I will </p>
<p>only say as I said to Mr Peres that Israel can continue to count on<br />
Australia's goodwill and practical support for the work of peace.<br />
The sort of practical support we can provide is seen in our membership of two<br />
of the working groups set up under the multilateral track of the peace process.<br />
The areas we are working on arms control and regional security, and water<br />
resources are ones where we have some expertise to share. In April this<br />
year, for example, experts from Israel, Jordan, Egypt, the Palestinian Authority,<br />
Morocco and Oman met in Terrigal for a workshop on rainfall enhancement.<br />
This sort of Issue does not generate headlines or high drama, but it offers<br />
avenues for practical cooperation which will be vital if mutual confidence is to<br />
develop within the region.<br />
Australia is, of course, also providing direct support for Palestinian autonomy<br />
through our three-year $ 15 million aid program announced in October 1993.<br />
And Australian defence force personnel continue to play a core role in the Sinai<br />
peacekeeping force and to participate in United Nations peacekeeping<br />
operations elsewhere in the region.<br />
In May 1994, I said in a speech to the Zionist Federation of Australia that<br />
Australia had never wavered and would ne-ver-waver from our commitment to<br />
Israel's right to exist within secure and recognised boundaries. But I added that<br />
beyond those familiar phrases, we would never waver from a deeper conviction<br />
that the international community is a better place, a more decent place, for<br />
the contribution Israel has made and will yet make.<br />
I hope in some small way that Australia can help it make that contribution.<br />
Let me turn now to the reason we are celebrating tonight the 25th anniversary<br />
of the Australia-Israel Chamber of Commerce.<br />
Back In 1970, a sceptical joumalist from the Australian Jewish News asked the<br />
founders of the Chamber whether it was anything more than an Impressive<br />
set-up'.<br />
Well, over the past quarter of a century you have certainly answered that<br />
question decisively. We are here tonight to celebrate your vision and<br />
achievements. As the attendance at this dinner tonight shows, the Chamber has become a<br />
highly respected and influential organisation, with offices throughout Australia,<br />
as well as In Tel Aviv. It has a national membership of over 800 companies,<br />
and a list of Governors that reads like a who's who of corporate Australia. </p>
<p>4<br />
It has been a catalyst for the development of a very lively business partnership<br />
between Australia and Israel. It has organised successful trade missions,<br />
promoted joint ventures and commercial partnerships in third countries and<br />
initiated academic and Industrial research and development agreements.<br />
Earlier this year it was involved In the dedication of a plaque in Israel<br />
recognising the heroism of the Australian Ught Horsemen who were involved in<br />
the charge at Beersheba Wells in October 1917 as part of the advance that led<br />
to Jerusalem's liberation from occupation. Some of the remaining veterans<br />
were present. I thank the Chamber for Its part In arranging this ceremony.<br />
But I suppose the main measur, of the success of a Chamber of Commerce<br />
has to be what has happened to the commerce. AMd here the figures are<br />
strikirg. In 1970, our bilateral trade was worth $ 8.5 million. In essence -as the<br />
Chambers Executive Director, John Weiss, has pointed out Australia sent<br />
Israel coal and wool and we got back oranges and bathing suits in return.<br />
Now it is worth $ 30 million. Coal and wool are still Important, but Australian<br />
exports of elaborately transformed manufactures have also started to make<br />
inroadls into the Israeli market.<br />
There Is no doubt that some strong synergies exist between the Australian and<br />
Israeli economies.<br />
Each of us has a strong research and technology base on which we want to<br />
build. I will have some more to say about that from Australia's side when I<br />
launch the Government's Innovation statement in Melbourne on Wednesday.<br />
In Information technology and telecommunications, for example, both Australia<br />
and lnral had more than 100 exhibitors at the CeBIT fair In Germany which I<br />
attended in March this year.<br />
Israel's privatisation of its cellular and International communications services<br />
has provided an important Investment opportunty for Australian companies. I<br />
am very pleased that Australian companies are now joining International giants<br />
such as Intel, Motorola, IBM, Mitsui and Microsoft In working with Israeli<br />
industry on building Information technology alliances.<br />
Neither of us Is big enough to take on the giants of these Industries alone, but<br />
we can probably Identify some highly rewarding areas of co-operation.<br />
Cooperation Is expanding in other areas, too. The High Technology Trade<br />
Mission to Israel which the Chamber organised In September was the largest<br />
Australian business delegation ever to visit Israel. A number of joint venture </p>
<p>agreements involving the exchange of technology have already come out Of<br />
that mission.<br />
One o~ f these was an agreement to grow in South Australia a new variety of<br />
olive which, as a result of Israeli technology, produces more oil than any other<br />
olive. This project is expected to generate a substantial olive oil industry in<br />
South Australia which will export from Australia throughout the Asia Pacific.<br />
Another source of potential economic partnership must come from our similar<br />
climate and topography.<br />
Solar energy, desalination and water management systems are critical Issues<br />
for both of us and I am sure there are ways we can work more closely together.<br />
Australia is a world leader in water management technology. The Snowy<br />
Mountains Engineering Corporation, for example, has recently conducted<br />
discussions with Israeli authorities over the Jordan Rift Valley project. And an<br />
Israeli compary has successfully combined Australian waste-water technology<br />
with Israeli engineering skill to provide municipal waste water treatment<br />
througjhout Israel.<br />
As wo each move to build our infrastructure to cope with growing populations<br />
from Immigration, our tranisport, construction and service industries also have<br />
great potential to work together.<br />
The new terminal planned for Ben Gurion International Airport has attracted the<br />
interest of Australian companies, as, I am sure, will the planned Cross-Israel<br />
Highway project. Australian firms are being added to the lists of approved<br />
vendors to the Israeli Electric Corporation.<br />
Another real area of potential growth in trade and investment lies in the way we<br />
can each use the other country as a base for regional operations.<br />
Israel's free trade agreements with the United States and the European Union<br />
are an Incentive for Australian companies. IPEX, for example, has chosen<br />
Israel as its European headquarters for their software business and Is among<br />
the fastest growing computer companies In Israel.<br />
But, for the first time, it is also possible to imagine Israel as a potential base for<br />
trade into the Middle East. We are not at that point yet but the signs are all<br />
pointing in its direction. Over time, I am sure that will happen because It serves<br />
the Interests of both Israel and Its neighbours.<br />
The signature of the Israel-Jordan trade agreement in October this year and<br />
the convening of the Amman Summit, in which Israel participated with Arab<br />
courtries, are promising steps. </p>
<p>.6-<br />
In Australia, the first joint tourist promotion program involvng Israel, Egypt,<br />
Jordan and Turkey, is scheduled for early 1996, and Is a very welcome sign of<br />
things to come.<br />
In the other directon, some Israeli companies have already sensed the<br />
potenlial for operating out of Australia Into Asia and the Pacific. I know the<br />
Chamber has been active in spreading that message in Israel.<br />
For example, a leading telecommunications company, Teledata, has set up a<br />
successful mnanufactuing facility In Brisbane which supplies the Australian<br />
dome3tIc market but also exports to Papua New Guinea, the Philippines and<br />
Indonesia<br />
This brings me to a point I want to put firmly on the record.<br />
I am sometimes accused of paying too much attenton to Australia's relations<br />
with Asia at the expense of Australian economic interests elsewhere. This Is<br />
a view you will sometimes hear from my political opponents and from the<br />
stodgier sort of newspaper columnists.<br />
It is not true, of course. But I want to make clear just what I do think becal se<br />
R is vory important to all of us who live in this country and who care about its<br />
fuure. I am convinced of this that unless this country gets our relationship-<br />
Including our economic relationship with Asia right, we will not succeed<br />
elsewhere. This does niot mean that we could not keep other bilateral trade links open. Nor<br />
is it to deny that some of them might prosper.<br />
But, over the long run, this fact seems undeniable to me: the degree of<br />
AustraWlas Integration into the region around us and the experience our<br />
business people gain In matching it with the most dynamic economies in the<br />
world will determine, more than anything else, how relevant we are to other<br />
global markets, and how successful and competitive we are in them.<br />
So my view is simple: our business people should be looking to do business<br />
wherever there Is a profit to be made and a mutual Interest to be served. But<br />
we w~ ll only maximise those opportunities with Israel, for example, or Europe,<br />
when we have shown that we are fully engaged In our own region.<br />
That is why APEC Is important to all Australian business people, even those<br />
whose primary interests lie In other parts of the world.<br />
It is why the outcome of the Osaka leaders' meeting with its agreement on a<br />
plan of action to Implement the commitments we made at Bogor for free trade </p>
<p>in the region by 2010 for industrialised counties and 2020 for developing<br />
countries was such an important development for Australia, but also for others<br />
who want to do business here and In the region.<br />
The O~ saka meeting firmly cemented APEC in place as the key regional body<br />
for co-ordinating the development and growth of the Asia Pacific into the next<br />
century. We e-stimate that the full results of the Bogor commitments will expand the<br />
regional economy by about the size of the present Australian and Korean<br />
economies combined, arnd that Austral~ a's real Income will rise by $ 40 billion<br />
when all the effects have flowed through.<br />
If the Bogor commitments are fully implemented, by 2020 APEC will account<br />
for re than three quarters of global production and three quarters of the<br />
worlds trade.<br />
The effort we have put into setting up APEC and elevating its decision making<br />
to the level of leaders has been directed to these very important alms to<br />
getting Australia a seat at the -world's largest free trade table, and, by keeping<br />
the region's development and growth going, better ensuring Its security as well.<br />
That is good for all Australians and for those who do business here and In the<br />
region.<br />
That Is also why we have been working on the development of links between<br />
the Australa New Zealand Closer Economic Relations agreement and the<br />
ASEAN Free Trade Area.<br />
We recently held the first successful meeting between CER and ASEAN trade<br />
ministers. We agreed to complete a series of practical collaborative projects<br />
which will address Issues of real concern to business people. And these<br />
projects and these developing linkages with Southeast Asia will complement<br />
and neinforce what the Government is working to achieve with APEC.<br />
Anyone who suggests to you that we should be wary about over-emphasising<br />
economic links with the Asia Pacific does not understand, in my view, just what<br />
the causes of global success for Australian traders will be In the decades<br />
ahead. Let me end this speech, not with congratulations-you already have them but<br />
with a challenge.<br />
Because although trade between Australia and Israel has been growing well, it<br />
still falls short of its potential. If it is to reach that potential a sustained effort will<br />
be needed. This will Involve Governments, of course. I know this Is a high<br />
priority of Ambassador Moyal. And his enthusiasm will be matched on our side. </p>
<p>But mainly it will involve the private sectors of our two countries. I can't think of<br />
a more, effective organisation than this one to Identify new areas for trade and<br />
Investment and to put together the people and companies who will be needed<br />
to take the trade relationship between us onto a new level.<br />
I wish the Australia Israel Chamber of Commerce every su cces over the next<br />
twenty-five years.<br />
Ends </p>
