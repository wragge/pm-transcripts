    <content><![CDATA[<p>' 4 ASRLA<br />PRIME MINISTER<br />TRANSCRIPT OF NEWS CONFERENCE, PAN PACIFIC HOTEL, KUALA<br />LUMPUR, 19 OCTOBER 1989<br />E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, the decision by the banks to refinance<br />South Africa. How bad a blow is that to the Commonwealth's<br />effort to get sanctions?<br />PM: Well it shouldn't be exaggerated. I think you should<br />understand that there never was a real expectation that there<br />wouldn't be a rescheduling but we had hoped that there would<br />be a further period of consideration, it wouldn't be done so<br />early. You've got to remember that it's still a fairly tight<br />rescheduling, that there is a requirement for repayment of<br />capital on this occasion and it will still represent a<br />situation of very considerable constraint upon the South<br />African Government, a position which is recognised by the<br />South African Government itself. It will still be available<br />to the international community, methods of seeking to impose<br />further financial pressures upon the Government of South<br />Africa and I've referred to those in my speech to the<br />Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting this morning. I<br />just would make the point that probably I an Joe Clark will<br />be meeting with the Press later on this afternoon and we'll<br />have an opportunity of going to this i ' n more detail and there<br />is some advice we want to get on certain technical aspects of<br />it.<br />JOURNALIST: Aren't you disappointed that the banks don't<br />appear to be listening to international opinion on South<br />Africa? PM: on the contrary it can be said that they have listened<br />to some extent, that the tightening of the requirements for<br />the repayment of capital which are tighter than they were<br />before correspond to suggestions that were made by the<br />Commonwealth Foreign Ministers to the international banking<br />community. So it's not a question of the things that have<br />been said on behalf of the Commonwealth have been entirely<br />neglected. But as I said at the beginning in my response,<br />it's obviously the case that one would've liked to have seen<br />a longer consideration of this matter by the international<br />banks that were involved.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST: But the rescheduling doesn't put any pressure,<br />any political pressure on for change, does it?<br />PM: Well one argument that's been put is that now there's<br />been the accommodation to the extent that there has in this<br />arrangement that the President, de Klerk, will take this as<br />an endorsement for change. Now we however, within the<br />Commonwealth will not be seeking in any sense to relax<br />pressures. On the contrary we've taken the view that the<br />change that is now starting to be talked about within South<br />Africa is a direct result of the pressures that have been<br />applied and we will continue to do that on the basis that if<br />we do then see within South Africa significant changes being<br />made then there is an obligation upon us in the Commonwealth<br />and the international community to respond then by lessening<br />pressures. The point I made in the speech I just made to the<br />Heads of Government was this; that the South African<br />Government is seeking to get normality in its international<br />financial and economic and trading relationships but the<br />essence of the message that we must put to them, you will get<br />the possibility of normality in your international trading<br />relations when you remove the ugly abnormality of apartheid<br />within your country.<br />JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, are you disappointed that New<br />Zealand has confirmed that it didn't support Malcolm Fraser's<br />candidacy yesterday?<br />PM: Yes, I'm disappointed in that. No qualification to make<br />on that answer.<br />JOURNALIST: Did you expect the rescheduling deal to be<br />wrapped up as quickly as it has been, and what are the<br />additional financial pressures you think could be brought to<br />bear on South Africa?<br />PM: As I said, we are a little bit disappointed that it was<br />done when it was. The timing of course I think is not<br />entirely accidental but we think that the pressures that can<br />be brought to bear and should be is that the banks should<br />impose tougher conditions on day to day trading, financing<br />and certainly shouldn't be any greater period of credit terms<br />than 90 days for instance. Secondly, as I've suggested in<br />there today that we should call upon governments to make<br />trade credits harder to get by taking South Africa off cover<br />with government agencies for insurance support for trade<br />credit. Now those sorts of things we think ought to be done.<br />I'm in the position now that I've made these suggestions in<br />the meeting. I led with Kenneth Kuanda on this matter</p>
<p>-3-<br />( PM cont) but there's further discussions to take place.<br />The actual decision of the meeting is still to come. But I<br />would think that the sort of things that I've suggested will<br />be reflected in the decision of the meeting.<br />JOURNALIST: Dr Boesak's proposal for a Commonwealth<br />monitoring body to put pressure on the banks?<br />PM: Part of the five steps that I proposed in there involve<br />the establishment of a specialist monitoring agency.<br />JOURNALIST: Was the Commonwealth completely in the dark<br />about the banks reaching this agreement so early or did they<br />have any indications as to who-<br />PM: We had no indication that the decision would be made at<br />this time and as I say, I don't think it's entirely<br />coincidental that the announcement was made for the<br />commencement of the meeting.<br />JOURNALIST: How many people do you believe switched their<br />vote, who'd given pledges on Mr Fraser?<br />PM: I don't know. It only required a change of a very few<br />people to have reversed the decision and I can't be quite<br />sure of how many did that. But let me say this; I mean as<br />far as I'm concerned it's over. As you know I worked very<br />hard to get the opposite result so the decision's been made.<br />The new Secretary-General or the Secretary-General-elect of<br />the Commonwealth is the Chief. Now that's the important<br />thing and he's going to have my full, unqualified support.<br />Now that's the important thing.<br />JOURNALIST: Are you going to spell out those five points<br />this afternoon or can you spell them out now?<br />PM: I have done that today. The first thing is the<br />endorsement of the Harare Declaration. Secondly, the<br />continuation of existing trade sanctions. Third, the<br />intensification of financial measures. Fourth, the<br />establishment of a monitoring agency in the financial area.<br />And fifth, the appointment or the re-continuation, if I can<br />put it that way, of the monitoring mechanism generally which<br />is provided by the Foreign Ministers.<br />JOURNALIST: Do you expect to get any resistance to that,<br />particularly from Mrs Thatcher?</p>
<p>-4-<br />PM: I would hope that Mrs Thatcher would see substance in<br />the basic approaches I've put. It would be surprising if in<br />the area of sanctions she was at one with the rest on that.<br />But we'll see.<br />ends</p>
