SPEECH NOTES BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
PRIME MINISTER'S WELCOME LUNCH FOR MEMBERS OF<br />
THE CANBERRA COMMISSION, MONDAY 22 JANUARY 1996<br />
ADMIRALTY HOUSE, SYDNEY<br />
* May I begin by formally thanking each of you for accepting my invitation<br />
to join this Canberra Commission on the Elimination of Nuclear Weapons<br />
0 I am very conscious of how busy you are, and far you have come to<br />
participate in this meeting<br />
I am very grateful to you<br />
0 However, I am sure from your presence here that you all agree there can<br />
be few comimitments more worth making than this<br />
I would not have set up this Commiission or asked you to take part if I<br />
did not believe your combined efforts will1 be able to make a<br />
significant contribution to one of the most pressing issues facing the<br />
international community<br />
that is, how the world can remove the threat of nuclear weapons<br />
weapons of mass destruction so powerful that their use could<br />
destroy our civilization<br />
The Australian Government begins from what seems to us to be the<br />
unarguable proposition that the world would be a better, safer, saner<br />
place without such weapons<br />
that is, if they did not exist<br />
* But we have them and only three possibilities follow from that:<br />
first, that they will be used </p>
<p>second, that they will not be used but will be managed forever by<br />
wise, prudent and well-meaning governments and military forces<br />
or, third, that somehow we can agree to eliminate them<br />
* The first possibility offers catastrophe to the human race<br />
T he second requires us to make assumptions about the future which run<br />
completely counter to logic and experience<br />
-because if there is one thing of which we can be utterly confident, it<br />
is that the present relatively benign global situation in which only five<br />
countries have declared nuclear weapons, and are unlikely to use<br />
them offensively, will not obtain forever<br />
far more probable over time is the emergence of a more<br />
fractured, dangerous, world in which the restraints which have<br />
governed the strategic outlook since these weapons were<br />
invented no longer apply, and the possession of such weapons<br />
proliferates more generally to other states and possibly even<br />
beyond state control<br />
* That leaves only the third possibility<br />
that somehow we begin, with care and caution and a clear-eyed<br />
sense of all the difficulties it involves, to move to eliminate such<br />
weapons completely<br />
* That is a massively difficult task and the Australian Government is not<br />
naive about it<br />
we have no illusions about the technical difficulties of solving the<br />
central problems of verification<br />
and we acknowledge the political problems involved: uncertainty<br />
about the future and the accretion of fifty years of nuclear doctrine<br />
nor do we imagine that a world without nuclear weapons will be a<br />
world without conflict<br />
so serious issues of security also need to be addressed along<br />
with the technical and diplomatic issues </p>
<p>3<br />
So it is in pursuit of that third possibility,-what seemrs to us to be the<br />
only real option for the world that we have invited you to join this<br />
Commission Because if the aim of a world without nuclear weapons is ever to be<br />
realised the issue has to be placed more firmly and centrally on the<br />
international agenda<br />
if that does not happen, we will inevitably see the familiar<br />
allowed to drift unchallenged into the future<br />
so that objective to ensure that this issue is widely debated,<br />
and in depth Is one of the aims of this Commission<br />
But if that debate is to move ahead, the onus is on those favouring<br />
abolition to provide practical and serious ideas about how it can be done<br />
-and, most importantly, how it can be done in a way which actually<br />
enhances global security<br />
That Is the other reason for establishing the Commission<br />
It is why we have invited all of you from differentt backgrounds and<br />
different approaches to participate in it<br />
you bring to this task, collectively and individually, an unmatched<br />
experience in statesmanship, in nuclear and scientific issues, in<br />
diplomacy and in strategic analysis<br />
we are convinced that if any group can address these issues in a<br />
fresh, persuasive and unconventional way, it exists here in this room<br />
We are not looking for easy statements of principle in your report, or for<br />
words which are agreed for the sake of getting agreement<br />
* what we hope for is that you will come to grips with the hardest, and<br />
most intractable issues, and show how these must be addressed<br />
Many of you have spent much of your professional lives engaged with<br />
these Issues and I don't intend to offer you advice now about them<br />
But I do want to say something about " why now?" and " why here in<br />
Australia? </p>
<p>0 In Singapore last week, I gave a speech in which I said that it seemed to<br />
me that we were living through the greatest period of change in the<br />
world since the emergence of the nation state<br />
The end of the Cold War has freed up the global system in an<br />
unprecedented and unexpected way<br />
0 What comes next is very uncertain but it will not be uncertain for long<br />
0 Within a very short time, the world will adjust and settle into new<br />
grooves, from which it will be very difficult to dislodge it<br />
0 But for the time being we have an unparalleled opportunity and an<br />
unprecedented responsibility to look afresh at what have seemed to be<br />
intractable problems<br />
9 And, of these, possibly the most intractable has been the threat of<br />
nuclear weapons<br />
0 When the Cold War ended, most people in the world breathed a sigh of<br />
relief and assumed that the nightmare of the nuclear threat had<br />
disappeared along with the Berlin Wall<br />
-the strength of the international reaction to the French Government's<br />
decision to lift its moratorium on nuclear testing stemmed in large<br />
measure from this unexpected and unwelcome reminder of a danger<br />
which many people assumed had passed<br />
We in Australia believed it was important for all countries to focus<br />
attention not just on the symptom continued nuclear testing by France<br />
and China but on this larger cause<br />
Why should Australia be involved in an exercise like this?<br />
we are not a nuclear power<br />
we are geographically distant from the major areas of nuclear tension<br />
and we are an old and committed ally of the United Sates and have<br />
benefitted from the protection of extended deterrence<br />
The answer is that we are convinced that in the new international<br />
environment our security and the security of our friends, as well as the<br />
people of the world at large, will be better served if we can eliminate </p>
<p>nuclear weapons, as we have moved to eliminate other weapons of mass<br />
destruction<br />
9 Australia does not have any proprietorial or exclusive interest in nuclear<br />
disarmament or any preconceived outcome in mind from the deliberations of this<br />
group * because if progress is to be made and I believe it can be it will be<br />
by the combined and relentless efforts of many governments and<br />
groups and individuals<br />
-not just expressing by our hopes and fears, but by coming to grips<br />
rigorously with all the difficult issues involved<br />
1 am convinced the time is right and, of course, the people are right<br />
for the Canberra Commission to make a major intellectual and political<br />
contribution to this work<br />
6 Gareth Evans, personally, and the Australian Department of Foreign<br />
Affairs and Trade, including Ambassador Richard Butler, the convenor of<br />
this Commission, have a long record of achievement on global and<br />
regional arms control issues, Including their contribution to the<br />
conclusion of the Chemnical Weapons Convention and the work on the<br />
CTBT They will be ready, through your Secretariat, to give you whatever<br />
assistance you require<br />
a Let me end by again expressing my personal thanks to all of you for your<br />
participation in the Commission and let me welcome you formally to<br />
Australia<br />
ends. </p>
