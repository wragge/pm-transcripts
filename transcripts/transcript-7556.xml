PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF NEWS CONFERENCE, FLEMINGTON NEIGHBOURHOOD<br />
HOUSE, MELBOURNE, 5 APRIL 1989<br />
E O E PROOF ONLY<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke aren't your priorities slightly out of<br />
order in spending this money to have a public relations<br />
campaign when anyone who's ever tried to ring a refuge knows<br />
you can't get on the phone. Someone I know who works<br />
professionally with them said that she rang at 3.00 am<br />
because of this, and when only one in five women can get<br />
into refuges shouldn't you be building more refuges and<br />
providing the escape routes before doing the big public<br />
relations stunt?<br />
PM: I thought we were going to have a press conference not<br />
a public debate. But let me make the point that we have<br />
very substantially increased the funding for refuges in the<br />
period since we've been in office. They were first funded<br />
under the Whitlam Labor Government in ' 74. The funding was<br />
cut out at the Commonwealth Government level in 1981 by the<br />
Fraser Government. We reintroduced funding in 1983 and have<br />
successively increased the amount of funding and have<br />
commited a further substantial amount over the next 3 years.<br />
So it is not a question of what we're doing now, being in<br />
substitution for an increase in funding. The increase in<br />
funding has taken place, there's not a limitless amount of<br />
money available to Government but we have accorded a<br />
significant priority to it and it's a perverse assumption on<br />
your part and it would be rejected by 99.9% of the<br />
community that you shouldn't be undertaking a campaign, as<br />
I say, to break the silence.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke do you support an inquiry into the<br />
NSC? PM: We don't see a need at this stage for a Commonwealth<br />
inquiry, it's essentially a matter at a state level. But<br />
what I have done to try and ensure that at the Commowealth<br />
level we can do everything to be of assistance is that I<br />
wrote on Monday to about 7 or 8 Ministers who could in some<br />
way or another through their Departments or agency's for<br />
which they are responsible, have some connection with the<br />
NSC and have asked them to meet together and their<br />
Departments so that we can have a full understanding of what<br />
involvement there is at the national level with any of the<br />
operations of the NSC. And then I've spoken to Mr Cain and<br />
indicated to him that I'm doing that and that we'll<br />
make all information available that we've got to the<br />
Victorian authorities. Now that's the role that we have<br />
properly discharged, there's no need on any evidence </p>
<p>-2-<br />
( PM cont) available for the Commonwealth to be having an<br />
inquiry.<br />
JOURNALIST: The Democrats are supporting at the very least<br />
a Senate inquiry.<br />
PM: The Democrats by definition will support an inquiry<br />
into anything.<br />
JOURNALIST: On this issue here, does it disappoint you to<br />
learn that the Victorian Government for example has cut<br />
funding for child care workers when refuges like this so<br />
heavily depend on them?<br />
PM: Well I don't accept your assertion that the Victorian<br />
Government has overall cut funding for child care. I mean<br />
that hasn't been brought to my attention. I don't accept<br />
your assertion that it's done that.<br />
JOURNALIST: Workers are now preparing to strike.<br />
PM: Well that's another proposition. I don't accept your<br />
assertion that the Victorian Government has cut funds for<br />
child care. I don't accept your assertion.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke on the NSC are you satisfied that<br />
Australian security has not been compromised?<br />
PM: Yes I've already said that and so has Minister Beazley.<br />
I of course made an inquiry when this issue arose and I'm<br />
informed by the authorities that there is no security<br />
compromise or security connection. The allegations have you<br />
know ranged all over the place that there's a CIA connection<br />
and other connections. Well I am informed that there is no<br />
substance in those allegations. Now over here there was a<br />
question about child care. Let's be quite clear about child<br />
care as far as my Government is concerned. You won't get me<br />
on the back foot about child care, I'll be right<br />
aggressively on the front foot because no Government in the<br />
history of this country has come within a bull's roar of<br />
doing what we've done on child care. Let's get the facts<br />
and let's get them straight. Now since we've been in office<br />
we have created 64,000 new child care places. We have<br />
allocated funds for another 30,000 so that by the beginning<br />
of the 1990s there'll be 94,000 child care places which will<br />
involve what this. It will involve a trebling in our<br />
period of office of child care places. Now as I say that's<br />
the outlay by my Government in regard to child care places.<br />
It does more in our period of office than was ever done in<br />
the whole period of Government before we came of office in<br />
1983. So you won't get me on the back foot about child<br />
care. The rest of the political spectrum, the<br />
conservatives, need to hang their head in shame in terms of<br />
looking at what this Government has done and is committed to<br />
keep on doing in the future in regard to child care. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: This morning in The Age a Gallup Poll was<br />
published saying that the Liberals would've won the last<br />
federal election had one been held in mid March. What do<br />
you have to say about that?<br />
PM: I'm very happy about where we are at this stage. I<br />
mean if you look what we've been through with high interest<br />
rates, which we've had to bring in, the rather poor balance<br />
of payments figures, and the CPI figures<br />
JOURNALIST: What about the<br />
PM: Are we going to have a debate or are you going to ask<br />
me a question and I can answer it, ok. That's the usual<br />
rule. Now what I'm saying is that for them to be where they<br />
are now they should be very disappointed and if they were<br />
content as to where they are you wouldn't have the position<br />
which is in fact going on now of a determined effort to<br />
displace Mr Howard, which is what's underway at the moment.<br />
Now if they were content about where they were that wouldn't<br />
be what's happening. Now I'm simply saying to you we've had<br />
to do some tough things. No-one likes, no politician in his<br />
right mind likes having a tough, tight monetary policy but<br />
it's necessary. The national account figures which just<br />
came out at the beginning of this week show a very simple<br />
statistic, that there's been a 4% growth in production,<br />
we've had a 4% growth in GDP, but we've had an 8% growth in<br />
consumption. In other words we are importing to fill that<br />
gap and we're importing at a level which we can't sustain so<br />
we've got to bring back the level of activity. Now people<br />
don't like those sorts of things. Now even in that<br />
situation the Opposition is depending upon the preferences<br />
of the minor parties in this hypothetical election. The<br />
fact is that when we go to an election it won't be a<br />
hypothetical one, it will be the real thing and we will win.<br />
* JOURNALIST: The Poll also shows that your own popularity is<br />
slipping. PM: Well if we talk about my popularity against the other<br />
which is I haven't seen the figures today<br />
JOURNALIST: Down to 47.<br />
PM: Down to 47? What's Mr Howard's and what's the prefered<br />
Prime Minister's? Still a 3 to 1 ratio.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke with the situation in Namibia hotting<br />
up will you still be sending the 240 troops?<br />
PM: I will be going there this afternoon to Holsworthy<br />
to farewell them.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke the same question. There are reports<br />
that the Rules of Engagement for the troops in Namibia<br />
aren't sufficient and they could wind up being in danger.<br />
Are you concerned about that? </p>
<p>-4-<br />
PM: We have said and the Minister has said that this is no<br />
Sunday School picnic that our contingent is going to. It's<br />
a dangerous situation, not simply for the reasons you're<br />
referring to, but there are many mines that have been laid<br />
in the region where our fellas will be involved in defusing<br />
that position. So it is a dangerous situation. The<br />
previous Government which made the commitment and which<br />
we're honouring and are pleased to honour understood that<br />
it was a potentially dangerous situation.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke you've spoken gratefully of your<br />
wife's forebearance in your earlier exuberant times. Would<br />
you have been happy to extend to Hazel the same sexual<br />
freedom as you were able to enjoy?<br />
PM: Pass that one.<br />
JOURNALIST: On a local level Mr Hawke, the Greensborough<br />
by-election is coming up. There have been numerous debates<br />
between the two Leaders. The Liberal Party asserts that if<br />
it's a win for the Labor Party here that it's a vote of<br />
confidence in your Government's economic policies. The<br />
Labor Party asserts that if the Liberals win that it'll be a<br />
block of supply next in line. Does it concern you?<br />
PM: I'm not quite sure if I follow all that.<br />
JOURNALIST: The Liberals claim it's a vote of confidence in<br />
your policies if the labor Party wins.<br />
PM: Do they?<br />
JOURNALIST: Would you accept that as a vote of confidence?<br />
PM: Well I would've thought that the issues that are going<br />
to be involved in the Greensborough by-election are quite<br />
complex. I certainly don't take it as a vote of confidence<br />
one way or another in the economic policies of my<br />
Government. I simply believe that Mr Cain will win the<br />
by-election, I think he'll win it for a number of reasons.<br />
I would think that the person who's got to really worry most<br />
about the Greensborough by-election is a bloke called<br />
Kennett. ends </p>
