STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON. P. J. KEATING, MP<br />
RADIO STATION 2HD<br />
During Question Time I was asked a question about Senator<br />
Richardson's participation in a Cabinet decision in 1991<br />
regarding-radio licence fees which implied that Senator<br />
Richardson-had pecuniary-interests in conflict with his<br />
Ministerial responsibilities.<br />
The imputation is untrue.<br />
Sonator Richardson had no pecuniary interest as he was not<br />
paid for his directorship.<br />
The real issue is whether Cabinet colleagues were aware he<br />
was a director of 2HD and whether that directorship<br />
constituted a reason for Senator Richardson not to<br />
participate in any particular Cabinet discussion.<br />
Senator Richardson's directorship was common knowledge.<br />
In any case, according to Cabinet Office records Senator<br />
Richardson did not attend either the relevant ERC meeting or<br />
the Cabinet meeting that decided televison and radio licence<br />
fees. Senator Richardson has apologised to me for his oversight in<br />
not meeting the full technical requirements of declaration<br />
and I accept his apology.<br />
