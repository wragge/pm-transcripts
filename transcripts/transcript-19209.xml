    <content><![CDATA[<p>Beijing, People's Republic of China</p>
<p>The future of Australia and China's relationship has been strengthened with the launch today of new bilateral architecture following my meeting with the Chinese Premier Li Keqiang in Beijing.</p>
<p>Today's discussions with Premier Li were positive and constructive.</p>
<p>We discussed the full range of issues of common interest, including trade, finance and investment relations, regional and global cooperation, people-to-people links, regional security issues, human rights and consular matters.</p>
<p>The meeting was also attended by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Minister for Trade and Competitiveness and the Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation.</p>
<p>Today's meeting at Beijing's Great Hall of the People follows my discussions with President Xi Jinping at Bo'ao on April 7.</p>
<p>Today Australia and China have agreed to new bilateral architecture to guide the future of the relationship between our countries.</p>
<p>The Australian Prime Minister and the Premier of the People's Republic of China will meet annually to provide high-level leadership and strategic direction to the relationship.</p>
<p>To support the work of leaders, Premier Li and I also agreed to:</p>
<p>• An annual Foreign and Strategic Dialogue led by the Australian Minister for Foreign Affairs and China's Minister for Foreign Affairs; and</p>
<p>• An annual Strategic Economic Dialogue led on the Australian side by the Treasurer with the Minister for Trade and led on the Chinese side by the Chairman of China's National Development and Reform Commission.</p>
<p>The relationship will be described as a Strategic Partnership to reflect the importance both countries place on the relationship, its expanding scope and depth and the shared interests of both sides in a stable and peaceful Asian region.</p>
<p>In the Australia in the Asian Century White Paper, the Government committed itself to extending Australia's bilateral architecture with China through regular high-level meetings between leaders and senior ministers.</p>
<p>Today's launch of the Strategic Partnership delivers on this commitment. </p>
