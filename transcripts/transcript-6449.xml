TRANSCRIPT FORUM BRIEFING -27 AUGUST 1984 -TUVALU<br />
6. 00 P. PRIME MINISTER HAWKE<br />
P. M.<br />
WE CONTINUED OUR DISCUSSIONS OVER LUNCH ON THE NUCLEAR FREE ZONE<br />
PROPOSAL... ABOUT TESTING AND DUMPING. SOME OF THE STATES MADE IT<br />
CLEAR THAT THEIR POSITION WAS ONE OF WANTING TO BAN ALL INVOLVEMENT<br />
WITH NUCLEAR WEAPONS OR ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE NUCLEAR FUEL CYCLE<br />
BUT OTHERS AGREED, I THINK THE* MAJORITY AGREED, THAT ANY ZONE CONCEPT<br />
COULD ONLY BE ACCEPTABLE AND OPERATIVE IF IT LEAVES INDIVIDUALS<br />
COUNTRIES FREE TO MAKE THEIR OWN DECISIONS ABOUT THE QUESTION OF THE<br />
VISITS OF NUCLEAR ARMED AND NUCLEAR POWERED SHIPS AND THAT RIGHT,.<br />
WHICH I THINK YOU WILL ALL RECALL, WAS INTRINSIC TO THE PROPOSAL<br />
WHICH I PUT TO THE FORUM IN CANBERRA LAST YEAR, HAS BEEN ACCEPTED.<br />
THERE WAS SOME DISCUSSION ABOUT NOMENCLATURE, WHETHER IT SHOULD BE<br />
CALLED A SOUTH PACIFIC NUCLEAR FREE ZONE, THERE WAS ONE SUGGESTION<br />
THAT WE SHOULD BE TALKING ABOUT SOUTH PACIFIC NUCLEAR WEAPONS FREE<br />
ZONE BUT THAT WAS NOT ACCEPTED AND INDEED WAS NOT PROCEEDED WITH. THE<br />
QUESTION OF NOMENCLATURE IS, I THINK, RELATIVi-LY UNIMPORTANT BUT IT<br />
IS A MATTER THAT CAN BE DEALT WITH BY THE WORKING PARTY. ON THE<br />
QUESTION OF THE PACE OF FURTHER PROGRESS, ONE SUGGESTION WAS RAISED<br />
BY ONE MEMBER THAT THE UNITED NATIONS GENERAL ASSEMBLY MEETING, LATER<br />
THIS YEAR, SHOULD BE ASKED TO ENDORSE IN THIS YEAR, THE PROPOSAL<br />
THAT WAS NOT REALLY PROCEEDED WITH BECAUSE THE MORE GENERAL VIEW I<br />
THINK WAS, THAT IT MADE SENSE THAT 1WE IN THE REGION SHOULD DO MORE<br />
WORK ON THE PROPOSAL OURSELVES BUT THERE WAS AGREEMENT THAT THIS ./ 2 </p>
<p>RoOU. LD' OT BE 30METHING THAT E . SHOULD BE CASUAL ABOUTTHERE IS AN<br />
SACCEPtA'iCE F TRIE' IMPORTANC' OF' fR'OCEEtING" EXPEiTlTI'OU'SY';" CERTAI'LYC<br />
FO ' A. 5UPSE* TARK. ALN* tIGA W LL Dg' A-L . T WATE-T i BY . TlE<br />
PR'' ISIO' OC ASSISTAICE 2UT FY OUR Ci; iN IMFUT, 0 ECNSUE: THAT THE<br />
MATTER IS PROCEEDED lWITH EXPEDITIOUSLY. IT HOULD BE A HOPE, I SUPPOSE<br />
THIS IS AN OPTIMUM POSITION, THAT OUT OF THE WORK OF THE OFFICIALS<br />
THAT WE MAY BE IN A POSITION ACTUALLY TO PRESENT A DRAFT TREATY BY<br />
THE 1985 FORUM WHETHER THAT WILL BE POSSIBLE, OF COURSE, REMAINS TO<br />
BE SEEN OUT OF THE WORK THAT WE DO BUT I THINK YOU CAN SEE THAT THE<br />
ATTITUDE THAT WAS ADOPTED THAT BEFORE WE REALLY INTRUDE FURTHER OUR<br />
CONCEPT INTO'INTERNATIONAL FORUMS' PARTrCULARLY-THE'UNITED NATIONS.-<br />
GENERAL ASSEMBLY, IT MADE SENSE THAT WE DO MORE OF OUR OWN WORK. I<br />
COULD SAY BY WAY OF BROAD CONTEXT, THAT THE SENSE OF URGENCY HOWEVER<br />
IN GETTING OUR OWN HORK DONE, WAS AGREEMENT THAT THE INTERNATIONAL<br />
ENVIRONMENT HAD DETERIORATED, I HAVE MADE REFERENCE AND MADE<br />
PROVISION TO THE BREAKDOWN OF THE START AND INF AND THE STAND OFF<br />
SITUATION WHICH DEVELOPED BETWEEN THE SUHERPOWERS AND I BELIEVE THAT<br />
THERE WAS GENERAL AGREEMENT THAT IN THIS SITUATION WHERE THE<br />
TRADITIONAL FORA FOR PROCESSING HOVES TOWARDS REDUCTION IN ARMAMENTS,<br />
PARTICULARLY NUCLEAR ARMAMENTS, HAD SOMEWHAT BROKEN DOWN. IT WAS THAT<br />
MUCH MORE IMPORTANT THAT WE IN THIS REGION SHOULD DO . WHAT WE COULD TO<br />
PROGRESS OUR WORK SO THAT WE COULD PUT TO THE WORLD OUR CONCERN ON<br />
THIS ISSUE. THERE WAS AN UNDERSTANDING IN THE DISCUSSION OF THE FACT<br />
OF INTERNATIONAL FREEDOM OF TRANSIT ON THE HIGH SEAS AND THAT, OF<br />
COURSE, WAS ALSO A POSITION WHICH WE FROM AUSTRALIA HAD MADE CLEAR IN<br />
FIRST PUTTING THIS POSITION BEFORE THE FORUM IN 1983. THERE WAS<br />
REFERENCE TO THE PAPER WHICH WAS PRESENTED TO THE FORUM BY NAURU ON<br />
THE QUESTION OF DUMPING. THEY HAVE SHOUN, WITH KIRIBATI, A PARTICULAR<br />
INTEREST AND INVOLVEMENT IN THAT ASPECT OF NUCLEAR CONCERN AND THERE<br />
WAS A REFLECTION OF THE CONCERN AT THE LACK OF PROGRESS IN<br />
COMMITMENTS BY THE METROPOLITAN POWERS. SO ON THIS QUESTION OF<br />
DUMPING AND WE WILL PICK UP THE PAPER BY NAURU AND KIRIBATI AND THE<br />
PROPOSAL TO AMEND THE LONDON DUMPING CONVENTION, THAT HILL BE A<br />
MATTER THAT WILL BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT IN THE WORK OF THE STUDY GROUP<br />
BECAUSE IT WAS RECOGNISED AS A USEFUL PAPER. MAY I ALSO PICK OUT ONE<br />
OR TWO OTHER POINTS THAT WERE TOUCHED UPON. THERE WAS REFERENCE TO<br />
THE SCIENTIFIC PARTY, WHICH IN THE LATTER PART OF LAST YEAR, YOU WILL<br />
RECALL, HAD GONE TO MORUROA AND WHILE FORUM MEMBERS INDICATED THAT<br />
THERE WAS SOME RECOGNITION IN THAT REPORT, THAT THE EXTENT OF<br />
ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERN MAY NOT NEED TO BE, IN ALL ITS RESPECT, AS<br />
LARGE AS PERHAPS HAD BEEN THOUGHT BEFORE, NEVERTHELESS THAT REPORT<br />
COULD NOT LEAVE ONE WITH ANY SENSE OF COMPLACENCY AND IN<br />
ACKNOWLEDGING THE REPORT WE UNANIMOUSLY INDICATED THAT IT IN NO WAY<br />
DIMINISHED THE OPPOSITION OF ALL FORUM MEMBERS TO THE CONTINUATION OF<br />
NUCLEAR TESTING BY FRANCE. WE ALSO WELCOMED, AND THAT WILL BE<br />
REFLECTED IN THE COMMUNIQUE, THE STATEMENT BY THE LATIN AMERICAN<br />
PERMAMENT COMMISSION FOR THE SOUTH PACIFIC, THAT CONSISTS OF CHILE,<br />
COLUMBIA, ECQUADOR AND PERU, ALL COUNTRIES WHO RECENTLY ISSUED, I<br />
THINK IT WAS ON THE 6TH OF JULY, A CONDEMNATION OF FRENCH NUCLEAR<br />
TESTING IN THE PACIFIC. AND ONE OTHER POINT WHICH I THINK AROSE IN<br />
THIS DISCUSSION, WHICH SHOULD BE NOTED, WAS A SUGGESTION FROM THE </p>
<p>, PRIME MINISTER . OF.. HESTEPN S, OA-THAT IN. ADDIT-ONJ TO THE STAjFeENTS..<br />
" TH L i-A'l' r T' U I , U FLECTI! IG THOSE i! ATTESr<br />
WHICH I BAV TOLD YOU ", DOUT TC7A), Y, AND IIA' DDITION' TO THAT HE<br />
SUGGESTED THAT ALL FORUM MEKBERS SHOULD IN FtCT WRITE TO THE<br />
GOVERNMENT OF FRANCE ON THE QUESTION OF NUCLEAR TESTING AND OPPOSE<br />
IT. AND THIS WILL BE DONE, I BELIEVE, BY MEMBERS INDIVIDUALLY AS WAS<br />
ALSO THE SUGGESTION FROM THE PRIME MINISTER OF WESTERN SAMOA, THAT<br />
LETTERS SHOULD ALSO BE WRITTEN TO THE JAPANESE GOVERNMENT INDICATING<br />
OUR CONCERN ABOUT THE POSSIBLE PROPOSALS IN REGARD TO NUCLEAR<br />
DUMPING. THAT DISCUSSION OCCUPIED THE GREATER PART OF THIS AFTERNOON.<br />
WE GOT ON AT THE VERY LATTER STAGE TO REPORTS ON THE QUESTION OF THE<br />
POSSIBILITY OF A SINGLE REGIONAL ORCANISATION, BUT I REALLY HAVE<br />
NOTHING TO REPORT TO YOU ON THAT. THERE WAS A COMMITTEE ESTABLISHED<br />
ON THE LAST OCCASION TO LOOK AT THIS ISSUE THAT IS THE RELATIONSHIP<br />
BETWEEN THE SOUTH PACIFIC COMMISSION AND THE FORUM. BUT THAT<br />
COMMITTEE HAD NOT HAD THE OPPORTUNITY OF DOING ANY SUBSTANTIAL WORK<br />
ON THAT SO THERE'S NOTHING TO PUT FORWARD ON IT. AND WE AT THE END<br />
WERE ON THE ISSUE OF REGIONAL CO-OPERATION AS IT AFFECTS SMALLER<br />
FORUM MEMBERS. BUT THAT HASN'T COME TO A CONCLUSION. THAT, LADIES AND<br />
GENTLEMEN, IS A COVERAGE OF WHAT HAPPENED THIS AFTERNOON.<br />
JOURNALIST: MR HAWKE, SIR, SOME OF US HAVEN'T SEEN THE AUSTRALIAN<br />
PROPOSALS WHICH HAVE BEEN PUT TO THIS MEETING. DO THEY VARY FROM THE<br />
CANBERRA COMMUNIQUE GREATLY, OR WOULD IT BE POSSIBLE TO MAKE THEM<br />
PUBLIC. I'LL LOOK AT THAT. THEY ARE THE PROPERTY OF THE FORUM, BUT<br />
SPEAKING FOR MYSELF I DON'T SEE ANY REASON WHY THEY SHOULDN'T BE AND<br />
I'LL MAKE ENQUIRIES ABOUT IT.<br />
JOURNALIST: DID ANY FORUM MEMBERS EXPRESS ANY CONCERN ABOUT THEIR<br />
DEFENCE OR SECURITY IN THE EVENT OF A TOTAL, A PROPER, NUCLEAR FREE<br />
ZONE WITH NO WARSHIPS IN IT AT ALL BEING INTRODUCED.<br />
NO, THERE WAS NO SPECIFIC REFERENCE TO THAT BUT I THINK THERE<br />
WAS IMPLICIT IN THE CONTRIBUTION PERHAPS OF ONE OR TWO MEMBERS OF THE<br />
VIEW THAT THEY HAD TO RETAIN THE RIGHT AND INTENDED TO RETAIN THE<br />
RIGHT TO HAVE VISITS OF NUCLEAR-POWERED AND NUCLEAR-ARMED SHIPS TO<br />
THEIR PORTS. AND SO I GUESS INFERENTIALLY THAI DID ENTAIL A JUDGEHENI<br />
ON THEIR PART THAT THEY BELIEVED THAT IT WAS APPROPRIATE TO THEIR<br />
PERCEPTIONS OF DEFENCE AND STRATEGIC CONSIDERATIONS THAT THEY SHOULD<br />
BE ALLOWED TO DO THAT.<br />
JOURNALIST: HOW MANY COUNTRIES INTEND NOW THAT WE'VE GOT A NUCLEAR<br />
FREE ZONE TO HAVE VISITS OF NUCLEAR-ARMED OR POWERED SHIPS.<br />
P. M. WELL, LET HE REFER TO THOSE TWO WHO HAVE THEM, WHO HAVE<br />
INDICATED THAT THEY HAVE THEM, AND WOULD REGARD IT IS APPROPRIATEAUSTRALIA<br />
HAS IT, FIJI DOES AND I THINK IT WAS CLEAR FROM THE<br />
CONTRIBUTION OF TONGA THAT THEY WOULD PUT THEMSELVES IN THAT<br />
CATEGORY. ON THE OTHER HAND VANUATU, FOR INSTANCE-THIS IS NOT ./ 4 </p>
<p>S REFLECTING ANY PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL DISCUSSIO} J BECAUSE THEY HAVE<br />
, H. 1DE A D. CISION O-DÅ“ CL " TTk'' T " SELVES-' A" TOTAL. N"' JLEA". FrE'Z i"<br />
SO THEY i'. OULDN ' T HAVE NUCLEAR-POisNED VISITS THicERE, NUCLEAR FO'c-. ES'-ED<br />
SHIP VISITS.<br />
JOURNALIST: MR HAWKE WAS THERE ANY SUPPORT FOR THE PROPOSITION THAT<br />
THE MATTER BE RAISED AT THE UNITED NATIONS GENERAL ASSEMBLY OR IT WAS<br />
IT JUST ONE VOICE.<br />
ESSENTIALLY ONE VOICE BUT IT WAS NOT PROCEEDED WITH.<br />
JOURNALIST: DID MR LANGE EXPLAIN TO THE FORUM WHY HE WASN'T WANTED<br />
TO RAISE IT WITH THE U. N.<br />
P. M. WELL I THINK THE VIEW OF NEW ZEALAND WAS THAT THIS MAY GIVE<br />
SOME SORT OF IMPETUS, BUT I THINK THERE CAME TO BE AN ACCEPTANCE OF<br />
THE VIEW THAT IT MADE , MORE SENSE FOR US TO DO THE WORK. I MEAN THERE<br />
ARE SOME QUITE SPECIFIC MATTERS THAT NEED TO BE ADDRESSED. WITHOUT<br />
GOING INTO THEM ALL, ONE OBVIOUS ELEMENT IS THE QUESTION OF THE<br />
GEOGRAPHICAL LIMITS OF THE ZONE THAT WOULD BE ENVISAGED. THERE MAY<br />
BE SOME DIFFERENCES OF VIEW ABOUT THAT SO, WlE CAME TO THE VIEW, I<br />
THINK, THAT IT MAKES MORE SENSE TO CLARIFY PRECISELY THE SORTS OF<br />
THINGS THAT HE HAVE IN MIND, AND THAT YOU ARE MORE LIKELY TO GET THE<br />
OPPORTUNITY OF MAXIMISING SUPPORT WITHIN THE UNITED NATIONS ONCE WE<br />
HAD DONE OUR WORK. BUT LET ME BE FAIR, TOTALLY, TO NEW ZEALAND IN<br />
THIS MATTER THAT THEY WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE IMPETUS WASN'T<br />
LOST. AND THAT IS A VIEW THAT IS SHARED, CERTAINLY BY AUSTRALIA AS<br />
THE SPONSOR OF THIS CONCEPT. AND WE HAVE MADE IT CLEAR THAT ME WILL<br />
EVERYTHING TO FACILITATE, NOT MERELY BY FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE, BUT IN<br />
TERMS OF INPUT, TO ENSURE THAT THIS WORKING PARTY NOW IS AN<br />
EFFECTIVE, FUNCTIONAL ORGANISATION.<br />
JOURNALIST: PRIME MINISTER, IN YOUR OWN OPINION, AND PERHAPS ON A<br />
SCALE OF TEN, HOW NUCLEAR FREE IS A ZONE THAT ALLOWS THE TRANSIT OF<br />
NUCLEAR ARMED WARSHIPS.<br />
P. M. WELL, IT IS AS A ZONE, I THINK, TOTALLY FREE. IF YOU LOOK AT<br />
THE RECORD OF OPERATION OF THE UNITED STATES VESSELS, FOR INSTANCE,<br />
AND I HAVEN'T BEEN TAKEN INTO THE CONFIDENCE OF THE SOVIET UNION SO I<br />
CAN'T SPEAK IN RESPECT OF THAT SUPERPOWER. IF YOU LOOK AT THE UNITED<br />
STATES THEY HAVE A VERY LARGE NUMBER OF, I DON'T KNOW THE PRECISE<br />
NUMBER, BUT HELL OVER ONE HUNDRED NUCLEAR POWERED VESSELS TRAVELLED<br />
THE EQUIVALENT OF VERY MANY MILLIONS OF MILES, HAVE BEEN INTO ABOUT<br />
150 PORTS IN 50 COUNTRIES AND WITHOUT ANY ACCIDENT OR SEEPAGE OF<br />
MATERIAL. NON THE FACT THAT VESSELS HAD THAT RECORD MILL BE<br />
TRAVERSING THE AREA AND BY THE DECISION OF AU10NOMOUS SOVEREIGN<br />
COUNTRIES MAY IN FACT VISIT THEIR PORTS DOESN'T DIMINISH THEREFORE, I<br />
BELIEVE, IN ANY SIGNIFICANT WAY FROM THE CO;' CEPT WHICH IS THAT WE ARE<br />
SAYING THAT IW'E AS NATIONS WILL NOT ACQUIRE NUCLEAR WEAPONS, WE WILL<br />
NOT MANUFACTURE THEM, WE ARE OPPOSED TO THE TESTING OF WEAPONS IN THE<br />
REGION AND TO THE DUMPING OF NUCLEAR WASTE. SO YOU WOULD HAVE TO BE a </p>
<p>A PPETTY P! tL2VERS: AN' CATII/ r SEE* KER P. FTEYP F,-iCTS TO S U GE.. S'T T HA T.'<br />
TrHAT : IYBA OF: TAE Ri CHT OF TR~ ANSIT ON THE HIGH SrEA'S IE', VOLVED<br />
ANY DIMINUTION AN EFFECTIVE CONCEPT.<br />
JOURNALIST: PRIME MINISTER, IS THIS RESOLUTION ON NUCLEAR FREE ZONES<br />
IN FACT AIMED PRIMARILY AGAINST FRA. NCE AND NOT PARTICULARLY AT THE<br />
AMERICAN FLEET. AND IF THAT IS THE CASE COULD THERE BE A REACTION<br />
FROM FRANCE THAT WOULD EFFECT THE FORUM'S ABILITY TO EXERT PRESSURE<br />
ON FRANCE FOR TH4E MORE SPEEDY INDEPENDENCE -FOR NEW4 CALEDONIA.<br />
P. 14. : NO I DON'T SEE THE TWO THINGS AS LINKED BUT LET ME REPEAT THE<br />
POINT THAT I THINK I MADE WHEN I ARRIVED HERE YiESTERDAY WHEN SO. ME OF<br />
OUR AUSTRALIAN JOURNALISTS QUESTIONED ME. WE DON'T DELUDE O* JRSELVES<br />
THAT THE PURSUIT OF OR EVEN THE EARLY ACHIEVEMEN4T OF A NUCLEAR FREE<br />
ZONE CONCEPT BY THE COUNTRIES OF THIS REGION WOULD OF ITSELF FORCE<br />
FRANCE TO STOP ITS TESTING. WE WOULD BE POLITICALLY NAIVE TO BELIEVE<br />
THAT THAT RESULT WOULD FOLLOW. I THINK IN THESE SORTS OF THINGS ITS<br />
A QUESTION OF AN ACCUMULATION OF PRESSURES, EXPRESSIONS OF VIEW. I<br />
MEAN I GO BACK AS YOUR AUSTRALIAN COLLEAGUES IN THE PRESS WOULD<br />
RECALL TO THE POINT I MADE IN REGARD TO THE FRENCH ATMOSPHERIC<br />
NUCLEAR TESTING WHEN WE TOOK UP THE CAMPAIGN AGAINST THAT IN THE<br />
EARLY 1970' S IT WAS PUT TO US THAT THIS W4AS PRETTY POINTLESS. BUT<br />
THERE IS SOME EVIDENCE THAT THE ACTION lWE TOOK THERE ACCELERATED THE<br />
DECISION OF THE FRENCH TO STOP ATMOSPHERIC TESTING AND TO GO<br />
UNDERGROUND. NOW I MERELY SEE THE ACHIEVEMENT OF A NUCLEAR FREE ZONE<br />
CONCEPT BY THE COUNTRIES OF THE REGION AS ONE ELEMENT OF THE<br />
PRESSURE. AND GOING TO THE SECOND PART OF YOUR QUESTION ABOUT THE<br />
REACTION OF FRANCE TO THIS PROCESS, TO WHAT THEY WOULD DO ABOUT NEW<br />
CALEDONIA, I THINK THAT'S A QUITE ERRONEOUS ASSUMPTION BECAUSE YOU<br />
WILL-RECALL THAT I HAVE SAID, AND I THINK IT'S A VIEW SUBSTANTIALLY<br />
SHARED BY ALL MEMBERS OF THE FORUM, THAT WE DON'T REALLY QUESTION THE<br />
INTEGRITY OR INTENTION OF FRANCE ABOUT WANTING TO SEE INDEPENDENCE<br />
FOR NEW4 CALEDONIA. RATHER THEY DO HAVE APPREH4ENSIONS ABOUT WHAT MAY<br />
BE THE OUTCOME THERE OF A TOO EARLY GRANTING OF INDEPENDENCE. BUT WE<br />
NEVERTHELESS TAKE THE VIEW TH4AT THERE SHOULD BE AN ACCELERATION OF<br />
THE MOVE IN THAT DIRECTION. NOW 1 THINK FRANCE WILL UNDERSTAND THE<br />
VIEWS T1HAT W4EH OLD ON THAT AND THE INTEGRITY IN TURN WITH WHICH WE<br />
HOLD OUR VIEWS. AND I WOULD NOT IMAGINE IN ANY WAY THAT THERE'LL BE<br />
ANY RELATION BY FRANCE IN ANY REACTIVE WAY OF WHAT WE' RE SAYING ABOUT<br />
A NUCLEAR FREE ZONE AND WHAT THEY WOULD DO IN THAT AREA OF THEIR<br />
RESPONSIBILITY.<br />
JOURNALIST: PRIME MINISTER, DO YOU ACCEPT THAT BECAUSE NUCLEAR<br />
WEAPONS IN TRANSIT ARE INSTANTLY DEPLOYABLE THAT THEREFORE TH4EY<br />
SHOULD BE REGARDED AS PERMANENTLY DEPLOYABLE.<br />
P. WELL THEY ARE PERMANENTLY DEPLOYABLE BUT I'M TRYING MY BEST TO<br />
FOLLOW4 THROUGH WHAT'S INVOLVED IN YOUR QUESTION.<br />
JOURNALIST: I SUPPOSE IT COMES BACK.. ./ 6 </p>
<p>M. COULD. YQL TELL . ME HAT.. THE P. OI I. q. O YOUR.. Q, E. STI. O<br />
I 0N'T QUITE FOLLO IT.<br />
JOURNALIST: I SUPPOSE IT CO; MES DACK TO VWHAT SCT OF SANCTITY IN A<br />
NUCLEAR FREE ZONE WHICH ALLO4S TRANSIT.<br />
WELL THIS QUESTION OF SANCTITY WHAT YOU'VE GOT TO UNDERSTAND<br />
IS THAT THE CONCEPT OF NUCLEAR FREE ZONE IS NOT SIMPLY ABOUT THE<br />
TRANSIT OF WEAPONS WITHIN IT. IT INVOLVES AN UNDERTAKING ON THE<br />
PART OF THE COUNTRIES PARTY TO THAT TREATY THAT THEY WILL NOT<br />
MANUFACTURE OR ACQUIRE OR STORE NUCLEAR WEAPONS. NOW THAT'S<br />
IMPORTANT IN ITSELF IF A SIGNIFICANT SECTION OF THE COUNTRIES OF<br />
THE WIORLD MAKE THAT COMMITMENT SO THAT'S IMPORTANT. SECONDLY, THEY<br />
INDICATE THAT THEY ARE OPPOSED TO AND WILL USE WHAT POWERS THEY HAVE<br />
TO STOP THE DUMPING OF NUCLEAR ' WASTE MATERIAL IN THEIR REGION. SO<br />
THAT HAS ITS IMPORTANCE. NOW1 THOSE THINGS HAVE AN INTRINSIC LIFE AND<br />
REALITY OF THEIR OWN. IT JUST SEEMS TO HE, IF I MAY SAY SO IN MY<br />
NORMAL GENTLE FORM, THAT IF YOU'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO LIGHT UPON<br />
ONE ASPECT THAT IS THAT THIS CONCEPT IS CONSISTENT, AS I. T MUST BE,<br />
WITH THE RIGHT OF TRANSIT ON THE HIGH SEAS AND SAY THAT MEANS THERE<br />
IS NO REALITY IN THE CONCEPT. ALL THAT REVEALS IS NOT SOMETHING<br />
ABOUT THE CONCEPT BUT SO! METHING ABOUT YOUR ATTITUDE TO IT.<br />
JOURNALIST: PRIME MINISTER IF THE FORUM COMES UP AND FINALLY ACCEPTS<br />
THIS RESOLUTION WHAT WOULD THE POSITION IF THE MICRONESIAN STATES,<br />
WHICH MAY BE OBLIGED TO HOST AMERICAN NUCLEAR DUMPS, WILL THEY BE<br />
ABLE TO JOIN THE FORUM OR WOULD THEY . BE<br />
WELL THERE IS TWO POINTS ABOUT THAT OF COURSE. YOU APPRECIATE<br />
THAT THEY ARE NOT FULL MEMBERS OF THE FORUM BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT<br />
CONSTITUTIONALLY SOVEREIGN INDEPENDENT NATIONS. THEY HAVE THE RIGHT<br />
OF OBSERVER STATUS BUT AS SOON AS YOU'VE SAID THAT YOU'VE ANSWERED<br />
YOUR QUESTION IN TERMS THAT THEY ARE NOT SOVEREIGN INDEPENDENT<br />
NATIONS, THEY HAVE A CONSTITUTIONAL RELATIONSHIP WITH ANOTHER<br />
METROPOLITAN POWER THEN THERE IS THE ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION. THAT<br />
DOESN'T MEAN THAT THEY WILL NOT BE ABLE TO HAVE AN INTEREST IN THE<br />
WORK OF THE FORUM MEMBERS ON THIS AND THEY MAY WELL EXPRESS A VIEW<br />
THAT THEY DON'T HAVE THE CAPACITY BY DEFINITION THAT A SOVEREIGN<br />
INDEPENDENT NATION HAS.<br />
JOURNALIST: SOME OF THEM SEEM TO BE MAKING OVERTURES TO JOIN THE<br />
FORUM WHEN THEY GET A DEGREE OF INDEPENDENCE WHICH WOULD PERMIT THEM.<br />
WOULD YOU DENY THEM MEMBERSHIP BECAUSE THEY MAY HAVE NUCLEAR<br />
FACILITIES ON THEIR TERRITORY.<br />
NO, THE POSSIBILITY OF BECOMING FULL MEMBERS OF THE FORUM ONLY<br />
ARISES WHEN THEY ARE FULLY SOVEREIGN INDEPENDENT NATIONS AND WE DON'T<br />
KNOW WHAT THE POSITION WOULD BE IN THEIR COUNTRIES WHEN THAT POSITION<br />
ARRIVES. SO MY AUSTRALIAN COLLEAGUES WILL TELL YOU THAT I'M NOT<br />
PRONE TO ANSWERING HYPOTHETICAL QUESTIONS. / 7 </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: MR HIAINKE 00 YOU ARGUE TIAT THE NUCL. AR FREE ZONE IILL<br />
A SIGI; IFICANT CO'FiUTR UTIONI TO NUCLEAR NO:-? ROLIFERA ' IOu,' IF<br />
0SOW ILL IT DO IT JUST BY POSITIVE EXAMPLE OR THROUGH SOME OTHER ; ORE<br />
CONCRETE WAYS.<br />
P. M. ELL ONCE YOU GET INTO THE AREA, THIS BORDER AREA, OF NUCLEAR<br />
NON-PROLIFERATION YOU KNOW THAT NEXT YEAR IN 1985 IS THE REVIEWl YEAR<br />
FOR THE NPT TREATY. AUSTRALIA HAS A VERY FIRM VIEW ABOUT THE<br />
IMPORTANCE OF THAT INSTRUMENT IT'S BEEN REALLY THE ONLY INSTRUMENT<br />
IN EXISTENCE WHICH OFFERS A BASIS FOR PREVENTING THE PROLIFERATION OF<br />
NUCLEAR WEAPONRY. NOW ALL I CAN SAY THEREFORE IN RELATION TO THAT<br />
QUESTION IS THAT I'Il NOT ONE FOR OVERSTATING WHAT CAN BE DONE IN THE<br />
INTERNATIONAL ARENA. IF YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT INTERNATIONAL<br />
RELATIONS YOU KNOW THAT IT'S FOOLISH TO OVERSTATE THE POSSIBILITY OF<br />
INITIATIVES. I THINK WHAT YOU CAN SAY ABOUT IT IS THAT, THAT THERE<br />
IS GOING TO BE AS YOU LEAD UP TO THE NPT REVIEW TREATY NEXT YEAR THAT<br />
ATTEMPTS BY MANY OF US TO TRY AND GET AN UNDERSTANDING ON THE PART<br />
BOTH OF SIGNATORIES TO THE NPT AND OTHERS WHO HAVEN'T YET SIGNED IT<br />
OF THE NECESSITY OF TRYING TO MAKE THE BASIC CONTRACT WHICH UNDERLIES<br />
THE NPT WORK. AND IT IS ON THE ONE HAND THAT THE NUCLEAR WEAPON<br />
STATES SHOULD NOT INCREASE THEIR WEAPON CAPABILITY BUT SHOULD MOVE TO<br />
A REDUCTION OF IT AND IN RETURN FOR THEM HONOURING THAT PART OF THE<br />
CONTRACT THEN NON-NUCLEAR WEAPON STATES SHOULD DECLINE THEMSELVES TO<br />
HOVE TOWARDS THE ACQUISITION OF WEAPONS. SO THEREFORE MAKE IN<br />
RESPECT TO YOUR QUESTION I WOULD SAY THAT TO THE EXTENT THAT WE GOT A<br />
NUMBER OF STATES IN THIS REGION WHO IN A SENSE FORMALISED THEIR<br />
COMMITMENT TO THE NON-ACQUISITION OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS, THAT WOULD BE<br />
SOMETHING. THE PROCESS TOWARDS THAT WOULD BE PART OF THE ARGUMENT<br />
THAT ONE COULD USE ABOUT A COMMITMENT IN REGARD TO A SIGNIFICANT<br />
NUMBER OF STATES IN THIS REGION TO TRY AND MAKE THAT CONTRACT WORK.<br />
NOW I DON'T WANT TO OVERSTATE, IT'S NOT GOING TO DO MORE THAN THAT I<br />
THINK. JOURNALIST: PRIME MINISTER YOU TALK ABOUT THE TALKS ABOUT THE<br />
GEOGRAPHICAL EXTENT OF A POSSIBLE NUCLEAR FREE ZONE. ARE WE TALKING<br />
ABOUT OR CAN WE TALK ABOUT ANYTHING OTHER THAN THE ECONOMIC ZONES OF<br />
EACH INDIVIDUAL STATE PUT TOGETHER. IF SO WHAT CAN WE SAY..<br />
I DON'T THINK WE CAN TALK ABOUT IN A STRICT LEGAL SENSE MORE<br />
THAN AREA EZ'S. BUT THERE'S MORE TO IT THAN THAT I THINK IT'S A<br />
QUESTION OF NOMENCLATURE. YOU SEE THERE'S BEEN A TENDENCY TO TALK<br />
ABOUT THE SOUTH PACIFIC NUCLEAR FREE ZONE. WELL ONCE YOU GET UP INTO<br />
SOME OF THE AREAS IN WHICH OUR MEMBERS OF THE FORUM ARE INVOLVED<br />
WE'RE SPEAKING OF WHETHER YOU ACCURATELY DESCRIBING IT IN TERMS OF<br />
THE SOUTH PACIFIC NUCLEAR FREE ZONE, THAT IS REALLY THE CONCEPT THAT<br />
IS INVOLVED.<br />
JOURNALIST: MR HAWKE IS THERE A FEELING AMONG SOME OF THE FORUM<br />
COUNTRIES THAT A NUCLEAR FREE ZONE FOR THEM AS A MEANS OF WEAKING OF<br />
ANZUS. 8 </p>
<p>P. M. NO. THERE'S ONLY TWO OF US IN THE FORUM WHO ARE , EMBES OF<br />
AN'ZUS NEH. ZE/.. LiA D A;, D OURSELVES. AN D ' 17 1 LiA,.. AiD ITTESASC<br />
CO1MITMENT TO ANZUS AND HE, THAT IS AUSTRALIA, IHEN W,. 4REA ISED THE<br />
CONCEPT FOR THE FIRST TI", E LAST YEAR MADE IT CLEiPR THEN', A POINT<br />
WHICH WHICH ESCAPED A COUPLE COMME, NITATORS IN AUSTRALIA I MIGHT SAY,<br />
BUT NEVERTHELESS WE MADE IT CLEAR IN CANBERRA LAST YEAR THAT<br />
INTRINSIC TO THE PROPOSAL WAS THE RIGHT OF INDIVIDUAL NEMBERS OF THE<br />
FORUM TO MAKE THEIR DECISION ABOUT THE VISIT OR 4Oi-VISIT OF NUCLEAR<br />
POWERED AND NUCLEAR ARMED VESSELS. SO AS THE PRIHE MINISTER OF NEW<br />
ZEALAND MADE CLEAR TODAY THE QUESTION OF THE RIGHT OF IIDIVIDUAL<br />
STATES IS SACROSANCT AND WHAT NEW ZEALAND DID OR DID NOT IN THE EVENT<br />
FINALLY DO ABOUT THAT ISSUE WAS A MATTER INDEPENDENT OF THIS..<br />
JOURNALIST: DID ANYONE DISPUTE THAT RIGHT BEING SACROSANCT?<br />
P. M. 1 NO.<br />
JOURNALIST: WHEN THE DRAFT PROPOSALS PUT WIERE THERE ANY AMENDMENTS<br />
PUT AT ALL?<br />
P. M. NO WELL THE WAY THE FORUM IS OPERATED, WHICH I THINK IS A VERY<br />
SENSIBLE ONE, IT THAT YOU HAVE A BASIS OF DISCUSSION. THE AUSTRALIAN<br />
PAPER FORMED THAT. THERE WERE SOME DRAFT AMENDMENTS CIRCULATED BUT<br />
THERE WAS NOT VOTE ON THE RESOLUTION OR ON THE AMENDMENTS. AS I'VE<br />
PUT IT TO YOU IS HOW IT TRANSPIRED AND I THINK THAT PROVIDED A BASIS<br />
WHICH WAS CERTAINLY TOTALLY SATISFACTORY TO US FOR THE WORK NO1J OF<br />
THIS WORKING PARTY TO PROCEED ON IT. BUT THERE WAS NO VOTE.<br />
JOURNALIST: WERE SOME OF THOSE AMENDMENTS ACCEPTED BY<br />
NO REALLY THEY WEREN'T PURSUED. TO GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE, THfE<br />
QUESTION OF NOMENCLATURE AND THE SUGGESTION THAT THE WORK WEAPONS BE<br />
INCLUDED, WELL THAT WAS FLOATED BUT NOT PURSUED. ON THE QUESTION OF<br />
GOING TO THE UNITED NATIONS, WELL THAT AGAIN WAS FLOATED BUT IN THE<br />
DEBATE THAT FOLLOWED IT WAS THEN NOT PURSUED.<br />
JOURNALIST: WERE TH4ERE ANY OTHERS?<br />
P. M. WELL THE ISSUES THAT ARE RELEVANT ARE THE QUESTION OF THE<br />
INCLUSION OF EAPONS IN THE TITLE, THE QUESTION OF GOING TO THE<br />
UNITED NATIONS. ONE SUGGESTION THAT W4AS MADE WAS ABOUT AIMING TO<br />
HAVE A DRAFT TREATY BY 1985. THAT WAS ACCEPTED AS A4 OBJECTIVE AND<br />
THAT CERTAINLY MAKES SENSE. WHETHER IN FACT, GIVEN THE COMPLICATED<br />
ISSUES THAT HAVE TO BE DEALT WITH, THE WORKING PARTY WOULD BE ABLE TO<br />
PROCEED THAT FAR TO ACTUALLY HAVE A DRAFT TREATY READY FOR NEXT YEAR<br />
I'M NOT SURE. WE, AS I'VE SAID, WE WILL DO EVERYTHING W4E CAN TO TRY<br />
AND ACHIEVE THAT OBJECTIVE.<br />
JOURNALIST: MR HAWKE ON THE POSSIBILITY OF JAPANESE NUCLEAR DUMPING,<br />
HOW STRONG WAS THE EXPRESSION OF CONCERN OVER THAT POSSIBILITY.<br />
SPECIFICALLY WAS THERE ANY DISCUSSION TODAY ABOUT POSSIBLE ACTION / 9 </p>
<p>AGAINST JAPAN?<br />
P. M: WERE FEELINGS WERE STRONGLY HELD, PARTICULARY BY THOSE<br />
MEMBER COUNTRIES ADJACENT, BUT NO THERE NAS NO REFERENCE TO<br />
POSSIBLE COURSES OF ACTION.<br />
JOURNALIST: MR HAWKE HOW WOULD YOU BE ABLE TO CALL THIS A NUCLEAR<br />
FREE ZONE IF, FOR EXAMPLE, WE HAD AMERICAN WARSHIPS PARTICIPATING IN<br />
EXERCISES CARRYING LARGE QUANTITIES OF AMERICAN NUCLEAR BOIMBS IN THE<br />
WATERS OF POSSIBLY TONGA OR AUSTRALIA HOW CAN IT BE A NUCLEAR FREE<br />
ZONE P. M. : WELL, I WILL GO OVER IT AGAIN. I THOUGHT IT WAS FAIRLY CLEAR<br />
BEFORE. NO0 COUNTRY WHICH ENTERS INTO A TREATY CONCEPT OF THIS KIND<br />
DOES SO ON THE BASIS THAT ITS GIVING AWAY ITS RIGHTS TO MAKE<br />
DECISIONS WHICH ARE RELEVANT IN ITS PERCEPTION OF ITS OW4N....( TAPE<br />
BREAK) IN VIETNAM TH4EY HAVE COMMUNICATION FACILITY, THEY HAVE NAVAL<br />
BASE FACILITIES, THEY NOW HAVE 17 -AIRCRAFT. DIVIDED BETWEEN THE BEAR<br />
AND BADGER AIRCRAFT, NOW THAT IS, I AM NOT SAYING THAT IN ANY<br />
BELIGERENT SENSE, I AM SAYING MERELY THAT THOSE ' rNG ARE DESCRIPTIVE<br />
OF THE REAL WORLD, OF WHICH WE ARE PART, OF WHICH W4E ARE VERY<br />
ADJACENT. NOU1-IT IS AN EXERCISE IN ILLOGICALITY FOR YOU TO IM1PLY,<br />
EVEN IF YOU DON'T ASSERT IT, THAT YOU CAN NOT CONSISTENTLY HAVE A<br />
VIEW ABOUT WHAT IS NECESSARY FOR YOUR STRATEGIC ALLIANCE RELATIONSHIP<br />
AND ALSO MAY I SAY PARANTHETICALLY ALSO RECOGNISE THE REALITY OF<br />
INTERNATIONAL LAW, THAT IS THE RIGHT OF FREEDOM OF TRANSIT ON THE<br />
HIGH SEAS AND AT THE SAME TIME, BE ABLE TO ENTERTAIN A VIEW THAT YOU<br />
WILL DO WHAT IS OPEN TO YOU IN OTHER AREAS TO TRY AND USE YOUR POWERS<br />
TO LIMIT THE OPERATION OF NUCLEAR, OTHER ELEMENTS&amp; OF THE NUCLEAR<br />
CYCLE IN YOUR AREA. THAT IS, THAT YOU CAN AT THE SAME TBIMEP MAKE<br />
DECISIONS THAT YOU WON'T, MANUFACTURE, USE OR ACQUIRE NUCLEAR WEAPONS<br />
YOURSELF. YOU WON'T STORE THEM. THAT YOU WILL OPPOSE THE DUMPING OF<br />
NUCLEAR H4ASTE MATERIAL. I AM AFRAID, H4AVING SAID IT TWICE, IF YOU<br />
CAN'T UN4DERSTAND THAT DISTINCTION, THERE IS NOT VERY MUCH HOPE THAT A<br />
TH4IRD TIME OF SAYING IT ON MY PART WILL CLARIFY IT ANY MORE.<br />
JOURNALIST: PRIME MINISTER, WHICH FORUM COU. NTRY IS LIKELY TO<br />
ACQUIRE, STORE OR MANUFACTURE NUCLEAR W, 1EAPONS?<br />
NONE, AS FAR AS I CAN SEE.<br />

Was there a feeling in the general'agreement to' roject<br />
the Vanuatu proposal. Vas there a feelinc this w.. as<br />
for all time, or was there any sucjgestion that the<br />
rejection don't exist here that might be considered again<br />
next year? There are very few things that are for all time.<br />
No, it was a decision by the Forum in respect of this year.<br />
We will be meeting again in 1985, I suppose it is conceivable<br />
that another decision could be taken then.<br />
JOURNALIST: ( Inaudible)<br />
What I have said before I left Australia remains<br />
valid, and that is, that the Cabinet will consider the<br />
report of the Senate committee of inquiry and we will consider<br />
that and our position in regard to matters involved in that<br />
report will be made clear to the Parliament when we resume<br />
next week. </p>
