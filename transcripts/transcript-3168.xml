GOVERNMENT ACHIEVEMENTS IN TASMANIA<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
THE HON. E. G. WHITLAM, M. P.,<br />
TO A LUNCHEON OF THE HOBART CHAMBER OF COMMERCE,<br />
HOBART, 22 FEBRUARY 1974<br />
THIS IS MY FOURTH VISIT TO TASMANIA SINCE I<br />
BECAME PRIME MINISTER. I CONFESS THAT IT IS ALTOGETHER<br />
TOO RARE A PLEASURE FOR ME TO VISIT YOUR CHARMING AND<br />
HISTORIC CITY. AFTER THIS WEEK, I DECIDED I WOULD RATHER<br />
BE HERE WITH YOU THAN TALKING TO THE GIPPSLAND FARMERS.<br />
THERE'S NOTHING LIKE A FRIENDLY GATHERING OF TASMANIAN<br />
BUSINESSMEN TO MAKE ONE FEEL AT HOME: NO TOMATOES,<br />
NO EGGS, NO PITCHFORKS, THEN I WAS REMINDED THAT MUCH<br />
OF AUSTRALIA'S'SUPERPHOSPHATE IS MANUFACTURED HERE IN<br />
TASMANIA, SO YOU CAN UNDERSTAND WHY AUSTRALIAN PRIME<br />
MINISTERS OCCASIONALLY WANT TO GO ABROAD. / 2 </p>
<p>Now SINCE I'VE RAISED THIS MATTER OF THE PHOSPHATE<br />
BOUNTY, AND SINCE IT IS CLEARLY A MATTER OF VERY GREAT<br />
INTEREST TO AN AGRICULTURAL STATE SUCH AS YOURS, LET ME<br />
BEGIN BY SAYING A FEW WORDS ABOUT THE DECISION WE MADE, THE<br />
OTHER DAY IN VICTORIA I QUOTED SOME REMARKS BY SIR JOHN<br />
MCEWEN WHEN THE LIBERAL-COUNTRY PARTY GOVERNMENT ABOLISHED<br />
THE LAST PHOSPHATE BOUNTY IN 1950, I WANT TO REMIND YOU<br />
OF WHAT THE FORMER LEADER OF THE COUNTRY PARTY SAID BECAUSE<br />
I KNOW HE IS A MAN YOU RESPECT AND I REGRET THAT HIS WORDS<br />
DID NOT RECEIVE THE PUBLICITY WHICH I HOPED THEY WOULD,<br />
DON'T FORGET THAT IT WAS A LABOR GOVERNMENT THAT INTRODUCED<br />
THE FIRST PHOSPHATE BOUNTY AS A WARTIME MEASURE AND IT WAS<br />
THE LIBERAL-COUNTRY PARTY GOVERNMENT THAT REPEALED IT, THEIR<br />
DECISION WAS EXPLAINED BY SIR JOHN MCEWEN IN THESE TERMS:<br />
THE ACT TO BE REPEALED WAS PASSED AS A<br />
WARTIME CONTINGENCY ArID IT HAS SERVED ITS<br />
PURPOSE, IT HAS ONLY A LIMITED USEFULNESS,<br />
THERE IS NO LONGER ANY JUSTIFICATION FOR<br />
PAYMENT FROM PUBLIC FUNDS OF A BOUNTY TO<br />
REDUCE THE COST OF A PRODUCT WHEN FOR THE<br />
OVERWHELMING PERCENTAGE OF ITS USERS IT<br />
HAS SERVED ITS PURPOSE, </p>
<p>-3-<br />
Now THAT IS PRECISELY OUR POSITION TODAY, THE<br />
BOUNTY HAS OUTLIVED ITS USEFULNESS, IT HAS SERVED ITS PURPOSE,<br />
IN THE PRESENT BOUYANT CONDITION OF THE RURAL SECTOR, NO<br />
GOVERNMENT CAN JUSTIFY THE EXPENDITURE OF $ 60 MILLION A YEAR<br />
ON A SUBSIDY THAT IS NO LONGER USEFUL, WE HAVE GIVEN A FULL<br />
YEAR'S NOTICE OF THE REMOVAL OF THE SUBSIDY AND I HAVE<br />
REMINDED FARMERS THAT IF THEY FEEL THEY HAVE A CASE FOR<br />
SPECIAL ASSISTANCE THEY SHOULD PUT IT TO THE INDUSTRIES<br />
ASSISTANCE COMMISSION WHICH MY GOVERNMENT SET UP, I MUST<br />
SAY I FIND IT CURIOUS. THAT THE PEOPLE OBJECTING MOST LOUDLY<br />
TO THE REMOVAL OF THIS SUBSIDY ARE THOSE WHO ARE CONSTANTLY<br />
TELLING US TO REDUCE GOVERNMENT SPENDING,<br />
LET ME EXPRESS THAT FIGURE OF $ 60 MILLION A YEAR<br />
IN TERMS RELEVANT TO YOUR OWN STATE, IT IS ROUGHLY EQUAL TO<br />
THE ESTIMATED TOTAL $ 65,159,000 OF ALL SPECIFIC PURPOSE<br />
REVENUE PAYMENTS TO BE MADE BY THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT TO<br />
TASMANIA IN THE PRESENT FINANCIAL YEAR, IT IS ALMOST<br />
TWO-THIRDS THE TOTAL OF ALL GENERAL REVENUE ASSISTANCE TO<br />
TASMANIA. IT IS ROUGHLY FIVE TIMES THE AMOUNT PAID BY THE<br />
COMMONWEALTH TO TASMANIA FOR ALL EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES IN THE<br />
CURRENT YEAR, NOW MUCH AS I WOULD LIKE TO TELL YOU THAT THE<br />
WHOLE $ 60 MILLION SAVED IN THIS WAY WILL BE PAID TO TASMANIA,<br />
I REGRET I CANNOT DO SO. IT IS QUITE CLEAR, HOWEVER, THAT<br />
SAVINGS OF THAT ORDER, WHEN APPLIED IN OTHER WAYS, CAN HAVE<br />
A CONSIDERABLE IMPACT ON THE WELL-BEING OF THE SMALLER STATES,<br />
MODEST SAVINGS ON A NATIONAL SCALE CAN BRING MORE THAN MODEST<br />
REWARDS TO A STATE SUCH AS YOURS, ,/ 4 </p>
<p>I WELCOME THIS OPPORTUNITY TO TALK TO YOU BECAUSE<br />
I KNOW THERE IS TENDENCY FOR TASMANIANS TO FEEL WHATEVER<br />
GOVERNMENT MAY BE IN POWER THAT THEY ARE NEGLECTED OR<br />
FORGOTTEN IN CANBERRA. YOUR PRIDE, YOUR UNIQUENESSi YOUR<br />
HISTORY, YOUR ISOLATION IN A LITERAL SENSE, YOUR INSULARITY<br />
MAKE YOU SOMEWHAT SUSPICIOUS OF NATIONAL GOVERNMENTS. IF YOU<br />
EXAMINE THE RECORD FAIRLY I DOUBT IF YOU WILL FIND ANY INSTANCE<br />
OF TASMANIA BEING UNFAIRLY TREATED BY MY GOVERNMENT OR PLACED<br />
AT A DISADVANTAGE COMPARED WITH THE OTHER STATES. INDEED IT<br />
CAN BE SHOWN THAT TASMANIA HAS BENEFITED PROPORTIONATELY BETTER<br />
FROM NATIONAL GOVERNMENT SPENDING THAN THE REST OF AUSTRALIA.<br />
I SHALL LIST SOME OF THESE AREAS IN A MOMENT. BUT FIRST<br />
LET ME MAKE A PURELY POLITICAL POINT. AS YOU KNOW, THE<br />
AUSTRALIAN LABOR PARTY, WHICH COMPOSES THE PRESENT GOVERNMENT,<br />
CURRENTLY HOLDS ALL FIVE OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES<br />
SEATS IN TASMANIA. THAT IS A REMARKABLE, GRATIFYING AND,<br />
I BELIEVE, QUITE UNPRECEDENTED EXPRESSION OF PUBLIC TRUST<br />
IN A POLITICAL PARTY. NOW THOSE FIVE SEATS IN TASMANIA<br />
REPRESENT, FOR THE PRESENT GOVERNMENT, MORE THAN HALF ITS<br />
ENTIRE MAJORITY. I MERELY SAY THIS: IT MAY BE THAT YOUR<br />
BEST ASSURANCE, YOUR MOST COMPELLING GUARANTEE OF MY GOVERNMENT'S<br />
CONCERN FOR YOUR STATE LIES IN THOSE FIVE SEATS. I ASK YOU TO<br />
ACCEPT, AS POLITICALLY REALISTIC MEN, THAT NO GOVERNMENT<br />
ENJOYING THE PUBLIC TRUST PLACED IN IT BY THE PEOPLE OF TASMANIA<br />
COULD AFFORD FOR A MOMENT TO NEGLECT YOUR INTERESTS OR YOUR<br />
WELFARE. </p>
<p>THE OTHER BASIC ASSURANCE YOU HAVE OF THE<br />
GOVERNMENT'S CONCERN LIES,, PARADOXICALLY IT MAY SEEM, IN OUR<br />
CONCERN FOR THE LARGER CITIES OF THE MAINLAND. No<br />
GOVERNMENT WHICH IS COMMITTED TO RESTRICT THE GROWTH OF<br />
SYDNEY AND MELBOURNE CAN BE INDIFFERENT TO THE GROWTH OF THE<br />
SMALLER CAPITALS. FOR THE SAME REASON THAT WE ARE ENCOURAGING<br />
THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW CIT IES LIKE ALBURY-WODONGA WE ARE<br />
ENCOURAGING THE GROWTH OF EXISTING CITIES SUCH As HOBART.<br />
MIND YOU, WE ARE DETERMINED THAT HOBART WILL AVOID THE<br />
INTOLERABLE PRESSURES PLACED ON THE' LARGER CITIES. IT<br />
IS, HOWEVER, ESSENTIAL TO OUR PLANS FOR BALANCED DEVELOPMENT<br />
AND MORE EQUITABLE AND EFFICIENT USE OF OUR RESOURCES THAT<br />
SOME OF THE GROWTH OF SYDNEY AND MELBOURNE SHOULD BE DIVERTED<br />
TO SMALLER CITIES WHERE IT WILL NOT ONLY BE ACCEPTABLE,<br />
BUT BENEFICIAL. SYDNEY's LOSS, I TRUST, WILL BE HOBART's<br />
GAIN. WITH THAT IN MIND, LET ME GIVE YOU SOME EXAMPLES OF HOW<br />
TASMANIA BENEFITS FROM THE WIDE RANGE OF NEW AND INCREASED<br />
EXPENDITURES PROVIDED IN THE GOVERNMENT's FIRST BUDGET.<br />
TOTAL PAYMENTS TO THE TASMANIAN GOVERNMENT IN 1973-74,<br />
FOR ALL PURPOSES AND INCLUDING THE STATES' LOAN COUNCIL PROGRAM,<br />
ARE ESTIMATED TO TOTAL $ 228 MILLION, AN INCREASE OF $ 32 MILLION<br />
OR 16% OVER THE AMOUNT IN 1972-73, THIS REPRESENTS OVER $ 570<br />
PER HEAD OF POPULATION IN TASMANIA, COMPARED WITH AVERAGE PAYMENTS<br />
TO ALL STATES OF $ 337 PER HEAD. </p>
<p>6<br />
IT IS ESTIMATED THAT TASMANIA WILL RECEIVE GENERAL<br />
REVENUE GRANTS TOTALLING $ 97.7 MILLION IN 1973-74,<br />
REPRESENTING $ 245 PER HEAD COMPARED WITH A NATIONAL AVERAGE<br />
OF $ 143 PER HEAD,<br />
TASMANIA HAS BEEN ALLOCATED $ 64 MILLION IN<br />
GENERAL PURPOSE CAPITAL FUNDS, UNDER DECISIONS TAKEN BY THE<br />
LOAN COUNCIL LAST JUNE, FOR STATE GOVERNMENT WORKS IN<br />
1973-74, INCLUDING AN. INTEREST-FREE GRANT FROM THE AUSTRALIAN<br />
GOVERNMENT OF $ 20,5 MILLION. IN PER CAPITA TERMS, TASMANIA<br />
IS RECEIVING OVER DOUBLE THE NATIONAL ALLOCATION $ 161 PER<br />
HEAD COMPARED WITH $ 66.9 PER HEAD FOR THE SIX STATES COMBINED.<br />
ALL THESE ALLOCATIONS RECOGNISE THE SPECIAL NEEDS<br />
OF YOUR STATE, ATTRIBUTABLE TO ITS SMALL POPULATION AND<br />
ITS RELATIVELY LOW CAPACITY TO RAISE REVENUE AND SPREAD<br />
ITS OVERHEAD COSTS. / 7 </p>
<p>7<br />
IN PRIMARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION AUSTRALIAN<br />
GOVERNMENT GRANTS WILL RISE DRAVATICALLY, MAINLY AS A RESULT<br />
OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE KARMEL COMMITTEE. GRANTS<br />
FOR SCHOOLS IN TASMANIA ARE ESTIMATED TO TOTAL MILLION<br />
IN 1973-74, AN INCREASE OF $ 2.9 MILLION OR 112% OVER THE<br />
PREVIOUS YEAR. GRANTS FOR TERTIARY EDUCATION WILL TOTAL<br />
ABOUT $ 12.5 MILLION THIS YEAR, AN INCREASE OF MILLION<br />
OR 112% OVER THE CORRESPONDING TOTAL IN 1972-73. OUR<br />
ADVANCES FOR HOUSING WILL INCREASE BY 82'% OVER THE PREVIOUS<br />
YEAR. WE HAVE ALSO MADE GENEROUS GRANTS TO TASMANIA FOR<br />
GROWTH CENTRES AND OTHER URBAN AND REGIONAL PROJECTS,<br />
FOR LAND ACQUISITION, URBAN TRANSPORT AND SEWERAGE, IN<br />
ADDITION, TASMANIA WILL RECEIVE GRANTS OF $ 14 MILLION IN.<br />
1973-74 UNDER THE COMMONWEALTH AID ROADS ARRANGEMENTS,<br />
THIS IS ANOTHER AREA WHERE TASMANIA DOES PROPORTIONATELY<br />
BETTER THAN OTHER STATES. IN 1973-74 ITS GRANTS WILL BE<br />
ABOUT $ 35 PER HEAD OF POPULATION COMPARED WITH $ 214 PER HEAD<br />
FOR THE SIX STATES. TASMANIA'S SPECIAL PROBLEMS, SUCH AS THE<br />
HIGH COST OF ROAD CONSTRUCTION AND MAINTENANCE DUE TO YOUR<br />
PECULIAR TOPOGRAPHICAL CONDITIONS, ARE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT<br />
WHEN GRANTS ARE DETERMI-NED. </p>
<p>-8-<br />
IF WE LOOK AT TASMANIA'S ECONOMY AS A WHOLE<br />
AND AS BUSINESSMEN I KNOW THAT IS YOUR MAJOR CONCERN<br />
WE FIND A STRONG PATTERN OF EXPANSION IN THE PAST 12 MONTHS.<br />
RETAIL SALES IN THE SEPTEMBER QUARTER WERE 12.7% HIGHER THAN<br />
THE SAME QUARTER OF 1972, REGISTRATIONS OF NEW MOTOR VEHICLES<br />
IN THE DECEMBER QUARTER WERE-]. 2. L'% HIGHER THAN A YEAR BEFORE,<br />
COMPARED WITH A 10.3% INCREASE FOR THE WHOLE OF AUSTRALIA,<br />
THERE WAS A STRONG GROWTH IN HOME BUILDING. THE NUMBER OF DWELLINIGS<br />
UNDER CONSTRUCTION WAS 40,7% GREATER IN THE DECEMBER QUARTER<br />
OF 1973 THAN IN THE DECEMBER QUARTER OF 1972 WELL ABOVE THE<br />
AUSTRALIAN AVERAGE OF 33%. IT IS TRUE THAT THE LABOUR<br />
MARKET HAS RECCRDED ONLY MARGINAL IMPROVEMENT IN THE PAST<br />
YEAR, BUT THERE HAS BEEN A SIGNIFICANT ACCELERATION IN<br />
EMPLOYMENT GROWTH. BETWEEN NOVEMEER 1972 AND IIOVEMBER 1073<br />
( THE LATEST MONTH FOR WHICH FIGURES ARE AVAILABLE) THE NUMBER<br />
OF EMPLOYED WAGE AND SALARY EARNERS INCREASED BY A MARKED<br />
IMPROVEMENT ON THE INCREASE BETWEEN NOVEMBER 1971 AND<br />
NOVEMBER 1972. THE EXPANSION IN FEMALE EMPLOYMENT HAS<br />
BEEN ESPECIALLY PRONOUNCED: 6.9% IN THE LATEST 12-MONTH<br />
PERIOD, COMPARED WITH A GROWTH OF 0.7% IN THE PRECEDING YEAP. I 1,/ 9 </p>
<p>C<br />
I WOULD NOT WANT THOSE FIGURES IMPORTANT AS THEY<br />
ARE, ENCOURAGING AS THEY ARE TO BE TAKEN IN ISOLATION TO<br />
GIVE A MISLEADING PICTURE OF CONDITIONS IN TASMANIA, I<br />
ACKNOWLEDGE FRANKLY THAT GrOWTH AND DEMAND IN YOUR STATE<br />
HAS BEEN LESS MARKED THAN It! AUSTRALIA AS A WHOLE DURING<br />
RECENT MONTHS. IN PARTICULAR YOUR LEVEL OF UNEMPLOYMENT<br />
JUST OVER 3% AT THE END OF JANUARY IS STILL UNACCEPTA[ LLY<br />
HIGH, ALMOST 1% HIGHER THAN'THE NATIONAL FIGURE. I BELIEVE<br />
THIS IS DUE TO UNIQUE LOCAL AND SEASONAL FACTORS IN TASMANIA.<br />
NEVERTHELESS OE WANT T0 SEE THAT FIGURE REDUCED, ANID IT WILL<br />
BE REDUCED. MY GOVERNMENT' S FIRST PRIORITY ITS FIRST DUTY<br />
TO ITS SUPPORTERS AND TO THE AUSTRALIAN PEOPLE WAS TO<br />
RESTORE FULL EMPLOYMENT AFTER THE RECESSION OF 1971-72,<br />
WE HAVE RESTORED FULL EMPLOYMIENT IN NATIONAL TERMS AND WE<br />
HAVE RESTORED A STRONG LEVEL OF REAL NATIONAL GROWTH.<br />
WE HAVE OPENED UP IMPORTANT NEW MARKETS IN ASIA AND OTHER<br />
COUNTRIES FOR OUR EXPORTS, ESPECIALLY PRIMARY PRODUCTION.<br />
FARMiERS IN PARTICULAR ARE ENJOYING RECORD INCOMES, RECORD<br />
PRODUCTION, RECORD PROSPERITY. ViE HAVE GOT OUR OVERSEAS<br />
RESERVES INTO A MUCH HEALTHIER STATE OF BALANCE. VIE HAVE<br />
TAKEN OVERDUE MEASURES, * INCLUDING TWO REVALUATIONS, TO PLACE<br />
THE CURRENCY ON A SOUNDER FOOTING IN RELATION TO CURRENCIES<br />
OVERSEAS. I BELIEVE WE CAN NOW CLAIM THAT THE AUSTRALIAN DOLLAR<br />
IS THE STRONGEST CURRENCY IN THE WORLD. </p>
<p>10<br />
I HAVE SAID MANY TIMES THAT INFLATION REMAINS THE<br />
MOST IMPORTANT SINGLE PROBLEM FACING THE GOVERNMENT. THE<br />
MEASURES WE HAVE TAKEN TO RESTRAIN INFLATION OUR TARIFF<br />
CUTS, OUR REVALUATIONS, THE PRICES JUSTIFICATION TRIBUNAL,<br />
OUR MONETARY POLICIES HAVE ALL HAD POSITIVE AND IMPORTANT<br />
EFFECTS ON THE LEVEL OF INFLATION. INFLATION WOULD BE<br />
A GREAT DEAL HIGHER TODAY IF MY GOVERNMENT HAD NOT TAKEN THE<br />
ACTION IT HAS IF WE HAD NEGLECTED THE OVERDUE MEASURES<br />
WHICH WERE SHIRKED FOR SO LONG EY OUR PREDECESSORS,<br />
I GIVE AN ASSURANCE THAT OUR UNREMITTING AND M'ANY-SIDED 13ATTLE<br />
AGAINST INFLATION WILL GO ON. THE ENERGY CRISIS AND THE<br />
ENORMOUS UNCERTAINTIES IT HAS BROUGHT TO THE ECONOMIES OF<br />
OUR TRADING PARTNERS MAKE THE FUTURE MORE HAZARDOUS AND<br />
UNPREDICTABLE. ISHOULD MAKE IT QUITE PLAIN, HOWEVER, THAT<br />
INFLATION WILL NOT BE TACKLED WITH THE OLD-FASHIONED METHODS<br />
OF THE PAST. WE WILL NOT REDUCE INFLATION BY CREATING<br />
UNEMPLOYMENT FOR WORKERS OR STAGNATION FOR BUSINESSMEN.<br />
WE WILL NOT FIGHT INFLATION BY RENEGING ON THE PROMISES WE!<br />
MADE TO THE AUSTRALIAN PEOPLE FOR SOCIAL REFORM, FOR EDUCATION,<br />
FOR DECENT CITIES, FOR BETTER TRANSPORT, FOR A NEW DEAL FOR<br />
PENSIONERS, MIGRANTS, ABORIGINALS AND THE POOR. WE ARE OFTEN<br />
TOLD THAT WE MUST REDUCE GOVERNMENT SPENDING. NO ONE EVER TELLS<br />
US WHAT SPENDING WE SHOULD CUT, THE FACT IS THAT EVERY MEASURE<br />
FOR INCREASED WELFARE OR INCREASED SPENDING ON SOCIAL REFORM.<br />
PROGRAMS HAS BEEN SUPPORTED BY OUR OPPONENTS IN. THE PARLIAMENT,<br />
IN THE CASE OF EDUCATION THEY EVEN ASKED US TO SPEND A LITTLE<br />
MORE ON SCHOOLS THAT DIDN'IT' NEED IT. IN THE CASE OF PHOSPHATES,<br />
THEY ASKED US TO KEEP A SUBSIDY THAT NO LONGER SERVES ITS PURPOSE<br />
AND WHICH OUR PREDECESSORS THEMSELVES ABOLISHED WHEN ITS<br />
USEFULNESS EXPIRED. IT IS ALL VERY WELL TO TALK ABOUT CUTS IN<br />
SPENDING, BUT I ASK: WHERE ARE THE CUTS COMING FROM? </p>
<p>1]<br />
I COME NOW TO SOME MATTERS OF SPECIAL CONCERN TO YOUR<br />
STATE. I KNOW THERE IS ANXIETY FOR THE OUTLOOK IN THE APPLE<br />
INDUSTRY. MY COLLEAGUE, SENATOR KEN WRIEDT, THE MINISTER<br />
FOR PRIMARY INDUSTRY, IS AWARE OF THE NEED FOR EXPANDED EXPORT<br />
MARKETS. LAST OCTOBER HE ANNOUNCED THAT THE GOVERNMEr'T HAD<br />
DECIDED TO ESTABLISH AN AUSTRALIAN APPLE AND PEAR CORPORATION<br />
TO REPLACE THE EXISTING APPLE AND PEAR BOARD. THE CORPORATION<br />
WILL BE ABLE TO TRADE IN ITS OWN RIGHT AND PLAY AN IMPORTANT<br />
ROLE IN RESEARCH AND PROMOTION. THE SEARCH FOR NEW~ MARKETS<br />
WILL BE AN IMPORTANT -TASK OF THE NEW CORPORATION. IN<br />
ADDITION, THE GOVERNMENT HAS MADE EMERGENCY PAYMENTS<br />
TOTALLING $ 2.1 MILLION TO ASSIST APPLE EXPORTEPS ADVERSELY<br />
AFFECTED BY THE REVALUATION OF THE DOLLAR. SUPPLEMENTARY<br />
GRANTS OF $ 1,000 WILL ALSO BE MADE TO FARMERS GROWING<br />
EXPORT APPLES WHO MAY BE IN EXTREME FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES.<br />
I SHOULD SAY THAT NO ONE UNDERSTANDS YOUR PROBLEMS BETTFR<br />
OR HAS DONE MORE FOR THE LONG-TERN INTERESTS OF PRIMARY<br />
PRODUCERS IN THIS COUNTRY, THAN YOUR FELLOW-TASMANIAN,<br />
KEN WRIEDT. I BELIEVE HE IS HELD IN UNIVERSAL RESPECT<br />
THROUGHOUT THIS STATE AND THROUGHOUT AUSTRALIA, / 12 </p>
<p>12<br />
NEXT, I MENTION OUR POLICY ON WATER RESOURCES.<br />
THE GOVERNMENT HAS PUBLISHED A DOCUMENT, " A NATIONAL<br />
APPROACH TO WATER RESOUIRCES MANAGEMENT", WHICH SETS OUT<br />
A NUMBER OF OBJECTIVES AND PROPOSED COURSES OF ACTION<br />
BY THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF<br />
AUSTRALIA'S WATER RESOURCES. A MEETING OF STATE AND<br />
AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT MINISTERS IN MELBOURNE ON ILI DECEMBER<br />
ENDORSED OUR CONCEPT OF A NATIONAL WATER POLICY, AND FURTHER<br />
DISCUSSIONS WILL BE HELD ON THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THAT<br />
POLICY, YOUR PREMIER HAS SOUGHT AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT<br />
ASSISTANCE FOR THE NORTH WESTERN REGIONAL-WATER SCHEME,<br />
WHICH WILL AUGMENT THE WATER SUPPLIES OF SEVERAL TOWNS<br />
IN THE BURNIE-DEVONPORT AREA. CONSULTATIONS ON THIS<br />
PROJECT WILL BE UNDERTAKEN SHORTLY.<br />
INi THE DEVELOPMENT OF YOUR IMPORTANT MANUFACTURING<br />
INDUSTRIES, ESPECIALLY THOSE BASED ON YOUR MINERAL AND TIMBER<br />
RESOURCES, my GOVERNMENT RECOGNISES THE SPECIAL DIFFICULTIES<br />
IMPOSED BY HIGH TRANSPORT COSTS FETWEENj TASMANIA AND THE<br />
MAINLAND. ON 30 NOVEMBER LAST YEAR I ANNOUNCED THE APPOINTMENT<br />
OF MR J. F. NIMMO, FORMER SECRETARY OF THE DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING,<br />
AS A ROYAL COMMISSIONER TO UNDERTAKE AN INGUIRY INTO THE IMPACT<br />
OF FREIGHT RATES ON THE TASMANIAN ECONOMY. WE HAVE ALSO<br />
ANNOUNCED THAT MR M. M. SUMMERS, FORMER SECRETARY OF THE DEPARTMENT<br />
OF TRANSPORT, WILL INQUIRE INTO THE LONG-TERM DEVELOPMENT OF<br />
THE MARITIME INDUSTRY. AM HOPEFUL THAT BOTH THESE INQUIRIES<br />
WILL BENEFIT TASMANIA,. .113 </p>
<p>73<br />
I MENTION OUP IMPORTANT DECISION TO MOVE IHE<br />
HEADQUARTERS OF THE ANTARCTIC DIVISION OF THE DEPARTMErT<br />
OF SCIENCE TO HOBART. THE DIVISION WILL MOVE INTO A NEW<br />
UNIFIED COMPLEX TO COST AROUND 17 MILLION AND EXPECTED TO<br />
BE COMPLETED IN 1977. THIS WILL BE A MAJOR DECENTRALISATION<br />
OF AN AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENT, MIUCH OF THE<br />
DIVISION IS BUDGET OF MORE THAN $ 7 MILLION A YEAR WILL PE.<br />
SPENT IN TASMANIA PURCHASING SUPPLIES FOR EXPEDITIONS<br />
AND SHIPS, HOBART WAS CHOSEN nECAUSE OF ITS EXCELLENT<br />
PORT FACILITIES AND GREATER PROXIMITY TO THE ANTARCTIC.<br />
THE RESULT WILL BE A MORE FRECUENT USE OF H4OBART BY THE<br />
POLAR VESSELS ON CHARTER TO THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT,<br />
THE UNIVERSITY OF TASMANIA, WHICH HAS HAD A LONG ASSOCIATION<br />
WITH THE DIVISION IN RESEARCH WORK ON COSMIC RAYS, WILL BE<br />
ABLE TO CO-OPERATE MORE CLOSELY IN OTHER AREAS OF RESEARCH<br />
AND BUILD UP ITS ALREADY CONSIDERABLE SCIENTIFIC REPUTATION.<br />
THE ENTHUSIASTIC RESPONSE OF THE VICE-CHANCELLOR, SIR<br />
GEORGE CARTLAND, AND THE ACADEMIC STAFF OF THE UNI/ ErsiTY<br />
TO THE TRANSFER OF THE DIVISION UNDERLINES THE LONG-TERM<br />
IMPORTANCE THAT THEY SEE IN THE GOVERNMENT'S DECISION,<br />
IREFER NEXT TO OUR SPECIAL ENCOURAGEMENT FOR TOURISM<br />
IN TASMANIA. WE ESTABLISHED A NEW DEPARTMENT OF TOURISM AND<br />
RECREATION AND LAST YEAR THE MINISTER APPROVED A GRANT OF<br />
$ 95,000 To TASMANIA TOWARDS THE RESTORATION AND. CON'/ ERSIOM OF<br />
THE HISTORIC ASYLUM AT PORT ARTHUR. WE HAVE APPROVED CRAMTVS,<br />
ON A DOLLAR FOR DOLLAR BANIS WITH THE STATES, TO DEV'EL. OP YOUTH<br />
HOSTELS FOR YOUNG TRAVELLERS. / J L! </p>
<p>1L<br />
FINALLY I MENTION THE IMPORTANT WORK OF THE CSIRO<br />
AND THE DEPARTMENT OF SCIENCE IN CHECKING AND MONITORING<br />
MERCURY POLLUTION IN THE DERWENT; LAST YEAR OUR LABORATORIES<br />
IN TASMANIA DETECTED A HIGH LEVEL OF MERCURY IN SOME TYPES<br />
OF FISH AND WARNINGS WERE ISSUED TO THE PUBLIC BY THE<br />
TASMANIAN GOVERNMENT, THE DEPARTMENTS OF SCIENCE AND HEALTH<br />
ARE MAKING A CONTINUING INVESTIGATION INTO THE PRESFtCE OF<br />
MERCURY AND BROMIDE IN HOUSEHOLD FOODS.<br />
I KNOW THAT A SMALL STATE SUCH AS YOURS HAS SPECIAL<br />
PROELEMS IN KEEPING PACE WITH THE DEVELOPMENT AND LIVING STANDARDS<br />
OF THE LARGER STATES. SO LET ME CONCLUDE WITH SOME REFERENCE<br />
TO THE MEASURES WE ARE TAKING TO ENSURE GREATER EOUALITY AND<br />
FAIRNESS IN THE ALLOCATION OF OUR NATIONAL RESOURCES. THESE<br />
RELATE SPECIALLY TO THE AREA OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT. TASMANIANS<br />
ARE WELL AWARE OF THE IMPORTANT ROLE OF THE COMMONWEALTH GRANTS<br />
COMMISSION IN REDRESSING THE INEQUALITIES BETWEEN THE STATES.<br />
YOU ALSO HAVE DIRECT EXPERIENCE OF INEQUALITIES BETWEEN REGIONS<br />
WITHIN YOUR STATE, FOR SMALL AS TASMANIA IS IN GEOGRAPHICAL TERMS,<br />
THERE ARE AREAS WITHIN IT WHICH ARE MARKEDLY LESS DEVELOPED, LESS<br />
PROSPEROUS, THAN OTHERS. IT IS FOR THAT REASON THAT MY<br />
GOVERNMENT DECIDED LAST YEAR TO WIDEN THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE<br />
GRANTS COMMISSION TO ENABLE IT TO GIVE FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO<br />
LOCAL GOVERNMENT ON A REGIONAL EDsIS. APPLICATIONS FOR ASSISTANCE<br />
HAVE BEEN MADE AND I EXPECT THE COMMISSION TO COMPLETE ITS HEARINGS<br />
ABOUT THE END OF MAY, WITH RECOVtlENDATIONS IN TIME FOR THE<br />
1.974-75 BUDGET, I </p>
<p>15<br />
OUR OTHER INITIATIVE IS DESIGNED TO GIVE LOCAL<br />
GOVERNMENT A VOICE AND A VOTE ON THE LOAN COUNCIL AND TO<br />
ENABLE THE NATIONAL PARLIAMENT TO BORROW MONEY ON BEHALF<br />
OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND CRANT FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE DIRECT<br />
TO LOCAL GOVERNMENT BODIES, THIS WILL BE POSSIBLE IF OUR<br />
REFERENDUM ON LOCAL GOVERNMENT IS APPROVED IN MAY, I STRESS<br />
THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS PROPOSAL TO TASMANIA, YOUR " TATE<br />
HAS MANY SPECIAL NEEDS WHICH ONLY LOCAL GOVERNMENT CAN SUPPLY,<br />
IF WE ARE TO ENSURE THAT TASMANIA'S DEVELOPMENT KEEPS UP<br />
WITH THE OTHER'STATES. IF WE ARE TO ENSURE THAT THE FINANCIAL<br />
RESOURCES OF THE NATION ARE FULLY AND EFFECTIVELY USED<br />
FOR THE WELFARE OF THE SMALLER STATES AND THE REGIONS<br />
WITHIN IT, IF WE ARE TO ENSURE THAT TASMANIA AND TASMANIANS<br />
HAVE JUST AND PROPER ACCESS TO THE RESOURCES OF THE<br />
NATION AND THAT THESE RESOURCES ARE USED WHERE THEY ARE<br />
MOST NEEDED, THEN I URGE YOU TO SUPPORT THE REFERENDUM<br />
WE SHALL BE PUTTING TO THE PEOPLE IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE<br />
SENATE ELECTIONS, THERE WILL NO LONGER BE ANY NEED FOR<br />
A SMALL STATE TO BE DISADVANTAGED OR FOR REGIONS WITHIN<br />
THAT STATE TO BE DEPRIVED, BY THIS REFERENDUM I HOPE<br />
TO SEE LOCAL GOVERNMENT ESTABLISHED AS A FULL AND EQUAL<br />
PARTNER IN THE FEDERAL SYSTEM, IN THE SAME WAY, AND WITH<br />
THE ASSISTANCE AND CONTINUED SUPPORT OF THE AUSTRALIAN<br />
GOVERNMENT, I BELIEVE TASMANIA WILL PROSPER AS A FULL<br />
AND EQUAL PARTNER IN OUR FEDERATION, </p>
