Prime Minister Julia Gillard today announced the further expansion of the successful headspace program with 15 new sites and two outpost sites to be set up across Australia.</p>
<p>This is part of the Gillard Government's record $2.2 billion Delivering Mental Health Reform Package, with $197.3 million allocated over five years to expand the number of headspace sites to 90. This brings the Government's total investment in headspace services to $359 million.</p>
<p>Speaking at the Opening Ceremony of the Commonwealth Youth Forum in Perth the Prime Minister said the Gillard Government was committed to boosting the availability of mental health services for young people, right across the nation.</p>
<p>Mental health is the single biggest health issue facing young Australians. In any given year around Australia one in four young people will experience a mental health disorder.</p>
<p>Early intervention is crucial to prevent issues from becoming more serious and longer lasting, which is why these additional headspace centres are so important.</p>
<p>The announcement of the 15 locations will take the number of headspace sites around the country to 55. An additional 35 locations will be announced over the next four years.</p>
<p>Once up and running, the 90 sites will help up to 72,000 young Australians each year.</p>
<p>The new sites have been chosen in conjunction with headspace, and in consultation with State and Territory governments on the basis of community need, youth populations, access to existing services and local capacity.  The new sites are listed below.</p>
<p>The Gillard Government has almost doubled funding to existing headspace sites from $450,000 to an average of $842,000 per site per year, to ensure that more young people are able to access services.</p>
<p>Also beginning today, headspace will provide free, confidential and anonymous counselling services over the phone or online to young people between the ages of 12 and 25 years with, or at risk of developing, a mild to moderate mental illness.</p>
<p>This service, run by headspace on behalf of the Gillard Government,will provide online and telephone counselling services, referrals and advice about possible next steps in receiving treatment.</p>
<p>“E-headspace” will be an integral supplement to headspace sites, extending the reach of the model to more young people, particularly kids in regional and remote Australia.</p>
