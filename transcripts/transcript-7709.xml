PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF QUESTION AND ANSWER SESSION, AUSTRALIAN<br />
FINANCIAL REVIEW POST-BUDGET DINNER, MELBOURNE,<br />
16 AUGUST 1989<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
Mr Andrew Scott, Coles-Myer<br />
QUESTION: Prime Minister, in deference to your tendencies,<br />
I have placed a personal bet of half a dozen bottles of<br />
wine, that the 90 day bank bill interest rates will be below<br />
percent for a full one month period before the end of<br />
June 1990. Is it a safe bet?<br />
PM: I'm not sure that I heard your question. Is it that<br />
you have engaged in a betting transaction involving alcohol?<br />
If so, I'm appalled. It's nine years ago that I was in that<br />
sort of caper. But that interest rates would be, this is<br />
mortgage interest rates would be at what by when?<br />
QUESTION: Bank bill rates would be<br />
PM: Bank bill rates would be?<br />
QUESTION: ( inaudible)<br />
PM: By June of 1990?<br />
QUESTION: ( inaudible)<br />
PM: Well I've got to disappoint you because I have made a<br />
practice of not predicting ( laughter) I haven't finished, of<br />
not predicting actual rates at a particular point of time.<br />
I am prepared to say that I think we have in place the<br />
policies which will mean that before the end of this<br />
financial year, which is relevant to your transaction, that<br />
interest rates will be moving down. Now it's just a<br />
question of whether they'll reach the point that you're<br />
talking about, but I'm not going to put a figure on it<br />
because if I do put a figure on it, the very fact that I say<br />
that, and it's an awesome responsibility, I tremble about it<br />
( laughter) I do, I tremble about it every morning under the<br />
shower and the very fact that Hawke said they'll be at a<br />
particular point at a particular time will effect the actual<br />
movements. I will assert that before the end of the<br />
financial year the rates will be moving down and I hope you<br />
win your bet. , a-41' A </p>
<p>Mr Keith Lambert, Deloitte Haskins Sells<br />
QUESTION: Prime Minister, I think, if my maths is correct,<br />
there's some 33 weeks between now and April of 1990. Could<br />
you tell us please what would be the additional annual cost<br />
of paying the pensioners their $ 2 a week from now, what<br />
would be their additional cost of paying them the full<br />
increase from now? Given that you're expecting a $ 9 billion<br />
surplus, I wonder if it would come as any surprise that some<br />
of the pensioners are referrring to this as the two bob<br />
Budget? PM: Yes it does and fortunately when you're in the position<br />
I'm in, unless you want to drive yourself absolutely insane<br />
and I haven't got that wish, what you do is to deal with<br />
those people who, through their experience and commitment<br />
and involvement, have the authority to be regarded as<br />
spokespersons for their constituency. In that regard it's<br />
important to note that two people who satisfy that criterion<br />
Maureen Hewitt who for a very considerable period of time<br />
has been a very effective spokesperson for the pensioners in<br />
this country and, on a more general basis, Julian Disney<br />
from the Australian Council of Social Service have both<br />
applauded the Government on what they've done.<br />
Before I come to specifically answer the question you put I<br />
think it's appropriate that I give you the context in which<br />
we've acted. When we came to office, the pension, as a<br />
proportion of average weekly earnings was about 22 and a<br />
half percent. We've got it up now to virtually 25 percent.<br />
Even if we had given no further increase, it's likely that<br />
as we went into next year it would still be at 25 percent at<br />
that point after the adjustment in April, but we wanted to<br />
make sure that there would be no doubt about that and so<br />
we've made the decision to award that extra $ 2 a week from<br />
April of next year.<br />
So what we have done at this point of time is not some<br />
aberration, but it's another instalment in what has been a<br />
steady improvement in the relative position of pensioners in<br />
the community. We've been able to do that because, as I<br />
indicated in the speech that I made, more than any other<br />
Government before in the history of this country, we have<br />
targetted assistance. That's what any sensible community in<br />
this day and age is going to have to do and to do<br />
increasingly. We regard it as an obscenity that we were<br />
wasting resources in the pension area upon millionaires, we<br />
brought in the assets test which you may recall particularly<br />
in this fair city of Melbourne, if you read the Melbourne<br />
Herald, that that was going to be the end of the world as we<br />
knew it the assets test. Well of course now it has become<br />
the conventional wisdom. </p>
<p>-3-<br />
Now, of course, when you are looking at this question of the<br />
adequacy of the decision we've made, therefore you see it as<br />
a step in the culmination of what we've done. But it wasn't<br />
all that we've done. What we've done in the area of<br />
pensions of course is to increase the tax free area of<br />
additional income that pensioners can earn and that is being<br />
extended so that you will have an identity of income,<br />
additional income, and the tax free area and up to the point<br />
where it's now determined that by 1995, no full or part time<br />
pensioner will pay tax.<br />
So it's not just the increase that's been given which is<br />
significant, but it's part of an overall approach and<br />
package which as I say has been very, very strongly<br />
applauded and welcomed by the people who do have the<br />
responsibility of speaking with authority for that<br />
constituency. In my own personal experience I met a lovely group of<br />
pensioners today at Parliament House and without exception<br />
they applauded what we've done. Of course, I think it's<br />
worth making the point without spending any time on it, that<br />
equally important on what we've done in the pension area is<br />
not only for those who are in the pension area now, but the<br />
most significant thing we've done of course is to tackle, as<br />
I said, this problem for the future so that there will be<br />
incentives to savings and superannuation. As to what<br />
the costs would be, well I think the full year, full year<br />
cost of what we've done is about, as I recall, I say this<br />
subject to correction, about $ 320 million. So you can work<br />
it out yourself, even without a calculator.<br />
Mr Peter Hill, Trade Indemnity Australia Limited<br />
QUESTION: Mr Prime Minister, as a result of yesterday's<br />
Budget do you believe Moody's will downgrade Australia's<br />
international rating? If not, why not and if yes, what<br />
effect do you believe such downgrading will have on our<br />
economy, both locally and internationally in the future?<br />
PM: I don't know whether the rest of you have had the same<br />
difficulty as I am having in hearing the questions, but<br />
fortunately I've got them written down here. The answer to<br />
your question, do I believe that as a result of yesterday's<br />
Budget Moody's will downgrade Australia's international<br />
budget, no I don't believe they will. As far as you can<br />
tell from what I've heard on the news so far, a spokesman<br />
whoever he may be, but he was described as a spokesman for<br />
Moody's, spoke in fairly laudatory terms about the Budget.<br />
So if there is any logic at this stage of their career in<br />
what they do as distinct from the sort of noises they've<br />
been making recently, then if they are applauding the Budget<br />
you would think that they would not further downgrade us.<br />
If they did downgrade us it would be a surprise and an<br />
irrelevancy. </p>
<p>-4-<br />
Mr Chu<br />
QUESTION: Mr Prime minister, you are stressing about<br />
incentives and motivation for the people, how do you expect<br />
us to improve motivation or productivity if the maximum tax<br />
rate of the upper income groups is actually 50.25 if you add<br />
in Medicare tax, as compared to the corporate tax rate of 39<br />
percent? Are we kidding ourselves to expect the managerial<br />
resources of the country to work as hard as you want us to<br />
do? PM: Well, let me just very quickly put the background to<br />
this. You know what we've done already in this area, of<br />
changing the tax rates. We inherited a top rate of<br />
we've brought it already down to 49 and at the beginning of<br />
next year it will be coming down to 47. So, if you want to<br />
make comparisons between alternatives in this country, the<br />
other mob left you with 60, we'll have it down to 47 at the<br />
beginning of the year. The lower rate down from 30 to 21.<br />
Now that's a very significant change. You do, in a sense,<br />
put your finger on a problem when you talk about the gap<br />
between the top personal rate and the company rate. We<br />
believe that, of course, what we've done to very<br />
significantly reduce that gap is in itself important.<br />
Secondly, of course, we have in our period of Government<br />
taken an unprecedented number of measures to smash avoidance<br />
schemes and to ensure that the resources of the Taxation<br />
Commission are available to do what they should do and that<br />
is to ensure that everyone who should pay their tax pays it.<br />
Therefore I think the degree of incentive that existed under<br />
the extraordinarily lax and objectionable system that was<br />
left by the conservatives, the incentive that was there to<br />
avoid and to have artificial schemes is significantly less<br />
now than it was because of the two things. We've reduced<br />
the gap and, as I say, the people who want to go about the<br />
processes of artificial reward know that it's very much<br />
more difficult than it was before.<br />
Now that then comes to the fundamentals. Are Australians<br />
people who are only going to work because they say, well I<br />
look at what my disposable income here is compared to what<br />
it might be in another country and because there is some<br />
difference I'm either not going to work so hard or I'm going<br />
to uproot myself and go. well, I make a different judgement<br />
about the Australian people than you do. obviously, all of<br />
us, and I don't exclude myself from that, I guess generally<br />
speaking, you'd like to get as much out of what you do as<br />
you reasonably could, but I don't think Australians are<br />
overwhelmingly driven by that consideration. I think there<br />
is an understanding that if we want to undertake a number of<br />
the things that we have to in creating infrastructure in<br />
this country, then there are certain things that Government<br />
has to do. </p>
<p>You will understand from the statistics I've already given<br />
that this is a Government which has not increased its take<br />
in the taxation area, We now have a taxation as a<br />
proportion of GDP which is lower than it was before and that<br />
the creation of the surplus has been by way of cutting of<br />
expenditure. Now that means that if Government is going to<br />
undertake the things that are necessary to create the<br />
infrastructure that industry wants, then you've got to have<br />
your financial where-with-all to do it and there is a limit<br />
to how far you can go in tax changes. Having said that, I<br />
would on balance hope that at some later stage we may be<br />
able to somewhat narrow that gap further. But that is, let<br />
me make it clear, is not something which is on any immediate<br />
agenda. We have just made a very, very significant change,<br />
very significant tax reductions and it is appropriate that<br />
they should have their effect in the system.<br />
Finally, I make the point that I think that Australians do<br />
have a greater sense of motivation than that upon which your<br />
question is predicated. You predicate your question upon<br />
the assumption that either the only or the overwhelming<br />
consideration as to how Australians are going to react to<br />
the challenge facing them is what is in the end the<br />
disposable income they get as a result of the equation<br />
between wages and salaries and tax. I don't think it's as<br />
simple as that. I think Australians have, a lot of<br />
Australians and I think the majority of Australians have<br />
motivations which go beyond that.<br />
Mr Gavin Ross, Gavin Ross and Company<br />
QUESTION: Mr Hawke, in economic theory the way to cure a<br />
balance of payments is to devalue the currency. Imports<br />
become more expensive and we import less, similarly exports<br />
become cheaper and we export more. Why not devalue the<br />
currency and lower the interest rates?<br />
PM: I'd love to see your text book, love to see your<br />
textbook comrade. I understand that the theory that you're<br />
expounding suggests that if we devalue the currency, we'll<br />
have a situation where we will import less because the<br />
imports will be more expensive and we'll we'll export more<br />
and the economy is going to go into boom time and that will<br />
enable us to lower the rate of interest. well, I don't know<br />
which particular land of fantasy you come from or you want<br />
to go into, but it's not the real world. I just wonder<br />
what, for instance, you would think, without going going<br />
into all the complications of that absurdly simplistic<br />
proposition, but what you would think might happen in the<br />
area of wages policy. For instance, when our import prices<br />
went soaring upwards our inflation rate went up and the<br />
trade unions, as well as employers who naturally take the<br />
automatic adjustment as their holy right, I mean, if the<br />
cost of employers go up they automatically must adjust for<br />
the increases in their costs. </p>
<p>-6-<br />
So they put their prices up and the unions would also, of<br />
course, would be saying well up go our wages and in no time<br />
you'll become completely uncompetitive. So, get the right<br />
theory book comrade.<br />
Des Moore, Institute of Public Affairs<br />
QUESTION: Prime Minister, in his Budget speech, the<br />
Treasurer said quite correctly, I believe, that demand<br />
is only half the story. The other half is to lift the<br />
supply of goods and services. My question is first, why,<br />
given the great achievements claimed for the Accord, there<br />
has been virtually no growth in productivity since 1984/ 85<br />
and why the 1989/ 90 forecast implies no growth again in<br />
productivity this year. what has happened to the<br />
productivity agreements and the industry restructuring that<br />
is said to have occurred?<br />
Second, why do we still have wages and inflation growing way<br />
out of kilter with our trading partners after six years of<br />
the Accord? Is it seriously being claimed that we would now<br />
be worse off in terms of productivity and inflation if there<br />
had been no Accord since 1982/ 83?<br />
PM: The answer to the last question is yes, very<br />
significantly worse off and I'll come to explain why in a<br />
minute. But let me go to the series of questions involved<br />
in good old Des' predictable question the sort of question<br />
that you'd expect from the way Des has been writing over the<br />
years.<br />
Now, the first question that you put as to why there's been,<br />
as you put it, virtually no growth in productivity since<br />
' 84/' 85 of course there has been growth in productivity, but<br />
the basic reason why you haven't had a higher measure of<br />
productivity increase is for the fact that we have had a<br />
rate of employment growth, on average, more than twice as<br />
fast as the rest of the world and four times faster than<br />
that rate of employment growth that operated under our<br />
predecessors. So when you've had this record and above<br />
average increase in employment then, as you know, the simple<br />
equation of measure of productivity, the relationship<br />
between numbers employed and output, where you have a record<br />
rate of employment growth more than twice as fast as the<br />
rest of the world, obviously that is going to have an effect<br />
upon your productivity figures. It's just a matter of<br />
simple arithmetic logic.<br />
Now you then ask the question, remarkably, what has happened<br />
to the productivity agreement and industry restructuring<br />
that is said to have occurred. Now of course, the major<br />
instrument of industry restructuring is accumulating in the<br />
most recent period and no-one, including the employers, who<br />
have been involved in this process said at any point that </p>
<p>-7-<br />
they expected those changes to have an immediate reflection<br />
in productivity improvement. But what they have said, and<br />
what they have said on the basis of the experience that they<br />
have derived from comparing overseas performance with what<br />
they expect to do here, is that over a period of time into<br />
the future, those changes will be reflected in significant<br />
improvements in productivity.<br />
For instance, I just put a very simple question to you. If<br />
you look at the metal trades, do you think or don't you<br />
think that as you are now in the process of moving to a<br />
situation where instead of having some three hundred<br />
classications in the metal trades award you're going to move<br />
to have about eight. That is going to involve a massive<br />
change in the training processes and the interchangeability<br />
of people on the job.<br />
Do you or do you not think that that change is going to have<br />
a significant impact on productivity? Of course the answer<br />
to that question is in the affirmative. Those changes are<br />
in the process of being implemented now and when they are<br />
firmly in place and they're extending more and more through<br />
the economy, they will, without any question, have a<br />
significant impact on the productivity performance of the<br />
Australian economy.<br />
Then you go on to ask the next question, why do we still<br />
have wages and inflation growing way out of kilter with our<br />
trading partners after six years of the Accord. Well of<br />
course, again, it's based on a false premise. It is, we<br />
have a situation where we are not performing as well as<br />
some, obviously of our trading partners, we are doing very<br />
much better than others. For instance, how would you like<br />
to swap the position in the United Kingdom with ours? The<br />
United Kingdom has the sort of position which<br />
philosophically you would applaud which reflects the absence<br />
of an Accord. Does it ever, no Accord there. What's your<br />
expectation about wages movement there, about 10 or 11<br />
percent in wages growth and inflation which is going up<br />
towards the same level. That's what you have in the United<br />
Kingdom in the absence of the Accord.<br />
In this country, which goes into your next question, you're<br />
saying is it seriously claimed that we would now be worse<br />
off in terms of productivity, inflation if there'd been no<br />
Accord since 1982/ 83, the answer is a resounding yes. Of<br />
course we'd be infinitely worse off. How do you think that<br />
we've been able to create one and a half million new jobs?<br />
How do you think that we've had a reduction in real wages?<br />
Do you think you would have had a reduction in real wages if<br />
you hadn't had the Accord, if you'd had free bargaining? </p>
<p>-8-<br />
You don't have to be theoretical about this Des, just go<br />
back and you should remember, you were in the centre of it<br />
in the Treasury at the time associated with those who were<br />
pursuing those absurd policies under Stone, your civil<br />
service head and under Howard, your political head, you were<br />
right there in the thick of it. What happened, my fellow<br />
worker? I'll tell you what happened. Under your policies,<br />
which were the abandonment of the Accord or the central wage<br />
fixation, after Malcolm went off to the wedding and said go<br />
for your life, no centralised wage system, go for your life,<br />
have the free labour market. What happened? What happened<br />
to wages? Seventeen percent increase in wages and double<br />
digit inflation and massive unemployment. That's what you<br />
had when you had the absence of the Accord, when you had the<br />
absence of centralised wage fixing.<br />
So you don't only need to exercise your brain and come to an<br />
intellectual conclusion. Just take yourself back eight<br />
years in Australian history and you've got your own answer<br />
to your own question. You had the absence of the Accord,<br />
you had the absence of centralised wage fixing and, my<br />
friend, you had a wages explosion which wrecked this<br />
economy. You were involved in the whole process and you<br />
did, as Paul has said, something which requires a very<br />
unique genius. No-one had ever been able to do it before.<br />
You put Australia into negative growth. That's what you did<br />
without the Accord. With the Accord we've got a situation,<br />
we had four times the rate of employment growth under us<br />
with the Accord, against the absence of the Accord, four<br />
times as fast as what you did then, twice as fast as the<br />
rest of the world. So I'll take the Accord and you can have<br />
your 1981/ 82 fiasco.<br />
Mr Peter Mitchell<br />
0 QUESTION: Mr Prime minister, this is not a Budget question<br />
but I know it's something very dear to your heart. With<br />
your love of cricket and the support you've given the<br />
Australian cricket team during those lean years, you must be<br />
delighted with the result of the Ashes over the last week.<br />
Would you like to comment sir?<br />
PM: I'm thoroughly thrilled, as I think you all are and let<br />
me just say, quite seriously, I had the pleasure when I was<br />
over there recently on business, we were able to get just a<br />
few hours off to go to Lords, let me say this, they're not<br />
only magnificent cricketers, but they are tremendous<br />
ambassadors for this country on and off the field. I don't<br />
think we've had a better team in that respect and they<br />
deserve all the success that they are getting. They are an<br />
enormous credit to this country.<br />
