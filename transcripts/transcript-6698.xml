PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 20 AUGUST 1985<br />
The Prime Minister and the Minister for Primary Industry,<br />
Mr John Kerin, tonignt gave details of the Government's<br />
response to requests from primary producers organisations to<br />
reduce the impact of farm costs on their income.<br />
Mr Hawke and Mr Kerin noted that the Government's total<br />
response to the cost-price squeeze oeing faced by farmers<br />
involved initiatives on both costs and prices.<br />
In tne uroader context, the Government's overall budget<br />
strategy and sound economic management would contribute<br />
significantly in itself to lowering farmers' costs.<br />
As well, the general thrust of primary industry policy would<br />
continue* to pursue efficiency and reduced costs to industry.<br />
However, the Government had recognised that there is a need for<br />
further measures aimed at reducing costs and this gave rise to<br />
the Prime Minister's commitment in this regard to farmers on<br />
1 July 1985.<br />
In keeping with the Prime Minister's commitment the Government<br />
has decided to:<br />
reuate in full the diesel fuel excise for farming, fishing<br />
and forestry uses which are currently eligible for rebate<br />
as a result primary producers will be rebated the full<br />
10.007 cents/ litre excise, rather than only 7.619<br />
cents/ litre, as at present<br />
which means that a farmer using 15,000 litres of fuel per<br />
year will save about $ 350 per year<br />
to remove remaining duties on imported grain harvesters<br />
and provide local producers with an equivalent level of<br />
assistance by way of a bounty<br />
the present tariff of 15% adds significantly to the cost<br />
of all out the very large imported machines for whico<br />
concessional entry is allowed. </p>
<p>-2-<br />
This package builds on recent decisions which benefit the rural<br />
sector. In particular:<br />
The provision of $ 9m over three years to reduce effort and<br />
improve competitiveness in the fishing industry<br />
A range of new policies falling in the Primary Industry<br />
portfolio announced tonight including the provision of $ lm<br />
for the first stage of a meat and Livestock Industry<br />
MarKeting Innovation Assistance Package.<br />
The inclusion of a spot price component in the formula<br />
calculating the Import Parity Price of oil, which has led<br />
to a reduction in tne price of fuel<br />
And, in recognition of the widespread concern in the rural<br />
sector, the decision not to proceed with a 12.5%<br />
consumption tax on fuel.<br />
The measures outlined in the oudget will be introduced as soon<br />
as legislative and administrative considerations permit. The<br />
full rebate of diesel excise will be payaole from 1 November<br />
1985 and the change in the form of assistance for grain<br />
uarvester production will take effect from 1 January 1986. It<br />
is estimated that extending the rebate on diesel will cost<br />
doout $ 35m in a full year and that the actions on grain<br />
harvesters will involve an annual cost of about $ 14m, including<br />
bounty outlays and tariff revenue forgone.<br />
Details of the new bounty on locally produced grain harvesters<br />
will be announced by the Minister for Industy, Technology and<br />
Commerce following reciept of advice from the Industries<br />
Assistance Commission.<br />
The Government has accepted the strength of rural concerns<br />
aoout the costs incurred as a result-of present assistance<br />
arrangements for the production of agricultural chemicals.<br />
The Government will take steps to ensure that assistance<br />
arrangements do not impose undue costs on users. However, it<br />
uelieVes thiat any action should await the receipt of the IAC<br />
Report on the chemicals and plastics industries which will<br />
provide an accurate picture of the costs and benefits of<br />
current assistatice arrangements.<br />
The Government believes that the package announced tonight<br />
represents the greatest possible benefit tnat could be provided<br />
to primary producers without imposing undue costs on the rest<br />
ojf tthe community. </p>
<p>In the climate of budgetary restraint, the full farm cost<br />
package, which will have a full year cost of about<br />
represents a major effort by the Government to meet the highest<br />
priority needs identified by rural interests themselves.<br />
It needs to be remembered, nlowever that primary production<br />
obtains considerable benefits from the Government's efforts to<br />
contain overall outlays, and to nold down the effects on<br />
uomestic wages and prices of the depreciation of the Australian<br />
dollar. While these measures, together with the increases in returns<br />
brought about by tue depreciation of the currency, will ease<br />
cost/ price pressures, the Government recognises that they will<br />
not of themselves restore profitability to all rural<br />
producers. Primary producers will need to continue to adjust<br />
to the prices dictated by the marketplace. No Government can,<br />
or should, try to prevent adjustment, even though that might<br />
mean tnat some people will need to alter their operations. The<br />
Government will, of course, act to reduce the costs of that<br />
adjustment through the Rural Adjustment Scueme and relevant<br />
social security programs.<br />
In reaching its decision the Government has given careful<br />
consideration to a range of proposals put forward by primary<br />
producers, including proposals from the National Farmers<br />
Federation. </p>
