TiHE NATIONAL ISSUE Mii', FRASER IGNORIES<br />
The Leader of the Opposition has asserted the national significance<br />
of the Bass by-election but only in general, hypothetical terms.<br />
I agree that the electors of Bass have an opportunity to express<br />
a view on a range of national policies and national issues.<br />
They are not general or hypothetical. They are specific issues<br />
which directly affect the well-being of Tasmania, not least the<br />
electorate of Bass and the welfare of all the people living here.<br />
These issues were brought into sharp focus by last week's<br />
Premiers' Conference and related events on the mainland. Those<br />
events raise issues which Nr Fraser can no longer sidestep or<br />
ignore. They are central to this by-election, because they are<br />
central to the whole question of good government of Australia.<br />
For the first time since Federation, arrangements between the<br />
iederal and Tasmanian Governments have enabled Tasmania to<br />
provide standards and services equal to those of the larger States.<br />
The approach of the Australian Labor Government is that through new<br />
co-operative arrangements between the Australian Government and the<br />
State Governments, we shall be able to provide equality of standards,<br />
equality of services, ecuality between States, and equality between<br />
regions within the States.<br />
In pursuit of this objective, there are now over fifty programs<br />
for which the Aus-ralian Government makes specific purpose payments<br />
to Tasmaniao For these, some $ 115 million is provided in the<br />
current year. For specific purposes alone, the per capita payment<br />
to Tasmania in 1974/ 75 was $ 284 compared with the national average<br />
of 0220.<br />
The biggest burden on all State budgets have been schools,<br />
hospitals and railways.<br />
As Miinister for Education and Science in the Mciliahon Government,<br />
Mr Fraser was the foremost opponent of our proposal for a<br />
Schools Commission, the establishment of which has transformed the<br />
outlook and opportunities for education in this country.<br />
He opposed it on the grounds of centralism precisely the same<br />
ground on which the Liberals now oppose our proposals regarding<br />
hospitals and railways. Yet would any Liberal, any State Premier,<br />
or even Mr Fraser himself, now seek to dismantle our education program?<br />
Right up to the deadline or beyond the Liberals stalled on<br />
iMedibank, in the Senate and in their States. Now, the action of<br />
the Legislative Council of South Australia, the most unrepresentative<br />
and undemocratic legislative chamber in any parliamentary system in<br />
the world, in rejecting the agreement between the Federal Government<br />
and the South Australian government for the transfer of the South<br />
Australian railway system, manifests in its grossest form the<br />
obstructionism and negativism of the Liberal approach wherever<br />
their numbers enable them to act. o../ 2 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
We can only judge how the Liberals would act by their performance<br />
in the Senate, the States where they hold power, and now,<br />
so blatantly and destructively, in the Upper House in South<br />
Australia. Co-operation between the Australian and Tasmanian Labor Governments;<br />
on Federal-State financial relations, on Medibank, on the transfer<br />
of railways, will place Tasmania's finances on a permanently sound<br />
foundation.<br />
All this is placed in jeopardy by Liberal obstruction<br />
The contrast between Liberal obstructionism and Labor's efforts.<br />
to find co-operative, constructive solutions is the real national<br />
issue which Mr Fraser can no longer ignore.<br />
