STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, TIlE RON P J KEATING MP<br />
TESTING OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS BY CHINA<br />
Australia condemns the latest test of a nuclear weapon by China.<br />
This test is the second in only three months since the extension of the Treaty on the Non-<br />
Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons ( NPI) in May this year. At the NPT Review and<br />
Extension Conference all nuclear weapons states agreed to exercise ' utmost restraint'<br />
with respect to nuclear testing pending the entry into force of a Comprehensive Test Ban<br />
Treaty in 1996, and to work sincerely towards the elimination of all nuclear weapons.<br />
China's action flies in the face or these undertakings, which it supported at the NP'T<br />
conference. One of the unfortunate consequences of China's decision to continue testing is that<br />
nations which aspire to possess nuclear weapons will question the sincerity of nuclear<br />
weapons states to eventual nuclear disarmament and their interest in developing nuclear<br />
weapons may be reinforced. Such a development would be a serious threat to world<br />
peace. Australia welcortis the recent statement of the ASE AN Regional Forum, which called<br />
on nuclear weapons states to bring an immediate end to nuclear testing, as a clear<br />
expression of regional and international concerns about the continued and unwarranted<br />
testing of nuclear weapons.<br />
Australians are angry that despite the end of the Cold War and the successful extension<br />
of the NPT both China and France have decided to continue testing nuclear weapons.<br />
Our disappointment is the greater because of the restraint exhibited by the other nuclear<br />
weapons states and the fact that these weapons testing programs are occurring at a<br />
critical time in international negotiations on a number of nuclear non-prolireration and<br />
disarmament initiatives.<br />
Australia urges China to cease its nuclear weapons testing program now as both an<br />
important boost to global non-proliferation and disanmament efforts and global security.<br />
