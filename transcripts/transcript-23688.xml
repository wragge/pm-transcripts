    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Government has declared Thursday 7 August 2014 to be a National Day of Mourning to honour the victims of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17.</p>
<p>On this day, flags on all Government buildings, here and overseas, will be flown at half-mast.</p>
<p>The Government has arranged for a National Memorial Service to take place at St Patrick’s Cathedral, Melbourne, at 10.30am on Thursday 7 August 2014.</p>
<p>The Service will honour those who have lost their lives and seek to support those who have been bereaved.</p>
<p>All Australians mourn the loss of Flight MH17.</p>
<p>There were 298 innocent people on this aircraft and their deaths offend our sense of justice.</p>
<p>We grieve for all, but particularly for the 38 men, women and children who called Australia home.</p>
<p>Our hearts go out to all their families. We will support them through the difficult times ahead.</p>
<p>Twenty three million Australians share the sadness of those who mourn.</p>
<p>We are united in grief and in our determination to ensure that justice is done.</p>
<p>Thursday’s National Memorial Service is interdenominational and members of the public are invited to attend.</p>
<p>Arrangements have also been made for the outside broadcast of the National Memorial Service in anticipation of large crowds wanting to support the families of those lost on Flight MH17.</p>
<p>Those wishing to attend the National Memorial Service should contact a Ceremonial and Protocol Officer on (02) 6271 5991 or (02) 6271 5209 or via email at <a href="mailto:MemorialService@pmc.gov.au">MemorialService@pmc.gov.au</a> up until 12 noon on Wednesday 6 August 2014.</p>
