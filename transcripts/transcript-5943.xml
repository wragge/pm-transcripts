P RDIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA FRIDAY, 22 OCTOBER 1982<br />
CIVIC RECEPTION, PORT AUGUSTA<br />
We have had a useful discussion with your council earlier<br />
this morning on a number of matters of their concern and they<br />
will be followed up. You have always shown a very marked<br />
degree of civic pride in this city and I think you have a<br />
great deal of pride in what you have achieved.<br />
You know that our attitude to local government is one which<br />
we have tried to make sure that local government have available<br />
to it the resources which are necessary to meet their own<br />
responsibilities. We don't believe that people in Canberra<br />
can sit down and say well local government must do this or that<br />
and therefore we'll introduce a whole host of programs<br />
which would limit your owqn flexibility. Wie believe<br />
in supplementing the rescurces of local government in a way<br />
which have either made it possible for local governments to<br />
do more of the things that they wanted to do, and if. they<br />
wanted to choose another path in some cases ( inaudible)<br />
made it possible, then not to raise rates by as much as they<br />
otherwise would have had to increase them.<br />
I don't know if I shculd tell-the story but I was visiting<br />
Burke in western NSW on one occasion in 1976-77 and they said<br />
they hadn't put up their rates since 1968, as a farmer that<br />
is an example that I would dearly have loved my own local<br />
government authorities to follow. I amn afraid they had other<br />
ambititions and hadn't attempted to.-<br />
There are significant developmeP~ ts occuring here the Norther<br />
power staftion having a good deal of money spent on it and I<br />
would like to draw attention to the fact that the last Loan<br />
Council and Premiers' Conference, we made decisions that<br />
released the development of electricity authorities from the<br />
shackles of the Commonwealth or Loan Council control and now<br />
it is a matter for the state electricity authorities or for<br />
state governments as to how much money they raise. I don't think<br />
the alleged control of the Loans Council ever really made much<br />
difference because if you didn't get official loan funds the<br />
electricity authority knew how to get the money from . trade<br />
credits for leasing arrangements of one kind or another.<br />
The earlier controls were operating very much.-as a farce.<br />
I suppose that is one of the reasons why we said we should abandon<br />
it and people should do their own thing in a responsible way.<br />
I think it is a sensible change and a sensible -advance because<br />
I don't believe state governments or electricilty authorities are<br />
going to be in the business of erecting power stations just for<br />
the fun of it. They erect power statL-iQls if people are going to use<br />

<p>PORT AUGUSTA<br />
the power and if they start to erect power stations in the<br />
capacity to ( inaudible) and I have no doubt that the<br />
erectors of whatever state it might he waould take it out<br />
on some future occasioa.<br />
That is a sensible devolution of authority of control from<br />
Canberra back where it ought to be in charge of the states,<br />
or particular authorities.<br />
In the last Budget we introduced a new bicentennary roads<br />
progam and it is going to be financed by a special levy under<br />
sunset legislation on distillate and on petrol. I found that<br />
people don'It mind paying that additional levy because it is<br />
going to be a great benefit to road construction around<br />
Australia. Substantial progress will be made with the national<br />
highways program, there will be much greater funds for urban<br />
arterial and rural arterial roads arid there will be additional<br />
funds also available for local government to spend as they<br />
think fit on their own motorways. As we approach the Australian<br />
bicentennial year in 1988 we are going to look forward to a time<br />
when road networks throughout this country is much better than<br />
we had ever dreamt it could be and this will be as a result of<br />
this bicentennial program.<br />
I hope shortly Ralph Hunt will have collected the various proosals.<br />
for construction under the program from all the states and<br />
put them together and then it is proposed there will be a major<br />
launch of the progam in which everyone is going to be able to see<br />
what national highways, what arterial roads,.. what urban transport<br />
proposals are being accepted under the program. About $ 2,500 billion<br />
in all and then, progressively over the next five years we will<br />
be able to see what advances are being made under it.<br />
We are ( inaudible) in the states. We are going to insist that<br />
big construction signs be put up wherever the works are in<br />
progress which indicates that it is some of your bicentennial.<br />
money being spent on road construction. Normally we provide the<br />
money and the states put up the sign ( inaudible) We thought we<br />
would get. in first-and say that the signs are going to l4ave to<br />
go up saying that it is part of the bicentennial program.<br />
In South Australia ( inaudible) funds for roads will go up<br />
substantially over the next two or three years in total.<br />
In 1982/ 83 about an increase of 30% and the next year about<br />
another 30%. In this year the funds for local roads is going<br />
up about 24% and 18% again next year. This is providing a<br />
substantial supplement to the standard road program where<br />
there have been a number of represen tat ions from local government<br />
that not enough was being spent. Everyone is going tobenefit<br />
from this program, not just the people who live in particular<br />
areas, businesses, commerce, mining developments and tourists<br />
who just want to go about this country aid see what they can of<br />
it.<br />
One of the things which holds up exicting prospects for the future<br />
is the development of Roxby Downs. The proposed expenditure is<br />
about $ 1.4 billion. Doug Anthony in answer to a question in the<br />
Parliament this week indicated that there could be between<br />
18,000 jobs during the construction phase, up to<br />
8,000 or a little more during -Che pa-oduction phase and up to<br />
$ 650 million worth of annual production. These are prospects 3<br />

<p>I PORT AUGUSTA-3<br />
that would hold great hopes for development inthe Iron Triangle.<br />
If * Roxby Downs then I have no doubt that David Tonkin will<br />
be pressing firmly to see that the final decision in relation<br />
to uranium enrichment is for a site in this state.<br />
At the moment I still have to be impartial between the states<br />
because I am not sure if David Tonkin on one hand and<br />
Joh Bjelke-Petersen on the other would ( inaudible). The<br />
report that has just been produced indicates that the favoured<br />
site are in South Australia or in Queensland. I know that<br />
David Tonkin has substantial arguments that he put with<br />
great vigour which he believes that South Australia should<br />
have first priority over those sites. I would expect him<br />
to say that but let me only say that I believe the arguments<br />
he puts, he puts with great strength, vigour and they obviously<br />
carry great validity. It would make an enourous amount of<br />
difference for South Australia if you had the Roxby Downs project<br />
going ahead with all the money being spent on it and the jobs and<br />
opportunities for the Iron Triangle and this city, and if that<br />
( inaudible) my decisions in relation to uranium enrichment<br />
it would do an enormous amount for this state. I know that is what<br />
the Premier is working for with all the vigour that he can<br />
command. I hope that you don't think I am being ( inaudible)<br />
butthis could only happen if uranium is mined at Roxby Downs,<br />
it cannot happen otherwise. When you have a situation * in<br />
Europe, Japan and many other places the continued-operating<br />
of their factories, the heating of their homes in winters that<br />
are much colder than anything we have ever found in Australia,<br />
they are becoming increasingly dependent upon power from nuclear<br />
energy, then I really do think it is a ridiculous policy to<br />
say that Australia could not be assisting and providing the<br />
power and the fuel that is necessary for those purposes. It<br />
goes ahead anyway, it will go ahead safer if Australia is<br />
involved in -the business'. than if it is all left to other people.<br />
Policies which show that the uranium industry has to be killed<br />
off, that it cannot proceed, I think are policies of despair<br />
and certainly policies that would deny enormous opportunities<br />
for this city and the. Iron Triangle. These are some of the<br />
questions which South Australia will be making a judgement in<br />
two or three weeks time. I wish I had a few votes in that election<br />
but I don't.<br />
Thank you for your hospitality, I welcomed the opportunity of<br />
meeting you and your council and others of your community<br />
and Tamie and I appreciate your hospitality very much indeed. </p>
