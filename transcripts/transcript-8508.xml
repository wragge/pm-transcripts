PRIME MINISTER<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE MON. P. J. KEATING, NP<br />
MR GREGORY SYMONS<br />
In the light of today's reports of Mr Gregory Symons'<br />
alleged financial status I have asked Senator Richar d son to<br />
provide me with a cvniprehensive report on his involvement<br />
with this matter and provide it to me by Monday.<br />
I continue to accept the Senator's assurances that he sought<br />
and received advice from the Minister for Foreign Affairs<br />
that he would not be behaving improperly to contact Marshall<br />
Islands officials and that he sought no more than to enquire<br />
as to the possibility of Mr Symnons returning to Australia to<br />
collect documents and. prepare his legal defence.<br />
However, in the light of today's reports I believe the<br />
public interest would be beat served if a full report of<br />
these matters is provided by the Senator to mnake clear that<br />
he has behaved In accordance with his Ministerial<br />
responsibilities. Further, I understand that Senator Kerry Sibraa sent a<br />
letter last November through normal channels-to the<br />
Australian Embassy in Washington. That letter requested<br />
assistance in arranging, where possible, meetings for Mr<br />
Symons with appropriate US Governmnent officials and elected<br />
representatives. I believe that given the publicity surrounding this episode<br />
a report from Senator Sibraa is also warranted.<br />
While I am not in a position to require Senator Sibraa to<br />
furnish me with a report he has agreed to do so, also by<br />
Monday. He has told me he intends to report to the Senate on the<br />
same issue on its first day of sitting.<br />

Dear Prime Minister,<br />
As I agreed in my discussions with you please find attached my report concerning<br />
my involvement with Mr Greg Symons.<br />
Yours </p>
<p>REPORT TO THE PRIME MINISTER ON MATTERS RELATING TO MR GREG<br />
SYMONS BY SENATOR KERRY SIBRAA, PRESIDENT OF THE SENATE<br />
On the 12th November 19911I was contacted by Senator Graham Richardson who<br />
asked me whether I could meet a Mr Greg Symons, who he hoped I may be able to<br />
help with some contacts in Washington for his forthcoming business trip. As I was<br />
free at the time, I agreed. Senator Richardson brought Mr Symons around to my<br />
office, introduced us and left.<br />
We exchanged pleasantries for a few minutes and when he mentioned the general<br />
nature of his business I asked my Senior Adviser, Mr Fred Peppinck, to join us. Mr<br />
Symons told Mr Peppinck and myself that he was an Adviser to the President of the<br />
Marshall Islands, and that he had a brief from the Foreign Minister of the Marshall<br />
Islands to discuss business migration to the Marshall Islands when he was in<br />
Washington. He had with him a pile of documentation, some of which he showed<br />
us. The nature of these documents was impressive and confirmed that he had been<br />
given the highest level of authority to negotiate on behalf of the Marshall Islands<br />
Government. In particular, he produced a letter from the Foreign Minister of the<br />
Marshall Islands and the Minister of Resources and Development. He said that he<br />
had no contacts in Washington and he wanted to contact either officials or<br />
Congressmen who had an expertise on Pacific matters.<br />
Mr Peppinck suggested that the best way to assist would be for him to speak with<br />
Mr Chris Lamb, Congressional Liaison Officer in the Australian Embassy in<br />
Washington. We were in frequent contact with Mr Lamb over the matter of<br />
internships for Parliament House, and Mr Peppinck said that next time he was<br />
speaking with Mr Lamb he would mention Mr Symons visit. Mr Symons said that<br />
that would be helpful, and asked that I also write to Mr Lamb. I said that I would<br />
do so.<br />
The next day ( November 13) Mr Peppinck had cause to telephone Mr Lamb in<br />
Washington, and as promised, mentioned Mr Symons visit. Mr Lamb said that he<br />
would be prepared to meet with Mr Symons in Washington and see if he could assist<br />
him. Mr Peppinck then telephoned Mr Symons to let him know of this conversation, and<br />
gave him Mr Lamb's telephone number so that he could ring and arrange an<br />
appointment.<br />
As had been requested by Mr Symons, a letter was drafted which was based upon<br />
the information provided by Mr Symons at the meeting and then again to Mr<br />
Peppinck.<br />
The letter was not a reference. I did only that which I promised to do, that is,<br />
arrange a meeting through the normal channels. I had no reason to doubt his bona<br />
fides. I did not approach any member of the US Government or any other person<br />
on his behalf.<br />
On the morning of the 20th November, upon my arrival back in my Parliament<br />
House office, the letter was given to me to sign along with other routine items that </p>
<p>had accumulated since the preceding Friday.<br />
I signed the letter and it was faxed to Mr Lamb the same day.<br />
From that point on there was no further contact between myself or my office and<br />
any of the parties involved.<br />
I was not contacted by Senator Richardson to see whether I had been of any<br />
assistance, I was not contacted by the Department of Foreign Affairs, nor Mr Lamb,<br />
nor was there any further contact with Mr Symons. Because of my absence from the<br />
country it was not until Question Time on Monday 4 May 1992 that I became aware<br />
that Senator Richardson's association with Mr Symons was being questioned. I<br />
recalled having met him at some stage, but thought no more of it.<br />
The question to the Foreign Minister at Question Time on Thursday 7 May<br />
concerning " ithe nature of any dealings between Senator Richardson's friend, Mr<br />
Greg Symons, and the Australian Embassy or consulates in the United States of<br />
America", prompted me to ask my office whether we had done anything for Mr<br />
Symons as a result of my having met him. My staff began checking immediately.<br />
That afternoon and evening was a very busy one. After question time I had guests<br />
to meet, then various meetings, the 9th Anniversary of the Opening of the<br />
Parliament House Reception at which I had to speak, and a private dinner in my<br />
suite. I left Canberra early the following ( Friday) morning.<br />
Late Friday afternoon Mr Peppinck contacted me to let me know that a letter from<br />
myself to Mr Lamb had been located, and a copy of it was sent to me the following<br />
Saturday morning.<br />
My reaction to reading the letter I had signed was that it was something I do all the<br />
time, however in retrospect, and with the benefit of hindsight I believe it may have<br />
been worded more carefully. The letters he brought with him convinced both myself<br />
and my Senior Adviser that he was genuine. As said previously, the contents of my<br />
letter were as told to myself and Mr Peppinck, and I had no reason to doubt Mr<br />
Symons' credentials.<br />
I might add, had a Senior Opposition Senator asked me to do so, I would have done<br />
exactly the same.<br />
This is the first time I have ever provided any assistance to Mr Symons, and it<br />
consisted of simply referring him to an Australian Government official. </p>

Dear Mr. Symons<br />
We refer to your project to establish a Technology Park in the<br />

the Business Migration Investment Trust to be known as the<br />
Marshall Islands Investment Trust (" the Trust") The trust would<br />
be responsible for the marketing, development and management of<br />
the Technology Park including value added and transhipment<br />
activities and a University Study Centre known as " 1UNIPAC<br />

As you know the Republic of the Marshall Islands Revised Code<br />
allows the grant of citizenship to a " class of persons" where<br />
there is a substantial benefit deemed to accrue to the Marshall<br />
Islands economy.<br />
We recognize that the development of a technology park would have<br />
benefits for the Republic of the Marshall Islands and the<br />
investors may apply for citizenship pursuant to the provisions of<br />
the Code.<br />
The following program for the marketing, development, financing<br />
and management will be supported by the Government of the<br />
Republic of the Marshall Islands, subject to formal agreements<br />
incorporating the concepts below, and subject to the formal<br />
agreements the parties agree that they will work together to<br />
implement the same:<br />
1. Your company is to establish the Trust and representative<br />
offices in Sydney and Hong Kong to market the project and<br />
undertake the development financing and management of the<br />
project. Such offices will support the work of the Trust and its<br />
representatives. </p>
<p>Mr. Gregory B. Symons<br />

provision of utilities.<br />
4. The Government will provide a Sovereign guarantee to the<br />
Trust in respect of monies advanced to the Republic of the<br />
Marshall Islands.<br />
The first stage of the development of the project is to cost<br />
$ 13540 million, and Multiplex Constructions Pty. Ltd. will be<br />
appointed by the Trust as project managers/ contractors for the<br />
project. 6. In respect of Business Migration the parties will work<br />
exclusively together on the Trust and Technology Park and will<br />
ensure quick processing of applications for business migration by<br />
investors in the trust. The Trust, after consultation with the<br />
Government, will be responsible for processing applications<br />
including design of the forms for submission to the Government<br />
for the grant of citizenship for approved persons.<br />
7. The parties will work together to ensure concessions under<br />
the Compact of Free Association and tax and duty concessions are<br />
available to users of the Technology Park and to ensure employees<br />
of subsidiary corporations of the Trust ( and users of the<br />
Technology Park) in the U. S. A. are able to work and reside in the<br />
U. S. A. pursuant to the laws and statutes and treaties of the<br />
U. S. A. and the Republic of the Marshall Islands governing such<br />
employment. S. The Government will ensure that plant, equipment and<br />
personnel are admitted to the Technology Park with duty tax and<br />
other concessions as are available elsewhere in the Pacific rim.<br />
