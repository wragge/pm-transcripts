TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
INTERVIEW WITH PAUL LYNEHAM, THE 7.30 REPORT<br />
14 FEBRUARY 1995<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
PL: Prime Minister, welcome to the program.<br />
PM: Thank you Paul.<br />
PL: Do you endorse the decision to have the Federal police investigate the<br />
leaking of the Department of Finance spending cut options?<br />
PM: The Federal Police go chasing Commonwealth property generally<br />
stolen Commonwealth property and this is stealth of highly<br />
confidential and important Government information.<br />
PL: If the leakers are found, what should happen to them, in you view?<br />
PM: Well they will be handled by the law, or whatever.<br />
PL: Prosecuted?<br />
PM: However it applies.<br />
PL: Peter Costello says you are trying to use the Federal Police to " rough<br />
up the Opposition".<br />
PM: Well he would, wouldn't he? I notice he is saying today it's not stolen<br />
property well it's the very essence of stolen property. And if the<br />
Opposition wants to handle stolen property, then that's their business.<br />
But the more important thing is the way they are handling the issue,<br />
and I think what this reveals is that John Howard hasn't changed one<br />
jot since the last time he was Opposition Leader the<br />
opportunism.. he is now opposed to interest rate increases, he is<br />
opposed to tax increases revenue rises he's opposed to spending </p>
<p>cuts. He's opposed to everything that makes for changes and<br />
variables in budgets. Yet he knows that getting the nation's budget<br />
right is one of the most important thing a Government can<br />
PL: Don't Oppositions often do that sort of thing?<br />
PM: Not when you get a second go a second chance, as Mr Howard has<br />
been given you would think he would . it's the same opportunism<br />
that had him in the eighties in 87 when we were in the middle of a big<br />
structural change and a big fall in commodity prices say smugly " the<br />
times will suit me", in other words I will climb up on the back of public<br />
distress the same opportunism that had him say we should cut the<br />
Asian intake, and it's the same opportunism now that says " What I'll do<br />
is I actually believe in spending cuts, but I'll try and scare the wits out<br />
of everybody who might be a beneficiary, and so I don't".<br />
PL: He's backed totally off that Asian stuff he said he got that wrong, he's<br />
done a big mea cu/ pa on that, shouldn't you let that one go?<br />
PM: My claim is not that he is a racist I don't believe that at all it's just<br />
that he couldn't resist the temptation the opportunism of saying<br />
when he thought it was palatable, that we should cut the intake. You<br />
have got to remember this it was 20 years since the White Australia<br />
Policy had been suspended, he was the only significant national<br />
politician to say, in any way, that race should be a factor in the<br />
selection of the migration intake. It's just that John Howard was<br />
dismissed from the leadership in 1989 they didn't take him in 1990<br />
they gave it to John Hewson. In 1993 when Hewson lost, they gave it<br />
to Hewson again they wouldn't have Howard. In fact, they rejected<br />
Howard when he ran against him. They then gave it to Alexander<br />
Downer. So for 6 years they have said he is not good enough, but now<br />
all of a sudden he is all they have. And what does he do? Within 2<br />
weeks of getting the job, back on the old track of opportunism trying to<br />
suggest that the Government shouldn't be cutting outlays when it's the<br />
very thing he has been enjoining us to do.<br />
PL: He says the leaked material shows you have been hypocritical about<br />
the scope for spending cuts, and the sort of cuts that you're prepared<br />
to consider.<br />
PM: Well you and I know what a nonsense that is, Paul, because these lists<br />
are produced I mean, I have been a member of this Government for<br />
12 years, and in every year, there is some sort of primary list<br />
developed by officials of this variety. But I'll tell you what it does<br />
reveal you notice that there is no big easy they will notice.. . you all<br />
now know there is no big spending option which says: " Waste and<br />
duplication $ 5 billion or $ 10 billion". All this is about is cutting<br />
programs, cutting benefits, and that is what we have said for years if<br />
you want to cut outlays so when John Howard walks around saying<br />
or Mr Costello " we should cut $ 11-12 billion out of outlays", what </p>
<p>they're saying is we ought to be cutting into these programs. But I'll<br />
give you a little tip a little bet when the Budget comes down, you<br />
know what they will say then? " Wimps. Wimps"....<br />
PL: In a way, they have softened the ground for you?<br />
PM:.. they're saying " here's all these big spending cuts", they're now<br />
saying to people " they might make against you", when in fact the<br />
Government has always been very careful about equity. And when the<br />
Budget is presented when we don't take most of those options, they<br />
will say " oh, they have wimped out".<br />
PL: But how are you going to meet the imperatives of equity on one hand,<br />
and the market on the other, which wants to see that budget deficit<br />
down in a hell of a hurry now?<br />
PM: The Government will do, as the Treasurer said Paul, we will... . we have<br />
got a lot of experience at this. This is our twelfth Budget we have<br />
had 8 May statements that is 20 major economic statements, and if I<br />
put One Nation, and Investing in the Nation, and then Working Nation,<br />
then that is about 23 major budgetary-type statements. So we will do<br />
the professional job that I think we have always done, but we will get<br />
the balance right.<br />
PL: And unless you catch the leaker soon you could have leaks against<br />
you much tighter in the budget process when you are making real<br />
decisions. That's your big worry there, isn't it?<br />
PM: Mr Howard had the biggest leak of all. His actual budget was leaked.<br />
So, this is options not seen by Ministers and not taken by the Cabinet.<br />
PL: But what if we get past the options phase and they are still leaking?<br />
That's a real security problem.<br />
PM: Well, it is a problem. The thing I would say to John Howard is it's<br />
important for the country that the country gets the budget right. He can<br />
make a judgment about it when it is presented but he is back in<br />
Opposition and he should do at least one thing right. And that is not<br />
run around and make the process harder and spread to the four winds<br />
of the media trying to pretend that beneficiaries and the sick and the<br />
elderly are somehow going to be preyed upon or their income savagely<br />
reduced.<br />
PL: He is having a pretty good honeymoon in the opinion polls today, isn't<br />
he? I mean it does suggest, surely, that there is a desire out in the<br />
community for a strong alternative to Labor?<br />
PM: Well, it's the honeymoon poll isn't it. Alexander Downer had an even<br />
greater margin. By the way, the Sydney Morning Herald had two front<br />
page stories on the poll: one ten days ago and one today. The same </p>
<p>story with Mr Downer. It is almost in the same print style and the same<br />
words, only the name has changed.<br />
PL: But it may reflect the same desire in the community to see someone<br />
who can take the fight up to you.<br />
PM: You have got a new Opposition Leader although one who is well and<br />
truly been around before. The Government has had a couple of weeks<br />
of difficulties, but let me remind you of this Paul from The Bulletin, " Mr<br />
18 per cent. Why does this man bother?". He got the Opposition<br />
approval rating, his approval rating, down to 18 per cent. People<br />
should remember, as I said, he tries to pretend Mr Howard, he hasn't a<br />
past, the sort of Ronald Biggs of the Liberal Party, you know " I haven't<br />
robbed a train. I don't have a past. Here I am in a tropical shirt. It's<br />
not really me" It is really him and all the nasties that he supported in<br />
the 1980s are going to be back there now: cutting people's wages,<br />
individual wage contracts, the works.<br />
PL: Prime Minister against Bob Hawke he campaigned very well in ' 87. He<br />
is going to give you a run for your money.<br />
PM: I gave him the king hit in ' 87. That was the Box Hill tax package. At<br />
the time, of course, he was hopping into me in the Parliament. I<br />
passed him in the corridor one day and I said to him in the Parliament,<br />
I said, " Well, you know you hurt me with those remarks." He put a list<br />
out of all the nasty things I was supposed to have said over twenty<br />
years and I said " But I blew you apart back in Box Hill and denied you<br />
the Prime Ministership." Fair exchange I would have thought.<br />
PL: Yesterday's violence in the Southeast forests of New South Wales has<br />
been widely deplored, not apparently though by Mr Cole Dorber, of the<br />
New South Wales Forest Products Association. What is your<br />
response?<br />
PM: I thought it was deplorable. People who belt people in the face ought<br />
to be charged. And people who encourage them to belt should be<br />
charged too.<br />
PL: But if your Ministers hadn't had their own rivalry out there in public and<br />
got everyone into fixed positions and got the temperature up so much,<br />
surely the whole thing would be a lot more calm and reasonable?<br />
PM: It's not the Ministers, it's the issues.<br />
PL: They handled it well?<br />
PM: If we had a chance of doing this over again, of course, we would. But<br />
remember this. The issues are that we've got a diminishing number of<br />
stands of native forests. Now what I want is what most Australians<br />
want. That is, I want to see the best stands of native forests protected </p>
<p>and yet I want to see a continuation of a sustainable forest products<br />
industry. There is a halfway house in there but it isn't with the<br />
extremists of the Wilderness Society or trying to pretend there are 800<br />
stands being desecrated which is untrue. There are not 800 stands of<br />
pristine trees left off the...<br />
PL: All of the so-called Eco-terrorists sabotaging logging equipment,<br />
putting spikes in trees. One can understand a certain amount of<br />
frustration on the part of these logging people.<br />
PM: Absolutely, you can understand the frustration. But again, the society<br />
we have is one that doesn't condone that sort of violence and to have<br />
an industry association condoning it is, I think, pretty pathetic.<br />
PL: Is Kerry Packer testing the Government's resolve on the issue of<br />
cross-media ownership with his 16.4 per cent stake in Fairfax?<br />
PM: I have no idea. I didn't know he had 16.4 per cent of Fairfax. I knew<br />
he had 15 per cent but if as you say, you're asserting, are you, that he<br />
is the one who has bought the stock?<br />
PL: But, he put out a statement?<br />
PM: Oh, did he? I didn't see it.<br />
PL: If the ABA said it was OK for him to have more than 15 per cent, what<br />
would the Government say?<br />
PM: Well, the Government would think about it but the ABA has got to<br />
make a judgment about this. There is a set of statutes in place called<br />
the cross-media rules and they are administered by the ABA.<br />
PL: He reportedly believes he can't be seen to have effective control until<br />
his holding gets a bit closer to Conrad Black's and surely that does<br />
make sense, doesn't it?<br />
PM: It depends whether he has got Board representation, I think.<br />
PL: There are reports that Conrad Black has told your Government that<br />
unless he can lift his stake to 35 per cent, he is off?<br />
PM: Well, not that I know of. Let me say, I have been happily, I might say,<br />
above this particular fray.<br />
PL: Thanks for your time.<br />
PM: Good.<br />
