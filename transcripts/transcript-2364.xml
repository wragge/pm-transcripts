FOR PRESS PM. -No. 16/ 1071<br />
ECONOMIC CONSULTATIONS<br />
Statemnentb th e P rime Minister, Mr John Gorton<br />
Ministers met today with representatives of<br />
industry and commerce and the consultations will continue tomorrow.<br />
Today's discussions were with representatives of<br />
national organisations in three separate groups representing primary<br />
industry, manufacturing industry and commerce. Discussions will<br />
be held tomorrow with the Export Development Council, the<br />
Manufacturing Industries Advisory Council and the Australian Council<br />
of Trade Urions. Against the background of the problem of<br />
inflationary pressures in the economy, today's consultations have<br />
been particularly useful in informing Ministers of the way in which<br />
those directly engaged in industry and commerce see the present<br />
situation, the measures already announced by the Government and the<br />
prospective developments. A list of those who participated in today's talks<br />
is attached.<br />
