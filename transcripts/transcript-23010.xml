    <content><![CDATA[<p>Thanks Dwayne and thanks ladies and gentlemen.</p>
<p>I am very honoured and thrilled on this day-of-days in Australian sport to address my first North Melbourne Grand Final Breakfast as Prime Minister.</p>
<p>But Iâm under no illusions about my standing.</p>
<p>Australians love their sporting heroes but, at most, merely tolerate their politicians, so I want to thank you for making me so welcome today.</p>
<p>Itâs always good to be here in Melbourne.</p>
<p>Melburnians have a way of keeping Sydneysiders in their place. I ran into a great Melburnian, Lindsay Fox, yesterday who congratulated me on the election. "Once," he said, "you were just a would be/could be, and now youâre a future has been."</p>
<p>I often think having politicians address sports breakfasts makes as much sense as having sportsmen address parliament, but having just listened to Andrew Demetriou, Iâm confident that politics has at least as much to learn from sport as the other way around. Thank you for that gracious speech, Andrew.</p>
<p>Itâs good to see people here in such numbers and with such enthusiasm because I know it has been a tough year for the AFL. Some people were even charged with bringing the game into disrepute. Iâm grateful, I really am, that thereâs no offence of bringing parliament into disrepute because I fear all MPs might be guilty.</p>
<p>But it hasnât been all bad news this year.</p>
<p>My team, Greater Western Sydney, has done incredibly well â with one win. Sometimes you only need one win to have a great year and Kevin Sheedy tells me that next year will be even better.</p>
<p>I congratulate the Fremantle Dockers on making their first ever grand final and I congratulate the Hawthorn Hawks for making their second grand final in a row.</p>
<p>My philosophy is that if you lose one big event you deserve to win the next one. So, I'm going for the Hawks today.</p>
<p>But I gather thereâs something in AFL called âKennettâs Curse.â I canât believe there would be anything called 'Kennettâs Curse' because Jeff is a terrific person, I love him, but whatever 'Kennett's Curse' might be, letâs hope no one suffers from it today.</p>
<p>Today is a celebration of all thatâs good in sport.</p>
<p>Today is a chance to marvel at that spirit; to strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield.</p>
<p>Whoever wins, it will certainly be a great game of football.</p>
<p>Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen.</p>
