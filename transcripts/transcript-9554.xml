PRIME MINJISTER 34/ 95<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
APPOINTMENT OF AUDITOR-GENERAL<br />
I will shortly be recommending to the Administrator of the Government of the<br />
Commonwealth an appointment to the office of Auditor-General.<br />
The new Auditor-General will be Mr Pat Barrett AM, a distinguished senior<br />
public servant, and currently Deputy Secretary to the Department of Finance.<br />
Mr Barrett has had major responsibilities across the range of Commonwealth<br />
activity, including for such reform initiatives as the Financial Management<br />
Improvement Program, Program Management and Budgeting, and Program<br />
Evaluation. He is a Fellow of the Australian Society of Certified Practising<br />
Accountants, and the Royal Institute of Public Administration in Australia. He<br />
was appointed a Member of the Order of Australia in the 1992 Australia Day<br />
Honours List, for his contribution to public administration.<br />
Although the office of Auditor-General has been vacant since January when<br />
Mr John Taylor AO retired, the Government has held off appointing his<br />
replacement in the hope that it would be possible to do so within a<br />
reasonable time in accordance with the provisions of the replacement<br />
legislation currently before the Parliament. Amendments made in the Senate<br />
to the Auditor-General Bill 1994 suggest that it may be some time before a<br />
new Act is in place, and the Government has therefore decided that it cannot<br />
leave this important position vacant any longer.<br />
In accordance with the provisions of the proposed replacement legislation, it<br />
is intended that the appointee's term of office be limited to seven years,<br />
rather than to age 65 as the existing legislation provides. The Government<br />
hopes that the Parliament will pass the necessary amendments as soon as<br />
possible. I wish Mr Barrett well in his appointment, which will take effect from<br />
2 May 1995.<br />
