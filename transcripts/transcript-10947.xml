<p>Thank you very much. To His Worship, the Mayor and Mrs Hardwick,</p>
<p>   to Mr Don Randall, the Federal Member for Swan, to my many other</p>
<p>   Federal and State Parliamentary colleagues, ladies and gentlemen,</p>
<p>   and also a special acknowledgment to the officers of that great</p>
<p>   regiment, the SAS, for their magnificent landing this morning and</p>
<p>   the magnificent contribution that they've made to this lovely</p>
<p>   ceremony. </p>
<p>One of the many privileges of the office of Prime Minister is to</p>
<p>   have the opportunity to celebrate Australia Day with a different</p>
<p>   group of Australians each year. Last year, I had the opportunity</p>
<p>   of celebrating Australia Day at a similar ceremony to this on the</p>
<p>   seaside just outside of Adelaide, and today I am in this beautiful</p>
<p>   spot in South Perth, against the backdrop of the Swan River and</p>
<p>   of the city of Perth, and in the presence of a number of men and</p>
<p>   women who have paid us as Australians the ultimate complement, and</p>
<p>   that is that they have decided to become Australian citizens. </p>
<p>For those of us who were born in Australia, it was not a matter</p>
<p>   of our choice, but rather an accident of birth of which we have</p>
<p>   grown to love and to cherish and to embrace as we have grown older</p>
<p>   and appreciated the enormous benefits of living in this country.</p>
<p>   There is a special act of embracing, a special act of acknowledgment</p>
<p>   on the part of people who choose to live in this country and I want,</p>
<p>   on behalf of all your soon-to-be fellow Australians to welcome all</p>
<p>   of you into the family of the Australian nation, to assure you that</p>
<p>   you have made the most wise, intelligent and far-sighted decision</p>
<p>   of your life to become Australian citizens and to assure you that</p>
<p>   of all the qualities of the Australian nation, the open, tolerant</p>
<p>   and positive embrace of people from all parts of the Earth is a</p>
<p>   very distinguishing and a very important characteristic of the fabric</p>
<p>   of the Australian nation.</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, it is inevitable on an occasion such as this</p>
<p>   that we should pause for a moment and think about Australia. We</p>
<p>   think about the past, we take pride in those things that we have</p>
<p>   achieved and the Australian achievement has been a saga of great</p>
<p>   proportion. We have achieved an enormous amount as a nation. We</p>
<p>   have built in this country something special. It is unique to be</p>
<p>   an Australian. At the present time, Australia occupies a unique</p>
<p>   intersection of history, geography, culture and economic circumstance.</p>
<p>   There is no nation on Earth that totally embraces in that sense</p>
<p>   linkages with Europe, linkages with North America, and also linkages</p>
<p>   with the Asian Pacific region.</p>
<p>  There are many great tributaries to the Australian nation. We acknowledge</p>
<p>   on this day the enormous contribution of the indigenous people of</p>
<p>   our nation and we thank them for that contribution, and all Australians</p>
<p>   share the goal of genuine, on-going reconciliation between all of</p>
<p>   the people of Australia. We also recognise the tremendous contribution</p>
<p>   of those people who defended this country in war and laid down their</p>
<p>   lives for the preservation of the liberty of Australians. And of</p>
<p>   course, we welcome the people who have embraced Australia from the</p>
<p>   four corners of the Earth.</p>
<p>  When you think about Australia, you not only think of the symbols</p>
<p>   of Australia. A nation is made up of symbols and of celebrations</p>
<p>   of important events. That's a very important part of the fabric</p>
<p>   of a nation. But symbols, important though they are, are not quite</p>
<p>   as important as the character and the substance of a nation. And</p>
<p>   over the next few weeks, as the Mayor said, we as a country are</p>
<p>   going to talk about some of the symbols of our democracy. We are</p>
<p>   not going to talk about democracy in the sense of debating whether</p>
<p>   or not we are going to preserve democracy. I don't think there</p>
<p>   are many people in Australia who argue that other than we should</p>
<p>   fully preserve and perpetuate democracy as the best form of Government</p>
<p>   but we are going to debate the symbols, we are going to debate whether</p>
<p>   or not a system of government which has delivered immense stability</p>
<p>   and cohesion during the almost 100 years of the Australian Federation</p>
<p>   should be changed because some in the community, a significant number</p>
<p>   indeed, think that the symbolism rather than the substance of that</p>
<p>   system is in need of change.</p>
<p>Now there are issues that properly belong to debate and as I have</p>
<p>   said regularly, on behalf of the Government and I think I echo the</p>
<p>   views of all Australians in saying that at the end of the day, the</p>
<p>   question of whether or not this country is to become a republic</p>
<p>   is something that will be determined by the Australian people voting</p>
<p>   in an open democracy and by no other group of people, and that of</p>
<p>   course is how it should be.</p>
<p>But important though those symbols are and important though the</p>
<p>   symbols of a country are, I think even more important to me and</p>
<p>   to a lot of Australians, is not so much the symbols of the Australian</p>
<p>   nation in the 21st century but rather the character of the Australian</p>
<p>   nation in the 21st century because what really determines the place</p>
<p>   of a nation in the history, of the peoples of the world, what really</p>
<p>   determines the sense of worth and decency and self-respect that</p>
<p>   we have about our country is really the character of our nation.</p>
<p>   And what our nation stands for, its values and the beliefs it holds</p>
<p>   dear, are more important than what the symbols that mark that nation</p>
<p>   may be, significant though those symbols are.</p>
<p>As we go towards the 21st century, the character of the Australian</p>
<p>   nation is ultimately going to be shaped, in my opinion, by the way</p>
<p>   in which we work out the relationship between our government, of</p>
<p>   whatever political persuasion it may be from time to time, the community</p>
<p>   and individual men and women of Australia. It is the balance and</p>
<p>   the relationship between the government, the community and the individual</p>
<p>   that will ultimately shape the character of Australia.</p>
<p>Governments cannot shape national character. Governments cannot</p>
<p>   legislate to change the human heart. Governments cannot legislate</p>
<p>   to change the character of a people. But that does not mean that</p>
<p>   governments do not have an important role to play. That does not</p>
<p>   mean that governments cannot set examples; governments cannot lead</p>
<p>   where it is appropriate for governments to lead. They do have a</p>
<p>   role. But also a very important role in shaping the character of</p>
<p>   Australia will be role of our great community organisations.</p>
<p>This gathering of Australians out in the open air on the morning</p>
<p>   of the 26th of January is a magnificent expression of the sort of</p>
<p>   people we are. This occasion is open to everybody. This occasion</p>
<p>   welcomes people of all different backgrounds, be they different</p>
<p>   ethnic backgrounds, different religious backgrounds, different political</p>
<p>   backgrounds, different societal backgrounds. We are gathered together</p>
<p>   in an open, egalitarian, free fashion. It is one of the distinguishing</p>
<p>   characteristics of the Australian nation. </p>
<p>We are a nation of communities. We are a nation of volunteers and</p>
<p>   as I look back over the last year, I think the efforts that moved</p>
<p>   me most amongst all Australians over the last year were the efforts</p>
<p>   of those volunteers who inspired us and comforted us in times of</p>
<p>   tragedy, whether it was the bushfires, the tragedies in other parts</p>
<p>   of Australia, and most particularly, that awful tragedy at Thredbo</p>
<p>   in July of this year. And that volunteer effort, that community</p>
<p>   spirit, is something very deep and very strong and governments need</p>
<p>   community organisations, they need the churches, they need the other</p>
<p>   volunteer organisations and, of course, the most important institution</p>
<p>   of all in our society and that is the institution of the Australian</p>
<p>   family is the most viable and the most enduring and the most stabilising</p>
<p>   part of our entire community.</p>
<p>[Aerial flyover]</p>
<p>That's the most innovative interjection I've ever had!</p>
<p>So, any government needs a strong community and lastly and most</p>
<p>   importantly, governments and communities also need free, achieving,</p>
<p>   successful, inspired individuals. There is nothing so powerful in</p>
<p>   any community as an individual who is determined to succeed and</p>
<p>   who is determined to contribute something to his or her society.</p>
<p>And individuals, of course, not only have rights but they also</p>
<p>   have responsibilities, and individuals making a contribution to</p>
<p>   the Australian community, achieving to the best of their talents</p>
<p>   and their abilities. As I've participated in ceremonies to</p>
<p>   mark the award of the Young Australian of the Year, a young girl</p>
<p>   who came to Australia from Vietnam when she was aged 4, and of course</p>
<p>   to the Australian of the Year here in Perth yesterday to Cathy Freeman,</p>
<p>   somebody who has captured the heart of every Australian because</p>
<p>   of her marvellous contribution to Australian life and to Australian</p>
<p>   achievement, one is reminded of the tremendous array of talent and</p>
<p>   ability which abounds in Australia</p>
<p>So ladies and gentlemen as we look towards the 21st century, the</p>
<p>   symbols that we embrace for the 21st century, whether they are the</p>
<p>   same as we have had in the 20th century or whether they are somewhat</p>
<p>   altered or partly or entirely altered, they are things for the Australian</p>
<p>   people after proper debate to decide, and I do not intend to introduce</p>
<p>   into this Australia Day observance any particular partisan debate</p>
<p>   on that. Another time and another place will be the opportunity</p>
<p>   for me to renew the expostulation of my own views on those subjects.</p>
<p>But let me simply say that important though the symbols of our</p>
<p>   country are, even more important will be the character of our country</p>
<p>   as we move into the 21st century, and that character will be ultimately</p>
<p>   shaped by the extent to which with goodwill, the government of the</p>
<p>   day, the community organisations and the individual can - each in</p>
<p>   their respective roles - play a very important part, a shared endeavour</p>
<p>   to build a good and strong and decent Australian society is the</p>
<p>   goal of those three segments of our great nation..</p>
<p>Therefore, ladies and gentlemen, can I thank the City of South</p>
<p>   Perth, can I thank Don Randall in particular for the invitation</p>
<p>   that came through him to attend this ceremony. Can I say how much</p>
<p>   Janette and I are enjoying the celebration of the Australia Day</p>
<p>   weekend here in Western Australia. It is the first opportunity I</p>
<p>   have had in any capacity to celebrate Australia Day here in Perth.</p>
<p>   We are enjoying it immensely, we have a full programme of activities</p>
<p>   ahead of us, including a very brief visit to a particular cricketing</p>
<p>   fixture at the WACA this afternoon and can I also say, on behalf</p>
<p>   of both of us, a very happy Australia Day to all of you and very</p>
<p>   especially to those who are becoming Australians for the first time</p>
<p>   today, thank you for honouring us with embracing the great Australian</p>
<p>   way of life. </p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>[ENDS]</p>
