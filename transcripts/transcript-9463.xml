TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
DOORSTOP, MUSEUM OF CONTEMPORARY ART, SYDNEY<br />
JANUARY 1995<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
PMV: I am quite happy to respond to any questions you might have.<br />
J: Mr Downer~ s difficulties how do you feel about the prospect of facing John<br />
Howard across the floor?<br />
PMV: I keep saying and let me be entirely consistent and say again the<br />
problem with the Uberal Party Is not the jockey, but the horse. The Uberal<br />
Party Is now seriously rent by divisions, even In this latest episode more<br />
bad blood has been created It Is a party divided In Itseif, It now lacks a<br />
philosophy, It doesn't know what It wishes to do with Australia. It Is in much<br />
the same state as the UAP was In the early 1940s, and Mr Howard's return<br />
will only continue the fracas that has existed every year since he claimed<br />
the leadership for the first time.<br />
J: Would you be determined in your own words to crucify him?<br />
PMV: I will not respond to silly pap questions like that.<br />
J: But would you....<br />
PM: But let me just say John Howard will try to take Australia back to the<br />
country and the values he believes In, which will all be about rugged<br />
Individualism Initially, and then private reward fracturing that sense of nation<br />
and unity, that sense of compassion for those not as well off those<br />
egalitarian values which make Australia. The Important thing Is In this<br />
turmoil In the U-beral Party I think It Is Important for the public to know that<br />
the Government has Its hand well and truly on the rudder. And that<br />
Australia has just completed probably Its best economic year since the War<br />
W1% growth and 2% Inflation, the highest employment growth after any<br />
recession we have ever had, the highest productivity growth probably In<br />
years, and I hope to see the continuation of that through 1995. So, they </p>
<p>may be the cork bobbing around, but the Government has a sure hand In<br />
the directions the country is taking.<br />
J: Prime Minister, do you expect to see the resurfacing of the immigration<br />
debate now that John Howard Is back In town?<br />
PM: John Howard will try and remake himself when he was asked after those<br />
remarks on Immigration to withdraw them, he said " not on your life". The<br />
Australian pamphleteering for him a week or so ago gave him the<br />
opportunity of what he called an apology... look, John Howard hasn't<br />
changed his views. When John says he didn't mean it, you say : sure you<br />
didn't Johnny sure you didn't".<br />
J: Prime Minister, are you tempted to go to a snap poll?<br />
PM: Well about as tempted as I have been by every other question Inviting me<br />
to do that.<br />
J: Prime Minister on Arthur Boyd as Australian of the Year?<br />
PM: Arthur Is a great Australian a great figure and a great interpreter of the<br />
Australian landscape, and of the Australian soul I think. A person who<br />
understood much about the ethos of Australia, and created that diversity<br />
perhaps unity in his painting between Australia the old ancient country<br />
of Australia. this landscape, and the European civillisation where most of us<br />
are from. And I think he has been singularly successful at that, and the<br />
prodigious energy in his retrospective just a year or so ago, you could see<br />
how over 60 years just how much this man has produced, and how he has<br />
Interpreted our lives.<br />
J: It's true, though, that he is more of an English resident these days?<br />
PM: But look at the pictures they are all about the Australian bush, they're all<br />
about Australian legends, and they are all about things that seek to define<br />
this country.<br />
J: What did you think about. inaudible. comments about changing Australia<br />
Day do you have any sympathy for that?<br />
PM: Well, the 26th of January has that historic presence about it, but I think that<br />
the whole country is understanding more now particularly post-Mabo<br />
about reconciliation, about us being one nation and one country, and this Is<br />
a matter, no doubt, that over time Australians will think about and maybe<br />
meet John's view.<br />
ends. </p>
