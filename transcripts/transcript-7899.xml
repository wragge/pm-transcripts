SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
PARLIAMENTARY DINNER FOR PRIME MINISTER RYZHKOV<br />
CANBERRA 14 FEBRUARY 1990<br />
Prime Minister Ryzhkov and Madam Ryzhkova<br />
Parliamentary Colleagues<br />
Ladies and gentlemen<br />
On behalf of the Government and the people of Australia, let<br />
me say, Mr Prime Minister, how pleased and honoured we feel<br />
that, at this historic time in the affairs of your own<br />
nation and of the world, you have journeyed to Australia for<br />
this visit.<br />
The relationship between our two countries has matured in a<br />
dramatic way in recent years, and in a way that can only be<br />
to the lasting benefit of the people of Australia and of the<br />
Soviet Union.<br />
Your visit will strengthen that relationship even further,<br />
Mr Prime Minister. Let me assure you that you and Madam<br />
Ryzhkova are most welcome guests to Canberra and to<br />
Australia. I trust the warmth of our welcome to you, and our<br />
constructive and frank dialogue with you, have shown how<br />
well Australians understand the magnitude of the changes you<br />
are working in the Soviet Union, and how positively we are<br />
responding to them.<br />
The Australian Government stands ready to expand and<br />
diversify our bilateral relationship; the Australian<br />
corporate sector is eager to build commercial links; and the<br />
Australian people are keen to build the foundations of<br />
friendship. I recall with pleasure the stimulating discussions I held in<br />
1987 in Canberra with Foreign Minister Shevardnadze, and<br />
later in Moscow with Mikhail Gorbachev, you, and your<br />
colleagues talks which built a genuine and personal trust<br />
and confidence between us.<br />
CHECK AGAINST nFLIVERY </p>
<p>In those talks in Moscow, we reviewed your programs of<br />
perestroika and glasnost, and we discussed the welcome<br />
progress that had been made in arms control, the reduction<br />
of regional tensions, the opening up of economic<br />
opportunities, and the steady improvement in Soviet human<br />
rights. It seemed then, in 1987, that your nation had already<br />
achieved very significant changes, in both its domestic and<br />
international policies.<br />
How modest that conclusion seems now, as we meet again just<br />
two years later!<br />
Both within the Soviet Union and in Eastern Europe the pace<br />
of reform has been, simply, breathtaking. You have not only<br />
reshaped the face of your own region, but fundamentally<br />
transformed the very landscape of the world order that has<br />
been familiar since the end of the Second World War.<br />
We have seen the wall between the Federal Republic of<br />
Germany and the German Democratic Republic, for so long a<br />
symbol of the division of Europe, come down. We have seen<br />
the democratic aspirations of Eastern Europe met and, with<br />
the tragic exception of Romania, we have seen them met<br />
peacefully. We have seen Communist Parties in the GDR,<br />
Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia agree to compete in<br />
multi-party elections for newly resurgent Parliaments.<br />
And we have seen the Soviet leadership respond to these<br />
watershed changes with wisdom and propriety.<br />
We recently announced a range of diplomatic, financial and<br />
other measures designed to assist the countries of Eastern<br />
Europe develop their new democratic systems a practical<br />
response by our heads and hands that matches the sense of<br />
joy we feel in our hearts at this enlargement of political<br />
and economic freedoms in nations where they had been denied<br />
for so long.<br />
Within the Soviet Union itself, we have seen only last week<br />
the historic decision to clear the way for competitive and<br />
open elections and, by extension, for a more competitive and<br />
open society.<br />
I shall never forget, on my last day in Moscow, hearing the<br />
news that a number of refusenik cases that I had raised with<br />
the Soviet Government had been sympathetically and promptly<br />
resolved. It is a matter of very great personal<br />
satisfaction that the Soviet Union's positive response to<br />
human rights issues has been carried through and that, in<br />
particular, our two countries have established such a close<br />
and constructive dialogue on this issue.<br />
The Human Contacts agreement that we will sign tomorrow will<br />
bring to a successful conclusion our negotiations that<br />
commenced at a time when there had been little discussion of<br />
such matters between the Soviet Union and the West. </p>
<p>Mr Prime Minister, at the dinner that you hosted for me in<br />
Moscow, I observed that over the last 40 years the world had<br />
slowly and steadily built for itself a nuclear scaffold.<br />
I said that if for any reason humanity should ever have to<br />
stand on that scaffold and look its executioner in the face,<br />
we would see ourselves.<br />
The task before us was to dismantle that scaffold and to<br />
do so without destroying our own security in the process.<br />
It is, Mr Prime Minister, with the profoundest sense of<br />
admiration and respect that we congratulate your Government<br />
for working with the United States to undertake that<br />
critical task.<br />
We do today live in a safer and a more secure world. The<br />
scaffold is far from dismantled, to be sure, but we now have<br />
greater confidence it will not be used.<br />
So in all these ways the landscape of the world order has<br />
indeed been transformed.<br />
Mr Prime Minister, there is, nor should be, no sense of<br />
condescension in our welcome to the changes in the Soviet<br />
Union and Eastern Europe. In no country in history has the<br />
evolution to democratic institutions and practices been<br />
without trauma. As you know we have, in consultation with<br />
you, been steadfast and constant in stressing these values<br />
and the need for their embrace if the legitimate aspirations<br />
of people are to be satisfied. That these processes are so<br />
committedly under way is for us a matter of undiluted joy<br />
and our commitment to be involved with you in these<br />
processes is total.<br />
I want to say to you quite clearly tonight that the<br />
Australian Government welcomes and supports the economic and<br />
political changes within the Soviet Union that have been so<br />
important to this transformation.<br />
We admire the courage and vision that the leadership of the<br />
Soviet Union has displayed in implementing these reforms.<br />
And we want you, and your nation, to succeed in your<br />
endeavours to maintain the pace and direction of these<br />
reforms.<br />
Where you succeed in creating a more open and peaceful<br />
society, and in integrating your economy with the world, we<br />
stand to gain as well.<br />
Where you lower tensions at the superpower level, and where<br />
you pursue a constructive Soviet foreign policy, we stand to<br />
enjoy a more stable environment in the world and in our own<br />
region. </p>
<p>The Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan; your creative and<br />
positive contribution to the resolution of the longstanding<br />
Namibian problems; the role you are playing in Cambodia,<br />
including your support for Australia's proposal for United<br />
Nations involvement in a settlement of the tragic conflict<br />
there; reductions in your force levels along the Sino-Soviet<br />
border and in Cam Ranh Bay all these are very welcome<br />
developments. The emergence of a more favourable and stable global<br />
environment has now exerted a positive influence even on the<br />
South African regime, as is evident with the release, at<br />
last, of Nelson Mandela.<br />
In the same way, where you succeed in making progress in<br />
arms control and disarmament, we stand to make progress<br />
towards other goals we regard as important, such as the<br />
elimination of chemical weapons. We were grateful for your<br />
support for the Government Industry Conference Against<br />
Chemical Weapons that was held in Canberra last year.<br />
And very importantly, where you succeed in opening the<br />
Soviet economy and making it more efficient, we stand to<br />
gain mutual benefit from the outcome.<br />
We are keen to explore whatever avenues exist now or in the<br />
future for the peaceful development of commercial links<br />
between us.<br />
Today we discussed a number of areas where Australia, with<br />
our strong agricultural and resource base and effective<br />
transport and communications infrastructure, can offer you<br />
the benefit of our experience and expertise.<br />
One particular area, which I have raised with<br />
President Gorbachev as well, is our expertise in the<br />
handling, storage and long-distance transport of food an<br />
area where improvements would bring direct benefits to<br />
Soviet agricultural producers and consumers.<br />
I am delighted too that we will sign tomorrow fisheries and<br />
commodities agreements business-like agreements that<br />
represent a very significant broadening of our commercial<br />
relationship, for our long term mutual benefit.<br />
Many other opportunities exist for economic and trading<br />
links between our two countries, particularly through joint<br />
ventures. In Melbourne yesterday you were briefed on one of<br />
these the very promising aluminium proposal involving<br />
Comalco and the Soviet Ministry of Metallurgy.<br />
Australia can also help realise President Gorbachev's vision<br />
for the accelerated development of the Soviet Far East. In<br />
July, a number of Australian companies will be mounting a<br />
major trade exhibition in Vladivostock, to show that<br />
Australian goods and services have much to contribute there. </p>
<p>Mr Prime Minister, our conclusion of agreements on<br />
environmental protection and nuclear safeguards will open<br />
the prospect of further constructive cooperation between us.<br />
I very much welcomed President Gorbachev's recent speech at<br />
the Global Forum on Environment and Development For<br />
Survival, especially his positive references to the<br />
Antarctic. Australia has been strongly advocating the banning of mining<br />
in Antarctica and the preservation of this magnificent and<br />
wild continent as a natural reserve and land of science.<br />
I welcome what you said today about our shared concerns for<br />
the protection of this environment.<br />
Mr Prime Minister,<br />
On my way to visit Leningrad and Moscow in 1987, I made a<br />
stop-over in Singapore, where I had been invited to deliver<br />
the annual Singapore Lecture. I spoke on that occasion<br />
about the developments underway in this most dynamic of<br />
regions, the Asia-Pacific region, including the new<br />
diplomacy being practiced in the region by the Soviet Union.<br />
I said that Australia would welcome a constructive<br />
involvement by the USSR in political and economic<br />
developments in the region.<br />
Let me tell you that on my return home, that expression was<br />
criticised by some who saw it as an excessively generous<br />
interpretation of Soviet intentions.<br />
Of course today my assessment has been not only vindicated<br />
by events, but almost overtaken by them.<br />
It has shown again that the vigour and creativity of Soviet<br />
policy making has stretched, and then frequently exceeded,<br />
the expectations even of those of us in the West who<br />
perceived early the magnitude of your reform ambitions<br />
while thoroughly exploding the preconceptions of those who<br />
insisted on judging you according to the yardstick of the<br />
1950s, 60s or<br />
Not too many years ago, a visit to Australia by a Soviet<br />
Prime Minister would have been an unlikely event. It<br />
certainly would not have been conducted with the<br />
constructive spirit, the frankness and the warmth that has<br />
characterised your visit.<br />
As we proceed through the 1990s, Australia and the Soviet<br />
Union will have much to gain from contacts such as this; we<br />
will have many avenues for consultation and cooperation to<br />
explore. I hope you will take back to President Gorbachev a message<br />
of hope from the Australian people a message of our great<br />
admiration and respect for what he, you and your colleagues<br />
have achieved and are endeavouring to achieve. </p>
<p>6.<br />
And I trust you, Mr Prime Minister, will be fortified by<br />
that message and by what we have shown you during this visit<br />
just as we are immensely encouraged by the prospects for<br />
the future that you represent.<br />
For this is indeed a time of historic opportunity, in which<br />
leaders of historic vision are truly making the world a<br />
better place.<br />
That is why, fundamentally, we support you and why we want<br />
you to succeed. </p>
