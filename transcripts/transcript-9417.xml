PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING MP<br />
DOORSTOP, JAKARTA CONVENTION CENTRE, 14 NOVEMBER 1994<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
PM: Well, I'll just give you a couple of minutes and a few impressions. During<br />
this APEC meeting we have the opportunity of bilateral discussions and<br />
today I have already had bilateral discussions with Prime Minister<br />
Mahathir, President Jiang Zemin, yesterday Prime Minister Chretien. I will<br />
be seeing President Clinton for lunch. I am seeing Mr Chuan from<br />
Thailand and I will be seeing other leaders through the afternoon.<br />
President Soeharto's draft declaration is, of course, a document of great<br />
moment and because It Implies Important national commitments by<br />
countries as people contemplate those commitments, they are pressing to<br />
see what everyone else is doing and to see what it means for them, what<br />
they secure from It and as one would expect with something of such huge<br />
moment, it is not being thoughtlessly agreed. There Is a lot of discussion<br />
about what this means for people and whether than can accommodate It.<br />
So far the discussions have gone well. So far, I think, there is gathering<br />
support for the dedcaration and I think Leaders are having a chance to<br />
discuss amongst themselves what It means, what other people believe it<br />
all means and who we will proceed from here in the case of it being*<br />
adopted. Now, this Is the sort of discussion I thought there would be today, but I am<br />
happy to report at this point, it Is moving positively and 1 think well.<br />
J: Did Dr Mahathir indicate he would come on board this APEC process?<br />
PM: Well, itIs not a matter of coming on board. He is already on board.<br />
Malaysia Is a. member of APEC and I think they are also offering to host<br />
the 1998 meetings. These are matters yet to be decded, but all the </p>
<p>2<br />
nuances here are by degree and it is a matter of seeing whether all of the<br />
degrees add up to. if you like, a circle.<br />
J: How did you get on with him?<br />
PM: Very good, very well, but I always have whenever I've meet him in the<br />
past and as I did in Cyprus a year or so ago and on this occasion we had<br />
a good meeting about our bilateral relationship, about the growth In our<br />
trade, about the exchange of people, about the students in Australia,<br />
about out capacity to do things together in third markets. It was, I<br />
thought, a very positive discussion.<br />
J; So, he is no longer recalcitrant?<br />
PM: Well, it was a discussion about there were two features to It the<br />
bilateral discussion, that is the things Australia and Malaysia are doing<br />
together end our role In the larger game of APEC. I thought It was a<br />
valuable and frank discussion.<br />
J: Will he support target liberalisation?<br />
PM: 1 think you will find out exactly what people support, probably this evening<br />
and tomorrow. People are trying to, at this stage I think, feel out<br />
everybody else to see what all these words really mean In the minds of<br />
the major players. But, I think, Malaysia certainly sees advantages in the<br />
developed countries committing themselves to an earlier date for<br />
liberalisation. I think, that is a very large matter with the developing<br />
countries.<br />
J: Mr Keating substantial change to the draft in the next 24 hours?<br />
PM: I think President Soeharto has taken the view that we have now had a<br />
year to put this together.. There has been a tremendous amount of<br />
discussion across that year, feeling people out to see what should go Into<br />
a draft declaration and, I think, the judgement has to be made then Is<br />
this basically likely to accommodate most peoples aspirations? I would<br />
think the President thinks it does. and his inclination, I haven't seen him<br />
yet I will be seeing him this afternoon of course, his inclination is that it<br />
does and that he should stick by it.<br />
J: Are the Chinese ready to support a timetable?<br />
PM: . I think China understands.. Australia did some economic modelling of<br />
APEC benefit versus Uruguay Round benefits and they far outstripped the<br />
Uruguay Round benefits for China. In fact, . China Is probably the largest J </p>
<p>3<br />
beneficiary of the APEC change and in my meeting with President Jiang<br />
Zemin a few moments ago I gave him some of that material. I think, what<br />
it in fact does Is confirm China's own view that APEC provides<br />
tremendous economic opportunities for China and as well as that in the<br />
draft declaration it will have the United States In agreeing to the<br />
declaration to also do so with the words In there which say that all APEC<br />
members should be members of the World Trade Organisation which<br />
means also China. So, I think, China would see that as a fairly clear<br />
benefit for them.<br />
J: the protests on streets of Dili today, there is still at the US embassy.<br />
To what extent do you think East Timor may, at least, partly overshadow<br />
what's going on here at APEC?<br />
PM: Well, let me assure you, this is always an issue and has been an Issue for<br />
years, I have raised it mapy times with the President, and It is an Issue,<br />
I'm sure, for many countries here, but it Is not overshadowing what Is<br />
happening here. You get no sense of that speaking to any of the<br />
Leaders. So, this may be a media view, It Is not a view here in reality.<br />
That Is not to say the Issue isn't important or that it is not something that<br />
we shouldn't work on and you know in Australia's case we are doing<br />
something material and tangible in seeking to develop East Timor and<br />
that whole province. To try and make economic opportunities,<br />
employment and living standards better in that part of Indonesia. So, I<br />
think, as these things progress and there Is also, I think, Indonesia Itself<br />
manages this region perhaps better In the future than it has in the past,<br />
that it will be better at managing this problem.<br />
J: ( further question on Timor and demonstrations)<br />
PM: You're aware of the demonstrations and I am by news, but not by<br />
moment. I mean, I don't think it is fair to present a picture to Australian<br />
viewers or anyone else, that somehow the meetings are being set in a<br />
climate of these demonstrations going, because this is not the climate<br />
here. Now, there is no doubt with the world in town those who want to<br />
make a point about Timor will seek to make It But, the point, I think, we<br />
should understand is that if there is any moment of history here, It is the<br />
fact that this meeting would In any other decade have occurred In<br />
Washington or the United States or Western Europe, this Is occurring In<br />
Asia and it is occurring here in Indonesia and the United States President<br />
has come to Indonesia to conclude this business on behalf of his country.<br />
I think that point of significance shouldn't be lost on any of us.<br />
ends </p>
