    <content><![CDATA[<p>PRIME MINIS3TER<br />TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING, MP<br />INTERVIEW WNTH PAUL LYNEHAM, 7.30 REPORT, ABC<br />19 OCTOBER 1993<br />E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />PL: Prime Minister, welcome to the program.<br />PM: Thank you, Paul.<br />PL: I would like to try to get a run down in simple terms please, of what<br />your so-called new deal for black and white Australia really means in<br />practice. To start with how much of Ausl: ralia do you think will end up<br />in Aboriginal hands as Native Title land?<br />PM: Well, a substantial part of the unaliensited crown land of the north<br />western part of the country.<br />PL: Does that mean, as Richard Court says, up to 95 per cent of Western<br />Australia?<br />PM: No, that is not right. That is not right. But the point is that freehold is<br />protected in this. That is, anyone who holds a freehold title has<br />extinguished Native Title, so that's all the! backyards as they say. And<br />most varieties of lease hold. I mean it can be the small lease hold of a<br />bee keeper leasing a bit of land for bees or something. But, you know,<br />all the commercial, pastoral, extinguished, so we are down to crown<br />land where Aboriginal people are either living now, or can establish a<br />traditional link. That is, what the High Court said. The High Court said<br />that there is a Native Title in the Australian common law, flying from<br />Aboriginal traditional custom and title, bul. what this package is about is<br />putting flesh on those bones. That is, to develop a body of<br />administrative law to hear claims for Native Title, to see who is entitled<br />to them, to grant them, to protect Native Tritle, and at the same time do<br />it in a way that keeps land management in Australia for mining, for<br />farming, for tourism running smoothly.<br />œ 0* 0N 2.

<p>PL: So, all those leases granted between 1788 and the 1975<br />Commonwealth Racial Discrimination Act, there is no question mark<br />over them at all?<br />PM: No, they are all valid. A couple may be invalid by virtue of Native Title,<br />or the interaction of other laws.<br />PL: Just a couple?<br />PM: Well it may be like, for instance, the famous one, the Wik one in<br />Queensland, where there was an alleged breach of duty, fiduciary<br />duty, by the State of Queensland. I mean, you will have some of those<br />claims.<br />PL: Well what happens to those ones?<br />PM: Well, in that case that one is validated. But they will be validated<br />under this legislation, they will become valid leases under this<br />legislation.<br />PL: Can Aboriginal groups go back through the legal system and try to?<br />PM: What the Aboriginal groups decided last night was to give up the<br />option of looking for any rights, which might be residual rights, in<br />invalid leases, which in this process we're making valid. In other<br />words, let me just sort of make this simple for people, if there is a<br />grazing property and it is a pastoral lease, it is now invalid, we make it<br />valid, but there could be some residual Native Title rights. That is the<br />right to walk across the land, or to fish, or to hunt, or something like<br />that. Last night the Aboriginal community gave up that thin sliver of<br />uncertain rights to take from the Government a better proposal and<br />that was to turn Aboriginal pastoral leases, not non-Aboriginal, but<br />Aboriginal pastoral leases into a form of Native Title. So, to answer<br />your question let me come at this way, Paul. If the Aboriginal<br />community are not prepared, or interested in challenging residual<br />rights on invalid leases, why would they tother with valid leases?<br />PL: Because the Opposition says there is still a lot of uncertainty.<br />PM: Yes, but that is the spoiling game that John Hewson and Peter Reith<br />have played. Here we have a package which has the support of the<br />Aboriginal community, which has today been given support by the<br />States, most of them, by the pastoralists, by the miners, the only<br />people out of step is the Federal Opposiion. Because basically, their<br />game is to spoil whatever game is on, whether it is the Budget game,<br />or the Mabo game. And this is to important a matter, too great an<br />opportunity, too historic a moment not to seize, to get that question of<br />dispossession which is at the core of the problem of Australian<br />reconciliation between Aboriginal and ron-Aboriginal Australians, to<br />S2O' N ZT: OZ œ 6' 130' 6T : 131</p>
<p>get that back into repossession on theso areas where Native Title can<br />be established.<br />PL: Then we have got leases between 1975 and the end of this year.<br />Now, some of them may, when you look back now, be a bit dubious, a<br />bit of a shadow over them.<br />PM: Yes.<br />PL: What happens to them?<br />PM: Well they will be validated under legislation. The problem was, the<br />Commonwealth hasn't issued these, tho States have, but the States<br />can't validate them because of the problem of the Racial Discrimination<br />Act, they can only be validated in a racially non-discriminatory way.<br />They need Commonwealth legal protection to validate them, this<br />package has that protection, it has beon agreed with the Aboriginal<br />community. So, all of those leases signed between 1975 and 1993 will<br />now be validated.<br />PL: Pastoral leases, mining leases, tourist lea~ ses?<br />PM: Commercial leases, you know, small farming leases, all manner of<br />leases.<br />PL: Yesterday, you were saying that pastoral leases should not extinguish<br />Native Title. Last night you agreed that Ihey should. Why the change,<br />and what does it mean in effect.<br />PM: Well what I said to the Aboriginal people I negotiated with last week,<br />look, I will take to Cabinet the notion that there are two notions, that a<br />pastoral lease extinguishes Native Title a~ bsolutely, or a pastoral lease<br />extinguishes Native Title to the extent th-t it is inconsistent with Native<br />Title. That's what they asked me to take to Cabinet. This did<br />introduce for some pastoralists some uncertainty, although, in fact the<br />primacy of their lease was 100 per cent protected. But to remove it,<br />the Aboriginal people made a judgement, really how much is in this for<br />us, how many of these thin sliver of rights, of uncertain rights, would<br />we actually get? And given that the Government then last night gave<br />them a different offer to turn many pastoral leases owned by them into<br />a form of Native Title..<br />PL: They chose that.<br />P M: They chose that.<br />PL: The advantage for them in that, is whatI, A lease can expire a Native<br />Title can never expire?<br />D/ iOd SLO* ON T: OZ œ 6* 13O6T : 1311</p>
<p>PM: Well the title can be surrendered, and because it will be a Native Title<br />equivalent, it won't be pure Native Title, it will be a Native Title<br />equivalent. It could probably, technically~ be sold, but what it means is<br />this that as already many large pastoral leases say in the Kimberley<br />of Western Australia or the Northern Territory or Queensland, if<br />Aboriginal people buy new pastoral leases with some of the funding<br />from this package, the land fund, thign instead of simply having<br />pastoral lease status, they go to a muc~ h more secure title and one<br />which is based on the Maba principles of a connection and a traditional<br />association with the land. So, it was for them, I think, a win, win<br />situation and by dropping off to the extent of the inconsistency point, it<br />was a win for the pastoral industry.<br />PL: Are tax payers up for a big compensatio~ n bill for validating all these<br />leases?<br />PM: Probably a moderately sized one, but ovEor twenty years. It will be only<br />payable when the leases are validated.<br />PL: Hundreds of millions of dollars?<br />PM: I would think at least that, but over a longj period of time. Understand<br />this Paul, these are for valid native title that was rendered invalid by<br />this process. In other words, today many of these leases which were<br />signed between 1975 and 1993 are sitting on valid native titles. If you<br />wish to invalidate them you pay compensation the same as if you<br />wish to use a non-Aboriginal Australian's land for some other purpose<br />by a government then you pay compensation the same principle is<br />there. The key point is, I think, what we sought to do here is to marry<br />the twin demands of justice for Aboriginal people and an efficient<br />system of land management and I think, the Bill achieves both of those<br />objectives.<br />PL: What happens if on land that is proved to be native title land the<br />Commonwealth wants to put a defence ba3se or do something else in<br />the national interest?<br />PM: Well, the Commonwealth can acquire or resume native title land the<br />same as it can acquire or resume non-Aboriginal land.<br />PL: And if some major resource is discoverod and it is decided in the<br />national interest, this Must be developed, say a giant gold mine or<br />something?<br />PM: Right, well, what we have done there is all the economic use questions<br />are reserved to the states. So, a state land manager, that is a state<br />Mines Minister or a state Lands Minister can issue a grant of interest<br />over native title land; there is a process of negotiation and a tribunal,<br />but if the tribunal recommends against the~ economic interest a state<br />/ 170' d S2-OON ZT: OZ œ 6'* 63O6T : 131</p>
<p>minister can override that tribunal in tha state interest. That is a key<br />part of the Bill, that protects the economic interests in the hands of that<br />state. That is why you have got Premier Kennett today and Premier<br />Goss today coming out saying it looks 41 fair package from our point of<br />view.<br />PL: And what if there is say, a state forest a national park or a beach on<br />land that is found to be native title?<br />PM: On national parks, on beaches the Bill provides a right of access to<br />beaches which the public now currently enjoy. So it allows the states<br />to legislate to protect access to beaches as the current access would<br />be there for say, you know, beaches which are in areas where a lot of<br />Aboriginal people live. That would be maintained. For state forests<br />there can be a native title claim over state forests, but in a sense that<br />doesn't change the forest unless there is an economic land use<br />application in which case the state ministers decide that too. So the<br />Bill has got all the right balances in ii: and that is why I think, the<br />Aboriginal negotiators here said What are our core interests? How<br />do we advance the interest of our people? How do we repossess our<br />formerly dispossessed land? But, how do we do it in a way that keeps<br />the economic interests of Australia going~? That is what our job was<br />to develop a Bill that satisfied all of these things. I do honestly think<br />this is a very historic Bill and it will go a very long way to meeting the<br />problem of dispossession and will advance materially the whole<br />process of reconciliation.<br />PL: You have also done a deal with the minor parties in the Senate over<br />the Budget, costing $ 144 million by 1996-97. Does this mean now that<br />all these tax measures go through?<br />PM: It will mean that the wholesale sales ta): measures which are roughly<br />around $ 2 billion will pass. It really means the bulk of the<br />Government's Budget will go through.<br />PL: When?<br />PM: Well, in the next week or so. It maybe in the course of this week Paul,<br />but in the next week or so. That will mean that the Budget the<br />Government's original intention will be. to track the Budget down<br />towards 1 per cent of GDP by 1996-97 and it will also mean that the<br />tax cuts will be paid on time in November<br />PL: Why couldn't there have been a deal like this weeks ago because the<br />Treasurer was being too macho?<br />PM: No, I think that the Senators that is the! Green Senators have only<br />now decided close to the voting where their position is. We arrived at<br />œ ZL 0N 2 T: OZ œ-6-10061 j</p>
<p>6<br />a position with the Democrats some woeks ago as you remember and<br />we have also had discussions with Sena~ tor Harradine.<br />PL: So it has been the Greens, not Labor'? They've been intransigent?<br />PM; I originally said to them at the time we mnet the Democrats, could we sit<br />down and negotiate the passage and I ion't think they felt comfortable<br />about it then. They are obviously more comfortable now, but the good<br />news for the country is that the Budget will go through largely in terms<br />of its funding and that in tracking down 10 a deficit of around I per cent<br />of GDP, it will be about one third of the American deficit. Remember<br />when Vice-President Al Gore cast his vo~ te in the American Senate and<br />there was a big cheering? They are going to be at 3 per cent of GDP<br />deficit we will be one third of that. So this is a very good budget for<br />the medium term, particularly now as the recovery is starting to come<br />through with some strength.<br />PL: Wouldn't it be a good idea in the future i: o start negotiations with these<br />groups a heck of a lot earlier? Have you learnt anything from this<br />yourself?<br />PM: Well, you can't do it earlier than the day you present the Budget. And,<br />of course, you understand what the corn problem is here it takes 38<br />votes in the Senate to block the Budget, 36 of them are John<br />Hewson's. So it is his opposition in the Senate are the villains in the<br />peace. The two Greens are 36 votes short of being able to bale any of<br />these measures up. The only reason~ they were able to do it Is<br />because John Hewson and the Liberal party broke the conventions of<br />Australian politics in not passing the Government's Money Bills in the<br />Senate. You might recall Paul, in the eltiction campaign I said when it<br />was not clear how the election would be resolved, I said a Labor<br />opposition would pass a conservative government's Money Bills in the<br />Senate including the GST. No such show of principle has come from<br />the Liberals, they have just run the spoiling game on the Budget and<br />they have run the spoiling game on Mabo and they have been now<br />sidelined on the Budget and sidelined on Mabo and Premier Kennett's<br />remarks today and Premier Goss' remark5s today makes that very clear<br />on Mabo, and the Greens and Senator Harradine and the Democrats<br />today make it very clear on the Budget too.<br />PL: Thanks for your time.<br />PM: Thank you Paul.<br />ends<br />SZO* 0N .
