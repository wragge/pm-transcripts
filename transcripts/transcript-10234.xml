Fax f rom Visit to Singapore and China<br />
I am pleased to announce that I will visit Singapore from 26 to 28 March<br />
and China from 28 March to 2 April.<br />
I look forward to meeting again the Prime Minister of Singapore,<br />
Gah Chok Tong, and continuing our discussions on a range of bilateral and<br />
regional issues. The bilateral relationship with Singapore is strong and my<br />
visit provides an opportunity to build oin that foundation.<br />
The Government is committed to strengthening further the important<br />
relationship between Australia and China. Twenty-five years after the<br />
beginning of the modem relationship between our two countries is an<br />
appropriate tine to look at how we can carry and expand that relationship<br />
into the new century.<br />
In my meeting with President Jiang Zemin in Manila last year, I reaffirmed<br />
my commitment to developing a strong ftrmework for advancing the<br />
relationship. I look forward to discussing with the Premier, Li Peng, and<br />
other Chinese leaders, ways in which we can help Austr-alia's thriving<br />
economic relationship with China flourish even more, and promote our<br />
political links and social ties to the benefit of both our countries and the<br />
region as a whole.<br />
