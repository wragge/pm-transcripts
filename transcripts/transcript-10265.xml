March 1997 TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
THE HON JOHN HOWARD MP<br />
INTERVIEW WITH JOHN LAWS RADIO 2UE<br />
E&amp; OE<br />
LAWS:<br />
Prime Minister of Australia, John Howard. Good morning Prime Minister and<br />
welcome. PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Thank you. Very nice to be with you again.<br />
LAWS: Yesterday while you were busy talking to Sir Julius a bunch of trade union leaders<br />
attended the Grand Prix for no money. How did that effect you? I mean, you had<br />
your job to do they suggested they had their job to do. What did you think about that<br />
union behaviour generally in Victoria?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well the strike to sabotage the Grand Prix was about as anti the public interest as you<br />
could possibly get. But that really pails into insignificance with their hypocrisy.<br />
Apparently officials of thle Transport Workers Union were amongst the 30 union<br />
bosses who were given free tickets in a special enclosure as part of an enterprise deal.<br />
I mean, how hypocritical can you get you first try and bring the State to a stop, you<br />
try and destroy the public support for the Grand Prix, you make it impossible for some<br />
people to get there. But I suppose if you've got a special ticket, and I'm not criticising<br />
people for having special tickets I mean, I've been to many events myself as a guest<br />
of the organisers, but it's the hypocrisy. It's rather like me accepting a special ticket to </p>
<p>sit in a special enclosure at Gough Whitlam's speech at the Town Hall a few weeks<br />
ago. LAWS: That was exactly the comparison I had in mind.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I mean, how hypocritical can you get.<br />
LAWS: And do you know what the reason they gave for being there was? They were there to<br />
monitor employment arrangements during the event.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Having decided to, sort of, destroy jobs I mean, what about the the crowds were<br />
significantly down on what they were last year.<br />
LAWS: And the money too.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
The money, everything. It was just an act of complete bloody mindedness, but then to<br />
sort of go there in a privileged position to view the event is the crowning hypocrisy. I<br />
hope they get heaps from their trade union mates.<br />
LAWS: Yes, well I think they probably will particularly as we've brought it to the attention of<br />
their trade union mates. But while all that was going on, as I said, you were talking to<br />
Sir Julius Chan. Was that a surprise visit?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, we set it up a day or two earlier.<br />
LAWS: That's a surprise.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Yeah, I suppose you could say that but he does have family in Sydney, he has a stepfather<br />
in Sydney and he does visit the place regularly. But we had a very long talk. </p>
<p>We spent about four or five hours together and had lunch and we talked about the<br />
whole gamut of the bilateral relationship. It's obviously at a very difficult phase...<br />
LAWS: Your concern is the mercenaries?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Oh yes, very and it's not just my concern. The New Zealand Prime Minister's<br />
concerned about it, the Americans are concerned about it...<br />
LAWS: Well what's the solution if he feels that he has to use part of the money? We give them<br />
something like $ 320 million in aid.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
In aid yes. Some of that is project aid and some of that is budget aid...<br />
LAWS:<br />
How much of it is money?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Oh, well it's about half of it is budget aid and then the other half is also money but it<br />
goes into particular programmes and then there's also some defence cooperation.<br />
LAWS: Well Sir Julius is denying that that's the money he's using.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Yes, yes he is denying that and I have to accept that denial and there's no evidence that<br />
we have suggesting that our money is going towards the mercenaries, but that's really<br />
not the point. We worry about the introduction of mercenaries into our region it's<br />
never happened before. They don't have a very savoury track record. We think there<br />
are worries for the Papua New Guinea Government if the mercenaries are there. It's a<br />
very unstable situation. We had a very detailed talk and we canvassed a whole lot of<br />
things and I hope that...<br />
LAWS: How do you help him solve the problem? He's got a problem, he says that his troops<br />
aren't... </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:<br />
He said he's got a very big problem.<br />
LAWS: Well why don't we give him some help?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
You will understand in a situation like this when we've had a talk and he's gone back<br />
to think about what I said to him and I'm thinking about what he said to me. I don't<br />
want to go into too much more detail at this stage.<br />
LAWS: But did you offer him help?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well we talked about all aspects of it John.<br />
LAWS: Wouldn't it be better if he used American army personnel or New Zealand or<br />
Australian army personnel to train his troops than use mercenaries?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
We don't like mercenaries, we think any reasonable alternative to mercenaries is to be<br />
preferred. LAWS: And would he prefer to have Australian servicemen train his troops?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Let me put it this way, we talked about possible alternative approaches and I'm really<br />
not going to say more than that.<br />
LAWS: That was one of them, assumningly?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, I'm not going to. I really don't think </p>
<p>LAWS:<br />
Okay. PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Please I'm not being unduly tight lipped but it is a very delicate situation. We are quite<br />
strong in our view about the mercenaries and 1 made that clear to him and that hasn't<br />
changed. But we do understand his problems and we also understand how important<br />
the bilateral relationship is and I did welcome the fact that we could spend about four<br />
hours, in a very informal way, talking over the whole problem. It's the longest<br />
discussion I've had with him by far and both of us would have gone away from the<br />
discussion having a much better understanding of the on my part the difficulty of his<br />
problem, on his part the strength of Australian feeling.<br />
LAWS: Yeah, okay well we'll watch with interest to see what happens there. While on matters<br />
military how far have you really gone with the plan to give young unemployed the<br />
option of doing some form of military training have you gone along with that?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
It's just an option that we'll look at. It's not a central part of the work for the dole<br />
proposal. I'm not saying we're going to pick it up but we're in the mood to look at<br />
anything that is reasonable and fair. We haven't developed it.<br />
LAWS:<br />
The Opposition is calling it a public relations stunt. Is that what it is?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well it's not meant to be a public relations stunt. I mean, they run out of descriptions<br />
sometimes. They saw the work for the dole proposal as a public relations stunt...<br />
LAWS: A public relations stunt, yeah.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I mean, it's not. It's a very serious proposal and has a lot of public support and it will<br />
do a lot of good and it also has a lot of support from young people in the relevant age<br />
group. It's quite surprising the correspondence I've had. You would have noticed all<br />
the vox pops at the time the thing was announced young people like it. I've never<br />
found any objection. </p>
<p>LAWS: Who's pushing for who would have leaked the story to the Sydney Morning Her-ald,<br />
somebody's pushing for it?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
The thing this morning?<br />
LAWS: Yeah. PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I don't know. But you know what Canberra's like John it leaks like a sieve<br />
unfortunately. LAWS: Yeah, but somebody within Canberra's obviously pushing for it.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well I would have thought that story hadn't come from a Cabinet source. It looked to<br />
me as though it came from a departmental source because the proposal hasn't been<br />
before the Cabinet. Most of my colleagues wouldn't have even heard of it.<br />
LAWS: In New Zealand young people there pay $ 50 a week from their dole for board and<br />
accommodation during that training course. Would you approve of that sort of<br />
example being followed?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Oh it's too early for me to even offer a view on that because we haven't even looked<br />
at it. It is one of a number of ideas that the employment department has apparently<br />
devised to be put to us. It's not a central part of the work for the dole scheme. We<br />
will talk about all of these things at our Cabinet meeting in Pakenham in rural Victoria<br />
tomorrow and I hope to be saying something about the work for the dole details and<br />
how far we've progressed it after that meeting tomorrow.<br />
LAWS: Okay, have you progressed that far? </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Yeah, pretty far. Yes I'll be having quite a bit to say, I hope, tomorrow including the<br />
proposed changes to the legislation that we'll be putting forward and we'll want to<br />
have passed before the winter recess. You do need to change the legislation to enable<br />
the government to require people, if necessary, to do something in return for their<br />
dole. LAWS: A thorn in your side must be this Mal Colston business?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well it's messy because anything that involves allegations of abuse of parliamentary<br />
entitlements tends to reflect poorly on all of us. Now, Mal Colston like anybody else is<br />
entitled to a presumption of innocence. He's not going to be given any favoured<br />
treatment by me or by the government but equally we're not going to allow him to be<br />
unfairly hounded and I thought Senator Ray gave the game away last week when he<br />
basically said we're really chasing this bloke because he's a Labor rat and not so much<br />
because of the alleged misuses because some of the allegations I repeat, allegations<br />
concern long periods when the former government was in office. Now there are<br />
certain inquiries under way and they'll be allowed to run their course. I won't be<br />
interfering, I won't be suggesting that he be given any lenient treatment because he<br />
supported us in the Senate. Equally I'm not going to have him stripped of any<br />
semblance of natural justice which the Senate proceedings last week tended to amount<br />
to. LAWS: Do you think that the public would be less suspicious, and I suppose they are<br />
suspicious, if you opened up the whole question of political rorting to the public<br />
accounts committee. Wouldn't it be better to clear the air and get it all out into the<br />
open and over and done with?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I suppose that's the equivalent of saying why shouldn't everybody's tax return be<br />
opened to the public, whether they're a politician or, indeed, anybody else. I mean,<br />
there has to be a point at which if there is no allegation of roiling, if there is no<br />
suggesting of impropriety on the part of a whole group of individuals why should they<br />
be constantly subject to public scrutiny? Look I'm open to suggestions on this<br />
because... LAWS: I don't think.... </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I've got nothing to hide and can I say I believe that the great majority of people on the<br />
Labor Party side have nothing to hide either. I'm not suggesting for a moment that<br />
there's, sort of, wide scale rorting on the Labor Party side any more than there is on<br />
our side. But, look, I've got an open mind about suggestions but I don't think you<br />
ever, sort of, stop some people making allegations nor, no matter what you do, do you<br />
stop in any walk of life some people rorting the system. I mean, that's the nature of<br />
man. LAWS: That's true, but there's a difference between a private citizen having his tax returns<br />
available to the public and somebody who's paid by the public money. I mean, we're<br />
simply talking about the misappropriation of public funds.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, therefore you presumably all people who are employed by governments I guess.<br />
LAWS: Yes, well...<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Not just politicians.<br />
LAWS: Well maybe that should be the way.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well yes, although the obligation to pay tax is an obligation that is shared equally by<br />
private citizens. And if a private citizen is evading his or her tax liabilities then that has<br />
just as much impact on the public as if a politician or a public servant is evading his or<br />
her tax liabilities, doesn't it? I mean, we all have the same obligation. You earn $ 100<br />
000 a year whether you're a public servant or you're employed by a private company,<br />
your obligation as a citizen is the same. But John, I don't resist if there are proposals<br />
to tighten the system. David Jull at thle moment is looking at some proposals to<br />
tighten up the systemn. And I've got, as I say, a completely open mind. I'm prepared<br />
to look at changes that improve accountability but don't impose unreasonable burdens<br />
on honest people.<br />
LAWS: I, when I talked to David Jull on this subject the other day, I asked him if he had<br />
passed on stamps as this seems to be one of the favourite occupations that are </p>
<p>questioned by others if he'd ever passed on stamps and his answer said yes, it was yes<br />
have you?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I can't recall. I may have, I may not have, I just don't know.<br />
LAWS: Is that the sort of thing that is considered to be rorting?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I wouldn't regard that as rorling. If you have a stamp entitlement... . I mean, what is<br />
rorting is when you claim something to which you're not entitled.<br />
LAWS: Yeah, well I suppose that's...<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
And I mean let's face it, the average politician he has a postage entitlement and it is<br />
just impossible to draw a dividing line between what is a political use and what is a<br />
parliamentary use. I mean, you get a constituent who writes to you making a policy<br />
suggestion that the Liberal Party ought to do adopt I'm a Liberal member of<br />
Parliament and I write back and say thank you very much for that, it's a very good<br />
suggestion and this is what's wrong with the Labor Party's approach and this is what's<br />
good about our approach, now what do you regard that as, is that a political message<br />
or is that a parliamentary electorate message?<br />
LAWS: Yeah, maybe the rules aren't clear.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well maybe they're not, but you see the rules allow you to use your entitlements for a<br />
whole range of purposes.<br />
LAWS: But when you hear of things like Pauline Hanson, for example, using parliamentary<br />
letterhead to cancel her garbage service or something, that must be aggravating<br />
because it sort of doesn't do anybody any good, does it ( inaudible) </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I've got to say I found that rather petty, that particular... .1 saw that and can I1m ean,<br />
you're a member of Parliament and like anybody else you've got a whole lot of<br />
correspondence and you ask your secretary to write a letter cancelling your garbage<br />
service and you forget to say them, well, put that on plain paper, and of course if it's<br />
on parliamentary letterhead...<br />
LAWS: Yeah, I find it rather petty too but if you're constantly hearing it it doesn't do the<br />
Government any good.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well of course it doesn't do the Government any good but there is a tendency to sort<br />
of dwell on those things in a very, very petty way. I don't think you will ever solve<br />
this problem. I don't think you will ever get a situation where people are universally<br />
satisfied that in the eyes of some people, no matter what you paid members of<br />
Parliament if you paid them only $ 20 000, 10 000 a year in their eyes they'd still<br />
be over paid. In the eyes of others, senior people In politics are ridiculously under<br />
paid. The Federal Treasurer gets $ 180 000 a year. The heads of all the banks he's got<br />
to deal with, most of them get between a million and two million dollars a year. Now,<br />
I'm not saying he should get between a million and two million dollars a year, I'm just<br />
making the point that there is a, you know, there are two sides to this. I mean, I didn't<br />
go into politics to make money. I get paid a very good salary, by community<br />
standards, a very good salary indeed, it's a very, very comfortable existence and I<br />
don't have any complaints and I've got no sympathy for members of Parliament who<br />
complain about their remuneration. I don't have any sympathy for them at all no<br />
matter what they do because they all go into it, you know, very willingly. There's<br />
always a big queue at the time for pre-selections on both sides, isn't there? And I think<br />
there's a certain... there's something about politics that's different from anything else<br />
and you don't go into it for the money. But by the same token you can't blame<br />
somebody in my position, or Kim Beazley's position, from sort of defending the<br />
profession and pointing out that most people who go into politics are committed, hard<br />
working men and women they are and most of them work very long hours. But so<br />
do a lot of other people. I don't expect any special thanks for it but you'll understand<br />
if we think we're being unfairly attacked, we defend it.<br />
LAWS: Sure, that's reasonable. So let's move to more substantial things. Mal Colston, if<br />
nothing else, is certainly substantial...<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
So are some of his accusers. </p>
<p>LAWS: True. They were at it, as I said the other day, belly to belly and how. If he leaves and<br />
is replaced by a Labor person and that's the requirement that's going to make things<br />
tough for you in the Senate, isn't it?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Ohl yes, but that will return it to what it was before his change of circumstances in<br />
August of last year.<br />
LAWS: But it will be even tougher.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, it will be different, yes. But I don't accept that he's going. Nothing's been<br />
proved against him, but that's a matter for him and it's a matter for the due processes.<br />
LAWS: Rob Borbidge, Queensland Premier, after his stupid suggestion to fill Mal Colston's<br />
seat with an Independent has now hinted he might delay finding a replacement. That<br />
would keep numbers more favourable for you, wouldn't it?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well I would expect, as I said in the Parliament last week, I would expect the letter<br />
and the spirit of the constitution to be observed and I would be arguing that. If there<br />
were a vacancy be it from Queensland or indeed anywhere else, the letter and the spirit<br />
should be observed.<br />
LAWS:<br />
Well, if that's the case, if a vote was taken in the Senate before a replacement was<br />
found for Mal Colston you would then be expected, carrying the spirit all the way, to<br />
do the honourable thing and take one of your blokes out of voting, wouldn't you?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, if a vacancy occurs then we would obviously have to give attention to the<br />
question of pairing, which is your question. But there is no vacancy at the moment.<br />
LAWS: But if he goes. </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, yeah but that's if All . John look, our situation is that if a vacancy occurs,<br />
that includes a vacancy created by him or indeed any other Senator going, then<br />
obviously we would have to give attention to the question of pairing and that happened<br />
in 1987 when a Labor Senator left or resigned or something no left and there was<br />
some delay in the appointment of a replacement and we agreed to a pairing<br />
arrangement so that the numbers were the same. But look, that hasn't arisen. And all<br />
I can say to you at this stage is, firstly, I believe the letter and the spirit's got to be<br />
observed, and it will be as far as I'm concerned. And secondly, if a vacancy arises then<br />
the Government in the Senate will have to give attention to the question of pairing.<br />
LAWS: Okay, another if, and it is an if it's been calculated using the Department of Finance<br />
formula that if Mal Colston leaves he takes with him about a million dollars worth of<br />
super. PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I don't know whether that's right or not I just don't know.<br />
LAWS:<br />
How do you feel about that though? Do you think that other Australians are going to<br />
feel comfortable...<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, I feel that if he's entitled to take whatever he's entitled to not a penny more<br />
and if he's not entitled to something and the same applies to anybody who retires<br />
they ought to have it taken away from them. Now, the superannuation for members of<br />
Parliament is reasonably generous although the contributions they make are higher than<br />
they are paid after tax and they are at the rate of about 11% for the first 18 years. Not<br />
many survive to 18 years. Colston's one that has. Very few, the average lifespan I<br />
mean, parliamentary life span of a member of Parliament is about eight or nine years<br />
and it runs at about 11% after tax. Some would argue that the generosity of that<br />
makes up for the fact that compared with equivalent responsibilities in other walks of<br />
life the ordinary salary rates are lower. And look, we're getting back to what we were<br />
talking about before. It's all a question of how you view the contribution of members<br />
of Parliament...<br />
LAWS: Yeah, well I'm interested in how you view it... </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well I'm telling you I think compared to relative responsibilities in the community I<br />
think they stack up, you know, they carry their load very well, the hard working ones.<br />
LAWS: Do you really think, given the performance of Mal Colston that that might be a wrong<br />
word, do you understand that the Australian public would think wow, what did he do<br />
to get a hand out a million dollars?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Look, I'm not going to make a comment about him that's sort of prejudices in a way<br />
the public reaction when the inquiries going on. I said at the beginning of discussion of<br />
him that he's not going to get any favours from me but he's not going to be hounded.<br />
And hounding includes me giving sort of, making moralistic judgements about him<br />
when I don't know all of the circumstances and I'm simply not going to do that.<br />
LAWS: Over the last ten years Federal politicians' basic salaries have increased by 70% and the<br />
average Australian wage has increased by 4 so even though you mightn't not you<br />
one who's in politics may not be paid, being paid a bundle of money and certainly a<br />
whole lot more has increased dramatically, a whole lot more than the average<br />
Australian wage is that acceptable?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, if those figures are right during that time then obviously there's been a faster<br />
rate. But of course there was a very long period of time, I know, in the 1 970s when<br />
increases were knocked back regularly and there are plenty of figures around the<br />
system showing that during that time they fell behind community standards. So some<br />
people would argue there's an element of catch-up work.<br />
LAWS: Big element?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, there was also a lot of.. there were a lot of increases that were knocked back in<br />
the 70s. I know because I was part of the government that did it.<br />
LAWS: Would you agree that taxation reform and health reform are probably the two biggest<br />
challenges that your Government has? </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Oh, I think the biggest challenge we have at the moment is to get the Wik issue right.<br />
That's the most difficult, complex, emotion laden problem that I have at the present<br />
time. The other two are very important. The health issue is hugely important. We do<br />
have a problem because private health insurance participation has fallen below almost a<br />
critical mass level. And we're going to introduce tax subsidies that will help a lot, in<br />
the middle of the year, but that should have been done five years ago. The former<br />
government should have listened to Graham Richardson. I mean, he said four or five<br />
years ago when private health insurance was about 39% it's now 34%, it was 61% in<br />
1983 when Medicare was introduced if the former Labor Government had listened to<br />
Richardson then we mightn't have had the growing bleeding. I mean, this thing started<br />
to bleed when Medicare was introduced and the bleeding increased in volume and we<br />
now do have a serious problem. Our health...<br />
LAWS:<br />
Did you listen to Richardson?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well it was our policy did I listen to Richardson?<br />
LAWS: Yes. PRIME MINISTER:<br />
On that particular issue, yes. Look, I listen to Richardson on some things and I don't<br />
on others.<br />
LAWS: But on that particular issue, and if you agreed with him and you obviously did, then<br />
why didn't you do something about it sooner?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
We did. We put in our policy. We couldn't do anything until we won the election.<br />
LAWS: Yeah, but nothing because you won the election a year ago.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Hang on, we promised before the campaign that we'd introduce it in the middle of<br />
July. They had 13 years and they let the thing bleed to death and we're meant to sort </p>
<p>of have it up on its feet and running around the block at a rate of knots in twelve<br />
months. LAWS: Well, I didn't quite say that.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
No, well I mean that is the implication of some of the criticism of us.<br />
LAWS: Well your Government believes in freedom of choice and open competition, so why<br />
can't you have that in health care? I mean, that's something that's been talked about<br />
for ages why don't you open up the health insurance market you know, I think you<br />
encouraged it for banking and certainly telecommunications?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well we have a Productivity Commission report in front of us at the moment...<br />
LAWS: Which you haven't released.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, well, we only got it a few days ago and the normal procedure with these reports<br />
from the Productivity Commission is you release the draft report and get people's<br />
comments, then you get the final report and you take a decision and release the final<br />
report when you announce the decision all in one hit. So we are looking at a whole lot<br />
of changes right at the moment...<br />
LAWS: Is that one of them?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, that could be one of them, yes.<br />
LAWS: Because that would, it appear, be fairly important because competition in that area<br />
would certainly help, wouldn't it? </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:<br />
But you have to make certain that the competition doesn't result in the system not<br />
being able to care for people who have chronic illnesses and have been in private health<br />
insurance for a long time. In other words, some element of community rating has got<br />
to be maintained otherwise you will have flaws open up in the system. But John, I<br />
would be the last to deny that there aren't difficulties with health policy. The major<br />
difficulty has been the declining number of people in private health insurance. And the<br />
problem is it becomes self fulfilling. And the more people who drop out, the greater<br />
pressure there is to increase premiums, the less attractive the services become because<br />
the funds are naturally concerned about their reserves and then because the premiums<br />
go up, the service will become less attractive, more people are induced to drop out.<br />
Now that's been going on for years and it's accelerated over the last few years. Now<br />
we are the first government in 13 years to try and do something about it. And I repeat<br />
if the former government had done something when it was at 39% or 40% instead of<br />
34% you wouldn't now have some of the difficulties we're facing. Now that's not to<br />
say that we've been perfect on health, no side of politics has, but I'm not going<br />
you know, when clearly the decline in the private health funds was allowed to<br />
occur with malign neglect under the former government with exception, the<br />
honourable exception on this issue of Graham Richardson I've felt it's not fair that<br />
we're then sort of told well look, you've been there five minutes, why haven't you<br />
fixed it all?<br />
LAWS: Are you going to offer tax concessions for people who subscribe to private health<br />
funds? PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, we're going to offer what we legislate and it's going to come in to operation on<br />
the 1 st of July. It will be $ 450 for a family, $ 250 for a couple and $ 125 for a single.<br />
LAWS: The Productivity Commission felt that some of the Federal Health Department<br />
witnesses hadn't quite told the truth during that hearing does that concern you?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, I read the report, I must say that didn't register with me. I'll go back and read it<br />
again. LAWS: Do you think the Federal Health Department actually knows how many subsidies and<br />
cross subsidies operate within that Federal and State health system? I mean, you<br />
know, do we really know what that... </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I can't I certainly hope they do. I mean, I can't, I can't just, I can't give you a factual<br />
answer on that because I'm not in the Health Department, I'm not directly responsible<br />
for it. Look I don't, I think they've got a lot of hard-working people in their ranks,<br />
but I'm not saying they're the repository of all wisdom in this area.<br />
LAWS: Yeah. You've considered it obviously very important and you intend to do something<br />
about it, but do you think that Wik's more important?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
No, I just think it's more complex. It's about the hardest problem I've had since I've<br />
become Prime Minister because it involves a clash of passionately held views and a<br />
situation where two groups in the community feel and with some force and I certainly<br />
understand their position that things that they think they're entitled to have for granted,<br />
take for granted have been challenged. I mean, I'm very sympathetic to the farmers<br />
fo LAWS: When can they expect a decision on that?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, I said by Easter I have to either have an agreed outcome or if I can't get an<br />
agreed outcome I'll make a recommendation to the Cabinet. But I'm not optimistic<br />
that I can get an agreed outcome but I'm trying very hard and I had lengthy talks last<br />
week and the week before with different parties. But the High Court decision was<br />
very disappointing in the Wik case, very disappointing. It went against what we had<br />
been told. We had been told in the preamble of the Native Title Act, we'd been told by<br />
the former government that the grant of a pastoral lease extinguished Native Title and<br />
that was the belief on which we all proceeded. That was the belief on which the<br />
farmers proceeded and bingo, the court went the other way.<br />
Now, I accept that the court has a right to go the other way but I have a right and the<br />
Parliament has a right to change the law as declared by the court. I noticed in this<br />
morning's paper that Sir Harry Gibbs, former Chief Justice of the High Court, said that<br />
for time immemorial Parliaments have changed the law as defined by the courts.<br />
There's nothing sacrosanct about an individual court judgment.<br />
LAWS: Is it likely you'll change the law? </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:<br />
We could. The only two things I have ruled out are doing nothing, because that is not<br />
an option....<br />
LAWS: We hope not.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, it's not. I mean, we've got to do something. I mean, apart from anything else,<br />
the existing Native Title Act has collided with the Wik decision, so something<br />
significant has got to be done and the other thing I ruled out is overturning the original<br />
Mabo decision. In other words I accept there is now such an element of the Australian<br />
land law system for Native Title. But it is the extent of Native Title, how it interacts<br />
with other people's titles and most importantly of all giving people a degree of<br />
certainty and we have got to find a way of avoided the nightmare, the nightmare of<br />
years and years of costly litigation as farmers and native title claimants argue over<br />
different tracts of land all around Australia. I can't think of anything worse and I can't<br />
think of anything more likely to destroy the spirit of goodwill.<br />
LAWS:<br />
Well, the farmers would agree with you because they are the ones who have to be<br />
paying for it one way or another.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, that's right. There's another complaint they legitimately have and that is that<br />
they don't get any legal aid whereas many of the native title claimants do. Now that's<br />
clearly unfair. Most farmers in Australia are cash strapped. They've got no cash.<br />
They might have some notionally good assets in their land but they have had very poor<br />
seasons until recently, their cash flow is awful and they can't afford the cost of<br />
litigation. LAWS: So how can you allow it to go ahead knowing that farmers can't afford to pay and yet<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well I haven't said we are going to allow it to go ahead. I'm grappling at the moment<br />
to get a solution. </p>
<p>LAWS: Well anything associated with native title to go ahead when the farmers are<br />
disadvantaged to that degree. I mean we are constantly talking about equality and we<br />
are constantly talking about discrimination there, obviously being discriminated against<br />
if the Aboriginal people can go to Aboriginal legal aid which they can at the drop of a<br />
hat. I know I've had seven writs in three days through Aboriginal legal aid, because it<br />
costs nothing to get it. I mean, it's a fantasy and these farmers who are making a huge<br />
contribution, not only productively but from a tax point of view, and a contribution to<br />
Australia, they can't get any assistance.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Quite apart from the problems thrown up by Wik, there is a separate problem of the<br />
inequality of legal aid provision in these areas, and it is one of the things that I'm going<br />
to address when we have a package.<br />
LAWS: Because I imagine if it were necessary for the Aboriginal groups that make claims for<br />
them to pay their way as the farmers have to pay their's, the situation would be<br />
different. PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Very different. And they have a legitimate complaint.<br />
LAWS: And as the farmers indirectly contribute to aboriginal legal services, it becomes even<br />
more lopsided doesn't it?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
It does.<br />
LAWS: Are you going to do something about that?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I'm going to address that in the whole package yes.<br />
LAWS:<br />
But address and do something are two different things. </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:<br />
No, well not in my language. I'm going to handle it fairly. I don't think it is right that<br />
people if you have a piece of litigation which is the product of changes that a<br />
government has made, that you should legally assist one group but not the others.<br />
You either deny legal assistance to both of them or you assist both of them.<br />
LAWS: What would you prefer?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well it depends on the circumstances. But John, I've got to fit this into it's part of<br />
a jigsaw puzzle and I'm not going to sort of.. having said it, I'm going to make a<br />
decision by Easter, I'm not going to say " now, well, look in this area I'm going to go<br />
this way". What I'm looking for in that area is fair treatment of both sides.<br />
LAWS: Yes, they haven't had it up until now.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
No they haven't no.<br />
LAWS: Just back to the doctors. As you know 2500 young doctors in NSW are striking<br />
indefinitely or taking action indefinitely over your cuts to Medicare provider numbers<br />
well, your Minister's cuts.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, no, they are ours. The Minister has the full support of the Government on this.<br />
LAWS: While we are talking about rural areas, there is a terrific shortage of doctors in rural<br />
areas and I've talked to Michael Wooldridge about this and he accepts what I say to be<br />
right. Why don't you attach provider numbers to a region rather than a person? And<br />
why can't a town that has a shortage of doctors have three, four, seven, eleven,<br />
whatever it might be, provider numbers available and then if a young doctor really<br />
wants a job he knows where he can go to get one?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, one of the I'll come to that in a moment one of the results of what we are<br />
doing in this area and for which we have been criticised by the young doctors will </p>
<p>result in more doctors going to rural areas. Because what we are doing is giving<br />
preference to people who are prepared to go into rural areas so far as their training is<br />
concerned before they can become frully blown GPs. Now we believe that is a more<br />
efficient and more effective way than trying to allocate a geographically specific<br />
provider numbers. We think if you give a general incentive for young doctors to opt<br />
for rural service, because they know they will get preferential treatment in training<br />
places, then in the, not only the long run but the short run that will help rural areas<br />
more. One of the direct beneficiaries of the policy that the doctors are criticising, or<br />
some of the doctors are criticising, are rural areas of Australia because it's going to<br />
produce more doctors for them.<br />
LAWS: Okay... PRIME MINISTER:<br />
And the other thing is we'll have better quality general practitioners because they'll be<br />
required to do more training before they can set up as general practitioners.<br />
LAWS:<br />
Well, I see that as being terrific.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I think both of those benefits, I mean, I can't understand why, well, I can understand<br />
why the young doctors are unhappy with what we are doing but as an industrial<br />
exercise it really is very foolish and very hard to defend.<br />
LAWS: It is very hard to accept too. It's not the sort of thing doctors do at the drop of a hat.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, it is very unfortunate that at a time when there is a lot of community criticism of<br />
other people in the community, I mean, I'm thinking of the transport workers, they<br />
bung on the<br />
LAWS: inaudible.... yes, deserve the criticism.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
the community, and I am very disappointed that some sections of the medical<br />
profession are supporting this. I was very pleased to hear Dr John Yu from the<br />
Children's hospital this morning say that although he sympathised with the doctors and </p>
<p>he was critical of our decision, he never condones strikes. Now, I think he is right. I<br />
think and I don't condone, I condemn strikes in the hospital system, I think they are<br />
damaging to the public, they undermine the reputation of the profession and can I say<br />
to those young doctors with the greatest of goodwill, going on strike will not induce<br />
Michael Wooldridge or John Howard to change their minds. We are not going to<br />
change our minds on this. The legislation has passed. It is fair legislation, it will deliver<br />
better general practitioners, it will get more doctors into the country and it will provide<br />
some reasonable constraint on the proliferation of Medicare provider numbers. Now,<br />
all of those things are in the long run good for public and private health in Australia,<br />
and we are simply not going to change our position.<br />
LAWS: Okay the information you gave me about encouraging young doctors to go rural areas.<br />
That's good news obviously for rural areas.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well of course it's good....<br />
LAWS: But couldn't you combine both?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, you might be able to. I mean, we...<br />
LAWS: But don't you think that would be a terrific idea. I mean, if Girilambone hasn't got any<br />
doctors and nobody wants to go to Girilambone or Texas in Queensland or the Alice<br />
or wherever.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, nothing in that area is off the table for ever and we'll look again at that. But<br />
when we examined this issue last year, and we spent some time on it, we came to the<br />
conclusion that this way of approaching it was more likely in a shorter period of time,<br />
more likely to get more doctors into the bush generally. But look, we don't have a<br />
closed mind on that, and if this doesn't work effectively we'll try another way, but we<br />
must get more people into the bush. We've got to get more doctors there.<br />
LAWS: A combination of the two would be good because doctors while encouraged to go to<br />
rural areas are going to obviously first of all choose all the rural areas that are going to<br />
be the most acceptable ones, whereas the outlying ones might still have problems and </p>
<p>then your people could say " well hang on you can't go there but there's a vacancy here<br />
or there's a couple of provider numbers there". Would that not be a..<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, it is something that we will continue to look at. We did look at that and we<br />
came to the conclusion that the path we've chosen is the best way. Maybe we can<br />
combine the two. I'm not opposed in any way to the principle of what you are<br />
advocating. I seem to recall from our discussions that there were some practical<br />
constraints about it.<br />
LAWS: Yes maybe that's it. There's been a lot of talk about small business publicly and<br />
privately. And a lot of small business people have been in touch with us from right<br />
around Australia and the consensus of opinion is that the last two months has been the<br />
crookest they can remember. Why?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, I think small business is still doing it pretty hard because...<br />
LAWS: Do you think you've done enough to help small business?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I would hope that after we bring down our response to the Bell committee report<br />
which will be in a couple of weeks' time people will believe that we've done a hell of a<br />
lot. I don't think you can ever do enough in an area like this and my message to the<br />
small business men and women listening to this programme is that we remain very<br />
sympathetic to your situation. I don't pretend that we've fixed all your problems. We<br />
have done a lot of things. We've changed the industrial relations system. We've got<br />
rid of the Brereton unfair dismissal law. From the first of July this year you'll be able<br />
to sell the business you've got and invest up to $ 5 million in another business without<br />
incurring any capital gains tax liability. Now, that is a huge shift.<br />
LAWS: Is five million dollars a small business?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I think it is.<br />
LAWS: Really? </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Five million dollars. Well there's a lot of.. . hang on.<br />
LAWS: inaudible...<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, most of the businesses are worth less than that. There are do you feel it should<br />
be higher?<br />
LAWS:<br />
Well no, I would have thought that $ 5 million isn't small business. I would have<br />
thought that was getting closer to being mid-sized....<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, the trouble is John if you I mean, some businesses have a greater good will<br />
than others and some people want to measure small business by the number of<br />
employees, some want to measure them by..<br />
LAWS: How do you measure them?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, I think it depends on what change you are bringing in. If you are bringing in a<br />
change that effects the cost of employing people, I suppose what you ought to try and<br />
do is put it as high as possible so that you get the maximum amount of help. If you are<br />
bringing in a measure on something else.... The definitions vary. Some definitions say<br />
fewer than 20 employees. Other definitions say turnover less than $ 5 million, some say<br />
turnover less than $ 2 million. We've pitched it very generously at $ 5 million. That's a<br />
very very generous change. The BRW a few months ago said it represented the most<br />
dramatic incentive for small business in 30 years. I mean, it is a very big change. It<br />
means that most of the small business men and women listening, if they sell their<br />
business and invest in something else, they'll be able to do that, not just in the same<br />
business, I mean, you'll be able to go from a newsagency to a petrol station or from a<br />
software company to something else completely unrelated to software. Now, that is a<br />
very very generous provision. That hasn't started yet. One of the problems we have in<br />
the eyes of the small business community is that a lot of the things we've, the changes<br />
we've brought in, they either have only just begun to operate, or like the capital gains<br />
tax concession they won't start operating until the first of July. On top of that there<br />
have been some falls in interest rates and they are obviously of great help but I don't<br />
expect the small business community to be cheering in the streets and I certainly won't </p>
<p>be saying to them that I feel at any stage that enough has been done. I mean, there<br />
comes a point I guess where you can't do any more but I understand that they are still<br />
doing it pretty hard because they went through a difficult recession and it is a very<br />
competitive world. The cost pressures now, it is very hard to get price increases if you<br />
are in business now because everything is so competitive. Retailing is very tough.<br />
People buy different things now. They spend more money on computers, they spend<br />
more money on games related to computers, they spend more money on travel, they<br />
spend less money on clothes.<br />
LAWS:<br />
Do you think a lot of small businesses shouldn't be there?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
As far as I am concerned there can never be enough small businesses, but some people<br />
who start in business go out of business but it's ever been thus and no government can<br />
ever stop that but what a government can do is create a reasonably sympathetic<br />
environment. LAWS: Couldn't you make it easier for them to either get in or go out, ' cause it is not easy?<br />
I mean, there are so many restrictions associated with small business that are allegedly<br />
put there to protect small business but why should...<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Most of them aren't put there to protect small business, they've been put there to<br />
protect other people and I think I mean, the unfair dismissal law is a classic example<br />
of that and it was put there to help, allegedly to help the employees not being unfairly<br />
treated yet in reality it meant that a lot of small businesses wouldn't take them on for<br />
fear of getting caught up in a court case, they try to get rid of an unsatisfactory<br />
worker. LAWS:<br />
Well, they still feel a bit that way.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, that law only started on the first of January, the first of January. Now, we'd<br />
have liked it to have started on the first of July last year, but we couldn't get it through<br />
the Senate as you know. We don't control the Senate and if we'd have had that in<br />
operation on the first of July last year perhaps of lot of people in small business now<br />
would feel more that we'd done things. It has been slower than I would have liked but<br />
that's not been the fault of the Government. If you can't get something through the<br />
Parliament, you can't have a double dissolution in the first three months you are in<br />
power. Can I say again to the small business... I understand how they feel, they are </p>
<p>still doing it very tough, I certainly won't be lecturing them about how good things are<br />
but I will be saying to them you've got a Prime Minister who understands their central<br />
role in the community and I am trying at every turn to help them because I still believe<br />
very passionately as I did before the election that getting those people going at full<br />
clip, taking risks, employing people, is the best antidote to high unemployment.<br />
LAWS:<br />
When do you think they could anticipate a change?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, I think the economy will slowly strengthen this year. But I can't be more precise<br />
than that. It's just impossible. I mean if that's a black mark against me, well, it's a<br />
black mark against me, but I'm not going to get into these stupid sort of situations<br />
where I say " by such and such a month growth will be a X or unemployment will be at<br />
Y" because you know what happens.<br />
LAWS: I didn't ask.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
No you didn't, but some people do, and then I get into a then they say, well you<br />
broke your promise, you didn't do this, you didn't do that. I mean, all I can say to the<br />
small business people is we are doing our level best as fast as we can to implement the<br />
things that we promised we'd do and we're well down the track on all of that and there<br />
are few more things. We've got a statement in response to the Bell taskforce report,<br />
and there'll be a few things in that that people haven't thought of before and I think<br />
that will help, and collectively, I reckon by the middle of the year a fair-minded man or<br />
woman in small business will say " well, things aren't marvellous but these blokes have<br />
had a go and they've tried". Now, I hope they will say that, but I do understand their<br />
difficulties. They are the engine room of the economy and they are very important to<br />
me and they are very important to my Government. I'm going to work very very hard<br />
to keep faith with them.<br />
LAWS: Okay, Prime Minister, thanks for your time, as usual you've been very generous, good<br />
to see you and let's hope we see each other again soon.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I hope so.<br />
LAWS: Prime Minister, John Howard. </p>
