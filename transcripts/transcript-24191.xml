    <content><![CDATA[<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong></p>
<p>Well, Andrew, obviously it was quite a development over the last 24 hours or so and I really appreciate the work that youâ€™ve done; our colleagues in New South Wales have done. It is absolutely vital that we maintain our vigilance because obviously there is a different kind of terror threat today to the one that we faced just a few years ago.</p>
<p>It is, it seems, a metastasising threat and the influence of our agencies at every single level, at all levels, is more important than ever.</p>
<p><strong>COMMISSIONER COLVIN:</strong></p>
<p>Thank you PM and might I just say welcome back to AFP Headquarters and to the Minister and Attorney as well.</p>
<p>You are quite right, from a law enforcement and security agency perspective this is our worst concern and the ability for people to move very quickly from an idea to an intention through to action is what law enforcement in this country is dealing with every day now.</p>
<p>It was good work by our police and security agencies to stop this attack but of course the work is not finished and as we will brief you in a minute we need to keep vigilant and continue to work on this problem.</p>
