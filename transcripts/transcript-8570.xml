PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P 3 KEATING, MP<br />
INTERVIEW WITH FRANCINE CHINN, 333, 6 JULY 1992<br />
E OE PROOF COPY<br />
C: Over the last couple of weeks we ' ye asked listeners<br />
to fax the PM and tell him what they think of our<br />
current massive unemplovment levels. He's agreed to<br />
reply and is now speaking with JJJ national affairs<br />
reporter Francine Chinn.<br />
FC: Mr Keating first of all of course, welcome to JJJ.<br />
PM: Thank you.<br />
FC: We have been asking our listeners to either fax,<br />
write or phone in their concerns about youth<br />
unemployment so what we might do first of all is<br />
play you a very short montage to give you an idea of<br />
some of the main questions that have been asked.<br />
Fl: I think the thing is that people can see that we are<br />
under a recession at the moment and that there's<br />
growing numbers of unemployeqdyeople in this<br />
country. They feel lost and their life is<br />
meaningless, there's nothing to look forward to.<br />
R: Do you think training is an answer to some of the<br />
problems?<br />
F2: I don't know because then we're going to have really<br />
well trained unemployed people. Maybe the gap<br />
between the unemployment benefit and the lowest pay<br />
is a little bit too large. Because if you see a job<br />
that is only marginally more than the unemployment<br />
rate, you don't go for it anyway.<br />
R: So do you think it's necessary once you leave school<br />
to go on and do more training?<br />
Ml Yes certainly, you won't get a job otherwise.<br />
M2: I'd just like to ask Mr Keating why the Austudy<br />
independent age cannot be lowered to 22. How can </p>
<p>2<br />
you say that there's incentive there for anyone to<br />
retrain to make themselves more employable. I just<br />
don't understand<br />
FC: Prime Minister, you've just heard some of the<br />
concerns our listeners have raised on youthisu<br />
unemployment. First of all though the iq~ su<br />
today is the Opposition's proposed youth wage. * Dr<br />
Hewson has announced a scheme to r-duce award wages<br />
which would mean an income of $ 114 per w-jeek for<br />
under 18s and $ 133 a week for those 18 to 20 year<br />
olds. Can we just get maybe you comments on that<br />
proposed youth wage.<br />
PM: Well I think the main thing to understand about that<br />
is Dr Hewson said to them, well I know what's good<br />
for you, that is basically to slash your wages.<br />
That is for those who actually have a job would have<br />
their wages cut and for the low wage you would then<br />
propose rather than regard years 15 to 19 as a<br />
period of preparation for life or as a period for<br />
vocational preparation, that is providing the<br />
opportunity of vocational training for work in the<br />
rest of their lives. Dr Hewson is simply proposing<br />
to go back to the dead end job, he provides no<br />
training, but proposes to cut their wages. So in<br />
other words, anyone who has a job ought to be very<br />
nervous about his proposal. For instance, somebody<br />
an apprentice, 19 years of age would be on at the<br />
moment about $ 312 a week, they'd go back to $ 133,<br />
less than half their current pay and it won't create<br />
any new jobs. He talks about training by talking<br />
about seventy million for technical and further<br />
education, it's just a drop in the ocean. In other<br />
words, he's not going to train anybody, he said<br />
you're in the dead end job and you're staying there,<br />
we'll just simply cut your wages. So all those of<br />
you who have got a job will have your wages cut and<br />
those of you who might get a job will have it cut to<br />
$ 117 or $ 130 and no training and that's it. That's<br />
all the government is going to do for under me, says<br />
Dr Hewson you're on your own.<br />
FC: But surely this kind of idea of a youth wage is<br />
something that you yourself are tossing around.<br />
Isn't that the type of incentive that small business<br />
has been looking for? Surely it's enough incentive<br />
to create more jobs?<br />
PM: But we are not tossing that around. Understand<br />
that, the Government is not tossing that around.<br />
It's talking about entry level training wages, in<br />
other words provid-ing tfhe -place66 in-te -hical -and<br />
further education as we provided the places in<br />
university and have a wage where people have jo2b<br />
experience, where they are productive on the job,<br />
but where they are also trained. In other words,<br />
they are prepared vocationally for life. Dr Hewson </p>
<p>has no such proposal in mind, it has nothing to do<br />
with training, this is simply a way of slashing<br />
wages for young people. As the Coalition has tried<br />
to slash wages for everybody for all of its<br />
history.<br />
FC: On this issue of training Prime Minister, you heard<br />
in one of the concerns earlier, in the montage we<br />
played you, Kicki from Melbourne who wants to know<br />
what's the use of training when the jobs still<br />
aren't out there when you finish your course?<br />
PM: The jobs were out there in the 1980s, when the<br />
economy was growing quite strongly the jobs have<br />
been taken up for trained people. The kind of<br />
untrained job, the unskilled job, the so called dead<br />
end job that might have been around in the 1960s and<br />
early 1970s is largely now done by computers in<br />
clerical work, in retailing, they are just not<br />
there, those jobs simply do not exist any more at<br />
any price. This is the problem with Dr Hewson's<br />
proposal at $ 117 or $ 130 the job is not there at<br />
any price, so what do they think they are doing for<br />
people? Whereas what we're saying is the Government<br />
has lifted the retention rates in schools, lifted<br />
enormously the through put through universities, and<br />
is now proposing that in technical and further<br />
education so that people come into the new economy<br />
which has got skilled jobs and where they can take<br />
their place in society over the long run.<br />
FC: Prime Minister, Craig Mackee from Hawthorn in<br />
Victoria was a listener who says, it's now time for<br />
a bipartisan approach to be taken on the issue of<br />
youth unemployment. Isn't it a serious enough issue<br />
for you and the Opposition to stop playing politics<br />
and get together on this?<br />
PM: No you can't cheapen this issue by the easy resort<br />
to the call for bipartisanship. This has been a<br />
problem issue, entry level training wages and<br />
training for the last couple of decades. The<br />
Liberal Party ignored it. They had every change of<br />
bipartisanship when they were in government, didn't<br />
do anything about it. We're as always the only<br />
party that will get these breakthroughs. They were<br />
happy to leave 3 kids in 10 complete secondary<br />
school, that's what there was in 1983, 7 in 10 they<br />
were happy not to be trained. That is now 7 in<br />
completing secondary school, 35-40 per cent of them<br />
going through to universities in places we created.<br />
We're the ones, the Government, the Labor Party are<br />
the ones interested in taking the whole employment<br />
and training prospects, education, vocational<br />
education for young people into life and at the<br />
meeting I intend to hold on this subject will try<br />
and get breakthroughs in these areas. But it is Dr<br />
Hewson who has chosen rather than wait and see what </p>
<p>the government was able to produce at the meeting,<br />
to jump in and have a meeting where we heard a lot<br />
about the problems and nothing about the solution.<br />
And the solution is a slashing of wages with no<br />
training.<br />
FC: Well what's your solution Mr Keating? Real jobs for<br />
young people, what's your solution?<br />
PM: The solution is to regard 15-19 as largely a period<br />
of vocational education, both in school, university<br />
an~ d technical and f urther education. The problem<br />
I'm working on is the group who are, if you like, in<br />
the middle of that transition, the ones who are now<br />
looking for full time work, who will not be part of<br />
that long term transition envisaged by the<br />
Carmichael recommendations. How do we help them<br />
n-owi-That's -what I'm trying to do. How do we help<br />
those people, to get them training so that they are<br />
not caught in the dead end job in the dead end<br />
street of life and work. That's what I'm focussing<br />
on. Dr Hewson is not focussing on that at all.<br />
He's just simply saying, look, cut their wages and<br />
maybe someone will pick them up. Maybe someone will<br />
pick them up cheap, but don't invest any national<br />
effort in their lives, don't invest any national<br />
effort in their vocational education, or their<br />
academic education, just see whether there is a job<br />
for them, when he knows as I know the dead end job<br />
have just about disappeared.<br />
FC: Mr Keating, again we received a lot of questions<br />
about the proposed job summit. I'll give you just<br />
one as an example. Damon from Perth asked why<br />
should a group of politicians who have no real idea<br />
or concept of unemployment, let alone youth<br />
unemployment, be discussing it? Where are the young<br />
people and the young unemployed people at your Job<br />
Summit?<br />
PM: The young unemployed people will be well represented<br />
at this Summit.<br />
FC: How?<br />
PM: The Youth Action Coalition is going to be there, and<br />
they re-present young people, and they represent a<br />
coalition of young people. And as well as that, I<br />
myself have taken opportunities in Adelaide and<br />
Perth to meet substantial and representative groups<br />
of young people in these positions. And what<br />
they've said to me has been quite interesting. But<br />
again, it's going to require Government action.<br />
FC: Do you agree with Kim Beazley that you know what<br />
young people want, and that's jobs and don't<br />
necessarily need to talk to them? </p>
<p>PM: The first thing they need is vocational preparation,<br />
first and foremost, and job experience, that we<br />
know. I think what we're finding out in our<br />
consultations is the difficulty they have in getting<br />
it, or even in the preparation period to get it, the<br />
costs and problems in getting it. That is why the<br />
government and the political system must function<br />
and get changes in society, in business, to let the<br />
unskilled person get out of the rut. But the<br />
difference between us and Dr Hewson is he wants to<br />
leave them in the rut, cut their wages and leave<br />
them untrained.<br />
FC: Prime Minister, what's your jobs growth prediction<br />
now for the next Budget year in the light of some of<br />
the grim news and the bad economic figures we've<br />
been hearing?<br />
PM: We're now redoing them for the Budget, and the<br />
Budget is a month away.<br />
FC: OK. Just on the_ Budet, since 1987 we've been<br />
hearing lots of promises, especially as far a jobs<br />
for young people are concerned. What are you going<br />
to offer Australia's youth in your Budget coming out<br />
in August.<br />
PM: I was Treasurer for eight and a half years. When I<br />
became Treasurer we had a work force of 6 million.<br />
Even today, with the unemployment we have, we have a<br />
work force of 7 1/ 2 million. It's a quarter larger.<br />
New Zealand across the way, which Dr Hewson points<br />
to, has fewer people in work than they had in 1983.<br />
So we had a lot of growth, it stopped in the<br />
recession, we want to restart it, we believe that<br />
will happen, and the growth prospects for young<br />
people in that kind of an economy as we had it in<br />
the late 1980s, was very good. It will be very good<br />
again, particularly for people who are trained.<br />
Because of the nature of the economy has changed<br />
the old industrial archaeology, bequeathed to<br />
Australia by the Liberal Party, was put asunder in<br />
the ' 80s for a newer, more technically innovative,<br />
product-innovative economy. And it is in that<br />
economy that people will have to find their place,<br />
and they'll find it basically by being prepared for<br />
it and not forgotten by governments.<br />
FC: So you're still optimistic that by the time that we<br />
try to get the huge amount, that you admit, of<br />
unemployed that are there through training courses,<br />
which we hope to hear more about from the result of<br />
your Jobs Summit, the economy up will be<br />
sufficiently enough to provide the jobs for them?<br />
PM: We're not saying we can eradicate unemployment in<br />
this area overnight. I'm not saying that. But<br />
understand that we are dealing with two streams of </p>
<p>problems here. We're looking at the long run, which<br />
is about high retention rates in schools, capacity<br />
for people to go through university and technical<br />
and further education, to prepare themselves for an<br />
ongoing job, and for life. That's the ongoing<br />
agenda that the Carmichael Report, amongst other<br />
things, addresses. The short run agenda is the<br />
people who are not streamed into that, because we<br />
haven't got that all up and running now, as yet.<br />
We've got part of it up and running we've got<br />
higher retention rates in schools and universities,<br />
we're about to try to lift TAFE more. The secondrun<br />
problem is to try to get the people who are, in<br />
a sense, in the middle, the ones who are not<br />
trained, haven't stayed in school, and don't have<br />
Job prospects. That's what the meeting is focussing<br />
on, both the long and the short run. What our<br />
opponents in the Opposition say is forget the long<br />
and the short run, let's just slash their wages and<br />
leave them, see what happens to them.<br />
FC: The other issue is, of course, Mr Keating, there are<br />
a lot of young people out there who are hurting, who<br />
are trying to survive on what amounts to very<br />
little, on the dole. Will you be addressing those<br />
questions of what AYPAC has also called a living<br />
income? Will you be addressing that kind of issue<br />
at your job summit?<br />
PM: We have, over the ' 80s, dramatically lifted the<br />
dole, as you put it, and AUSTUDY, and we've<br />
dramatically lifted the number of people in work,<br />
notwithstanding what's happened with unemployment.<br />
And the main thing I think now, and we have aligned,<br />
we ' ye produced a sort of common level of payment for<br />
youth, which now does not discriminate in favour of<br />
one kind of payment or another, encouraging people<br />
onto the dole, or encouraging them into something<br />
else. And I think what we'd like to do now is to<br />
see if we can overcome this problem I speak to you<br />
about, about the people caught in the middle between<br />
the higher participation and training opportunities<br />
of the new order economy, and the people in the dead<br />
end areas of no training in the old order, the<br />
remnants of the old order economy.<br />
Q Mr Keating just to move along a little bit more, we<br />
as a signatory to Agenda 21, the environmental<br />
agreement that Ros Kelly signed at Rio, your<br />
Government has agreed to incorporate consultations<br />
with young people in decisions made on the<br />
environment. How are you going to institute that<br />
process, and would you be prepared to to the<br />
similar process when it comes to dealing with youth<br />
unemployment?<br />
PM: Well I think Mrs Kelly will come back to the Cabinet<br />
as required on that subject in fulfilment of that </p>
<p>commitment. We accept and welcome the fact that<br />
young Australians have a very keen view about the<br />
environment, which is wise of them, and it is a good<br />
thing for the political system that they do. I only<br />
hope that those of us in the higher echelons of the<br />
system can live up to their expectations about the<br />
environment and keep the environmental changes<br />
coming through. But consultation has been part and<br />
parcel of the way this Government has functioned, we<br />
believe you can't change Australia without getting a<br />
consensus on subjects, whether it be on wages, on<br />
inflation, on fiscal policy, on trade, on anything<br />
and the environment is part of that. And the ESD<br />
discussions we have been having are basically about<br />
that ecologically sustainable development, it is<br />
basically a process, a consultancy process, a<br />
cooperative process to look at environmental issues.<br />
Q: So Mr Keating you are a strong believer in consensus<br />
way of running your Government?<br />
PM: Well we have done it now for a decade just on, and I<br />
think if one wants to hand down the tablets from on<br />
high, govern by press release and administrative<br />
fiat you won't get the changes that we were able to<br />
get through the accord with the trade unions, I mean<br />
the great changes of the ' 80s in policy support for<br />
women, for the aged, childcare, aged care,<br />
occupational superannuation, medicare, all these<br />
things form a cooperative program, and I don't<br />
believe that you can break structural impediments,<br />
road-blocks in an economy like this without<br />
harnessing community support. When a Government<br />
wins an election it gets the keys to the kingdom,<br />
but it doesn't get the kingdom, it has got to draw<br />
the power down from the community and you can only<br />
draw that down by some sort of cooperative,<br />
discursive framework.<br />
Q: Well Mr Keating just on an election, will we have an<br />
election Budget first of all? A-n-dsecondly any tips<br />
on when we can expect an election, and why should<br />
young people vote for you in the first place?<br />
PM: Well the reason young people, I think, should vote<br />
for the Government, whenever an election is held is<br />
that we have been the ones to tackle the fact that<br />
Australia did become an industrial museum that gave<br />
them no hope and no participation, that has made it<br />
into a more interesting country, a more interesting<br />
economy, now with low inflation and long term low<br />
inflationary growth prospects and with a better<br />
chance of being able to pay for our imports, and<br />
hence pay for ourselves. In doing that we set up a<br />
new economy with a decent social wage, where we are<br />
not hopping into the unemployed, kicking them out<br />
after nine months as Dr Hewson would, where we are<br />
not going to make those who are sick pay through the </p>
<p>nose particularly if they are low paid. We have<br />
tried to change the economy to a modern order<br />
economy but do it with a Labor heart. I think that<br />
is why they should vote for us and on issues like<br />
the environment we have been the only party to break<br />
the big barriers on the environment with those big<br />
brush strokes, big milestone changes of the<br />
the last, including one that I was involved with,<br />
that is the preservation of the Antarctica as a<br />
wilderness park was a great achievement.<br />
0: Well Mr Keating it sounds like the main reason that<br />
young people should perhaps vote for you is because<br />
rather then all the positive things that you are<br />
achieving it's perhaps all the negatives of what<br />
could happen under Dr Hewson?<br />
PM: No, no. We have given young Australians a future.<br />
We have given them a place in the fastest growing<br />
area in the world, the Asia-Pacific, in an economy<br />
which is now externally oriented and has a potential<br />
for a lot, over the longer haul, vitality at lower<br />
rates of inflation and where we can see lots of<br />
interesting jobs created in the manufacturing and<br />
services sector of the economy which is providing<br />
employment in cities and regional cities of<br />
Australia where most people live. That's why they<br />
should support the Government and in doing it in a<br />
way which is socially accommodating. Our opponents<br />
are basically in a survival of the fittest<br />
mentality. If you are not a millionaire you are a<br />
lay about, if you want to work we will slash your<br />
wages and then you might get yourself a job, we<br />
might be able to find you a job, you won't be able<br />
to live on it but it doesn't matter we might be able<br />
to find you one if someone is good enough to give<br />
you one. If you want to put yourself through<br />
university you have got to have parents who can<br />
provide $ 12,000 to $ 13,000 a year for a university<br />
place. This sort of hardhearted approach won't do<br />
anything for Australia, and Australian young people.<br />
Q: Do you understand why so many of Australia's young<br />
people are disillusioned with policy, with what they<br />
see in Question Time do you understand why so many<br />
of them think well neither of these people really<br />
understand what's going on outside, they don't<br />
understand me and how I live on the dole?<br />
PM: Well we try and understand them and we try and<br />
remedy their position, I say we the Government. But<br />
what we have certainly done we have done as no other<br />
Australian political party has done and taken on the<br />
big problem of Australian politics, that is a change<br />
of the Australia economy from a dead-end economy to<br />
a live-end economy in the Asia-Pacific, which in the<br />
long-run gives them a life long chance, now everyone<br />
else laid down on the job in the ' 60s and ' 70s and </p>
<p>early ' 80s and this huge structural transition to a<br />
better place with more interesting jobs and higher<br />
incomes is the thing we have done. And we have also<br />
said three kids in ten completing secondary school<br />
not good enough for us, can't have a smart country,<br />
a clever country with only three people completing<br />
secondary studies, that's now as I say seven going<br />
eight nearly in ten and we have added 50 per cent of<br />
places to universities we have created the<br />
equivalent of twelve new universities since 1985,<br />
120,000 places, we have got about 35 or 40 per cent<br />
of students coming out of secondary school now going<br />
through universities and we are now trying to pull<br />
up TAFE. No-one else did this the Liberals were<br />
happy to leave it and say seven in ten of you, we<br />
are quite happy for to drift out of school and not<br />
even complete secondary school and untrained,<br />
unskilled left in the furrows of the old Australian<br />
economy, I mean we didn't do that, and that's why I<br />
think that if young Australians want to look at the<br />
process they are entitled to be questioning about it<br />
but they are not entitled to be cynical about it,<br />
because if ever there is a group of people have<br />
taken on the structural change that no-one else<br />
would tamper with because it was just to hard, we<br />
have, but we have included them in it by saying it<br />
was totally unacceptable to just leave them, seven<br />
in ten of them leave school unprepared.<br />
Q: Mr Keating it sounds as though an election might be<br />
in a lot closer then some people are thinking?<br />
PM: Well you keep talking about an election, there is no<br />
election imminent anywhere.<br />
Q: Well do you think, I mean a lot of people are<br />
saying......<br />
PM: This has got nothing to do with elections<br />
whatsoever.<br />
Q: But still a lot of people are saying that it seems<br />
that the young jobless are becoming the latest<br />
political football with an election in mind?<br />
PM: No, no. I took this issue up, youth and entry level<br />
training wages with my colleague Kim Beazely, the<br />
Government has been looking at this question now for<br />
a few years, we are the ones that took up high<br />
participation rates in school and in post compulsory<br />
education. I am the one holding the discussion to<br />
try and get some of these areas broken through. The<br />
football comes from Dr Hewson jumping on the band<br />
wagon, not with a solution to the problem but just<br />
trying to slash their wages and leave them, so don't<br />
mix him up with us. I mean we are about a long run<br />
change here of quality and we are the only people </p>
<p>who have initiated it and as usual will be the only<br />
people to complete it.<br />
0: Prime Minister we have a whole stack of letters and<br />
things we will pass on to you that outlines the<br />
questions that have been asked, just to try and wrap<br />
this up though the environment has been a big one,<br />
it is something which we get quite a lot about, can<br />
you just tell us can the Government in some way<br />
match up caring for the environment with jobs for<br />
young people?<br />
PM: Well I think so, one of the things we are looking at<br />
is a proposition in employing young people in land<br />
-care type jobs and training situations whereth<br />
environment, where they can do something that is<br />
related directly to the environment. It is one of<br />
the options that we will consider for this meeting,<br />
but it has its complexities in establishing it, in<br />
managing it, but it would directly be of value.<br />
0: Well just finally, of course music was another thing<br />
that is very strong as far as Triple JJJ is<br />
concerned we would like to ask you if you have, are<br />
you aware of much contemporary music?<br />
PM: Well not as I used to be, I am an old rocker not a<br />
young rocker.<br />
0: Well we were wondering if you have a particular<br />
track that you might like to suggest that we can<br />
play for you?<br />
PM: Well anything from INXS, I have had a bit to do with<br />
them over the period, I like them.<br />
0: And they are probably quite an appropriate one as<br />
well, Mr keating also we have a gift set for you<br />
celebrating the ABCs 60th anniversary we have a CD<br />
set from the Sydney Symphony Orchestra and for your<br />
son<br />
PM: What's in it?<br />
Q: That's something you would have a much better idea<br />
than I.<br />
PM: Let's have a look.<br />
Q: Any good stuff in it?<br />
PM: I can't see the title, but there is a lot I<br />
recognise here. Dance Russian Spectacular, Romance<br />
overtures, but I am afraid the titles are buried in<br />
the box.<br />
Q: Well that's something which can be a surprise later<br />
on, we also have for Patrick your son who we hope is </p>
<p>a bit of a Triple JJJ listener we have a couple of<br />
things for him including a T-shirt, cap etc we just<br />
interviewed John Hewson, I believe he has sworn that<br />
he is going to wear his Triple JJJ T-shirt whilst<br />
jogging, so maybe we can see you wearing Patricks a<br />
bit later on. And also or course the letters that<br />
we have received from our listeners and we hope that<br />
you will actually read these in the lead-up to your<br />
PM: I do, I read a tremendous amount of correspondence<br />
that comes through and particularly things which are<br />
topical as the jobs meeting is, and where young<br />
peoples views are to be considered and considered<br />
carefully. So we will do our best with it, but the<br />
main thing I would say to you in conclusion, and<br />
thanks for having me on, is to say that we are here<br />
for a long run change and a short run change, two<br />
streams here for people, but basically to repair<br />
themselves, a vocational education for later on in<br />
their life, to give them a real life with an<br />
interesting job and good pay.<br />
Q: Well Mr Keating there is a lot of young people out<br />
there hurting so we just hope that you are right.<br />
And again just thank you, at the risk of sounding<br />
like John Clarke, Prime Minister thank you for<br />
talking to me and Triple JJJ will always welcome you<br />
back if you would like to talk to us in the lead-up<br />
to the next election at whatever stage that may be.<br />
PM: Thank you Francine.<br />
