    <content><![CDATA[<p>It gives me great pleasure to announce two new Australian funding initiatives to support economic growth and poverty reduction in Vietnam.</p>
<p>Australia will provide $10 million in 2006-07 to the World Bank's Poverty Reduction Support Credits (PRSC) program. This funding will support Vietnam's economic growth and poverty reduction by assisting its transition to a market economy and modernising governance and public administration.</p>
<p>Australia will also be supporting Vietnam's accession to the World Trade Organisation (WTO) by providing $2 million to assist Vietnam develop its WTO implementation action plan and advance its economic integration agenda.</p>
<p>Vietnam is our fourth largest development partner and a major recipient of Australian scholarships, with 150 Vietnamese students awarded Australian Development Scholarships each year to undertake postgraduate study in Australia.</p>
<p>These new Australian contributions will advance further our efforts to support Vietnam's economic reforms, which have seen the proportion of the population living in poverty fall by more than two-thirds over the past two decades.</p>
