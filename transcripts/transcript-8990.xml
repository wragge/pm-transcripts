PRIME MINISTER 109/ 93<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME NINISTER, THE RON P. J. KEATING HP<br />
REPORT OF THE REPUBLIC ADVISORY COMM4ITTEE<br />
I met with the Republic Advisory Committee this morning<br />
to receive its report " An Australian Republic the<br />
Options". The report is based on extensive consultations<br />
thoroughout Australia. It is substantial, thorough and<br />
professional and will provide an excellent basis for<br />
public debate.<br />
The report canvasses a number of practical options for an<br />
Australian republic. While recognising that the Issuie is<br />
a complex one, it clearly demonstrates that Australia can<br />
become a republic without changing our current system of<br />
government. As required by the Committee's terms of reference, the<br />
report makes no recommendations.<br />
The Government does not have a timetable for a republic<br />
but it hopes to see a republican structure in place by<br />
the turn of the century. It is essential that pAtnple<br />
have time to consider the issues.<br />
The report is being made available to the public to<br />
provide a factual base for community debate which munt<br />
precede any change, For in the end it will be the people<br />
who decide whether Australia becomes a republic.<br />
The Government will study the report carefully with a<br />
view to developing a considered position on the central<br />
issues. To this end, I propose to establish a small working party<br />
of senior Ministers to consider the issues and develop a<br />
p aper for Cabinet in the first half of next year.<br />
The working party will include Gareth Evans, Kim BeazlAy.<br />
Michael Lavarcht Graham Richardson, Roo Kelly and Frank<br />
Walker. I would like to thank Malcolm Turnbull and his colleagues<br />
on the Committee for the great dedication and energy they<br />
have brought to the task. </p>
<p>2<br />
The report they have written will provide an invaluable<br />
resource for the people of Australia as we consider the<br />
destiny of our nation.<br />
