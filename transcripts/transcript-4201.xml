During his visit the Prime Minister held talks with the President,<br />
the Vice President, and Cabinet Secretaries, and met senior<br />
members of Congress.<br />
The Prime Minister and the President agreed that<br />
the visit reemphasised and strengthened the cordiality of the<br />

reinforced the close ties between the two Governments0<br />
The President and the Prime Minister recognised that<br />
all nations should. treat each other its eqjuals despite differences<br />
in power, size and circumstance. The President expressed the<br />
view that there was a significant role for countries of<br />
Australia's material wealth and power in influencing opinion<br />
in the world. The President said that the United States<br />
intended to work closely with her friends and allies, with<br />
those of common philosophical commitment; to achieve a greater<br />
unity of purpose and understanding between such nations, large<br />
and small0 In this regard the President and the Prime Minister<br />
agreed that relations between nations reflected more than factors<br />
of power. National interests, common principles, frankness of<br />
expression and mutual trust were also very significant in<br />
determining relations between nations.<br />
The President reaffirmed the determination of the<br />
United States to pursue a policy of peace through strength,<br />
to relax tensions where it was possible without sacrifice<br />
of interests or principles, and to build a stable world order0<br />
The President and the Prime Minister agreed that shared<br />
democratic values and the goal of peace linked the international<br />
aims of Australia and the United States.<br />
The Prime Minister expressed the belief that the<br />
United States had a unique leadership role and mission as the<br />
world's most powerful democracy0 The President and Prime<br />
Minister agreed that the steady pursuit of that mission<br />
was essential for the stability and peaceful development of<br />
the nations of the world. The President noted the need for<br />
continuing close collaboration with friends and allies including<br />
Australia. The President and Prime Minister noted the importance<br />
of maintaining the cohesion and constancy of alliances in / 2 </p>
<p>present international circumstances, and the importance<br />
of conventional forces in conditions of nuclear parity.<br />
In -this connection they agreed on the desirability of<br />
maintaining the excellent record of consultation and<br />
cooperation that has characterised the ANZUS relationship.<br />
The President and the Prime Ministcr agreed on the<br />
political and strategic importance of the Indian Ocean to<br />
many countries including Australia and the United States0<br />
Noting the importance of achieving and maintaining an adequate<br />
balance, Australia supported United States efforts to upgrade<br />
the facilities at Diego Garcia. Both leaders expressed the<br />
hope that all parties concerned would exercise restraint in this<br />
key area. The President and Prime Minister agreed that the<br />
sustained growth in the military capability of the W-arsaw P-act<br />
countries beyond l evels ap arenitly justif ied f or def ensive<br />
purposes, to which the NATO countries had drawn attention, was<br />
a matter of concern not only in Europe but throughout the<br />
world. The Prime Minister gave the President an account of<br />
his recent visits to the people's republic of China and Japan.<br />
He explained the great importance to Australia of its<br />
relationship with Japan and the steps taken during his visit<br />
to enhance the political and economic relationship and to<br />
forge closer links of understanding between the two peoples.<br />

cordial relationships Australia and the U. S. enjoy with Japan<br />
are essential to the continued stability, progress, and<br />
prosperity of the international community. They each pledged<br />
to maintain and strenthen those ties.<br />
The Prime Minister emphasized that widening<br />
communication between Australia and China and between China<br />
and many other countries, was of great importance. The<br />
President agreed that effective communication with and the<br />
involvement of the people's republic of China are important to<br />
the promotion of peace and progress, and reaffirmed that the<br />
United States is determined to complete the process of<br />
normalizing its relations with the People's Republic of China<br />
on the basis of the Shanghai Communique.<br />
The Prime Minister and the President reiterated<br />
the fundamental importance which their countries attach to their<br />
relations with Southeast Asian nations and noted the significance<br />
of ASEAN, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, as a<br />
stabilizing influence in the region. They reaffirmed an<br />
interest they share with ASEAN that no one power should<br />
dominate Southeast Asia.<br />
The President and the Prime Minister discussed the<br />
current situation in the Middle East and Southern Africa.<br />
They expressed concern about the continuing instability in<br />
Lebanon. The Prime Minister commended the continued efforts<br />
of the United States in its search for a settlement in the<br />
Middle East. Both deplored the continuation of racial 3 </p>
<p>injustices in the minority-ruled countries of Africa, and<br />
condemned any practices which did not accord true dignity<br />
to all1 people as equals regardless of race.<br />
In reviewing the world economic situation the<br />
President gave the Prime Minister an outline of discussions<br />
at the recent economic summit in Puerto Rico. They agreed<br />
that the United States and Australia, together with other<br />
industrialised democracies must continue to pursuc an economic<br />
strategy directed at achieving sustained economic expansion<br />
and a reduction in unemployment while not jeopardising the<br />
common aim of reducing and avoiding a new wave of inflation.<br />
This strategy would require the application of continued<br />
disciplined measures in the field of fiscal and monetary<br />
policies. They recognised that a period of sustained noninflationary<br />
growth in the major industrialised nations will<br />
make a major contribution to the economic progress of the<br />
developing countries. The President and the Prime Minister<br />
reviewed developments in the dialogue between the industrialised<br />
and developing nations and agreed on the need for a continued<br />
effort in the various international fora for a constructive<br />
long-term relationship of common benefit.<br />
The President and the Prime Minister agreed that a<br />
more open international trading system was in the interest of<br />
both developed and developing nations, and stressed the need<br />
for increased momentum in the multilateral trade negotiations<br />
now behind held in Geneva. They agreed that increases in<br />
trade opportunities, particularly in processed goods and<br />
agricultural products, would help to lift the standard of<br />
living in the developing countries.<br />
The President and the Prime Minister had discussions<br />
about Australia's commercial relations with the United States.<br />
It was agreed that further progress in the trading relationship<br />
would be to the advantage of each country.<br />
The Prime Minister gave the President an outline<br />
of recent changes in Australia's foreign investment policy.<br />
He indicated an increased need for foreign investment in<br />
Australia in partnership with Australian investors. He<br />
therefore welcomed such investment to help develop Australia's<br />
great national resources to the advantage of Australia and of<br />
Australia's trading partners.<br />
The Prime Minister conveyed to the President the<br />
good wishes of the Australian people on the occasion of the<br />
American Bicentenary. The Australian Government was participating<br />
in a range of activities to celebrate the occasion. The<br />
Prime Minister said he was looking forward to his visit to<br />
Harvard University to inaugurate the Chair of Australian<br />
Studies. He expressed the hope that this Chair would be used to<br />
advance understanding not merely between the United States<br />
and Australia but between both countries and other nations<br />
with different history, traditions and culture. o99/. 4 </p>

The President and the Prime Minister considered that<br />
their discussions had shown a very close similarity of views<br />
on a wide range of important international and bilateral<br />
matters and had further strengthened ties between Australia<br />
and the United States. The Prime Minister thanked the President<br />
and Mrs Ford for the warmth of the welcome and the hospitality<br />
extended to him and to Mrs Fraser and to members of his party. </p>
