STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HOW P J KEATING XP<br />
THE GOVERNMENT'S MABO LEGISLATION<br />
Those trying to turn the screws on the Government in<br />
relation to the Native TitleBill, are playing into the<br />
hands of the opponents of justice for Aboriginal people<br />
and a sound and workable outcome on Mabo.<br />
The Bill is principled, balanced and workable. It is the<br />
product of a process of analysis, consultation and<br />
negotiation as thorough as any undertaken.<br />
The Bill reflects an agreement reached with Aboriginal<br />
representatives. Mr Mansell and others participated at<br />
various times In the process. The door was never closed<br />
to them. As far as the Government is aware, the<br />
Aboriginal representatives the Government negotiated with<br />
stand by the agreement reached.<br />
The Government certainly does.<br />
The Bill will be passed this week by the House of<br />
Representatives. It will then go to th~ e Senate. The<br />
Government will be urging passage in the Senate before<br />
the Parliament rises.<br />
The Government is obviously prepared to consider<br />
proposals which improve the Bill. But it will not accept<br />
any proposal which is outside the policy parameters to<br />
which the Government is totally committed.<br />
The Government has asked the -Green Senators for their<br />
proposed " holding" Bill. They have not yet been able to<br />
provide it. The Government's initial view, on the basis<br />
of legal advice, is that the concept is unlikely to be<br />
feasible. I met this morning with several Aboriginal<br />
representatives who put forward various proposals for<br />
change to the Bill.-I made it completely clear that a<br />
number of these were simply unacceptable.<br />
For example, vesting of mineral rights in native title<br />
holders and a right of veto over developments on native<br />
title lands cannot be accepted. </p>

Mr Rob Riley amongst many others, was urging as late as<br />
this week that the Bill be passed by the Senate<br />
expeditiously. Mr Riley should heed his own advice, as<br />
should Mr Mansell and the rest of this group. It is the<br />
same advice coming from moat other respected Aboriginal<br />
leaders. In short, the Government has a Bill before the Parliament<br />
and will be pressing for its passage.<br />
