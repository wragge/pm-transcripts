NOTES FOR THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON. E. G. WHITLAM, M. P.,<br />
FOR A SPEECH AT ST PAUL'S HALL, IPSWICH, 18 NOVEMBERk 1974<br />
1. I am proud to share this platform tonight with<br />
Rex Connor, the Minister for Minerals and Energy. The people<br />
of this city and this State have no greater friend and<br />
benefactor. Labor's policies for the development of our coal,<br />
minerals and other resources are in the best of hands.<br />
Rex Connor's handling of our mineral resources has safeguarded<br />
Australian ownership and vastly increased the returns to<br />
Australian producers from the sale of our exports. His<br />
achievements will ensure. They will be gratefully acknowledged<br />
by millions of Australians today and in generations to come.<br />
2. Queenslanders in particular should examine the<br />
fruits of Labor's policies on-. minerals and energy. The future<br />
of Queenslands coal industry has never looked brighter. Exports<br />
are at a record level, both in volume -and price. The Labor<br />
Government by careful planning and diligent negotiation has<br />
secured fair returns on our mineral exports for the benefit of*<br />
all Australians. We have carefully supervised contract tender<br />
prices. Between January last year and September this year<br />
increases negotiated in the export prices of Queensland coal<br />
total $ 1836 million over the full terms of all coal export<br />
contracts. The value of the increases actually received during<br />
this period is approximately $ 100 million.<br />
3. The facts can no longer be suppressed by the Queensland<br />
Government they are crucial to Queensland's future development<br />
and prosperity. The export controls imposed on black coal<br />
exports from Queensland and New South Wales to Japan, Europe<br />
and elsewhe~ re have been outstandingly successful. Coal exporting<br />
companies are no longer fighting each other and cutting prices.<br />
Above all we have put an end to interstate competition which was<br />
resulting in lower returns to Australia as a whole. It is one<br />
thing for Australia to compete with other countries for markets.<br />
It is absurd for one Australian state to compete with another.<br />
4. Japanese coal buyers. now acce, the value of dealing<br />
with the. Australian coal industry under tne new export controls<br />
system. -They know there is a certainty of supply at a fair<br />
price and that the guarantee of the Australian Government stands<br />
behind Queensland coal producers. As a result of Rex Connor' s<br />
negotiations the Japanese have made known their. requirements<br />
of coking coal an&amp;~ steaming coal up to the year 1980. This<br />
information will enable the Australian Government to plan in<br />
conjunction with Queensland coal producers and other members of<br />
the Australian Coal Association for the further development of<br />
existing mines, increases * in their labour force improvement in<br />
rail transport and harbour coal loading and other shipping<br />
facilities. The visit of Prime Minister Tanaka to Australia<br />
confirmed these arrangements. Australian-Japanese trading<br />
relations are at their highest level of trust, cordiality and<br />
mutual benefit. . A 77-7-1 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
Contrast the benefits that Labor has brought to Queensland<br />
with the benefits Mr Bjelke-Petersen has refused. By refusing<br />
to co-operate in our plans for a growth centre at Townsville, by<br />
refusing to co-operate in our plans for land acquisition to bring<br />
down the price of land, Mr Bjelke-Petersen has thrown away<br />
million in Australian Government assistance to Queensland. Labor's<br />
policies are not only brining in hundreds of millions of extra dollars<br />
in export earnings. At the same time we are giving money to the<br />
States on an unprecendented scale. Queensland has received more<br />
from my Government than it received from any previous Government<br />
in history. Yet Mr Bjelke-Petersen constantly whinges about the<br />
harsh treatment meted out to him by the Labor Government. Last<br />
financial year our total payments to Queensland totalled $ 739<br />
million. Queensland received more than $ 382 per head of population<br />
in 1973-74 compared with $ 343 per head in average payments to all<br />
States. 6. Last year our grants for primary and secondary education<br />
were up 145 per cent on the year before. Tertiary education was<br />
up 165 per cent, technical education 110 per cent, welfare housing<br />
per cent, Aboriginal advancement nearly 30 per cent. Health<br />
and welfare, roads and urban and regional development in Queensland<br />
are all getting record amounts from my Government. We are doing<br />
more for local government than any previous~ government in Canberra.<br />
This year I approved grants totalling $ 56 million to local<br />
government councils throughout Australia. Queensland's share<br />
of these grants is $ 8.9 million. The Ipswich City Council is<br />
receiving $ 364,000 the largest grant for any local council in<br />
Queensland outside Brisbane itself.<br />
7. One area of particular soci * al relevance to Ipswich is the<br />
Austi lian Qovernment's decision to establish a community health<br />
Centre _ n Ipswich. In the last financial year we provided a<br />
total grc.. m of $ 78,719 to get the project off the ground. In<br />
the current financial year 1974-75 the total grant is to be<br />
$ 297,802 $ 258,577 for operating costs and a capital grant<br />
of $ 39,225. That's what you get when you are fortunate enough to<br />
have socially committed men like Bill Hayden and Doug Everingham<br />
z: cting in your best interests in the vital fields of health<br />
a1Ad welfare. You wouldn't get it from Mr Tooth. You didn't<br />
get it from Mr Tooth.<br />
8. 1 know the great hardship suffered by your district<br />
from the fleod disaster earlier this year. All Australia<br />
sympathised with you i. n that terrible experience. My Government<br />
gave prompt and generous assistance for flood relief. We<br />
immediately mobilised Civil Defence and Defence personnel and<br />
resources. Our payments to Queensland, totalling $ 66 million<br />
so far, are the biggest natural disaster outlay ever made by<br />
an Australian Government. Queensland's expenditure on flood<br />
relief from its own resources has amounted to $ 3.7 million.<br />
We created a natural disasters organisation to * absorb<br />
the existing Civil Defence arrangements and deal with the<br />
long-term relief of flood and bushfire devastation. </p>
<p>-3-<br />
9. We must heed the lessons of the Queensland flood<br />
disaster. Brisbane is a clear example of a city with inadequate<br />
land use, planning and control, especially with respect to flood<br />
plains. Since 1887 floods have occurred eight times in the<br />
lower catchment areas, and as the city and vulnerable surrounding<br />
districts grow, the risk increases. Despite the devastation<br />
in the past, Queensland governments did little to prevent or<br />
prepare for new emergencies. We can be ' sure that flooding<br />
rains will occur again. We must act now to modify their<br />
effects. In April I invited the Premier to submit a state-wide<br />
plan for flood mitigation measures to be considered for<br />
Australian Government assistance. The Premier supplied such<br />
a plan. We have undertaken to consider requests for assistance<br />
for any Queensland flood mitigation project as soon as we receive<br />
full information on the proposed work. We have been prevented<br />
from acting on requests for assistance because the Queensland<br />
Government has not provided the information we need.<br />
In July we asked the Queensland Premier to supply<br />
more detailed information on the projects he had submitted.<br />
We hoped to have a response by October. We are., still waiting.<br />
We have received no detailed proposal at all about the<br />
Bremmer River which is of most vital concern to the people<br />
of Ipswich. Although the Australian Government allocated $ 66 million<br />
for flood relief and restoration in Queensland it looks as though<br />
only about $ 57 million will be spent.<br />
My Government adheres to its goal of full employment.<br />
We are taking action on many fronts to safeguard workers' jobs.<br />
The increase in unemployment in Ipswich in recent months,<br />
pardcicularly in the textile industry, has given us gveat concern.<br />
Of 19k -enple in Ipswich out of work in the clothing and textile<br />
industr.. 160 are receiving structural adjustment assistance<br />
and a further 21 applications are being processed. We have acted<br />
to curb imports of certain finished knitted and woven goods<br />
from South East Asia. On 11 September a further referen~ ce was<br />
sent to the textile authority covering yarns, knitted fabrics and.<br />
towelling. The Government has received this report and is<br />
considering its recommendations. On 26 August the Industries<br />
*-ssistance Commission began public hearings to determine what<br />
widcr as~ istance is required for the clothing, industry.<br />
11. Only last Friday I sent a reference to * the Textiles<br />
Authoriiy' within th~ e Industries Assistance Commission covering<br />
a wide rancj of men' s, women' s, children's, and infant's clothing,<br />
as well as hosiery an~ d gloves.<br />
This action is being taken as a result of high and<br />
rising levels of imports and apparent total availability of such<br />
goods on the Australian market substantially in excess of<br />
previous levels.<br />
The reference seeks the advice of the. Textiles Authority<br />
on whether action should be taken to restrain imports either under<br />
the GATT textile arrangement or, if necessary to advise on any<br />
other measures considered desirable. / 14 </p>
<p>I have asked the Textiles Authority to repo---c-witkhin<br />
days in relation -to certain shirts and pyjamas, and . within.<br />
days -in respect of-the remainder.<br />
I take the opportunity now * to invite manufacturers and<br />
any other interested parties to start preparing submissiLoa_ to<br />
the Textile Authority without delay. The Authority will arrange<br />
to hold public hearings and details of these will shortly be<br />
announced. 12. We have taken many other measures to relieve unemployment.<br />
They are not just short-term palliative measures but far-sighted<br />
schemes to bring help to deprived regions and make our industries<br />
more efficient and resilient. On 23 September we announced a<br />
special scheme of grants to towns outside the main metropolitan<br />
areas, including subsidies to companies and grants to companies<br />
or local bodies for the establishment of viable alternative<br />
production and employment. Ipswich City Council has received<br />
$ 808,000 since the introduction in September of the" Regional<br />
Employment Development Scheme. This will provide new roadside<br />
retaining walls, concrete channelling and footpaths. We have<br />
approved 34 local projects to provide employment in Queensland<br />
under our REDS scheme.<br />
Another 15 have been given provisional approval pending<br />
further discussions with local government bodies. Besides<br />
providing employment, these schemes will bring permanent benefits<br />
to Queensland cities, towns and tourist resorts. In October we<br />
introduced the National Employment and Training System to<br />
develop and rationalise our manpower resources. Since the<br />
introduction of NEAT, 704 people in Queensland have undergone<br />
training and retraining in new jobs. A further 1600 Queensland<br />
applicants are-wai-ting to join the-scheme.'<br />
13. -Never once have we relaxed our efforts to solve our<br />
eco nomic problems problems we share with every comparable<br />
country. Prices in Queensland are rising faster than in any<br />
other State but Mr Bjelke-Petersen does nothing about it. He<br />
campaigned against our referendum seeking powers to deal with<br />
prices and refuses to use-the powers that the States alone possess.<br />
He refuses to co-operate with us in redu,. high electricity<br />
costs in Queensland. He refuses to let ANL ships operate between<br />
Queensland ports,* thus-keepinqg'up -the high cost of freights. He<br />
refuses to discuss our -offer-to take over the'State Railways<br />
and relieve Queensland of this constant and growing burder, on<br />
its budget thus keeping up the cost of railway freights and<br />
fares. 14. Contrast this negative and unco-operative attitude with<br />
the major economic decisions and initiatives I announced last<br />
Tuesday. In my statement to Parliament I said:<br />
' These measures add up to a very sub~ stantial relaxation<br />
of monetary policy. Financial conditions can be<br />
expected to become a good deal easier in the months<br />
ahead than they have been in the recent past. In the<br />
past week the Governor of the Reserve Bank has written<br />
to the banks requesting them to increase appreciably<br />
their rate of new lending and I would expect to see a<br />
prompt response by the banks some savings banks are<br />
already stepping up the rate of their housing loan<br />
approvals.' e7-7.. </p>
<p>We are increasing the real purchasing value of takehome<br />
pay by cutting income tax. These tax cuts are part of our<br />
plan for the reintroduction of cost of living adjustments for<br />
wage and salary earners. Wage indexation will ensure that the<br />
real wages of employees are protected in the years ahead. In<br />
the transition period the value of wages will be preserved by<br />
the tax cuts.<br />
16. In Queensland the only people whose wages have been<br />
subject to indexation so far are Members of Parliament.<br />
I ask Queenslanders to contrast our support of cost of living<br />
adjustments for all wage and salary earners with the outright<br />
opposition of the Liberal-Country Party to the applications<br />
for wage indexation now before the Arbitration Commission.<br />
This contrast between the Labor Party and the Liberal-Country<br />
parties will be clear for all to see when the Australian<br />
Government representative speaks in support of cost of living<br />
adjustments before the Arbitration Commission and the<br />
Queensland Government representative opposes them. </p>
