<p>Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister of Australia, the Leader</p>
<p> of the Opposition, and my Ministerial and Parliamentary colleagues,</p>
<p> and many honoured and distinguished guests. And I particularly acknowledge</p>
<p> the presence of Doug Anthony, the former Deputy Prime Minister of</p>
<p> Australia, and Tom Uren the former Deputy Leader of the Australian</p>
<p> Labor Party, and former Chairman of the Australian Vietnamese Friendship</p>
<p> Society.</p>
<p>Prime Minister, to you and to your wife, and to your Ministers, I</p>
<p> extend a very warm welcome on behalf of the Government, and the people</p>
<p> of Australia. Over the last 25 years, great strides have been made</p>
<p> in building a better and a closer relationship between our two countries.</p>
<p> It has not been easy but it has been done in a spirit of great good</p>
<p> will on both sides. And I believe that we can quite genuinely look</p>
<p> back on that period of time, assess the relationship, and recognise</p>
<p> that enormous progress has been made.</p>
<p>And as is always the case in good relationships between nations, it</p>
<p> is the people-to-people links that loom largest. And it will be not</p>
<p> lost on anybody in this gathering how important those people-to-people</p>
<p> links are. Nor will it be lost on any of us that Australia has within</p>
<p> its confines a wonderfully vibrant and positive community of Australians</p>
<p> of Vietnamese extraction, and Vietnamese birth and descent.</p>
<p>It numbers, according to different calculations somewhere between</p>
<p> 140,000 and 200,000. And it is indeed one of the largest non-English</p>
<p> speaking ethnic components of the Australian population, and it has</p>
<p> made a great contribution to our society. And it has produced some</p>
<p> wonderful contributors to the Australian scene. One of them is here</p>
<p> today of course, Tan Le, who is the young Australian of the Year last</p>
<p> year. And I know that Tan Le paid a very successful visit to your</p>
<p> country not long ago.</p>
<p>And perhaps many here will not know that only three months ago Nhan</p>
<p> Vo-Van, a Vietnamese born Australian, and a senior bureaucrat in my</p>
<p> department, became an Assistant Secretary in the Cabinet Secretariat</p>
<p> area and sits in on all of my Cabinet meetings, and is one of the</p>
<p> principal note takers of all of the deliberations of the Australian</p>
<p> government.</p>
<p>They are but two examples of many of people of Vietnamese descent</p>
<p> who have made a wonderful contribution to our nation. I'm also</p>
<p> delighted to have been told this morning that Australia, with 4000</p>
<p> Vietnamese students at its universities, is now the largest host country</p>
<p> of overseas Vietnamese students in the world. And given the antecedents,</p>
<p> and given previous associations of Vietnam with the former Soviet</p>
<p> Union, with France and so forth, that is a very significant development</p>
<p> and a very very significant indication of just how close our two countries</p>
<p> are.</p>
<p>Your country Prime Minister is embarking upon an era of economic reform.</p>
<p> It is not easy. We recognise that living standards remain, by those</p>
<p> of the industrialised world, still very low. We contribute through</p>
<p> our foreign aid program in a most constructive way. And the My Thuan</p>
<p> Bridge of course is the largest infrastructure project funded through</p>
<p> the aid budget ever undertaken by Australia. And I understand from</p>
<p> you Prime Minister that it will be ready for opening some time in</p>
<p> the middle of next year. And my Deputy Prime Minister is already,</p>
<p> in his inimitable style, promoting a joint Prime Ministerial presence</p>
<p> at that opening when it takes place. And I mean we might be able to</p>
<p> include the odd Deputy Prime Minister as well.</p>
<p>Last year was the first time that our two-way trade exceeded the $1</p>
<p> billion mark. And our exports to Vietnam grew by 60% to be $386 million</p>
<p> in 1998, and your exports to Australia grew by 30% in the same period.</p>
<p> Total Australian investment in Vietnam was worth about $1.3 billion,</p>
<p> representing the activities of more than 100 Australian companies</p>
<p> including Telstra, which has decided to make Hanoi its regional headquarters,</p>
<p> Fosters, and Southcorp. But we are eager to work more with Vietnam</p>
<p> in areas such as insurance, agribusiness, science and technology,</p>
<p> mining and resources, and in education and defence.</p>
<p>As you know Prime Minister, foreign direct investment and trade are</p>
<p> powerful contributors to sustainable growth and we must fully exploit</p>
<p> and facilitate these opportunities. Predictability and transparency</p>
<p> are fundamental in this area. We do want to note that we've also</p>
<p> started a modest co-operation programs in the area of defence.</p>
<p>Prime Minister, your country and Australia are of course fellow members</p>
<p> of APEC. And as I stressed to you in our talks this morning, we share</p>
<p> a common interest in the realisation of the ultimate APEC goals of</p>
<p> trade liberalisation, by the year 2010 in respect to developed countries,</p>
<p> and the year 2020 in respect of developing countries. And it is important</p>
<p> that the meeting which takes place in New Zealand this year that the</p>
<p> momentum towards those goals be maintained and increased.</p>
<p>The region in which both our countries are located has gone through</p>
<p> the worst economic adversity in four or five decades. Australia has</p>
<p> essentially been able to stare down that economic downturn and we</p>
<p> have been very keen, during that period, to contribute in a constructive</p>
<p> way as an active regional partner in helping countries in the region</p>
<p> which have been worst affected. And over and above the foreign aid</p>
<p> that we give in a direct form to many countries including Vietnam</p>
<p> we have been able to participate in the economic bailouts of Indonesia,</p>
<p> of Korea and Thailand.</p>
<p>I am hopeful, and my Government is hopeful, that the worst of the</p>
<p> economic downturn in Asia is behind us. But even on the most optimistic</p>
<p> scenario it will be a number of years before we can see a significant</p>
<p> resumption of economic growth in the countries that have been worst</p>
<p> affected.</p>
<p>During our discussion this morning, Prime Minister, you told me of</p>
<p> the economic reforms which had taken place over the last 10 years</p>
<p> in Vietnam. We agreed on the importance of transparency and clear</p>
<p> and open laws and rules of corporate governance. They are important</p>
<p> to the investment atmosphere. They are important to the capacity of</p>
<p> your country to attract large amounts of foreign investment which</p>
<p> are so very important to your future economic development. Your Ambassador</p>
<p> to Australia, Prime Minister, even informed me that your country has</p>
<p> recently introduced a goods and services tax which commenced operation</p>
<p> on the 1st of January this year.</p>
<p>But, Prime Minister, I want to say, in the spirit of the friendship</p>
<p> that is now characteristic of the relationship between our two countries,</p>
<p> how very welcome you and your party are to Australia. We have travelled</p>
<p> as very different societies with a history of difference and conflict.</p>
<p> We have travelled a very important but, I think, a very positive and</p>
<p> a very constructive road over the last 25 years.</p>
<p>We respect enormously the contribution of Australians of Vietnamese</p>
<p> descent to our society. We welcome the opportunity to work with your</p>
<p> country in APEC. We recognise that we have some differences and it</p>
<p> is always better to frankly state and recognise differences. In areas</p>
<p> such as human rights I've had the opportunity to convey some</p>
<p> of the concerns that are felt by Australia and by Australians. But</p>
<p> I've conveyed them in a spirit of respect and a spirit of understanding</p>
<p> that different societies can work together effectively, must accept</p>
<p> those differences and focus on the things that they have in common</p>
<p> and the things that they can achieve together.</p>
<p>There are 80 million people in your country. I think there are enormous</p>
<p> opportunities for growth and development. I find in my discussions</p>
<p> with Australian companies a continued interest in Vietnam and a desire,</p>
<p> all things being equal, to invest in that country and to share in</p>
<p> its economic development and its economic growth.</p>
<p>I am grateful, Prime Minister, that you and your wife and your colleagues</p>
<p> have seen fit to come here. I hope that the rest of your visit to</p>
<p> Australia is a very happy and successful and productive one. And I</p>
<p> can assure you that the representative character of the gathering</p>
<p> at today's lunch indicates the importance that Australians in</p>
<p> walks of life place on the relationship between our two societies.</p>
<p> I would now like to invite the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Kim Beazley,</p>
<p> to support my remarks.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
