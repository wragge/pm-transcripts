OPENING OF BUILDING CLENTRE<br />
NEWCASTLE, N. S. d. 1st September, 1967<br />
Speech by the Prime Minister, Mr. Holt<br />
Mr. Pinfold, President of' the Newcastle Master<br />
Builders' Association,<br />
YMy Lord M1, ayor,<br />
1-r . President of' the Senate,<br />
Parliamentary Colleagues, I see them around me, and<br />
Distinguished Guests,<br />
Ladies and Gentlemen,<br />
I feel it a very happy coincidence that my visit<br />
here for the opening of' your Festival should also have<br />
enabled me to join with you in this very significant function<br />
here this afternoon. It is typical of' the enterprise which<br />
has brought Niew. castle to the position of' being sixth largest<br />
urban area in Australia, only surpassed by five of the capital<br />
cities of the Commonwealth, that you've again demonstrated a<br />
sign of your enterprise in this fine building and the admirable<br />
community purpose that it will assist in serving.<br />
Home-building for Australia is, of course, one of'<br />
our most vital activities, not only be:-cause we are a homeloving<br />
people but there is no community in the world which<br />
can point to a higher percentage of home ownership than is<br />
to be found here in Australia. Seventy per cent of the<br />
dwelling units occupied in Australia are occupied by people<br />
who are either owners of them or are in process of acquiring<br />
them as they pay off what is due on them. And that puts us<br />
in the forefront of all the countries of the world in this<br />
connection.<br />

ascertained and we have a rather higher rate of population<br />
growth than most of the other industrialised communities of<br />
the world. Indeed, if the United Stateu or the United Kingdom<br />
were to be required to build houses on the scale that our<br />
population rate growth makes necessary, it would be found<br />
necessary in the United States to build another half million<br />
homes a year and in the United Kingdom another 180,000 homes<br />
a year. This will be an indication, I am sure, to us all that<br />
we do require a great proportion of our national resources,<br />
our manpower, our skills in order to carry out our home-building<br />
programme required by our growing population.<br />
Currently homes are being built at an annual rate<br />
of 115,000 homes. Jow it is not merely desirable that homes<br />
should be built, it is no less desirable that they should be<br />
built to serve those who occupy them with comfort and<br />
convenience in pleasant surroundings at economic cost and with<br />
good standards of materials and construction. This, of course,<br />
is where your own Home-Building Information Centre can make<br />
such an imp~ rtant contribution.<br />
I am sure that many citizens of this growing city<br />
of Newcastle, one of the most rapidly growing urban communities<br />
of the C." ommonwealth, will take value and assistance from the<br />
service which this Building Centre can provide. I hope that<br />
the achievements of the building industry already well<br />
exemplified in this city will be added to usefully by the<br />
service that this centre can provide. In the knowledge<br />
that it will bring an important amenity, an important </p>
<p>additional information service to the people of this city I<br />
congratulate you, Mr. President, and your colleagues on what<br />
you are doing in the way of a public-spirited contribution<br />
of this kind and I hope that for many years this information<br />
centre on building will serve the citizens of Newcastle, as<br />
indeed it serves the larger interest of the Australian nation.<br />
And so, Sir, it is with pleasure that I have accepted<br />
your invitation to be here formally to declare this building<br />
open and I hope that I shall successfully execute my formal<br />
undertaking of unveiling the plaque and of opening the door<br />
to the building, opening the door to the centre.<br />
I now formally declare the building centre of<br />
Newcastle, New South Wales, officially open and congratulate<br />
the Raster Builders' Association on its construction. </p>
