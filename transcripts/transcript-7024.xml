PRIME MINISTER<br />
EMBARGOED UN~ TIL DELIVERY CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY<br />
OPENING OF THE PERTH INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT TERMINAL COMPLEX<br />
PERTH 25 OCTOBER 1986<br />
Ladies and gentlemen,<br />
It gives oc great pleasure to be in western Australia again<br />
-the home, for some time to come I am sure, of a well-known<br />
trophy conin~ ioworating an earlier mode of international<br />
transport to open a facility serving a more modern, more<br />
accessible m'ode of international travel.<br />
Air trianrport itself has come a long way in the 25 years<br />
since the Dresent terminal was developed for the Empire<br />
Games, when the standard international aircraft waG the<br />
seat Locl?. heed Constellation.<br />
Today the typical international aircraft carries over 400<br />
passengers and Perth now handles three times as many<br />
passengerE as a decade ago.<br />
Western Australia's economic development and the immediate<br />
requiremconts generated by the defence of the America's Cup<br />
clearly called for an upgrading of facilities.<br />
The result is a total investment of $ 100 million and the<br />
most modern international airport facility in the country.<br />
Indeed, this airport has found admirers in China where<br />
interest has been shown in building a terminal in Guangzhou<br />
( Canton) closely based on this facility.<br />
The Comn~ r~ wealth has contributed some $ 75 million to the<br />
project: to the new terminal itself, to navigational aids<br />
and to -cefety equipment. A further $ 25 million has been<br />
invested by the aviation and aviation-related industries.<br />
The termi.. 5nal will end the congestion and delays of the old<br />
combined domestic/ international terminal. It includes the<br />
latest designs in baggage-handling, check-in security,<br />
energy-cfficiency and facilities for the disabled.<br />
The decor reflects the unique Western Australian<br />
environru2nt, highlighted by a mural donated by the State<br />

The airport ilso features this spectacular 70 metre high<br />
control to-er the highest in Australia. The tower<br />
symbolises our faith in Perth's future; it has been built<br />
so tall to ensure it remains functional as this<br />
international airport expands.<br />
Beginning in 1987,. the recently established Federal Airports<br />
Corporation will assume responsibility for the management of<br />
Australia's major airports, including this one.<br />
This bold co-.. mercial strategy is indicative of the<br />
Government'% concern to make Australia's publicly funded<br />
enterprises&gt; wore cost-effective, more competitive and more<br />
efficient. I welcome the Chairman of the FAC, Mr David Sullivan, and<br />
other corporation members to this ceremony. In this new<br />
Internationl Airport the Corporation will be taking over a<br />
vital, growing concern and manage it wisely for the benefit<br />
of all Australians.<br />
Airports are big business. The scale of investment we see<br />
around us here is proof of this.<br />
The management of airports by a largely independent body<br />
will be of nignificant advantage to the taxpayers who fund<br />
them, the travelling public and the aviation industry. The<br />
FAC will be able to act responsively in what is a dynamic<br />
market, and run these valuable public assets on a more<br />
commercial basis.<br />
Important as the FAC is, it is nevertheless only one element<br />
of the Government's overall strategy to improve the<br />
efficiency of the aviation industry and the levels of<br />
services to the consumer.<br />
This strategy includes the two reviews which have already<br />
been undertaken, the Bosch Inquiry into Aviation Cost<br />
Recovery and the Butcher/ Scully Review of International Air<br />
Freight. This Government has made substantial changes to<br />
Australian Airlines and Qantas to allow them to operate more<br />
commercially. We have been steadily improving Departmental<br />
efficiency. A review is also underway of the 1981 Two<br />
Airline Agreement.<br />
Most recently, we have taken an in-principle decision to<br />
establish a Civil Aviation Corporation to operate air<br />
traffic control, flight advisory services, navigational<br />
aids, comirunications systems, and rescue and firefighting<br />
services at airports.<br />
The opening of this airport terminal provides an improved<br />
gateway not only to a vibrant and exciting part of Australia<br />
but to the nation as a whole. At the commercial level the<br />
airport is well placed to cater for South-East Asian markets<br />
and will nc doubt foster their growth. </p>

isnew airport will ensure that a growing proportion of<br />
visitors first experience Australian hospitality, which Paul<br />
Vogan has made international by-word, in this " State of<br />
? xcitement.<br />
Western Australia is already an important and popular<br />
tourist destina. i. on for both Australian and international<br />
visitors, due to its diversity of attractions and excellent<br />
facilities.<br />
This new terminal facility will play a major role in<br />
welcoming visitors for the America's Cup.<br />
The Cup is a major international event. The Challenge will<br />
be one of the biggest sporting event in the world in 1987.<br />
The attention of the world will focus on Fremantle and on<br />
Australia. The spin-off from this exciting sports event are enormous.<br />
An independent study by the University of Western Australia<br />
has shown an ex~ pected benefit of around $ 600 million to the<br />
western Australian economy.<br />
Western Australia's potential as a base for corporate<br />
activity in the Asian and Indian ocean region will be on<br />
display. There will be a large number of business and<br />
professional ccnventions held during the Cup period.<br />
And there will be substantial flow-on benefits to the<br />
Australian economy, particularly in tourism.<br />
Which brings ine back to this facility, and the<br />
Commonwealth's interest shared, I know, by Brian Burke's<br />
Government in ensuring that expenditure on the defence of<br />
the Cup will be of continuing benefit after this, the first<br />
of many defences, is successfully concluded.<br />
These benefi. ts should not end with the Cup defence, but<br />
continue as a result of the investment, development and<br />
exposure of the opportunities this State and this nation can<br />
provide. Western Australia, the State of Excitement, is experiencing<br />
a new and exciting period of development with the eyes of<br />
the world upon it.<br />
The new Perth International Airport Terminal will ensure<br />
that the Commonwealth Government contributes, in a lasting<br />
way, at this challenging time. </p>
