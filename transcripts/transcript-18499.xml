The Prime Minister today thanked Bob Brown on his remarkable contribution to state and federal politics over the last three decades.</p>
<p>Throughout his time in elected office, Bob Brown has been a figure of integrity with a deep love for this country and its environment.</p>
<p>Bob has served in a number of roles throughout his political career including as the Member for Denison in the Tasmanian Parliament from 1983, as Federal Senator since 1996 and as parliamentary leader of the Australian Greens since 2005.</p>
<p>As a former director of the Tasmanian Wilderness Society, Bob's career has been driven by a passion for our environment, having famously led a protest against the construction of the Franklin Dam.</p>
<p>It was this passion that saw him lead his party through historic negotiations with the Government and Independents Tony Windsor, Rob Oakeshott and Andrew Wilkie, to ensure the passage of our Clean Energy Future Package.</p>
<p>Bob has also been an active voice on the rights of same sex couples, having bravely used his own experiences to campaign for change.</p>
<p>I wish him well for his life beyond politics.</p>
<p>I congratulate Christine Milne on her election as the Leader of the Australian Greens Party. </p>
