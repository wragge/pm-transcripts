MEETING WITH STEELWORKERS/ 7 2<br />
UNION DELEGATES NEWCASTLE<br />
This morning I met a delegation of Newcastle steelworker union representatives to discuss BI-P's<br />
announcement regarding the Newcastle steelworks.<br />
The delegation was led by Maurie Rudd, the Australian Workers Union Branch Secretary for<br />
Newcastle and Northern Regions.<br />
It was an opportunity for me to hear at first hand of the social and economic impact of BHP's<br />
announcement on the Hunter Region. I appreciated the forthrightness of the delegates in describing<br />
the effects on families and the local community generally.<br />
I have agreed to the suggestion by Maurie Rudd that a high level Prime Ministerial Taskforce be<br />
established consisting of local community representatives to advise the Federal Government on the<br />
implications of any closure for thle local community. The Taskforce will report directly to me and will<br />
provide the Federal Government with direct feedback from the community in a non-party political way<br />
on issues affecting the region. Further details of the composition of the Taskforce will be announced<br />
shortly. I told the delegation that I will be visiting the Newcastle steelworks site as part of my visit to the<br />
Hunter region in the near future.<br />
