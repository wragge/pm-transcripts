THE PRIVATE SECTOR AND THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT<br />
ADDRESS BY THE PRIME MINISTER, MR E. G. WHITLAM, M. P.,<br />
TO THE SYDNEY CHAMBER OF COMMERCE, WENTWORTH HOTEL, SYDNEY,<br />
FRIDAY, 28 FEBRUARY, 1975. 4<br />
IT IS MORE THAN SEVEN YEARS AGO SINCE I FIRST<br />
ADDRESSED, AS LEADER OF THE AUSTRALIAN LABOR PARTY, A<br />
MAJOR CHAMBER OF COMMERCE, NOT SYDNEY BUT MELBOURNE, IN<br />
OCTOBER 1968y .1 HAD THE REPORTS OF MY SPEECH LOOKED UPx<br />
SI FOUND THAT MY THEME ON THAT OCCASION WAS THE SAME AS I<br />
HAD PLANNED TO TAKE WITH YOU TODAY, I SAID THEN SEVEN<br />
YEARS AGO " THE PROGRAM OF REFORM AND DEVELOPMENT OF<br />
ANY FUTURE LABOR GOVERNMENT CANNOT BE FULFILLED WITHOUT<br />
PROSPERITY IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR."' AND I[ SAID<br />
S '; PRIVATE ENTERPRISE IN AUSTRALIA CANNOT PROSPER WITHOUT<br />
GOVERNMENT -INITIATIVES PARTICULARLY AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL, " x<br />
I MADE THOSE STATEMENTS SEVEN YEARS AGO AND I REPEAT THEM<br />
O TODAYX, I DON'T RECALL THESE STATEMENTS JUST TO PROVE A<br />
CONSISTENCY, I RECALL THEM BECAUSE IT'S TOO OFTEN IGNORED<br />
THAT THIS APPROACH, THIS RECOGNITION OF THE INTERDEPENDENCE<br />
OF OUR PROGRAM AND PRIVATE PROSPERITY, ISA FUNDAMENTAL<br />
PART OF THE PHILOSOPHY OF THE AUSTRALIAN LABOR PARTY IN OR<br />
OUT OF OFFICEk SEVERAL MINISTERS IN MY GOVERNMENT, IN<br />
PARTICULAR THE TREASURER AND I, HAVE IN RECENT WEEKS BEEN<br />
EMPHASISING THE NEED TO RAISE PROFITABILITY. IN THE PRIVATE<br />
SECTORx 1 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
IN SOME QUARTERS THIS HAS BEEN DEPICTED AS A REVERSE,<br />
IN OTHER QUARTERS AS A CONVERSION SOME MIGHT HOPE A<br />
DEATH-BED REPENTANCE, IT IS NOTHING OF THE SORT. IT<br />
EXPRESSES A VIEW I HAVE BEEN PUTTING, AS I HAVE JUST<br />
EVER SINCE I BECAME LEADER OF THE AUSTRALIAN LABOR<br />
PARTYx OUR CURRENT EMPHASIS ON PROFITABILITY REFLECTS<br />
A RESPONSE WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF A CONSISTENT PHILOSOPHY<br />
TO THE PARTICULAR NEED OF THE PARTICULAR TIME. WE HAVE<br />
NEVER LOST SIGHT OF THAT INTERDEPENDENCE, OF WHICH I<br />
HAVE JUST SPOKEN, JUST AS WE HAVE NEVER LOST SIGHT OF OUR<br />
GOALS FOR AUSTFALIAx As I* AM RECALLING PAST SPEECHES I<br />
CAN DONO BETTER THAN REFER TO THE FIRST MAJOR SPEECH I<br />
MADE AS PRIME MINISTER TO A REPRESENTATIVE CROSS SECTION<br />
OF AUSTRALIAN BUSINESS AT A METAL TRADES INDUSTRIES<br />
ASSOCIATION SEMINAR IN JUNE 1973x I SAID, ". THE ASSURANCE<br />
I GIVE YOU IS THAT WE FULLY RECOGNISE THE INTERDEPENDENCE<br />
OF A LABOR GOVERNMENT AND PRIVATE BUSINESS. I ACKNOWLEDGED<br />
IN MY POLI. CY SPEECH THAT WE COULD NOT EXPECT THAT OU. R<br />
SOCIAL PROGRAM COULD BE FINANCED WITHOUT A SIGNIFICANTLY A<br />
INCREASED GROWTH RATEx AUSTRALIA HAD BEEN STUMBLING<br />
ALONG WITH A PALTRY GROWTH RATE OF 3 PER CENT OR SO. I<br />
SAID THEN THAT WE WOULD NEED TO ACHIEVE A GROWTH RATE OF<br />
6 TO 7 P'ER CENT IF OUR PROGRAM WA8. TO BE IMPLEMENTED<br />
WITHOUT VASTLY INCREASED TAXATION.* WE SHALL PROBABLY<br />
ACHIEVE A RATE HIGHER THAN 7 PER CENT THIS YEAR,, WE CAN<br />
ONLY ACHIEVE SUCH A RATE IF ALL SECTORS OF THE COMMUNITY,<br />
NOT LEAST THE PRIVATE SECTOR, IS PROSPEROUS, EFFICIENT<br />
AND FULLY EMPLOYEDx -I 4 </p>
<p>-3-<br />
" You NEED A PROSPEROUS ECONOMYw So DO Ix. I KNOW VERY<br />
WELL I CANNOT ACHIEVE A MOIETY OF WHAT I WANT TO ACHIEVE<br />
FOR THE PEOPLE OF THIS COUNTRY DECENT SCHOOLS, DECENT<br />
HOSPITALS, DECENT CITIES, DECENT PROVISION FOR THE SICK*<br />
THE AGED AND THE HANDICAPPED WITHOUT YOUR PROSPERITY"<br />
YOU MIGHT SAY THAT OUR PRESENT EMPHASIS ON THE<br />
PRIVATE SECTOR AND OUR PRESENT PREOCCUPATION WITH THE<br />
PROBLEMS OF THE PRIVATE SECTOR REPRESENT A PROFOUND CHANGE<br />
OF PHILOSOPHYx I THINK I. AM ENTITLED TO SAY THAT IT<br />
DOES NOT, BUT THAT IT DOES REPRESENT AN INTELLIQENT CHANGE<br />
OF EMPHASIS IN A RAPIDLY CHANGING SITUATIONI IT WOULD BE<br />
INTOLERABLE IF IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES PREVAILING THROUGHOUT<br />
THE WORLD TODAY, GOVERNMENTS WERE TO BE ACCUSED OF<br />
ERRATIC CONDUCT, OF RECKLESS CHOP-AND-CHANGE BECAUSE THEY<br />
TAKE NEW INITIATIVES OR ABANDON POLICIES APPROPRIATE TO<br />
OTHER CONDITIONS. IT WOULD BE INTOLERABLE IF GOVERNMENTS<br />
WERE TO BE'SCARED OFF FROM MAKING CHANGES BY SUCH<br />
ACCUSATIONSx THE FACT IS THAT CHANGE IS OCCURRING WITH<br />
A GREATER SPEED THAN EVER BEFORE, AND ALL GOVERNMENTS<br />
HAVE TO MAKE CHANGES WITH GREATER SPEED AND FREQUENCY THAN<br />
EVER BEFOREx IT APPEARS THAT THERE HAS BEEN A PROFOUND<br />
ALTERATION IN THE NATURE OF THE BUSINESS CYCLE, NOT ONLY<br />
IN AUSTRALIA. BUT THROUGHOUT THE WORLDx NOT SO LONG AGO<br />
IT TOOK THE BUSINESS CYCLE ABOUT FIVE OR SEVEN YEARS TO<br />
OCCUR IN ALL COMPARABLE COUNTRIES, -NOW THE FULL CYCLE<br />
TAKES A COUPLE OF YEARSx 4* </p>
<p>ACCORDINGLY, THE DECISION-MAKING PROCESS FOR GOVERNMENTS<br />
AND FOR BUSINESS ALIKE IS SUBJECT TO QUITE EXTRAORDINARY<br />
AND UNPRECEDENTED STRAINS) NONE OF US IN OUR LIFE-TIMES<br />
HAVE-EVER BEFORE FACED THIS CONTINUING NEED FOR<br />
RE-ADJUSTMENT OF POLICIES AND PLANS FOR WHICH THE NEW<br />
PHENOMENON OF A TWO YEAR BUSINESS CYCLE IMPOSES ON ALL OF<br />
US, WE'VE ALL BEEN CALLED UPON TO* CHANGE THE DIRECTION OF<br />
POLICIES AND PLANS MORE FULLY AND FREQUENTLY THAN EVER<br />
BEFOREx IT IS EASY ENOUGH TO BLAME GOVERNMENTS FOR* THIS<br />
CHANGE AND IT IS EASY ENOUGH, I SUPPOSE, FOR PEOPLE IN<br />
GOVERNMENT TO BLAME THE PRIVATE SECTORx I THINK, HOWEVER,<br />
IT IS TIME. WE ALL ROSE ABOVE A DEBATE WHICH MERELY SEEKS<br />
TO ALLOCATE BLAMEx THERE IS VERY OFTEN A'NEED' ON BOTH<br />
SIDES FOR PLAIN SPEAKING
UNPALATABLE FACTSx FOR EXAMPLE, IT GIVES ME NO<br />
PARTICULAR PLEASURE TO GO TO A LABOR PARTY CONFERENCE AND<br />
POINT OUT THE PRESENT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN WAGE INCREASES<br />
AND INFLATION AND UNEMPLOYMENTx BUT A STATEMENT OF PLAIN<br />
FACT SHOULD NOT BE DESCRIBED AS UNION BASHING JUST AS WHEN<br />
I STATE FACTSWHICH MAY BE UNPALATABLE TO YOU, I DON'T<br />
EXPECT TO BE ACCUSED OF BUSINESS BASHINGA IN RECENT<br />
MONTHS WE HAVE LAID THE FOUNDATIONS, AS A GOVERNMENT, FOR<br />
A NEW DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SECTORS.<br />
WE WANT TO BUILD ONTHESE FOUNDATIONS TO ESTABLISH HEALTHY<br />
COMMUNICATION TO USE THE DIPLOMATIC CLICHE FULL AND<br />
FRANK EXCHANGE" x 8 </p>
<p>IT IS POSSIBLY TRUE THAT IN THE PAST THE GOVERNMENT<br />
HAS OVER-ESTIMATED THE FLEXIBILITY OF INDUSTRY TO<br />
-ADJUST TO CHANGEA IT IS PROBABLY EQUALLY TRUE THAT<br />
THE PJRIVATE SECTOR HAS UNDER-ESTIMATED THE GOVERNMENT'S<br />
OWN FLEXIBILITY. WE SHOULD ALL TRY TO UNDERSTAND TE FORCES<br />
WHICH MAKE FOR UNCERTAINTY IN THIS NEW ERA OF CHANGE IN<br />
WHICH WE LIVE, THE FIRST FACTOR IS THE EXTRAORDINARY<br />
INFLATIONARY FORCES PREVAILING THROUGHOUT THE WESTERN<br />
WORLD IN RECENT YEARS FORCES WELL UNDER WAY BEFORE.<br />
THE OIL CRISISA THERE HAVE BEEN QUITE FUNDAMENTAL<br />
CHANGES IN SOCIAL ATTITUDES., CHANGES IN PEOPLE'S<br />
EXPECTATIONS, CHANGES IN PEOPLE S PATIENCE IN ACHIEVING<br />
THEIR EXPECTATIONSx THERE HAVE ALSO BEEN CHANGES IN<br />
BASIC INDUSTRIAL ATTITUDES, THINGS LIKE THE GROWTH OF<br />
SHOP-FLOOR MILITANCY AND A tHALLENGE TO TRADITIONAL<br />
CONCEPTS OF UNION LEADERSHIP.
THE UNCERTAINTY OF THE TIMES IT SHOULD-ALSO REFLECT<br />
THAT GOVERNMENT DECISION-MAKING IS SUBJECT TO THE SAME<br />
PRESSURES, THE SAME UNCERTAINTIESx IT'S POINTLESS TO<br />
BLAME GOVERNMENTS FOR THOSE UNCERTAINTIES WITH WHICH<br />
GOVERNMENTS THEMSELVES HAVE TO GRAPPLE JUST AS'MUCH AS<br />
BUSINESS)( </p>
<p>-6-<br />
I HAVE BEEN AT SOME PAINS TO TRY TO UNDERSTAND<br />
CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH MAY HAVE GIVEN RISE TO SOME<br />
MISUNDERSTANDING BETWEEN BUSINESS AND GOVERNMENT IN THE<br />
PAST'FEW YEARSK PERHAPS THE FIRST FACTOR WAS THE MERE<br />
FACT THAT WE HAD BEEN OUT FOR 23 YEARSK THERE WERE FEW<br />
BUSINESSMEN WHO HAD ANY EXPERIENCE OF LABOR I'N GOVERNMENT<br />
AND THERE WERE NOT MANY WELL ESTABLISHED LINES OF<br />
COMMUNICATION BETWEEN BUSINESS AND THE LABOR PARTYX<br />
UNDOUBTEDLY THERE WERE UNFOUNDED PRECONCEPTIONS AND<br />
PREJUDICES ON BOTH SIDESK<br />
WITH THIS BACKGROUND IT IS PERHAPS NOT SURPRISING<br />
THAT COMMUNICATION WAS OFTEN INEFFECTIVEA ANOTHER FACTOR<br />
WAS THE ENTHUSIASM AND THE SENSE OF MISSION OF THE NEW<br />
GOVERNMENTX IT MAY BE THAT BUSINESS WAS SURPRISED THAT<br />
WE MEANT WHAT WE HAD SAID4 THE BROAD RANGE OF POLICY<br />
INITIATIVES . AND CHANGES WHICH WE INITIATED AT FIRST<br />
EXHILARATED MOST PEOPLE, IF ONLY BY INVIDIOUS COMPARISON 4<br />
WITH THE STAGNATION OF PREVIOUS YEARS CONTINUATION OF<br />
THESE INITIATIVES AND CHANGES BECAME DIFFICULT TO ABSORBA<br />
I CONCEDE THAT IT BECAME DIFFICULT TO KEEP UP WITH THE\.<br />
SCOPE AND PURPOSE OF OUR POLICIES.' S, ,7/ S </p>
<p>-7-<br />
THE SCOPE AND SPEED OF THE GOVERNMENT'S<br />
DECISIONS HAVE MADE IT DIFFICULT FOR PEOPLE TO ACQUIRE<br />
A DEFINITE PERSPECTIVE OF THEGOVERNMENT'S OVERALL<br />
PROGRAM AND INTENTIONSx IN THIS CONTEXT IT WAS EASY FOR<br />
PEOPLE TO GENERALISE A VERY SPECIFIC GRIEVANCE OR REACT<br />
ON THE BASIS OF TRADITIONAL PREJUDICES ABOUT THE<br />
AUSTRALIAN LABOR PARTYx I HAVE OFTEN DETECTED A VIEW<br />
AMONGST THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY THAT LABOR PARTY POLICY<br />
HAD CONSPIRATORIAL OVERTONESK SOME HAVE BELIEVED THAT<br />
WHILST PUBLIC STATEMENTS OF LABOR SPOKESMEN HAVE BEEN<br />
EMINENTLY RESPONSIBLE, SOMEHOW LURKING IN THE MINDS OF<br />
MEMBERS OF THE PARTY WAS A SECRET DESIRE TO CONTROL<br />
EVERYTHING BY OUTRIGHT NATIONALISATION OR BY STEALTHx IT<br />
IS PERTINENT TO NOTE THAT DURING THE PERIOD OF THE LABOR<br />
GOVERNMENT THERE HAS BEEN NO INITIATIVE TO NATIONALISE<br />
ANY INDUSTRYx THERE WILL NOT BE. WE HAVE TAKEN STEPS<br />
TO PROVIDE PUBLIC SECTOR COMPETITION IN AREAS HITHERTO<br />
EXCLUSIVELY PROVIDED FROM THE PRIVATE SECTORx ' 4.<br />
FOR AS LONG AS I HAVE BEEN A MEMBER OF THE<br />
AUSTRALIAN LABOR PARTY, IT HAS BEEN COMMITTED TO THE<br />
CONTINUATION OF A MIXED ECONOMYx CLEARLY WE WANT<br />
GREATER PUBLIC INITIATIVES THAN OUR OPPONENTSx BUT THE<br />
CONTINUANCE OF THE'MIXED ECONOMY HAS NOT BEEN SERIOUSLY<br />
QUESTIONED FOR MANY YEARSx IT IS TRUE THAT THE ROLE OF<br />
PROFITS HAS NOT BEEN PART OF OUR. RHETORIC BUT WE HAVE<br />
ALWAYS ACCEPTED, AS WE MUST, THE ROLE OF THE PROFIT<br />
MOTIVE IN A MIXED ECONOMYx 8/. </p>
<p>-8-<br />
AT THE RECENT TERRIGAL CONFERENCE, THIS WAS EXPLICITLY<br />
ACKNOWLEDGED FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THE LABOR PARTY<br />
PLATFORM HOWEVER, THE VERY REAL COMMITMENT OF THE<br />
AUSTRALIAN LABOR PARTY TO A MIXED ECONOMY IS OF MUCH<br />
LONGER STANDING THAN THATv<br />
MOST OF OUR MAJOR DECISIONS FALL WITHIN THE CONTEXT<br />
-OF TWO BROAD POLICY OBJECTIVES OBJECTIVES WHICH HAVE<br />
CHARACTERISED THE LABOR PARTY SINCE IT WAS ESTABLISHED AND<br />
WHICH DISTINGUISH THE LABOR PARTY FROM ITS OPPONENTSX<br />
THESE OBJECTIVES ARE: THE EXTENSION OF THE PUBLIC SECTOR<br />
AND THE RE-DISTRIBUTION OF INCOMES TO PROMOTE PUBLIC<br />
QUALITY AND PRIVATE EQUALIiY$ OF COURSE SUCH OBJECTIVES<br />
ARE SUBJECT TO THE CONSTRAINTS OF THE GROWTH OF THE ECONOMY<br />
AND THEY CAN ONLY BE ACHIEVED GRADUALLY IN A MIXED ECONOMYK<br />
WE HAVE NO INTENTION TO ACHIEVE EITHER OF THESE AT THE<br />
EXPENSE OF THE PRIVATE SECTOR WHICH PROVIDES SO IMPORTANT A<br />
DYNAMIC IN OUR ECONOMYx<br />
I FOUND WITH SOME SURPRISE, THAT ONE COMMENT IN<br />
THE TREASURER'S 1974 BUDGET SPEECH WAS SO WIDELY MISINTERPRETED)<br />
HE SAID THEN " THE RELATIVELY SUBDUED CONDITIONS UNDER<br />
PROSPECT IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR PROVIDE THE FIRST REAL<br />
OPPORTUNITY WE HAVEHAD TO TRANSFER RESOURCES TO THE PUBLIC<br />
SECTOR." 1. 19/,. </p>
<p>-9-<br />
THIS WAS INTERPRETED BY SOME AS A THREAT TO<br />
THE PRIVATE SECTORx IT WAS NOT INTERPRETED IN THE<br />
LIGHT OF A CLEAR OBJECTIVE, WHICH I HAVE MENTIONED ABOVE,<br />
TO EXPAND THE PUBLIC SECTORv<br />
THE GOVERNMENT'S COMMITMENTS IN SUCH AREAS AS<br />
EDUCATION, HEALTH, AND WELFARE CLEARLY IMPLIED THIS<br />
AND SHOULD HAVE COME AS A SURPRISE TO NO-ONEA YET IN.<br />
THE FINANCIAL YEAR 1973/ 74, THE PROPORTION OF GROSS<br />
DOMESTIC PRODUCT EXPENDED IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR<br />
ACTUALLY FELL FROM 32.3 PER CENT TO 31.6 PER CENT,, THIS<br />
OCCURRED DESPITE THE EFFORTS OF THE GOVERNMENT TO LAUNCH<br />
ITS NEW PROGRAMSx WE WERE FRUSTRATED BY-THE QUITE<br />
EXTRAORDINARY SHORTAGES PREVALENT IN THE ECONOMY DURING<br />
THAT PERIQDx To QUOTE ONLY ONE EXAMPLE -OUR OBJECTIVE<br />
TO PROVIDE BETTER HOUSING FOR LESS WELL OFF SECTIONS OF<br />
THE COMMUNITY WAS FRUSTRATED BY SHORTAGES OF MATERIAL AND<br />
LABOUR IN THE HOUSING SECTORX' THE " SUBDUEDCONDITIbN"<br />
TO WHICH THE THEN TREASURER MADE REFERENCE WAS NOT A<br />
THREAT TO THE PRIVATE SECTOR SO MUCH AS A RECOGNITION<br />
THAT THE EXCESS DEMAND WHICH HAD EXISTED UNTIL THEN WOULD<br />
DISAPPEAR </p>
<p>WE DID NOT PREDICT AT THAT TIME THE QUITE<br />
EXCESSIVE AND RAPID DOWNTURN IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR THAT<br />
HAS OCCURRED THE BUDGET WAS CRITICISED AT THE TIME<br />
AS BEING TOO EXPANSIONARYw IN RETROSPECT WE CAN SEE<br />
THAT IT WAS NOT EXPANSIONARY ENOUGHX THIS DEFECT WAS<br />
CORRECTED BY THE MEASURES ANNOUNCED ON 12 NOVEMBER<br />
WE RECOGNISE THAT THE PRIVATE SECTOR IS THE PRINCIPAL<br />
AVENUE OF EMPLOYMENT IN THIS COUNTRY AND OUR DECISIONS<br />
SINCE THE PRESENT POSITION EMERGED., HAVE CLEARLY INDICATED<br />
THAT THE REVIVAL OF THE PRIVATE SECTOR IS ESSENTIAL FOR<br />
O THE RESTORATION OF FULL EMPLOYMENT,<br />
STo THIS END, WE HAVE TAKEN A NUMBER OF MEASURES<br />
WHICH HAVE FOUR BROAD OBJECTIVESx FIRST, WE HAVE<br />
SUBSTANTIALLY EXPANDED THE AVAILABILITY OF MONEY FOR THE<br />
PRIVATE SECTOR. SECONDLY, WE ARE LIFTING CONSUMER DEMAND<br />
THROUGH A SUBSTANTIAL REDUCTION IN PERSONAL INCOME TAX,<br />
THIRDLY, WE ARE SEEKING TO ATTACK INFLATION BY REDUCING<br />
S THE PRESSURE FOR WAGE INCREASES THROUGH A SUBSTANTIAL<br />
IMPROVEMENT IN AFTER-TAX TAKE-HOME PAYx FINALLY, WE HAVI<br />
SOUGHT TO ENHANCE PROFITABILITY BY A REDUCTION IN COMPANY<br />
TAX, BY REQUESTING THE PRICES JUSTIFICATION TRIBUNAL TO GIVE<br />
PARTICULAR CONSIDERATION TO THE ADEQUACY OF RETURNNON CAPITAL<br />
AND BY URGENTLY INVESTIGATING THE IMPLICATIONS OF RAPID<br />
INFLATION. FOR THE TAXATION OF COMPANIES/ THE REPORT OF THE<br />
MATHEWS COMMITTEE IS EXPECTED SOON AND ACTION ON ITS<br />
RECOMMENDATIONS WILL BE PROMPT/ . WE RECOGNISE THE EXTRAORDINARY<br />
IMPACT OF RAPID INFLATION ON CORPORATE TAX RULES, PARTICULARLY<br />
WITH RESPECT TO STOCK VALUATION AND DEPRECIATIONX 1I II I I " I 1l </p>
<p>-11-<br />
I REFERRED TO THE CONDITIONS OF UNCERTAINTY<br />
WITHIN WHICH BOTH GOVERNMENTS AND BUSINESS HERE AND<br />
SAROUND THE WORLD ARE CURRENTLY FORCED TO OPERATEx<br />
IN AUSTRALIA IT MUST BE SAID THAT THERE IS A SPECIAL<br />
FACTOR OF UNCERTAINTYe THAT IS THE POLITICAL UNCERTAINTY<br />
CREATED BY THE CONTINUING THREAT OF A NEW ELECTIONS WE<br />
ARE CONFRONTED WITH A SITUATION BY-WHICH AUSTRALIA COULD<br />
HAVE NATIONAL ELECTIONS EVERY SIX MONTHSy THIS IS BAD<br />
FOR GOVERNMENT AND IT IS BAD FOR BUSINESSw WHAT<br />
BUSINESSMAN AMONG YOU COULD PLAN ON THE BASIS OF THE NEXT<br />
9 .4<br />
SIX MONTHS ONLY? WHAT BUSINESS COULD OPERATE UNDER THE<br />
THREAT OF-A TOTAL CHANGE IN MANAGEMENT EVERY-SIX MONTHS?<br />
IT IS NOT ONLY THAT THIS THREAT, THIS HARRASSMENT, THIS<br />
WAR OF NERVES, MAKES THE BUSINESS OF GOVERNMENT DOUBLY<br />
DIFFICULT; IT IS NOT JUST THE DIFFICULTY THE THREAT ADDS<br />
TO EFFECTIVE PLANNINGx THE ELECTION PROCESS ITSELF<br />
REQUIRES A SUSPENSION OF THE NORMAL BUSINESS, OF THE<br />
NORMAL ADMINSITRATION OF GOVERNMENTw DECISIONS WHICH " 4<br />
SHOULD BE TAKEN ARE NOT TAKEN
IS NOT DONEx. THEWHOLE MACHINERY OF GOVERNMENT AT BOTH.<br />
THE POLITICAL AND THE OFFICIAL LEVEL HALTS IN KEY AREAS<br />
AND SLOWS DOWN; IN ALL AREASx<br />
THIS INTERRUPTION CAN BE THE MORE DAMAGING WHEN<br />
AN ELECTION COMES OUT OF THE NORMAL TIME AND IT IS DOUBLY<br />
DAMAGING IN THESE TIMES OF VERY RAPID CHANGE WHEN<br />
GOVERNMENTS MUST ADAPT AND REACT TO THAT CHANGE WITH SPEED<br />
AND VIGOURx </p>
<p>-12-<br />
THE FACT IS THAT THE MAY ELECTIONS MEANT A VIRTUAL SUSPENSION<br />
OF NORMAL GOVERNMENT FOR NEARLY THREE MONTHS; AND THOSE<br />
MONTHS OF APRiL-MAY-JUNE WERE OBVIOUSLY CRITICAL IN TERMS OF<br />
ECONOMIC POLICY-MAKINGx AS A MATTER OF PROPRIETY I<br />
INSTRUCTED MY MINISTERS TO MAKE NO MAJOR DECISION UNTIL THE<br />
PEOPLE HAD MADE THEIR DECISION, AND MADE IT CLEAR THAT OUR<br />
DECISIONS WOULD NOT COMPROMISE OR I'NHIBIT AN* INCOMING<br />
" GOVERNMENTx o..<br />
EVEN WHEN THE ELECTION RESULTS WERE CLEAR AND<br />
ee<br />
BELIEVE THAT THE TEN DAYS OF UNCERTAINTY WHICH FOLLOWED<br />
POLLING DAY, NOT BECAUSE OF ANY REAL DOUBT ABOUT THE<br />
MEANING OF THE PEOPLE S DECISION, BUT BECAUSE OF THE VAGARIES<br />
AND COMPLEXITIES OF OUR ELECTORAL SYSTEM, WERE THOROUGHLY<br />
DAMAGING TO AUSTRALIA AT HOME AND ABROAD THERE WAS THE<br />
FURTHER INTERRUPTION OF THE JOINT SITTING, IT WAS A<br />
TOTALLY UNNECESSARY INTERRUPTION IN THAT THE OUTCOME OF THE<br />
JOINT SITTING WAS A FOREGONE CONCLUSIONx I DO HOPE THAT<br />
THE DAMAGE DONE, THE UNCERTAINTY CREATED BY THIS THREATENED<br />
DISRUPTION OF OUR NORMAL AND ACCEPTED AND TESTED<br />
CONSTITUTIONAL PROCESSES AND CONVENTIONS IS THOROUGHLY<br />
UNDERSTOOD BY ALL AUSTRALIANSX THE DEMOCRATIC SYSTEM IS<br />
EVERYWHERE UNDER CHALLENGE AND GREAT STRESSA IT'S NO<br />
COINCIDENCE THAT THE CAPITALIST SYSTEM IS EQUALLY AND<br />
EVERYWHERE UNDER CHALLENGE AND GREAT STRESS), ,13/, </p>
<p>.: t SYou MIGHT PONDER HOW LONG OUR DEMOCRACY CAN PREVAIL<br />
UNDER THESE REPEATED ASSAULTS, ASSAULTS WHICH, AS<br />
SIR. ROBERT MENZIES HAS SAID, " WILL MAKE POPULAR,<br />
DEMOCRACY UNWORKABLE" x AND YOU MIGHT PONDER HOW LONG<br />
CAPITALISM CAN SURVIVE IF POPULAR DEMOCRACY DOES NOT I<br />
SURVIVEx I VENTURE TO SUGGEST THAT THE VACUES YOU<br />
UPHOLD WILL NOT GO UNCHALLENGED IF THOSE WHO SEEK CHANGE<br />
THROUGH THE PARLIAMENTARY SYSTEM LOSE FAITH IN THE<br />
CAPACITY OF THAT SYSTEM TO PROVIDE PEACEFUL CHANGE<br />
