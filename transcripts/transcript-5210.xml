MINISTERIAL CHANGES<br />
I have today recommended to His Excellency the Governor-General<br />
changes in the Ministry consequent upon expanding activity in<br />
the energy field and consequent also upon other ministerial<br />
vacancies. His Excellency has indicated that he will swear<br />
Ministers affected by the changes at Government House at 10.00 a. m.<br />
tomorrow. Senator Webster, Minister for Science and the Environment, has<br />
indicated an interest in serving in another capacity outside the<br />
Parliament. The Government proposes to appoint Senator Webster<br />
as High Commissioner to New Zealand. The Government attaches<br />
great importance to the closest contact between the two<br />
administrations, and Senator Webster's understanding of the<br />
innermost processes of Government will add to the significance<br />
of our representation in New Zealand.<br />
Senator Webster has served in the Government with distinction,<br />
and as Minister for Science and the Environment has presided over<br />
the successful amalgamation of those portfolio interests, the<br />
restructuring of CSIRO and the Bureau of Meteorology, and<br />
development of Australia's activity in Antarctic affairs.<br />
Coincidentally there has been a steady growth in Australia/ New<br />
Zealand co-operation in the scientific field, a development<br />
with which Senator Webster is closely identified. I am sure<br />
Australia will be well served by Senator Webster's continuing<br />
contribution in this new field.<br />
Because of the growing importance of energy policy, and its<br />
inter-relationship with other major areas of Government activity,<br />
I have decided that it will be more workable in the period ahead<br />
to make this area the responsibility of a senior Minister in the<br />
Cabinet. There is a close affinity between energy matters and<br />
a number of other portfolio interests. The need for the closest<br />
co-ordination with State Governments in the development of truly<br />
national energy policies also requires that a senior Cabinet<br />
Minister work in this area.<br />
Availability and pricing of energy are fundamental to the effective<br />
functioning of our economy, and indeed the world economy. The<br />
development of our energy resources, in partnership with State<br />
Governments and industry, interacts substantially for example / 2 </p>
<p>2.<br />
with private sector investment, growth of industry and<br />
employment, trade policy, transport policy and foreign policy.<br />
There is a need to strengthen our industrial base and encourage<br />
to a greater extent the processing of minerals in Australia.<br />
Australia is partly dependent on imported crude oil, but with<br />
prudent and imaginative policies our abundance of other energy<br />
reserves should be a growing source of prosperity in the years<br />
ahead. I have recommended to the Governor-General that he appoint<br />
Senator Carrick as Minister for the renamed portfolio of National<br />
Development and Energy.<br />
Senator Carrick will be giving priority to a number of major<br />
issues in the period inmediately ahead including encouragement<br />
of energy related projects approved by the Loan Council today and<br />
further initiatives to expand coal fired electricity generation.<br />
Other issues include the scope for encouraging greater use of<br />
readily available electricity, natural gas, liquid petroleum<br />
gas and coal; conservation; exploration; and alternative<br />
technologies such as coal liquefaction, methanol from gas,<br />
ethanol from vegetable products and shale oil.<br />
Work has been proceeding on these and other issues under the<br />
guidance of Mr Newman, and I record here with gratitude the<br />
contribution he has made in developing a national energy policy<br />
over the past two years.<br />
Mr Newman will be the new Minister for Productivity. He will also<br />
be Minister Assisting the Prime Minister in Federal Affairs, and<br />
in that capacity will continue to have a co-ordinating role in<br />
the follow-up of the Callaghan Report.<br />
Mr Nixon, as an interim measure, has been carrying the portfolio<br />
of Primary Industry as well as being Minister for Transport. As<br />
from tomorrow, Mr Nixon will continue as Minister for Primary<br />
Industry but will relinquish the Transport portfolio.<br />
In line with my view that Ministers should be given an opportunity<br />
to become familiar with the wider area of government administration,<br />
I have decided upon other Ministerial changes.<br />
Mr Hunt will be the new Minister for Transport and will be a<br />
member of the Cabinet. I have also recommended to the Governor-<br />
General that Mr MacKellar be appointed Minister for Health,<br />
Mr Macphee, Minister for Immigration, Mr Fife, Minister for<br />
Education, and Mr Garland, Minister for Business and Consumer<br />
Affairs. Two new Ministers will be appointed to the Ministry to take up<br />
the vacant places. I have recommended that Senator Scott be<br />
appointed Minister for Special Trade Representations and<br />
Mr David Thomson, MC, be appointed Minister for Science and the<br />
Environment. / 3 </p>
<p>Consequent upon these Ministerial changes, there will be changes<br />
in appointments as Minister Assisting. Mr MacKellar will be<br />
Minister Assisting the Prime Minister; Senator Scott, Minister<br />
Assisting the Minister for Trade and Resources; Senator Chancy,<br />
Minister Assisting the Minister for National Development and<br />
Energy; Mr Garland, Minister Assisting the Minister for Industry<br />
and Commerce; Mr Macphee, Minister Assisting the Treasurer; and<br />
as indicated above, Mr Newman will be Minister Assisting the Prime<br />
Minister in Federal Affairs.<br />
Appointments as Minister Assisting will also take effect from<br />
tomorrow. Other than the change in title for the new Department<br />
of National Development and Energy, there are no consequent<br />
departmental changes; and no increase in the number of<br />
Departments or the number of Ministers.<br />
There is full opportunity for Ministers not in the Cabinet to<br />
attend Cabinet discussions at any time their portfolio interests<br />
are affected. There is no significance therefore in the order<br />
in which portfolios as such are listed. Ministers are sworn in<br />
order of Ministerial seniority and listed accordingly. The full<br />
Ministry list is attached.<br />
