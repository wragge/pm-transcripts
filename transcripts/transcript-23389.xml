    <content><![CDATA[<p>Team, it’s great to be here in Perth.</p>
<p>This is obviously an important week for us because it’s the week where we have the West Australian Senate by-election.</p>
<p>It’s good to be in Perth because this is a Government which is doing the right thing by the people of Western Australia. We’ve got record roads funding, we’ve got record school funding and of course every day we are working to repeal the mining tax and the carbon tax which are anti-Western Australian taxes, and every day we are working to repeal these anti-Western Australian taxes, the Labor Party is trying to keep them there.</p>
<p>They say one thing in Perth but they do the opposite in Canberra.</p>
<p>In Perth, they say they’re scrapping the carbon tax. In Canberra, they vote to keep it.</p>
<p>So, we are the people who are being fair dinkum with the voters of Western Australia.</p>
<p>The interesting this is that not only does Labor want to keep the carbon tax, it actually wants to increase the carbon tax because if they’re going to raise the emissions reduction target from 5 per cent to 15 per cent, obviously they’re going to need an even bigger carbon tax to try to achieve that reduction.</p>
<p>So, Labor’s plan is not just to keep the carbon tax, but to increase it.</p>
<p>That’s why it’s so important that we get a strong Senate full of Senators who will stand up for the people and against the Greens; full of Senators from Western Australia who will stand up for this great state.</p>
