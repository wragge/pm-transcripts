    <content><![CDATA[<p>From 1 July 2010, the Australian Government will provide 651 new transition care places to help up to 4,800 older people leave hospital sooner and take pressure off the state and territory hospital systems.</p>
<p>The new places will be fully funded by the Australian Government as part of its $293.2 million commitment to provide an additional 2,000 transition care places by 30 June 2012.</p>
<p>Too many older Australians are staying in the acute hospital sector for too long after a hospital procedure. The transition care program is about helping older people get the most appropriate care and rehabilitation when and where they need it.</p>
<p>Transition care provides up to 12 weeks of clinical and practical support such as physiotherapy and nursing support or personal care to help older people recover and regain their independence. It can be offered in the home, in community rehabilitation centres and temporarily in residential aged care homes.</p>
<p>Last financial year, the transition care program helped more than 12,600 people recover from a hospital stay with 4 out of 5 either improving or maintaining their level of health and independence.</p>
<p>We are determined to get the hospital and aged care sectors working together so that older Australians receive the most appropriate care in the most appropriate setting.</p>
<p>The 651 new transition beds will extend care for older Australians beyond the hospital doors, allowing older Australians to continue to live in their own homes and their own communities.</p>
<p>This investment builds on the:</p>
<p>     * More than 10,000 new aged care places that have become operational under the Rudd Government, including 698 new transition care places;</p>
<p>     * Nearly 20 per cent increase in funding for aged care services; and</p>
<p>     * $500 million in funding to expand subacute care services.</p>
<p>The new places will be rolled-out from July 1, 2010 and will become operational throughout the financial year.</p>
