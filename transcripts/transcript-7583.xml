PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF NEWS CONFERENCE, TWEEDSXUIR USTAURANTp<br />
BRISBANE 20 APRIL 1989<br />
I ON PROOM ONLY<br />
JOURNALIST: Your response last night to the disturbance<br />
which greeted Mr Howard.<br />
PM: I don't like demonstrations which reach the point where<br />
there's same danger to people against whom the demonstration<br />
is directed. I don't draw any pleasure or comfort from any<br />
situation if there's been any hurt to Mr Howard or anyone<br />
associated with him. I disagree with him very much on most<br />
issues but I wish him no physical danger at all.<br />
JOURNALIST: In it an indication of how volatile this<br />
imigration debate could become?<br />
IX: It is an area which does arouse passion and it's one of<br />
the great regrets that I have that what had been for such a<br />
long time an area in which there was just no question, but<br />
. therm was total bipartisanship&amp; that that was fractured to<br />
some eztent. I hope that will come to an and but whatever<br />
the background I simply don't want to see a situation where<br />
my political opponents or anyone in politics f or that matter<br />
are subject to processes involving danger. We have to draw<br />
the line in this country between the right to demonstrate and<br />
to protest and the unacceptable practise of inflicting damage<br />
or hurt to others.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Prime Minister, im the British takeover bid<br />
for food giant Goodman Fielder in Australia's interests?<br />
PX: This is something which will obviously have to be<br />
examined by the Treasurer and by those advising him. I will<br />
clearly be consulted about this and want to get some<br />
indication of what the views are an to the implications of<br />
such a bid if it was successful. But I don't prejudge that<br />
ezamination. JOURNALIST: John Moore finally released his privatization<br />
policy. Do you personally believe the airlines should be<br />
privatized? I<br />

do WA ir-</p>
<p>PM: I an not expressing my personal view about these<br />
processes because what is going on at the moment in that we<br />
have within the Labor Party committees examining this issue.<br />
I'll have directly and indirectly some input. to those<br />
process. s but I'll conduct that within the processes of the<br />
Party rather than publicly.<br />
JOU7NALIST: This trip you have been emphasising education<br />
issues, does this indicate the. HEawke Government is going to<br />
concentrate even more to improve education in Australia?<br />
PM: No, what it indicates is this. Firstly that we are very<br />
proud of our achievements in this area, as we are entitled to<br />
be. When you think of the basic fact of what we have done to<br />
lift the participation rate from that miserably low<br />
36 per cent that we inherited up to 58 per cent, the enormous<br />
increase in the number of places in the tertiary system, the<br />
great increases in funding for training programs in<br />
Australia, the uplift of the apprenticeship system and the<br />
traineeship system, we have got an enormous story to tall<br />
which has lifted Australia from a position where we were low<br />
in world rankings to one where we are going up and up as we<br />
should be so that we create a society where all young people<br />
irrespective of the income level of their parents are going<br />
to have the opportunity of fully training their talents. Now<br />
it 4.4 a matter of pride for arn that we can tell that story<br />
and we will continue in the years ahead to do those things.<br />
For instance, if you are talking about the future we have<br />
already made the decisions in the tertiary education area<br />
which will create In the next three to four years an<br />
additional .40,000 places or the equivalent of another<br />
Adelaide, Melbourne and Sydney university. So those major<br />
decisions f or the future are already in place.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr U1awke, you had a go at President Reagan about<br />
S tQhuea ylweh, e atw haptr obclaen m, w e yopuo'sysei blnyo w dot altok edg ett o tVhiecm e-tPo rebsaicdke notf f and<br />
give our wheat farmers a decent go?<br />
PM: Well we won't declare war. What you've got is only the<br />
processes of hard persuasion, the pressing of facts. I have<br />
put the facts before Vice-President Quayle, at this stage he<br />
doesn't seem to want to understand the facts,, we will<br />
continue to put those to our friends in the United States<br />
Administration. If you look at wheat for instance the facts<br />
simply are that in those of our overseas markets which<br />
haven't been targetted by the Export Enhancement Program we<br />
have maintained our sales. In the seven countries where the<br />
REP has been operating, where they have targetted, then we've<br />
suffered significant losses, and particularly that's true in<br />
regard to the Soviet Union and China. The facts are simply<br />
indisputable and we will keep pressing them upon our friends<br />
in the United States to got then to see reason. </p>
<p>-3-<br />
JOURNALIST: Are you disappointed that Kr Quayle should come<br />
out with the statements that he did so soon after<br />
negotiations with you on such a sensitive issue?<br />
PM: Well you could hardly call then negotiations. I wasn't<br />
in a negotiating position with him, I wasn in a postion where<br />
I was telling him Australia's view and what the facts are.<br />
But we'll have to continue to press our case, as we will, at<br />
all levels of the Administration and that will be done by<br />
myself and by my Ministers. This in something in which we<br />
have the support of the National Farmers Federation as veil.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Howard said today that instead of<br />
ratifying the Antarctica Treaty maybe we should look at a<br />
total. at not ratifying it, a total ban on mining in<br />
Antarctica to keep it in pristine condition?<br />
PM: Well its very interesting to hear Mr Howard saying<br />
anything about the environment which is relevant because the<br />
record of the conservatives in this country on environmental<br />
matters iB appalling. We will have this issue coming before<br />
the Cabinet, there will be submissions before us which will<br />
canvass the pros and the cons of the proposed convention.<br />
The argument of those who are supporting it is that in the<br />
absence of some convention you wouldn't have any regime at<br />
all which would inhibit anyone going in there and just having<br />
an open slather. Nov I'll be looking at this very very<br />
closely with my colleagues to ensure the decision that ye<br />
take is one which is most likely to protect that environment.<br />
JOURNMAL IST: Mr Howard also indicated yesterday that if he<br />
became a government the Liberals would try to encourage<br />
domestic saving. Now could that be an attractive proposition<br />
in an election mode?<br />
PM: Well I find it difficult to believe that anything that<br />
Mr Howard or the Liberals would do would be found to be<br />
terribly attractive by the electorate at the moment because<br />
they are going through a period where they are demonstrating<br />
graphically to the Australian electorate that they can't<br />
manage their own affairs. Internally they can't govern<br />
themselves so they won't be acceptable an a government of<br />
Australia. On the question of the substantial question of<br />
savings under this hypothetical Liberal governmnt, I don't<br />
know wh * at people would have to save because I asked people to<br />
remember that in every wage case of the last 20 Mr Howard has<br />
opposed any wage increase and his recent propositions are<br />
that he would support wage increases based on productivity,<br />
to have a trend productivity of about one and a half per<br />
cent. It means virtually no increase in wages. So not only<br />
is the question of a Howard government entirely hypothetical<br />
but so is the question of people having anything to save upon<br />
which any interest could he taxed or untaxed. But let Mr<br />
Howard go on with his own business of trying to get his Party </p>
<p>in order, we'll go about the business of ruinning the economy<br />
of the country efficiently and directing our concerns to<br />
trying to ensure that as far as possible we reduce the demand<br />
upon overseas savings. My Government has brought about a<br />
reduction in the deficit and the creation of a surplus that<br />
means that there is no public sector borrowing requirement,<br />
we make no demands as a Government upon the savings of<br />
others. I don't think he has really got anything useful to<br />
say on the economic debate at-all.<br />
JOURNALIST: He has also indicated, Prime Minister, that he.<br />
would like to fight the next election on the question of the<br />
level of Australia's overseas debt. How vouldf1, eel about<br />
that?<br />
PM: Look its just silly, I man it really is a silly<br />
question and a silly observation about Mr Howard wanting to<br />
fight an election on any issue. He can't get his own house<br />
into order, its very doubtful whether he will be leading<br />
then when we got to the next election. So why should I be<br />
taking any notice of this transient leader talking about what<br />
he would like to fight an election on.<br />
JOURNALIST: in the Power cup tomorrow?<br />
PN%. I don't know, I haven't seen the field.<br />
ends </p>
