TRANSCRIPT OF NEWS CONFERENCE, PARLIAMENT HOUSE<br />
26 FEBRUARY 1989<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, you sent off the letters to the<br />
States about the housing summit. Are you in a position to<br />
let us know what you told them?<br />
PM: Importantly, we've indicated to the States that over<br />
the next five years we've identified some 2000 hectares of<br />
Commonwealth owned land that we'll make available for<br />
housing. That's the equivalent of the best part of some<br />
30,000 blocks or the equivalent of some 15 to 18 new suburbs<br />
and then a similar sort of amount in the some ten years,<br />
five to ten years after that period of release of those 2000<br />
hectares. So that's a significant contribution that we've<br />
identified and we've also sent them a paper which sets out<br />
the state of activity in the housing industry. So I think<br />
on the basis of what we've provided we now have the<br />
opportunity for a sensible constructive discussion between<br />
ourselves and the States and I certainly want to make the<br />
point that we're not in the business of political point<br />
scoring, we don't want fights about this. We really want to<br />
do what we can together to tackle what is a fairly serious<br />
issue in the community.<br />
JOURNALIST: There's speculation about an early election<br />
again. Can you tell us your current thinking on the date?<br />
PM: No change. Let me repeat I'm getting tired of it but<br />
I repeat it will be some time between the latter part of<br />
this year and the middle of next year.<br />
JOURNALIST: Does that rule out September and October Prime<br />
Minister? PM: I suppose September/ October would be reasonably<br />
identified as being within the latter part of this year.<br />
I'm not being coy about this, that's what I've said and<br />
that's what I mean.<br />
JOURNALIST: So September would be the earliest?<br />
PM: It's very hard to see it being before that.<br />
JOURNALIST: What will you be telling Caucus this afternoon?<br />
What's your message to your </p>
<p>-2-<br />
PM: Obviously Peter you wouldn't be expecting me to give<br />
you all the detail of what I'm going to but essentially I<br />
can say this, that I'll be pointing out to them that we're<br />
now virtually on the eve of the completion of six years of<br />
government. By the time we go to the election it will be in<br />
the order of seven years of government, seven years of us<br />
compared with seven years of the conservatives immediately<br />
preceeding that. It will be a good basis for comparison to<br />
go to the electorate. We have the task, the major task<br />
remains, the. running of the economy. It's a difficult task<br />
but fortunately it's the task of running a strong and<br />
booming economy and at the same time as we have to ensure<br />
that that doesn't overheat to an unacceptable degree we'll<br />
be continuing in this year with the task of improving the<br />
living standards of Australians in general through the<br />
processes of getting an effective wages/ taxes outcome. Also<br />
at both ends of the spectrum, the age spectrum that is, we<br />
will be doing things of importance for the aged and for the<br />
young. Now I emphasise that these things are not being done<br />
for the sake of an election, they represent the continuum of<br />
policies and processes that have been underway for several<br />
years. But they will be impacting in 1989, it's appropriate<br />
that they should do because that's the natural time of<br />
outcome of the processes that have been underway during the<br />
life of this government. So in total we, I believe, have<br />
reason for confidence but not complacency.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, is a treaty with Aborigines<br />
still on the Government's agenda?<br />
PM: It's on the agenda but I remind you of what I've said,<br />
and that is that I hope that it may be possible to achieve<br />
that within the life of this Parliament but at all times<br />
I've said I'm not going to concertina processes in an<br />
unrealistic way. It's essential if that sort of outcome is<br />
going to be effective in the long term that both the<br />
Aboriginal community and the non-Aboriginal community have<br />
the opportunity of a full deliberation, consideration of the<br />
issues involved. We'll continue to work on that.<br />
JOURNALIST: Is the question of the judges' salaries more<br />
difficult now than when the recommendations were made last<br />
year, and when will Cabinet consider them?<br />
PM: It was always going to be a reasonably difficult one<br />
because you had the two issues. One, the intrinsic issue of<br />
what you need to pay the judiciary but secondly, associated<br />
with that, our consideration of it takes place in the<br />
context of us still needing the community as a whole to<br />
exercise restraint in their wages claim. So we'll be<br />
dealing with that in a way which I think will meet both the<br />
requirements because there is no doubt there is a need for<br />
an increase in salaries for members of the judiciary but<br />
it's got to be handled in a way which does not give any<br />
basis for exaggerated claims outside that area. </p>
<p>-3-<br />
JOURNALIST: Does that mean they can't look forward to the<br />
full recommended increases of the Remuneration Tribunal?<br />
PM: We'll work this out precisely in the near future. What<br />
I'm saying is that I'm not going to be saying on television<br />
or a news conference just what the precise sort of outcome<br />
is within the limits of the Remuneration Tribunal report.<br />
It's not the appropriate place to do it.<br />
JOURNALIST: Is election speculation damaging the perception<br />
of your Government at the moment?<br />
PM: No.<br />
JOURNALIST: In terms of the next election Prime Minister,<br />
how useful is it to ensure on the Labor Party's part that<br />
John Howard remain Leader of the Opposition?<br />
PM: I don't mind who I have to fight as Leader of the<br />
Opposition. I've gotten used to John Howard but what are<br />
they going to do, are they going to recycle Andrew or are<br />
they going to bring in John Elliot, Peter Shack? I mean<br />
none of them really are going to inspire great confidence in<br />
the electorate. One would be a recycled leader, the others<br />
obviously not up to it, so if it's John Howard then that's<br />
ok. But basically I noticed that while John Howard has been<br />
entering into speculation about what may happen on this side<br />
of politics I'm not going to return the compliment really.<br />
I just suggest to John that I think he'd have his hands<br />
pretty full in making sure that he watches his own flanks.<br />
The interesting thing is that it's only on the conservative<br />
side of politics where the problems of leadership exist.<br />
ends </p>
