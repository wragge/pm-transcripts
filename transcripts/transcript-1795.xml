FOR PRESS': PM. No. 31/ 1968<br />
DEEPARTMENT OF THE CflINET OFFICE<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, Mr John Gorton<br />
His Excellency the Governor-General in Council has<br />
today, in pursuance of Section 64 of the Constitution, established a new<br />
Department of State of the Commonwealth entitled the Department of the<br />
Cabinet Office. The new Department will have the function of servicing<br />
the Cabinet and the Committees of Cabinet, which it Is planned to extend<br />
in number, and of assisting the Prime Minister in the expeditious ordering<br />
of Cabinet business and proceedings.<br />
This decision means a division of the former Prime<br />
Minister's Department between its Cabinet activities and Its non-Cabinet<br />
activities with an e Xpansion of service t o the Prime Minister on each<br />
side. As is well known, the servicing of Cabinet has hitherto<br />
been a part of the functions of the Prime Minister's Department and the<br />
Secretary of the Department also had the role of Secretary to the<br />
Cabinet. Cabinet pressures have been steadily increasing because of th~ e<br />
diversity and complexity of Government action In the Federal sphere, and<br />
must be expected to continue to do so. At the same time, the other demands<br />
on the Department have risen steadily, and these also will continue to do<br />
SO. In the Government's view, the time has now come when<br />
these two major activities should be separated If each I s to receive the<br />
necessary attention and control required for the full conduct of the<br />
Government's business. Sir John Bunting, C. B. E. has been appointed S-ecretary<br />
to the Department of the Cabinet Office and Mr C. L. S. Hewitt, 0. B. E.,<br />
has been appointed Secretary to the Prime Minister's Department.<br />
Both Permanent Heads will be members of the Defence<br />
Committee. CANBERRA, 11 March 1968 </p>
