TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW WITH KEVIN HUME, ABC RADIO 2 7<br />
JANUARY 1993<br />
3 AND OE PROOF ONLY<br />
HUME; Prime Minister, why bother to battle for Carmen, she<br />
is dead and gone isn't she?<br />
Flit I don't think so. Carmen is held In high esteem and<br />
the polls tell us that. She has done a first class job in<br />
tightening up the admuinistration here in Western Australia,<br />
she is an honest# decent, hardworking person who is running a<br />
fairly tight government and I think she has every reason to be<br />
re-elected.<br />
HUME: Every reason to be re-elected, a fairly cautious<br />
endorsement. I mean the polls are showing 9/ 10% swing against<br />
Labor. PM: Polls are not always right, they are not always<br />
right and we will see What happens on polling day. She has<br />
had a battle and she has known that but all the same she is in<br />
there with a chance.<br />
HUJMEt Your talked yesterday about generational change,<br />
Richard Court in a sense represents generational change or<br />
does he?<br />
FM: I don't think so, much the samne age, he and Carmen.<br />
No if Carmen were an elderly person I would say yes that's<br />
fair comment, if she was the age of you know Joh Bjelke<br />
Petersen or Charlie Court or somebody, fair enough, but she is<br />
a young peruon as a Premier and I don't think the generational<br />
change in turn anyway. If a generational change refers to a<br />
youthful view of the world, a youthful view of the world and a<br />
sort of upbeat progressive view of the world, she is a younger<br />
person than Richard Court in.<br />
HUME1 if you look back to the 19809 the heritage of the<br />
past, the baggage of the past that Premier Lawrence has got to<br />
T2EL8: . Jan. 93 7: 42 No. 001 P. 01/ 09 </p>
<p>T2EL8:. Jan. 93 7: 42 No. 001 P. 02/ 09<br />
2.<br />
HUM ( cont'd) discard, part of it includes Of course<br />
economic rationalism. Does economic rationalism to you these<br />
days represent the baggage of the past?<br />
PM: I don't think it includes economic rationalism. I<br />
think it includes state participation' in the private economy<br />
and a lot of questioning about that but the issue is it was<br />
she who set up the processes of enquiry into these policies<br />
and therefore I think that any problems in the way in which<br />
the state has functioned in those respects shouldn't be<br />
sheeted home to her.<br />
MUMS$ Let's look at the wider question of economic<br />
rationlism and your own promise with the coming federal<br />
election to bring just a touch of the Whitlams back into the<br />
campaign, a touch of excitment certainly from the 1970s but<br />
it's curious to look to the past to find that contemporary<br />
touch of magic to inspire the electorate isn't it.<br />
PM1 I think so. I think politics is about imagination<br />
and you can't get nations to do great things, great deed.<br />
without a sense of imagination by the public and it is the job<br />
of political leaders to instill that sense of imagination in<br />
them and I should have thought in the last year we have done<br />
quite a bit of that.<br />
IjUMEt Can you successfully remake yourself though from the<br />
1980s, can you shed all of the baggage from the 1980s?<br />
P21: I don't want to, I am not intending on remaking<br />
myself at all, not one bit. I mean it depends, you are<br />
confusing the terms I think rationalists with the ideology of<br />
the right. The view that sort of John Hewbon subscribes to<br />
the sort of Margaret Thatcher, Reagan view, I wan never for<br />
that but I was always for rational policy not for irrational<br />
policy and you can't com~ pare Australia today to 1983 or 1984.<br />
Here we are now a much more interesting country, much more<br />
diverse industries, much greater wide basis to our wealth.<br />
This is the first year we have exported more manufactured<br />
goods and rural goods than rural products. The great bulk of<br />
those, the greatest growth in those has elaborately<br />
transformed manufactures which we just were not doing a decade<br />
ago. International services, medical services, education<br />
services, health services, tourism, were just not traded<br />
services ten years ago. These came because of a Labor<br />
government turning Australia into a proper functioning market<br />
economy. HUM There have been considerable costs as we have<br />
seen with the continuing turmoil for example over the banks,<br />
the role of the ~ eevBzkwhether regulation ought to be<br />
reintroduced and tightened in the 1990., a dereg4latory<br />
fervour as though you were not susceptible to it. But there<br />
were certain TEL </p>
<p>TEL: 28. Jan .93 ? 7: 42 No .001 P. 03/ 09<br />
3.<br />
PM: It's not a matter of being susceptible to it.<br />
I introduced deregulation but you can't halt introduce it,<br />
that's the old point about pregnancy, you can't be half<br />
pregnant, you either are or you are not. If, when I was for<br />
instance deregulating deposit maturity controls back in the<br />
savings banks for instancel well trading bank. couldn't<br />
accept deposits under 30 days. Why? Why? No reason. So what<br />
do you say we won't go to accept deposits, any deposits at any<br />
duration, we will only make It 15 days, we will only partly<br />
deregulate. I mean what Ise the rationalisation<br />
HUJMES I am confused here, you are saying that<br />
Thatcher and Reagan for example were excessive in their<br />
fervour as far as deregulation in concerned. You are saying<br />
as far as you were concerned you couldn't be a half<br />
deregulator? PM8 No, no because Thatcher and Reaganism is not<br />
about deregulation, it was about basically no role for<br />
government. it was about government withdrawing, it was about<br />
ripping down the public sector, It was about not breaking the<br />
social wage, the safety net, those people didn't care about<br />
access and equity in education or access and equity for health<br />
or access and equity in age care. These are the things that<br />
marked out the Labor Government against the cold winds from<br />
the northern hemisphere in the 80s. The things we had In<br />
common was making economies function, function more naturally.<br />
That I regard as simply rational.<br />
HUME: One of the costs again of the boo in a sense<br />
though was the increasing internatioflalisation of that<br />
deregulated world economy we are seeing with the turmoil on<br />
the foreign exchange market day by day for example. The<br />
extent to which the Treasurer and the Government, the Keating<br />
Government in a sense is a prisoner of those International<br />
forces, Do you regret in any sense having to deregulate to a<br />
degree to make Australia more competitive, more part of that<br />
International economy?<br />
PM8 No, we just had to happen, it just had to<br />
happen. You look at western Australia, western Australia is<br />
a mining and agricultural state. Just imagine how it would be<br />
without a proper exchange rate mechanism, without a<br />
competitive exchange rate, wh~ ere would those iron ore mines<br />
be. HUME$ But it has made you a prisoner in a sense those<br />
international gnomes in Zurich, hasn't it?<br />
PM: No, no that's all static from the Left, you<br />
have been mixing with too Many Lefties mate, that's just<br />
voodoo stuff. You are a prisoner of your economic<br />
performance. Floating exchange rates came because when some<br />
people were inflating at lot and others at 2 they wouldn't<br />
take your currency for theirs because yours wasn't worth Ea<br />
much, so the fixed exchange rates went, so what was going to </p>
<p>TEL<br />
4 PM ( cont'd) be put in its place? Obviously mobile floating<br />
exchange rates and in the days of low inflation when everybody<br />
warn inflating about the same low rates of inflation you could<br />
keep fixed exchange rates. But you have seen how difficult<br />
it's been with Britain. I had a lot of people in this country<br />
Say to me in the 80s we shouldn't have our currency tied to<br />
something, look at Britain it's joined the SRm and I used to<br />
say yea, this is a mistake they won't stay there and of course<br />
it's proven to be true. They tried to stick with the fiction<br />
that a country which was lose productive and more high cost<br />
could keep its currency on a par with one which was more<br />
productive and lower coat and of course In the end people<br />
won't swap your currency for theirs for the same price. So<br />
floating exchange rates in fact covert they make the<br />
difference. In other words they make the system equilibrate.<br />
HUXhEt But they still create considerable political<br />
and economical turmoil for a P'rime Minister heading into a<br />
very tight federal election.<br />
PM: There is no turmoil here. There Is turmoil in<br />
Britain with a fixed exchange rate but there is none here.<br />
The exchange rate has come down over a period of time, there<br />
is an occasional flutter and it gets a headline in the<br />
newspaper but by and large the system works and it works<br />
because it's in a sense the shock absorber that takes the<br />
change, be that change be the difference in the terms of<br />
trade, that Is the falling prices for commodities etc or be It<br />
be in Interest rates, whatever it Might be that exchange rate<br />
takes the shock and takes the change. You intimate therefore<br />
we are sort of prisoners of that, what you are if you are a<br />
prisoner of anything you are a prisoner of your economic<br />
performance, you can change all this by changing your economic<br />
performance and countries that don't change their economic<br />
performance, that don't be productive, that basically lay back<br />
on the oars, fine, in the and someone marks them down.<br />
HUME: Let's look at other prisoners of the past<br />
internationally then. John major certainly, Bill Clinton<br />
certainly. The Germans with the price of reunification still<br />
to be paid and hoping to Make it to be paid through credit<br />
cards rather than in a sense through raising taxes. The<br />
Japanese also suffering because of their past enthusiasm for<br />
asset inflation from the late 1960s, stock market fervour and<br />
so on. All prisoners of the past, to that extent you and your<br />
Government and this country is also a prisoner of the past and<br />
the legacy of the past internationally.<br />
PM: The past that I have had to deal with was the<br />
sloth of the coalition parties who believe that we should be<br />
just left with agriculture and minerals. I mean they took the<br />
view when I became Treasurer in 1983 only three kids in ten<br />
completed secondary school. They didn't think we needed to<br />
educate the workforce, they didn't believe we needed to do<br />
sophisticated things like sell health, medical, tourism<br />
services. They didn't believe in high value added products,<br />
T: 28 Jan .93 7: 42 No. 001 P. 04/ 09 </p>
<p>TEL: 28. Jan. 93 ?: 42 No. 001 P. 05/ 09<br />
PHMi ( Cont' 14) they believed basically in farms and quarries.<br />
it has lot us down, that's what produced our national debt,<br />
it's that basic weakness that occurred over 25 years that<br />
produced the rise in our national debt and the only way out of<br />
it is to change the basic nature of the economy so you can pay<br />
for yourself. That you can pay for your imports and you do it<br />
in a way adding value rather than selling primitive<br />
things, primitive things or primary things. Now that is the<br />
job that I had to do that wasn to change all that, to change<br />
all that culture to an outward looking productive culture and<br />
it's changing. As I said this is the first year in our history<br />
where we have exported more manufactures than rural products.<br />
HUMEs Ten years on the point again is still that<br />
Australia is a prisoner of the past, the legacy of Reagan and<br />
Thatcher to a degree a prisoner also of international forces<br />
whether they are the stock market, international foreign<br />
exchange PM; I don't think we are prisoners of anything. I<br />
think Australia is in a position to control it's own affairs.<br />
If it wishes to promote its investment, if it wishes to<br />
produce more product, I~ f it's productive sectors are more<br />
supple and there is a larger level of production then of<br />
course our current account deficit will be lower, our exchange<br />
rate will be stronger. What I am trying to say long windedly<br />
it's all up to us. But it you want to lay back and not make<br />
the changes well you get beaten up, you will get beaten up by<br />
markets. There is no one looking out after you any more<br />
that's all changed and the changes of the 80s mean that we are<br />
now a long way on the path of changing Australia towards that<br />
kind of integrated with the Pacif ic particularly and<br />
integrated productive international culture.<br />
MUME: I can certainly understand your optimism, if I<br />
can quote some Jerimiahs from Britain though, economic<br />
forecasters and others. You say that 1990s because of the<br />
past is going to be a decade of stagnation essentially, It's<br />
going to be a repeat to a degree of the slump of the<br />
America is bound by $ 460 billion of budget deficit, Clinton<br />
can do vey little in the way that PDR did in the 1930.<br />
something like the economy. The Germans as I have indicated<br />
are unwilling to do anything-<br />
PHI The Germans-<br />
HUMEt finance themselves through credit card<br />
fantasies. Not the most encouraging with which you have<br />
to work as Treasurer or Prime Minister.<br />
PM: That's true, the Germans are obsessed with<br />
inflation and they are now through their policy of their<br />
central bank largely hurting, seriously and badly the<br />
economies of western Europe starting of course at Britain, nov<br />
France, now others. The. French Franc is seriously overvalued<br />
and it's hurting, desperately hurting the French economy. But </p>
<p>TEL: 28. Jan .93 7: 42 No. 001 P. 06/ 09<br />
6. PHI ( cont d) the people in the Bundesbank are keeping the<br />
pressure on those economies to make certain that their<br />
domestic change, that is the incorporation of East Germany<br />
into West Germany is a low inflationary incorporation. in<br />
other ' words-i~ yare prepared to punish the rest of Europe. I<br />
don't approve of that but it's happening we have got to live<br />
with it. Japan is in a recession because of the spread of<br />
credit in the 80s, credit in the BOB went beserk, it went<br />
beserk in Australia. That's part of when you were talking<br />
earlier about the problems in Western Australia. It was part<br />
of that credit binge, the availability of credit, the easy<br />
availability of credit through international credit markets.<br />
HIUO1k48, let's look at solutions then. Bill Clinton<br />
again, the generational change we talked about at the<br />
beginning of our discussion. He has hedged in there in very<br />
little that he can do, he cannot in the sense be FDR as he<br />
might want to be. Can he though reform the international<br />
economic order which is still tilted against countries like<br />
Australia? PM: I think he can, I have great hope and<br />
expectation for Clinton. I am very heartened by his presence<br />
by his attitudes and I think he is in a good position. People<br />
need to remember this that America, like Australia, today<br />
there is one in ten roughly out of work. in the Depression it<br />
was three in ten, this is not to be compared this period.<br />
American production fell by 33% between 1929 and 1933, the<br />
month that Roosevelt was inaugurated three years back to the<br />
stockmarket crash of 1929 American GDP, Aimrican product fell<br />
by 33%. In the last two years American products has fallen by<br />
3% 9 3% not 33, so I think that gives you the relative<br />
weightings. We have got problems, yes, but they are solvable,<br />
they are capable of solution and I think Clinton has the<br />
energy and the youthfulness and the mandate to go and do it.<br />
HUMEt But much depends on either revival of the north<br />
south dialogue from the 706, redressing the balance between<br />
the third and first world or some sort of fairly fundamental<br />
readjustment of the terms of trade around the world. We are<br />
in crisis.<br />
PH: That's what the GAMis about, that's what the<br />
General Agreement on Trades and Ta riffs is about.<br />
HUME1 There has been certainly a significant shift In<br />
terms of GATTr but the job has barely started. It was an<br />
interim arrangement until Clinton gets in there one surely<br />
must hope that Clinton will see the need for radical change<br />
for the world economic order if it is to survive, if<br />
prosperity is to continiue.<br />
PMS We have certainly played more than our role, a<br />
bigger role than our size in getting agriculture into the<br />
GATT. I must say we, I mean this Government in getting<br />
agriculture in to the GATT agenda and the GATT discussion in </p>
<p>TEL: 28. Jan. 93 7: 42 No. 001 P. 07/ 09<br />
7. MH ( cont'd) 1986 and It's in there now and there in some<br />
likelihood now that we will get a Solution on agriculture<br />
which we will mean we will have an international regime for<br />
trading goods, in services in intellectual property rights and<br />
in agriculture. This will be a great backdrop for Clinton to<br />
inherit the American presidency and a very enthusiastic and<br />
bull point for Australia in finding itself in a fairer trading<br />
world. They are the things you can do as well as all the<br />
bilateral things that's between our country and another<br />
country but It's the multilateral, it's the great world steps<br />
like the GATT which make the difference. SQ I am quite<br />
optimistic, get the GATT together get a decent backdrop in<br />
trade, further liberalisation of trade in the Asia Pacific,<br />
the development of APEC which this Government has started in<br />
the Asia Pacific area, a pickup in American growth, a better<br />
rationing of credit worldwide. I don't think there is cause<br />
for pessimism about the 90s at all. notwithstanding the<br />
excesses of the 80o and they were huge excesses. People talk<br />
about the roaring 20a it was nothing like the roaring 808, the<br />
credit growth of the 80s was profound and this has been part<br />
of Australia's problem. The reason we had the boom in the late<br />
which was then we had to slow down was because of the<br />
excessive growth of bank credit.<br />
HiUAMmEe rican historian Arthur Slessenger, he was<br />
associated with the Kennedy regime in the early 60a in the<br />
USA, pointed a couple of years ago before the trends were<br />
evident perhaps of the 1990s like the 60. and like the 30s in<br />
America and through the western world being a decade of reemergent<br />
belief that government was good, that government<br />
regulation as necessary. Things have changed though, part of<br />
the generational changes you see in the USA is increasing<br />
diversity and fragmentation, multiplicity of races and of<br />
Interests and so on, it becomes more difficult in that sense<br />
for government properly to govern and to manage that diversity<br />
and that rapid pace of change.<br />
PH: This has always been an issue in this century<br />
the belief that the two competing beliefs, one that private<br />
intiative and private reward Is a key to all prosperity, the<br />
other the government involvement and government planning as<br />
the key and you sort of go from Calvin Coolidge on the one<br />
hand to Franklin Roosevelt on the other back to Eisenhower<br />
then over to Lyndon Johnson's great society then back over to<br />
Nixon, across to Carter and then Reagan and now of course Bill<br />
Clinton who takes the view that there is a role for<br />
government. So it's been a competition for that view what is<br />
best. Now what I have said is this I believe in community<br />
values, I believe the dominant national values of this<br />
country, of Australia should be community values not<br />
individual values. My opponent John Howson believes In<br />
individual values, he thinks if you keep the wealthy woalthy<br />
and they have got a buck well the rest will trail along<br />
successfully behind. I don't believe that, I believe that we<br />
ought to be addressing the country as a community so it is<br />
important that people can get health protection and health </p>
<p>TEL: 28 . Jan .93 42 No 00 F'. U6/ Ui~<br />
PM: ( cont'd) insurance at a decent rate and find themselves<br />
covered for health regardless of income. I do believe that<br />
kids from working class families ought to avail themselves of<br />
secondary schooling and got into universities and into TAPE.<br />
I don't think it ought to be a matter of how much you can<br />
afford to pay as John Howson-does and I think that is the<br />
difference. That In whether a nation commits itself to<br />
community values or individual values and what has happened in<br />
America is 160 million Americans have voted for community<br />
value, f or the policies of Clinton and I have made the point<br />
here and it's worth making to you Kevin. in this election<br />
John Howson is going to ask the Australian electorate to vote<br />
for individual values, to vote for Reagan Thatcher values<br />
against the kind of values which 160 million Americans have<br />
just voted. 80 that is why I think that it's not really about<br />
deregulation or whether the gnomes have got us or what have<br />
you, it's about this nice happy fit of an effective market<br />
economy built around a decent social wage and social policy<br />
and safety not and you can do thorn both and that's why social<br />
democratic parties, Labor Parties have been more successful at<br />
doing this than any in the world and I think we have a pretty<br />
unique mix. We have got one of the best social security<br />
safety nets in the world and it's worth fighting for and at<br />
the same time we have got an economy in a modern transition.<br />
HUMES But the X f actor beyond all of this again to<br />
refer back to another theme of our conversation which you have<br />
moved away from time to time is the ghosts of the past, the<br />
ghosts of Calvin Coolidge If you like. An extent to which in<br />
the public Australian mind Paul Keating Is seen as the ghost<br />
who still walks of Calvin Coolidge and Ronald Reagan and<br />
Thatcher of the 1980s still stick to your clothing.<br />
VMS No# no.<br />
HUMS You can remake yourself<br />
PHI But where do you think Medicare comes from,<br />
Where do you thinkc the family allowance supplement came from,<br />
where do you think supplementary payments for low paid women<br />
came from. Where do you think occupational superannuation<br />
4.. came from? It came from me when I was Treasurer, when I<br />
was Treasurer.<br />
HUMS beyond the world's greatest Treasurer,<br />
Treasurer who gave us the recession we had to have and so on.<br />
VMS No, what gave Australia the recession was a<br />
crazy leaning by Australian banks and the crazy borrowing by<br />
Australian business. That's basically where the overheating<br />
com'e from.<br />
HUME iHMS: And who was responsible for </p>
<p>TEL: 28. Jan .93 7: 42N No. 001 P. 0-9 /-0<br />
PM: And the slowdown was induced becaUDe we<br />
couldn't afford to go on blowing our national savings. Just<br />
understand this point, that in terms of social1 poli cy while<br />
the social policies of the Labor Government were the product<br />
of a number of people, I was the Treasurer for most of the<br />
period so if you go and ask say, an organisation like the<br />
ACTU, where did they come to give ordinary working people<br />
access to superannuation? They say the Treasurer, to me.<br />
Where do they come for the family supplement, for the funding,<br />
where do they come for continued changes in Medicare or<br />
increase in Bole parent pension or the aged pension or the<br />
hostel program or the home and community care? It came from<br />
the Budgets of which I was Treasurer. So don't put me in the<br />
Reagan and Thatcher category, that's Hewson, he believes in<br />
all that stuff. He never gives the people an even break, make<br />
them pay through the nose, rip Medicare apart, make them go<br />
and pay $ 30 a week for their health insurance, put a 15% GST<br />
on their back because they don't know what's good for them.<br />
Make them pay full fees at university for their kids, that's<br />
his view, it's not my view.<br />
HlUME% So realistically looking to the next federal<br />
election whenever it might be, what are the chances we are<br />
going to see Paul Keating up on television with dark glasses<br />
playing a saxophone like Bill Clinton, heralding in a new era?<br />
pmt I am not a saxophone player and he is, he is a<br />
good one as well and good for him but it's all about your view<br />
of the world. I mean I had the opportunity to take a middle<br />
sized OECD economy and change its orientation out to the rest<br />
of the world, make it f airer and more decent and make it<br />
productive and few people in life are given those sorts of<br />
opportunitites and I had mine 9 years before, 10 years before<br />
Bill Clinton had his opportunities. ' We are basically the same<br />
age so I had got at this stage a 10 year jump on him.<br />
