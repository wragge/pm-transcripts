<p> education, self-funded retirees</p>
<p>E&amp;OE................................................................................................</p>
<p>MILLER:</p>
<p>And your chance to talk to the Prime Minister this morning, welcome</p>
<p> to the studio Mr Howard.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Very nice to be here, John.</p>
<p>MILLER:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, if I may just prime the pump a little bit first by asking</p>
<p> about your meeting yesterday with Brian Harradine. The reports are</p>
<p> this morning that yourself and the Treasurer, Peter Costello, held</p>
<p> a meeting of almost an hours length with Senator Harradine yesterday,</p>
<p> no advisers in the room, are you happy with the outcome of the meeting?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>We did have a meeting and we obviously discussed a number of things</p>
<p> including our taxation plan. I don't think there is any point</p>
<p> in my speculating about what the ultimate outcome of that meeting</p>
<p> would be and I've always taken the view that if I have something</p>
<p> to say to Brian Harradine I do it to him in a courteous, direct way</p>
<p> with a personal discussion and I don't then go and give him public</p>
<p> advice as to when and how he should react to anything I put to him.</p>
<p> I don't think that's courteous and I don't think that</p>
<p> is productive and I really don't have anything to add to the</p>
<p> earlier confirmation that a meeting took place.</p>
<p>MILLER:</p>
<p>Okay. But would you describe the meeting then as amicable?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I always have amicable meetings with Brian Harradine. We don't</p>
<p> always agree, but he is a person for whom I have had a long regard.</p>
<p> We have different views on some issues, we have similar views on some</p>
<p> others. He is a very conscientious person, he's a true independent,</p>
<p> he thinks carefully and reflectively before he makes decisions on</p>
<p> issues. And I'm sure he will do that in relation to the taxation</p>
<p> plan as he does in relation to other issues. But I really can't</p>
<p> and won't say any more than that.</p>
<p>MILLER:</p>
<p>Alright, well then if you look at the newspapers this morning, The</p>
<p> Australian, for example, is saying that the fate of the GST is</p>
<p> set to be decided today when independent Senator Brian Harradine casts</p>
<p> his telling vote. Now, is that a possibility? Could it all be over</p>
<p> today?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, look, the only person who can accurately reflect the views of</p>
<p> Brian Harradine is Brian Harradine and I'm not going to say what</p>
<p> I think he may or may not do about this or that on a particular day,</p>
<p> that really is a matter for him.</p>
<p>MILLER:</p>
<p>Well, I must say, you are looking fairly relaxed and comfortable about</p>
<p> the matter.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I'm always pleased to be in Queensland. It's always</p>
<p> a great pleasure to be here away from Canberra. And can I just say</p>
<p> that it's been a good week for the Government because it's</p>
<p> been a good week for the country. We've delivered a first class</p>
<p> Budget that reinforces the economic strength of this country and sets</p>
<p> us up very well for the next century. So, I feel that we have put</p>
<p> down another marker of the good government we've tried to deliver</p>
<p> over the last three and a half years and the budget has been, deservedly</p>
<p> very well received. It's a good economic Budget but it's</p>
<p> also got a lot of social provision in it. We're spending a lot</p>
<p> more on the future, on research, on medical and scientific research,</p>
<p> we're doubling the funding there. We're spending more money</p>
<p> in giving working people choice in the education of their children.</p>
<p> We're spending more money on health in country areas, getting</p>
<p> GPs into the bush. We're spending more money in providing fresh</p>
<p> apprenticeships in the bush. We're extending work for the dole,</p>
<p> we're doubling it from 25 to 50,000 places. But we're also</p>
<p> delivering a strong surplus. So, I have every reason to feel that</p>
<p> we've been able to deliver a very positive Budget for the economy,</p>
<p> but one that makes very careful, sensitive social provision.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>We'll get to what Kim Beazley had to say last night in reply</p>
<p> in just a moment. But first of all the very night of the Budget, Simon</p>
<p> Crean was saying, this isn't the real Budget, because so much</p>
<p> of what's in it is contingent upon the GST, the sale of Telstra,</p>
<p> etc. Now what's your view on that? I mean, can you deliver on</p>
<p> the Budget without, if one of those two things falls over?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, this is about the next financial year and the GST doesn't</p>
<p> start till the following financial year. That was just a smokescreen</p>
<p> by Mr Crean to divert attention away from the Budget. Everyone knows</p>
<p> we went to the last election with a tax plan, it was the centre piece</p>
<p> of the campaign. You and I sat in these very chairs on a couple of</p>
<p> occasions during the campaign and debated the issue and I took calls</p>
<p> from listeners. We won that election. We told the public everything</p>
<p> of our plan, we didn't hold anything back, there was full disclosure</p>
<p> at every stage during the campaign. We also made full disclosure of</p>
<p> our plans in relation to Telstra. And what we are saying is that having</p>
<p> told the public what we intended to do if we won, having won we believe</p>
<p> we are entitled to implement what we told the public we would do.</p>
<p> A good feature of the Budget last Tuesday night was that we delivered</p>
<p> on every single promise that we made in the election campaign. The</p>
<p> Treasurer held up a document which listed every promise. They've</p>
<p> all been delivered. All of them. Because that is what elections are</p>
<p> meant to be about. They're about parties offering alternative</p>
<p> programmes and then if they win putting those programmes into effect.</p>
<p> And we're merely seeking the approval of the Parliament to do</p>
<p> what the public said it wanted us to do by re-electing us.</p>
<p>MILLER:</p>
<p>Okay, we've got a board full of calls and we would like to get</p>
<p> to them, but just very quickly, Kim Beazley last night said that you</p>
<p> were squandering a surplus because of your obsession with the GST</p>
<p> at the expense of jobs.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, that's wrong on both counts. We are not squandering the</p>
<p> surplus. We use the surplus to repay the debt that Mr Beazley ran</p>
<p> up. Mr Beazley ran up $80 - $90 billion of debt as Finance Minister,</p>
<p> and that surplus doesn't sit in the bank and moulder away, it</p>
<p> is actually used to repay debt. If you repay your debts you are not</p>
<p> squandering the money are you? You are putting it to a very useful</p>
<p> service and you are removing your future obligation to pay interest.</p>
<p>MILLER:</p>
<p>Now, I must admit that I find the idea of paying of the national mortgage</p>
<p> as it were very, very appealing.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, it is. Most people know very clearly the benefit for them of</p>
<p> that. Because the less interest, the lower the interest bill of the</p>
<p> government, indirectly the lower the interest bill of the citizen.</p>
<p> We have lower interest rates now than we have had for thirty years.</p>
<p> And one of the reasons for that is that the Federal Government, my</p>
<p> Government, has paid off debt and run budget surpluses. And not run</p>
<p> budget deficits. Because if you run budget deficits the government</p>
<p> is out there in the market borrowing money to pay for the deficit.</p>
<p> And that is increased competition for it for money and that pushes</p>
<p> up interest rates and that's one of the reasons why interest</p>
<p> rates are low, not the only one. And people appreciate that, people</p>
<p> know, the listeners know that they're $320 a month better off</p>
<p> because their housing mortgage has come down. And if you go back into</p>
<p> deficit you don't pay off the national credit card then you might</p>
<p> see your interest rates going up again.</p>
<p>MILLER:</p>
<p>Alright Prime Minister, we have got a very, very quick commercial</p>
<p> commitment here then we will come back and go straight to the phones</p>
<p>[COMMERCIAL BREAK]</p>
<p>MILLER:</p>
<p>Okay, as promised let's go to the phones now. Jeff, good morning,</p>
<p> you're speaking with the Prime Minister.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>Good morning, Prime Minister.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Good morning, Jeff.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, I'm a small business person. I've got four</p>
<p> children. My question is regarding supermarket chains and suppliers</p>
<p> of everyday necessities of life and how they're on costs, such</p>
<p> as provision of electrical, plumbing, air conditioning services, how</p>
<p> those costs will be reflected also in the price of food as well as</p>
<p> the cost of the GST will already add to it.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, one of the consequences of the GST of course is that the 10</p>
<p> per cent will be reduced by the fact that taxes you pay on some of</p>
<p> those things you mentioned will be fully refundable. And because you</p>
<p> pay taxes now which are not refundable your tax position will be better.</p>
<p> And that, of course, is the reason why everything doesn't go</p>
<p> up by 10 per cent. And it's been calculated, for example, that</p>
<p> 20 per cent of the cost of putting an item on a supermarket shelf</p>
<p> is fuel. Now, fuel is dramatically cheaper under the GST. Not only</p>
<p> have we brought in very significant reductions in the cost of diesel</p>
<p> fuel but because using fuel for business purposes will be a business</p>
<p> expense, and therefore any tax paid on that will be fully refundable</p>
<p> under a GST, on average the price of fuel will fall by seven cents</p>
<p> a litre for business purposes. And all of that adds up to a situation</p>
<p> where in the whole GST arrangement the cost of putting things on the</p>
<p> supermarket shelf will be reduced. And that is why, again I say, the</p>
<p> cost of items to the consumer is dramatically lower than the 10 per</p>
<p> cent.</p>
<p>MILLER:</p>
<p>Okay, Jeff, thanks for your call. Jim's on the line. Hello, Jim.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>Yeah, g'day John. Good morning, Mr Howard.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Good morning.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>The question I'd like to ask you is that your Government, as</p>
<p> well as the previous government, is so hell bent on user pays for</p>
<p> everything but as a taxpayer Â and I send my daughter to one</p>
<p> of the best State high schools in Queensland Â that why do part</p>
<p> of my taxes have to subsidise other people who decide they want to</p>
<p> send their children to private schools? I thought this was a choice,</p>
<p> what we do with our lives [inaudible] and if somebody wants to send</p>
<p> their children to what they call is a better classed education which</p>
<p> is fairly expensive, very expensive as you possibly would know yourself,</p>
<p> why should I have to subsidise those people who make that choice?</p>
<p> I make a choice, so do they, they should pay for it.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yeah, well, look, I understand that argument but that's an argument</p>
<p> that, of course, cuts both ways. People who send their children to</p>
<p> independent schools Â and many people send their children to</p>
<p> independent schools not as an exercise in elitism but as a matter</p>
<p> of conscience because they believe the attitudes and values of certain</p>
<p> independent schools are important to them, to their lives and to the</p>
<p> lives of their children. And what they say is that they pay taxes</p>
<p> like you and me Â and I am a product of a government school and</p>
<p> I've educated my own children in both the government and the</p>
<p> independent sectors, so I have a familiarity and a sensitivity towards</p>
<p> both Â but what those people equally say is, if I pay my taxes,</p>
<p> I'm entitled to get some of those taxes back to help defray the</p>
<p> cost of me exercising my choice to send my children to an independent</p>
<p> school. And the funding arrangements that we have, which don't</p>
<p> discriminate against government schools Â and the people who've</p>
<p> criticised our decisions on independent schools ignore the fact that</p>
<p> it's the States that provide most of the funding for government</p>
<p> schools. So these comparisons of Federal funding for government and</p>
<p> independent schools are quite misleading. What we have tried to do</p>
<p> is to give the maximum level of assistance in the private area to</p>
<p> the poorer schools. The so-called Âwealthy' schools Â</p>
<p> and I say wealthy in inverted commas Â their parents get far</p>
<p> less and those schools get far less than the poorer Catholic parish</p>
<p> schools which are amongst some of the more disadvantaged schools in</p>
<p> our community. I think you have to have choice but it's got to</p>
<p> cut both ways. And the 30 per cent of the community who educate their</p>
<p> children in independent schools argue that they pay their taxes and</p>
<p> they should get some of the cost of educating their children back</p>
<p> from the Government. It's only some. The maximum level of assistance</p>
<p> for the most needy schools still only amounts to 70 per cent of the</p>
<p> cost of educating a child in a government school from a federal level.</p>
<p> So there's still a portion, even in those very poor schools,</p>
<p> there is still a portion borne by the parent.</p>
<p>MILLER:</p>
<p>Jim, thank you for your question. Hello, Carol.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>Yes, I'm here.</p>
<p>MILLER:</p>
<p>Good morning, Carol. You have the Prime Minister.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>Good morning, Mr Howard. Good morning, Mr Miller.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Good morning.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>I would like to firstly say how proud I was of you last week greeting</p>
<p> our overseas visitors.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>You did very well. I was very proud. Now, I'm a self-funded retiree.</p>
<p> You did not mention us at all, Mr Howard, in your budget. I have scanned</p>
<p> everything that I can see. I will never be on an old age pension.</p>
<p> We feel that we fall between the gap. We have to pay our taxes. We</p>
<p> don't get any allowances for rates or electricity or phone or</p>
<p> any of those things. I have been in a health fund since I was 15 and</p>
<p> I am now 57. There is nothing there for us. I mean, there's still</p>
<p> provisional tax. I only earn $25,000 a year, which isn't a great</p>
<p> deal. Couldn't you not have made some provision for what you</p>
<p> call the aging population who are trying to not ask for anything very</p>
<p> much? I just felt, Mr Howard, there should have been a little bit</p>
<p> because I didn't see the word self-funded retiree mentioned at</p>
<p> all.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, the budget doesn't, of course, announce everything that</p>
<p> the Government does. We did Â and you mention you're in</p>
<p> a private health fund Â we did bring in a 30 per cent rebate</p>
<p> for private health insurance and that would no doubt have helped you</p>
<p> to the tune of 30 per cent of your premium. And that came in at the</p>
<p> beginning of last year. Once the appropriate age is reached all self-funded</p>
<p> retirees below a certain income level are entitled to get the benefit</p>
<p> of the seniors' card and it sounds to me as though your income</p>
<p> range would entitle you to that. Under the GST, of course, like all</p>
<p> other taxpayers, you will get a tax cut. You will enjoy the benefit</p>
<p> of the abolition of provisional tax. There will, at age 60, I have</p>
<p> to say, be a special one-off wealth or savings compensation payment</p>
<p> of up to $2000 for self-funded retirees. There will be some other</p>
<p> adjustments which probably won't affect you because they relate</p>
<p> to people who are part-pensioners in relation to the earnings limits.</p>
<p> So it's not accurate to say that self-funded retirees have been</p>
<p> ignored. We are very conscious that self-funded retirees are not as</p>
<p> enthusiastic about lower interest rates as people who are paying off</p>
<p> housing mortgages. I understand that. And that's one of the reasons</p>
<p> why we've taken a couple of decisions. We were very heavily influenced</p>
<p> on the decision on the health insurance rebate by the position of</p>
<p> older and retired Australians because of many of them have been loyal</p>
<p> members of health funds over a long period of time and felt, quite</p>
<p> understandably, that they hadn't got much in return. And that</p>
<p> particular measure, which has been of great benefit to a lot of people</p>
<p> over the age of 50 who've been in health funds for a long time,</p>
<p> will of course help them very significantly.</p>
<p>MILLER:</p>
<p>Okay, Carol, thank you for your call. Hello, Greg.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>Yeah, good morning, Prime Minister.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Good morning.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, I've just one quick question. Will the Federal</p>
<p> Government continue to review its resources that it is allocating</p>
<p> to fighting the drug problem, in particular, law enforcement because</p>
<p> it appears to me that some of the resources that your Government has</p>
<p> allocated over the last two years are beginning to show results?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, the answer is that we will keep on allocating a high level of</p>
<p> resources. We've now committed more than $500,000 to our ÂTough</p>
<p> on Drugs' strategy. And I announced the second part of that at</p>
<p> the Premiers' Conference and I got strong support from all of</p>
<p> the Premiers, Liberal and Labor alike. This is a non-political issue,</p>
<p> fighting the drug problem. We are putting more money into the Federal</p>
<p> Police. We're providing a lot more money for treatment. We're</p>
<p> going to introduce a new diversion scheme whereby people who have</p>
<p> a drug problem and who are apprehended by the police must be compulsorily</p>
<p> assessed and then offered a treatment course as an alternative to</p>
<p> being caught up in the criminal justice system. This has the support</p>
<p> of Mr Beattie. It has the support of Mr Carr and Mr Kennett. All of</p>
<p> the States think it's a good idea. But on top of that we continue</p>
<p> to pour resources into the Federal Police and Customs, a record level</p>
<p> at a national perspective. And we'll continue to work very closely</p>
<p> will all State governments. It's a terrible problem. It touches</p>
<p> the lives of thousands of Australians and we are concerned to work</p>
<p> with anybody of goodwill who wants to reduce the scourge of drugs.</p>
<p>MILLER:</p>
<p>Okay, thank you very much for that question. We can one more in. I</p>
<p> think we've only got about two minutes left and my apologies</p>
<p> to those who've been waiting on the line. Hello, John.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>Hello, yes. Good morning, Prime Minister.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Good morning, John.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>A quick one on private health insurance. I work in the private health</p>
<p> insurance industry as an independent adviser. One of the things we're</p>
<p> continually working at without a lot of success is to try to get companies,</p>
<p> corporations, etc, to provide health insurance for employees. The</p>
<p> main thing against that is fringe benefits tax.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes, Yes.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>Now, I don't see that the Government would suffer in any way</p>
<p> in removing fringe benefits tax from that because there's very</p>
<p> little of it coming through at the moment but it would bring a lot</p>
<p> more people into private health insurance if it was removed.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, John, we looked at this. We decided that the cost that would</p>
<p> be involved would be better used being put into the 30 per cent subsidy.</p>
<p> I know the argument but that subsidy is costing about $1.5 billion</p>
<p> to $1.7 billion a year. And we felt that we couldn't justify</p>
<p> putting even more money, over and above that, into private health</p>
<p> insurance given that we wanted to increase, which we have, the money</p>
<p> we've given to the States for public hospitals. Like schooling</p>
<p> this is an area where you've got to balance. You've got</p>
<p> to support the public system but you've also got to encourage</p>
<p> and subsidise choice in the private system and we made a decision.</p>
<p> So at this stage we don't think we can afford the additional</p>
<p> resources. And it would cost us a little more than you suggest but</p>
<p> it's</p>
