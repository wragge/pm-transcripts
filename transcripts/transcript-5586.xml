ANNUAL DINNER OF THE<br />
AUSTRALIAN LIBERAL STUDENTS' FEDERATION<br />
For more than a century, the Socialists have thought that<br />
history is on their side. Their view has been that nothing<br />
-" can-, top -ocialism-from-coming-in the end. . This9doctrine.--'<br />
is one of historical inevitability, a comforting doctrine<br />
to some kinds of people, and one that has assumed several<br />
fonrms.<br />
In Australia, the doctrine has, in the mainb assumed a<br />
comparatively non-ideological form, namely, that each<br />
Sodralistic policy put in place by a Labor government will<br />
-remain in place even after the electors have thrown Labor<br />
out of office at the next election. There has been a belief<br />
that-succeeding Liberal governments will not remove, but<br />
live with established Socialistic policies. So no matter how<br />
infrequently Labor holds office, Socialism is inevitable<br />
in the end by a silw _ proce-sof accretion.<br />
This version of historical inevitability portrays the<br />
advance of Socialism not as an irrestible swelling tide,<br />
but a sort-of slTow shuffle. There is little. idealism in.<br />
it, but it has at least been something for the Socialists<br />
in this country to cling to,<br />
From the time the Liberal Government came to office after<br />
the 1975 election, we-made it plain that we did -not regard<br />
existing Socialistic tyPe policies as sacrosanct. We expressed<br />
our clear determination-to-re-establish a more Liberal<br />
and more limited and less arrogant role for government in<br />
Australia. We have done this because we believe that if<br />
Australia is to meet the cfalteges-of--th-M ighties-and<br />
beyond, we cannot afford to sit back and accept unsatisfactory<br />
and inefficient arrangements which cause more problems than<br />
they solve, and whose costs outweigh-the-benefits.<br />
Never has our direction been made plainer than in our recent<br />
decisions arising out of the Review of Commonwealth Functions<br />
and in relation to hospital and medical arrangements in<br />
this country, and in the recent Premiers' Conference. There<br />
are major benefits which will flow to all Australians from<br />
a more realistic view of whart-government-can do. </p>
<p>2<br />
In announcing the Governiment's decisions arisin 4from the<br />
Review of Commonwealth Functions I' said that theyp were a<br />
Smajor contribution to.-the historic turnaround -tVA the_-,<br />
political oppo e~ uht:.<br />

-* Labor Party cannot make, up their minds whether hey.-<br />
should denounce our approach arid ur__ potiaiesa a--<br />
dismantling of government# or. whether they should-try<br />
to gain popular support for themselves by accus-i-ng us of<br />
not having gone. far enough.<br />
-Our turnaround is a move away from big government; away<br />
government ' that Labor gave this country between 11972-75., when<br />
the number of Commonwealth employees rose by 52,000<br />
( June 1.972 June 1975). We have brought itkA_~~ yjOO. QL. 0<br />
and the RCr will bring it down a further 16,000 or 17,000.<br />
under L~ abor the Governmen't's claims on the nationl's<br />
earnings rose from under 24% of GDP in 1972-73 to more than<br />
In 1975-76. We have cut this c17he~ Ta<br />
and we have further to go.<br />
We -don't--nt bi-g--govemment,--nor do the Austral-ian people.<br />
Only Labor wants it. And let me stress that big goverment<br />
is not caring government. It makes unemployment inevitable<br />
by undermkning pxL~ ateernterprisg, and it fosters inflation<br />
-and--cons equen t-ly sociiA-divisiveness, with so~ arj'g_ taxes......<br />
and large deficits.<br />
Limited governulefftWasafae-greater capacity to improve<br />
* care for those who need assist * ance. B~ y strengthening the<br />
eonomy, limited govetb1ment provides a foundation for.-<br />
generous ss&amp; eocu-ar i-ty_&amp; rranqaements. Those in lieed<br />
benefit-from more ef ficient government.. Over tbg-period<br />
of this Government, age pensions have reached higher levels<br />
in relation to average weekly earnings than at any time<br />
* in the last 25 years. And you will' 1 be aware-TTYat p edi-ttns**--<br />
have been made in income security payments as a result of<br />
the RCF~.<br />
A Liberal government does care about people, and the Liberal<br />
approach is based on the view that society has immense resources<br />
Sfor achiieving what people want-without the need for<br />
counterproductive intrusion by governments. These resources<br />
are the talents, the skills and the knowledge which people<br />
possess. Big government cramps these resources. </p>

It is often-said. that'-the West has faced a crisis in recent<br />
decades. I doubt that crisis propertiens.-were ever-reached..<br />
but -there certainly have been considerable uncertaintie~ i<br />
of both will and belief.' From the late fifties, through<br />
to the meid seventies, the West fail~ adto perceive the need<br />
for new policies, and by the time it did wake up..<br />
unemployment and inflation were both high and becoming<br />
entrenched. In those years, the distinction between caring<br />
government and big government was n5tTaT cle-atTf1 Jy asit<br />
should have been. The distinction between a protective<br />
-role for government and the omnipresence of government was<br />
Th6t-as clear as it should have been 42eople--thught--that-~-<br />
governments -were entitled to spend almost without. limit,<br />
and it was falsely imnagin~ ed that government money would<br />
__ avle human problems.<br />
The tradition of freedom -which says that the way to solve<br />
these problems, Is to encourage people to use their sk~ ills,<br />
tARnts and imaginations was subordinated to a reliance<br />
on government. Hardly anyone now fails to recognise that<br />
government had Ãµ kdwii'too much. " Our policies reassert that<br />
fr-eedom not paternalism and bureaucracy is the path<br />
to the way of life that most people want.<br />
Let me give a simple, but compelling, example of how<br />
freedom helps to solve social problems.. u-r--polici-ea-fise---<br />
that if government creates the right conditions for people<br />
to use their know16edqde, and express their own wants in themarketplace,<br />
the inevitable result is the-opening-U-pOf--<br />
n~ ew opportunities for others, including job opportunities,<br />
As a result, almost a quarter of a million additional jobs<br />
camne into existence in the two years to last December in the__<br />
private sector and the rate of unemployment is n~ wif ailing.<br />
In April it was the lowest rate for four-years. This<br />
achievement far exceeds what could have been achieved<br />
with government make -work-s cheme s which-a-malways7-tl e<br />
first resort of the Socialists and which could only have<br />
been paid for by higher taxes anyway. </p>

What point is there in the Commonweal~ th funding a curripuluhl<br />

the Commonwealth bureaucracy being involved with the running<br />
of piilie hospi'tals w in th-e States are both cboistitutionally<br />
responsible and very well able indeed to run public hospitats?<br />
There have been some differences of view about -the precise<br />
financial contribution which the Commonwealth BhOUld ' make to<br />
hospitals. But I have no doubt that a year or two down<br />
_ the track when these differences will seem like ancient___<br />
history, the States will value their independent capacity V<br />
to them.<br />
Over recent decades, and especially from 1972-15', the general<br />
*~ qdwtrofgove rnment -It-Au stralia was made worsee. by-an<br />
increasing centralism in Canberra. ideal lyfeedfra im.<br />
should operate to limit government. But in terms of power,<br />
the Commonwealth Government was the beneficiary of the<br />
centaliatin ad te-r of government in Australia. 4-<br />
Eve * n Sir Robert Menzie~ s, looking back f rom his r-etireme-nt,<br />
made the observation that while it was easy in theory to<br />
-favour limited power for the om nwata larger amount<br />
of ' pbwer Iinade3i. tC ~ ii<br />
of course, in a situation in which selfish'and divisive<br />
groups are extremely powerful, a weak Commonwelth Government<br />
would be a poor protector of individual rights and of the<br />
public interest. So what the Commonwealth needs is that<br />
measure of power which will enable it to discharge its<br />
own proper respan-sibil-it-ie----) ithtr-more nor less and<br />
this Governmenit will seek to retain no power in., excess of<br />
that.<br />
Labor has sometimes argued that government is relatively, small<br />
* and restrained in Australia, by comparison with ' other countries.<br />
International comparisons are always difficult because of<br />
inins titutt~ iwT and -I-ways of compiling statistics.<br />
Nor is there any obvious magic about the average or typical<br />
size of the public sector in other industrial countries. </p>

Japan? TW&amp; fo" i ea~ on re~ gniionin the Weat of the<br />
need for a turnaround is plain to see. Not only does<br />
limited government fnean more effective and -less intrusive.<br />
governmfent, it also means higher economicrowth,_ higher<br />
real incomes, more job lower taxes, more nfluenceto<br />
ordinary* Jieople'a's usersasid consumers, anrd a greater,<br />
adaptability in our society to change.<br />
There are also very real advantages in freeing resources<br />
and opening opportunities for current priorities. We are<br />
no longer so locked into programes an4-zztiviti-C.-Wihich<br />
once had an importance they no longer have. We can<br />
devote -resources much more-adequateoly'to areas we believe<br />
are of major current importance.<br />
Let me mention energy research as an example. A re-location<br />
existing resources. -in the Australian Atomic Energy<br />
Comi~ jion -Research Establishment and in the -C* SIRQ will<br />
e&amp; na~ le the Government-to establish. a new institute of<br />
energy-and earth resources in the CSIRO.<br />
The establishment of this institute is a recognition<br />
of the higli. p~ ri6-ty the Government believes must be given<br />
to endxgy research.-These -decisions, will consolidate<br />
Australia's pres~ ent nuclear regearch establishment into<br />
a f irst class nuclear science and technology research<br />
organfisation and establ-ish a first class non-nuclear<br />
research Organisation.<br />
The rezources transferred to CSIRO will enable expansion<br />
of research in such areas as fossil fuels, mi1nng of energy<br />
re-sources,. alternative f uels and renewable energy andenergy.<br />
-conserv-ation.<br />
Because limited government compels greater awareness of<br />
priorities, it is more effective goverrnment and government<br />
better geared to enable Australia to take up the challengeB<br />
and opportunities before us. We pioneered more limited_<br />
government through the second half of the 1.970s. It has<br />
been a hard path calling for a degree of determination,<br />
and for a sustained resistance to demands for government<br />
spending but other countries are now trying to follow us.<br />
