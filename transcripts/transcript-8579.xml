STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
The Prime Minister has sent the following message to His Holiness, Pope John Paul II:<br />
It is with deep concern and regret that I have learnt of your illness and the need to be<br />
hospitalised. That concern is shared by the Government and people of Australia.<br />
You can be assured of the prayers and support of the people of Australia for a speedy<br />
recovery to good health. You are much loved and admired in this country by Catholics<br />
and non-Catholics alike and our wish is for your health and strength to be restored as<br />
quickly as possible.<br />
CANBERRA July 1992 </p>
