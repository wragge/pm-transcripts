    <content><![CDATA[<p>I am pleased to announce with Prime Minister Aso of Japan the Commissioners who will serve on the International Commission on Nuclear Non-proliferation and Disarmament, along with Co-chairs former Australian Foreign Minister Gareth Evans and former Japanese Foreign Minister Yoriko Kawaguchi. </p>
<p>These eminent and outstanding individuals from around the world  -  including former heads of state and ministers, military strategists and disarmament experts  -  are uniquely placed to bring fresh and imaginative vision to this important undertaking.  A list of the Commissioners is attached.</p>
<p>The first meeting of the Commission, hosted by the Australian Government, will be held in Sydney from 19-21 October.</p>
<p>The Commission's two year mandate is to reinvigorate the global debate on the need to prevent the further spread of nuclear weapons and for nuclear disarmament, and to strengthen the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) by seeking to shape a global consensus in the lead up to the 2010 NPT Review Conference, and beyond.  The NPT is the most significant and successful arms control instrument of the nuclear age.  While remaining the cornerstone of global disarmament efforts, the NPT is facing increased pressure and strain from the actions of countries such as North Korea and Iran. </p>
<p>The Commission's work will not, however, be limited to the fundamentally important task of reinvigorating the NPT.  It will also be looking at ways in which the non-NPT nuclear armed states can be brought into the global non-proliferation and disarmament system.  The Commission will also address the important issue of ensuring that any expanded use of civil nuclear energy due to climate change and energy security concerns does not result in an associated increase in proliferation risks.</p>
<p>These are goals that Australia and Japan both share, as key partners working together with other like-minded countries to advance the goals of both nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation.</p>
<p>I look forward to working with Japan, and with Ms Kawaguchi and Mr Evans, together with their fellow Commissioners, in taking forward this very important initiative.</p>
