PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 14 DECEMBER 1986<br />
I will visit major Asian countries from 29 January to 13<br />
February next year the Republic of Korea, Thailand,<br />
Pakistan and India.<br />
The Republic of Korea has an outstanding record of economic<br />
growth in recent years and has become one of Australia's<br />
most important trading partners. President Roh Tae-Woo was<br />
a welcome visitor to Canberra in November during his first<br />
overseas state visit. My return ' visit will allow me to<br />
continue discussions and to observe at first hand the<br />
positive political developments in that country.<br />
Australia values its close relations with Thailand, which is<br />
undergoing remarkably rapid economic growth. our two<br />
countries have co-operated on issues of bilateral and<br />
regional importance including Indo-China, refugees,<br />
narcotics, economic development and trade issues. I look<br />
forward to meeting my new counterpart, Prime Minister<br />
Chatichai, and to discussing the full range of issues with<br />
him.<br />
my visit to Pakistan will allow me to meet Prime Minister<br />
Benazir Bhutto and will reinforce international support for<br />
Pakistan's welcome return to democratic civilian rule. This<br />
will be the first visit to Pakistan by an Australian Prime<br />
Minister since 1975, when Prime Minister Bhutto's father<br />
hosted a visit by Mr Whitlam.<br />
India and Australia have always enjoyed close relations.<br />
our membership of the Commonwealth, our interests in the<br />
Indian Ocean region, and our mutual concern over<br />
international issues such as South Africa have seen our two<br />
countries working closely together in the international<br />
arena. I welcome this opportunity to v~ isit the world's<br />
largest democracy and to continue valuable dialogue with<br />
Prime Minister Gandhi, who visited Australia in 1986 and<br />
whom I have enjoyed meeting on many other occasions. My<br />
visit will also provide an invaluable opportunity to<br />
reinforce further the economic and trading links between our<br />
two countries. </p>
