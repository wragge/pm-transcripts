HON.<br />SIR ROBERT K. NZIES, OVER ABC NATIONAL STATIONS<br />AT 7.15 PM 0 THURSDaY, NOVE113" R 21ST, 1963</p>
<p><br />Our housing policy has been very successful,Â Of all the dwellings in Australia today, no less than 36% oÂ have been built during our term of office, i. e. since 19Â But there are two special problems.</p>
<p><br />The first concerns young married people up toÂ years of age. They save up for a deposit on a home; butÂ they find it difficult. Yet homes are the very foundationÂ <br />of tie nation. ' ell, our proposal is this. Somebody in this<br />age group decides to save for a home. He, or she, makes<br />deposits in some identifiable account at an approved institution,<br />e. g. a Trading Bank, a Savings Bank, a Building Society, or<br />whatever the institution may be. Jhen, in that account, there<br />shall have been deposited, over a period of at least three<br />years, a total of Å 750, we liill, by subsidy, make that Å lO00<br />Maximum subsidy for one house Z250 Rate of subsidy Å 1<br />for Å 600 saved; subsidy Å 200.<br />In the purchase of non-State houses costing up<br />to Å 7000 for house and land, this will be of tremendous value.<br />The second problem concerns those who can find<br />the deposit, but, not being able to borrow the whole of the<br />rest on first mortgage, are compelled very frequently to fill<br />the gap at exorbitant rates of interest. This large group<br />includes many who -Jant a somewhat better or different house.<br />Nobody wants to see a uniformity of houses carried to a<br />depressing extent. To meet this problem, we will establish a National<br />Housing Insurance Corporation, to insure the repayment of<br />housing loans made by approved lenders at approved and<br />reasonable rates of interest. This will be a flexible scheme,<br />designed to help the borrower according to his income. Thus,<br />suppose an intending home buyer or builder has a taxable income<br />of Å 1500 a year. He should be able to borrow, say, Å 4500 ( or<br />three years income) and to borrow it up to a high percentage<br />of valuation, up to 95% in appropriate cases.<br />These two plans, when they go into operation early<br />in the new Parliament, will greatly encourage and assist home<br />ownership, both for the young and younger married and for the<br />many thousands of others.<br />It has been and is our policy to create a homeowning<br />democracy. It may have escaped your notice that,<br />lorgely assisted by our own policies, the position today<br />is that 76% of all Australian homes are owned, or in process<br />of becoming owned, by the occupiers.<br />I doubt "+ rhether this record can be approached by<br />any other country in the world. As I have shown, we intend to<br />improve on it. Before I conclude, could I nail once again the<br />silly statement that the Government is slowing down. So<br />foolish is this story that I have only to make one more<br />reference to housing. The current rate of housing construction<br />in Australia, in the fourteenth year of our office, is 100,000Â dwellings a year. This is a record. If I please theÂ statisticians by ttaking the average population of a home<br />as 3M persons, ( or should I, as a grandfather of twins,<br />say 47) the effect is that at the present rate 350,000<br />persons are going into newly built homes every year!</p>
<p><br />This isas good a testimonial as I, for one,<br />would wish to take with me if you decided to dismiss us<br />on polling day.</p>
