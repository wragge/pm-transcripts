PRIME MINISTER May 1974<br />
OFFER OF ASSISTANCE TO QUEENSLAND FOR<br />
HOUSING RESTORATION WORK<br />
The Prime Minister said today that he was concerned<br />
over reports of delays being experienced by the Queensland<br />
authorities in obtaining tenders for housing restoration works<br />
approved under the flood relief arrangements between the Queensland<br />
and Australian Governments.<br />
The Australian Government, therefore, had offered the<br />
Queensland Government assistance, by way of an Australian Government<br />
volunteer work force of some 70 employees, to assist with flood<br />
restoration work. The Prime Minister added that the volunteers<br />
cbver the full range of building tradesmen and would be provided<br />
by the Australian Department of Housing and Construction for a<br />
period of at least three months. The work to be undertaken by<br />
this team was likely to comprise restoration of houses in particular<br />
defined areas in the Brisbane metropolitan area or possibly in the<br />
City of Ipswich. The Prime Minister said that if this offer is acceptable<br />
to the Queensland Government then the appropriate arrangements<br />
would be decided between officers of the two Governments quickly<br />
in order that work could be commenced as soon as possible.<br />
