EMBARGO: 6.00 P. m.<br />
PRESS STATEMENT NO. 33<br />
12 January 1973<br />
INQUIRY INTO PROPOSED INCREASE IN STEEL PRICES<br />
In its election policy speech, the Government promised to<br />
establish prices justification machinery. The initial and timeconsuming<br />
work necessary to give practical effect to this promise<br />
is being undertaken as a matter of the utmost priority, by my<br />
colleagues the Treasurer and the Attorney-General. The Government<br />
aims to introduce enabling legislation into the Parliament very<br />
early in the coming session.<br />
Pending the establishment of that machinery, it is obviously<br />
impracticable for the Government to conduct any widespread<br />
examination of price increases which may be proposed. There are,<br />
however, some products which are clearly of such basic impor'. LtLce<br />
that increases in their prices ramify widely and can have majoi:<br />
consequences for the whole economy. Steel is a case in poia;..<br />
The Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd., on behalf of it. 501if<br />
and its subsidiary company Australian Iron and Steel Pty. LtK,'. 0<br />
has requested that their case for proposed increases in the drice<br />
of steel should be examined. It has been decided to accede tCo<br />
that request. The Government is pleased that the nation's largest<br />
corporation has not only thus expressed its willingness to<br />
co-operate fully in the achievement of our objectives and policies<br />
in this area, but has taken the initiative to do so. We welcome<br />
this co-operative approach to a problem which affects us all.<br />
Had the prices justification machinery already been in<br />
operatibin,, this request by The Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd.<br />
and Australian Iron and Steel Pty. Ltd. would, of course, have<br />
been dealt with by referral to that body. Since it will be<br />
some time before permanent machinery can be established, we<br />
propose to take action of an interim kind, by means of a special<br />
Inquiry, to examine the proposed increases in the price of steel..<br />
Neither the method of operation of this Inquiry, nor its<br />
conclusions, are to be rcgarded as prejudicing those of the<br />
permanent body in its investigations of price increases, whether<br />
of steel or of any other cormmodity. </p>
<p>Mr. Justice Moore, Acting President of the Commonwealth<br />
Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, has consented to conduc.<br />
an Inquiry into the Companies' proposals. Mr. Justice Moore is<br />
Senior Deputy President of the Comnission to which he was<br />
appointed. in 1959.<br />
The terms of reference of the Inquiry are set out in my<br />
letter to Mr. Justice Moore. The text of my letter is attached.<br />
In deciding to establish this Inquiry, the Government takes<br />
the view that large corporations have responsibilities not only<br />
to their shareholders and to their employees, but to the nation<br />
as a whole. The terms of reference also recognise the economic<br />
reality that continually rising costs present large problems for<br />
industry if it is to remain economically viable and continue to<br />
grow and develop as in the national interest it should.<br />
Nevertheless, the Inquiry is nriot limited to those aspects, and<br />
Mr. Justice Moore has been given wide discretion to conduct it<br />
in such a manner and on such basis as he thinks fit.<br />
Mr. Justice Moore has been asked to report as soon as<br />
practicable, hopefully by about the end of January.<br />
