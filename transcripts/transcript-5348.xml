FOE PRIME MINISTER I IRAry<br />
~ MEDIA FRIDAY, 9 MAY, 198,"~<br />
VISIT TO HOBART BY ANTARCTIC CONVENTION DELEGAT~ z~<br />
Delegates to the International Conference on the<br />
Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources,<br />
currently meeting in Canberra, will travel to Hobart<br />
this weekend by RAAF ( VIP) aircraft. The delegation<br />
will travel with Mr. Newman, the Minister Assisting the<br />
Prime Minister in Federal Affairs, who will lead their<br />
visit to Hobart.<br />
The visit has been arranged as a result of the strong<br />
-representations I have received from Federal Government<br />
1* embers and Senators in Tasmania, to ensure that the<br />
permanent headquarters of the proposed International<br />
Conservation Commission for Antarctic Marine-Living<br />
Resources will be established in Hobart..<br />
Such a move has been strongly advanced by the Australian<br />
delegation at the Conference in Canberra, and also through<br />
informal diplomatic contacts over a long period....<br />
These continuing Australian moves to secure-. Hobart's<br />
selection by the international delegates as the site<br />
0of the headquarters, are an extension of previous.<br />
Commonwealth initiatives to ensure Tasmania's<br />
. pre-eminence in fields relating to Antarctic and-.<br />
marine matters.<br />
Senior delegates from the fifteen nations taking part in the.<br />
Conference will have an opportunity to see for themselves<br />
the significance of the initiatives undertaken by the<br />
Commonwealth Government to strengthen Tasmania's position<br />
in these fields. These have included establishment of the<br />
Australian Maritime College in Launceston, transfer to<br />
Hobart of the Antarctic Division of the Department of<br />
Science and the Environment, and most recently, the<br />
Government's decision to establish a Marine Science Centre<br />
in Hobart including the transfer of the CSIRO division of<br />
Fisheries and Oceanography. These actions are a part of<br />
the Commonwealth's positive response to the report by<br />
Sir Bede Callaghan on the structure of industry and the<br />
employment situation in Tasmania.<br />
The Commonwealth's support for the visit is a reflection of<br />
the importance the Government attaches to the representations<br />
I have received in support of Hobart as the preferred site<br />
for the Conservation Commission headquarters.<br />
