FOR PRESS 17 AUGUST 1977<br />
THE 1977-78 BUDGET<br />
The 1977-78 Budget underlines the Government's philosophy,<br />
and its resolute approach to the tasks of economic and social<br />
rehabilitation to which it is committed. It is a Budget of<br />
responsibility and imagination, of achievement and<br />
promise, of challenge and opportunity.<br />
Whilst maintaining the attack on inflation, this Budget recognises<br />
that the restoration of prosperity and the creation of more<br />
jobs requires above all a resurgence of the confidence of<br />
Australians in their future and in the future o: E Australia.<br />
The Government believes that the new and simplified personal<br />
taxation arrangements provide, in the most positive and<br />
dramatic fashion, the opportunity for this resurgence<br />
of confidence.<br />
Reductions in personal tax within a responsible budgetary framework<br />
have been made possible by a continuing firm hand on Government<br />
expenditure. As a result of rigorous restraint in order to avoid<br />
unnecessaryor less essential spending, we have been able to<br />
achieve our objective of containing total expenditure within a<br />
" izero real growth" target. Yet we have again provided for large<br />
increases in payments to State and local government;<br />
we have maintained the vital social reforms introduced last year<br />
notably the greatly improved arrangments for assistance to<br />
families by family allowances and the full and automatic<br />
adjustment of pensions and benefits for inflation; and we are<br />
giving top priority to programmes for relieving unemployment,<br />
especially among the young.<br />
The tax reductions which firm control of Government spending have<br />
made possible mean that, within six months, there will be<br />
larger pay packets for all; from then on, the marginal<br />
" tax bite" for 90 percent of taxpayers will in no case exceed<br />
32 cents in the dollar.<br />
By this single decisive stroke of policy, the Government is able<br />
to provide all Australians with the assurance that endeavour will<br />
be encouraged, that skills will be worth acquiring, that<br />
initiatives will be worth taking and that effort will be fairly<br />
rewarded. The Government believes that most people want greater freedom<br />
to make their own decisions about working, spending and saving. / 2 </p>
<p>2.<br />
They do not want their decisions to be warped by crippling<br />
taxation. That is why we promised to reform the personal tax<br />
system. It is a matter of great satisfaction to us that firm<br />
and steady policies have enabled us to take this major step<br />
towards restoring incentives and getting Australia on the move.<br />
The Government is confident that Australians will respond to<br />
the challenge and that the revival in spirit will begin today. </p>
