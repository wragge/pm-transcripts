All of us were saddened to learn of the death of Norman Makin<br />
on 20 July. Norman Makin served Australia in a large number of<br />
capacities with great distinction. In his maiden speech in this<br />
House in March 1920, Mr Makin spoke of his intention to<br />
further the interests of the country and to further its general<br />
prosperity and progress. He worked to this end in and out<br />
of the Commonwealth Parliament with distinction for the next<br />
62 years. In his last speech in this place in October 1963,<br />
he returned to that same theme of the need to build up<br />
Australia, saying that the Australian people had the capacity<br />
anid courage to continue to build up their country.<br />
Norman Makin was born on 31 March 1889 at Petersham in New<br />
South Wales. He was educated at the Central Public School<br />
in Broken Hill and in 1918 was elected President of the<br />
South Australian branch of the Australian Labor Party and was<br />
first elected as a Member of the House of Representatives<br />
for Hindxnarsh in 1919. When Mr Scullin became Prime Minister<br />
in 1929, Norman Makin was elected Speaker of this House.<br />
As Speaker he was committed to this institution and was well<br />
respected by all who came into contact with him. Norman Makin<br />
also served with distinction on a number of committees of<br />
this House.<br />
From 1922 to 1925, he was a member of the Commonwealth delegation<br />
to the . Empire Parliamentary Association in the ' United Kingdom<br />
and, in 1937, he was a member of the delegation which again<br />
visited that country for the coronation of Ki ng VI. Norman<br />
Makin was also a member of the Standing orders Committee<br />
