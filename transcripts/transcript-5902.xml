    <content><![CDATA[<p>3 September 1982Â </p>
<p>It is a wonderful evening and thank you for asking somebodyÂ  from south of the border to share a part of it with you.Â  It is a great occasion and 25 years in coalition is somethingÂ  to remember. The people who have to run coalitions get goodÂ  of experience in making it work and making it work smoothlyÂ  and it is up to both sides to make that possible. But thoseÂ  who have to run coalitions get a lot of advice sometimes fromÂ  people who have never run a coalition in their lives and if theÂ  advice is good that is fair enough, but if the advice is badÂ  you have to reject it and sometimes people don't like havingÂ  their advice rejected, but they haven't had the experienceÂ  and they don't know what has to be done. For my part let meÂ  say that I am the luckiest Prime Minister that ever was withÂ  Doug Anthony as my lieutenant. We watch and learn from whatÂ  happens from north of the border but it is important for theÂ  good Government of Queensland and the good Government of theÂ  Commonwealth because without a coalition in Queensland theÂ  socialists would be in town and without a coalition. in CanberraÂ  the socialists would be in power and I do not think any of usÂ  intend to let that happen.</p>
<p>I want apologise for Tamie, she wanted to be here very muchÂ  tonight but we still have one school-aged kid and there areÂ  family obligations so she had to go back early this morning.Â  We have had a day or two at Burketown, and if I had knownÂ  you needed something to eat tonight I could easily have gotÂ  up a little earlier and caught more fish, I thought I onlyÂ  had to feed myself for breakfast. They had a dinner with perhapsÂ  a few more people than are here tonight, but they were not allÂ  Queenslanders, they had come from Murray Bridge from Victoria,Â  they had come from New South Wales and -elsewhere. They hadÂ  a few speeches and somebody got up to make a speech and I doÂ  not know why but he went back to 1941 and the Brisbane Line.Â  He said he did not like the business about giving away AustraliaÂ  north of the Brisbane Line, he thought that what they ought toÂ  plan to do is exactly what the Premier has been doing the lastÂ  few years give away the country to the south.</p>
<p>The Premier rang me up two or three weeks ago at the earlyÂ  stages before the strike really became serious and he said:Â  " Malcolm, if I go into bat on this 38-hours, you are not goingÂ  to offer them all 36-hours or something like that are you?"Â  I said: " no Joh, don't worry about that." He said: " we haveÂ  knocked off compulsory unions for public servants", I said: " good",Â  he said: " well what are you going to do?" I said: " well, we neverÂ  had it". Then he said: " well, we are not going to collect union dues anymore, will you follow us in that?", I said: " weÂ  stopped collecting union dues four years ago, I am glad youÂ  are with us." He said: " Malcolm, you might think you areÂ  ahead, but you wait a couple of days.â We all know what happened.</p>
<p>This Coalition won in 1957 with the biggest swing againstÂ  any government that has ever happened in the history ofÂ  Australia and that says something about the Labor Party thatÂ  was in before and the point has been made that the LaborÂ  Party hasn't changed that much. They get a bit more extreme,Â  they go a bit further to the left and they certainly would destroyÂ  what has been built up if they had an opportunity to do so.Â  A great deal has been achieved in Queensland but I do notÂ  take a great deal of pleasure from the fact that while 98% of itÂ  is entirely due to Queensland and Queensland policies there isÂ  a growing proportion of it that is going to be entirely theÂ  responsibility of New South Wales and Victoria and the policiesÂ  that the socialists in those two places are pursuing. You wereÂ  nearly getting about $ 1 billion a week out of Mr Cain with hisÂ  probate duty that he was going to put back on, and there are people caningÂ  here all the timre because the y do not like the sortsi of policiesÂ  that are being pursued in those two states. That of course makesÂ  it so much easier but nevertheless, what has been done has beenÂ  remarkable.</p>
<p>We do need to take note of the fact that the new Victorian Government is the most ideological committed government in the wholeÂ  history of Australia. He might go about it a bit more skilfullyÂ  as Mr Whitlam did, not making quite as much noise in theÂ  way he sought to undermine our arrangements with the UnitedÂ  States and our defence treaties, the way Mr Cain is seeking toÂ  apply the ideology of the socialist left in my own state isÂ  something which gives us all a good deal of concern. There areÂ  things that happen in the Labor Party which we often donât botherÂ  to point out. In their recent conferences they committedÂ  themselves clearly and firmly to turning Australia into aÂ  republic and in their last conference they committed themselvesÂ  to tearing up the Australian Flag and tearing up the AustralianÂ  constitution. Why shouldn't we point these things out more oftenÂ  than we do?</p>
<p>There are some odd things about the Labor Party also, there hasÂ  been a lot written about Mr Costigan over the last few days.Â  People seem to have forgotten that Mr Costigan was originallyÂ  appointed to inquire into a union, the Painters and DockersÂ  Union, and I thought I might just read out a few things aboutÂ  this Union because it has some peculiar characteristics andÂ  relationships. In Victoria the Union is under the controlÂ  of hardened criminals the Royal Commissioner says. There has beenÂ  some 15 murders that took place between 1970 and 1979.. The twoÂ  worst years were 1971 where three murders took place, and 1979Â  when four took place. Federal Secretary Gordon told the SweeneyÂ  Royal Commission: " we catch and kill our own". That apparentlyÂ  is exactlywhat the union does. Their answer to any interferenceÂ  into their activities is not to use the processes of the lawÂ  but rather, threats, violence and intimidation. In this way theÂ  Royal Commissioner says: " the painters and dockers have assumedÂ  for themselves a position outside the law and have maintainedÂ  that " position by violence</p>
<p>If there was anyone or any organisation associated with theÂ  National Party or the Liberal Party that had that record IÂ  haven't the slightest doubt that we would be moving toÂ  disaffiliate them, get rid of them, kick them out so fast itÂ  would be nobody's business. But what does Senator Georges do?Â  He just says they are misunderstood. In Victoria of course, andÂ  in other states they are affiliated with the Labor Party, theyÂ  send their representatives along to the policy making bodyÂ  of the Party and they are some of the people who control theÂ  Labor politicians. It is going to be interesting to see ifÂ  Mr Hayden or Mr Cain or any of the others try and clean upÂ  their own business.</p>
<p>Victoria is also becoming a refuge for tired, worn out LaborÂ  politicians. Joh, you seemed to indicate a bit of sympathyÂ  for Mr Casey up here, I hope you don't get too sympatheticÂ  for him. Mr Cain has given Mr Dunstan a job, I am told he isÂ  going to give Mr Grassby a job, if you want to get rid ofÂ  S Mr Casey he would probably give him a job too, and-whenÂ  Mr Wran is kicked out of New South Wales I suppose he willÂ  give him a job and there is no way that New South WelshmenÂ  would buy him again, after the way he has wrecked the state.</p>
<p>We are going to try and get rid of Mr Cain in Victoria in theÂ  next election but our own Opposition there has to work vigorouslyÂ  and hard. There is one fallacy that Parties sometimes have. IfÂ  you have been in for a'long time, give the poor OppositionÂ  a go for three years and brighten ourselves up. We have learntÂ  before that three years can be a long time and an enormousÂ  amount of damage can be done and that has been demonstratedÂ  again in Victoria. If you are having any doubts about the directionsÂ  you are pursuing just visit Sydney or Melbourne a little more oftenÂ  and that is going to be just as good as visiting overseas andÂ  then you will know that Queensland is the best place in the world.Â  The sense of direction that everyone seems to have in this stateÂ  Sis refreshing and whether it is Burketown, Brisbane or Townsville,Â  the sense of direction and purpose, the sense of believing inÂ  free enterprise, because it is a way of life, is something that isÂ  good to see.</p>
<p>Joh and Llew I would like to congratulate you both on the firstÂ  years. There is another 25 year dinner in Lismore in aÂ  few weeks time. I do not know if any of you have been invitedÂ  to that, but if you haven't been invited, it is Doug Anthony'sÂ  years in Parliament and he has asked me to go along,. so I askÂ  all of you to come along as well.</p>
<p>Thank you for asking me to be a part of this evening. It is aÂ  memorable time in the history of Queensland and the history of aÂ  great State. The achievements that you have worked hard for overÂ  the years r1OW are evident, it can be seen on all sides, and theÂ  State is going from strength to strength. On this occasion IÂ  am am prepared to say that it is totally the result of StateÂ  policies, when we get around to a federal election, I will beÂ  claiming some part of that responsibility from our own policies.Â  At the moment it is all yours, and thank you for allowing me toÂ  be a part of it.</p>
