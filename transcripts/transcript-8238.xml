PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 20 DECEMBER 1990<br />
The appointment of the present Ombudsman, Professor Dennis<br />
Pearce, expires on 31 January 1991.<br />
Professor Pearce has advised the Government that he wishes<br />
to return to the Australian National University after 3<br />
years in the Ombudsman post.<br />
On behalf of the Government, I express appreciation for the<br />
substantial contribution Professor Pearce has made in his<br />
term as Ombudsman and wish him well in his future career.<br />
The Government will be recommending to the Governor-General<br />
the appointment of Mr Alan Cameron as Commonwealth Ombudsman<br />
from 1 April 1991.<br />
Mr Cameron is presently National Executive Partner for the<br />
large firm of solicitors Blake Dawson Waldron and has had a<br />
very successful career in private practice.<br />
He has a long-standing interest in public policy issues and<br />
has for the past five years been a judicial member of the<br />
New South Wales Equal Opportunity Tribunal.<br />
During his varied career he has held the position of<br />
Principal Solicitor with the Aboriginal Legal Service of New<br />
South Wales, acted as a consultant to the Australian Law<br />
Reform Commission, and taught law in Indonesia.<br />
He is a solicitor of the Supreme Court of New South Wales,<br />
and a barrister and solicitor of the Supreme Courts of the<br />
Australian Capital Territory, Western Australia and<br />
Victoria. In the period between the departure of Professor Pearce and<br />
