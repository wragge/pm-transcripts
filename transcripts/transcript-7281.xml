CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
BICENTENARY TEST MATCH DINNER<br />
SYDNEY 2 FEBRUARY 1988<br />
When the first English team to tour Australia returned home<br />
in 1862, Roger Iddison of Yorkshire was asked his opinion of<br />
Australian cricketers. He replied ( and perhaps Michael<br />
Parkinson, Geoff Boycott or Bob Appleyard could correct my<br />
pronunciation): " Well, I doan't think mooch of their play,<br />
but they're a woonderful lot of drinking men".<br />
Over the next 130 years, Iddison's analysis turned out to be<br />
half right at any rate.<br />
In Australia's 200 years of European settlement, cricket<br />
and, particularly, cricket against the Poms has played a<br />
major role in our social life and history. The enormous<br />
public interest shown by the thousands who attended the<br />
Bicentenary Test and the millions who watched and listened<br />
on television and radio is proof of the continuing vitality<br />
of a great tradition of friendly but intense competition<br />
between our two countries.<br />
It was a wonderful idea to arrange the match as a part of<br />
the Bicentennial and to bring together so many great<br />
cricketers spanning the generations from Don Bradman and<br />
Bill O'Reilly those great rivals from the Southern<br />
Highlands of New South Wales to Ian Botham, the new star<br />
of our Sheffield Shield. I congratulate Alan Crompton and<br />
Bob Radford and their colleagues on the Bicentennial Test<br />
Match Organising Committee for their great efforts, and the<br />
ACB, the TCCB, the MCG, the Australian Bicentennial<br />
Authority, the NSW Bicentennial Committee, Benson Hedges<br />
and all others who have been involved.<br />
It is also a matter of great pleasure that the Ashes, which<br />
originated a mile or two from the SCG at Woollahra, have<br />
returned to Australia for the first time since they left<br />
here in 1883 with the Honourable Ivo Bligh's team. I note<br />
incidentally that, according to Jack Pollard's biblical<br />
' Australian Cricket', " some experts have argued that as the<br />
series against Bligh ended 2-2 the Ashes should have<br />
remained in Australia, but Bligh took them home in his<br />
luggage This shows that you should never trust anybody<br />
called the Honourable or Bligh, for that matter. 004248 </p>
<p>. I<br />
One of cricket's unique and great qualities is the<br />
literature, history and legend which surround it. The<br />
detail of all the Test matches between Australia and England<br />
has been lovingly recorded and I have taken the opportunity<br />
to refresh my memory about it, in view of the special<br />
significance of tonight's occasion. Radio and television<br />
have played an enormous part in documenting the game and<br />
bringing it to life for those not actually there. But we<br />
depend enormously on the written word. In the Oval Test of<br />
1882, which gave birth to the Ashes legend, England, needing<br />
to win, collapsed from 4 for 65 to be all out for 77.<br />
C. P. Moody describes the last over as follows:<br />
" Now Boyle's pertinacious accuracy was rewarded. Off<br />
the first ball of his over Barnes was caught off the<br />
glove by Murdoch at point. Edmund Peate, last man in,<br />
swished the first ball to leg for two, flukily played<br />
the next one, tried to hit the last ball of the over,<br />
but missed, and it bowled him. The game was won by<br />
seven runs."<br />
Cricket is surely the one sport where something as<br />
apparently insignificant as the three balls faced by a<br />
No. 11 batsman 106 years ago have been meticulously<br />
described and will be remembered in detail for all time.<br />
The unfortunate Peate's answer to the criticism of him for<br />
not giving his partner, C. T. Studd, an established batsman<br />
with centuries against the Australians earlier in the tour,<br />
the chance to farm the bowling, will also stand for all<br />
time: " Mr Studd was so nervous I did not feel I could trust<br />
him to score the runs."<br />
There is a bit of a tendency nowadays to make unfavourable<br />
comparisons of today's game and its atmospherics with those<br />
of some imaginary Arcadian period in the past. For example,<br />
I've seen the odd reference in the media to crowd behaviour.<br />
But it was in 1879 that the spectators rushed the ground<br />
after a couple of unpopular umpiring decisions in favour of<br />
Lord Harris's team against New South Wales. The day's play<br />
had to be called off.<br />
And in 1873-74 in Sydney, during W. G. Grace's tour, a NSW<br />
batsman was persuaded in the pavilion that he had been<br />
unfairly given out, and returned to continue batting. With<br />
three batsmen at the crease, W. G. took his men from the<br />
field until sanity prevailed and the dismissed batsman<br />
departed. I don't think anything like this happened in<br />
Pakistan. 004249 </p>
<p>while on the subject of cricket history let us not forget<br />
that the first Australian team to tour England was the<br />
Aboriginal team of 1868. The re-issue of John Mulvaney's<br />
and Rex Harcourt's account of that event, and the<br />
forthcoming tour of England by John McGuire's Aboriginal<br />
team, which I am delighted to see has the support of<br />
Colin Moynihan, the British Minister for Sport, have helped<br />
to focus greater attention on the outstanding achievements<br />
of the men of 1868 and to give them the place in our history<br />
which is rightly theirs. It is clear, for example, that<br />
Johnny Mullagh from that side was a class player by any<br />
standards and one of the outstanding Australian cricketers<br />
to tour England.<br />
Some of you will know that I recently had the honour of<br />
captaining a side against the 1988 Aboriginal team at Manly.<br />
In that match one of the living legends here, R. marsh,<br />
broke a window in a house opposite the ground while<br />
batting, I hasten to add. Notwithstanding the inspiration I<br />
received in travelling from Kirribilli to Manly along<br />
Murdoch Street, Bannerman Street and Spofforth Street, my<br />
own contribution was, in the words of a discerning 8 year<br />
old spectator, " a solid duck, Mr Hawke".<br />
AS I laboured vainly to get bat on ball, this innings of<br />
mine seemed to take an unconscionable amount of time. But<br />
these things are relative. And the proper perspective was<br />
put on them in the Sydney morning Herald last week by Keith<br />
Dunstan. In a vicious attack on my profession or should<br />
it be called an art? Keith wrote:<br />
" Surely the supreme agony of the 20th century is the<br />
broadcast of Parliament. Half the time our national<br />
leaders are indulging in mutual vilification in terms<br />
that you wouldn't want your children to hear.<br />
Other times you get a session when they have gone into<br />
committee and they are discussing a water drainage bill<br />
or new rules for superphosphate, clause by clause by<br />
clause. It is the slowest human activity on earth<br />
beating those days when the English batsman Trevor<br />
Bailey used to manage two or three hours without scoring<br />
a run."<br />
I was delighted to see Trevor, another living legend, and an<br />
outstanding cricket broadcaster, get a guernsey in the week<br />
of the Bicentenary Test, even one as unflattering as this.<br />
There are great cricketing names here tonight, and I will<br />
have a few words to say about them in a moment. Let me<br />
briefly refer to the great figures of Australian and English<br />
cricketers who have passed on. 004250 </p>
<p>4.<br />
To pick a few names at random batsmen like victor Trumper;<br />
Clem Hill; Warren Bardsley; Charlie Macartney; Bill<br />
Woodfull; Archie Jackson; Stan McCabe; Sid Barnes; ' Slasher'<br />
Mackay; W. G. Grace; Ranjitsinhji; Jack Hobbs; Herbert<br />
Sutcliffe; Walter Hammond; Maurice Leyland; Bill Edrich; Ken<br />
Barrington bowlers like F. R. Spofforth, the ' Demon';<br />
C. T. B. Turner, the ' Terror'; Hugh Trumble; Arthur Mailey;<br />
Clarrie Grimmett; Jack Gregory; Ted McDonald; Wilfred<br />
Rhodes; Hedley Verity; Jim Laker; Bill Bowes; Maurice Tate;<br />
Bill Voce; Keith Famnes; wicket-keepers like John<br />
Blackham; Bertie Oldfield; Don Tallon; Wally Grout; Dick<br />
Lilley; Herbert Strudwick; George Duckworth.<br />
I did not see many of the men I have mentioned. A number of<br />
them were dead before I was born. But because of cricket's<br />
special qualities which I mentioned earlier, we feel a<br />
familiarity with them. Their fame will never die.<br />
Nor will that of the Living Legends.<br />
There are some wonderful cricketers here tonight and because<br />
of the characteristically whimsical, arbitrary and plain<br />
wrong decisions of the selectors not all of them played in<br />
the Bicentennial Test or the computer Test.<br />
Tonight's dinner gives me the opportunity to salute ' Tiger'<br />
O'Reilly, great match-winning bowler, custodian of the<br />
shrine of spin, excoriator of the bouncer, Grand Inquisitor<br />
of one-day cricket, full of passion and, of course, always<br />
free of prejudice. we learned this morning that Bill is to<br />
retire after years of delighting, exasperating, but always<br />
stimulating, cricket lovers with his learned and fiery<br />
pieces in the Sydney Morning Herald.<br />
Bill has always epitomised the highest standards of cricket<br />
and journalism. I will just mention two examples. Jack<br />
Pollard describes one of Bill's overs on the first morning<br />
of the old Trafford Test in 1934 as " one of the most<br />
sensational in cricket history". He had Walters caught at<br />
forward short leg from the first ball, knocked back Wyatt's<br />
middle stump with the second, watched Hammond edge the third<br />
through Oldfield's outstretched gloves for 4, and bowled him<br />
with the fourth. From 0 for 68, England had slumped to 3<br />
for 72.<br />
The other story relates to Bill's role as English teacher<br />
and journalist. A former Australian player wrote to him<br />
taking exception to some of the comments made about him.<br />
Bill returned the letter, correcting the 16 errors in<br />
spelling and syntax.<br />
on behalf of everyone here I should like to express our<br />
appreciation of Bill's magnificent contribution to<br />
Australian cricket and to wish him a very happy retirement. 004251 </p>
<p>For me it is a treat to see so many of the 1948 Australian<br />
team here. There are Arthur Morris and Neil Harvey, for<br />
example. In Canberra last year, I had the privilege oftheir<br />
company, along with Allan Border at The Lodge, on the<br />
eve of the Prime Minister's XI match against Mike Gatting's<br />
team. If we could have had Bill Lawry as well, that would<br />
have been a quartet of the greatest left-handers this<br />
country has produced since the Second World War.<br />
I understand that Lindsay Hassett was 12th man for the<br />
Australian Living Legends Team. Can the computer tell us<br />
what the man who put a goat in Bill O'Reilly's and<br />
Stan McCabe's room might have put in the Australian team's<br />
drinks? Lindsay was a magnificent batsman and sportsman, a<br />
great entertainer on or off the field, a brave and skilful<br />
captain who won friends for Australian cricket wherever he<br />
played and a superb broadcaster.<br />
We've got the legendary Ray Lindwall here, the most<br />
beautiful fast bowler I ever saw. It is very good to know<br />
that Ray's knowledge and experience are being passed on to<br />
members of the present Australian team.<br />
And then there's Keith Miller. what a fabulous cricketer!<br />
When I think of Miller, I think of the SCG clock, not<br />
because it's finally going again after all these years but<br />
because Keith is one of those batsmen who might have hit it.<br />
Keith, of course, once hit Doug Wright on to the top of the<br />
old MembersO Stand at the ' Gabba. In Sydney in 1946, he hit<br />
a ball from Ernie Toshack which was still rising when it<br />
struck seats in the M. A. Noble Stand, about five rows from<br />
the back.<br />
on the subject of hitting, Alan Davidson once hit his fellow<br />
Living Legend Colin Cowdrey, on to the top of the old<br />
Brewongle Stand and drove the next ball on to the wall at<br />
the back of the Hill. Davo's eyes still light up when the<br />
subject is discussed. There are probably a few other<br />
batsmen here whose eyes might have lit up at the prospect of<br />
facing my old friend Colin's bowling<br />
Richie Benaud has had an immeasurable influence on the<br />
development of modern cricket in Australia and around the<br />
world. His achievements with bat and particularly ball were<br />
superb, his captaincy brilliant and fearless, his concern to<br />
entertain the public unfailing.<br />
Benaud's teams, with great players like Bobby Simpson, Colin<br />
McDonald, Norman O'Neill, Peter Burge and Alan Davidson,<br />
never knew when they were beaten and provided tremendous<br />
value for money. Following the dominance established by Len<br />
Hutton's teams, they got the better of some very strong<br />
English sides, including the likes of Peter May, Colin<br />
Cowdrey, Ted Dexter, Freddie Trueman, Brian Statham and<br />
Frank Tyson. Richie has been a passionate advocate of<br />
one-day cricket and, under his influence, the televising of<br />
the game has been revolutionised. 004252 </p>
<p>And the Australian Living Legends side includes three<br />
representatives from the latest great era of Australian<br />
cricket, the Chappell era of the 19701s. The great Lillee<br />
is still playing. Rod marsh and I can vouch, having played<br />
with Dennis the other day Rod behind the stumps and I from<br />
the safer vantage point of mid-off that he has plenty of<br />
residual aggression.<br />
Ian Chappell, toug h, courageous captain and gutsy, brilliant<br />
batsman, looked very good, coming in at No. 11 at Manly, and<br />
cannot have missed out by much on a place in the Legends XI.<br />
Those sides also included outstanding players like Dougie<br />
Walters, Ian Redpath, Keith Stackpole and, of course,<br />
Thommo. Greg Chappell was one of our most elegant and<br />
prolific batsmen ever. And I can assure him on the basis of<br />
my visit to Wellington last November that, while he will<br />
never be forgotten in Australia, he continues to be<br />
remembered very keenly in New Zealand.<br />
Finally, I come to the Captain of the Australian Living<br />
Legends team, Sir Donald Bradman. The Bradman Albums and<br />
the Bradman Tapes continue to exercise a tremendous<br />
fascination, 40 years after the Don's retirement. His<br />
career spanned generations of great English bowlers, from<br />
the twilight of Wilfred Rhodes, through Harold Larwood, to<br />
Alec Bedser and Jim Laker. His run scoring feats made the<br />
wonderful achievements of contemporaries like Bill Ponsford,<br />
Stan McCabe, Walter Hammond and Len Hutton look routine.<br />
There are very few figures of my experience of whom at it<br />
can be accurately said that words can not do them justice.<br />
But of you, Sir Donald, I can, and do, say fearlessly that<br />
no words of mine or anyone else can adequately capture<br />
the uniqueness of your achievements or the special place you<br />
have carved out in the history of this country and in the<br />
hearts of its people.<br />
Last year, I had the honour of launching Don's Albums in<br />
Adelaide. That evening, like tonight's dinner, was a very<br />
special occasion. It aroused in me a sense of admiration of<br />
Australian achievement of the kind which I felt in opening<br />
the Tasmanian Exhibition in Hobart last October by<br />
Lloyd Rees, another Living Legend, and another great fan of<br />
the Don's.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen,<br />
AS you may imagine, the Bicentennial has been full of<br />
exciting experiences and impressions for Hazel and myself.<br />
The opportunity we have had this evening to dine with so<br />
many great cricketers of the past and present stands out as<br />
a very high point in a uniquely memorable week. 004253 </p>
