FOR PRESS 6 July 1976<br />
VICTORIAN FARMERS UNION<br />
Thank you for inviting me here to open the Victorian Farmers<br />
Union Conference. As both a Victorian and a farmer I have<br />
long been concerned with the problems of Victoria's rural industries.<br />
The economic hardship many farming families are being subjected to<br />
is all too obvious in the following figures: in the grazing<br />
industry for 1974/ 75, 45% had net incomes of $ 4,000 of below.<br />
In the dairying industry for 1974/ 75,. 30% had incomes of<br />
$ 51,000 or below. In the multi-purpose grape growing industry,<br />
42% had incomes of $ 4,000 or below. In the apple and pear industry,<br />
41% had incomes of $ 4,000 or below. This shows that large<br />
sections of primary producers are getting a new income<br />
despite their capital involved of half or less than half of<br />
average weekly earnings.<br />
on top of this we have had drought and a disastrous situation in<br />
the dairy industry which will make the position infinitely worse<br />
in this industry. There is no doubt that there are very major<br />
problems facing a number of rural industries. Problems that<br />
are having an exceedingly severe impact on many communities.<br />
Problems that will not be solved easily or quickly. A<br />
neglect of rural industry was one of the major problems<br />
the Government had to face on coming to office.<br />
For too long rural industry in Australia was ignored.<br />
Policies were adopted without any concern for the effects they<br />
might have on the rural community. There was a neg , lect of<br />
the fundamental fact that all sections of the Australian<br />
people are interdependent.<br />
Australia cannot be a prosperous country providing jobs for<br />
all and high quality products if one m-iajor scctor ) f the<br />
economy is depressed.<br />
One of the great problems has been that to m,. ost AustraliLans<br />
the condition of the rural industry remains invisible.<br />
When costs go up, not enough account is taken of their effect<br />
on farmers.<br />
These problems have been compounded by severe drought<br />
conditions which have left their mark on many communities. ./ 2 </p>
<p>It is self-evident that national prosperity cannot be built on a<br />
declining rural sector.<br />
All sections of Australian community are interdependent and policy<br />
has to recognise that fact.<br />
The economic problems which affect Australians in the cities affect<br />
farmers also.<br />
Foremost amongst these problems has been inflation as in<br />
manufacturing industry, inflation has destroyed Profitability in many<br />
businesses through rising costs and the workings of tax system.<br />
In primary as in secondary industry the priority is to restore<br />
profitability, only when business is, or has a prospect of<br />
being profitable, is new investment likely to take place, will jobS<br />
opportunities be expanded.<br />
This is why it is the Government's absolute determination to<br />
bring inflation and rising costs under cont_-rol.<br />
Only in this way can we start Australia moving forward again.<br />
The Government's strategy was developed in opposition and has<br />
been constantly reiterated since.<br />
The main elements of this strategy have been to bring Government<br />
spending under control, to free resources to the private sector and<br />
to individuals, to pursue a responsible monetary policy with<br />
clearly announced goals, and to generate a climate of: n atonal<br />
responsibility in which wage and salary restraint will be<br />
possible and in which both business and unions will act with a<br />
principal regard for the national interest.<br />
Immediately after coming to office we took steps to begin<br />
implementing this strategy administrative and spending economieshalted<br />
public service growth number of steps to help investment<br />
and ease the cash cris for many businesses. Among these has been<br />
the 40% investment allowance. The allowance applies to new plant<br />
purchased or leased between 1st January, 1976 and 30th June 1978 and<br />
L </p>
<p>-3-<br />
first used or installed by 30th June, 1979.<br />
The allowance will be available in respect of purchases of most<br />
new farm machinery, such as tractors, harvesters, etc., and for new<br />
structural improvements such as for on-farm. storage of hay,<br />
grain and fodder, for the cost of damns and earth tanks, bores, tanks<br />
wells and sub-divisional fencing.<br />
On 20th May the Treasurer announced a further series of measures<br />
in this strategy. These included: savings to the Budget amounting<br />
to almost $ 2600 million, full personal income tax indexation, a new<br />
scheme of family allowances. This will be of particular benefit to<br />
a number of farming families. Large proportions of farmers<br />
in dairying, fruitgrowing and othe rural industries have incomes<br />
below the taxable level. These derive no benefit from the tax<br />
rebates. They will derive great beneit from the family<br />
allowance scheme.<br />
The expenditure restraints mean that for the first time in several<br />
years there can be a soundly based confidence in the community<br />
that Government spending has at last been brought under control.<br />
In recent years, excessive Government spending has been the<br />
principal force fuelling excessive inflation and unemployment.<br />
When we came to Government we found public spending rising<br />
out of control. </p>
<p>Reimposing responsibility on the public sector means that<br />
resources can be freed to the private sector and to individuals.<br />
The various measures we have taken to assist business, and full<br />
personal income tax indexation, are only possible in the context<br />
of restraint in public sector spending.<br />
Solving our problems is not just a job for the Commonwealth<br />
Government. There are a numtber of matters, for example, some<br />
affecting the dairying industry where the States have responsibility,<br />
and I shall touch on this later.<br />
But this is a time when responsibilities extend far beyond<br />
Government, to industry groups, to union members, to all<br />
Australians. In our policy making we have emphasised consultation with<br />
representatives of all major sections of the economy.<br />
Last week we held our pre-Budget discussions with industry<br />
representatives, including, of course, the primary industry<br />
group. Several weeks ago we held an important series of consultations<br />
with the trade union movement. Out of these discussions<br />
camne a clear recogdtion of the contribution of the wages and<br />
salary bill -to inflation.<br />
One thing that worries me in the rural industry is that there<br />
have been a good many industrial disputes which have prejudiced<br />
selling opportunities beyond normal market accommodation<br />
problems causc. d by decisions of other -countries.-<br />
For example, in grains, although markets exist for all Australian<br />
crops, larger carry overs than normal are expected because of<br />
rolling strikes at seabord terminals and difficulties in transport. </p>
<p>-4AIn<br />
the meat industry there have been successive industrial<br />
disputes at meatworks leading to higher costs against the<br />
producers account and often frustrating market sales.<br />
Union members involved in handling or processing<br />
agricultural produce have the same interest in the survival<br />
of agriculture as the members of the V. F. U. I wonder sometimes<br />
whether the present precarious position of some sectors of<br />
Australian primary industries are appreciated by union leaders.<br />
I believe there is a widespread and growing recognition that<br />
restraint in Government spending must be matched by restraint<br />
S in wage and salary demands if costs are to be contained and growth<br />
in the economy resumed.<br />
With a national co-operative effort of which there are now signs,<br />
this can be achieved.<br />
In addition, of course, to the Government's general strategy<br />
S on the economy, we have taken a number of specific steps to aid<br />
particular rural industries, and have further measures under<br />
consideration. </p>
<p>Dairying The dairy industry-has long been plagued with difficulties.<br />
The problems which the industry was experiencing in<br />
adjusting to changing -world markets and domestic inflation<br />
have been greatly exaggerated by a collapse of the skim<br />
milk powder market<br />
This market collapse has its chief impact on the export oriented<br />
secto; of the dairy industry. And this is concentrated in<br />
Victoria and Tasmania.<br />
In recognition of this situation we have continued assistance<br />
through the dairy adjustment programme, and shared with the<br />
States in underwriting skim milk powder prices at<br />
at $ 300 per tonne up to 30th June. Also, we recently offered<br />
to join with-*-the States on a cost-sharing basis the further<br />
underwriting of skim milk powder at $ 300 per tonne and to also.<br />
underwrite the price of casein to a similar level.<br />
The Victorian Government has given some qualified agreement to<br />
these proposals but we are still waiting on answers from several<br />
other States.<br />
This is a very important example o: E what i meant when I referred<br />
to the need for all levels of Government and industry to cooperate<br />
with one another.<br />
But there is much the-State Governments could do. There is no<br />
longer a justification for two classes of dairy farmers within<br />
the dairy industry. People should be paid on the quality<br />
and quantity of their production.<br />
There is no reason why those in the imilk zones, purely<br />
because they are in the milk zones, should get a much higher<br />
return than those who are outside those Milk zones.<br />
Many of the dairy farmers now in acute difficulties would be<br />
in no difficulty if there was an appropriate equalisation<br />
based on quantity and quality throughout the whole of the State..<br />
The same applies to other States. This is a matter in which<br />
the States have jurisdiction, and at the moment, the<br />
Commonwealth none.<br />
In Sydney whole mi, l k prices have moved with the consumer<br />
price index. If this movement had occured in Mi'elbourne,<br />
there would be at least an additional $ 40 million a year<br />
to distribute to dairy farmers in Victoria. Since 1960/ 61<br />
whole milk prices to farmers in Victoria have risen by<br />
28% less than C. P. I. / 6 </p>
<p>Fruit-Growing<br />
The difficulties being faced by many fruitgrowerS are in essence<br />
the same as those confronting dairymen They amount to inadequate<br />
market outlets and High costs of production.<br />
You all know that there is no quick and easy answers to these<br />
problems. On the cost side combating of inflation is the top<br />
priority. On the marketing side we have extended the apple and<br />
pear and dried vine fruits stabilisation schemes. The " Tree-Pull"<br />
has been extended to the end of 1976 and the means test provisions<br />
have been liberalised.<br />
The canned fruit industry is experiencing particular difficulties<br />
and the answers are not easy to find. In co-operation with the<br />
States concerned we provided about $ 5 million earlier this year<br />
to fruit canneries to enable them to pay growers for fruit delivered<br />
in the 1974/ 75 season.<br />
We will, of course, continue to assist where necessary and will<br />
consider further funds for tree-pull if this seems warranted.<br />
In. its process of readjustment to market opportunities the industry<br />
can be assured of the sympathetic co-operation of my Government.<br />
I have-no doubt that both the dairying and the fruitgrowing industries<br />
despite their present severe problems have a future in Australia.<br />
Fruitgrowing and dairying are industries which Australia should be<br />
well placed to undertake.<br />
The problems these industries are now facing do not challenge their<br />
suriva asindustries. Tough questions have to be faced, but survival!<br />
as industries is not amongst them. I </p>

The depressed condition of the beef<br />

The market for beef continues to be<br />
uncertainties. industry has, of course, been<br />
fraught with difficulties<br />
industry has, of course, been<br />
fraught with difficulties and<br />
There is a differential in prices paid by the overseas consumer<br />
and the price paid to the Australian producer wees-beyond the actual<br />
cost of handling and processing. In Canada for example, in<br />
recent months sales have been made at levels of 25 cents below<br />
the price in the U. S. for comparable cuts of meat yet the cost of<br />
transhipping this meat into the U. S. is no more than 6 cents a lb.<br />
For many Australian exporters and Canadian importers this has given<br />
a clear 19 cents per lb. profit on a simple resale.<br />
This 19 cents per lb. has frequently been well above the price<br />
paid to the producer at . the original point of purchase.<br />
The Government has been active in seeking to secure improved access<br />
to beef markets overseas.<br />
The beef market was an important aspect of my discussions<br />
in Japan.<br />
The way in which the access to Japan for Australian beef was<br />
suddenly closed off was an example of how trading relations between<br />
Australia and Japan should not be handled.<br />
Where two nations are as closely lined as ours there must be sharing<br />
of the burdens as well as the benefits of trade. </p>
<p>The way in which the access to Japan for Australian beef was<br />
suddenly closed off w~ as an example of how trading relations between<br />
Australia and Japan should not be handled.<br />
Where two nations are as closiely linked as ours there must be<br />
sharing of the burdens as well as the benf its of trade.<br />
I pointed out to Japan that when difficulty arose in the car market<br />
here in Australia Japanese manufacturers still had access through.<br />
the quotas. But when there wer difficulties in Japan in the beef<br />
market, our producers were absolutely excluded.<br />
Wh ile in Japan I stressed t hat Austi~ alia intended to be a reliable<br />
supplier to Japan. I also stressed that reliability was not a<br />
one-way street. There has to be stability of trade in both<br />
directions.<br />
With regard to beef exports the Australian Government regards<br />
continuing stable and reliable access to the Japanese market as<br />
a matter of the highest impoitance. We welcome the fact that Japan<br />
has decided to resume imports of beef and the more recent decision<br />
to revert to six monthly import quota announcements. These will<br />
inject more short-term stability into this trade.<br />
With respect to our other markets, the Deputy Prime Minister,<br />
Mr. Anthony, announced in March the outcome of lengthy negotiations<br />
with the U. S. A. concerning allocations for meat imports by the U. S. A.<br />
Our share of the U. S. A. Market for 1976 is 287,000 tonnes, which is<br />
slightly higher than our initial allocation in 1975.<br />
We are also of course in a position to supply any shortfally on<br />
the U. S. A. market should they occur from cther beef exporting<br />
countries. The U. S. A. economy is improving and their cattle numbers are falling.<br />
It does not seem unreasonable to expect expansion of this most<br />
important market in the years ahead. </p>
<p>-8-<br />
Since taking office we have suspended the meat export charge<br />
at a cost of about $ 21 million'per year. We have also met the<br />
$ 1.24 million meat export charge on the sale of mean to the<br />
U. S. S. R. last year. Loan funds have been provided to the<br />
Commonwealth Development Bank to assist in financing loans<br />
to beef producers. Low interest rate carry-on finance is available<br />
through reconstruction authorities for producers and we have asked<br />
the States to indicate what further funds -they consider should be<br />
provided. We will make available $ 18.5 million in 1976/ 77 for the<br />
eradication and compensation for brucellosis and tuberculosis-infected<br />
animals.<br />
My colleague, the Minister for Primary Industry recently announced<br />
that the powers, functions and composition of the Meat Board are to<br />
be reviewed.<br />
Australia, along with other beef exporting countries, has been<br />
active in pressing the European Economic Community for a return to<br />
a more liberal import system for beef.<br />
It is our intention to upgrade the strength of our representation<br />
to the European Economic Community. 0<br />
For too long we have taken a largely passive approach to this<br />
grouping, which supports free trade in the manufactured products whi* 0<br />
raising immense and impenetrable barriers aginst farm products.<br />
In concert with other like-minded countries we will be seeking<br />
to break through these barriers. </p>
<p>-9-<br />
WOOL The government yesterday made a decision to lift the reserve price<br />
for the Australian wool clip to 275 cents per kilogram, clean for<br />
21 micron wool. This is an increase of 25 cents over the rate that<br />
has prevailed f or the last three years. I might add that this action<br />
also is in marked contrast from that taken by the former administration<br />
when, in a strengthening market situation, it sought to reduce the<br />
price to 209' cents from 250 cents per, kilogram, clean for 21 micron wool<br />
this, for a period, shattering confidence in w~ ool trade.<br />
The government has also taken the decision that this will prevail as<br />
the minimum price for the next two years. The purpose of this is<br />
to provide long term stability for the industry.<br />
In a situation where processors of wool often have to pay many months<br />
in advance, where it takes up to eighteen months or on occasions,<br />
even longer for wool to get from a wool shed into a garment on<br />
somebody's back it is clear that long'term stability is necessary.<br />
This is what the government is seeking to achieve.<br />
The government's decision is also based on the fact that it has<br />
confidence in the future demand for wool; that demand has been<br />
strengthening in recent weeks. The government wishes to reaffirm<br />
its confidence and to reinforce present moves by this decision.<br />
The government believes that considerable' quantities of the<br />
corporation's stocks will be. sbld over the next twelve months,<br />
0 as part of its normal trading operations. But even so, it is the<br />
government's view that the corporation needs to retain considerable<br />
stocks of wool., to enable wool to be supplied to major consumers in<br />
particular circumstances that might arise, and to make sure that<br />
disruptions to supply cannot interrupt the process of production.<br />
This is a positive action that the government has taken to reinforce<br />
one of Australia's most significant industries.<br />
In case anyone wishes to report that this decision will involve a<br />
cost on the taxpayer, let me immediately reassure taxpayers to the<br />
contrary. Growers know they are building their own fund to support<br />
these marketing arrangements, paying five percent of gross proceeds<br />
of the sale of wool and in addition to that, funds that have been<br />
advanced by the government over the past years at commercial interest<br />
rates, it is expected will be repaid almost in their entirety in the<br />
forthcoming twelve months.<br />
I </p>
<p>The Minister for Primary Industry,, my colleague Ian Sinclair, who<br />
is with me today will be releasing further details of the government's<br />
decision which will indicate a more sophist. icated approach to pricifig<br />
than has applied in the past.<br />
WHEAT Unlike other producers wheat growers have benefited from good overseas<br />
prices. Like other producers however, returns have been eroded by<br />
rising costs. Here as in other industries, the crucial factor is<br />
the success of the government's fight against inflation. Increased<br />
import demand and a continuing low level of world stocks suggd~ t that<br />
world prices for wheat will continue to remain attractive.,<br />
INCOME STABILISATION<br />
I want to comment briefly on the government's commitment to an income<br />
stabilisation scheme. During the election campaign, the Liberal and<br />
National Country Parties undertook to introduce an income ecualisatjn<br />
de posit or farm income reserve fund scheme. This proposal is desiid<br />
to meet a major problem that primary producers face the extremely<br />
wide fluctuations in their incomes from one year to the next.<br />
It also seeks to encourage more stability in farmers' annual<br />
investment expenditures. Under the scheme, taxpayers would be permitted<br />
to spread their income into the future by lodging deposits which<br />
are deductible for taxation purposes from current income.<br />
The amount deposited is deducted from this year's taxable income, and<br />
when the deposit is later withdrawn, in part or whole, the amount is<br />
added-to taxable income in that year. The Minister for Business i<br />
and Consumer Affairs has lodged a Cabinet Submission on the I. A. C.<br />
recommendation. Decisions will be made on this matter in the context<br />
of this year's budget.<br />
CARRY-ON ASSISTANCE<br />
The serious situation affecting some industries has had, of course,<br />
disastrous effects on some individual producers. During the last<br />
election campaign, the Liberal and National Country Parties gave an<br />
undertaking to examine the extension of unemployment benefits to<br />
primary producers. On l0th May this year, the Minister for Primary<br />
Industry announced that as an urgent interim measure the government<br />
had decided to vary the conditions of eligibility for unemployment<br />
benefits to include farmers who are suffering financial hardship and<br />
who have registered for employment, but who under previous conditions<br />
were ineligible for benefit.<br />
To be eligible for unemployment benefits under these conditions, </p>
<p>primary producers have to satisfy the test of being available for<br />
and actively seeking employment and their farm businesses have to<br />
be assessed as returning a net income lower than the rate of<br />
unemployment benefits. At 25 June, 1511 Victorian farmers were<br />
receiving unemployment benefits. The vast majority of these farmers<br />
were not eligible prior to the relaxation of eligibility conditions.<br />
This interim relaxation of unemployment benefits has been made to<br />
meet immediate needs and these arrangements are to be reviewed<br />
together with . the I. A. C. recommendations on rural reconstruction.<br />
Cabinet is shortly to consider recommendations on future assistance<br />
for rural adjustment, including household support, to apply from<br />
January 1977. These Cabinet Decisions will form the basis for<br />
discussions with the States. Following discussions with the States,<br />
a Decision will be taken qn the form of any household support to be<br />
provided. LOCAL* GOVERNMENT<br />
I said earlier that the problems we face require the cooperation of<br />
all levels of government. One key aspect of our Federalism Policy<br />
is to give a greater role to local government. In future a fixed<br />
percentage of personal income tax will be earmarked for distribution.<br />
through the* States to local government.<br />
Municipalities and shires throughout Australia will be able to<br />
calculate their annual revenue with greater certainty, and as a<br />
result,. they will also have very much greater independence of action.<br />
We have increased local Government entitlements under the new<br />
tax sharing by 75% from $ 80M to $ 140 M. The Victorian Government<br />
knows that its allocation is $ 35.4M. There is no reason why the<br />
State should not advise all councils of their allocation.<br />
Let us hope that this greater financial strength will be used to<br />
hold rates down, and not merely as a further opportunity to expand<br />
functions. 1%) </p>
<p>It is nonsense to say that governments at all levels should expect<br />
to spend more in real terms each year. It is even more of a nonsense<br />
when national production is falling rather than growing. Local<br />
government can have a real and positive impact in the present situation<br />
by helping to reduce costs. This is a direction for local government<br />
which merits wide support.<br />
Local government is certainly facing special problems. We' are mindful<br />
of that. It is our intention that with respect to roads the additional<br />
allocated should go almost solely to local government because<br />
of the special problems it faces in this area. This government is<br />
deterMined to ensure that its national policy decisions are taken w<br />
full regard for the effect of these decisions on Australia's rural<br />
industries.<br />
It is also determined t o work towards' arrangements which willprovide<br />
farmers with the greatest possible degree of predictability<br />
for planning-purposes, given the nature of their occupation and<br />
dependence on international markets.<br />
Many farmers are now experiencing ve ry severe problems. I am.<br />
confident that with appropriate government policies and with<br />
determination, these problems can be overcome and that Australia's<br />
rural industries will be an important element in the national return<br />
to prosperity. 00000o000 </p>
