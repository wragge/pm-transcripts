PRIME MINISTER 4' March 1981<br />
COMMONWEALTH ASSISTANCE TO THE STATES FOR NATURAL<br />
DISASTER RELIEF<br />
I have written to all Premiers, and the Chief Minister of the<br />
Northern Territory proposing that officials consult on a<br />
review of the current arrangements for Commonwealth<br />
assistance to the States and the Northern Territory for<br />
natural disaster relief.<br />
It is estimated that in 19 80/ 81 the Commonwealth will<br />
provide more than $ 71 million under these long standing<br />
arrangements, which help the States and the Northern Territory<br />
meet the sometimes large and unpredictable costs of providing<br />
natural disaster relief within their areas. The arrangements<br />
provide for Conmoi. wealth assistance on a reasonsable cost<br />
sharing basis in the event of major cyclones, floods, storms<br />
bushfires or droughts.<br />
Under the arrangements the Commonwealth meets, on a $ 1 for<br />
$ 1 basis State expenditures on standard measures for the<br />
immediate relief of personal hardship and distress, except<br />
where such'expenditure is of very minor nature. State<br />
expenditures may cover provision of emergency food, clothing<br />
and accommodation and essential repairs to houses to make themn<br />
habitable and secure.<br />
The Commonwealth also provides $ 3 for each $ 1 expended by<br />
each State beyond acertain base on other relief<br />
and restoration measures in the case of disasters which have<br />
a major effect on State budgets.<br />
Commonwealth and State officials met twice, late last year<br />
concerning the arrangements applying to drought. Those meetings<br />
have led to the Commonwealth agreeing to requests by State<br />
Governments for a number of new standard measures and<br />
extensions to existing measures.<br />
It now appears timely for a review for the total arrangements<br />
to facilitate consideration at the June 1981 Premiers'<br />
Conference. </p>
