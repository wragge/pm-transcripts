PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF SPEECH AT DEPARTURE OF RAN CONTRIBUTION TO<br />
GULF MULTINATIONAL FORCE, HMAS DARWIN, FLEET BASE/ GARDEN<br />
ISLAND, SYDNEY, 13 AUGUST 1990<br />
E O E PROOF ONLY<br />
Gentlemen of this ship, ladies and gentlemen. This<br />
is not an occasion for a long speech or high flying<br />
rhetoric. I'm here to perform a very simple job and that<br />
is to say to the men of HMAS Darwin who are leaving<br />
Australia to undertake an extremely important mission<br />
Australia has important interests in the Gulf. Also<br />
it's important for Australia that the world understands<br />
big countries cannot invade small neighbours and get away<br />
with it.<br />
Your mission is also important for the world and not just<br />
for Australia because if the end of the Cold War is in<br />
fact to usher in an era of peace then the world at large<br />
must be able to show that it is capable of giving effect<br />
to the principles of the United Nations Charter.<br />
Australia is entrusting this important mission to very<br />
few people, to some 600 men on these three ships that are<br />
sailing. You are the inheritors as you know of a great<br />
tradition of the Royal Australian Navy and of the<br />
Australian armed forces who time after time have shown<br />
their commitment, their bravery and toughness.<br />
I am proud and I know that all Australians are proud that<br />
we are able to entrust this mission to such a well<br />
qualified force.<br />
I hope and trust that your families will share with us<br />
this sense of pride and that will help the balance of<br />
what I know must be the pangs of parting.<br />
This is a situation where you are going to do an<br />
important job and important jobs are very rarely easy.<br />
But we know that you will do it well and you leave with<br />
the best wishes of all Australians.<br />
Bon voyage. 06-</p>
