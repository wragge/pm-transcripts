S HOBART PRESS CLUB<br />
22 SEPTEMBER 19751<br />
OPENING STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER N C<br />
Mr President, Ladies and Gentlemen.<br />
Thank you for giving me an opportunity again, directly<br />
and personally, and in these hospitable surroundings, to speak<br />
to the representatives of the Tasmanian Press. There's<br />
one particular point I want to make to you today: that is<br />
that the Australian Government is determined to remove the<br />
handicap of isolation which Tasmania suffers as Australia's<br />
only island State. Of necessity this is a long-term aim. it<br />
will not be achieved by temporary measures. Our policies<br />
are therefore designed to redress the basic handicap of<br />
separation from the mainland by attacking the fundamental<br />
problem on the basis of the best available advice and<br />
information. This has been a difficult year economically as you<br />
all know. Our economic problems the problems which Australia<br />
shares with every comparable country have not made our task<br />
in Tasmania any easier. our Budget last month recognised<br />
the need for a steady, continuing attack on inflation. We<br />
therefore decided that a sharp reduction in the growth of<br />
Government expenditure was needed. I emphasise, however,<br />
that in cutting back this rate of growth the Australian<br />
Government has bden generous, and will remain generous, in its<br />
outlays to the States. While we have imposed restraints on<br />
our own spending we have been reluctant to compel the States<br />
to do likewise, though naturally we expect that the same<br />
spirit of restraint will be observed by them. In point of<br />
fact, as Mr Hayden said in his Budget speech last month,<br />
we estimate that the financial assistance grants payable to<br />
the States this financial year will total about $ 3,185 million,<br />
an increase' of $ 811 million, an increase of 34.2 per cent<br />
over the grants paid by the Australian Government to the<br />
State Governments last financial year. This is on the basis<br />
of the improvements in financial arrangements which we<br />
undertook at'-the Premiers' Conference in June. So while no<br />
State Government may get as much from the Australian<br />
Government to spend as it would like they will all enjoy<br />
a much bigger increase in their expenditure than the<br />
Australian Government has so'ught or allowed for itself.<br />
Now to come back to Tasmania. We recognise that the<br />
chief problem is in transport. I undertook in November 1972<br />
that an Australian Labor Government would ensure that surface<br />
freight between Hobart and Melbourne would cost no more per<br />
ton mile, no more per tonne per kilometre than the surface<br />
freight between Melbourne and her other neighbouring capitals<br />
on the mainland, Sydney and Adelaide. Because previous<br />
Australian Governments had allowed the Inter-State Commission<br />
ordained in the Constitution to expire and had not persevered<br />
with proposals to reestabli~ sh it, the Government didn't have<br />
the necessary information available to it. We accordingly<br />
appointed Mr Nimmo as a Royal Commissioner to inquire into<br />
and report upon the whole subject. We expect his report<br />
in December or January. He commenced writing it earlier<br />
this month. The Commissioner has indicated that the issues </p>
<p>are so complex and inter-related that an interim report on<br />
any one aspect of his inquiries would serve little purpose.<br />
It's an enormous inquiry. Mr Nimmo has collected information<br />
from more than 140 firms, he has received 84 written<br />
submissions, he has interviewed 185 individuals and representatives<br />
of organisations. Evidence was given by 87 witnesses<br />
at the public hearing. He has inspected ferry services<br />
between the Eastern provinces of Canada-to Prince Edward<br />
Island and Newfoundland from the mainland-and also ferry<br />
services across the North Sea and the Baltic Sea. The<br />
Government will be considering his report as soon as it is<br />
received. Meantime , the Australian Government has made and will<br />
make no increases in northbouna AWL freight rates. This<br />
policy and the subsidy on ANL passenger services across<br />
Bass Strait will cost Australian taxpayers $ 6 to $ 7 million<br />
this financial year. Now, I know people constantly say, not<br />
enough. Therefore allow me to make at least this political<br />
point. The previous Liberal Federal Governments gave no<br />
financial assistance to these services at all. My Government<br />
is levying from Australian taxpayers as a whole $ 6 to $ 7<br />
million this year for this purpose.<br />
Incidentally, nobody prevents other lines providing a<br />
service. It's completely legal to do so. But it's increasingly<br />
being left to the ANL.<br />
In one respect, the price of wheat, Tasmania has for<br />
long been placed on the same footing as the mainland States.<br />
' the taxpayers, however, are paying more than they should to<br />
support this policy because no Tasmanian port is equ pped<br />
to service an adequate ship for the wheat trade. The<br />
matter has now come to a head. The ship hitherto used to<br />
deliver the wheat to Tasmania, the North Esk, has reached<br />
the end of its life. It is coming up for its survey and all<br />
the indications are that the survey will disclose so much<br />
would have to be done to it that it wouldn't be an economic<br />
proposition. The Tasmanian Government has been advised by<br />
Pak Poy and the Australian Government has been advised by<br />
AWL that a bulk ship is the proper ship for this trade.<br />
The ANL has several suitable, bulk ships already. There is<br />
however, no Tasmanian port w; hich can so far handle such a<br />
bulk ship. It's urgent to equip one of the Tasmanian ports<br />
to handle a wheat ship, a bulk ship, a modern ship; presumably* it'd be<br />
Bell Bay. In fact, Bell Bay should logically be the focus<br />
of Tasmania's sea, rail and road links with the mainland.<br />
The real significance of the acquisition of the<br />
Tasmanian Government Railways by the Australian National<br />
Railways lies in this context of better transport links with<br />
the mainland. With the res. ponsibility for rail services<br />
within the State and the responsibility for most sea services<br />
across the Strait reposing-in the national Government there<br />
will for the first time be a real effort to coordinate and<br />
dovetail these two essential modes of transport. With the<br />
national Government also accepting its constitutional<br />
responsibility to upgrade roads to the ports what the<br />
Constitution says is, that the Federal Parliament can pass </p>
<p>with respect to trade and commerce including trade and<br />
commerce by road, with other countries and among the;<br />
States. Accordingly the national Government has always<br />
had the responsibility, although mine is the first<br />
Government to accept the responsibility, to upgrade roads<br />
between States and the ports. Now with us accepting that<br />
responsibility Tasmanians can at last expect their basic<br />
handicap of isolation to be removed. I-' d better say<br />
something about the railways in another context, the<br />
financial context.<br />
The transfer of financial responsibility for your<br />
railways to the Australian Government came into effect<br />
last July on the basis of agreements between Mr Neilson and<br />
myself. In addition to getting a more modern and efficient<br />
railway service and better standards of track and rolling<br />
stock and signaling equipment there will be significant<br />
fianncial advantages for Tasmania. The State will be relieve<br />
of the burden of losses-and inevitably with the equipment<br />
which State Governments seem to be able to get for their<br />
rail ser" Yices, Those losses will mount every year. In<br />
New South Wales the losses are well over $ 200 million this<br />
year and in Victoria they're approaching $ 200. million.<br />
Now with the State being relieved of those losses, it will<br />
also receive an additional $ 3.3 million in financial assistance<br />
and on top of that we pay $ 5 million as a first contribution<br />
in consideration~ of assets.<br />
Another area where the Australian Government can give<br />
particular and much needed help to Tasmania is in urban and<br />
regional development. In the current financial year $ 1.8<br />
million has been provided to Tasmania, if I may mention it<br />
here, for sewerage programs; $ 840Y000 has been provided for<br />
the North-West Tasmanian Water Supply Scheme the first<br />
allocation ' of funds for this purpose. We have allocated<br />
the maximum possible amount of $ 500,000 to set up the<br />
Tasmanian Urban Land Council. And this Council will<br />
administer the land acquisition and development programs<br />
for which generous Australian Government funds will be<br />
available. As you already know well, the Australian Government<br />
is concentrating all its Ant'arctic Activities in Hobart and<br />
is establishing the Australian Maritime College on the Tamar;<br />
the legislation for that will be introduced next month.<br />
The apply and pear industry one of the pillars of-<br />
Tasmania's economy hitherto has received assistance on an<br />
unprecedented scale. You don't know how lucky you are havinq<br />
Senator Wriedt as the minister for Agriculture. We have<br />
continued the fruitgrowing reconstruction scheme and the<br />
stabilisation scheme for growers' returns on exported apples<br />
and pears. The Australian ' and Tasmanian Governments have<br />
agreed jointly to provide supplementary support for apples<br />
exported on an " at risk" basis to the United Kingdom and other<br />
European markets. The purpose is to sustain the viable sector<br />
of the export industry until the Australian Apple and Pear<br />
Corporation established by my Government can develop<br />
alternative markets. I am confident that the Corporation / 4 </p>
<p>will bring new drive and expertise to the promotion of<br />
this industry. In addition, $ 950,000 has been paid so far<br />
to Tasmanian fruitgrowers in post-revaluation adjustment<br />
assistance. The Industries Assistance Commission will be<br />
reporting later this year on apple and pear and other<br />
fruitgrowing reconstruction schemes.<br />
Finally I want to give you some-account of our response<br />
to the Tasman Bridge disaster. The social dislocation caused<br />
by the disaster was so great that remedial measures will<br />
necessarily take longer than at first seemed likely. Our<br />
response has been prompt and generous. The Australian<br />
Government was in no way obliged to rectify the destruction<br />
of the bridge but that hasn't stopped us from doing everything<br />
in our power to do so. People, take all these things for<br />
granted now. No suggestion was ever made under previous<br />
Federal Governments that there should be assistance for<br />
the West Gate Bridge for instance in Melbourne. Now the<br />
Australian Government a joint Tasman Bridge Restoration<br />
Commission has been established by the Australian and<br />
Tasmanian Governments. A very great Tasmanian, Sir Roland<br />
Wilson,-. you remember him as Secretary to the Treasury, and<br />
then chairman of Qantas and of the Commonwealth Bank he<br />
acts as my personal adviser on this matter. A sum of $ 6<br />
million was appropriated by the Australian Parliament for the<br />
period up to. the end of last June; a further $ 13.9 million<br />
has been appropriated for reconstruction, restoration and<br />
ancillary works in the present financial year. The Australian<br />
Government will finance the widening of the bridge during<br />
restoration to provide for five traffic lanes. You will get<br />
a very much better Bridge than you had before.<br />
The Australian Government has undertaken to meet all<br />
the costs of designting and constructing a second bridge and<br />
its approaches over the Derwent River between Dowsings Point<br />
and Cleburne Point. This bridge is estimated to cost $ 21 million<br />
and will have 4 traffic lanes. It will have a vertical<br />
clearance above the river of 15 metres.<br />
In the meantime we have undertaken a range of relief<br />
measures such as the financing of a permanent community<br />
health centre at Bellerive,. assistance with additional ambulance,<br />
fire-fighting, road safety, flaw enforcement and judicial<br />
services on the eastern shore, and assistance with emergency<br />
river crossing facilities. There has been virtually no limit<br />
to our readiness to cooperate with the Tasmanian Government<br />
and that cooperation will continue until community life in<br />
Hobart on both shores is restored to normal. From the ruins<br />
of the Tasman Bridge incomparably better metropolitan<br />
communications will arise. The capital of Tasmania will obtain<br />
better town planning and better civic services because for the<br />
first time there is a national Government which is involved<br />
in urban affairs. </p>
