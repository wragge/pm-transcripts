MEDIA RELEASE T -C-DES7 RATECUT<br />
Sta-. 2: ent by the ActingC7 _-rime M4inister, Rt ? ion. J. D. Anthcny, M. P.<br />
A reduction in interest rates would be one of the best<br />
things that could happen for the economy and for people in'the<br />
community The Government wants to see a reduction in interest rates,<br />
but is aware of the economic reality that this will only be<br />
possible when the inflation rate is brought down.<br />
That is why the Government is dedicated to the fight<br />
against inflation. A further rise in interest rates which are already very<br />
high would further aggravate our economic problems and affect<br />
confidence. Young people buying homes, primary producers, peop le<br />
trying to run all kinds of businesses both large and small, would<br />
all be hurt by higher interest rates.<br />
The Government's objective is to get interest rates down.<br />
Lower interest rates would have a very beneficial effect<br />
on the economy. But if the Government starts borrowing large sums of<br />
money, interest rates will be pushed up and everyone will suffer.<br />
If we were to do what many people are asking for and cut<br />
taxes now while the budget deficit is still far too high, we would<br />
only be asking for trouble.<br />
While a large budget deficit exists, tax cuts could be<br />
paid for in only two ways: by printing extra money, which is<br />
h2. ghly inflationary, or by the Government's borrowing money in<br />
competition with everyone else, thus lifting interest rates.<br />
Tax changes need to be looked at in the overall context<br />
o. 4t: a xation reform, and that is what the Government is doing.<br />
We know that taxation is too big a burden on many people,<br />
ands we want to reduce that burden and we will as soon as it<br />
4sensible to do so.<br />
