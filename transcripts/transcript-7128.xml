SPEECH1 BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
OPENING OF MTIA HOUSE<br />
SYDNEY 24 FEBRUARY 1987<br />
Jim Dowrie<br />
Barrie Unsworth<br />
Members of the MTIA<br />
Ladies and Gentlemen<br />
The Meta~ l Trades Industry Association stands today as one of<br />
the nation's foremost industry participants in the great<br />
econom'c transformation sweeping Australia.<br />
I have had occasion in the past to pass on to you my and my<br />
Governmnt's unqualified praise for the role you are playing<br />
in thiG dramatic and historic change.<br />
It is a pleasure to be here again this evening to repeat and<br />
reentphasise our recognition of your efforts and to do so<br />
in the now MTIA House which I trust will serve you well for<br />
many years to come.<br />
Nearly three decades have passed since your old premises<br />
were officially opened a few doors down the road. To<br />
consider the changes in attitude which have taken place in<br />
the MTIA over those decades is to realise the enormous scope<br />
of the changes which have taken place, and Must continue to<br />
take place, in the Australian economy and in the Australian<br />
community as a whole.<br />
With hindsight, we can see that those easy decades of growth<br />
in Australia after the Second World War sowed the seeds for<br />
many of the problems we must solve in the 1980' s and 1990' s.<br />
Due in large part to the foregone opportunities and the<br />
neglect of the governments of the time, the Australian<br />
economy became imbalanced and inward looking. It became<br />
overly reliant on agricultural and mineral exports, while an<br />
artificial environment was created for our manufacturing<br />
industries through heavy protectionism. </p>
<p>In those days, the MTIA was one of the nation's staunchest<br />
advocates of protectionism. To your great credit, you have<br />
since recogniscd that protectionism does not hold the key to<br />
real growth that it was in fact an obstacle to real<br />
growth, because it encouraged a manufacturing industry which<br />
catered almos' exclusively for a small domestic market<br />
instead of ec1. ppl ing itself to perform the greater task of<br />
competing abicx,, A.<br />
Like many othi't-sectors of the economy, employers in your<br />
industry were content to hold the comfortable but<br />
fundamentally lawed position that increased government<br />
hand-outs and a-, sured isolation from the region and the<br />
world were th,, best guarantee of jobs, profits and security.<br />
Australia was lulled into the complacent feeling that there<br />
would always be a world market for the seemingly-scarce<br />
commodities which our farms and mines effortlessly produced.<br />
There was a fzllure, too, of political vision, as short-term<br />
electoral coni ide rations again and again stymi-ed change and<br />
fettered the development of a comprehensive and durable<br />
strategy for S:: owth.<br />
These attitueo:, were not ones which my Government held when<br />
we were elected3 to office in M4arch 1983. Right from the<br />
start, we recoqinised we had been presented with a great<br />
challenge, and a great responsibility: to be the first<br />
government to reorient and restructure the economy and so<br />
set the path for sustained economic growth in the 1990' s.<br />
Right from thz 3tart, we tackled the problem of reducing the<br />
expected $ 9.6 hilllion deficit our conservative predecessors<br />
had bequeathed. us; of slashing inflation; of creating with<br />
the cooperatio:-i of the trade union movement a wages and<br />
industrial reiv. ations policy capable of restraining labour<br />
costs and restoring harmony in the workplace so as to make<br />
us competitive with our trading partners; of building an<br />
education systemn which would allow our children to develop<br />
the skills they need to find satisfying and productive work;<br />
of freeing the financial institutions of needless regulation<br />
so as to attract capital to our shores and to allow our<br />
currency to find its real value; of rescuing the steel<br />
industry and puzting it on a firm foundation for future<br />
growth; of wiri'Ang back protectionism.<br />
In all the important measures of economic performance, this<br />
determination to take the long-term view yielded results.<br />
Jobs grew; inflation fell; growth was restored after the<br />
recession of thn early 1980' s.<br />
Yet we knew we , ere still not out of the woods. When the<br />
agricultural trade war broke out between the US and the<br />
European Community, and when the oil market collapsed and<br />
took down with~ it the prices of other commodities, the<br />
Australian economy underwent a severe trial but one which,<br />
as I have said, was not a surprise to anyone who understood<br />
the inherited aeaknesses of our economy. </p>
<p>our terms of trade collapsed. overseas buyers made it<br />
painfully clear they were no longer willing to pay the same<br />
prices for the commodities which we produce so efficiently<br />
and on which we relied for our prosperity. our national<br />
income fell by $ 6 billion, with the consequence that our<br />
living standards had to fall.<br />
As a result, my Government's mission of structural<br />
readjustmcnt has become even more pressing. To restore<br />
prosperity, it is imperative we diversify our economy, and<br />
learn to export. We must continue to achieve modest growth<br />
in labour costs and wind back our inflation rate. We must<br />
continue to restrain public sector spending.<br />
I should cay that as we are about to celebrate four years in<br />
office we have some cause for real satisfaction that the<br />
sacrifices we have made as a nation are beginning to bear<br />
fruit. Wc are starting to turn the economy around. But I<br />
must add this hard fact: that more hard choices await us<br />
and further sacrifices will be necessary.<br />
In all this period of restructuring, the MTIA has proven to<br />
be a creative and positive force.<br />
You have been active in encouraging your members to search<br />
for new markets and to help each other identify new export<br />
opportunities. You have not just paid lip service to the<br />
goal of a vigorous and competitive sector of manufacturing<br />
exports; you have actually gone about the task of building<br />
such a sector.<br />
Further, ycu deserve congratulations for the way in which<br />
you have sou.' ght to create, with metal industry unions, a<br />
cooperative approach to the central issues of improving<br />
productivity by eliminating inefficient work practices and<br />
establishing workable procedures for settling disputes.<br />
It is appropriate then that I share with you at this forum<br />
my responses to the latest economic indicators and to reveal<br />
some broad details about our strategy for managing the<br />
economy up to the budget and beyond.<br />
Let me take as my starting point the December quarter CPI.<br />
An increase of 2.9 per cent in a single quarter is not to be<br />
dismissed lightly especially at a time when many other<br />
countries fail to post that level of increase in a year.<br />
But the explanation for the high December result is to be<br />
found in the conjunction of a number of separate forces<br />
which are not expected to operate as powerfully in coming<br />
quarters. of greatest importance among them is the continued effect of<br />
higher prices of goods and services affected by the<br />
depreciation of the Australian dollar. </p>
<p>Of course our annual inflation rate will be held up for some<br />
quarters yet by the high CPI figures of the September and<br />
December quarters.<br />
But that will bn a measure of inflation past. A better<br />
guide to our prospective inflation rate in 1987 will be<br />
found in the quarterly movements in the CPI which the<br />
Government confidently expects to run at levels sharply<br />
lower than in the second half of 1906.<br />
one reason for that confidence is the greater stability of<br />
the currency si'-nce mid-1986 which should gradually reduce<br />
the external ;,) roissure on domestic prices.<br />
Another is our expectation of continued wage restraint.<br />
Workers in Australia have contributed magnificently over the<br />
past four years to the task of securing prolonged economic<br />
recovery.<br />
on present indications real unit labour costs will have<br />
fallen by soma~ 3 per cent by the end of 1986-87.<br />
And there is every likelihood of a further decline in<br />
1987-88.<br />
In the current National Wage Case, the Government has firmly<br />
put its view that continued modest outcomes for labour costs<br />
overall, consistent with achieving a workable industrial<br />
system, are essential to continued job security and<br />
Australia's longer term prosperity.<br />
In the last analysis, it is for the Conciliation and<br />
Arbitration Commission to make its determination on the<br />
basis of the evidence put to it.<br />
Clearly not all parties can, or ever will, be fully<br />
satisfied by the eventual determination.<br />
Nevertheless all parties must abide by the decision of the<br />
Commi ssi on.<br />
I am utterly convinced that centralised wage fixing offers<br />
the nation its best hope of securing economic prosperity,<br />
industrial harmiony and social equity.<br />
In our delicately poised economy we cannot afford the<br />
reckless experiment of open wage bargaining suggested by our<br />
political opponents, since that could only be a recipe for<br />
renewed industrial instability and higher inflation.<br />
Under the Accord, this Government has won the cooperation of<br />
the overwhelming majority of trade unions in working towards<br />
our goal of restraining wage increases to broad<br />
comparability with that of our major trading partners. </p>
<p>I scarcely need add that the fruits of our industrial<br />
relations policy falling real unit labor costs, the more<br />
than halving of numbers of working days lost, increased<br />
competitiveness, increased profit share, increased<br />
employment, increased attractiveness to overseas investors<br />
and buyers could never have been won by our conservative<br />
opponents had they been in office.<br />
Just as we cannot afford to dismantle the Conciliation and<br />
Arbitration Commission, so we cannot afford to accede to the<br />
renewed pressure for wage increases outside Commission<br />
guidelines being experienced in some industries.<br />
The Government acknowledges that, after 4 years of sustained<br />
wage restraint, pressures are building up for some of the<br />
stronger groups to seek the kinds of wage increases which<br />
their market power could allow.<br />
But the country needs wiser heads to prevail if we are not<br />
to pay the price in lost jobs of excessive wage claims and<br />
industrial disputation.<br />
Naturally we look to price setters to practice restraint<br />
too, and to adhere to the voluntary pricing guidelines<br />
promulgated by the Prices Surveillance Authority. That is<br />
as much the secret to sustained competitiveness as wage<br />
restraint itself.<br />
In the samae way, Australia has as much to lose from<br />
industrial disputation induced by insensitive or unthinking<br />
management as it has from unjustified industrial pressure<br />
applied by workers.<br />
That point has more than usual significance at this time for<br />
several reasons, only one element of which is the apparent<br />
lawlessness of the so called New Right.<br />
The proposed new two-tier wage structure is intended to<br />
provide an element of flexibility in wage bargaining. But<br />
that flexibility cannot be invoked without disputation if<br />
managements are not prepared to discuss proposals with<br />
workers. of course such proposals would need to be consistent with<br />
the guidelines to be developed by the Commission in respect<br />
of the second tier. Ultimately Australian workers as a<br />
whole cannot afford increases inconsistent with those<br />
principles. In the area of reform of work practices, we again look to<br />
both management and employees to address the task seriously<br />
and cooperat;. vely.<br />
The only sure way to sustain the growth of Australian jobs<br />
and living standards is a thorough reassessment of many of<br />
our traditional attitudes to productivity improvement,<br />
product quality, innovation and reliability. </p>
<p>6.<br />
This simple fact was recognised explicitly by all of the<br />
peak employer and employee bodies which attended the special<br />
meeting which T convened last September to discuss the<br />
issue. Those groups have continued to work to give greater momentum<br />
to the movemant for reform. What is needed now is a greater<br />
recognition at workpl~ ace level that reform is not only<br />
needed but is needed now.<br />
The depreciation of our currency has given Australian<br />
suppliers of manufactures a massive boost in competitiveness<br />
compared with producers in Japan, the United States and<br />
Europe.<br />
Many Australian manufacturers now have the opportunity to<br />
make significantly increased sales at the expense of these<br />
producers. Even excluding some irregular items like the export of<br />
aircraft, the value of manufacturing exports in the first<br />
seven months of this financial year was 30 per cent higher<br />
than in the corresponding period last year.<br />
But the improvement in Australian competitiveness can<br />
quickly be lost if our attitudes to work and product quality<br />
do not at least match those of our competitors.<br />
That point applies with even greater force in the case of<br />
some of the newly emerging exporters of manufactures in our<br />
region. In some instances the realignment of our currency against<br />
these countries has not yet been as sharp as against the<br />
more established exporters of manufactures.<br />
In these instances in particular we will need to rely<br />
heavily on " home-grown" competitiveness won through real<br />
improvements in our productivity.<br />
Before leaving the issue of competitive exports, may I note<br />
in passing that a delegation of officials from China is in<br />
the audience this evening, headed by Mr Lin Zongtang,<br />
vice-Chairman of the State Economic Commission.<br />
I believe the friendly relations between China and<br />
Australia, and our shared position on the Pacific rim the<br />
fastest growing economic region in the world offers great<br />
opportunities for expanded trade between us.<br />
I wish to turn now briefly to a second aspect of our<br />
economic performance which is equally indispensable to<br />
Australia's future prosperity that is, the need gradually<br />
to shrink the relative importance of the public sector.<br />
Last week the 3tatistician told us that Australia's gross<br />
external debt had passed $ 100 billion. It had increased by<br />
130 per cent over the June 1984 level to reach 43 per cent<br />
of GDP. </p>
<p>To put this into perspective, one must note:<br />
first, that Australia's holdings of assets abroad amount<br />
to some $ 20 billion, so that our net external debt is<br />
somewhat lower at $ 80 billion or 34 per cent of GDP; and<br />
second, our indebtedness has been growing in large part<br />
because of the effect of depreciation on our existing<br />
oversea~ s debt denominated in Australian dollars.<br />
40 per cent of the increase since June 1984 can be<br />
ascribed to this factor alone.<br />
Nevertheless, the debt figures give added point to one of<br />
the principal planks of our economic policy making: the<br />
need, over time, to reduce the public sector's call on the<br />
savings poo-.<br />
If we do not accept that option, the inevitable result will<br />
be slower growth and much higher unemployment.<br />
It is to avoid the economic and social debilitation of<br />
prolonged high unemployment that this Government has opted<br />
for consistent, realistic fiscal restraint at all levels of<br />
Governmenz. It is with this objective in mind that the Commonwealth is<br />
approaching a crucial series of economic decisions<br />
culminating in the 1987-88 Budget.<br />
From the Commnonwealth's side we are faced with a substantial<br />
savings task to produce a responsible budget outcome.<br />
But we are determined to meet the challenge and to<br />
distribute the burden of adjustment fairly.<br />
Against this; background, Cabinet has agreed to prepare an<br />
expenditure savings statement for release by the middle of<br />
May. This will allow the full effect of the measures to be felt<br />
in the 1987-88 budget since savings will be able to take<br />
effect from 1 July.<br />
Our approach to the States at the Premier's Conference, to<br />
be held this year in late may, must also reflect this<br />
continued restraint.<br />
Over recent years the Commonwealth sought and has obtained<br />
reductionr in the gross borrowings of State authorities over<br />
recent years. But States have had sufficient cash reserves<br />
to avoid the intended fiscal constraint.<br />
At the sane time, we have brought the Commonwealth Budget<br />
deficit down from the enormous 5 per cent of GDP in prospect<br />
when we camce to office in 1983 to about 1 1/ 2 per cent in<br />
1986-87. </p>
<p>8.<br />
The Public Sector Borrowing Requirement of the States,<br />
however, adjusted for use of cash balances, has increased<br />
by a full one -per cent of GDP over the past three years.<br />
We will be telling the Premiers that that situation cannot<br />
continue indefinitely.<br />
Ladies and gejntlemen,<br />
Let me make this observation in conclusion.<br />
we have been in office now for nearly four years.<br />
Our economic management over that time has been clearheaded,<br />
decisive and utterly consistent. we have taken hard<br />
decisions that previous governments shirked or fudged<br />
because they ware more concerned with the prevailing<br />
political winds than with the fundamental needs of the<br />
nation. Our commitment to the continued rational management of the<br />
economy cannot be doubted. our commitment to an equitable<br />
sharing of the burden, and the protection of the<br />
disadvantaged, cannot be questioned.<br />
We recognise of course that we could not have advanced this<br />
task of restructuring without the cooperation and<br />
understanding of the entire Australian community, including<br />
the trade union movement and including, as I have<br />
acknowledged, the Metal Trades Industry Association.<br />
That cooperation lends us hope that the task of<br />
reconstruction may be completed successfully.<br />
The success to this point, I know you will agree, has<br />
depended upon not just the concept but the practice of<br />
consultation and cooperation between government, business<br />
and trade unions. Again I pay your organisation unqualified<br />
tribute for youjr part in this process.<br />
The completion of our jointly shared commitment to a<br />
restructured, vital and vibrant economy depends upon a<br />
continuation of this environment. My Government offers<br />
precisely that. we reject the alternatives of divisiveness,<br />
confrontation and ' Alice in Wonderland' arithmetic not<br />
inappropriately described by Mr Steele Hall as " snake oil"<br />
proposals. That is not our way I believe it is not yours. </p>
