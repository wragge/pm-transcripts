PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF NEWS CONFERENCE, CHANNEL NINE STUDIOS,<br />
MELBOURNE 20 AUGUST 19S9<br />
a oz PROOF ONLY<br />
JOURNALIST: Can the RAAF be brought in to solve the pilots,<br />
dispute? PM: Well you know when of conflict that you shouldn't<br />
signal your shots. I'm wanting to make it clear. I don't<br />
want war. I want peace. I want the pilots to understand<br />
they're no different to you people, ordinary workers, that<br />
they should be within the system. That's what I want them<br />
to do. I hope that that's what they'll do. But what I'm<br />
saying is if they want war then there will be war. We're<br />
not going to lose this one. I'm not going to be disclosing<br />
what we're going to be doing other than to say these things.<br />
Firstly that we will be fully behind the airline operators<br />
in any action they take to institute legal processes,<br />
punitive legal processes against individual pi lots and their<br />
organisation. Secondly we'll do everything we possibly can<br />
to provide skeletal services. We can't substitute for<br />
existing services. We'll do everything we can to provide<br />
some sort of emergency service situation and something<br />
beyond that. I'm not going into any details.<br />
JOURNALIST: The reports are out that the RAAF is being<br />
prepared. What do you say to those<br />
PM: I've seen lots of reports about lots of things in my<br />
life. Some are true, some are not.<br />
JOURNALIST: Are you looking at this as the sort of thing to<br />
lead up to an election, a power struggle?<br />
PM: Don't be silly, of course not. Don't, don't that<br />
really is a very, with respect, I don't want to be rude to<br />
you but that is a very sillytquestion. This is something<br />
that the pilots have apparently been leading up to and my<br />
~ osition is simply that if they're going to do it, whenever<br />
t is# whether it's at the start ofa term of government or<br />
at the end of it or in the middle of it, they ' re not going<br />
to win it. it's got nothing to do with an election at all.<br />
JOURNALIST: So what is your warning to the pilots? </p>
<p>I 9V. -2-<br />
PM: I've given it. That is that they operate within, they<br />
have operated within a conciliation and arbitration system.<br />
That is a system which confers rights and imposes<br />
obligations. We want them to stay within it because they<br />
are essentially no different from other wage and salary<br />
earners in this country. For God's sake let them demystify<br />
themselves. The fact that they fly an aeroplane doesn't<br />
make them different from other wage and salary earners. if<br />
they think they're going to be different and get outside the<br />
system, my message to them is that they will cop every<br />
instrument of punishment and retribution and reaction that<br />
the operators bring against them.<br />
JOURNALIST: Can you give us any insight as to what you mean<br />
by war?<br />
PM: Well, it's conflict. That is, they have said alright<br />
here is an orderly system within which relations between<br />
employees and employers operates. There are rules and<br />
regulations and constitutions and institutions, including<br />
the Commission, which handle the relationships between<br />
people. They say we don't want anything of that. They<br />
don't want to be part of it, we're different to everyone<br />
else, we ' re going to go outside. if they go outside this<br />
means that all the processes of the law, which can include<br />
common law action and other things which will involve action<br />
by the airlines against individual pilots for penalties and<br />
damages, very signficant financial impositions upon them.<br />
That's what's on.<br />
JOURNALIST: Four o'clock is the deadline. It's getting<br />
pretty serious.<br />
PM: My number one message to each and every one of those<br />
pilots and to the Federation is this. Please don't..<br />
provoke conflict. Don't delude yourselves that because<br />
you've learnt to fly an aeroplane, which is not the most<br />
difficult thing to dofn the world -the Prime Minister<br />
learnt to do it when he was a. young fellow it's not the<br />
most difficult thing in the world to do. It doesn't make<br />
you someone different. You're already on average on $ 80,000<br />
a year. You're in a situation where the previous president<br />
of your organisation has said, and let me quote what he<br />
said, Captain Tony Fitzsimmons, ' there is no other pilots'<br />
group in the world that enjoys your overall pay structure'.<br />
You're already in a privileged posi tion. You are not going<br />
to break the wages system in this country and get another<br />
That's the message.<br />
JOURNALIST: Can you say whether the RAAF has been<br />
consulted? PM: I have nothing to say in that area.<br />
