FOR MEDIA TUESDAY, 11 MAY 1982<br />
CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION<br />
I have written today to all State Premiers and the Chief<br />
Minister of the Northern Territory seeking their views on the<br />
desirability of holding another session of the Australian<br />
Constitutional. Convention. If States and the Northern Territory<br />
support the holding of another session, timing would be discussed<br />
at the June Premiers' Conference.<br />
The Constitutional Convention consists of representatives from<br />
the Commonwealth, State and Northern Territory Parliaments as<br />
well as from local government and the Australian Capital<br />
Territory. It has met in four plenary sessions: 1973 ( Sydney),<br />
1975 ( Melbourne), 1976 ( Hobart) and 1978 ( Perth). At the last<br />
session, it was agreed to hold the next session in Adelaide<br />
at a time to be determined after the views of the Premiers'<br />
Conference hadf. been obtained.<br />
The Constitution has served Australia well. It has proved<br />
capable of being adapted to suit changing social, political and<br />
international circumstances. It is, however, accepted by all<br />
pGlitical parties that there are areas where some change is<br />
desirable. The Convention provides the opportunity for<br />
representatives of the three tiers of Government and from the<br />
major political parties to consider such areas and to make<br />
recommendations for change where appropriate.<br />
While the Australian electorate has traditionally been cautious<br />
about constitutional change, experience in 1977 would indicate<br />
that where there is a wide measure of agreement between the<br />
Commonwealth and the States, and across the political spectrum,<br />
the prospects of amendments being carried are good, especially<br />
where proposals have been thoroughly considered and endorsed by<br />
the Convention. Each of the 1977 referendum Questions arose<br />
substantially from the deliberations of the early sessions of the<br />
Convention.<br />
A successful meeting of the Convention requires a spirit of<br />
co-operation from all sides based on agreement that there are<br />
available substantial proposals sufficiently well developed for<br />
meaningful discussion. Since the last Plenary Session, a Standing<br />
Committee, chaired by the Common.: ealth At-ori-ev-General, has been<br />
examining a number of questions such as the Senate and Supply<br />
and the term cf the Parliament. The Cormiittee is now in a position<br />
to report on some matters and others are substantially developed.<br />
The Commonwealth's action in raising the cquestion of a further<br />
session at this time reflects its commitment to the Convention as<br />
a continuing forum for the consideration of possible changes to<br />
the Constitution. </p>
