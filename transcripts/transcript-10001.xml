    <content><![CDATA[<p>FUNDING OF GUN ' BUY BACK' SCHEME<br />
I am writing to all Premiers and Chief Ministers to inform them that the Commonwealth Government is prepared to fund all, of the direct cost of the gun ' buy back' scheme agreed to by the Commonwealth and the States at last Friday's meeting of Police Ministers. </p>
<p>The funds will be raised by a one-off increase in the Medicare levy from 1.5% to 1.7% for the income year 1996-97. The funds raised - estimated at approximately $500 million  - will be devoted solely to the purpose of fuanding compensation for surrendered guns, with any<br />
surplus returned via the Medicare levy system. </p>
<p>This represents approximately $70 or $1.40 a week for a person on average weekly earnings. </p>
<p>This whole scheme is designed to reduce the number of guns in the community and make Australia a safer place to live. I believe that Australians are prepared to make this sacrifice, in the wake of the tragic events at Port Arthur. </p>
<p>Providing the necessary incentives to remove rapid fire weapons from our community underpins the urgent and comprehensive action on gun control which all governments have been prepared to undertake. </p>
<p>The Commonwealth funds will be for the fair and proper compensation of gun owners who surrender those firearms agreed by Police Ministers to be subject to nation-wide prohibition, ie self-loading rifles, self-loading shotguns and pump action shotguns. The States and Territories will be asked to meet the cost of admrinistering the ' buy back' scheme.</p>
<p>The Commnonwealth recognises; the importance of conducting a public education campaign in conjunction with the amnesty and compensation scheme, and of developing an appropriate firearms safety course, and will contribute to the cost of both programs. </p>
<p>I urge all Australians who own these guns to take advantage of the amnesty and compensation arrangements, when available. </p>
<p>The Commonwealth Government has also taken action to ban the importation of the guns to be subject to nation-wide-prohibition.<br />
