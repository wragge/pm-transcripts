FOR MEDIA 19 JULY 1982<br />
STATEMENT ON TAXATION AND INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE MEASURES<br />
The Government has completed a major review of its industry<br />
and related policies. It has done so against the background<br />
of deteriorating economic conditions abroad and in Australia;:<br />
and against the background of the Government's responsibility<br />
to provide an overall policy environment conducive to the<br />
development of Australian industries, the expansion of<br />
employment opportunities and improvement in living standards.<br />
Private investment is fundamental to the achievement of<br />
those objectives and to improve the climate for investment<br />
the Government has decided that:<br />
under the general depreciation provisions, plant<br />
ordered after today will, subject to certain<br />
exclusions, be eligible for accelerated<br />
depreciation over either 3 or 5 years;<br />
mining and petroleum companies will benefit by<br />
, continuing to have the option to depreciate their<br />
-plant under the general depreciation provisions or<br />
under the mining and petroleum provisions in<br />
Divisions 10 and 10AA of the Income Tax Assessment<br />
Act; allowable capital expenditure by mining companies<br />
will be deductible by reference to the lesser of the<br />
life of the mine or ten years, on a straight line basis;<br />
new primary production plant will generally be<br />
depreciable over three years;<br />
where applicable, the investrent allowance will<br />
continue to be available; and<br />
new non-residential income producing buildings,<br />
the construction of which co. mence after today,<br />
will be eligible for depreciation at a prime cost<br />
rate of 2 per cent. / 2 </p>
<p>The Government had also decidedthat<br />
the Industrial Resear~ i and Development<br />
Incentives Scheme should continue without any<br />
major changes;<br />
the Export Market Development Scheme should be<br />
significantly strengthened;<br />
the. Export Expansion Grants SchemLe will be allowed<br />
to lapse on 30 June 1982; and<br />
not,* to proceed at the present with a program of<br />
further reductions in protection.<br />
BACKGROUND TC) THE DECISIONS<br />
Last year thE! Government forwarded three important references<br />
to the IAC. In line with normal practice, the Commission's<br />
Reports are now being released to the public.<br />
Two of those references -on Exoort Incentives and Certain<br />
Budgetary AsSistance sought advice from the IAC on the<br />
effectivenesS of present budgetary assistance to industry<br />
development, and whether changes, including improvements<br />
in depreciation provisions, would lead to more effective<br />
use of the community's resources devoted t,-o industry<br />
development. The other major reference sought the IAC's advice on<br />
Approaches to General Reductions in Protection. That<br />
reference had been foreshadowed when the Government announced<br />
its response in 1979 to the Report of the Study Group on<br />
Structural Adjustment.<br />
The prospective economic environment has changed markedly<br />
since the IAC was asked to report on the three references<br />
and no Government could responsibly i~ nore this reality in,<br />
reaching its decisions on these reports.<br />
In particular, world economic conditions have deteriorated<br />
in a way that no one could reasonably have anticipated. In<br />
1981-82 real GNP in the OECD area increased by only half a<br />
per cent and activity weakened during the course of the year.<br />
The United States economy is in recession, activity in West<br />
Germany and the United Kingdom remains depressed, while the<br />
Canadian economy has contracted. In France, real GDP is now<br />
falling after rising modestly in the second half of 1981.<br />
Even the growth recorded by Japan over the past year %.. as<br />
poor by its standards.<br />
This subdued level of activity has been reflected in the<br />
first decline in the value of world trade in over twenty<br />
years. Real. interest rates in the United States and Europe<br />
have reached historically high levels. Over thirty-million<br />
people are c.. urrently without jobs in the OECD countries. </p>
<p>Responsible Economic policies h1-ave enabled Australia to<br />
move against the international tide to some extent. Our<br />
growth perfoi. mance has in recent years been better than<br />
in most other countries. However, we are now feeling the<br />
effects of weaker demand for our exports and plummetting<br />
prices for some of our major exports;<br />
high interest rates ( in common with overseas<br />
pal-terns);<br />
a deterioration in the competitive position of our<br />
industries, primarily because wage settlements<br />
including claims for shorter hours have been out of<br />
line with those in the rest of the world; and<br />
a severe squeeze on profits ( the share of company<br />
gross operating surplus in non-farm GDP fell from<br />
45.. 4 per cent in the September quarter 1981 to<br />
12.3 per cent for the March quarter 1982).<br />
Against this background it is not surprising that in recent<br />
months growth in business fixed capital expenditure has come t~ o<br />
a halt, construction activity has declined sharply, GDP declined<br />
in the six months to March and ' that employment growth has<br />
slowed down markedly.<br />
In the period immediately ahead economic activity will continue<br />
to reflect the slump in business profitability, as well as<br />
prolonged int: ernational recession and increased competitive<br />
pressures. ' Investment in the resource sector will be maintained<br />
at relatively high levrels for a time as projects previously<br />
started or committed are brought to completion. But while world<br />
economic conditions remain as they are we cannot expect to see<br />
a return to : he sort of substantial new investment decisions of<br />
a year or two ago. Investment in manufacturing, which has been<br />
at unsatisfactory levels for most of the 1970s, is likely to<br />
suffer another setback as a result of the continuing squeeze<br />
on profits. I<br />
Investment is the basis on which Australia's growth, and<br />
rising real incomes, ultimately depend and in reviewing its<br />
approach to industry policy the Government has paid<br />
particular attention to the importance of providing the best<br />
and most stable climate for investment.<br />
Government support for industry is based on three key pillars.<br />
The first and most fundamental . is the general stance of7<br />
economic policy. The main elements ofL-the Government's economic<br />
policy over -the period ahead will, of course, be fully revealed<br />
in the forthcoming Budget. All I wish to stress here is that,<br />
while current economic circumstances must be given due weight,<br />
we will not weaken in any way our resolve to maintain<br />
economic policies directed to the winding down of inflation and<br />
inflationary expectations, and providing a stable environment<br />
for business to operate in. / 4 </p>
<p>DEPRECIATION PROVISIONS<br />
The second pi'llar is budgetary assistance. With the aim of.<br />
improving the overall climate for private investment the<br />
Government has decided that, subject to certain specific<br />
exclusions, plant ordered after today will be eligible for<br />
accelerated cf. epreciation over either 3 or 5 years. Under<br />
these arrangEments, eligible plant will qualify for a 20 per<br />
cent prime cost rate of depreciation or, where under existing<br />
law such plarLt would attract a rate of more than 20 per cent,<br />
a 331 j-per cent prime cost rate.<br />
New primary production plant that would otherwise qualify<br />
for the special 20 per cent deduction basis introduced in 1980<br />
will, under the new system, qualify for deductions on a 33-1 per<br />
cent basis.<br />
Where applicable, the investment allowance will continue to be:<br />
available ' and, its future will be reviewed prior to its<br />
scheduled-' terrination date. In those cases where the existingdepreciation<br />
arrangements confer greater benefits than would<br />
be the case under the new scheme, a person will be entitled to<br />
retain the benefit of the existing arrangements. Benefits from<br />
these new arrangements will be available to all sectors of the:<br />
economy. After today, plant used in manufacturing and elsewhere<br />
in the economy will be eligible for either 3 or 5 year write-off<br />
according to its present depreciable life, while most new plant<br />
used by primary producers will be depreciable over three years..<br />
Benefits will, also be available to mining and petroleum<br />
companies as they have the option to depreciate their plant<br />
under the gerieral depreciation provisions or under the mining<br />
and petroleum provisions in Divisions 10 and 10AA of the Income<br />
Tax Assessment Act.<br />
The Government has also decided to modify the write-off<br />
provisions in Divisions 10 and 10AA. The Income Tax<br />
Assessment Act presently states that allowable capital<br />
expenditure is deductible by reference to the lesser of<br />
the life of the mine, or ten years, on a diminishing value<br />
basis. The Government has decided to amend the Act so that<br />
expenditure Will be deductible by reference to the lesser of<br />
the life of the mine, or ten years, on a straight line basis.<br />
In addition t~ o those changes the Government has also decided<br />
that new non-residential ihcome-producing buildings, the<br />
construction of which commence after today, are to be<br />
eligible for depreciation at a prime cost rate of 2 per cent<br />
on a similar basis to that presently applying to traveller<br />
accominodation buildings. This will provide a greater incentive<br />
for firms to ensure that structures remain up to date and will.<br />
contribute co~ nsiderably to productivity and improvements in the<br />
working environment for employees.<br />
The Treasurer will be announcing further details of ' the<br />
proposed changes and the Ministers for Industry and-Commerce<br />
and Trade and Resources will be issuing statements on aspects<br />
of particular relevance to their portfolio responsibilities. </p>
<p>An indication of the benefits to business, and costs to<br />
revenue, of th-. e measures I have outlined above is provided<br />
itn e atached table. Alth-ough these m.~ easures will not<br />
have their full effects on revenue for some years, the<br />
incentive thEy Will provide to new investment will be<br />
immediate and substantial. The benefits to investing<br />
firms, and costs to revenue, will build up progressively<br />
during the 1980s.<br />
This new depreciation package will significantly enhance the<br />
long term climate for investment in Australia and will put<br />
Australian businesses on a more competitive basis With their<br />
overseas counterparts. It will assist business to adapt more<br />
readily to nE! w technological and other changes in the economic:<br />
environment, and enable them to approach investment decisions<br />
with greater flexibility and confidence. The boost to future<br />
business cash flows should also help cushion investment from<br />
the full effects of the downturn in the international economy<br />
and encourage firms to put themselves in a position to take<br />
maximum advatg of recovery in world economic conditions,<br />
when it comes.<br />
These decisions reflect the Government's belief that higher<br />
levels of priLvate investment are the key to higher living<br />
standards and increased job opportunities in the future.<br />
Those objectives, however, cannot be achieved without the<br />
co-operation of business and organised labour. The Government<br />
looks to business to respond positively to these new measures..<br />
It also looks to labour by moderating its demands for higher<br />
wages and shorter hours to resist the temptation to seek the<br />
fruits of newa investment before they are available. Particularly<br />
if that co-operation is forthcoming, the Government is confident<br />
that these new measures will make an important contribution to<br />
the objectives we a11 seek more jobs and increasing real<br />
incomes. INDUSTRIAL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT<br />
The IAC found the Australian Industrial Research and<br />
Development Incentives Scheme to be making an effective<br />
contribution to the achievement of the Government's industry<br />
policy objectives. The Commission's conclusion is consistent<br />
with the views expressed by previous expert committees,<br />
including, most recently, the Committee of Inquiry into<br />
Technological Change in Australia. The scheme was<br />
comprehensively reviewed by the Government as recently as<br />
1980 and an improved program was introduced for five years<br />
from 1 July 1981. Accordingly the Government has decided<br />
that the AIRDIS should continue without any major changes.<br />
EXPORT INCENTIVES<br />
When considering the report of the IAC on what changes should<br />
be made to the current methods of assisting the development<br />
of exports through the EMDG and EEG Acts the. Government had<br />
particular regard to its desire to foster a healthy ' export<br />
industry'sector. ./ 6 </p>
<p>The Gover-nment has decided that, given thiis objective, the<br />
EMDG scheme should be significantly strengthened. The main,<br />
decision on the EMDG is to raise the grant ceiling to $ 200,000.<br />
The present ceiling has remained unaltered since 1974. The<br />
EEG scheme will be allowed to lapse on 30 June 1983. The<br />
improvements to the EMODG scheme will take effect from the<br />
grant . year 19182/ 83 which is the year in which the EEG scheme<br />
will operate at half rates.<br />
These decisions will improve the effectiveness of our direct<br />
assistance to) the export sector; will free some savings for<br />
re-direction to improved depreciation provisions which, of<br />
course, will assist exporters; are in line with the<br />
international position regarding export performance based<br />
schemes; and represent a modest step by Australia toward<br />
the multilateral winding back of subsidies to<br />
international trade proposed under the Governent's recent<br />
trade initiat~ ive.<br />
My-colleague the Minister for Trade and Resources will elaborate<br />
the decisionS taken with regard to the EMDG scheme.<br />
PROTECT ION<br />
The third ma * jor pillar of Government industry support is<br />
protection policy. The Government's broad approach to<br />
protection policy is based on its recognition that, together with<br />
the provision of industry development assistance, gradual<br />
reductions in protection have a part to play in encouraging the<br />
development of a stronger, more specialised and competitive<br />
manufacturing sector. The Government remains committed to those<br />
objectives -the more'so in view of the difficult economic times<br />
ahead.<br />
After giving the most careful consideration to the options<br />
for further reductions identified by the IAC, the Government<br />
has come to the view that-these objectives would not be best<br />
served by proceeding at present with a' program of further<br />
reductions in protection.<br />
While recognising the role that reductions in protection<br />
can play in improving the structure and competitiveness of<br />
industry, the Government was also conscious of the significant<br />
reductions in protection that a wide range of industries have<br />
experienced over the past decade.<br />
This process is continuing, with further reductions already<br />
in train as a result of decisions that have been taken on<br />
IAG reports in recent years, including those arising from thE!<br />
recent completion of the Tariff Review Program. More than<br />
separate product groupings are currently subject to phasing<br />
down of tariff, quota or bounty assistance. In addition, thEsectoral<br />
policies for the textile, clothing and footwear<br />
industries and passenger motor vehicle industry which have<br />
been separately determined by the Governinen after careful<br />
and detailed review contain built-in pressures for<br />
structural change, including increased market access for<br />
imports. Those established programs of adjustment for o/. 7 </p>
<p>these industries will continue.<br />
* In concludinc that no further general reductions in protection<br />
are-practicab) le at this time, the Government was also conscious<br />
that the cape-city of the community to accommodate the economic<br />
and social consequences of such unilateral reductions is<br />
necessarily reduced in periods of subdued economic activityand<br />
at a time! when our own exporters are facing increasing<br />
restrictions on their access to overseas markets. Non-tariffrestrictions<br />
on trade in particular have proliferated in the last<br />
three years, and as much as 50 per cent of Australia's export<br />
trade is now estimated to be affected by such measures.<br />
The Government's concern about the international economic<br />
situation, and these increasing impediments to trade, prompted<br />
it earlier this year to promote an initiative aimed at<br />
acceptance by the world trading community of the need to wind<br />
back trade d-fstorting measures of all kinds. The Government<br />
made it clear that it did not have in mind unilateral action by<br />
Australia; , nor did it look to any other country to act on its<br />
own. Rather, it promoted the concept of broad intei~ national<br />
action with a view to providing a stimulus to world trade.<br />
The decisions I have announced today are compatible with that<br />
initiative. They involve a winding down of direct assistance<br />
to exports, and, as noted, earlier, decisions already taken will<br />
lead to some further gradual reductions in protection in certain<br />
areas.<br />
The Government is firmly committed to the pursuit of its<br />
initiative, and will press its views in the GATT Ministerial<br />
Meeting in Geneva in November. Our initiative has already<br />
gained suppo:--t in the preparatory meetings now in progress.<br />
It is up to countries meeting at the GATT Ministerial in<br />
November to decide whether they wish to act together and take<br />
the necessary steps to implement the prop . osals. In the event<br />
that the major industrialised countries do so, Australia has<br />
made clear that it will support them. </p>

() Actual revenue effects in these years will be subject to<br />
the outcome of a review of the investment allowance prior<br />
to its current expiry date in 1985-86. Cost of the<br />
investment allowance is currently $ 600 million in a full<br />
year. Estimates apply to newly acquired plant and are in 1981-82<br />
prices assuming constant real expenditure at 1981-82 levels.<br />
Estimates assume businesses have sufficient income to<br />
enable earliest write-off. To the extent that such income<br />
is not available effects would be deferred.<br />
The estimates indicate the full year effects on revenue<br />
of each of the measures. Because of the considerable lead<br />
times involved for much investment, it is likely that the<br />
main impact of the measures would not be borne until 1984-85.<br />
However, revenue in 1983-84 would also be affected to some'<br />
extent and 1982-83 collections from individuals could also<br />
be reduced slightly through variation of provisional tax.<br />
Peak annual cost of around $ 130 million will occur somewhat<br />
beyond the period shown in the table. </p>
