UNITED STATES MEAT IMPORTS<br />
St~ atemnent by the Prime Minister, the Rt Hon. William M4cMahon, C. H., M. P.<br />
I have received advice that the President of the United<br />
States has decided that restrictions on imports of meat will be<br />
suspended for the remainder of 1972.<br />
Australia welcomes this decision by the President. It has<br />
been made in the light of rising meat prices in the United States<br />
because of shortages in domestic supplies.<br />
We are the major supplier of imported meats to the United<br />
States. United States imports of meat were limited to 1,240 million<br />
ounds in 1972. Australia's share of this quantity was 600 million<br />
pounds valued at approximately A$ 270 million.<br />
From November 1971 to the middle of June 1972, Australian<br />
exports for arrival in the United States in 19172 were 30% above<br />
the figures for the period November 1970 to the middle of June<br />
1971. Apart from Australia, most other suppliers were having<br />
difficulty in meeting their quotas for-1972. However, on the<br />
basis of Derformance to date, Australia will have no difficulty<br />
in fi!. ling its quota for 1972, and also supplying increased<br />
quantities to the United States.<br />
