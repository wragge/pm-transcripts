    <content><![CDATA[<p>Albert ‘Alby’ Schultz was a very highly regarded and well respected Member of the House of Representatives. He will be sorely missed.</p>
<p>Alby began his political career as a Councillor for Cootamundra Shire Council in 1983 before serving as the member for Burrinjuck in the New South Wales Legislative Assembly for over a decade.</p>
<p>He entered federal politics in 1998 and represented the constituents of Hume for the next fifteen years. He was the longest-serving member of Hume since Federation.</p>
<p>When Alby resigned in 2013, he ended three decades of service in local, state and federal government.</p>
<p>A man of sound judgement and strong character, Alby was as much at home in the shearing shed, the local pub, and the corridors of Parliament House.</p>
<p>He started out working in abattoirs and brought an earthy common sense to public life.</p>
<p>On behalf of the Coalition, I extend our sympathies to his wife, Gloria, their children Dean and Grant and their five grandchildren.</p>
<p>14 July 2015</p>
