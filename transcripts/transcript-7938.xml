PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF NEWS CONFERENCE, PERTH ZOO, 3 MARCH 1990<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
PM: It's very appropriate that we should be meeting in<br />
this environment which is a clear manifestation of<br />
another area of our environmental concern which we've<br />
enhanced today by making further funds available for the<br />
endangered species program that is going to be developed<br />
here in Western Australia. This comes at the end of a<br />
week where the Coalition has once again indicated its<br />
environmental vandalism credentials. We have the example<br />
again of the National Party tail wagging the Coalition<br />
dog with the announcement that they would support the<br />
establishment of the uranium enrichment industry. Once<br />
they saw some reaction to that they back-pedalled a<br />
little bit, but not substantially, with Mr Peacock saying<br />
that if it didn't happen in the first year it would<br />
happen in the second or third year. This is something<br />
which has been undertaken without any consideration<br />
either of the economics of it and certainly of the<br />
environmental implications, and certainly without taking<br />
into account the obligations that we have in regard to<br />
the safeguarding of the uranium cycle around the world.<br />
We don't want to be seeing a proliferation of uranium<br />
enrichment industries. So we reject the proposal of the<br />
Coalition. And it's also interesting to note that in<br />
this week there has emerged the fact that Mr Peacock<br />
again, either deliberately or because he simply doesn't<br />
know his own policies, misrepresented last Sunday in the<br />
debate the situation in regard to the Kakadu National<br />
Park. You will recall that in the debate they have made<br />
it clear that the policy of the Coalition was to allow<br />
mineral exploration in Kakadu. Mr Peacock said no, but<br />
of course it's been established since then that what I<br />
said was right. That is their position. So the people<br />
of Australia on the issue of the environment have, as I<br />
said last Sunday, a very very stark choice. I remind the<br />
people again that on every major decision that I've taken<br />
to protect the environment the Franklin, to stop<br />
logging in Daintree, mining in Kakadu, saving the forests<br />
in Tasmania on every one of those decisions we were<br />
opposed by the Liberal and National Parties. And in this<br />
campaign they are, as I say, establishing once again<br />
their credentials as environmental vandals.<br />
JOURNALIST: Today in the Sydney Morning Herald there<br />
appears to be a comprehensive leak on Labor's child care<br />
policy to be unveiled next week. Are we seeing here some </p>
<p>sort of Dutch auction between Labor and the Liberals when<br />
it comes to child care?<br />
PM: Let me say two things about that. I haven't yet<br />
read the report to which you refer Paul and I make no<br />
comment on any report. I'll be making an announcement at<br />
the appropriate time in regard to child care. The second<br />
thing I say is this. We are not in any Dutch auction. I<br />
am able to stand before the people of Australia now and<br />
very proudly compare and contrast our record on child<br />
care with that of our opponents. We have more than<br />
doubled, in fact Just under 150% increase in the<br />
number of child care places since we've been in<br />
government. And under the program that's going on that<br />
will mean by 1992 a trebling under my Government of the<br />
number of child care places. So I stand proud on the<br />
issue of child care. We see proposals from the<br />
Opposition which in an untargeted way are going to give<br />
handouts to people who relatively speaking are not in<br />
need. But I will detail our new proposals at the<br />
appropriate time.<br />
JOURNALIST: But the fact is that the Liberal Party is<br />
proposing to treble the spending on child care that<br />
you're prepared to commit.<br />
PM: You can easily treble spending on child care or a<br />
number of other things but there are two things that you<br />
have to take into account when you talk about spending<br />
proposals. Firstly, targeting. The Opposition have a<br />
very very distorted concept of targeting. If you look at<br />
them over the years they've said watch the dole bludgers.<br />
They have a very very acute vision when it comes to<br />
targeting at the bottom end of the income scale. Knock<br />
the dole bludgers type of thing. Very very acute vision<br />
when it comes to targeting down there. The same<br />
acuteness of vision disappears when they look at the top<br />
of the income scale where they say well just give it to<br />
anyone, whatever the level of income. So that's the<br />
first thing. Second thing, as I've been saying<br />
throughout this week, and it seems to be taking hold now<br />
in this campaign, you've got to look at the funding of<br />
the promises that you make. Now the fact is that as we<br />
now come to the end of the second week of the campaign<br />
the Liberals have done nothing to answer the legitimate<br />
questions of the media and of the people of Australia<br />
about this more than $ 6 billion funding hole. And<br />
they're going to have to do that because they are not<br />
believable in the handout. You can see that they will<br />
promise with the left hand giving something in child care<br />
but they're going to rip it away on the other hand. Look<br />
at what they're going to be ripping away. They're going<br />
to be ripping away in the area of superannuation and of<br />
course if they are going to fund the $ 6 billion deficit<br />
then where are they going to cut? They're going to have<br />
to cut an enormous amount of services to people. Or, if<br />
they don't do that, they'll blow the budget. And if they<br />
do that then of course interest rates go through the roof </p>
<p>a 3<br />
and people have it taken away in that fashion. They have<br />
failed lamentably to discharge the responsibilities they<br />
have to the people. You can't simply say yes we'll give<br />
you something in child care and then leave this<br />
uncompleted picture of how people will suffer either by<br />
the tremendous cuts they're going to have to make in<br />
other services or by the blowing out of the budget<br />
deficit. JOURNALIST: Child care is a big issue in the electorate,<br />
but has the Government and the trade union movement been<br />
a bit slow to respond to the concerns out there?<br />
PM: You could hardly say we're slow to respond to<br />
concerns where over our period of seven years in office<br />
we've had just on 150% increase in child care places.<br />
It's pretty hard to say you're slow to respond when<br />
that's your record and in fact you have funded and in<br />
progress the creation of a further 30,000 places which<br />
will mean a trebling of places over the period. It's<br />
pretty hard to make the accusation of slowness in those<br />
circumstances. JOURNALIST: But over that period of time demand has<br />
increased dramatically as well as more women have gone<br />
back into the workforce.<br />
PM: Well yes, but we have undertaken a range of<br />
approaches, as you know, in regard to also encouraging<br />
employers to provide work-related child care places. I<br />
don't think anyone can say that in terms of the<br />
Australian record of governments and child care that any<br />
other government, as I've said before, has come within a<br />
bull's roar of the performance of this Government.<br />
JOURNALIST: The ACF is having a ballot this weekend to<br />
decide who to give their second preferences to. Does<br />
Labor expect to get them?<br />
PM: We deserve to get them Peter. The Government of<br />
Australia after the 24th of March will be provided either<br />
by my Party, a continuation of the Labor Government, or<br />
by the environmental vandalistic coalition of Libs and<br />
National Party. If people whose predominant concern is<br />
the environment want to have the environment of Australia<br />
protected then there is only one responsible decision<br />
that can be made. And that is to ensure that their<br />
preferences go to Labor.<br />
ends </p>
