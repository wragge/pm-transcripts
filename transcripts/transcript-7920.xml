TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW WITH MIKE CARLTON, RADIO 2GB, 22<br />
FEBRUARY 1990<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
CARLTON: The 1990 election campaign and my guest for the<br />
next half hour Prime Minister, Bob Hawke. Morning.<br />
PM: Morning, Mike.<br />
CARLTON: Thanks for joining us.<br />
PM: Pleasure.<br />
CARLTON: Over the last seven years you've asked all<br />
Australians to accept restraint, to tighten the belt in<br />
the national interest and do you feel that they have done<br />
that? PM: Yes they have, there's been magnificent cooperation.<br />
CARLTON: So the average worker, the average Australian<br />
family has done the right thing tightened the belt as<br />
you've asked them?<br />
PM: Well, tighten the belt they've exercised<br />
restraint. I mean, there are a lot of them, many of them<br />
who could have exercised their power to get more and they<br />
didn't. That's the case.<br />
CARLTON: How then can you explain that your Labor<br />
Government has presided over the greatest period of<br />
business and corporate thuggery and piracy that we've<br />
seen since the gold rushes?<br />
PM: Well I don't accept that. That's your assertion,<br />
but if you say that we've had a very significant increase<br />
in profits, that's true, but you want to complete the<br />
equation that increase in profits has been associated<br />
with the largest investment boom in history which has<br />
been associated with the largest employment growth in<br />
history. So the move to profits from wages has gone into<br />
investment and just look at what that rate of job<br />
creation means. It's five times faster than before and<br />
twice as fast as the rest of the world. I mean, if you<br />
are going to talk about it, why don't you complete the<br />
equation, Mike? </p>
<p>CARLTON: Alright, but I'm not talking about legitimate<br />
profit and investment, I'm talking about the fat cats, if<br />
you like, the Bonds, the Skases, the Herscues and if you<br />
like, the John Elliotts. They have piled extravagance<br />
upon extravagance haven't they?<br />
PM: Yes, Mike, well a lot of people have piled<br />
extravagance upon extravagance and claim upon claim. I<br />
mean, I don't want to get personal. I don't know, for<br />
instance, in your case what the improvement in your<br />
remuneration has been over the period, but if people have<br />
the power in a market to get more out of it a lot of<br />
people do the Bonds, the Skases, perhaps the Mike<br />
Carltons they, if they've got a bargaining power<br />
CARLTON: No, mine's gone down.<br />
PM: Well, has it Mike? Well I don't know, but all I'm<br />
saying is that it's easy to point to extravagances on the<br />
part of some and let me say, because I don't have an<br />
extravagant, you know, taste. I mean I don't go looking<br />
for miles and miles more for myself, but I don't like<br />
extravagant lifestyles, I don't like the ostentatious<br />
display of wealth. It doesn't appeal to me, but if<br />
you're going to look at what we've done about it just, I<br />
ask you to remember this. In 1980, you know in that<br />
period before we came to office, Professor Mathews, the<br />
foremost authority on the tax system and what happens in<br />
terms of people being made to pay, Mathews said it's<br />
become a matter of option and choice as to whether the<br />
rich pay their tax.<br />
CARLTON: Yes.<br />
PM: Now we have made them pay their tax through imposing<br />
a capital gains tax. There is a fringe benefits tax<br />
where people avoided and now literally billions of<br />
dollars have been taken from the rich who were able to<br />
flaunt their lifestyle before without paying any tax.<br />
Under my Government, while sure there's still<br />
ostentation, and I don't like it Mike any more than you<br />
do, but what I'm saying is, as a result of deliberate tax<br />
policy we've made them pay where before the independent<br />
authority said it was a matter of their choice whether<br />
they paid.<br />
CARLTON: Yes, but the ordinary bloke out there on his<br />
$ 30,000 a year or whatever<br />
PM: Yes.<br />
CARLTON: Has accepted your call for restraint and as<br />
you've said, magnificently, but watched while your<br />
Government has stood by on these<br />
PM: Well, you're just ignoring what I've said. How can<br />
you say I stood by when the independent authority, not </p>
<p>the Mike Carlton when the independent authority said<br />
before Hawke came to Government it was a matter of choice<br />
as to whether the rich paid tax. I have changed that and<br />
now I have taken billions from them. Now to be fair, I<br />
mean, try to be fair<br />
CARLTON: they were still throwing tax through the<br />
Cook Islands only a year ago.<br />
PM: And that's been closed off. I mean, will you, will<br />
you give credit for the fact that we've made them pay<br />
billions of dollars, that Mathews will not write now, as<br />
he did write before I came to office, that it was a<br />
matter of choice as to whether they paid tax. They don't<br />
write that any more.<br />
CARLTON: Do you think business got out of hand, this<br />
sort of corporate greed syndrome?<br />
PM: I think some of it, Mike. I mean, now let's be<br />
fair. I mean, obviously, I mean if I were to talk about<br />
any group of people and pick out the, you know, the ones<br />
that behave badly, then, and tried to attach that to<br />
everyone, it would be very unfair. Let me give you an<br />
example. I went over to Auckland to the Games. Now<br />
before I went over there, there was this beatup that a<br />
couple of our athletes, it was alleged, had behaved<br />
badly. Now I went over there and I went and had a couple<br />
of hours just sitting down at lunch with all our<br />
Australian athletes and, look, you couldn't be prouder of<br />
them a magnificent bunch but the alleged activities<br />
of a couple at the beginning, the alleged activities of a<br />
couple CARLTON: Smeared the lot.<br />
PM: Smeared the lot. Now I think, Mike, if you look at,<br />
look at the corporate sector, of course there've been<br />
some cowboys and I've been critical of cowboyishness.<br />
CARLTON: You were seen as mates of some of them a while<br />
ago. PM: Well, look, as far as I'm concerned if I have<br />
someone who is a friend that started off long I mean,<br />
Peter Abeles is talked about. Peter Abeles has been a<br />
close friend of mine going back to 1970 when he was<br />
virtually no-one. He was just starting off TNT, you saw<br />
the TNT truck around the place. He has been a close<br />
friend of me and of my family and my kids. Now I don't<br />
give away my friends. I'm not going to condemn Peter<br />
Abeles to be eliminated from my friendship because he<br />
became rich. Now<br />
CARLTON: I wasn't thinking of him, I was thinking of<br />
people like Bond and so on. </p>
<p>PM: Well, look, I've been photographed with Bondy and at<br />
the time like, may I say, 99.9 percent of Australians in<br />
1983, 1 was very proud of Alan Bond. I'd like you to<br />
find an Australian who wasn't, but<br />
CARLTON: Now?<br />
PM: Let me say this, not just now, who was the bloke who<br />
more trenchantly than anyone criticised Bondy at the time<br />
of his Chilean deal? I went public and I said, I mean, I<br />
just think that was appalling. Now Alan doesn't come in<br />
the category of a close, close mate of mine. I knew him<br />
and I applauded the good things he did for Australia.<br />
The things that he did that I didn't like I'm not a<br />
Johnny-come-lately hopping on to some critical bandwagon<br />
I said it at the time.<br />
CARLTON: Yes, alright. A lot of Australians though say<br />
why should we have to pay these high interest rates,<br />
expensive rates paying back our home mortgage when a lot<br />
of the trouble has been caused by these, these cowboys<br />
borrowing these billions overseas?<br />
PM: Well let's, let's get this figure about the<br />
borrowing overseas into perspective. As you are rightly<br />
implying in your observations the great majority of this<br />
overseas debt is in the private sector, but<br />
CARLTON: You're not borrowing it, the Government's not<br />
borrowing it.<br />
PM: We are a net creditor.<br />
CARLTON: Yes<br />
PM: We inherited a debt situation from our<br />
predecessors. we've paid it off, but let me make the<br />
point and it's not my source that I'm going to, it's the<br />
Opposition source Access Economics.<br />
CARLTON: Yes.<br />
PM: Now Access Economics, OK, independent. They just<br />
brought out a publication at the end of last year in<br />
which it showed $ 90 billion, $ 90 billion worth of<br />
investment projects either being undertaken, confirmed or<br />
under serious contemplation. And that $ 90 billion is, if<br />
you like, the good side of the debt picture<br />
CARLTON: Yes.<br />
PM: and they said, Mike, that that will, when it all<br />
comes on stream will be bringing in $ 10 billion of export<br />
earnings. Now, sure, you could look at the debt picture<br />
and say it's bad and in some respects it is. But part of<br />
that represents, for instance, North West Shelf. They<br />
borrowed to get that, but now the ships are plying to and </p>
<p>from Japan, taking the LNG up there and earning us<br />
income. CARLTON: Alright, that's worthwhile investment, but<br />
this, this huge pile we had of borrowings upon<br />
borrowings. Some of these corporations getting into<br />
mountains of debt so that they could buy more debt, the<br />
average bloke is paying for that in his home mortgage<br />
rate isn't he?<br />
PM: Well, it's not a question of the average bloke<br />
paying for that in his home mortgage rate. The country<br />
as a whole, as a whole, in the last year we spent the<br />
increase in spending was eight percent and because of the<br />
inadequate structure that had been built up over the<br />
years we could only produce another four percent more and<br />
that gap came from imports. And we just, as a community,<br />
couldn't keep importing that much and I think the<br />
community understands. I'm moving around amongst them<br />
and they're saying well yes we understand that you had to<br />
slow things down, we don't like the fact that it's<br />
hurting us, and I understand that. But it wasn't as<br />
though we didn't have, you know, tight fiscal policy, the<br />
tightest in history and we had a tight wages policy. All<br />
that was left was having to increase the tightness of<br />
monetary policy, but we've done that. But now the<br />
banking sector itself is saying, not just Bob Hawke, that<br />
interest rates are going to come down and they are.<br />
CARLTON: You reckon? I mean<br />
PM: Well it's not just a question of I reckon, I mean<br />
they've started to come down and the banking sector<br />
itself is saying they're going to come down.<br />
CARLTON: Alright, but they're about to go up in Japan<br />
and the United States and I cannot believe that we can<br />
bring ours down if the Japanese and the Americans are<br />
putting theirs up.<br />
PM: Well we've already got the situation here where the<br />
cost of money, I mean, in the end the determinant is the<br />
cost of the money to the banking system and the cost of<br />
money, of money to them is coming down. When the cost of<br />
money to them comes down then inevitably, as they<br />
recognise, so does what they charge come down.<br />
CARLTON: But surely<br />
PM: Now that's their statement. They expect rates to<br />
come down and so do I because we have been the ones who<br />
have had our fiscal policy tight. I mean, in other<br />
words, we've wiped out the deficit, we've made a<br />
reduction in the demand that the public sector makes upon<br />
savings a massive change-around and over, over the<br />
period we've been in office a turnaround of about<br />
billion. So we've vacated to that extent the savings<br />
sector. Our demand, so, tighter fiscal policy, tight </p>
<p>wages policy and we haven't relied on monetary policy<br />
alone. And the decisions that have been made, mean that<br />
interest rates will come down.<br />
CARLTON: Well why should anyone believe a word you're<br />
saying? I mean, you've promised<br />
PM: Well<br />
CARLTON: before that interest rates will come down.<br />
PM: Well all I can say is that you're not just relying<br />
on me and I think you should rely on that, but I repeat,<br />
why do you not believe what the banking sector says? And<br />
the banking sector says, as a result of what we've done,<br />
interest rates are coming down. Now that's the banking<br />
sector saying it.<br />
CARLTON: You could also get some parts of the banking<br />
sector say it was a quick fiddle, a quick fix before<br />
the election.<br />
PM: No. The overwhelming statement of the banking<br />
sector, you look at the Stuart Fowlers, the whole lot of<br />
them, they've said the conditions have been created for<br />
interest rates to come down and the important contrast is<br />
this I mean, as you recognise it in your questioning,<br />
whether rates can come down or not depends upon what's<br />
happening at other instruments of policy.<br />
CARLTON: Yes.<br />
PM: And as against what we've demonstrated, that is that<br />
we will pay and pay over the next three years for<br />
whatever commitments, spending commitments, we've got<br />
we've done that now. We have demonstrated what we're<br />
going to spend, we pay for by savings. Against that the<br />
Opposition have got a $ 6 billion hole, $ 6 billion and<br />
they've got a wages blowout. So with a blowout in the<br />
deficit and a blowout in wages, inevitably under them,<br />
interest rates must rise.<br />
CARLTON: Do you regret that promise last campaign that<br />
no Australian child will live in poverty by 1990?<br />
PM: I regret that the full statement that was in the<br />
accompanying statement was not the words I used in the<br />
abbreviated speech. But if you look at the as you<br />
know, you've seen it in the full statement I said<br />
there'll be no financial need. And I'm proud of the<br />
fact, proud of the fact that the Brotherhood of St<br />
Lawrence, the Institute of Family Studies, have said that<br />
that promise, which has involved may I say the payment of<br />
more than $ 2 billion per annum, that promise has been<br />
met. There's no financial need. Now what we've got to<br />
do as a community, not just my Government but the States<br />
and the local governments and community organisations,<br />
we ' ye now got to make sure that we deliver the services </p>
<p>as well as paying this money which we're paying which<br />
meets the financial targets. We've got to make sure that<br />
all the services are delivered which mean that for<br />
whatever variety of circumstances may exist where the<br />
money is not getting through, that the kids get looked<br />
after. But Bishop Hollingworth of the Brotherhood of St<br />
Lawrence to Brisbane, put it best. He said the<br />
Opposition should really acknowledge the very substantial<br />
merit of the what the Hawke Government has done in this<br />
and stop making political capital out<br />
CARLTON: There's still a lot of kids sleeping out at the<br />
Cross PM: There's still a situation where in this country it<br />
is recognised by those in the welfare sector that more is<br />
being done and the promise of meeting those financial<br />
targets have been met. Why don't you observe that under<br />
the situation where I am now paying over $ 2 billion a<br />
year to low income families that that means 1.2 million<br />
kids and half a million families, look what it means for<br />
a low income family so it's not just big figures of Hawke<br />
talking about $ 2 billion. Let's take a family, a single<br />
income family on $ 320 with these kids. They now get $ 111<br />
a week tax free which is equivalent to a wage increase of<br />
$ 170 a week. Now that's the reality. And as distinct<br />
from the political cynicism of our opponents who refuse<br />
to acknowledge that $ 2 billion and more that's been paid<br />
where it's needed, I take enormous pleasure out of when<br />
I'm moving around where mothers are coming up to me and<br />
saying Mr Hawke that saved us.<br />
CARLTON: Can we get to the wage-tax deal out of<br />
yesterday.<br />
That figure of $ 50 a week, thrown around, a bit like<br />
the<br />
bunyip. That's a mythical beast isn't it?<br />
PM: No, it's not. If you want to look at it, if you<br />
want to be bored with the components of it I'll go<br />
through it.<br />
CARLTON: Well let's take one. $ 16 of it is already in<br />
the pipeline.<br />
PM: It's coming through I mean it's not staying there<br />
in the pipeline. It's coming through in this period that<br />
we're talking about out of arrangements that were made<br />
before. What was done was that you had your award<br />
restructuring principles brought in which gave you staged<br />
increases, staged increases through the restructuring<br />
principle. And in this period that we're talking about,<br />
out of those arrangements that were coming in<br />
approximately $ 16 a week will come in in this period. So<br />
don't you count it?<br />
CARLTON: Yes, but it's not a brand new gift from the<br />
Treasurer is it? That 16' s been there for a while. </p>
<p>PM: It hasn't. It's come through in this period. it<br />
was negotiated, it was negotiated before. And if we're<br />
talking about what the increases will be in this period<br />
ahead, $ 16 a week on average will come from the<br />
arrangements that were negotiated before. I mean the<br />
people are going to get it in their pocket.<br />
CARLTON: But we don't get the tax cut though till what,<br />
January next year?<br />
PM: From the first of January, in the period that we're<br />
talking about.<br />
CARLTON: And we don't get the second wage rise until<br />
June next year.<br />
PM: Yes, but we're asking I mean what people want to<br />
know and certainly what business wants to know, making<br />
our calculations, is Michael, what's going to be the<br />
aggregate wage movement in that period? And if you look<br />
at that then you've got to take account of the elements<br />
that will operate in that period. And it's accepted that<br />
in that period there'll be this seven per cent increase<br />
on average in the aggregate wage outcome. That is what<br />
will affect both the people in terms of the receipt,<br />
their capacity to buy things, and it will be what affects<br />
the employers in respect of the cost figures that they<br />
will have facing them.<br />
CARLTON: That depends very heavily, doesn't it, on<br />
getting inflation down to six per cent?<br />
PM: That's the assessment that's made. Now let me<br />
CARLTON: You've inflation targets yet. got it<br />
wrong for seven years.<br />
PM: Now wait a minute. We've got our wages outcome<br />
right on every occasion. And as Paul said, I think very<br />
accurately and eloquently during yesterday and last night<br />
when he was questioned about this, it is the case that we<br />
had, you know, an excessive explosion of demand in this<br />
most recent period which we admit put our estimates out.<br />
But let's go to what the Treasury, not Paul Keating or<br />
Bob Hawke, are saying. At the end of December in their<br />
last official roundup, the Treasury said that the<br />
underlying rate of inflation was 5.7.<br />
CARLTON: Well they've been happily wrong for seven years<br />
too on inflation haven't they.<br />
PM: No, they, basically their estimates overall have<br />
been fairly good. But I concede, and everyone has<br />
conceded in the private and the public sector, that<br />
during 1989 and through from the end of ' 88 and into ' 89,<br />
that we all underestimated the strength of demand. Now<br />
in that situation you've got to ask yourself now what's </p>
<p>happening now. Have you still got the high levels of<br />
demand. Answer no. Demand is coming down and we've<br />
conceded that before. Demand is coming down. And in<br />
those circumstances with the Treasury saying at the end<br />
of last year the underlying rate was 5.7, 1 believe that<br />
the figure of six per cent is realistic.<br />
CARLTON: Can we turn to the politics of it all now, away<br />
from the money. The overwhelming reaction I'm getting<br />
from listeners at the moment is they would quite like to<br />
get rid of you. They've had enough of you. Do you<br />
detect that?<br />
PM: No I don't. I mean I do detect that there is some<br />
cynicism about politics generally. I'm not denying that.<br />
Certainly Australia is experiencing what the rest of the<br />
world is, Mike, in regard to one aspect of that, that<br />
there is no doubt that the environmental vote or concern<br />
is increasing in this country, as it is everywhere in the<br />
world. CARLTON: There's a second leg to my question While<br />
they would quite like to get rid of you, they are not at<br />
all in any way convinced that Andrew Peacock is a<br />
sufficient reason for doing it. Do you detect that?<br />
PM: Well all our polling is what the public polling<br />
shows. But I'm not I understand that Andrew's coming<br />
on air later but I'm not here to personally attack the<br />
Leader of the opposition, go to him as an individual.<br />
But there is no doubt that all the polling, publicly and<br />
our own, shows that they don't accept the Leader of the<br />
Opposition as an alternative and that we are,<br />
importantly, that on the issues of management of the<br />
economy and a range of economic issues, and most<br />
importantly on the environment, they just won't have a<br />
bar of the Opposition and the Leader of the Opposition.<br />
If you look at the environment, I mean this is an issue<br />
that I want to have very much in the forefront of<br />
people' s minds. Because, funnily, when you talk about<br />
the environment you're talking about the future and<br />
you're talking about the past. The environment is one<br />
area where you cannot undo the mistakes of the past. You<br />
raised Mr Peacock and myself. Let me just say this to<br />
your listeners. If Mr Peacock rather than Bob Hawke had<br />
been Prime Minister the Franklin would be dammed, Kakadu<br />
would be mined, the Daintree would be logged. Now I've<br />
saved the Franklin, I've saved the Daintree Rainforest,<br />
I've saved Kakadu from mining, I've saved the forests of<br />
Tasmania and I've stopped that awful Wesley Vale mill<br />
that was going to pollute Tassie. Those things are the<br />
future. And it's one of the issues, one of the reasons<br />
Mike why, while they may not be happy with all that I've<br />
done, and I understand that. Because we've had<br />
CARLTON: I think a lot of them are fed up with all that<br />
you've done. I'm not trying to be rude or nasty.<br />
There's disillusionment out there.. </p>
<p>PM: Ok, there's an element of that. But let me say<br />
this. I wonder Mike whether you ask whether they are<br />
disillusioned with the fact let's take the categories.<br />
Let's look at the young and the old. When I came to<br />
office only one in three of our kids were staying on in<br />
school, because the prejudices and the preferences of the<br />
conservatives was to look after the privileged. Only one<br />
of our kids in three stayed on. Now it's two out of<br />
three. I wonder, in respect of the aged whether you had<br />
a situation that when we came to office only 22.7% of the<br />
pensioner representative earnings. Now those will be<br />
over 25%, higher than it's been for 40 years. These<br />
things all I can say to you is that when I go around,<br />
as recently as yesterday, people saying thanks for what<br />
you've done. Sure, I understand the concern. I would<br />
rather we'd had a position where we didn't have to have<br />
high interest rates for a period. But we had to.<br />
CARLTON: I bet you would.<br />
PM: Why would I want to hurt people? Why would I want<br />
to hurt myself. But in the end if I hadn't done it we<br />
would've had an economy like the one I inherited, with<br />
the worst recession in 50 years. Now you can't have a<br />
perfect world where you' re going to be able to give<br />
everyone what they want. What you've got to do is to<br />
commit yourself to the hard decisions which are going to<br />
have a competitive economy in an increasingly competitive<br />
world. And that's what's happening. I mean in the last<br />
couple of years, 14% increase in real terms in<br />
manufactured exports. We now have Australian enterprises<br />
going out where they never could before and taking on and<br />
beating the rest of the world.<br />
CARLTON: Yes, you've also going broke at a bigger<br />
rate than ever before too.<br />
PM: On the contrary. We've got a situation, I mean you<br />
certainly can't say that. They've got the highest profit<br />
share than they've had before as a result of the<br />
restraint that's been exercised by your listeners and a<br />
whole range of people. That means our enterprises are now<br />
increasing their manufactured exports in a way they've<br />
never been able to do before.<br />
CARLTON: Last question. Is a vote for you eventually a<br />
vote for Paul Keating or will you stay out a full term as<br />
Prime Minister?<br />
PM: I will serve out the full term as Prime Minister.<br />
CARLTON: No deals?<br />
PM: No deals. And I think Paul put it right. A vote<br />
for Bob Hawke is a vote for Bob Hawke and a vote for<br />
Andrew Peacock is a vote for Andrew Peacock. </p>
