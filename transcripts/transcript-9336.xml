PARTIAL TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
SPEECH TO THE TOURISM TASK FORCE, PARK GRAND HOTEL SYDNEY<br />
FRIDAY 26 AUGUST 1994<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
This program has already brought about the splendid restoration of the Old Treasury<br />
Building in Melbourne, a great example of what can be achieved when We get cool~<br />
e-rtion from State Governments. I know that Jeffrey Is going to do his best to<br />
claim all that for himself, but that's par for the course.<br />
The Customs House here In Sydney, which Is now I'm happy to say, part of a very<br />
important public debate, is one of the city's oldest and best loved buildings, is another<br />
heritage building receiving assistance. Under the program the Federal Government<br />
Is providing $ 24 million towards its restoration so It can serve as an important tourist<br />
and ' cultural c-entre, and I'm very pleased can I say, that with the debate that we have<br />
had on this building, that It's engendered the debate about East Circular Quay and I'm<br />
delighted that we are able to work with the Lord Mayor who has shown a tremendous<br />
amount of leadership In this, and the various authorities and the owners, to get a<br />
really first-class result on the buildings that abut the Opera House, which Is arguably<br />
the most Important building easily the most Important building in the country anid<br />
arguably the most important building built In the 1960s anywhere in the world.<br />
And I think It Is you know that the debate now about Circular Quay and the<br />
government of New South Wales has Invited public comment about how it might be<br />
developed but I will be seeing the Premier next week and I think it should be<br />
possible for the NSW and Commonwealth Governments to agree on a regime which<br />
gives some focus to Circular Quay, and makes the Customs House the central focus<br />
as the central civic building of the Quayside, and hopefully develops a square In front<br />
of it that lets all the people of this country come to the Quay not to view it, if you like,<br />
at the margin from the overseas terminal, or on the way around the Opera House, but<br />
centrally, In the central part of a central site of the city. </p>
<p>And this Is going to take some... think it~ s a proposition that can really come to life,<br />
but it does mean removing the Cahill Expressway and I think we can remove it at a<br />
very acceptable cost. At any rate, the Commonwealth is prepared to do this. And I<br />
think the Important thing about it Is that with the Olympics coming in the year 2000,<br />
it's Important that when the Olympics come and go~ that we leave things behind for<br />
the city and for the country, and this key tourism site in Australia Circular Quay, the<br />
Opera House I think getting that focus now and the opportunity of the Games, is<br />
something that we shouldn't let pass. There are other things that I'm speaking to<br />
NSW about, which are about the city of Sydney the Expressway as it leaves that<br />
part of the city and goes down towards Woolloomooloo Bay, as you know divides the<br />
Domain from the Gardens, which were once one single area, and there's a discussion<br />
going about burying that roadway so that it no longer divides that green space in the<br />
city. All these things, I think, are going to be important. But as well as East Circular<br />
Quay, we've got the GPO and Martin Place, and the Commonwealth has been<br />
involved I've been involved myself to see that It Is sympathetically developed, and<br />
that again, in this key precinct of the city and Martin Place, in what is one of the most<br />
important heritage buildings, the uses not yet defined, probably a hotel, but one that<br />
will sit with some sympathy and comfort with the site. And again, I'm indebted to the<br />
Lord Mayor and the Sydney City Planning Authority, in dealing with this and of course<br />
Austr-alia Post which has cooperated in trying to -get a decent development.<br />
ends. </p>
