PRESS STATEMENT NO. 240<br />
26 April 1974<br />
THE CONSUMER AND COLOUR TELEVISION<br />
The Prime Minister today referred to recent press reports<br />
that consideration was being given by Government agencies to the<br />
application of import quotas to Japanese colour television sets.<br />
The Prime Minister said that these reports did not reflect the<br />
Government' s attitude.<br />
The Government believed that the Australian consumer<br />
deserved free access to Japanese Pal television receivers subject,<br />
of course, to the tariff protection given to the local industry by<br />
the Government after the Tariff Board reported on consumer electronic<br />
equipment and components late last year. The tariff on these goods<br />
is at a relatively high level of 35%. This is the basis upon which<br />
negotiations with AWA and AEG-Telefunken are proceeding.<br />
The Prime Minister said that two of the main objectives of<br />
the tariff assistance provided to the Australian consumer electronics<br />
industry are to provide the Australian consumer with<br />
a wide range of cheaper electrical goods,<br />
including colour television sets; and<br />
to provide the basis for greater specialisation<br />
in the relevant sections of the Australian industry<br />
with consequent benefits for the nation as a whole.<br />
Mr Whitlam said that in its report on the consumer electronics<br />
industry late last year the Tariff Board had said<br />
" At the recommended-rates of duty on components and<br />
complete receivers the Board believes that local<br />
manufacturers in a rationalised industry would<br />
dominate the medium to large screen size market for<br />
colour television. It is in this segment that the<br />
majority of demand is expected to occur. The<br />
recommended duties are not expected to cover the<br />
cost disabilities of Australian manufacturers<br />
producing the small screen sizes of television<br />
receivers."<br />
Mr Whitlam said that imports from Japan were expected to play<br />
a major role in meeting consumer demand for the smaller-screen sized<br />
sets., / 2 </p>

He said that the negotiations with AWA and AEG-Telefunken<br />
were an integral part of a total policy aimed at greatly improving<br />
the position of the Australian consumer, particularly in the early<br />
years of colour television. The Government's policy which provides<br />
appropriate protection for Australian workers and industry, would<br />
benefit Australian industry by encouraging it to specialise in areas<br />
where it is best able to operate.<br />
