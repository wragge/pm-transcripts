RESUMPTION OF BOM~ BING IN NORTH VIET NAM<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister. Mr. Harold Holt<br />
President Johnson has made a statement about the<br />
resumption of bombing in North Viet Na,, a directed against<br />
installations and transport routes used for the conduct of<br />
warfare in South Viet Nam.<br />
The bombing was suspended in December, even though<br />
an earlier pause in bombing last May had evoked no positive<br />
response, and even though there were strong military reasons<br />
for the continuance of bombing. The North Vietnamese authorities<br />
had, for a period of months, increased the rate of infiltration<br />
of armed men to South Viet Nam. In the last six months of<br />
1965, many thousands of North Vietnamese soldiers entered South<br />
Viet Nam as units and equipped for open warfare.<br />
The purpose of the bombing has been not to destroy<br />
the regime in Hanoi or break the economy of North Viet Nam, or<br />
to shatter the basis of the people's livelihood, uit to damage or<br />
destroy those military installations and facilities which enable<br />
Hanoi to supply and support its own forces in the South and those<br />
of the Viet Cong. The suspension of the bombing was of a very subtantial<br />
military and political significance. It meant a self-imposed<br />
denial by the United States of the use of a valuable military<br />
weapon. It was part of a programme of action designed to<br />
encourage North Viet Nam to turn back from its course of<br />
incrc; asingly open military intervention in South Viet Nam. Having<br />
suspended the bombing, the United States undertook active<br />
diplomatic efforts to make knwn its genuine wish for an end to<br />
the warfare and for discussion leading to a just solution by<br />
peaceful means. Governments of communist countries and of nonaligned<br />
countries which might possess some influence in Peking<br />
and Hanoi were approached. Direct contacts were made in some<br />
capitals where the United States and North Viet Nam were both<br />
represented. From Washington and Saigon, the Australian Government<br />
was kept fully informed of these developments. Mr. Averell<br />
Harriman visited Canberra for discussions with us. The approaches<br />
made by the United States were widely welcomed throughout the world,<br />
but regrettably, brought no sign of any disposition on the part<br />
of the other side to modify its determination to continue the war.<br />
On the contrary, the North Vietnamese took advantage of the<br />
respite from bombing to repair and improve their system of / 2 </p>
<p>2-<br />
infiltration. considerable volume of traffic has passed through<br />
this system into South Viet Narn. Certainly in larger volume and at a<br />
faster rate than would have been possible if bombing had been<br />
continued to impede it.<br />
Private contacts brought forth no positive responses.<br />
Peking, Hanoi and the Liberation Front have denounced the United<br />
States efforts, describing them as a manouevre to cover up an<br />
intensification and expansion of aggressive war in Viet Nam. The<br />
Liberation Front pledges itself " to make greater efforts to strike<br />
harder at the heads of the aggressors, deal them heavier punishments,<br />
and make them realise that their only honourable path at the present<br />
time is a quick withdrawal from South Viet Nam."<br />
The latest United States initiatives have-thus been<br />
rejected as summarily and emphatically as have other efforts made in<br />
the past. It has consistently been the view of the Australian<br />
Government that N~ orth Viet Narn must not be permitted to remain a<br />
haven immune from military risk, from which military aggression<br />
against the South can be mounted with impunity. Because we believe<br />
North Viet Namn cannot be left free to mount military operations<br />
against South Viet Namn and against the American, Australian, New<br />
Zealand and Korean soldiers who are helping to defend the country, we<br />
firmly support the American decision as realistic and necessary.<br />
It remains our hope, however, that the North Vietnamese and those<br />
associated with them will recognise that their aggression will not<br />
be allowed to succeed. We must hope that the time is not distant<br />
when they will join in finding a just and peaceful solution.<br />
While the aggression continues, it will be met firmly by resistance<br />
in which Australia will play its part. 1N1kneo w that the United States<br />
will remain alert and ready to explore any indication of willingness<br />
on the other side to move towards a settlement on just terms.<br />
The United States readiness in this respect is<br />
indicated by the request of the United States Government for an<br />
urgent meeting of the Security Council toconsider the situation in<br />
Viet Namn.<br />
