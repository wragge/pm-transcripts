    <content><![CDATA[<p>Well Mr Ticehurst, Ken Ticehurst, the Mayor, ladies and gentlemen. I'm very pleased to be at this project and to have explained to me in a little more detail how the North Wyong GP hospital integration project, which is in effect trialling a new model of primary healthcare in this part of the Central Coast of New South Wales.  This outcome has been the result of intense negotiation between the local division of general practice, the New South Wales Government, the Commonwealth Government and the University of Newcastle. And I want to commend everybody that's been involved and I'm announcing today the recommitment of the Commonwealth Government with an additional funding contribution of $50,000 over and above the funding contribution that the Commonwealth Government has made in the past.</p>
<p> Having had the operation of the centre explained to me, I'm quite excited that this is another example of how different models of healthcare are being trialled around Australia.  We do have a changed structure in the medical profession, there are more and more doctors who work part time.  The old perception of a full time overwhelmingly male GP working all hours of the day and night has changed.  The medical workforce in Australia has become increasingly feminised and we have to adopt, because of all of those changes, we have to adopt new models and approaches and I'm particularly struck by the on site involvement of the university and to have a research GP and to have this project providing primary healthcare research data and to have the university working closely with the medical practitioners and to be reassured that it's a project that will attract medical practitioners, not from the immediate catchment area but from elsewhere and therefore not affect the provision of GP services on the Central Coast, that's very important. That meets one of the objectives we've had in our strengthening Medicare policy of making sure that we address areas of doctor shortage, and there is a shortage of doctors on the Central Coast, and the measures that we introduced earlier this year, the practice nurses, the additional payments in relation to GP bulk billing consultations for certain categories of people, the workforce measures, all of those things are making a big contribution towards addressing the doctor shortage.  And this is another opportunity for me to reaffirm the very strong commitment that this Government has to the maintenance and the strengthening of Medicare. I'm very proud of the fact that in recent months we have introduced measures which have been designed to lift the level of bulk billing and the figures we had a few months ago indicated that that process had started. I'm also very proud of the introduction of the Medicare safety net, that Medicare safety net is a very important reassurance to people because it provides 80 per cent of the excess over the thresholds of $300 and $700 for out of pocket, out of hospital expenses and that takes an enormous load off people, particularly families who encounter unexpected illnesses with their children.  We are a government that's committed to a system where there is a place for both the public and the private component, we believe in both, we believe in a medical system that has Medicare underpinned and strengthened and we also have a strong contribution from the private sector as well and that's why we've introduced additional rewards for older people who have private health insurance because the stronger sector the greater the load is taken off the public hospital system.  The stronger Medicare, the greater the load is taken off the public hospital system.</p>
<p> So I congratulate all of those associated with this project, particularly the medical practitioners and the university and it's a good example of co-operation between the Federal Government and State Government, I mean sometimes Federal and State Governments don't co-operate but on this occasion they have and that's very, very important and it's in everybody's interest that that happens.  The public is not interested in blame shifting, the public is interested in good outcomes and this will provide a very good outcome over time for people on the Central Coast. And could I say that Ken Ticehurst has been an indefatigable advocate and he approached Tony Abbott and exhorted Tony Abbott to get further involved in this and I thank both of them for their energy and for their commitment. And while I'm here I'd like to announce that the Commonwealth proposes to open a new Medicare office in Tuggerah.  We have carried out a survey of the needs of Medicare offices around Australia and it's based on the changing demographic profile of the Central Coast and the need to provide greater convenience, given the volume of customers and the offices give of course people even greater access to the Medicare facilities.  We expect that it could be opened within six months, depending on the availability of suitable premises and it will of course employ some additional staff to deliver the Medicare services.</p>
<p>   So my friends I wish the North Wyong GP hospital integration project well, I reaffirm the commitment of the Commonwealth of the additional funding over and above the existing commitment of some $50,000 and I especially thank Ken Ticehurst for his great energy and commitment to this project.</p>
<p> Thank you.</p>
