<p>MUNRO:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, thanks for your time. How disturbed are you by this</p>
<p> latest spate of shootings and deaths across Australia?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh, look any person is, not just the Prime Minister, but the whole</p>
<p> of the Australian community is always shocked and I suppose the thing</p>
<p> that shocks me most and most Australians are the apparent triviality</p>
<p> of a couple of the events. I mean, to murder somebody over an argument</p>
<p> about the heating of a Chiko roll, I mean, it's just appalling.</p>
<p>MUNRO:</p>
<p>Does it demonstrate a weakness in our new gun laws?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I don't think you can necessarily draw that conclusion. The new</p>
<p> gun laws were only agreed to a couple of years ago and the buy back</p>
<p> was only completed in the latter part of last year. So, it's</p>
<p> too early to make a judgement as to whether the new national gun laws</p>
<p> are effective. I believe they are but you will need to wait a period</p>
<p> of a number of years and to observe the trends over that period of</p>
<p> time before you can make a judgement.</p>
<p>MUNRO:</p>
<p>Is that because you might be concerned that the States are slowly</p>
<p> but surely watering down the gun laws through adjustments and fine-tuning?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, there are a couple of areas where changes have been made but</p>
<p> I think watering down is too strong a description although I make</p>
<p> it very clear on your programme that we will use any power at our</p>
<p> disposal to prevent any serious watering down of those laws. And we</p>
<p> have, in fact, withheld some compensation payments to at least one</p>
<p> of the States because they have diverged slightly from the rules that</p>
<p> were agreed to at the National Police Ministers' Conference following</p>
<p> Port Arthur. I mean, we are treading on Constitutional egg shells</p>
<p> in a sense on this because we don't have any direct power. But</p>
<p> there is a lot of community support for the toughest gun laws possible,</p>
<p> however, we have got to keep it in proportion. Appalling though the</p>
<p> events of the last few days have been, our murder rate is not as bad</p>
<p> as a lot of other countries, (inaudible).. but any murder is one too</p>
<p> many and any loss of life is appalling and distresses everybody and</p>
<p> the feeling of vulnerability that people have is very natural.</p>
<p>MUNRO:</p>
<p>Of course guns and drugs often go hand in hand as you know. Is it</p>
<p> important to separate them as issues?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, in a way it is. I think the only way you can tackle the drug</p>
<p> problem is on three levels. I think you have to have tough law enforcement.</p>
<p> No society will accept the idea of just saying it's too hard</p>
<p> therefore we give in. I mean, that is basically what some people are</p>
<p> saying.</p>
<p>MUNRO:</p>
<p>Including zero tolerance?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, zero tolerance is a generic term which has grown out of some</p>
<p> police practices in New York. I think it's important to have</p>
<p> a look at what's happened there. I mean, New York had a horrific</p>
<p> reputation for crime 20 years ago but over the last few years they</p>
<p> have been very successful in getting that horrific rate down to more</p>
<p> manageable levels. So if you are interested in, sort of, crime prevention</p>
<p> generally it's worth having a look at. But when I talk about</p>
<p> zero tolerance in relation to drugs I mean you shouldn't tolerate</p>
<p> them in schools and you shouldn't tolerate the dealers, you don't</p>
<p> give them any tolerance. You certainly understand that people who</p>
<p> are addicted have a problem. And I think you have got to have three</p>
<p> things, you have got to have law enforcement, you have got to have</p>
<p> education and that really starts in the home with every parent telling</p>
<p> their children about the dangers of drugs, and you have also got to</p>
<p> have effective rehabilitation programmes. And one of the things that</p>
<p> we have done at a federal level for the first time in a big way is</p>
<p> to make a lot of money available over the last year or so for rehabilitation</p>
<p> programmes.</p>
<p>MUNRO:</p>
<p>You accept that heroin is, as some people said, awash in Australia?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, you have got to, once again, keep it in proportion. Two per</p>
<p> cent of the population have used heroin. Now, that is two per cent</p>
<p> too much. But you have also got to keep a sense of proportion. I think</p>
<p> awash is a melodramatic word. The rate of heroin....of deaths from</p>
<p> heroin overdoses has certainly gone up.</p>
<p>MUNRO:</p>
<p>600 deaths, I think, in 1997.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes, in 1997. It has certainly gone up on what it was 10 years ago.</p>
<p> It is certainly a more serious problem than what it was and nobody</p>
<p> has the complete answer. I don't have the complete answer and</p>
<p> it has got to be a co-operative effort. I mean, the Prime Minister</p>
<p> can't solve it on his own and I am very happy to work with any</p>
<p> State Premier of any political description, it's not a party</p>
<p> political issue. I am not interested in having a slanging match with</p>
<p> any Premier about who has got the best idea. I am very interested</p>
<p> in talking with to Premiers and the Chief Ministers at the Premiers'</p>
<p> Conference in April and we will do our level best with resources.</p>
<p> We have already committed a lot more, I mean, no national government</p>
<p> has spent as much as we have on some of these aspects and that's</p>
<p> not a criticism of the former Labor Government. And I am interested</p>
<p> in some of the comments Mr Beazley has made about the heroin trial</p>
<p> in the last couple of days.</p>
<p>MUNRO:</p>
<p>Is there any way you would reconsider a heroin trial?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, not on the evidence that's available to me. I mean, the...look,</p>
<p> the evidence of heroin trials overseas at very best is quite ambiguous</p>
<p> and I would want to be persuaded that there were benefits and because</p>
<p> there are clear detriments in going down the path of the heroin trial</p>
<p> in terms of the signal you send to the community. Because some argue</p>
<p> that once you go down the path of a heroin trial, you know, if it</p>
<p> quote "works well" then the next step is towards legitimisation.</p>
<p>MUNRO:</p>
<p>I mean no disrespect [inaudible], but are you more concerned with</p>
<p> the moral implication of regulating heroin than perhaps saving all</p>
<p> the deaths?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, I am not. I am far more interested in getting rid of the drug</p>
<p> scourge because what drugs do is to take away the control that people</p>
<p> have over their own lives, particularly young people. And that concerns</p>
<p> me far more than the potential of death and depravation of the quality</p>
<p> of life, particularly for young people. It concerns me far more than</p>
<p> some abstract moral theory. That's not a disrespectful question,</p>
<p> it's a fair question and I am glad you asked it. I am not on</p>
<p> some kind of personal moral crusade on this, I am just as, I hope,</p>
<p> an ordinary, intelligent human being unconvinced that in the face</p>
<p> of this problem the way to go is to have a heroin trial. Now, I am</p>
<p> going to talk to the Director of the FBI on Friday. Now, I have been</p>
<p> criticised by some people for doing that but you know that in the</p>
<p> last 20 years there has been a 50 per cent reduction in drug use in</p>
<p> the United States. There's been a 40 per cent reduction in drug</p>
<p> related deaths since 1992 and there's been a 70 per cent reduction</p>
<p> in cocaine use since 1985. Now, the Americans have certainly not adopted</p>
<p> a soft approach to the drug problem. They have adopted a very tough</p>
<p> approach but they have also had education, they have also had rehabilitation</p>
<p> programmes. Now, I am not saying they're perfect but I would</p>
<p> want to be persuaded of benefit before I would reconsider my position</p>
<p> and I haven't been persuaded of that. And in any event the heroin</p>
<p> trial thing, in a sense, is a bit of a diversion because even those</p>
<p> people who support it don't claim for a moment that it's,</p>
<p> sort of, the answer to the problem.</p>
<p>MUNRO:</p>
<p>The New South Wales Director of Public Prosecutions, just finally,</p>
<p> today said that we can't beat the drug users and that 50 years</p>
<p> of prohibition hasn't worked. Victorian Premier Jeff Kennett</p>
<p> says a refusal to consider any new way is a head in the sand approach.</p>
<p> What do you say to that?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, my response to that is perhaps to have a look at some of the</p>
<p> experience in the United States. Those figures that I quoted...and</p>
<p> this is the country which is typically seen as having the biggest</p>
<p> drug problem in the world. Now, they haven't, apparently haven't</p>
<p> thrown up their hands and I just don't, I don't agree with</p>
<p> what Mr Cowdery has said nor I note does Mr Carr.</p>
<p>MUNRO:</p>
<p>Okay. Mr Howard, thank you very much for your time, we appreciate</p>
<p> you coming in.</p>
