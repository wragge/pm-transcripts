TRANSCRIPT OF DOORSTOP, SHANGRI-LA HOTEL, KUALA LUMPUR, 18<br />

E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
JOURNALIST: Are you both still confident?<br />
PM: I think that we are a little bit in front and I'm a<br />
betting man as you know, just occasionally. If I were<br />

JOURNALIST: Do you agree with that, Mr Fraser?<br />
FRASER: Yes well from what I think we both learned over the<br />
last two or three days the mood's improving so I certainly<br />
agree with it.<br />
