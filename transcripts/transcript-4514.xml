FOR PRESS 6 OCTOBER 1977<br />
AUSTRALIAN PUBLIC SERVICE INTERCHANGE PROGRAMME<br />
The Public Service Board has introduced an Interchange:<br />
Programme aimed at fostering mobility in the Public Service<br />
through arrangements such as secondments and exchanges.<br />
This follows the Board's introduction late last year of<br />
an Executive Development Scheme through which some twenty<br />
officers have been placed in work assignments in other<br />
departments, public services and the private sector.<br />
The introduc-tion-o-f the-Interchange Programme by the Board<br />
is in line with the views of the Royal Commission on<br />
Australian Government Administration. The Programme<br />
will involve exchanges, secondmnents and transfers of staff<br />
between the public and private sectors and between departments<br />
within the Australian Public Service.<br />
To support the Programme the Chairman of the Board is<br />
meeting with various leaders in the community to promote<br />
exchanges and discuss possible placements.<br />
The Government is actively supporting the Board in its<br />
fostering of staff exchanges believing that they are an<br />
important way of increasing mutual understanding and<br />
communication between different organisations allowing a<br />
sharing of expertise throughout the community and of contributing<br />
to the career development of those involved.<br />
The introduction of the Interchange Programme is an important,%<br />
positive and valuable step in improving understanding and<br />
extending communications between the sectors of Australian society. </p>
