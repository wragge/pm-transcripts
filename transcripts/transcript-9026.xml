PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING, MP<br />
DOORSTOP, ADELAIDE CONVENTION CENTRE, 8 NOVEMBER 1993<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
J: Mr Keating, you have walked into a State election campaign, you have<br />
often been critical of the States in the past of being fairly irresponsible<br />
with money, I suppose South Australia's performance, the performance<br />
of this Government has added weight to your claims, do you think it<br />
would be an indictment of the system to see a State government like<br />
this one returned?<br />
PM: I think contrary to your claim this Government is the one repairing the<br />
problem. This is the one which has now taken active steps, really<br />
active steps, to get South Australia's debt problem under control, and it<br />
was with Premier Lyn Arnold that I negotiated the $ 600 million<br />
payment from the Commonwealth to South Australia. Now, that was<br />
$ 600 million. That was a huge amount of money. And without it, of<br />
course, South Australia wouldn't have been able to repair its problem.<br />
That I negotiated with the Premier as part of the debt restructuring<br />
strategy before the last federal election, and it is Premier Arnold's<br />
Government which is actually moving the whole of the South Australian<br />
debt back into a reasonable position.<br />
J The polls show the true believers are deserting Labor in the State, do<br />
you think they should?<br />
PM: Well, look, the last one to take any notice of this will be the pundits,<br />
they're Invariably wrong in elections, and the public will, I think, look<br />
through this I mean, have a look at the Coalition. Here they say<br />
debt is a major problem here, but they are keeping mum about what<br />
they will do about it. What people would find out they'll do about it, is<br />
they would sock those least able to afford it to try and remedy the<br />
problem. Whereas, I think what the Premier and the Government have<br />
done here is say, ok, we have a problem, let's talk to the<br />
Commonwealth Government, let's negotiate a strategy and let's get it<br />
down. Let's get the debt under control. That's, I think, the far more </p>
<p>mature way to go with than the Liberals keeping some proposal up<br />
. their sleeve to pull out in the last days of an election campaign and let<br />
people repent at leisure later.<br />
J: Neal Blewett is planning to stand aside from federal politics, do you<br />
support giving him an overseas posting?<br />
PM: Well, that is not a matter for here, it is a matter for the longer run.<br />
J But do you believe that Neal Blewett will be leaving?<br />
P M; Well, that's a matter for him, I think. Neal has had a very long service<br />
now, and a meritorious service can I say, and in all spheres of public<br />
life people will take the opportunity to change careers, and he may well<br />
do.<br />
J: Are you happy to be ahead of Dr Hewson in the polls now?<br />
PM: Well, they go up and down these things. You can't take too much<br />
notice of them.<br />
J: Governments tend to stand or fall on their record, don't you accept the<br />
Royal Commission's finding that this State government in large part,<br />
was responsible for the problems that now face it?<br />
PMV: Well, I think, Premier Bannon took that responsibility to himself, and<br />
accepted it. Premier Arnold was elected to repair the problem, and it<br />
has been repairing the problem that he has. Did you notice in the<br />
Federal Election that the Federal Liberal party would make no<br />
commitment of funding to South Australia? Did you notice that the<br />
State Opposition Leader was unable to procure any financial funding<br />
from the Commonwealth under a Coalition Government? That's not<br />
true of Premier Arnold. I mean, he and I negotiated the $ 600 million.<br />
Let me just repeat that number $ 600 million. It seems that you guys<br />
won't talk about it, $ 600 million, which the Commonwealth has<br />
advanced to the people of South Australia,<br />
J: Yes Prime Minister, that got you re-elected.<br />
PM: No, it is not a matter of getting re-elected. Thank you, no, for the<br />
cynicism. This State had a problem which it was not able to repair on<br />
its own account. Lyn Arnold understood that and approached the<br />
Commonwealth and we sat down and sought to remedy the problem.<br />
We have now got it back where its debt trajectory will come under<br />
control. It doesn't need a Liberal government with a secret plan to<br />
knock everyone over the head to do that. </p>
<p>J* Mr Keating, this Government has presided over a $ 3 billion disaster<br />
with the State Bank, you're saying that people should still vote for this<br />
Government, what is the cut off point?<br />
PM: What I am saying is that was the Bannon Government and, I think, this<br />
Government decided, this Government, the Arnold Government,<br />
decided that prudence demanded, that a debt management strategy<br />
be undertaken. I just don't think it is right to say that this Government<br />
was the one that created the problem. I mean this one is now<br />
remedying it.<br />
J: This Government, Mr Keating, is the Bannon Government minus Mr<br />
Bannon over the last eleven years, that's all this Government is.<br />
PM: Well the fact of the matter is that the Government is pursuing a<br />
strategy which is now about dealing with this problem, in the belief in<br />
the first instance that leaving these matters with financial institutions<br />
was the right and proper thing to do. As it turned out whenever a<br />
Government has ultimate responsibility for funds that they are best<br />
with some knowledge of what is happening within these financial<br />
institutions. Now, it turns out the former view was a mistaken view.<br />
But having accepted that, the Government has now made changes to<br />
give South Australia a debt situation which you can bring under<br />
control. What I would say to you is, no other Party and no other<br />
Government was, in fact, capable of negotiating that with the<br />
Commonwealth, and that would not be the happy position South<br />
Australia is now in.<br />
J: Both major parties are basing their debt reduction strategies on 4 per<br />
cent growth, Is that a bit ambitious, you are talking about 3.3 per cent,<br />
in a report the other day, 3 per cent?<br />
PM: We grew over 3.3 for the year to June, I mean, these are matters for<br />
judgement, But again, I am not privy to the figuring in the these things.<br />
J: Has the wine tax and the petrol tax done irreparable harm to Arnold's<br />
chances?<br />
PM: I don't think so. Look, I have just given figures a moment ago, the wine<br />
industry's exports are growing, we have exported more in the month of<br />
September than we did in the whole year of 1985-86. Now, I<br />
remember when the wine tax was introduced in the 1 980s, I introduced<br />
It. It was then going to be, sort of disaster for the wine industry. It has<br />
gone from strength to strength ever since. Thank you.<br />
