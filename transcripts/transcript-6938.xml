PRIME MINISTER<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW WITH JOHN LAWS 2GB -30 MAY 1986<br />
JOHN LAWS: We talked earlier today at some length of the<br />
government's political and economic problems<br />
at the moment,* the pressure is on the government,<br />
whether they see it as being a problem or<br />
accept it as being a problem I don't know.<br />
In a nutshell, it's got to get business investing<br />
in new production to compete with imports<br />
arnd to sell manufactured goods overseas, it's<br />
got to cut a swath through the government's<br />
spending. If I was a government, I'd see those things<br />
as problems.<br />
It's also got to try and persuade the unions<br />
to accept even further reductions in the unit<br />
costs of Labor, wage cuts in other words,<br />
and it's also got to overcome a growing swell<br />
of opinion to suggest that the government<br />
is in some sort of political bother.<br />
Now, like it or dislike it, that is an opinion<br />
that exists, especially over the fringe benefits<br />
tax, but also over,' what's perceived to be a<br />
split in the ranks between the prime minister<br />
and the treasurer.. </p>
<p>0", -2-<br />
Divisions in the party Over Policy of course<br />
will surface with some vigour in July at the<br />
party's national conference and that will provide<br />
I imaginie a little more political bother. maybe<br />
it won't, but I suggest it would.<br />
But now Paul K( eating has been out and about<br />
trying to repair the apparent split between<br />
himself and the prime minister by saying if<br />
there was a misunderstanding, then they are<br />
now understood, but then he seemed to tip<br />
himself into hot water again, he couldn't resist<br />
saying the real culprits were the prime minister's<br />
minders. Without naming them, I suppose he meant<br />
Peter Barren and Bob Hogg, former ALP state<br />
secretary, and press secretary, Geoff Walsh.<br />
The prime minister is on the line now, and<br />
I assume he knows that we were going to broach<br />
that subject.<br />
I imagine when you were in China you were<br />
pretty tired, must have been jet lagged apart<br />
from anything else and having a busy time,<br />
do you think in reference to the fellows who<br />
do look after you when you're travelling and<br />
elsewhere, do you think that they perhaps<br />
got you a little too geed up in China through<br />
a misunderstanding of what Paul Keating had<br />
said both about the mini-summit and about<br />
the statements he made to me? </p>
<p>-3<br />
BOB . HAWKFE: They haven't got me, either then or at any<br />
other tm, geed up. My only concern was<br />
and properly to see that there wasn't undue<br />
expectations engendered about what that meeting<br />
of ACPI could do.<br />
I said. and repeat to you, that I believe that<br />
Ralph Willis and Paul Keating, the ministers<br />
attending that meeting, did absolutely appropriately<br />
in responding to the suggestion which arose<br />
at the meeting that perhaps they should meet<br />
again and have a somewhat wider discussion.<br />
That was very sensible and proper In accordance<br />
with government policy that they should have<br />
responded in that way.<br />
But then from that response, and one way<br />
and another, there developed fairly quickly<br />
a view that we were going to have another<br />
summit or its equivalent and my concern-simply<br />
was to hoe that down.<br />
The meeting of ACPI, that extended new meeting,<br />
wouldn't have had and will not have the capacity<br />
to negotiate agreements or to formulate new<br />
policies and I really wanted that to be underist6od.<br />
LAWS: Is it true that these fellows that surround<br />
you, I know they do the job well, I've always<br />
found them pretty good frankly, but then.<br />
again I'm not on the backbench, nor am I<br />
a minister of your government, do they shield<br />
you from those fellows, even from people as<br />
high as Paul Keating? </p>
<p>4<br />
HAWKE: It's not a question of shielding. Let's have<br />
this straight. clearP unequivocal, with regard<br />
to my staff there Is no question about their<br />
competence, integrity and loyalty, not just<br />
to myself but to this government, and they<br />
have done from the beginning of this government<br />
an excellent job.<br />
One of the things that Paul said yesterday<br />
was correct when he was talking in this area,<br />
and that is, as you well know, that this' is<br />
a very hot house atmosphere, it's an unreal<br />
atmosphere around this Parliament House.<br />
You have the ministers' staffs, you have the<br />
press and it's all very incestuous, it's an<br />
unreal atmosphere and as Paul said, a lot of<br />
pressures get engendered in that atmosphere.<br />
If one wanted to, and gave him the exercise<br />
of talki~ ng about the personal characteristics<br />
of staffs, of the gallery and so on, you could<br />
go on and have quite a saga.<br />
What one has got to remember is that these<br />
people on the staffs, not just on my staff<br />
but of ministers, they are not in a position<br />
where they can publicly defend themselves<br />
and I'm going to do it for them as I would<br />
expect Paul to of someone engaged in the luxury<br />
of attacking his staff.<br />
As far as I'm concerned, these people can't<br />
defend themselves, I will and I think that </p>
<p>the perhaps understandable concern that Paul<br />
may have had about not the staff but a worry<br />
about some version of attention from the real<br />
issues, okay a muddy statement, there's to<br />
be no more of that and there won't be.<br />
LAWS: I understand the atmosphere a-nd that was<br />
why I put it to you, that under the circumstances,<br />
while you were in China, and I know you<br />
want to leave the subject alone and I'm quite<br />
happy to leave it alone too, but that's why<br />
I put it to you, that being under some pressure<br />
while away all sorts of things, like travelling<br />
too much, language problems that you must<br />
encounter, having to be forever on your political<br />
toes, that they could have simply caught you<br />
at a stage when perhaps you were overtired<br />
and you may overreacted?<br />
HAWKE: No, absolutely not. I hoped in the answer<br />
I've already given you that the opposite is<br />
the case, but as far as I'm concerned we were<br />
about, not in any way, questioning the decision<br />
of Paul and Ralph Willis, both of whom were<br />
involved, They were perfectly right to respond and<br />
have this meeting, but not necessarily out<br />
of what Paul said or Ralph said and I've seen<br />
the transcript of what was said, but the media<br />
built up the idea that here was a new summit.<br />
There was never going to be a new summit<br />
and that was my concern; to see that that<br />
was made clear. </p>
<p>-6<br />
It has been made clear and the cabinet has<br />
had a very, very good consideration of the<br />
issues, a sub-committee of ministers under<br />
my chairmanship looking at the issues which<br />
will be discussed, not only at the ACPI meeting<br />
next week, but in preparing an early statement<br />
of the government's response to the current<br />
economic situation.<br />
It's all under control and according to the<br />
proper proccesses. So what I was concerned<br />
to establish, it has been established.<br />
LAWS: I suppose that interest rates aria a key to<br />
the slowdown in : the investment and economic<br />
growth in Australia, what sort of plans have<br />
you got in that direction, can we expect a'<br />
fall in interest rates soon?<br />
HAW KE: Well, let me make this clear, that as far as<br />
interest rates are concerned we've always<br />
said that monetary policy Is a key element<br />
of our overall strategy and that strategy is<br />
fine, as you know, to achieve sustained growth<br />
without debilitating inflation and balance of<br />
payments problems.<br />
So in that sense we all want lower interest<br />
rates, but we want them in a way which can<br />
be permanently achievable and that's what<br />
our policy is set now to achieve, permanently<br />
lower interest rates as economic conditionls<br />
permit. </p>
<p>-7<br />
I simply note, as you are aware, that the<br />
general interest rate trend over the past month<br />
or so has been d ' istinctly downward and I'm<br />
not going to risk the achievement of lower<br />
rates by speculating in any detail on the outlook.<br />
I simply say that the downward trend has<br />
been consistent with our policies and our policies<br />
are going to continue to take the appropriate<br />
framework for having permanently lower interest<br />
rates.<br />
LAWS: You must have a lot of things on your mind,<br />
I mean you came back and it certainly wasn't<br />
all peace and quiet on your return, was it?<br />
HAWKE: It wasn't too bad.<br />
LAWS: It wasn't too good either, I wouldn't have<br />
thought.<br />
HAWKE: Let me say, I'm not being flippant about the<br />
economic situation, it is one that requires<br />
an adjustment, refinement of what we're doing,<br />
but I was making the point not flippantly about.<br />
the fact that there are difficulties, but that<br />
I wasn't overweighed by them, that's all.<br />
LAWS: That's what interests me. A lot of people<br />
have been saying, I for one, that I think<br />
that the government has got perhaps more<br />
pressure on It at this time than It ever has<br />
had since it's been in office, would you agree<br />
with that? </p>
<p>8-<br />
HIAWKE: I think that's right in this sense, that when<br />
we came in it's very difficult to imagine any<br />
government could have had more pressure<br />
because, as you know, we were in the worst<br />
recession for 50 years and we had the enormous<br />
pressure of turning that around and taking<br />
some hard decisions which were necessary<br />
to get the economy going.<br />
That was tough and hard, but now it's In<br />
a different sort of situation and the paradox,<br />
as I think you appreciate, is that in a sense<br />
we're paying the price for our success.<br />
We got the economy moving up so strongly<br />
that the level of imports coming in with that<br />
economic growth here were very high.<br />
We would have been able to cope with that<br />
if we hadn't been confronted with this just<br />
unbelievably drastic deterioration in the terms<br />
of trade, and as far as your listeners are rtconcerned<br />
I don't want to use technical Jargon,'<br />
but that simply means that the prices that<br />
we were getting for our exports were diving<br />
downwards while the prices of imports were<br />
going up.<br />
That simply meant, if I can give you the best<br />
illustration of it which was supplied by the<br />
statistician yesterday, that that's meant that<br />
in the last 12 months a loss of 3% In our national<br />
product as a result of that change in the terms<br />
of trade. </p>
<p>9-<br />
Now, the problems are new for us, therefore<br />
we've got to adjust policies in a way -which<br />
means that we ge ! t that external problem down<br />
and try and keep activity going in this country<br />
in a way which is going to keep employment<br />
going. We'll do that with the co-operation<br />
of the people of this country.<br />
LAWS: Okay, but if you've got to get things moving<br />
in Australia, and we understand that that<br />
simply does have to happen, then it seems<br />
to me contradictory that you are offending,<br />
and I think that's the best word, the business<br />
community with the fringe benefits tax that<br />
is about to come in.<br />
HAWKE: Well, you talk about offending the business<br />
community, let's get some facts straight about<br />
the fringe benefits tax.<br />
We're not altogether dills when it comes to<br />
research and it wouldn't surprise you therefore:<br />
that we've been undertaking some research<br />
on this question of fringe benefits.<br />
LAWS: I'm not saying that they're correct in being<br />
offended.<br />
HAWkE: No, but it's not just correct, you talk about<br />
some people being offended, it is true that<br />
some are, but all the indications of the research<br />
are that the fringe benefits tax continues,<br />
which Is not surprising. to have very, very<br />
strong majority support. </p>
<p>That is simply a reflection of that fact that<br />
it is a relatively small proportion of the<br />
workforce which gets the benefit of these<br />
fringe benefits.<br />
I mean when you cut all the hyperbole and<br />
talk and special pleading out, the fact of life<br />
in Australia has been that the top 10% basically<br />
of wage and salary earners, have had their<br />
differentials against their ordinary salaried<br />
wages colleagues, pushed outwards by that<br />
basically having these non wage benefits,<br />
Which they're non taxed and has given them<br />
greater benefit.<br />
LAWS: Yes, but isn't that fundamentally-the business<br />
community?<br />
HAWKE: I beg your pardon?<br />
LAWS: Isn't that fundamentally, that top 10% that<br />
you're referring to, the business community?<br />
HAWKE: It's executives and so on not simply executives,<br />
I noted it comes down the scale somewhat,<br />
but if you want to say that business community<br />
is the executive to the business community,<br />
I just have a different view.<br />
They are an important part of the business<br />
community. People who work, wage and salary<br />
earners are part of the business community,<br />
without their input there'd be no business. </p>
<p>I 11<br />
LAWS: Yes, but it's the wage and salary earners<br />
that also can be affected by the fringe benefits<br />
tax.<br />
HAWKE: Just let me give you some figures. The best<br />
way of putting it is the highest paid 11%<br />
have about three. to seven times the chance<br />
of receiving any particular fringe benefit as<br />
the 74% of wage and salary earners paid at<br />
or below average weekly earnings.<br />
I'm simply saying that overwhelmingly the<br />
fringe benefits have been concentrated in<br />
those upper income levels.<br />
I'm not worrying about that in any sort of<br />
class thing, you know I don't go on with that,<br />
I'm simply saying, however, if you're talking<br />
about reaction and concern the simple point<br />
is that the great majority of people are in<br />
favour of the fringe benefits tax because the<br />
great majority are in a position of seeing that<br />
a relatively Emal proportion have been given<br />
benefits which haven't been taxed and Which<br />
give them an advantage over and beyond what's<br />
available to the great majority of people,<br />
it's fair in this society that that. sort of<br />
advantage should be moved. If people are<br />
to be rewarded for higher skills, higher<br />
importance, let that be clearly indentified<br />
in salary terms u Ipon which those people then<br />
make their contribution to the welfare of' this<br />
community. </p>
<p>-12<br />
LAWS: That's right, You're not getting any argument<br />
from me on the basis of the fringe benefits<br />
tax because I think it's been an unbelievable<br />
rort and I agree: with everything you say,<br />
but the point that I'm making to you,-two<br />
points I'd like to make to you we're getting<br />
all sorts of calls of anguish from hundredd<br />
of small businesspeople who are confused about<br />
it to start with, but more importantly a lot<br />
of people that are angry that they consider<br />
it to be, and listen to the words I'm using,<br />
an imposition on the business community at<br />
a time when you're trying to persuade them<br />
to perform better anyway.<br />
HAWKE: Let's get this busini ss of the imposition on<br />
the business commUnIty right, and the best<br />
way I guess of doing It is to just look at what's<br />
happened under my government and compare<br />
it with what was happening to the business<br />
community in the period before that.<br />
Just let's look at the profit share. Under<br />
Mr Fraser, if I can call them the Fraser years<br />
and let's talk about the Hawke years, and<br />
I'm not trying to be immodest, that's the easy<br />
way of identifying it.<br />
Under the Fraser years the average profit<br />
share, in the national income, was 13.9%.<br />
Under my government, the average has been<br />
15.3%.<br />
When we came to office it had got down under<br />
the other mob to 11.7%, we've pushed the </p>
<p>13<br />
profit share up arnd we've done that because<br />
it had got too low, it had to go up.<br />
We had the understanding not only of the<br />
business community, but of the trade unions.<br />
Now, that's what we've done, we have as a<br />
deliberate result of our policies pushed the<br />
profit share up to historically high levels, and<br />
we have done that in a situation corresponidingly.<br />
where the rate of wage increase has been<br />
significantly lower.<br />
You probably haven't heard this figure before,<br />
but I think you would. agree, in terms of a<br />
lot of the nonsense that goes on in this special'<br />
pleading, that these figures are important.<br />
The average under the Fraser years for<br />
movements in earnings, the average was 11.4%,<br />
that's what male average weekly earnings grew<br />
on average in the Fraser years.<br />
Under us, down to These are the' facts,<br />
we've pushed profitability up" ' the movement<br />
in earnings has been lesser, the level of<br />
industrial dispute is at historically low levels.<br />
Now, sure you're going to have some people<br />
ringing up and doing their special pleading,<br />
but what you are concerned about, as a<br />
responsible commentator concerned with aggregates,<br />
what really is happening, those are the figures<br />
which are important. </p>
<p>14-<br />
LAWS: But back to the point--<br />
HAWKE: I haven't gone away from the point, John.<br />
LAWS: Yes, you have.<br />
HAWKE: No,. I haven't, mate.<br />
LAWS: They consider that an imposition has been<br />
placed upon. them, they being the business<br />
community, at a time when you're trying to<br />
persuade them to perform better.<br />
Now, you are adding costs to the business<br />
community, aren't you?<br />
HAWKE: Some of these, of course, of course there<br />
are some costs, but remember this, that it's<br />
not just one thing, the whole tax thing is<br />
a package.<br />
I remind you that as part of this package<br />
the top rate, the top rate of tax is going<br />
to come down from 60% to 49%, t he same people<br />
who have been getting these fringe benefits<br />
that are going to pay some tax upon it, they're<br />
ringing up and complaininig about that.<br />
At the same time, are they saying to you thank<br />
you to Mr Hawke and thank you to Mr Keating<br />
for moving now to bring the situation where<br />
by next'year my top tax rate will be brought<br />
down from 604t in the dollar to 49*? Are they<br />
saying that? </p>
<p>15<br />
LAWS: No, they're not, but--<br />
HAWKE: They're not being very rounded, are they?<br />
LAWS: No, I certainly agree with all of that, but<br />
you're saying that they're not saying thank<br />
you for this, but why should they say thank<br />
you to you when you say they will pay the<br />
tax, not the person receiving the benefit?<br />
You're making the business community pay<br />
the tax, not the ' people who are receiving<br />
the benefit.<br />
BAWKE: Let me say this, I understand that point,<br />
but we're doing i t as part of a whole package.<br />
The judgment of the government was that<br />
it was appropriate. within the whole package<br />
to do it that way, it certainly would be a<br />
much stronger argument for these people if<br />
all that this government had done was to impose<br />
a fringe benefits tax and push it on to the<br />
employer. Of course what will happen is that as a result<br />
of what we're doing, in imposing the tax this<br />
way, is that companies will do what they ought<br />
to do, and that is in regard to their employees<br />
who deserve a higher differential saly, arid<br />
of course that is the nature of business, that<br />
some people deserve higher salaries.* then<br />
that will be Identified by way of salary and<br />
so remunerated at the higher level will out </p>
<p>18<br />
of his remunerati Ion pay his share to the common<br />
revenue out of that tax, he -will still have<br />
a higher remuneration, but he won't have<br />
a great hunk of it being in a form out of which<br />
he pays no benefit to the community.<br />
Why should you have a situation where the<br />
lower paid salaried and wages earners have<br />
the whole of their remuneration in terms that<br />
mean that out of -the total of it they pay tax,<br />
whereas for the higher remunerated people<br />
you've had a very large and increasing'part<br />
of their remuneration out of which they paid<br />
no tax?<br />
LAWS: That's all axiomatic and makes miles of sense.<br />
HAWKE: Thank you.<br />
LAWS: But it doesn't alter the fact that you are adding<br />
costs to the business community.<br />
HAWKE: Of course there is in this aspect an added<br />
cost, but I point out to you that in terms<br />
of what's happened to real unit labour costs<br />
under this government, that's looking at the<br />
totality, it's no good just picking up one thing..<br />
Real unit labour costs under this government<br />
have been returned to the historically low<br />
levels of the end of the 19601s, that's when<br />
you look at the aggregate of the decisions<br />
of this government. </p>
<p>17<br />
The international. competitive position of Australian<br />
business is back to the level of the late<br />
1960' s as a result of the combination of the<br />
decisions. It's like you, as a farmer, if you're makcing<br />
a judgment about your total picture of your<br />
outlook decision~, you don't just look at one<br />
element and say, that's what's determined<br />
il, you look at the aggregate of factors which<br />
are determining your output situation.<br />
Now, similarly, if you're looking at the<br />
Australian business situation, and you as an<br />
intelligent man know this, you wouldn't simply<br />
say here is one decision by the government<br />
which has added a cost, you would say the<br />
fair thing is to look at the totality of the picture,<br />
has the business community been put into<br />
a higher position of probfitability than ever<br />
before as a result of the aggregate of decisions<br />
of the government?<br />
Has it bee pu ai the position where its<br />
international competitive-position is the best<br />
it's been for 15 y ears?<br />
Do you have the lowest level of industrial<br />
disputation for 18 years?<br />
If you look at all those things, within that<br />
context, that you take into account one decision<br />
about fringe benefits. </p>
<p>is<br />
LAWS: Assuming that You agree, and I think you<br />
do agree,. that you are adding to the costs<br />
of the business community in a way at a time<br />
that you're trying to persuade them to perform<br />
better, how are you going to encourage investment?<br />
HAWKE; We will encourage investment I believe as a<br />
result of the range of policies that we have<br />
brought in.<br />
I think that we will also be seeing a position<br />
within a relatively short time where there i<br />
will be a positive response from the business<br />
community to the announcement of a range<br />
of new initiatives that we'll be taking because<br />
we understand that in the climate that I've<br />
been referring to about the change in the<br />
terms of trade, we've got to not simply rely<br />
on our agriculture and our minerals, they<br />
will always remain important but we can't just<br />
sit back in a situation where the prices for<br />
those commodities are going through the floor.<br />
We've got to lift the operations of our<br />
manufacturing and service sectors and we<br />
will be adding to the existing range of incentives<br />
that exist with our wages policies, with other<br />
already existing investment policies, we will<br />
be having an overall approach which I think<br />
you will find will add to the impetus that should<br />
exist. Let me say this, I don't want to be critical<br />
of Australian, business because that's not<br />
productive, but there's not enough of our </p>
<p>19<br />
Australian business entrepeneurs who realise<br />
that they have it within their capacity to get<br />
up anid go.<br />
One of the most satisfying features of this<br />
overseas visit I've just had, there were two.<br />
I went way out into the west of China, the<br />
Chengdu, which is way out there in the middle<br />
of China, well out to the west, and I went<br />
there and witnessed the opening, or the*<br />
preparation for opening, of a new factory<br />
there which was the result of Australian<br />
enterprise this was in the computer software<br />
area. There, right out in the middle of China,<br />
Austral] ian enterprise, going into operation<br />
there using Australian know' how, they've<br />
brought some 20 or so Chinese operatives<br />
out to Australia, trained them out here, and<br />
then gone back into the China with them and<br />
with Australian people and -' e're going, from<br />
there, not only supplying -3arket in China.<br />
but other export markets.<br />
Then a couple of days later, down in Chengdu<br />
in the Sichuan province in southern Chinii,,<br />
and there I opened a textile mill.<br />
Here was a young Australian entrepeneur,<br />
I won't name him, but a great young bloke,<br />
a Sydney fellow, here he was bringing Wool<br />
up to China and there they were, producing<br />
the yarn and the material, textile material. </p>
<p>Now, that's get up and go initiative and you<br />
just felt bloody proud to be an Australian<br />
and see Australians doing that.<br />
And that was done out of the Australian<br />
environment with all the circumstances of:<br />
Australia.<br />
The point of what I'm saying is If initiative<br />
and entrepeneurialship is utilised, if people<br />
do understand that we can match the world<br />
if we get up and go, then that's the sort<br />
of thing that's got to happen.<br />
That's going to require enterprise by management,<br />
it's going to require co-operation by<br />
unions and it's going to require initiatives<br />
by government.<br />
If we all as Australians understand that we<br />
can take on the world in a whole range of<br />
areas, then there are no limits.<br />
LAWS: I know you've got to go because we've just<br />
had a call from one of your fellows saying<br />
that you're supposed to be somewhere opening<br />
something, so I'd better be quick.<br />
Have you got any sweetness in mind for the<br />
business community?<br />
HAWKE: Look, I think it's not appropriate that give<br />
any sort of indication. Let me say this. I' 11<br />
be announcing in the not too distant future<br />
a range of decisions and approaches by the </p>
<p>21<br />
government which-are appropriate to meeting<br />
the circumstances of this time.<br />
I want to conclude on this note, and it is<br />
straight and direct and totally sincere.<br />
When we came to office at the beginning of<br />
1983 1 remind you, and you've been good enough<br />
to talk-' about it yourself, that was the worst<br />
recession for 50 years.<br />
I simply said to the people of Austrblia, look,<br />
we as Australians are good enough with<br />
leadership to get out of this awful whole and<br />
get going again we did.<br />
No, I'm saying again now in the middle of<br />
1986, just over three years later, the world<br />
has dealt us a bad hand at the moment with<br />
the terms of trade, okay, we dbn't like it<br />
but we've got enough guts, determination,<br />
capacity between us all together to get out<br />
of this we will again.<br />
LAWS: How long will it take?<br />
HAWKE: Not very long, I think.<br />
LAWS: Prime Minister Bob Hawke.<br />
