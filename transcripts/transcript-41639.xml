    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Liberal National Government has today delivered on a significant commitment – there are one million more Australians in work than there were when we were elected.</p>
<p>One million more jobs means at least one million livelihoods improved. This is an excellent outcome for Australian families.</p>
<p>It reflects the hard work of Australian businesses and the Government’s strong economic management. Our plan is working.</p>
<p>Since coming into office in 2013, we have been focussed on ensuring the right economic policy settings and market conditions to boost jobs growth.</p>
<p>Thriving businesses create jobs and give Australians the opportunity to work.</p>
<p>The Government’s role is to create the right economic conditions so that businesses of all sizes can prosper, grow and hire more Australians.</p>
<p>We haven’t just talked about jobs and growth — we have delivered jobs and growth.</p>
<p>Job creation does not happen by accident. Over the last five years, the Liberal National Government has:</p>
<ul><li>delivered personal and small and medium business tax cuts;</li>
<li>delivered more trade deals, meaning more exports and more jobs;</li>
<li>delivered record infrastructure and defence industry investment</li>
<li>constrained spending, with real growth now at its lowest rate in 50 years;</li>
<li>acted to bring down the cost of living with our energy reforms.</li>
</ul><p>2017 was the best year on record for jobs growth.</p>
<p>The ABS labour force figures today show that jobs continue to be created.</p>
<p>Employment is now at a record high of just over 12.5 million.</p>
<p>On average, more than 900 people have found work every day over the past year. Nearly 80 per cent of the jobs created have been full time.</p>
<p>In the final year of the former Labor Government 17,000 full-time jobs disappeared.</p>
<p>Every lever of policy put in place by the Government is pulling in the direction of more economic growth, more jobs and better jobs.</p>
