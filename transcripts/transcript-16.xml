The Oldest Book<br />
with the<br />
Newest Message.<br />
AN ADDRESS:<br />
Delivered by the Right Honourable the<br />
Prime Minister of Australia, Mr. R. G.<br />
Menzies, at the Town Hall,<br />
Melbourne, on the occasion of/ the Centenary<br />
Thanksgiving Meeting of the British and<br />
Foreign Bible Society, Victoria, on the<br />
July, 1940. RT. 9ON. U. G. MENZIES.<br />
M. P.<br />
I just want to occupy your time very, very briefly in telling you, in my own<br />
fashion two or three reasons why I regard it as a great privilege to be here<br />
on this Centenary occasion, why I regard it as a great privilege to be associated<br />
with your celebration of the work of the Society which, in the last 100 odd<br />
years, has done work for the world of the most distinctive and indeed unique<br />
character. And all my reasons, of course like yours, must go back not so much<br />
to the day we celebrate as to the Book we celebrate. I believe that I can say<br />
to you and that I can say it for you and for many hundreds of thousands of<br />
people that the minds of men have gone back to this great Book more in these<br />
last few months than they have for many years past.<br />
I am able to stand here tonight and say this is no mere formality that I<br />
should come here, but it is the genuine expression of a genuine sharing with<br />
you of thankfulness and enthusiasm for this occasion. </p>
<p>There are good reasons that one might give for one's interest in this Book. ii<br />
I just want to mention, very briefly, three of them and I do not want to it<br />
mention them in their order of importance. t C.<br />
The first of these reasons is that I believe that this English Bible of ours, R<br />
properly read, properly understood, is the greatest fountain of enthusiasm -ti<br />
that one could discover. I never read it without feeling stirred by it, and I s;<br />
never read it without feeling that my imagination has been stirred by it. There 0<br />
is, I believe, no book printed which has such an amazing sweep, which can t<br />
take you back so rapidly in such an illuminating way over centuries, over<br />
generations of mankind, over almost the entire history of mankind. It is a 51<br />
great thing, you know, to be able to extract from the printed word just that g<br />
kind of enthusiasm. I remember, and I thought of it tonight when His Grace t)<br />
made some reference to Cambridge, the last time I visited Cambridge I went td<br />
into a place he knows very well, the Fitzwilliam, and there, wandering around T<br />
this great museum of treasures, I found under a little cover in a glass frame V<br />
the manuscript of Keats's " Ode to a Nightingale," the manuscript written in a a<br />
fair hand on a sheet of notepaper. And, as I looked at it and saw that immortal a*<br />
couplet of his; e:<br />
" hath is<br />
Charmed magic casements, opening on the foam<br />
Of perilous seas, in faery lands forlorn." ir<br />
and saw a little alteration in it in Keats's own handwriting, I, who had read it<br />
all the poetry of Keats, felt, for the first time, that I had come near to b<br />
him as a man, I had seen his very handwriting just the same sort ofs<br />
stirring in your mind and heart that you get if you go as I have been<br />
privileged to go, and see hanging in a frame on one of the walls of " Chequers,"<br />
the residence of the Prime Ministers of England, that letter from Oliver b<br />
Cromwell in which he said, you remember, " The Lord made them as chaff t<br />
before our swords." And I get just that kind of quickening of the imagination T<br />
when I look back over those pages. of history which are the pages of the cl<br />
Bible that we are discussing tonight. a:<br />
My second reason for being glad to be here tonight is that this great Book<br />
has given to us, more than any other book and more than any man, the<br />
language that we speak. True it is that Tindale and Coverdale, and the W<br />
w. iters, the editors, the translators of the authorised version know none of r<br />
these fancy Latin words we use today. They had never heard of " de-contamina-n<br />
tion:" they had certainly never heard of " re-decontam inat ion;" they had never 1<br />
heard of a thing being " finalised;" they had never heard any of these abomina-t<br />
tions that we make in these days of ours. They spoke and they understood e<br />
just that sturdy Anglo-Saxon speech that Shakespeare understood and spoke. ai<br />
And yet,-with all the simplicity of their language, they had a capacity to stir<br />
the pulse in a few sentences that no other writers have ever had since. This<br />
is the great repository of our tongue, and, if this world by some melancholy<br />
mischance, became a world of black and gloomy atheists tomorrow, they would a*<br />
still need to read the Bible if they wanted to understand the speech of the<br />
English people. a<br />
My third reason, and my greatest reason, is that, with all the influence that c.<br />
this Book has had upon the imagination of our race, upon the speech of our<br />
race, its supreme influence has been upon the character of our race. It must U </p>
<p>indeed have been very seldom in the history of man that a speech should of<br />
itself have been the instrument for moulding character, but, just as the Bible<br />
taught the English their own English so it wove into the fabric of the English<br />
character that profound realisation of the existence of God, that profound belief<br />
in -the value of the moral judgment that has made our race the greatest race in<br />
the world, and that alone can keep our race a great race. I am not going to<br />
say nor would you believe me if I said it that we are without blemish in<br />
our history, that we have never as a nation done mean things or dishonest<br />
things. Of course we have; many times have we fallen short of a standard, but<br />
we have always set the standard for ourselves and we have always made that<br />
standard high. We may occasionally have disappointed those to whom we had<br />
given our word. We have never, I believe, wilfully broken our word. To us<br />
the international contract, the promise given, have their ultimate sanction in<br />
the moral depths of our nature. Our international obligations have never been<br />
mere obligations of law; they have been obligations binding upon the conscience.<br />
We have on all occasions endeavoured to act as decent and straight and honourable<br />
people should act. Our judgment has been a judgment founded upon an<br />
appreciation of the moral nature of man, and not merely a judgment of<br />
expediency founded upon the strength or the weakness of our opponents. That<br />
is a big thing to say: I say it without any form of boasting: I hope rather to<br />
understate it as I say it. But I believe that if there is one thing that has<br />
informed and coloured the policy of the British people throughout the centuries<br />
it has been that beating in upon their consciences, upon their hearts, that has<br />
been wrought by the Great Book, the centenary of whose publication in this<br />
State we are celebrating tonight.<br />
I think that it was Matthew Arnold who, in discussing the difference<br />
between the Greeks and the Hebrews, pointed out what is indeed true, that<br />
to the Greeks knowledge was the thing, clearness of thought was the thing.<br />
They loved dialectics for their own sake. They loved the crystal quality of a<br />
clear mind. But to the Hebrews the quality of thought was never so important<br />
as the quality of action, the quality of conduct. And we British people,<br />
standing today at a time of great trial in our history may, I believe, say with<br />
all humility that confused as we may have been, muddled as we may have been,<br />
we have always attached supreme importance to the quality of a man's conduct<br />
rather than the mere quality of a man's mind. If that is true, then we did<br />
not derive it simply from some strange atmosphere that existed over the British<br />
Isles; I believe we derived it from a Book which, crystal clear as it is except<br />
to those who seek to confuse it by straw-splitting, has at the same time<br />
elevated to a supreme place in life the test of what a man does rather than the<br />
test of what he says or how he thinks, the test of conduct, and, by that test<br />
at this hour, we shall stand or fall.<br />
None of us has any doubt that in this war the character of the world is<br />
at issue, and that issue will be determined by the character of us, I cannot put<br />
somebody else's character into the scale today and so let that weigh down the<br />
scale for virtue. I must put my own, and you must put your own, into the scale,<br />
and unless the sum of our character today justifies us in saying that the<br />
character of the world is at issue in this war then we do not deserve to win the<br />
war. But, if the sum does justify that claim, then I have no doubt that we shall<br />
win the war because, in that event, God will be on our side. </p>
<p>Now, I just want to conclude by saying this to you. I said something just<br />
now about reading the Book. The other night I was reading it, and reading it,<br />
as you may very well imagine, with more than half a mind on the troubles of<br />
these days which are perhaps in a special sense troubles of mine because I have<br />
great responsibilities, and in reading it I came across a passage which contained,<br />
I suppose, the oldest story of the boyhood of any of us, the story of David and<br />
Goliath so well known that we hardly bother to go back and read it. But I<br />
went back and read it, and, for the rest of this war, it is my text. As I think of<br />
almost all Europe armed at this moment to attack the little green country of<br />
Great Britain, and when I think of all that is at stake in it, I think you will-agree<br />
with me that this old story will bear repetition. I wonder if I might just read a<br />
few words of it? I shall not read it all, although I have always loved the<br />
description of the Philistine with his lance like a weaver's beam. But will<br />
read this: " And he took his staff in his hand, and chose him five smooth stones out<br />
of the brook, and put them in the shepherd's bag which he had, even in his<br />
scrip; and his sling was in his hand: and he drew near to the Philistine.<br />
And the Philistine came on and drew near unto David; and the man that<br />
bare the shield went before him. And when the Philistine looked about,<br />
and saw David, he disdained him: for he was but a youth, and ruddy, and<br />
withal of a fair countenance. And the Philistine said unto David, Am I<br />
a dog, that thou comest to me with staves And the Philistine cursed<br />
David by his gods.<br />
And the Philistine said to David, Come to me, and I will give thy<br />
flesh unto the fowls of the air, and to the beasts of the field.<br />
Then said David to the Philistine, Thou comest to me with a sword,<br />
and with a spear, and with a javelin: but I come to thee in the name of the<br />
Lord of Hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, whom thou has defied. This<br />
day will the Lord deliver thee into mine hand; and I will smite thee, and<br />
take thine head from thee; and I will give the carcases of the host of the<br />
Philistines this day unto the fowls of the air, and to the wild beasts of the<br />
earth; that all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel.<br />
It is a great privilege, ladies and gentlemen, for a Prime Minister of a<br />
Christian country engaged in what, strangely enough, it is bound to believe a<br />
Christian war, to come along on an occasion like this and say a few words to<br />
himself and to you about the oldest Book with the newest message in it for the<br />
sons of men. BRITISH FOREIGN BIBLE SOCIETY ( VICTORIA)<br />
