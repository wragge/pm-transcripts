K PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 2 NOVEMBER 1990<br />
The Royal Australian Air Force and the Royal New Zealand Air<br />
Force are to make joint surveillance flights to scrutinise<br />
the activities of driftnet fishing fleets in the South-West<br />
Pa~ cific.<br />
I launched the joint surveillance flights initiative in<br />
Auckland in February this year with my then New Zealand<br />
counterpart, Geoffrey Palmer, at the signing of the<br />
" Convention for the Prohibition of Fishing with Long<br />
Driftnets in the South Pacific".<br />
The signing of the Convention and commissioning of the<br />
surveillance flights are further indications of Australia's<br />
commitment to rid the South Pacific of the driftnetting<br />
fleets. Australia, along with New Zealand and the South<br />
Pacific nations, has a proud record on this issue beginning<br />
with our efforts which led to the incorporation of the<br />
Tarawa Declaration in the 1989 South Pacific Forum<br />
Communique. The international push culminated in the<br />
res~ olution on driftnetting passed by the United Nations<br />
General Assembly in November last year.<br />
Through the surveillance flights, Australia and New Zealand<br />
wil. l provide South Pacific Forum countries, via the Forum<br />
Fisheries Agency, with important data on the frequency and<br />
range of driftnetting activities. The program schedule will<br />
be conducted by the Australian Fisheries Service and the New<br />
Zealand Ministry for Agriculture and Fisheries in<br />
conjunction with the Forum Fisheries Agency.<br />
The surveillance operation starting from this month, the<br />
beginning of the driftnet season will maintain the<br />
pressure which has already led Distant Water Fishing Nations<br />
( DWFNs) to respond to the concerns of South Pacific nations<br />
by agreeing to abide by the terms of the United Nations<br />
resolution on driftnet fishing. It was in response to this<br />
pressure that, earlier this year, Japan suspended<br />
driftnetting by its fleets in the South Pacific. Taiwan has<br />
also reduced itsfleet numbers but has indicated it will<br />
continue some driftnet fishing this season.<br />
The RAAF and the RNZAF will coordinate flights of P3 Orion<br />
aircraft over the Tasman Sea until the driftnet season ends<br />
in Mlarch.<br />
