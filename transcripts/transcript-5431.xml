AUT ALIA I<br />
PRIME MINISTER k-<br />
FOR MEDIA 1 SEPTEMBER, 1980 ( WASHINGTON T'<br />
2 SEPTEMBER, 1980 ( AUSTRALIAN TIME)<br />
SPEECH TO B'NAI B'RITH INTERNATIONAL<br />
On occasions like this it is customary to begin by saying that one<br />
has been greatly moved by the award in question. In my case I can<br />
say that with absolute, literal truth, for I have been moved some<br />
10,000 miles to be here tonight to receive this medal.<br />
I assure you that the length of the journey is commensurate with<br />
the importance I attach to the occasion not only because' I feel<br />
deeply honoured personally that a body of the stature and prestige<br />
of B'nai B'rith has chosen to give me this award, but because I regard<br />
your decision as a recognition of and tribute to Australia's humanitarian<br />
record. You re~ resent an organisation which has demonstrated the seriousness<br />
of its concern for human dignity and justice over the years. I represent<br />
a country which has done the same thing. I would like to begin by<br />
mentioning briefly two manifestations of that concern in areas which<br />
I know have been at the heart of B" nai B'rith's activities since its<br />
inception one hundred and thirty seven years ago: refugees and opposition<br />
to racialism.<br />
Australia began to take refugees in significant numbers in the 1930s,<br />
with the exodus of jewish people from central Europe. After the Second<br />
World War, Australia continued to do so in response to the vast<br />
displacement of population in Eastern Europe and the creation of regimes<br />
there which many found intolerable. Thousands came from the Soviet Union<br />
and the Baltic States. Overall, in the 35 years since that war we<br />
have taken an average of around 10,000 refugees a year. Now I appreciate<br />
that for Americans, accustomed to think in large numbers, that figure<br />
nay not seem unCuly impressive. However, if I point out that as a<br />
percentage of population it is equivalent to an annual intake of some<br />
150-160,000' by the United States, I am sure you will appreciate its<br />
significance in Australian terms.<br />
In recent years Australia has been taking many more than that average<br />
figure. We have responded to the deliberate creation of a terrible<br />
refugee problem in our own region, one made even more harrowing<br />
by long sea journeys in small and unseaworthy boats which have resulted<br />
in tens of thousands of deaths by drowning. In fact, in per capita<br />
terms we have accepted more refugees from Indo-China for permanent<br />
settlement than has any other country in the world. We have done<br />
this because it is right. But over the years Australia has also benefitted<br />
greatly from it, as the energy and talents of those who have come<br />
to Australia have contributed to the rich diversity and prosperity<br />
of life there. We are a better country for it. / 2 </p>
<p>-2<br />
As for racialism, let me begin by acknowledging that in earlier times<br />
Australian life was seriously marred in this respect. Australians did<br />
pursue a discriminatory policy as far as immigration was concerned,<br />
the so-called " White Australia'!. policy. Australians did discriminate<br />
shamefully against the Aboriginal people in Australia itself. We do<br />
neither any longer.<br />
At the beginning of the 1980s Australia's immigration policy is colour<br />
blind and over a third of our settler arrivals come from Third World<br />
countries. We have moved a long way from being an essentially<br />
Anglo-Saxon-Celtic community to being a truly multi-cultural and<br />
multi-racial one. Within that community, the Aboriginals are today an<br />
important and respected component. It would be idle and wrong to deny<br />
that earlier neglect has left a residue of serious problems. There is no<br />
co-n-lacency about these problems. They are fully recognised and determined<br />
efforts are being made to cope with them. A comprehensive set of policies<br />
covering, among other things, land questions, royalty payment for<br />
mining, low interest loans, and special legal, health and education<br />
services is being implemented. These policies are based on a full<br />
recognition of the fundamental right of Aboriginal Australians to participate<br />
fully in the determination of their own future. They have been devised<br />
in consultation with Aboriginal people and, where possible, are carried<br />
out by Aboriginal people.<br />
in international affairs Australia is fully committed to opposing racialism.<br />
We have opposed' it vehemently and to some effect in South~ rn Africa,<br />
where my Government recently played a significant part within the<br />
framework of the Commonwealth of Nations in resolving the Zimbabwe<br />
crisis. Unlike some others, however, we do not restrict our ' opposition<br />
to racialism to where 4ris fashionable or safe. We do not believe<br />
in being selective on this issue. We oppose it in all its forms and<br />
even when it is practised by the very powerful by the Soviet Union,<br />
for example.<br />
You be interested to know that the Australian Parliament recently<br />
conductedl an enquiry lnzo human rights in the Soviet Union and produced<br />
a comprehensive. repcrt_ o-n the. subject-. To the best of my knowledge,<br />
the Australian Parliament is the only legislature to have produced<br />
such a report. It has subsequently been incorporated into the U. S.<br />
Congressio'nal Record..<br />
Before leaving thi s question, let me add that we are also concerned<br />
to oppose the debasement of anti-racialism, which some seek to exploit<br />
in a self-serving way by attaching the label of racialism to anything<br />
they oppose. To be more specific, my Government has opposed and<br />
will continue to oppose attempts to characterise Zionism as racialist,<br />
even when this involves us being in a very small minority as far<br />
as UtN \' otin-is ccncerned. There are times when what. you do is more<br />
important than the numbers. Racialism is too vile and serious a matter<br />
to be misus~ d and subordinated to other issues in this way.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen, I know that B'nai B'rith's concern is with<br />
humanitarian issues. I know also that many'. people believe that a<br />
concern with humanitarian issues should be kept separate from political<br />
and strategic matters, that they are somehow incompatible. I sympathise<br />
with the impulses behind that view the religious and humanistic<br />
impulses to look for what unites people rather than what divides them.<br />
/ 13 </p>
<p>-3<br />
It represents a necessary ideal. Yet at the level of practical policy,<br />
1 believe that it is profoundly mistaken. All our experience denies<br />
it. In particular, the experience of the Jewish people in this century<br />
emphatically denies it. Humanitarian problems arise in, and are profoundly<br />
affected by, a political context. A realistic humanitarianism, and<br />
one meant to solve problems and not merely to assuage consciences,<br />
must therefore extend to embrace the great political and strategic<br />
issues of our time.<br />
Before I turn to say something about these issues there is something<br />
which, from past experience, I feel I should explain. I am sometimes<br />
asked, with some surprise implicit in the question, why a geographically<br />
remote, middle-sized country like Australia which faces no imminent<br />
threat is so concerned with such matters. The best way I could answer<br />
Chis question, would be to take the person asking it to an Australian<br />
country town almost any country town and ask him to look atthe<br />
memorial he would find there to the Australians who had died<br />
in the wars of this century. The lists are long. Too many Australians<br />
have died in places remote from their home in Europe, in the Middle<br />
East, in Korea, in South East Asia for us to be unconcerned about<br />
the preservation of world * peace. Their sacrifice not only confers a<br />
right but imposes a duty on an Australian Prime Minister to speak<br />
on these issues.<br />
If 1 may make a more general point, one cannot on the one hand<br />
use the rhetoric of " one world", the " global village", " interdependence",<br />
and on the other proceed to argue that the questions of peace and<br />
war should be left to those immediately involved or to the great powers<br />
alone. The middle-rankini; countries of the world should recognise<br />
that the-/ have a role to play-. It would be an excess of modesty on<br />
their part, indeed it would be a political and moral failing, to assume<br />
that they should be seen but not heard on the great issues.<br />
In the present circumstances, it is not a matter of some exaggerated<br />
and unr-ealistic notion about the extent of the influence an Australian<br />
voice can~ have which m.-oves me to speak. It is rather a belief that<br />
in a Wes5tern world clha= racterised by a great deal of self doubt, division<br />
and illusion, every incremental contribution to the clarifying of issues<br />
and the strengthening-of resolve is valuable. It is in that spirit<br />
that I male My remark:-1s.<br />
We have travelled far this century. Much of the ore has been<br />
grim and harrowing. The First World War, whose brutality and suffering<br />
almost numb the imagination, left ordinary people shocked, dazed,<br />
and longing for an era of peace. They did not get it. 21 years later<br />
in precisely the time required for a new generation of young men<br />
to reach their majority the world was again at war.<br />
Tragically,, that second conflict came about because, in the name of<br />
peace, the very moderate steps necessary to resist aggression in good<br />
time were opposed. Those who sought to maintain the true conditions<br />
for peace were denounced as militarists. As ' a result, millions were<br />
to perish needlessly in the gas chambers of concentration camps<br />
as well as on the battle fields.<br />
By 194~ 5 the essential lesson had been learnt, at least by one generation:<br />
it was realised that the end of the war did not signify the end of<br />
the struggle to maintain peace that there was no end to that struggle.<br />
So the democracies of the world, led by this great and generous country,<br />
girded themselves. to face a new threat from a new tyranny. </p>
<p>-4<br />
New alignments were forged, new strategies shaped. Leaders of stature<br />
and vision emerged. That effort provided the foundation for a generation<br />
not only of peace but of unprecedented material advancement for the<br />
world. But 35 years have passed. The generation which emerged from the<br />
last war and which understood its lessons is no longer active. Memories<br />
have faded, awareness of danger has receded, determination to uphold,<br />
and explain and expound the values of free societies has diminished.<br />
What then is the s ituation facing us at the beginning of the 1980' s?<br />
The essence of what I have to say can be summed up in two propositions.<br />
First: the single most important fact which faces the world in the<br />
1980s, is the reality of Soviet military power and the implications which<br />
flow from it. Second: the next most important fact is the reluctance<br />
of many in the West to recognise that reality and to respond to it.<br />
As far as the Soviet Union is concerned it is necessary always to<br />
bear in mind some basic facts. During the last 50 years, while other<br />
empires have been dismembered at an unprecedented rate, the Soviet<br />
Union has been the only major power which has acquired substantial<br />
territory and surrendered its claim to nothing.<br />
Soviet leaders today, as in the past, describe international-politics<br />
as basically a struggle between what they call " progressive" forces<br />
and the forces of " reaction". They profess support for the " progressive"<br />
forces in their struggle to gain power throughout the world and they<br />
refuse to accept any definition of detente which in any way circumscribes<br />
Soviet participation in that struggle.. " Progressive" forces are, of<br />
course, defined in terms of their-compatibility with the national interest<br />
of the Soviet Union.<br />
Internally, there have been some important changes in the Soviet Union<br />
over recent decades. in -particular the disappearance of mass slave<br />
labour and mass terror stand out and. are to be profoundly welcomed.<br />
But there is still no rule of law, no freedom of opinion or information,<br />
no right to strike, no right to emigrate. And many of us must marvel<br />
at the courage of many thousands of people in Poland in recent days.<br />
There is still an oppressive. and ubiquitous security service which<br />
harrasses cruelly the kind of. dissent which is considered normal in<br />
open societies. Political and economic power is still monopolised by<br />
a self-appointed and self-perpetuating elite. There is still a command<br />
economy, of the kind which other countries only resort to in war-time.<br />
In other words, the basic institutional structure of the country remains<br />
unchanged since Stalin's time.<br />
I spell out these features for one reason only: because they are the<br />
features of % the country which many judge is now the strongest military<br />
power in the world and will, given military lead-times, remain so<br />
for most of the 1980s. It has achieved this status by a massive and<br />
relentless arms build-up over the last two decades, a build-up which<br />
started from what was already a very high base. It was achieved<br />
by giving-arms an absolute priority, even at the enormous expense<br />
of the serious sacrificing of other goals, the achieving of which would<br />
have bettered the lot of its long suffering people.<br />
This is the country we are going to live with in the com ing years.<br />
I believe that doing so is going to be a dangerous business. The<br />
main danger as I. see it stems not from the likelihood that the Soviet<br />
Union will deliberately precipitate a nuclear war or that it will launch<br />
ageneral attack on Western Europe. </p>
<p>The Soviet leaders do not want a war with the West. They recognise<br />
that if it occurs its effects will be devastating for everyone. I believe,<br />
however, that they do want those things the pursuit of which will<br />
greatly increase the risk of war.<br />
The danger is greatest in the chronically unstable regions of the<br />
Third World. It is particularly great in the Middle East racked<br />
as it is by internal conflict, vital as its oil is for the countries<br />
of the world, and adjacent as it is to Soviet military power. The<br />
Soviet Union's combination of nuclear parity with the West and conventional<br />
superiority make it tempting for it to use the latter in the Middle<br />
East. If it does so the possibility of a spill-back of conflict into<br />
Europe will be very great. In other words, the traditional pattern<br />
% a'hrrse vh ave begun in Europe and have then en ' gulfed the rest<br />
of the world may well be reversed. For historical reasons it may be<br />
difficult for those viewing the world from a European perspective to<br />
come to terms with this possibility.<br />
I believe that the danger has been increased by the invasion of<br />
Afghanistan which has driven a Soviet salient into the region. I believe<br />
it will be further increased to the extent that it is possible for the<br />
Soviet Union to misread the situation due to ambiguous or inadequate<br />
signals from the West. I emphasise that point: danger will arise not<br />
only from Soviet power and intentions but from confusion and division<br />
concerning Western policy which could lead to miscalculation on the<br />
Soviet side. For the sa ke of peace it is essential that this be attended<br />
to. It shou-Id be emphasisec-i and clearly understood that what I am talking<br />
about is not merely hypothetical. To a very significant extent it is<br />
already happening: in Angola. and Ethiopia on the African continent,<br />
in the ' Yemen and Afghanistan in the Middle East, and, nearer to<br />
Australia-, in Indo-China where the Soviet Union is subsidising Vietnamese<br />
aggressizn to the tune of $ 3 million a day, and acquiring military<br />
facilities in Vietnam rocr its. trouble.<br />
In the case of AfghaniStan and Cambodia, Soviet policy has demonstrated<br />
yet again that it has a capacity rivalled only by Nazi Germany in<br />
this century for addincg to the sum of human misery by creating great<br />
and tragic flows of refugees.<br />
What of the Western response to this challenge? In terms of population,<br />
in terms of wealth, in terms of knowledge, in terms of technology,<br />
the combined resources of the West far exceed those of the Soviet Union<br />
and its associates. If, therefore, the West finds itself vulnerable<br />
to Soviet power as in some -respects it does it is because of a<br />
failure of--Dpcep~ ion and resolve.<br />
These two perception and resolve are intimately related. On the<br />
one hand, there can be no adequate response to a problem until its<br />
existence is properly recognised and its nature understood. On the<br />
other hand, a failure of resolve and will is likely to lead to<br />
interpretations either optimistic or fatalistic which will either explain.<br />
away the problem or deny the possibility of effective action.<br />
Two years ago at Harvard, Solzhenitsyn spoke of the prevalence in<br />
the West of a self-deluding interpretation of the contemporary world<br />
situation. " It works", he said " as a sort of petrified armour around<br />
people's minds... . it will be broken only by the pitiless crowbar of<br />
events". </p>
<p>-6<br />
We must hope that Solzhenitsyn is wrong in his conclusion that only<br />
after bitter experience will people see things as they are; but he<br />
is surely right in identifying the capacity for -self-delusion as* a critical<br />
factor in the West today.<br />
Consider, for example, the typical sequence of arguments advanced<br />
against any attempt to focus attention on Soviet imperialism.<br />
First, a strenuous denial that the Soviet Union is in the process of<br />
attempting to achieve, military preponderance accompanied by a claim<br />
that it is merely reacting to the military programmes of. the West.<br />
Second, the assertion that even if the Soviet Union is in the process<br />
of achieving military superiority, this is not politically significant.<br />
Beyond t~ he level of ' sufficiency", it is claimed, military 30% Vef is<br />
meaningless and in any case, i! 3 becoming increasingly irrelevantto<br />
the achieving of foreign policy goals..<br />
Third, the claim that even if military superiority does confer an advantage<br />
there is no need to worry since the Soviet Union is a cautious,<br />
conservative, satisfied state, more fearful than ambitious.<br />
Fourth, the reassurance that even if all preceding arguments turn<br />
out to be false there is still no cause for alarm, for it is well known<br />
that the Soviet Union is so maladroit in its dealing s with the Third<br />
World that anything it tries there is sure to fail. And so, it is argued<br />
the sensible course is to relax and wait for it to fail.<br />
This sequence of arguments with its series of fall-back positions<br />
* constitutes a determined defence in depth against taking anything.,<br />
but an utterly complacent view of Soviet power and intentions. Each<br />
step in the sequence is either false, or a dangerous half truth, or.<br />
involves taking an irresponsible gamble with the peace and security<br />
of the world and of the lives -of men and women.<br />
The Soviet Union is engaged in a quest for superiority in every important<br />
category of weaponry and has already achieved it in many of them.<br />
It is not simply reacting to Western efforts, but on the contrary follows<br />
an undeviating course regardless of fluctuations in Western performance.<br />
The present U. S. Secretary of Defence made the point succinctly when<br />
he observed that, " as our defence budgets have risen, the Soviets<br />
have increased their defence budget. As our defence budgets have.<br />
gone down, their defence budgets have increased again".<br />
Military superiority is translatable into political advantage, especially<br />
when nuclear parity, and consequent nuclear stalemate, is combined<br />
with conventional superiority.<br />
Soviet caution is not based on conservatism but on a rational calculation<br />
of risk and' opportunity. When it is at a disadvantage it is cautious,<br />
but when it enjoys an advantage it acts boldly to capitalise on it<br />
as it did in Eastern Europe at the end of the Second World War,<br />
and as it is increasingly doing now in the Third World. To the extent<br />
that the Soviet Union. is motivated by fear, it is, as indeed many<br />
of those who interpret its foreign policy as defensive concede, a paranoid<br />
fear. But the practical manifestations of such a fear are virtually<br />
indistinguishable fromr aggression, in that they cannot be appeased or<br />
assuaged short of conceding global dominance. / 7 </p>
<p>7<br />
As to its alleged inability to deal with the Third World, the Soviet<br />
Union has had its failures there, but it has also had its successes,<br />
and recently the latter have predominated. In any case, what kind<br />
of societies would we be if we were prepared to risk our future on<br />
the expected mistakes of an adversary? Surely we value our way of<br />
life, our liberty, too much to accept such a risk.<br />
It cannot be denied that some of the effects of the self-delusion and<br />
confusion I have sought to identify are apparent in the state of the<br />
Western alliance today. NATO, the centrepiece of that alliance, has<br />
been enormously successful, perhaps uniquely successful as a peace-time<br />
alliance. But it is operating today in essentially the same form and<br />
according to the same strategic doctrine as it did when it was founded<br />
years a go, even though there have been profound changes since<br />
then. There have been many such changes: in the economic balance between<br />
the United States and Europe; in the extent of trade between the West<br />
and the East; in European perspectives following the dismemberment<br />
of their empires. All these have important implications and consequences.<br />
But in terms of security, one change stands out: in 1949 when NATO<br />
was founded, the United States had clear nuclear superiority and<br />
virtual immunity from nuclear attack. Now it has neither.<br />
If the Western alliance is to survive, these changes must be reflected<br />
in its form and substance. It must be made consonant with the kinds<br />
of threats which its members face today and with the current distribution<br />
of power and wealth among its members.<br />
The United States, which has shouldered such a heavy burden for<br />
so long, should receive greater support from its now prosperous allies.<br />
In Australia, we recognise this. In Europe, as America's allies have<br />
recovered and become more powerful they have, rightly, reasserted<br />
themselves politically. But until this reassertion is accompanied hy<br />
the willingness to assumrpe a commensurate responsibility for their own<br />
security which logically follows from it, it will be a source of strain<br />
between the United States and its major allies. Some progress has<br />
been made in this respect in recent years and this ' is to be welcomed.<br />
But the disparity in burden-sharing is still very pronounced.<br />
The United States, in its turn, should recognise that a changing balance<br />
within the alliance requires different modes of action on its part,<br />
including greater attention to continuous policy co-ordination and<br />
consultation. There is an urgent need to develop mechanisms which<br />
will enable the Western alliance to respond quickly to events in a<br />
dangerous and volatile world.<br />
Again, if wp, are to avoid nuclear war there is an imperative need<br />
for the creation of conventional forces capable in themselves of placing<br />
in serious doubt the success of any Soviet conventional attack. It<br />
is not enough to depend on a nuclear deterrent in a world in which<br />
all are vulnerable to nuclear devastation.<br />
Ther e is an equally urgent need for the allies to agree on the ground<br />
rules to be applied for detente: to the relationship between trade<br />
policy and the political and military activity of the Soviet Union;<br />
and also to the relationship of detente in Europe to events elsewhere<br />
in the world. Indeed, high priority should be given to the whole<br />
question of the protection of shared Western interests beyond the geographical<br />
territory of the NATO members, for as I have said it, is<br />
there that the danger is greatest. </p>
<p>8-<br />
Beyond all this and perhaps most important of all, there is an over-riding<br />
need to articulate the purposes and meaning of the alliance in language<br />
which will revitalise the commitment of ordinary men and women in<br />
Western countries to its cause. That cause is not, in the last resort,<br />
about military arrangements but about the preservation of a way of<br />
life an open, liberal, democratic way of life governed by respect<br />
for law. Whatever the shortcomings of that way of life and we hear<br />
a good deal about them nowadays it is necessary only to compare<br />
it with any. of the cthers which are on offer to realise that it shculd<br />
be supported and defended with zeal and resolution and even by passion<br />
by all who love liberty, It is palpably absurd that its upholders<br />
should ever feel morally or idealogically on the defensive in dealing<br />
with totalitarians or authoritarians.<br />
Currently, there are disturbing signs of a strengthening of neutralistsentiments<br />
in some European countries. This reflects in part the failure<br />
of imagination as somecne has said, those who lack the imagination<br />
of disaster are doomed to be surprised by the world. In part it represents<br />
a fatalistic assumption that nothing can be done, a feeling of helplessness<br />
in the face of events. It is made worse by the current economic problems<br />
confronting the developed industrialised countries.<br />
Whatever its causes, it would be a tragic irony if an alliance which<br />
has held firm for three decades should falter now, when the need<br />
for it is greatest. It is imperative that the leaders of the Western<br />
world and I do not simply mean its political leaders find the<br />
words and the concepts which will fortify their peoples; and that<br />
they themselves act in a way which showrs that they mean those words.<br />
We need to understand that a people without an objective are a people<br />
lost. A people without faith are a people destroyed. A people with-cu:<br />
conviction will not survive. It is liberty which provides the objective,<br />
liberty which allows faith, liberty which sustains conviction.<br />
But liberty is not an inevitable state and there is no law which guarantees<br />
that, once achieved, liberty will survive. Its preservation requires<br />
skill, determination and strength. But first and most important of<br />
all, it requires a knowledge and understanding. by ordinary people<br />
of what is at stake for them: not an abstract concept but a whole<br />
way of life whose survival depends on their commitment to it.<br />
Once less than a lifetime ago it was possible for the voice of<br />
Churchill to bring these truths home to the Western democracies. Now,<br />
in an age that is suspicious of heroes and sceptical in temper, the<br />
task is harder. Leaders of Governments cannot master it without the<br />
support cf' crdinary men and women, their readiness to argue the<br />
case fcr libertv with intelligence and passion.<br />
What is needed in this respect is not novelty and gimmickry but the<br />
reaffirmation of some old truths in language appropriate to our times.<br />
For unfortunately, the realities of international affairs do not change<br />
simply because people find the burden of living with them heavy. 9 </p>
<p>-9<br />
In one of his novels, Saul Bellow has one of his characters comment<br />
on the contemporary craving for novelty. I will end by repeating<br />
his words: " It is sometimes necessary to repeat what all know. All map<br />
makers should place the Mississippi in the same location and<br />
avoid originality. It may be boring but one has to know where<br />
it is. We cannot have the Mississippi flowing towards the<br />
Rockies just for a change."<br />
,' lhat is true for map makers is also true for politicians and peoples.<br />
And what is true for the Mississippi is true for the Elbe and the<br />
Mekong and the Jordan.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen, I thank you again for the honour you have<br />
done me, and for the greater honour you have done my country.<br />
