0 P O F O L<br />
THE PRIME MINISTER, . R HAWKE, IS ON THE LAST STOPOVER IN HIS<br />
S . IDDLE EAST TRIP. HE ARRIVED IN CAIRO EARLIER THIS MORNING. LATER<br />
S TUDAY HE'LL 9EGIN TALKS WITH SENIOR GOVERNt. ENT PEOPLE FROM" OUR<br />
S 2IGGEST TRADE CUSTOMER IN THE REGION, INCLUDING OF COURSE THE<br />
EGYPTIAN PRESIDENT, HOSNI MUBARAK. MR HAWKE'S HARKED SHIFT I. M<br />
PERSONAL THINKINiG, TO THE POIN. T WHERE HE TOLD-HIS ISRAELIHOSTS. LAST<br />
WEEK THAT THEY SHOULD RECOGNISE THE PLO AND PARTICIPATE IN ANi<br />
INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE INCLUDING RUSSIA, WILL NO DOUBT WE WELCO; iED<br />
S It; CAIRO. BUT WHY THIS DRAMATIC CHANGE IN MR HAWKE'S THI'IKING. JUST<br />
I BEFORE THE PRIME MINISTER 30BOARDED HIS PLANE IN GENEVA OVERNIGHT OUR<br />
REPORTER TRAVELLING WITH HIS ENTOURAGE, HEATHER EWART, EXPLORED THE<br />
RAPID CHANGE OF EMPHASIS WITH HIM.<br />
' IR HrAUKE: NOW ISRAEL'S POSITION, MILITARILY AND POLITICALLY, HAS<br />
PROBABLY NEVER BEEN MORE SECURE. SO NOW TH5. ISRAELIS HAVE A<br />
DIFFERENT SET OF PROBLEMS. WHERE THEIR MIND WAS CONCENTRATED THEN,<br />
UNDERSTANDABLY, ON THE QUESTIONS OF VIABILITY, OF REMAINING SECURE,<br />
NOW THEY HAVE TO FACE THE QUESTIONS OF WHAT DO THEY DO WITHIN THIS<br />
MILITARILY AND POLITICALLY MORE SECURE POSITION OT MAKE THE<br />
ADJUSTMENT, MAKE THE DECISIONS, WHICH ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE MOST<br />
PRODUCTIVE FUTURE. ONE OF THOSE QUESTIONS THAT THEY HAVE TO LOOK AT<br />
IS THE DEMOGRAPHY OF THEIR SITUATION. WHILE THEY RETAIN THE OCCUPIED<br />
TERRITORIES AND WITH THE SUBSTANTIAL OVER-POPULATION WITHIN ISRAEL<br />
PROPER WHILE THAT GOES ON, LOOKING AT A POSITION WHEREBY AT THE END<br />
OF THE CENTURY THEY COULD BE A MINORITY IN THEIR OWN LAND, AND THAT<br />
OF COURSE IS SOMETHING WHICH UNDERSTANDABLY CONCERNS ThEM. SO IT'S<br />
THESE SORTS OF ISSUES NOW WHICH ARE MORE. IN THEIR MINDS, THAT'S IN AN<br />
ESSENTIAL SENSE WHY I SAY I SEE A DIFFERENT, A DIFFERENTLY CO"; CERN0ED<br />
ISRAEL. </p>
<p>* UESTION: YOU STUCK VERY FIR14LY TO THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT'S<br />
EVEN-HANDED POLICY ON THIS TRIP. THERE HAS BEEN A SHIFT 114 YOUR<br />
PERSONAL ATTITUDE. HOW MUCH HAS THIS TRIP CONTRIBUTED TO THAT?<br />
MRQ HAWKE: I THINK YOU ALWAYS LEARN, I MEAN A PERSON IS SILLY IF YOU<br />
DON'T LEARN FROM EVERY EXPERIENCE. AND ALL THAT'S HAPPENED ON THIS<br />
VISIT IS THROUGH VISITING JORDAN ANJD THE OPPORTUNITY OF TALKING WITH<br />
THiE FOUR PALESTINIANS IN JERUSALEM, AND IN TALKING WITH SO MANY<br />
ISRAELIS THEMSELVES, I ' VE HAD CONFIRMED THE IMPRESSION THAT I ' VE<br />
AO) A-A-Y-S--W--O-i4AT--A--R-E-S-OLUT-I ON-, OF-THE---PALE-S-T-I N IAN-P-ROBLE-M<br />
ESSEN~ TIAL PART OF THE RESOLUTIONI OF THE ISRAELI-ARAB PROBLEM.<br />
~ ESTIN:~ 1THTYOU HAVE _ qAINEO AN EVEN BETTER UNDERSTANDING THAT<br />
YOU SAY YOU HAVE REACHED ON THIS IF YOU PERHAPS HAD VISITED REFUGEE<br />
CAMPS ON THE WEST BANK AND IN THE ' GAZA STRIP.<br />
! lq HAWKE: I'VE ALREADY DONJE IT. WHEN I WENT IN ' 73 AND ' 80 CRO1WN<br />
P'I4CE HASSAN, A BROTHER OF KING HUSSEIN, TOOK INTO THE REFUGEE<br />
C 1%: I MSP.<br />
':-UESTION: BUT WHAT ABOUT AS PRIME MINISTER, GIVEN THAT YOU SAY THAT<br />
T; 4INGS ARE DIFFEREN4T NOW?<br />
~ HAlwKE: I WAS AWARE OF THE POLSOFTEPALESTINIANS. tHA T<br />
YOU'VE GOT TO REMEMBER IS THAT PRIOR TO 1967 IT WAS Il-I THE HA! 0S OF<br />
THE ARAB STATES. ONE OF THE TRAGIC FEATURES OF THE WHtOLE POST-* AAR<br />
SITUATION HAS BEEN THAT THE ARAB STATES HAVEN'T GIVEN THE ASSISTANJCE<br />
TO THE PALESTINIANS THAT THEY WERE CAPABLE OF GIVING.<br />
QUESTION: YOU'VE STRESSED THROUGHOUT THIS TRIP THAT YOU ARE NOT -EERE<br />
TO -MEDIATE, BUT IF ASKED AUSTRALIA WOULD OF COURSE PLAY WHATEVER ROLE<br />
IT COULD. DO YOU GET THE FEELING AT ALL THAT YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO<br />
PLAY A ROLE, AND, IF SO, WHAT SORT OF ROLE WOULD YOU LIKE TO PLAY?<br />
' IR HIAWKE: I DON' T WANT TO PLAY ANY ROLE OTHER THAN TO DO ANYTHING<br />
THE PARTIES PRINCIPAL M'AY ASK OF ' IE AND AUSTRALIA TO Do. I DIDN'T<br />
THERE, AND NOW GO TO EGYPT AND COME AWAY FROM THE MIDDLE EAST SAYINGP<br />
I'lI WANT A ROLE, HERE'S WHAT I CAN I HAVE ALREADY DONE<br />
SOMETHNG IN4 A SM1ALL WAY IN4 CONVEYING FROM THE KING, THE PRIME<br />
MINISTER OF JOQDA: 4, TO THE ISRAELI GOVER'JMENT THE STREuGTH OF THEIR<br />
VIEwlS, THE NATUPE OF VIEWS, THE COM4PREHENSIVENESS OF THEIR VIEWS. I<br />
WILL IJE TAKING FROM ISRAEL TO PRESIDENt MUBARAK TH4E STATEMENT THAT<br />
I'VE BEE3 ASKED TO TAKE ABOUT THE COMMIITM4ENT OF ISRAEL TO * WAflTIl! G TO<br />
DEVELOP CONSTRUCTIVE ECONOMIC CO-OPERATION BETWAEENJ ISRAE-L. AND EGYPT.<br />
I CERTAINLY WILL BE MORE THAN'. HAPPY, AS REQUESTED BY THE GO'JEQ'! rENT<br />
OF ISPAEL, ' TO MAKE REPRESEUTATIO14S TO THE SOVIET GOVERNMENT ABOUT THE<br />
lUESTIOtj OF SOVIET JEWRY. THESE THINGS I'LL DO. IF THERE'S ANYTOING<br />
THAT PRESIDENT MUBARAK WAPITS N. E TO CONVEY OR TO DO, I'LL BE HAPPY TO'<br />
DO IT. SO THAT'S THE ) 4AY I LOOK AT MlY ROLE.<br />
THE PRIME M'INISTER, MR HAWKE, INl GENEVA BEFORE HE FLEW DOWN TO. CAIRO<br />
