Mr. Chairm,-. an, L E U-i1 and Gecntlemen.<br />
Seventeen months ago th2-people of-his Lity-and this State and this<br />
count.-y had an bloctior i f: r Pec: rl-3. f or the, House of.<br />
Representatives and for-tlj,-: Serial-. r. "' Ind riery large iFJor. Uy of'<br />
the peocpl~ e of this cit%--y and this ~ a~~ and t-h-is country Said that.<br />
they waned, once z. crain, to havec I-k~ -o~ rari. t 1he'<br />

on behalf.-of the Labor Par-iw, a. nd th:Ã±^ r! u pciople on beha-lf ofC<br />
the Libnral Party and the Country P , rty all saidl that t'Aatlein<br />
was to choose a Govcernmcent for thec fallowing tie years. nve<br />
said that if we didn'lt qct a majorit~ y in thci Hoiuse of Rie. res3ent.&amp;-tives<br />
but were able to broak c., vcn only,. in the Senzite and use t. he enzaQ.(<br />
* to block the Gove rnrlent xvh _ cl had a tajority in the-Houmse of<br />
Representatives, that iqc would bloc% it, Wel were very clear wit))<br />
the public; we didn't Nant once uaprx the -; ituatian to atisc, which<br />
arose in April last year,, w,. here a~, after only sevCen1teen-1v10rthsr<br />
* the Senate threatened to block tho. i] ney ' for thc, Governwnent to cr~<br />
the affairs ofthe Nir'Lion. Everyb. oay kno-w that that had hap--tmea. C<br />
once and during the caii-paigny nobody said thpat it would happeni again<br />
if he didn't get a majority in the louisz of fersttvs. I<br />
never said it and Mr Sneddcn, who wa thne lceadeir of-thc Li. beral<br />
Party at that time, he never said it either. And for those, who<br />
* knew of DNr Fraser, hie never said it dluring the earnpaicrn. Sco the<br />
people were asked, only seventeen mihsago to say, who was to he<br />
the Government of this -country for the next three years.<br />
And the people said that they wanted another three years of a Labor<br />
Government iii Australia. And they gave the Labor Party a crmfortable<br />
* majority in the House of Representativs In thea hundreds of<br />
divisions which have takeni place in the House of. Rep re sentative r<br />
last year and this year the L~ abor Gcva-rrnent: has never been def-!* ete..<br />
And every time we have sought a vote on. anything that we put thejro,<br />
any time we've been challenged to hav-e a voto on something the<br />
O * aLnidb ecroanlsv inancdin gthlye. Countzy Party put up there, we have won it fairly<br />
Now in the Senate, the system is so complicated, we only broke even<br />
in May last year. We got 29 out of 60 Senators. The Liberals and<br />
the Country Party al. so got 29 out of 60 Senators and there were two<br />
independents. Now, in this Sta-te, we'-. ve got an overwhelming majority<br />
for the Senate, and in the whole of the coun~ try,, the Labor candidat. 1es<br />
for the Senate got 165,000 more votcf: than wore given to the<br />
candidates of every other Party in tic. o Senate. All of themi combined. rl<br />
got 165,000 fewer votes than the Labor Canjdirj ~ tes. But the zsystc) eni<br />
* is so complicated and Tasmania, one elIevoenth of N 1ew South Wales'<br />
population, still gets at. many Senators as D~ ew South Wales. We<br />
-only were 50-50 in the Senate. Now., i those-circumstances it waS<br />
reasonable enough that wia should forii the Goverrient. Gover-nmento<br />
always are formed in the House of Y1ew'-sesntatives, and not only<br />
that, only in the House of Represciit-at3. vc-s can a Mon( e-y Bill be<br />
initiated, only i~ n the House of Repro sentat.. vos carn a Money Bill.<br />
be amended. The Senate can not initii at a V~ owey BiJl le &amp; lone. Za<br />
* Budget anC. the Senate co-Lild not a a. aino ne\ ) 3iU~ let alone a<br />
Budget. Now in those circumrstances wnv were thec Govorrinceiit of<br />
Australia. We had the majority in th(-House of ) 7epresentati%, es.<br />
Now the proposition that is being pat to you now by the Liberals I. s, </p>
<p>the p eople who ve liost out in of ' s e nalive. F. t'ihe<br />
people t~ hat got 165,000 fci' VC~'. n the : 7 1t c-s1h ovTd Stil.) o.<br />

the money for the Government to cFa,-: zy on, t h i ask f or a. double<br />

Governments are nalae or unmade. An(_ i thlat Wil. not onl-y, that will<br />
not only interrupt Governiment. in Ai7 , tralia, frustzate G vrnmcn<br />
in Australia on this occasion: it will interrupt and : ifrustratn<br />
Government-in Autralia whenever th, 2 Serna te chs. oses -to reject or<br />
* delay a Money Bill. even a Budget. And we can't have 1.. hat happen<br />
asecond time. It s not just the fortunes of the prezm Govcrnrjnt<br />
the -Labor Government, my Government, it's not that; it, is the<br />
fortunes of every s~ ubsequont Covexi-:! r. nt in Pastralia whchth<br />
people choose by giving a majority its Party in the House of<br />
Representatives. I am impressed here as I was in Mlelbournp last Monday and, as my<br />
colleagues were last weekend in every other capital in Australia<br />
by the immense ntunher, the thousandr.-of people who ' ye attencled these<br />
protest rallies, who, were, born in oth; r countries. Because people<br />
from other countries know how,. fragile democracy -is: how much, how<br />
often, how ruthlessly the corneraLv recinr1 ore1ilkl<br />
democracy when they th-ink they can cuet away with it. And one of the<br />
things that enthused and elated and up].. fted thia migqrants in Austrai<br />
was that in December 1972 they saw that in Australia after the hard<br />
fought campaign, at a secret-ballot, it was possible to change thi_<br />
Government. And they expfected that Government to have at least<br />
3 years, not just from December ' 72 to April they expected it<br />
to have 3 years. And when they made! their great, their immense<br />
contribution to reelecting that Government in May last year, they<br />
expected it to have 3 years and not just seventeen months. And we<br />
-don't want the system in Australia that has bedevilled and weakened<br />
democracy in so many countries f rom which migrants-have come, whcre<br />
Governments change too f requently, where no government has the.<br />
opportunity to carry-out its program. In Australia we elect<br />
Governments, it's always been thought, for three years an t h<br />
end of three years there is a ballot, a secret ballot-, a-free<br />
W campaign and you can then decide whcet*;-her you want to have the<br />
Government for another three years or whether you want another Party<br />
to be the Government also for three years.<br />
And what is at stake now is not whether you will have House of<br />
Represent ative s elections every one and a hal~ f years, which is what<br />
the Liberals are now saying, but whether you. could have House of<br />
* Representatives elections every six rmonths. Bec-use twics every<br />
year the House of Repre sent at ive s paFsses Buqttide Bills, Supply<br />
Bills. Every year in October the House of Representatives passes<br />
Bills which will carry out the whole of the -financial arrangerilents<br />
of Australia from July to June!, the whole twelve months. And thenin<br />
April every year the House of Rep -PsentatZ'ves passes other ' Bill.: s<br />
as to how much money yuwlhae how you w'ill spen t3he iiin. n! y<br />
from July to Noveraber followuing; twi. ce a year, in Oct-ol) Ar and in<br />

of Australia who depend on the Australian Goveritent for payment for<br />
their services or ' thoir supplies, we :, hall not. zJlow theiri to be l'etdown.<br />
But mEantime we are determined th,-* t the Australian Governmenrt<br />
wil-govern for the three years for which you elected us. We will.<br />
I'd ask you to note -that the Senalte has not rejected the Budget,<br />
it's only deferred-t it's delayed it, stalled it. Dccause even<br />
the most cussed and unprincipled and greedy * Liberals realise t-hat<br />
this would be a step that * has never beecn taken in A7 str. to eea<br />
Federal Budget. It's never been done and they hesitate to do it.<br />
In the House of Representatives, it's, true, they ' ye twice vote(' aqainrr. t<br />
all the Budget Bills, they did so a imntli agoo theny did so this weekj..<br />
But when the Bills go to the Senate thecy hesitate; they don't vote<br />
against them, they Just move an arnendv,., cnt_ to de1fe--r them. Now I would<br />
-point out that they would rnot be able to carry these amenrdrients to<br />
defer the Budget had not a* Labor Senat11or, SenetI-or Milliner from<br />
Queensland, di~ d f our moriths ago. Anil M BjeJ) kc--Petersen appoirited<br />
a non-Labor Senator to take the place of~ Labor' s Senator Milliner.<br />
WNow if the Labor Senattor Milliner waz: still alii. ve he would be voting<br />
in the Senate with his Labor-colleagjuc~ s as he had done in every day<br />
of his life. And this amendment to d c'ay the Budget would not have.<br />
been passed. The Senate would have bcen evenily oivided. And in<br />
the Senate, if there's as many peoplc voting aqainst a proposition<br />
as for a proposition if the numb,-r: are eqi-al, then the proposition<br />
is lost. And that's the basis of Sen;: te demtocracy. That is, thse<br />
House of Representatives should have 1iJ0ujoity the Sc. nate c,-In<br />
evenly divided but. yet the Senate pre-vail because you need<br />
a majority of votes to get somethint'-ibhrough the. Senate. Now if<br />
Senator Milliner were still alive he N,. ou3 d bc vot ing against the<br />
amtendment which the Liberals have mnv( d to ftfer the Budcfet; to Oelay<br />
the budget; to stall the budget; thlmro would be as nan-y pCeo:,-. le<br />
voting against the amndcid motion Fa: fo~ r it , c it wou'id be lost. </p>

the Liberals are torrified of the p~ opular r&amp; pnewhich the preople<br />
-will show this 1judget when it p.'. SSeO.<br />
Now you sometimes hear, ' Well what about a ( o( ublce dissointiorn?<br />
may well be that in due cours'e there .% ill a double 6jssoliutin.<br />
But not yet. And I'll tell you why you can' have a dovile di: s '. utio<br />
on the Budget. For one thing, if yoi) Nwere to hve a do-obl. e dsotion,<br />
this is what has to happen. The Sei) te has eJeoc t i. illadte<br />
3 months later the Bill has to be passed acg-. in by the P. Ouse of:<br />
Representatives, pas; sed a second tieby the House of Represent6. t: ves<br />
and rejected a second time by the Senate. So if we were to haveLv an<br />
election, a double dissolution, on the Budgctryou Couledi't haCve. f. t:<br />
for at least 4 months arid th1 Senate would have t eette] hqt<br />
' not just * delay it, reject it; thenz 3 months later we'd have to de:. batza<br />
it again. The whole of that process would talKe abouL 4 nonthsq. thl-at<br />
is, if the Senators next Tuesday, were to rejnct the Budcjet, We couldn't<br />
introduce it again in the House of Representati~ ves for another 3<br />
months and then in about a fortnight we-might b able to have the<br />
vote in the Senate on the second occasion. An6i if it were rejcctod<br />
a second tine you could have a double dissolution on the Budg~ et You<br />
couldn't have it for 5 or 6 weeks a'fter it was rejected and then<br />
the last double disFolution, the one that was hce0d last May, it took<br />
over two months to count; for 3 montho AustraliLa was without a<br />
Parliament, the Parliamn wa isfeo h 0 April last y( ar<br />
and it couldn't me et until the 9 July last year.' For 3 Months less<br />
one day, Australia was without a ParJliainent and the whole of the<br />
Goveznment and Public Servants were tied up for 3 moribhs.-Now<br />
ifyou want a double dissolution, on the Budcet you roul@ n It.. yu<br />
want the Budget now. A double disselution couldIn't be held on the<br />
Budget? the Parliament couldnr't meet-to vote on the Budget. another<br />
time for 5 or 6 months fromn now. You can't wait that long; you<br />
shouldA~ be fobbed off from the benefits of Bil1l Hayden's fltudgot<br />
for another 6 months. You want to get: the bcnef its in amonth~ s time<br />
as you are entitled to have them.<br />
Now there may be a double dissolution before-P by about the end of<br />
next year, if the Senate keeps on the obstructionr it has uptil now.<br />
Because in the 3 years that we've been in Govcr; ment thce Senate has<br />
rejected more bills that it passed in the previous 72 ye2ars.<br />
From 1901 till 1972, the whole of those 72 years, the Senate has not<br />
rejected as many bills as it has already rejected in 1973-4-5. Now<br />
if we hadn't had the double dissolution last Ilay,, it's tyue we<br />
wouldn't have got througlr the Medibank B3ill. You wouldi' t have had.<br />
Medibank and you wouldn't have been ablc to got through the -; Ai. 11s<br />
which provide that everybody' s vote in Aiist-rajia will Le of equal<br />
value. But while the B ills have gon-e tlthrough the SeriateC., on A. occusions<br />
has rejected the proposals ' which will carry out that elinctoral<br />
distribution. Because what is at the heart of the objeciion by tbre </p>
<p>Liberal., a. ndj thc Co--.-ixtry Par~ ty to my'G~ erf~ t is thn.-. rRy<br />
Gove rmt : Is dL: indt( -, cc that.. Aiwsta . ian-: wherev'er they<br />

State of New Sou-th W~ ales treare eleot-orTLesr so:-ae Federal,<br />
electorates who.-n there are fewrer th--n 50,000 pe): oplte with a vote<br />
and there-are other electorate-. s in Soifth W, 1res whoj-there<br />

countries, at loc-~ t. the el. rte hav the sne num1 of p eo,.<br />
in themn. They are dead scared -that : Uf we have a half S: neate election,<br />
which we -will before the end of next Junetwc'li, be able to. get a<br />
fair electoral system through the Senate at last.<br />
Now, you've got the remrd of the Sonate in cgeneiral, ino: e bills<br />
defeated in 3 years than in -the provwious 72. Itht the r. resent<br />
issue is the Budget. -And' what's the alternativc? The onrl'Y*<br />
alternative that Mr Fraser has put 13:-to tho JBu( g( et i1s toa bring<br />
in doubl1e taxation. So that there \ Li II be ia Stzl: te systo'n of incoine<br />
taxation on top 9f the Federal system. We abandoned. tht back Jn<br />
1942; w. e don't want that unncqua1 sys. temt bac! k in AustraJ. i: a. And<br />
every othnr. feature, what he said about the lluelloet, what he said in<br />
his own speech on the Budget is now'-O e says;' inoperativc!' It's a<br />
great wqord which camie f rom President Nixon," " Ino-ecrative.<br />
That not only have. they now abandoncd, as of Wedniesday<br />
* week thle Budget proposal~ s they put up, but they i-ow say t~ hat if 7 c<br />
have an electionfor the House of Representatives now, that is if<br />
I accept their biackmrai-l-as I did in April last year, what would<br />
they do? They ' d pass the Budget.<br />
Now you see the whole design*. they don't have any objection to the<br />
Budget; their own alternative Budget is now inoperative.' it's been<br />
exposed; it's been abandoned and they say if we have an caection of<br />
the House of Represcntati-ves -as if that's any buiesof the<br />
blasted Senate then they'll1 pass the Budget through the Senate.<br />
Or alternatively, if there's a double dissolution, we c,-n wait for<br />
5 or 6 months to pass thE, Budget. The other thing is to have ai-j<br />
Welection for hal~ f the Senate only. Now that-wouldn't be a bad ide!,;-<br />
it's the usual time of the year to hzive them., I know that Sir<br />
Robert Menzies said. I What a monsterous idea, what a monsterous<br />
idea to have an election for the Senate in November or Decermber'.<br />
* Now when Sir Robert Menzies was Prine MiniStEr he bad 6 cle( otions<br />
for the Senate one of themt was in April, for the ScnatorF; ' to take<br />
office in July and the other 4 were in December or November previously.<br />
That is, 7 or 8 months ahlead of when the Senators were to tzake off ie.<br />
And -the sixth one was in September, 9 nonths before they were to take<br />
office. And now he says what an impertinence. it would ba to have a<br />
half Senate election now, lie forgets what he did; he always had them<br />
about thiz-tim-e of the year. But thejc-e is a catchb, because<br />
*. Mr Bjelke-Peterson-and pardon me for meritioni. ng, it agai. 7n he said<br />
that if the Goverior--e neral, in a usual waywrites to allt the State<br />
Governors and says, ' T.; Jell I suggest arid requeist that you. j iss; ue the<br />
writs to the Senators for your State en such and such a dae tiion<br />
the Governor of Queensland, Sir Colin flannah you'd never heard ofhim<br />
before he spoke out of tuirn a fortnight og-he will. lie advisr: d<br />

say to the Governor-Cceneral, ' I ' ll ta'Ke no notice of you-,. sug-gestion,<br />
I'll have it on a date which suits mne'. ' So that means that we, </p>
<p>can'It get a Labor replacemnent for Senator Milliner, the ec-: A<br />

want to be able to pass motions to defer the Budget. They wi: U only<br />
be able to p! ss thos.* e motions, as Senator Ste _ 1e Pall said, ' ove., r<br />
a deSdc ormsen'.' T ha i-the way the ! J. berajls and the Country<br />
Party operate. They take advantage of deceas'ed Senators and thcy<br />
* want to bury daimiocracy in the process-. Because this : Ls what' tha<br />
conse-rvatives, the reactionary iorces, in this countrv are precpe--! re~<br />
* to do. For t-he first tii in 75 years they're prepared, it may bc,<br />
to reject the Budget. They're certainly prepared to defer and<br />
delay a Budget. It's never happened in 75 years: In the hnndrcrd an~ d<br />
f if ty ' times that there has been a .1udget or Supply put up from. t--he<br />
Huos fX~ preenat* Lves to the Senate. There could havo befenr 339<br />
Bills rejected, Money Bills rejecte,, d, by the Senate on the OcCOE:-jofl3<br />
when there was not a majority of Government support in the Snie<br />
But it has never-happened before. For the first timc in the 25 veroYs<br />
since we had proport-ional voting for the Senate, for the first tiim,<br />
here in New South Wales, now, in Queensland, you have anti-Labor. Stat', e<br />
Governments appointing a non-Labor successor to a Labor Senator,.<br />
W When we put Labor's Attorney-Gerieral Murphy on the High Court to<br />
pair off with the Liberal Attorney--cenera). B( rwick, they appoint an<br />
anti-Labor Senator. That is, when Senator Milliner died they<br />
appointed an anti-Labor successor. . For the first time in 20 years<br />
U State Governments each State, both sides of politics have done<br />
the wrong thing; the conservatives have done the wrong thinq. A-nd<br />
now they are threatening that when I advise the Governor-Genieral to<br />
* suggest a Senate election date for the State Governors, some oE tLhem<br />
say they'll advise the Governors to disregard what the Governor-<br />
General says. And this comes from people who are now asking the<br />
Governor-General t~ o get them off the hook, to cover up for their<br />
mistakes. There is nothing, ladies and reten thtIh<br />
* conservative forces in this country are not prepared to do to get hold<br />
of the people's money again: to reject or delay the Budget; to<br />
