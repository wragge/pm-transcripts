PRIME MINVISTER<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING<br />
TO THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 6 DECEMBER 1994<br />
THE APEC INFORMAL LEADERS' MEETING, BOGOR, INDONESIA<br />
I want to report to the House on the results of the second informal meeting of the<br />
leaders of APEC economies, which I attended in Bogor, Indonesia, on 15 November.<br />
It is not overstating the case to suggest that the Bogor meeting, and the Declaration of<br />
Common Resolve which leaders issued afterwards, has permanently changed the nature<br />
of our region and the fu~ ture of Australia.<br />
For nearly forty years, Australians have spoken loosely about what we have called " our<br />
region" of the world. We have regularly talked about our " northern neighbours". But<br />
until now these phrases have been statements of aspiration or hollow cliches rather<br />
than descriptions of reality and real national intent.<br />
What our region was, where it extended, who was in it, whether the others we claimed<br />
as partners accepted that role, was always uncertain indeed unknowable.<br />
With Bogor, however, Australians can say for the first time that the region around us is<br />
truly " our region".<br />
We know its shape; we have an agreed institutional structure; we share with its other<br />
members a common agenda for change.<br />
Historical turning points are rare and, like phantoms, they are seen more often than<br />
they are found to exist.<br />
But I am certain, Mr Speaker, that the Bogor meeting will be seen as such a turning<br />
point as the beginning of the Pacific century.<br />
Just as the Bretton Woods agreements after the Second World War established<br />
structures in the LIMF and the World Bank which enabled the world to grow and<br />
prosper, so in APEC we have established a model which will serve the interests of the<br />
post-Cold War world.<br />
It brings together in one multilateral framework a grouping which by 2020 will include,<br />
according to some estimates, seven of the world's ten largest economies, and which by<br />
the end of the century will account for 57 per cent of world trade. </p>
<p>It gives all the economies Iof this region developed, newly industrialised and<br />
developing a stake in a cooperative enterprise whose aim is to maintain the dynamism<br />
and growth in this part of the world.<br />
It offers business people the opportunity to plan with confidence as Governments work<br />
to remove unnecessary blockages to trade and investment.<br />
It engages the United States, China and Japan in a structure which minimises the<br />
danger that trade frictions will eventually lead to strategic tension.<br />
Between my arrival in Jakarta on 13th November and my departure on the 16th, I held<br />
bilateral discussions with Prime Minister Chretien of Canada, Prime Minister Mahathir<br />
of Malaysia, President Jiang Zemin of China, Prime Minister Chuan of Thailand,<br />
President Clinton, President Soeharto, President Ramos of the Philippines and Prime<br />
Minister Bolger.<br />
The day before I left, on 12th November, 1 met President Frei of Chile in Sydney. And,<br />
of course, President Kim Young Sam of Korea visited Australia immediately after the<br />
Bogor meeting.<br />
APEC was, of course, a central element in all these discussions, but they also enabled<br />
me to cover some important bilateral issues.<br />
Dr Mahathir and I were able to agree, for example, on the need to improve exchanges<br />
6RN67en'Nalaysia and Australia in the area of science and technology.<br />
Pre sident Frei and I agreed to encourage Chilean and Australian business people to use<br />
each counti-y as a base for expanding business in South America and Asia respectively.<br />
I was able to have a very frank and productive discussion with Prime Minister Chuan<br />
about Cambodia and Thai-Australian relations.<br />
My own experience was replicated by the other leaders. The easy opportunity to hold<br />
high-level discussions like these gives APEC leaders' meetings a value additional to<br />
APEC's economic agenda.<br />
The informal leaders' meeting was hosted by President Soeharto on 15 November in<br />
Bogor. I want to pay tribute, Mr Speaker, to President Soeharto's chairing of APEC during<br />
the year and at the Bogor meeting. A consensus of the 18 APEC economies on these<br />
very large issues was an extraordinary achievement. It required great leadership and<br />
vision, and President Soeharto provided that. We would not have achieved this<br />
outcome without him.<br />
As was the case in Seattle last year, the Bogor meeting was held without officials<br />
present and without a pre-set agenda. </p>
<p>Following consultations between leaders' assistants, President Soeharto had prepared a<br />
draft declaration covering our common ambitions for APEC and its economic goals.<br />
These subjects formed the focus for much of our discussion.<br />
The central element in the Bogor Declaration of Common Resolve is a commitment to<br />
free trade and investment in the region by 2010 for industrialised economies and 2020<br />
for developing economies.<br />
And what underpins that commitment is our recognition of the growing<br />
interdependence of regional economies and the need to work together if we are to<br />
maintain high rates of economic growth.<br />
APEC's commitment to free trade was made in the context of our support for the<br />
multilateral trading system and our desire to strengthen it.<br />
In other words, Mr Speaker, APEC leaders showed that they were opposed to the<br />
establishment of a closed and inward-looking organisation, but wanted whatever we<br />
did in APEC to be additional to the GATT agreement GATT-plus.<br />
We agreed, for example, to accelerate the implementation of our Uruguay Round<br />
commitments and to undertake work aimed at deepening and broadening the Round's<br />
outcome.<br />
We called for the successful launching of the World Trade Organisati' 1on in January<br />
1995 and for all APEC members to work with non-APEC members to achieve further<br />
multilateral trade liberalisation through the WTO.<br />
One of APEC's major benefits, in fact, is that by engaging the United States and East<br />
Asian economies in a common framework it helps prevent the spectre of a world<br />
divided into three hostile trade blocs in Europe, Asia and the Americas.<br />
We agreed to a " standstill" commitment on a best endeavours basis to refrain from<br />
increasing measures of protection.<br />
We also decided to expand APEC's trade and investment facilitation program.<br />
As a result of a proposal I made in Seattle, for example, we have now endorsed nonbinding<br />
investment principles for the region which we will develop to make investment<br />
flows in the region easier.<br />
The trade facilitation program, on which a good deal of progress has already been<br />
made, will become even more important to our business people as tariffs in the region<br />
come down.<br />
Ministers have been asked to draw up proposals for APEC arrangements to improve<br />
customs procedures, establish common standards and lower administrative barriers to<br />
market access. In this area of trade facilitation, APEC economies that are ready to<br />
implement a cooperative arrangement may do so, while those that are not yet ready to<br />
participate may join at a later date. </p>
<p>In Australia's case, for example, we are already discussing with a number of APEC<br />
economies, such as Malaysia, Korea, Canada, New Zealand and the United States, the<br />
possibility of an agreement under which we would mutually recognise each others'<br />
testing and conformance arrangements.<br />
The Bogor Declaration also gives further impetus to the dialogue on economic policy<br />
which began with the first meeting of APEC Finance Ministers earlier this year. In my<br />
view, these consultations on economic growth strategies, regional capital flows and<br />
other macro-economic issues will become more important for APEC over the next few<br />
years. Another new approach in the Declaration comes in the decision to examine the<br />
establishment of a voluntary consultative dispute mediation service, to supplement the<br />
World Trade Organisation's dispute settlement mechanism. APEC's informal and nonbinding<br />
approach offers a useful, non-adversarial way of dealing with regional trade<br />
disputes. One of APEC's most valuable dimensions is the way it brings together developed<br />
economies, newly industrialised economies and developing countries.<br />
When APEC talks about trade and economic issues, when it frames its actions, it has<br />
to take into account the full complexity of eighteen economies all looking for growth<br />
and liberalisation, but at different stages of development.<br />
As I have said before, this is important because it is the way the global economy is<br />
going. Co-operation across different levels of development is the way we will have to<br />
address these trade and economic issues in future.<br />
That is what made theBogor agreement remarkable it was an agreement reached<br />
within the framework for the_ future. Bogor was not about catching up or rectifying<br />
past mistakes. It was visionary in a rare sense and a true sense.<br />
We agreed at Bogor, for example, that in addition to our trade liberalisation and trade<br />
facilitation agendas we should expand co-operative activity across the fields of<br />
education and training, science and technology, small and medium enterprises,<br />
economic infrastructure including energy, transportation, telecommunications and<br />
tourism and sustainable development.<br />
In all these areas, in fact, APEC is already building linkages and discovering new areas<br />
for co-operation.<br />
Leaders at Bogor recognised the important contribution made to regional debate by<br />
the Em~ inent Persons Giroup and the Pacific Business Forum, representing large and<br />
small businesses throughout the region.<br />
It was decided to ask these two groups to continue in operation to advise us on ways<br />
we can step up APEC co-operation.<br />
I am pleased to announce that Australia's participants in these groups Mr Neville<br />
Wran on the EPG, and Mr Philip Brass, Managing Director of Pacific Dunlop and Mrs </p>
<p>Imelda Roche, Managing Director of Nutri-metics on the Pacific Business Forum<br />
have accepted my invitation to continue in their positions.<br />
All three of them have put enormous effort into the APEC task and I thank them for it.<br />
I am confident that their experience and commitment will help us meet the new<br />
challenges APEC has set itself<br />
But the most important new decision to come from the Bogor meeting was on trade<br />
liberalisation. The Bogor commitment is precise, wherein the leaders agreed to " complete the<br />
achievement of the goal of free and open trade in the Asia Pacific no later than 2020",<br />
with industrialised economies achieving the goal no later than 2010.<br />
The goal involves a multiple year effort but, as the declaration says, " we will start our<br />
concerted liberalisation process from the very date of this statement. We direct our<br />
Ministers and officials to immediately begin preparing detailed proposals for<br />
implementing our present decisions."<br />
We have a long way to go before free trade is implemented in APEC. Much detailed<br />
work remains to be done before we get an agreed plan of action for our meeting in<br />
Osaka next year. No doubt there will be difficult negotiations and hard talk as we<br />
chart the way forward.<br />
Complex issues will need to be addressed, including modalities, coverage and whether<br />
benefits will be extended on a Most Favoured Nation basis.<br />
It may be that APEC will need to approach these issues in quite a different way from<br />
past trade negotiations.<br />
But contrary to the belief of some commentators, I do not think these next steps will<br />
be the most difficult part. Perhaps the most complicated. Perhaps the most timeconsuming.<br />
But not the hardest.<br />
That part was getting the political commitment to a free trade goal for all APEC<br />
economies made by the 18 leaders at Bogor.<br />
That was what has given the region the negotiating agenda which will carry us<br />
forward. My views of the Bogor outcome were shared by my colleagues there. As Prime<br />
Minister Bolger has said: " The level of commitment from leaders was remarkable it<br />
is truly going to change the nature of trade in the world in the next five years."<br />
President Ramos has described the Bogor declaration as " A truly momentous decision<br />
a very solid road map that we are all committed to follow." President Clinton said<br />
he was convinced the declaration will be of historic importance. Prime Minister Goh<br />
of Singapore said the declaration has " sown the seeds for prosperity in the region".<br />
Like Mr Vincent Siew of Taiwan, Prime Minister Goh has committed his country to<br />
the 20 10 timetable for free trade for industrialised economies. I </p>
<p>The advantages for Australia and the region of the commitments made in Bogor are<br />
very great.<br />
Modelling by the Office of National Assessments and the Industry Commission<br />
suggests that free trade in APEC would more than triple the national income gains<br />
from the Uruguay Round outcome alone to more than $ 300 billion.<br />
For Australia, we estimate that under APEC free trade, Australia's real output would<br />
rise by 3.8 per cent and real national income by 1.2 per cent.<br />
This would include a 27 per cent increase in Australian exports and a 20 per cent<br />
projected rise in imports. Once the effects of APEC trade liberalisation have fully<br />
flowed through, we can expect a permanent increase in employment of over 200,000<br />
jobs. The great advantage for Australia will come from the opening up of the fast-growing<br />
APEC markets that already take three quarters of our exports.<br />
It will come, too, from making Australia more attractive to investors from the rest of<br />
the world.<br />
For Australian business and workers, APEC trade liberalisation is good news because<br />
Australia is already so far down the path towards free trade.<br />
As Philip Brass of Pacific Dunlop has said " For Australia, it is all up-side."<br />
By 2000, a full decade before we are committed to achieve free trade, Australia's<br />
average trade-weighted tariff will be just 2.9 per cent. In 1986/ 87 it was 10.7 per cent.<br />
Even in industries we have come to think of as highly protected, such as textiles,<br />
clothing and footwear and motor vehicles, tariffs will be low by 2000 only 15 per<br />
cent in the case of motor vehicles and between 5 per cent and 25 per cent for TCF.<br />
This is amongst the lowest in the region. Tariffs on passenger motor vehicles range<br />
from 100 to 300 per cent in some APEC economies, for example, and non-tariff<br />
barriers are common.<br />
So a great deal of our adjustment has already happened. Australian industry has<br />
already shown it is more than capable of competing in a low tariff environment.<br />
While average trade-weighted tariffs have come down by 44 per cent over the past<br />
decade, Australia's exports of manufactures have grown by more than 17 per cent a<br />
year in the case of elaborately transformed manufactures.<br />
Even in the areas of passenger vehicles and textiles clothing and footwear, companies<br />
like Toyota, which plans to lift exports from Australia from $ 47 million in 1990 to<br />
$ 600 million by 2000, will benefit from lower APEC barriers.<br />
I have said before that APEC gives Australia for the first time a seat at a very large<br />
table. But the extent of the benefits we or any of the others will gain, and the extent to </p>
<p>which our voice is heard at this table, will depend on each of us; on our recognition of<br />
the need for change and improvement; on our ability to use the resources we have<br />
effectively and efficiently; on our imagination and creativity.<br />
This is a large challenge that lies ahead for all of us in Australia for governments, for<br />
business, for our unions, for our education and training system.<br />
Our officials at home and abroad will have to liaise even more closely with industry.<br />
Our business people across the board will have to understand the region better.<br />
We will have to maintain the pressure for micro-economic reform.<br />
To coordinate our response to these challenges, the Government has decided to<br />
establish an ad hoc APEC committee of Cabinet.<br />
I will chair the committee, with the Minister for Trade as Deputy Chair. Other<br />
members will include the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Treasurer, the Minister for<br />
Industry, Science and Technology, the Minister for Employment, Education and<br />
Training, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, the Minister for Transport<br />
and the Minister for Communications and the Arts.<br />
Detailed sectoral consultations will be undertaken by all the relevant Industry Ministers<br />
to make sure we understand industry concerns and aspirations.<br />
The Government's White Paper on employment, Working Nation provided for TCF<br />
and PMV assistance arrangements to be reviewed sdfdecisions iia-nie taken in 1997 on<br />
post-2000 arrangements. These reviews will take account of what progress is being<br />
made on trade liberalisation in APEC. Through my colleagues Senator Cook and<br />
Senator McMullan the industry will be fu~ lly involved in these decisions.<br />
APEC has consistently confounded the sceptics.<br />
Just twelve months ago the British journal, The Economist, described suggestions that<br />
APEC should aim to form a free-trade area as " the stuff as dreams are made on".<br />
In a sense they were right, but not in the way the Eurocentric editorial staff meant.<br />
Last year, Australian newspapers were claiming that my ambition for APEC to become<br />
an Asia-Pacific community was premature.<br />
Yet, this year, without the slightest controversy, the Bogor declaration spoke of our<br />
" moving toward a community of Asia-Pacific economies".<br />
Why has APEC continued to go fujrther, faster, than the doubters expected?<br />
Because it makes sense for all the diverse economies of the region.<br />
I have said before that APEC did not have to happen. When the Cold War bindings<br />
were removed, the development of a cooperative structure like this was neither<br />
predictable nor inevitable. The next generation would probably have forgiven us for </p>
<p>failing to see the possibilities for letting the opportunity pass because it was<br />
" 1premature" or the " stuff of dreams".<br />
There was certainly nothing inevitable about the Bogor declaration. It was an act of<br />
will by regional leaders and an act of goodwill. It was the result of imagination and<br />
co-operation.<br />
Alternative Asia Pacific futures were possible.<br />
We might have seen the growth of a self-confident but inward-looking Asian grouping,<br />
building on East Asian trade and investment flows and excluding Australia.<br />
In my view that would have had the most serous consequences not only for the<br />
economic growth of Asia and the Pacific but for the strategic stability of the region.<br />
Over time it would inevitably have attenuated the defence and security partnership<br />
between the United States and Japan with a broader impact throughout the region.<br />
On the other hand, the region might have drifted along as before, buffeted by internal<br />
and external frictions, but developing no institutional framework to deal with them.<br />
It is true that the economic integration of Asia was underway before APEC began and<br />
that even in the absence of such a structure it would no doubt have continued.<br />
But it would be a very different sort of integration more ad hoc, driven by companies<br />
working in their narrower interests and less open to Australia and Australian business.<br />
We would have failed to engage the rapidly developing Chinese economy, or Indonesia<br />
and the other South East Asian countries, in a broader regional framework. A critical<br />
opportunity and one which is open for only a very short time would have been lost.<br />
For Australia, either of these paths would have made for a stultified Australian<br />
economy, strategic uncertainty and political isolation.<br />
Instead, this Government chose the path of shaping the future for ourselves and the<br />
region. Australia proposed APEC. We worked with other regional countries like<br />
Korea to develop it. And now we have given it new institutional focus and energy by<br />
proposing regular meetings of leaders to give it the executive authority that the<br />
ministerial level meeting could never have had to give it the power to make the sort<br />
of decisions taken at Bogor. I am very proud of what Australia has been able to do.<br />
The Bogor declaration will help ensure that this generation of Australians and our<br />
successors, have a dynamic role in their own region.<br />
I said recently at the National Strategies Conference in Sydney that our most<br />
fundamental responsibility is to provide for the next generation as we were provided<br />
for to provide the conditions for security and prosperity and opportunities for talent<br />
and energy.<br />
Simple hard work and earnest intentions will not of themselves deliver these things.<br />
The world has changed and we all must change with it. </p>
<p>The Bogor agreement was a recognition of this fact.<br />
It is, of course, no reason to make less of our effort here in Australia. On the contrary,<br />
because Bogor has, in an unprecedented way, taken on the responsibility to provide a<br />
better world in the 21st century, the challenges for us are more obvious and immediate.<br />
The Australia in which I grew up was a prosperous and secure place. It was then and<br />
it is now an extraordinarily good place to live.<br />
But if we are to maintain our way of life, the Australia of the 21st century will need to<br />
be built on different foundations. Our success in the world will depend on our<br />
effective integration with it. Our success in the world's most dynamic region will also<br />
depend on this.<br />
Bogor does not assure us of prosperity. It does not guarantee the future for the next<br />
generation of Australians. That will continue to depend on the efforts of Australian<br />
governments, Australian businesses and Australian workers.<br />
But Bogor creates a massive opportunity and I think every Australian should be aware<br />
of it.<br />
I think every Australian should know that the chance really is there. In the next<br />
century, to be Australian should mean not only the privileges we currently enjoy, but a<br />
share in the extraordinary economic and cultural riches of the Asia-Pacific, and a<br />
creative role in our region's remarkable progress. This opportunity is, I think, an<br />
exciting prospect. I </p>
