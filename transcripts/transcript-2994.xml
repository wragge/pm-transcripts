28 August-1973<br />
GOVERNMENT POLICY ON THE MOTOR INDUSTRY<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER,<br />
MR. E. G. WHITLAM AND THE<br />
MINISTER FOR SECONDARY INDUSTRY,<br />
DR. J. F. CAIRNS<br />
Cabinet has laid down new rules and objectives for<br />
the Australian motor industry. The Government desires to<br />
improve the efficiency with which the community's productive<br />
resources are used and to recognise the interests of consumers.<br />
The Tariff Board has been informed of the Government's<br />
policy. Motor vehicle firms, including Nissan and Toyota,<br />
are being invited to submit to the board statements of action<br />
they propose to take, and of action they consider the<br />
Government should take, to give effect to the policy.<br />
The board has been asked to present its report by the end<br />
of October 1973. Firms are urged to furnish their statements<br />
to the board as promptly as possible.<br />
The Government intends that the industry must operate<br />
at the highest possible level of efficiency and economic<br />
management and with high Australian content. The vehicles must<br />
afford a high level of safety in construction and use and have<br />
effective anti-pollution devices. The industry must be well<br />
located for social, employment and environmental purposes.<br />
There should be improved labour relations and production<br />
techniques, and a substantial Australian participation,<br />
including equity, in the industry.<br />
The Government does not believe that its policy can be<br />
implemented by conventional tariff action alone. The Government<br />
believes that its policy will involve product rationalisation,<br />
joint use of resources, prevention of model proliferation and<br />
relatively greater manufacture of light cars in Australia.<br />
It is envisaged that some regulation of imports may be<br />
necessary. ./ 2 </p>
<p>As part of the Government's plan, the Minister<br />
for Defence and Supply, Mr. Barnard, has been authorised to<br />
obtain a report from the Government Aircraft Factory<br />
on the possibility of its manufacturing a car in Australia.<br />
Australia is now a regional centre for the<br />
automotive industry, and the Government's policy recognises<br />
that manufacturers may wish to co-ordinate their Australian<br />
production with other manufacturing facilities in the Asian<br />
and Pacific region. Manufacturers' import and export plans<br />
would therefore be related to Australian production.<br />
The Government hat agreed that the Japanese companies,<br />
Toyota and Nissan, should be offered an opportunity to<br />
manufacture in Australia. All companies in the industry, including<br />
Nissan and Toyota, will be invited to submit to the Tariff Board<br />
statements of the action they propose to take to give effect to<br />
the policy objectives of the Government.<br />
Since Nissan and Toyota are only now commencing<br />
manufacture in Australia, the Minister for Secondary Industry<br />
has been authorised to have discussions with them about<br />
Government participation in their operations in Australia.<br />
The Government expects the Tariff Board, in making<br />
its recommendations, to indicate the cost to consumers and the<br />
other effects, including those upon employment and environment,<br />
of any action it recommends. The board will also be asked<br />
to consider other measures, such as subsidies, taxation<br />
concessions and Government investment, which together with<br />
tariffs and " plan-type" recommendations, would best insure<br />
the effective implementation of the Government's aims.<br />
