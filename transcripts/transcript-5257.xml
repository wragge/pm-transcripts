ADDRESS TO THE NATION<br />
I speak to you at the earliest possible opportunity, following<br />
Andrew Peacock's discussions in South and South East Asia, and my<br />
own discussions in the United States, Europe and New Zealand.<br />
The purpose of our visits was to seek a plain exchange of views<br />
about the invasion of Afghanistan by the Soviet Union. These<br />
consultations are essential to help us in the responsible<br />
development of Australia's foreign policy. Beyond that, it would<br />
be irresponsibl: 2 merely to sit back and fail to act on great issues<br />
which are of ultimate importance to us merely because others<br />
have not acted before us. That would be a poor way for Australia's<br />
government to safeguard the interests of this nation.<br />
We sought to consult with our regional partners and with world<br />
leaders about this act of Soviet aggression and the nature of the<br />
response that is needed. When Afghanistan was invaded over seven<br />
weeks ago, I described the behaviour of the Soviet Union as an<br />
act of ruthless opportunism; an act of expansion with potentially<br />
grave consequences. These views have been reinforced by our<br />
meetings with the leaders of major European and Asian countries<br />
and most recently New Zealand.<br />
It was known before we left that, broadly speaking the United<br />
States' views would be similar to our own. But previous reports<br />
indicated that the European response might be somewhat different.<br />
Instead, what we found in Europe was an essential coincidence<br />
of views about the Soviet's behaviour; a recognition-that it has<br />
created new and serious tensions.<br />
In fact, on the eve of my meeting with Chancellor Schmidt, he<br />
and the President of France, in a joint statement, spoke of the'<br />
Soviet intervention as unacceptable, creating grave dangers for<br />
peace. The brutal takeover of the government of Afghanistan<br />
and the assassination of its leader have been almost universally<br />
condemned. They have created uncertainty and apprehension.<br />
As Australians, we must realise the increasing importance to<br />
Australia of what is going on in other parts of the world.<br />
In both Europe and Asia, a principal point about the invasion<br />
and occupation of Afghanistan was that it represented an attack<br />
on a non-aligned country, a member of the Third World, and a<br />
member of the Islamic Conference. ./ 2 </p>
<p>Striving to be free from the effects of rivalry between super<br />
powers, all non-aligned countries must now seriously ask how<br />
they can protect themselves from Soviet aggression in the future.<br />
On this occasion, the Soviet Union has shown scant respect for<br />
non-alignment. Another point that has heightened international<br />
concern is that, at a time when energy supplies are becoming<br />
scarce, the Soviet Union is better placed to exert influence<br />
or even control over Middle East oil. Such control could threaten<br />
the very survival of industrialised countries.<br />
As the new President of Iran has said, " the Soviets are at our<br />
doors if they succeed in reaching the Persian Gulf, they will<br />
control, not only Iran, but the whole of the Middle East and the<br />
Indian sub-continent".<br />
As to the nature of the response needed, it has been my view from<br />
the outset, that the only course open to independently-minded<br />
nations, is to make it plain to the Soviet Union that such behaviour<br />
will not be tolerated. I find this view is widely shared.<br />
104 members of the United Nation.&amp; General Assembly and<br />
subsequently, 25 Islamic foreign ministers, denounced the Soviet<br />
Union' s behaviour.<br />
Those who maintain that what we are witnessing is a return to the<br />
Cold War should bear the strength of opposition in mind. The<br />
essence of the Cold War was a tension between super powers. The<br />
essence of the present situation is that condemnation is coming<br />
independently and unorchestrated from a diversity of sources<br />
from the Third World, from the non-aligned, from the Islamic<br />
countries, as well as from the developed countries of the West.<br />
I maintained during my discussions, that future dangers are most<br />
likely to emerge in countries outside rather than inside Europe.<br />
For many years, Europe was the theatre of tension and conflict<br />
affecting the whole world. Since the War, there have been clear<br />
divisions in Europe between Communist and non-Conununist powers.<br />
These were tested during the blockade of Berlin. The West met<br />
that challenge with firmness and unity. As a result, alliances<br />
have been formed; commitments have been made, so that any future<br />
Soviet challenge in Europe would reinforce the Western alliance.<br />
However, in most of South East Asia, South West Asia and Africa,<br />
lines are not clearly-drawn. Whatever detente meant to Europeans,<br />
the Soviets have not regarded it as applying to their behaviour<br />
outside Europe. As a result, the Soviet has probed, pushed<br />
forward, and penetrated; destabilised governments and sought to<br />
increase its influence in large parts of the Third World the<br />
Middle East, Angola, Yemen, Ethiopia, Vietnam and Kampuchea.<br />
Thus, Afghanistan is the latest, though most serious, in a long<br />
history of Soviet intervention and expansion.<br />
Now, a great responsibility rests on independently-minded countries,<br />
wherever they are, to secure respect for the integrity and<br />
* independence of nations. It is not enough to leave this task to<br />
the United States alone. Recent events have heightened the need<br />
for the United States to demonstrate determination in world<br />
leadership. That leadership has been forthcoming. </p>
<p>The President, in his State of the Union address to the American<br />
Congress, spelt out specifically that an attack on the Persian Gulf<br />
region would be regarded as an attack on the vital interests of the<br />
United States, and would be met accordingly. This is the kind of<br />
leadership based on strength that only the United States can give;<br />
a leadership, which is essential if the independence of nations is<br />
to be secuired.<br />
It is not enough to be convinced that what the Soviet Union has done<br />
is wrong. We must act upon that conviction. Immediate steps have<br />
already been taken in many countries, including Australia, to show<br />
the Soviet Union that there is a cost to its behaviour. Over the<br />
longer term, we will be increasing our patrolling and surveillance<br />
in the Indian Ocean. We shall seek to enlarge our defence<br />
cooperation with friendly countries in South East Asia.<br />
We shall sustain programmes to raise our national defence preparedness<br />
to a new level. But we need to understand that a military response<br />
can never be more than part of the answer. Because this is so,<br />
we will be increasing our civil aid to countries in the South Pacific.<br />
Furthermore, nations must do what they can to strengthen the<br />
fabric of their own societies socially and economically.<br />
All this will require a constant and continuing effort. If we<br />
are to be successful, we must apply ourselves with a collective<br />
determination that will endure, a determination that recognises<br />
that our own freedom and the independence of nations cannot be<br />
taken for granted and cannot be secured without cost.<br />
Finally, I want to say something about the Olympic Games. The<br />
issue before us is not the boycotting of the Olympic Games. The<br />
issue is the occupation and invasion of Afghanistan. We would have<br />
preferred that an Australian team compete in the 1980 Olympics<br />
without any need to take into account considerations other than<br />
those of international sport. But we must view the world as it<br />
is, not as we would like it to be.<br />
It is the Soviet Union which has argued that the Olympic Games<br />
is an event of great social and political significance. It is the<br />
Soviet Union which has said that the awarding of the Olympics to<br />
Moscow is convincing testimony to the general recognition of the<br />
historic importance and correctness of its own-foreign policy.<br />
These views were expressed in June last year,, and distributed<br />
in printed form to Commuun. ist-Party activists.<br />
Now we have the invasion of Afghanistan, demonstrating that the<br />
host nation for this year's Olympics is abusing the rules of<br />
the international community. It is also abusing the Olympic<br />
charter in claiming credit and support for its foreign policy<br />
on the basis of the fact that it has been awarded the 1980<br />
Olympic Games.<br />
If, in the face of this, athletes were to go to Moscow, it would<br />
be seen by the government and the people of the Soviet Union as<br />
an endorsement of Soviet foreign policy. It will not be what the<br />
* visiting athletes say that is important; the importance will lie<br />
in the Soviet Union's interpretation of their presence. </p>
<p>-4-<br />
Soviet aggression must not be given that triumph. That is why<br />
the Australian government will remain strongly opposed to our<br />
athletes going to Moscow.<br />
I wonder with the benefit of hindsight how many Olympic officials<br />
and athletes would have gone to Berlin in 1936 had they known<br />
beforehand the propaganda use to which their presence would be put.<br />
As you know, Australia has taken a number of measures in scientific<br />
and cultural fields, in trade, in grains and in fisheries a<br />
number of which will have a significant cost for Australia.<br />
On the question of sanctions it is important to take actions which<br />
are supported by major trading nations. There is no point in<br />
Australia making decisions about commodities which can easily<br />
be obtained from other sources. We are in consultation on<br />
these matters especially with the United Kingdom and the United<br />
States. Of all the measures that are open to independent nations,<br />
a boycott or the movement of the Olympic Games would have the<br />
most effect in the Soviet Union. It cannot be hidden. It will<br />
be visible to the Soviet people and that will expose the emptiness<br />
of the Soviet Union's claim that the Olympic Games represents<br />
world wide approval of their foreign policy.<br />
our decisions in the face of international tension and difficulty<br />
have been measured and responsible. Of course, they will involve<br />
the nation and individuals in some cost. But this confirms the<br />
seriousness with which we view the Soviet invasion and occupation<br />
of Afghanistan, and the dangers that arise from it. It demonstrates<br />
the government's determination to do what it must in the interests<br />
of all Australians.<br />
By its invasion of Afghanistan, the Soviet Union has created<br />
considerable tensions. The responsibility now rests with the<br />
U. S. S. R. to indicate that it is prepared to contribute to world<br />
peace, to respect the integrity and independence of nations, and<br />
to forego subversion and outright invasion as instruments of<br />
foreign policy.<br />
The history of recent decades has not been encouraging. Until<br />
such time as the Soviet's commitment to these objectives is<br />
forthcoming, independent nations of the world have no option but<br />
to undertake a greater effort, and a greater response, at a<br />
greater cost to preserve the independence and freedom of their<br />
own people.<br />
For our own part, we will meet that challenge.<br />
