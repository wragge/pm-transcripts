    <content><![CDATA[<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, good morning.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Good morning, Jeremy.</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>Thank you for joining us.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>It's a pleasure.</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>First up, maybe you could give me an overview of your impression</p>
<p>   of the economic scene at the moment. The Wall Street...the Dow</p>
<p>   Jones has gone down another few</p>
<p>   per cent, I guess it's about 10 per cent in all. They're</p>
<p>   talking about a third-wave Asian crisis. We're looking at a</p>
<p>   slump on our own stockmarket. The dollar is down. The Yen is down.</p>
<p>   What do you feel?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>There's been some volatility on the financial markets for</p>
<p>   some time now. I wouldn't be overly pessimistic about it. What's</p>
<p>   happening in Asia is obviously of medium and long-term significance.</p>
<p>   But thus far Australia has held up pretty well and we've been</p>
<p>   able to protect ourselves largely because of the measures the Government</p>
<p>   took when it came to office two years ago. And we have, in fact,</p>
<p>   done even better in protecting ourselves than we thought because</p>
<p>   we've got the budget back into surplus a year ahead of schedule</p>
<p>   and that has resulted in lower interest rates and lower inflation</p>
<p>   and a more positive view around the world about the Australian economy.</p>
<p>I never talk about the day-to-day level of the dollar. I haven't</p>
<p>   in the past and I won't in the future. So far as the stockmarket</p>
<p>   is concerned, it does bounce around. The underlying position of</p>
<p>   stock exchanges around the world in recent years has been very strong</p>
<p>   indeed. The American economy is still remarkably strong. It is historically</p>
<p>   strong. It's got very low inflation. It's got virtually</p>
<p>   full employment. It's got very strong growth. The budget has</p>
<p>   come back pretty close to balance. So I'm pretty optimistic</p>
<p>   about the American economy. More needs to be done in Japan. The</p>
<p>   new Japanese government does need to tackle some of the more deep-seeded</p>
<p>   structural problems of the Japanese economy, the sort of problems</p>
<p>   that we have tackled and the Americans and others have tackled.</p>
<p>   And Asian revival, to some extent, does depend on what the Japanese</p>
<p>   do.</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>Yeah, well, it doesn't look like they're getting the</p>
<p>   thumbs-up in Japan. I guess it's only a situation that we can</p>
<p>   watch. It's not a bad range of things that have come out this</p>
<p>   week in advance of the tax package. That Productivity Commission</p>
<p>   report, when it sort of looks at the amount that we sort of tie</p>
<p>   business up with, I think it's about $23 billion worth of burden</p>
<p>   through indirect taxes.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>What that report does is reveal, yet again, just how many hidden</p>
<p>   taxes exist in the present tax system. The critics of a goods and</p>
<p>   services tax say that we will be adding a tax by its introduction.</p>
<p>   What they neglect to point out is that if you bring in a GST you</p>
<p>   have a capacity to get rid of a whole lot of hidden, embedded taxes,</p>
<p>   all of which add to the cost of manufacturing and exporting goods</p>
<p>   out of this country, all of which make Australia a less competitive</p>
<p>   country. And that Productivity Commission report has made the point,</p>
<p>   yet again, that the present system is holding Australia back on</p>
<p>   world markets. And that is one of the major reasons why we intend</p>
<p>   to change the present system because it is retarding Australia's</p>
<p>   economic growth, it is holding Australia back, it is denying Australia</p>
<p>   export markets it would otherwise win.</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>You're gearing up to sell this. It seems to me to be something</p>
<p>   that everybody should buy. When you look at these figures that are</p>
<p>   in front of me right now Â scrapping the wholesales sales tax</p>
<p>   and cutting the fuel excise by four cents a litre would save manufacturing</p>
<p>   $6 billion and the total economy $22 billion. Who's going to</p>
<p>   argue against that?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Jeremy, without going into specifics, there is no argument at all</p>
<p>   that the plan I will unveil tomorrow will reduce business cost in</p>
<p>   Australia. The plan to be unveiled tomorrow will create more jobs,</p>
<p>   it will make our exports more competitive, it will give Australian</p>
<p>   businesses a sharper, competitive edge. </p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>The budget surplus was a handy thing to have out at this time as</p>
<p>   well. Although, I think this morning there are some people who believe</p>
<p>   we should be slashing red ink around, not black ink.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, Jeremy, the great virtue of being in balance is that you</p>
<p>   are no longer paying dead money by way of interest on debt.</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>And you know what you do with that money you'd otherwise pay</p>
<p>   on debt. You use it to provide better services. I was able to make</p>
<p>   some more money available to the States for the public hospital</p>
<p>   system - $915 million over five years. Now, one of the reasons that</p>
<p>   we were able to do that was that we were in a stronger financial</p>
<p>   position. And this idea that somehow or other it's good to</p>
<p>   be paying off debt, it's good to be spending your money on</p>
<p>   servicing debt, is a very, very negative, backward-looking view.</p>
<p>   I want to free this country of debt so that instead of spending</p>
<p>   a whole lot of money on interest you can spend that money on lower</p>
<p>   taxes or better services.</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>Now, you no doubt this morning would have seen the report that</p>
<p>   the Medicare levy is about to be axed. Will you comment on that?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No. I won't comment on any of it. I mean, I have enjoyed reading</p>
<p>   the papers over the last week. I have enjoyed reading the papers</p>
<p>   immensely. And the full measure of what we have in store will be</p>
<p>   unveiled tomorrow. Let me say, I have enjoyed reading the papers.</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>Good Newspoll, a bad Morgan Poll for the Government. I don't</p>
<p>   know, I guess it depends on which poll you want to read.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, polls are there all the time. We have a plan. The Australian</p>
<p>   public will make a judgement on that plan when it's released.</p>
<p>   They will see a comparison. We have a plan for the future. The Labor</p>
<p>   Party says no to everything. One Nation says no to everything and</p>
<p>   blames everybody for everything. So you do have a fairly sharp comparison</p>
<p>   between a Coalition which has got a vision and a plan for the future</p>
<p>   and a Labor Party and One Nation who simply say no or blame other</p>
<p>   people.</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, it seems that the biggest problem, according to</p>
<p>   this Morgan Poll which is out in the Bulletin today, some</p>
<p>   85 per cent of voters are concerned that a GST will increase above</p>
<p>   the anticipated 10 per cent. Now, you've said that you're</p>
<p>   going to put a mechanism in place to prevent that. What sort of</p>
<p>   mechanism could that be?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, it will be a very effective mechanism. I can't announce</p>
<p>   it this morning. It will be in the plan when it's unveiled</p>
<p>   tomorrow. But it will be a very convincing mechanism.</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>Would you agree that that really is the key?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, look, the key is whether Australians believe that the plan</p>
<p>   will make Australia a better and a stronger country. It will and</p>
<p>   if the Australian public believes that and they regard the plan</p>
<p>   and the changes involving the plan as being fair, then I believe</p>
<p>   they will support it because Australians are fair-minded, altruistic</p>
<p>   people. They do care about the future of Australia. They do care</p>
<p>   about the security of the world in which their children will grow</p>
<p>   up. And if they believe the Government is going to produce a plan</p>
<p>   that will strengthen Australia and they're satisfied it's</p>
<p>   fair to them, they'll support it.</p>
<p>Now, the mechanism to embed, to entrench, to lock-in the rate to</p>
<p>   be announced tomorrow will be a very persuasive and convincing mechanism.</p>
<p>   I don't think there will be a more persuasive or convincing</p>
<p>   mechanism imaginable.</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>Now, I think you have said, or you have been reported to have said,</p>
<p>   that there will be something in there for everybody, everybody is</p>
<p>   going to be a winner.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, tax cheats won't win but overall it will benefit the</p>
<p>   entire community. There will be a collective benefit for the nation</p>
<p>   because the changes we have in mind are so fundamental that they</p>
<p>   will help the Australian economy grow at a faster rate. They will</p>
<p>   make Australian exporters and producers more competitive. There</p>
<p>   will be, as a result, more jobs generated and there will be protection</p>
<p>   for low-income, vulnerable people and there will certainly be personal</p>
<p>   tax cuts and we made that very plain. And on each of the five principles</p>
<p>   that I outlined a year ago for taxation reform, we will be seen</p>
<p>   to have very comprehensively delivered.</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>What do you do, though, if you go to the election with this package</p>
<p>   and you get returned and the Senate - and who knows what the Senate</p>
<p>   is going to look like after the next election - and the Senate stymie</p>
<p>   it? Don't they have to accept it as a mandate?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, ultimately these are matters for the Australian public. I</p>
<p>   will take one thing at a time. I am going to reveal the plan tomorrow.</p>
<p>   Whenever the election is held we will seek a mandate to implement</p>
<p>   not only our taxation reform plan but a number of other things.</p>
<p>   And I would have thought that if the Australian public were to return</p>
<p>   us at the next election then there would be a very strong, moral,</p>
<p>   political obligation on those in the Senate to let measures that</p>
<p>   we have plainly put in front of the Australian people through. And</p>
<p>   I am optimistic enough to believe in the end that will occur.</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>What are the other things you just mentioned?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh well, we won't just be talking about taxation. We will</p>
<p>   be reminding people that interest rates are at their lowest level</p>
<p>   for 30 years. We will remind people that we converted Mr Beazley's</p>
<p>   deficit of $10.5 billion into a surplus in only two years. We will</p>
<p>   talk about the highest level of business investment on record. We</p>
<p>   will remind people that Australia has the lowest inflation rate</p>
<p>   in the western world. We will remind the Australian public we fixed</p>
<p>   the native title mess; that I am the first Prime Minister to actually</p>
<p>   deliver on commitments made almost since Federation to build the</p>
<p>   Darwin-to-Alice Springs railway. And in the context of that we will</p>
<p>   be introducing special legislation to secure the land corridor through</p>
<p>   the Northern Territory for that railway and that was announced in</p>
<p>   Darwin a few days ago. So we will have a lot of things to talk about.</p>
<p>   We will also be talking about a new State for a new century - the</p>
<p>   decision I announced yesterday that the Northern Territory will</p>
<p>   join the Federation on the 1st of January in the year</p>
<p>   2001, the Centenary of the Federation of the Australian States.</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>How would you feel about the effects that that might have on the</p>
<p>   make-up of the Senate?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, we haven't decided yet. One proposal is that you could</p>
<p>   increase the two Senators from the Territory to three and then have</p>
<p>   an adjustment as the population grows. We are not wedded to that.</p>
<p>   You obviously can't have 12.</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>No, but you know that the profile of the Aboriginals and Territorian</p>
<p>   is pretty similar to the Queenslander and you know what that could</p>
<p>   mean in terms of political consequences?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>They are all Australians, Jeremy.</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>Yes, I know but some are more conservative than others.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, they are all Australians. And the Northern Territory has</p>
<p>   returned federal Labor members in the House of Representatives.</p>
<p>   And in a time that I have been in Federal Parliament, which is 24</p>
<p>   years, I think, on a rough count, you have had an equal number of</p>
<p>   representatives from both sides. I can remember Sam Calder representing</p>
<p>   it for the Country Party and then you had somebody called Reeves</p>
<p>   for the Labor Party and you had a Snowdon for the Labor Party. You</p>
<p>   have now got Nick Dondas for the CLP and prior to that you had Paul</p>
<p>   Everingham. So it has gone back and forth.</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>Yes. They are arguing about the flag, what do you think should</p>
<p>   be done there, and extra point?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I am not fussed about that. I don't think Shane Stone</p>
<p>   is either and that is something that we'll just give consideration</p>
<p>   to as time goes by.</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>Well, what does it matter? Would it worry you personally if the</p>
<p>   Euthanasia bill automatically, as I assume it would upon the Northern</p>
<p>   Territory gaining Statehood, the Euthanasia bill being taken up</p>
<p>   as law?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, that's not a Government issue. That was a free vote</p>
<p>   of the Federal Parliament. I personally am against euthanasia and</p>
<p>   I voted in favour of the bill that went through Federal Parliament.</p>
<p>   So that is my personal point of view as John Howard, private member.</p>
<p>   As Prime Minister, I won't be pushing any particular point</p>
<p>   of view on behalf of the Government in relation to that. And whether</p>
<p>   or not the Northern Territory will have full authority in that area</p>
<p>   is something that would be discussed as part of the negotiations</p>
<p>   on the Constitution. I would expect that the Northern Territory</p>
<p>   would, that if it is going to be a State then the criminal law of</p>
<p>   the new State of the Northern Territory ought to be as amble as</p>
<p>   the criminal law of the State of South Australia or Western Australia</p>
<p>   or New South Wales. The other point you have got to bear in mind</p>
<p>   about something like euthanasia is that the attitude of the Northern</p>
<p>   Territory Parliament itself may have changed. And that you couldn't</p>
<p>   assume that a measure of the type that was passed through the Northern</p>
<p>   Territory Parliament several years ago will automatically get passed</p>
<p>   through a Parliament of the State of the Northern Territory. But</p>
<p>   I accept the possibility that in a constitution of the State of</p>
<p>   the Northern Territory it would have power, without concern that</p>
<p>   it would be overturned by Canberra, to pass a law of that kind,</p>
<p>   just as the South Australian Parliament has got the power to do</p>
<p>   that at the present time because it would be a State just like South</p>
<p>   Australia. And you can't, on the one hand, say you believe</p>
<p>   in Statehood but say, hang on, we are going to reserve this and</p>
<p>   this and this and this because that's only truncated Statehood.</p>
<p>   You are either for or against Statehood. I am personally against</p>
<p>   euthanasia. I know that is not a view that the majority of the Australian</p>
<p>   people hold but it is my personal view and there is no point in</p>
<p>   beating about the bush on something like that where you have a personal</p>
<p>   view.</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>I have heard it said by more than one person and in more than one</p>
<p>   place that after the election it might be necessary for the Liberals</p>
<p>   to enter a coalition with the Nationals, obviously, if you want</p>
<p>   to govern. Would you comment on, number one, whether or not you</p>
<p>   might go into Coalition with One Nation or, as I have heard suggested,</p>
<p>   with the Labor Party?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, there is no way that I would contemplate a coalition with</p>
<p>   either. We will go into coalition with the National Party. We will</p>
<p>   not go into coalition with One Nation and we will not go into coalition</p>
<p>   with the Labor Party. </p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>But even if One Nation is stronger and more popular than the National</p>
<p>   Party whose views are clearly similar...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>We would still not go into coalition with them, I want to make</p>
<p>   that very plain. And the Australian public and conservative voting</p>
<p>   Australians should understand that the only party that the Liberal</p>
<p>   Party will go into coalition with after the next election is the</p>
<p>   National Party. I do not expect that the One Nation Party will hold</p>
<p>   the balance of power in the House of Representatives. I think that</p>
<p>   is an entirely hypothetical and unlikely proposition. But you asked</p>
<p>   me the question, I give you the answer - the Liberal Party will</p>
<p>   go into coalition with no party other than the National Party of</p>
<p>   Australia.</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>And those people who are absolutely hell-bent on destroying or</p>
<p>   crushing One Nation suggest that if they are a strength after the</p>
<p>   next election that it might be necessary for you to consider going</p>
<p>   into a coalition with the Labor Party.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I don't, for a moment, contemplate doing that. I mean,</p>
<p>   that is ridiculous. </p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>Well, I would have thought so. </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I think the whole idea of a coalition between the Liberal</p>
<p>   Party and the Labor Party - and bear in mind that on economic issues</p>
<p>   the Labor Party and One Nation are virtually the same. They are</p>
<p>   virtually the same. Both of them are against taxation reform. Both</p>
<p>   of them want to back to the policies that would penalise Australian</p>
<p>   exporters by encouraging retaliatory trade action by other countries.</p>
<p>   They really have very similar economic policies. </p>
<p>But let's take a reality check on all of this. The idea that</p>
<p>   the Labor Party and the Liberal Party would be in coalition because</p>
<p>   of a bit of support for One Nation within the community, and I don't</p>
<p>   know how strong that will be by the time of the election, is fanciful.</p>
<p>   And, after all, there wasn't even a national government in</p>
<p>   this country during World War II, although the then coalition parties,</p>
<p>   conservative parties of the time, the Liberal Party of the UAP,</p>
<p>   as it then was, and the Country Party wanted one, the Labor Party</p>
<p>   was against it. So if the Labor Party was against a unified national</p>
<p>   government during World War II, I find it rather fanciful that the</p>
<p>   idea should be getting around from anybody that the two parties</p>
<p>   would get together. Now, I think that is a gross overreaction to</p>
<p>   what has occurred and I certainly don't see it happening.</p>
<p>CORDEAUX: </p>
<p>Prime Minister, can you justify completely, to yourself and to</p>
<p>   everybody else, the spending $10 million of taxpayers money on promoting</p>
<p>   the GST package?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes, I can, on two grounds. Firstly, that we do have an obligation,</p>
<p>   given the size of the change, to explain it. It is, taxation is,</p>
<p>   no matter how simple you try and make it, it is inherently a bit</p>
<p>   complicated. You do need to explain it. People are entitled to know</p>
<p>   the changes as they affect them and some of the changes do require</p>
<p>   some detailed explanation. And there are ample precedents in the</p>
<p>   past for governments of both persuasions using public money to explain</p>
<p>   changes. </p>
<p>Now, people are making assumptions that, you know, this is part</p>
<p>   of some kind of continuum into an election campaign. I have not</p>
<p>   decided when the election will be and anybody who thinks that there's</p>
<p>   automatically going to be an election at a particular time following</p>
<p>   a particular series of events are jumping to conclusions. The Labor</p>
<p>   Party in five years spent $315 million - $315 million promoting</p>
<p>   government campaigns. I can remember advertisements about ÂWorking</p>
<p>   Nation' run by the actor, Bill Hunter.</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>Yes, 300,000 they paid him for that.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Enormous amount. Now, they were going on and all he was basically</p>
<p>   saying was that One Nation was terrific. They weren't really</p>
<p>   providing any information. Those ads weren't saying: this is</p>
<p>   the benefit you will get, this is how it will affect you. But the</p>
<p>   advertisements that we will be running will be providing factual</p>
<p>   material. They will not be saying the Liberal Party is terrific</p>
<p>   and the Labor Party is terrible. What they will be saying is that</p>
<p>   this is how the plan affects you, this is the consequence of it,</p>
<p>   this is how this particular section of the community or this particular</p>
<p>   person is affected or influenced by the taxation plan. I justify</p>
<p>   it absolutely.</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>We've only got a couple of minutes before the news. But looking</p>
<p>   at that surplus, that coming into surplus, what, 12 months earlier</p>
<p>   and a tad over a billion dollars. Is it possible that you cut too</p>
<p>   deep into those things that you wish to make savings on?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, it isn't. You've got to remember that the Federal</p>
<p>   Government's looking at revenue of in the order of, what, 130/40/50</p>
<p>   billion dollars and you can obviously have, because of an unexpected</p>
<p>   surge of revenue or a bit of an under-spend here and there, you</p>
<p>   can obviously end with a result which is about a billion dollars</p>
<p>   different from the projection you made 12 months earlier. There's</p>
<p>   nothing remarkable about that. If it had come in at $10 billion</p>
<p>   then your question would have been valid, but it didn't. And</p>
<p>   bear in mind that because of our slightly better position, it has</p>
<p>   already been possible to do one or two things. But we're not</p>
<p>   going to go on a spending spree. You could very easily next year</p>
<p>   have a slight reverse of the situation. You could project a surplus</p>
<p>   of Âx' and, through no miscalculation or bad management,</p>
<p>   it could just come in a little under it. So whilst it is a very</p>
<p>   pleasing result, it's an enormous tribute to the Government's</p>
<p>   economic management. It doesn't mean that we have cut too hard.</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>Well, with what is going on in the world around us I think it's</p>
<p>   a wonderful thing.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>It's given Australia enormous protection against that Asian</p>
<p>   storm.</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>Just quickly, I see that Premier Kennett has said, in The</p>
<p>   Age this morning, that he's urging voters not to punish</p>
<p>   the Federal Government and to give you a fair go. Is that a bit</p>
<p>   of a worry?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Jeff's a very strong supporter of our reform programme and</p>
<p>   I have no doubt that he will very strongly support the tax reform</p>
<p>   plan....</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>Well, he said that, he said that.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes, and he's a great believer in tax reform and I've</p>
<p>   briefed John Olsen about the details of the Commonwealth/State arrangements</p>
<p>   and I have no doubt that the South Australian Government will support</p>
<p>   the plan very strongly. In fact, the overall plan will be particularly</p>
<p>   beneficial, for reasons you'll understand tomorrow, for South</p>
<p>   Australia and South Australians.</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>We've got to go. Thank you so much for your time.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Pleasure.</p>
