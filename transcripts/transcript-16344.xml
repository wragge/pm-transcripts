    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Australian Government pays tribute to the life of pioneering Australian aviatrix Nancy-Bird Walton, who died today in Sydney.</p>
<p>Nancy-Bird is and will remain an Australian icon.</p>
<p>Nancy-Bird led the way for women pilots, becoming the first Australian female to gain a commercial pilot licence at the age of 19 in 1935, having learned to fly from Sir Charles Kingsford Smith at the age of just 17.</p>
<p>Ever since her first flight, she helped dispel the myth that flying is solely a man's domain.</p>
<p>Along with Kingsford Smith, Bert Hinkler and Reverend John Flynn, Nancy-Bird's name is synonymous with Australia's aviation history.</p>
<p>Nancy-Bird's achievements both on the ground and in the air have inspired generations of women to forge careers in the aviation industry and reach for the skies in all walks of life.</p>
