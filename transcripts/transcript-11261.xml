  Over recent months the government has considered the independent inquiry</p>
<p> by Air Vice Marshal Alan Heggen AO (retired) into the illegal boat</p>
<p> landings at Nambucca Heads and Cairns and the report of the Prime</p>
<p> Minister's Coastal Surveillance Task Force.</p>
<p>The government's acceptance of the recommendations of the Task Force</p>
<p> on 27 June to strengthen Australia's capacity to deter and detect</p>
<p> illegal immigration has generated a great deal of discussion.</p>
<p>In the interest or promoting a greater understanding of the issues</p>
<p> related to illegal immigration and of the measures I announced on</p>
<p> 27 June, I have decided to release the Task Force's report and the</p>
<p> findings and recommendations of the Heggen inquiry. The Heggen report</p>
<p> has been withheld because it contains a considerable amount of operational</p>
<p> detail which if released would compromise future operations against</p>
<p> people smuggling syndicates. Similarly, the Task Force's report has</p>
<p> been amended to protect operational and intelligence matters.</p>
<p>The release of these reports is further evidence that the government</p>
<p> is serious about the issue of illegal immigration and in gaining the</p>
<p> understanding and support of all Australians in the fight against</p>
<p> illegal immigration.</p>
