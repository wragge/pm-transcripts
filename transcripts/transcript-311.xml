Spec made by the Rt. Hon. iR. G. Menzies<br />
Prime ' IV. inister of Australia, prior to<br />
Unveiling the "' irjG orgeHolland Plaque<br />
H. . L. National Headquarters, Canberra 9/ 5/ 61.<br />
" Mr. President, the ieap-ue has of course done a<br />
remarkable piece of work in its history in Australia. It<br />
has succeeded in doing somethiing qiite Darad ical; it has<br />
never become a p~ olitical party, it alway~~ d g * reat influence<br />
with rolit1c t t,. ink has b * en an<br />
excellent thing.<br />
You have b-en able to meet rolitdcal people of all<br />
shades of opinlion fair terms, not as irolitical p. rsoris<br />
but as neople who have and feel gre: at responsibility for<br />
the welfare of Ex-servicemen. it's, been a wondierful record,<br />
an: d I think
that the iteague has ( ic-. e it thant has had
so few Federal ireside-t,-r-remar. rihly few
or srvie, become q-uite Ouiliax friends with the<br />
Prime Ministers and inisters of the day. D have been singularly<br />
fortunate because by :*, ome r. lracLe I was 1Prime Minister<br />
of the country all the time that .' ir George Holland was<br />
Federal President of tne 1jeague ,-each of them a miracle in<br />
its own fashiona but a very ~ py thitru, for mie, and whenever<br />
he ) as come to Canberra he ycaine to see me. 1 must say that<br />
he4 n-, 6ever q., ite succeeded in coming just to say " I1 just<br />
wanted to have the nleasu-re of looking at you, old man"-oe<br />
has usually a few thOliW, YiOU Know, in ' Ade r'ocket, and<br />
when he has left me . I have nuad a fe'. iesis Lhin,. s: ieft in my<br />
hip poc.-et Aut we ; ot on very weLL iride'-d. I have always<br />
had great respect and a-ffection for himi and of course in<br />
addition to that, in the last ten years we have had an<br />
Ex-servicemen's Commttee of Cabinet th. at has had direct<br />
discussions with the members of' tne i ' ederal E~ xecutive and<br />
with the officers of the Ljeague) the f ' ederal ecretary in<br />
part icular, This I. think has made for great mutual understanding.<br />
it is not to be supposed that the Leag : ue will<br />
cver entirely agree with the cGovernment,! 6'_ t might as well<br />
go out o siness it' it entirely aurees with the Goverruiinentb,<br />
It is no~ spposed that the Governrment will always entirely<br />
agree with' the League,, Tere ight be some letuitimate complaint<br />
by the reasury, but we have got along, We have always<br />
met each other and discussed t* e-1Aingsthi b~ n each side<br />
we have done our br'st, arid the whole matter has been conducted<br />
on a high level, and I believe in that. doni't t~ nkthat~<br />
l gn ptt -the pzti~ fs~ bi<br />
-arourn-A the~ zte ought to be able to meet each other<br />
as responsible people and do thle best that we can about what<br />
is after all not just an individual problern, but a W-tional one.<br />
Now Sir George Holland has I think, been a perfect example<br />
of how these things should be conducted. I want to teLl you that<br />
so far as my 1irinisters and I are concerned we thought so highly<br />
of him that when he came to retire from office we had him along,<br />
with his successor Mr. Ulee, and gave him a dinnerM Tt takes an<br />
awful lot to get roliticians to pay for a dinner out of our<br />
own pockets. I would not want that to go any further but we did,&amp;<br />
.3 e even enriched him with a piece of silver to commemplorate<br />
whnt for all of us has been the happiest possible association, </p>
<p>-2-<br />
and all I can say George is that I hope that now you are<br />
out of office, they will allow you to come to Canberra<br />
occasionally. It would be equally pleasant for me and<br />
probably less expensive if you are not Iresident of the<br />
League , d tach time you are here I hope you will be able<br />
to look at this lanue which I hope to unveil in a iiinute,<br />
with -leasure and with leritimate pride, because this is<br />
a proud day for you ft ought to be, and we all would lie<br />
to share in your pride with you.<br />
Now I h, e ben told to a-T s d thi T will<br />
