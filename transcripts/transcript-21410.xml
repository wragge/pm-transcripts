    <content><![CDATA[<p>The splintering of the Labor Party over the US Free Trade Agreement - most recently evidenced by Senator Lundy's comments about cultural issues - is a direct consequence of the failure of the Opposition Leader Mr Latham to show leadership on this issue, which is so important to Australia's economic future.</p>
<p>If Mr Latham had, from the beginning, shown leadership and committed his party to support the Agreement there would not have been the divisions which are now emerging throughout the Labor Party.</p>
<p>Instead he chose to play politics with something carrying long term benefits for Australia.</p>
<p>Labor has had five months to assess the Free Trade Agreement.  The Senate Inquiry is a smokescreen for its political opportunism and dithering.</p>
<p>Senator Lundy's criticisms are ill-informed.  Local content is adequately protected by the Agreement and appropriate reservations covering new media have been included.</p>
<p>The Opposition Leader deserves all of the division he is now experiencing.  He chose expediency over principle from the very beginning.</p>
<p>If, in the end, Labor does support the Agreement it will be out of concern for the Party's political interests and not out of concern for the national interest.</p>
<p>This is a once in a generation opportunity. It must not be squandered.  There should never have been any doubt about Labor's position.  Sensible Labor people know that.  It's a great pity that the party's leader does not.   </p>
