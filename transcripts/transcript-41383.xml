    <content><![CDATA[<p>Australia is the most successful multicultural society in the world. Right at the heart of our success as a free society is freedom of religion. It is a fundamental national value, recognised in the Constitution.</p>
<p>Last month, the Government announced an expert panel to examine whether Australian law adequately protects religious freedom, to be chaired by the Hon Philip Ruddock.Â </p>
<p>Today, I am pleased to share the terms of reference for the Expert Panel to Examine Religious Freedom in Australia. In undertaking its Review the Panel will:</p>
<ul><li>consider the intersections between the enjoyment of the freedom of religion and other human rights;</li>
<li>have regard to any previous or ongoing reviews or inquiries that it considers relevant; and</li>
<li>consult as widely as it considers necessary.</li>
</ul><p>In consultation with Mr Ruddock, University of Queensland constitutional law Professor Nicholas Aroney has also been appointed to the Expert Panel.</p>
<p>He will join Emeritus Professor Rosalind Croucher AM, the Hon Dr Annabelle Bennett AO SC and Fr Frank Brennan SJ AO.</p>
<p>The Expert Panel will hold its first formal meeting in early 2018 to discuss the consultation process. I have asked the Expert Panel to report its findings by 31 March 2018.</p>
<p>Initial submissions from the public addressing the matters set out in the terms of reference are welcome. To provide a submission or view the full terms of reference, visit the Religious Freedom Review page.</p>
