PRIME MINISTER TUESDAY 20* NOVEMBER 1979<br />
From the Press Office SUMMARY OF ABC's NEWSVOICE<br />
Rupert Murdoch announced today he was making a takeover offer<br />
worth about.$ 126 million for the Melbourne based media group,<br />
The Herald and Weekly Times. Mr. Murdoch, the chief executive<br />
of the News Limited Group, said today he wanted to get control<br />
of just over 50 per cent of the group. Among its interests the<br />
Herald and Weekly Times publishes and Herald and Sun in Melbourne,<br />
owns two radio stations, and controls a Melbourne television<br />
station. News Limited publishes the Australian, the Mirror and<br />
the Daily Telegraph in Sydney, the News in AdeTlaide and anumber<br />
of Sunday, country and suburban newspapers. Don Lang reports<br />
from Melbourne. Mr. Murdoch walked unannounced into the Herald<br />
office this morning and demanded to see the Chairman. He told<br />
Mr. MacPherson of the takeover and at 10 am the Stock Exchange<br />
was informed. Mr. Murdoch then went to the Age Building to inform<br />
its Managing Director, Mr. McDonald. Mr. Murdoch said the takeover<br />
had been his subconscious ambition for some time but it had only<br />
become a possibility in the last few weeks. At the bid of $ 4 a<br />
share Mr. Murdoch valued the Herald at about-twice of what would<br />
become the parent company, New Limited. He claims to have raised<br />
the $ 126 million to realise his ambition to control marginally<br />
more than half the Herald's shares. The deal is subject to<br />
approval from the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal and under<br />
Tribunal regulations, the Herald would have to sell off its<br />
interest in television stations in Brisbane, Adelaide and Hobart.<br />
This would leave Mr. Murdoch with control of Channel 10 in Sydney<br />
and 7 in Melbourne. Mr. MacPherson said a board meeting would be<br />
held as soon as possible andadvise the shareholders not to sell.<br />
Despite that Herald shares rose sharply in Sydney and Melbourne<br />
on large turnovers today. In Melbourne it rose $ 1.01 to close<br />
at $ 3.76 and it was up $ 10.2 in Sydney to $ 3.78. Mr. Murdoch<br />
says he is confident he will be able to get control of the company<br />
and if he does he will control the largest selling newspapers in<br />
Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide and Perth, two capital city television<br />
stations, radio stations in Victoria,-chains of country and<br />
suburban newspapers, a number of printing companies, magazines<br />
and journals, as well as his interests in American and English<br />
newspapers. Federal opposition has called for the immediate freeze of transfers<br />
for television and radio licences as a means of at least<br />
temporarily blocking Mr. Murdoch's acquisition of channel 7 in<br />
Melbourne and several radio stations. The Opposition spokesman on<br />
the Media, Senator Ryan said such action should be taken until a<br />
Royal Commission of Enquiry or some other high level enquiry<br />
could be set up to look into media control in print, radio and<br />
television. Senator Ryan interviewed. There are very fundamental<br />
dangers in a democratic system where you have a situation with<br />
more than, 50 per cent of all media outlets being owned by one person.<br />
I think if we really believe in things like freedom of speech and<br />
the importance of diversity of opinion and views in our society<br />
then we must be worried about such a situation. </p>
<p>The Federal Opposition today tried to censure the Government in<br />
Federal Parliament for abusing proper standards of ministerial<br />
responsibility over the Greek Conspiracy Case and the controversy<br />
surrounding the transfer-of the Federal Narcotics Bureau to the<br />
Federal Police. Moving the censure motion, Mr. Hayden said the<br />
doctrine of ministerial responsibility was dieing the death of<br />
a hundred cuts. Replying, Mr. Viner said the. Opposition was<br />
trying to rehash matters already debated and the Government had<br />
no hesitation in rejecting the motion. Graham Dobell reports<br />
from Canberra. Mr. Hayden said the Government was ignoring grave<br />
defects of administration in several ministries. He called for<br />
the resignation or dismissal of four ministers. Mr. Fife because<br />
of his handling of the Narcotics Bureau and because of their<br />
involvement in the Greek Conspiracy Case,-Senator Guilfoyle,<br />
Senator Durack and Mr. McLeay. Mr. Hayden said the scandalous<br />
behaviour of the Government was equal to the worst excesses of<br />
early colonial parliaments. He said the Government had broken<br />
down in its administration of law and order. The Narcotics Bureau<br />
had been scrapped. The Commonwealth Police had been discredited<br />
because of the Greek Conspiracy Case and the Hope Report had<br />
exposed Asio as totally defective. Mr. Hayden said the Government<br />
had defiled the concept of ministerial r * esponsibility. Replying<br />
Mr. Viner said that Parliament had already rejected censure motions<br />
against Mr. Fife and Senator Guilfoyle. He said Mr. Hayden had.<br />
putforward a laboured and turgid argument that lacked sincerity of<br />
approach. It was a desperate attempt by the Opposition Leader to<br />
lift his. profile. Mr. Hayden he said was sensitive about criticism<br />
within the Labor Party of his leadership. Mr. Viner said the<br />
Social Security Department and the Commonwealth Police had to<br />
investigate allegations of fraud. He said there was no reason<br />
whatsoever to accept the censure motion. The motion was defeated<br />
in a division on party lines 72 votes to 36.<br />
In Teheran Moslem students have released another ten hostages from<br />
the United States Embassy. The hostages, four white women and<br />
six black irien left the Embassy for Teheran airport where a Swiss<br />
airliner was waiting to take them to West Germany. There they will<br />
join three other hostages released yesterday. 49' hostages remain<br />
in the Embassy. Meanwhile Mr. Waldheim has spoken out strongly<br />
against any suggestion that the remaining hostages would be tried<br />
as spies.<br />
In Melbourne more than 5,000 Telecom employees today accepted wage<br />
rises of be-tween $ 7.50 and $ 20 a week. . Ken Hickey reports from<br />
Melbourne. Today's meeting paves the way for similar meetings of<br />
members of the Australian Telecommunications Employees Association<br />
in all other states tomorrow.<br />
Queensland's Opposition Leader, Mr. Casey said today he would try<br />
again tomorrow to tell Parliament about the connection of senior<br />
Government members with the drug scene in Queensland. This followed<br />
the gagging of a statement today in reply to a statement by the<br />
Minister for Police, Mr. Camm. Mr. Casey said he had evidence from<br />
a Narcotics Bureau agent that three members of the coalition<br />
Government including a senior member, were involved. As well Mr.<br />
Casey said police were involved in the State's drug scene which he<br />
estimated at being worth-$ 60 million a year. David Coombs spoke<br />
to Mr. Casey this afternoon. </p>

The mineral exploration company Beach Petroleum has found natural<br />
gas in Victoria's western district, just north of the seaside<br />
resort of Port Campbell. The gas flow was estimated at 7 million<br />
cubic feet a day. Duncan Ness asked the company's chief executive,<br />
how significant was the find. He replied that it was significant<br />
to the western district of Victoria. 000---</p>
