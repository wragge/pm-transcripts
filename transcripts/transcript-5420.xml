PRIME IMINISTER i<br />
FOR MEDIA. TUESDAY, 19 AUGUST, 1980 ji-<br />
SIR SERETSE KHAMA<br />
Mr. Speaker, it is with deep regret that I inform the House<br />
of the death on 13 July 1980, of the President of Botswana,<br />
Sir Seretse Khama, and I-move: " That this House records its<br />
sincere regret at the death of Sir Seretse Khama, President<br />
of Botswana, and expresses its deepest sympathy to his family<br />
and to the people of Botswana."<br />
Mr. Speaker, the House will wish to be advised formally that<br />
the Government extended its deep sympathy to the Government<br />
and people of Botswana, and that the Minister for Health<br />
and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister represented Australia<br />
at Sir Seretse Khama's memorial service.<br />
Sir Seretse Khama was a great statesman. It is not often that<br />
the leader of a relatively small country has a larg ' e influence<br />
in the world. Sir Seretse did. Ha was very widely respected,<br />
initially for tChe way he led his country to independence in<br />
1966, then for the way he guided his country with wisdom and<br />
judgement through all difficulties, and not least for his-actions<br />
and counsels over such large international matters as<br />
South Africa and Rhodesia.<br />
Sir Seretse's was always a voice for commonsense and moderation.<br />
Africa and Commonwealth Councils, as well as his own country,<br />
were advantaged by his leadership.<br />
He was a fine and good man, and a staunch friend, whose death<br />
was a great loss not only to Botswana but also to Africa,<br />
the Commonwealth and indeed the international community.<br />
