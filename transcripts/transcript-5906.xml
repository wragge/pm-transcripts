ljAUSTRLA<br />
FOR MEDIA MONDAY, 13 SEPTEMBER 1982<br />
ADDRESS TO 8TH NATIONAL AUSTRALIAN<br />
RETAILERS CONVENTION<br />
The retail industry makes a very significant contribution to<br />
the Australian economy, to a significant part of our Gross National<br />
Product, to a significant part of Australia's employment, but<br />
while there are some large firms in the industry there is also<br />
a large part of the industry that is composed of small retailers<br />
employing relatively few people.<br />
The industry in recent years has gone through some difficult and<br />
competitive times although I am told that everyone is friendly<br />
this morning once the convention is over normal competition<br />
takes over again. There has been a good deal of rationalisation<br />
within the industry and it is in an industry also that has been<br />
affected as many others are by the introduction of new technology.<br />
Changing and changing with the times is part of a dynamic society<br />
and if the retailing industry or a retailing firm or the nation,<br />
ever becomes complacent and decides we can stand still, that they<br />
have done well enough, then that is the moment that that firm<br />
or the nation will start to move backwards. There isa real<br />
need always to look to the future to the challenges of the<br />
future, you can grasp it, exploit and develop it and to capitalise<br />
on it.<br />
obviously your industry together other industries in Australia<br />
are affected by the current economic circumstances and they are<br />
not the best that we could wish for. The world recession over<br />
the last 8 or 9 months has started to hit Australia hard, it has<br />
gone on longer than anyone envisaged or believed, but one of the<br />
remarkable things about it is that up to the end of 1981 Australia<br />
had been able to move against the tide so far as the world recession<br />
was concerned. This economy had been growing strongly, sales<br />
and many parts of your industry had been growing strongly and<br />
employment had grown strongly in the three years to December 1981.<br />
Then, continuing recession and dramatically significant falls in<br />
the price of our major export commodities started to have an<br />
impact on what we were doing in Australia.<br />
The seven major economiies. h. ave recorded falls in industrial<br />
uroduction over the last twelve months and<br />
trade has recorded falls over the last year or so for the first<br />
time in more than 20 years. In the circumstances, it is obvious<br />
that there are going to be difficulties for many traders and for<br />
industries. / 2 </p>
<p>RETAILERS CONVENTION 398<br />
The sharpest and clearest reminder of the difficulties of the<br />
world trading situation at the present time is in my own<br />
electorate because Alcoa were building one of -the bigget, best<br />
most modern aluminium smelters and not one tonne of that aluminium<br />
was going to supply the Australian market, it was all going to<br />
markets overseas. Then having spent some hundrE~ ds of millions<br />
of dollarsAlcoa suddenly realised they didn't have a market<br />
for a single tonne of that aluminium. Then they found that they<br />
couldn't get any partners to help them to continue to build up<br />
the smelter, and since they didn't have a marketthat is not<br />
altogether surprising. Then they found they didn't have enough<br />
money to continue the project, so instead of building a<br />
smelter, it is now a ghost works with the major structures reaching<br />
up into the sky, with hundreds of thousands of tonnes of concrete<br />
poured but by Christmas there will be no work being done on it at all.<br />
It will not be reactivated until there is confidence that<br />
world demand and markets are going to be available for what is<br />
a very expensive operation. Nobody can blame Alcoa for that,<br />
they are a victim of what has happened overseas in this instance,<br />
and it is a very sharp and clear reminder of the way it is going<br />
to affect industry and people in Australia. If that is one<br />
example, there must be many in different industries. The prices<br />
of mining and rural commodities, the difficulties of our<br />
manufacturers selling overseas are compounded in the present<br />
circumstances. We as the 14th or 15th most significant trading<br />
nation, with about 30% of our national income dependent upon<br />
trade are obviously going to be affected by these things.<br />
In addition to that our investment overall throughout this<br />
year is likely to stay at a high level by the end of the financial<br />
year it will obviously running then at a lesser rate than it is<br />
now as projects come to be completed and in the current inves-tment<br />
climate, new projects are not begun or are deferred.<br />
You cannot blame for one moment all of our problems on what<br />
has happened in the United States, the United Kingdom, France,<br />
Germany or somewhere else, because over the last 18 months we<br />
did a good deal of damage to ourselves which certainly should<br />
not have occurred. Our wage settlements were running at 15% to<br />
but-overseas they were running at 5% or 6% and it is not much<br />
consolation to say that that was happening and they were getting<br />
more sensible wage settlements overseas under the stimulus of much<br />
higher levels of unemployment, under the stimulus of a trading<br />
climate that was much slacker than that which occurred in<br />
Australia. Wage settlements and the movements<br />
towards shorters hours through last year compounded the difficulties<br />
we find in the world trade scene.<br />
It has obviously made us less competitive but now these problems<br />
are starting to be better understood. There are three tribunals<br />
that have come out with relatively sensible wage decisions.<br />
The Remuneration Tribunal for politicians and the public service<br />
came out with a decision of 7% when they said that in justice,<br />
they should have come out with one of about 1i% or 14%. I have no<br />
doubt that in justice they would have said they should have come out<br />
with a nil return Or a minus 7% or 14%, but be that as it may, / 3<br />
-2-13.9.82 </p>
<p>RETAILERS CONVENT ION 1.. 8<br />
a judgement that was significantly below the level of inflation<br />
is encouraging. The Academic Salaries Tribunal made the same<br />
kind of judgement, but more significant than that, the Western<br />
Australian Public Service Tribunal came out with a 7% return<br />
at the end of last week when the unions had been arguing for<br />
17% or 18%. That might be the most significant of the three<br />
because if that is carried through all the public services<br />
and the general wage tribunals throughout the country, then that<br />
will start to give us an opportunity to get on top of the.<br />
excessive wage decisions of earlier times. That kind of decision<br />
alone is not going to be enough, it is going to need a cor'stancy<br />
of effort and a real level of wage moderation over time.<br />
In this total background we obviously had a somewhat difficult<br />
Budget to frame. It would have been possible to take a purist<br />
economic hair shirt approach, and we could have come out with<br />
an overall Budget surplus of about $ 1500 billion, and I have<br />
not the slightest doubt that that would have been better for<br />
inflation and better for interest rates than the Budget we actually<br />
introduced. If we had had an overall surplus of say, $ 1500 billion,<br />
that also would have been extraordinarily depressive upon the<br />
Australian economy at a time when the level of private investment<br />
is falling which was unlike the circumstances of the previous<br />
3 or 4 years, where private investment had been expanding one<br />
year upon the other and a Budget of that kind would have been<br />
difficult and would not have done anything to ameliorate any of<br />
the difficulties which industries and individuals are facing<br />
as a result of world circumstances.<br />
In the event, we opted for a Budget that was a compromise. We<br />
believe it is responsible economically, and it is also one that<br />
is designed in a significant way to assist industry and to assist<br />
individuals who might be worst hit and hurt by current circumstances.<br />
The tax cuts obviously help individuals and businesses. The<br />
depreciation provisions that were announced before the Budget<br />
should be of significant help to industry, putting our industry<br />
in the same ccrpetitive basis as industries in other countries<br />
where the depreciation provisions have been more generous than<br />
in Australia. The assistance to families, the assistance through<br />
the housing rebate for housing, again, help those individuals,<br />
families and businesses. The increased retention allowance<br />
is obviously ar1. assistance for small companies. There are<br />
two innovations in this Budget tax relief on dividend income<br />
for small investors and changed rules for employee share<br />
participation schemes and these two things can be seen together,<br />
one to encourage investment by employees in their own firm and<br />
two, to encourage investment by small investors in Australian<br />
companies generally. They are measures that can be built upon<br />
and I believe that they are. significant and important.<br />
While John Howard in a very real way called this a family Budget,<br />
I hope it would be better regarded as a Budget which enables<br />
Australians to work together. If you take the ' example of a family<br />
on $ 300 a week, with a dependent spouse and two kids, as a<br />
result of the Budget they are $ 17 or $ 18 a Q. eek better off.<br />
If they were going to be as much better off through their employers,<br />
with a $ 25 or $ 26 a week increase in wages, that could be enough<br />
of an increase in some cases to send the employef broke, then there<br />
13.9.82 </p>
<p>RETAILERS CONVENTION 13.9.82<br />
would be no wages and no job. So it does establish a basis on<br />
which it is not only reasonable to ask for but to expect, and<br />
to fight for in a most vigorous way, wage restraint across<br />
the whole spectrum in Australia at the present time.<br />
Many of the advantages of the Budget have been overshadowed<br />
by other debates which have occurred as a result of a certain<br />
Royal Commission, and I thought perhaps I should say one or<br />
two things about that.<br />
It needs to be remembered that we established this Royal Commission<br />
into the Painters and Dockers-. Union because we had heard<br />
of many things that seemed to be wrong with that Union. I<br />
believe all Australians will be disturbed at the extent of the<br />
criminality that has been revealed of the links between that union<br />
and white collar crime. Since these things have been revealed<br />
I am glad that the Royal Commission report was established,<br />
I am grateful for the work that Mr Costigan has done and what<br />
he has shown is that there is a massive task ahead of Governments,<br />
both State and Federal, to put what was wrong, right. That is<br />
the important thing.<br />
We need to understand that the Painters and Dockers Union<br />
in the Royal Commissioner's terms is not really a union for<br />
industrial purposes, it is a union for criminal purposes, if<br />
you like, a secret society. In Victoria he said that every<br />
member of the union, every office bearer has a criminal record.<br />
If our American friends won't take offence, it seems to me<br />
that some of the things that that union has done has more than<br />
given. credit to Chicago in the 1920' s and maybe the movie<br />
reputation of Chicago because I don't know if that is the reality<br />
or not. With a somewhat graphic-phrase which an office bearer<br />
of the Union used to another Royal Commission-' we catch and<br />
we kill our own' now that is not fancy, it might be the kind<br />
of phrase that people thought could never be used in Australia<br />
but all it is doing in relation to this union is describing<br />
quite accurately, what the Union has in fact done. I am glad<br />
the Labor Party is moving to disaffiliate the Union from its<br />
own ranks. That ought to have happened a long time ago and I<br />
wish my colleague good fortune in that particular effort.<br />
When we find out the sorts of things that the Union was doing,<br />
the kind of services they were providing, not only in dirty crime<br />
around the docks, when you find that they are also providing<br />
services for those who wanted to undertake or promote white<br />
collar crime, signatures for people who could disappear and<br />
be given changed identities through the operations of the Union,<br />
it is not surprising that there came to be a link between the<br />
Union and some of the worst and~ the tax evasion schemes.<br />
It was the Union who supplied the names and signatures for a fee<br />
and often quite a modest fee, for other people who would have<br />
been making large sums indeed. So you come again, to the description<br />
of bottom of theharbour tax evasion schemes.<br />
It doesn't hurt also to say that John Howardhas legislated<br />
and has done more against tax evasion than any other Treasurer,<br />
maybe than all the' other Treasurers of the Commonwealth put together.<br />
The various things* that have occurred in the last two years<br />
make it necessary for the health of the mciety that we live in<br />
that that campaign be pursued vigorously and relentlessly. We<br />
-4-</p>
<p>RETAILERS CONVENTION 13.9.82<br />
are establishing a task force, a special prosecutor will<br />
be established, mostly in relation to promoters of bottom<br />
of the harbour schemes. The Attorney -General was; having<br />
discussions with Mr Costigan on Friday in relation to other<br />
aspects that had been revealed in the report and the best<br />
way to pursue prosecutions in the speediest possible way.<br />
We will be establishing a national Crimes Commission<br />
and I hope the states will join with us in that, and it will<br />
have available to it a prosecuting arm. The establishment<br />
of a special prosecutor under legislation that has now gone<br />
through the House of Representatives and I hope through th ' e<br />
S~ enate tomorrow, will go a long way to establishing that<br />
kind of prosecuting arm to the present royal commission.<br />
This brinqs me to the other aspect of what we are about,<br />
legislation in a wide way has been branded as retrospective.<br />
Nobody likes that, the Government doesn't like it and I am<br />
sure that many people in the community don't like it. For<br />
those that don't understand the nature-of the legislation<br />
because it is quite specifice, let me emphasise that it<br />
is tax legislation, it is designed to collect tax that should<br />
have been paid and had not been paid, it is not in that sense<br />
creating a new tax liability it will be collecting a tax that<br />
was evaded and in that sense retrospective is the wrong word<br />
to apply to it but I do not deny for one minute that there is<br />
a retrospective element to the legislation.<br />
It is sometimes said that people can go into the schemes and<br />
not really know that they were doinx something that was wrong<br />
and the legislation is related to the bottom of the<br />
harbour tchemes, not to the generality of what might have happened<br />
over the last 10 years. I find it very hard to believe that if<br />
somebody had a company worth $ 100 with $ 10 tax being owed to the<br />
Commonwealth, then another person comes along who is the promoter,<br />
and says: " I have a way in which you can convert your $ 10 tax to<br />
the Commonwealth into a capital gain for yourself, the only<br />
thing you have to do is to pay me a fee of $ 1 or $ 2 for the<br />
privilege of doing this for you. All you have to do is to<br />
sign a couple of papers and you are obviously going to be<br />
better of Most people would know there is something a bit<br />
odd with that kind of arrangement, most people would think there<br />
is something slightly wrong, it is not quite as easy as that<br />
to evade normal liabilities to your own people in the community<br />
or to the tax commissioner and most people would have felt it<br />
reasonable to ask one or two questions about what was involved.<br />
If there is a principle of retrospectivity, that my Party and<br />
other people don't like as there is, there are other principles<br />
-that are very important to Government and very important to the<br />
Liberal Party. Sometimes Governments are faced with competing<br />
principles and you cannot pursue either one to the full as you<br />
might like. one of the principles upon which my Party was<br />
founded by Sir Robert Menzies some decades ago, was a-principle<br />
of acting fairly for all Australians, no matter where they are<br />
or where they come from, what sort of job they are in, or what sort<br />
of income they have. We are indeed the only Party that does<br />
act fairly for all'Australians. My colleagues in partnership,<br />
the National Party, represent more specifically rural interests<br />
as you all know and the Labor Party represents the union movement </p>
<p>RETAILERS CONVENTION 13.9.82<br />
rather than the generality of the Australian public. The<br />
Liberal Party is the only Party that can and does act fairly<br />
for all Australians.<br />
You are all aware that in recent times there have been a view<br />
that the tax system was unfair, that some wealthy people were<br />
becoming much wealthier because they don't pay any taxes due<br />
and they weren't really robbing the Commissioner, so much<br />
as robbing other taxpayers in that particular activity.<br />
Average PAYE taxpayers, average people in small businesses<br />
or whatever were beginning to have the view that the whole<br />
system was unfair because of the activities of the few<br />
that were ripping off the system. If the Liberal Party has to<br />
make a choice between acting fairly to all taxpayers or<br />
acting fairly to all Australians and adopting some element<br />
of retrospectivity, in this instance, the principle of acting<br />
fairly in the interests of all Australians must be given<br />
predominance. If the Liberal Party ever ceases to have that<br />
capacity, if it ever ceases to be regarded as a Party who does<br />
act fairly for all Australians, the rationale for the existence*<br />
of the Party and the life of the Government ceases to be. I would<br />
not want to lead, or be part of any Party which failed to stand<br />
by that principle.<br />
That is why the Government has taken the view that it has.<br />
I would-much prefer not having to be forced into making these<br />
kind of choices, but I suppose retailers sometimes have to<br />
make unfortunate choices which they don't always like or when<br />
they have a product that they cannot sell they have<br />
to do something about it. We have the product of the tax<br />
evasion industry which we do not like and we have to do something<br />
about it. I am not sure what that has to do with the retailing<br />
industry but it was something that I wanted to say.<br />
I am sure you are going to have productive discussions and. I<br />
am sure that you are going to learn a great deal from each<br />
other, know better how to compete with each other and that<br />
will result in a much better deal for customers than would otherwi<br />
be the case without this convention. I wish you in your<br />
deliberations good fortune, a happy time, and for visitors from<br />
overseas I hope you are not just going to be kept in this room,<br />
I hope you will have time to see something of Australia also. </p>
