    <content><![CDATA[<p>It is a pleasure to be here in Houston at the Asia Society Texas Centre.</p>
<p>Like its sister society in Australia, the Asia Society Texas is dedicated to promoting understanding between nations.</p>
<p>Few nations understand each other so deeply or so well as the United States and Australia.</p>
<p>We are more than allies.Â  Weâre family.</p>
<p>There are no countries with a stronger community of interest and values.</p>
<p>Our alliance exists to promote the universal decencies of humanity, not to threaten other countries.</p>
<p>Around the world we seek no privileges, ask no favours, crave no territory.</p>
<p>Our shared preference is for more open markets, more humane societies, more democratic polities and more freedom under the law.</p>
<p>And we share an optimistic world view that embraces the future and all its possibilities.</p>
<p>Our relationship is a partnership for peace, for prosperity and for greater harmony right around our region and the wider world based on respect for the rights and dignity of every human being.</p>
<p>People who share a language are never total strangers and our particular partnership has the character of a warm and genial friendship.Â </p>
<p>One of the founders of the Asia Society Texas, former First Lady Barbara Bush, said in her memoir that âthe people of Australia are warm, relaxed, and very much like Texans, the biggest compliment I can pay anyone<a href="https://www.pm.gov.au/node/add/media-item#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="" id="_ftnref1">[1]</a>.â</p>
<p>A Texan President, Lyndon B Johnson, said after his plane made a forced landing in central Queensland that Australians are âthe best damn folks in the world, except maybe for the folks in Texasâ.</p>
<p>When democrats and republicans agree that Australians are like Texans then you can take it as true.</p>
<p>Certainly the friendly and hospitable people of Houston resemble Australians.</p>
<p>Like us, you look outward, with confidence, to meet tomorrowâs challenges.</p>
<p>The people of Houston see your city as an energy capital in the Asia Pacific Century.</p>
<p>From the other side of the ocean, Australia shares with you a common interest in powering that future with abundant and reliable energy.</p>
<p>Affordable, reliable energy fuels enterprise and drives employment.</p>
<p>It is the engine of economic development and wealth creation.</p>
<p>Australia should be an affordable energy superpower, using natureâs gifts to the benefit of our own people and the wider world.</p>
<p>Plentiful energy from reliable suppliers like Australia and the United States is essential for global growth.</p>
<p>Australians have followed closely the success of Americaâs shale energy revolution that has led to the United States once again becoming one of the worldâs largest producers of oil and gas.</p>
<p>In fact, Australians have helped make it happen, with BHP Billiton one of the largest foreign investors in US shale.</p>
<p>Shale energy means more economic growth and more jobs for Americans â McKinsey estimates up to 1.7 million more jobs by 2020 â and the world gets a reliable, stable energy supplier with a commitment to markets and the rule of law.</p>
<p>Sam Houston<a href="https://www.pm.gov.au/node/add/media-item#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="" id="_ftnref2">[2]</a> once said of Texas that âno country upon the globe can compare with it in natural advantages.â</p>
<p>Of course, General Houston never visited Australia.</p>
<p>Our resources are also remarkable:</p>
<p>Australia will soon be the worldâs number one exporter of liquefied natural gas.</p>
<p>Australia is the worldâs largest exporter of black coal.</p>
<p>And we are the worldâs third largest uranium producer.</p>
<p>Australian has significant resources of conventional gas, and more than one third of the worldâs known uranium sources.</p>
<p>Western Australia alone is estimated to hold the fifth largest reserves of shale gas in the world<a href="https://www.pm.gov.au/node/add/media-item#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="" id="_ftnref3">[3]</a>.</p>
<p>And we have an abundance of renewable energy, including some of the best wind and solar energy sources, and large geothermal energy potential.</p>
<p>A dynamic flow of investment and technology across the Pacific between Australia and the United States has helped to drive massive growth in Australiaâs energy production.</p>
<p>Chevronâs<a href="https://www.pm.gov.au/node/add/media-item#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title="" id="_ftnref4">[4]</a> Gorgon LNG project is Australiaâs single largest oil and gas project investment.</p>
<p>ConocoPhillips and Bechtel, based here in Houston, are currently building four of Australiaâs seven new LNG projects using Bechtelâs cascade technology.</p>
<p>Discussion about developing our natural resources often goes hand in hand with conversation about climate change and impacts on the environment.</p>
<p>It is prudent to do what we reasonably can to reduce carbon emissions.</p>
<p>But we donât believe in ostracising any particular fuel and we donât believe in harming economic growth.</p>
<p>For many decades at least coal will continue to fuel human progress as an affordable, dependable energy source for wealthy and developing countries alike.</p>
<p>Australia is abolishing the carbon tax because it has damaged our economy and increased energy costs for businesses and families.</p>
<p>Weâre replacing it with a AUS$2.55 billion fund that will prioritise cost-effective, targeted means to reduce emissions such as afforestation, soil carbon and cleaner power stations.</p>
<p>Itâs an incentive-based approach which will support Australian businesses and households to lower their energy costs at the same time as reducing Australia's emissions.</p>
<p>Australia is cutting red tape and getting rid of unnecessary regulation so that it is easier to do business in Australia, while maintaining our high environmental standards.</p>
<p>And weâre streamlining our decision making, giving the green light to new projects worth over $500 billion since the new government was elected in September last year.</p>
<p>Australia is also actively seeking new markets, vigorously pursuing freer trade with our key trading partners.</p>
<p>In words that might be familiar to this Texas audience<a href="https://www.pm.gov.au/node/add/media-item#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title="" id="_ftnref5">[5]</a>, on the night of my election I declared that Australia is open for business.</p>
<p>Now, I know that Governor Perry declared âTexas is wide open for businessâ â I guess everythingâs got to be bigger and better in Texas â but I say to Governor Perry, in the spirit of healthy competition, that Australia will be hard to beat.Â  </p>
<p>We recently concluded an economic partnership agreement with Japan, and signed a free trade agreement with South Korea.</p>
<p>We have also accelerated talks toward a free trade agreement with China.</p>
<p>The recently signed Free Trade Agreement with South Korea will ensure that Australiaâs mining resources, including crude petroleum and natural gas, will all become tariff free over 10 years.</p>
<p>Australia now has trade agreements with seven of its top ten trading partners.</p>
<p>And weâre working with President Obama to achieve a Trans Pacific Partnership agreement that is as comprehensive and ambitious as possible.</p>
<p>Trade is an essential part of building a stronger and more prosperous Australia.</p>
<p>Trade and commerce with Asia is thriving: three quarters of Australiaâs exports are to Asia.</p>
<p>Australia is a gateway to a region of immense opportunity, and because we are more than trading partners - because we are good global citizens â we are seeking to improve the operations of the world energy market.</p>
<p>The global energy landscape has changed dramatically in recent decades.</p>
<p>Emerging economies have become major players and the balance of energy trade has shifted towards the Asia Pacific region.</p>
<p>As this yearâs President of the G20 we want global energy institutions to reflect this reality, and want to make energy markets more transparent, resilient and efficient.</p>
<p>Ladies and Gentlemen, the similarities between Australia and Texas are striking.</p>
<p>Our populations are roughly equal with prosperity especially flowing from our energy, minerals and tourism.</p>
<p>We both look to the Asia Pacific region.</p>
<p>While Australia is the worldâs 12th largest economy by GDP, the state of Texas is the 13th.</p>
<p>Mark Twain visited Australia in 1895 and praised our âspirit of independenceâ; likewise, the independent spirit of Texas is the stuff of legend.</p>
<p>And each year in Australia a special service remembers the crew of the USS Houston, which was sunk alongside HMAS Perth in 1942, in the Battle of the Sunda Strait, heroes to the last fighting a much larger force<a href="https://www.pm.gov.au/node/add/media-item#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title="" id="_ftnref6">[6]</a>.</p>
<p>I have been buoyed to see evidence everywhere in Houston of Australians and Americans working together to meet the energy needs of the world.</p>
<p>That will increase with the establishment of an Australian Consulate-General here in Houston to promote and facilitate our links.</p>
<p>Nana Booker has well and truly alerted us to the possibilities of this city and this state over fourteen wonderful years and will forever be Honorary Consul Emeritus.</p>
<p>The modern world is unimaginable without energy.</p>
<p>Energy consumption defines prosperity.</p>
<p>As a world energy capital â this city is helping to power much of the planet.</p>
<p>And thereâs more that we can do together to end energy poverty and give people everywhere the better life we all seek.</p>
