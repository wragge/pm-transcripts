<p>New figures released by the Gillard Government today have confirmed that every single government school in Queensland will receive extra funding over the next six years, under our new and fairer funding model.</p>
<p>The figures, based on the needs-based funding model the Gillard Government wants to introduce for every school, reveal that schools with the highest needs will benefit the most from the National Plan for School Improvement.</p>
<p>The Government has released these figures today in response to the misleading and highly alarmist claims by the Newman Government that up to 300 schools in QLD will be worse off under the new national model.</p>
<p>These figures show that every single state school in Queensland will see more money flow over the next six years under our plan.</p>
<p>They will reassure parents, principals and the community that no school will be worse off under the new model.</p>
<p>This extra money will help Queensland schools give every student the best education possible, no matter where they live or their family background.</p>
<p>It will help deliver:</p>
<p> * 	More one on one attention and support in the classroom for every child;<br />
 * 	Specialist literacy and numeracy programs for those children in danger of being left behind;<br />
 * 	Greater assistance for those students with disability or special need; and<br />
 * 	Improvements in building the skills and knowledge of teachers and providing mentoring support for those who are new to the profession.</p>
<p>This is a once in a lifetime opportunity to deliver the biggest investment in education in generations.</p>
<p>It's time for Premier Newman to get serious, stop his misleading scare campaign, and to sign up to the Gillard Government's plan for better schools.</p>
<p>The Newman Government needs to commit to paying their fair share of the $3.8 billion on offer over the next six years, as that is the only way to guarantee that Queensland schools will have the resources they need to give their students a world-class education.</p>
<p>The figures released today have been calculated using the Schooling Resource Standard model, which includes a base amount per student and extra money through loadings for indigenous and low SES students, students with disability, and students with limited English skills. Small schools and schools in regional and remote locations also receive extra funding.</p>
<p>Under the National Plan, the Commonwealth will allocate federal funding for all schools in states that sign up using the SRS. State Governments must agree to also distribute funding using a needs-based model, and to increase school funding by at least 3 per cent every year. The final details of any Queensland needs-based funding model will need to be confirmed with the State Government, however this data demonstrates the substantial increase in funding available for all schools under the new needs based system.</p>
<p>Based on the SRS model the Gillard Government is implementing, a similar result would be produced for all school sectors, in every state and territory  -  funding increases for every school, with the biggest increases going to schools with the highest needs.</p>
