    <content><![CDATA[<p>I congratulate Hamid Karzai on his re-election as President of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan. </p>
<p>This election has taken place in difficult circumstances. The outcome has been determined by the Afghan authorities and is consistent with Afghanistan's constitution and laws.</p>
<p>The challenges facing the next Afghan Government are substantial, and they must be confronted without delay.</p>
<p>The task before President Karzai is now to form a government that can win the trust of the Afghan people by strengthening Afghanistan's security, fighting corruption and delivering effective governance and basic services.</p>
<p>The Australian Government will continue to work with the international community and the United Nations in supporting the Afghan Government's efforts to combat terrorism and to deliver development to its people, primarily through Australia's commitment in Oruzgan province. </p>
