PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR PRESS 5 SEPTEMBER 1977<br />
MR WHITLAM'S NATIONAL BROADCAST ON<br />
URANIUM'<br />
The Leader of the Opposition last night made a<br />
National Broadcast -about Australia's decision on uranium which<br />
was dishonest and deceptive. It misleads the Australian public<br />
and provokes division within the community. It contains<br />
selective quotation and misrepresentation.<br />
Mr Whitlam said that the Government's decision<br />
commits Australia to the export of uranium regardless of the<br />
lack of international.-controls to prevent the spread of<br />
nuclear weapons and to reduce. the risks of nuclear war.<br />
Nothing could be further from the truth.<br />
The Government's policy on nuclear safeguards,<br />
announced by me on 24 May and described in detail in the<br />
material explaining the Government's decisions of 25 August,<br />
will ensure the application of the most stringent nuclear<br />
safeguards to Australian uranium. That policy goes beyond the<br />
recommendations of the Ranger Inquiry in:<br />
The requirement for International Atomic Energy Agency<br />
safeguards on any nuclear material supplied by Australia<br />
to existing nuclear weapon states.<br />
The requirements for prior Australian consent to<br />
high enrichment<br />
reprocessing<br />
of nuclear materials supplied by Australia .2 </p>
<p>2.<br />
The requirement for assurances of adequate physical<br />
security The requirement for a clause in contracts noting that<br />
transactions are subject to Australia's safeguard<br />
requirements.<br />
But the Government is not complacent; it will be going further.<br />
As I have already announced, the Government will investigate<br />
areas in which Australia could assist the International Atomic<br />
Energy Agency. The Governient will act with other suppliers to<br />
ensure that nuclear safeguards are effective and are kept under<br />
review and improvement.<br />
Mr Whitlam claims that the Australian Government has<br />
committed itself to supplying uranium before any of the 0<br />
customer countries have committed themselves to safeguards.<br />
This is a gross misrepresentation. The Government has decided<br />
that the mining of Australian uranium should proceed but with<br />
exports permitted only to countries that accept safeguards of our<br />
standard. Non-nuclear weapon states who wish to import our<br />
uranium must be parties to the Non-Proliferation Treaty, involving<br />
International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards. Existing nuclear<br />
weapon states must agree that Australian uranium will not be used<br />
for military or explosive purposes and will be covered by<br />
International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards.<br />
Mr Whitlam again misrepresents the facts when he says<br />
it does not make sense to play the game before the other side has<br />
agreed to stick to the rules. The Government's position is<br />
precisely that we will not authorise the sale of uranium unless<br />
customers fully accept our safeguards requirements. / 3 </p>
<p>3.<br />
They will be required to enter into a binding bilateral<br />
agreement on those requirements before any Australian uranium<br />
is exported to them.<br />
The Ranger Inquiry says " the dangers of proliferation<br />
are very serious. They affect the whole world and exist whether<br />
or not Australia makes its uranium available to other countries"<br />
It is quite clear that Australia's place in advancing the cause of<br />
non-proliferation, in furthering development of stringent safeguards,<br />
and in contributing to studies aimed at reducing the risks of<br />
proliferation such as the International Nuclear Fuel Cycle Evaluation<br />
will be very much less if Australia decides to wait for ten or twenty<br />
years before making a decision on the export of uranium.<br />
Again, when Mr Whitlam says that the export of<br />
Australian uranium would increase the amount of man-made nuclear<br />
waste, he is misleading. Countries requiring uranium for peaceful<br />
purposes-to heat homes and to provide jobs will acquire that<br />
uranium from other sources. Those other sources may be less<br />
concerned than Australia is about the risks of proliferation<br />
and may not require the stringent safeguards that Australia does.<br />
Mr Whitlam's proposal that we delay a decision about uranium<br />
would do nothing about the amount of nuclear waste in the-world,<br />
could increase the costs of power generation in energy-poor countries<br />
and, indeed, could increase risks of nuclear proliferation.<br />
Mr Whitlam causes further confusion when he refers<br />
to the application of International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards<br />
in the Euratom countries. The plain fact is that, under its<br />
nuclear safeguards policy, the Government will not agree to the<br />
supply of Australian uranium unless it is covered by International<br />
Atomic Energy Agency safeguards from the time it leaves Australian<br />
ownership. Pending the completion of subsidiary arrangements with ./ 4 </p>
<p>4<br />
Euratom countries, the International Atomic Energy Agency is<br />
empowered to make ad hoc inspections, and is already doing so.<br />
Mr Whitlam misleads again when he says that the<br />
United States cannot account for some 8000 pounds of nuclear<br />
material. The United States' Nuclear Regulatory Commission has<br />
stated that there has never been an unresolved case of enough<br />
" Material Unaccounted For" to make a bomb. " Material Unaccounted For"<br />
is not necessarily a result of diversion but is usually the result<br />
of the limits of precision of analysis and of operating losses<br />
such as deposits on pipes and filters.<br />
Mr Whitlam misuses statements by the Ranger Inquiry, by<br />
me and by the Minister for Environment, Housing and Community<br />
Development when he talks about the disposal of nuclear waste. Let<br />
me be clear. The technology for handling high-level radioactive<br />
liquid wastes exists and is proven. The technology for the<br />
solidification and vitrification of those wastes into a form suitable<br />
for ultimate disposal exists and is being developed on a commercial<br />
scale. Mr Whitlam makes a spurious and dishonest comparison<br />
between the safe storage of nuclear waste and the atmospheric testing<br />
of nuclear weapons. There are no proposals by other countries thai<br />
we should store their nuclear waste. Mr Whitlam is ignoring the<br />
concern of other Governments in Japan, in Europe, in the<br />
developing countries for the welfareof their people and the well-bein<br />
of their environments. Mr Whitlam, having made a show of examining<br />
his own conscience, is now trying to act as the conscience of thewbrld<br />
The price he would pay would be to reduce Australia's effectiveness<br />
in international forums concerned with nuclear proliferation and<br />
waste disposal. </p>
<p>Mr Whitlam's course is a gesture to protesters at home.<br />
The Government's course is constructive and internationally<br />
responsible. Mr Whitlam dismisses the economic significance of<br />
exporting uranium. He says the export income, royalties, jobs will<br />
not begin for five or even ten years and so, he says, the<br />
decision is irrelevant to Australia's current economic problems.<br />
This illustrates the myopic and blinkered attitude of the<br />
Opposition. Mr Whitlam ignores the benefits the jobs that<br />
will result from the construction works at the mines; these<br />
are not five to ten years hence. However, most seriously of all,<br />
he ignores the fact that in five years time Australia will be<br />
facing economic problems if it does not have additional export<br />
income, not least to pay for additional imports of oil.<br />
Mr Whitlam would not only have us deny other countries the energy<br />
they-need, he would have us, too, out of work and shivering in the<br />
cold as energy costs mount. That is only to be expected from<br />
the leader of a Party which, in Government, brought exploration<br />
for oil in Australia to a halt. Mr Whitlam ignores the totality of<br />
our energy needs. The Government does not.<br />
Mr Whitlam says the Ranger Inquiry favoured a delay of<br />
several years in the decision about supplying Australia's uranium.<br />
This is untrue. The Ranger Inquiry said on page 5 of its Second<br />
Report that " a decision on the options ( to delay or not to delay)<br />
depended largely on what was deemed to be the best strategy in<br />
relation to the matter of prbliferation". The Government took its<br />
decision with full regard for advancing the cause of<br />
non-proliferation. President Carter's initiatives, the International<br />
Nuclear Fuel Cycle Evaluation, and recent deepening in international<br />
concerns about proliferation make this the most propitious time<br />
for Australia to make its decision. / 6 </p>
<p>It is significant that throughout his broadcast<br />
speech, Mr Whitlam referred to the Ranger Inquiry as the<br />
" Fox Commission". Mr Whitlam ignores the fact that Mr Justice Fox<br />
for whom the Government has the highest esteem was one of<br />
three Commissioners; the other two were Mr G. G. Kelleher and<br />
Professor C. B. Kerr. The Ranger Inquiry's recommendations<br />
were unanimous. The Government gave careful and lengthy<br />
consideration to those recommendations. It arrived at its<br />
decisions on them after consideration of other relevant factors,<br />
including international developments in non-proliferation.<br />
The Government explained its decisions fully and honestly to 0<br />
the Australian people. Unlike the Opposition, it has explained<br />
its decisions consistently.<br />
Finally, I reiterate what I placed on public record<br />
on 25 August:<br />
" The Government's decision was taken on the basis of the<br />
Inquiry's principal findings and recommendations.<br />
" On uranium mining, the Inquiry concluded:<br />
' The hazards of mining and milling uranium, if those<br />
activities are properly regulated and controlled, are not<br />
such as to justify a decision not to develop Australian<br />
uranium mines.'<br />
The Government is now satisfied that the environmental<br />
control and industrial health measures proposed by the Inquiry<br />
and accepted by the Government, will provide proper regulation<br />
and control.<br />
" On nuclear power reactors, the Inquiry concluded:<br />
' The hazards involved in the ordinary operations of nuclear<br />
power reactors, if those operatinns are properly regulated and<br />
controlled, are not such as to justify a decision not to mine<br />
and sell Australian uranium.' / 7<br />
i </p>
<p>This is in accordance with the Government' s own view.<br />
" On waste disposal from nuclear power stations, the Inquiry<br />
concluded: ' While we do not think that the waste situation is at present<br />
such as to justify Australia wholly refusing to export uranium,<br />
it is plain that the situation demands careful watching, and<br />
depending on developments, regular and frequent reassessment.'<br />
The Government is satisfied that the technology exists for the<br />
safe management and ultimate disposal of highly radioactive waste.<br />
International developments will continue to be closely reviewed and<br />
Australia will continue to participate in international studies<br />
directed to improve standards for waste disposal.<br />
" On the possibility of nuclear terrorism, the Inquiry concluded:<br />
' In our view, the possibility of nuclear terrorism merits<br />
energetic consideration and action at the international level.<br />
We do not believe that this risk alone constitutes a sufficient<br />
reason for Australia declining to supply uranium. It does, however,<br />
provide a further reason why the export of our uranium, including<br />
what is proposed to be done with it, and where, are matters which<br />
the Government should keep under constant scutiny and control.'<br />
The Government is satisfied that the specification of standards of<br />
physical security by the International Atomic Energy Agency<br />
constitutes the basis upon which national governments can provide<br />
strong protection against nuclear terrorism.<br />
" On Australia's international obligations, the Inquiry concluded:<br />
' A total refusal to supply would place Australia in clear<br />
breach of Article IV of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and<br />
could adversely affect its relation to countries which are parties<br />
to the<br />
Article IV of theTreaty obliges Australia to co-operate in the / 8 </p>
<p>production and usage of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes.<br />
The export by Australia of uranium under stringent safeguards<br />
would give effect to our obligations under Articles III and IV<br />
of the Treaty"<br />
