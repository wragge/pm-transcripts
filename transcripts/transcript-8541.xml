TRANSCRIPT OF TaX PRINZ MINISTER TRZ RON P J K= ATIM UP,<br />
AND THI TRZASURWR, TIM RON JOHN DAKINS UP<br />
JOINT PRESS CONFERENCZ, CANBNRPA FRIDAX, 12 JN 1992<br />
z 6 0 z PROOF ONLY<br />
PM: I would just like to make a few introductory remarks.<br />
I might then invite the Treasurer to do the same.<br />
The first thing I would like to say is that, as I<br />
said this morning, our deliberations are now broken<br />
into two parts. That is one part being non-financial<br />
matters, the other being financial matters with<br />
some of the carry over from the non-financial things<br />
in the financial meeting, that happened today. But<br />
you know that I have always said to you in contradistinction<br />
the prevailing wisdom that Lhis has<br />
always been a most efficient meeting. The fact that<br />
we can allocate $ 17 billion of funds in the course of<br />
an afternoon and resolve a lot of national issues<br />
quickly, which are not capable of being resolved in<br />
Ministerial Council meetings, even though they have<br />
taken months, sometimes years, always made the one<br />
day Premiers' Conference meeting a terribly efficient<br />
meeting. Now the past popular conception of these<br />
was that it was a sort of undignified scrabble for<br />
money, where in fact we had made this a very<br />
dignified process. The formal offer is now conveyed<br />
to the Premiers a couple days before the meeting, but<br />
that doesn't detract, it has only added to the<br />
efficiency of the day and being able to resolve<br />
issues and I think today we have had a good day. The<br />
Commonwealth and the States and the public of<br />
Australia have had a good day from this meeting and<br />
it has been again a most efficient day where very few<br />
countries would be able to get as many issues<br />
resolved as we have. Firstly, we have resolved on<br />
the Financial Assistance Grants disbursements to the<br />
States over the course or 19z9r23. As you know we<br />
have added to the pool by $ 150 million, now<br />
$ 170 million, as we varied the offer in the course of<br />
the day so that New South Wales and Victoria received<br />
what they would have received per capita, even though<br />
the rest of the States received what they did on the<br />
basis of the Grants Commission relativities. You<br />
understand the relativities. The pool is allocated </p>
<p>on the 1992/ 93 relativities. But the top-up of<br />
$ 150 million, on those relativities, would have<br />
detracted from New South wales and Victoria and that<br />
distributioelarrangement comprehends the boom period<br />
and stamp duties of a couple of years ago. So<br />
today's Grants Commission formula is not adequately<br />
reflecting the contemporary condition of the economy<br />
and as come little modification of that, we let<br />
Victoria and New South wales take their share on a<br />
per capita basis and basically the Commonwealth added<br />
million in the pool to do it. So we have that<br />
agreed and that was going to be the most difficult<br />
issue of the day, the distribution of the pool. The<br />
second thing was we decided that we would try owdfa<br />
effectively and genuinely do something about the<br />
whole fiscal equalisation and distribution question<br />
and in the course -o-f thedd icussiong, we raised the<br />
issue as New South Wales and Victoria had raised<br />
it, the smaller States resisted because the formulas<br />
were working in their favour and we said that we<br />
would have, as you see in our Press Statement, that<br />
we needed to look at the sustainability or the<br />
horizontal fiscal equalisation in the long term<br />
that is looking at the principles and the<br />
methodology, the principles underlying fiscal<br />
equalisation and the methodology and the<br />
Commonwealth, for our part, made the offer that les+.<br />
the sma. ll States fear any such inquiry and their fear<br />
in the past has thwarted any such inquiry, what we<br />
would do is we would allow the introduction of a<br />
Grants Commission benchmark relativity for 1993/ 94,<br />
upon which they could judge whether any new<br />
relativity would cost them money and if it did the<br />
Commonwealth would meet the adjustment costs over a<br />
three year period. In other words, to encourage the<br />
smaller States to agree " to an inquiry into this<br />
issue, we would carry some of the burden of any<br />
subsequent adjustment. The result was a degree of<br />
equanimity around this proposal to have this inquiry<br />
by Treasuris and heads of Treasuris and to make the<br />
information available to the Premiers'<br />
Conference/ Loan Council before next year, was I think<br />
by all me~ asures a breakthrough. The Treasurer and I<br />
think we did pretty well and I think the States have<br />
a sneaking suspicion they did too. Now the other<br />
issue that we move to is the question or TAFE~ and as<br />
you know there has been a reluctance on the part of<br />
the States to do much about TAFE. For our part we<br />
wanted to build, we think it is entirely important in<br />
this country to build a national Technical and<br />
Further Education system of substance and stature.<br />
Something that kids will want to go to and would be<br />
proud to have a diploma from and where the training<br />
profile or these institutions more adequately<br />
reflects the labour market. That we don't have at<br />
the moment. We do have some quality, in varying<br />
degrees, in some of the TAFE areas in some of the<br />
States, but we don't have that. Our proposal in one </p>
<p>3<br />
Nation was for commuonwealth control of the funds, but<br />
joint control of the policy. Now Mrs Kirrner put a<br />
proposal this morning which is essentially that,<br />
except that instead of it being administered by DEET,<br />
the Department of Employment, Education and Training,<br />
it would be administered by an authority, members<br />
of which would be appointed by the Commonwealth.<br />
Well let's say for the purpose of the discussion<br />
which we then had that, and concluded, this proposal<br />
the proposal of Mrs Kirner would be at least a<br />
starting point proposal for a subsequent discussion<br />
by the central agencies of the Commonwealth and the<br />
States, with Kim Beazley and his Department to design<br />
up a new system around an authority rather than a<br />
department. Administering the TATE system in a<br />
national structure, where the Commonwealth would be<br />
accountable for the funding and for the appointment<br />
of people to operate it and therefore the people<br />
operating it to establish its policy, but the day to<br />
day administration would largely still be the<br />
bureaucracies which exist in the States. Gradually<br />
that would shift over to the authority. Now we<br />
started with the support of Victoria and then New<br />
South Wales, Western Australia then came on board for<br />
a consideration of this. I think beyond that South<br />
Australia had indicated a willingness to look and<br />
they wanted to keep the momentum going, go we are<br />
going to start next week and try and roll it on under<br />
the chairmanship of the Secretary of the Prime<br />
Minister's Department, but under the * leadership of<br />
Mr Beazley and we will try and push this thing<br />
through so we can develop a model. it may rnot be the<br />
model Mrs Kirner proposed today, but a model which<br />
reflects the need to develop a national TATE system,<br />
which has got joint Commonwealth and industry<br />
participation. So on those issues, as you know, we<br />
are concerned about youth unemployment and in about a<br />
month from now I intend to hold a meeting on this<br />
subject and we would like this thing, as a very<br />
important part of it, if we can have it up and ready<br />
to go by then, if possible. If we can get agreement.<br />
So I regard that as a breakthrough and the fiscal<br />
equalisation as a substantial breakthrough in terms<br />
of getting agreement to a study which is real, not<br />
just a study which has a States' opinion and a<br />
Commnonwealth opinion or disagreed opinions and put<br />
then, in a pigeon hole, but that one that is real,<br />
that is going to make a difference and we have got<br />
the distribution as well. Would you like to say<br />
anything John.<br />
T; Oh, except to say that I think the major bone of<br />
contention when the States arrived here was ot the<br />
extent of the Commonwealth offer in respect r<br />
1992/ 93, but rather the distribution. That was<br />
clearly an acrimonious issue during the last couple<br />
of days and I think the fact that that has now been<br />
resolved amicably I think is a tribute to the sense </p>
<p>4<br />
of cooperation which existed throughout the meeting.<br />
You will see also that the Loan Council agreed to a<br />
program of borrowings by the States and by the<br />
Commonwealth. Some other more minor matters were<br />
dealt with by the Loan Council as well and I think<br />
that, generally speaking, it was a result which left<br />
everyone pretty well pleased.<br />
J: Prime Minister, today the two biggest States upped<br />
their taxes and clearly are hanging these rises<br />
around your neck.<br />
PM: No let me just say this. Whatever States do about<br />
receipts can not be hung around our neck. We are all<br />
responsible foz* A'udgets in this country. We have<br />
given them in these Financial Assistance Grants more<br />
of a go then they would have thought they would have<br />
got. That is not just the maintenance of a real<br />
terms guarantee on this year's funding, but<br />
population growth added in $ 150 million, in fact,<br />
$ 170 million. More than population growth. Now<br />
given the fact that our budgets have deteriorated<br />
much more rapidly than theirs because our receipts<br />
have fallen away more sharply, in our circumstances<br />
it is a concession on our part to be providing a pool<br />
of this size in addition to a real terms guarantee.<br />
T: The point is that all of the States got very close,<br />
not only was the pool more than same real, except for<br />
Victoria, New South Wales and the ACT, and in<br />
relation to New South Wales and Victoria they were<br />
only just short of same real., * 7en you combine the<br />
other payments that they received along with the<br />
general purpose payments. So whatever point the<br />
States are making about the need for tax increases,<br />
it can't be left at our doorstep because of the<br />
changes we have made. To some extent New South Wales<br />
and Victoria don't think they get enough of the funds<br />
that come from the Commonwealth, but that is a<br />
separate issue.<br />
PM: Letl. me just run down these figures. The deflator we<br />
are using here is 1.7 that is general revenue<br />
paymients and other net payments, that is specific<br />
purpose payments total Commonwealth payments to the<br />
States and not through the States is for: New South<br />
Wales 6.7, so it is 5 per cent real; Victoria 5.3,<br />
which is 4.5 per cent real; Queensland 7.1, which is<br />
per cent real. I mean they are all 4 and 5 per<br />
cent real numbers. Because remember this, there is<br />
$ 800 million of One Nation infrastructure spending in<br />
Commonwealth payments to the States this year.<br />
Table 1, if you look at that, 1992/ 93 the outside<br />
line.<br />
T: I was referring to the next table. </p>
<p>PM: Yes, John is referring to the Financial Assistance<br />
Grants, but if you look at the total Of the payments<br />
or even if you look at the Financial Assistance<br />
Grants, they are all rising in real terms, but<br />
remember that One Nation is largely spent on State<br />
infrastructure spending which would have to be spent<br />
by them anyway, at some point roads, rail, etc. So<br />
there is $ 800 million going their way as a result of<br />
One Nation, plus $ 170 million today on top ofareal<br />
terms guarantee. There is nearly a billion dollars<br />
of extra money. I mean they can't lay any problems<br />
at our door.<br />
J: So N4ew South Wales and Victoria have got no excuse<br />
for raising these taxes in so far as today's meeting<br />
is concerned?<br />
PM: I don't think there is any doubt that their revenues<br />
have declined in the recession, but that either means<br />
that they cover it by cuts in Government spending or<br />
debt.<br />
j Mr Greiner estimates that the inflationary impact of<br />
his taxes will be between 0.5 and 0.7 and Mrs Kirner<br />
says she hasn't done these sums, but she thinks that<br />
sounds about right. What do you thinkbtkie<br />
inflationary impact of the two of the most densely<br />
populated States putting up these taxes?<br />
PM; I have got no idea. I have got absolutely no idea at<br />
what they have in mind. But the point is in terms of<br />
total Commonwealth payments, they are very strong and<br />
in terms of their recurrent payments, I mean, here we<br />
are we have got a large budget imbalance and we have<br />
just added $ 170 million to it basically to ease their<br />
budgetary position. </p>
<p>J: Did you urge Victoria and New South Wales at today's<br />
meeting not to undertake these tax and charges<br />
rises?<br />
PM: We said so publicly, I think.<br />
T: You would have seen what I said at the beginning of<br />
the public session, arnd the offer document was<br />
provided on the basis that there would be no undue<br />
recourse to tax increases which had an adverse<br />
inflationary consequence. Now I haven't seen the<br />
details of what the two governments want to do, or<br />
propose to do, I haven't obviously had an<br />
opportunity to check the inflationary impact of them<br />
and I don't know the basis on which they've made<br />
those calculations, and what impact they would have<br />
on the national CPI figure. So we'll have to<br />
obviously have a look at that.<br />
3: Did they make It clear to you, Treasurer, as they<br />
walked out of the meeting that they were intending<br />
on doing this because Mrs Kirner said that in fact<br />
she and Mr Greiner conferred previously that they<br />
had taken these steps?<br />
T: They hadn't conferred to us, or not with me, and<br />
what they said In relation to the chances of them<br />
driven to tax increases was said In the public<br />
session. So you know as much~ about that as I do.<br />
3: Haven't you Seen what they've put out since?<br />
T: No.<br />
J: Do you think as well as cutting services that<br />
cutting public service salaries might be an option<br />
for the governments at thstmIt as done in the<br />
1930s in the time of depression.<br />
PM: we're not in a depression, though. I mean in a<br />
depression, in the United States depression I can't<br />
remember the numbers for Australia, but in the<br />
United States GDP went down by 40 per cent. In the<br />
United States in this recession it's gone down by 3<br />
per cent, and over the course of the period probably<br />
by a cumulative 3 to 4 per cent. I mean, these are<br />
just not comparable periods, and that's not I don't<br />
think a reasonable question, a reasonable solution<br />
to problems. The wage share and GDP are still at<br />
historically low levels.<br />
3: Mr Dawkins, in your statement you say the states and<br />
territories indicated they should not increase state<br />
taxes and charges other then a lest resort, in the<br />
last sentence of the last page. Before this had<br />
actually come of f the photocopier both New South<br />
Wales and victoria had announced their Increases.<br />
At the very least this sounds like bad faith. </p>
<p>-7<br />
7<br />
T: Well, I think they may well have raised these<br />
matters with a little more candour with us during<br />
the course of the discussions if they were going to<br />
announce them before they had even got home and had<br />
an opportunity to properly assess the outcome of the<br />
meeting. But obviously we're not responsible for<br />
their actions.<br />
3: Mr Dawkins, they say one thing to you in the meeting<br />
and then in halt an hour do something else.<br />
T: No, no, let me make it clear. in the context of<br />
your allegation that there wasn bad faith, what they<br />
said to us In relation to tax increases Is what they<br />
said during the public session. Now Mr Greiner did<br />
say during that session that in the context of the<br />
current situation they would have to look at tax<br />
increases.<br />
3: out they obviously had a clear plan worked out<br />
because they've got very precise figures here in<br />
both their releases, and coordinated.<br />
T: Well, what do you expect us to say? The fact Is<br />
they didn't discuss It with us.<br />
3: Well it's a question of faith, Isn't It? They sat<br />
through the whole day and they had it in the shot<br />
and ready to pull the trigger.<br />
PM: They did say that they thought they would have to<br />
increase charges. They didn't say by how much and<br />
where.<br />
3: Didn't you expect themi to at least give you a copy<br />
of the press release before you came in here?<br />
PM: It would have been a reasonable courtesy, I think,<br />
yes. But again, can I just say, It's all about<br />
level. The fact is very rarely have we seen any one<br />
year where the states have not increased charges.<br />
So we're not going to hold our breath and gasp at<br />
that. But it's about level, about how large it is.<br />
3: Prime minister, you say that it's been a good<br />
outcome, Nick Greiner says he's angry, Joan Kirner<br />
says she's disappointed, and the two major states<br />
have raised taxes.<br />
PM: Well we expect you to have at least the standard<br />
level of journalist guile to understand when someone<br />
is angry or not angry, moderately pleased or quite<br />
pleased. And I think~ a modicum of scribe's guile<br />
would lead you to the conclusion that they were<br />
quite pleased with the outcome. </p>
<p>8<br />
3: You say that it Is an achievement today that the<br />
states have agreed not to bring on any undue tax<br />
increases. This financial year the tax Increases<br />
for New South Wales and Victoria will be $ 370<br />
million, in a full financial year it will be half a<br />
billion. Is that due or undue?<br />
PM: We'll have a look at the numbers. But again, I<br />
can't give you off the top of my head effects about<br />
inflationary Impacts.<br />
T: It they've decided to raise taxes before they left<br />
Canberra they must have had also decided that<br />
publicly, at least, they'd be unhappy regardless of<br />
what happened today, in order to justify such a<br />
decision.<br />
PM: They certainly left the meeting quite happy. Let's<br />
say that. Between the meeting and here I'm not sure<br />
what happened. But they left the meeting quite<br />
happy, they all thought there was a bon homie of<br />
national achievements and everything alse.<br />
J: But forgetting their happiness or unhappiness we<br />
still have two statements that are quite at odds<br />
one the offer document and second, the two Premiers'<br />
announcement*.<br />
PM: What things are at odds?<br />
J: On the one hand the offer document Is saying that<br />
they'd not raise taxes and charges. On the other<br />
hand they had done just that and haven't told you.<br />
T: Leave aside the fact that they haven't told us,<br />
which is I think a defect, but they did not promise<br />
not to put up taxes, nor did we seek such an<br />
undertaking. We said that they should assume, I<br />
think the words of the offer document were that they<br />
should eschew any undue increases, and the words of<br />
my statement say that they should only do it as a<br />
lost resort. I am a little surprised that they got<br />
to the last resort between the Cabinet Room and up<br />
here.<br />
PM1: And they probably think that in the low inflationary<br />
culture provided by this Government that whatever<br />
increases they slipped through would subsumed in the<br />
culture somewhere.<br />
3: Would you agree with that, Prime Minister?<br />
PM; I don't know that that was what motivated them.<br />
3: Would you agree that the low Inflation we have at<br />
the moment will subsume these increases, or might? </p>
<p>PM: I don't know, one has to see. But we' ve been doing<br />
better on Inflation than I think most people would<br />
have expected.<br />
J: Mr Dawkins, Is the 1.7 deflator you've used Is<br />
that essentially your inflation forecast or 1992-93?<br />
It It Is then that's quite an Impressive figure.<br />
T: No, it's the March to March figure just passed.<br />
J; So you can say that roughly It equates to 2 except<br />
that ? 7<br />
T: From March to March, it's the CPI figure though,<br />
it's not the non-formi deflator or other. The basis<br />
of the deflator that's used for the purposes of<br />
these grants, the same rule undertaken that was<br />
given a couple of years ago, was based on the<br />
prospective increase on the CP1 March to March.<br />
PM: We used to use the non-farm GDP deflator but when<br />
commodity prices were coming down it was, they<br />
though, unduly lower, and therefore they wanted the<br />
CPi. So they've now got the CPI and the CPI is the<br />
measure we use.<br />
3: In your overview of the economy, Mr Dawkins, you<br />
only refer to Australia doing better than the 3 per<br />
cent OECD average. And also I'd like to ask, why is<br />
It that you haven't kept up with the precedent set<br />
by your predecessor Mr Keating and release the JEFO<br />
forecasts?<br />
PM; No, no.<br />
J: it was a precedent.<br />
PM: Not much of a one.<br />
T: it was a precedent, but it was a precedent not worth<br />
following, I think. And the fact is that we had the<br />
federal estimates In the One Nation statement. I<br />
mean we don't go about making these renewed<br />
forecasts month by month. The JEFG process, as far<br />
as I know, hasn't finished. And even If It has I<br />
wouldn't release the figures anyway. We will be<br />
releasing those estimates in the context of the<br />
Budget because they'll probably move around now and<br />
then anyway. And we don't make month by month<br />
forecasts on growth in the year ahead. We will<br />
provide you with, you seem to the one who is most<br />
anxious about these things, will provide you with<br />
our latest forecasts of growth in the context of the<br />
Budget in the normal way. </p>
<p>TE:<br />
PM: That was only a purple pen to sign the books of f at<br />
the time.<br />
3; Mr Dawkins, today you were saying that you were<br />
concerned about the uneven economic performance<br />
between the states and between some of the regions.<br />
What implication does that have for your policy?<br />
Will you be looking at more specifically targeting<br />
assistance to particular areas that seem to be<br />
suffering while states such as WA seem to be doing<br />
mnuch better?<br />
T: I made the point this morning that there are these<br />
very great regional differences and state by state<br />
differences which, exist not only In respect of<br />
unemployment figures where you've got in some states<br />
jobs still being lost and in other states job growth<br />
being quite clearly in evidence. Now what I've said<br />
is that I think the objective of policy on the part<br />
of both the states and ourselves should be directed<br />
towards those areas where the job market is still<br />
deteriorating. And I don't Intend to say anything<br />
more about that now, just to reiterate that point.<br />
3: Mr Keating, Mr Greiner said that at one point during<br />
today's proceedings you described the current system<br />
of fiscal equalisation as unsustainable. 1s that a<br />
proper reflection of your views?<br />
PM: No, I said it will not be sustainable while at least<br />
the two large states believe that the system Is<br />
patently unfair to them and the principles<br />
underlying it, and the methodology which accompanies<br />
it Is no longer appropriate or a reflection of<br />
contemporary conditions. Now there were years that.<br />
the Fraser Government just didn't accept Grants<br />
Commission recommendations, just ignored them. The<br />
Grants Commission and its recommendations are<br />
relevant only to the extent that a Loan Council<br />
Premiers Conference wants to adopt them. If we<br />
don't the Loan Council is irrelevant to these<br />
processes. Therefore, if you have the two large<br />
states in there not continuing to be part of the<br />
compact, a wise manager of the system says there is<br />
something wrong here, So let's go through and see.<br />
whether the principles are right and whether the<br />
methodology is right. And that's what we sought,<br />
but every time we've sought to do that the smaller<br />
states the beneficiaries of the current<br />
methodology, always object. So as a way, if you<br />
like, of greasing the tracks for a real evaluation<br />
of this thing, we said we'd carry some of the<br />
adjustment burden in the event that there was a<br />
marked shift away from the relativities of 1993-94<br />
from the Grants Commission. </p>
<p>J: Mr Keating, have you any doubt that a fair end<br />
proper review of the methodology would result in an<br />
advantage to New South Wales and Victoria?<br />
PM: To the extent that there is structural change In the<br />
economy and that the structure of the states like<br />
QVuiecetnosrliaan d iiss chcahnagnignign. g anIdn tteher mss trouf cttuhre e roefl ative<br />
decline of manufacturing then there may be some<br />
change, but to the extent there is we will help In<br />
the process of adjustment.<br />
3: Is there any way of making the methodology more<br />
understandable. I mean I'm sure you've looked at<br />
the algebra in the Grants Commission updates they<br />
are incomprehensible.<br />
PM: The thing Is I think the most Important thing is<br />
that whatever they say should be a contemporary<br />
reflection of circumstances. Whereas now what we're<br />
getting is a retrospective reflection of<br />
circumstances. I think that's the problem. Whether<br />
you can simplify It Obviously if it is more<br />
transparent the better, more understandable, more<br />
transparent the better. Whether we can get there I<br />
don't know.<br />
3: Mr Keating, has it taken the gloss your day at all,<br />
that you've come In here and been told about halt a<br />
billion dollars of extra taxes in two states?<br />
PM: No, in the sense that we thought they were going to<br />
lift taxes and charges, we've said to them be<br />
restrained, be sensible about It. But I think from<br />
our point of view the longer run issue is, can we<br />
out of this establish a better basis for fiscal<br />
relationships in the Commonwealth of Australia? And<br />
the answer to that will probably be an unambiguous<br />
yes. And have we made progress today in the<br />
establishment, on a long term basis, of a national<br />
technical and further education system? And I think<br />
we can say yes. I mean we will know soon. These<br />
are things which were never attempted in the last<br />
forty years.<br />
3: Prime Minister, Mr Greiner has come out with a<br />
statement saying " Mr Keating kicks his own state and<br />
then announces changes". what effect to you think<br />
this will have, the electoral impact, the rising of<br />
tobacco and beer prices?<br />
PM: I don't know what he said, today or when?<br />
J: Yes, today.<br />
PM: I think he's probably written that before the<br />
meeting. You gee the meeting has gone better than<br />
they expected and I think they've got to live with </p>
<p>those remarks, not me. Mr Greiner could not<br />
complain that the Treasurer and I have facilitated<br />
an inquiry Into fiscal equalisation which stands at<br />
least to clarify the New South Wales position, where<br />
New South Wales has claimed now for some time now<br />
that the methodology runs against them. That's an<br />
unambiguous benefit for New South Wales. I don't<br />
think Mr Greiner could say that when the smallest<br />
states were not prepared to see New South Wales and<br />
Victoria get the benefit of per capita funding out<br />
of the pool today, the Treasurer and I agreed to top<br />
up the pool for New South Wales and Victoria. I<br />
don't think It's sustainable that anything I've done<br />
has been other than doing things which are sensible<br />
to keep the federation moving, and also happens to<br />
be coincidentally beneficial to New South Wales.<br />
T: What the Premier of New South Wales said in the open<br />
session, and it's the only time he said It, was that<br />
we should have doubled our offer from $ 150 to $ 300<br />
million. Had we doubled our offer he would only<br />
have got an additional $ 50 million at the most as a<br />
result of doubling the offer. So to the extent that<br />
he is trying to fit us with the responsibility for<br />
his own tax increases, all he ever asked us and I<br />
might say he didn't repeat the request, and he made<br />
it perfectly clear that he didn't expect to get It.<br />
So I mean, heavens above, you've been around here<br />
for enough Premiers Conferences to know that what<br />
they try and do is have an unhappy outcome so that<br />
they can justify tax Increases. I mean It wouldn't<br />
be the first time Wlally ( Brown) that this has been<br />
tried. And some of them are nice enough to get home<br />
first before they announce it, but they've obviously<br />
decided a new little trick to announce it here<br />
before they leave.<br />
PM: Can I just say that Premier Greiner said in his<br />
opening remarks that these arrangements are the best<br />
arrangements we've had for the five years he'd been<br />
coming, a lot better than they have historically<br />
been. And I don't think he came with any real<br />
expectation of walking away with a fair dinkum<br />
inquiry Into fiscal equalisation or walking away<br />
with anything better then the of fer document. But<br />
he did on both accounts.<br />
J: Just on the labour market, Mr Keating in your<br />
comments you mentioned that the growth in the<br />
unemployment was yet to impact on the job market,<br />
end your comments, Mr Dawkins, you said that the<br />
growth in output was more likely to be transformed<br />
in higher productivity rather than higher job<br />
growth. That's quite a bleak assessment, does that<br />
suggest we are going to have the sorts of<br />
unemployment rates of 10.5 per cent for a lot longer<br />
than is implied by the present forecasts? </p>
<p>T: No, it's only making the obvious point that there is<br />
a trade off between productivity growth and<br />
employment growth and as a result of the fact that<br />
the economy has been through a restructuring, the<br />
fact that there is a fair bit of unutilised capacity<br />
out there, Is only making the point that we're<br />
likely to see In the first instance as the economy<br />
picks up, as demand increases, that that demand will<br />
be satisfied in the first instance by an Increase in<br />
output without a commensurate increase In jobs. But<br />
as the economy picks up more rapidly and during the<br />
Course of the next twelve months we will see job<br />
growth. I'm not saying there will be no job growth,<br />
I'm not saying that we're stuck with these levels of<br />
unemployment* I was making an historical comparison<br />
between this period in the cycle and say a similar<br />
period in the cycle nine years ago, when you saw a<br />
much more rapid growth in the economy than we are<br />
now anticipating, and also a very much more rapid<br />
growth in employment growth.<br />
So I was only saying that it's rather different this<br />
time than it was last time.<br />
J: Under that scenario does It mean that it's going to<br />
be much harder to drag down the unemployment rate<br />
from say 10.6 where it is now to even<br />
T: The ether point to bear In mind, that to the extent<br />
that the economy becomes Increasingly export<br />
orientated and this Is a point that I've been making<br />
Increasingly, the labour market Is only dependent on<br />
what happens within the domestic economy, but it<br />
depends on us getting a larger share of the world<br />
economy as well. if you've watched, as I'm sure you<br />
have because you are a diligent chap, if you've<br />
watched what's happened in terms of manufacturing<br />
exports you've seen that there's been an inexorable<br />
increase in manufacturing exports over the last ten<br />
years, an increase which we think will increase and<br />
we will do whatever we can to ensure that it does<br />
increase. And when I'm saying is that I'm<br />
emphasising the importance of policy which directs<br />
itself towards those particular areas of the economy<br />
and in ways which can Improve job growth, that's one<br />
of the things which I'm talking about.<br />
PM: And of course as the economy picks up and more<br />
confidence comes in people might hire more people.<br />
That Is, that as the recovery cornes through the<br />
employment is not lineal but sinusoidal, parabolic.<br />
J: Mr Keating, this morning you mentioned a training<br />
wage being Introduced, I'm wondering how you see<br />
that wage actually working.<br />
PM: That's all for another press conference. </p>
<p>14<br />
J: Mr Keating, the Issue of APEC, Washington has made<br />
It pretty clear that the idea of a summit is<br />
premature.<br />
PM; I don't think that that's right because the terms of<br />
the letters from President Bush to me have been most<br />
supportive of the proposal. But the US and<br />
Australia are basically on the one wave length an<br />
this, but the letter which the President sent to me<br />
was most supportive of It. Whether anyone's miffed<br />
in the State Department, I don't know, but certainly<br />
the administration I think they would regard It as a<br />
good advance. But they see difficulty in doing it<br />
themselves or doing it alone.<br />
J: So when do you think the first Summit might be?<br />
PM: That's not for me to say. it's never been a matter<br />
of urgency, never. We've never put a time table on<br />
it, I've said that often.<br />
