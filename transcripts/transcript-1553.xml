ASIAN TOUR 1967 KOREA<br />
SPEECH GIVEN SY THE PRIME MINISTER, MA. HAROLD HOLT,<br />
ON THE OCCASION OF THE CONFERMENT OF HONORARY DOCTORATE OF LAWS,<br />
SEOUL UNIVERSITY<br />
vr i * i 7TH APRIL, 1967.<br />
Mr. President Choe, Mr. Dean, Mr. Prime Minister, distinguished<br />
members of the Faculty of Seoul National University, students<br />
of the National University and ladies and gentlemen.<br />
This is a very proud moment in my life. The privilege<br />
which you have accorded me is a great honour. I regard it as a<br />
great honour because I know that in this National University of<br />
Seoul Honorary Doctorates are not accorded lightly. It is a<br />
tribute which I accept not merely for myself but for my country<br />
and in the spirit of frierdship which inspires it. It is more<br />
than 36 years ago that I gained my own degree, quite a modest<br />
degree of Bachelor of Laws, in the University of Melbourne. I<br />
have had to wait those 36 years to receive this very much higher<br />
distinction which I like to feel, although it may not have been<br />
gained in the academic sphere, has been accorded for service in<br />
the University of Life. ' e live toether regardless of the<br />
country from which we come in one of the most interesting and<br />
exciting phases in human history, and nowhere is the process of<br />
turbulence and change a challenge more evident than in the region<br />
of Asia which yve inhauit together.<br />
It is an exciting era because although it is a period<br />
of restlessness and change, although it is full of challenge, it is<br />
also an era full of opportunity and hope to the better world for<br />
which we all aspire.<br />
Mankind has learned through the processes of science<br />
through education, through his relations one with the other, that<br />
the age-old enemies of man, illiteracy, disease, poverty, insecurity,<br />
economic instability, these enemies can b-conquered.<br />
There are some fortunate countries in the world in which<br />
they have been largely conquered and in other countries there is the<br />
expectation that these things can be accomplished.<br />
When the leaders of the nations meeting at Manila last<br />
year were holding their discussions together, their thoughts were<br />
not merely on military matters even though they were, to a very<br />
significant degree, involved in military operations in relation<br />
to issues of far reaching consequences. Issues which went as<br />
deep as the challenge to the security and freedom of your own<br />
people and your own country back in those dark days of the 1950' s.<br />
But while we turned our thoughts to the problems of<br />
how security could be brought to this area we also had a version<br />
of the better world to which we could ill contribute.<br />
This is a world in which these enemies are defeated<br />
and in which people could live in freedom, in social security with<br />
justice liberty and freedom for individuals and for democratic<br />
institutions. Now in this era, we strive for these things.<br />
This is an era in which man with his enterprise and<br />
irrepressible spirit is prooin the mysteries of the universe, of<br />
the shores of outer space and Zhe depths of the sea, and is seeing<br />
new developments in industry, agriculture, science and in education. / 2 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
The young people, those who ar'e coming throuh their process<br />
of education, have a tremendous contribution to make. There is<br />
evidence throughout the world, a phenomenon not restricted to any<br />
one country, that there is a sense of urgency on the part of young<br />
people to learn more about the world in which they live, to make<br />
a greater contribution to the betterment of their fellow men.<br />
We who have the responsioility for Jovernment must<br />
recognise these things, they create great responsibilities for<br />
jovernment and great problems. They create immediate and difficult<br />
complex problems for Ministers of Education and, indeed speaking<br />
as a Minister of Finance for seven years, reat difficulties for<br />
Ministers of Finance. But they are problems which we are meeting<br />
and which -ve must continue to meet to give a better world to the<br />
rising generation and those who aspire to freedom and a better<br />
world, in whatever country they are to oe found.<br />
The opportunities for making the most of these talents<br />
and resources; perhaps older men like myself can dream of a world<br />
in which these things have been at some point of time achieved.<br />
Perhaps it will oe the good fortune of those young peoole I see<br />
in this audience today, to find them realised within their own<br />
lifetime.<br />
you are exprTeshsaitn gw iflrlo mje a mgy refoant d inhospteit uatrido, n byo f thleisa rncienregm, onay trtoibduayt, e<br />
to those who have the responsibility of making the laws which can<br />
fashion a oetter order for the world of the future.<br />
I do prize the distinction which you have conferred upon<br />
me and, in so far as it lies within my power, I shall do , wthat I can<br />

at peace that is progressing, tlit is prosperous and is secure the<br />
liberty and the sense of security of all people who are of gooA will<br />
throughout the world.<br />
I thank you Mr. President and your colleagues. I thank<br />
you, Mr. Prime Minister, for the generous things you have found<br />
yourself able to say to me. It is to me a pleasing thing that the<br />
researchers of the University have delved into some of my earlier<br />
performances. I hope that my performances of the future will be<br />
worthy of the honour they have bestowed upon me. </p>
