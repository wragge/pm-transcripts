PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR PRESS 23 AUGUST 1977<br />
CONDOLENCE MOTION MR. R. CONNOR HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES<br />
I move<br />
" That this Hous-e expresses its deep regret at the death, on<br />
22 August 1977, of the Honourable Reginald Francis Xavier Connor,<br />
Member of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly 1950-1976,<br />
Member of this House for the Division of Cunningham from 1962<br />
and a Minister of the Crown from 1972 to 1975; places on record<br />
its appreciation of his long and meritorious public service; and<br />
tenders its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement."<br />
It is my sad task to speak today of,* the death of one of the best<br />
known Members of this House, the Honourable Member for Cunningham,<br />
Rex Connor. Rex Connor was the son of a waterside worker from the<br />
city of Wollongong, a city which he was to serve faithfully<br />
throughout his life.<br />
He was Dux of Wollongong High School, and subsequently qualified<br />
as a solicitor by working in a solicitor's office and studying<br />
part-time for the Solicitors Admission Board Course. He had a<br />
long and notable record of public service.* For six years he<br />
was a member of the Wollongong City Council. In 1950 he was<br />
elected to the New South Wales Legislative Assembly seat of<br />
Wollongong-Kenibla which he held continuously until 1963 when he<br />
resigned to stand for Federal Parliament. He won the seat of<br />
Cunningham at the 1963 General Election and retained it until<br />
his death in Canberra yesterday.<br />
From December 1972 to October 1975 Mr. Connor was Minister for<br />
Minerals and Energy,. and on two occasions during that period<br />
he served as acting Prime Minister of Australia. 1<br />
Rex Connor had a great capacity for work. He enjoyed wide<br />
support in his electorate and in his party. He was assiduous<br />
in looking after the affairs of his electorate. Doubtless<br />
they recognised him as a committed nationalist, a committed<br />
socialist, a lifelong enthusiast for the Labor cause in which<br />
he so fervently believed. / His </p>
<p>2<br />
His primary interest, particularly in more recent years, was<br />
Australia's energy resources. His policies on this issue were<br />
quite distinctive and controversial. As a Minister, he was<br />
unremitting in his determination to bring those policies to<br />
reality. While many disputed the wisdom of his minerals and<br />
energy programme, none doubted for a moment the strength or<br />
sincerity in which he held and espoused his views. Indeed, he<br />
has almost passed a word into Australian language " Connorism".<br />
Whether or not one agrees with the sentiment which underlies<br />
that term, it is a mark of the impact that Rex Connor had on<br />
this House and in the wider international community. I found<br />
on my recent overseas trip that there are many overseas who<br />
still remember him.<br />
Rex Connor exhibited at all times since he joined this House<br />
complete loyalty to his party and to his leader. When he was<br />
in difficulty he made no attempt to clear himself at the<br />
expense of others. That of itself indicates an uncommon<br />
degree of dedication and commitment.<br />
Our late colleague was a significant Member of this House.<br />
All Members were ever conscious of his presence. He will<br />
be sadly missed. I am sure I speak for all of us when I say<br />
to his sons and grandchildren that we offer them our deep<br />
sympathy in their loss.<br />
Finally, Mr. Speaker, I think I should add that Mr. Connor<br />
must himself have been deeply saddened in recent times, for<br />
his own wife died only last April. 0 </p>
