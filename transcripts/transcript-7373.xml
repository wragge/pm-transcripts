PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 12 AUGUST 1988<br />
The Minister for Resources, Senator Cook and the ministerF<br />
for Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories, R<br />
Senator Richardson, will visit Tasmania next Thursday nl<br />
18 August to carry forward the consultations I initiated<br />
yesterday on Tasmanian forestry and conservation issues. T<br />
The Ministers will meet the State Government, the Labor 0<br />
opposition, employers and the trade union movement. t<br />
An agenda of issues for discussion with the Tasmanian<br />
Government is being developed by the two Governments.<br />
The consultations with the various parties are aimed at<br />
achieving the best possible arrangements for creating jobs<br />
through the industry assistance and restructuring package,<br />
by making alternative forest resources available and through<br />
new investments in the forest industries.<br />
Commonwealth officials stand-ready at any time to discuss<br />
these issues with their Tasmanian State counterparts, in<br />
preparation for next Thursday's meetings.<br />
I will be holding a further meeting with Premier Gray soon<br />
after next Thursday's consultations by my ministers.<br />
