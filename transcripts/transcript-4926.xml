, AUSTRAL1A<br />
FOR PRESS 14 DECEMBER 1978<br />
NATIONAL WAGE CASE INQUIRY<br />
The Prime Minister is writing to Premiers to seek their urgent<br />
cooperation in the exmination of ways and means of achieving<br />
consistency between the wage fixation processes and economic<br />
objectives. He said that he believed that the State Governments would<br />
see this objective was essential in order to enable the economic<br />
problems confronting the Australian community to be resolved<br />
effectively. Resolution of these problems was critical for<br />
those who are seeking work now and those who will be seeking<br />
work in the future.<br />
Wage fixation processes involve both State and Commonwealth<br />
Governments. The Prime Minister said that he was firmly of<br />
the view that all Governments share the responsibility<br />
to achieving the maximum possible consistency in wage policy.<br />
The alternative was to open the way again to " leap-frogging"<br />
in wages and related benefits, which could in turn lead only to<br />
spiralling labour costs and reduced job opportunities.<br />
The social and economic costs of such an outcome would be totally<br />
unacceptable to the Commonwealth Government.<br />
The Prime Minister said that the Commonwealth Government was<br />
particularly mindful that the Conciliation and Arbitration<br />
Commission, in its national wage decision on Tuesday, said that<br />
there is mounting pressure for wage increases outside the wage<br />
indexation guidelines. The Commonwealth Government shares the<br />
Commission's concern at these developments and will continue<br />
to take such actions as are within its power to ensure that<br />
those pressures are not successful. The Prime Minister said<br />
he believed that the State Governments also recognised the<br />
dangers of these pressures and he would be urging them to act<br />
accordingly within the framework of their own powers.<br />
The timetable the Commonwealth Government was setting for the<br />
examination of ways and means of achieving consistency between<br />
wage fixation processes and economic objectives was a tight one,<br />
in keeping with the importance of the matter, and he expected<br />
it to be completed by the end of January 1979. The examination<br />
would involve issues which would need to be taken up with the<br />
States, and he was asking each of the Premiers to nominate an<br />
officer whom his officers could contact.<br />
The Prime Minister said that he believed the Premiers would appreciate<br />
the importance of this matter for the well-being of the Australian<br />
community, and he hoped that they would, accordingly, cooperate<br />
with the Commonwealth. </p>
