6 December 1974<br />
PAPUA NEW GUINEA TRANSFER OF POWERS<br />
The Prime Minister, Mr Whitlam, said this<br />
evening that the Australian Government welcomed the<br />
initiative of the Papua New Guinea Government in requesting<br />
that authority over defence and foreign relations, the<br />
Papua New Guinea Supreme Court and other leqal matters<br />
be transferred' to Papua New Guinea as soon as practicable.<br />
Mr Whitlam said that such a transfer was in<br />
accordance with long-standing Australian policy which was<br />
to enable Papua New Guinea to exercise final authority in<br />
all matters of government before the formal step to<br />
independence. The existing close consultations on major<br />
foreign policy and defence matters would continue.<br />
Mr Whitlam said that the transfer of authority<br />
over the defence and foreign relations functions in the<br />
period to independence would necessarily be subject to<br />
Australia's continuing international and treaty obligations<br />
including its obligations to the United Nations under the<br />
Trusteeship Agreement and the Charter, and the Papua New<br />
Guinea Government had agreed to this. However, the transfer<br />
to Papua New Guinea of these matters would enable the<br />
Papua New Guinea Government to give effect to its own<br />
policies and priorities which it was already determining.<br />
Mr Whitlam said that Australia, by legislation<br />
at present before the Senate, was preparing itself to be<br />
able to transfer these matters and he was confident that<br />
the administrative and legislative details regarding the<br />
transfers could be settled in time to meet Papua New Guinea's<br />
requests. CANBERRA. A. C. T. </p>
