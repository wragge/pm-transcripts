    <content><![CDATA[<p>EMBARGO: 9.30 P. M. ON SUNDAY 19 OCTOBER 1969<br />" THIS WEEK"<br />TELEVISION INTERVIEW GIVEN BY THE<br />PRIME MINISTER, MR. JOHN GORTON, ON<br />CHANNEL 7, MELBOURNE<br />Recorded on 16 October for release on 19 October<br />Interviewers: John Boland and John Fitzgerald<br />Q. Prime Minister, what is your reaction to the latest<br />Gallup Poll figures favouring Labor?<br />PM. Well, one is always much happier when the Gallup<br />Polls are running in one's favour than when they are running against<br />one, and at the momen?, the Gallup Polls are running against one.<br />They are usually accurate within two or three per cent, and therefore<br />one is much happier. We can't detect it in the electorates, but<br />nevertheless, it is there, and it would be silly to pretend one was<br />happy about the way they are running.<br />Q. Did you expect it to be as big as it has been in the last<br />I think something like 7 per cent....<br />PM. No, I don't I can't imagine actually what is<br />the basis of the poll. I didn't expect it. The people in the electorates<br />don't seem to sense it but there it as a poll, and it would be much<br />nicer if it were going the other way. I didn't believe them when they<br />went our way completely, bur, 2ill, it is much pleasanter when they<br />do. The major thing is to D f what h: ppens on the<br />Q. Prime M?'. lster. one gets the impression, reading the<br />reaction, particularly news-aper reaction that the Prime Minister is<br />almost on the floor and everybody is standing around waiting for him<br />to get up again after the 3allup Poll. Now, are you on the floor?<br />PM. Well, I don't think so. We have had a couple of good<br />meetings in Adelaide and Hobart.....<br />Q. You would always d-aw as Prime Minister, though,<br />wouldn't you? You would always draw the crowd?<br />PM. Not necessarily the kind when I say a good meeting,<br />I don't mean a large meeting. I mean a meeting at which people<br />sought to put one on the floor, and instead, I think, were put on the<br />floor themselves; the kind of Labor Party supporters who came along<br />to try and shout you down, to try and prevent our arguments being<br />heard. This is what I mean..... / 2</p>
<p>r*</p>
<p>Q. What type of meeting do you prefer? Do you prefer<br />one where you have a number of interjectors?<br />PM. On the whole, yes, I do. I think it is much nicer to<br />have something to fight against than a whole hall full of people who<br />either agree with you or don't say anything at all. I don't mean the<br />sort of organised stamping and shouting and chanting that goes<br />although I don't mind that in the very least. It is an indication of<br />the approach of the Opposition. But I do mean that there needs to be<br />a liveliness in a meeting, I think.<br />Q. You raised this point. Were you disappointed with<br />the " yes" type of crowd which listened to your policy speech on<br />television? What did you think of your policy speech on television?<br />It has been criticised.<br />PM, I thought it was all right myself and there have been<br />good reports about it. The only reason we had anybody in the studio<br />at the time was because I like to talk to people. I like to have some<br />people in front of me to talk to, to look at, to move one's eyes round<br />about. I thought I made that quite clear at the outset of the policy<br />speech. This was a studio speech. There were a few people there.<br />I wanted them there because I like some human contacts to talk to<br />rather than just a television camera which is pretty inhuman when<br />you look at it.<br />Q. Now, Sir, I wonder if we can get down to the crux of<br />your policy. I think you have made and foreign affairs the<br />two keys in your whole policy,<br />PM. Yes.<br />Q. Now, a lot are saying that you have bowed to DLP<br />pressure here. What is your answer to this?<br />PM. I'd like people to look at the record to see whether....<br />to make their own minds up. This is what they are supposed to do in<br />an election. But if they do look at the record, they will see that the<br />first speech made by the Governor-General when we became a<br />Government said that we felt we needed to build up our defences,<br />that we would be spending more each year on our defences not<br />necessarily in terms of GNP but in terms of money. This is on<br />record. This is what we sa-id, I have made it clear on a number of<br />occasions in the House in reply to questions that we felt it was<br />essential to retain National Service Training. I made it clear that<br />we are not going to sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty until<br />we are sure it does not damage Australia's future security. I have<br />made it clear we believe it right and proper to continue with joint<br />defence arrangements and bases with the United States in Australia.<br />All these things are on the record for a long time back. / 3</p>
<p>* I.<br />J7 2 k I<br />i L<br />r I<br />i<br />i i</p>
<p>Q. You certainly have brought the DLP more around to<br />your way of thinking, since you have decided to make this they key<br />to your whole policy.<br />PM. I thought you were asking had something been done<br />especially as a result of DLP suggestions, and all these things are<br />on the record as having been done long ago. There are only two<br />things which could lend any colour to this at all. One is the beginning<br />of a base in Western Australia, a naval base in Western Australia.....<br />Q. Which is what they wanted. They wanted that, didn't<br />they?<br />PM. Of course they wanted that. And we had started<br />investigations into that two years ago. We put Maunsell Partners<br />on to report how the thing should be gradually built up, and it is going<br />to be gradually built up. We had the report from them. I had been<br />questioned in the House as to whether we had turned it down. I had<br />said quite definitely we hadn't, and it is the beginning of something<br />which I think Australian defence needs. It wasn't suddenly brought<br />out of a hat. For more than two years we have been considering this.<br />So there it is. You asked me a question. That is the answer I give you.<br />Q. Well, now what about your attitude to the Soviet<br />presence in the Indian Ocean? Now, the interpretation is that you<br />changed your tack here,<br />PM. I think the interpretation is wrong. If you look at<br />what Mr. Freeth said, there was never any suggestion in it for one<br />minute that we wanted to have or would have or would contemplate<br />any military alliance with the Soviet Union, or that we would want<br />Soviet Union bases there or that we would want the Soviet Union<br />military presence there. Never any suggestion of any kind.<br />Q. He said: " It is natural that a world power, such as<br />the Soviet, should seek to promote a presence and a national influence<br />in the Indian Ocean". Now how else could they do that?<br />PM. They could d by assisting in the economic<br />rehabilitation of those nations in building them up. They could<br />do it, for example, in the case of the Soviet Union by renegotiating<br />the debts which Indonesia, for example, owes them, and giving<br />Indonesia a chance to build up its own economy instead of having to<br />drain off to the Soviet Union for war material which they bought in<br />the days of Sukarno. This is one way they could go about it.<br />Q. And is this the sort of thing which we could have<br />practical dealings with them in? / 4</p>
<p>-4<br />Pm. We would be happy to see a situation in which steps<br />were taken, as long as there were not a lot of technicians involved<br />in going into the country or a lot of so-called experts or military<br />people going in, in which take that Indonesian example in<br />which the Indonesian economy was helped as a result of a renegotiation<br />of the foreign exchange which had to be paid by Indonesia.<br />Q. Well now, Mr. Prime Minister, let me lay it straight<br />on the line. Weren't we in fact, with the Freeth statement,' following<br />the American lead in announcing our willingness to get along with the<br />Russians? Didn't Secretary of State Rogers ask that we do this?<br />Pm. I don't remember Secretary of State Rogers asking me<br />to do this. When you say " get along with the Russians" this is quite<br />a different thing from wanting to have a Russian military presence in<br />our own area. Surely it is. Clearly we have things on which we must<br />talk to the Russians. We have things like fisheries agreements for<br />example, which are quite important. We have things to do with trade.<br />We have things to do with civil aviation. This is not to be interpreted<br />as wanting to have a military presence. I think that the Freeth<br />statement was misinterpreted.<br />Q. Isn't it State Department policy that the only way we<br />can get extricated out of Vietnam is to use the Russians to put<br />pressure on Hanoi, and the only way we can prevent insurrections<br />in South East Asia is to have a Russian presence in South East Asia?<br />Pm. I don't believe it is for a moment. I don't believe the<br />United States wants to have a Russian presence, if by that you mean<br />a military presence in South East Asia. If they did, I believe that a<br />Russian military presence there would be against our interests and<br />dangerous to us. Now, Prime Minister, linked dramatically with our<br />defence pol icy i s t he F-ill1. Now, ca n it be sa id beyond all doubt<br />we are finally committed to this aircraft?<br />Pm. As long as the latest tests on the new wing boxes or<br />modified wing boxes show that it will give the length of service which<br />we require it to have. The interesting thing on this F 1i and indeed<br />our whole defence policy is that we have a policy and our opponents<br />don't. Perhaps they do. Their policy is to alienate our allies, to cut<br />our Army and to deny our Air Force the strike aircraft which our Air<br />Force and our military advisers say they want to have. Now if our<br />Air Force says this is the best strike aircraft in the world, this is<br />what Australian defence needs, surely that should be taken some<br />notice of rather than vague suggestions that some other aircraft not<br />recommended should be obtained by Australia.</p>
<p>6-<br />PM. I don't believe there is. I don't believe there is anything<br />in it. The United Kingdom makes up its own mind as to where it should<br />be and it decided that for reasons of its own it should withdraw<br />Q. But did Mr. Healey put a $ 50 million fee on staying?<br />Pm. No, he didn't. Never, ever. It has never been<br />suggested.<br />Q. Finally, Prime Minister, on defence. Is Cockburn<br />Sound now a firm plank of your Government's policy?<br />Pm. Yes, it is. We are going to build it up gradually.<br />We are taking the first step of a number of phases recommended by<br />our consultants and that is the building of the causeway. And gradually<br />we will be building up the other requirements for naval facilities so<br />that there can be as our fleet grows in the years ahead as it will,<br />some elements of that fleet based in that area.<br />Well, now getting around to your personal image,<br />Prime Minister. Mr. St. John has campaigned against your<br />credibility and the personal conduct of your office. Now what do<br />you say in reply to him? Are you prepared to reply to him?<br />PM. I don't think so. Anybody can make any allegations<br />against anybody else. I understand the shipping line, for example,<br />was supposed to have been brought in without consultation with<br />Cabinet, and yet all Cabinet knows there were at least four meetings<br />on it. This theory of dictatorship and so on, I think, is refuted by<br />some suggestion that was made to me in Launceston the other day<br />that I was overruled in some other matters. I believe that there are<br />other reasons why Mr. St. John is conducting this campaign. But<br />something that decides the future of Australia and the conduct of a<br />government of Australia seems to me to be something that ought to<br />be decided on the policies put before the people and the good or ill<br />of those policies for the future of Australia.<br />Q. Except that you have campaigned on a personal image.<br />The Gorton image has become something in this country.<br />Pm. I haven't campaigned on a personal image. I have<br />campaigned on ideas. I have campaigned on achievements and the<br />achievements have been pretty considerable. I don't believe I<br />campaign on a personal image at all. It wasn't a personal image<br />that led us into the entry into overseas shipping. It wasn't a personal<br />image that led us into doing more for social welfare than has been<br />done by any other government in a comparable period of time.<br />These were things one wanted to get accomplished. I could go on<br />with the list but you haven't got the time for it.</p>
<p>7<br />Q. What about the appointment of a public relations<br />officer to your secretariat?<br />PM. I haven't appointed a public relations officer<br />Q. Your secretariat has.<br />PM. No, it hasn't.<br />Q. Well the Liberal Party has.<br />PM. No, it ha sn't.<br />Q. Well who has?<br />PM. Nobody has.<br />Q. But he is working there.<br />PM. There is a man who has been lent to do research and<br />background notes for speeches for a fortnight and this is riot in any<br />way at all anything to do with a public relations..<br />Q. But it is on the basis of your personal association<br />with a PR man.<br />PM. It's not on the basis oh, you mean because Eric<br />White is a friend of mine and said, " Would you like somebody to do<br />speech notes or research for you?" and I said, " Yes. All right,<br />but it is not doing public relations work.<br />Q. Well the interpretation has been that the Prime<br />Minister is<br />PM. Oh, I can't help the interpretation. He is doing no<br />public relations work.<br />Q. He is not trying to swing the country in ten days to<br />follow the Prime Minister at the poll?<br />Pm. No, he is trying to help me in the same way that, for<br />example, Mr. Whitlam's large staff which I haven't got helps him.<br />You see, I have never delivered a speech that I haven't written myself.<br />I doubt very much if Mr. Whitlam has ever delivered a speech he<br />wrote himself. I need some research assistance, some background<br />speech notes and this is what this man is doing and that is all he is<br />doing. / 8</p>
<p>-8<br />Q. Returning now to points on your policy. I think since<br />you have become Prime Minister, you have been very keen to express<br />concern about the middle and lower income groups. Now particularly<br />from the point of view of taxation, you have made promises that over<br />three years there will be some relief for middle income earners. But<br />I think or do you feel there has been a certain amount of<br />disappointment that you haven't been able to offer anything immediately<br />to these middle income earners and that you are going to wait until<br />the end of this financial year which is July 1st.<br />Pm. I don't know whether there has been any disappointment<br />or not. I don't know whether people would have expected us in present<br />circumstances to make some large step to introduce a whole lot more<br />of purchasing power, a whole lot more of money into the economy. I<br />don't think any thinking person would expect or would have expected<br />that we should have taken the first steps before the next Budget. But<br />I would imagine and I would hope that the thinking Australian would<br />realise that we are going to take these steps over this period to reduce<br />the burden of income tax on the lower income earner, the middle<br />income earner, the man with the family to bring up and the man paying<br />off his home. And that if we are to believe the suggestions put forward<br />by our opposition there would be no hope of doing this with any<br />effective benefit to the people so helped.<br />IQ, You don't think you can come in a bit earlier than the<br />end of the financial year?<br />PM. No, I don't. I think that the latest employment figures,<br />for example, show that our economy is fully employed at the present<br />moment; for the first time in Australia's history there are more jobs<br />offering than there are applications for employment. We have our<br />resources fully employed. Now don't you think, wouldn't any<br />reasonable person think in those circumstances, throwing more<br />money into the economy would riot provide any single person with<br />any more employment?<br />Q. I think, I think Prime Minister, if I get taxed, I<br />would like some sort of relief on this....<br />PM. Sure, but you wouldn't like to have immediate tax<br />relief with the result that inflation cut it out straight away. I don't<br />think.<br />Q. I'd like immediate relief<br />PM. PAM. s long as it didn't have the other aspect in it.</p>
<p>1~</p>
<p>9-<br />Q. On the social services question, now, this has been<br />something you have taken a considerable time over. There appears<br />to medical and hospital benefits.., your plans mean increased<br />weekly payments here. Also, of course, we had last Friday the<br />Hospital Benefits Association raising, even for the lowest family<br />unit, their fees from something like $ 37. 80 to $ 52. 20 a year.<br />PM. Are you talking about hospital alone or are you<br />talking about hospital and medical?<br />Q. I am talking about both. I would like to bracket them<br />both if I can in the period of time. For this increased medical help<br />which you are suggesting, the obv'ous thing here is that you have to<br />pay more to get it. Now where is the relief here?<br />PM. Where is the relief? Well there aire two alternate<br />plans that are placed before the public at this election. Let's take<br />the State of Victoria because we are speaking in Victoria. Yes, a<br />person would have to pay more in order to get.. pay more for<br />their medical table in order to get the medical benefits which we<br />offer, but we have taken care of all families who have incomes of<br />$ 39 a week or less. Now, in Victoria, it would cost to get public<br />ward cover and to get the medical facilities that are offered, it<br />would cost a single man m--ore im -diately he reaches a wage of<br />under the Labor scheme. It would cost under the Labor scheme<br />more for $ 40 and above for a single man. For families a Labor<br />scheme would cost more for families earning between $ 60 and<br />I can't tell you exactly where between there but somewhere between<br />and $ 70. It would cost them More. It is not a question of have<br />people got to pay more because the Opposition's plans are going to<br />tae 4per cent not of the tax at present paid but of the total taxable<br />income compulsorily. That is going to raquire people to pay more.<br />That is going to require people to pax! more than our scheme requires.<br />But the great benefit of our scheme as I see it is that it will have<br />the AMA co-operating with it, whereas they won't with the Labor<br />scheme and you may remember back in 1949 when Labor tried to<br />bring in a scheme and the doctors wouldn't co-operate with it.<br />it will have the doctors' co-operation with it people<br />contributing to it will know that they will be relieved from the fear<br />of very expensive illness, because however expensive it may be,<br />the medical fet-s will not require them to pay more than<br />Q. Have you been assured of AMA co-operation?<br />PM. The Minister for Health has been assured of AMA<br />co-operation in this line. The proposal is that there should be a<br />common fee known and that the policy of the AMA is that that common<br />fee should be told to any patient who asks, and the patient if he wants<br />to choose a doctor who charges more will have to bear the extra<br />himself. But he can get this treatment at a common fee, and</p>
<p>10<br />statistics show that more than half the doctors charge the common<br />fee or less already. This is quite different from Whitlam's<br />commonly-charged fee. This is going to be a common fee known<br />to people and publicised by the Commonwealth Health Department<br />so everybody knows what it is.<br />Q. Well, you reject Labor's argument that you will have<br />to shop around for a fee that is acceptable?<br />Pm. Yes, I think that that is a spurious argument. I suppose<br />it is based on this that if a patient went to a doctor and said, " Are<br />you going to charge the common fee which I know to be the common<br />fee because it has been made public" and the doctor said, " No, I am<br />going to charge more", you don't take that doctor. I suppose that is<br />what this is based on. But of course the alternative is the<br />nationalisation of medicine which, of course, is what Labor is after.<br />Q. Prime Minister, I would very quickly like to turn to<br />education and ask you two questions here now. On your State aid<br />proposals, and the Government's proposals, it would seem that the<br />richer schools are getting richer and the poorer schools are getting<br />poorer. Now there is a comparison here with Mr. Whitlam's<br />promises, of course, of a schools commission. That is the first<br />part of the question. The second part of the question is: What do<br />you feel or what do you think is against Mr. Whitlam's $ 12 million<br />proposal for free universities?<br />PM. Well, the first part of the question you asked me is<br />a proposition put forward by the Opposition to set up a central<br />commission in Canberra to examine the needs of 10, 000 schools<br />throughout Australia. Our proposition, on the other hand, is already<br />in train, in which each State Education Department is examining the<br />needs of the schools within its own State, and we think that is a better<br />way to go about it. That is already in train. And they are not only<br />examining the needs of the State schools but also co-ordinating into<br />it the needs of the independent schools. People sometimes call me<br />a centralist, but if there is anything I could see designed to take<br />completely out of the control of the States the running of the education<br />system, then this schools commission, so called, would be the one<br />designed to do it.<br />Don't you feel, though, that with this schools like<br />Wesley, Xavier, these schools that don't really need grants and<br />money are getting a lot of money</p>
<p>11-<br />PM, They don't get the grants. Who gets the grants are<br />the parents who send children to schools. Now there are a lot of<br />parents who want to send their children to a particular school and<br />who are not rich people. But who for reasons of their own, and they<br />are entitled to have these reasons, scrape and save and deny<br />themselves other things in order to pay school fees. I don't see<br />why those people should have a means test put upon them which<br />is what in fact is inherent in the suggestion you made.<br />Q. Free universities. Can we afford them? Can your<br />Government afford them?<br />PM. Yes, I think you could afford free universities. At<br />the moment it would cost $ 14 million a year from your pocket. You<br />wanted some relief from taxation. It would cost that much or a part<br />of that much extra out of your pocket for the extra taxation. But why<br />should you pay it? We seek to reduce the burden of taxation, not to<br />increase it for this purpose and we have got to remember that some<br />per cent, around 25 per cent of all the university students have<br />their fees paid by you and other taxpayers anyway. Now I don't<br />really see why the ordinary taxpayer who has say his own children<br />to bring up, his own house to pay off should be charged extra in order<br />to provide for those who can't get Commonwealth scholarships. It<br />is a matter of where you levy your imposts and for what purposes.<br />Thank you Prime Minister.</p>
