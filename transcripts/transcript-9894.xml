TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
PRESS CONFERENCE, PRESIDENTIAL PALACE, JAKARTA, 18 DECEMBER<br />

E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
PM. Well this agreement we have signed today, I think, will help set the<br />
environment for the region well into the next century. I said to you earlier<br />
today that Australia was around at the founding of the Indonesian State as we<br />
know it today. We have supported Indonesia against the Dutch at the end of<br />
the Second World War and we were justifiably proud in our role in the<br />
independence movement here in Indonesia.<br />
In the years since, of course, Indonesia has become a much more prosperous<br />
country, there has been a very large increase in wealth, it has been quite<br />
evenly distributed and it has now an economnic significance as well as a social<br />
significance of its size that bears upon the region and on the Asia Pacific in<br />
general. What we have achieved in these last few years is a measure of the<br />
cooperation between us which has begun at foreign policy level, in the<br />
relationship.-between the Foreign Minister Gareth Evans and Foreign Minister<br />
Alatas. And in the quite important and more comprehensive relations we are<br />
developing in defence cooperation between our Defence Ministers, in Robert<br />
Ray and his counterpart Mr Sudradjat, and tetvveen our Chiefs of thle Defence<br />
Forces, both of whomn are with us today, and those other operational officers<br />
in both of our services. Also, my colleague the Deputy Prime Minister, of<br />
course, was involved as Minister for Defence back in the 1980s.<br />
So I think we see what we have signed today, which is a historic agreement,<br />
as an extension of the cooperation that we have been able to develop<br />
between us and the fact that we recognise that key point and that is we are<br />
bound together by our geography, by our interest in a peaceful and secure<br />
region, by our quest for income growth and better standards of living, and by<br />
those very happy, shared memories of our history over time.<br />
The relationship has had its problems, but the fundamentals remain sound<br />
and important and that is that much of Australia's future is bound up in the<br />
future of Indonesia and vice versa. And, I think, that President Soeharto has </p>
<p>ftLL: 2<br />
shown his capacity to lead and take strategic directions for the benefit of his<br />
nation and for the region. And we have. joined him in this most obviously<br />
before this with APEC, where we have built, I think, a new political<br />
architecture in the Asia Pacific, which includes, of course, North America,<br />
Japan, China, Korea, the countries of ASEAN, and Australia and New<br />
Zealand and, of course, now some more.<br />
This has set up a whole frame of reference we have never had before, neither<br />
of us and, I think, now by recognising that each has a strategic interest in the<br />
other, that is that Australia has a strategic interest in the region and in the<br />
fortunes of this archipelago and that Indonesia has a strategic interest in us,<br />
in Australia, in our continent means that we are acknowledging the force of<br />
our geography and our shared history and the fact that we now live in one of<br />
the most peaceful parts of the world and we have the machinery in place to<br />
keep it that way.<br />
So more than anything else, I think, this agreement is a declaration of trust. It<br />
is a declaration of trust about the strategic intentions of each of us. So rather<br />
than us being privately, if you like, assuaged or comforted by a declaration by<br />
Indonesia about its territorial ambitions, of lack of them, and similar<br />
statements by ourselves to the same point, this cuts through all of that and<br />
gets to the fundamental point that there is a basis of trust between us and<br />
together we can do substantial things together. 200 million people here, or<br />
just on, in Indonesia. Our country, a large continent, rich in resources, strong<br />
in technology, strong basis in education. We are, together, capable of doing<br />
many good things. Not just in our two countries, but in third countries too.<br />
So this is more, I think, simply than an agreement about maintaining security.<br />
But, rather, it is about a declaration of trust between us which then goes<br />
beyond the official family into our communities.<br />
Now I would like to just say that I am very pleased that my colleagues could<br />
join me because each of them were party to our first discussions about this in<br />
the Security Committee of the Cabinet. And where we have seen the<br />
development of the relationship with Indonesia, as a logical extension of the<br />
growth of Australian foreign domestic policy abroad.<br />
I am also delighted that General Oration could be involved in the process as a<br />
former very distinguished Chief of the Defence Force. I think his relationship<br />
with Indonesia, the trust he built up here, the regard in which he is held was<br />
important to Australia and was important in this respect. And that general<br />
direction that he struck years ago is being followed now and developed<br />
further by General John Baker and, before him, Admiral Beaumont. And the<br />
three of these officers General Gration as a former Chief have, I think,<br />
reflected very substantially and well on Australia and on this relationship.<br />
I would like to also thank our Ambassador, Allan Taylor, who carried a lot of<br />
the work at this end with his usual skill and discretion and the fact that he is<br />
held in such regard, in this country, matters mightily to us.<br />

You have now got the full text of the agreement and you can see what it says.<br />
It has appropriate preambles and agreements on those key points and, I think,<br />
my last thanks but not least is to the Indonesian Government, especially<br />
President Soeharto who has had the imagination and the goodwill to agree to<br />
a proposal such as this and State Secretary Moerdiono who was involved in<br />
the nitty gritty and in some of the detail and never wavered from the strategic<br />
vision that he and the President had.<br />
In all, I think, an agreement such as this is unusual for the fact that it has<br />
been made outside of any other context as the Five Power Defence<br />
Agreement was made In another context, particularly with Britain withdrawing<br />
from Singapore and the region, in the context of the difficulties then<br />
experienced between Malaysia and Singapore and Indonesia. Australia's<br />
agreement with ANZUS, of course, comning from our long shared cultural links<br />
and our experience together in a number of theatres of war over the century.<br />
This is a contemporary agreement made for contemporary reasons, for the<br />
right reasons, and I think it is something which is going to add strength and<br />
value to both of our countries and that is going to bring a sense of security to<br />
the region that, I think, other members states of the region will share with us.<br />
So in all I feel very honoured to be involved, as I am sure my colleagues do,<br />
and we are very pleased at the reception we have been given in Indonesia<br />
and are very grateful for the hospitality.<br />
J: Mr Keating, you said earlier today that this agreement was delivered on a<br />
pledge you made in 1991. 1 am wondering how it rates, as four years as<br />
Prime Minister tomorrow, obviously it is the biggest achievement of your<br />
Prime Ministership?<br />
PM: Well it is not a matter or rating things, I don't think, Michael. But, rather, that it<br />
was one of the things I said at the time that I thought needed to be done.<br />
That is, not this exactly. But a general rapprochement with Indonesia given<br />
the fact that over the years, the relationship had gone off the boil, principally<br />
because of Timor, forgetting how great a stake Australia had had in<br />
Indonesia's independence. And, can I say, how proud the Labor Party had<br />
been in the growth of the independence movement and its succeS3 and that<br />
seemed to be forgotten. And, yet, the force of our circumstances, our<br />
geography, our shared interest in the region, were the things that promoted<br />
my colleagues continuing interest in it. But we needed to bring it into some<br />
-sort of logical statement about where we stood and, I think, this is what this is.<br />
J: I would like to ask on the Article 3, which says that it could be extended<br />
[ inaudible]. Is this any good if Indonesia is no longer a threat to Australia?<br />
Could you tell us whether there is any threat to this treaty in front of you now,<br />
thank you?<br />
PM:-It says that " the Parties agree to promote in accordance with the policies and<br />
priorities of each mutually beneficial cooperative activities in the security<br />
field in areas to be identified by the two Parties". Well, I mean, people have<br />
asked is this a military pact? No, it isn't. It is a security, agreement. It is </p>
<p>E L: 1. De c 11: 5 No . U06 PU4/ ' J<br />
4<br />
about security and bringing security to the region and that requires an<br />
ongoing assessment by both of us about the way in which the region is<br />
developing and what things are happening and, I think, all of the things we<br />
can see just let's take us the last six weeks the APEC Action Agenda being<br />
adopted in Osaka in fulfilment of the Bogor Declaration, which is one of the<br />
most important, I think, institutional things to happen in this region probably<br />
since the War. I noticed this week that ASEAN, for instance, has decided<br />
now to meet informally annually, very much in the manner of the APEC<br />
Leaders Meeting, to try and keep the process of change moving. All of these<br />
things have got to have a good bearing on security in the region, security in<br />
all of its facets. So this is not about identifying threats, or even preparing a<br />
response to threats, but saying that we need to be alert to what it is that<br />
makes the region more secure and act either singularly or jointly that is act<br />
in concert where we are agreed to upon consultation, which is I think what<br />
the essence of a security agreement should have.<br />
J: Prime Minister, Alexander Downer has put out a statement in Canberra<br />
reporting to reveal a private conversation with your Foreign Minister in which<br />
he alleges the Foreign Minister was concerned about the wording, referring to<br />
adverse challenges, rather than external challenges in the treaty. Could you<br />
respond to that claim, please, and also would you then care to go on and<br />
explain why that wording was used in contradistinction with the Five Power<br />
Agreement?<br />
PM: Well can I just say, I think, that the Foreign Minister is on the record making<br />
mention of this clause and, I think, we would say he is being verballed here by<br />
Mr Downer, who the day before I might remind you said that relations with<br />
Indonesia were at the worst in 13 years. This is the same Mr Downer who is<br />
reported today as saying he may give way to Senator Hill on the Foreign<br />
Affairs portfolio were they to win an election. He gave way on the leadership<br />
of the Liberal Party, he's now giving way on the Shadow Portfolio of Foreign<br />
Policy. To do the nation a real service, he would give away on his<br />
constituency, and let someone serious take it up. If not from our party, from<br />
their's. So,. I don't really think that given his standing, weight, record or the<br />
veracity of his claims that he is worthy of more time than I have given you,<br />
Glenn, on the answer.<br />
J: Could I just ask the same question again what does... ( inaudible) How do<br />
you understand this?<br />
PM: I'm sorry?<br />
J: What do you understand by adverse challenges?<br />
PM: Oh, yes. Well, I was more interested in dealing with Mr Downer than that<br />
point, not to forget the point. And that is that when one, I think, negotiates this<br />
sort of agreement, which is a big change for both countries, and especially,<br />
for Indonesia which has a non-aligned position so obviously and for so long<br />
that some of the phrases which might spring to mind in a country with our<br />
frame of reference, where our language and use of it is known well and for<br />
which we are comfortable in treaties and agreements of this variety, this is not </p>
<p>TEL: 19. Dec. 95 11: 57 No. 006 P. 015-/ u j<br />
necessarily true in Indonesia. And I think language like external threats is<br />
language that conjures up more than Indonesia wishes to state. I don't think it<br />
wants to say it's threatened, or even to seek to identify threats. So, the<br />
expression " adverse challenges" fits nicely with the general conception of the<br />
agreement, but doesn't jar with the agreement requiring of them some<br />
nomination of a threat. So, again, I think because these words don't reflect,<br />
say, words in the Five Power Defence Agreement written in another age and<br />
another time, or in other harder military arrangements we have with, say, the<br />
United States, is not to say they don't adequately reflect the sense of what we<br />
are seeking to do here.<br />
J: Mr Keating, is that a concession on the part of the Australian<br />
negotiators.. ( inaudible)...?<br />
PM: It's not really concessions. I mean, I don't think any of us have seen many of<br />
these things that is, the paragraphs or phrases as concessions. Rather,<br />
you start off from essentially a clean sheet of paper saying. ' look, we want to<br />
say more than we have been saying to one another, we want to say<br />
something that we can do in both of our names for the region, and which can<br />
be made sense of in the region". And what we have is what you have in front<br />
of you. And Indonesia has sensibilities in this, sensitivities in it, as we do.<br />
And the best if you like graft of those, is in the agreement.<br />
J: Mr Keating, you sent a very very top level delegation to Indonesia to sign this<br />
treaty is there any chance of President Soeharto visiting Australia in the<br />
near future?<br />
PM: Well, we're about between now and May next year to have an election in<br />
Australia, and I think he is going to be interested in the outcome of that<br />
election, as we are. And he has a standing invitation to visit Australia, of<br />
course, and he would be well advised by his advisers to think about that in the<br />
context of the next Australian Parliament and Government, and no doubt he<br />
will. But again, there's always been difficulties about him coming to Australia<br />
with vociferous objections to the policies of his Government in Timor, and<br />
that's not to say in some way that I notice there has been some comment<br />
[ that] I have made many visits here, and during this phase, he hasn't made a<br />
visit to Australia. But look at the results. There's APEC sitting there. There is<br />
this agreement sitting there. There's this continuous strengthening of the<br />
bilateral relationship. The Foreign Minister and the Defence Minister<br />
numerous visits here over the periods are all part of the building of this<br />
relationship. And I don't really I mean, I would like to see the President in<br />
Australia, but I don't think he needs to come to prove we have a relationship.<br />
J: Mr Keating, you. .( inaudible). are you looking at other bilateral agreements<br />
similar to this with, say, Malaysia and Singapore?<br />
PM. No. We are doing good and effective things with the Five Power Defence<br />
Agreement collaborative things in the defence field that's becoming more<br />
sophisticated as time goes by, and I think the structure of it suits Singapore,<br />
and suits Malaysia and suits us, suits New Zealand, suits the British. </p>
<p>6<br />
J Even if it means closer defence ties With Singapore and Malaysia?<br />
PM:-Well, they're quite close now. ) mean, we're doing joint exercises with them.<br />
The Malaysians are doing... the Singaporeans are doing their flying training<br />
they have got a base, of course, at Pearce in Western Australia. They are<br />
doing their tank training at Shoalwater Bay. We're doing collaborative things<br />
joint exercises with the Malaysians. So I don't think there's anything lacking<br />
there.<br />
J Prime Minister, this agreement seems to be being lauded less loudly in<br />
Indonesia than It Is in Australia. Does that concern you at all? Why do you<br />
think that is?<br />
PM: No. Well, Indonesia is a member of ASEAN, it has it's whole background is<br />
that it is in this perpetual partnership with the countries of the Association of<br />
South East Asian Nations they have just had, again, another summit. And,<br />
you know, there is a protocol about the way in which it acts inl the region,<br />
about its trade relations, about AFTA we're not in that position. So, for<br />
Australia, making a bilateral agreement such as this, with the import it has,<br />
there is an exclusive nature about it that I think there isn't with such an<br />
agreement with Indonesia which lives in these multi-lateral arrangements.<br />
J: So it's not a sign that it's more significant to Australia than it is to Indonesia?<br />
PM: No, I don't think so. And I think you can judge that by the attendance at the<br />
agreement, and at lunch.<br />
J: Mr Keating, whose idea was this notion of a security treaty, and will it<br />
automatically lead to much closer defence ties with Indonesia ties that have<br />
become much more close in recent years?<br />
PM: Well, I think it will. I think it's a signal that the declaration of trust which I<br />
spoke of earlier, is there in print. It's more than implied, it's more than<br />
something which flows from, or is drawn from, or is drawn down from a<br />
continuing -get of collaborative relations in defence and foreign policy. And I<br />
think the fact that it is there unambiguously in this way will mean more will be<br />
done, and it's In a sense a bit of a green light, I think, to our defence forces<br />
that more can be done.<br />
J: Can you indicate in the early stages how you see the agreement manifesting<br />
itself in practical terms over the next 2 3 years, in both countries?<br />
PMV: Well, I think it's a scene-setter, above all else. I mean, it's not only practical,<br />
but symbolic and a scene-setter, and it governs, I think, a whole lot of<br />
responses. You know we now meet as a Ministerial group. We have<br />
Austral ia-Indonesia Ministerial meetings, which go beyond as we have<br />
always had it in foreign policy and defence to the economy, to industry, to<br />
science and technology etc. And I just think all of these things will be given<br />
more impetus, too. What we're doing here is we're putting the mortar in the<br />
bricks of the relationship that's what we're doing. </p>

J ( inaudible)...<br />
P M. Well, we have had discussions for quite a long time, now, about how we ought<br />
to speak about the relationship with Indonesia in an official way, and we have<br />
had discussions about whether there should be a joint declaration of<br />
principles, or perhaps some other form. And we had a discussion in the<br />
security committee, some time I think in 1993, wherein we thought we might<br />
try and do something which was more explicit in the security area. In other<br />
words, something that was more a straight interface between our two<br />
countries, rather than something that in a sense, transcended the societal<br />
questions. And, as a consequence, I took that matter then forward, the<br />
Foreign Minister, the Minister for Defence and I had discussions about what<br />
the parameters of this might be, obviously, our close advisers had discussions<br />
about it. And then I raised the matter with President Soharto in 1994, and we<br />
had then further discussions in which General Gration and my colleague Allan<br />
Gyngell were involved with, and then the President came back to me on the<br />
question in Bali, and we decided to go further. Then there was another<br />
discussion between General Oration and Secretary of State Moerdiono, and<br />
then I had a further discussion with the President at the bilateral meeting I had<br />
In Osaka. Then discussions with my colleagues when I returned and, you<br />
know, the Cabinet since decided that the draft as presented was acceptable<br />
to it, and today we are here.<br />
J: Mr Prime Minister, you just mentioned that it was a declaration of trust?<br />
PM: Yes.<br />
J: Does that mean that there will no longer be suspicions between Australia and<br />
Indonesia?<br />
PM: Well, I think the answer to that is yes. I mean, in all nations you will always<br />
have suspicions, particularly in big nations where there are things in our<br />
history which have rankled us. But by and large, this is an endeavour better,<br />
a statement which makes clear what our strategic intentions are towards one<br />
another, by the Government of Australia, by the Government of Indonesia.<br />
And the general position that Indonesia has taken for so long about it's<br />
position, it's non-aligned position, it's view of other nations and their<br />
sovereignty, and the views that we have taken in the past mean that there ' is<br />
a sort of backdrop within which such settings can be made, as we have in this<br />
agreement. So, I think it will do a lot it is very much a declaratory set of<br />
statements about how we see one another, and the trust that binds them. And<br />
I think it must do a lot to reduce suspicions, in both countries, of both<br />
countries.<br />
J: Can I go back to this question about adverse external challenge could you<br />
clarify the concept of adverse challenge? Does it have any connotation of<br />
Australia being involved in an internal challenge that might occur?<br />
PM: Well, I said that I thought forcefully, and I hope well the moment I first said<br />
something about this. And so too did Foreign Minister Alatas make exactly<br />
the parallel point. So, let me use this opportunity to clear again this </p>
<p>FEL: 1l . Dec. 5 1i: 5(, No. OU6 P. uS/ U;<br />
8<br />
expression " adverse challenges" does not mean challenges with respect to<br />
the internal affairs of Indonesia, or the internal affairs of Australia. One of the<br />
values of this agreement is that it is an external interface, one to the other,<br />
between both countries. It is not about actually delving into our societies in<br />
any way, which makes it cleaner and therefore, I think, better. Thank you very<br />
much indeed.<br />
