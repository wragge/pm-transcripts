    <content><![CDATA[<p>E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />PM-SCHILVBERGER 3/ 12/ 86<br />PM I apologise to you and your listeners but I had a very important call before I was<br />due to leave and then the-traffic was much worse than we thought I'm sorry to<br />you and I'm sorry to your listeners.<br />S Can you tell Us about your important call?<br />PMNo.<br />S How obout S P. You weren't talking to them by any chance?<br />PM No I wasn't talking to them but I must say, as is so often the case, I hod a bit of<br />a giggle about Michelle Grattan saying it's a blow to the Govt. Scxne blow.<br />S Well, isn't It?<br />PM No of course it's not a blow. It's been anticipated and when you have an<br />international agency of that kind keeping you in the top eight sovereign borrowers<br />in the world and saying as they did that they approved of the policies of the<br />Aust Govt, welcomed them and said that they were the right policies to deal with<br />an externally imposed circvmstance. If that ' s a blow lot me hove a few more.<br />S At the time of the Moodys downgrading you and the Treasurer seemed to indicate that<br />that's alright S 9 P won't do the same.<br />PM We didn't s0y anything of the sort. It was expected that dealing with the sam<br />.1 circumstances you get the 3aMe sort of analysis because what they ore saying is<br />that there ore difficulties in debt servicing when you hove a dramatic turn in the<br />terms of trade against you and of course there are-Both Moodys and S&amp; P have spoken<br />very highly of the economic policies of the Govt to deal with this externally<br />imposed circumstance end I would welcome the fact that we have this endorsement of<br />our policies by these agencies.<br />S. You'd prefer Triple A wouldn't you?<br />PM Well I don't feel at oll upset because it is -still a very high rating, accept were<br />in the top eight sovereign borrowing nations in the world, the top eight, and we've<br />had imposed upon us these .: difficulties a massive turn-uruund In the terms<br />of trade which creates its own problems and if these agencies say woll look<br />you're still a very good credit rating and in making that judgement we're going to<br />tell the world -we think you-' re pursuing the right policies I don't have any upset<br />about that and I suppose significantly-nor des the market..<br />S. Now talking about the market , we know we're now sitting on about 65c in the<br />against the $ US to what extent will you try to keep it there?</p>
<p>PM Well, I'm not OnIn0 Jntn retni1 nf whnt, thp Rpsprvp Rnnk pnlry's onino tn hp<br />QUm-Llurn Lv uy wc think gncrully the. mmarknt hi ettled nt nn npprnprfntflevel<br />at this point in time . It is one that represents a very significant<br />opportunity to Australian manufocturers to compete against imports and to find<br />export markets overseas they never could have done before.<br />We're relaxed about the sort of level that it is now. We're not going to be getting<br />upset about that.<br />S You do have an input though as to what the Reserve Bank does<br />PM Yes, well the Bank conducts its operations. There is discussion between the Bank<br />and the Treasurer and I'm more than hoppy with the way things are going. I'm not<br />going to cause any other speculation by any further comments on that.<br />S The tax cuts seem to have been swamped by other issues?<br />PM You can make that judgement if you like I don't think they've been swamped. The fact<br />is that peoplr arc going to Fet the tUx Cuts now and they are going to get further<br />significant tux cuts in July. You know I am always amused by professional<br />commentators your Grottans and so on , who-sit in the gallery and get overwhelmed<br />by what they think is the big issue of the day. They're more often wrong than right.<br />The Aust public, an institution in which I have great faith they are much more<br />sane and are much more capable of getting things in their longer term perspective.<br />They might get a bit excited for a while about a particular issue but they in<br />their doily lives make the judgements aboutwhat's important and I'm quite content<br />that by the time we go through next year and when these rates are brought down<br />in the way in which the conservatives never could do because they were engaged<br />in allowing the tax system to be absolutely rotted and imposing greater burdens on<br />your average taxpayers the taxpayer of this country will make the right<br />judgement.<br />S. When you are critical though of the Grottons and other political observers if<br />I open the lines now, in fact I did a few moments ago<br />I listened to your lines<br />S Well, the very first question was why didnl. t you sack Paul Keating?<br />PM I heard that.<br />S Why don't you?<br />PM There are 16m people in Australia and you get one question why don't I sack PK<br />what sort of conclusion um I suppvzcd to draw from that? I'll give you the answer<br />to that person and whoever else might be answering ( sic) it. Because he didn't<br />deserve to be sacked. He mode a mistake 1 a significant mistake and I said 3o. I<br />repeat that i was a significant mistake and it is not however a mistake which<br />deserves socking. There was no impropriety there was no attempt to advantage<br />himself he is the loser the financial loser through not having lodged his<br />return. Now I told him he made a mistake . He knows he mode a mistake. Now if we're<br />going to have an analysis of PK let's have it.<br />S Did he offer his resignation to you?<br />PM You know he didn't offer his resignation.<br />S I wouldn't ask you if I knew. 3/</p>
<p>-3-<br />PM I don't mind Michael. 1 know you've grown up a bit more than thot,. Don't be silly.<br />You know that he didn't so don't let us waste time because time is valuable.<br />S. Yes iti..,<br />PM You know that he didn't so why do you suggest that you didn't know?<br />S Here is an issue though that has token media coverage not only media coverage<br />I suggest to you that people are interested in this and are concerned about it.<br />PM I didn't say they're not interested. Of course they're interested and I'm saying<br />to you as PM I didn't ask for his resignation . While he mode a mistake and it<br />was one I criticised him far there was no suggestion of impropriety and he did<br />not advantage himself by not putting it in he disadvantaged himself financially.*<br />Now I wish he hadn't made the mistake .1 believe he certainly won't make that<br />again but I have to in these things make a judgement and the judgement is<br />that in terms of the interest of the Avst people this is the man who has been<br />responsible for the greatest reform in Australia's tax history which will mean<br />that we've gcto significantly fairer and more efficient tax system as a result of<br />the changes for which he's been responsible. Now I'm not going to be in a<br />position of having all those things in the balance sheet which show him to be<br />a great Tresaurer and say against that yes he's made this mistakep thi3<br />personal mistake and because of that mistake which Involved no impropriety<br />no financial advantage but a financial loss I'm going to sock him.<br />S Will that significant mistake cost you votes at the next election?<br />PM I don't believe so.<br />S Are you sure?<br />PM Well Michael, how can I be sure. You asked me<br />You're worried about his credibility<br />PM No I am not. At this time he is down. There's no'doubt about that. Of course he<br />is down. He is not well regarded for some reasons including that but what I've<br />said before by the time we get up to the next election in the whole sweep of<br />tax reform for which this Govt has been responsible we'll be up there agoinst the!<br />record of John Howardf the worst record of any Treasurer in the history of this<br />country. They'll be the two contrasts JH , the man who walked out of office with<br />a top tax rate of 60c in the 1 that's his legacy PK 0Pc in the $. Howard on<br />the other hand who was condemned by his own Royal Commidssioner as having presided<br />aver the worst .5 years of' tax avoidance and evasion in the history of this<br />country which had cost the ordinary taxpayer more than had ever been inflicted<br />on him before . That was the Fraser-Howard record. Against that the cleaning up of tNK<br />tax system by PK. A more efficient fairer tax system with all the rorts and the<br />rants wiped out which hod been allowed to flourish under the Conservatives.<br />That'll be the record. 4/</p>
<p>S Well, I want to talk more about Lux reform in a moment but there is this question<br />about rorts and there was this question from a listener a moment ago about the<br />travelling allowance so-called rort.<br />PM Well, you know the answer to that. The fact is that what PK claimed in regard to TA<br />44<br />was precisely in line 4the findings and decisions of the Remuneration Tribunal.<br />And in line with the Cabinet decision. You know that. It's the some way that it's<br />being done by people in the Opposition. Is there any question.... I have not wanted<br />to roise other people on the other side but you know if you wanted to look at the<br />Deputy Leader of the National Party Mr. Hunt exactly the same position. But Mr.<br />Hunt ' s not doing anything wrong. He's doing it in line with the decision of the<br />Remuneration Tribunal.<br />S It's not just a question of PK's it's a question whether TA now is a fringe<br />benefit.<br />PM The simple fact is in regard to the TA that has been put in question in regard to<br />Mr. Keating it is not something that he is doing other than in strict acdordance<br />with the law and what's been decided by an independent tribunal and is what's<br />being done properly on both sides of the House.<br />Pnrlirmnnt nn thn APC Whnn nrn jonii fnllnirr nnd lndinn onina fn oni 6nyasihm<br />-I j ll sl 1 i mi-k10 w,-K-w flai ffualt. Lv Lw L1<br />PM I don't know. It's not on my agenda at the moment Michael.<br />S Do you think we can put it on the agenda?<br />PM Ohi it might get on one day.<br />S Tax reform. Did you make a mistake with the tax summit which prevented you from<br />introducing an indirect tax like a consumption tax?<br />PM No I did not make a mistake with the tax summit because 1 believe the concept of<br />consultation with the connunity has been one of the distinguishing marks of the<br />success of this Govt's economic policies. It was appropriate that we try and talk<br />with and listen to the community. If there hadn't been a summit the community would<br />still have mode its position very strongly apparent: on the question of the<br />consumption tax. That they were able to do that within a summit situation where we<br />got views on a whole range of issues including some of those matters we were then<br />able to include In the alternative approach and as I've said all along on the<br />Jssue of tax I think we hove got the best that we can in the absence of on approval<br />by the Aust community of a consumption tax and there will be a clear distinction<br />to be made bctwocn the conservatives who had 7h years to put their policy in,<br />left with a top marginal tax rote of 60c because they are a party which approves of<br />allowing privileges and rorts to minorities in the community , If you're going to do<br />that you're not going to have the amount of tax available. We've knocked those rorts<br />out and have used the proceeds to bring down their top marginal rate from 60 to<br />49 as it'll be by July of next year.</p>
<p>That's the reform and and that's quite clearly going to be there. for people to<br />judge between one situotion and the other.<br />S You and the Treasurer wanted some sort of consumption tax when you went into that<br />tax summit. When you talk now though of the comunity being upset, they're upset<br />now with FBT . What difference is that if they'd been upset about a consumption tax?<br />PM You soy they're upset about a FBT . I have no doubt as that tax settles in, the<br />arithmetic o' it is going to be quite clear and that is the great majority of<br />people benefit from the-fact that there is a FBT imposed upon the minority who<br />previously avoided any tax at all on that port of their emoluments. Now I hove no<br />concerns about that . We took a battering because we were in the process of getting<br />the whole thing together . We weren't able to have the benefit of either on<br />cxposition sy3tem once the tax was in or the opportunity for people to see it in..<br />operation.. As that goes on' the FBT will be seen as a positive by the great majority<br />of the Aust people. There's no question about that.<br />S Can you sec the time where it will be necessary for you to introduce a consumption<br />tax?<br />PM No, 1 don't see that.<br />S After the next election?<br />PM No I don't see that. I'm concerned at this point with getting these changes bedded<br />down and I believe as they ure bedded down they will give Aust the best, fairest,<br />most efficient tax system that this country's ever had. So you are now going to have<br />incentive back in.' have an uproarious giggle when I hear these posturing fellows<br />from the Liberals we're in favor of incentive. Incentive in the tax system"<br />what was their incentiveThey had a very clear system of Incentive. That is an<br />incentive for the minority, for the privileged saying we'll give you the Incentive<br />of being able to avoid paying any tax at all. But as for as the: ordinary honest<br />taxpayer is concerned the incentive the Liberals provided for them was a top<br />marginal rote of 60c in the $. My Govt has provided real incentive by knocking that<br />top marginal rate down as it will be by July of next year for a 60c of John Howard,<br />thot's his Incentive tax rate, the Hawke incentive rate will be 49c in the I<br />S To be able to maintain that you're going to have to find other revenueparticulorly<br />as we've got our balance of payments the way they are at the moment.<br />PM Well, I'm glad that you've flourished as a economics expert , Michael, I might just<br />add in to you profound knowledge of the subject that you'll find that economic<br />growth will ensure that our capacity to sustain those rates will be there.<br />S You hove no doubt that you'll be able to reduce the deficit despite my lack of<br />knowledge in this area I know that much, you need to reduce the deficit. and<br />because you've said so<br />PM What has been our record then in the reduction of the deficit.<br />S It's gone down.</p>
<p>What I'm asking you is how are you going to maintain it?*<br />PM It was 59K of MDP when we cce'in that was what we inherited. We've got it down to<br />under 1 . So the point I'm making my friend is that from the $ 9.6B the 5% GP<br />the record is having got it down from 9.6 to MD~ to l. 4%. Now I simply soy to<br />the Schildbergers or this world who soy well what are yov.-going to do. Well I soy<br />look at what we've done. We've brought it down from 9.6 to 3.5 from of WUP to<br />1.4 .1 say you just look at the record. I'm entitled to soy we've don* it.<br />S You're doing well at the moment. You've done It so fa r My question really is what<br />orc you going to do next time around?<br />Pki Well, if you don't understand the point I'm really making. I'm simply saying<br />S I do...<br />, PM Well, be satisfied my friend that I'm entitled to say there's the record we<br />came in in ' 83 that's what we've done, I'm entitled to say we'll continue to<br />do It and we will.<br />S Can I be blunt and ask you this question, can you give an undertaking now that we<br />won't hove a consumption tax if you win the next election?<br />PM Yes I can. I am not concerned with bringing in any more taxes. We've faced up<br />to this. We've brought AAOthe ronan~ or Luxes that are necessary and I am<br />satisfied with what we've done.<br />S An ongoing question, another one that was raised by a listener this morning, is<br />a prices freeze.<br />PM I heard the lady in question and you were on the right track in saying we haven't<br />got the constitutional power to freeze prices. She was wrong in saying the PSA<br />had brought in a freeze. They've suggested that that ought to happen . They've g6t.<br />no constitutional power to impose a price freeze. Now what we're doing is toa try and<br />strengthen the resources of the PSA so that their oversight capacities con be<br />increased and so their power to publicise the activities of price setters can be<br />strengthened.<br />S But would you like to see the states get together and initiate a prices freeze?<br />PM Well, I'd much prefer a situation in which the price setters in the conununity I the<br />business community themselves exercise their own powers and hud on attitude<br />of trying to ensure the lowest possible prices because I think an economy works<br />better with the minimum amount of regulation provided the players in the scene<br />play the game according to the right rules. Now therefore I would like to see the<br />situation where companies in this country did respond to the activities of the PSA<br />when you have regulation in you're going to substitute the decisions of market<br />forces for the arbitrary decision of bureaucrats and -ideally I don't think that's<br />what you want</p>
<p>But that does require for the market forces in fact to be operating.<br />S What about wage5 now and there is this question the employers are asking right<br />now is for a wages freeze.<br />PM Yes, they are So what's new. They've bee,, duing that for 20 years.<br />S You hove comc forth with your submission saying you'd recommend a $ 10 increase<br />in the first tier. The ACTU hasn't put forward a figure ot all. Why did you choose<br />to?<br />PM Well, because we've looked at what we've achieved in the area of wages policy since<br />we've been in office. We believe, on'indeed the commentators we've been talking about<br />agree with us that we've hod on outstandingly successful wages polickhich has been<br />one of the reasons why we've been able to create the 670,000 new jobs which is<br />a record in employment growth in the history of this country. Now we think it's the<br />responsibility of ours to indicate to the Commission the sort of wages outcome<br />which can be consistent with that sort of record we've had in the past. When we<br />brought down the udget it wus boned upon an earnings mnvement in ' 86/' 87 of Just<br />over 4% and we are saying therefore to the Comission the sorts of increases thot'll<br />be consistent with our Budget planning for 86/ 87 and what we hove in mind for<br />87/ 88. We think we hove that responsibility to soy to the Commission what sort<br />of outcome will be a part of the general economic approach.<br />S Can you see a bigger shift in industrial relations in the future. I mean we've seen<br />quite a bit in the last few months I suppose with more flexibility that there's<br />more than relationship between employer and employee rather than the way it's been<br />hoppcning in recent years?<br />PM There con be more flexibility .1 mean this is not just a question of hypothesis. I<br />mean I've been doing things about itin two major woys. Firstly we're giving our<br />support to the concept of the 2-tier system will allow a greater degree of<br />negotiation and flexibility between employees and employers . Secondly and most<br />importantly in that meeting I convened in September of the BCA and the CAI on the<br />one side and the ACTU on the other and I congratulate themnall for their positive<br />rcsponse. They come there by request and have agreed now to to work hard now on<br />improving work and management proctices. This is going to now mear-and it's starting<br />to happen as a result of that, that more discussions at the workplace at the<br />enterprise level to eliminate inefficient work and management practices. That's<br />going to bring employees and management closer together. So in both these ways we've<br />been responsible for stimulating a greater degree of direct discussion between<br />employer and employee and that's what needs to happen.<br />7./</p>
<p>-a-<br />S The Australia Card. If you lose that in the Senate what's your next step?<br />PM We'll put it up again. We've said that Michael.<br />S Is it on issue big enough for a double dissolution?<br />PM You seekto wont this program for me to come on and.. repeat what I've said publicly<br />several times. This Parlt is going its full term.<br />S There's no issue big enough to prompt a double dissolution?<br />PM Not that I con see. 1 mean I am simply going to put that up again so people will<br />know our determination our commitment to hove on Australio Cord with photograph<br />it's what is right, it's what the people want because it is what will be the<br />most cffcCtive instrument to stamp out social security fraud and tax evasion.<br />We are committed to that, the people want it . The Liberals and the Democrats<br />don't wont that. So OK if the Librals and the Democrats want to keep telling the<br />Aust people that they ore opposed to the instrument which the Aust people know is<br />the most efficient to wipe out social security fraud and tax fraud let the<br />Liberals and the Democrats keep saying it because we'll keep giving them the<br />opportunity to say it.<br />S Would you like to see the Democrats wiped out at the next election?<br />PM I am basically as you know a kind generous charitable person I don't want to<br />see people get wiped out .1 wont to see people follow sensible policies and if the<br />Democrats are going to make decisions for instance like on the Australia Cord.<br />they are opposed to the instrument 1 which as I say is going to be the most<br />effective instrurment to wipe out fraud and tax evasion and on instrument which<br />is being brought in with the greatest amount of care to ensure the protection<br />of civil liberties individual rights, and if they make wrong decisions like<br />that they ore the ones that run risks.<br />S Cough Whitlom says your reforms haven't been good enough.<br />PM I'm agoin as I said before a kind charitable person by nature I made the<br />observation that Mr. Whitlam approves of this Govt sufficiently to accept every<br />position that we've offered to him and accepts those decisions of Govt<br />S Why is he having a go at you?<br />PM I find it rather interesting to observe post politicians some are able to accept<br />the transition with grace and effectively On both sides of politics you can<br />think of those who do it and you can think of those who don't . Now X could if I<br />wonted to I suppose make observations about my predecessor but what good does<br />that do whut good does that do anyone what good does it do the Labor Party.<br />what good doe5 it do the people of this country. It would perhaps give some degree<br />of satisfaction to make some observations. Well, I think there's an onus on<br />people in life to not just indulge yourself in personal satisfoction. I could<br />on so many occasions do it about so many people including I might say Gogh<br />but I don't think that does any good. 9/</p>
<p>S You hove tried to distance yourself on your party now, and the Govt now has<br />tried to distance itself from the previous Whitlam Govt.<br />PM Well, you say that. What's your evidence of that. What I've done is to govern<br />this country according to the needs of the timef ca, nd the needs of the future.<br />Now if anyone doesn; t understand that 1986 is a change difference from 1972<br />then they don't begin to understand anything. Govt in Aust in 1986 requires<br />decisions 4hich ore releuant to the circumstances of this time and what we can<br />scc is necessary for the future of this country. And I'm providing with my<br />colleagues, that Govt. If people wont to make comparisons with another era,<br />another time , well OK let them do that. I will go about the business of making the<br />decisions with my colleogues that I believe are necessary for the welfare of<br />this country and according to our resources and our capacity at this time.<br />I'm not going to succumb to any temptation to get into a slanging match with<br />* Vnyone whether it's Gough Whitlam or anyone else.<br />S Are you enjoying the Prime Ministership?<br />PM Love it.<br />S How long are you going to stay there?<br />PM We'll have an election at the end of the full term of this Parlt . I'm confident<br />the Aust people will make the comparison between 74 years of conservative<br />govt and the 5 years of our govt . Our record in that time will surpass the<br />conservatives in every relevant respect. We will hove done better by light years<br />than they did in every respect in terms of economic growth , EMPLOYMENTinflation,<br />social welfare, environment, in every issue, the pursuit of peace , in every issue<br />' we'll be light years ahead of them and I think we will get the verdict that we<br />should get of another term. I will then enter into, I hope an historic: third<br />term in terms of the history of Aust Federation . It will be the 3rd successive<br />Labor Govt and I will then try to do the job that's necessary. Now as to how long,<br />it's a matter for then, but I would simply say that I'm not one who: wants to<br />break every record in sight and go on forever . I've been given a great<br />opportunity and privilege by the people of Aust .1 hope I'm proving worthy of it<br />I would think that within a period of 8 years or something like that you would<br />have mode your mark, your contribution then it would probably be time to step<br />aside for others.<br />S Has it been harder than you thought it would be?<br />PM Well, this is a real politician's answer yes and no. I mean yes and no. The<br />sense in which it's been harder is that I don't think until you ore there that<br />you can quite understand the never ending demands that are made upon you . A don't<br />soy that with any sense of burden because the demands are interesting<br />stimulating and you've always got the opportunity of doing something that's<br />useful. Bvt it is neverhteless incessant. i</p>
<p>The NO port of the question is that I didn't think there would just be the range<br />of help thut's available , You've got within the PSI and I've had my criticism of<br />the PS, and I'm bringing in a lot of reforms making it leaner and tougher and<br />more efficient but within, let me say, the PS there are some magnificent<br />resources . Also I didn't reolise that I'd be able to get such a great band of<br />people around me. Changes have been made but I've continuously had marvellous<br />people around me. Within the business community within the trade unionswithin<br />the Aust community generally again I couldn't have imugined in advance the<br />enormous strength of support that's been forthcoming. In saying people hove been<br />marvellous in on organisation, they really have been good and they have made<br />the job easier in that sense than I thought. So that's the sense in which I say<br />YES and NO.<br />S Is consenus govt more difficult than you thought?<br />PM Striving to get as much agreement as you can in a community is a very difficult<br />process but the results ore worthwhile . We could not have turned the economy<br />around after' 83 and created 670,000 new-jobs and done all those things and got<br />Au3Lrullun3 liking one another ugain. Do you remember what' 82 was like<br />Australians just hated one another they were fighting one another. It was<br />divided , bitter , the process of getting them to like one another again and to<br />work with one another again, and to recognise the challenges together that's<br />beaut. I get enormous satisfaction out of thot. It's not easy but it's worthwhile.<br />S You're not getting the credit though in terms of opinion polls?<br />PM I don't govern on the basis of trying to get the opinion polls up . You've got to<br />take tough decisions on the basis of that's what's necessary you take them.! said<br />in my address to the notion in the middle of the year what was important to<br />me was the future of this country and I take the decisions even if it meant loss<br />of office . People hod gone " Oh will he?" and the answer was yes I did. I got<br />my head down and we made a series of tough decisions and the polls went down . But<br />they were the right decisions . Now for what it's worth the polls are coming up<br />again.<br />S Couldn't those decisions have been tougher'so that you could have tried to reduce<br />inflation more so and unemployment?<br />PM You couldn't hove made any tougher decisions .1 think that were right.<br />We've got the right sort of mix. I mean you can't just cut the economy off<br />altogether at the legs . You've got to keep the economy moving but not at such a<br />high level of activity which is going to suck in imports at an unsustainable<br />leveJo you had to decide to get just that lee1' of activity which would keep<br />the employment situation as goj ou could without bringing about an<br />un~ sustainable balance of paymentsproblem. 11</p>
<p>S S -11-<br />And I think we hit the balance just about right. Now you see my whole time in public<br />life has been based upon belief that the Aust people ore decent and sane and<br />sensible that in the long run they will make the right sorts of judgements.<br />I have no reason to believe that's going to change. They couldn't quite see Just<br />what we were about in the middle of the year and they saw the tumbling<br />and all the gloom. But now they're seeing I think more and more that the Govt<br />got its head down got its act together got the right sort of policies<br />they ore starting to 5harpen and the people will make their judgement. I'm not<br />one who believes that politics is for the doy that you ) ust make that decision<br />today what you think is going to be the popular one. You've got to make the<br />decisions which ore right for the longer haul * We hove made them and we'll get<br />the appropriate Judgement.<br />S You say you want Australians to like each other but you don't want to shake<br />Jay Pendarvis by the hand?<br />PM No I didn't agree with what happened there, and the tactics on both sides.<br />I think the gentleman you mentioned was at fault I think the union was at<br />fault and I think it was a process of total confrontation which is alien to<br />my concept as to how we've got to go about improving this economy.
