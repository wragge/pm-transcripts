The Prime Minister, Julia Gillard has written to the Governor-General recommending that the Queen establish a new medal for people who have performed extraordinary acts or services during a national emergency.</p>
<p>This summer's floods have served up the worst that nature can deliver and our nation has responded with the best of the Australian spirit.</p>
<p>While in some parts of the nation, the rescue and recovery efforts are still underway, the stories of heroism, bravery and selflessness are emerging as communities start to reflect on the tragedy that swept through their lives.</p>
<p>To complement existing forms of national recognition, the Prime Minister has recommended that a new medal in Australia's honours system be established called the âNational Emergency Medalâ.</p>
<p>The new medal would recognise extraordinary or sustained services to others during a national emergency such as the recent floods.</p>
<p>Following approval, the award will also be back-dated to cover the Victorian bushfires in 2009.</p>
<p>The proposed new medal will be a permanent element in the national honours system, established by the Queen and awarded by the Governor-General. </p>
<p>In addition to the new medal, the Prime Minister has proposed a new scheme to ensure that everyone who has contributed to the rescue and recovery effort in their local communities receives due acknowledgement.</p>
<p>Ms Gillard is writing to the Premiers of flood-affected States to support a separate community-driven form of recognition to acknowledge local heroes, including the outstanding work done by professionals and volunteers alike.</p>
<p>Informal recognition by way of commemorative pins or certificates is often initiated by the relevant State in partnership with the Commonwealth for a particular event and can provide broad, community-based recognition for all of those involved.</p>
<p>Ms Gillard said the medal and local hero recognition scheme will provide the nation with a way to express our collective gratitude for those who have supported individuals and communities during a time of crisis.</p>
<p>Nominees for the medal and recognition scheme could include members of emergency services personnel, government employees, corporate and private sector employees and private citizens.</p>
<p>Only those who have provided sustained or significant service to others in a national emergency would be eligible for the medal.</p>
<p>The criteria for medal nominations will be developed in the coming months following approval by the Queen.</p>
<p>It is expected that the first medals will be awarded retrospectively to people who distinguished themselves during the Victorian bushfires and the recent floods.</p>
<p>The medal will then be awarded annually as part of the official Australia Day ceremonies. </p>
