M. 1. No. 33Z1260<br />
MR. MENZIES TO ATTEND U. N. GENE-RAL<br />
ASS Ed1BLY<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister and Minister for External<br />
Affairs<br />
The Prime Minister and Minister for External<br />
Affairs, Mr. Menzies, made the following announcement by leave<br />
in the House of Representatives today<br />
Mr. Speaker, in view of my reply to a question<br />
yesterday, honorable members may enjoy a little wellearned<br />
hilarity today when I tell them that contrary to my<br />
first desire I propose no-. to make a quick journey to the<br />
United Nations General Assembly Jhere, of course, I will<br />
look foruaard to seeing my friend the honorable member for<br />
Banks. As the meeting of the Assembly has-developed, it<br />
has been attended by an increasing number of heads of<br />
government, including heads of Commonwealth Governments,<br />
the latest announced yesterday being the Prime Minister of<br />
New Zealand. having regard to that fact, I should think that<br />
honorable members would not wish Australia, speaking in<br />
terms of heads of govornment, to be conspicuous by its<br />
absence. Matters of great importance are under discussion,<br />
and if one may make even a small contribution to the<br />
solution of the rorld's problems, the trip will be<br />
worthwhile. CANBERRA,<br />
28th September, 1960. </p>
