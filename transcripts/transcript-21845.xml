    <content><![CDATA[<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Good afternoon. Ladies and gentlemen I have called this news conference to say a few things about the Asia-Pacific Partnership on Clean Development and Climate. This is an historic agreement for the cause of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. It brings together the United States, Australia, China, Japan, India and South Korea. Those nations together comprise more than 50 per cent of the world's population, 50 per cent or more of energy consumption and also 50 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions. And the Vision Statement that's been released in Vientiane tackles head on the need to put greater emphasis on new and more effective technologies to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions from the use of fossil fuels. In that sense, the Partnership is on all fours with the philosophy of the Government's energy statement released more than 18 months ago. The nations that comprise this partnership are all committed to a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. From Australia's standpoint, the entirety of the Kyoto Protocols was never fairly based. It would have unreasonably penalised countries such as Australia, and that is why we have not ratified the protocol although we have committed ourselves to reaching the emission target set by Kyoto and we are well on track towards doing that.</p>
<p> And I very warmly welcome this Partnership because it means that the six nations are committed to a process of finding different ways, including but not only, new technology in order to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions coming from the use of conventional fuel sources. Australia, as you all know, is very rich in energy. Australia is the largest coal exporter in the world and it is in Australia's interests that we try and find a way of coal being consumed in a manner that does not add as much as it does now to greenhouse gas emissions. It is a matter of the national interest and of commonsense that Australia should associate herself very vigorously with such a process.</p>
<p>And we are going to, of course, continue to pursue other climate change opportunities, including some of the things laid out in the G8 Meeting. But what is good about this Partnership is that it establishes a long term framework for cooperation amongst key countries in the region on practical ways of developing and promoting clean technology.</p>
<p> The Vision Statement has been released in Vientiane by the Foreign Ministers. President Bush has made a statement regarding this issue. It's a matter that I discussed with him during my meetings in Washington the week before last and I welcome very warmly this historic agreement between the Asian Pacific countries which together comprises I said more than 50 per cent of the world's population, energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
<p>This will be more effective in our view and fairer. The fairness and effectiveness of this proposal will be superior to the Kyoto Protocol. It demonstrates the very strong commitment of Australia to reducing greenhouse gas emissions but according to an understanding that is fair to Australia and not something that will destroy Australian jobs and unfairly penalise Australian industry. Are there any questions on that or indeed anything else?</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Will nuclear power be one of your alternative energies?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I've already said that I'm happy to debate the issue of nuclear power if that's something that comes up in the course of the examination so be it. The greater emphasis is on finding ways of reducing the greenhouse gas emissions flowing from the exploitation of traditional energy sources.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:  This agreement has been described as largely symbolic because it doesn't have any sort of binding emissions reductions targets on member countries?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I reject the suggestion that it's symbolic. It's anything but symbolic when you bring together countries that comprise, as I said 50 per cent of the world population, greenhouse gas emissions and energy consumption. And the reason it's not symbolic is that what it recognises is that we have to find ways of reducing the greenhouse gas emissions flowing from the use of fossil fuels, as well as seeking alternatives. It is too expensive at present. The technology is way too expensive to see many of the alternative sources as an effective alternative to the traditional sources. And it is clearly in Australia's interests because of our natural endowments that we go down this path. I have never seen the logic of Australia unreasonably penalising herself by saying well in effect we're going to try and move away from the use of fuels in relation to which Australia has a natural advantage.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>But Prime Minister won't those renewable technologies always remain too expensive if countries like Australia and the US aren't prepared to invest in them?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No. It's a question though of exploiting those areas where you have a natural advantage.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister I was asked to relay another question.  You have said, you made a commitment that the level of Australia's troops in Iraq will not be increased.  A translation has come from the Prime Minister of Iraq saying that he applauds support for, from Australia, for increased, for the security apparatus at all levels in Iraq.  And how do you reconcile your statement...?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Sorry? How do I reconcile...</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>The Iraqi Prime Minister has been quoted as saying that he applauds Australia's...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>That he implores?</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Applauds. Applauds.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Applauds.  Yeah.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>...support for the security apparatus in Iraq at all levels through improving infrastructure.  You have said that there's not going to be a rise in the level of Australia's commitment in Iraq and I'm asked to ask, how do you reconcile those two statements?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well quite easily. I was in Iraq two days ago and I spoke to the Prime Minister and he didn't ask me for anymore forces. He's very grateful for the commitment we've already made. I don't see any inconsistency at all. What I have said is that we have no current plans to increase our force commitment and we believe that the current commitment is appropriate. That's what I've said and that remains the position. I was talking to him what three days ago and he did not ask me for more support but he is certainly very grateful for the support that we have provided and I'm not surprised that he would applaud what we have done in different ways and at different levels. There's no inconsistency.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>You've not made any commitment?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>The situation remains as I have explained it and that is that I believe and the Government believes that the current force commitment is appropriate and we have no current plans to increase that commitment. And I did not receive from the Prime Minister of Iraq when I saw him in his office in Baghdad three days ago, a request for an increase in our commitment. But I did receive from him very warm expressions of gratitude for the support that Australia has already provided and will continue to provide until the job is done.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister in relation to the families of the children that have been released from detention centres today, there have been some concerns raised about some children having had access to psychologists to talk about the accommodation they may be going to - do you have any comment about that?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No except to say that we are acting in accordance with the announcement I made several weeks ago. Thank you.</p>
