    <content><![CDATA[<p>I have asked the Premiers, Chief Ministers and the Australian Local Government Association to attend a Council of Australian Governments meeting in Melbourne on 20 December 2007. </p>
<p>The Government has a plan to move Australia forward by boosting long-term productivity growth for the future.</p>
<p>The Government has a plan to tackle Australia's future challenges and I want to begin implementing that plan as soon as possible.</p>
<p>I want to use this COAG meeting to set a new framework for co-operative Commonwealth-State relations and take practical steps to end the blame game.</p>
<p>The time for buck-passing must come to an end. The time for real work to deal with real problems facing the nation must begin.</p>
<p>Discussions at the Melbourne COAG will include:</p>
<p>1. The future of Health and Hospitals in Australia, including:</p>
<p>     * Tackling elective surgery waiting lists</p>
<p>     * Investing in aged care, especially in transition care</p>
<p>     * Investing in public dental programs</p>
<p>     * Preventative healthcare</p>
<p>2. Education, Skills and Training  -  The Productivity Agenda, including:</p>
<p>     * Lifting the Year 12 retention target</p>
<p>     * Investing in Early Childhood</p>
<p>     * Promoting the study of Asian languages in our schools</p>
<p>     * Establishing Trades Training Centres in Secondary Schools</p>
<p>     * Implementing the Government's National Secondary School Computer Fund</p>
<p>     * Developing a National Curriculum</p>
<p>3. Climate Change and Water, including:</p>
<p>     * Establishing a National Emissions Trading system</p>
<p>     * Establishing a single national renewable energy target </p>
<p>4. Infrastructure:</p>
<p>     * Establishment of Infrastructure Australia to audit Australia's infrastructure bottlenecks.</p>
<p>5. Business deregulation, including:</p>
<p>     * Cutting red tape for Australian business</p>
<p>6. Housing, including:</p>
<p>     * More streamlined development approval processes and measures to reduce infrastructure charges and developer costs</p>
<p>     * Addressing rental affordability</p>
<p>     * Homelessness</p>
<p>7. Other National Reform Initiatives</p>
<p>The purpose of the 20 December meeting is to agree on a comprehensive program of work for COAG for 2008 with agreed objectives and reporting timelines.</p>
<p>In a departure from past meetings, I have invited Treasurers to also attend this meeting in Melbourne.</p>
<p>I do not under-estimate the degree of difficulty involved in this ambitious agenda.  </p>
<p>But the time has come now to roll our sleeves up and get to work.</p>
