STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE RT. HON.<br />
R. G. MENZIES, IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES<br />
ON THURSDAY. 27TH APRIL,. 1961.-<br />
WEST NEW GUINEA<br />
We have had. a brief, but-. most-interesting, visit from<br />
General Nasution, the Indonesian Minister for National Security<br />
and C. G. S. He met Ministers for discussion, while subsequently<br />
I had two long talks, at each of which Mr. Townley was present.<br />
In the result, though no new policies were exprassed,<br />
both General Nasution and I thought that there was a<br />
considerable clarification of points of view, and further<br />
elucidation of the facts..<br />
The discussions throughout were conducted, as one would<br />
expect, in an atmosphere of the utmost good will and of mutual<br />
respect. Our two countries are neighbours and friends, with<br />
very great interests in common; our interest in peace, in<br />
security, in resisting communism. The one matter of difference<br />
of opinion relates to West New Guinea. And even there, as I<br />
have been able to point out to the General, Australia's<br />
interest in New Guinea as an island derives from our desire to<br />
see the economic and social progress of its inhabitants, and<br />
from our natural interest in the character of its political<br />
future. It 1i rn interest, which has been emphasised by the<br />
significance of New Guinea to us in two wars, and more<br />
particularly in the second. It doo5 nort arive from<br />
hostility to Indonesia, for thcre is no such hostility in<br />
Australia. Having made these general remarks, I think i. t dno to<br />
this House and to our distinguished visitor that I should state<br />
in summary form and, I hope, with complete fairness, the<br />
Indonesian point of view as explained to us, and the<br />
Australian point of view as explained by us. I put it in this<br />
way, though at all stages it was made clear that, in the dispute<br />
or difference between the Neotherlands and Indonesia, Australia<br />
is neither a party principal nor a self-appointed arbitrator,<br />
but is a naturally interested noighbour.<br />
As General Nasution explained it, thn Indonesian<br />
position is that its claim to West New Guinca is not legal, but<br />
political and historical, West New Guinea having been part of the<br />
Netherlands East Indies. He claimed that Jeo'st New Guinea was<br />
part of Indonesia before the establishment of the Netherlands<br />
East Indies. It is because of this, he said, that Indonesia<br />
will not take the matter to the International Court a<br />
procedure which Australia has constantly advocated, and which<br />
the Netherlands is willing to adopt.<br />
We dwelt on this matter for some time. I once more<br />
made it clear that Australia attached great importance to<br />
sovereignty, in a world in which new sovereignties are being<br />
created and independent rights maintained. I said that we<br />
recognised Dutch sovereignty in West New Guinea ( with all that<br />
such recognition involved) and that we could not reasonably or<br />
successfully be asked to reverse this recognition. If the<br />
matter went to the International Court, I said, and the<br />
judgment went for Indonesia, we would of course respect that<br />
judgment. General Nasution said that he understood our argument<br />
on that point, but added that one consequence of it should be<br />
that, in any discussions between the Netherlands and </p>
<p>Indonesia about West New Guinea, Australia should be strictly<br />
neutral, and should not support and encourage the Dutch either<br />
generally or in the United Nations. This indeed, as he made<br />
clear, was the great thing that he wanted to establish with us.<br />
I therefore reiterated that, as we had said at the time of Dr.<br />
Subandrio's visit, we desired three things<br />
1. That there should be no recourse to armed force, whether<br />
by major or minor operations by armed<br />
infiltrations) to give effect to Indonesia's<br />
territorial claim.<br />
2. That any negotiations between Indonesia and the<br />
Netherlands should be voluntary and free of any threat<br />
or duress.<br />
3. That any agreement made as a result of negotiations so<br />
conducted would be fully respected by Australia.<br />
I went on to explain what we were doing in our section<br />
of New Guinea in pursuit of our long-held goal of improvement<br />
of living standards, education, and health to a point where the<br />
population could freely determine its own future. I will refer<br />
to this again, a little later. I said that the Dutch were<br />
pursuing broadly similar policies, with the same objective.<br />
The General enquired as to whether Australia did not<br />
have some military arrangement with the Netherlands in respect<br />
of West New Guinea. I said we had no such arrangement, either<br />
directly or indirectly, and that whatever might be rumoured or<br />
suggested to the contrary had no foundation. The only<br />
agreement related to administrative consultation on common<br />
problems and for the forwarding of self-determination in New<br />
Guinea. That agreem nt was published when it was made on<br />
November 6, 1957. I recall to Hon. members the principles set<br />
out in that agreement as follows<br />
1. The Netherlands and Australian Governments base their<br />
policies with regard to the territories of New Guinea,<br />
for which they are responsible, on the interests and<br />
inalienable rights of their inhabitants in conformity<br />
with the provisions and the spirit of the United<br />
Nations Charter.<br />
2. The territories of Netherlands New Guinea, the<br />
Australian Trust Territory of New Guinea, and Papua,<br />
are geographically and ethnologically related and<br />
future development of their respective populations<br />
must benefit from co-operation in policy and<br />
administration.<br />
3. The Australian and Netherlands Governments are<br />
therefore pursuing, and will continue to pursue,<br />
policies directed towards the political, economic,<br />
social and educational advancement of the peoples in<br />
their territories in a manner which recognizes this<br />
ethnological and geographical affinity.<br />
4. At the same time, the two Governments will continue,<br />
and strengthen, the co-operation at present existing<br />
between their respective administrations in the<br />
territories. In so -c'ing the two Governments are determined to<br />
promote an uninterrupted development of this process<br />
until such time as the inhabitants of the territories<br />
concerned will be in a position to determine their own<br />
future. </p>
<p>At the same time, I said, not only Australia but other<br />
nations could not but be disturbed by any use of force, since<br />
even limited hostilities, whether in New Guinea or Laos or<br />
elsewhere, could have unforeseen and deplorable consequences. We<br />
were therefore glad to have the General's renewed assurances that<br />
force would not be used. I will refer to this again, a little<br />
later. I took the opportunity of asking about the infiltrations<br />
which were reported to have occurred along the West New Guinea<br />
coast. The General replied that there had been some<br />
infiltrations some of those concerned being armed; that such<br />
cases were not due to any policy of the Central GovCrnnent, but<br />
arose from some unavoidable lack of control in particular areas;<br />
and that there had been some infiltration in reverse from West<br />
New Guinea to the eastern islands of Indonesia, inspired he<br />
said, by the Dutch for the purpose of fomenting disaffection in<br />
those islands. In answer to a question, he agreed that there<br />
was no suggestion that the Dutch were contemplating any form of<br />
conquest, but maintained that their actions were a form of<br />
subversion. I have stated without coiment these remarks by the<br />
General, so that the House nay have a balanced picture of our<br />
discussions. To conclude this phase of ry report, I should refer to<br />
two other aspects of the matter.<br />
As has been frequently pointed out in this House, the<br />
native inhabitants of New Guinea have no ethnological<br />
association with Indonesia. General Nasution retorts to this<br />
that there are several distinct ethnic groups in Indonesia, and<br />
yet they are within one political structure, and that Malayan<br />
is widely spoken in West New Guinea.<br />
In answer to this we have pointed out that the indigenous<br />
inhabitants of the island of New Guinea have more in common, both<br />
ethnologically and otherwise, than any of them have with the<br />
various races of Indonesia, anr: that this is a factor which<br />
should not be ignored.<br />
But General Nasution adds to this another point. In<br />
answer to our enphasis upon ulti-iato self-determination for both<br />
sections of New Guinea ho contends that West New Guinea ahould be<br />
( and, as he would say, is) part of Indonesia, and that there is<br />
no nore reason for conceding self-deternination to West New<br />
Guinea than to any other racial group or geographical area in<br />
Indonesia. This neant that Indonesia rejected the idea of selfdetermination<br />
for the people of West New Guinea. It was further<br />
made clear that the only form of trusteeship acceptable to<br />
Indonesia would not be one under the Charter of the United<br />
Nations, but would be one for the purpose of transferring West<br />
New Guinea to Indonesia after a brief intervening period,<br />
Having roeard to this view, I carefully developed our<br />
views on self-deturnination, and now record then for the House.<br />
In our own New Guinea territories, our policy is, by<br />
steady degrees and up to the linits of our financial and<br />
administrative capacity, to promote the advancement of jthe<br />
people so that ultimately they will choose for themselves<br />
their own constitution and their future relationship with<br />
us. We will respect their choice whatever it nay be. This,<br />
for us, is not a new policy. We have pursued it for years. </p>
<p>It arises from our sense of responsibility, a responsibility<br />
which cannot be suddenly or prematurely abandoned if our<br />
trusteeship is to be honourably performed.<br />
Having regard to these undoubted facts, Indonesia cannot<br />
reasonably expect Australia to take, nor will Australia<br />
take, an initiative in a procedure designed to lead to a<br />
handing over of sovereignty and the abandonment of the<br />
right of self-deternination in the trritory concerned.<br />
That was, and is, the reason why Australia is most<br />
definitely not prepared to put pressure on the Netherlands<br />
to negotiate for the transfer of sovereignty and the<br />
abandonnent of self-deternination.<br />
In other words, we recognise Dutch sovereignty, we deal<br />
with the Netherlands as a sovereign power, and we approve of<br />
the policy of ultimate self-determination which has been<br />
adopted by the Netherlands in relation to West New Guinea.<br />
If this is regarded by Indonesia as partisanship, we point<br />
out that it favours the recognition of sovereignty and the<br />
objective of self-determination, to both of which Australia<br />
is inevitably attached.<br />
But on such matters the Netherlands, as the sovereign<br />
power, will nake, quite freely, its own decisions. Those<br />
decisions will be recognised and respected by us.<br />
We are on most friendly terns with the Dutch, as,<br />
renenbering the last war, we ought to be. We are also<br />
close to and friendly with Indonesia. What Australia has<br />
done in the United Nations when the West New Guinea item<br />
has cone up there, is to support sovereignty and doncstic<br />
jurisdiction. Sovereignty is basic for Australia nc loss<br />
than to others, including Indonesia. None of this is<br />
hostile to Indonesia, and it ought not to be thought so,<br />
Before I conclude, I return to the matter of military<br />
involvement. I repeat, in the rost categorical terms, that<br />
Australia has no military conmitnent with the Netherlands in<br />
relation to West Now Guinea, lirect or indLirect. But armned<br />
conflict in that country, whether arising fron mass invasion or<br />
limited guerilla episodes created by armed infiltration, would<br />
present Australia, in cor. ion with other countries, with a grave<br />
problem. Any such conflict could certainly not be ignored by<br />
the United Nations. It would engage the attention, helpful or<br />
otherwise, of the great powers. It would threaten world peace,<br />
and could well bring disaster to South-East Asia by its<br />
encouragement of Conmunist activity and intervention.<br />
It is therefore necessary to nake our position quite<br />
clear. We stand for peaceful negotiation at all tines,<br />
provided that such negotiation is conducted without the threat<br />
of force of any shape or kind.<br />
I have stated our recognition of Dutch sovereignty, and<br />
our approval of the Dutch policy of self-detormination. We<br />
have entered into no military cor. nitment beyond those involved<br />
in the Charter of the United Nations. But if nilitary<br />
conflicts, groat or snall, arose out of these differences, new<br />
and grave problens , wuldar ise for many nations, including our<br />
own. It is for this reason that the runewed assurances of<br />
peaceful pursuit of Indonesia's clains, made by General Nasution,<br />
are of such profound importance and international value.<br />
Before I conclude this section of my statenent I would<br />
like to say that we were all impressed by General Nasution's<br />
frankness and personality. I an sure that he and his wife </p>
<p>enjoyed their visit to Australia. Every opportunity was given<br />
to the General by the press, broadcasting and television<br />
stations, to express his views. I know that he appreciated<br />
this, as we do. He has left Australia after faithfully and<br />
ably representing his own couhtry, with, I an certain, a<br />
confidence in his own mind that, while his visit nay not have<br />
changed our policies, it has certainly made a powerful<br />
contribution to our common understanding and good will.<br />
LAOS Since I last spoke to the House on Tuesday, llth<br />
April, new and important developnents in the continuing crisis<br />
in Laos have occurred.<br />
In Moscow, negotiations have at last resulted in a<br />
measure of agreement between the Soviet and the United Kingdom<br />
Governnents as Co-Chairnea of the Geneva Conference of 1954<br />
which settled the Indo-China conflict.<br />
The United Kingdom Government has acted throughout<br />
these negotiations in close consultation with its friends. We<br />
hope and believe that the Soviet Government did likewise, for<br />
the value of the new agreement will lepend largely on its being<br />
respected by other conbers of the Commnnunist Bloc.<br />
The arrangements agreed upon are, in brief, that<br />
the Co-Chairmen should call for a cease-fire in Laos<br />
which should be arranged by the Laotian combatants<br />
themselves. This call was issued on 24th April;<br />
the Indian Government, as Chairman of the International<br />
Control Commission for Las, was invited to reconvene that<br />
Commission in Now Delhi. The Connission is to report to<br />
the Co-Chairomn and to receive instructions from then on<br />
the Commission's functions in controlling the cease-fire.<br />
( The Indian High CoJnissionor in Australia, Mr, Sen, has<br />
been chosen by his Government to repr.. ent it as Chc-rman<br />
on this Commission. do welcome tiis, f. r. Mr. Sen has a<br />
close knowledge of Laos, and a wide understanding of the<br />
problems involved.)<br />
an international conference on Laos should be<br />
convened in Geneva on 12th May.<br />
Invitations have already been issued for the proposed<br />
international conference which will be attended by 14 nations<br />
Those will comprise<br />
The nine nations who net in Geneva in 1954<br />
Communist China, United Kingdom, United States, France.<br />
Laos, Cambodia anl North and South Vietnam).<br />
The three-nation members of the International Con.: r: o<br />
Commission ( India, Canada and Poland).<br />
The other two nations who border on Laos ( Thailand and<br />
Burma).<br />
( Pending the establishment of a Government of Laos which is<br />
accepted by both sides, it will be for the conference to<br />
determine how Laos : hould be represented at the conference<br />
I make the following observations. </p>
<p>6.<br />
First, no explicit condition has been recorded by the<br />
Co-Chairnen that the cease-fire must take place prior to the<br />
convening of the international conference. Arrangements for the<br />
negotiation of a cease-fire are placed in effect in the hands of<br />
the various Laotian elements. I believe that the representatives<br />
of the Laotian Government, headed by Prince Boun Oum which I<br />
should add is regarded as the constitutional government of Laos<br />
by the Australian Government as well as by the Governments of<br />
the United Kingdon, United States and other countries will<br />
co-operate actively in making the necessary practical arrangements<br />
for an immediate cease-fire. We can only hope that other<br />
Laotian elements will adopt a similar attitude.<br />
Both the United States and United Kingdom Governments<br />
have made it clear that they will not be prepared to attend the<br />
proposed international conference until they are satisfied that<br />
a cease-fire has in fact occurred in Laos. The point has great<br />
importance. It is out of the question to confer on ways and<br />
means of ensuring the future independence and neutrality of Laos<br />
a policy of non-interference by Western powers and Coxrmunist<br />
powers alike if fighting is contihuing in Laos and new<br />
military threats are added to the recent series of offensive<br />
operations by the Pathet Lao. Those operations have won<br />
important and increasingly dangerous gains for the insurgents.<br />
They have been supported by the Soviet air lift of arms into<br />
Laos and by overland transport of supplies from Connunist North<br />
Vietnam as well as by some military personnel from North<br />
Vietnam. Both Luang Prabang and Vientiane the two capitals<br />
are now threatened by these offensive operations. The most<br />
important of then occurred simultaneously with the final stages<br />
of the recent negotiations in Moscow.<br />
Second, the Australian Government has long been<br />
determined to support genuine negotiations of a peaceful<br />
solution of the Laotian problem. At the same time we have made<br />
it clear by our recent association with the S. E. A. T. O.<br />
corlunique of 29th March, that we are united with our Allies<br />
also in our determination to prevent armed Comnunist doninf; tion<br />
of Laos. This being cle-r, there is now . r better -rospec-of<br />
coming to an agreement, by negotiation, on a solution which will<br />
satisfy all legitimate interests and avoid ar. The comm. on<br />
ground is the desire of the Laotian people, the iostern and<br />
neutral powers and ( as we hope) the Corjunist powers, that Laos<br />
should be a genuinely neutral State under a national government<br />
representing all responsible opinion.<br />
Third, the problem of Laos has not been solved. It<br />
is an economically weak State, lacking social and political<br />
cohesion. It will always be exposed to pressures, open and<br />
clandestine, from its Cormunist neighbours. It will be the<br />
task of the conference to try to devise ways of relieving it<br />
from this pressure. The security of South-East Asia depends<br />
on Laos being neutral and free from Conmunist or any other<br />
domination. The next three or four weeks will rve:.. how r. ucco-<br />
operation we can expect from the Ccmmunist powers in these<br />
efforts to establish by peaceful negotiation the fri:.. Av. ork fo.<br />
Laotian security, independence and neutrality.<br />
4 eL </p>
<p>7.<br />
SIERRA LEONE I draw the attention of the House to the fact that<br />
Sierra Leone, one of the oldest British territories in West<br />
Africa, will attain its formal independence today, 27th April.<br />
Sierra Leone last year declared its intention of applying for<br />
membership of the Commonwealth and at the Prime Ministers'<br />
Conference last month, ww elcomed its entry, subject to the<br />
usual constitutional processes. These processes are now<br />
complete and I have received a message from Sir Miltrn Margai,<br />
Prime Minister of Sierra Leone expressing appreciation for the<br />
acceptance of Sierra Leone as a full member of the Cormonwealth.<br />
Australia is represented at the independence<br />
celebrations in Freetown this week, at which H. R. H. the Duke of<br />
Kent is representing Her Majesty. Lord Casey, who, as Minister<br />
for External Affairs, had so much to . o with developing our<br />
relations with newly independent countries in Asia and Africa,<br />
kindly agreed to attend on our behalf. He is accompanied by Mr.<br />
D. O. Hay, our High Coriissioner designate to Canada, who is on<br />
his way to his new posting.<br />
Sierra Leone is not a large country, but by no means an<br />
unimportant one. The cmrse of its constituti.. nal development<br />
towards independence has been smooth and peaceful, in full<br />
agreement and co-operation with the United Kingdon. It will be<br />
a valuable addition to the Commonwealth group in West Africa.<br />
In the past, Australia has had little contact with Sierra Leone,<br />
but we look forward to the development of close and friendly<br />
relations within the brotherhood of the Commonwealth, and will<br />
be glad to offer the new nation any assistance within our<br />
capacity. I feel sure that all Honourable members will join me<br />
in extending a warn welcome to our nJwest Commonwealth mrber<br />
and in expressing our sincere good wishes for the future welfare<br />
and prosperity of Sierra Leone and its people. </p>
