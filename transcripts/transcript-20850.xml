    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Federal Government welcomes the findings of the PriceWaterhouseCoopers independent review of the way the Australian Red Cross managed its Bali Appeal.  The review concludes that there was no evidence of fraud or misuse of donor funds and that the Australian Red Cross coped remarkably well given the complexity of responding to such an emergency.</p>
<p>The Australian Red Cross has worked hard to support the victims of the Bali tragedy and their families and friends and I appreciate the way in which it has co-operated with the Government on this matter. There are always lessons to be learned from activities such as this and we will work with the Australian Red Cross to take full account of the PriceWaterhouseCoopers review.</p>
<p>Australian Red Cross volunteers are dedicated and compassionate people who work hard in Australia and overseas to care for those in crisis.  The findings of the PriceWaterhouseCoopers report have demonstrated that Australians can be assured that their generous donations to the Australian Red Cross will continue to be used to help those most in need.</p>
