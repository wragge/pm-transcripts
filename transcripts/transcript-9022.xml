PRIME MINISTER<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON. P. J. KEATING<br />
LODGE TABLE<br />
Given the current interest in the matter of the<br />
replacement dining table for the Lodge the following,<br />
facts may be of interest to the media.<br />
The need for a replacement dining table for the Lodge was<br />
first raised by Mrs Hazel Hawke in 1991. She indicated<br />
at the time that a replacement table was the last major<br />
outstanding item to be settled under the Lodge's<br />
refurbishment program. It was widely acknowledged that<br />
the existing table was unsuitable for the many large<br />
official functions held at the Lodge.<br />
The matter was raised again in early 1992 but it was not<br />
until November 20 of that year that I discussed the need<br />
for a replacement table with members of the Australiana<br />
Fund.<br />
At that meeting it was agreed that a suitable period<br />
dining table, probably from London, could cost up to<br />
$ 150,000 and that this expense could not be justified.<br />
I suggested it may be possible to commission a less<br />
expensive reproduction table through a local manufacturer<br />
or supplierz, and mentioned Mr Paul Kenny as one<br />
possibility. Mr Kenny is acknowledged as one of the few<br />
leading suppliers of tables of this type and his<br />
expertise and standing is widely recogni. sed within the<br />
industry and by Ms Betteridge herself.<br />
It was agreed at the meeting that Ms Betteridge approach<br />
suitable people or firms, including Mr Kenny, to<br />
undertake some preliminary investigation and costing.<br />
Ms Betteridge's investigations revealed thaL Mr Kenny had<br />
a table under construction which might be suitable at a<br />
cost of $ 25,000. Contemporary Australian furniture<br />
makers and individual craftsmen were also approached but </p>
<p>their quotes ranged from $ 40,000 to $ 60,000 for a table<br />
of equivalent size.<br />
MS Be~ teridge subsequently inspected the table and<br />
provided me with a photograph. Preliminary arrangements<br />
were also made for members of the Australiana Fund to<br />
inspect the table. The table was delivered to the Lodge<br />
" ion approval" on or about June 9.<br />
While this sequence of events was unfolding, the<br />
Australiana Fund was also considering whether the Fund<br />
itself was the appropriate vehicle for purchase of the<br />
table, or whether it would be preferable to procure it<br />
through the annual budget for official establishments.<br />
I did receive a preliminary indication that some members<br />
of the Acquisitions Committee of thle Fund might consider<br />
that the table fell outside its purchasing guidelines.<br />
But when I met the chairman of the Australiana Fund, Mr<br />
Walton, at an offircial function he told me there was<br />
still a possibility of the Fund buying the table given<br />
the difficulty of obtaining an alternative at reasonable<br />
cost. He told me the matter would be discussed at the<br />
next meeting of the Fund, to be held within weeks.<br />
Against this background my of tice advised the Department<br />
not to settle t1he account with Mr Kenny until the matter<br />
was finally decided by the Australiana Fund.<br />
When it became clear the Fund would not purchase the<br />
table I decided against paying for the table from the<br />
annual departmental budget for the Lodge, and arranged<br />
for the table to be returned to Mr Kenny and had the old<br />
table re-installed.<br />
I then telephoned Ms Betteridge to tell her the table had<br />
been returned and to express my disappointment that the<br />
matter was still unresolved, a full two years after Mrs<br />
Hawke had first raised it and to express my disquiet<br />
about the serious inaccuracies and reflections on my role<br />
in the many notes for file she had written.<br />
Two months later I learnt of Ms Betteridge's decision to<br />
accept a redundancy package via a television news report.<br />
The secretary of the Prime Minister's department has<br />
advised that to date 19 ofters of voluntary redundancy<br />
have been accepted by PM&amp; C officers and that the<br />
Depar~ nenL expects eventually to abolish 25 positions.<br />
in Lhe two years since this was first raised there have<br />
been conflicting accounts of events.<br />
At the heart of this confusion so far as I was concerned<br />
was conrininuing doubt about the eligibility of the<br />
proposed table for purchase by the Australiana Fund. </p>
<p>In any event, I have always believed that a new table for<br />
the Lodge was desirable but not at taxpayers' expense.<br />
If a suitable table could be found at reasonable cost and<br />
that cost borne by the Fund which is tinanced by<br />
donations and events such as ' open days' at official<br />
establishments well and good. if not, then there should<br />
be no new table.<br />
Needless to say, I do not intenid to reopen the matter and<br />
the old table will remain in use for the forseeable<br />
future.<br />
Attached is a letter sent by the chairman of the<br />
Australiana Fund to its members and copied to me which<br />
may provide fur~ her useful background.<br />

September 13, 1993<br />
Dear Member,<br />
The recent spate of publicity regarding the possibility of the Australiana Fund<br />
acquiring a Dining Room Table for The Lodge has prompted me as your<br />
Chairman to write this letter.<br />
Following a request from Mrs Hawke in October 1991, the Fund has recognsed<br />
the need to replace the table that was purchased for The Lodge in 1981<br />
following the extension of the dining room to create more seating capacity. In<br />
fact I responded to Mrs Hawke's letter indicating that the Fund would be<br />
delighted to work with her in acquiring a table which not only captured the<br />
spirit of the 1920' s, thereby enhancing the Lodge, but which would also offer a<br />
pleasing and practical solution to the then present problems.<br />
Despite widespread inquiries and searching it proved impossible to find an<br />
appropriate original replacement table. It seemed that the only solution would<br />
be to commission the required piece. This was in fact discussed with members<br />
of the Fund Council when they met with Mr and Mrs Keating at The Lodge in<br />
November of last year. Although my unexpected hospitalization prevented me<br />
attending, I understand the question of commissioning a dining room table,<br />
possibly made of Thai mahogany, was canvassed at that meeting.<br />
Subsequently a number of discussions took place involving various people,<br />
including our fine arts adviser, Margaret Betteridge. The matter of the<br />
purchase of the Thai table was considered by the Acquisitions Committee who<br />
recommended rejection. It was never put to a vote of the Council or of the<br />
Official Establishments Trust.<br />
When the request to consider this acquisition was recently made, I indicated<br />
that the Council was scheduled to meet at the end of August and the matter<br />
would be decided at that meeting. Before this scheduled meeting took place<br />
there was some unexpected, unfortunate and uninformed press comments<br />
regarding the possible purchase of the table. Concurrently I was advised by<br />
certain members of the Acquisitions Committee of their strong views in the<br />
matter. We were subsequently informed that the Prime Minister had decided<br />
not to proceed with the acquisition of the table and that it had been returned to<br />
the dealer who had commissioned the work. </p>
<p>-2-<br />
There have been a number of previous occasions where the incumbents of the<br />
Official Establishments have been of a different view to the Acquisitions<br />
Committee. The Rojo bookcase, the Devlin silver candlesticks, the De Maestre<br />
murals are a few cases in point. In each instance the feelings of the occupants<br />
have been given considerable weight in the final decision of Council,<br />
notwithstanding the recommendations of the Acquisitions Committee.<br />
It is after all Their Excellencies and the Prime Minister and his wife ( who has in<br />
every instance been President of the Fund) who make the success, perhaps even<br />
existence, of the Fund possible. They allow the Open Days and other fund<br />
raising events, provide generous hospitality to our members and donors,<br />
occupy the houses that are used for the display of our collection, financially<br />
contribute to any necessary restoration work through their departments, and<br />
generally provide considerable assistance and support for our endeavours.<br />
Without this spirit of mutual co-operation, with communication and<br />
understanding on both sides, the Fund would almost certainly wither and<br />
gradually die.<br />
We have received the fullest support from the present occupants of the Houses,<br />
and I was very pleased to announce Mrs Keating's acceptance of the Presidency<br />
of the Fund at our 1992 Annual Meeting. Fortunately my concern for working<br />
in close co-operation with the Governor General and Prime Minister and their<br />
wives is shared by my fellow members of the Council. This is not to say that<br />
where there may be different views, these should not be resolved in a spirit of<br />
sensible negotiation wherever possible.<br />
I do reiterate that the question of the purchase of the particular table was not<br />
formally considered by the Council as when Council met there was no longer<br />
any decision to be made. You will however be pleased to know that Council<br />
has unanimously resolved to have the Fund participate in the acquisition or<br />
commissioning of an appropriate dining room table for The Lodge, to be<br />
selected with the acquiescence and approval of the Prime Minister and Mrs<br />
Keating. Already we have had approaches from a number of craftsmen<br />
wishing to become involved in such a project.<br />
Further, in view of a recent inaccurate article in the Australian Financial Review<br />
regarding the whole sorry episode, I must set the record straight on the<br />
acquisition of the Geoffrey Hannah cabinet which proudly adorns the hail of<br />
Government House. We are fortunate that Mrs Hayden spotted this unique<br />
contemporary piece in an exhibition at the State library of NSW and referred it<br />
to the Fund. The Acquisitions Committee, with one person dissenting,<br />
recommended its purchase, a recommendation which was unanimously<br />
endorsed by the Council and The Official Establishments Trust. The piece was<br />
paid for in two Instalments, was sponsored to the extent of $ 25,000 by World<br />
Book Encyclopaedia, and is probably worth double its $ 92,000 price tag today.<br />
The public reaction to the piece has been overwhelmingly favourable and in the<br />
opinion of almost all Fund members who have enjoyed the hospitality of Their<br />
Excellencies, it is a most appropriate item for the collection. </p>

Finally, since Its inception in 1978 the Australiana Fund has prided itself on<br />
being an apolitical organisation. This also is obviously critical to its future.<br />
Regrettably, whilst most members who have been recently approached by the<br />
Press have declined to comment, some statements have been made and stories<br />
leaked, which on the surface appear to be Politically motivated. Clearly it is<br />
Crucial that we maintain an apolitical stance to ensure the continued support of<br />
the public, our corporate donors, the occupants, and thus the viability of the<br />
Fund. This is especially so with the possibility of a Republic just around the<br />
corner. Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or commnents on<br />
the above rather lengthy diatribe. Meanwhile, let us get on with the job of<br />
mending fences, regaining our momentum, and working together to enhance<br />
the Fund.<br />
With warm regards,<br />
JOHNL WALION </p>
