PRIME MINISTER'S VISIT TO EUROPE<br />
The Prime Minister, Mr. Whitlam, announced today that<br />
arrangements were being finalised for him to visit a number of<br />
European countries over a period of five weeks in December and<br />
January. Leaving Australia on 14 December, Mr. Whitlan would visit<br />
Belgium, Britain and Ireland before Christmas, and thereafter he<br />
hoped to visit Malta, Greece, the Netherlands, France, Italy,<br />
Yugoslavia, the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic of Germany.<br />
In Brussels he would call on the European Commission. He proposed<br />
to take the opportunity afforded by overnight stops to and from<br />
Europe to have discussions with the Prime Ministers of Sri Lanka<br />
and Bangladesh. He will also have a brief meeting in Islamabad.<br />
with President Bhutto of Pakistan, on his return flight from<br />
Europe. Recalling that his previously planned visit to Europe<br />
in the past northern summer ( June/ July) had had to be deferred<br />
because of the elections in May, Mr. Whitlam stated that he regarded<br />
the visit as of sufficient importance to be undertaken at the<br />
earliest convenient opportunity. His absence from Australia<br />
would coincide with a period when Parliament was in recess.<br />
The visit would represent a major step forward in<br />
establishing or expanding relationships at the highest level<br />
of Government between Australia and the countries of Europe.<br />
Consultations at the Head of Government level are essential<br />
to the establishment of a basic understanding and framework<br />
within which mutual interests can be identified and pursued.<br />
It is important that the nations of Europe fully appreciate<br />
the development of Australia's foreign policy since 1972,<br />
particularly countries with wqhich Australia has such major trading<br />
relationships and important migration and cultural ties.<br />
The visit will help make up for neglect by previous Governments<br />
and provide opportunities for improved relationships in the future.<br />
Mr. Whitlam said no previous Australian Prime Minister<br />
had paid an official visit to-Italy, Yugoslavia or the Soviet<br />
Union. The last Australian Prime Minister to pay an official<br />
visit to Europe had been Sir Robert Menzies, more than a decade<br />
ago. </p>
<p>The intervening years had seen developments in Europe<br />
of enormous significance, not only for the Continent itself,<br />
but also for relationships between the major powers and for<br />
countries like Australia which had traditional economic,<br />
commercial and cultural ties with many European countries. It<br />
was not widely appreciated, perhaps, that the European Community<br />
was Australia's second largest market for exports after Japan<br />
and the largest source of Australia's imports. Important<br />
financial and commercial interests had been built~ up between<br />
Australia and Europe. Mr Whitlam noted that his visit to the<br />
European Commission will be the first by an Australian Prime<br />
Minister since the Community's formation.<br />
Western Europe had moved towards a degree of political<br />
and economic integration that made it an entity of major<br />
importance with which Australia needed to develop and deepen<br />
a whole range of contacts. The countries of the Western world,<br />
of which Australia was one, were working to solve unprecedented<br />
economic and financial problems. The Soviet Union, one of the<br />
two Super Powers, was a part of Europe and its policies were of<br />
crucial importance to the development of the continent in peace<br />
and security. Mr Whitlam said he believed a visit by an<br />
Australian Head of Government would give particular stress to<br />
our recognition of the importance Europe had for Australia i~ n an<br />
increasingly interdependent world. Amongst the matters he would<br />
discuss in Europe would be the food and energy situations which<br />
had the widest implications for the achievement of a world<br />
order based on equity and stability.<br />
A particular aspect of his itinerary which would give<br />
him great pleasure, and to which he wished to draw attention,<br />
concerned his visits to countries, other than Britain~ from which<br />
large numbers of migrants had settled in Australia in the postwar<br />
years. These countries included Italy, Greece, Malta and<br />
Yugoslavia. He would make a point in conveying to leaders of<br />
government in these countries Australia's gratitude for the<br />
contribution which their migrants had made to the economic and<br />
cultural development of Australia.<br />
His visit to Greece would be the first by a Head of<br />
Government since the restoration of democracy in that country.<br />
The visits to Moscow and Paris will mean that the<br />
Australian Prime Minister, having previously exchanged views<br />
with the leaders of the United States, Britain and China, will<br />
have met the leaders of the five nuclear powers and permanent<br />
members of the Security Council. In seeking such contacts in<br />
Europe, Mr Whitlam said, he would have as a further objective<br />
to build with the leaders of modern Europe the same close<br />
relationships as he had developed with national leaders in<br />
Asia and North America. </p>
<p>In summary, Mr. Whitlam said the visits were important<br />
because of Europe's position as Australia's largest trading<br />
partner; its significance as a source of international finance<br />
and its crucial position in the world monetary system; its<br />
advanced technological situation, particularly in emergy matters;<br />
and its significance as a source of migrants and of culture for<br />
Australia. In view of the importance of the visits, Mr. Lionel<br />
Bowen, the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister and Special<br />
Minister of State, will travel with Mr. Whitlam. Mr. Whitlam<br />
will use a Qantas charter aircraft and will be accompanied by<br />
his wife, members of his personal staff and representatives<br />
of government departments with a prime interest in the visit,<br />
including the Secretaries of the Departments of Minerals and<br />
Energy and of Overseas Trade, and Deputy Secretaries of the<br />
Department of Foreign Affairs and of the Department of the Prime<br />
Minister and Cabinet, and a senior Treasury official.<br />
