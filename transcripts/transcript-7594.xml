IERGY 8<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 12 MAY 1989<br />
1989 is the 125th anniversary of the International Red Cross<br />
and Red Crescent movement and these organisations have taken<br />
this opportunity to appeal internationally for special<br />
humanitarian gestures to mark this occasion.<br />
Successive Australian Governments have given support to the<br />
ICRC in its assistance to the victims of natural and other<br />
disasters and tragedies throughout the world.<br />
My Government strongly supports the endeavours of the Red<br />
Cross and Red Crescent movement. In response to their<br />
current appeal, I am providing them today, through Mr Alan<br />
McLean, the Secretary General of the Australian Red Cross<br />
Society, with a cheque for $ 250,000 for use in assisting<br />
those devastated by the current bloodshed and civil<br />
disruption in Lebanon.<br />
I have in recent days met representatives of the Lebanese<br />
community who have brought home to me again the desperate<br />
plight of their friends and relatives in their once<br />
harmonious land. I believe that a humanitarian offering to<br />
those people is something which all Australian would fully<br />
endorse. As I have announced separately today, the Government is also<br />
providing $ 250,000 to Lebanon through the appeal recently<br />
launched by the United Nations Secretary-General.<br />
I take this opportunity to express the deep appreciation of<br />
the Australian Government to the Australian Red Cross<br />
Society, which in 1989 is celebrating its 75th anniversary,<br />
for the magnificent work it continues to do. ; 84 I </p>
