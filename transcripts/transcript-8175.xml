TRANSCRIPT OF NEWS CONFERENCEj PARLIAMIENT HU~<br />
BRISBANE, 30 OCTOBER 1990<br />
R3A019 PROOF ONLY<br />
JOURNALIST: What sort of a day did you have?<br />
PM: It was an excellent day. You'll appreciate that<br />
it's not appropriate for me to go into details about<br />
what's been done because while we've covered the agenda<br />
there is some fine tuning to be done on the communique<br />
and that will be considered by my colleagues tomorrow<br />
morning. we anticipate we'll be in a position to have a<br />
joint press conference, myself with all the other<br />
Government leaders, I would think not long after<br />
10.00 o'clock tomorrow morning and we will then of<br />
course, go to all the detail of the issues on which we've<br />
agreed. But may I say this that the meeting has exceeded<br />
my expectations and you know by nature I'm pretty much an<br />
Optimist. Those expectations have all been exceeded and<br />
I certainly want to pay tribute as I'll do in more<br />
detail tomorrow to my colleagues from the States and<br />
the representatives of Local Government. The meeting was<br />
characterised by a totally constructive spirit and in the<br />
result we have been able to make a range of decisions<br />
which without any question will significantly improve the<br />
governance of Australia and I believe will lead to<br />
significant improvements in terms of economic<br />
performance, of competitiveness, and very importantly, in<br />
the delivery of services to the Australian people.<br />
JOUR~ NALIST; Why can't you tell us what they are, Mr<br />
Hawke? PM: Because there's a finalisation of the communique<br />
that has to be undertaken and there will be another<br />
session tomorrow morning. It's conceivable, Laurie, that<br />
overnight in regard to some of the issues there'll be<br />
some desire to re-word some of the positions that we've<br />
got and I don't want, by saying something tonight about<br />
details, to pre-empt in an~ vay the capacity of the<br />
leaders to address some points of detail tomorrow. But<br />
and I mean I'm not trying to I can say to you that<br />
if you go to the agenda areas, first of all in the area<br />
of Commonwealth/ State financial relations that there has<br />
been agreed a process to the satisfaction of both the<br />
commonwealth and the States whereby those issues of<br />
concern to the States and ourselves are going to be </p>
<p>reviewed with the aim of redressing the concerns that<br />
exist. In the area of micro-economic reform, significant<br />
decisions have been made in the area of rail and road<br />
which details we'll give to you tomorrow. And<br />
JOURNALIST: But all we're getting is rhetoric the same<br />
as we got thi~ s morning.<br />
PH: That's if you want to be cynical about it.<br />
JOURNALIST: I'm not being cynical<br />
PM: Well you are being cynical because you will not<br />
listen to you don't want to accept the indisputable<br />
point I'm making to you that there'* s another session of<br />
the Conference tomorrow morning and we have reached<br />
positions which are to be finalised in the statement of<br />
outcome tomoi'row morning..<br />
JOURNALIST: Is there anything outstanding in the fiscal<br />
0 investigation area though, Hr Hawke, or is that finished?<br />
PH: No, we've got no further discussions on that and I<br />
JOURNALIST: So could we get the details of that?<br />
PM: No, I'm saying that the finalised communique is<br />
being prepared tonight arnd I can't, you know, take the<br />
view that when that's being considered tomorrow there may<br />
not be some finer paints of detail that my colleagues may<br />
not wish to clo to. But what I can say to you and<br />
because I don,' t want to pre-empt any rights they may want<br />
to exercise tomorrow morning that I believe their<br />
concerns and ours in regard to the area of taxing powers.<br />
and examination of that issue has been satisfactorily<br />
arrived at arid also the processes for looking at tied<br />
grants that that's been satisfactorily arrived at. As<br />
I've gone to already in the area of micro-economic<br />
reform, in the area of road and rail, significant<br />
decisions have been made there, including I'll give you<br />
this detail, there will be signed tomorrow agreement on<br />
the establishment of a National Rail Freight Corporation.<br />
Also agreemnent in the area of work on looking at the<br />
question of complimentary arrangements in the area of<br />
electricity generation. In the area of moving towards<br />
national standards and national uniformity in the area of<br />
road usage and charges for road usage. So those areas<br />
which you know are on the agenda have been the subject<br />
now of agreement by the Commonwealth and the states.<br />
JOURNALIST: Largely in the form that they were in the<br />
agenda? PH: To a very substantial extent but this is why I must<br />
reserve the right to go to the final details of these<br />
matters tomorrow because<br />
JOURNALIST: how much do you </p>
<p>PM: Just let me finish.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister<br />
PM: Look, I'm just saying to one other interjector could<br />
I finish the answer to the previous question and that is<br />
JOURNALIST: We can't hear you very well, Mr Hawke.<br />
PM; Well I'm sorry about that. Where there has been<br />
some departure or addition to what's been in the working<br />
papers that you've seen, that is now being refined. Some<br />
of the language is being refined overnight and it may be<br />
that in their consideration they may want to change some<br />
of the areas that I think we have reached agreement on.<br />
I'm simply being very cautious in this because I don't<br />
want to be in a position where it can be said by my<br />
colleagues who are going to meet again tomorrow morning<br />
in session at 9.00 o'clock that they have in any way been<br />
pre-empted. They will obviously have no objection to the<br />
indications that I've given in this Conference so far to<br />
the areas of agreement and the nature of agreement.<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you accept the basic principle sought by<br />
all the States and that is that they should have revenue<br />
raising powers which are comparable with their functions<br />
and responsibilities?<br />
PH: What you will find has been accepted is that there<br />
should be an aim to reduce the level of vertical fiscal<br />
imbalance and that the working party that we establish<br />
will be directed to achieve that objective consistent<br />
with as we've made clear from my speech first in July<br />
consistent with the necessity for the Commonwealth to be<br />
able to retain its capacity to undertake macro-economic<br />
management. And that point has been accepted by the<br />
States.<br />
JOURNALIST: So you think you can make progress on<br />
PM: I think we can, yes.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, why was the discussion<br />
knocked back by the Premiers on the area of education?<br />
PM: Well they believe, I think, that sufficient momentum<br />
is underway in terms of the Hobart agreement where there<br />
is cooperation taking place on the questions of<br />
curriculum and associated areas. They seem to be<br />
satisfied with the progress that has been made under that<br />
agreement and they didn't want to go further on that.<br />
a~' JOUN~ 34-. a'~ ee . you,.-happy . Lwthr-zhat-;' reaponse'?<br />
PM&amp;_* W4: l.; vw4fthought ' that'this, provided,-pexhaps another<br />
incentive--to movement-but-when it was clear that the </p>
<p>States didn't want to accelerate those processes that are<br />
already underway well we weren't unhappy about that.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, you ' ve made a quite strong push on<br />
our industrial relations performance, our transfer of<br />
powers. What<br />
PH: wait a minute. You say I've made a strong push on<br />
that. You look at what I've said is that, from my point<br />
of view, I think this is an area where there could be<br />
change and somes reference to powers. live made it quite<br />
clear from the beginning that I understand that there is<br />
reluctance in the States on that area. So, as far as I'm<br />
concerned, what I wanted to ensure was that we could, at<br />
least, continue the significant moves to further<br />
cooperation in this area that are already underway.<br />
That's what-the outcome will be.<br />
JOURNALIST: Hr Hawke, timetable do you see f or the<br />
implementation of any decisions made by the taskforce<br />
looking at f iscal relations. When do you think decisions<br />
will be implemented?<br />
PH: We've got a timetable there, and it's accepted by<br />
the States, thiat there's considerable complexity in this.<br />
They accepted that the most appropriate way of going<br />
about this is with a progress report to the first Special<br />
Premiers' Conference in May and finalising the matter by<br />
the November Special Conference.<br />
JOURNALIST: So the decisions would flow after the<br />
November Special Conference.<br />
P14: We would hope so. Yes.<br />
JOURNALIST: The terms of reference have been somewhat<br />
watered down or broadened since the States' paper though,<br />
Mr Hawke. What was the main reason for doing that?<br />
PH: They've ' been what, I'm sorry<br />
JOURNALIST: Broadened or watered down from the States'<br />
paper whidh, for example, included an aim of reducing<br />
tied grants to 30 per cent.<br />
PH: When you say broadened or watered down, I mean, you<br />
really need to make a choice about which one you are<br />
talking about. There is no conflict between the<br />
commonwealth and the States on the way this should be<br />
handled. There's an acceptance that it would not be<br />
appropriate to tie ourselves down to a particular<br />
percentage. If you did that and the working group showed<br />
that it wasn't appropriate, both in the interests of the<br />
States and Commonwealth, to, in the end, have that target<br />
you don't want stencilled in a certainty of failure. I<br />
mean, what they are happy about, what they wanted was a<br />
clear statement of commitment -by. the . CommoinweaIt-h---to a*-</p>
<p>reduction. We've given that clear commitment and they<br />
are entirely happy with that.<br />
JOURNALIST: about some form of income tax sharing.<br />
PH: I'm not -in a position where I say I've got a<br />
committed view about that because, and I'm not trying to<br />
dodge the isslue, what I've said and what's been accepted<br />
without quest-ion by the states is that the commonwealth<br />
has got to retain the capacity to conduct the<br />
macro-economic management of the Australian economy.<br />
That's precisely why we are going to have the working<br />
party in which the best resources of our Treasury and of<br />
theirs will examine these issues. I don't think you can,<br />
without that detailed examination, say what the most<br />
appropriate outcome is. But we have accepted and it,<br />
You'll see, will be reflected in the communique that<br />
there is high commitment to aim at a reduction of the<br />
imbalance. Now how that will be done is precisely a<br />
matter for consideration by the working party and a<br />
progress report to us in May and hopefully then, as I<br />
say, final determination in November of next year. There<br />
is an acceptance of the complexity of this issue. I<br />
don't think the States, for instance, will be saying it's<br />
appropriate to give an answer in advance of that working<br />
party. JOURNALIST: Prime minister<br />
PM: Now just a minute. Go on.<br />
JOURNALIST: Apart from the National Rail Freight<br />
Corporation do you expect any concrete results to be aeen<br />
within the next six months?<br />
P14: Yes, indeed. There is a number of areas in which we<br />
are wanting reports, in say six months, in which we want<br />
reports by our next Special Conference meeting which is<br />
in May and certainly a number of areas we will be getting<br />
decisions by that time.<br />
JOURNALIST: It looks like there are going to be about<br />
seven or iight, you know, committees and working groups<br />
set up in those process. is there a danger that this<br />
is going to look like you've just set up a whole new sort<br />
of bureaucracy<br />
P34: No. Use your loaf. Use your loaf. Look-at the<br />
range of issues. Do you think you'd have one committee,<br />
for instance, looking at tax powers, tied grants, road<br />
charges, rail, regulatory reform, environment, industrial<br />
relations? Do you think you're going to have one working<br />
party dealing with the whole lot of them? You know, by<br />
definition the issues are of such importance and, in<br />
: their-way of-.:. peciality, that you'* ve got have. a working<br />
party . dealing . with each of them. It would be -an -entirely<br />
stupid -expectation, * which * 1' mn-sure you -wou4nt -hav </p>
<p>because you're not a stupid man, that you would have one<br />
committee examiining those disparate issues.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, just on the environment. The<br />
agenda paperis canvassed the option<br />
PM: Are you happy with that answer. Yes good.<br />
JOURNALIST: The agenda papers canvassed the option of an<br />
inter-government. agreement on the environment. Do you<br />
still think that's achievable?<br />
PH: Well you'll see that there's agreement on<br />
establishing a relevant working party to move towards<br />
that position.<br />
ends </p>
