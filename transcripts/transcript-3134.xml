PRIME MINISTER CANBERRA<br />
Embargo: 6 p~ m PRESS STATEMENT NO. 74<br />
23 January 1974<br />
The Prime Minister today approved grants for the crafts, totalling<br />
$ 139,284.<br />
The grants were recommended by the Crafts Board of the Australian<br />
Council for the Arts, and go to all States.<br />
The Chairman of the Crafts Board, Mrs Marea Gazzard, said that<br />
these, as well as last year's grants of $ 199,481, showed a welcome<br />
revival of interest in craft activities. The Board is again calling<br />
for applications for grants from craftsmen throughout Australia to<br />
encourage this interest.<br />
Mrs Gazzard said that the Government's Crafts Inquiry, now fully<br />
active, should bring to light a great deal of information on the<br />
pattern the crafts were taking in Australia, which could be the<br />
basis for future funding.<br />
She added that it was particularly pleasing to see applications<br />
from craftsmen wanting to train apprentices. Many valuable skills<br />
had been lost in the past because craftsmen struggling to survive<br />
had not been able to give time to training young people wishing<br />
to learn a craft.<br />
One grant of $ 3,000 is for the South Australian blacksmith, Richard<br />
G Howard, of Stirling, to take on a trainee. A self-taught craftsman,<br />
he travelled to England and Europe last year on a Churchill Fellowship.<br />
Mrs Gazzard said that blacksmithing, which sounded utilitarian, was<br />
also a fine art in its own right. The British sculptor, Tim Scott,<br />
who will visit Australia next month at the invitation of the Visual<br />
Arts Board, uses smithing techniques in his steel-and-perspex sculptures.<br />
A number of sculpture students from East Sydney Technical College will<br />
this year be attending a blacksmiths' course.<br />
Another $ 3,000 grant goes to Ronald Edwards of Holloways Beach, Queensland,<br />
to research surviving folk crafts in Australia. He will study pioneer<br />
building methods, bush furniture making, the making of greenhide ropes,<br />
fishing nets and traps and many other crafts. By tape-recording, photographing<br />
and making diagrams, he hopes to make it possible for future<br />
craftsmen to exactly reproduce traditional craft items. </p>
