-PRESS OFFICE TRANSCRIPT 5 DECEMBER, 1978<br />
Prime Minister Interviewed on ABC's<br />
by Paul Davey<br />
Report: With 1978 almost at a close, and certainly for Federal<br />
Parliament it already is, how successful has the year<br />
been for the Government? Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser<br />
is keen to point to his Government's success in<br />
sticking to its economic policies which, he says, have<br />
reduced inflation. But on the other hand, Mr. Fraser<br />
was forced to sack one of his senior Ministers during<br />
the year, Senator Reg Withers, the Government Leader<br />
in the Senate and Minister for Administrative Services.<br />
While the Opposition has made much of the propriety<br />
of Mr. Fraser's frontbench during the year, the<br />
Prime Minister believes that Opposition Leader Bill Hayden<br />
has been too " peripheral" in his approach to politics.<br />
Mr. Fraser is talking in Canberra to Paul Davey about<br />
what he sees as his Government's successes during 1978<br />
and what he hopes for 1979.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I think in terms of economic policy and the acceptance of<br />
that policy in areas where it counts, it has been a thoroughly<br />
successful year and inflation has come down more than<br />
many expected. Overseas investment funds are coming into<br />
Australia in a way which a year ago was being so. Interest<br />
rates have started to come down and the one percent reduction<br />
in home interest rates you can either look at it from<br />
an individual point of view on an average loan that's<br />
$ 17 a month or for all people paying interest on home loans<br />
it's about $ 150 million a year. That's the area where you start<br />
to see the very real results of policy. I think there has been<br />
a concentration on peripheral issues in politics and the<br />
particular incident to which you referred in a sense was one<br />
of them. It was once which...<br />
Question Is though, Prime Minister, with respect, the sacking of a<br />
Minister a peripheral issue, in terms of the electorate's thinking<br />
of a Government?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I think that Mr. Hayden has concentrated very much on the<br />
peripheral issues. You've only got to look at the subjects on<br />
which he asks questions and the lack of questions about economic<br />
policy. The lack of questions about employment. / 2 </p>
<p>lAmit -2-<br />
Question Nonetheless, has he been successful in so-doing, politically<br />
speaking, in terms of the way the electorate thinks, in<br />
your opinion?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I think it can have some sort of influence on the electorate<br />
but at the same time I think an electorate can say ' look,<br />
we've had enough of this, we want to get down to the mainstream<br />
of policies and we wish people would argue about the main<br />
issues which are of concern to us'. In the latter phases of<br />
the Parliamentary year there was very definitely a reaction<br />
against Mr. Hayden's overwhelming concern with what are the<br />
peripheral issues.<br />
Question Do you think that the ALP will continue that tack in the<br />
new year and will it succeed in it given I know you can't<br />
comment specifically, but obviously Mr. Ian Sinclair, his<br />
situation.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Well let's see what happens as a result of that particular<br />
N. S. W. inquiry.<br />
Question From the Government's point of view, are you looking forward<br />
to a good year in 1979. A year in which what are you<br />
going to forecast for Australia?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I believe in 1979, people will be able to see increasingly<br />
that the policies we have pursued have been the right policies.<br />
Question You've already said that inflation will come down. You've<br />
predicted 5 percent by the middle of the year. Are interest rates<br />
down again too, just as a final point?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Let me just make it straight because these things sometimes<br />
and in mythology later on are taken the wrong way around.<br />
That was a Treasury prediction on which I was relying and I<br />
wouldn't make a prediction of that kind because they've got<br />
the expertise and the models and that was their prediction. </p>
<p>3<br />
Question<br />
Are you confident on that though?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I have no reason not to be. The Treasury tell me that<br />
nothing has happened since the Budget which would cause<br />
them to withdraw from the basis of that. By the middle<br />
of next year inflation should be running at around about<br />
percent on an annualised basis. Getting inflation down<br />
more and keeping on with that task, obviously has further<br />
implications for interest rate changes but there have been<br />
significant changes over recent weeks in that area and what<br />
we've emphasised all along is that any policy of reducing<br />
interest rates must be steady in a way that is sustainable.<br />
You don't want something that is going to go diving down<br />
and diving up again as has happened in a number of overseas<br />
countries. In none of these areas have we ever promised<br />
dramatic results. We have promised to stick to the task<br />
and, sticking to the task, I am quite certain we will be<br />
successful. 000---</p>
