EMBARGO: 5 PM<br />
PRIME MINISTER'S WEEKLY BROADCAST MR FRASER'S DOUBLE TAX PLAN T<br />
SUNDAY 5 OCTOBER 1975<br />
I doubt if there has ever been a more muddled and<br />
dangerous set of policies put forward by the Opposition than<br />
Mr Fraser's latest brainchild on State and Federal taxes.<br />
I say " Mr Fraser's brainchild", though it's well known that<br />
the scheme was dreamt up by Senator Carrick, a Liberal Party<br />
Senator from New South Wales, and seems to have been adopted<br />
by the Opposition with very little thought. It's all been<br />
dressed up as a policy on federalism which is a nice vague<br />
term but in reality it's a policy on taxation. And this is<br />
the extraordinary thing: while Mr Fraser is always talking<br />
about the burden on the taxpayer, he's now telling us that if<br />
a Liberal Government came to power, it would allow the States<br />
to impose income tax on every Australian in addition to the<br />
normal income tax that all of us pay now.<br />
In other words, it's a policy for double taxation.<br />
W Mr Fraser wants to overturn the whole uniform tax system which<br />
has served Australia well under Governments of every political<br />
colour since early in World War 11. On top of our normal income<br />
tax, we would all be paying income tax levied at the whim of.<br />
Mr Lewis, Mr Hamer, Mr Bjelke-Petersen and the rest.<br />
You would imagine that any party introducing a<br />
policy as extraordinary as this would at least show some<br />
enthusiasm for it themselves. In fact, the Opposition and<br />
the Premiers are well ahd truly split over the Fraser plan.<br />
The New South Wales Premier Mr Lewis, has said that no one<br />
really knows what the scheme is all about. Sir Gordon Chalk,<br />
the Liberal Treasuzer of Queensland, has expressed his<br />
reservations. Mr Kevin Cairns, a Queensland Federal Liberal<br />
member, is quite rightly worried that the scheme would<br />
disadvantage the sma~ ller States. As Mr Cairns said, and<br />
I quote his words: * All Australians with a sense of equity<br />
would ask who pays and who gets the benefits?" Mr Gorton,<br />
a former Liberal Prime Minister, points out that every taxpayer<br />
would receive a demand varying in each State for tax " over<br />
and above what they would pay in Federal taxation."<br />
Senator Steele Hall a former Liberal Premier of South Australia<br />
has denounced the scheme, and so has Mr Dunstan, the most<br />
experienced and successful Premier in Australia.<br />
So all told it's not surprising that the Liberals<br />
are soft-pedalling on their latest plan. For when we look at<br />
it closely we can see how hopeless and defective it is. The<br />
idea seems to be to give the States a guaranteed share of income<br />
tax revenue, and if that isn't enough, they could raise extra<br />
revenue themselves. But what revenue would there be for the<br />
States to share in, in the first place? Only a month ago,<br />
in his Budget speech, Mr Fraser promised tax indexation. The<br />
effect of tax indexation would be to reduce the revenues going<br />
to the Federal Govern-ment. There would be a smaller share for<br />
the States, whose own taxes would have to be steep indeed.<br />
Mr Fraser's policies a month ago are completely contradicted by<br />
his latest scheme. </p>
<p>-2-<br />
We can see what would happen by looking at the<br />
situation in Canada, where the Federal Government and the<br />
Governments in the different provinces all raise their own<br />
income tax. I happen to admire a lot of things about Canada,<br />
but their tax system has undoubtedly penalised the poorer parts<br />
of the country. The poorest provinces all pay the highest<br />
provincial taxes; people in the richest provinces pay the<br />
smallest provincial taxes. That was exactly what happened<br />
in Australia when the States raised income taxes before<br />
the war, and it's the very reason why the old system was<br />
abandoned in favour of uniform taxation.<br />
My Government has no intention of allowing the<br />
smaller and less populous States like Tasmania and Western<br />
Australia to come off badly compared with the bigger and richer<br />
States. Under this Government's policies all States get a<br />
fair deal; all Australian pay the same taxes. There are<br />
no second-class citizens under a Labor Government. It's quite<br />
clear that the Fraser plan has been devised as a sop to the<br />
Liberal Governments of New South Wales and Victoria. Because<br />
of the Lewis Government's incompetence and its refusal to<br />
co-operate with Australian Government policies, it wants to<br />
grab more money at the expense of other Australians to swell<br />
its own coffers. Mr Fraser has never specified how much Commonwealth<br />
tax would be given to the States as a right, and he has<br />
flatly refused to say what the share for local government<br />
would be. We are asked to take the whole thing on trust.<br />
You can imagine what a regular battle we would have: instead<br />
of arguing each year what their actual share of revenue<br />
would be as the States do now they would be arguing what<br />
the percentage share focr everyone of them would be. The small<br />
States would be arguaing with the bigger ones and they would<br />
all be arguing wit:-Canberra.<br />
The people who would be best off under this system<br />
are the residents of Canberra, who would pay no State taxes<br />
at all. They'd be first-class citizens. The other lucky<br />
people would be those in wealthy suburbs where local councils<br />
have adequate revenues. They'd at least be second-class<br />
citizens. All other Australians, those in small States,<br />
in remote country towns, in run-down suburbs of the big cities,<br />
would get third-class treatment. That's the reality of the<br />
Fraser plan inequality and more inequality. The proposals<br />
don't guarantee an appropriate share of funds for States<br />
where local governm-ts find it hard to raise revenues and<br />
meet their expenses.<br />
At present this problem is met by the Grants<br />
Commission, which can build up the revenues of the needy States<br />
and ensure that extra-Funds go direct to local government<br />
areas that are falling behind. The Grants Commission, under<br />
reforms introduced my Government, has done an excellent<br />
job in helping loca-2 councils. When the Liberals were last<br />
in office, less than halfL of one per cent of local government<br />
money camne direct from the Federal Government. Now the<br />
Australian Governmnt see that more than six per cent comes<br />
to local government through the Grants Commission. The Fraser<br />
alternative to this system incredible as it sounds is to set<br />
/ 3 </p>
<p>-3-<br />
up seven grants commissions the one we have now and one<br />
for each State. Imagine it seven grants commissions<br />
and this from a party that complains about bureaucratic<br />
waste! The six new State bodies would have the job of<br />
handing out a little extra money to the local councils on<br />
top of their basic grants, but there would be no way of<br />
seeing that the money they handed out was adequate in the<br />
first place, or that the States who need most money would<br />
get it. The Opposition doesn't tell us what the basic<br />
grants for local councils would be based on, how they would<br />
be arrived at, or by whom. It's all incredibly vague.<br />
No wonder Mr Lewis is baffled by it all.<br />
The only thing that's clear from the Fraser plan<br />
is that every Australian would be at the mercy of a host<br />
of tax-grabbing authorities. There'd be State income<br />
taxes and council rates as well as the usual income tax.<br />
S And where would that leave my Government's proposals for<br />
tax reform for big tax savings for the family man and<br />
a fair system of rebates for everyone? The tax reforms in<br />
our latest Budget are essential to the battle for wage<br />
indexation. Unions will only accept wage indexation if<br />
S they know they will be saving in the tax on their take-home<br />
pay. Introduce three levels of tax and these savings and<br />
reforms will disappear. Indexation will collapse, and the<br />
battle against inflation will be vastly more difficult.<br />
Sound, uniform, national economic management in Australia<br />
would be almost impossible. It's not surprising that<br />
many Liberals themselves are confused and dismayed by<br />
Mr Fraser's double tax system. I'm quite certain that the<br />
Australian people won't have a bar of it. </p>
