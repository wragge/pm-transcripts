<p>PRIME M1INISTER CAN BERRA<br />
SEP I 519e1<br />
The Hon. R. T. Gray, MHA<br />
Premier of Tasmania<br />
HOBART TAS 7000<br />
A~ y dear Premier<br />
I am writing in connection with some of the matters which<br />
arose in thie course of our discussions in Hobart on<br />
31 August concerning arrangements between our Governments<br />
following cessation of the Gordon-below-Franklin scheme.<br />
First,-I confirm that the Commonwealth is prepared to<br />
extend for a further month the arrangements for income<br />
maintenance for H-EC employees and for assistance to<br />
contractors, on the same basis as set out in Schedules<br />
E and F to the Interim Financial Agreement which you<br />
have before you. It needs to be understood, however,<br />
that the Commonwealth would expect that any requirement<br />
that the State may have to provide assistance of this<br />
kind beyond the period now agreed would be subsumed in<br />
the proposed block funding arrangements.<br />
I also confirm that the Commonwealth is prepared to<br />
reimburse the State for expenditures of up to $ 99,412<br />
in respect of the projects for a number of small<br />
contracts referred to in your letter of 12 August.<br />
Approval for these projects is provided having regard<br />
to the particular difficulties mentioned in your letter,<br />
and is not to be regarded as a precedent. We understand<br />
that a detailed claim will be forwarded by the State in<br />
due course.<br />
There are, of course, a number of matters on which a<br />
formal response from the State is awaited. These include:<br />
the Interim Financial Agreement<br />
the Commonwealth's proposals for block funding<br />
arrangements the joint study of Tasmanian future electricity<br />
requirements development of tourist facilities in the South-West;<br />
Queenstown sewerage; and assistance for the provision<br />
of additional rangers in the World Heritage area<br />
during the forthcoming summer. 2 </p>
<p>2<br />
I look forward to your early and favourabie responses<br />
on these matters. En this regard I am pleased to have<br />
received advice that terms of reference for the<br />
proposed joint study of electricity requirements have<br />
been agreed, clearing the way for work to commence<br />
quickly. It is also my understanding that the State will be<br />
submitting proposals in due course in relation to:<br />
* reimbursement for costs incurred on the<br />
Gordon-below-Franklin scheme<br />
* the value of resources in the Heritage area which<br />
cannot be exploited<br />
* further development of Hobart Airport; and<br />
* a prospective regional economic study of Tasmania.<br />
I shall be writing to you as soon as practicable in<br />
response to your letter of 28 July regarding management<br />
of the World Heritage area.<br />
Yours sincerely<br />
R. J. L. Hawke </p>
