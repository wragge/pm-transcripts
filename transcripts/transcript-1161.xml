AUSTRALIAN TEXTILE EXPOSITION BANQUET<br />
HOTEL REX-AT-CANBERRA, CANBERRA. 29TH SEPTEMBER, 1965<br />
Speech by the Prime Minister, Sir Robert Menzies<br />
Sir Robert and Lady Webster and all the rest of you<br />
I want to tell you in the first place that these pieces<br />
of fabric, precariously woven are warmly received. That is the<br />
huntin, tartan in what is called in Scotland the old vegetable dye,<br />
( Laughter) which only goes to show that even Webster can be up to<br />
date occasionally, Laughter) ( Applause)<br />
And in the second place, I would like to tell you this.<br />
I am about to open this Exposition and therefore all this is relevant,<br />
you see. I said I must tell you that I was born a son of a father who<br />
was even more violently protectionist than Bob Webster ( Laughter) and<br />
I leave it to you to understand what that means. From my earliest<br />
days, he used to look at me before I ever knew what protection and free<br />
trade meant and say " Robert, understand" and, of course if I didn't<br />
understand...... at any rate, as I have since demonstrated in<br />
politics I pretended to understand. ( Laughter) But, really, when I<br />
look back on the old man, I think he was a softie ( Laughter) compared<br />
to you. And, therefore, here we are, my wife oh, well her<br />
late father, whom s.-me of you knew, he was on the Council of the Chamber<br />
of Manufactures. He was the kind of man who could talk to Anderson<br />
( Laughter) on eoual terms ( Lau hter), and here am I, the son f my<br />
old man. Therefore we perhaps" have, by derivation, Sir, the right<br />
to be here. ( Applause) But I am bound to say, and I think honesty recuires<br />
this, that although I have known and admired Sir Robert Webster for<br />
many years and have sometimes been at the biting end of his tongue,<br />
until toni-ht I had never understood the function of psychologists in<br />
industry ( taughter). But toni-ht I have been sitting next to his<br />
charming wife who has, for the first time in my life, explained what<br />
psychologists do ( Laughter) and what their function is in irdustry,<br />
because I learned a bit of psychology myself once.<br />
I w! ant you to understand that although having gone<br />
into other fields, I am no longer an intellectual, I was once.<br />
( Lughter) I always remember the late Boyce Gibson, father of the<br />
present Professor, beginning a series of lectures to us when I was an<br />
undergraduate, by saying and he had a little tongue-tied way of<br />
speaking a charming man, he was a marvellous man but he said, " MIan<br />
is an anthropoid with welatively large cewebwal Aemispheres."<br />
( Laughter) I have never forgotten that. ( Laughter) And every time<br />
my highly literate opponents say to me somethin rude I say to myself,<br />
" It's all right Menzies. You are an anthropoid, with relatively<br />
large cerebral Aemispheres." ( Laughter) What it means, I wouldn't be<br />
dogmatic about that. ( Laughter) But I like it.<br />
Now, it is a very good thing that in this great<br />
Exposition that the man in charge should be Sir Robert Webster because,<br />
really, we have our bit of fun, we have arguments about this and that,<br />
but iT ever there was a man in the commercial and industrial history<br />
of Australia who stood for what we could do in Australia and how we<br />
could do it, it's Bob Webster. ( Hear, hear) ( Applause) Now, it is<br />
revealing no secret to you who never iead the newspapers that I am, on<br />
my last birthday, 70, and therefore I am not only entitled to a pension<br />
but I am, you know what the boys at Parliament House say, not a bad<br />
old chap. ( Laughter) And so 1 am -n old chap, and in my lifetime<br />
born in the bush, born in a little country town, going to school in / 2 </p>
<p>2<br />
Ballerat, going to school in Melbourne I have seen without<br />
always being conscious of it, the history of the textile industry<br />
of Australia never quite conscious, but when I was a small boy,<br />
you might here and there encounter a woollen mill, that was it.<br />
Then later on when I was a schoolboy and growing up a little,<br />
there were clothing factories and a few woollen mills. In my<br />
own time I want all of you who are younger, much younger than I<br />
am, to think about this because this will give you an excitement<br />
in your mind about this marvellous country of ours. Here am I,<br />
the little boy at school, and there is a woollen mill somewhere<br />
in Ballarat. Here am I the little boy at school who goes to<br />
see the first moving picture show on the Ballarat East oval. Here<br />
am I, a little boy, who in his little bush village in the country<br />
sees the first motor vehicle ever to come into the country.<br />
You know, you are all so kind to me that you don't realise how<br />
venerable I am ( Laughter) Not worthy of veneration, but venerable,<br />
because in my own lifetime I have seen the beginning and the<br />
development and the growth of most of the great things that we now<br />
take for granted, don't we, in our lives, from motor cars to<br />
aircraft, television, before that broadcasting.<br />
Broadcasting. Do you mind me telling you that when<br />
by some strange chance I became Prime Minister of this country<br />
only twentysix years ago ( Laughter) in 1939, I went to do a<br />
little broadcast and I came back to the Lodge and there was my<br />
wife, faithful as always. And the dear girl, she was sitting ' here<br />
and wondering, you see, and then broadcasting was on, and I was<br />
doing a broadcast and I turned to her and I said because I rather<br />
approved of what this chap was say in, I said, " Wio is that?"<br />
And she said, " That's you" ( Laughter' That was the first time I<br />
had ever heard myself. I didn t believe it then and I still don't<br />
believe it, when I hear it.<br />
But this is a mere scrappy way of saying that we,<br />
half of us here tonight, have lived in a period in which there<br />
have been the most tremendous developments, and so I go back to<br />
what I began by saying...... We began with a woollen mill or two,<br />
and then we had cotton arnd then we had man-made fibres. We started<br />
off with growing, with manufacturing, with prccessing, with weaving,<br />
with fabric, with clothing, with dyeing, with printing. It's little<br />
wonder that Sir Robert has tonight told us that here is a massive<br />
industry in Australia which empoys 74,000. It's little wonder<br />
this has become one of the very great industries in Australia.<br />
And of course, this has involved all sorts of things primary<br />
proauction. We are not to think about the woolgrower, the cottongrower<br />
whoever-it-may-be grower in Australia as if he were quite<br />
separate. He is part of the great textile industry. We are not<br />
to think of manufacturing efficiency as if it related only to that<br />
phase of the work that is to be done it is a very important phase<br />
but is part of the phase. We are not to think of promotion that's<br />
a blessed word " promotion". It's wonderful, you admire people<br />
who do it. Anyhow, we are not to think of promotion, of encouraging<br />
people to buy as if this were completely detached from everything<br />
else, because in reality, the man who grcws the fibre, whether it<br />
is wool or cotton, the man who manufactures the fibre, whether this<br />
is nylon or whatever it may be, the man who assembles it into some<br />
form, the man who designs it, puts it into form and sells it, these<br />
are all people who are involved in the great textile industry.<br />
( Hear, hear) This is really perhaps te most significant though<br />
obvious thing that I want to say to you.<br />
Now I know, Sir, that in modern times where people<br />
are all engaged in politics where they all know why they are<br />
right and why the other fellow is wrong, I am nld enough to belong / 3 </p>
<p>to a generation in which I think on the whole I am right but<br />
that perhaps I might be wrong. This argues a degree sf wisdom<br />
that will come strangely to some of you. ( Laughter) But it's<br />
true. It's true. There is nothing all black or all white. A<br />
few years ago, I was a little wnrried because although I wear<br />
wool rather more than the average human being ( Laughter), I<br />
never was quite able to persuade myself that you had to wear a<br />
woollen handkerchief or a woollen tie or a woollen shirt<br />
otherwise you were a traitor to your country. I still don't<br />
believe it. The truth is that as every married man here tonight<br />
knows, the secret of happiness in life is a good marriage.<br />
( Hear, hear) ( Applause) And therefore I have always believed<br />
that in the long iun wool, man-made fibres, all these things<br />
w ould be married tooether to the greater enjoyment of mankind.<br />
( Applause) I think that any man who is engaged in the production<br />
of man-made fibres to use this revolting expression ( Laughter)<br />
any man who is engaged in that production who 3aid " I hate<br />
wool" would be a fol. He would. And any man who is enaged<br />
in the production and processin. of wool who said, " I can't bear<br />
the thought of man-made fibres he would be a fcol, because in<br />
the long run, it is marriage that will solve this problem.<br />
This is so true. You l? ok back over the whole history of mankir,'<br />
over the whole history of our race, do you suppose that witiout<br />
some intermarriage we would have amounted to very much? Do<br />
you suppose that if the Anglo-Saxons had said, " Anglo-Saxons we<br />
are, and out with the rest of them," we would have been the<br />
magnificent people that we are? ( Laughter) Do you think of what<br />
would have happened if the Anglo-Saxons had ignred the demands<br />
of the Scots ILaughter) ( Applause) The truth is and I say<br />
this quite seriously that in the long run, the future of<br />
fibres, the natural fibres of wool, the man-made fibres will<br />
depend very largely on how far they both realise that if they<br />
act together, there is a bigger'and brighter future for both of<br />
them. THear, hear) And it is because I believe that I haven't<br />
consulted the Department you know.... I haven't discussed<br />
that ( Laughter) I know, I am always making some indiscreet<br />
remarks. I believe this, partly because I believe that the future<br />
of wool is vital to Australia and partly because I believe that<br />
the future of wool is involved in this kind of marriage that I<br />
have been talking about. Now, that is all I want to say on that<br />
point. By the time I have been reported on this matter, I won't<br />
now what it was I said. ( Laughter)<br />
I just want to say a few words on another aspect of<br />
this matter. It's a very great mistake, Sir, for your industry<br />
or for the wool industry or for any other industry to think that<br />
it will sell its products by the Divine Grace of the Almighty.<br />
It won't. It has to sell them, and to sell any commodity in the<br />
world today, you must pay enormous attention to design, to<br />
quality, to presentation to design. This, Sir, I venture to<br />
say, is a matter to which we have devoted rather too little<br />
attention in Australia. A little bit inclined, aren't we, to<br />
say " Oh, well, you know, it's wool, it's good, it's fine<br />
quality, it's go all the things in the wrrld. WVhether it looks<br />
a little unpleasant, that doesn't matter." Design, design is the<br />
whole background of salesmanship, just as my wife occasionally<br />
reminds me that a capacity to produce the goods behind the<br />
presentation is equally important. Something, I hope, we will<br />
not forget, 3 </p>
<p>4<br />
The other day I .; as looking at the J; ornal of the<br />
Royal Society of Arts, oT which for some reason understandable<br />
only to the Almighty, I im a Fellow ( Laughter) and every now and<br />
then the Royal Society has a symposium of people who discuss<br />
certain topics. The other day the had a great symposium on<br />
design with Prince Philip in the chair, and when I picked this<br />
out of my mail basket and glanced through it, I reminded myself<br />
of a time when I oh many years ago before the time of half of<br />
you I was in England on a Parliamentary Association visit.<br />
You know how onerous that can be.<br />
We went to Kidderminster, and I -as Attorney-General<br />
of Australia at that time so I was in charge. The Mnager of<br />
the Kidderminster carpet factory we were visiting, he did't<br />
know who we were and I am bound to say in his favour he couldn't<br />
have cared less. ( Lauohter) And we went along to a larze display<br />
room oh many times the size of this. We saw some lovely carpets<br />
and then not quite so lovely carpets anu then some good carpets<br />
but not quite so lovely, and when we got to the far end, we came<br />
across a floor full of carpets of the most horrible description.<br />
You will all understand me when I say ; hcdv were all orange . nd<br />
black flecks, you know. They were errible. And in my n<br />
innocence this was many years aFo ( Laughter) I said, " But,<br />
Sir would anybody buy such revolting carpets as these? And he<br />
looked at me and said, deadpan, " Oh no, we make these for the<br />
Australian market". And I am bound to tell you that I thoui t<br />
he was having me on you see, until the next time I went to<br />
provincial town in Victoria I won't name it and had tu stay<br />
overnight and there was the very carpet on the floor. Well,<br />
it was no doubt having this kind of thing in mind that the Royal<br />
Society of Arts decided to have a discussion about design and I<br />
don't apologise for mentioning design because design in the textile<br />
trade will sell more than any individual salesman. ( Hear, hear)<br />
It is a fundamental error to think that most people<br />
have bad taste. Some have bad taste but in the long run, you must<br />
cater for people who have taste. When we do this constantly, then<br />
I see no limit to the textile trade in Australia, but at this<br />
Conference, they had a series of people..... I read this only<br />
yesterday, that s why I have it so much in with Prince<br />
Philip in the chair and they gave a few medals to people.<br />
Do we give medals, Gordon, to people for ood design? Well we<br />
ought To. ( Laughter) M-ake a note of tha Mr. C. rmody. hen<br />
each man who received a medal had to make a speech. A more<br />
revolting exercise you can't imagine. But one of them who<br />
received the medal was the managing director of a world famous<br />
whiskey and gin firm.<br />
iow, I say nothing to all our wives who don't understand<br />
about whiskey and gin ( Laughter) but it wasn't easy, was it, to<br />
associate in one's mind the idea of selling whiskey and gin and<br />
what-have-you with design. And et, of course, this man was<br />
able to establish quite clearly that they had paid a great deal<br />
of attention to the problem of how they presented their goods to<br />
the world, and I made a note of one thing that he said. Might<br />
I read it to you, bearing in mind that this is a man who was the<br />
managing director of a firm that sells spirits but is equally<br />
applicable to every man here tonight who is in the textile trade.<br />
He was talking about the head of a business and he said, will<br />
happily plough revenue into technical research, into capital<br />
reserves, into the shareholders' pockets, into splendid staff<br />
welfare schemes, but into the appearance, taste, function and<br />
elegance of the article on which this part of his commodity empire<br />
is to be founded, still I fear, all too rarely." Something in<br />
that, isn't there.<br />
L </p>
<p>5<br />
I am an immeasurable believer in the textile industry<br />
in Australia. I don't have to be converted by my fricnd, Sir<br />
Robert, but I think that in the long runt the permanence of any<br />
industry will largely depend on how far it compels the taste and<br />
judgment of the people o the country, and in textiles above all<br />
things, there must be superb quality or there must , e a mere<br />
wretched dependence on what some government may do or cn what some<br />
tariff board may dn.<br />
And this is tremendously important because as yqu<br />
have been reminded-here is an industry that employs in the direct<br />
sense 74,00 people in our country. In other words supports<br />
in a full sense a quarter of a million, an industry whLc has done<br />
more for decentralisation than any other that we know an<br />
industry which emplos more female labour than any othe---dustry<br />
we know of. This inaustry, viewing it broadly, has ti-us<br />
claims on Australia. It can't sunport them merely by s<br />
" You mus+ help us". It can support them best by saying, .: ill<br />
help you. We will help the country because we are preparea to<br />
say that we will let everybody understand that what we do has<br />
great design and great qualiuy and w: ili be bought on its merits."<br />
Do you see what I mean? I hope you do because great<br />
believer as I ar. and faithful as I am to the memory of my father<br />
who would have murdered me if he thought I k:-ere not a protectionist,<br />
as indeed I am, but in the long run the whole purpose of<br />
tariff, the whole purpose of protection is to give you a<br />
class opprrtunity of seizing the market; but whether ycu ncid<br />
the market, having seized it, will be up to you.<br />
Sir it seems an cdd thing to do at a dinner party,<br />
but I declare this Exposition open. </p>
