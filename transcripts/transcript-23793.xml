    <content><![CDATA[<p>India will participate in the New Colombo Plan when it expands across the Indo-Pacific region in 2015.</p>
<p>The New Colombo Plan will build on our already strong education links with India and complement the Indian Government’s Connect to India initiative which funds five Indian universities to each host at least 30 international students.</p>
<p>India is our second largest source of international students with more than 30,000 Indians granted visas to study in Australia in 2013-14.</p>
<p>The New Colombo Plan aims to increase understanding and knowledge of our region and ensure a more Asia-aware Australian workforce for the future.</p>
<p>To further strengthen educational ties, a Memorandum of Understanding on Cooperation in Technical Vocational Education and Training has also been signed between the National Skills Development Corporation of India and the Australian Department of Industry.</p>
<p>The Australian Government will provide a further $3 million in funding for Melbourne University’s Australia India Institute – Australia’s only national centre of research and analysis on India.</p>
<p>Since its establishment in 2008, the Institute has played an important role in expanding understanding of the bilateral relationship.</p>
<p>Its publications and activities have raised awareness of India among Australian decision makers, and have helped to change perceptions about Australia in India.</p>
<p>I welcome the Institute’s plans to open its first node in India in early 2015, supported by the University of Melbourne.</p>
<p>The work of the Institute complements the New Colombo Plan, by providing Australian researchers, academics and students with the opportunity to study in India.</p>
<p>I would like to acknowledge the contribution the Director of the Institute, Professor Amitabh Mattoo, has made to Australia's relationship with India.</p>
