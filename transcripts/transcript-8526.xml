JIM WALEY: After a bold start to his bid to catapult Labor to<br />
a fifth election victory, Paul Keating has lost some of his<br />
momentum of late. The forced resignation of Senator Graham<br />
Richardson, continuing revelations over the Marshall Islands<br />
affair, factional brawling and a Massive budget blow-out all<br />
helping to rob the Prime Minister of the political initiative.<br />
With an election looming it's imperative he get it back<br />
quickly. Time is a luxury Mr Keating simply doesn't have.<br />
The Prime Minister is in our Canberrastudio this morning<br />
and here to talk with him, Sunday's political editor, Laurie<br />
Oakes. Laurie<br />
LAURIE OAKEn: Thanks, Jim. Mr Keating; welcome, back to the<br />
program. PAUL KEATING: Thank you, Laurie.<br />
JLURIE OAKES: Almost a year ago to the day you said on this<br />
program there would be a touch of excitement if you became<br />
Prime Minister. But presumably the sort of excitement you had<br />
in mind wasn't allegations of scandal, ministerial<br />
resignations, factional brawling?<br />
PAUL KEATINQ: We've had, I think, more than a touch of it.<br />
We've taken Federal Labor's stocks from a 28 per cent in the<br />
polls, to around 40, and the One Nation package has totally<br />
re-launched the Federal Labor Party, in terms of issues,<br />
running up to the next election and I wouldn't pretend like<br />
anyone else any other real person in public life that </p>
<p>every week goes swimmingly for you. obviously it doesn't but<br />
the main thing is in this last week we in the Cabinet have<br />
been working on the big issues.<br />
And I might say that the issues we've been working on,<br />
while the opposition have been rabbiting on in the' Senate<br />
about letters and correspondence, we've been looking at a<br />
revolution in aviation and telecommunications and also we've<br />
had on the stocks a long term consideration of the technical<br />
and further education system.<br />
LAURIE 0AKES: I'll ask you about those in a moment but do you<br />
accept that the Government has hit a wall? As you said, you<br />
were going well for a while but you've fallen in a hole<br />
haven't you?<br />
PAUL KEATINjG: I think, Laurie, you've got to make an<br />
impression of these things outside. I believe that a party's<br />
progress builds cumulatively. I think a week of these sort of<br />
things doesn't knock the cumulative effect down. It may<br />
retard one's progress but in terms of the broader sweep I<br />
think the public are a bit smart about all these things.<br />
Look, last weekend -we had Wal rife, the Leader of<br />
Government opposition Busine~ ss in the House of<br />
Representatives, knocked out of his seat under protests by<br />
John Sharp, the Country Party member. We had Durack, Dr<br />
Hewson's shadow Attorney-General, defeated by the Crichton-<br />
Browne faction in Western Australia. We've got similar<br />
problems in the New South Wales selections at the moment. I<br />
mean all parties have these running up to a poll and I think<br />
the media. sort of put a big discount, through the public's<br />
intelligence about these things.<br />
LAURIE OAKES: But you haven't got much time. Do you have a<br />
strategy to get out of the hole, to get back on track?<br />
PAUL KEATING: I mean the strategy for me has always been,<br />
throughout my whole ministerial life, and publ-ic life for that<br />
matter, keeping on pressing on to the structural and major<br />
policy changes. That's~ what I've been doing. This week, when<br />
the journalists ran out of the Senate after each question to<br />
Senator Evans, and out of the, House'. of Representatives, and<br />
2 </p>
<p>back to f ile their stories we went back to the Cabinet Room<br />
working on issues of substance.<br />
I didn't spend my week rattling through Senate Hansards.<br />
I spent them going through the policy discussions around the<br />
issues I mentioned to you earlier and looking at ' Cabinet<br />
material around that.<br />
LAURIE OAKES; Let me ask you about some or those issues? You<br />
mentioned aviation. Are we to see a merger of Qantas and<br />
Australian Airlines?<br />
PAUL KEATING: What we're contemplating is the building of an<br />
international competitive aviation market in Australia so that<br />
the interface between international aviation and domestic<br />
aviation is not the broken one it is n6w, but one where the<br />
domestic players are international players. -That'll mean<br />
building at least two international carriers, maybe more.<br />
One of the options we're looking at is the merging or<br />
Qantas and Australian Airlines but, as you know, the<br />
Government intends to sell 100 per cent of Australian and 49<br />
per cent. of Qantas. If we roll the two ifito a meryed entity<br />
it would mean one of the options for us is to sell the value<br />
of 100 per-cent of Australian and 49 per cent of Qantas in the<br />
merged entity, which would probably run out to about 7 0 per<br />
cent of Qantas, which would mean that Qantas would then have a<br />
domestic arm in Australian.<br />
we are setting up a commission by legislation this week<br />
to award routes to other carriers. The other carrier, of<br />
course, in that context would be Ansett. That is to<br />
internationalise another domestic player.<br />
LAURIE OAKES: And where ' does: Air New Zealand fi~ t into this?<br />
Part of your original plan was an integrated aviation market<br />
with New Zealand, was . it not?<br />
PAUL KEATING: That's still part of the plan apd very shortly,<br />
I believe, we'll secure an agreement with cNew Zealand to<br />
create one Australasian airline market and in that we will see<br />
Australian planes and. New Zealand planes more frequently<br />
flying across the Taeman. The question of on-routes outside<br />
of Australia will also be resolved. </p>
<p>so what you'll see, Laurie, is the capacity of<br />
Australians to have a better airline system, cheaper fares and<br />
a rational development or the airlines away from that terrible<br />
two-airline policy, the Liberals saddled us up with for<br />
years and, I might say, which they renewed three weekd before<br />
the 1983 election. Again, Labor's been the only party to<br />
break these arrangements. up and now try and thread its way<br />
through to a really decent, tremendously. competitive<br />
structure. LAURI E OAKES Let me get this straight. You'll sell<br />
something like 70 per cent of a merged airline. why not the<br />
whole lot?<br />
PAUL KEATING:. The options are these: that we have Qantas<br />
acquire Australian; that we sell 49 per cent of the merged<br />
entity. That would mean nothing for the Budget. That would<br />
mean all of the proceeds going back into the recapitalisation<br />
of the merged entity.<br />
The alternative would be to sell down the value of 100<br />
per cent of Australian and 49 per,-cent of Qantas, which -would<br />
be about 70 per cent of Qantas. We could do that by a f loat<br />
to the , Australian peo6ple, as we did with the Commonwealth<br />
Bank, and maybe reserving in that f loat substantial sections<br />
of the shares for other major internAtional airlines who might<br />
wish to take a piece of it and manage it because part of the<br />
weakness of Qantas is-its management structure.<br />
LAURIE OAKES: The two things that arise out of that, of<br />
course, if you're going to sell 70 per cent -why not 100?<br />
You haven't got control, anyway.<br />
PAUL ' KEATING: That is again an. option, but it's. a matter for<br />
the Party then. We have to I think then consider that at a<br />
conference level, whereas we have authority from a year or so<br />
back for 100 per cent of Australian and 49 per cent of Qantas.<br />
LAURIE pARES: The second thin4 " that arises: at that<br />
conference you talk ed About the argument was there's no place<br />
for a government-ow ned, airline in domestic aviation. Now<br />
you're stepping away from that.<br />
PAUL KEATING: well, the point is the synergies which arise<br />
4 </p>
<p>from the purchase of Australian by Qantas are quite profound<br />
and if we were to sell down the stock of the value of 100 per<br />
cent of Australian and . the 49 per cent of Qantas, to all<br />
intents and purposes that point I made then would be well and<br />
truly satisfied.<br />
LAURIE OAKES: You also mentioned broadcasting. What's going<br />
to happen to pay television? That's on the Cabinet agenda for<br />
tomorrow as well, is it not?<br />
PAUL KEATING: it is.<br />
LAURIE OAKES: Are we looking at the Richardson plan being put<br />
up by the new Minister?<br />
PAUL KEATING: Graham Richardson was basically moving along<br />
with the policy as it obtained before h6 become the Minister.<br />
what I've said is I've been quite uncomfortable about the fact<br />
that we're about to exclusively nominate satellite television<br />
as the only vehicle for pay television between now and the<br />
year 1999. Particularly when other technologies are<br />
available, like fibre optic cableand MDS -that's local radio<br />
transmission of television into homes. So what I've said to<br />
Bob Collins, and he agrees, is we should look 4t the option of<br />
taking away the e~ eclusivity of satellite transmission of pay<br />
television. In other words, the satellite will still be the<br />
forerunner because it's got a number'of ye~ cris head start<br />
LAURIE OAKES: Yes.<br />
PAUL KEATING: -But there's no particular reason why we ought<br />
to make it exclusive. There's -no particular * reas-on why<br />
Telecom, who has cabled up most of the Australian suburbs at<br />
least to the street corner, if not to the home, that anyone<br />
else ' that wants to be in the pay business shouldn't be able to<br />
be in it.<br />
LAURIE OAKES: Immediately?<br />
PAUL KEATING Well they can't because they; haven't got it<br />
wired up to the homes. so . the' only' immediate, one will be the<br />
satellite and because the satellite is immediate, the<br />
Government is going tQ put on it ownership limits that it<br />
would be less likely to put upon cable-or the local radio<br />
transmission style MDS style pay TV. </p>
<p>LAURIE OA1XE8: So ir you get your way it won't just be a f ourchannel<br />
satellite pay Tv consortium. That will exist, but<br />
anyone else -can get into the business as well once the cable<br />
is there?<br />
PAUL KEATIN4G: There'll be a four-channel consortium.' There<br />
can be another consortium for the separate transponder the<br />
fifth transponder; another one for the sixth transponder;<br />
and anyone else who wants to come with any other technology,<br />
including cable. This of course, Laurie, would virtually<br />
create a revolution in Australian telecommunications and give<br />
Australians You see fibre optics has the capacity to put<br />
200 channels into a house and also to answer back. You could<br />
deal with your bank or deal with your supermarket. Whereas<br />
the satellite can at this stage put only four channels into a<br />
home , and even though there's a thing called digital<br />
compression rattling down the road which may increase that,<br />
it's not going to do in the long run what fibre can do.<br />
I don't believe, having kept the sla te clean can i<br />
just. make this point: We kept, the slate clean on colour<br />
television for years so that Australia in the latter part<br />
chose the right technology. It chose Pal-D. We've kept the<br />
slate clean on pay but at the eleventh hour-. 1 believe we look<br />
like choosing a very limited technology and denying to<br />
ourselves the right to at least choose alternative and maybe<br />
superior technologies. So, you know, I've said to collins I<br />
don't think. this is on. I think he agrees and we're now<br />
trying to construct<br />
That's what I've been doing this week, Laurie. Not<br />
reading Senate Hansards.<br />
LAURIE OAKES: Will that go to Cabinet tomorrow?<br />
PAUL KEATING: it'll go to Cabinet Monday and Tuesday.<br />
LAURIE OAKES: Mr Keating, we'll pause for a commercial break.<br />
PAUL KEATING: Thank you. ,( Commercial break)<br />
LAURIE OAKES: welcome back. Mr Xea~ ing, just to finish off </p>
<p>the pay television issue. what role will the networks have in<br />
this? will there still be a place for them in the consortia?<br />
PAUL KEATIN~ G: They're going to be thrown a difficult<br />
entrepreneurial Choice. They always tell us how good they<br />
are. we'll now see how good they are and they can' make a<br />
decision whether they actually bid for the rour transponders<br />
of f the satellite; just go for a movie channel on the fifth,<br />
or a * sports channel on the sixth; or wait and do something<br />
else on pay.<br />
The one thing is, Laurie, obviously with that diversity<br />
it'll be a case of many are called but few are chosen. The<br />
public will choose few, as has been the case in many other<br />
countries. But at least we shouldn't be locking these<br />
technologies out, which I think the sort of restrictive<br />
approach we had, did. AS you know, we're going over a bit of<br />
old history but I never liked that.<br />
LAURIE QAKES; No. If the networks can get involved, 1 what<br />
restrictions will there be to minimise concentration of<br />
ownership? 4<br />
PAUL KEATINGQ: in terms of the satellite, because there will<br />
now be other technologies the case for restrictions<br />
diminishes. so I think Senator Collins is proposing 45 per<br />
cent all up for the networks and any one level of 20. But<br />
then if the networks of course don't choose -I mean it's very<br />
likely the networks,-or a network, would not choose the<br />
satellite and just let it go to somebody else. and just try<br />
their hand three or four years later, on cable.<br />
LAURIE OAKES; The big issue, though', is still obviously<br />
economic policy and the' big issue in economic policy is<br />
unemployment. I gather Bill Kelty gave you the rounds of the<br />
kitchen on Thursday night about that and told you you couldn't<br />
win the election unless you did something about-that.<br />
PAUL KEATING: No, that sto1ty is' untrue. That'Is j ust a<br />
furphy. We had a debate there about tariffs and the impact of<br />
tariffs but not about''--Bill Kelty knows as well as anybody<br />
what the Government. s done about employmnent. He's on the<br />
Reserve Bank board. He knows we're npw looking at bill rates </p>
<p>of 6k per cent because he's been party to the decision which<br />
reduced interest rates by one per cent. He knows we'Ive got<br />
$ 2.3 billion in the one Nation spending and, as part of the<br />
discussion with the trade unions last Thursday, I went through<br />
the progress of the implementation or One Nation in fhe rail<br />
programs, in the payment to families, in the various other<br />
changes. So I think the ACTU is well aware of that but the<br />
textile, clothing and footwear industries have been beating a<br />
drum about tariffs now for some time. That was picked up by a<br />
few other people but-<br />
LAURIE OAKES: Did you promise to look at some way to cushion<br />
industry's hurt by the lowering of protection?<br />
PAUL KEATING: No. What We said was where we think there have<br />
been maybe unfair trade practices on the part of others, we<br />
would look at that. or, maybe in some areas where better<br />
adjustment programs can be put into place, that perhaps we<br />
could examine that.<br />
LAURIE OAKES: What about youth unemployment? Are you<br />
planning any initiatives there? That's clearly the most<br />
worrying aspect of the whole problem.<br />
PAUL KEATING: I think the most significant thing there is in<br />
technical and further education. live spent the last couple<br />
of weeks with Kim Beazley and John Dawkins and others talking<br />
about this. You see, Laurie, Labor took the participation<br />
rate of kids in secondary school f rom 3 ' in 10 to nearly 8 in<br />
Now, 40 per cent of those or just on 40 -35 to 40 are<br />
now finding tertiary places. The others are. cascading, not<br />
into ' technical and furthe . r education -only some are. They<br />
are just not being trained. I think that's a tragedy and<br />
that's Why in one Nation we try to lirt the whole, if you<br />
like, level and profile of the training institutions through<br />
TAFE. We put this proposition to the St. ates that the<br />
Commonwealth take over TAFE. Frankly, some of the states have<br />
been quite. obstructionist' about this. we're getting<br />
cooperation in Victoria; quite a bit from New South Wales; </p>
<p>virtually none from anyone else.<br />
LAURIE 0AXES: What do you do about that?<br />
PAUL KrATING: Well, I think we have two options: that is<br />
that we will maintain our recurrent effort for the existing<br />
TAFE system. We won't take the dog and the manger appfoach of<br />
pulling out but we will wind our capital program back and the<br />
Commonwealth will itself build a new system of vocational<br />
education. We will build new institutes or vocational education<br />
which have a much closer focus on the labour market and<br />
industry and perhaps do it with industry in areas which are<br />
going to be important. In other words, as we have lifted up<br />
the quality of tertiary education with'the universities, we<br />
can so too do that with a new system of vocational education<br />
while at the same time continuing the recurrent effort but<br />
having a greater grip over the policy the States employ for<br />
the recurrent funding we provide them.<br />
LAURIE OAKES: So you'll run a parallel system to TAFE?<br />
PAUL4 M~ TING: That's one of the olptions. We're still in this<br />
discussion-LAURIE OAKES: A serious option?-<br />
PAUL KEATING: A serious option. We're stii2. in discussions<br />
with them but it is* a serious option because a lot of the<br />
people providing TAFE training are trades persons who stopped<br />
actually practising their trade 15 of 20 ye ars ago. The whole<br />
world's moved on. TAFE's a system provided by the providers.<br />
it's not necessarily a system that looks after Australian kids<br />
trains them for jobs and trains them for things to do. So<br />
we're focussing on that ' and -if we could get a breakthrough<br />
there it would totally revolutionalise education from the<br />
tertiary level down that is beyond compulsory education.<br />
LAURIE OAKES: If we could just finish on general politics, mr<br />
Keating. The Government has been taking a pasting. You've<br />
had Gareth Evans talking about documents going astray in his<br />
office; Ros Kelly blaming her Department for a terrible mess<br />
up. You can't be-very happy with the way your Government's<br />
performing. </p>
<p>PAUIL KEATING: We've had a better week than we've had in the<br />
last couple of weeks, Laurie, obviously, but the day that<br />
Senator Evans's office apparently received these documents was<br />
the day of the attack on the Xranian Embassy. Senator Evans<br />
was himself abroad. I mean requiring of his staffC, weeks<br />
ahead of this becoming an issue, that all of these matters are<br />
referred to referred to. the minister abroad putting him on<br />
notice with it for Issues which then were seemingly of modest<br />
relevance, at the time, is being unfair after the event.<br />
This is what Oppositions are about but the Senate's<br />
trying to behave like a court and the silly notion is that the<br />
Government has actually got an obligation to help Senate<br />
Ministers provide information. I mean we don't, and we won't.<br />
LAURIE OAKES: But aren't you concerned that the Government<br />
looks sloppy?<br />
PAUL KEATING; Yes, but-<br />
LAURIE OAKEO: What do you do about it?<br />
PAUL KEATXNG: * You tell people about the; issues I've just<br />
spoken to you about. You tell people that in the real changes<br />
which the Federal Liberal Party of Australia and the<br />
Country Party and the -National Party never ever contemplated<br />
in television; in airlines, from their a lousy regulated<br />
systems; in education, which they were happy to leave 3 kids<br />
in 10 only complete secondary school, never cared about TArE.<br />
In those things, -again, it's always Labor down to the<br />
substance and that's what we're about.<br />
I mean, the point of me coming on your program the<br />
point of the dissemination of news of public affairs is to<br />
tell Australians ' that on the substance rather than the thim<br />
f lam I mean I'm not the one publishing pamphlets saying that<br />
a GST will stop someone breaking into your house. That sort<br />
of low political nonsense is coming from' Dr Hewson.<br />
The notion that the reason that there's been break-ins is<br />
because of nine years -of Federal Labor Government or, worse,<br />
that you can actually stop a break-in or your house by putting<br />
per cent on your Weetbix. This is the sort of low politics<br />
that this fellow's trafficking in . while the Government's </p>
<p>looking at a revolution in television, aviation and education.<br />
I'll leave it to you to judge, Laurie.<br />
LAURIE OAKES: We're out of time but thanks very much, Prime<br />
minister. PAUL KEATING: Thank you.<br />
LAURIE OAKES: Back to you, Jim~.<br />
JIM WNALEY: The Pri-me m~ inister there, talking with Laurie<br />
