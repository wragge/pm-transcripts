<p>Later today, under the title Australia Rising, I will deliver the first of a series of speeches I'll make over coming months which will set out a wide ranging Coalition agenda for the future.</p>
<p>Today's speech will focus, amongst other things, on the kind of world that we will all face, by say the year 2020. In developing policies for the future it's critical to understand the circumstances which those policies must address.</p>
<p>On the world scene for example, the human face of globalisation will be increasingly Asian and middle class - as our region becomes the epicentre of history's first truly global middle class.</p>
<p>On the domestic front, the challenges of an ageing population will be even more acute by the year 2020.</p>
<p>Of even greater consequence, will be the need to maintain and enhance the capacity of the Australian economy to succeed and prosper in a fiercely competitive world.</p>
<p>None of these challenges can be met, let alone overcome, if Australia is so foolish as to reverse any of the major economic reforms of the past 20 years, which have been so important in building the strength of our economy.  Yet that is what Labor has promised to do. </p>
<p>Reversing WorkChoices will damage the Australian economy. It will weaken our capacity to compete and it will destroy jobs.</p>
<p>Mr Rudd has made his work choice. He has put union power ahead of workers' jobs.</p>
