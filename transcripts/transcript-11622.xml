<p>E&amp;OE..................</p>
<p>Thank you very much Helen. To the Leader of the Opposition, Kim Beazley, Senator Meg Lees, the leader of the Australian Democrats, the President of the Senate, the speaker of the House of Representatives, Greg Hartung, Tim Fisher, Lois Appleby and Dr. John Grant of the organising committee, if they're here, my Parliamentary colleagues, Jackie Kelly, the Minister for Sport, and most importantly of all our wonderful athletes. Welcome to all of you.</p>
<p>It's difficult at a time like this to sort of avoid that horrible feeling of gee it's all over and . the Paralympics are over what'll we do now? I want to say that the experience that Janette and I had, and I know that hundreds of thousands of Australians had at the Paralympics was quite extraordinary. These Sydney 2000 Paralympics have altered forever the perception of Paralympics around the world. They have changed forever any previous mind sets that people may have had. And I think what they have done for the cause of athletic competition amongst elite athletes in the context of the Paralympics is absolutely outstanding. And the way in which the Games were supported by the people of Australia, the tremendous exhilaration and excitement that the spectators experienced and the sheer delight and joy that I as one of those spectators, and I know many of you derived from participation in the achievement of our athletes is one of those things that will stay with me for the rest of my life.</p>
<p>It wouldn't have been possible of course to have enjoyed that experience and to have experienced that exhilaration without the tremendous effort and organisation that went into the Games. And there are so many people in whose debt we are because of that. The tremendous work done by the Australian Sports Commission and I acknowledge the presence here of both Jim and John, both of whom have played a magnificent role in both the Olympic Games and the Paralympics. The tremendous work of Greg Hartung and the inspirational leadership he's given to the Paralympic movement. And do you Paul the "Chef-de-mission" of the Australian Team, and we had an opportunity during the Games to share a meal with the athletes at the Village, and the relaxed atmosphere, the easy communication, the great sense of camaraderie that existed between the members of the team was a great tribute to the leadership that you showed throughout the entirety of the Games. </p>
<p>But our athletes were superb. They did beat the rest of the world. They made Australia feel very proud. They gave intense pleasure, great entertainment and great competitive sport to the more than one million spectators who came along to support the Games. </p>
<p>Let me say that we intend to do our bit as a Federal Government to maintain the momentum that has clearly come out of the Paralympics. I said after the Olympics Games at a not dissimilar function to this that we would be providing additional resources for elite sport and also to encourage some additional grassroots participation, over and above what had already been announced by the Government before the Olympic Games. Let me confirm tonight that we will do exactly the same thing in relation to the Paralympics. We don't intend to in any way lose the opportunity to build on the great spirit that has come out of these Games. </p>
<p>It's very hard of course when you reflect on all the magnificent events you've seen. Janette says to me, that the sheer enthusiasm, the wheelchair rugby, was pretty good. I unfortunately could only attend the training session. But the swimming events, that magnificent experience on the middle Sunday night spending a couple of hours at the swimming venue and to see the venue totally packed and to see event after event producing sheer exhilaration and excitement. The tremendous performances, track and field. The unique experience of watching the sit down volleyball, a match between Australia and Bosnia Herzegovina. The wheelchair basketball. The volleyball. The list goes on. And all of it has left an indelible impression on millions of Australians. And it speaks volumes for the spirit, the determination, the effort and the striving to achieve and to succeed. And can I say to all of you, you've been an inspiration, you've given great joy, you've driven home the great sporting capacity and competitive spirit of the Australian people. You've done us proud, we thank you for the example you've set to the nation and to the world. And your contribution caps what has been a remarkable period of weeks in the experience and the life of the Australian nation. And your part in it is permanent and distinctive and will always be remembered by your fellow Australians.</p>
<p>Thank you</p>
<p>(ends) </p>
