    <content><![CDATA[<p>
PM:In Korea this morning I've had the opportunity to attend an Anzac Day commemoration.</p>
<p>This was a very special event, involving as it did many of the veterans who have been here for a journey to be in Korea, veterans who served here in the Korean War. I spent yesterday with those veterans, including veterans of the Battle of Kapyong. We had the opportunity to commemorate that major battle in the Korean War 60 years ago where our soldiers very bravely fought. It was a special event yesterday to commemorate that Battle, followed by dinner last night where I enjoyed some casual times with the veterans, and this morning it's been a special event to come together again, following yesterday, and to have our Anzac Day commemoration. </p>
<p>Around the world, Australians are commemorating Anzac Day, a day that has become central to our identity as a nation; a day when we remember the Australian fallen; a day when we reflect on the price of war; a day when we reflect on our national identity - what it means to come together and fight, what it means to show courage, what it means to show mateship in adversity. I'm looking forward to a Gunfire Breakfast with the veterans.</p>
<p>Then I will be moving on to a series of meetings here in South Korea. Most particularly, I am looking forward to meeting again with President Lee. I've had the opportunity to meet President Lee of Korea before. Of course, I was here in Seoul when he hosted the G20 Summit.</p>
<p>In that meeting with President Lee, I will be talking about all the issues in our broad and deep relationship. I intend to particularly focus on our economic ties. Korea is an important trading partner for Australia and we want to add to that trade through a free trade agreement, and I will be talking to President Lee about the prospects for concluding that free trade agreement.</p>
<p>I will also be talking to President Lee about outlooks for the G20, the East Asia Summit and APEC. Of course, President Lee will have a special perspective on the forthcoming G20, having played the role as the host and the chair of the last G20. I'm also looking forward to talking to him about our important regional meetings later this year, including the East Asia Summit, with its broadened membership, and we hope of course that it will fulfill its role with its broadened mandate, engaging itself in political questions, economic questions and security questions. I will of course be talking about our defence links with Korea to President Lee, so I am very much looking forward to that meeting.</p>
<p>I will then leave Korea to visit China, and of course following China I will be attending the Royal wedding, before returning to Australia.</p>
<p>I'm very happy to talk questions.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:  You will talk about defence ties. How much of that will focus on China?</p>
<p>PM:We have a strong defence ties with Korea, and of course we cooperate on a broad range of issues: on counterterrorism; on cyber-security; on a broad range of transnational issues, so it is going to comprehend the full breadth of our relationship.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, are you hoping that your presence here, at this Anzac Day service here today, will help raise awareness among ordinary Australians about Korean War veterans?</p>
<p>PM: I've been hoping throughout this trip, by being here for the 60th anniversary of the Battle of Kapyong, that I will be able to put a focus on that Battle and on the Korean War. The Korean War has often been referred to as the âforgotten war'. The Battle of Kapyong itself was referred to as the âforgotten battle' of the âforgotten war'. I'd like Australians to remember the heroism our veterans showed, our fighting personnel showed, in this place 60 years ago.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, how does it feel that you're the first, how much impact do you think it has that you're the first Prime Minister to be here on Anzac Day?</p>
<p>PM:I think, particularly, to the veterans who fought here in Korea it has a real meaning. They have felt the burden of having their particular efforts not well remembered in Australia. Many of them have said to me over the last few days that they have felt that Australian history and the Australian nation has not appropriately appreciated their contribution here in Korea, so one thing I've wanted to achieve is to put a spotlight on the heroism and dedication of the Australians who served here, and I hope in a small way I've achieved that. </p>
<p>We'll just go to Sabra and come across.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:Prime Minister, how confident are you that you will actually have free trade deals signed and agreed to after today. Is that a real prospect, or-</p>
<p>PM:-Well, we're not looking to sign a free trade agreement today, but I am hoping that in my discussions with President Lee to inject momentum into the free trade agreement discussions between Australian and Korea. I believe we can reach agreement, and I certainly believe we should reach agreement. An agreement between Korea and Australia is in the interest of both our nations. It's in Australia's interests, particularly in the interests of our agricultural sector.</p>
<p>We won't be entering into an agreement today, I can guarantee you that. We won't be entering into an agreement today.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:On a personal level Prime Minister, how does it make you, how special is it for you to be marking Anzac Day here in Korea?</p>
<p>PM:On a personal level, it really is a remarkable opportunity. I've commemorated Anzac Day in Australia all of my life. I've never travelled overseas for Anzac Day before. Since being a member of parliament, I've spent Anzac Day in my own constituency, including remembrances in Milton and then in central Melbourne. To be able to be here for Anzac Day does mean I'm missing those events back home, but it's a really remarkable experience to have spent yesterday in the site of a major battle in which Australians fought so bravely, and then to spend time here in this amazing war memorial, with Australian veterans, commemorating our Anzac spirit generally, but also particularly thinking about their special service here in Korea.</p>
<p>We'll go to Matthew and then come through.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:Prime Minister, your program in China is heavily focused on business meetings, as well as the political stuff, but you'll be meeting with Australian businesspeople. How important is it for Australian to broaden, not only to increase its resource exports to China, but also to broaden its business links across a lot of areas, and how important is that to Australia's economic future?</p>
<p>PM:Well, China is an incredibly important economic partner for our country. Of course, it's our single biggest export market, taking itself, around 25 per cent of Australian exports. Certainly our economic relationship is going to be a key focus of my trip to China.</p>
<p>My trip is coinciding with events involving major chief executives of Australian businesses, people like Marius Kloppers from BHP, Sam Walsh from Rio Tinto, to name just a couple, who are attending a CEO forum, and then there is a major trade event as well, involving a far broader range of Australian business people. So, it's a key focus of my trip, to be there seeking to strengthen our economic relationship.</p>
<p>A prosperous China and a prosperous Australia trading together is good for both countries, and that trade can increase both of our prosperities. It's one of the reasons that I'll be there, with a focus on meeting Australian businesspeople, meeting Chinese businesspeople, and fostering links between the two.</p>
<p>PM:Prime Minister, yesterday you got to see the legacy of the Korean War up close and personal, and they got to see you up close and personal. Tell us what that was like, looking at these North Koreans looking at you, studying you?</p>
<p>PM:Yes, I did visit the De-Militarised Zone. I have remarked that that really is a great misuse of the English language. There's more military intensity in that zone, that 200-odd kilometres than I suspect in many other places on the planet. Certainly, military everywhere, and I had the unusual experience of being in a building and being so closely observed by North Korean soldiers. It's an unusual experience personally, to be stared at like that, but more importantly than that, it really is an emblem of the kind of insecurity that our friends in South Korea live with.</p>
<p>I mean, we're standing in this modern prosperous city, and in some ways you could think, we'll you're in a modern, prosperous and safe environment, but of course the South Korean people live day-to-day with insecurity because of the circumstances on the Korean peninsula, and what I saw yesterday, I think, is an emblem that reminds of all of that.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:Prime Minister, can I ask you about ethnic Chinese who have been arrested or detained, Australians, in China? Are you concerned that there is a bit of a pattern developing with Stern Hu, Matthew, and some others. Could you give us any updates about their circumstances, and will you be asking for reassurances in China that just because your ethnicity is Chinese, doesn't mean you're not Australian?</p>
<p>PM:Look, certainly there are a number of individual cases where we continue to provide consular support, and, as necessary, we raise consular cases with the Chinese authorities. More broadly, of course, we engage in human rights dialogue with China. As I've said to you, during the course of this trip, I believe that a prosperous China that's strongly engaged with the region is good for the region, and it's good for Australia.</p>
<p>We've got a constructive relationship with China, but we do have differences, and when we have those differences, we're very clear in our raising of them, we're very clear in our raising of human rights questions, and we've got an ongoing human rights dialogue and we're certainly very vigorous in pursuing the interests of Australian citizens in China who may need consular assistance in any way.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:Prime Minister, how much arm-twisting do you think Sam Walsh and Marius Kloppers will try on with you while you're in Beijing to try and secure a better deal for their own companies under your proposed carbon tax?</p>
<p>PM:I think Marius Kloppers and Sam Walsh know I'm a woman of determination.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:Have you ever been to China before?</p>
<p>PM:Yes,I have. I led an Australian Political Exchange Council delegation there, a cross-Party delegation, and that was a fantastic experience, so I'm looking forward to going back.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:When was that and how many times have you been to China since?</p>
<p>PM:I feared you were going to ask me that. When was that? It was, I believe, let me just think about this. It was around 2000-2001. We'll have to get the exact dates for you.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:Are you expecting a warm reception?</p>
<p>PM:Look, I'm expecting, you know, it to be in pursuit of a constructive relationship. I have had the opportunity to meet both President Hu and Premier Wen before and personally found that I was able to engage with them so I think that that will continue on this trip to China.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:Need to get some gloves on those hands.</p>
<p>PM:You're all distracting me by bobbing up and down in unusual patterns, so we better get you inside I think.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, can I just ask you about the American alliance? Do think there are concerns with China that Australia is strengthening the alliance at expense of the relationship? </p>
<p>PM:Look, for Australia this is not an either/or question. We are a long-standing alliance partner of the United States. China knows, and that alliance will continue for the future, and China knows that as well. This is not an either/or question. We can have our strong, long-standing friendship and alliance with the United States, based as it is on shared values, as well as have a positive and constructive engagement with China.</p>
<p>OK, let's get you inside before we've got, you know, people dropping. </p>
