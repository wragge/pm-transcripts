STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON. P. J. KEATING<br />
FICHTSACK UNRAVELS HOWARD HUMILIATED<br />
Dr Hewson has tonight publicly humiliated his industrial<br />
relations spokesman John Howard by directly contradicting<br />
Howard's assurance that there would be no change to<br />
industrial relations policy.<br />
This morning Mr Howard circled the wagons around his<br />
industrial relations policy and sent a message to the<br />
Liberal leadership:<br />
" Well, there certainly won't be any changes to our<br />
industrial relations policy because our industrial<br />
relations policy has the right balance of radicalism<br />
with security and protection."<br />
Only hours later, in an interview on A Current Affair, Dr<br />
Hewson repudiated Mr Howard's claim by stating:<br />
" We are keeping the industrial relations policy, but<br />
we can have a look at it again, see whether we can't<br />
improve it."<br />
ThQ Liberal Party is now in utter disarray.<br />
Their leader has panicked and in the panic Liberal and<br />
National Party MPs are tripping over themselves to make<br />
changes to Fightback.<br />
Dr Hewson is now a leader in name only.<br />
If we no longer need Fightback, if the once essential<br />
prescription for Australia is no longer needed, then why<br />
do we need Dr Hewson?<br />
