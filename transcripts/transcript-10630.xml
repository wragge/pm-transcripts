    <content><![CDATA[<p>E&amp;OE........................................................</p>
<p>TUCKER:</p>
<p>Welcome and thank you for your time.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>It's very nice to be here Carolyn.</p>
<p>TUCKER:</p>
<p>Could we start with Wik, you met with the Queensland Premier for</p>
<p>   the first time yesterday. He's really saying that the issue</p>
<p>   has not been solved it's just been dumped on the states.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>That wasn't the tenure of the private discussion we had. I</p>
<p>   think we will be able to work together quite well on this issue.</p>
<p>   It's obviously in the interests of Queensland that it have</p>
<p>   the same approach as other resource states such as Western Australia.</p>
<p>   It wouldn't help the mining industry in Queensland if there</p>
<p>   were more rigid conditions in this state than prevailed in Western</p>
<p>   Australia and it would be in the interests of the pastoral community</p>
<p>   in Queensland that we have, throughout Australia, a uniform approach.</p>
<p>Now I understand that within the Labor Party there are differing</p>
<p>   views on Native Title. I do acknowledge that but, in the end, I</p>
<p>   believe there will be a uniform national system, and that Queensland</p>
<p>   will probably adopt the state based approach which was contemplated</p>
<p>   when we brought our Bill into the Parliament. That is an approach</p>
<p>   that does not involve the right to negotiate but rather the replacement</p>
<p>   for the right to negotiate that I agreed with Senator Harradine,</p>
<p>   but that is a matter for Mr Beattie to...</p>
<p>TUCKER:</p>
<p>Has he indicated to you that's what he was after?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, he and I had quite a positive, constructive discussion. We</p>
<p>   may come from opposite sides of the political fence, but my responsibility</p>
<p>   is to the Australians who live in Queensland. And I am concerned</p>
<p>   about their future and the Native Title deal that I made with Senator</p>
<p>   Harradine benefits them enormously because it brings to an end almost</p>
<p>   five years of angst and dispute and difference and people are immensely</p>
<p>   relieved and this deal will deliver security to the farmers of Queensland</p>
<p>   and give hope to the mining industry and will deliver justice to</p>
<p>   the Aboriginal people of this state. So it is a win, win, win for</p>
<p>   the different interest groups in Queensland.</p>
<p>TUCKER:</p>
<p>So, you would support a national approach because of the concern</p>
<p>   about cross boarder claims and so on, would you be willing to organise</p>
<p>   that? To get the Ministers and Premiers together?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I don't know that a meeting will be necessary, but if it is</p>
<p>   I would be very happy to bring it together. I want this issue put</p>
<p>   finally behind us. I want an effort to achieve future unity on this</p>
<p>   issue. It has been divisive. It has been a disappointment to the</p>
<p>   indigenous people. It's been a great source of frustration</p>
<p>   and angst to the farming community. And also lost investment to</p>
<p>   the mining industry. Now, none of that is good for Australia or</p>
<p>   good for Queensland. So I am sure we can work it out. And I am sure</p>
<p>   that common sense on both sides of the political fence, now that</p>
<p>   the debate is over and the law has been changed, I think common</p>
<p>   sense will prevail.</p>
<p>TUCKER:</p>
<p>If you have just joined us, you are with Carolyn Tucker and Prime</p>
<p>   Minister, John Howard, on Brisbane 612 4QR and your local ABC. It's</p>
<p>   coming up to twenty four to nine now. Mr Howard on to Telstra. Obviously</p>
<p>   considerable amount of wrangling over that as well. Not all of your</p>
<p>   National Party colleagues are convinced. Bob Katter,</p>
<p>   De-Anne Kelly, Mal Colston is indicating that he might vote against</p>
<p>   it. Brian Harradine seems pretty luke warm on the idea. How are</p>
<p>   you going to convince all of these people?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, you never know with the Senate until the vote is actually</p>
<p>   taken. And I don't count any of my Senate chickens before they're</p>
<p>   hatched, particularly as far as the independents are concerned.</p>
<p>   Liberal and National Party Senators and Members approached the Government</p>
<p>   for a better communications deal for the bush. This occurred some</p>
<p>   time ago and it was always my intention that there be some additional</p>
<p>   support for telecommunications in the bush coming out of the full</p>
<p>   privatisation of Telstra. You may remember that when I announced</p>
<p>   it in March, I said there would be a social bonus. The social bonus</p>
<p>   is not something that has been dreamt up in the last few weeks and</p>
<p>   it's not something that has been dreamt up since the Queensland</p>
<p>   election. It was always the intention that something additional</p>
<p>   be done to help communications in remote areas of Australia. And</p>
<p>   that is what has happened. But it will only be possible to do a</p>
<p>   lot of things if we have the full privatisation of Telstra. If you</p>
<p>   don't have the full privatisation of Telstra you don't</p>
<p>   have the money to do a lot of the additional things that we want</p>
<p>   to do.</p>
<p>Now, Liberals and Nationals, and bear in mind that the Liberal</p>
<p>   Party for example probably holds more rural seats than any other</p>
<p>   party in Australia, those Members and Senators together have put</p>
<p>   views on behalf of their constituents and we are responding. But</p>
<p>   we always did intend that part of the social bonus would be in the</p>
<p>   rural communications area.</p>
<p>TUCKER:</p>
<p>But there does seem to be some doubt about the measures that you</p>
<p>   have announced already as to whether they will be enough? Do you</p>
<p>   think they will be?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, in a sense nothing is ever enough but it is a huge difference</p>
<p>   if you have the capacity out of the sale of perhaps $40 billion</p>
<p>   not only to reduce debt and give to the younger generations of the</p>
<p>   twenty first century a debt free future, in a national sense, but</p>
<p>   if you've got those resources you can afford to spend more</p>
<p>   than if you don't have them. And it is as simple as that. If</p>
<p>   you have got the proceeds of the sale you can do more. You can afford</p>
<p>   to put a social bonus in the direction of additional communications</p>
<p>   for rural areas. If you don't sell Telstra, you can't</p>
<p>   do that. I mean it is in Australia's interests that we sell</p>
<p>   the remaining two thirds of Telstra. And I am not doing it because</p>
<p>   of some ideological commitment, I am doing it because I can use</p>
<p>   the proceeds to reduce Australia's huge national debt. And</p>
<p>   use some of the proceeds for good things like, further upgrading</p>
<p>   the bush communications and other purposes that will at the appropriate</p>
<p>   time, be announced.</p>
<p>TUCKER:</p>
<p>I was hoping this might be the appropriate time.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, no. We have a very important announcement from Mr Fischer and</p>
<p>   Senator Alston on behalf of the Government today. And one significant</p>
<p>   announcement a day is quite sufficient in this area. And it will</p>
<p>   be something that is very beneficial for the remote areas of Australia</p>
<p>   for people who feel that they have been left behind in the on-line</p>
<p>   communications era in which people in the city now revel. And it's</p>
<p>   giving them a life which was just undreamt of by the previous generation</p>
<p>   and I do not want an Australia where you have communications haves</p>
<p>   and communications have nots. That would bring a new barrier, a</p>
<p>   new gap, a new distance between remote area Australians and the</p>
<p>   rest of the Australian community. So having the proceeds of the</p>
<p>   Telstra sale allows us to do a lot more. Without those proceeds</p>
<p>   we can't do those additional things.</p>
<p>TUCKER:</p>
<p>Those additional things that you are planning to do. Will they</p>
<p>   be sufficient to win back those disenchanted voters in the bush</p>
<p>   that are casting around for someone else to vote for and thinking</p>
<p>   about Pauline Hanson?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, that is a matter for them. We live in a democracy.</p>
<p>TUCKER:</p>
<p>Surely it is a matter for you too?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, no, it is a matter for me to say what is good for Australia.</p>
<p>   To lay out a programme to talk to people. To explain, advocate,</p>
<p>   argue and put my case. In the end the voters will decide who they</p>
<p>   want as their government. And at the next federal election there</p>
<p>   are only two possible outcomes. The one outcome is that the Coalition</p>
<p>   led by me is returned. Another outcome is that the Labor Party led</p>
<p>   by Mr Beazley becomes the government. Now, they are the two outcomes.</p>
<p>   Now, of course I am conscious of what happened here in Queensland,</p>
<p>   but I am also conscious that the worst way of responding to that</p>
<p>   would be give up on doing those things that you believe are good</p>
<p>   for Australia. I am not going to give away things that I believe</p>
<p>   in. I am not going to give away things that I regard as important</p>
<p>   to the future of Australia in the vain belief that that will win</p>
<p>   back support. It won't. It will lose you more respect. What</p>
<p>   people want from me as the Prime Minister of Australia is for me</p>
<p>   to campaign and to argue for and to support those things that I</p>
<p>   believe are good for the country. And I will take my outcome like</p>
<p>   any other political leader at the ballot box. But I believe in tax</p>
<p>   reform because I think it would be good for Australia to have a</p>
<p>   fairer taxation system and I am not going to walk away from that.</p>
<p>   I believe that privatising Telstra is good for Australia because</p>
<p>   it will help us pay off debt and provide more communications facilities</p>
<p>   for the bush and that's good for Australia. Not good for me</p>
<p>   or good for the Coalition. It's good for the country. And that's</p>
<p>   why I am going to continue to push it. I am not going to take the</p>
<p>   advice of those who say that I should go away in a corner and do</p>
<p>   nothing through fear of offending people. They don't want that</p>
<p>   from their Government. They want me to get out there and argue the</p>
<p>   things that I believe are good for the future of Australia.</p>
<p>TUCKER:</p>
<p>If you are doing the things that people want you to .....</p>
<p>(tape break)</p>
<p>Pauline Hanson continue to rise?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well Carolyn, I think you are drawing on opinion polls that do</p>
<p>   bounce around. Let's wait and see. I mean, we are only a few</p>
<p>   weeks away from the Queensland election. The ultimate test of all</p>
<p>   of this is in the ballot box whenever the next federal election</p>
<p>   is held and we are living in a more volatile political climate.</p>
<p>   People do bounce around more. Their political allegiances are less</p>
<p>   tribal and less rusted on. There are fewer people who say ÂI</p>
<p>   always vote Labor because that's how Mum and Dad voted',</p>
<p>   or vice versa with the Coalition. We are just living in a different</p>
<p>   world now and you have to respond differently, but my approach is</p>
<p>   to argue even the harder for those things that I believe are in</p>
<p>   the interests of Australians, and I'm not going to be diverted</p>
<p>   from that because that's your ultimate responsibility. Once</p>
<p>   you stop doing that you might as well give the game away.</p>
<p>TUCKER:</p>
<p>Are we living in a world where life is simply not going to get</p>
<p>   easier? We've been tightening our belts and waiting for life</p>
<p>   to become simple and easy again. Is it just not going to happen?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>That's true in relation to a lot of things. We are living</p>
<p>   in a very different world, and people understandably want to hang</p>
<p>   on to the verities of the past. I'm no different from anybody</p>
<p>   else. There are things about my past and there are things about</p>
<p>   the Australia that I grew up in that I want to hang on to and part</p>
<p>   of that is the bush. I mean, although I grew up in Sydney I had</p>
<p>   an affectionate, almost romantic view about the bush. It's</p>
<p>   part of Australia and I just can't envisage the Australia that</p>
<p>   I grew up in without the bush, because it is part of our identity,</p>
<p>   it is part of what we see in ourselves as Australians. Our lives</p>
<p>   have changed, and one of the reasons why a party like One Nation</p>
<p>   can come along and offer simplistic solutions and get a bit of support</p>
<p>   is that a lot of people are suffering the consequences of economic</p>
<p>   and social change. Now, my responsibility as Prime Minister is to</p>
<p>   try and alleviate that change, that pain and difficulty, to try</p>
<p>   and lessen it, but not to pretend to them that I've got some</p>
<p>   magic wand solution, not to offer them false hope, and for example,</p>
<p>   people say you've got to stop imports to save our industries.</p>
<p>   Well, if we stop imports, other people will stop our exports and</p>
<p>   we'll end up being a lot worse off.</p>
<p>TUCKER:</p>
<p>So the rural producers really stand to lose....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, they don't. Rural producers actually stand to gain from</p>
<p>   a more open approach to trade.</p>
<p>TUCKER:</p>
<p>Yes, I meant by closing the doors.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Absolutely. The worst thing that you could do for the rural producers</p>
<p>   would be to put up the trade barriers because we would immediately</p>
<p>   suffer retaliation. Our beef industry, our sugar industry, two great</p>
<p>   Queensland industries would be knocked for six if we adopted a restrictive</p>
<p>   approach to trade and thousands of people would lose their jobs</p>
<p>   and the livelihoods of many people would be affected. And these</p>
<p>   are the things that are not always easy to argue and get a speedy</p>
<p>   response, but in the long run they represent the truth and I have</p>
<p>   to argue that case. I also have to recognise though that if you</p>
<p>   live in a remote part of Australia and you see people in the city</p>
<p>   getting high class communications and you are not getting it, you</p>
<p>   are going to feel envious and you are going to say this is not fair,</p>
<p>   and that's why I want to use some of the proceeds of the sale</p>
<p>   of Telstra to give to those people some benefits they would not</p>
<p>   otherwise have.</p>
<p>TUCKER:</p>
<p>Tell us about your compensation package for workers in the textile</p>
<p>   industry?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, this was something that was promised at the time of the decision</p>
<p>   to slow down the rate of tariff reduction in the TCF industry last</p>
<p>   year. And the whole purpose of it is to provide more security and</p>
<p>   predictability after the Year 2000, and it replaces and enhances</p>
<p>   an existing scheme which is designed to provide incentives and security</p>
<p>   of investment in the industry. Now, we've given to the textile</p>
<p>   industry a far better deal than was recommended by the Productivity</p>
<p>   Commission. If you like they wanted to administer a colder bath</p>
<p>   to the industry than we did. I mean, we believe in greater competition</p>
<p>   but we also understand that in many regional parts of Australia</p>
<p>   the textile clothing and footwear industry employs a lot of people,</p>
<p>   employs a lot of migrant people, employs a lot of women, and if</p>
<p>   you just take the protection away overnight, you are going to cause</p>
<p>   a lot of unnecessary hardships. So we have struck what I regard</p>
<p>   as a happy medium. We've continued the process of greater competition</p>
<p>   but we've slowed down the rate of change in the rate of tariff</p>
<p>   reduction and that decision was widely welcomed and the announcement</p>
<p>   that Mr Moore will make in Melbourne today will give the industry</p>
<p>   a guide path in to the first years of the 21st Century.</p>
<p>TUCKER:</p>
<p>Would it be reasonable for our pork producers to look at that and</p>
<p>   think why can't you organise something like that for us?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, we have offered and we are implementing a programme that</p>
<p>   gives export support to that industry.</p>
<p>TUCKER:</p>
<p>And that's all they are getting?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, there are other things that are being considered in relation</p>
<p>   to the pork industry as well as that. You've got to remember</p>
<p>   that the changes that the pork industry is now operating on came</p>
<p>   into force in 1990 and it is not something that has been changed</p>
<p>   in the last few months. It's something that has been, that</p>
<p>   was changed back in 1990 and the level of import penetration in</p>
<p>   that industry is only about 5%. Now, they will argue that it's</p>
<p>   quite high in one of the sensitive areas of the market but the import</p>
<p>   penetration, the number of imports in the textile clothing and footwear</p>
<p>   industry is much greater than five per cent. So you are dealing</p>
<p>   with a situation where the total level of imports in the pork industry</p>
<p>   is much lower than the total level of imports in the textile industry.</p>
<p>   The problem with the pork industry Carolyn is that there is an over</p>
<p>   supply, the world price of pork has been quite depressed. Some of</p>
<p>   that is due to changed consumer habits. We are looking at different</p>
<p>   ways through the programmes that have already been announced of</p>
<p>   helping people to adjust and also to provide them with support while</p>
<p>   they are going through that period of adjustment.</p>
<p>TUCKER:</p>
<p>A couple of quick questions before I let you go. Do you have a</p>
<p>   timeframe that you are prepared to reveal on tax reform?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Carolyn, I can say that it will be out soon. I don't want</p>
<p>   to put weeks or months on that but Peter Costello and I have worked</p>
<p>   very hard on this package. We've consulted a lot of people,</p>
<p>   there's further consultation. It will be a good package for</p>
<p>   Australia. It will give Australia a fairer tax system. We won't</p>
<p>   be introducing a Goods and Services Tax on its own. We won't</p>
<p>   be introducing a Goods and Services Tax on top of the existing system.</p>
<p>   If we bring in a Goods and Services Tax, it will replace the wholesale</p>
<p>   sales tax and other indirect taxes. It won't be there on top</p>
<p>   of the existing system, and any suggestion that everything is going</p>
<p>   to go up by Âx' per cent or Ây' per cent is</p>
<p>   quite wrong. We'll also have personal tax cuts. It will be</p>
<p>   a very good package for rural Australia, it will be a good package</p>
<p>   for people with children and overall it is going to deliver a tax</p>
<p>   system that is a lot fairer than the present one. Now, I know it</p>
<p>   is hard. I know Mr Beazley will run a fear campaign. The Labor Party</p>
<p>   will be very negative. They will run on fear and despondency and</p>
<p>   I know that represents an electoral challenge.</p>
<p>TUCKER:</p>
<p>There's a fair bit of fear and despondency getting about at</p>
<p>   the moment.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>But does Australia want from their Prime Minister in the face of</p>
<p>   that fear and despondency further fear and despondency? Or do they</p>
<p>   want their Prime Minister to say to them this is what I think is</p>
<p>   good for the future of Australia, I believe in a fairer tax system.</p>
<p>   I'll put it to you, I'll argue the case. If you reject</p>
<p>   that case and you reject me well I will accept that with the best</p>
<p>   of goodwill but at least I will have tried. At least I will have</p>
<p>   tried to give to Australia a fairer taxation system. Now, I know</p>
<p>   it is going to be hard, and there are plenty of people who are saying</p>
<p>   to me, ÂJohn don't do it - be cautious, be careful'</p>
<p>   but I've reached that stage where I don't want to be ultra-cautious</p>
<p>   or ultra-careful. I've reached that stage where I believe the</p>
<p>   best thing I can do for the Australians who elected my Government,</p>
<p>   the Government, is to argue for what I think is good and if it is</p>
<p>   rejected and I fail in that attempt, well, I will have tried and</p>
<p>   the Australian people will have made a decision and I will accept</p>
<p>   it. Now, I have a sneaking feeling that if we do it well, then they</p>
<p>   may in fact support it, but that's a matter for them.</p>
<p>TUCKER:</p>
<p>And when do they get the opportunity to ....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, at the right time. Like every other Prime Minister before</p>
<p>   me I reserve the right to sort of go when it is appropriate. I want</p>
<p>   people to have an opportunity of examining the tax package. I certainly</p>
<p>   don't intend to drop it and go off to the Governor-General</p>
<p>   asking for an election the next day. I want people to have a look</p>
<p>   at it, to work out what is in it. It won't be over complicated,</p>
<p>   and there will be plenty of effort made by the members of the Government</p>
<p>   to explain it to people and to go around the country answering questions</p>
<p>   about it, because it will be a terrific break from the past. It's</p>
<p>   something we've needed for a long time. Deep down, most Australians</p>
<p>   think the present taxation system is a bit unfair and it does need</p>
<p>   to be changed, and I can't promise everybody will be happy,</p>
<p>   but I do think the bulk of people will see it as a fair attempt</p>
<p>   to deliver a fairer system, and particular sections who need a bit</p>
<p>   of help and protection, I mean, pensioners have nothing to fear</p>
<p>   from it.</p>
<p>TUCKER:</p>
<p>How about the unemployed?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, the unemployed will benefit in that a fairer, more effective</p>
<p>   taxation system will be more attractive to business and that will</p>
<p>   improve their prospects of getting jobs. Once again, no simple way</p>
<p>   overnight of responding to that, but if you have a tax system that</p>
<p>   is more efficient and is easier for business to administer then</p>
<p>   it leaves more room, more resources, more opportunity to employ</p>
<p>   people.</p>
<p>TUCKER:</p>
<p>It is difficult times ahead for Australia though, the rest of the</p>
<p>   year no question about it. Is there anything else you can do to</p>
<p>   safeguard us against the effects of the region?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>We can go on doing what we've done for the last two-and-a-quarter</p>
<p>   years and that is get our economic house in order. I mean, if we</p>
<p>   had not cut our deficit, reduced the big debt we inherited from</p>
<p>   Mr Beazley, if we had not turned a deficit of $10.5 billion into</p>
<p>   a surplus, we'd now be more at the mercy of the forces that</p>
<p>   are raging through the Asia-Pacific region. It is difficult and</p>
<p>   although Australia has not been left unaffected, we would have been</p>
<p>   more badly knocked around and hurt if we had not taken those remedial</p>
<p>   steps and by taking those steps, we've given Australia an inner</p>
<p>   strength and a protection that we would not otherwise have had and</p>
<p>   that's the message I would deliver to your listeners, that</p>
<p>   if we hadn't have done those things, we would have had higher</p>
<p>   interest rates, higher inflation, a more vulnerable economy....</p>
<p>TUCKER:</p>
<p>I hate to use the expression, but is this Âas good as it gets'?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
