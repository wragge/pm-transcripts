FOR MEDIA20 February 1985<br />
The talks with the Council of Procedural Specialists broke<br />
down with no satisfactory solution.<br />

It is absurd of them to pretend that there is some distinction<br />
between the views of Dr Blewett and the Government's policy..<br />
Both the Federal and NSW Governments are adamant that the basic<br />
