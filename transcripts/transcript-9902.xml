TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
DOORSTOP, RAAF FAIRBAIRN, MONDAY, 15 JANUARY 1996<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
PM. I will just give you a brief comment. On this, as all of my overseas<br />
trips, I will be going to look after Australia's economic and security<br />
interests. Of course, I have been to Singapore three times. This is my<br />
first visit to Malaysia, but I have met the * Prime Ministers of both<br />
countries on many occasions. These are old relationships for<br />
Australia, but we need to keep them in a contemporary setting and<br />
hence the value of the visit and talking to them and doing things with<br />
them. I think it is worth reminding people that our two way trade with<br />
both these countries is about $ 10 billion and it is growing at 20 per<br />
cent a year. So, these are two very important countries to Australia<br />
and I am looking forward to going.<br />
J Flow important is it that Australia consolidates its relationship with<br />
Malaysia?<br />
PM: It is important that we consolidate our relationship with all the countries<br />
of ASEAN and our near neighbourhood and we have been doing that.<br />
we hav-egot very good bilateral relationships with Indonesia, most<br />
obviously manifested in the treaty last year, with Singapore who we<br />
have worked with on many other Issues as well and Malaysia and the<br />
Philippines. I don't think our relationships in the area have been any<br />
better.<br />
J: Will you be pressing the Prime Minister on the Gillespie children?<br />
PM: No, I think, as with all human questions this is, like many family things<br />
a human tragedy, but it is essentially a legal matter. But, any<br />
information Mrs Gillespie has I am happy to hand on to our High<br />
Commissioner and he can propose it.<br />
ends </p>
