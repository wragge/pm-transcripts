    <content><![CDATA[<p>Acknowledgments</p>
<p>Thank you Ann Sanders for that kind introduction.</p>
<p>Mr Robin Crawford, Chairman of the Sydney Cancer Centre</p>
<p>Professor Chris O'Brien, Board Director, the Sydney Cancer Centre Foundation</p>
<p>Professor Michael Boyer, Director, the Sydney Cancer Centre</p>
<p>It is an honour to be here today to offer my support for such a worthy cause.</p>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>Australia is fortunate in many ways.</p>
<p>We have world-class health practitioners.</p>
<p>We have world-class health researchers.</p>
<p>And we have a proud record of achievement in medical science.</p>
<p>However, we also have much more to do.</p>
<p>There remains so much that we can do better and so much that we still don't know.</p>
<p>The gap between our aspirations and our achievements remains large  -  perhaps more so in cancer than in other areas, as cancer remains a large-scale killer.</p>
<p>Health policy challenges</p>
<p>The challenge is to not only close this gap, but to do so in the face of new pressures transforming health policy.</p>
<p>We face rising expectations and demands, alongside an ageing population, an explosion in chronic disease and rapid growth in the costs of medical technology.</p>
<p>These changes bring with them challenges for our entire health system  -  and not least for oncology.</p>
<p>The turmoil, and too often the tragedy, of cancer is something that has touched the lives of millions of Australian families.</p>
<p>Nearly half a million Australians are diagnosed with cancer each year.</p>
<p>The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare estimates that one in three men and one in four women will be directly affected by cancer before the age of 75.</p>
<p>Nearly 40,000 Australians each year die from cancer  -  accounting for nearly a third of all male deaths and a quarter of all female deaths.</p>
<p>Around three-quarters of cancers are less threatening types of skin cancer (non-melanocytic skin cancer).</p>
<p>Many forms of cancer are preventable  -  and are driven by similar risk factors to other major chronic diseases.</p>
<p>Smoking, alcohol abuse, poor diet and a lack of exercise are the main culprits  -  and we will need a transformation within health policy to tackle them.</p>
<p>This is a transformation that must change behaviours and shift cultures  -  among Australians of all ages.</p>
<p>And while prevention is better than cure, we often have neither option.</p>
<p>Ongoing commitment is needed to achieve the new breakthroughs that will save lives  -  and this must be supported by governments.</p>
<p>And until those breakthroughs come, we must rely on earlier detection and more effective treatment.</p>
<p>On early detection, we are making some progress on this front and in the recent Budget we extended bowel cancer screening to all those turning 50, 55 and 65.</p>
<p>And on treatment, our survival rates are also improving. Five-year survival rates for the most common cancers affecting men (prostate) and women (breast) are now more than 80 per cent. </p>
<p>The patient perspective</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the heroic efforts of many in the health system, there is one perspective that needs a greater focus in health policy, and particularly in the fight against cancer.</p>
<p>That is the patient perspective.</p>
<p>An honest appraisal of how well we, collectively, meet the needs of patients provides the most compelling argument of all for health reform.</p>
<p>Living with cancer can be one of the most difficult experiences imaginable for patients, and for their families and friends.</p>
<p>It can bring the toughest of us back to earth with a thud, as it reminds us of what is truly important in life.</p>
<p>For many Australians, this most difficult time is made all the harder by the complex maze of services  -  Commonwealth and State, public and private  -  that must be navigated.</p>
<p>Having cancer is stressful enough.</p>
<p>But the task of accessing the right testing, treatment and monitoring services should not make it harder still.</p>
<p>We simply must do better on this front, and this desire to do better for patients is at the heart of our Government's commitment to fundamental health reform.</p>
<p>Translating research into patient care</p>
<p>The quality of treatment patients receive is also critical.</p>
<p>This is underpinned by the quality of our research base, our ability to translate research into practice, and the infrastructure, workforce and systems that support this.</p>
<p>In Washington recently I had dinner with a group of Australians working in the United States.</p>
<p>One of them was Dr Richard Pestell, Director of the Kimmel Cancer Centre.</p>
<p>Like many of the people here at the Sydney Cancer Centre, he has dedicated his life to the fight against cancer.</p>
<p>And like many others I have talked to in this field, Dr Pestell stressed to me the importance of cooperation and knowledge-sharing in the fight against cancer.</p>
<p>If we are to close the gap between aspiration and achievement in health, we need to bridge the divide between research and clinical practice.</p>
<p>I want to see Australians receive the best care available, and for this to occur we must be able to translate the best research into practice.</p>
<p>This requires cooperation not only among researchers, but also between researchers and clinicians to give our knowledge and our breakthroughs the widest possible reach.</p>
<p>Through the recent Budget, the Government is investing a record level of support for cancer research centres and projects.</p>
<p>In 2006-07, the previous government allocated $58 million to cancer specific programs. In 2008-09, the Government is allocating $214 million to cancer specific programs.</p>
<p>The Government's increased funding is particularly focused on supporting cancer research.</p>
<p>The Government's commitment includes (though is not limited to):</p>
<p>     * An extra $87 million over three years to expand National Bowel Cancer Screening.</p>
<p>     * $15 million over three years to support young people with cancer for the first time, through CanTeen.</p>
<p>     * $15 million over three years for independent clinical trials of drugs and research into cancer treatment and care.</p>
<p>     * $15 million over five years to set up two dedicated prostate cancer research centres.</p>
<p>     * $15 million over two years to help build a Children's Cancer Centre at the Women's and Children's Hospital in Adelaide.</p>
<p>     * $15 million over two years towards the establishment of the Olivia Newton-John Cancer Centre at the Austin Hospital in Melbourne.</p>
<p>     * $5.1 million over three years for the operation of the National Centre for Gynaecological Cancers, under the auspices of Cancer Australia.</p>
<p>Sydney Cancer Centre</p>
<p>The Government is also a proud supporter of the Sydney Cancer Centre.</p>
<p>I'm pleased to announce that the Government's 2008-09 Budget provides an initial contribution of $50 million towards the Sydney Cancer Centre.</p>
<p>I can also announce today that the Government will continue its engagement with the Centre and, subject to a business case, be favourably disposed towards additional financial support.</p>
<p>The success of the Sydney Cancer Centre  -  and its potential going forward  -  in no small part rests on its capacity to integrate research and practice.</p>
<p>The Sydney Cancer Centre has an enviable record as a centre of research.</p>
<p>But it is the holistic approach to cancer care where I see the real innovation and potential.</p>
<p>By translating research into practical strategies for patients  -  to treat the disease, to deal with causes and help with recovery  -  we can deliver better care and improve quality of life.</p>
<p>Through co-location, the two-way interaction of research and practice can sometimes transform both research and practice for the better.</p>
<p>Let me acknowledge your support for the Sydney Cancer Centre in helping to close the gap between aspiration and achievement.</p>
<p>Fundraising is a crucial part of this equation  -  and success would not be possible without it.</p>
<p>The Centre's success also depends on the hard work of many dedicated staff  -  who I would like to acknowledge.</p>
<p>This is a bold project with the potential to save the lives of many, and improve quality of life for many more.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, it is my pleasure to be with you on this occasion.</p>
<p>In congratulating the Centre for all it has achieved, and in wishing it every success going forward, I would like to pay special tribute to a great Australian.</p>
<p>Professor Chris O'Brien.</p>
<p>Chris has been a tireless campaigner in the interests of not only better cancer treatment and research, but also in  promoting awareness of cancer and its impacts on people and families.</p>
<p>The fight against cancer is a long-term one that may test us for decades to come. </p>
<p>It is a fight that will test our determination and resolve, but one that we must front up to if we are to close the gap between our aspirations and our achievements as a nation.</p>
<p>Chris, you should know that you have made a difference in this fight, that your efforts have borne fruit, and that the fight will go on.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
