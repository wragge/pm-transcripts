FOR PRESS 13 APRIL 1978<br />
NOLAN GALLIPOLI EXHIBITION<br />
There are few tasks I enjoy more as Prime Minister than<br />
accepting on behalf of the Australian people valuable works<br />
of art which will be cherished and loved by generations<br />
to come, especially when our acquisition does not enlarge the<br />
deficit by a single cent.<br />
Sidney Nolan is of course one of the greatest artists this<br />
country has produced and in donating this famous series of<br />
paintings and drawings to the trustees of the Australian War<br />
Memorial, he has demonstrated wonderful gene rosity to<br />
his country.<br />
Mr. Nolan's works have often sparked controversy in the past,<br />
and there will be those who will still prefer the more literal.<br />
depictions of battle which are to be found in many of the<br />
other paintings in the War Memorial's collection of over<br />
12,000 works of art. But of course it is the very originality<br />
and creativity of Sidney Nolan's works that make them such a<br />
valuable addition to the collection.<br />
Mr. Nolan had originally, I understand, intended to create a<br />
series of works on the ancient struggle which took place at<br />
Troy, almost within sight of Gallipoli, but the impact of the<br />
ANZAC legend proved to be stronger and the result of years of<br />
labours has been this magnificent Gallipoli Series.<br />
There is a haunting emotional impact of this series which in<br />
some way enlarges our understanding of what happened in that<br />
terrible theatre of war just over 60 years ago.<br />
These paintings and drawings differ greatly from the documentary<br />
records of Australia's official artists of the 1914-1918 War,<br />
yet both are complementary, for Sidney Nolan's Gallipoli Series<br />
captures the emotional response of a whole generation of<br />
Australians to the sacrifices made by the ANZACS.<br />
The 252 works which make up this exhibition cover two decades<br />
of the artist's activity and document his changing responses to<br />
a national legend which he first started to paint while serving<br />
in the army in 1942. Sidney Nolan has been adding to the series<br />
ever since most recently in February this year and this<br />
exhibition is the first public viewing of the entire series. ./ 2 </p>
<p>Last year, the Chairman of the Memorial's Trustees,<br />
Sir Thomas Daly, approached the artist to find out more<br />
about his plans for the Gallipoli series. Sidney Nolan's<br />
prompt and generous response was to announce that he<br />
would donate the entire series to the nation through the<br />
War Memorial in memory of his brother, Raymond, who<br />
drowned accidentally at Cooktown in 1945 while returning<br />
from service in the Pacific.<br />
Both my Government and the Memorial Trustees are deeply<br />
grateful to Sidney Nolan for making such an extensive and<br />
important series available. We have been given an excellent<br />
opportunity to enrich the nation's collections and by doing<br />
so enriching the lives of Australians and our many overseas<br />
visitors who visit the War Memorial.<br />
It gives me great pleasure in declaring the Memorial<br />
Exhibition of Sidny Nolan's Gallipoli Series open. </p>
