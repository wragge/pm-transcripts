STATE VISIT BY PRESIDENT PARK( OF KOREA<br />
LUNCHEON AT PARLIAMENT HOUSE, 2SP98 N<br />
17 SEPTEMBER 1968<br />
Speech by the Prime Minister, Mvr John Carton_<br />
Mr President, Your Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen:<br />
This function in our National Parliament gives the opportunity<br />
to do you and your country honour. You represent a country with a history<br />
which goes back much further than ours, and : you represent a country which,<br />
in the course of that history, has had to face much harsher tests than ours.<br />
You have known forcfign rule which we have not. You have<br />
suffered direct armed aggression on your own people and your own land<br />
which in any comparable way we have not, arid you are still subject to the<br />
threat of aggression and indeed to the infiltration of armed commandos with<br />
missions to kill those significant in your country including, Sir, yourself,<br />
In recent history, you gained self-government in 1945,<br />
after some thirty-six years of foreign domination which you could not, by<br />
force of arms, resist or overthrow, but which you never at any time accepted<br />
in your hearts and minds, which you consistently rejected and which ultimately<br />
you managed to see removed.<br />
Then, within but a short time of that, you faced an incursion<br />
across your Northern border of well-armed, well-organised, well-prepared<br />
military formations seeking to subject your government or the Government of<br />
South Korea and the South Korean people by force. It took years for that<br />
attack to be repulsed and for those who made it to be sent back from whence<br />
they came. We remember the great sacrifices and devotion which the South<br />
Korean people made themselves to throw back this assault and which the<br />
United Nations, to its credit, helped and which we, as a nation, contributed<br />
towards, as I believe, to our honour and to the honour of the United NatJons.<br />
You are, Sir, as I have said, still challenged, and I believe<br />
that that challenge is real. We have seen in recent weeks what can happen in<br />
a country when the forces of suppression can walk in and can deny the<br />
expression of the free will of the people of that country. What we saw happen<br />
in Czechoslovakia could have happened and could happen in South Korea.<br />
You have got to face this threat and are facing it a nation of 30 million<br />
people with 600, 000 troops under arms because of this ever-present pressing<br />
threat. You are providing those twin deterrents against aggression<br />
and against subversion the willingness and ability to resist by military<br />
force the breaching of a frontiiqr or a demarcation line, and the determination<br />
to improve the economic living standards of the peoples of your country so that<br />
by these both methods you will together prevent the dangers which threaten<br />
you. 2 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
We have admiration for both of these efforts on your part,<br />
great admiration in particular for the determination you are showing to<br />
increase your economic capacity and the living standards of your people.<br />
Your first Five-Year Plan, I am told, was a great success. Your G NP<br />
rose by an average of something like 10 per cent a year, and as a result, the<br />
employment capacity and the wage capacity for the people of Korea rose with<br />
it. Your second Plan is now off to what appears to be a<br />
magnificent start. You are working towards complete self-sufficiency by<br />
1980, and that, bearing in mind the war-torn recent history of your nation<br />
and the way it had to be lifted up industrially by its bootstraps is, as has<br />
been said in one of our journals, something that approaches an economic<br />
miracle. And so you are engaged in these two great tasks, but you<br />
have not only a determination to resist aggression, not only a realisation<br />
that wherever a demarcation line or a border is violated that is a danger to<br />
all small countries, not only an insistence on providing self-help in your<br />
economic growth, but also beyond that an eye for the future in that it was on<br />
your country's initiative that ASPAC came into being, That is an organisation<br />
of which we in Australia are proud to be a foundation member and which is<br />
designed towards regional co-operation in economic fields and in other fields<br />
for the good of all and which will be far more effective and far more able to<br />
advance the good of all if that day ever comes when those threats posed to<br />
the region by communist aggression are removed.<br />
For all these things, for all these efforts on your part, we<br />
in Australia and the Australian Parliament are proud to do you honour.<br />
Sir, you are a very welcome guest. </p>
