    <content><![CDATA[<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong></p>
<p>Thank you very much.</p>
<p>I too, acknowledge that we are on the land of the Ngunnawal People and we acknowledge their elders past and present and as we have just heard, acknowledge all the Aboriginal men and women who have served Australia and your uniforms here, the uniforms of the Australian Defence Force serving now and serving in years past and making the supreme sacrifice to keep us free.</p>
<p>We are here on International Women's Day and women are kicking goals in every field. Clare Lawton perhaps more literally than others but congratulations to you all.</p>
<p>It is wonderful to be here with Senator Marise Payne, the Minister for Defence and Australia's first woman to be Defence Minister, Senator Michaelia Cash, the Minister for Women, Defence Force Chiefs, members of the Australian Defence Force and the Australian Defence Force academy, all.</p>
<p>We are celebrating the achievements of women at the Australian Defence Force and here at the academy.</p>
<p>We thank you, the women of the ADF serving here and overseas.</p>
<p>Each of you are magnificent role models for young women and girls right across Australia.</p>
<p>I'm delighted that Major General Simone Wilke is here with us today - a great example of the change that has occurred over time in the ADF.</p>
<p>When Major General Wilkie started out 30 years ago, one of the regular jobs for young soldiers was guard duty at Victoria Barracks in my electorate in Sydney.</p>
<p>This was a job that Major General Wilke couldn't do because she was a female soldier.</p>
<p>Three decades later, she is the first female commander on operations in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>She embodies her belief that women should be able to do and can do anything and everything in the ADF - in every role.</p>
<p>As a role model for young women coming up through the ranks, she is a great example of the motto: if you can't see it, you can't be it.</p>
<p>Role models are leading by example.</p>
<p>The opportunities that have opened up for women in the ADF since Major General Wilkie first wore the uniform of Australia are extraordinary.</p>
<p>Women in Defence are making a huge contribution across the range of military planning, policy, operations in support of our national interest.</p>
<p>This year, women make up more than 20 per cent of all recruits to the ADF.</p>
<p>I was just discussing with some of the naval officers here, 29 per cent of the recruits into the Navy.</p>
<p>And they represent more than 25 per cent of those who have joined the Australian Defence Force Academy.</p>
<p>There are now 266 women serving on current overseas ADF operations, representing more than 13 per cent of the total deployed force.</p>
<p>Australian service women now comprise 16 per cent of the permanent full-time ADF.</p>
<p>There are currently 82 women in senior officer positions compared to 48 in February 2012.</p>
<p>This progress could not have been achieved without a real push from Defence to attract and recruit women, to recruit the best men and women for the ADF but also to focus on ensuring that more young women and girls come into the ADF and follow the example of so many of you here, demonstrating that women can do, will do, are doing everything in the nation's service in the ADF.</p>
<p>The Government is committed to driving female participation in the armed forces. I am proud to say that, as of the 1st of January 2016, all combat roles are now open to female recruits. </p>
<p>But the ADF has not just improved its recruitment and retention of women in the armed forces.</p>
<p>On International Women's Day we should also reflect on the fact that women and children are disproportionately affected by war, conflict, instability and natural disasters.</p>
<p>And the ADF, all of you, are at the forefront of Australia's efforts to reduce this terrible toll.</p>
<p>The ADF is helping implement the United Nations Security Council Resolutions on women, peace and security through the whole-of-government National Action Plan.</p>
<p>The plan sets out the framework by which Australia is encouraging women’s participation in conflict prevention, management and resolution. It ensures our peacekeeping and humanitarian operations take gender into account in their response.</p>
<p>For example, during Australia’s response to the devastation of Tropical Cyclone Winston in Fiji, specially trained ADF and Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade personnel delivered more effective, targeted help because they were able to connect with local women and target their needs.</p>
<p>This important work shows that the ADF is not just dedicated to being a better employer of women, it is working to create a better world for all women.</p>
<p>Gender equality is not just an issue for women. It is the responsibility of all Australians, not least because all Australians benefit.</p>
<p>When you empower a woman, you empower a family, you empower a nation - the whole economy and the whole community benefits.</p>
<p>So to all of you here today, and the millions of young women across Australia - I encourage you to be bold for change. Be bold for change.</p>
<p>The limits of your ambition should only be the limits of your imagination.</p>
<p>Have big dreams, big, bold dreams and go for it.</p>
<p>You can do anything as you continue to serve Australia, to serve our nation in our nation’s uniform.</p>
<p>You are doing us all proud and you are wonderful role models.</p>
<p>There are so many young girls that will look at you and say: ‘I can do that’. And that is important.</p>
<p>If you can’t see it you can’t be it. You’re being it, you’re being seen and others will follow in your footsteps.</p>
<p>Congratulations, thank you and Happy International Women’s Day.</p>
<p>[<strong>ENDS]</strong></p>
