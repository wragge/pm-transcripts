    <content><![CDATA[<p>FOR PL1ESS P. M. No. 124/ 1966</p>
<p>ADDITIONAL AUSTRAiLIAN VOCSFOR VIETNAM</p>
<p>On Tuesday I promised to release further details of theÂ proposed increase in Australia's forces assisting the alliedÂ effort in Vietnam. Followiing the discussions then in train withÂ our allies, to which I then referred, I am now in a position to<br />announce detailed arrangements for the deployment of the<br />additional Australian units which will shortly move to Vietnam.<br />As I indicated in statements before the elections, it is<br />the policy of the Government to review from time to time the<br />Australian contribution to the security of Vietnam. I have also<br />said on behalf of the Government on several occasions that<br />Australia is determined to make wuith others a fitting and<br />responsible contribution, in the light of our capacity and other<br />commitments, to the winning of peace and stability in Vietnam.<br />Assistance in the economic and social fields is an<br />essential part of our contribution to the peace and stability of<br />South East Asia. The Departments concerned are at present<br />preparinE material wYh, i ch will enable the Government to review at<br />an early date its existing prograrm~ ie of economic aid and w-. elfare<br />for South Vietnam. The purpose of our review will be to see<br />can usefully be done for the development of Australia's<br />efforts in these fields.<br />The Government's policy takes into account the agreements<br />reached by all the participating countries at the 1knila Heads of<br />Governmient Conference, held at the end of October last, in . which<br />the Ifinisters for External Affairs and Defence also took part.<br />At Manila, the seven nations ( Australia, Korea, New Zealand,<br />Philippines, Thailand, United States and Vietnwn) firmly<br />declared -I<br />that the freedom of South Vietnam should be secured<br />that their military and all other efforts would be<br />continued as firmly and as long as miay be necessary<br />that such imilitary action and support must depend for<br />its size and duration on the intensity and duration<br />of the coiunist aggression itself.<br />The Government had before it assessments of the military<br />situation in South Vietnam and. of the intentions of North Vietnam.<br />, Jhile the military picture is encouraging, it is clear that a<br />balanced and sustained effort is vital if further success is to<br />be won. As yet, we have seen no indication that North Vietnam<br />is slackening in its attempt to bring about a conmnunist victory<br />in South Vietnam by force. The cormmitment of regular North<br />Vietnam combat units continues at a substantial rate, infiltration<br />being estimated at between 5,500 and 6,000 a month.<br />The numerous soundings and exploratory moves on the<br />possibilities of peace have as yet produced nothing fruitful.<br />The search for peace will continue. In the moantime, our<br />military efforts are directed towrards reaching a position where<br />the othor side will become convinced that aggression will not<br />succeed, and that South Vietnam and its allies have the resources<br />and the w--ill to prevent it from succeeding.</p>
<p>The Government's view is that Australia's military effort<br />in Vietnam should be a substantial and measured response,<br />deriving from our capacity to contribute and with regard to our<br />obligations as a whole.</p>
<p>Our existing conmitment is an important one which has been<br />and is bein discharged to the greatest credit of the commanders<br />and men of the Australia Force Vietnam. Their efforts have<br />already clearly demonstrated that the Australian contribution is<br />meaningful and effective. W. 4e intend that the commitment shall<br />continue to be honoured fully, and that we play our part as a<br />reliable ally.</p>
<p>After considering papers brought for Cabinet consideration<br />by the { Iinister for Defence in which he reviewoed the position, the<br />followiing detailed arrangements for additional forces for Vietnam<br />were decided upon.<br />Early in the New Year, additional ground and air forces and<br />two units of the RAiN will be deployed to South Vietnam. The<br />total effect of these neT. deployments will be to increase the<br />number of our personnel by more than one third from the present<br />level of 4,600 to approximately 6,300. With these additions the<br />Australian Force aill be significantly strengthened and balanced.<br />These additional comnitments will require no increase in the<br />present level of the National Service intake. All three Australian<br />rmed Services are ready for combat operations under the particular<br />circumstances of the present conflict. With the South Vietnamese<br />themselves and with the United States, Australia will then be<br />making a contribution in the air and at sea, as well as on the<br />ground. The existing Army strength of over 4,300 men is to be<br />increased to about 5,200. Both combat and logistic support units<br />will receive increases in personnel and this will provide all<br />units with greater capacity to meet their tasks. This expanded<br />Army contribution to Vietnam of some 900 officers and other ranks<br />will improve the operational effectiveness of the Australian Task<br />Force. There will be no change in the operational relationships<br />between our ovn and other allied ground forces.<br />The additional men being provided vwill also enable a greater<br />contribution to be made, through military civic acbion, to the<br />welfare of the civilian population in our area of responsibility<br />in Phuoc Tuy Province.</p>
<p>The Government has also decided to make available forÂ <br />service in the area, TIiS HOBART, a well-equipped modern destroyer<br />which joined our fleet a few months ago. HOBART wiill operate as<br />an integral part of the American Naval Forces, with similar roles<br />and tabk. For a considerable period American and South Vietnamese<br />forces have conducted sea and air patrols with a viewi to the<br />interdiction of coastal traffic and in order to counter the supply<br />by coastal shipping of comiunist forces in South Vietnam. For<br />maximuin effectiveness, these operations must be continuous and<br />require many ships and consuant vigilance. HOBART will also be<br />available to operate as required in general support of naval forces<br />at sea. A small under-water Naval Clearance Diving Team of " frogmen"<br />vwill also be attached to American mine and obstacle clearance<br />teams.</p>
<p>3.<br />In addition to its existing contribution of two squadrons<br />of Caribou and Iroquois aircraft, the PiAAF is to deploy to South<br />Vietnam a squadron of 8 Canberra bomber aircraft. These aircraft<br />will be positioned to operate in support of our own ground forces.<br />They rmay be employed as part of the allied combat air contribution<br />in support of other allied ground forces, and against enemy<br />movements and concentrations.<br />It is expected that the additional forces will move to<br />Vietnam during the early months of the New Year.<br />22nd December, 1966:</p>
