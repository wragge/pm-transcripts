FOR PRESS: PM. No. 123/ 1967<br />
DISCUSSIONS WITH REPRESENTATIVE S OF<br />
THE ASSOCIATE" D CHA MER S OF MANUFACTURES<br />
Stat ement by the Prime Minister, Mr Harold Holt<br />
At the request of the Associated 1Chambers of Manufactures,<br />
I had a discussion this morning with the Federal President, Mr F. C.<br />
Curtis, and the six State Presidents of the Chambersi The meeting had<br />
been sought to inforain me of views held by the members of AGMA on<br />
problems which could arise for manuf atiring Industry consequential<br />
upon the British devaluation of sterling and the Australian Gvrmnts<br />
decision to maintain the existing value of the Australian dollar.<br />
It was put to me that difficulties could arise in various<br />
directions. There could be an increased penetration of the Australian<br />
market by British exports taking advantage of the favourable position<br />
created for them by the sterling devaluation. The British competitive<br />
edge was likely to be felt not only on the Australian market, but In those<br />
export markets particularly New Zealand where Australian manufactures<br />
had been making some headway. Problems could arise for individual<br />
manufactures from cancellation of orders as well as from a reduced share<br />
of the Australian and export markets.<br />
I assured the manufacturers' delegation that the Government<br />
was fully conscious of the importance to the Australian economy and our<br />
national well-being, of healthy and expanding manufacturing Industries.<br />
This had been stressed by me in a number of statements I had made in<br />
the course of this year. We would therefore wish to be helpful In meeting<br />
these problems. I said It was probable that the problems for different<br />
Australian industries would emerge at different times and to different<br />
degrees. This seemed to me to call for a selective approach rather than<br />
for one across the board which ACMA had proposed. I pointed to the<br />
machinery already in existence for the protection of Australian manufactures,<br />
Including the Tariff Board and the special advisory authority system. A<br />
special advisory authority had been set up to ensure that in those cases where<br />
the threat, or actuality, of serious damage could be demonstrated, remedial<br />
action could be taken speedily with safeguards of subsequent Tariff Board<br />
enquiry. I recommended the revival of the industry panel system which<br />
had previously proved helpful working in co-operation with the Department<br />
of Trade and Industry. This would permit a thorough examination of the<br />
facts and, where justified, assist in the preparation of a case to the<br />
Government seeking emergency action by the special advisory authority.<br />
I told the representatives of ACMA that study had already<br />
commenced on the effects of the British decision, and undertook to bring<br />
their views to the meeting of Cabinet scheduled for next week.<br />
I have also agreed that, within the fortnight following that meeting, a a e e / 2 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
I would arrange for ACMA representatives to meet with the Economic<br />
Committee of Cabinet. This interval of time would enable the Government<br />
and the Chambers to form a clearer picture of the likely consequences and<br />
the experience of their members in the period immediately following the<br />
British devaluation.<br />
