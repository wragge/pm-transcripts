GRANTS FOR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT<br />
( Statement by Mr. J. McEwen, Acting Prime Minister and<br />
Minictc: for Trade and Industry)<br />
1. The Acting Prime Ilin-Lster and Minister for Trade<br />
and Industry, Mr. McEwen, today announced some further details<br />
of the scheme for Government grants for research and development<br />
mentioned in the Treasurer's Budget Speech of 16th August last.<br />
2. Mr. McEwen said that complete details would be<br />
contained in the legislation which would be introduced shortly.<br />
However, he thought it woul i ceu in . thm eantime to inform<br />
the business community of the broad outlines of the scheme so<br />
that they could organise their affai. rs to derive full benefit<br />
from the incentive.<br />
3. The scheme will operate with effect as from 1st July,<br />
1967 until 30th June, 1972. Before the latter date is reached<br />
the Government will review its ooeration,<br />
4. Mr. McEwen explained that grants would be made only<br />
to manufacturing and mining companies incorporated in Australia<br />
Grants, which will be taxable in the hands of<br />
recipients, will be payable in respect of additional expenditure<br />
on research and development work undertaken by a company during<br />
the currency of the scheme. For these purposes " research and<br />
development" will be defined along the following lines<br />
Systematic experi.'. je: italion or analysis<br />
in the fields of science, engineering<br />
or technology to acquire new knowledge<br />
or to develop new or improved material<br />
products or processes associated with<br />
the production or use of such products. </p>
<p>2.<br />
6. The following activities would not be regarded as<br />
falling within the scope of the above definition<br />
* Market research<br />
* Sales promotion<br />
* Feasibility studies<br />
* Technical service to customers<br />
0 Management studies<br />
0 Labour efficiency surveys, investigation<br />
into incentive wage systems etc.<br />
* Methods engineering<br />
* Operational research<br />
* Routine q~ uality control and routine<br />
materials testing<br />
* Mineral exploration and prospecting.<br />
7, j Mr. McEwen added that the full definition of research<br />
and development which will be contained in the legislation will<br />
exclude the following categories of design work from eligibility<br />
for grants, Design work which arisea from the need<br />
to meet the individual requirements of a<br />
particular user of the product or process;<br />
Design work which is primarily directed towards<br />
styling as distinct from an improvement in the<br />
functional characteristica ( including the<br />
reduction of costs) of the product or process.<br />
Mr. Mc~ wen continued<br />
8. The scheme will apply only to companies which<br />
increase their research and development in Australia as compared<br />
with a base period, For this pu~ cpose, the base year will be the<br />
financial year 1965/ 66. </p>
<p>V 3.<br />
9. Firms must apply for grants and in the first instance,<br />
will be required to establish the extent of their eligible<br />
research and development activities in the base year. Where a<br />
firm was not engaged on research and development in the base year,<br />
its base will be nil.<br />
Grants will be administered in two ways. A firm which<br />
satisfies the administering authority that it has increased its<br />
research and development work as defined, will automatically<br />
qualify for a percentage grant in respect of eligible additional<br />
expenditure up to $ 50,000 a year.<br />
11. A firm which wishes to receive a -Trant in respect<br />
of eligible additional expenditure beyond $ 50,000 a year will<br />
need to obtain individual ( but not necessarily prior) approval<br />
on a selective basis in respect of the excess. Applications<br />
will be assessed in the light of the extent to which the research<br />
and development appears likely to contribute to the following<br />
objectives The development and use of Australian<br />
physical resources;<br />
The expansion of exports;<br />
Import saving and the ability to compete<br />
with im-port s;<br />
Productivity and cost reduction;<br />
Defence capability.<br />
12. The g-, rants will not be paid in respect of all<br />
components of research and development costs. They will be<br />
limited to expenditure on wages and salaries, plant and equipment,<br />
and contracted research and development. Two of these components,<br />
expenditure on wages and salaries and expenditure on contracted<br />
research and development, will be treated together in estimating<br />
their eligibility for grant purposes. The other component,<br />
expenditure on plant and equipment, will be treated separately. </p>
<p>V 4.<br />
13. Wag-es and sala-ries will qualify only in respect<br />
of Drofessional and technical staff engaged in Australia wholly<br />
on research and development. " Professional" staff will be those<br />
who have completed a university degree or technical college<br />
diploma in a branch of science or engineering which admits to<br />
membership of a professional institute. " Technical" staff will<br />
be those % 7ho are directly assisting, in a technical capacity, the<br />
professional staff enga,-ged on research and development. The<br />
wages and salaries of certain other staff categories, such as<br />
secretarial staff, librarians, cleaners, etc., even although they<br />
may be employed wholly in a research and development establishment,<br />
will not qualify for the grant.<br />
14. Grants will be payable in respect of the increase<br />
in eligible via. ges and salaries over the base year 1965/ 66.<br />
In calculating the wages and salaries component in the<br />
base year, firms will be required to include the appropriate<br />
proportion of the salaries of staff during periods when they<br />
were engaged part-time on research and development.<br />
16. In a " g rant year", however, only the salaries of<br />
staff wholly engaged on research and development will qualify.<br />
17. Where ap) propriate, the administering authority will<br />
make an adjustment to the actual amount of increase in a firm's<br />
eligible expenditure on research and development salaries so as<br />
to offset the effect of inflation of salary levels. The adjustment<br />
will be made by recalculating the base year expenditure figure<br />
so as to reflect what that figure would have been if the salary<br />
levels ruling in the grant year had also a,;: plied in the base year.<br />
The adjustment will not a-.-ply in -the case of a firm starting<br />
research and development afresh. In the case of firms already<br />
engaged in research and development, the adjustment will be made<br />
only in respect of staff who were employed on research and<br />
development in the base period in respect of research and<br />
development positions which existed in the base period. </p>
<p>18. For contracted research, firms will be eligible for<br />
grants in respect of increases ( above the 1965/ 66 base) in<br />
payments made to " outside" organisations which have been approved<br />
by the administering authority.<br />
19. Plant and equipment to be eligible must be used solely<br />
for research and development. The aggregate amount of this<br />
component of a firm's grant from the inception of the scheme may<br />
not exceed the net aggregate of the eligible wages and salaries<br />
and the contracted research and development components. This<br />
means that expenditure on plant and equipment will qualify for<br />
grant purposes only when and to the extent that there has been a<br />
qualifying expenditure in the sector comprised of salaries and<br />
wages and contracted research and development. There is a<br />
further condition that no grant will be paid in respect of<br />
expenditure on plant and equipment in any grant year if the sum<br />
of the expenditure on wages and salaries and contracted research<br />
and development is less in that grant year than in the base year.<br />
Subject to these provisos, the method to be adopted in calculating<br />
grants in respect of plant expenditure is as follows<br />
purchases of new research and development plant<br />
and equipment will be eligible for grant purposes<br />
even if the firm's expenditure on this component<br />
is lower than in the base year. That is to say,<br />
expenditure on research and development plant and<br />
equipment is not tied to base year expenditure.<br />
the plant and equipment eligible for research and<br />
development grant purposes is to be regarded as<br />
identical with that research and development<br />
plant and equipment which is allowed by the<br />
Taxataion Commissioner as eligible for<br />
depreciation over three years as provided in </p>
<p>1 6.<br />
Section 73A of the ILncome Tax Assessment Act. It<br />
is to be noted that although Section 73A<br />
refers to " scientific research" this term<br />
embraces many phases of product research<br />
and development.<br />
The rate of grant applying in the automatic cases<br />
will, at least initially, be 50% of the increase in eligible<br />
expenditure. This rate will be the same for all companies.<br />
The rate for selective grants will be determined in each case<br />
by the administering authority but will not exceed 50%. The<br />
rate may vary from one firm to another in the same year.<br />
21. Firms will, of course, be required to substantiate<br />
their claims for grants. It would therefore be advisable for<br />
firms currently engaged in research and development to establish<br />
by 1st July a system under which eligible research and<br />
development expenditure is separately recorded and properly<br />
documented with explanations. It will also be necessary for<br />
firms to keep records of the work upon which professional and<br />
technical staff are engaged so that those wholly engaged after<br />
1st July on research and development can be separated from<br />
those doing work which does not constitute research and<br />
development as defined.<br />
22. MVr. McEwen said that the Government intended to<br />
introduce the legislation during the current session of<br />
Parliament. No grants would be payable until after the<br />
legislation is enacted and the administering authority<br />
established.<br />
23. Mr. MvcEwen added that the scheme would be administered<br />
by an authority responsible to the Minister for Trade and<br />
Industry. 22/ 67T.<br />
