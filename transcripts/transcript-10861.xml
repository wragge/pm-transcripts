    <content><![CDATA[<p>I was delighted to declare Main Road 92 from Nowra to Nerriga a Road</p>
<p> of National Importance this afternoon. A declaration of Road of National</p>
<p> Importance provides for the Commonwealth to fund this important regional</p>
<p> transport link.</p>
<p>This provides the basis for a significant upgrading of the existing</p>
<p> road and over 300 new jobs for the region.</p>
<p>This upgraded transport link will provide a significant stimulus to</p>
<p> the region. It will cut travel time and transport costs, with associated</p>
<p> benefits for business in the area. It will provide better links for</p>
<p> the tourism industry while also making the roads safer.</p>
<p>These new road works will generate at least 300 new jobs in the region,</p>
<p> not only from the road works and associated industries, but also from</p>
<p> the expansion of other sectors benefiting from the improved transport</p>
<p> links.</p>
<p>Efficient infrastructure is vital to ensuring regional Australia has</p>
<p> the opportunity to grow to its full potential and so the Coalition</p>
<p> Government remains committed to the upgrade of infrastructure in regional</p>
<p> Australia.</p>
<p>We have facilitated the building of the Alice Springs to Darwin Railway,</p>
<p> introduced the Roads of National Importance Programme and reinvigorated</p>
<p> the Black Spots Programme to name but a few initiatives.</p>
<p>Pledging support for upgrading Main Road 92 is part of this commitment</p>
<p> to rebuilding regional Australia. I am proud to have my Government</p>
<p> as such a strong supporter of this important project.</p>
