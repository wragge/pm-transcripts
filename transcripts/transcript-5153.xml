PRIM3E VIN STER<br />
FOR PRESS .27 September 1979<br />
THE RESIGNATION OF THE RT. HON. IAN SINCLAIR, M. P.<br />
I have received a letter from the Rt. Hon. Ian Sinclair, M. P.<br />
resigning his portfolio as Minister for Primary Industry, and<br />
resigning also his position as Leader of the House of<br />
Representatives. I shall recommend to His Excellency that<br />
Mr. Sinclair's resignation from his ministerial portfolio be<br />
accepted. It is a matter of great regret to me and to the Government that<br />
Mr. Sinclair has felt obliged to take this step while any action<br />
that may flow from the report commissioned by the N. S. W.<br />
Government is unrsolved. He does so, I know, out of consideration<br />
for his ministerial and Party colleagues.<br />
Mr. Sinclair'has ser-ed the Government and his country with<br />
distinction and dedication and his contribution will be greatly<br />
missed. I shall ask His Excellency to swear the Honourable Peter Nixon<br />
as Minister for Pri=--ry Industry in addition to his present<br />
portfolio as Minister for Transport.<br />
I have appointed Mr. Viner as Leader of the House of Representatives.<br />
Until Mr. Peacock returns from overseas, Mr. Mackellar will be<br />
Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs.<br />

Parlicamenz House<br />

My dear Prime Minister,<br />
The Finnane Report tabled in the New South Wales<br />
Legislative Assembly yesterday makes a number of<br />
assertions about my actions in connection with private<br />
companies with which my family is associated.<br />
The blatant political character of the investigation<br />
instigated by the New South Wales Attorney-General<br />
and heightened by the appointment of a prominent member<br />
of the Australian Labor Party as Special Investigator,<br />
seriously call into question the Validity and integrity<br />
of many of these assertions.<br />
Seldom has a person in my position been subjected to<br />
such a well publicised and orchestrated campaign of<br />
personal scrutiny, supposedly in the public interest.<br />
Throughout the course of the investigation, I have<br />
been subjected publicly to continuing attacks on my<br />
personal integrity and propriety. As every fair minded<br />
person will appreciate, until now I have been completely<br />
unable to respond effectively. Now and as before, I<br />
vehemently deny any improper activity relating to these<br />
matters. Nonetheless, I am conscious of the difficulties in which<br />
the Report places the Government. Accordingly, I now<br />
tender my resignation as Leader of the House and Minister<br />
for Primary Industry, confident that this course will best<br />
. enable me to counter the false assertions made against<br />
me. / 2<br />

With very sincere regret I shall recommend to<br />
His Excellency the Governor-General that he accept<br />
your resignation as Minister for Primary Industry.<br />
You have acted in this manner, I know, from the highest<br />
motives of consideration for the Government. Your<br />
ministerial colleagues appreciate this, and appreciate<br />
also how painful this decision must be for you.<br />
I accept your resignation also as Leader of the House<br />
of Representatives.<br />
You have served the Government and the country withgreat<br />
distincti: on and dedication, and I should like<br />
to record the Government's and my own appreciation of<br />
your loyalty and your service. Yours sincerely,<br />
