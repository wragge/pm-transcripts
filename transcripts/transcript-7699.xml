TRANSCRIPT OF DOORSTOP, HYATT HOTEL, 8 AUGUST 1989<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime minister, are you pleased to hear that<br />
Michael Lynagh has rejected an invitation to play rugby in<br />
South Africa?<br />
PM: ( inaudible) that they all make the decision that I<br />
believe is the right one and that includes Michael.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, it seems that the rugby tour<br />
might fall in a heap. would you be happy if something like<br />
that happened?<br />
PM: Well, it's not happiness in the sense of the rugby tour<br />
falling in a heap. My happiness is, if that happens, that<br />
further pressure has been put upon the regime in South<br />
Africa to bring it to the bargaining table. As I've said,<br />
there's no form of sanction which I get any pleasure out of<br />
as such. I don't want to see people hurt over there by<br />
sporting opportunities or trade sanctions being imposed just<br />
for the sake of doing that, but also it is as an instrument<br />
to make the regime of South Africa understand that it is not<br />
acceptable in the international community. Anything that's<br />
done to bring that realisation home to them is something<br />
that is worthwhile. What we hope is that they will come to<br />
the understanding that they're not acceptable in the<br />
international community while they adhere to this abhorrent<br />
regime of apartheid, I say come to the table and that we do<br />
get emerging in South Africa a country in which people are<br />
accepted irrespective of the basis of the colour of their<br />
skin. When you have a multi-racial society like that there<br />
would be no-one who'd be doing more than I would be doing<br />
and this Government would be doing to try and see that all<br />
the people of South Africa have the opportunity of being<br />
fully integrated into the world community. To the extent<br />
that decisions are being made now by sportsmen which are<br />
part of that thrust, I welcome it.<br />
