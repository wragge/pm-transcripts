NATIONAL TELECAST BY THE PRIME MINISTER,<br />
MR HAROLD HOLT<br />
Thursday, 16 November, 1967<br />
( Following is the text of a televised election talk by the Prime Minister,<br />
Mr Harold Holt. The five-minute programme will be seen In all States<br />
this evening. The ABC will telecast the talk at the following times<br />
New South Walesi Victoria and Tasmania 9. 30 pm; Queensland and TIestern<br />
Australia 9.20 pm,, South Australia 1C pm',<br />
I remind you again that the purpose of this S3enate election<br />
is not to choose an Australian Government. You did that in 1966 for what<br />
would normally be a three-year term. You are now to elect thirty, out of the<br />
full total of sixty, Senators, and those elected will take their places in July<br />
of next year. As you know, the Government you elected last November with<br />
a large majority in the House of Pepresentatives, is actually in a minority<br />
in the Senate. What I now say to you is that the Government you have already<br />
chosen should be given an effective majority in both the House of Representatives<br />
and the Senate. Wj~ ithout this there can only be uncertainty, confusion,<br />
frustration and delays in the work of the national Parliament.<br />
The twelve months since the general ections have not altered<br />
either the basic questions you voted on or your assessment of them. You<br />
said decisively then that the A merican alliance was vital to our security,<br />
that our Viet Nam commitment shared with our A merican and other<br />
allies was based on a correct understanding of the communist threat to<br />
South-East Asia. You said that our economic prosperity and nobody denies<br />
that under my Government we do have a. remarkable economic prosperity<br />
could not be separated from our international security.<br />
We were then and we remain in direct conflict with the Labor<br />
Party on these matters. You completely rejected then, as you must again,<br />
a Labor policy which would undermine our alliances and endanger our<br />
national interests. You will remember that Mr Calwell did not mince his words<br />
at the time. He wanted a retreat to Australian shores. He did not want<br />
any part of Viet Nam. He did not care If we walked out on our allies. But<br />
Mr Calwell's successor is as vague and evasive on this issue as his former<br />
leader was clear and forthright. This deliberate vagueness should deceive<br />
nobody who has read the latest policy decisions of the ALP on Viet Nam.<br />
The makers tf Labor policy, the delegates to the Adelaide<br />
Conference, decided In effect that a Labor Government would demand a<br />
virtual abandonment by America of Its objectives in Viet Nam as the price<br />
of Australan military support. Mr Galwell said of the Adelaide decisions:<br />
" here has been no weakening of Labor opposition to the continuation of the<br />
war and to Australia's part in It. Other prominent Labor men have confirmed<br />
this. / 2 </p>
<p>-2<br />
Fortunately for Australia, the Labor Party is not in a position<br />
to deliver an ultimatum to our American allies. It is not in government.<br />
But you cannot afford, in the course of this Senate election<br />
campaign, to be distracted from the realities of politics and the realities<br />
of our position on these matters, by attempts to turn your minds to other<br />
things. The Labor Party will trade punches on a variety of other issues.<br />
It is surely most revealing that it avoids fight on the basic questions of the<br />
security and prosperity of this country. This kind of shadow sparring may<br />
serve as entertainment intended as a diversion from more critical matters,<br />
but it is no substitute for national leadership in difficult times.<br />
On the matters which profoundly affect the future of our country,<br />
the Labor Party is consistent only in its refusal to come to grips with the<br />
reality of our situation in the Pacific. Labor's isolationism was once<br />
merely a socialistic attitude, a theatrical posture. Nowit is a policy full<br />
of danger for Australia, formulated and promoted by the many left-wing<br />
elements of the ALP who dominate its foreign pclicy decisions. You will<br />
find these attitudes strongly advanced by Labor's left-wing leaders in the<br />
Senate. It would be hazardous folly to give them the numbers in that Chamber<br />
to defeat the Government on matters crucial to the security of this country.<br />
CANBERRA, 16 November, 1967. </p>
