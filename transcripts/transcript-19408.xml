    <content><![CDATA[<p>Adelaide</p>
<p>South Australia's health and biomedical precinct has today received a $100 million boost for two key projects.The Prime Minister today announced in Adelaide that the Government would provide funding for two world class education and health science and research facilities:</p>
<p> * 	$40 million in funding for a new University of South Australia Centre for Cancer Biology. This Centre will house 250 researchers investigating blood cancers such as leukaemia and lymphoma.<br />
 * 	$60 million in funding for the University of Adelaide's Integrated Clinical School to deliver teaching, learning and research facilities for medical and nursing students.</p>
<p>By supporting the establishment of these two new facilities in the city's north-west corner, the Gillard Government is supporting biomedical research and innovation and helping to create SA jobs.The $100m Centre for Cancer Biology will have a specific focus on the research of blood-related cancers such as leukaemia and lymphoma which account for nearly 20 per cent of cancer mortalities in Australia and over one third of cancers in childrenThe new $120 million Integrated Clinical School will support more than 1550 students, in addition to 1000 clinicians and researchers tackling cancer, heart disease, and obesity.This building will represent a new era in Australian medical education modelled on leading international university hospital precincts. The two new facilities will be part of the South Australian Health and Biomedical Precinct, which includes the Commonwealth-funded South Australian Health and Medical Research Institute and the State Government's new $2.1 billion Royal Adelaide Hospital.Bringing together the University of Adelaide's clinical schools and the Royal Adelaide Hospital ensures graduates are prepared for the clinical environment.\These projects are part of the Gillard Government's support for world class science and research, and complement other infrastructure such as the SA nodes of the Australian Phenomics Network and the European Molecular Biology Laboratory Australia.Together they will form part of a world-leading precinct delivering health and medical research, education and clinical practice close to Adelaide's centre.The Australian Government has invested more than $2 billion in research infrastructure since 2005 to support innovation and so create high-quality jobs.The recent 2013-14 Budget included a further $321.2 million in continuing support for Australian researchers and research. Costs for these projects will also be met from funding provided in the 2013-14 budget.</p>
