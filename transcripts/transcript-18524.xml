    <content><![CDATA[<p>On behalf of the Government and people of Australia we warmly congratulate Taur Matan Ruak on his election as East Timor's new President, following the announcement of the final results by the Timorese National Electoral Commission. </p>
<p>The candidates, electoral authorities, security agencies and people of East Timor also deserve great credit for a calm and orderly Presidential election. </p>
<p>The peaceful conduct of the election and well-run electoral process demonstrates the increasing maturity of democracy in East Timor, and inspires confidence ahead of Parliamentary elections on 7 July.</p>
<p>Australia worked closely with Taur Matan Ruak during the 10 years he was the Chief of East Timor's Defence Force (F-FDTL). </p>
<p>His leadership and vision for the development of the F-FDTL and his strengthened relationship with the leadership of the national police (PNTL) have had a profoundly beneficial impact on stability in East Timor. </p>
<p>Many members of the Australia Defence Force have enjoyed a strong and productive personal relationship with Taur Matan Ruak.</p>
<p>The Australian Government looks forward to working with Taur Matan Ruak as he continues his contribution to East Timor's peace and development in his new role as President.</p>
