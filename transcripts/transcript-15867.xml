    <content><![CDATA[<p>Her Majesty's announcement of the resignation as Governor-General of His Excellency Major General Michael Jeffery AC CVO MC (Rtd) marks the end of a very distinguished term of service in this high office.</p>
<p>On behalf of the Government and the people of Australia I record our deep appreciation of Major General Jeffery's services to his country and our great respect for the outstanding way he has carried out his duties as Governor-General.</p>
<p>Major General Jeffery has a long and admirable record of service to the community. Not only has he served as Governor-General of Australia, but he was also the Governor of Western Australia from 1993 to 2003. A Vietnam Veteran, Major General Jeffery held a number of very senior posts in the Australian Army, including as the first commanding officer of the SAS regiment.</p>
<p>Major General Jeffery will be relinquishing his appointment after just over five years in office. I hope that he and his wife Marlena will continue to enjoy good health and happiness in the years ahead.</p>
<p>I wish Major General Jeffery and Mrs Jeffery the very best for their future.</p>
