VISIT TO NEW ZEALAND<br />
AUCKLAND<br />
OPENING OF NEW ZEALAND EASTER SHOW Ap, 16<br />
BY MR. JOHN GORTON March 1968<br />
Mr. ( Co-Chairman, the Right Honourable the Prime Minister,<br />
Ladies and Gentlemen:<br />
You, Mr. Prime Minister, have said you attached<br />
some significance to the fact that within three months of<br />
assuming office in Australia the first overseas trip taken<br />
by me as Prime Minister of Australia has been to New Zealand.<br />
But this is, I think, in no way surprising. There cannot be<br />
two nations more contiguous than New Zealand and Australia.<br />
There cannot be two nations which have in the past forged<br />
closer bonds in war and peace and which are now fusing yet<br />
closer thosc bonds which were previously forged. And there<br />
cannot be two nations which, if they are given the opportunity<br />
to grow as they have the capacity and the will to grow, can<br />
more significantly complement each other, can more significantly<br />
help the growth of each other, and more enrich the standards<br />
of living of each other, and by so doing can more contribute<br />
to the region of the world in which these nations live. So<br />
it is not surprising that the first visit of an Australian<br />
Prime Minister should be to New Zealand, nor is it surprising<br />
that that visit should take place quickly.<br />
Rather would it be surprising if an Australian Prime<br />
Minister first went anywhere else, or delayed too long before<br />
he came to see those whose past and whose destinies are, as I<br />
believe, so closely intertwined, and that is why I think there<br />
will be now and in the future, not for a person but for an<br />
Australian Prime Minister a requiremcnt to be closely and<br />
constantly in touch with this nation and a requirement for a<br />
New Zealand Prime Minister to be closely and constantly in<br />
touch with ours.<br />
This has been an all too brief sojourn amongst you,<br />
but during the period of time I have been able to be here, I<br />
have had extended to me that hospitality I expected before I<br />
came and I expected much and got much and have had the<br />
opportunity to speak in Nellington to the leaders of commerce,<br />
to the leaders in politics, to the head men in all kinds of<br />
human endeavour. This, I think, is the first time that I<br />
have had the chance to speak to a large gathering of<br />
representative men and women of New Zealand, and to them I<br />
want to say that I bring in my person greetings from<br />
representative men and women of Australia.<br />
' tie are, as the Co-chairman has pointod out, as a<br />
nation an exhibitor in this show and have been an exhibitor<br />
for 10 years. d~ e are, I think, the only overseas exhibitor,<br />
and from my memory I think we have committe ourselves to<br />
continue to be an overseas exhibitor here until the lease of<br />
the showgrounds runs out in 1974. ' Ie cannot commit ourselves<br />
to be exhibitors after that because we don't know what the show<br />
and the owners of the showgrounds are going to do, but if they<br />
can work things out then you can count on us to continue to be<br />
involved. And so we should, because here, and particularly in<br />
this division of the show, we see the growth of secondary<br />
industry in New Zealand. </p>
<p>Now we, Australia and New Zealand, are competitors<br />
in producing the products of primary industry and our markets<br />
are, because of that, difficult of access, the one to the<br />
other, for primary products, and we are competitors in other<br />
countries of the world for the sale of primary products. And<br />
we have a balance of trade which is adverse to New Zealand.<br />
So how can we overcome this; what is being done to overcome<br />
it? I think we can overcome it b0y endeavouring to open our<br />
markets to the secondary products of New Zealand and by<br />
continuing to sell in New Zealand our own secondary products,<br />
and by expanding the volume of trade from New Zealand to<br />
Australia and back, in that way, and in secondary products<br />
but not entirely, hope to increase the manufacturing capacity<br />
and the markets of each of our nations.<br />
For that purpose we entered into an Australian/ New<br />
Zealand Free Trade Agreement. This required that, at the time<br />
that agreement was entered into two years or so ago, all those<br />
products of New Zealand which were duty free should continue<br />
to be duty free for admission to Australia, and it required<br />
that a listed number of products on which duties were charged<br />
when the agreement was entered into would have those duties<br />
progressively reduced over a period of eight years until those<br />
tariffs too were quite removed and those on that schedule were<br />
also freely admitted. The result of that is already showing,<br />
because, as your own Minister, Mr. Marshall, pointed out in a<br />
press statement last February, in the last half of 1967 the<br />
exports from New Zealand to Australia increased by over<br />
compared with the exports in the last half of 1966.<br />
And it is being required by this agreement that, by<br />
arrangement, in order to help both countrics, manufacturers<br />
can agree amongst themselves, and governments can endorse that<br />
agreement, that something manufactured in New Zealand and<br />
brought into and sold in Australia can be brought in and sold<br />
without tariff even though it is not on the list of goods to<br />
which I have rcferred, provided the New Zealand Government will<br />
grant import licences to Australia for 80% of the value of the<br />
goods imported to Australia from New Zealand. And it is provided<br />
in that agreement that as it progresses the governments converse<br />
with each other and can remove duties altogether before the<br />
eight-year period is up, and this has been done on more than<br />
one occasion, and just recently on undressed timber, so that<br />
last October a decision was made to admit undressed Douglas Fir;<br />
and this month another decision to admit undressed native timber<br />
without duty, which we calculate, without taking in the factor<br />
of growth, will mean an extra one million dollars a year trade<br />
for New Zealand with Australia.<br />
Now I know and I don't intend to traverse this<br />
subject too much, because it is more one for manufacturers<br />
and perhaps not immediately one which catches the imagination<br />
of men and women I know that not only in the field of<br />
secondary industry but also in the field of forest products<br />
is New Zealand vitally interested, and this, too, will be<br />
discussed between us in a week or so.<br />
But these are mere mechanics of something which we<br />
are seeking to achieve between us in the future, mere indications<br />
of thc paths we are trying to travel, more hopes that the goals<br />
that are held out to us will be reached. Those goals are ones<br />
that we seek in the future, and the building we are hoping to<br />
start now is one which will reach its fruition in the future,<br />
at some time when you are a nation of 20 million people and<br />
we are a nation of 50 million people perhaps, and we can together,<br />
by what is in effect going to be joint effort through these </p>
<p>3.<br />
kinds of' agreements and their working out, see that there are<br />
diversified opportunities for employment in this country and<br />
in ours, that there are markets in this country and in ours,<br />
amd that because there is this diversified manufacttiring<br />
capacity, because there are these markets, because we are both<br />
nations which can use technology, we will be able to make and<br />
sell to each other things more cheaply than before and in<br />
greater volume than before, and from the strength that generates<br />
in both our countries will be able again jointly to contribute<br />
to building up the standard of the region in which we live.<br />
This is a task that I think destiny has laid upon New Zealand<br />
and Australia. This is a task we cannot achieve if we hold<br />
each other at arms' length. This is a task which is coming<br />
nearer to being fulfilled because we are coming nearer together.<br />
Some feelings of suspicion in the past, some feelings of<br />
worrying about a big brother seeking a takeover, I think are<br />
going, and they must go, because that is not the question that<br />
confronts us. The question that confronts us is, how can we, who<br />
are not cousins but more like brothers, work together, being<br />
so close together and you, in terms of' time and distance<br />
are closer to Sydney than is Perth work together for this<br />
end which we have begun now to work for and which I think all<br />
no, not all, but 90% 6 of the people in my country and in yours<br />
wish to see pushed ahead until the goals I have outlined are<br />
attained, and wish to see achieved, as a building is achieved<br />
in the future, without having it handicapped by problems which<br />
arise from some immediate consideration, which ax'e difficulties<br />
but which can be overcome if that great structure which I think<br />
you want and we want is jointly to be achieved.<br />
Because this show helps towards it, because it gives<br />
me an opportunity to speak to those of you who come here, not<br />
as heads of great companies, not as members of parliament, not<br />
as people in the Chamber of Manufactures, but as men and women<br />
from New Zealand, because it gives me these opportunities, and<br />
because I think the aims in front of us are so high, I thank<br />
the organisers of this show so much for having given me the<br />
opportunity to talk to you, to weary you a little with statistics,<br />
but I hope to open to your minds a vision. It is because of<br />
this that I thank the organisers, and declare this show open. </p>
