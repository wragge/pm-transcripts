SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
ROYiAL MILITARY COLLEGE GRADUATION PARADE<br />
DUNTROON 11 DECEMBER 1990<br />
Distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,<br />
For those who are being commissioned today as officers of<br />
the Australian Army, this ceremony represents the successful<br />
conclusion of a tough, demanding course that has prepared<br />
them for the responsibility of military leadership.<br />
Let me say directly to those officers: as you embark on the<br />
challenges ahe~ ad, you can rely with confidence on the<br />
physical and Intellectual skills you have acquired here.<br />
They will stand you in good stead and you will always have<br />
cause for gratitude to the instructors of this College, and<br />
to your fellow cadets with whom you have shared so many<br />
experiences here.<br />
Today marks a great personal achievement by each of you, and<br />
your friends and family who are here to support you today<br />
are right in feeling very proud of you.<br />
So this is an important ceremony for you personally.<br />
It is also a % very important ceremony for Australia. As<br />
Australia's Prime Minister, let me explain to you why I<br />
believe that all1 Australians are entitled to share your<br />
pride in your achievement.<br />
This College at Duntroon was established only ten years<br />
-afte-r-Eederat. on, . and.. one-year -after this-district was<br />
selected as the site for the national capital.<br />
That the CollEtge was established so early in the life of our<br />
nation was sigrnificant. With Federation came the<br />
responsibility for Australia to provide for its own defence,<br />
not with a group of colonial forces, but with a national<br />
defence force. An essential part of that national defence<br />
force was this: College, providing our Army with quality<br />
leadership from its earliest days. </p>
<p>Just three years after the College was established, Duntroon<br />
graduates were departing for Gallipoli.<br />
At the flagpole in the parade ground where your march past<br />
took place earlier this morning are recorded the names of<br />
those Duntroon officer graduates who gave their lives at<br />
Anzac Cove and in France and in all the subsequent conflicts<br />
in which your predecessors have fought.<br />
So it is that for nearly eight decades, including through<br />
two World Wars, the skills, the sense of duty and where<br />
necessary the capacity for sacrifice, instilled here at<br />
Duntroon have enabled the Australian people to fulfill the<br />
most fundamental requirement of nationhood national<br />
security.<br />
But of course the role of the defence forces has extended<br />
well beyond their valourous service to the nation during<br />
those times of grave threat. Our Armed Forces have served<br />
not only in times of war but in times of peace they have<br />
served the national interest not only directly, but also by<br />
helping maintain a peaceful and secure international order.<br />
With professionalism and honour, the Australian Army has<br />
supported United Nations peacekeeping initiatives throughout<br />
the world since 1947.<br />
Today, our commitment to the principles of the United<br />
Nations is exemplified by our contribution to the<br />
multinational force in the Persian Gulf: three vessels of<br />
the Australian Navy are currently on duty in the area, with<br />
an Army Air Defence detachment on board HMAS Success.<br />
Australia has many interests at stake in the Gulf, as I said<br />
in my Statement to Parliament last week. Uppermost of these<br />
is the establishment of an international order based on the<br />
principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations:<br />
that international disputes must not be settled by force;<br />
that national borders must be respected; that aggressors<br />
must not be permitted to prevail.<br />
In the fluid international scene that has emerged in the<br />
wake of the Cold War, such principles must become the<br />
firmest of guidelines for international behaviour.<br />
Yet these principles are flouted with every day that Iraq<br />
remains in occupation of Kuwait.<br />
Let there be no illusion about the hazardous nature of the<br />
task which our forces may be called upon to perform. But<br />
let there be no doubt either, about the fundamentally<br />
important nature of their task. </p>
<p>3.<br />
Because, whether it is in a peacekeeping role or in<br />
conflict, it is on the individual men and women of the<br />
Defence Force on their dedication, professionalism and<br />
courage that Australia depends for its security and for<br />
its national contribution to global security. Our<br />
technology and equipment cannot operate without well-trained<br />
and committed personnel. It all comes down to people like<br />
you, and to your peers, and to the people you will lead.<br />
That is why I say this ceremony is of importance not just to<br />
those of you receiving their commissions today but to<br />
Australia as a whole.<br />
Since the first officer cadets departed from this College<br />
bound for Gallipoli, Australia has changed and the world has<br />
changed, in ways which our forefathers could not have<br />
foreseen.<br />
But the underlying principles still hold firm. We are still<br />
a free nation, still a proudly democratic nation. We still<br />
need to be able to look after ourselves to be self reliant<br />
in defending our vast continent in a challenging world.<br />
We still have an important contribution to make to<br />
protecting global peace and stability. So we still rely on<br />
our defence forces to meet the fundamental need of national<br />
security and to help attain the fundamental goal of world<br />
peace. All of us here today salute your achievement in reaching<br />
graduation. This is a day for you to be proud proud of<br />
your personal achievements as you enter the next phase of<br />
your careers proud to add to the traditions of the forces<br />
which have served this nation well in the past and will do<br />
so into the future and proud, I am sure, to be Australians<br />
and to know that you will serve your nation at all times<br />
with dedication and resourcefulness. As your motto so aptly<br />
puts it " Learning Promotes Strength".<br />
To those receiving their commissions today, I extend my<br />
heartiest congratulations. On behalf of the Australian<br />
people I wish you every success in your careers careers<br />
which are concerned with the possibility of war, but which<br />
we trust, by our preparedness to be strong in defence of<br />
peace, will be served in peace. </p>
