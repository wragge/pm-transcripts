___ PRIM MINISTER<br />
FOR PRESS 20 February 1976<br />
PRIME MINISTER TO VISiT NEW ZEALAND<br />
My visit to New Zealand from 8 March to 11 March is in<br />
response to an invitation from the New Zealand Prime Minister,<br />
Mr Muldoon, for discussions on matters of mutual interest.<br />
The visit will also provide the opportunity to attend the<br />
special meeting of the South Pacific Forum which is being<br />
held in New Zealand ( at Lake Okataina on 8-9 March) and to<br />
explore with South Pacific the ways in which Australia can<br />
further develop co-operation with the countries of the region.<br />
The visit to New Zealand so soon after the elections in<br />
both countries reflects the importance which both attach<br />
to a uniquely close relationship.<br />
With no country have we more common interests and connections<br />
than with New Zealand, our neighbour in the Soutb Pacific,<br />
partner in many field s, felliow membe 0F ANZtCUS a -d c he<br />
Commonwealth of Nations.<br />
The visit will provide the chance to establish a close working<br />
relationship with Mr Muldoon and for an exchange of views<br />
on economic and other issues facing both Governments. </p>
