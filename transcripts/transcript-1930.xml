EXTRACT FROM PRIME MINISTER'S REMARKS<br />
TO THE CHAMBERS OF COMMERCE RECEPTION<br />
PERTH, W. A. SEPTEMBER 1968<br />
There is just one other point I would make.<br />
There was some discussion the other day as to action<br />
which was taken over preventing an insurance company known as the<br />
MLC from being taken over by capital from abroad. Some questions<br />
were asked as to whether this meant there was a nalteration in the<br />
Government's policy about overseas capital inflow. Well, it doesn't.<br />
Our policy for a long time has been predicated on the<br />
fact that we need to get as much developmental capital inflow from<br />
abroad as it is possible to get if we are to develop as quickly as we<br />
should. If there is any doubt about that, then let any West Australian<br />
look at what is being done here and see whether it could possibly have<br />
been done from capital generated within our own resources. But we<br />
do want that capital to be overseas capital so that it is matched by<br />
goods so that we don't lose our overseas balance. We don't want it<br />
to be debenture capital raised inside Australia to be used by overseas<br />
interests, and the overseas interests own what is built. And so we<br />
wish to see that large amounts of Australian capital generated here<br />
at present under the control of an Australian company don't fall under<br />
the control of people outside. We saw no percentage in somebody<br />
being able to spend $ 40 or $ 50 million to gain control of $ 750 million<br />
of Australian capital. This desire that overseas capital should come<br />
from overseas still persists, as does the desire that Australians<br />
should be given the chance of equity participation in new developments.<br />
But remember this. It's no good Australians expecting<br />
to go along after risks have been taken, after a company has been<br />
developed, after some years of input has gone on and dividends are<br />
beginning to flow out and say, " Now we want to buy in. Not a bit.<br />
They need to be offered the chance to take the risks at the beginning<br />
and that is what we seek to see happen.<br />
