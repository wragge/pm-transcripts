FOR PRESS 29 ja nur 1979<br />
INDIA-AUSTRALIA JOINT PRESS STATEMENT<br />
The Rt. Hon. Malcolm Fraser, Prime Minister of Australia, is<br />
paying a visit to India for nine days from 25 January to<br />
2 February, 1979. During his stay he has called on the<br />
President of India, Shri Neelam Sanjiva Reddy.<br />
Discussions have been held between Mr. Fraser and the Prime<br />
Minister of India, Shri Morarji Desai, the two Deputy<br />
Prime Ministers of India and other Cabinet Ministers.<br />
The discussions covered a wide range of international and<br />
regional issues as well as the further development of<br />
bilateral relations between India and Australia. The talks,<br />
which took place in a spirit of utmost cordiality and<br />
understanding, were very valuable.<br />
The two Prime Ministers took pleasure in recalling their<br />
earlier meetings and discussions, particularly at the<br />
Commonwealth Heads of Government Regional Meeting in Sydney<br />
in February 1978, which had helped to bring the two<br />
countries closer together. The two Prime Ministers felt that<br />
their countries had many interests in common and that it<br />
would be to their mutual advantage further to build in<br />
practical ways on the close ties already existing between<br />
their peoples and governments.<br />
The discussions identified ways in which the relationship<br />
between India and Australia could be developed further.<br />
Officials from the two countries will be discussing the<br />
practical basis for further cooperation, particularly in<br />
science, technology, trade, energy and related areas.<br />
The two Prime Ministers expressed their satisfaction at the<br />
advantages to be derived from membership of the Commonwealth.<br />
They expressed the hope that this institution would prove<br />
increasingly useful as a forum for mutual cooperation and<br />
they recalled with satisfaction the cooperation already<br />
achieved among the countries of the region. / 2 </p>

The two Prime Ministers considered the international<br />
situation in depth. They noted that there were areas of<br />
grave concern as well as of positive satisfaction on<br />
the world scene. Among the subjects on which the<br />
discussions particularly focussed were the situation in<br />
South Asia and the neighbouring countries, South East<br />
Asia and the Indian Ocean.<br />
Both Prime Ministers agreed that there was an urgent need<br />
today for both aligned and non-aligned countries to find<br />
positive ways to reduce tensions. This should not be<br />
left to the super-powers alone. They re-affirmed that India<br />
and Australia from their respective positions India as<br />
a member of the non-aligned movement and Australia as an<br />
aligned country could play a useful role in promoting<br />
peace and stability by advocating responsible attitudes<br />
and constructive solutions to world problems.<br />
It was recognised that the two countries had different<br />
historical and cultural backgrounds but shared democratic<br />
experience and a common belief that differences could be<br />
resolved if there were consideration for the views of others<br />
and a genuine desire to seek out common objectives and<br />
grounds for agreement. Because of their respective and distinct<br />
positions, further developing their relations and working<br />
together more closely would help in creating an atmosphere<br />
conducive to cooperation rather than confrontation among<br />
nations. The Prime Ministers recorded their determination to strengthen<br />
the warm relationship between their two countries and also<br />
their intention to advocate and pursue the cause of<br />
moderation. The Prime Minister of Australia expressed his sincere<br />
appreciation of the warm welcome and hospitality-received by<br />
him and his family during this visit. He extended an<br />
invitation to the Prime Minister of India to visit<br />
Australia. The invitation was accepted with pleasure.<br />
During his stay in New Delhi, the Prime Minister of<br />
Australia was the chief guest at the Republic Day celebrations<br />
in the capital. He left New Delhi on 29 January, 1979, to<br />
visit Pantnagar, Chandigarh, Udaipur and Bombay. He is<br />
accompanied by Mrs. Fraser and three of their children and<br />
by senior officials of the Australian Government.<br />
