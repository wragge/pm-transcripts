ADDRESS BY THE PRIME MINISTER, MR E. G. WHITLAM, M. P.,<br />
TO THE FEDERAL CONFERENCE OF THE AUSTRALIAN LABOR PARTY,<br />
TERRIGAL, 5-FEBRUARY 1975<br />
It is only 18 months since we last met in Conference<br />
at Surfers' Paradise. We set this time for the Conference in<br />
the belilef that given the normal operation of our system,<br />
given the normal rules of the game, we would-here be<br />
preparing the program for our first election after the<br />
victory of 1972. The fact that it hasn't worked out that way<br />
is just one example of the extraordinary task imposed upon<br />
the Party and upon the Australian Labor Government. We now<br />
know that our opponents will tear up the rule-book and write<br />
new rules whenever they think it suits them. Fortunately,<br />
in May last year, they seriously misjudged the temper of the<br />
people and the spirit of the Party. We can always look back<br />
with great pride at the campaign of 1972. But the victory of<br />
1974, in circumstances of enormous difficulty, was no less<br />
a splendid achievement. The Party was aroused; its<br />
determination, its purposeful anger about the-fraud being<br />
attempted by our opponents3 carried us through and carried us<br />
back into Government to continue to carry out the programa<br />
three-' year program for which we have now twice been<br />
elected. It's too easily said that 1974 was a bad year<br />
for Labor. True, it was an extraordinarily difficult year,<br />
but the fact remains that in circumstances of world-wide<br />
difficulty, we won an election against great odds. For only<br />
the second time in our history, we won a second consecutive<br />
election. The war of nerves waged by our opponents continues<br />
unrelenting. They no more accept the verdict of 1974 than<br />
they did the verdict of 1972. So the pressures on the Partyon<br />
our nerve, our resources, our organisation, our loyalty<br />
remain tremendous. We need the crusading spirit of ' 72 and<br />
the deep determination of ' 74 to carry us through 1975 and<br />
far beyond. We've seen over the last two years how very rapidly<br />
circumstances can change. In every sense they have been two<br />
years of great change. Most of all, and best of all, there<br />
have been the positive changes which we as a Labor Government<br />
have made in the Australian ' society and in Australia's position<br />
in the world. There have been rapid and unpredictable changes<br />
in economic and political realities. In going about its<br />
business Conference must bear this in mind. Our task here<br />
is to draw up the conti-nuing program a program for the next<br />
election and beyond. Our task is to revise the existing<br />
platform and to make the platform even more relevant to the<br />
future of Australia as we see it. We cannot be preoccupied<br />
with one issue or one problem, and certainly not just this<br />
week's or this month's most topical issue. We can't write<br />
the platform in terms laid down by today's headlines. 9./ 2 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
Of course, each conference reflects the mood<br />
and need of the times. Throughout the period covered by<br />
the three great conferences of 1967, 1969 and 1971 we were<br />
always deeply concerned about Vietnam. Yet, crucial as<br />
that issue was, if we had allowed ourselves as a Conference,<br />
as a Party, to be completely preoccupied with it, if we<br />
had not used those Conferences to transform the whole of<br />
the platform, to revise and modernise it, we would not be<br />
in Government today. Now, as always, Conference must build<br />
for the-future. That is what makes great and memorable<br />
Conferences. Conference and the whole Party should also bear<br />
. this in mind when assessing the work of the Government and<br />
judging our actions. There has been a great deal of talk<br />
in recent weeks about reversing policy. Don't fall for<br />
the line. We are not going into reverse; we are not<br />
abandoning the program; we are not going back on the mandate.*<br />
It's true we are going through times of great economic<br />
change and economic uncertainty. All the mixed economies,<br />
all the democracies, all our trading partners, all the<br />
industrialised countries, are sharing the same experience.<br />
From the time we cime in we've made economic decisions<br />
relevant to the needs of the time and the problems of the<br />
time.. It would of course be grossly irresponsible to refuse<br />
to budge from a decision, correct enough in one set of<br />
circumstances, when a completely different set of circumstances<br />
* arose. Of course, we are adjusting; of course we are prepared<br />
to adjust. But the underlying direction, the overriding<br />
objective remains constant, unchanged, unchangeable to carry<br />
out the program, to fulfil the mandate.<br />
Jim Cairns has spoken here, and around Australia,<br />
about the difficulties of economic management in a mixed<br />
economy. It raises special difficulties for a democratic<br />
socialist party. As Jim Cairns has said, we find ourselves<br />
now in a position of seeking ways of restoring profitability.<br />
We have to do that if we are to restore full employment.<br />
I will have something more to say about this in<br />
detail in relation to our particular economic problems and<br />
unemployment and inflation. But don't let's forget that<br />
we have always recognised the relationship between the prosperity<br />
of the private sector and our ability to carry out the program.<br />
We should not think there is something shameful or demeaning<br />
about it. There is no sell-out involved. Indeed, in the<br />
1972 Policy Speech, I laid particular stress on this the<br />
relation between our ability to carry out the proqram and<br />
the strength of . all sectors of the economy including the<br />
private sector. I said: " Our program particularly in education,<br />
welfare, hospitals and cities, can only work successfully<br />
within the framework of strong uninterrupted growth." / 3 </p>
<p>We have to ensure those conditions of else abandon<br />
the program. The fight against unemployment and the fight<br />
for the program go hand-in-hand. Behind any temporary measures<br />
and changes we have made and may make lies the great continuity<br />
and the great consistency our determination to carry out<br />
the program, the program based on the decisions of Conference,<br />
the program twice put to the Australian people and twice<br />
endorsed by them.<br />
And what a mighty work it has been, and yet there<br />
is still so much to do. Delegates will now have a copy of<br />
the document called " Report 74" which sets out the achievements<br />
in a single year. There's been only one year to rival it<br />
for achievement 1973.'<br />
I find there a re frequent complaints on two scores.<br />
One is that we have done too much too soon. The-other is<br />
that we have failed to communicate. As to the first, we have<br />
to ask: which of our achievements all of them in pursuit<br />
of the platform and in fulfillment of our pledges should we<br />
have abandoned or deferred? We have, in fact, deferred some,<br />
such as our schedule for the abolition of the means test, but<br />
in everything we've done there has been a clear priority<br />
the priority of greatest need. We have acted, urgently because<br />
the need has been urgent. We couldn't have delayed in<br />
rebuilding the ramshackle structures and systems we inherited.<br />
We had to act urgently to clear away the accumulated deadwood<br />
of 23 years, and we are doing so. Of course this upset the<br />
vested interests, those who had it so good for so long.<br />
And this gets to the second question communication.<br />
The people whom our program is designed first and most to<br />
benefit are not in general the most articulate, or the best<br />
organised sections of the community. The interests and-. groups<br />
who may feel disadvantaged or feel that their privileged<br />
position is in some way threatened are of course, the most<br />
articulate, influential and powerful sections of the community.<br />
We can't really expect the press to take up the cudgels on<br />
our behalf. The cudgels are thoroughly employed in bashing<br />
us. And it is a myth that the Government has built up its<br />
own vast propaganda machine this is just not true.<br />
In the final analysis we will have to rely on<br />
ourselves to get our message across. We do have in our ranks,<br />
as members, as supporters, some of the most articulate people<br />
in Australia. * We must not allow the media to, dictate the<br />
terms of debate. We cannot sit back supinely. I It is time<br />
to go on the offensive as we did in 1972. Of course it is<br />
easier to attack from the advantage of opposition, particularly<br />
an opposition as irresponsible as this present contemptible<br />
rabble. / 4 </p>
<p>-4-<br />
But the record of the achievement of our Government<br />
is there. If we ourselves are apologetic about it or silent<br />
about it, or if we fight just on the terms and issues laid<br />
down by others then we have no chance of getting the essential<br />
messg across. That's the real problem about communication.<br />
The Labor program the program of this Government<br />
is to ensure that the services and opportunities which the<br />
community must provide are made more abuhdant and more equal<br />
for all Australians wherever they live, wherever they choose<br />
to live or wherever they are obliged to live.<br />
I. don't expect to see in my time a total transformation<br />
of the political and economic systems. I don't expect it to<br />
occur in the lifetime of delegates here. But we can achieve<br />
in our time the situation where anybody who has the will can<br />
get a proper education to the limit of his ability, where<br />
anybody who has the need can have the best medical attention<br />
and hospital treatment, where anybody who has to live or<br />
work in a city can have decent transport, a decent environment<br />
and decent means df recreation.<br />
Wages and salaries are becoming less and less the<br />
dominant factor in determining a family's real welfare. No<br />
longer is a person' s income the sole measure of the quality of<br />
his life or the opportunities he can provide for his family.<br />
They depend on things which the community acting as a whole<br />
provides for its individual members, and which the community<br />
alone can now adequately provide. Increasingly, a family's<br />
standard of living is determined not so much by their income<br />
but by where they live and by the community services provided<br />
by the community in which they live. Their health, children's<br />
education, opportunities and leisure, sense of security and<br />
real security increasingly depend on the community's ability<br />
or will to provide for them to provide for the needs 6f<br />
individuals by collective decision and collective action.<br />
Thes6 general thoughts are very relevant to any<br />
consideration of unemployment and inflation. There is a<br />
link between wages and inflation and there is a link between<br />
inflation and unemployment. There are certain facts which<br />
I'm bound . to state, not just as Prime Minister but as Leader<br />
of the Labor Party, because they go to the heart of our<br />
present problems. Don't let's have this childish accusation,<br />
any time one of my colleagues or I state the facts, that we<br />
are union-bashing. I will not mis-state the facts, over-state<br />
them or under-! itate them. And the fact is that we cannot beat<br />
inflation or unemploymfent if there are wage increases this<br />
year on the scale of last year' s increases. I certainly<br />
expect union officials and advocates to try their hardest<br />
for their members. But the over-all task is to ensure<br />
that gains are real and lasting. </p>
<p>There must be a l * imit . to the increases of wages<br />
which the economy can stand in any one year. Only so much<br />
extra can be provided from the growth of the economy or<br />
re-distribution from profits. Wage increases beyond such<br />
limits must inevitably cause price increases and thus attempts<br />
to improve the living standards by wage claims are frustrated.<br />
I believe there is evidence that in recent times wage<br />
increases have gone beyond the present limits of the capacity<br />
of the economy to pay. We have a very rapid increase in the<br />
share of GNP going to wages and salaries. Wage and salary<br />
increases have been much greater than the rate of price increases.<br />
I will give some examples. In our first: two years<br />
of office, the Consumer Price Index increased by 31 percent.<br />
Average weekly earnings increased by 40 per cent. Minimiumn<br />
award rates for men increased by 47 per cent. Minim~ um award<br />
rates for women increased by 70 per cent. With the taxc cuts<br />
we brought into operation on the 1st January, real average<br />
weekly earnings after tax have gone up by 7.5 per cent.<br />
But its support for indexation, the Government<br />
has indicated clearly its determination to protect the<br />
real level of wages.<br />
Australians should-be clear what the opposition's<br />
attack on indexation means every wage earner would have<br />
his living stan~ dard reduced.<br />
And here again, let's be clear about the alternative.<br />
Take Malcolm Fraser. He makes no secret either of his<br />
ambitions or his intentions. You Might take notice of him<br />
as Mr Snedden's rival and challenger. You might take notice<br />
of him as Mr Snedden's appointee as Shadow Minister for Labour.<br />
He has tried to sack Snedden but Snedden has not dared to<br />
sack him, nor has he repudiated the industrial policy which<br />
Mr Fraser unveiled in his speech to the ANZAAS Congress two<br />
weeks ago. And there it is in all its horrendous detail<br />
a promise of a return to the penal clauses, goal sentences<br />
not just for officials but for erring members, a complete<br />
wage freeze, an entire apparatus of union intimindation. There<br />
is one great difference between Mr Snedden and Mr Fraser.<br />
Mr Fraser is at least his own man. You will remember when<br />
Mr Snedden was Minister for Labour he supported the idea of a<br />
Prices Notification Tribunal. When he became Treasurer-he<br />
opposed it. When he changed his advisers he changed his policies<br />
and since he has been Leader of the Opposition the same<br />
process continue! s different advisers, different policies.<br />
Mr Fraser has at least come clean; employees now know exactly<br />
what is in store for them, under any Government in which he<br />
might have any say. ./ 6 </p>
<p>-6-<br />
I do hope the Party and the Trade Unions will make<br />
the connection between real living standards and the Government's<br />
programs. Inflationary wage settlements this year would<br />
threaten both real living standards and the program. And, of<br />
course, we have to bear in mind the alternative. It has been<br />
highly instructive to see the reaction of our opponents to<br />
our curz'ent difficulties. They have shown themselves in<br />
their true colours. Trendyism has had its little day. The<br />
forces of the right have reasserted themselves with a vengeance<br />
even Mr Hamer has dropped his trendy image so carefully and<br />
expensively cultivated and hopped on the Petersen Bandwaggon.<br />
For an example of sheer bloody-mindedness, what could excel<br />
the Victorian challenge to the High Court on the validity of<br />
the Australian Assistance Plan a pioneer experiment in<br />
community involvement. If anything disposes of the idea that<br />
the Liberals are concerned about so-called centralism, about<br />
community involvement, it's that. The list of benefits<br />
imperilled by this challenge is terrifying and goes far beyond<br />
the Australian Assistance Plan.<br />
It includes such matters as assistance for isolated<br />
children, pre-school teacher education allowances,<br />
Commonwealth Technical Scholarships, grants under the new<br />
program for child care and pre-school education, national<br />
apprenticeship schemes, grants to community agencies inolved<br />
in migrant welfare, local aid for aboriqinas, grants fox<br />
aborigine community development, protection of aboriginal<br />
sacred site%, aborigiftal community enterprises, aged pc. 0z'<br />
homes and hostels, sheltered employment assistance, handicapped<br />
children's assistance, homeless persons' assistance, meals<br />
on wheels, home nursing subsidies, nursing homes' ass' t nze<br />
and many, many more. I am advised that in all, soMe 56<br />
separate programs of assistance from the Australian Govw nment<br />
not all of them the creation of our Governraent (. ould he<br />
affected if the challenge were to succeed.<br />
What on earth have these matters to do with t1<br />
question of State rights or centralism? The degree of<br />
misrepresentation on this question is astonishing. We oughtn't<br />
to allow ourselves to succumb to it. We have had uhis<br />
extraordinary spectacle of Mr Bjelke-Petersen and Sir Charles<br />
Court descending on poor, beleagurered London breathing<br />
fire against the Australian Govenment in general, and me in<br />
particular. It is amazing how these super patriots, Mr Snedden<br />
included, feel free to'denigrate and downgrade Adstralia abroad,<br />
to foul the nest. Mr Bjelke-Petersen alleges that I set out<br />
in London to abolish the Agents-General. Whatever I might<br />
think about the anachronism and pretension of Agents-General,<br />
I have never raised the issue. / 7 </p>
<p>-7-<br />
The only time I have been asked to raise any matter<br />
concerning the Agents-General was by themselves in 1969. They<br />
had a terrible problem and petitioned me in London to help<br />
them. They were terribly upset by their low rating at official<br />
functions. Under the order of precedence they lay somewhere<br />
under the Mayor of Manchester and just on top of the Dame of Sark.<br />
So you see the weighty problems that the Agents-General have<br />
to deal-with. But I have not raised the issue. The only matter<br />
I have raised with the British Government is the question of<br />
Appeals to the Privy Council that the Australian High Court<br />
would be the final Court of Appeal. This does not involve any<br />
question of State rights, because in matters between the States<br />
and the national Government, the High Court is the final<br />
court of Appeal. It should be so for all matters. It is what<br />
I believe I am sure it is what most Australians believe and<br />
in particular it is what the platform says.<br />
In London I did, however, say in a public speech<br />
in very general terms something about the responsibilities of<br />
the national Government and the State Governmen * ts. I pointed<br />
out that in the two Australian States with the largest<br />
populations it was obvious that only through the involvement<br />
of the national Govenment could the people be provided with<br />
essential public services like health, public transport and<br />
education. In the States with-the largest areas, only the<br />
national Government could safeguard a control of the vast<br />
new natural resources discovered in the last 10 years.<br />
Later this year we will be concluding a new<br />
five year financial agreement with the States. I should stress<br />
this: no reimbursement formula would solve the financial<br />
difficulties of the States as permanently and successfully<br />
as acceptance by the National Government of responsibility<br />
for hospitals and railways. It is not enough to say thdt<br />
because these are traditionally fields for the States, nothing<br />
can be done. Where would our universities be if we had<br />
accepted the traditional argument?<br />
And of course, over the whole range of policy,<br />
the traditionalist argument is one that should not wash with<br />
our Party the Party of change, the Party of reform. It<br />
has been by-breaking with tradition, by seeking new methods<br />
that we have been able to achieve so much in so short a time.<br />
We shall go from this Conference with our program<br />
refreshed and I believe, with our determination refreshed.<br />
I don't disguise the difficulties. The real difficulty is<br />
purely political this notion that an election may be held<br />
every 6 months at the whim of half the Senate. The opposition<br />
is characterised by an extraordinary combination of irresponsibility<br />
and arrogance. Mr Snedden talks as though it were his<br />
prerogative to decide when the next election may be. That is<br />
a fantastic assumption for any Leader of the opposition, but<br />
doubly fantastic for this one a man with the shakiest hold<br />
on the leadership of his own party, a man who cannot commit<br />
his own Senators, on this issue or any other. </p>
<p>-8-<br />
He cannot commit them to bad conduct or compel<br />
them to good conduct. The Parliamentarv system everywhere<br />
is being challenged as never before. The irresponsibility<br />
of the Opposition injects a new poison, a further uncertainty<br />
into the Australian system. For our part, we are determined<br />
to' work on the basic assumption of elections that in 1974<br />
the people elected us for a further three years and we have<br />
a mandate to carry out our program during the full term for<br />
which we were elected.<br />
Any other approach would. be to succumb to the<br />
tactics and the propaganda of our opponents. We should not<br />
get unnerved about difficulties. Politics is by its nature<br />
a difficult business. None know it better than we in<br />
this room. We did not get an armchair ride into office<br />
and we could not have expected an armchair ride once we were<br />
in office. Government is about solving problems. Because<br />
these are always human problems, they'don't lend themselves<br />
to perfect, complete solutions. Difficulty is the name of<br />
the game. Don't be fazed; don't be panicked. The people<br />
of Australia placef a high privilege upon us. It is a great<br />
honour to have been twice entrusted with the conduct of<br />
their affairs. I am confident we shall emerge from this Conference<br />
further strengthened in our ability to carry out that trust. </p>
