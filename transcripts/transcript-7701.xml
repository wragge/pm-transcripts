CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
LAUNCH OF APARTHEID AND INTERNATIONAL FINANCE<br />
CANBERRA 8 AUGUST 1989<br />
I'm not the first person to observe that success has many<br />
fathers while failure is an orphan.<br />
Now I will not join the throng of people claiming paternity<br />
of this successful and significant publishing venture,<br />
Apartheid and International Finance.<br />
But I will lay claim to being perhaps one of the<br />
grandfathers.<br />
When the Commonwealth Heads of Government last met, in<br />
Vancouver in 1987, it was against an extraordinary backdrop<br />
of events in South Africa.<br />
The mid 1980s had seen a dramatic sharpening of the<br />
courageous protests by the black people of South Africa<br />
seeking to gain fundamental political rights.<br />
The response by the South African authorities had been<br />
violence, further repression, blanket censorship and, in<br />
June 1986, the declaration of a state of emergency that has<br />
been extended continuously to this date.<br />
The period was also one of acute crisis for the finances of<br />
South Africa.<br />
In late August 1985, South Africa came under such intense<br />
pressure from its creditors that it defaulted on a portion<br />
of its international debt and as a result, became, as Sonny<br />
Ramphal says in his foreword to this book, an unacceptable<br />
risk. Facing a foreign exchange crisis, South Africa was forced to<br />
close its exchanges for four days while officials arranged<br />
not, it was understood, long term solutions, but short-term<br />
rescheduling.<br />
Clearly, here was a weakness in the South African system<br />
that posed a very real threat to its very existence.<br />
For the opponents of apartheid, the situation demanded<br />
closer scrutiny and, where possible, tighter pressure. </p>
<p>So at Vancouver, I proposed that the Commonwealth examine<br />
the links between South Africa and the international<br />
financial system.<br />
The report that emerged was presented to the second meeting<br />
of the Commonwealth Foreign Ministers on Southern Africa in<br />
Toronto last year.<br />
It was decided and here Gareth Evans might like to claim a<br />
degree of paternity that the report was so significant<br />
that it should be brought to the attention of a broader<br />
public through a revised and expanded text.<br />
For the authors I have nothing but the highest praise.<br />
Tony Cole, a deputy secretary in my Department, was the<br />
chairman of the committee of Commonwealth officials who did<br />
the primary research for the report.<br />
Keith Ovenden, hand picked for the job by Gareth Evans, is<br />
one of those fortunate, and rare, writers who can with<br />
lucidity draw out and communicate the relevance of even an<br />
arcane matter like an intricate by-way of the international<br />
financial system.<br />
I do not think it unnecessary to add that the complexity and<br />
confidentiality of the research they undertook required<br />
great diligence on the part of the researchers and<br />
considerable trust by their anonymous sources in the<br />
financial community.<br />
Together, Ovenden and Cole worked at breakneck speed to<br />
finalise this text and Penguin Books have performed a minor<br />
miracle to produce and publish their text.<br />
The result is a book incisive in its analysis and so<br />
up-to-date that it deals with developments that happened a<br />
mere ten weeks ago.<br />
The story that Keith Ovenden and Tony Cole tell has three<br />
great themes.<br />
First, they draw attention to the economic aspects of<br />
apartheid. It is not difficult I think to comprehend the moral<br />
dimensions of the fight against apartheid, or to appreciate<br />
from our vantage point in a Western democratic nation the<br />
political outrage that is apartheid.<br />
Without in any way downplaying the importance of those<br />
aspects, it is stimulating to read such an informed account<br />
of the economically offensive elements of apartheid.<br />
Apartheid, as the authors say in their introduction, is<br />
synonymous with waste: the waste of human potential and<br />
human resources. </p>
<p>To illustrate this point, the authors tell the story of the<br />
" homeland" of KwaNdebele, which lies about 110 kilometres<br />
north-east of Pretoria and was created in the 1970s to<br />
prevent the large number of black people who were being<br />
forced off white-owned commercial farms from settling in the<br />
cities. Its current population could be around half-a-million<br />
people, but in this artificially created entity few of them<br />
have jobs.<br />
Its workers either take work contracts, which force them to<br />
live away from their families for months on end, or else<br />
they shuttle between KwaNdebele and Pretoria every day to go<br />
to work.<br />
This second option means four hours of travel in the<br />
morning, out of the so-called homeland to the white city,<br />
and another four hours back again in the night.<br />
They leave home at 3 am and return at 9 pm a qualitatively<br />
different experience, you can imagine, from travelling<br />
minutes by coach between a downtown luxury hotel and an<br />
international rugby or cricket ground.<br />
This extraordinary daily movement of people requires buses,<br />
and in the 1988-89 South African budget the sum of 400<br />
million Rand was appropriated to subsidise the buses that<br />
service these people.<br />
In the same budget, the upgrading of residential housing in<br />
black areas received 106 million Rand about one quarter of<br />
the bus funding.<br />
So apartheid doesn't fund industrial development near major<br />
population centres, it doesn't care about social dislocation<br />
or even the standard of housing: it subsidises buses!<br />
And just as strikingly, apartheid's priorities for providing<br />
for its people lie well below its priority to maintain its<br />
armed forces. The South African armed forces account for<br />
per cent of the South African budget, or some 5 per cent<br />
of its GDP.<br />
In the degree of Government intervention, in the stark<br />
inequalities between the living standards of the white elite<br />
and the black majority, in the distortions of its financial<br />
institutions, apartheid represents a fundamentally<br />
inefficient and internally contradictory system one that<br />
is utterly incapable of meeting the demands of the<br />
post-industrial interdependent global economy.<br />
As the authors put it in a masterful understatement, " the<br />
politics of race have introduced distortions and the<br />
misallocation of resources on a scale that is now making for<br />
most interesting developments." </p>
<p>This of course leads to the second great theme of this book.<br />
Sanctions do work.<br />
Keith Ovenden and Tony Cole demonstrate that the embargo on<br />
loans to South Africa that has been in place since the<br />
crisis of 1985 has been the most effective tool of<br />
international pressure in forcing the South African<br />
Government to consider reform.<br />
It has, they argue, had the effect of restricting economic<br />
growth in South Africa by forcing a continuation of capital<br />
outflows, and compelling the regime to generate current<br />
account surpluses.<br />
The follow-on is clear: with a desperate need for new<br />
employment opportunities for a rapidly expanding population,<br />
low rates of growth will mean declining standards of living.<br />
And, as Ovenden and Cole put it, while South Africa clings<br />
to apartheid, and while financial sanctions persist, South<br />
Africa's freedom of financial and budgetary manoeuvre will<br />
be steadily reduced.<br />
So internal pressure for reform by the oppressed black<br />
majority, the economic cost of maintaining apartheid's<br />
grotesque structures and the international credit squeeze<br />
have combined to bring about a fundamental economic<br />
instability an instability which the South African<br />
Government is unlikely to rectify unless it commits itself<br />
to wholesale political reform.<br />
For this assessment we have not only the evidence offered by<br />
the economic data and statistics produced in this book, but<br />
also the expressed views of white South African leaders<br />
themselves.<br />
On 5 May this year, Finance Minister Barend Du Plessis said<br />
that austerity measures were necessary to enable the<br />
country's foreign exchange reserves to withstand what he<br />
called " the economic onslaught against South Africa"<br />
A few days later, South African Reserve Bank Governor<br />
Gerhard de Kock acknowledged in a public speech that<br />
international pressures, particularly financial sanctions,<br />
had crippled South Africa's ability to deliver sustained<br />
economic growth.<br />
This trend could not be reversed without " adequate progress<br />
in the field of political and constitutional reform"<br />
" South Africa's economic future", said de Kock, " is<br />
inextricably entwined with its political future".<br />
So the message is getting through. </p>
<p>The third theme of this book is that the world-wide<br />
revulsion against apartheid has been a vital source of this<br />
pressure for change in South Africa.<br />
The authors argue that it has been the pressure of churches,<br />
shareholders, clients and customers, public and private<br />
bodies, indeed, ordinary citizens throughout the world which<br />
has persuaded, if not compelled, major financial<br />
institutions, multinational conglomerates and other<br />
companies to stop doing business with. apartheid.<br />
Theirs is a convincing argument and it is a welcome one.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen,<br />
I began by talking about how the Vancouver CHOGM took place<br />
against the backdrop of the 1985 financial embargo on South<br />
Africa. It is clear the Kuala Lumpur CHOGM which takes place in<br />
October will have before it the next step in the playing out<br />
of South Africa's financial difficulties the June 1990<br />
crunch point when the current agreement for bank loans<br />
expires and when a number of bonds require repayment or<br />
rolling over.<br />
It is my very strong hope that the financial community will<br />
maintain the pressure that has so far proved such a powerful<br />
force for change in South Africa and that public opinion<br />
will continue to exert its constructive influence on this<br />
process. I hope too that the Commonwealth will use all its influence<br />
to ensure that pressure is maintained.<br />
we could have hardly hoped for more powerful ammunition.<br />
with this book, we can deliver even more confidently to the<br />
world our message about the efficacy of financial sanctions.<br />
Economic and financial sanctions should not just be left to<br />
the judgement of the market place.<br />
Government action has an important and legitimate role to<br />
play in this process.<br />
As the Commonwealth has shown, governments can be effective<br />
in taking a lead through regulating trade activities,<br />
through drafting codes of conduct for business, and through<br />
examining other sanctions in driving home to white South<br />
Africa that while it practices the policies of apartheid, it<br />
will be at the margin of the international community.<br />
In the end, what we want to see in South Africa is reform<br />
real reform. </p>
<p>Nothing less than a complete and total abandonment of<br />
apartheid, nothing less than the full participation of all<br />
South Africans in every aspect of South African life, will<br />
fit the bill.<br />
Recent signs that the South African Government may be<br />
willing to negotiate are encouraging, but as yet they have<br />
delivered nothing.<br />
Certainly there are no indications that apartheid will be<br />
abolished.<br />
Until a meaningful reform process is in place a process<br />
based, for example, on the principles put forward three<br />
years ago by the Commonwealth Group of Eminent Persons<br />
South Africa should expect the international community to<br />
condemn its behaviour and examine ways in which pressure may<br />
be brought to bear against it.<br />
AS I said in opening the current meeting of Commonwealth<br />
Foreign Ministers, sanctions are adopted with a sense of<br />
regret, with the aim of bringing South Africa to its senses,<br />
not to its knees.<br />
They are not a form of punishment rather, if carefully<br />
targetted, they are an effective way in which we as an<br />
international community can apply pressure to encourage<br />
change in South Africa.<br />
Australia has adopted the full range of sanctions, including<br />
financial sanctions, agreed to by Commonwealth leaders at<br />
recent CHOGM meetings.<br />
Obviously the impact of these measures on South Africa would<br />
be far greater if they were adopted also by South Africa's<br />
major trading partners, and in the past two years I have<br />
personally written to the leaders of those countries asking<br />
them to consider adopting that course.<br />
Sanctions are supported by the leaders of black South<br />
Africa: Archbishop Tutu, Nelson Mandela and Oliver Tambo.<br />
Yet despite this clear endorsement, despite the demonstrated<br />
effect of financial sanctions in particular, there is still<br />
frequent confusion surrounding the debate on their<br />
desirability. This book will, I can confidently predict, help to disperse<br />
that confusion and will substantially increase public<br />
understanding about this important issue.<br />
I am pleased that Gareth Evans took the initiative in<br />
encouraging this project, and I am proud of my Government's<br />
involvement. This is a well-crafted book that represents an invaluable<br />
contribution to illuminating what is surely one of the most<br />
vital issues of our time. </p>
<p>7.<br />
It is fitting that it should be launched in such<br />
distinguished company today, among a group of people who<br />
through their work on the Commonwealth Committee of Foreign<br />
Ministers on Southern Africa have done so much to lead<br />
international debate on South Africa. </p>
