PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA18 NOVEMBER 1988<br />
GOVERNMENT'S NEW APPROACH TO CONSERVATION<br />
AND RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT<br />
I am announcing today a series of new principles and<br />
processes to apply in future conservation and development<br />
decisions. A copy of the principles is attached.<br />
Existing decisions, such as those on the Wet Tropics of<br />
North East Queensland and Tasmanian forests, will not be<br />
affected by today's announcements.<br />
The new processes involve:<br />
the establishment of a Resource Assessment Commission<br />
( RAC), an-independent body to inquire into major,<br />
complex land use decisions;<br />
streamlining and enhancing the operations of the<br />
Australian Heritage Commission ( AHC);<br />
the negotiation of a Forest Accord;<br />
the development of a National Forests Inventory;<br />
a review of existing environmental data bases, with a<br />
view to filling identified gaps; and<br />
increasing the environmental expertise of industry<br />
councils and enhancing community understanding of<br />
conservation issues.<br />
I see today's'announcements as the beginning of a more<br />
harmonious approach in the resolution ofconflicting demands<br />
on Australia's natural resources. AgricuIture and mining<br />
contribute more than 70 per cent of our export income, yet<br />
Australia contains some of the world's most valuable and<br />
fragile environments.<br />
Ultimately, of course, final decisions must rest with<br />
governments. The new processes will assist in informing<br />
governments, as well as those in the community seeking to<br />
participate in discussions on major land use issues.<br />

our new approach builds on the National conservation<br />
Strategy for Australia ( t4CSA), which was developed by the<br />
Commonwealth in consultation with other interested parties<br />
in 1983. It provides a framework within which industry can<br />
operate with confidence, and achieves a balance between the<br />
need to develop our natural resources and to preserve our<br />
environment for future generations.<br />
Sometimes hard choices have to be made between envi-ronmental<br />
protection and resource development. The Government's<br />
concern is to see that its decisions are timely, well<br />
988 informed and, above all, that all interested parties State<br />
and local governments, industries, unions, and community<br />
groups and individuals have the opportunity for their<br />
views to be taken into account.<br />
I will be writing to State Premiers, the Chief Minister of<br />
the Northern Territory and interested groups on consultative<br />
nt mechanisms to give effect to the NCSA.<br />
The Resource Assessment Commission ( RAC) will be responsible<br />
to me. The Government will initiate inquiries and determine<br />
e -terms of reference and timetables. The Commissioners for<br />
each inquiry will be appointed by the Government on the<br />
recommendation of the Chairs of the Australian Science and<br />
Technology Council and the Industries Assistance Commission.<br />
The RAC will draw on the resources of the Government<br />
on departments and agencies as appropriate for each inquiry.<br />
RAC hearings will be public and all interested parties and<br />
N individuals will be able to put evidence before the<br />
Commission. The Commission will produce draft reports which<br />
will be available for public comment. The final report will<br />
also be published.<br />
The Government has reviewed the Australian Heritage<br />
Commission and has decided to streamline and enhance its<br />
operations. Legislation will be introduced to improve<br />
procedures for compiling the Register of the National<br />
a Estate, including better arrangements for notify'ing owners<br />
and other interested parties of intentions to list places on<br />
the Register.<br />
The AHC's annual budget will be increased by $ 2 million, and<br />
staff levels will be boosted substantially to remove<br />
backlogs in the Commission's work.<br />
mands The Government has agreed to Senator Cook's proposal for a<br />
ing Forest Accord. Senator Cook has maintained close contacts<br />
yet with interested groups in developing the proposal put to the<br />
-id Government. He will now conduct negotiations with the aim<br />
of concluding a Forest Accord.<br />
Because it shares community concern about the conservation<br />
ng of forest resources, the Government has decided to develop a<br />
to National Forests Inventory, including a survey of old<br />
growth forests. The Departments of Primary Industries and<br />
Energy and the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and 3567 </p>
<p>3.<br />
Territories will co-operate on the survey and will seek the<br />
co-operation of State Governments in compiling the<br />
inventory. A sum of $ 2.9 million has been allocated over<br />
three years for the Survey.<br />
Senator Richardson has been asked to undertake a more<br />
general review of existing environmental data bases and<br />
their availability to Commonwealth decision makers and to<br />
advise on action to fill identified gaps.<br />
The Government will also increase environmental expertise of<br />
industry councils and begin a program to enhance community<br />
understanding of conservation issues.<br />
,3568 d. The t<br />
guide claim Mi </p>
<p>0 The three policy principles to be publicly promoted and. used as a<br />
guide to Commonwealth Ministers in resolving. conflicting land use<br />
claimsa are that:-<br />
therb should be an integrated approach to conservation and<br />
development by taking both conservation and development<br />
aspects into account at an early stage;<br />
resource use decisions should seek to optimise the net<br />
benefits to the community from the nation's resources,<br />
having regard to efficiency of resource use, environmental<br />
consideration and an equitable distribution of the return<br />
on resources; and<br />
( iii) Commonwealth decisions, policies and management regimes may<br />
provide for additional uses that are compatible with the<br />
primary purpose values of the area, recognising that in<br />
some cases both conservation and development interests can<br />
C-be accommodated concurrently or sequentially, and, in other<br />
cases-, choices must be made between alternative uses or<br />
combinations of uses.<br />
