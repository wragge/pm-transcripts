PRIME MINISTER<br />
21 OCTOBER 1985<br />
FOLLOWING IS THE TEXT OF THE AGREEMENT REACHED AT TH4E NASSAU CHOGM<br />
ON SOUTH AFRICA, ENTITLED ' SOUTHERN AFRICA THE COMMONWEALTH<br />
ACCORD-. SOIIH AFRICA<br />
1HE COMMONWEALTH ACCORD ( UNDERI. JNrf))<br />
WE CONSIDER THAT SOLITH AFRICA'S CONTINIIJN(; RF-FII5I TO DISMANTLE<br />
APARTHEID, ITS ILLEGAL. OCCUPATION OF NAMIFrA, AND 17. s A;, RESSIOt,<br />
AGAINST ITS NEIGHBOURS CONSTITUTE A SERIOLIS CHALI.. ENGL TO THE VAILUES<br />
AND PRINCIPLES OF THE COMMONWEALTH, A CHALLENGE WHICH COMMONWEALT'H<br />
COUNTRIES CANNOT IGNORE. AT NEW DELHI WE EXPRSSED THE VIEW THAT<br />
"-ONLY THE ERADICATION OF APARTHEID AND THE E.,' IABLISHMENT OF MAJORITY<br />
RULE ON THE BASIS OF FREE AND FAIR EXERCISE O1" UNIVERSAL ADULT<br />
SUFFRAGE BY ALL THE PEOPLE IN A UNITED AND NON-FRAGMENTED SOUTH<br />
AFRICA CAN LEAD TO A JUST AND LASTING SOI. UTION OF THE EXPLOSIVE<br />
SITUATION PREVAIlING IN SOUTHERN AFRICA.'' WE ARE UNITED IN THE<br />
BELIEF THAT RELIANCE ON THE RANGE OF PRESSURES ADOPTED SO FAR HAS NOT<br />
RESULTED IN THE FUNDAMENTA. CHANGES WE HAVE SOUGHT OVER MANY YEARS.<br />
THE GROWING CRISIS AND INTENSIFIED REPRESSION IN SOUTH AFRICA MEAN<br />
THAT APARTHEID MUST BE DISMANTLED tJOW IF A GREATER TRAGEDY IS TO BE<br />
AVERTED AND THAT CONCERTED PRESSURE MUST BE BROUGHT TO BEAR TO<br />
ACHIEVE THAT END. WE CONSIDER THAT THE SITUATION CALLS FOR URGENT<br />
PRACTICAL. STEPS.<br />
2. WE, THEREFORE, CALL ON THE AUTHORITIES IN PRETORIA FOR THE<br />
FOLLOWING STEPS TO BE TAKEN IN A GENUINE MANNER AND AS A MATTER OF<br />
URGENCY: A. DECLARE THAT THE SYTEM OF APARTHEID WILL BE DISMANTLED AND<br />
SPECIFIC AND MEANINGFUL ACTION TAKEN IN FULFILMENT OF THAT INTENT.<br />
B. TERMINATE THE EXISTING STATE OF EMERGENCY.<br />
C. RELEASE IMMEDIATELY AND UNCONDITIONALLY NELSON MANDELA AND ALL<br />
OTHERS IMPRISONED AND DETAINED FOR THEIR OPPOSITION TO APARTHEID.<br />
0. ESTABLISH POLITICAL FREEDOM AND SPECIFICALLY LIFT THE EXISTING BAN<br />
ON THE AFRICAN NATIONAL CONGRESS AND OTHER POLITICAL PARTIES.<br />
E. INITIATE, IN THE CONTEXT OF A SUSPENSION OF VIOLENCE ON ALL<br />
SIDES, A PROCESS OF DIALOGUE ACROSS LINES OF COLOUR, POLITICS AND<br />
RELIGION, WITH A VIEW TO ESTABLISHING A NON-RACIAL AND REPRESENTATIVE<br />
GOVERNMENT. </p>
<p>3. WE HAVE AGREED ON A NUMBER OF MEASURES WHICH HAVE AS THEIR<br />
RATIONALE IMPRESSING ON THE AUTHORITIES IN PRETORIA'THE COMPELLING<br />
URGENCY OF DISMANTLING APARTHEID AND ERECTING THE STRUCTURES OF<br />
DEMOCRACY IN SOUTH AFRICA. THE LATTER, IN PARTICULAR, DEMANDS A<br />
PROCESS OF DIALOGUE INVOLVING THE TRIE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE<br />
MAJORITY BLACK POPULATION OF SOUTH AFRICA. WE BELIEVE THAT WE MUST DO<br />
ALL WE CAN TO ASSIST THAT PROCESS, WHILE RECOGNISING THAT THE FORMS<br />
OF POLITICAL SETTLEMENT IN SOUTH AFRICA ARE FOR THE PEOPLE OF THAT<br />
COUNTRY ALL THE PEOPLE TO DETERMINE.<br />
4. TO THIS END, WE HAVE DECIDED TO ESTABLISH A SHALL GROUP OF EMINENT<br />
COMMONWEALTH PERSONS TO ENCOURAGE THROUGH ALL PRACTICABLE WAYS THE<br />
EVOLUTION OF THAT NECESSARY PROCESS OF POLITICAL DIALOGUE. WE ARE NOT<br />
UNMINDFUL OF THE DIFFICULTIES SUCH AN EFFORT WILL ENCOUNTER,<br />
INCLUDING THE POSSIBLITY OF INITIAL REJECTION BY THE SOUTH AFRICAN<br />
AUTHORITIES, BUT, WE BE[ IEVE IT TO BE OUR DUTY TO LEAVE NOTHING<br />
UNDONE THAT MIGHT CONTRIBUTE TO PEACEFIL CHANGE IN SOUTH AFRICA AND<br />
AVOID THE DREADFUL PROSPECT OF VIOLENI CONFLICT THAT LOOMS OVER SOUTH<br />
AFRICA, THREATENING PEOPI. E OF ALL RACES IN THE COUNTRY, AND THE PEACE<br />
AND STABILITY OF THE ENTIRE SOITiERN AFRICA REGION.<br />
WE ARE ASKING THE PRESIDFNT OF ZAM[: IA AND THE PRIME MINISTERS OF<br />
AUSTRALIA, BAHAMAS, CANADA, INDIA, THF UNITED KINGDOM AND ZIMBABWE TO<br />
DEVELOP WITH THF SECRETARY. GENERA: 7I1F hODALITIES OF THIS EFFORT TO<br />
ASSIST THE PROCESS OF POLITICAI DIILOGFl IN 50LITH AFRICA. WE WOULD<br />
LOOK TO THE GROUP OF EMINENT PER!' ON!; TO SEEN TO FACILITATE THE<br />
PROCESSES OF DIALOGIJ REFERRrD TO IN PARAGRAPH 7( E) ASOVE AND BY ALL<br />
PRACTICABLE MEANS TO A) V~ tfCE THlE FULFILMENT OF THE OBJECTIVES OF THIS<br />
ACCORD. FOR OUR PART, WE HAVE AS AN EARNEST OF OUR OPPOSITION TO APARTHEID<br />
REACHED ACCORD ON A PROGRAMME OF COMMON ACTION AS FOLLOWS:<br />
I) WE DECLARE THE COMMONWEALTH'S SUPPORT FOR THE STRICTEST<br />
ENFORCEMENT OF THE MANDATORY ARMS EMBARGO AGAINST SOUTH AFRICA, IN<br />
ACCORDANCE WITH UN SECURITY COUNCIL RESOLTIONS 418 AND 558 AND COMMIT<br />
OURSELVES TO PROSECUTE VIOLATORS TO THE FULLEST EXTENT OF THE LAW.,<br />
II) WE REAFFIRM THE GLENEAGLES DECLARATION OF 1977, WHICH CALLED<br />
UPON COMMONWEALTH MEMBERS TO TAKE EVERY PRACTICAL STEP TO DISCOURAGE<br />
SPORTING CONTACTS WITH SOUTH AFRICA.,<br />
III) WE AGREE UPON, AND COMMEND 10 OTHER GOVERNMENTS, THE ADOPTION<br />
OF THE FOLLOWING FURTHER ECONOMIC MEASURES AGAINST SOUTH AFRICA,<br />
WHICH HAVE ALREADY BEEN ADOPTED BY A NUMBER OF MEMBER COUNTRIES:<br />
CA) A BAN ON ALL NEW GOVERNMENT LOANS TO THE GOVERNMENT OF<br />
SOUTH AFRICA AND ITS AGENCIES.,<br />
A READINESS TO TAKE UNILATERALLY WHAT ACTION MAY BE<br />
POSSIBLE TO PRECLUDE THF IMPORT OF KRUGERRANDS.,<br />
NO GOVERNMENT FUNDING FOR TRADE MISSIONS TO SOUTH AFRICA<br />
OR FOR PARTICIPATION IN EXHIBITIONS AND TRADE FAIRS IN<br />
SOUTH AFRICA.,<br />
A BAN ON THE SAI. E AND EXPORT OF COMPUTER EQUIPMENT CAIIAF-E<br />

GOODS, MATERIALS AND 7ECHNOLOUY TO SOtlJH AFRICA.,<br />
A BAN ON THE SALE AND EXPORT OF OIL 70 SOUTH AFRICA.,<br />
A STRICT AND RIGOROUSLY CONTROLLED EMBARGO ON IMPORTS<br />

AN EMBARGO ON ALL MILITARY CO OPLRA'rION WlIII SOUII4i AFRICA.<br />
AND DISCOURAGEMENT OF ALL CULTURAL AND SCIENTIFIC EVENTS<br />
EXCEPT UHERE THESE CONTRIIJUTE TOWARDS THE ENDING OF<br />
APARTHEID OR HAVE NO POSSIBLE ROLE IN PROMOTING IT.<br />
7. IT IS OUR HOPE THAT THE PROCESS AND MEASURES WE HAVE AGREED UPON<br />
WILL HELP TO BRING ABOUT CONCRETFE PROGRESS5 TOWARDS THE OBJECTIVES<br />
STATED ABOVE IN SIX MONTHS. THE HEADS OF GOVERNMENT MENTIONED IN<br />
PARAGRAPH 5 AflOVE, OR THEIR REPRFSENTATIVES, WILL THEN MEET TO REVIEW<br />
THE SITUATION. IF ItN THEIR OPINION ADEQUATE PROGRESS HAS NOT BEEN<br />
MADE WITHIN THIS PERIOD, WE AGREE T0 CONSIDER T14E ADOPTION OF FURTHER<br />
MEASURES. SOME OF US WOULD, IN THAT EVENT, CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING<br />
STEPS AMONG OTHERS:<br />
A. A BAN ON AIR LINRI wini SOUTH AFRICA.,<br />
B. A BAN ON NEW INVESTMENl OR I( INVF'; TMENT Or PROFITS<br />
EARNED IN SOUTH1 AFRICA.,<br />
C. A BAN ON THF* IMPORT OF AGRICUILTUJRAL PRODUCTS FROM<br />
SOUTH AFRICA.,<br />
D. THE TERMINATION OF DOIlBI F TAXATION AGREEMENTS WITH<br />
SOUTH AFRICA.<br />
E. THE TERMlNATION OF ALI GOVERNMENT ASSISTANCE TO<br />
INVESTMENT IN, AND TRADE WITH, SOUTH AFRICA.,<br />
F. A BAN ON ALL GOVERNMENT PROCUREMENT IN SOUTH AFRICA.,<br />
G. A BAN ON GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS WITH MAJORITY OWNED SOUTH<br />
AFRICAN COMPANIES.,<br />
H. A BAN ON THE PROMOTION OF TOURISM TO SOUTH AFRICA.<br />
8. FINALLY, WE AGREE THAT SHOULD ALL OF THE ABOVE MEASURES FAIL TO<br />
PRODUCE THE DESIRED RESULTS WITHIN A REASONABLE PERIOD, FURTHER<br />
EFFECTIVE MEASURES WIL. L HAVE TO BE CONSIDERED. MANY OF US HAVE<br />
EITHER TAKEN OR ARE PREPARED TO TAKE MEASURES WHICH GO BEYOND THOSE<br />
LISTED ABOVE, AND EACH OF US WILL PURSUE THE OBJECTIVES OF THIS<br />
ACCORD IN ALL THE WAYS AND THROUGH ALI APPROPRIATE FORA OPEN TO US.<br />
WE BELIEVE, HOWEVER, THAT IN PURSUING THIS PROGRAMME JOINTL. Y, WE<br />
I ENLARGE THE PROSPECTS OF AN ORDERLY TRANSITION TO SOCIAL, ECONOMIC<br />
AND POLITICAL JUSTICE IN SOUTH AFRICA AND PEACE AND STABILITY IN THE<br />
SOUTHERN AFRICA REGION AS A WHOLE.<br />
ENDS </p>
