SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER,<br />
THE HON.. E. G. WHITLAM, M. P.,<br />
TO THE WORLD ASSEMBLY OF WAR VETERANS IN AUSTRALIA,<br />
SYDNEY OPERA HOUSE, 11 AUGUST 1975<br />
I welcome on behalf of the Australian Government<br />
the overseas delegates to this important assembly. Among<br />
you are distinguished war veterans; many of you are renowned<br />
for acts of conspicuous valour in the field or as prisoners of<br />
war. It is an honour to have you among us. Your presence<br />
is a reminder of the great world-wide fraternity of<br />
ex-servicemen the universal kinship between men and women<br />
who have fought for their country in war. Every nation recognises<br />
an obligation to its war veterans. Australia accepts and<br />
honours that obligation.<br />
This is an appropriate moment and an appropriate<br />
gathering at which to reflect on some of the great contemporary<br />
issues of peace and war issues that concern you as former<br />
servicemen and as responsible citizens of your countries.<br />
Last week saw the thirtieth anniversary of the end of World<br />
War 11. In the same week the heads of the European and North<br />
American powers met in Helsinki to acknowledge formally the<br />
realities of power in Europe and consolidate the basis of a<br />
lasting peace. That meeting was part of the great international<br />
movement of detente a movement that remains the supreme<br />
challenge to modern statesmanship. Australia must lend her<br />
voice to this movement. Australia must be part of this<br />
worldwide quest for peace and international understanding.<br />
. It has not always been easy for ex-servicemen' s<br />
organisations to support these causes wholeheartedly. As an<br />
ex-servicemen, as a member of the R. S. L. for the past 30 years,<br />
I admire the efforts of the league to improve the welfare<br />
of ex-servicemen and encourage the spirit of comradeship between<br />
men and women who have served their country. Yet all too rarely<br />
the sentiments and options of the R. S. L. strike a chord with<br />
contemporary generations. Too often the R. S. L. seems out of<br />
step; too often its public statements strike a note of<br />
intolerance, of fanaticism. While Brezhnev and Ford were<br />
meeting in Helsinki, what did we hear and read last week<br />
in Sydney? the slogans of the fifties, the catchcries of<br />
cold war ideology. The week before in another capital a<br />
State Premier was advocating the acquisition of nuclear<br />
weapons and guided missiles. It takes a brave man to query<br />
fading slogans. But there have been brave men. Three years<br />
ago at the New South Wales R. S. L. Congress the Governor,<br />
Sir Roden Cutler, challenged the approach to Vietnam<br />
and a decade before the Governor-General, Viscount De L'Isle, V. C.,<br />
warned the National Congress on Cold War attitudes. The R. S. L.<br />
must bring its influence and prestige to bear in a relevant and<br />
constructive examination of the problems of peace and security.<br />
Too often the younger generation likens the R. S. L. smoko, which<br />
all of our generation enjoy, to Alexander's Feast, at which the<br />
King in his cups Grew vain,<br />
Fought all his battles o'er again,<br />
And thrice he routed all his foes<br />
And thrice he slew the slain. </p>
<p>This year has seen the end of a long and terrible<br />
war in Asia, a war that devastated a large part of our region<br />
and baffled and demoralised the greatest democracy on earth.<br />
The full consequences of the war its full cost in terms<br />
of human life, material destruction, world inflation, shattered<br />
morale, lost faith and broken ideals will perhaps never<br />
be known. Perhaps the most evil consequence of Vietnam has<br />
been a general disillusionment with democratic governments.<br />
People are no longer disposed to believe what their governments<br />
tell them. They are quite ready to believe that Governments<br />
will lie and deceive their people when it suits them. The<br />
necessary trust between governments and governed has been<br />
undermined. The most urgent task for democracy is to rebuild<br />
that trust in a geniune search for peace and human betterment.<br />
And what R. S. L. leader was right on Vietnam?<br />
Above all, we must not waste the opportunity<br />
for peaceful reconstruction and international cooperation<br />
which is now presented to the nations of South-East Asia,<br />
including Australia. Opportunities for peace in the region<br />
have been tragically wasted before; they must not be wasted<br />
again. To say this is not to belittle the sacrifice and<br />
courage of those who fought in Vietnam. To honour our war<br />
dead, it is not necessary to approve of the conflicts in which<br />
they took part. The frank acknowledgement of our past mistakes<br />
and the greater those mistakes the franker and fuller that<br />
acknowledgement must be is the first step to greater wisdom<br />
and security. At the root of the whole ghastly malaise in<br />
Vietnam, the whole tragic and futile struggle, was the<br />
absence of any basic popular conviction that war was just.<br />
The people did not believe in the war. The people of the<br />
United States did not support it. The people of Australia<br />
did not support it. And the people were right.<br />
I believe the chief lesson of Vietnam has been<br />
that no longer will it be possible for governments to fight a<br />
war successfully without the broad support of their people.<br />
There is no longer any automatic or slavish patriotism among<br />
our people. Some may find this unpalatable or shocking;<br />
others may see it as a mark of enlightienment. The fact remains<br />
that the days have passed when any war could be relied upon<br />
to bring an instantaneous surge of national fervour. It was<br />
possible once to depend on such feelings in Australia. When<br />
Australia was founded half the population was in uniform.<br />
We were settled by the Royal Navy and a contingent of troops.<br />
Australians fought in every war in which Britain was engaged,<br />
up to and including the Malaysian campaign. Their first<br />
expedition was to the Sudan 90 years ago; it embarked a few<br />
hundred metres from where we are meeting. It was only in the<br />
last decade that Australians fought overseas without British<br />
troops beside them. The imperial connection which was the root<br />
of our former patriotism is no longer sufficient to stir us.<br />
The sending of a few battalions to Vietnam can no longer provoke<br />
the automatic popular response, the unquestioning commitment,<br />
that prevailed during the Boer War, for example, or during<br />
World War 1 or 11. No one doubts that we were right to fight<br />
Hitler and Tojo, but can the same be said of the earlier wars<br />
in which Australia took part? From our present vantage point<br />
the horrors of World War 1 are difficult to explain and<br />
impossible to justify. I shall have the same difficulty in </p>
<p>3.<br />
justifying it to my grandson as Kaspar had in justifying<br />
Blenheim: " And everybody praised the Duke<br />
Who this great fight did win."<br />
" But what good came of it at last?"<br />
Quoth little Peterkin.<br />
" Why that I cannot tell," said he,<br />
" But -' twas a famous victory."<br />
Apart from a few isolated incidents, the Australian<br />
population has never experienced the horrors of war as the<br />
civilian populations of Britain, Japan and the European<br />
countries have done. The rigours of war have fallen on our<br />
warriors alone. It is only recently through television<br />
that we have seen in Vietnam what war means to a whole<br />
population. It is perhaps for this reason that the anti-war<br />
movement, the general revulsion against war as an instrument<br />
of policy, has been-slower to take root in this country<br />
than it has abroad. It is perhaps for this reason that<br />
bellicose sentiments and cold war thinking have survived longer<br />
in Australia, as they have in the United States, whose<br />
civilian population has also been spared the devastation of modern<br />
warfare. Our isolation has compounded these effects in<br />
another way. As a result of the last war we embarked on a<br />
vast program of immigration. In the first years of that<br />
program many new citizens came here as refugees from Europe.<br />
Many of those who came from the countries of eastern Europe<br />
are inclined to think that those countries are the same as<br />
they were before the war. They are reluctant to accept<br />
the realities of the post-war world; they go on believing<br />
that the old regimes will somehow be restored. In the case<br />
of Yugoslavia, for example, this obsession has persuaded a<br />
sizable minority of new Australians to get together and<br />
venerate our enemies in the last war. By extolling the<br />
Ustasha and the quisling Pavelic they advocate the<br />
dismemberment today as they did in 1941 of the only nation<br />
on the continent of Europe which had declared itself our<br />
ally. It is an utter disgrace that a regime accepted<br />
internationally a nation visited by President Ford and<br />
the Queen should be vilified by a minority of agitators<br />
in Australia. After Helsinki, does anyone really believe<br />
that the situation in Europe will be changed by military<br />
means or that the old regimes in Europe can be restored?<br />
Our true interests lie in putting an end to<br />
these obsessions with the past, in recognising the new<br />
realities in our region and in the world at large, and in<br />
developing humane and rational policies for peace and<br />
international cooperation. These should be the concerns of<br />
all progressive and contemporary ex-servicemen's organisations.<br />
I pay tribute to the R. S. L. in promoting the welfare of<br />
ex-servicemen and serving members of the forces. My own<br />
Government has done a great deal in this field. Indeed<br />
there is some irony in the fact that Australians with active<br />
overseas service have been treated somewhat differently from 4 </p>
<p>4.<br />
other Australians in the provision of government services.<br />
Under our Federal system, the national Government has been<br />
able to provide for servicemen and ex-servicemen such things<br />
as health services, housing and adult training services<br />
-that governments have failed or refused to provide for the<br />
rest of the population. There is certainly a role for ex-servicemen's<br />
organisations in looking after their members' interests.<br />
There is a role for ex-servicemen's organisations as<br />
concerned observers of the nation's defences. But let<br />
this role be discharged in honest and constructive terms.<br />
Let it take account of the realities of the world and the<br />
aspirations of people everywhere for true peace and progress.<br />
For who can doubt -that the world has changed<br />
permanently in the last quarter of a century? For all<br />
our present anxieties. and immense problems, who can doubt that<br />
the world is a safer place than it was at the time of<br />
Berlin, of Korea, of Cuba? For the first time in nearly<br />
years no member of the Australian armed forces is fighting<br />
in an overseas war. No Australian is on active service. The<br />
gates of the temple of Janus are closed. The comparative<br />
peace we now enjoy in our region and the comparative peace<br />
we enjoy in the wider world should renew our determination to<br />
preserve and strengthen peace everywhere. Ex-servicemen's<br />
organisations must lend their support to this process.<br />
In the presence and as the host of the most distinguished<br />
and representative gathering of ex-servicemen in this<br />
country the R. S. L. can make its contribution and bring<br />
inspiration to this noble endeavour. </p>
