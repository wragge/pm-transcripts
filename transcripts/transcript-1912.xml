01 CZECHOSLOVAKIA_<br />
COMMENTS BY THE PRIME MINISTER, MR JOHN GORTON<br />
FEOLR EISINANRADIO 22 AUGUST 1968<br />
I want to talk to you tonight about a matter which, though<br />
it does not immediately impinge on the Australian people yet is of great<br />
moment to them and to other free peoples throughout the world.<br />
At approximately eight o'clock yesterday morning, Canberra<br />
time, large forces of Russian troops, together with forces from other<br />
satellite nations crossed the borders of Czechoslovakia in force against<br />
the wishes of the Czechoslovakian Government and while most of the<br />
citizens of Czechoslovakia were asleep. By the time morning came, they<br />
were in military occupation of the country.<br />
The Russian Charg6 d'Affaires called on me this morning<br />
in order to present me a message, the gravamen of which was that<br />
these Russian troops and other troops had entered Czechoslovakia at the<br />
request of the Czechoslovakian Government.<br />
On behalf of the Australian Government, I informed him<br />
that I found this impossible to believe, and impossible to believe<br />
particularly in view of the protests of the Czech Foreign Minister and<br />
of the broadcasts from Prague indicating clearly, before the broadcasting<br />
station was overrun, that this invasion was against the wishes of the legal<br />
Czechoslovakian Government.<br />
I said that I beliewd that the Australian Parliament and the<br />
Australian people would share my disbelief. I asked him to convey to the<br />
Russian Government this feeling on behalf of my Government, and I asked<br />
him also to express to the Russian Government the distress and the<br />
revulsion which my Government felt at -this action by the U. S. S. R.<br />
This, I was told, is the message that would b. e conveyed.<br />
The Parliament of Australia will be debating this matter<br />
tonight, and while a Parliamentary motion may be a frail weapon to set<br />
against the tanks and tommy-guns of the invaders, nevertheless, there<br />
has been a message from the Parliament of Czechoslovakia before it<br />
was overthrown, asking for the mobilisation of support from parliaments<br />
and peoples throughout the rest of the world. This we are trying to do.<br />
NOTE: The PM undertoolk this recording at the request of TV<br />
and radio stations, to provide them with the substance<br />
of his comments in Parliament this morning. </p>
