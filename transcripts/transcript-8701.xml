PRIMIE MIMISTER 113/ 92<br />
JOINT STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON<br />
P J KEATING MP, AND THE MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND<br />
TRADE SENATOR THE lION GARETHT EVANS<br />
GRANT FOR YOTHU YINDI'S UNITED NATIONS CONCERT<br />
A $ 30,000 grant from the cultural relations program of the Department of Foreign<br />
Affairs and Trade will enable Aboriginal rock group, Yothu Yindi, to help launch the<br />
United Nations International Year of the World's Indigenous People ( YWIP) at a<br />
concert in New York in December.<br />
Yothu Yindi will be on a North American tour at the time and the grant covers the<br />
extra cost of enabling them to stay on for the UN appearance in New York on<br />
December. We believe this is a practical means of showing the Government's support for<br />
Aboriginal rights and recognition and appreciation of Aboriginal culture.<br />
It will also expose a representative world-wide audience to the uniqueness of Yothu<br />
Yindi which incorporates traditional Aboriginal values in a modem musical idiom.<br />
Yothu Yindi will perform their hit single " Treaty" as well as other songs from their<br />
1992 album " Tribal Voice" which has won many awards including the Human Rights<br />
Commission Award for Songwriting and the Australasian Performing Rights<br />
Association's Award for " Song of the Year".<br />
The Prime Minister has written to all Ministcrs in regard to the IYWIP, asking them to<br />
identify ways in which their portfolios can mark the year and provide specific funding<br />
for IYWIP activities. He has also written to all Premiers, Chief Ministers and the<br />
Australian Local Government Association, inviting them to join with the<br />
Commonwealth in celebrating the year, and seeking their co-operation in making the<br />
year another one of real achievement on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander issues.<br />
NOTE FOR EDITORS: There will be a photo opportunity when the Prime Minister,<br />
Mr Keating, meets members of Yothu Yindi at Kirribilli House today ( Sunday,<br />
October) at 3: 15 pm.<br />
CANBERRA October 1992 </p>
