    <content><![CDATA[<p>Andrew Southcott has been a fine contributor to the Parliament and to our Party Room.</p>
<p>Andrew was first elected to Parliament in 1996.</p>
<p>For nearly two decades, he’s been a hardworking and effective local member, consistently delivering for the people of Boothby. The establishment of the Flinders Centre for Innovation in Cancer in his electorate, for example, was one of Andrew’s finest local achievements.</p>
<p>As a Shadow frontbencher, he took up the fight against Labor’s wasteful GP Super Clinics and was a staunch defender of the private health insurance rebate and the private health insurance industry more generally.</p>
<p>As Chair of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, Andrew chaired hearings into Australia’s Free Trade Agreement with the United States. This landmark economic agreement entered into force during Andrew’s Chairmanship of the Committee. </p>
<p>Andrew Southcott was also one of the original architects of Pollie Pedal. It was in his office that the idea of a charity bike ride first took shape. This year marked the 18th year of the event, which has raised more than $4.5 million for many good causes.</p>
<p>Andrew has indicated that he intends to return to medical practice.</p>
<p>I wish him all the best as he continues to serve his community.</p>
