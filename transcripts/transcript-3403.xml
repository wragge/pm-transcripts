PRESS STATEMENT<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister<br />
The Hon. E. G. Whitlam, Q. C. M. P.<br />
Change in the Exchange Rate<br />
of the Australian Dollar<br />
The Australian dollar will be devalued by<br />
12 per cent as from 6.00 the Prime Minister<br />
announced today. The initial rate against the US dollar<br />
will be $ A1 $ US1.3090.<br />
The fixed link to the US dollar will be<br />
discontinued. In future the exchange rate for the<br />
Australian dollar will be determined by changes in an<br />
average of foreign currency values weighted in accordance<br />
with trading significance to Australia. This means that<br />
the rate for the Australian dollar will tend to vary<br />
from day to day against all currencies including the<br />
US dollar, in a manner which will maintain constant<br />
the weighted average exchange value.<br />
When the Government came into office it was<br />
faced with a situation of high and growing international<br />
reserves and an excessive level of domestic liquidity<br />
giving rise to strong inflationary pressures. In these<br />
circumstances it was appropriate to appreciate the<br />
Australian dollar and the Government had acted to do so<br />
by 7.05 per cent within weeks of taking office in<br />
December 1972. In September 1973 a further appreciation of<br />
per cent was undertaken. Since that time there had<br />
been a further effective appreciation of' the Australian<br />
dollar of about 51-per cent as a result of the rise in<br />
value of the US dollar against other currencies, taken </p>
<p>2<br />
as a whole. The Prime Minister said that in 1973/ 74<br />
the Australian economy had benefitted from the rising<br />
international value of the Australian dollar. As the<br />
Treasurer had said in his Budget Speech, nearly one-half<br />
of the increase in demand in 1973/ 74 had been satisfied<br />
by the increase in imports which had been induced by this<br />
amongst other measures.<br />
It had been appropriate to appreciate the<br />
Australian dollar when reserves were excessive and a<br />
boom in demand was over-straining domestic resources. It<br />
is now appropriate, in the light of the changed outlook<br />
for the balance of payments and the slow-down in the<br />
domestic economy, to depreciate.<br />
The Prime Minister emphasised that the<br />
depreciation will give a fillip to many domestic<br />
industries. Export industries, such as the rural and<br />
mining industries and manufacturing exporters, will<br />
benefit particularly, as will those sectors of industry<br />
experiencing undue pressure from import competition.<br />
In these ways the devaluation will have beneficial<br />
effects on the climate in which business operates. It<br />
will thercby assist in restoring the general level of<br />
ousiness activity and in the maintenance of employment<br />
) portunities. If unchecked, unemployment could destroy<br />
the efforts which the Government is making in co-operation<br />
with unions, employers and State Governments to reduce<br />
inflation. While some increase in costs of a number of<br />
import items will probably result from this move, it is<br />
essential, if inflation is to be overcome in Australia, </p>
<p>-3-<br />
that conditions be created which are favourable to<br />
continued economic growth and full and effective use<br />
of Australian resources.<br />
