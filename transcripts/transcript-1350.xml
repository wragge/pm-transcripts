ADDRLES BY THE ACTING . PRIME-MINISTER,<br />
MINISTER FOR TRADE AND INDUSTRY,<br />
AND LEADER OF THE AUSTRALIAN COUNTRY PARTY,<br />
MR.. JOHN McEWEN,<br />
AT' THE FIRST ANNUAL MEETING OF THE<br />
CANBERRA-QUEANBEYAN BRANCH OF THE. COUNTRY PARTY,<br />
CANBERRA, 6TH JULY, 1966<br />
The Country Party took shap. as a political entity<br />
separately in all the States at about the time of the First War.<br />
It had different names in the different States. It was. sAme little<br />
time. before the State organisations composed a Federation.<br />
Organisationally the Party is still a federation of State<br />
entities. Federal policy is..-composed by a Federal Council with a<br />
membership from all the State : organisations and the Federal<br />
Parliamentary Party.<br />
In due course a common name was adopted: " Tho Australian<br />
Country Party"; and the branch formed. here to-night will be a unit<br />
of the N. S. W. Branch of the Australian Country Party.<br />
Unduubtedly the Party in its formative years was composed<br />
primarily cf farmers concerned with policies cnn. erning the interests<br />
of farmers and their export industries,<br />
If anyone said that the Country Party was founded on a<br />
narrow sectinnal basis 50 years ago, I would not dispute that, but<br />
wauld quickly point out that the economic health of this country<br />
then, as nnw, is inseparable from the existence of healthy expanding<br />
export industries tr earn the foreign , xchange to scrvice our national<br />
growth. It was founded as a Specialist party. It has grown to<br />
broad national stature without losing its 6apacity for specialist<br />
attention to the wll--being nf the rural industries..<br />
All that was 50 years ago.<br />
Australia itself is not recognisablo as a nation to-day<br />
Qomparcd with the Dominion of Australia of 50 years. ago. And as<br />
Australia has grown and broadened, so the Country Party has grown<br />
and broadened over the same perind.<br />
I believe that many who are attracted to the Country Party<br />
here to-night, and widely around Australia, are attracted because<br />
the policies of the Party are so singularly for the growth and<br />
strength of the Australian . economy, and peoplo.<br />
Fifty years ago the terms " farm-products'' t-and -" export<br />
industries" were synonymous. </p>
<p>We have grown with a consciousness that the self-interest<br />
of the person engaged in the export industry coincided completely<br />
with the self-interest of the nation, always avid to earn the maximum<br />
foreign exchange. Constantly increasing prodiution of new wealth is<br />
tho most essential foundation from which to apply other political<br />
policies. The dlearly growing coales6ence between the farm Gxport<br />
industries and non-farm export industries has been a most natural<br />
development. The basic political philosophy of the Country Party has<br />
always been attached to the concept of free 4nterprise and against<br />
Socialist doctrines. This is the Gommon ground which places the<br />
Country Party so constantly in alliance with the Liberal Party.<br />
On the other hand, the Country Party has always wanted<br />
the fruits of productive labour to go to the maximum extent to the<br />
producer, and this explains the almost identity of interest between<br />
the Country Party and the great Co-operative Groups which now handle<br />
so much of production.<br />
The concept of retaining strength in the hand of the<br />
beller by combination is expressed in many different forms, but the<br />
objective is constant: dairyfarmers or fruitgrowers combined to<br />
establish a dairy factory or a fruit cannery to handle their own<br />
produce a purely private arrangement. The sugar growers and the<br />
wheatgrowers found it necessary for Governments and Legislation to<br />
aid in their co-operative activities. The motive of retaining the<br />
maximum value of production to the producer is the same.<br />
This leads through to the whole complex of statutory<br />
marketing boards or regulatory boards.<br />
That is a glimpse of the Country Party's historic part in<br />
attending to the well-being of primary producers. The Country Party<br />
still slaims the specialist knowledge in this field. But, standing<br />
further back from the picture, one discovers the extent to which<br />
the Country Party has broadened its objertives as Australia has grown<br />
and as our circumstances have (, hanged.<br />
We have always been strong for adequate defence provisions;<br />
f) r close co-operation with Britain, and natural allies. Our growth,<br />
the diminution of British strength, the shift from Europe. alone as<br />
the possible source nf war to include Asia in this threat, the<br />
emergence of Communist. strength on the one hand and American might<br />
cn the other hand have all Gontributed -to progressive broadening<br />
of Coutntry Party policies. </p>
<p>-I<br />
( f a </p>
<p>To-day, the Country Party abandons nothing of its<br />
specialist field in relation to the rural sector, but plays an<br />
increasingly broad and leading part in propounding policies for<br />
the growth and strength of the Australian nation.<br />
We support policies of alliances for military strength;<br />
of better educatign and health services; better . ommunity services<br />
generally; of full emplbyment and adequate so6ial services. But,<br />
being fundamentalists at heart, we are firm in the belief that all<br />
these poli&amp; ies are only attainable in strength if two ossential<br />
ingredients exist: first, a growing population, and secondly, a<br />
smfficient foreign exchange earning to servic-e our requirements and<br />
our ambitions. I place it as broadly as that: growing population,<br />
migration, are mere words without job creation. Job creati-n is<br />
synonymous with developing industrialisation, which leads in turn<br />
to growing tertiary activity.<br />
No ambitions in this direction can live without sufficient<br />
foreign exehange earning, and here the farm industries are still the<br />
backbone. Primary industry still earns more than 80% ) f our total<br />
foreign exchange and is key to a healthy growing national economy.<br />
Name any single aspect of policy and the Country Party<br />
will relate it to its position in respect of strong industrial growth,<br />
strong capacity to earn foreign exchange.<br />
I have pointed out again and again that superficially there<br />
could appear to be a contradiction between fast industrial growth,<br />
which undoubtedly impscs a pressure on costs, and strong growth for<br />
export, which, to be competitive, requires costs to be kept within<br />
bounds. This is a problem, not a contradiction.<br />
No one can contemplate an Australia prodominantly composed<br />
of farmers, even if operating from a low-cost base, nor &amp; an anyono<br />
contemplate an Australia highly industrialised with the foreign<br />
exchange-earning farmers squeezed out of existence. We have to<br />
reconcile this problem.<br />
We have to grow without stultifying the farm community,<br />
and the Country Party believes that supporting fast economic growth<br />
as it does it is entitled in equity to policies which will<br />
compensate for the cost pressures imposed on the export industries.<br />
And, quite apart from the argument of equity, I point out that there<br />
is no future for the country if it fails to earn sufficient foreign<br />
exchange. In 1919 we might have resisted, and probably did, industrial<br />
development which would impese cost pressurps. To-day the Country<br />
Party sees clearly that industrial development must go on, and </p>
<p>prc'poses constructive policies designed to compens-ate the export<br />
industries for the added costs and to enable them to survive and<br />
expand. The greatest single point of Country Party policy here is<br />
that of support for the scientist and technologist and extension<br />
worker; to help the wheatgrower, or dairyfarmer, or wool producer,<br />
to bear heavier cash costs and yet experience lower unit costs by<br />
doubling the number of sheep carried on an acre or the amount of beef<br />
produced; doubling the amount of sugar produced per acre; getting<br />
the wheat yield up, and the fruit yield up, and so on. Success in<br />
this direction is the predominant explanation of rural industries'<br />
ability to survive in a phase of growing cash costs: a 60% increase<br />
in total agricultural production during the period of this Government<br />
with a diminution of the rural workforce of 10% in the same period.<br />
This efficiency has been the major offset to cash cost increasos.<br />
There is, of course, a total complex of other policy itemshome<br />
prices, a lower bank overdraft rate for the export industries;<br />
a greater access to credit; a preferred access to credit; a number<br />
of taxation concessions; a fertilizer subsidy; concessions in<br />
freight rates; a search for markets overseas, trade treaties, trade<br />
publicity; international commodity arrangements, special bulk sales.<br />
Increasingly, policies of the same character are now being<br />
devised to aid the export of manufactured products: payroll tax<br />
rebate; the underwriting of overseas investment made in the course<br />
of securing market opportunities; the highly specialised insurance<br />
provision of the Export Payments Insurance Corporation. These steps<br />
supporting manufacture at export are comparable in Country Party<br />
thinking with the objectives in mind when a fertilizer bounty is<br />
provided, or a trade promotional campaign mounted.<br />
From the fast-growing economic strength of the country,<br />
which has been supported by these policies, we are now able to<br />
afford what w,, ould hitherto have appeared prodigious expenditures<br />
rn defence, enormous allocations for social services, and for<br />
education, and to help the State Governments; and for special<br />
activities for Northern Development, such as funds provided for<br />
the Ord, for brigalow clearing, beef roads, and very substantial<br />
expenditure in Papua-New Guinea of taxation raised in Australia.<br />
I am quite sure that the Australian Country Party is<br />
broadly respected for the breadth of its policies; respected not<br />
only here in Australia, but respected internationally, where, on<br />
many occasions, ideas that have had their origin in this kind of<br />
thinking are now part of Iinternattlonal -di-scussions and planning. </p>
<p>But, with all the strength that we can muster in our day,<br />
we still need strrnng friends. Our close bonds with the British<br />
people and Commonwealth countries need no documentation. The ANZJS<br />
Treaty with the United States and New Zealand establishes a mutual<br />
alliance between Australia and the world's most powerful military<br />
country to-day.<br />
We expect others to accept it that this enviable oountry<br />
is entitled to be free from aggression, and this must result in us<br />
lending our support to preserving the freedom of other nations against<br />
aggression. This principle and our unbreakable bond with the United<br />
States have combined to lead us to join with the United States in<br />
resisting Communist aggression in South Vietnam. In human and in<br />
international political terms, we are right in joining to protect<br />
this free country fr 2m, Communist aggression. In practical termn, we<br />
are right to keep the frontiers of expansive Communism as far fr'MM<br />
our shores as possible.<br />
In terms of our owm long-term security, the recent<br />
deolaration by Mr. Dean Rusk that any attack upon Australia would<br />
produce a massive American retaliation is the greatest guarantete<br />
mf our safety in a dangerous anorld.<br />
In the.-D policies we and our Liberal coalition partners<br />
hold idcontinal views.<br />
I am confident that the policies cf the Australian Gmntr* y<br />
Party are good both in the specialist sense and, moreAimp~ r-antly,<br />
fomr the over-all well-being f-Autralia. </p>
