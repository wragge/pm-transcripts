EMBARGOED AGAINST<br />
DELIVERY CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER TO THE LEBANESE COMMUNITY,<br />
SYDNEY, 7 NOVEMBER 1984<br />
LADIES AND GENTELMEN<br />
1AM DELIGHTED TO ONCE AGAIN HAVE A14 OPPORTUNI'TY TO BE AMONG<br />
my LEBANESE FRIENDSAS<br />
A GOVERNMEN4T WE HAVE ALWAYS FEL. T THAT THE LEBANESE<br />
COMMUNITY COUNT AMONG THEIR NUMBER SOME OF LABOR'S CLOSEST<br />
FRIENDS AND SUPPORTERS-WE APPRECIATE THISTHE<br />
GOVERNMENT IS ALSO VERY MINDFUL THAT THE LEBANESE<br />
COMMUNITY BRING A PROUD AND RESOLUTE TRADITION To AUSTRALIAN<br />
SOCIETYYOU, MORE THAN MOST, APPRECIATE THAT THERE IS NO FUTURE FOR<br />
THIS COUNTRY IN TRYING TO BUILD OUR SOCIETY AROUND<br />
CONFRONTATIONIST STYLES OF GOVERNMENT.<br />
THE TRAGEDY WHICH HAS BEEN SUFFERED FOR SO LONG AND SO<br />
PAINFULLY BY THE PEOPLE OF LEBANON HAS BEEN DEEPLY ETCHED IN<br />
THE AUSTRALIAN IMAGINATION-</p>
<p>THE LABOR GOVERNMENT AND MY OWN PLNS0ONAL COMMITMENT, TO<br />
SECURING A PEACEFUL RESOLUTION OF THE CRISIS IN LEBANON IS<br />
WELL KNOWN-WE CONSIDER IT ESSENTIAL THAT THE TROOPS OF ALL<br />
FOREIGN COUNTRIES IN LEBANON SHOULD BE WITHDRAWN. ONLY WHEN<br />
THIS HAPPENS WILL THE PEOPLE OF LEBANON BE ABL!: TO RESUME A<br />
NORMAL AND PEACEFUL LIFE.<br />
YOU KNOW FROM YOUR OWN BITTER EXPERIEINCE THE FUTILITY AND<br />
THE TRAGIC COST OF CONFLICT AND CONFRONTATIONIST STYLES OF<br />
GOVERNMENT. LABOR IN GOVERNMENT HAS FORSWORN SUCH APPROACHES AND HAS<br />
INSTEAD BROUGHT TO THE FORE THE CO-OPERATIVE, HARMONIOUS<br />
INSTINCTS AUSTRALIANS HAVE ALL TOO RARELY BEEN ALLOWED TO<br />
GIVE FULL PLAYUNDER<br />
LABOR ALL AUSTRALIANS ARE WORKING TOGETHER.<br />
ONE OF THE LEBANESE COMMUNITY'S GREAT ACHIEVEMENTS HAS BEEN<br />
THAT, WHILE NEVER FORGETTING YOUR OWN RICH CULTURAL<br />
TRADITIONS, YOU HAVE BECOME IN THE BEST SENSE OF THE TERM<br />
REAL AUSTRALIANS.<br />
INDEED IT IS As AUSTRALIANS THAT I WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK TO<br />
f'OU TONIGHT. </p>
<p>FOR ALL AUSTRALIANS THE GREAT ISSUE OF THE: DAY, THE MATTER<br />
CLOSEST TO THE EVERYDAY CONCERNS OF ALL 01: US, MUST BE THE<br />
ECONOMY. IN THE LIGHT OF THE LONG AND PROUD HISTOPICAL INVOLVEMENT OF<br />
THE LEBANESE PEOPLE WITH COMMERCE AND TRADE, AND INDEED IN<br />
CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE THE LEBANESE COMMUNITY COUNTS AMONG ITS<br />
N4UMBER SOME OF AUSTRALIA' S MOST SUCCEISSFUL BUSINESSMEN, I AM<br />
SUR~ E YOU WOULD ALL BE CONSCIOS OF THE NEED TO CONDUCT<br />
ECONOMIC POLICY IN A WAY WHICH WILL ALLOW OUR BUSINESS<br />
COMMUNITY TO PROSPER AND EXPAND.<br />
IT IS ONLY THROUGH EXPANSION OF THE PRIVATE SECTOR THAT WE<br />
WILL BE ABLE TO CREATE JOBS IN THE NUMBERS WHICH AUSTRALIANS<br />
DESIRE AND DESERVETHE<br />
BUSINESS SECTOR KNOWS THAT IT HAS NOTHING TO FEAR FROM A<br />
LABOR GOVERNMENT. INDEE'D IT KN4OWS THAT OUR POLICIES ARE<br />
COURAGEOUS, FAR SIGHTED, PRODUCTIVE AND IN THE BEST<br />
INTERESTS OF ALL AUSTRALIANS. GONE ARE THE DAYS OF<br />
DIVISIVENESS AND DISCORD WHEN GOVERNMENT SOUGHT TO PIT<br />
WORKERS AGAINST THEIR EMPLOYER'; AND USED BANKRUPTCY AND<br />
UNEMPLOYMENT TO ACHIEVE POLICY OBJECTIVES. THIS GOVERNMENT<br />
IS A GOVERNMENT OF CONSENSUS; OF RECONCILIATION; AND OF<br />
NATIONAL RECONSTRUCTION-</p>
<p>THE GOVERNMENT MADE ITS APPROACH PLi'. IN AT THE NATIONAL<br />
Ecor~ oMIc SUMMIT CONFERENCE LAST YEAR.<br />
WE REALISED THEN THAT CHANGES WERLE REQUIRED TO MODERNISE<br />
AUSTRALIA'IS INDUSTRIAL STRUCTURE;' TO END THE SENSELESS<br />
SQUABBLES BETWEEN EMPLOYERS AND EMPLOYEES OVER THE<br />
DISTRIBUTION OF THE NATION'IS WEALTH;' AND TO PUT ECONOMIC<br />
POLICIES IN PLACE WHICH WOULD GET AUSTRALIA MOVING AGAIN.<br />
WE CAME TO OFFICE WITH A PROGRAM OF ACTION TO ACHIEVE THOSE<br />
ENDSBUT WE DID NOT SET ABOUT SEEKING SIMPLY TO IMPOSE OUR WILL<br />
ON THE COMMUNITY. THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN A RECIPE: FOR MORE<br />
DISCORD;' MORE UNCERTAINTY;' MORE DELAY BEFORE DESIRABLE<br />
CHANGES COULD BE IMPLEMENTED;' MORE UN4EMPLOYMENT AND<br />
INFLATION-INSTEAD WE SET ABOUT PROVIDING A STEADY AND<br />
PREDICTABLE POLICY ENVIRONMENTBy<br />
fTS ACTIONS THE GOVERNMENT HAS DEMONSTRATED THAT IT<br />
SUPPORTS AND ENCOURAGES A HEALTHY BUSINESS SECTOR-OUR<br />
COHERENT ECONOMIC STRATEGY:<br />
HAS BEEN A KEY FACTOR IN THE STRENGTH OF ECONOMIC<br />
RECOVERY'<br />
HAS PROVIDED A STABLE AND PREDICTABLE ENVIRONMENT IN<br />
WHICH BUSINESS CAN PLAN AHEAD. ON THE BASIS OF<br />
PREDICTABLE COST INCREASES;' </p>
<p>HAS POSITIVELY ENCOURAGED BUS11NESS iNVESTMENT INCLUDING<br />
THROUGH MEASURES INTRODUcED IN THE BUDGET; AND<br />
HAS INVOLVED BUSINESS AS AN ESSENTIAL CONTRIBUTOR IN<br />
THE PROCESS OF CONSULTATION ON GOVERNMcNT POLICYPRIOR<br />
TO THE GOVERNMENT COMI1NG TO OFFICE, THE ECONOMY HAD<br />
BEEN SHRINKING, THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE HAD RISEN TO A LEVEL<br />
NOT SEEN SINCE THE DEPRESSION, OUR RATE OF INFLATION WAS<br />
AROUND TWICE THAT OF OUR TRADING PARTNERS, CONSUMER<br />
CONFIDEN4CE HAD PLUMMETED. THE BUSINESS TRADING ENVIRONMENT<br />
WAS HIGHLY UNCERTAIN AND BUSINESS CONFIDENCE WEAK.<br />
SINCE THEN THE SITUATION HAS DRAMATICALLY IMPROVED.<br />
CONFIDENCE HAS BEEN RESTORED-WE HAVE BEGUN TO MAP OUT A<br />
PROCESS OF MANAGED AND MEASURED STRUCTURAL CHANGE. ECONOMIC<br />
RECOVERY HAS BEGUN INDEED. REAL GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT<br />
DURING THE LAST FINANCIAL YEAR GREW BY I-0 PER CENT AND THIS<br />
GROWTH WAS BROADLY BASED-SOME 264,000 NEW JOBS HAVE BEEN<br />
CREATED, AND THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE HAS FALLEN FROM 10.2 PER<br />
CENT IN APRIL LAST YEAR To 8.8 PER CENTAT<br />
THE SAME TIME AS ACHIEVING THIS, WE HAVE ALSO SEEN<br />
THE ANNUAL INFLATION RATE MORE THAN HALVED TO THE POINT THAT<br />
ICAN CONFIDENTLY SAY TO YOU THAT DURING THE CURRENT<br />
FINANCIAL YEAR IT WILL BE LESS THAN 5 PER CENT-</p>
<p>AT THE SAML TIME INDUST~
LOWEST ANNUAL LEVEL SINCE 1969, INTEREST RATES HAVE FALLEN<br />
SIGNIFICANTLY, AND THE I5UDGET DEFICIT HAS BEEN REDUCED<br />
SUBSTANTIALLY. ALL OF THIS HAS BEEN ACHIEVED AT THE SAME<br />
TIML AS PROVIDING MOST WAGE EARNERS WITH A TAX CUT OF $ 7.60<br />
A WEEK I1N THE 1984-85 BUDGET, AND PUTTING IN PLACE A NUMBER<br />
OF NOTEWORTHY PROGRAMS AIMED AT ASSISTING THE NEEDYUNLIKE<br />
THE PROSPECT WHEN THE GOVERNMENT TOOK OFFICE, ALL<br />
AUSTRALIANS CAN LOOK FORWARD WITH CONFIDENCE TO THE FUTURETHE<br />
ECONOMY IS FORECAST TO GROW IN REAL TERMS AT AROUND 4 TO<br />
PER CENT THIS FINAN4CIAL YEAR, WITH A FURTHER INCREASE IN<br />
EMPLOYMENT OF MORE THAN 2 PER CENT-INFLATION WILL REMAIN<br />
UNDER CONTROL, AT VERY LOW LEVELS COMPARED TO THE PERIOD<br />
BEFORE WE TOOK OFFICEALLOWING<br />
FOR SEASONAL INFLUENCES CONSUMER CONFIDENCE IS<br />
POSSIBLY AT ITS HIGHEST EVER RECORDED LEVEL. A~ ND BUSINESS,<br />
RES. PONDING TO THE IMPROVEMENT IN THE ECONOMY, IS<br />
DEMONSTRATING ITS CONFIDENCE IN THE FUTURE BY INCREASING<br />
INVESTMENTAS A RESULT OF THE SUCCESS OF THE GOVERNMENT'IS POLICIES,<br />
PARTICULARLY THE PRICES AND INCOMES POLICY, THERE HAS BEEN A<br />
DRAMATIC TURNAROUND IN4 BUSINESS PROFITABILITY-INDEED, THE<br />
SHARE OF COMPANY INCOME IN THE NATIONAL INCOME IS<br />
APPROACHING LEVELS NOT SEEN SINCE THE LATE SIXTIES AND EARLY<br />
SEVENTIES-</p>
<p>THE REAL COST OF EMPLOYING LABOUR PER UNIT OF OUTPUT HAS<br />
FALLEN SUBSTANTIALLY AND IS NOW AT THE LEVEL OF THE EARLY<br />
i970s. IN SHORT THE GOVERNMENT ATTACHES GREAT IMPORTANCE TO HAVING<br />
A STRONG AND PROFITABLE AUSTRALIAN BUSINESS SECTOR. ONLY<br />
WITH THIS CAN WE HOPE TO MAXIMISE AUSTRALIA'S LONG-TERM<br />
GROWTH POTENTIAL AND RESTORE PROSPERITY TO OUR COUNTRY.<br />
WE STILL HAVE MUCH TO DO IN THIS REGARD. SUBSTANTIAL<br />
ECONOMIC PROBLEMS STILL REMAIN. THE DEPRESSING COSTS OF<br />
HIGH UNEMPLOYMENT CONTINUE TO BE INFLICTED ON TOO MANY<br />
AUSTRALIANSHOWEVER, WITH THE SUCCES OF THE GOVERNMENT'S POLICIES THUS<br />
FAR, AND WITH YOUR CONTRIBUTION AND THAT OF THE REST OF THE<br />
COMMUNITY, INCLUDING THAT OF THE TRADE UNION MOVEMENT, WE<br />
CAN ALL FACE THE FUTURE WITH CONFIDENCE.<br />
THANK YOUL </p>
