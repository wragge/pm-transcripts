<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>First today in our Sydney studio the Prime Minister. Mr Howard, good</p>
<p> morning.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Good morning Neil.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>It's confirmed that you are going to open the Olympic Games,</p>
<p> what are you going to say?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>What people normally say and it's very brief. I just declare</p>
<p> them open and sit down and let the competition begin.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>It's quite an honour.</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes, it is.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Well, why do you think it is appropriate for the Prime Minister rather</p>
<p> than the head of State?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, we argued it ought to be the Prime Minister when Paul Keating</p>
<p> was the Prime Minister and John Hewson was the leader of the Opposition.</p>
<p> I felt that as the most high profile elected Australian figure the</p>
<p> Prime Minister was the appropriate person to do it. But these things</p>
<p> are not a matter of personal view. I was advocating this before I</p>
<p> was Prime Minister and frankly at a time when my prospects of ever</p>
<p> becoming Prime Minister were about one in 100.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>What are your prospects of being Prime Minister by the time the Olympics</p>
<p> come?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh, a lot better than one in a 100, mate.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>We'll take some calls for the Prime Minister. Mr Howard, GST.</p>
<p> I am getting a lot of letters from people who have got detailed figures</p>
<p> and arguments showing that they will be worse off, but you say nobody</p>
<p> will be worse off. Will you increase compensation?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, we are going to obviously look at whether there's a need</p>
<p> for fine-tuning as I have called it. Our argument has been that the</p>
<p> compensation elements of the package are fair and comprehensive and</p>
<p> we don't believe all the Senate investigations have demonstrated</p>
<p> that any group on any reasonable assumption is going to be worse off.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Senator Harradine's talking about a lot more than fine-tuning</p>
<p> though isn't he?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, he made a speech and I have read that speech and....</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Well, what do you think?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I am interested in the fact that he didn't say outright</p>
<p> that food should be excluded. I understand the enormous store that</p>
<p> he's always placed on fairer tax deals for families. There is</p>
<p> huge increases in the benefits for families under the existing package.</p>
<p> I think the most sensible thing I can do is to state the obvious and</p>
<p> that is that the Government is looking carefully at what Senator Harradine</p>
<p> had to say. We would like his support, we would like Senator Colstons's</p>
<p> support. It is only through getting the support of those two men that</p>
<p> we can hope to get this package through before the 30th</p>
<p> of June. Look, everybody knows that and there is no point in mincing</p>
<p> words about that.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>But is Senator Harradine talking about fine-tuning or is he talking</p>
<p> about significant change?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>If I want Senator Harradine's support on this the best thing</p>
<p> I can do is talk directly to him for there to be direct discussions.</p>
<p> Clearly I will be talking to him, clearly the Treasurer will be talking</p>
<p> to him and you will understand my saying at this stage that there's</p>
<p> nothing to be gained in my publicly speculating about exactly what</p>
<p> Senator Harradine wants or exactly how we might respond to it.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Okay. Do you accept, and I am sure you are getting similar messages,</p>
<p> do you accept that a lot of people particularly pensioners and self-funded</p>
<p> retirees are, after doing the figures, are convinced they will be</p>
<p> worse off?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, some people may believe they are and a lot of that could be</p>
<p> due to a misunderstanding of the benefits that are really available.</p>
<p> And every situation is different but I'd say again that every</p>
<p> pension and every benefit is increased by not only the consumer price</p>
<p> impact effect of the GST but also an additional 1.5 per cent. And</p>
<p> yet on top of that there are tax cuts, any self-funded retirees who</p>
<p> pays tax will benefit through the tax cuts. In addition to self-funded</p>
<p> retirees over the age of 60 there is a saving bonus and there is an</p>
<p> additional one for pensioners as well as self-funded retirees. There's</p>
<p> an increase in the pensioner tax rebate, there's an increase</p>
<p> in the free earnings area. There's been an increase in the tax</p>
<p> rebate for private health insurance. That's already come in,</p>
<p> that's of enormous benefit to lots of retired people. I guess</p>
<p> in a situation like this if people have particular examples, and I</p>
<p> say this very genuinely to your listeners, if they do want to send</p>
<p> them to me we'll try and respond to them. It's very hard</p>
<p> in a programme like this with the best will in the world to do other</p>
<p> than to state the generic position as to an individual's position</p>
<p> it will depend on a lot of things. It will depend, for example, on</p>
<p> whether a self-funded retiree has got a small share portfolio. If</p>
<p> that is the case there's a thing called the imputation credit.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Oh yes, well most of the letters I am getting they have factored in</p>
<p> all those things. That's a good idea if people want to send letters</p>
<p> into.....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Provisional tax gets abolished.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Is food non-negotiable too?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Totally non-negotiable?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Absolutely. And the reason that it's not negotiable is that if</p>
<p> you take food out you are really in the long run giving a much greater</p>
<p> benefit to high income earners because there are an enormous....there's</p>
<p> a lot of evidence suggesting that high income earners spend up to</p>
<p> twice as much on food as low income people.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Why the delay by the way, I thought you were anxious to get this through?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, the Democrats weren't ready to resume the debate. And we</p>
<p> wanted to go ahead today, I mean, it'll be up to the Senate but</p>
<p> whether it votes for the debate to be resumed today but the Government,</p>
<p> so I am told by my Senate colleagues, is ready to resume today and</p>
<p> we want it to go ahead today.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, the....and I've seen you describe this the other</p>
<p> day as a growth tax for the States, I saw you, I think it was with</p>
<p> Laurie Oakes the other day, saying it will grow $15 to $20 billion</p>
<p> a year for the States, is that right?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, the amount involved, it will grow to that figure if I said a</p>
<p> year then that was...</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>[Inaudible]</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>A slip. It'll grow to abut 15 Â 20, perhaps a bit more,</p>
<p> it's a bit hard to estimate. I have been told by the Treasury</p>
<p> that by the year 2005 the States will be $2.9 billion better off than</p>
<p> they would have been if the old system, that's the present system,</p>
<p> had continued.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>And that's with all the State taxes that we know about gone?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>All of that yes, that's right. They'll still be $2.9 billion</p>
<p> better off than they would have been under the present system.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Does that include stamp duty on non-residential deals, conveyancing?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>The stamp duty on...well, that's going to be subject to a</p>
<p> phasing arrangement and I would expect that it would have been gone</p>
<p> in all States by then.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>I've just got in front of me the inter-governmental agreement.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yeah, there's a phasing arrangement in relation to that.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Yeah but looking at the figures here, it says after the abolition</p>
<p> of non-residential conveyancing, by 2005/6 $1.5 billion. Your $3 billion,</p>
<p> which is $2.859 billion is if that non-residential tax stays in.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I think that's just in relation to the stamp duty, not in</p>
<p> relation to all of the revenue.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>No, no, but does the stamp duty have to stay in for you to reach the</p>
<p> $3 billion?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>The stamp duty, well, it's not a question of whether it has to</p>
<p> stay in or out, it's a question that under the transitional arrangement</p>
<p> stamp duty will, that non-residential stamp duty will be progressively</p>
<p> eliminated and what I'm saying is that when the transitional</p>
<p> arrangement has finished and the full benefit of the GST clicks in</p>
<p> the States will be $2.9 billion better off and then that will grow.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Yes but that would be after the abolition of the non-residential.....?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>That's what I'm saying, these figures that I've got</p>
<p> in front of me say that if that...after the abolition it's</p>
<p> down to $1.1 billion. Before the abolition it's $2.8 billion.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes, but have you factored in the growth?</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I don't know that....</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>2005/6.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes but the residential...the agreement you've got in front</p>
<p> of me, I'm not sure that we're comparing apples with apples.</p>
<p> I think you're talking about the revenue yields from particular</p>
<p> taxes rather than the extra money the States will get under the GST</p>
<p> over and above the amount they would have got under the existing financial</p>
<p> agreements and their own...under the existing financial agreements.</p>
<p> I think we're talking about different things.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Could you stand by that $3 billion by that time....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, the figure that I stand by, and it's a figure that's</p>
<p> been given to me by the Treasury is that the States will, by the year</p>
<p> 2005, under the new arrangement, that's after the transitional</p>
<p> period, will under the GST be $2.9 billion better off than they would</p>
<p> have been if the existing Commonwealth/State financial arrangement</p>
<p> had continued.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Okay. So that's with all those taxes coming off.....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, no. They're effectively getting $2.9 billion more from the</p>
<p> Commonwealth than they would have got under the old arrangements.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>So are they going to be better off.....by the time they take of</p>
<p> all these....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes. Well that's the advice that I've been given yes.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Including this non-residential....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I'm not, I mean I have to say I'm not entirely certain.</p>
<p> I think we are at cross-purposes there. They're going to be better</p>
<p> off to that effect.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Okay. I guess that the underlying thing point that would alter the</p>
<p> credibility of this claim is that the GST is a growth tax. That the</p>
<p> growth tax goes to the States. If they get all their....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh look, the condition is that they abolish a designated number of</p>
<p> State taxes and that's the deal. When the thing fully clicks</p>
<p> in those State taxes including the non-residential stamp duty which</p>
<p> is going to be progressively abolished, that will go, the stamp duty</p>
<p> on shares will go, the stamp duty on promisary notes will go, and</p>
<p> that would be replaced by a GST. Now every State acknowledges that</p>
<p> it will be better off under the GST. That's why they signed the</p>
<p> agreement.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>On the way I read things the GST is not the main growth component</p>
<p> of the tax. I mean you're talking about $25 billion, extrapolating</p>
<p> $25 billion. Only $8 billion of that was the GST and the rest of it</p>
<p> is, on the figures I've seen, is non-residential....</p>
<p>No. I think we are looking at two separate sets of figures. I think</p>
<p> we really are at cross purposes. I'm talking about the fact that</p>
<p> once the GST is fully operative, once all the State taxes have been</p>
<p> abolished, all of the revenue from the GST, that is the 10% collected</p>
<p> all around the country, all of that goes to the States.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>And leaves them...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, by 2005 they'll be $3 billion better off than they are</p>
<p> under the existing arrangements.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>[Inaudible]</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, they don't get the GST unless they do that.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Okay. We'll take a call on this, oh sorry, on the GST not on</p>
<p> this, it's a bit complex. Peter, hello, go ahead.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>Yes, good morning Neil, good morning Mr Howard.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Good morning.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>I have one question. Not all self-funded retirees are over 60, there's</p>
<p> a lot that have been, sort of, retrenched or companies being taken</p>
<p> over. And they may be 50 with a small retirement [inaudible] so they</p>
<p> have got a little bit of investments, they're not on the pension,</p>
<p> what's in it for someone between 50 and 60 that is, sort of,</p>
<p> just keeping their head above water with their investments but they're</p>
<p> not getting a pension? That's where they are, they are in the</p>
<p> middle, do you understand?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I do.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>But they don't seem to be getting any benefit out of this.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, would the person you have in mind, would that person be earning</p>
<p> more than $5,400 a year?</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, they get a tax cut because the tax free threshold rises from</p>
<p> $5,400 to $6,000. In addition, over the $6,000 the bottom tax rate</p>
<p> falls from 20 per cent to 17 per cent and at every step the personal</p>
<p> tax rate is lower. Now, I think in relation to the self-funded retirees</p>
<p> it should be borne in mind that if they are paying tax, and most of</p>
<p> them are, then they get personal tax cuts as part of the plan so that</p>
<p> the impact of the GST is matched or more than matched by the value</p>
<p> of the personal tax cuts.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>The Retired Persons' association estimates 5.1% is needed rather</p>
<p> than your four percent compensation. Will that be looked at?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I'd like to see the basis of that calculation. Once again,</p>
<p> without going over old ground, and the analysis before the Senate</p>
<p> inquiry didn't really punch too much of a hole, or any hole really</p>
<p> in our arguments about compensation. I mean people got into arguments</p>
<p> about other things, but Neil Warren in the end did say on any plausible</p>
<p> assumption I can't say that a particular group is worse off.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Michelle, go ahead please.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, I have a larger than average family.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>How many children? Eight. Good.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>Eight, from 11 to four months.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Terrific.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>You were saying before that the cost of the food, the food aspect</p>
<p> of the GST it's the higher income people that spend more money</p>
<p> on food. What about a lower-middle income?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Do you mind my asking is your total annual income more than $70,000?</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
