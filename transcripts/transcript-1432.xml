NATIONAL JROADCAST NO. 2<br />
BY THE PRIME MINISTER, mR. HAROLD HOLT<br />
The Policy Speech made last night oy Mr. Calwell<br />
exposes fundamental differences of attitude between the<br />
Government and Opposition. The choice you will make is not<br />
simply a choice between leaders of different personality<br />
or etvween parties which would maintain the same steady course<br />
for Australia, but differ on some significant points of detail.<br />
The issues go much deeper than that.<br />
Each side has stated its view of kustralia's external<br />
security. Each has now stated what it would propose to do<br />
in the field of domestic security.<br />
-e of the Government Parties see the menace of<br />
iggressive Asian-based Communism as the treatest threat to<br />
the security of our part of the world and to the way of life<br />
we wish to live.<br />
M'e have joined with others in the S -TO and ANZUS<br />
Ireaties for our mutual protection. The added strength we<br />
obtain carries a price of oblization on our part. That is one<br />
reason why we are in South Vietnam.<br />
The Labor Party pays lip-service to treaty obligations<br />
but it declares for a course which would undermine them.<br />
It would withdraw all Australian troops from South Vietnam.<br />
The damage this would do to our relations with the United<br />
States the greatest free power in the world and the one<br />
most capable of assuring our security cannot be measured<br />
but undoubtedly this relationship would be gravely weakened.<br />
.' hen it comes to internal security we also see the<br />
forward prospect in fundamentally different terms.<br />
The Government and its supporters believe that better<br />
living standards will flow from a strengthenin-economy<br />
soundly based and directed to the well-oeing of all sections.<br />
Mr. Calwell thinks that improved standards will flow<br />
from greatly increased expenditures on social welfare with<br />
little, if any, regard to the way in which these are to be<br />
financed. From an earlier carefully documented statement made<br />
before the election campaign was launched, Ir. Calwell<br />
estimated his election undertakings to cost ' 300 million.<br />
. e can now see that this is only a fraction of the total<br />
bill. It is more likely to be closer to treble to the<br />
amount he stated.<br />
He has offered a programme so comprehensive and<br />
so costly that the general reaction has been one of derision.<br />
This general reaction was well expressed in the " Sydney<br />
. orning Herald" Leader it oegan " It must oe said at<br />
once that Mr. Cal-. ell's Policy Speech is far, far worse than<br />
anyone could have feared. It is a monument of irresponsibility,<br />
an irresponsibility which applies almost equally to the </p>
<p>-2-<br />
whole range of his proposals."<br />
After deglin, critically with the external aspects,<br />
the paper commented under the heading " Fantastic Promises"<br />
that economically speaking this isThe most irresponsible<br />
Policy Speech Mr. Calwell -s ever made. The same paper's<br />
Finance Editor wrote " ie have never seen a list of<br />
promises like this. If Mr. Cal'cwell's previous election<br />
platforms were extravagant, this one is delirious."<br />
Fost thoughtful people will share that verdict.<br />
It is unthinkable that a country progressing so well<br />
and fortified by its alliances should now by its free<br />
democratic vote, hand itself over to a political leader and<br />
party so lacking in realism.<br />
