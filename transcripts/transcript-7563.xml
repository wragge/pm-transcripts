PARLIAMENTARY STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
ADMINISTRATION OF ABORIGINAL AFFAIRS<br />
11 APRIL 1989<br />
Honourable members will recall that in November last year<br />
the Government announced a number of inter-related inquiries<br />
into the administration of Aboriginal affairs.<br />
The background to the establishment of these inquiries was<br />
material provided and statements made in Senate Estimates<br />
Committee processes, and elsewhere, alleging serious<br />
shortcomings in the administration, including financial<br />
management, in the Aboriginal Development Commission and in<br />
the Department of Aboriginal Affairs.<br />
The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs announced in this<br />
Chamber on 7 November 1988 that he had asked the<br />
Auditor-General to undertake a comprehensive audit of the<br />
Aboriginal Development Commission and to extend this, as<br />
appropriate,. to the Department of Aboriginal Affairs. He<br />
announced also that the Public Service Commissioner would be<br />
investigating questions concerning personnel management in<br />
the Department of Aboriginal Affairs and that the Department<br />
of Finance would investigate any staff classification<br />
issues. Furthermore, he announced that the Government recognised<br />
that certain matters might still require further examination<br />
in the light of these specialised investigations and that<br />
the Government had asked Mr Andrew Menzies, AM, OBE, a<br />
former Deputy Secretary of the Attorney-General's<br />
Department, to make any such inquiry.<br />
The Auditor-General and the Public Service Commissioner are,<br />
of course, independent statutory officers, and the<br />
Government made clear that Mr Menzies would also be<br />
exercising an independent role in following up any<br />
outstanding matters.<br />
The Government also made it clear that each of these<br />
inquiries should be as thorough as those conducting them<br />
judged necessary.<br />
It was the Government's intention from the outset that, in<br />
the light of the outcome of these inquiries, it would<br />
consider whatever steps might be necessary to address any<br />
problems brought to light.<br />
I am now able to advise Honourable Members that most of<br />
these various inquiries have been completed. The Public<br />
Service Commissioner and the Department of Finance have<br />
completed their inquiries. moreover, as a result of a<br />
further request from the minister for Aboriginal Affairs to<br />
the Minister for Finance, the Department of Finance has<br />
prepared a broader report on financial management in the<br />
Aboriginal Development Commission. </p>
<p>2.<br />
As Honourable Members already know, the Auditor-General has<br />
completed a substantial part of his remit, with only a<br />
report on some particular enterprise projects in the<br />
Aboriginal Development Commission area which were brought to<br />
notice in the Senate-yet to come.<br />
Mr Menzies has completed an interim report which outlines<br />
the process he is following in his enquiries and the matters<br />
which he has excluded. In particular, he is not<br />
re-examining issues which have been dealt with definitively<br />
by the. Public Service Commissioner, the Department of<br />
Finance or the Auditor-General in their reports.<br />
Mr Menzies has identified two issues in the<br />
Auditor-General's report which have not been or are not<br />
being dealt with to finality by the Auditor-General and<br />
which Mr Menzies sees as appropriate for his investigation.<br />
He indicates that these two matters are under active<br />
investigation, together with a comparatively small number of<br />
matters arising from submissions received from the public or<br />
otherwise brought to his attention.<br />
Mr Menzies outlines in Part II of his interim report the<br />
matters under investigation but recommends that that part of<br />
the report not be published generally. The Government<br />
accepts his recommendations that, in view of the continuing<br />
investigations, Part II should not be published. It has,<br />
however, been made available to the Leader of the<br />
Opposition, the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate and<br />
the Leader of the Australian Democrats.<br />
I make the important point that, pending Mr Menzies, final<br />
report, I shall not comment today upon the conduct of any<br />
individual. Nor should others prejudge the findings..<br />
Attempts to ascribe guilt by allegation or smear are simply<br />
unacceptable. The Government also has, of course, the recommendations and<br />
views of the Senate Select Committee on the Administration<br />
of Aboriginal Affairs.<br />
The Government is confident, therefore, that the primary<br />
issues of administration in the area of Aboriginal affairs<br />
have been covered in all the reports we have now received.<br />
Against this background, I now table in the House all the<br />
reports referred to, excepting the Auditor-General's report<br />
which has already been tabled and Part II of Mr Menzies<br />
report.<br />
With the bulk of the inquiries now completed, the Government<br />
is in a position to inform the Parliament of its views and<br />
intentions concerning organisational arrangements for the<br />
Aboriginal Affairs portfolio on the basis of thorough<br />
consideration of the material now available to us. The<br />
Minister for Aboriginal Affairs will be following me with a<br />
detailed statement concerning these arrangements. </p>
<p>The Government, of course, stands ready to refine its<br />
response, and undertake any further action, should that be<br />
necessary, when the remaining reports are received. They<br />
will, of course, also be tabled in the Parliament.<br />
Madam Speaker,<br />
At the outset it needs to be acknowledged that<br />
administrative shortcomings, some of them serious, are<br />
evident in the area of Aboriginal administration. The<br />
Government does not sweep aside these shortcomings nor will<br />
we shirk our responsibility to correct them.<br />
In the case of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs, the<br />
Auditor-General found that, overall, there was a lower than<br />
acceptable standard of administration. Clearly,<br />
administrative practices in a wide range of areas will have<br />
to be tightened. The Government recognises this, the<br />
Department knows it and some steps have been taken already.<br />
The Department of Finance concluded, in relation to certain<br />
staff classification matters, that the action taken by the<br />
Department was not well founded in terms of classification<br />
principles and processes. Honourable Members should note,<br />
in this regard, that the Department of Aboriginal Affairs<br />
has accepted the Department of Finance's conclusions, and<br />
the necessity of appropriate corrective action.<br />
On the other hand, I believe it is important to note that,<br />
as the Auditor-General's and Public Service Commissioner's<br />
inquiries found, some of the more vocal critics of the<br />
Department were unable to provide evidence to back their<br />
claims.<br />
The Public Service Commissioner has not substantiated<br />
allegations of patronage, favouritism, nepotism and cronyism<br />
in the Department of Aboriginal Affairs. No hard evidence<br />
was produced that would warrant investigation under the<br />
Public Service Act.<br />
The Public Service Commissioner's delegate,<br />
Mr H B MacDonald, found no more than that there was an<br />
occasional lack of prudence or judgement and that there were<br />
some deficiencies in the Department's personnel practices,<br />
most particularly an inordinate delay in approving an equal<br />
employment opportunity program. Mr MacDonald also concluded<br />
that it was essential to clarify the policy guidelines on<br />
Aboriginalisation that is, enhancing access by Aboriginal<br />
and Torres Strait Islander people to employment in the<br />
Department. The much more fundamental problems brought to light in these<br />
inquiries are in the programs administered by the Aboriginal<br />
Development Commission rather than the Department. </p>
<p>The'Special Audit Report's major criticisms are directed at<br />
the way the Aboriginal Development Commission administers<br />
its enterprise funds pointing to a number of failed<br />
enterprises and less than rigorous oversight by the<br />
Commission. In nearly all cases mentioned in the report,<br />
Audit found that the ADC had failed to apply the criteria<br />
set out in its legislation, and concluded that the most<br />
serious defects in administration were in the ADC's approval<br />
procedures. it should also be noted that there are proposals in the<br />
broader Department of Finance report for a strengthening of<br />
administrative support in these areas, and for the exercise<br />
of greater control, through clearer and more specific<br />
ministerially endorsed guidelines.<br />
The Government has taken these findings into account in the<br />
response which I shall outline and on which the Minister's<br />
statement will elaborate.<br />
madam Speaker,<br />
Before outlining the Government's response to the findings<br />
of these inquiries, it is essential that I reaffirm the two<br />
basic principles at stake in this crucial area of government<br />
administration. There is, first, the imperative for self-management, by<br />
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, of Government<br />
programs designed to assist their well-being.<br />
If there is one lesson that emerges from two hundred years<br />
of contact between the original inhabitants of this country<br />
and the Europeans who have arrived since 1788 it is this:<br />
that after all the benign neglect, the paternalism and the<br />
failed attempts at assimilation, we today realise that the<br />
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders themselves are the<br />
best judges of their needs and priorities.<br />
In recent years, the imperative of self-management has<br />
received considerable bipartisan support and it is one to<br />
which this Government has shown its fundamental commitment.<br />
Second, there is the thoroughly complementary imperative for<br />
proper ministerial responsibility and accountability for,<br />
and effective parliamentary scrutiny of, programs as a<br />
whole, especially in relation to their financial<br />
administration. The nub of the issue before us then is finding the right<br />
balance between the principles of self-management and of<br />
overall ministerial responsibility. </p>
<p>many critics including in this House have failed to see<br />
this need for balance. They have drawn the facile<br />
conclusion that answers to the administrative shortcomings<br />
that have been identified, especially in the Aboriginal<br />
Development Commission, lie solely in winding back<br />
self-management.<br />
The Government believes it is possible indeed, it is vital<br />
to strike a better balance; a balance that both widens and<br />
deepens the opportunity for self-management, and establishes<br />
a more appropriate means of financial accountability and<br />
ministerial oversight.<br />
That is precisely what the Government's proposed legislation<br />
for the establishment of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait<br />
Islander Commission seeks to achieve.<br />
It seeks to widen the scope for Aboriginal self-management<br />
to encompass all of the programs undertaken within portfolio<br />
agencies, and to deepen its real effectiveness by giving<br />
Aboriginal people at a regional and local level a far more<br />
specific responsibility to determine priorities and<br />
outcomes. It seeks also to establish the right mechanism for<br />
ministerial involvement which will genuinely uphold the<br />
principle of accountability to the broader Australian<br />
community. I take this opportunity to reaffirm the Government's<br />
determination to proceed with the ATSIC legislation.<br />
Nothing that has emerged from these inquiries has eroded the<br />
Government's fundamental support for the concept and nature<br />
of ATSIC. But we can and will draw on the work of the<br />
Senate Committee and on the inquiries to refine and improve<br />
the details.<br />
In his statement today the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs<br />
will describe the Government's intentions on amendments to<br />
the ATSIC legislation, particularly in the light of the<br />
report of the Senate Select Committee.<br />
I believe it is appropriate in this context to remind<br />
Honourable Members of some of the legislative history of<br />
Aboriginal self-management, and in particular to point out<br />
that the ADC itself was developed, under the previous<br />
Government, with a less than conventional level of<br />
ministerial oversight for a statutory authority.<br />
I begin by quoting the words of Senator Neville Bonner, the<br />
first Aboriginal Member of Parliament, in giving, on behalf<br />
of the previous Government, the second reading speech on the<br />
Aboriginal Development Commission Bill in the Senate on 21<br />
November 1979. </p>
<p>He said, " The Government, in introducing the Aboriginal<br />
Development Commission Bill, is taking steps to put into<br />
effect what I have been saying for a number of years the<br />
placing into Aboriginal hands of the control of Aboriginal<br />
affairs." He went on to say that "..... Aboriginals will be<br />
responsible for the decision making. of course ( he said)<br />
this is not to say that Aboriginals also will not make<br />
mistakes. It is to be expected that we will as we all do.<br />
But Aboriginals should have greater sensitivity to<br />
Aboriginal needs and they will learn from any mistakes they<br />
make while exercising this responsibility".<br />
As Honourable members will know the legislation to establish<br />
the ADC was not actually passed until 1980. The amended<br />
legislation, again in the words of Senator Bonner, was<br />
designed to " strengthen the commitment to self-management"<br />
and to achieve " further steps down the road to making<br />
equality a reality for Aboriginal Australians". He was able<br />
to say that because the weight of the responses to the<br />
original Bill was to reduce the role of the minister and<br />
expand the role of the Commission.<br />
I would also remind Honourable members of some important<br />
points made in that 1980 Senate debate by Senator Chaney,<br />
the then Minister for Aboriginal Affairs.<br />
He said, " there is an element of risk in Aboriginal<br />
self-management. I think it is a risk which both the<br />
previous Government and this Government have seen as a<br />
worthwhile risk".<br />
He also said, " I suggest to those Members of the Opposition<br />
who are concerned, that they look at the limitations of*<br />
ministerial power in this Bill as compared to the Bills that<br />
the opposition when in Government put through the Parliament<br />
in 1974 and 1975.<br />
" I think they will see that we are progressing in the way<br />
that one would expect towards withdrawing ministerial<br />
authority. I do not suggest that the Bills that were passed<br />
in 1974 were wrong for their time. I suggest that, as one<br />
would expect, we are moving in a direction of increasing<br />
Aboriginal control rather than ministerial control".<br />
The significance of this recital of the background to the<br />
ADC is that it shows that both sides of this Parliament have<br />
made, and welcomed, moves to give Aboriginals a greater say<br />
in the design and delivery of programs to advance their<br />
status in Australian society. we all have been prepared to<br />
accept what Senator Chaney termed " an element of risk".<br />
In reaffirming my Government's support for ATSIC, I make the<br />
point that, given this legislative history, the proposed new<br />
Commission is the logical and appropriate next step for the<br />
advancement of both the great principles of self-management<br />
and ministerial accountability. </p>
<p>Not only do the reports of the inquiries not undermine the<br />
Government's belief that ATSIC represents the correct way<br />
forward we are encouraged by some of the positive<br />
implications for ATSIC's basic structure in the inquiry<br />
reports. For example, the Special Audit Report illustrates the<br />
problems which can arise when one agency, the Aboriginal<br />
Development Commission, confuses its activities in<br />
enterprise funding with its own wider socio-economic<br />
responsibilities, and those of other agencies. It also<br />
points up some difficulties the Department of Aboriginal<br />
Affairs has experienced in providing a balanced range of<br />
services to communities in response to their expressed<br />
needs.<br />
While the Report does not draw any conclusion, the<br />
Government notes that such problems as these would be<br />
reduced by bringing the full range of programs under a<br />
single administration, by eliminating the potential for<br />
overlap, and by planning systematically on the basis of<br />
communities' and regions' own priorities.<br />
At the same time, the Government accepts that it cannot<br />
proceed with these changes without addressing as effectively<br />
as possible the administrative shortcomings brought to light<br />
in the various inquiries, and the need for accountability<br />
and appropriate ministerial involvement and parliamentary<br />
scrutiny. The Government had already, in the development of the ATSIC<br />
Bill, sought to provide for greater ministerial involvement<br />
through the Minister being able to establish guidelines<br />
within which the new body would be required to operate in<br />
the administration of policies and programs, and being<br />
closely involved in the monitoring of priority setting<br />
through approval of estimates on a regional basis. These<br />
controls are designed to prevent the possibility of any<br />
radical departures from the approved estimates and policy<br />
goals. Honourable Members will note that the Department of Finance<br />
report tabled today recommends that the Minister should be<br />
given a broad role to approve the estimates of the<br />
Aboriginal Development Commission; should consult on the<br />
Commission's corporate plan; and should issue broad policy<br />
guidelines, especially where financial administration is<br />
concerned. The ATSIC legislation which the Government is proposing will<br />
meet those requirements.<br />
We have, moreover, considered to what extent the thrust of<br />
those recommendations should apply to the ADC while it<br />
continues to function in the lead up to ATSIC, as the<br />
Minister for Aboriginal Affairs will indicate in his<br />
statement. </p>
<p>Also relevant is the recommendation made by the<br />
Auditor-General that the Government review the business<br />
enterprise provisions in the ATSIC Bill. The Government has<br />
done so and a more detailed statement covering its<br />
consideration of both the general financial accountability<br />
and business enterprise provisions of the Bill will be made<br />
by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs.<br />
The Government has also determined that it will respond to<br />
the problems raised in the various inquiry reports, and to<br />
the suggestions made by the Public Service Commissioner for<br />
strengthened support, in the following ways.<br />
We will amend the ATSIC legislation to establish an Office<br />
of Evaluation and Audit, details of which will be provided<br />
in the Minister's statement.<br />
We will ensure that there are adequate resources provided to<br />
the new Commission to enable these audit and reporting<br />
functions to be carried out effectively.<br />
We will make sure that there are sufficient resources,<br />
including for training and by way of a temporary infusion of<br />
specialist managerial skills, for the new Commission. The<br />
Public Service Commissioner's reports pointed to the need<br />
for better training and improved management practices, and<br />
the Department of Aboriginal Affairs is discussing with the<br />
Public Service Commissioner the best way to implement those<br />
recommendations in the Department as it is now. Dr McIver,<br />
in her report last year, as consultant on the new<br />
Commission's staffing and administrative structure, also<br />
concluded that a very active staff development program would<br />
be vital in the Commission's early days.<br />
Because the reports have highlighted the need for training<br />
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people who work in<br />
community organisations, if they are to function with proper<br />
financial management, the Government will look to how it can<br />
intensify its efforts under the Aboriginal Organisations<br />
Training Program.<br />
More immediately, the Government recognises the need to<br />
spell out and clarify the policy of Aboriginalisation for<br />
specific staffing positions concerned with formulation of<br />
policy for, and direct delivery of services to, Aboriginals,<br />
especially within the Department of Aboriginal Affairs and<br />
the new Commission.<br />
We will require relevant Commonwealth agencies to establish<br />
in consultation with the Public Service Commissioner and<br />
relevant unions policy guidelines on enhancing access by<br />
Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders to employment, and<br />
that appropriate equal employment opportunity plans be in<br />
place on the establishment of ATSIC. </p>
<p>9.<br />
Madam Speaker,<br />
It would not be appropriate to conclude this statement<br />
without making mention of those many people whose diligence<br />
and commitment to the cause of the Aboriginal people cannot<br />
be questioned.<br />
The efforts of so many of these Australians, Aboriginal and<br />
non-Aboriginal alike including those in the Department of<br />
Aboriginal Affairs and the Aboriginal Development Commission<br />
are beyond the demands of duty.<br />
Indeed, some of the shortcomings that have been identified<br />
have arisen, not from base motives, but from a genuine<br />
determination to overcome the appalling disadvantage<br />
suffered by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.<br />
It is as a result of those efforts, over very many years,<br />
that Government-sponsored programs are, gradually, improving<br />
the health, housing, education and employment of Aboriginal<br />
Australians and are, steadily, strengthening Aboriginal<br />
communities through land rights, through enterprise<br />
development, and through the provision of services to<br />
improve basic living conditions.<br />
My Government is proud that, in recognition of this vitally<br />
important work, we have continued to make substantial real<br />
increases in allocations to Aboriginal programs in an era<br />
when it has been necessary to wind back the growth in<br />
overall Commonwealth expenditure.<br />
The inquiries have submitted the administration of<br />
Aboriginal Affairs to an extraordinarily detailed scrutiny<br />
and produced a wealth of material and analysis in a<br />
relatively short time frame. The Government appreciates the<br />
effort of all of the agencies and people involved, and I<br />
take this opportunity to thank them for it.<br />
Surely the time has now come, especially in this Parliament,<br />
to cease the constant stream of allegation which has dogged<br />
this vital area of government administration.<br />
The Government's approach is, as I have indicated, to draw<br />
upon the lessons from the inquiries and to look to the<br />
future to ensure that mechanisms are put in place and<br />
support provided so that future administration is on a sound<br />
footing. We are determined to address administrative<br />
problems in a way which ensures a higher quality of future<br />
administration in this very important area of government<br />
and, in the long run, a higher quality of life and sense of<br />
belonging for all Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander<br />
people. </p>
