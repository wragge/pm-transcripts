22 June 1973<br />
FILM AND TELEVISION SCHOOL<br />
The Prime Minister, Mr. Whitlam, today announced the<br />
names of those invited to join the permanent Council of the Film<br />
and Television School.<br />
The Prime Minister said that the Interim Council of<br />
the Film and Television School had been set up in 1969 to<br />
advise the Government on the necessary steps to bring the<br />
School into operation. This work had now been done and<br />
Professor Jerzy Toeplitz had been appointed as the School's<br />
foundation Director.<br />
Legislation was introduced in Parliament on 31 May<br />
to establish the School as an independent body. Mr. Whitlam<br />
said that with. this step he envisaged a new kind of Councilone<br />
in which the staff and students of the School would be<br />
represented and which would have strong links to film-making<br />
interests. It was intended that when the School was fully<br />
operating the Council would have fifteen full members, five<br />
to be appointed by the Governor-General, two elected from the<br />
teachers of the School, two elected from the students, the<br />
Director of the School, and five elected by a convocation of<br />
the School. The convocation would consist of graduates of the<br />
School, staff, past Council members and representatives of the<br />
widest range of film and television interests including education,<br />
industry and community groups.<br />
The Prime Minister said " I hope that by the<br />
appointment of a representative body of this kind it will be<br />
possible to ensure that the School conducts its activities in<br />
a way which will be most responsive to the needs of promising<br />
young film-makers and of the community which will provide-a<br />
public for their work." </p>
