PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 13 February 1986<br />
Ministers met this morning and again this evening to<br />
consider the Government's policy response to the<br />
substantial fall in crude oil prices which has recently<br />
occurred on world markets.<br />
Ministers felt that, in view of the fact that there is<br />
no need for immediate legislation, the complexity of the<br />
issue, the volatility of the market, and in the<br />
interests of ensuring the best decision for the<br />
Australian economy, the matter would not be finalised<br />
until later in the month.<br />
This will enable a full assessment to be made of the<br />
implications of recent developments for the Budget and<br />
economic policy.<br />
The deferral of the decision will not affect the date at<br />
which any benefits will be passed on to the consumer. </p>
