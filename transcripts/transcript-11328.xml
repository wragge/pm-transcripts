    <content><![CDATA[<p>E&amp;OE.................</p>
<p>Michael and Toni and Mr and Mrs Schneider, Commissioner Halligan,</p>
<p> Andrew Peacock the Australian Ambassador to the United States, ladies</p>
<p> and gentlemen.</p>
<p>Not long after he became Consul-General I got a phone call late one</p>
<p> night and Michael said, John, he says, I can save the Government an</p>
<p> enormous amount of money and he then proceeded to explain to me this</p>
<p> plan of his to shift the Consulate-General from the Rockefeller Centre</p>
<p> to here. But he said the only problem is the Department of Finance</p>
<p> reckons it's going to cost us more money. So there followed a bit</p>
<p> of a debate and in the end Michael persuaded us that it would indeed</p>
<p> be an extremely good deal and the Minister John Fahey was persuaded</p>
<p> that it would be an extremely good deal and as a consequence the Consulate-General</p>
<p> has come here.</p>
<p>And Michael has been telling me for some time that when I am next</p>
<p> in New York I should come along to a little gathering like this and</p>
<p> as I am about to do to honour a very famous American, that is to honour</p>
<p> Douglas MacArthur who is to a generation of Australians probably the</p>
<p> most formidable, famous and emphatic figure in American military history</p>
<p> and somebody who during the course of his life played a major role</p>
<p> in the military salvation of Australia during World War II. And I</p>
<p> think it is appropriate that this room which brings together so many</p>
<p> Australians in the United States and so many Australians in New York</p>
<p> in particular it is appropriate that it should be named after a man</p>
<p> who, of course, established his headquarters in Brisbane in Australia</p>
<p> during the worst time of World War II, who uttered those famous words</p>
<p> "we will return" after he left the Philippines and he, of</p>
<p> course, led the allies during those very, very difficult times and</p>
<p> I think it is therefore incredibly appropriate that we should do this.</p>
<p>Can I just say before I perform that little ceremony, can I say on</p>
<p> behalf of the Australian Government how much it appreciates the work</p>
<p> done by not only the Consul-General himself and Toni but all of the</p>
<p> other members of the staff who work out of this Consulate-General's</p>
<p> office.</p>
<p>It is a very important post. It has as character and it has a responsibility</p>
<p> because it is in the centre of the greatest financial capital in the</p>
<p> world, because it is here in New York it does have a special responsibility</p>
<p> above and beyond the responsibility of consulate generals in other</p>
<p> parts of the world.</p>
<p>New York, of course, has a special appeal, a special character and</p>
<p> a special place not only in the United States but indeed in the entire</p>
<p> world. And it is a real experience to represent ones country in this</p>
<p> very dynamic and remarkable city.</p>
<p>So I want to say on this occasion how much the Government appreciates</p>
<p> the work being done by the staff of the Consulate. And could I also</p>
<p> say how delighted I am that this gathering is, in a sense, jointly</p>
<p> sponsored by the Australian American Association. An organisation</p>
<p> that has worked very hard to work out.work very, very hard to bring</p>
<p> our two countries and our two peoples together over a very long period</p>
<p> of time.</p>
<p>I think it was Dr Johnson said that we should keep our friendships</p>
<p> in good repair and although the friendship between the United States</p>
<p> and Australia is a very longstanding one, it's a very deep one and</p>
<p> it's one that is constantly renewed and reinforced it's very important</p>
<p> that we always work on it. And I remember when former President, George</p>
<p> Bush, came to Australia in 1991 he reminded us that he would be the</p>
<p> last significant figure in the - and he is a pretty significant figure</p>
<p> in his administration - he was the last.he'd be the last significant</p>
<p> figure in any administration in either country who was part of the</p>
<p> World War II generation and therefore experienced the particularly</p>
<p> close links on the battlefield against the odds between our two nations</p>
<p> and our two societies. And that as successive generations have come</p>
<p> it is important that we not just assume that the friendship will always</p>
<p> go on, we should work on it and we should nurture it. And gatherings</p>
<p> like tonight are an opportunity to honour it.</p>
<p>It's an opportunity for me, on behalf of the Australian Government,</p>
<p> to say, despite our differences to which Michael referred to one,</p>
<p> we remain very firmly committed to an alliance that has meant a great</p>
<p> deal to us. To a security association that remains the very cornerstone</p>
<p> of our continuing security and to a cultural relationship between</p>
<p> two people who share so much and most importantly they share a common</p>
<p> commitment to the values of human individuality of human freedom and</p>
<p> of human dignity. And in the end it is the values that mean most in</p>
<p> the unity of peoples and in the unity of nations.</p>
<p>Douglas MacArthur did an enormous amount to preserve that through</p>
<p> his leadership during World War II with one of those Baume flourishes</p>
<p> for which he is famous. Baume, of course, represented the seat of</p>
<p> MacArthur in the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia between</p>
<p> 1975 and 1983 before the electors of MacArthur had the ill-grace,</p>
<p> the ill-wisdom, the ill-manners and all of those other things to vote</p>
<p> him out. And one of his former constituents, Stanham-MacArthur, Clinton</p>
<p> Stanham-MacArthur, who incidentally is not related to Douglas MacArthur</p>
<p> but with another, sort of, 'Baumeism' he is the great, great, great</p>
<p> grandson of John McArthur who founded the wool industry in Australia.</p>
<p>So whenever you have a function organised by Michael Baume you can</p>
<p> always expect the odd whimsy and the odd Baume flourish and we have</p>
<p> another one.</p>
<p>So, ladies and gentlemen, this room I name the MacArthur Room. This</p>
<p> room will be a reminder to all who come here of the enormous contribution</p>
<p> made by Douglas MacArthur particularly will Australians remember him</p>
<p> when he was the source of leadership and encouragement and hope. The</p>
<p> very strong working relationship that he forged with one of my distinguished</p>
<p> predecessors, John Curtin, who was Prime Minister of Australia during</p>
<p> the days of World War II. In Brisbane he established his headquarters</p>
<p> and there's a very special association therefore with the city of</p>
<p> Brisbane. I think it is an entirely and eminently appropriate name</p>
<p> to give this room and it will continue to be a reminder to all Australians</p>
<p> who use it of the enormous contribution that that great man gave to</p>
<p> the defence of Australia and to the saving of Australia and to the</p>
<p> security of Australia during the darkest days of World War II.</p>
<p>I declare this formally named The MacArthur Room and I hope it will</p>
<p> be a very, very effective reminder of the contribution of that great</p>
<p> man, to the freedom Australians now enjoy. Thank you.</p>
<p>Prime Minister formally names the multi-function room the MacArthur</p>
<p> Room and bestows AO on Consul-General Baume and AM on cartoonist Mr</p>
<p> Paul Rigby.</p>
<p>This is typical of any show Baume puts on. This is a marvellously</p>
<p> deregulated evening. Paul's just responded to my speech of congratulations</p>
<p> but can I very briefly say how privileged I feel to have not only</p>
<p> conferred the honour on my long and dear friend Michael Baume but</p>
<p> also on undoubtedly one of Australia's greatest cartoonist so when</p>
<p> he says, you know, don't look behind me, I might end up being drawn</p>
<p> by him yet.</p>
<p>Politicians and cartoonists have a, how should I describe it, a particular</p>
<p> association. It's different from the association you have with virtually</p>
<p> anybody else and given the lot of all politicians you, how can I best</p>
<p> describe it, you think you've seen the worst until you see the next</p>
<p> one. But they are a special part of the, I suppose, the daily routine</p>
<p> and the daily life of a politician and Australian cartoonists, Paul,</p>
<p> is absolutely right. They have a larrikin spirit, they have an enterprise,</p>
<p> they have a certain flair about them that I don't think the cartoonists</p>
<p> of any other country can remotely touch.</p>
<p>Now, I know that's a pretty boastful thing to say but I think judging</p>
<p> the character of the audience here I can probably get away with saying</p>
<p> it and it does indeed happen to be true. And I am delighted that Paul</p>
<p> has been able to be here today and that I've had the privilege of</p>
<p> formally conferring his award on him.</p>
<p>I've said a lot about Michael in his time and in his career. I think</p>
<p> everyone knows that Michael and I have a passing regard for each other.</p>
<p> He really has been, without doubt, one of my very best and closest</p>
<p> friends certainly but not only in the political arena.</p>
<p>He's been a great mate and that, of course, is about the nicest thing</p>
<p> that an Australian can say about anybody. He really has through thick</p>
<p> and thin but he's also contributed more than friendship to me. He's</p>
<p> also added great value to everything that he's done. He was a very</p>
<p> colourful and capable journalist. He had a very interesting career</p>
<p> in the financial community. He won a marginal seat in the great Fraser</p>
<p> flood of 1975. He lost it in the, sort of, the Hawke hurricane of</p>
<p> 1983. He reincarnated himself as a Senator in 1984 and I remember</p>
<p> one of the great ironies of politics is that in 1983 Michael was quite</p>
<p> devastated at having lost his seat and he came to work for me on my</p>
<p> staff when I became Deputy Leader of the Opposition. Then he was invited</p>
<p> by the then Leader of the Opposition in NSW, Nick Greiner, to run</p>
<p> for what had become quite a winnable seat in the NSW Parliament. I</p>
<p> think it was the seat of Camden wasn't it Michael? It was the seat</p>
<p> of Camden. And he worked very, very hard for the preselection and</p>
<p> the phones worked overtime as they normally do in these preselection</p>
<p> battles and he was absolutely devastated and distraught when he lost</p>
<p> the preselection to a fellow, I think he spells his name - F-A-H-E-Y</p>
<p> - John Fahey who then went on to become Premier of NSW and is now</p>
<p> the Finance Minister in my Government.</p>
<p>Michael was terribly upset and distraught and disappointed and the</p>
<p> then government in its, I think ill-wisdom although Michael didn't</p>
<p> think so at the time, decided with the support of the National Party</p>
<p> to increase the size of the Parliament and that created new Senate</p>
<p> opportunities. I said to Michael, why don't you run for the Senate</p>
<p> and he took my advice and we made a better job of the preselection</p>
<p> on that occasion and we managed to get him preselected and he was</p>
<p> reincarnated as Senator Michael Baume from the State of NSW. He continued</p>
<p> to represent NSW in the Senate from then on but he has been a very</p>
<p> close friend but he's added great value to the Parliament and everybody</p>
<p> tells me who passes through New York what a terrific job he does as</p>
<p> the Consul General here and it's been very evident.</p>
<p>Can I finish by saying to you, Andrew, what a tremendously nice thought</p>
<p> it was to sub-delegate your delegation. I think there's a delightful</p>
<p> symmetry Governor General to Ambassador to Prime Minister. I think</p>
<p> it's absolutely marvellous that you thought to do that and I really</p>
<p> am tickled pink that I've had the opportunity, not only of extending</p>
<p> this award to Michael but also to you Paul. It adds a very special</p>
<p> dimension to this delightful occasion here in New York and one that</p>
<p> I know you both will, and I and Janette will, remember for a very</p>
<p> long time.</p>
<p>Congratulations to you both. The awards are eminently deserved. You</p>
<p> have contributed greatly to the spirit and the life of Australia and</p>
<p> you are precisely the sort of people who should be honoured in the</p>
<p> Order of Australia. Thank you.</p>
