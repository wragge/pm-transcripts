PRESS CONFEMM~ E 25 OCTO! 3MP 1984 G. LMDS2ONE<br />
PM1: Ladies axnd Gentlemen,-the ctatistics that have come out<br />
today are absolute proof positive of the success of my<br />
Government's policy7 in fighting infl~ ation and unemrployment<br />
first. in combination, I think they are the best the country's<br />
had for a decade. lIn regard to inflation, the' annual. rate nlow<br />
of 6.1f on the basia of the 1.30, for the September quarter is<br />
the lowest inflation rate for more than a decade. At the same<br />
as tie have got the lowest inflation rate for more than decade<br />
we have the employment vaca~ ncy statistics from the Commxonwcal-th<br />
Employmenit Service which shows 2.1t more vacancies this Septeraber<br />
than in the previoua September, that if; now five quarters<br />
a row with substantial increasea in vacancies. So outstanding<br />
succeso 6n the inflation front and on the employment front. Now<br />
the people of Australia know the 7 gruell~ ing years through which<br />
~ they went on the basis of the Opposition's fight inflation first-<br />
' they did not fight inflation, wie had record inflation and we had<br />
record unemployment. Now the Opposition ise seeking to go to<br />
the people again now with a return of a. policy which must<br />
restore unemployment and certainly send. inflation through<br />
the roof. N~ ow the people have a clear choice. The statistical<br />
evidence is there, we are winning the fight against inflation.,<br />
we are winning the fight against unemployment.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime. M~ ini ster, do yuepcthtrntoonltinue<br />
through to ne:,. t year? yuepc h rn oc<br />
PM: Yes I do. ' And that is bacaiise the statistics that have<br />
emerged reflect the applicatb-n of fundamental economic policies<br />
calculated to produce these resulits. They are based on an<br />
Accord between Government and the trade union movement. It is<br />
* quite clear now that if you look at the underlying inflation<br />
rate thure has been a fundamental change achieved. We are now<br />
down to the level of the average of the OECD countries. The last<br />
6 months we are now below the United States and the United 1 ingdom<br />
which is very significant in competitive terms and this will. mean<br />
that the budget. forecast which wais for an inflation rate of 5.25t<br />
year on year 46 will core in below that and the award.<br />
wages assumption of about 3t through the year will be easily<br />
matched I believe. go w-hen yvu nave got those underlying<br />
factore operating, yaa wie can e~ zuect a continuing successful<br />
assault oni inflation. We are dounm with the rest of tho world<br />
and below significvn t pt of it. We are performing better 7-, </p>
<p>2.<br />
in employmant creation because of there fundamental factors<br />
operating, the Accord betwoen Government and unions, good0<br />
co-op. arative relationz with the busi~ ness community. Yes,<br />
th's sucressf-u1 economic picture will further develop through<br />
NOS.<br />
JOURNALIST: * Prime Minister, could I ask you abo'. it an aspect of<br />
the Accord. The-wage guidelines, I think, are to be reviewed next<br />
year. Do you see any need for a change in those guidelines. In<br />
particular, do you see any case for a more flexibld syste m whiLch<br />
would allow wcges, wage rises to be different between different<br />
industries in special circurtitancea?<br />
PM: I think basically the guidelines have worked well and<br />
certainly that is the position that is agreed between the trade<br />
unions and ourselves and I think to a very large extent the<br />
business community welcomes the substantial wage stability*<br />
and price reductiont-Anflation reduction, which is associated,<br />
has been associated with the application of the guidelines.<br />
Now always any system should be periodically looked at, and it<br />
may be that as there is a gradual rcstructuring of industry<br />
through time~, on the basis of our consultall. ion with the trade<br />
unions and with indusntry itself, that the: -e may be some need to<br />
perhaps adapt marginally the guidelines so that you avoid<br />
unnecessary rigidities which would prevent sensible restructuzing.<br />
But that could be on the agenda of discuss; ions in the EPAq and<br />
the Manufacturing Advisory Council over the longer term. So in<br />
the day to aay operation of basic economic: policy I think the<br />
guidelines are working well. I mean the evidence iB there that<br />
they are.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime M4inister, based on today's figures*, does3 that<br />
affect the. immediacy of your plans for tax. reform.<br />
PM: That ha~ s got nothing to do with tax reform.<br />
JOURNALIST:. Prime Minister, the secondary boycot. decision<br />
in the Se-neate last. Democrat Senator Jack Evans said the<br />
Government was secretly pleased about this. Is that right<br />
and are you going-to strengthen the..<br />
in the way the Democrats want.<br />
PM: I don't know about Senator Evans capacity to know the<br />
public or the private happiness or unhappiness of the Government.<br />
I would think that Senator Evans ha23 got enough to concentrate<br />
on with the problems ift his own party. But just let me<br />
say this that tie put legislation up in good faith. We have<br />
always said, and we put it to the people before the last electl _ on,<br />
it was more appropriate to have pro~ vision of that sort in the<br />
conciliation and arbitration act and so we had a dual package<br />
taking 45D and E out of the Trade Pr7actices Act and having<br />
legislation, amending legislation, in the 47 and A Act. NOW'<br />
we will just have to consider that position next year when we<br />
come back and we will have further discussions with everyone<br />
concerned. JOURNAL IST: Back on the wage indexation gui. delines, Prime M4inister,<br />
you mention the possibility of the prospect of removing unnecessary<br />
rigidities.. </p>
<p>3.<br />
PM: No, no, I, not of removing unnecessary rigidities, I said<br />
that as we moved down the path of gradual restructuring of<br />
Australian industry you could get a situation emerging, Paul,<br />
of some rigidities, which<br />
JOURNALIST' I was wondering what sort of<br />
PM: Well I think it is. too early to say but if you could see<br />
that you were wanting to build up certain aspects of industry<br />
and it was appropriate in terms of getting a mobility of labour<br />
into that new industry, I am simply speaking hypothetically now,<br />
ir that situation there may be some need for some slight modification<br />
of the guidelines to meet that sort of situation.<br />
JOURNALIST: ( inaudible, relates to previous question)<br />
PM: Yes, I do.<br />
JOURNALIST: Would you expect this matter to be looked at<br />
in the next few months?<br />
PM: Oh I think it is the sort of thing, Michelle which just<br />
emerges naturally in the processes of discussions with EPAC and<br />
other ' relevant bodies where, this Government as it. is, is looking<br />
to the future. We have from day one if office, we haven't just<br />
haven't been trying to turn the immediate economic situation<br />
around, we have been addressing our minds to what has to happen<br />
to Australian industry in the future to maximise the use of our<br />
resources. So these sorts of discussions are going on all the<br />
time and it is not a question of saying well we need to look at<br />
it-next year, discussions relevant to this have been already<br />
going on and I would expect no problems from either employers,<br />
trade unions or any governments if w'e saw that to optimise<br />
economic development in a particular direction, you needed<br />
perhaps some modification of the guidelines, I think everyone<br />
would say that makes sense.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, based on-those figures can you<br />
see, in the short or<br />
PM: Well, let me say this, you would understand that in<br />
Seconomic theory and practice on of the important factors in<br />
determining the movements in interests is not just the level<br />
of inflation but inflationary expectations. Then in other<br />
words, if business and government had the view that inflation<br />
is going to be increasing then naturally the price of money<br />
is affec'ted accordingly,.. and interest rates tend to go up<br />
to cover that expectation. Now with the clear evidence now<br />
the fall in inflationary rate has happened and that the<br />
expectation should be further movements in that direction.<br />
I would expect this to be a downward factor on interest rates.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister could I ask you a couple of questions<br />
about the situation in the Philippines. / 4 </p>
<p>PM: Well sure you can in a moment. I jus. wonder are there<br />
any others in the<br />
JOUR'ALIST: Prime Minister I just i. ianted ask you<br />
our more favourable inZlationary ponition compared to the<br />
United States and the UK now, how would you expect that to<br />
he reflected in the balance of payments statistics which are<br />
due out later?<br />
PM: Generally speaking what one expects when you have a more<br />
competitive position reflected in your relative inflation rate,<br />
It has this beneficial effect on balance of paymLents. One,<br />
it makes your local product, manufactured in Australia, more<br />
competitive against the imported product. So it has that<br />
beneficial effect on lowering the level'of imports, it tends<br />
to work that way. And makes your enports more competitive<br />
so that you will be able to be in a better export position.<br />
So both on the impoi= tand export side of your balance of trade<br />
and the balance of trade component of your balance of payments,<br />
it is a plus. </p>
<p>JOURNAXLIST: Prine Minister in your speech in Bunbury this morving<br />
you talked about rest2ructilrin g induoitzy -the need Eft and<br />
9 0 ndd to-consider the development of new producta. What new<br />
products do you have in y~ ur mi~ nd.<br />
Well just let mne take Cho oxiample of Bundaberg. I weo<br />
talking to Brian Courtice there and his family bas had almost it<br />
canutry of experience in the sugar:: Indusitry. He wan pointing out<br />
to me the exceptional fertility of the aoil In the area anCA given<br />
the change in the total market structure for sugar where 60% 81 our<br />
product now hao':, got to be expor'ted lie is saying that it uould maka<br />
a lot of sense for you to be lookinq in that area to increase<br />
horticultural production and further divernification in the<br />
vegetable area. Novi" Iese are not new products. These are new<br />
production patterns and that seemed to-me-to make a lot of mense<br />
as far as Bundaberg is concerned. and it fits in with the sort; of<br />
planning that my Government has been doing for the future in our*<br />
relations with tho Asian region. We recognise that that is the.<br />
most dynamic region of the world. The standards of living are<br />
rising rapidly in the western Pacific countries and in China.<br />
And so they will have t'he capacity to expand their range of<br />
consumption, their pattern of consumption, and it just seems to me<br />
that Brian very sensibly pointing out to bow thor'e may need to<br />
be somo restructuring and redirection of industry in his area.<br />
N~ ow thatfs one aspect of it. Blut when you talk about newy pr'oductu<br />
I believe that with the impetus Vie're trying to give in managerment<br />
investment companies in the venture capital area that Australa<br />
should show a capacity in new areas of teclinology to adapt its<br />
productive processes and enterprisev to-new products in that sort<br />
of area. I mean one of the example. I suggest is the developnent<br />
which came out of CSIRO and which is now going to be set up in<br />
Adelaide deVeloping these larger chipa which seems to me from the<br />
evidence made available to me to. ofter opportunities of developing<br />
an industry in that area. Now I don'twant* to exaggerate 11ow<br />
gig that would be. But I just give that at; an example. We have<br />
shown as Australlans a great deal of inventiveness over time. The<br />
problem has been not so muchl a lack of inven~ tiveness but translating<br />
that inventiveness in an applied way to get the benefit of the<br />
actual manufacturing, here in Australia. Now I think we can do theac<br />
things. JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, ( manufacturing and metal trades)<br />
Well the heavy engineering industry has been before us and<br />
we have referred the heavy engineering indmstry to the IAC, in two<br />
sections for an immediate report within three months as towThat<br />
short term measures are desirable to agsist thin section of industry<br />
and then the lorar term tuelve wonth:; report as to what l'onger term<br />
measures are necessary. We waill wait for the report from the IAC<br />
and vie w-4ll make the decisions that are necesseary to try and give<br />
stimuluD to that section of the industry. And to the antent that<br />
we do that we would hope that this aroa tiould also benofit from it. </p>
<p>JOURNALISTi Prime Minister you said earlier this month there'd need<br />
to be a fall in unemployment before workers achieved productivity<br />
increases. Would you comment on Mr Dolan's. statement yesterday that<br />
the ACTU will press ahead with its productivity claims without<br />
necessarily waiting for unemployment to drop. Would the Government<br />
support such a claim?<br />
No, we've made it clear all along to the ACTU that the<br />
Government will consider its position in regard to that case in the<br />
light of all tho evidence available to it at the time. And there<br />
is an agreement between us all that the more you're gatting<br />
unemployment down, the more jobs that have been created,'. then the<br />
better then it that environment for. a consideration of some<br />
improvoment in real standards. We've made it quite clear and the<br />
ACTU understands our position on that. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Prime Minister are you satisied that justice<br />
has been done in the Philippinrs in relation to the<br />
assassination of Benigno Aginino?<br />
PM: Well,: I guess in one sense it is too early to say. You<br />
have now got the majority and minority findings of the<br />
commission and we will be watching very closely what happens<br />
as a next step. I must say that I haven't yet had the opportunity<br />
of having a communication with my Foreign Minister or my own<br />
Department on this, but I would expect either later today or<br />
when I get to Sydney tomorrow to have more detailed informaticn<br />
so that I will personally be in a better position to analyse it<br />
and come to some conclusion. But just generally I want to the<br />
point that Australia has a very keen inte: est in development<br />
in the Philippines, there is a long historical association. We<br />
have an aid program there and we will be watching very, very<br />
closely the developments in that country. It's just a little<br />
too early for me to say definitively anything in answer to your<br />
question. As soon as I feel that I am I will be more than happy<br />
to speak further with you.<br />
JOURNALIST: Will Australia be trying to use its influence with<br />
the Philippines in order to try and bring about justice there?<br />
PM: Yes.<br />
JOURNALIST: In what sort of way?<br />
PM: Well, there are a number of ways I think that Mr Hayden<br />
showed very effectively earlier in this year how he was<br />
prepared to talk to the President and to talk to other people<br />
directly and show that Australia doesn't really have passing<br />
interest but is prepared to push a point of view about what<br />
should happen, particularly in respect of Father Gore. So we<br />
will not ostentatiously, but I believe and effectively make<br />
our position known, both by ourselves and I think in association<br />
with other nations which share our views on the matter.<br />
JOURNALIST: When you use the Australian aid, when you use<br />
the aid which Australia gives to the Philippines in order to<br />
exert influence on President Marcos<br />
PM: Well as you know Mr Hayden has directed his attention to<br />
this matter and has asked Cabinet direct attention to it. We<br />
have looked at it and we have maintained the aid programs in the<br />
forms that are operating now. Now if My Hayden believes on a<br />
further review that we will need to look again at that, then<br />
then the Cabinet will. But there has nothing been put before<br />
it at this time.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, can this state which you might<br />
regard as conservative, the Queensland Premier, his wife and<br />
others who support them, claim you are making rather deliberate<br />
socialistic attacks on the family unit. For instance, taking<br />
their security blanket, the Union Jack, off the family bed,<br />
removing the Queen's photograph off the family wall, encouraging<br />
the kids to leave school early to join the dole queue. How<br />
will you reassure a conservative electorate. </p>
<p>PMs I would have thought the conservative electorate might<br />
have just, and I hope to have the opportunity on television<br />
tonight, of looking at how the kid3 of the families of thic<br />
area are upset by me and my Government. I don't think you<br />
could get a much warmer reception that we got. Look what<br />
matters to the families of Australia are these things. ARe<br />
they as they start their family going to have a home in<br />
which to have the family. NOw just quickly on that, when we<br />
came into office at the beginning of the year the housing<br />
industry was just about destroyed. We have under the First<br />
Home Owners Scheme in the public housing system we have<br />
got the housing industry working now at full bore. There's<br />
more homes being built than under the previous government<br />
operating at 140,000 dwelling commenements a year. So if<br />
you are talking family homes for families, jobs for kids<br />
of families, last year of the previous government an increase<br />
in unemployment of a quarter of a million, under my Government<br />
since last April, April of ' 83 260,000 new jobs created,<br />
unemployment down and the unemployment rate for kids down.<br />
Education, we have now created a situation in Australia where<br />
certain assured funding, both in the public and the private<br />
sector in primary and secondary education provided for the<br />
next eight years, welcomed by both the public, the state<br />
and the private sector and that's created an entirely new<br />
situation. Health, when we came into office 2 million<br />
Australians, they don't exist floating around in space,<br />
they are members of families. Two million Australians<br />
not covered for medical and health care. Now under our<br />
Government, universal coverage. No family in Australia,<br />
no family, need worry about the spectre of sickness which<br />
haunted so many of them before. So there you have it. If<br />
you are talking about families, the real things that matter,<br />
they talk about flags and things like that, the things that<br />
matter, homes, jobs, education, health, and you compare our<br />
record with the Liberals and the National Party.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, you spoke yesterday of the<br />
prospect of the Governments and the unions agreeing to<br />
discount : bearing in mind that there's already talk of a trade<br />
off between productivity against wage rises and superannuation<br />
bearing in mind also the traditional dislike of the unions<br />
for indirect taxes, what can the Government offer the unions as<br />
a trade off apart from reductions in personal income tax.<br />
Well today is not the time to develop the position. in regard<br />
to tax. Today is clearly the day which shows that our general.<br />
economic policies are working in the areas of employment and<br />
inflation. And I simply make the point that they are working with<br />
spectacular success because we believe in the process of effective<br />
consultation with the unions, with the business community and the<br />
Government. We will apply exactly the same processes of<br />
consultation to the area of developing tax policies and on the<br />
evidence the outstanding successes we've had in general economic<br />
policy as a result of consultations will also be reflected in our<br />
approach to the tax area. f ( ret* t A f V: s </p>
