PRIME MINISTER<br />
REMARKS TO JAPAN AUSTRALIAN SOCIETY: 1 FEBRUARY ( UNDERLINED-.<br />
AMBASSADOR SAITO<br />
MEMBERS OF THE JAPAN-AUSTRALIA SOCIETY<br />
DISTINGUISHED GUESTS<br />
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE WARM WELCOME YOU HAVE GIVEN ME THIS<br />
EVENING. I REGRET THAT OTHER COMMITMENTS MEAN THAT I CAN ONLY<br />
SPEND A SHORT TIME WITH YOU.<br />
A FEW BRIEF WORDS ARE, HOWEVER, IN ORDER.<br />
AS YOU ALL KNOW JAPAN HAS FOR MANY YEARS BEEN AUSTRALIA'S MOST<br />
IMPORTANT TRADING PARTNER. I AM SURE THAT IT WILL REMAIN SO.<br />
HOWEVER, THE NATURE OF TRADE BETWEEN OUR TWO COUNTRIES IS CHANGING.<br />
THIS IS ONLY NATURAL AS THE TWO PARTIES ADJUST TO EVOLVING ECONOMIC<br />
CIRCUMSTANCES. DESPITE THESE DIFFERENT CIRCUMSTANCES, HOWEVERt I<br />
WOULD EXPECT JAPAN TO REMAIN A SUBSTANTIAL MARKET FOR AUSTRALIAN<br />
RAW MATERIALS AND AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS. THESE ITEMS WILL CLEARLY<br />
REMAIN VERY IMPORTANT TO JAPAN.<br />
AS BEFITS A TRADING PARTNER OF MANY YEARS STANDINGi AUSTRALIA IS<br />
DETERMINED TO BE A-RELIABLE AND COMPETITIVE SUPPLIER. WE ASK IN<br />
RETURN THAT AUSTRALIA BE TREATED NO LESS FAVOURABLY THAN OTHER<br />
SUPPLIERS AND THAT AUSTRALIAN INTERESTS. BE TAKEN FULLY INTO ACCOUNT<br />
BY JAPAN IN ITS APPROACH TO THE RESOLUTION OF BILATERAL TRADE PROBLEMS<br />
WITH OTHER COUNTRIES.<br />
AUSTRALIA NEVERTHELESS RECOGNISES THAT IT MUST GIVE CLOSER ATTENTION<br />
TO THE POTENTIAL OF OTHER MARKETS IN JAPAN. JAPANESE MARKETS FOR<br />
MANUFACTURES, PROCESSED FOODSTUFFS AND SERVICES NEED TO BE EXAMINED<br />
CLOSELY IF AUSTRALIA IS TO ARREST THE FALL IT HAS EXPERIENCED IN<br />
RECENT YEARS IN ITS SHARE OF TOTAL JAPANESE IMPORTS. WITH THIS IN<br />
MIND WE ARE DEVELOPING A JAPAN MARKET STRATEGY THAT WILL INVOLVE<br />
THE APPOINTMENT OF TWO SENIOR JAPANESE CONSULTING FIRMS TO RESEARCH<br />
NEW MARKETS FOR AUSTRALIA. THE OPPORTUNITIES IDENTIFIED WILL BE<br />
BROUGHT TO THE ATTENTION OF AUSTRALIAN FIRMS LIKELY TO BE ABLE<br />
SUCCESSFULLY TO SUPPLY SUCH MARKETS. WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF THE<br />
JAPANESE GOVERNMENT, AUSTRALIA ALSO HOPES TO BE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE<br />
FULLY IN JAPAN'S PROGRAM OF IMPORT LIBERALISATION.<br />
THE CHALLENGE POSED BY ECONOMIC CHANGE IS FORMIDABLE. IT WILL RE-<br />
( UIRE CONTINUING CONSULTATION AND OISCUSSION TO ENSURE TFHAT EACh"<br />
SIDE FULLY UNDERSTANDS THE NEEDS OF THE OTHER. IT IS O.' L OF<br />
THE PRINCIPAL OBJECTIVES OF r: Y VISIT TO JAPAN TO ENSURE<br />
MUTUAL UNDERSTANDING AND TRUST ESElTIAlA FOR HA R: i0 1OUS E iF<br />
IS DEVELO; PED A A I E M Y DI S US S i0 NS WI P E T E<br />
NAASONE THIS ~ IG nAVE A U RE : E THAI JAPAN SPi-A b .1ii T--<br />
ION. </p>
<p>THE ECONOMIC RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN JAPAN AND AUSTRALIA IS NOT OF<br />
COURSE CONFINED TO TRADE. MY GOVERNMENT WELCOMES THE GROWING<br />
JAPANESE INTEREST IN INVESTMENT IN AUSTRALIA. THE PROSPECTS FOR<br />
CO-OPERATION IN SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY ARE ENCOURAGING. THE POTENT-*<br />
IAL FOR DEVELOPING TOURISM IS ALSO CONSIDERABLE. I SEE PROSPECTS IN<br />
THESE AREAS AS GOOD REASONS FOR CONFIDENCE IN THE CONTINUED GROWTH<br />
AND DIVERSITY IN THE ECONOMIC RELATIONSHIP.<br />
BUT IN THE END IT IS-PEOPLE THAT MATTER. THE VERY SUCCESS OF THE<br />
JAPANESE ECONOMY IN A COUNTRY WHERE BASIC PHYSICAL RESOURCES ARE<br />
LIMITED IS EVIDENCE OF THAT.<br />
AND SO IT IS THAT AN ESSENTIAL ELEMENT IN THE BROADENING OF CO-OPERATION<br />
BETWEEN JAPAN AND AUSTRALIA HAS BEEN THE-CONTINUING COMMITMENT<br />
OF INDIVIDUALS AND PRIVATE-LEVEL ORGANISATIONS TO THE FOSTERING OF<br />
MUTUAL UNDERSTANDING AND GOODWILL. I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT THE ROLE<br />
YOUR OWN SOCIETY HAS PLAYED. OVER THE YEARS IN PROMOTING FRIENDSHIP<br />
AND EXCHANGES BETWEEN AUSTRA LIANS AND JAPANESE IS GREATLY APPRECIATE[)<br />
IN AUSTRALIA. THE PRESENCE HERE OF SO MANY DISTINGUISHED PEOPLE IS<br />
A MOST ENCOURAGING INDICATION THAT THERE IS IN JAPAN A CONTINUING<br />
HIGH LEVEL OF INTEREST IN AUSTRALIA AND AUSTRALIANS. AS WELL AS<br />
EXCELLENT HOSPITALITYi YOU HAVE-GIVEN ME A FURTHER REASON FOR<br />
CONFIDENCE IN THE FUTURE VITALITY OF OUR RELATIONSHIP.<br />
I WISH YOUR SOCIETY EVERY SUCCESS IN ITS FUTURE WORK. </p>
