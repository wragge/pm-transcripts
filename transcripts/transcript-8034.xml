PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF NEWS COFRNE ' MONTSALVAT', MELBOUNE<br />
14 JUNE 1990<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
JOURNALIST: Will you be making any attempt to..<br />
Senator Graham Richardson to stay in politics after 1993?<br />
PM: Well, I'd certainly like to see Graham staying as<br />
long as possible. He's brought a very unique quality I<br />
think. He came in with the reputation, deservedly, of a<br />
good hard numbers man, and a commitment to winning power<br />
for the Party in New South Wales and federally. That<br />
was the image that he brought and it was a justified one.<br />
But he's also, since he's been in the Federal Parliament,<br />
shown a great commitment to environmental issues which<br />
surprised many people but it's an absolutely foundational<br />
commitment he has. And I think not only the Government,<br />
but the people of Australia, owe him a great debt for the<br />
way in which he has, I think, helped to shape political<br />
thinking in this area. I hope that he stays around for<br />
some time.<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you think he wants another job?<br />
PM: No, no. I was with him last night. We had a yarn<br />
as we often do and he's enjoying the job he's got.<br />
JOURNALIST: Would you consider offering him another<br />
portfolio at some point<br />
PM: We've just had an election, just had an election and<br />
we have just established a portfolio structure. That's<br />
only two months ago. You don't establish a portfolio<br />
structure two months ago and then start thinking about a<br />
reshuffle. JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, can you clarify finally the<br />
position of the Chinese students?<br />
PM: Now, look, I've got very little more to say on this.<br />
I've made it quite clear that as far as these students<br />
are concerned this country, as you would expect of<br />
Australia, will be making particular arrangements to<br />
ensure the proper welfare and protection of these people.<br />
And when I said that at the beginning, that there'd be a<br />
particular category, special category, people then wrote<br />
all sorts of things into that. I repeat that I and my </p>
<p>Government will be making sure that these people get the<br />
appropriate protection and consideration their<br />
circumstances deserve. I've said that from the<br />
beginning. I think it's appropriate that we, right now,<br />
because as I've said at the beginning, there are<br />
particulars about this that have to be considered and<br />
determined by the Cabinet. That'll be done in the week<br />
after next. But the students themselves can rest assured<br />
that their interests will be fully protected. There<br />
won't be any question of people being returned against<br />
their will, this category of people who came here before<br />
the Tienanmen Square. Their interests and the interests<br />
of this country will be properly protected. But as I've<br />
said, there are details in this special categorisation<br />
that have to be considered by the Cabinet and there could<br />
be some areas of that in which there may be a slight<br />
difference of opinion. But the basic principles that I<br />
have alluded to will be followed and I'll have that<br />
considered by the Cabinet the week after next.<br />
JOURNALIST: Will those pre-Tienanmen Square be forced to<br />
return at any stage at all?<br />
PM: I've just indicated that it's my belief that no-one<br />
in that category will be forced to return against their<br />
will. Now the details of this whole matter, as I say,<br />
require some consideration and I don't think it's in<br />
anyone's interests now to, having spelt out those<br />
principles, those people can rest safe and content. This<br />
country will certainly do no less, no less than is being<br />
done in major countries like the United States and<br />
Canada. And as I say, there are certain details about<br />
this that will need to be considered by Cabinet and it's<br />
not appropriate that there be any more canvassing of this<br />
now that I've spelt those broad principles out.<br />
JOURNALIST: On the Cambodian refugee question, are you<br />
concerned by the statements of one of the Indonesian<br />
Ministers that they seem to be actively encouraging boat<br />
people to come to this country?<br />
PM: I think you'll appreciate that in these matters it's<br />
best that our relations with both Indonesia and, for that<br />
matter, Cambodia be conducted directly between them and<br />
not by the public media.<br />
JOURNALIST: Have you had any clarification on those<br />
remarks by Admiral Sudomo though?<br />
PM: No, I haven't had any clarification or explanation.<br />
I've seen the remarks, but in matters like this you<br />
conduct these relations between the two governments and<br />
the appropriate levels of ministers. That will be done.<br />
JOURNALIST: Has there been a lack of effective<br />
communication on this issue though, in that relationship?<br />
PM: No. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Are you aware of any scheme that's being<br />
investigated to smuggle these boat people into other<br />
countries, including Australia?<br />
PM: No, not of smuggling. We're aware, as I've said<br />
before, that as far as the situation in Cambodia is<br />
concerned there is an organised scheme obviously underway<br />
there. That's part of the reason why I've made the<br />
remarks that I've had to make before that there mustn't<br />
be some assumption that Australia is simply going to<br />
stand idly by and allow our immigration policy, and our<br />
autonomous right to determine our immigration policy, in<br />
fact be determined outside this country.<br />
JOURNALIST: Is that one of the reasons why you adopted<br />
such a tough line on that issue?<br />
PM: It's not a tough line, it's not a different line.<br />
It's a position which any Prime Minister of Australia<br />
would and should adopt. That is that we have the great<br />
advantage that we speak from a position of the most<br />
compassionate record of any government in the world. We<br />
have taken, on a per capita basis, more refugees from<br />
Indo China than any other country. Now that has been<br />
done under a specific program where we allocate a<br />
category of our total immigration intake for refugees and<br />
we speak from a position of strength. Having ensured<br />
that we've done that in the past and that we'll continue<br />
to play our part in the future in settling refugees,<br />
we're not, as I say, going to have a situation where<br />
people imagine that they can just determine our<br />
immigration content simply by getting in boats and coming<br />
here. At no point have I indicated, nor would I, that if<br />
people actually arrive here, that they're not going to<br />
have open to them the actual processes of the law that<br />
are available to them. I've made that clear.<br />
JOURNALIST: Why aren't you going to the ALP State<br />
Conference this weekend in Victoria?<br />
PM: Well, look I've been Prime Minister now since the<br />
beginning of ' 83. At the best count that I can recall, I<br />
would have been there two or three times in that period.<br />
It's not a regular feature on my calendar.<br />
JOURNALIST: It doesn't have anything to do with the<br />
current situation with the Victorian Government<br />
PM: Well, I have not been there when the ALP was riding<br />
very, very high in the polls here, both the Government<br />
and the Premier. So it really is a continuation of the<br />
fact over seven years it hasn't been a regular event in<br />
my diary. We're going through a poor news period are we?<br />
I mean we've really got to dredge up a story somewhere.<br />
Isn't anything happening anywhere? </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: The Multi-Function Polis is going to be<br />
decided in the next 48 hours or so. Have you got a<br />
preference PM: No wait a Multi-Function Polis is about to be<br />
decided in the next 48 hours-<br />
JOURNALIST: ( inaudible)<br />
PM: Yes. The recommendation will be made to the<br />
Government within a very short period, this week.<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you have a personal preference?<br />
PM: Just let me answer the question. That<br />
recommendation will be made and we will have a look at<br />
that recommendation. Because we will have had the<br />
experts looking at it in detail and obviously whatever<br />
they recommend will carry a very very great deal of<br />
weight. But just so that there'll be a clear<br />
understanding of the processes, that's the first step.<br />
That's the Australian part of the committee making that<br />
recommendation to us. Then at some time within the next<br />
couple of months, I think probably during July, we'll get<br />
then a report from the combined committee, that is the<br />
Japanese-Australian committee. They will then be setting<br />
out their assessment of the pros and cons, the potential<br />
of the Multi-Function Polis concept. Cabinet then will<br />
be making its decision.<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you have a preference for a site?<br />
PM: No I don't actually. I think it's very good sense<br />
in Government when you have the responsibility of<br />
Government to utilise experts from Government and from<br />
the private sector to advise you on matters like that.<br />
That's precisely what we'll be doing. These are people<br />
of competence and commitment and they will, I believe,<br />
have taken everything that's relevant to be taken into<br />
account. So I approach it with a totally open mind. I<br />
say that I will prima facie be inclined to accept their<br />
recommendation. JOURNALIST: Is it going to become a political liability<br />
at all?<br />
PM: Is what going to become a political-<br />
JOURNALIST: The issue itself.<br />
PM: No. I wouldn't have thought so.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, on foreign ownership, is the<br />
Government prepared to legislate about 20% foreign<br />
ownership of Australian newspapers?<br />
PM: No, there is no proposal on our plate about that.<br />
I've simply indicated that if Ministers involved were </p>
<p>wanting to bring something up for consideration by<br />
Government, it would be done. But as far as I know there<br />
is no such proposal.<br />
JOURNALIST: Chairman of the Caucus Committee has<br />
said that Caucus would look favourably at such a<br />
proposal. PM: Mr O'Keefe said a number of things on this. Nothing<br />
that he has said is inconsistent with what I've just put.<br />
ends </p>
