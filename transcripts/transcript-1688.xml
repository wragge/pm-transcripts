VICTORIA CROSS FOR GALLANTRY IN VIETNAM<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, Mr. Harold Holt<br />
Her Majesty the Queen has bestowed posthumously the<br />
award of the Victoria Cross upon a member of the Australian<br />
Army Training Team in Vietnam,, the late Major Peter John Badcoe,<br />
of Canberra. Major Badcoe, who was born in South Australia in 1934,<br />
graduated from the Officer Cadet School, Portsea, in December,<br />
1952. He served with the Australian Army Training Team in<br />
Vietnam from August, 1966, until his death on 7th April, 1967.<br />
Major Badcoe displayed outstanding heroism on three<br />
separate occasions between February and April of this year.<br />
On 23rd February, while acting as an advisor to a<br />
Vietnamese Regional Force Company, Major Badcoe moved across<br />
600 metres of fire-swept terrain to save an American officer's<br />
life. In the subsequent successful assault on the enemy post<br />
he personally killed the machine gunners directly in front of<br />
him. He then personally recovered, still under enemy fire, the<br />
body of another American officer.<br />
His actions during this encounter gave impetus to the<br />
Vietnamese offensive, saved the life of one officer and prevented<br />
the Viet Cong from capturing the body of the other.<br />
On 7th March, Major Badcoe persoanally led a Vietnamese<br />
Company in an attack over open terrain to assault and capture a<br />
heavily defended enemy position. His courage and leadership,<br />
when death and heavy losses were certain, turned defeat into<br />
victory and prevented the enemy from capturing the district<br />
headquarters. His actions were a major contributing factor to<br />
the defeat of a numerically superior enemy force.<br />
On 7th April, Major Badcoe was on an operation with a<br />
Vietnamese Reaction Company in the Huong Tra district. The<br />
Company under heavy attack withdrew to cover leaving Major Badcoe<br />
and his radio operator under heavy mortar fire about 50 metres<br />
ahead of the leading elements. Major Badcoe returned and led the<br />
Company forward again. He continued on and prepared to throw<br />
grenades. He stood up and exposed himself as he prepared to throw.<br />
On the first occasion he was pulled down by his radio operator<br />
because of concentrated fire. On his second attempt to throw a<br />
grenade he again exposed himself and was killed by machine gun<br />
fire. Friendly artillery was then called in and the position<br />
was captured. His gallant actions before the enemy were the motivating<br />
force which inspired the Company to launch a third assault and<br />
overrun an enemy force of superior strength.<br />
The American servicemen who were witnesses of Major<br />
Badcoe's gallant actions emphasise that he knew that almost<br />
certain death could be expected in face of the hail of enemy fire,<br />
and that they saw no possibility of his survival. His personal<br />
valour and unhesitant response to the needs of his comrades-in-arms<br />
were an inspiration for the attacking forces. His presence of<br />
mind and demonstrated professional competence led to the defeat<br />
of an enemy who enjoyed every tactical advantage. Statements by<br />
the Americans all agree that Major Badcoe's actions brought great<br />
credit upon himself and the Australian Army. </p>
<p>2.<br />
Major Badcoe's outstanding bravery and leadership and<br />
subordination of his personal safety were in the highest traditions<br />
of military service. His selfless 6ourage has set an example<br />
worthy to be long remembered in the story of Australia's fighting<br />
men. CANBERlRA 16th October, 1967<br />
The Prime Minister today sent the following letter to<br />
the late Major Badcoe's widow:<br />
