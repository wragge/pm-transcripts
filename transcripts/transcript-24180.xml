    <content><![CDATA[<p>The last thing Australia needs right now is instability and uncertainty.</p>
<p>On reflection, and after talking to my colleagues, Iâve decided that the best thing we can do is deal with the spill motion as quickly as possible and put it behind us.</p>
<p>Accordingly, Iâve asked the Whip, Mr Philip Ruddock, to convene a Party Room meeting at 9 oâclock on Monday morning to deal with this matter.</p>
<p>The only question for our party is do we want to reduce ourselves to the level of the Labor Party in dragging down a first term Prime Minister.</p>
<p>Now, obviously, Iâve been talking to many colleagues over the last few days and my very strong sense is that we are determined to do what we were elected to do: to clean up Laborâs mess and to give our people the economic security and the national security that they need and deserve.</p>
