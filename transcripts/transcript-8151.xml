PRIME MINISTER<br />
CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY EMBARGOED UNTIL, DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
RECEPTION AT THE GERMAN EMBASSY<br />
ON THE OCCASION OF<br />
THE UNIFICATION OF GERMANY<br />
CANBERRA, 3 OCTOBER 1990<br />
I am sure I speak f or all Australians when I express my<br />
congratulations to you, Ambassador, and through you to the<br />
people of Ger-many, on their grand achievement of<br />
unification. As I said recently in Parliament, the Government of<br />
Australia unequivocally welcomes this historic event an<br />
achievement -the German people have built in jubilation,<br />
optimism and above all in a spirit of peacefulness.<br />
Less than a year ago we witnessed those unforgettable<br />
television reports of ordinary German people rebelling<br />
against the artificial division of their country, and by<br />
sheer force -of popular demand bringing down at last that<br />
bleak symbol of post-war division, the Berlin Wall.<br />
Since then we have seen the dismantling of Checkpoint<br />
Charlie and the free movement of people between East and<br />
West Germany. Only last month the four occupying powers<br />
agreed to relinquish their war-time rights, paving the way<br />
for today's creation of a united, sovereign Germany.<br />
A few hours ago at 12 midnight in Berlin the hope of<br />
unification became a reality.<br />
So we are witnessing today a landmark event in the political<br />
history of the Twentieth Century.<br />
The breathtaking speed and effectiveness of the process of<br />
unification was made possible by the spirit of co-operation<br />
and trust displayed by all the countries involved.<br />
I congratulate all those leaders and Governments on the high<br />
sense of responsibility they have demonstrated.<br />
I have writt~ en to my friend, Chancellor Kohl, and to<br />
Prime Minist~ er de Maiziere, passing on Australia's<br />
congratulations and assuring them of our desire for close<br />
and productive relations between Australia and the new<br />
Germany. </p>
<p>2.<br />
And I welcome the assurance I received only today by letter<br />
from Chancellor Kohl that through its regained national<br />
unity, Germany wants to serve the cause of global peace and<br />
advance the unification of Europe at the same time as it<br />
will stand by the moral and legal obligations resulting from<br />
German history.<br />
In the new post-cold war era ushered in by the unification<br />
of Germany, the world will look to Germany and to Europe to<br />
play a new leadership role in making the world peaceful and<br />
prosperous. For example, the world will be looking to<br />
Germany, and to Europe, to show leadership in the reform of<br />
world trade in the Uruguay Round.<br />
Over the weekend, Berlin hosted a marathon whose course<br />
covered both sides of the Brandenburg Gate.<br />
You can understand our pride that the Berlin marathon was<br />
won by an Australian, Steve Moneghetti, in his personal best<br />
time and in the fastest speed recorded in the world this<br />
year. Just as the hosting of the marathon is a symbol and a proof<br />
of the unification of Germany, so may Moneghetti's victory<br />
be an auspicious omen of the ties between Australia and the<br />
new Germany ties that we want to see strengthened,<br />
deepened and enriched in the future. </p>
