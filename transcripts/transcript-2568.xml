PRIME MINISTER<br />
ANZAC OPEN AIR SERVICE<br />
CONCORD, N. S. W. 23 April, 1972.<br />
Speech by the Prime Minister, the Rt Hon. William McMahon, CH, MI. -i<br />
Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen,<br />
O We are here to honor those who died in war and to<br />
commenorate-Anzac Day, one of the notable anniversaries in our<br />
history. Anzac has become a symbol of a nation's valor in war.<br />
It has become a symbol.. of " mateship",-and it has become a symbol of<br />
the bond which unites us with our New Zealand comrades across the<br />
Tasman. All these thoughts are with us today.<br />
Though the forms of observance have changed, the day itselfhas<br />
an-immortal place in the Australian story. It is my hope that<br />
the younger generation, as it grows to manhood, will not forget<br />
what my generation so well remembers. For we remember that it was<br />
on the beaches and hills of Gallipoli that our own created an image<br />
and tradition that is imperishable. They made a name that every<br />
civilian respects. We loathe war: Its brutality, its tragedy and<br />
its waste. But we also cherish our inheritance, freedom and liberty.<br />
Withou. t these freedoms we would not be here in these gardens today.<br />
That is why the originals fought at Gallipoli. That is why<br />
Australia has always been in the-fight for freedom through two<br />
world wars,. in Korea, Malaysia and in Vietnam. We were born free;<br />
not by the accident of history; but by the determined will of the<br />
Australian people and the courage of its fighting forces. You may<br />
say: " That experts tell us that there's no major threat to Australia<br />
in sight in the next few years. " Why then" they ask " Do we<br />
spend so much money on defence, why do we call-up some of our<br />
young men?". " Why are soldiers and sailors and airmen in Malaysia<br />
and Singapore?" The answer is simple; because we must be prepared.<br />
We have to demonstrate to all, that like the Anzacs, we are ready<br />
to stand with them, and if necessary, to fight with them. We have<br />
to remind a would-be aggressor that like the Anzacs we are<br />
ready to fight tooth and nail for freedom and the defence of our<br />
own country: It is better to prevent wars.<br />
The international bully will always think twice if he knows<br />
the other fellow big or small is in fighting trim and packs a<br />
pretty heavy punch. </p>
<p>There was a phrase used during the first world war. " This is the<br />
war to end all wars". Unhappily, it was not. But out of the<br />
sacrifice of those dreadful years freedom was preserved for decent<br />
people. Freedom was won; it was not guaranteed. It is up to us<br />
and our allies to do all we can now to provide the guarantees.<br />
Freedom was again challenged in the second world war-again the<br />
challenge was beaten. It is being challenged again in South-East<br />
Asia. That battle is still being fought; so the need for a<br />
guarantee remains. That is why we must. be strong. That is why,<br />
we must prepare for war in the years of peace. Never in our history<br />
has an aggressor set foot on Australian-soil. But hostile aircraft<br />
bombed us in the north and we had enemy submarines in Sydney Harbor.<br />
It has been as close as that. Don't let us live in a " fool's<br />
paradise": We must not take risks. We must keep-. faith with the<br />
tradition of Anzac.<br />
I am proud to say that the va st-majority of Australians are<br />
keeping the faith. The young Australians who have served or are<br />
serving under the National Service Scheme are Anzacs through and<br />
through. There are no differences, nor distinction; between . them<br />
and the regular soldier. They have bean decorated in battle in<br />
Vietnam. They have served with courage.<br />
Ladies and Gentlemenon this Anzac Sunday our memories are with those<br />
who died on the land, on the sea, and in the air. We will never<br />
forget them. Our thoughts, too, are for their families. It is<br />
with humility and gratitude that we honor the Anzac today and we<br />
pledge ourselves that so far as it is within our mortal power<br />
to carry on in their tradition. " What they have left to us would<br />
enrich the proudest nation on earth." I thank you. </p>
