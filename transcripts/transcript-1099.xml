FOR PR~ ESS STATh'EENT BY THlE -PRD~ E MISTER<br />
VISIT TO CANBERRA BY MRii. CABOTI LODGE<br />
I have had with my senior Ministerial colleagues very<br />
valuable discussions this afternoon on the subject of Vietnam<br />
with the United States Special Ambassador, Mr. Cabot Lodge.<br />
Mr. Lodge is visiting Canberra at the instance of the<br />
President of the United States, and has brought with him the<br />
views of the President and the Administration; to these he<br />
has added his own detailed and first-hand knowledge of the<br />
siturition in Vietnam. As part of the exchange of views<br />
sought by Mr. Lodge, the Australian Ministers outlined our<br />
assessment of the situation.<br />
The discussions have provided a valuable addition to<br />
our common understanding and have contributed to the already<br />
very great degree of agreement between Australia and the<br />
United States on the question of the checking of aggression<br />
in Vietnam. Mr. Lodge conveyed the President's appreciation of<br />
the contribution which Australia has made in the economic<br />
and defence fields in South Vietnam.<br />
