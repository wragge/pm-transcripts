PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING MP AND<br />
THE DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER THE HON BRIAN HOWE MP, PRESS<br />
CONFERENCE, PARLIAMENT HOUSE, 20 JUNE 1995<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
PM: and he said that he will not be contesting his seat at the next Federal<br />
election, but wishes to continue in his portfolio and the Cabinet. I<br />
addressed the Caucus about his life and career in politics and the<br />
warmth and acclamation and recognition with which his contribution was<br />
greeted by the Caucus, I think, said all that needed to be said about the<br />
standing that Brian has had in the Party and in the Government. Before<br />
I invite Brian to speak let me just record a couple of things.<br />
I said of him and about him that he had been a major contributor to the<br />
Government over the period from 1983, he joined the Expenditure<br />
Review Committee which was basically the sorting house of priorities<br />
within the Government and held major social portfolios at a time when<br />
Government spending was being severely contracted. You might<br />
remember that the Government inherited a level of outlays over 30 per<br />
cent of GOP in 1983 and by 1990 that had declined to about 23.5 per<br />
cent. That is a tough time to be a Social Security and Health Minister.<br />
But, during that period, I think, we were able to say that through Brian's<br />
leadership and commitment, that not only was social policy raised to a<br />
much higher and more sophisticated level than had ever been<br />
contemplated in Australia before, but we had actually been able to<br />
support the people who we believe needed the support through a<br />
focused policy, a targeted policy with across the board measures, but,<br />
such things as the Family Allowance Supplement now called Additional<br />
Family Support and the path breaking body of the Child Support Agency<br />
where maintenance is collected through the tax system which is, I think,<br />
a world first and is now being looked at and emulated by other countries.<br />
Brian went on from there to the Health portfolio and then to Housing and<br />
Regional Development and, of course, the programs which he has<br />
become synonymous with ' Better Cities'. But, his commitment to the<br />
Government and his leadership in the ERC when as the most senior<br />
person in the Left in the Caucus and therefore Australia in the </p>
<p>Government, playing a role at that level meant that the Labor Party has<br />
had a unity about it that previous Labor governments never had. Not<br />
only unity, but a sense of common purpose and that sense of common<br />
purpose tracked its way down through the years to find, you know, the<br />
putting into place of not simply great economic reforms, but great social<br />
reforms to match them, to graft with them to make this both an efficient<br />
and equitable place.<br />
Brian's commitment to equity and to social justice has been profound,<br />
but also his commitment to economic efficiency and economic change is<br />
what has marked him out as a leader in the Left and why, I think, many<br />
people in the Left today take the view that you look at the Government<br />
as a totality and you look at its responsibilities as a totality. I have said<br />
to you before and it is worth repeating: I think one of the great changes<br />
in Australia in the years of the Labor Government has been to the Labor<br />
Party itself. Not many countries are able to see the complete<br />
reformation of one of its major parties to become the party of<br />
government, the party of economic change, the party of social reform,<br />
the party of nationalism, these are all the things that have happened to<br />
the Labor Party in the period 1983 to 1995 and that has come from a<br />
unity between the moderate Right centre sections of the Party and the<br />
Left coming together in a commitment of common cause, the likes of<br />
which the Australian Labor Party has never seen and it has been the<br />
foundations of our success.<br />
The fact that we can, in a way, contemplate now Brian's departure and<br />
his replacement, within the business of the Caucus an in-the-groove<br />
change, itself says a lot about the maturity of the Labor Party in<br />
Government and the way in which the Caucus acts and the strength that<br />
the Government has had through the foundation stone of the Caucus in<br />
having sensible, committed Caucus members right from that period<br />
from 1983 down to 1995.<br />
Brain's leadership in that, I said today in the Caucus, that Brian has held<br />
more effective power than any person in the Left in Australia probably<br />
ever. Certainly in the post war years, no leader of the Left has enjoyed<br />
more power in these major portfolios of Social Security, Community<br />
Services and Health, Housing and Community Services and, of course,<br />
crowning that as Deputy Prime Minister. For my part, I couldn't have<br />
asked for a more loyal or committed Deputy than Brian. We went<br />
through the last election with complete unity of purpose and we have<br />
ever since, but there comes a time in everybody's life where they decide<br />
that they don't want to contest another poll and to make that decision<br />
and make it forthrightly with their constituency and he felt that having<br />
made that decision that now was the best time to surrender the Deputy<br />
leadership to another person who was going to contest their seat at the<br />
next election. We both salute him and thank him for that.<br />
So, could I perhaps just wind up my remarks by saying that there was a<br />
tremendous amount of good will towards Brian and the Caucus today, </p>
<p>across factions because, I think, part of the commitment is Brian's<br />
commitment to social justice and the fact that he stands for something<br />
good and solid and fair and equitable and decent in this country and this<br />
community really counts well with that Caucus right across the board.<br />
There was, as there always is in any of these transitions, a little touch of<br />
melancholy about it, but again, for the change that it tells for the change<br />
to another Deputy leader, Deputy Prime Minister of this Labor<br />
Government, it is just another keystone in the continuity of the Labor<br />
Party and the Government which we have seen from that period. So, I<br />
would close my remarks now and just finally say that we will be holding a<br />
Caucus meeting this evening to fill the vacancy vacated by Brian and we<br />
will be, I might just also say, having another Caucus meeting tomorrow<br />
to receive a report from Gareth Evans. On those two notes of business,<br />
I hand over to Brian.<br />
BR: Thank you very much Paul, I made a decision that I would retire at the<br />
next election, hang up the Hansards as it were, and I thought the time<br />
had come to do that. I think, this nonsense about mergers in Victoria<br />
really has to be fought on a full time basis and the Hawthorn Football<br />
Club is certainly not going to be merged as long as I am associated with<br />
it the real issue. Apart from that I felt that once I had made that<br />
decision that the second decision flowed from that and that I should<br />
resign as Deputy and give the Party the opportunity to have a Deputy to<br />
to in together with the Prime Minister to fight an election that I think we<br />
can and will win and that, I think, really requires that degree of<br />
commitment that obviously someone who is about to retire, you can't<br />
really expect that. You can't be expected to do that, as much as I am<br />
very interested in the result and will be very much a part of the<br />
campaign. I continue in my portfolio and I hope that I will be able to<br />
bring together the work that we have been doing in housing and some<br />
associated urban areas of urban infrastructure in a month or so as a<br />
fairly major statement and I want to complete that work.<br />
I think, as Paul has said, my contribution to government has been very<br />
much in the area of social policy and I would hope that social policy now<br />
has a status and a standing that it didn't ever have before. When ever<br />
you did any social policy work it was described as a hand out, as a bit of<br />
trivia whereas, I think, now we recognise that Australia has one of the<br />
most sophisticated social security systems in the world. That in terms of<br />
our understanding of the links between social security and for example,<br />
the labour market, so-called active social security policy, we were one of<br />
the first countries in the world to comprehensively develop that policy.<br />
That in terms of a whole range of areas of social policy we have been<br />
able to not only bring about reform, but in the context of fiscal restraint<br />
that produced Thatcherism in Britain which was described as inhumane<br />
as vindictive, as having an enormous impact on lower income people, on<br />
poorer regions in Britain, we never had any of that in Australia, I think,<br />
because we had decent and respectable and reformist social policy and<br />
I think over time we have been able to develop social policy in a whole<br />
range of areas that have been quite, I think, path breaking and Australia </p>
<p>has an enormous reputation in the OECD as a country of very, very<br />
significant reform in the area of social policy. The fact that we produce<br />
an annual Social Justice Statement as part of the Budget, may seem<br />
some small thing, but effectively it means that the Government allows<br />
itself to be judged in each Budget in terms of its record and, I think, that<br />
increasingly we are showing that social policy is the partner of economic<br />
policy. I think, working with the Prime Minister and before that the Treasurer,<br />
has been for me a great experience. I think, as I said to Caucus<br />
because the Prime Minister has always taken when he was Treasurer<br />
and now as Prime Minister the long view, his interest is not in<br />
opportunist politics, it is in fundamental reform and fundamental<br />
economic reform. But, of course, fundamental economic reform presents<br />
great social challenges and, I think, the task of time has been to match<br />
economic with social and, I think, this Government has now established<br />
a unity of purpose in terms of economic and social policy, which means it<br />
is identified significantly with fairness and with the best Australian values<br />
that I think are the best that Australia has. And so I think that this is the<br />
time in which to make that decision to move on and I suppose as<br />
someone who is identified with the Left, I would say that I leave with the<br />
show in very much better shape than when I started and that to me, as<br />
someone who is very committed to Left wing politics, is a matter of great<br />
pleasure. I think we have got a lot to contribute to the Caucus and to<br />
Governments in the future and I suppose that is my final point, which is<br />
simply to say that one of the strengths of this Government is that it is<br />
refurbishing and rebuilding and strengthening and when you look around<br />
the Caucus this morning, you think my God there is a lot Ministers out<br />
there that still aren't part of a Labor Government and I am going to be<br />
working very hard to see that they become Ministers in future Labor<br />
Governments.<br />
PM: Well I think both of us will be happy to take questions.<br />
J: Mr Howe when did you decide not to contest the next election, what<br />
contributed to that decision and whose views did you take into account?<br />
BH: Well, essentially, the Prime Minister's views I suppose. I mean the<br />
Prime Minister and I have been talking about it over recent weeks.<br />
I hadn't made a decision until last night and I made a decision then,<br />
I think, because we felt this was the right time to resolve the matter and<br />
to resolve it in the way we have just done in the Caucus.<br />
J: Mr Howe there has been a degree of speculation about your departure<br />
for some time. Have you felt under any pressure, whatsoever?<br />
BH: Oh well I think you are not insensitive to what comments occur.<br />
I suppose I, of all people, tend to be very sensitive. But, at the same<br />
time, I think you know that there is a job to do and I came into the<br />
Federal Parliament to pursue reform and I have had the opportunity to </p>
<p>do that over a long period of time and I have got the opportunity to<br />
complete the reforms in this current Parliament and I intend to do that.<br />
And I have always tried to put what people say behind me and<br />
concentrate on what I think is the main game and that is reform. I think it<br />
is what you leave behind you, that really is important.<br />
J: Mr Howe back to your first answer, are you saying that the<br />
Prime Minister influenced you into your resignation?<br />
BH: No I wasn't saying that.<br />
PM: Michelle [ Grattan] will always look for the most difficult question.<br />
J: Well could you elaborate on what you were saying when you said the<br />
Prime Minister was the main influence?<br />
BH: Well I had contemplated the possibility of retiring at the next election.<br />
I thought I couldn't make that decision independently of the Government,<br />
even though that is a decision for the Victorian Branch, so I took it up<br />
with the Prime Minister and we have had several conversations over a<br />
couple of weeks. We finally made the decision last night.<br />
J: Mr Keating will you take the opportunity now to reshuffle your Ministry?<br />
PM: Probably not. I think people are doing quite well and the Government's<br />
performing, as I said, we have had more changes in the last month, than<br />
we saw out of two decades of Coalition Government. The Budget in<br />
surplus, they never got a surplus once, a Justice Statement, a framework<br />
for the Republic. We are having another meeting on the Accord<br />
tomorrow, with the prospect of another Accord Mark ViII which will mean<br />
that this is the only Party in Australia able to deliver a low inflation rate<br />
and keep it there. I think, by any measure, the Government is working<br />
as well as it has worked at any time since 1983.<br />
J: Who do you support as Mr Howe's successor?<br />
PM: Well that is a matter for the Caucus, not for me.<br />
J: Do you accept that anyone who succeeds Mr Howe could rightly see<br />
themselves as your ultimate successor when you decide to retire?<br />
PM: No I don't think so. I think there has been no pattern whatsoever to the<br />
Labor leadership. But, of course, it has always been mostly about<br />
leadership in Opposition, not leadership in Government and I think this<br />
is what has marked this period out to be different. But there has never<br />
been a pattern to it and I don't think you can ever induce one.<br />
J: Mr Keating why shouldn't this move be seen as clearing the decks for an<br />
election? </p>
<p>PM: Because I mean you, Glen [ Milne], amongst others, have been reporting<br />
an early election now since 15 months ago, haven't you? And there still<br />
isn't one.<br />
J: Will you now rule one out Mr Keating?<br />
PM: Well I have said before only if a Prime Minister who has these options<br />
would be foolish to rule for, in this case, myself, himself, out of a<br />
discretion which the Prime Minister in this system always enjoys. But<br />
there..<br />
J: It is not what we are reporting.<br />
PM: Yes, I know. No you have been reporting early elections and<br />
John Hewson said there were early elections and there was going to be<br />
an election. Alexander Downer said there was an early election and I<br />
think we have seen in recent weeks and months speculation about an<br />
early election. When many of you thought the Government wouldn't<br />
jump the Budget hurdle. When we did jump it, you didn't say good jump,<br />
you said " early election". You were wrong and if you write it tomorrow,<br />
you'll be wrong again.<br />
J: Mr Keating when Mr Howe approached you at first and said he was<br />
thinking of stepping down, did you encourage him to do so then?<br />
PM: No, I take the view this: Brian and I have lived as Ministers in this<br />
Government now for 12-odd years, that is a very long time. It is longer<br />
than any other group of Labor Ministers have lived with one another in<br />
work and in respect and given the pace of the Government, two Budgets<br />
a year virtually for every year it has been in office, major policy changes,<br />
for 12 years of our partnership has-been like 20 or 30 years in the days<br />
of the Coalition, in terms of work, activities, probably more. Let me not<br />
put a discount through that, probably half a century. And, therefore, you<br />
know because of the engagement and the work and the frenetic pace of<br />
it, you know May Statements every year up to 1991, bar one, Budgets,<br />
big contextual social policy changes, then the big statements we have<br />
had since budgets One Nation, Working Nation, Investing in the Nation<br />
all these other changes and now Brian's stewardship of some of these<br />
areas which formerly the Commonwealth hasn't been involved with, with<br />
Better Cities etc, housing, choice. We have had a lot to do with one<br />
another over the years and you get to that point where we went to the<br />
1993 election together and we succeeded at a poll, it has been my view,<br />
it's entirely a matter then for Brian to decide what he wanted to do and a<br />
matter of his discretion, without any prompting from any one of us<br />
including and, perhaps, especially me. So I never, at any stage, raised<br />
the Deputy Leadership with Brian, he raised it with me, and I wouldn't<br />
have.<br />
J: Mr Keating when Caucus selects Mr Howe's successor, what should<br />
they give the most weight to, seniority or electoral appeal? </p>
<p>PM: Well you had better get on the telephone and ring around and ask them<br />
what they think?<br />
J: Mr Howe it is probably likely the Left won't retain the Deputy Prime<br />
Ministership. Do you accept that and do you think the Left should seek<br />
any other compensation for losing the Deputy Prime Ministership, if that<br />
happens?<br />
BH: I think that we should choose in Caucus tonight who we think is the best<br />
person to do this job at this particular point in time. In terms of the<br />
positioning of the Left faction I think that occurs not around one<br />
particular position, or one element of policy, but it occurs in a broader<br />
context and you know I think the approach is not going to hang on the<br />
particular decision the Caucus makes today. It will take account,<br />
no doubt, of where that falls tonight. But then look to the next round of<br />
decisions, maybe the policy stance on some issue. So I just don't think<br />
that you can look at each position and each change in quite that way.<br />
J: Are you happy with the level of representation of the Left in the Cabinet<br />
and in the Ministry?<br />
BH: Well I think we would always like to do better. I think we started off in<br />
1983 with one Left Minister out of, whatever it was, 17. And today we<br />
have four Ministers in Cabinet. But, more importantly, I think not just in<br />
the Left, I think there is this enormous youth and enthusiasm and vigour<br />
and intelligence that is there in the Caucus. So that I think, certainly,<br />
following the next election there will be an opportunity for us to put<br />
together an even more talented Government than we currently have.<br />
J: Prime Minister could you comment on the Paris talks?<br />
PM: Well just to say I was quite disappointed by the fact that the French<br />
seem immobile about their decision. Gareth Evans will be coming back<br />
giving a report to the Cabinet. We will be holding a Cabinet meeting to<br />
receive that report and also report to the Caucus. I think we will<br />
probably say more about it then.<br />
