AUSTRALIA DAY MESSAGE<br />
Australia Day is an occasion for all of us to think about what<br />
Australia means to us, and the opportunities and challenges of the<br />
coming year. We can make 1983 a year of real achievement. We<br />
have the resources and the ability to succeed, but it-will only<br />
be a year of achievement if we meet difficulties with a strong<br />
sense of unity, realism, and determination, and if we make the<br />
most of the opportunities this year will offer.<br />
Provided we are realistic about the recession we can work our<br />
way through it and build a stronger and more vibrant Australia.<br />
But we cannot just sit back and wait for help from other<br />
countries. What we have to do is get out and do for ourselves<br />
the things which are really going to help Australia.<br />
One of the most important things we must do is make sure wie getfull<br />
benefits of the wage pause. By itself the pause will not<br />
revitalise our economy but it is providing opportunities, and<br />
very real assistance. For example, from the savings in Commonweal1th<br />
wages alone, the pause is providing $ 300 million for construct iv. e<br />
activities which will help create new jobs. $ 100 million is<br />
going into welfare housing, and this will help boost employment<br />
in the building industry. $ 100 million will be used specifically<br />
to help young people who are trying to get jobs, and the other<br />
$ 100 million will help older unemployed people who have been<br />
displaced from the. workforce. Those policies are giving help<br />
to people who really need it. Every Commonwealth public servant<br />
can see that the money which would have gone to him or her as a<br />
wage increase is now providing jobs for other Australians.<br />
The wage pause will also provide pxrivate enterprise with an<br />
opportunity to become more profitable and more competitive,<br />
especially in overseas markets. * Provided this opportunity<br />
is grasped, Australian firms will be able to grow, and create<br />
permanent new jobs. We must have a strong and profitable private<br />
sector to keep building the kind of Australia we want,-tar t'-; e<br />
private sector is the real source of our prosperity, and it is<br />
where mrost jobs come from.<br />
There area number of other things we need to do to improve conditions<br />
in Australia. We must demonstrate that driver and energy which hs.<br />
enabled Australians to win wars and overcome depression. ./ 2 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
We must get out and obtain a bigger share of existing markets<br />
and find new markets. This means we have got to produce our goods<br />
more effectively. It means our industries and firms must take<br />
imaginative forward looking decisions. It means above<br />
all we have got to produce what people want, especially for<br />
markets overseas.<br />
Secondly, our enterprises need o take greater advantage of<br />
new technology. Better technol,. gy will enable us to compete<br />
effectively. It will give us th. ability to produce the products<br />
people want, and it will allm.~ us to make the best use of Austra'lia's<br />
great natural advantages.<br />
Thirdly, we need to look close I at what governments can do,<br />
especially at a time when thex is less private investment in<br />
the development of Australia. rhe Government has already<br />
taken action by increasing sicj Lficantly spending on capital<br />
works. We have launched the Bicentenn. al Road Develor-ent Programme which<br />
will greatly improve transport. We have made the decision to<br />
complete the Darwin/ Alice Sp~ rings Railway in 1988, and most<br />
recently we have embarked on a major 5.-year bicentennial programmne<br />
to conserve and develop Australia's very scarce water supplies.<br />
We will also be funding a full investigation into whether rivers<br />
in northern NSW and Queensland could be turned inland to water<br />
our dry, sparse continent. We are resolved to test this age<br />
old dream to see if it can be turned into reality for our<br />
children. These measures will provide more jobs, they will<br />
encourage economic activity and they will provide the foundation<br />
for future development.<br />
As we look ahead through 1983 and beyond, these are just somie<br />
of the things we need to do to create the sort of Australia wie<br />
allwant: an Australia with rising living standards, which can<br />
provide greater security and which can create more<br />
opportunities for all Australians. But we cannot create the<br />
future we want for our children by waiting for a world<br />
economic recovery. We can't wait for the world. If world<br />
recovery does come, that will be a bonus. We have to do the<br />
job ourselves. we must get a bigger share of the action<br />
for Australia.<br />
Every Australian has a part to play. I know people often think<br />
that what they do as individuals doesn't matter. ' But it<br />
matters enormously, because what we'achieve as a nation is no<br />
more than the sum total. of what we achieve as individuals.<br />
Australia is nothing without the contributions and the efforts<br />
of every Australian. This is why making 1983 a year of<br />
positive achievement is a task and responsibility which we all<br />
share. I have the greatest confidence that we not only call<br />
make the effort required but that we will make it.<br />
