WESTERN AUSTRALIAN DEFENCE PROJECTS<br />
The Prime Minister has written to Sir Charles Court outlining<br />
details of the proposed upgrading of defence installations<br />
in Western Australia, and thanking him for his assurances<br />
of co-operation in the development of Australia's defence<br />
capacity. The projects are:<br />
Develop HMAS Stirling for base porting by 1982<br />
arid home porting by 1986 at an estimated cost<br />
of $ 26 million;<br />
Develop the existing airfield at Learmonth with<br />
an expected operational readiness in 1982 at an<br />
estimated cost of $ 3 million;<br />
Develop a new airfield at Derby with an expected<br />
operational readiness in 1984 at an estimated cost<br />
of $ 47 million;<br />
Develop an amphibious training area with an expected<br />
operational readiness in 1981/ 82 at an estimated<br />
cost of $ 2 million;.<br />
Develop Army stores facilities at Guildford with an<br />
expected completion in 1985/ 86 at an estimated<br />
cost of $ 3 million.<br />
During discussions in the United States the Government<br />
expressed a willingness to make Australian bases and facilities<br />
available to assist the United States in deterring the<br />
expansion of Soviet influence in the Indian Ocean.<br />
The question of home porting or base porting in West * ern<br />
Australia of elements of the United States Navy was among.<br />
the questions discussed. The United States is considering<br />
this option.<br />
If the United States accepts the Australian offer there will be<br />
a need for considerable investment in Western Australia on the<br />
part of both the Australian Government and the United States.<br />

There would be much detail that would need examination<br />
and consultation between the United States and Australia.<br />
Western Australia would of course by fully consulted.<br />
Western Australia's capacity for engineering and technical<br />
back-up will be taken fully into account in the Government's<br />
planning for defence activity and development in<br />
Western Australia.<br />
In particular, the increase in the level of operations out<br />
of HMAS Stirling will add substantially to the nature and<br />
level of demand for technical capacity in Western Australia.<br />
