    <content><![CDATA[<p>I announced on Sunday 26 March that, in response to a short-term need we identified from discussions with those on the ground, the Australian Government would reimburse any excise paid on diesel or petrol fuel used by businesses, including farmers, and households that are generating their own electricity until normal services are restored.  I am pleased that power is being progressively restored to many thousands of households and hope that those who remain without power will have it restored as quickly as possible.</p>
<p> While it remains open for people to submit receipts, I have determined that the administratively easier and quicker approach is that anyone who states they have used fuel for the purposes of power generation will be eligible for an excise relief payment backdated to the day Tropical Cyclone Larry hit (20 March).  The payments made by Centrelink will be as follows:</p>
<p> ú</p>
<p>$280 per month where a household is without reliable electricity</p>
<p> ú</p>
<p>$560 per month where a business is without reliable electricity.</p>
<p> These payments will be tax free.  We expect that payments will begin to be made by Friday.  People who have a higher rate of fuel use can still claim on the basis of actual fuel usage but processing will be slower than the flat-rate option.  Where businesses or private homes using diesel generators are receiving diesel excise relief under the Energy Grants Credit Scheme, they would not be able to claim a second time under this new measure.</p>
<p>   This excise relief is in addition to the package of over $100 million of financial assistance from the Australian Government I announced last week.</p>
<p> After witnessing the devastation first hand, I promised that the Australian Government would continue to monitor the situation and do what we could for the communities affected by Tropical Cyclone Larry.  That is what we are doing.  Last Friday morning, for example, the Mayor of Johnstone Shire identified a need for a further Centrelink one-stop shop in Mission Beach.  Before lunch that day we had established a presence on the ground in south Mission Beach.  We will continue to respond appropriately as particular needs arise.</p>
<p>   I spoke this morning to General Peter Cosgrove regarding the relief and recovery effort. I will remain in regular touch with him. I commend the job he is doing.</p>
<p> I commend the tireless work of our Australian emergency services and volunteers, the police and the Australian Defence Force for the tremendous job they are doing to relieve the suffering of our fellow Australians.</p>
