FOR MEDIA 3 February 1984<br />
The attached letter was telexed today to the Queensland<br />
Premier, Mr. Bjelke-Petersen. </p>
<p>* The lion. J. Bjelke-Petersen MLA,<br />
Premier oZ Queensland,<br />
BRISBAN~ E * QLD 4000.<br />
My dear Premier,<br />
I refer to the Prime Minister's telex of 29 January,<br />
suggesting an additional item in the terms of reference<br />
for the general review by the Commonwealth Grants<br />
Commission, and to my conversation with you and Mr. Leo<br />
Hielscher. I confirm my view that the offer of $ 35 million per annum<br />
will be a bonus for Queensland, because it is over an~ d<br />
above the compensation that will be paid for the revenue<br />
lost by Queensland and any additional costs. In my view,<br />
this offer is extremely generous.<br />
I am pleased that you have indicated your prepa-cedness to<br />
accept the Commonwealth's suggestion of a special term of<br />
reference being included in the forthcoming general review<br />
by the Commonwealth Grants Commission.<br />
I am, however, disappointed to note that your latest telex<br />
does not reflect the conversation that I had with Mr. Leo<br />
Hielscher relating to the offer referred to in paragraph 2<br />
above. In the course of that conversation Mr. Hielscher<br />
disputed the facts as outlined in paragraph 2 hereof and<br />
assured me that this would be specifically referred to in<br />
your foreshadowed reply. I am disappointed to note that tChe<br />
lengthy reply does not refer to this specific matter and<br />
purports to raise a number of other issues which were never<br />
discussed. In an effort to speedily assist you I have had your<br />
proposals further examined by my colleagues the Treasurer<br />
and the Minister for Health. The Commonwealth is prepared<br />
to accept the thrust of your proposal for this clause, with<br />
one amendment. We suggest that the term of reference be as<br />
follows: . The Commission should also indicate whether<br />
Commonwealth payments under Medicare in respect<br />
of the Queensland Public Hospital System disturb<br />
the financial relativities that existed between<br />
Queensland and the other States immediately prior<br />
to the introduction of Medicare. Should the<br />
Commission conclude that CommonwAealth payments<br />
under Medicare will result in a disturbance to<br />
Queensland's relativity, the Commission should / 2 </p>
<p>2.<br />
indicate the extent if the financial ad justment<br />
t'-hat is necessary to restore Qaersland to its<br />
previous position."<br />
I appreciate Queensland's concern that any necessary<br />
adjustments arising out of the special term of reference<br />
should not take five or six years to implement. The<br />
Commonwealth will consider the Grants Commission's report<br />
on this matter, and reach a decision on it at the June 1985<br />
Premiers' Conference.<br />
With respect to the othe r proposals in your telex, the<br />
Commonwealth cannot agree to these in the context of the signing<br />
of the Agreement. These are matters that ought to be the<br />
subject of consideration and negotiation in the light of the<br />
Grants Commission report.<br />
In the meantime, I do not believe that Queensland will be<br />
adversely affected by the proposed arrangements. The<br />
Queensland Government will suffer no net revenue loss or<br />
additional cost under the Medicare arrangements, and will<br />
receive as a bonus an addition to State revenue of $ 35 million.<br />
This payment will ensure that Queensland receives slightly<br />
more than Queenslanders will be paying through the Medicare<br />
levy and associated measures.<br />
I hope that we are now in a position q~ uickly to sign the<br />
Agreement, which will allow the Medicare grants to apply<br />
from 1 February 1984.<br />
Yours sincerely,<br />
( Lionel Bowen) </p>
