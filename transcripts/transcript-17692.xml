It's a great honour to be here today.</p>
<p>And I warmly acknowledge the Governor-General because it was her predecessor Lord Gowrie who opened this building 70 years ago and she very appropriately stands in his footsteps today.</p>
<p>Lord Gowrie, our longest serving Governor-General, was himself a holder of the Victoria Cross and a soldier of exceptional gallantry.</p>
<p>He opened this building to commemorate one terrible war in the darkest days of another.</p>
<p>In 1964, it was another Governor-General and VC holder, Lord D'Lisle, who opened the original version of this hall, known as VC Corner.</p>
<p>Again, Australia was at war.</p>
<p>A war that Keith Payne and his mates remember all too well.</p>
<p>And, of course, Her Excellency has been the first Governor-General in 40 years to confer the Victoria Cross as yet again, our nation finds itself at arms in the cause of security and freedom.</p>
<p>There could be no-one more appropriate to open this display and I thank Ms Bryce for her words and her presence here today.</p>
<p>She has done this occasion great honour.</p>
<p>Friends,</p>
<p>The vice-regal connection is a sign of continuity and abiding purpose unchanged since the day Lord Gowrie opened this building 70 years ago.</p>
<p>In his opening remarks, Gowrie posed this most enduring of questions: </p>
<p>âWhen we read the names inscribed on the walls of this memorial ... let us ask ourselves:</p>
<p>what can we do for those who did so much</p>
<p>what can we give to those who gave us all?â</p>
<p>His answer  -  the only possible answer  -  was to ensure their sacrifices were not in vain.</p>
<p>We do that by remembering.</p>
<p>The simple gift that every Australian can offer, no matter what their means, no matter what their background.</p>
<p>It is a sobering fact that 95 of the 98 VC winners are no longer with us.</p>
<p>Their deeds are immortal.</p>
<p>But they are not.</p>
<p>Age wearies.</p>
<p>The years take their toll.</p>
<p>And so we must remember.</p>
<p>We remember, foremost, in the shrine of our hearts.</p>
<p>We remember each time we pass a memorial in streets of our suburb and towns.</p>
<p>In the Anzac Day ceremonies held in even the smallest one-teacher school.</p>
<p>When the Last Post echoes and chills our spines.</p>
<p>And  -  above all  -  we remember here at the nation's pre-eminent temple of honour the Australian War Memorial.</p>
<p>John Curtin called this place âthe sanctuary of Australia's traditionsâ and I am personally committed to ensuring it remains so.</p>
<p>It is here that we come to contemplate the high price of war.</p>
<p>It is here we come also to honour the valour that comes with conflict because it is a remarkable and consistent fact that great battles elicit great courage; when ordinary men find it in themselves to do extraordinary things.</p>
<p>There are no words or symbols that can really honour their courage, but as humans we grasp for tokens that somehow express what we feel.</p>
<p>In a proud tradition, drawn from our British heritage, we in this Commonwealth have used the Victoria Cross and its sister award, the George Cross to express the nation's debt.</p>
<p>They are simple tokens of metal and cloth that express a profound inward reality.</p>
<p>And they deserve the veneration of our people.</p>
<p>From a modest space not much bigger than a broom closet opened by Lord D'Lisle in 1964 the Memorial and its architect have created a worthy home; wrought in lasting materials of stone and bronze that convey dignity and a modest grace.</p>
<p>The location is also eloquent:</p>
<p>Above us stands the Hall of Memory, embodying the unbroken link between courage and sacrifice.</p>
<p>There is another axis too, and that is the axis connecting this memorial to Parliament across the lake.</p>
<p>That too is no accident... because in a democracy, military service is an expression of citizenship.</p>
<p>Of free men and women who love their country and are willing to pay any price to serve it.</p>
<p>The 102,000 who made the supreme sacrifice  -  including Sapper Jamie Larcombe just two days ago.</p>
<p>A mother's son resting above us whose name we will never know.</p>
<p>And the 107 names inscribed in this Hall of Valour, which we dedicate to the nation today.</p>
<p>With gratitude.</p>
<p>With honour.</p>
<p>With everlasting remembrance. </p>
