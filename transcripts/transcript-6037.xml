PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA-MONDAY, 28 FEBRUARY .1983<br />
LABOR'S CENTRALJISM<br />
It is clear that a Labor Government would centralise power<br />
in Canberra and ride rough-shod over the States,<br />
Mr Hawke has made his attitude quite plain. He has said that<br />
he believes " that Australidns would be better served by the<br />
elimination of ( State) Government<br />
His Deputy, Mr Bowen, was equally derogatory about S tate's<br />
rigjhts wh! en he spoke on Wednesday of the " nonsense of<br />
contradi~ ctory State rights and ' State jealouosies'.<br />
Mr Hawels comxents, in speaking to Queenslanders on Queensland<br />
television, three weeks ago, that he will not be a<br />
person who tries to impose decisions upon Queensland or any<br />
other State" are without credibility.<br />
He spoke on that occasion with one voice and yet at other<br />
times, he has spo~ en with a different voice.<br />
He has already made it clear that he will impose decisions<br />
upon-Western Australia and Tasmania,<br />
As late as yesterday, Mr Hawke declared his intention to<br />
intervene in South-West Tasmania and ov! erride the decision<br />
of the State Government.<br />
Thebuildingof the doirdon-below-Franklin dam, whatever we<br />
may think of it, is directly a matter for the State, Even<br />
Mr Hayden recognisea this when he wrote in a letter 18 months<br />
ago that " bhe main fundamental matters of cconcern are very<br />
much a State responsibility and outside ( if the constitutiollal<br />
authority of the national Governiment".<br />
The Constitution is a solemn contract which sets down the<br />
various responsibilities between the State and Comrmonwealth<br />
Goverrjrents and the balance of power between them.<br />
The only way it can be altered is by the delibercate decisiQl<br />
of the people.<br />
Mr Hawke seems determined to ignore this fundamental Safeguard.<br />
He seeks to use the external affairs power of the Cornionwealth<br />
inl a way quite uripre ceden ted to override the rights of the State. </p>
<p>The external affairs power comnes into operation when the<br />
Conunonwealth Goverrnment. accedes to art international treaty or<br />
convent ion. Mv Haws-e has said that he wants to use the<br />
authority that the Co o-nwoealth attracts by acceding to a<br />
treaty to overvide thie State Governmnent,<br />
This would set a precedent of the most dangerous Kind.<br />
Linder Mr Hawke's view, a Comonwealth Covernnment, could sign<br />
any treaty with any country on any matter and thereby attract<br />
the authority to override a decision of a State Government.<br />
That is socialism, at its worst.<br />
The other assertion that Kr H-awke has made in respect f h* 411<br />
Commvronwealth's power to intervene is that a Labor Gover~ ne~ t<br />
could uise a tied grant to ( jet its way, even a condition ettgh~<br />
to a grant which bore no relationship to the subject mat er<br />
of the grant, and that is what Mr-Hawke h-as suggested,<br />
If oiie looks at holw Mr Whitlc= v sought, to centralise powe cr<br />
of the principal mfechanisms used then was the use of sp cifTh<br />
purpose grants under S96 of the Con) stitution, That was<br />
dangerous enough.<br />
But when Mr: Hawke suggested on Tasm. a-nian radio on 11 F'ebruary<br />
that he may uIse the provision of tied grants to Tasmania to<br />
force the Tasmanians not to proceed with the dam, he was going<br />
ver y much further indeed.<br />
H-e was in) fact saying that a Labor Govercnpient would be prepared<br />
to use its powers under S96 of the Constitution to interfere<br />
in any State matter.<br />
That would put to an end the balance of Federal-State relations<br />
and destroy Federalism in Australia. 000----</p>
