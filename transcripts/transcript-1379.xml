ST. STEPHEN'S DAY CELEBRATIONS<br />
PADDINGTON TOWN HALL,-SYDNEY AUGUST. 1966<br />
Speech by the Prime Minister, Mr Harold Holt<br />
Mr Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen:<br />
This is for me a very happy arnd stirring occasion because<br />
: I come to you both as the present Head of the Australian Government and<br />
also, as our Chairman has reminded you, as the former Minister, who<br />
can regard himself in a sense as the godfather of many of you in this room<br />
tonight. I have had now, many years of service as the head of a<br />
Department in an Australian Government, altogether, I suppose, about<br />
18 or 19 years. Seven of those years were spen! with the portfolio of<br />
Immigration and I don't recall any time in my public life which gave me<br />
a warmer and richer sense of satisfaction than those years I 3pent as<br />
Minister of that portfolio, helping to build the Australian nation that<br />
is progressing year by year into the promising future that awaits us.<br />
Now this function tonight is, I think, a very happy<br />
expression of the blending into the Australian community life of the<br />
traditions, the customs, the cherished recollections of many<br />
nationalities who have come to settle in this country. I know that for<br />
the Hungarian people, the celebration of St. Stephen's Day is an<br />
occasion of great significance, an occasion of intimate recollection,<br />
perhaps even nostalgic recollection of the history of a people who have<br />
contributed so much in the history of mankind to the development of<br />
the human personality. Although many of you today are fully Australian, both<br />
in the legal sense and in the sense of the full adoption of your new<br />
country, we can think of you for the purposes of our gathering here<br />
tonight as the Hungarian community in Australia. And here you are<br />
recollecting the things that help to build character and personality<br />
hope in the years that were with you before and in ihe years that are<br />
with you in your adopted homeland.<br />
Now one could imagine that in a less favourable<br />
environment a national community such as the Hungarians might have<br />
wanted to conduct an occasion such as this exclusively to themselves,<br />
but it is a mark of your own feeling of Australian citizenship that you<br />
gladly welcome into this gathering the head of the Australian Government,<br />
other Parliamentary representatives and many Australian friends. Now<br />
we appreciate this. You may recall, some of you, that several years ago,<br />
as Minister for Immigration, I was at a gathering at which the<br />
Hungarians were represented and the other national groups in the<br />
community life of Sydney, and I said then that they must not imagine that<br />
we Australians of native birth in any way resented the fact that the<br />
national groups should maintain their customs and their traditions, sing<br />
the songs of their country, and preserve those things which they cherish<br />
from their former homeland. Now we meant that, and I remember<br />
illustrating that comment with a reference to the Scots in Australia, and<br />
no-one could wear weirder costumes than the Scots. Certainly no-one<br />
could play weirder music than the Scots and yet Australians had managed<br />
to tolerate them very satisfactorily for many years.<br />
The Hungarians, of course, have their own special<br />
attributes. I was told many years ago that the most beautiful women / 2 </p>
<p>-2<br />
in the* Worlcanie from Hungary. ( Applause) I don't want to lose too<br />
many Australian votes by saying that the Aussie girls can't match the<br />
Hungarian girls, but i. am quite certain that we have lost nothing from<br />
your presence as a continuing element in our midst.<br />
Now it is a stirring thought, ladies and gentlemen, that<br />
in the Australia of today, one in every five is either a migrant of the<br />
post-war period or a child born to migrant parents. Indeed, if you take<br />
the younger age groups in this country, one in every four is a migrant<br />
of this post-war period. One in every four in employment in our<br />
manufacturing industry. One in five of the work force of the nation.<br />
This constitutes a very considerable addition to our national strength, but<br />
also in subtle and sometimes undiscernible ways, personalities, the<br />
traditions and habits of life of those who have come to join us are making<br />
their impact on the life of the Australian people. I speak as a fourth<br />
generation Australian when I say I think it is a very much pleasanter life that<br />
we enjoy today because of the variety that has been brought to us by so many<br />
national groups who have come to join our community in these post-war years.<br />
In that influence, the music, the culture, the science and the<br />
skills of the Hungarian people have also made a significant contribution.<br />
Tonight you celebrate an influence in your lives which has<br />
been something moulding character, something which has served as an<br />
inspiration over the centuries for the Hungarian people in order to<br />
preserve an identity, an identity through centuries of domination; whether<br />
that domination lasted for a short or long period of time, it has sought at<br />
times to crush the spirit of the Hungarian people and their own traditions.<br />
And yet such has been the strength of character, the toughness of fibre<br />
of' the people of Hungary that you have preserved that entity and the<br />
traditions which you are cherishing here tonight.<br />
We, your fellow Australians, can rejoice with you in an<br />
occasion which is moving to you and because of that becomes significant<br />
for us. The things which St. Stephen worked for and brought into your<br />
country are to be found in their own form in this country of ours. He was<br />
a great statesman, a great reformer. He was devoted to his people. He<br />
gave them a religious fervour and faith which has withstood the test of<br />
pressures through the centuries. It is proper that the memory of this<br />
great man, influencing the development of your national history should<br />
be honoured in this way. We in Australia can't point, in the life of our<br />
own country, to centuries of history and tradition. Those of us who come<br />
of British stock, even if we are removed, as I am, by three generations<br />
as a fourth generation Australian, we still have a heritage which has<br />
shaped the institutions of this country, and I believe that you, too, have<br />
come to appreciate that democratic heritage.<br />
Here you can breathe the air of freedom. Here you can find<br />
opportunity. Here you have found the incentive which has enabled you to<br />
build a life, a prosperous life, a happy life, a secure life in the community<br />
of Australian people. Because you and we cherish that spirit of freedom,<br />
we are determined to play our part in its preservation, either inside our<br />
own country, or if the challenge comes outside our shores. The Australian<br />
people in two world wars fought on European soil and suffered nearly<br />
half a million cas~ ualties in the cause of freedom. So it is not surprising<br />
that at this time Australian men, some of them of Hungarian origin, are now<br />
in Viet Nam, fighting again for the cause.<br />
Freedom extends to our institutions. We can point to free<br />
elections. W can point to a free press. But we must always remember<br />
that freedom is never free in the sense that freedom can be preserved<br />
without cost. And some of you in this room tonight fought a battle for<br />
/ 3 </p>
<p>-3<br />
freedom, and you went into exile from your own country only when it was<br />
clear that if you did not, freedom could not be preserved.<br />
I remember very vividly in 1957 going in Austria to the<br />
border and watching the points across which there were still many<br />
Hungarians coming. I went to the camps in which there were still<br />
many Hungarian refugees seeking a new homeland, and it was as the<br />
result of the arrangements that we were then able to make that some<br />
14, 000 of you came to this country. And what was Hungary's loss<br />
became Australia's gain.<br />
You have shown a high sense of responsibility in the<br />
country of your adoption. I don't think I know any national group which<br />
has a higher proportion of its settlers taking up naturalisation inside<br />
Australia. I have had through my time as Prime Minister, and then<br />
through the years, the longer years as Minister for Immigration, no<br />
cause that I can recall to regret, through any episode which has occurred,<br />
that we should have welcomed so many of you here. You have done well,<br />
you have behaved as responsible, contributing citizens to Ai~ stralian causes<br />
and we value your presence with us.<br />
The ideals which St. S t ephen gave you, you have cherished<br />
with us and they have contributed to our own Australian way of life, and it<br />
is the hope of myself and my colleagues that over the years ahead you will<br />
continue to find happiness with us, that your prosperity will march with<br />
the prosperity of the Australian nation. A grea~ t Australian Governor-<br />
General in the person of Viscount Slim, whom some of you will remember,<br />
wrote to me recently and said, " What a fascinating time to be Prime<br />
Minister of Australia" and what a fascinating time to be part of Australia,<br />
part of its growth, part of its promise, part of the years, the shining years<br />
which we see ahead of us, because we have every confidence that given<br />
freedom from war, given opportunities for the development of our national<br />
resources, this country will become one of the leading nations of the world.<br />
Wc have no wish to lead or to be in the rating of leadership<br />
or amongst the leading nations simply for selfish ends. We know that<br />
left to ourselves, we can build a life a happy life, but there are<br />
responsibilities, and we haven't shrunk from them whether in the military<br />
field or in the field of international aid, and perhaps the events of the psist<br />
few days in Viet Nam are symbolic of the Australia of the future. Brave<br />
men serving their country with devotion, skill and courage, and helpirgto<br />
build the greater Australia of the years ahead.<br />
Now in that growth and greatness, your community will be<br />
playing its part. It will be helping us with the variety which comes from<br />
centuries of culture in which we have had no part, but you can become part<br />
and your traditions can become part of that Australian nation made up of<br />
people of many nationalities. I believe we have succeeded in avoiding<br />
some of the problems and errors which developed inside the United States.<br />
We studied what had happened with their migration programme and we<br />
applied those lessons in the development of our own, So it is that we have<br />
had far fewer social problems, far fewer nati;-mal frictions. Indeed, with<br />
a Good Neighbour M-. vement joining in the work of integration, we have<br />
had an experience which has proved itself to be the greatest peace-time<br />
achievement of the Australian people. You are part of our success and<br />
tonight we salute you for the way in which you have joined with us and<br />
become an integral part of an Australian family.<br />
I wish you all happiness in the years ahead and together<br />
may we go on to build the Australia to which we all aspire. </p>
