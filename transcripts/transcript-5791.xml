PRIME MINIST: ER WEDNESDAY, 14 APRIL 1982<br />
From the Press Office SUMMARY OF ABC'S<br />
You have heard that the Federal Treasurer will announce that<br />
the Government will amend taxation legislation to allow<br />
Royal Commissions access to taxation files of individual<br />
and companies under investigation. The decision follows a<br />
request from the current Royal Commission of the activities<br />
of the Ship Painters and Dockers Union.<br />
Helen O'Neil<br />
The Government's decision breaks a very long standing tradition<br />
that income is supposed to be a private matter between the<br />
individual a-ad the Taxation Commissioner. The reason according<br />
to the Treasurer, Mr John Howard is the Government believes<br />
the Royal Commrissions might be able to come up with information<br />
that will prove of special benefit to the community. Until<br />
the interim report of the Royal Commission into the Painters<br />
and Dockers, the Government had shelved the decision on<br />
similar requests for access which had been made by two drug<br />
inquiries. The Painters and Dockers Report by the Commissioner,<br />
Frank Costigan QC said that Mr Costigan believed that members<br />
of the union were involved in multi-million dollar tax<br />
rackets and that its investigations were ineffective without<br />
that added power to look into information held after all, by<br />
another. Government agency. The Commissioner said it would<br />
be a scandalous waste of taxpayers time and money if he was<br />
denied access. -But the Government has imposed a series<br />
of boundaries how the information can be used in a bid to<br />
preserve some privacy. Firstly, the Commission will be able<br />
to disclose information only if they do not identify individuals<br />
or companies. Secondly, the onlyway which the Commission<br />
will be able to pass on information they find disturbing is<br />
through a Minister with a recommendation to pass the information<br />
on to-the Federal Police. Therefore, the final decision<br />
on who will -gain. access to the information remains in the hands<br />
ofthe Government. The taxation information obtained in this<br />
way by the police won't be able to be used in any prosecutions<br />
and the Government has also warned that the decision should<br />
not be assumed to be a precedent for any other relaxation of<br />
the secrecy provisions. It has also rejected a recommendation<br />
of the Australian Royal Commission of Inquiry into drugs<br />
to allow disclosure of tax information to law enforcement<br />
agencies inquiring into serious drug offences. Therefore,<br />
the degree of access will depend on how the Government interprets<br />
whether the Royal Commission has relevant terms of references<br />
which give it . the right to open up the taxation office.<br />
AS the British Navy Task Force gets closer to the occupied<br />
Falkland Islands the American peace bid seems to be faltering<br />
an Australian historian has called for a closer inspection<br />
of Ar: gentina's claim on the Islands. Dr Miguel Bratos()<br />
a Cuban American Lecturer in Spanish studies at the University<br />
of NSW. is interviewed by Steve Sailoh. </p>
<p>-2-<br />
A report that $ 2.7 billion had been wiped off the the Australian<br />
resources boom has prompted widespread sole searching today<br />
about the state of the Australian economy and the policies the<br />
Government is following. The Financial Review devoted an<br />
editorial and a large front page article to the subject under<br />
the banner recession, it is here and * serious. And its editorial<br />
called in particular for a freeze on money wages as a<br />
step towards improving profitability. Other economic indicators<br />
released today showed a record capital inflow attributed to<br />
borrowings overseas by Austrlian companies unable to get<br />
finance at home, an increase by the ANZ bank of 1% on its<br />
rates for large overdrafts and a continued slump in the building<br />
industry. Interview with Rod Nettle, South Australian Chamber<br />
of Commerce and Industry and Phil Riven business strategist.<br />
Senator Neville Bonner today described the Queensland<br />
Government's aboriginal land legislation as a continuation<br />
of * the Government's paternalistic control of aborigines.<br />
Senator Bonner told Queensland delegates to the National<br />
Aboriginal Conference in Brisbane the deed of grant in trust<br />
gave no security of tenure and was unacceptable to aborigines.<br />
Report from Margot Stevens.<br />
A by-election is on for the State seat of Drummoyne in NSW<br />
vacated by Mr Michael Maher. This time however, the boot could<br />
be on the other foot. Labor Premier Mr Wran has taken out some<br />
early insurance by acknowledging that he expects a kick in the<br />
pants from the electors of Drummoyne. Interview with<br />
Malcolm Mackerras.<br />
A Perth doctor's house has been attacked in what some claim<br />
is a disturbing counter measure in the undeclared war between<br />
tobacco and an anti smoking group. The doctor has been publicly<br />
linked with the group which alters cigarette advertising<br />
posters. Report from John mills. </p>
