PRIMAE MINISTER L13R<br />
FOR MEDIA January 14,<br />
ADDRESS TO THE<br />
NATIONAL CONVENTION OF THE YOUNG LIBERAL<br />
MOVEMENT OF AUSTRALIA<br />
I am g rateful to you, Mr President, and to your Executive,<br />
for the invitation to open this-twelfth annual convention, and<br />
to address you.<br />
Of course, this convention has a special significance. We have<br />
not ' only entered a new year, but also a new decade. The future<br />
invites us to action and challenges us with opportunity.<br />
But above-all, this is an election year in which we must again<br />
assert the continuing relevance and capacity of Liberalism to<br />
meet the emerging challenges.<br />
As we confront new tests as a Party, a Government, a nation,<br />
our confidence in what we can achieve is strengthened by the<br />
significant progress we have made in the last four years. This<br />
progress has been won by the Government accepting its resoonsibilitics.<br />
, It has been assisted by a nation, often confronted with difficult<br />
choices. But. to-eether we have learnt tChat di-. 7fficult decisions, difficultchoices,<br />
often provide the only responsible, solutions. . Now, -at<br />
the end of four years of respo~ nsible economic management, our<br />
achievements are significant. In many areas they are being<br />
internationally acknowledged.<br />
Liberalism, called upon in the middle 70' s by the Australian<br />
electorate to inject commonsense and commitment into the Australian<br />
nation and its economy, has fashioned a magnificent response.<br />
For four years, we have waged the fight against inflation, and our<br />
success in absolute terms has-been significant. In terms relative<br />
to some of our major trading partners, our improvement has also-,<br />
been significant. But this fight must continue, even though we<br />
start the 80' s with a relatively better record against inflation<br />
than countries like Great Britain and the United States of America.<br />
Because we have. coritained costs, our exports are more competitive<br />
on world markets. This provides incentives for increasing factory<br />
Iproduction. Business investment is-str-engthening. The gross value<br />
of rural output shows a dramatic improvement on levels of two years<br />
ago. / 2 </p>
<p>-2<br />
And while unemployment is still too high, figures released only<br />
last week show that the numbers of civilian employees, that is,<br />
wage and salary earners,* in Australia, passed the 5 million mark<br />
for the first time. Inthe year ended October 31, there were<br />
81 thousand more wage and salary earners in employment than was<br />
the. case a year ago, and the figures for over-all employment<br />
are even higher than this.<br />
These are significant achievements. To them we can add our national<br />
endowments of raw materials and energy resources in a world<br />
experiencing deficiencies in both.<br />
In my election speech in 1977, I announced to the Australian<br />
people that, " Australia is ready to go with $ 6,000 million<br />
of development". In the two ' financial years which followed<br />
that statement, actual investment was even higher than I predicted,<br />
at $ 6,400 million.<br />
I indicated then that " in the coming three years we can look to<br />
other vast developments". This has now been proven. Most recent<br />
figures indicate that $ 16.5 billion wotth of mining and manufacturing<br />
projects are either about to go ahead in Australia, or are in<br />
the final stages of preparation. A massive increase on the level<br />
of two years ago.<br />
The Government's dedication to economic growth has produced results.<br />
This. is the measure of business response, here and overseas, to<br />
our hard-won and vastly improved economic position. 11ow much<br />
more important this is today in the politically delicate international<br />
situation which is emerging. It is only from a position of economic<br />
strength that a nation can command international and diplomatic<br />
influence. How much more significant it is, in the light of<br />
international circumstances, that in the last four years we have<br />
arrested and reversed Australia's economic decline.<br />
Mistakenly, all of this prompts cries of complacency about us being<br />
the lucky country. The fact that we cannot rely on luck was<br />
adequately demonstbrated in tL-he Labor years. It was then proven<br />
conclusively that in spite of, our great-endowments, . all things:<br />
do not come to those who simply sit and wait.<br />
Rather, we must pursue economic, individual,. and nationa. success.<br />
We have to work to make a better nation arid the only way we can do<br />
this-is to implement policies-which will increase our total<br />
national wealth. Our Party seeks its continuing claim to govern in<br />
the 80' s on its capacity to secure and enhance conditions for economic<br />
growth. This goal, central to national well-being, was beyond the<br />
capacity of the Whitlam governmeant to realise; the means for achieving<br />
economic growth, the priorities which lead to it, are beyond the<br />
understanding of t~ he Labor Party now.<br />
Last week, the Leader of the Opposition felt so ag grieved that I,<br />
as Prime Minister, had addressed the nation about the great<br />
opportunities before us, that he felt it necessary to respond.<br />
In his reponse, Mr Hayden posed as the new economic miracle man.<br />
His promise was no more than an economic joke.<br />
In a rare concession, he at last acknowledged that " we should<br />
get inflation under contro'TIn the same breath he promised<br />
massive expenditure: " free medical insurance for mothers-and </p>
<p>3<br />
children"; " your family pay packet ( increased) by an average of<br />
$ 17 a week"; " major Labor. intensive capital works in all States";<br />
" a national community services corps".<br />
Time did not allow further detailing by Mr Hayden of a long list<br />
of expenditure promises he is already committed to. Yet no sooner<br />
had he finished promising this expenditure, when he told us,<br />
" There must be cuts in indirect taxeg, and substantial additional<br />
cuts in income tax and sales tax".<br />
By this time,' the audience realised that Mr Hayden's joke was at<br />
their expense. Here was the old Labor prescription all over again.<br />
Showing contempt for the economic well-being of Australia;<br />
contemptuous of the intelligence of all Australians, he promised<br />
increased expenditure and lower taxation while maintaining the<br />
pretence that inflation would be reduced.<br />
We would all be enriched if Mr Hayden would explain to this nation,<br />
and the nations of the world, ho ' T this could be done. There is<br />
no cargo cult creed.<br />
You cannot have increased expenditure and decreased taxation<br />
without massive inflation and massive defidits. Margaret Thatcher<br />
put it well this week when she said, " Pennies don't come from<br />
heayen, they have to be earned here on earth".<br />
Mr Hayden compounded his economic fantasies when he announced in<br />
his broadcast that we should reduce the price of petrol. Yet,<br />
in March; 1979, Mr Hayden was asked on the ABC, " Can we ever remain<br />
a haven for cheaper petrol?". His answer, " No-one can argue against<br />
the economic principles, the sound economic principles, in support<br />
of parity pricing, import parity pricing of petroleum products".<br />
The London Economist of December 22 last, arguing about the<br />
validity of increasing petrol prices, said, The West's citizens<br />
can be chi vied and cozened into energy conservation, provided<br />
the prices signal is pointing in the same direction".<br />
In the London Sunday Times of December 16 last, the economics editor<br />
said, " Rising prices of energy in the 70' s were indeed necessary....<br />
to hold back demand and provide incentives to supply".<br />
He asked, " Are higher oil prices necessary to bring forth more<br />
energy?". To which he answered', " Many oil fields would n0t have-*<br />
been viable if real oil prices had not risen."<br />
All this wisdom was wasted on Mr Hayden. The Labor Party, the<br />
tax-mongers of Australia's wealth in the mid-70' s; the doom-mongers<br />
of Australia's future; now-seek to become the waste-mongers of<br />
Australia's energy.<br />
We are in a privileged position in relation to supply and cost of<br />
petrol. We must match this privilege with responsibility.<br />
The United States has already announced, and is acting upon, its<br />
commitment to world parity pricing, as America, too, finds limited<br />
insulation from the world energy problem. Our petrol price of<br />
around 29Â½ a litre still compares more than favourably with Britain<br />
51Â½; Germany 57; Japan 63Â½ a litre; France 68Â½; and Itay </p>
<p>4-<br />
In fact, an Australian motorist purchasing 40 litres of petrol<br />
a week in 1959 would have spent 7.8% of average weekJ-ly earnings.<br />
In 1969, the same amount of petrol would have cost only 5.1% of<br />
average weekly earnings. In 1979, a motorist purchasing 40 litres<br />
of petrol a week would spend even less of average weekly<br />
earnings.. To gain any credibility onthe petrol pricing question, the Opposition<br />
will need to move their argument from myth to reality. It may<br />
be slick politics to offer cheap petrol; to talk in slogans<br />
about breaking with the import parity system. Has no-one<br />
in the Labor Party thought this through?<br />
Let us take a realistic look at what Labor's so-called cheaper<br />
petrol means. It means that this generation of Australians<br />
would have an almost unlimited right to use up our scarce fuel reserves<br />
It means that, as a nation,* we should have-no responsibility<br />
to the energy needs of the next generation.. It means that industry<br />
would be enticed to postpone new technologies of conservation and<br />
replacement rather than be * encouraged to move into more viable<br />
forms of energy. It means that development and exploration would<br />
be inhibited.<br />
All of this means that Australian reserves would run down, and<br />
Australia would become a defenceless victim of the international<br />
oil cartel beggars for fuel, not just at parity pricing,<br />
but even pot prices; prices which cash in on factors of limited<br />
supply and unlimited demand.<br />
There is rno escaping the reality that price must be used as a<br />
barometer of scarcity. Our decision on parity pricing represents<br />
further proof that we have to look to the most difficult decisions<br />
for the most responsible solutions.<br />
What Labor is promising is not just a selfish, narrow-minded,<br />
inward-looking policy. It is a policy which. pays no regard to<br />
Australia's future needs and indicates the depth to which Labor<br />
s%, ill sink in an attempt to purchase votes.<br />
I am confident that the judgment of the'Australian people reflects<br />
their concern also for Australia's-future. The cynicism of<br />
the Labor Party about the Australian voter is reflected in -their<br />
recently-published views that swinging'voters are, and-I quote,<br />
" Basically ignorant and indifferent about politics ill-informed<br />
and generally pretty-selfish".<br />
I believe that on the petrol issue, Australians-are capable of<br />
distinguishing between the myth and the reality of future<br />
economic growth in Australia. Our dedication to promoting economic<br />
growth is proven and unyielding, not because it is inherently more<br />
important than other personal and social goals, but because without<br />
economic growth the aspirations-of an advanced society cannot be<br />
realised. Without economic growth, our goals of creating more jobs;<br />
Improving welfare; continuing support for the arts and cultural<br />
activities; providing a life for all Aus-tralians which maximises<br />
choice, freedom, opportunity and achievement these goals cannot be<br />
achieved without sustainable economic growth. </p>
<p>if, as under the Whitlamxn years, goals are pursued without containing<br />
inflation, without regard for productivity or economic growth, then<br />
the result is that while one goal might be achieved, it is only<br />
achieved at the expense or impoverishment of something or someone else<br />
As Professor Henderson said in his recent report on poverty in<br />
Australia, an inflationary spiral does more damage to poor<br />
people than the assistance provided by reforms".<br />
Because there ' are inherent threats to the well-being of our<br />
community in the policies and platform of the Labor Party, we<br />
must pronounce our achievements and pursue our future plan<br />
with-purpose and persistence. We must harness all our talents, our<br />
energy,, our enthusiasm, and those of all Australians.<br />
Success in the 80' s, as in recent years-, will require the right<br />
policies from Government, coupled to a willingness amongst us<br />
all to use our freedom profitably in new enterprises. All-Australians<br />
have learnt that the policies which allo-w for the enterprise which<br />
brings achievement; the policies which provide appropriate<br />
rewards for risk-taking in the pursuit of achievement; these policies<br />
can only be forthcoming from a Liberal Government. They have been<br />
possible under Liberal government because Liberalism rejects the<br />
notion that a Government growing in size and power, and concentrated<br />
in Canberra, is the answer to a better life for all Australians.<br />
In the F. E. Chamberlain lecture in March last year, Mr Hayden stated<br />
clearly that, " The challenge to Socialism is the rapid spread<br />
of philosophies based on lower taxes and smdller government.."<br />
Let us unapologetically proclaim that Liberalism will continue<br />
with its challenge. The most powerful force for progress and<br />
achievement in the future is the individual who, by his own efforts,<br />
his own decisions, his own volition, charts his-way through this new<br />
decade. Your role, as in the past, will be significant. Like any organisation<br />
you face your own challenges., They will increase accordi-ng to the<br />
level of responsibility you accept. One of our challenges isto<br />
see that young people see our Party and the Young Liberal movement<br />
as relievant* to LEheir-needs.<br />
. We. all sometimes need reminding that the Party does-not exist for<br />
our persontal advancement-or-benefit, but rather as an organisation<br />
through which Australia can be responsibly and well-governed for<br />
the advantage of all Australians. It is through our own example<br />
that other Australians-will be encouraged to accept our principles,<br />
and to join with us in the fight for their political ascendancy.<br />
One of the great strengths of this annual convention is the forum<br />
that it provides for discus-sion and debate about issues* in which<br />
you have a special expertise. Often, this expertise derives from<br />
the particular qualities, talents and experiences you have as part<br />
of Australia's youth. Especially is this true on the question of<br />
education, and on the vexed question of youth unemployment.<br />
These problems are overstated by some, underestimated by others.<br />
The solutions to them are'never simple. The educa ' tion. o f our youth<br />
has gathered momentum as an urgent priority since the war. As a<br />
top priority of governmenbs, it has won universal acceptance. / 6 </p>
<p>-6<br />
In 1961, the then President of the United States said, " Our progress<br />
as a nation can be no swifter than our progress in education our<br />
hopes for economic growth and the demand. for citizenship itsel. f<br />
require the maximum development of every young person's-capacity".<br />
Implicit in this statement was the belief that education was the<br />
vehicle for the development of these capacities. It was legitimately<br />
argued that the human mind was our most fundamental resource; that the'<br />
basic educational training of it was the most sophisticated preparatior<br />
for professional.. work.<br />
Fdr more than two decades this view has been shared by Australian<br />
governments and Australian parents. In the 1970/ 71 financial year,<br />
the total Commonwealth and State government expenditure on schools<br />
in Australia was $ 840 million.<br />
By this financial year, this total had risen to $ 4,049 million.<br />
This-explosion occurred against a background in which for a long<br />
time., people had clot jobs almost irrespective of their educationsome<br />
might say in spite of it. Those who were not so good at<br />
school left and got employment. Those who were good at schoo.<br />
stayed on and got better employment. Because of this, the education<br />
system was rarely placed under the microscope.<br />
Now; of course, more peopl,: h want to work. Yetf recent surveys<br />
show that employers are protesting that there are jobs which cannot<br />
be filled; that the capacities of some young people entering the<br />
workforce are not adequate to meet the demands placed upon them.<br />
Some em'ployers complain about the poor representation of certain<br />
young people in the workforce; of attitudes and abilities which are<br />
not conducive to winning employment.<br />
These complaints say more about the systems through which young<br />
people pass than they do about young people themselves. The<br />
advocates of universal education down through the years, have<br />
argued that education was the agent of equality. Now, education's<br />
critics are arguing that the flaws of the system are such that<br />
edlucation is raising barriers aga inst young people's progress<br />
rather thani elim-Linating them.<br />
Go ver nmen . ts have pr Iovid ed resdurces; proper returns have not occurred.<br />
In fact, it is in recent times while colossal expenditure in education<br />
has been going on, that-the values, direction and competence of the<br />
educat ioft ' systemae been most severely questioned.<br />
Peoleare rightly concerned that too much education is for the<br />
academically-minded, those with special talents. But those without<br />
academic ability are entitled to at least as much attention. I would<br />
argue, more. They are not getting it. People with academic<br />
preoccupations, inside or outside the education system, must<br />
understand their capacity to compound and frustrate a student's<br />
sense of failure when goals are pursued that cannot be reached.<br />
A New South W'ales Labor quoted in this week's Bulletin,<br />
says," What we need is public confidence in our schools and that's<br />
not there Lh. e education system is not doing what we want it to<br />
do". Yet expenditure in primary and secondary education has risen<br />
phenomenally during the last decade. / 7 </p>
<p>7<br />
Because of this, recurrent expenditure per primary student in<br />
government schools rose by more than 50% in real terms between<br />
1972-73 and 19.77.-78, and by 38% at secondary level.<br />
At the seame time, pupil/ teacher ratios have been significantly<br />
reduced. There can be no doubt that there are many, many proven<br />
and dedicated teachers in education today. Yet if, in spite of all<br />
this-, children are sent out of school unable to read, write or<br />
add up to an acceptable standard; if the values transmitted by the<br />
education system are inconsistent with those which society expects<br />
of young people, then clearly young people are being betrayed by<br />
the system.<br />
We can no longer remain impervious to community concern.' Does<br />
anyone believe that all these monies have been well-directed,<br />
in the public good? The system is-failing those to whom ' it owes<br />
the most help. Good students will survive and succeed anywhere.<br />
Indeed, they thrive on academic structures.<br />
But for those not so academically inclined, curricula and course<br />
structures are deficient. Courses are needed which meet the<br />
aspirations of all students. It must be the objective of every<br />
school to enable each child to find a level of opportunity, to<br />
e-: perience a sense of achievement.<br />
To do otherw7ise, not only fails our young people, but leaves<br />
them with a sense of isolation and frustration. Of-course,<br />
there must be discipline, relevance and content in any educational<br />
system. But it is time that education accepted the demands of a<br />
modern, industrial society and confronted new education realities.<br />
For education, this is the challenge of the 80' s. New successes<br />
will come, not by arguing successfully for the spending of more<br />
money, but by reassessing how existing monies are to be spent.<br />
Young people should not be penalised for their inability to cope<br />
with the society they enter, when they have not received adequate<br />
training fPor such an entry.<br />
While the Commo6nwe7alth has' nd general direct responsibility for<br />
primary and secondary education, it views with great seriousness<br />
its limitations. It has-devised schemes which, while not eliminating<br />
the ' problems-, will' hop6' filly assist young people to surmount them.<br />
Some of our programmes are designed to help the unempl. oyed and the<br />
young unemployed without skills. They give special training and<br />
work experience, and by the end of this financial year, over half<br />
a million Australians, many of them young Australians, will have<br />
been assisted by these training programnmes.<br />
Recently these programmes-have been strengthened*. Acknowledging<br />
that skills are needed amongst the young unemployed, we have increased<br />
the incentives to employers to take on new apprentices.<br />
We have expanded other measures to increase the intake of apprentices.<br />
We have announced plans to treble the intake by Commonwealth<br />
departments of the Special Youth Employment Training Programme.<br />
we have extended support in this programme ' to trainees taken<br />
on by State governments. / 8 </p>
<p>8-<br />
The Government is concerned that there is a recognised short-fall<br />
of tradesmen while young people, willing to take apprenticeships,<br />
have been unable to obtain them. our initiatives demonstrate that<br />
we have acted upon that concern.<br />
I have already referred to the problems facing young people as<br />
they move from school to work. I would argue that if existing<br />
institutions were doing their job properly, many of these problems<br />
would not exist. In particular, the school and the family will<br />
always possess an undeniable capacity to minimise such problems.<br />
However, because problems exist, the Government accepts its<br />
responsibility to-help overcome them. We have agreed to<br />
provide $ 150 million over 5 years-for a special transition programme<br />
which, we hope, will involve, in later years, increased contributions<br />
from the States and the Northern Territory.<br />
The programmes are designed to stimulate or extend the interests<br />
of young people and our primary concern is for the thousands<br />
of young people who are leaving school each year with poor employment<br />
prospects. We want to provide appropriate education and training<br />
courses for them. We want also to tackle the problems of those in the<br />
schools who are likely to be in similar difficulties when comes<br />
their turn to leave.<br />
Our aim is that, ultimately, all young people in the 15-19 age group<br />
will be provided with options in education, training, employment<br />
or any comnbination of these.<br />
Unfortunately, deficiencies cannot be removed overnight. The<br />
Government can provide direction and thrust; but unless teachers,<br />
parents, employers and the community at large act upon their concern,<br />
young people are not going to receive the support they deserve.<br />
We all have a role to play politicians, parents, employerLs,<br />
community leaders, trades unionists, and of course, youth themselves.<br />
The whole thrust of the Government's initiative is designed to ensure<br />
that teenage years are produc't-ive, constLructive and Satisfying. The<br />
programmes I have outlined are essential. Yet, we must-retain -a.<br />
balanced perspective about welfare programmes.<br />
One of the challeniges of the 80' s will be to strikea balance<br />
between Lhe cost of social welfare and the desire of the taxpayer<br />
to retain resources to support the living standards-of himself and<br />
his family. These resources can only be improved in a healthy economy.<br />
The economic problems we inherited had placed the well-being of<br />
all'Australians in jeopardy. We would have been entitled to make<br />
the economy and its-health our sole concern.<br />
Instead, our initiatives have been broad-based. Complementary<br />
with our pursuit of economic growth-has been our achievement of<br />
great social reforms which service the needs of the nation from<br />
the strength of the economy.<br />
Our 1976 Family Allowances Scheme, at the time, gave increased<br />
assistance to 300,000 families with. 800,000 children. In the<br />
last three years, our support of facilities for the aged and<br />
handicapped has been greater than ' Chat of any other three-year period. </p>
<p>9<br />
The provision of increased access to Cormmonwealth rehabilitation<br />
service programmes and the acceptance of the Galbally Report<br />
recommendations on the needs of migrants have confirmed our<br />
continuing conmmitment to those in need.<br />
As well as these achievements, your initiatives, translated into<br />
Government action, have produced the National Youth Advisory Group,<br />
the office of Youth Affairs, and the National Youth Conference.<br />
There is now, as never before, available to young people, the<br />
opportunity to bring forward their views to government. There is<br />
a certain appropriateness about speaking to a gathering of young<br />
Liberals as we begin a new year.<br />
The enthusiasm, imagination, and latent ambition of all young people<br />
are capable of giving significant momentum to our quest for new<br />
achievement in the<br />
These qualities, coupled to our Liberal policies, have not only<br />
brought Australia in the last four years to the current feeling<br />
of optimism and pride. They will be central to our continuing<br />
commitment to advance the frontiers of achievement for Australia<br />
and all Australians further and further out. </p>
