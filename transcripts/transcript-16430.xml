    <content><![CDATA[<p>PM:   The global economic crisis takes many forms and one of the forms it takes is  its impact on jobs and its impact on people who lose jobs through no fault of  their own. Absolutely no fault of their own. </p>
<p>The  Government's response has been to embrace a nation building strategy. First,  stabilise financial markets. There's been hard work done on that. Second,  nation building through infrastructure investment for the future to provide  support for jobs in the near term as well as build the infrastructure that Australia  needs for the longer term. Hence, our $15 billion investment in the biggest  school modernisation program the country has seen. Third part of it is this, to  support those workers who through no fault of their own lose their jobs or at  risk of losing their jobs because of this global economic crisis.</p>
<p>Today  the Government announces two new measures. The first is to provide immediate  employment services support for retrenched workers. At present what happens  under the existing system is that a person has to be out of work for three  months before being eligible for intensive assistance. That now changes as a  result of the decision of the Cabinet, this will now be immediately available  as of today to anyone who becomes retrenched.</p>
<p>That  means that persons in those circumstances would be immediately available,  immediately able to access what is called stream two services. Career advice,  comprehensive skills assessment, skills development training, IT support and  stationery support to help with job applications, targeted referrals to  appropriate education and training and also a $550 credit to the Employment  Pathway Fund for items such as computer courses, heavy vehicle licences, safety  boots and work uniforms.</p>
<p>This  is a practical set of supports available to retrenched workers but the big  change is, it is available now as opposed to workers having to wait three  months. That is the change that we're announcing today. That is one element of  what the Government's decided today.</p>
<p>The  second is this, the Government has also providing funding for a further 10,000  Productivity Places for redundant workers. This is important. If a person has  lost their job through no fault of their own, then what we need to have  available is a sufficient number of training places for those persons to use  their time of unemployment to obtain further skills or to build up their  existing skills. And that's why an additional allocation of 10,000 training  places specifically targeted on workers who have become redundant is an  important part of the overall plan.</p>
<p>This  of course builds on something which the Deputy Prime Minister announced last  week which is a $145 million program to provide out-of-work apprentices, that  is apprentices who are currently doing their apprenticeship but whose employer  can no longer retain them, to provide assistance specifically for them and that  of course was to the tune of $2,800 per individual apprenticeship place.</p>
<p>These  are three practical measures to assist with the problem which arises for people  who lose their jobs, or are losing their ability to sustain their  apprenticeship through no fault of their own.</p>
<p>There  is no silver bullet in this. These are practical measures to assist on the way  through. But I would say this, the Government remains resolved to take whatever  further measures are necessary to support workers and their families who lose  their jobs through no fault of their own.</p>
<p>If  I could turn to the Deputy Prime Minister and then the Minister.</p>
<p>GILLARD:   Thank you very much. Just briefly as the Prime Minister said, last week I  announced a practical step to help apprentices who find themselves out of  trade. We've met some young people this morning midway through their training.  If they hit a circumstance where they lost their job, the Government wants to  take practical measures to help them secure a new opportunity so that they can  finish their apprenticeship, hence the announcement of $2,800 in incentive  money to get a new employer or a group training organisation to take that  apprentice on, give them a new opportunity and give them a new way of  completing their apprenticeship. </p>
<p>It  also comes with additional resources for training organisations to find  pathways to completion for apprentices who lose their jobs.</p>
<p>Today, building on that measure, we announced 10,000 new productivity places  for redundant workers. This builds on our very successful productivity places  program and the Government has already allocated and budgeted for more than  700,000 places.</p>
<p>These  10,000 places will be there to help workers who are made redundant get the  skills they need to get new opportunities in our workplaces.</p>
<p>What  we know from past economic downturns is when the economy turns down, people  stop training. When the economy then grows, everybody is crying out for skilled  labour. We want to do everything possible through these kinds of practical  measures to change that cycle, to continue to invest in the Australian people,  even in these difficult days following the global financial crisis - to make  sure that they have got the skills they need to get new opportunities in our  economy.</p>
<p>O'CONNOR:  Can I just add to the comments made already by the Prime Minister in relation  to the initiative. Can I say firstly it's critical that the Government  intervene as early as possible to assist retrenched workers and that is why we  are dedicating almost $300 million to provide the support that's needed to get  people back into work as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>What we do know is that the current services provide only a resume and indeed  provide only one meeting prior to three months for the first three months.</p>
<p>These  new initiatives will provide personalised intensive support for retrenched  workers. It will include assessing their skills, referring them to training  providers to get them trained in areas of skilled need as quickly as possible,  and provide opportunities for them to find work.</p>
<p>There  is nothing worse than a worker being retrenched and this Government is acting  swiftly to respond to the need of those retrenched workers.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:  Prime  Minister, is there enough money for the maternity leave plan to go ahead this  year? </p>
<p>GILLARD:   Well what I have said in the past about that, and what remains my view is that  the Government was elected saying that we wanted to have a Productivity  Commission inquiry into paid maternity leave.</p>
<p>We said that because we wanted expert advice on how to design a system that  would build on and not displace some of the things that companies around the  nation are already doing on paid maternity leave. </p>
<p>The  Government's going to receive that report by the end of this month and we've  always said that any financial matters flowing from that report would need to  be considered in the budget context.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:    Is it going to be time to bite the bullet soon, as Mr Rudd said last year? </p>
<p>PM:      Well I remain personally committed to paid maternity leave. But as Julia has  quite rightly pointed out, what we said was we would look at the Productivity  Commission report  -  it's due soon - and that we'd consider it in the budget  context. That is the right way to do public policy. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST:    Mr Rudd, you are an advocate of four-year fixed terms as I recall. Do you think  that now with first West Australia and now Queensland Premiers calling  elections well ahead of time, at great public expense for nothing but their own  political advantage, do you think people have a right to be sick of that and  will you undertake to serve a full term yourself (inaudible).</p>
<p>PM:   Firstly what I'd say about Queensland is this - the Queensland Premier Anna  Bligh has been upfront about the challenges that the State faces as a result of  the global financial crisis. She's laid bare the State's balance sheets and  said that what the State needs is certainty and confidence going forward. Anna  Bligh as Premier can provide that. When I hear the words Premier Lawrence  Springborg, confidence and certainty are not the first two words which spring  to mind. </p>
<p>Secondly,  in terms of fixed year terms our position is absolutely clear. That's the  position I have long advocated, that's the one I believe in for the future for  the Federal Government. Every individual State Government makes up its own  mind. Mark.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:    Ms Gillard, what did you mean yesterday when you called Mr Pyne a mincer? </p>
<p>GILLARD:   Well in Question Time you've got to have your moments of humour and I think  that that was a moment of humour. </p>
<p>PM:   [inaudible] </p>
<p>GILLARD:   As is a matter of public record I think the Member for Warringah Tony Abbott  was interested in the job. I think anybody who's seen Tony Abbott in action  would say he's got a very different style to Christopher Pyne. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST:    Mr Rudd are you a toxic bore? </p>
<p>PM:   Can I say that anyone, anyone  -  you wrote about this today Matthew.  (Inaudible). If you are dealing with the totality of a global economic crisis,  unless we have a restoration of private credit markets and private credit flows  across the global economy and normal flows in Australia, then we're never  dealing with the full dimensions of the problem. That's what I was saying in  the Parliament yesterday, that is the reality which every government in the  world is wrestling with - </p>
<p>JOURNALISTSo does that mean yes? </p>
<p>PM:   - that is the reality which every government is wrestling with. Secondly,  stimulus along the lines of nation building plans and what we described before  are part of providing near to medium term support while private credit markets  are being restored. I think it's important to be upfront with the Australian  public about the dimensions of the problem which are occurring in the global  banking system, what's causing that, where the solutions may lie. </p>
<p>Secondly,  what we in Australia are doing in the near to medium term to support growth and  jobs on the way through. That's the right course of action and I'll be sticking  to it.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Mr Rudd, Tony Abbott who described you this morning as a toxic bore - how would  you describe him? </p>
<p>PM:   I think when you're dealing with a global economic crisis it's important to be  serious about, of course there's a problem and what you can do about it. This  Government is in the practical business of trying to fix problems and can I say  people losing their jobs isn't funny. What we're trying to do is provide  support for people losing their jobs and through measures which the Liberal  Party opposed only a week or so ago help create, support new jobs by  construction activity in schools. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST:Are you getting nervous about emissions trading and is there a chance that that  you could actually be rolled on this one? </p>
<p>PM:The Government will legislate the contents of our White Paper on the Carbon  Pollution Reduction Scheme as we announced last year. </p>
<p>We  have no intention whatsoever of changing our course of action on that. It is  necessary for the long term future of the planet. It is necessary to also do it  in the balanced way we outlined in the White Paper, mindful of the challenges  of the global economy.</p>
