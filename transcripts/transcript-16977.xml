    <content><![CDATA[<p>This is an historic day for the Australian automotive industry.</p>
<p>This first hybrid car produced in Australia, for Australians, and by Australians- you should be proud of what you're doing here, this day, for your country.</p>
<p>On top of that, this is an achievement of which all Australians should be proud. It's one of those days when we should be saying "Oh what a feeling, Australia!"</p>
<p>This is a great day for the country.</p>
<p>Just as the nation welcomed the first all-Australian Holden car in 1948 with Ben Chifley there for the first ride, sixty years later, all Australians should welcome the first Australian hybrid car as well. I place you on notice. I am down to drive this first car once it comes off the assembly line. My staff are nervous.</p>
<p>I have not been allowed to drive a car for two years - Occupational Health and Safety Standards should be made ready. Clear a path for the PM behind the wheel.</p>
<p>This is the beginning of a whole new era in Australian motoring.</p>
<p>Australia is one of only about 16 countries around the world to design, engineer and build a car from scratch. That's an important achievement for our nation.</p>
<p>And today Australia joins only four other countries that can produce a Toyota hybrid car.</p>
<p>The Toyota hybrid Camry will offer Australians the choice of a fuel-efficient, low emissions vehicle that is produced right here in Australia.</p>
<p>Compared with standard vehicles, it will use about 30% less petrol, and, critically, produce about 30% less carbon emissions.</p>
<p>The hybrid Camry is good for motorists, it's good for the economy, it's good for jobs, and it's good for action on climate change. Well done Toyota.</p>
<p>As we speak, the Governments of the world are gathering together in Copenhagen, in Denmark, to work towards an international agreement to tackle climate change - reducing carbon emissions is a huge challenge for us all. Every country, every industry, every person working together.</p>
<p>And the transport sector, which contributes 14% of Australia's total carbon emissions, must play its part if we are going to cool the planet in the future.</p>
<p>And today we see the automotive industry here in Australia playing its part, beginning the transition to a lower carbon economy.</p>
<p>And that transition means new jobs, new skills, new opportunities for this great Australian industry.</p>
<p>The Toyota hybrid Camry is an important step in Australia's ability to achieve our domestic emissions targets, and to reduce the impact of climate change.</p>
<p>It's an important practical step towards Australia's lower carbon future.</p>
<p>The Australian Government is pleased to support the production of the Toyota hybrid Camry in Australia in partnership with the Victorian Government.</p>
<p>It's good for the environment, critical for supporting jobs in the automotive sector- jobs which have disappeared around the world in the automotive sector because of the global economic recession and the global financial crisis.</p>
<p>But here in Australia we have worked together to keep these jobs, and I congratulate Toyota for their part in that vision.</p>
<p>Production of the hybrid Camry is expected to inject around $90 million into the Victorian and South Australian automotive parts industries, and will create new jobs at Toyota's suppliers.</p>
<p>More than 50 hybrid-unique parts have been sourced from local suppliers.</p>
<p>This great industry is worth $7 billion a year. 4,500 jobs at Toyota.</p>
<p>60,000 jobs directly in the automotive industry.</p>
<p>200,000 jobs indirectly, in related industries.</p>
<p>On the day I became leader of the Australian Labor Party, three years ago, I said this: "I don't want to be Prime Minister of a country that doesn't make things anymore".</p>
<p>My view has not changed.</p>
<p>This country will continue to make things in the future- and that includes making world-class motor vehicles.</p>
<p>That's why we put in place a 13 year, $6.2 billion New Car Plan for a Greener Future.</p>
<p>It's what we discussed with Toyota and their global leadership in Nagoya last year- how we could work together on projects like this one here that we are launching today.</p>
<p>It gives the industry the certainty that it needs and the incentives that it needs to innovate for the future.</p>
<p>The centrepiece of this plan is a $1.3 billion Green Car Innovation Fund.</p>
<p>The first grant from that $1.3 billion Australian Government Fund was awarded to this project that we are here to celebrate today, and I'm proud to be part of the success of Toyota with this project.</p>
<p>Can I also say, I congratulate the Industry Minister, Kim Carr.</p>
<p>Kim Carr, a passionate Victorian, a passionate believer in Australian manufacturing, and a passionate supporter of the automotive industry- congratulations Kim, were it not for your work, this would not have happened.</p>
<p>The other critical partner has of course been Toyota itself.</p>
<p>And the hard work of its management team, its world class engineering, which I have seen in Nagoya upfront, and also the work of unions and workers in making this deal effective on the ground.</p>
<p>I'd like specifically to acknowledge the unique contribution of Ian Jones, the Vehicle Division Secretary of the AMWU, for his hard work in supporting workers at Toyota and across the industry in recent times. Congratulations Ian, on a job well done.</p>
<p>It's been a tough time for the automotive industry globally, and here in Australia.</p>
<p>Car sales around the world have declined, and they've declined in Australia too.</p>
<p>It's easy to say that the industry's time is up, or that Australia's time as a car producer is up.</p>
<p>That is not my view.</p>
<p>That is not the unions' view.</p>
<p>That is not the workers' view.</p>
<p>That is not the Government's view.</p>
<p>And that is not Toyota's view.</p>
<p>We intend to have this industry for Australia's future.</p>
<p>Sure, there are new technological, competitive and environmental challenges.</p>
<p>There have been in the past- there will be in the future.</p>
<p>Each of these challenges represents a new opportunity.</p>
<p>With the right policy settings, as well as leadership from the industry itself, and from the workforce, the industry can adapt and become stronger than ever before.</p>
<p>And today's achievement is proof of that.</p>
<p>Today we see a win for motorists around the country.</p>
<p>A win also for action on climate change.</p>
<p>A win for jobs in here in Altona, and across Australia.</p>
<p>And by working together, the industry, the workers and Government, car making does have a future in this country.</p>
<p>This is all made possible too with a strong, effective economic partnership between the Australian Government, and the Government of Victoria.</p>
<p>And I congratulate the Premier on his leadership, and passionate support for the future of the vehicle industry here in Victoria- thank you John.</p>
<p>I conclude by saying this- you the workers here at Toyota are part of a great nation-building project.</p>
<p>When Australians look into their future, they want to know that we can be a nation that makes things that count for the future.</p>
<p>They want to know that we're building our economy, not just for the next twelve months, but for the next twenty years and beyond.</p>
<p>Nation building for recovery, nation building for the future, and this great plant - and you, the fantastic workers at this plant- are part of our nation building vision for this great country's future.</p>
<p>I salute each and every one of you on this great achievement today.</p>
<p>Thank you very much.</p>
