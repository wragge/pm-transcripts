PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR PRESS .30 NOVZMBER 1977<br />
MR WRITLAM'S ANTI-INFLATIONARY POLICY<br />
We have now had over a week to asses Mr Whitlam's economic<br />
policies. Plenty of time hap gone by for him to explain them, to<br />
cost them, to tell us how they would work in tackling the<br />
major economic problems facing our country. There has also<br />
been time for me to look closely at hrs proposals.<br />
I now want to give my considered view on his anti-inflationary<br />
p policy. One would think that Mr Whitlam would have given the highest<br />
priority to this subject, for it was his failure on this point<br />
which led to the : collapse of his other major economaic policies<br />
when lie was in government in 1972-75.<br />
In fact, Labor's anti-inflationary policy receives<br />
only brief mention in Mr Witlam's speech, and even that<br />
mention is misleading.<br />
He claims that the abolition of payroll tax oh companies would<br />
be reflected in price reductions on the goods and services<br />
produced by companies, and would mean a " reduction in the Consumer<br />
Price Index of up to two percent a year" ( stress supplied).<br />
That is his key statement on inflation, brief though it is.<br />
My first point is this: if his proposal were to lead to any.<br />
price reductions, the effect would be once for all, in the first<br />
year of the payroll tax reduction. It is quite misleading<br />
of him to suggest that this possible short-run reduction would<br />
lead to a permanent reduction in the rate of inflation.<br />
In other words, this proposal is not an ongoing anti-inflationary<br />
policy at all. It is an attempt to find what no other country<br />
has found or will find: a once-and-for-all quick " fix"<br />
to inflation.<br />
My second point is that even in the first year of operation of such<br />
a proposal, the first-round effect on the Consumer Price Index<br />
before other effects offset this iTnact would.; be much less<br />
than 2 percent-2 </p>
<p>A figuxe as large as 2 percent could be arrived at by assuming that<br />
the reductions in business costs were fully passed on in price<br />
recutions. This is obviously an extremo assumption and woiild<br />
i1bean, am-ong other things, a sqtieeze belng pbt on those, predominantly<br />
sm-iall, businesses that would not benefit from payroll tax abolition.<br />
At the other extreme one could assume that businesses would seek to<br />
use the redu-tion in costs to boost profits rather than to pass it<br />
on in lower prices-. The miore that this hanppened the less would<br />
be the effect on prices.<br />
B~ ut even if there were some direct effect on prices, this is only<br />
part of the story. Mr Whitlan proposed a " package deal", with<br />
the 1977-78 Budget income tax reductions being " traded off" in<br />
Mr Whitlam'S words, for the abolition of payroll tax.<br />
This would have one immediate indirect effect on prices.<br />
it would no longier be possibleto expect wage restraint in exchange<br />
for the tax cuts.<br />

incon6 tax , C~ tshin. 1977-78 is estimated at $ 400 Million that -is,<br />
$ 450 Million Jlrs-than the cost of abojition of payroll tax<br />
for the half Yeir-This e. 450 Million-could be mrostly met by<br />
effectively.-abolishing tax indexation for the rest of the ' year<br />
or byk puttirig UPte rates Of tax. AJ-ternatively, it could<br />
be added to this year's deficit, inv-' Chich case it would<br />
come ontpo the addition which Mr Whi-lam is already proposing,<br />
of bewen 150 million and $ 800) millio.. -a<br />
For 1978-79, there would be a similar, effect. -The cost of the<br />
abolition of payroll tax would exceed the increased personal income<br />
tax collectionis by a further $ 430 million. ' Again,-this could be.<br />
mot~ by the abolition of tax indexation. Alternatively it could be<br />
met by additions to the deficit.<br />
Mr Whitlam has not said what-lie would do about there additions<br />
to the deficit, if. that is-what lie proposes-These additions would<br />
be over. and. above-what: he has admi-tted-to-.<br />
We are _ thus talking about the possibility of very large expansion S in<br />
the-def ic! t with, presumably, epxansion in the money supply of<br />
siinilar. order.. For examples-, unless ha is to abolish. tax indexa-tion, on<br />
the basis. of his known plans, Mr Whitlam would appear to be contemplating<br />
anf increase in the Government's planned 6eficit: for 1977-78 in. the order<br />
of one-third to One-half. That cannot be regarded as fiscal responsibili<br />
Quite apart from the long-run effect of such action of pushing up<br />
prices, there are the short-rumn effects of killing confidence and<br />
ralisi ing inflationary expectations. On top of this is the apparent<br />
Labor wage Policy of supporting a high level of wage indexation..<br />
M-r Whitlan has not addressed himself to these questions.-<br />
I </p>
<p>3.<br />
I must conclude therefore that Mr Whitlam has no -on-going<br />
anti-inflation policy. He has no policy at all on this fundamental<br />
question. He has only tried to trick people that he has one,<br />
through deceptive drafting in his policy speech. Moreover.<br />
if there were any short-term, once-and-for-all effect on the<br />
Consumer Price Index through the abolition of payroll-tax it would<br />
be much less than 2 percent and would quickly be undone by the<br />
build-up of inflation resulting from the expanding deficit and<br />
money supply. </p>
