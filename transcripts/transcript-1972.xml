FOR PRESS: P. M. No. 104/ 1968<br />
PREMIERS' CONFERENCE<br />
Following is the text of letters exchanged by the Premier<br />
of New South Wales ( Mr. Askin) and the Prime Minister:-<br />
Mr. Askin's Letter ( dated 19 December)<br />
Dear Mr. Gorton, The State Premiers met yesterday in Adelaide<br />
to consider further the matters which they discussed in Sydney<br />
in October last and which have since been the subject of<br />
correspondence between us.<br />
With regard to the impact of recent wage changes<br />
on State finances, you did suggest that our Treasury officers<br />
should meet to establish the facts. In point of fact our respective<br />
Under Treasurers have met, and it seems to us that the information<br />
they have collated and which forms the basis of the statement<br />
which I am submitting with this letter, is quite straightforward<br />
and that there is no real necessity for Treasury discussions.<br />
The submission attached is on behalf of all the<br />
Premiers and shows that the impact of the National Wage Case<br />
on State finances for the present financial year will total<br />
$ 23 million. After allowing for the assessed effect of these<br />
increases on the tax reimbursement grant for this year, the<br />
net burden which the States must meet is roundly $ 14 million.<br />
As against this we have also been given figures to show that<br />
after meeting its own costs and allowing for the increase in<br />
the tax reimbursement grant under present formula arrangements)<br />
Commonwealth revenue will show a substantial net gain this year<br />
as a result of this wage decision.<br />
The attached statement also shows the costs in<br />
which the States have been involved in respect of their recurrent<br />
expenditure because of other award changes since the June<br />
Conference, and with the national wage case costs the figures<br />
aggregate $ 48 million for this year alone.<br />
At the unanimous request of all Premiers and<br />
with a sense of great urgency, I now ask that you meet us to<br />
discuss the information which I am now submitting and to<br />
consider how our problems can be met. / 2 </p>
<p>-2<br />
While naturally we would prefer these discussions<br />
to be with you personally, if it should be that your commitments<br />
preclude you from doing this we would be prepared to talk with<br />
the Deputy Prime Minister and the Treasurer.<br />
What I have said does not cover the major issue<br />
of Commonwealth-State financial relationships generally. We<br />
also desire to discuss this problem with you as soon as it can<br />
be arranged. Yours faithfully,<br />
R. W. ASKIN<br />
Premier and Treasurer.<br />
Prime Minister's Letter ( dated 27 December)<br />
Dear Mr. Askin, I am writing to acknowledge the receipt on<br />
23 December of your letter of 19 December. I note that you<br />
have attached to it information collated by the Under Treasurers<br />
of each State and that it seems to you that there should be no<br />
real necessity for discussions between our Treasury officials<br />
and those of the individual States. I have referred the information<br />
you supplied to my colleague, the Treasurer, as clearly we must<br />
have it examined by our own Treasury officers. I assume that.<br />
if they are unable to agree with your figures you would not, speaking<br />
for New South Wales, object to their communicating and discussing<br />
with your Treasury officers any queries they may have?<br />
It is my intention to propose a Premiers' conference<br />
in the New Year to discuss the financial arrangements, as from<br />
1 July 1969, concerning roads. This could also provide the<br />
opportunity you request for you and your colleagues to discuss<br />
with us the problems, and the submitted information, mentioned<br />
in paragraph 5 of your letter. Having regard to my commitments<br />
arising from the Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference, I<br />
suggest that we meet in Canberra on Thursday, 13 March, continuing<br />
as necessary on Friday, 14 March. Our new Parliamentary sittings<br />
are to begin on 25 February and the dates I mention will be the first<br />
recess in those sittings. Yours sincerely,<br />
J. G. GORTON.<br />
CA NBERRA<br />
31 December 1968 </p>
