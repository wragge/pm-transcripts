    <content><![CDATA[<p><strong>6 October 1983</strong></p>
<p>The Prime Minister today sent the following message to Mr Lech Walesa:</p>
<p>" On behalf of the Government and people of Australia I congratulate you warmly on being awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for 1983. The courage, determination and dignity with which you have sought to ensure respect for the rights of Polish workers to freedom of association have won the admiration of governments and workers in many parts of the world.</p>
<p>You have always pursued your objectives by peaceful means often in the face of provocation and harassment. </p>
<p>You have pressed for a solution to the problems of Polish workers on the basis of reconciliation and consensus. This has been an example to the many peoples of the world whose strong desire to exercise their fundamental human <br />rights and freedoms is frustrated. I wish you success in your work for a peaceful and prosperous Poland."</p>
