MR WHITLAM'S OVERSEAS VISIT, APRIL 1973<br />
Attached is the text of a statement delivered<br />
to the House of Representatives on 1 May 1973 by the<br />
Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs,<br />
Mr E. G. Whitlam. </p>
<p>I wish to report quite briefly to Parliament on the<br />
overseas visit from which I returned yesterday. Subject to the<br />
requirements of the legislative program, I hope later in the<br />
session to be able to make a comprehensive statement to the House<br />
on the broad perspectives of the Government's foreign policy.<br />
Honourable Members will know that I led the Auistralian<br />
Delegation to the Fourth Meeting of the Pacific Forum from<br />
17 to 19 April in Apia, Western Samoa. For the first time there,<br />
seven Commonwealth countries were represented by their Heads<br />
of Government, as were the two countries with observer utatus,<br />
Papua New Guinea and Niue. Through leading the Delegation to<br />
this meeting myself I wished to emphasise the very deep interest<br />
which the Government takes in the affairs of the South Pacific.<br />
The Australian Government seeks to play a co-operative and<br />
helpful role in this area but in no way wishes to dominate in<br />
the region. The Forum itself is so arranged that the great differences<br />
in size and economic strength between Australia and New Zealand<br />
on the one hand and the Pacific Islands on the other can be<br />
ameliorated by meeting as equals in its informal atmosphiere.<br />
I believe that on this occasion, as before, the meeting<br />
of the Forum was useful and successful. I am sure that these<br />
meetings will continue to consoli9--te regional co-operation between<br />
Austrailia and New Zealand and the islanders in the South Pacific.<br />
At its first session, the F~ orum adopted a Joint<br />
Declaration deploring French nuclear tests in the Pacific. This<br />
declaration was an Australian initiative fully supported by the<br />
Prime Minister of New Zealand, Mr Kirk, and promptly agreed to<br />
by all other members of the Forum. We hoped that a declaration<br />
would have more impact than a reference in the communique. We<br />
were able to cable this declaration to Paris on the first day of<br />
the meeting while the Attorney-General, Senator Murphy, was there<br />
for the talks which he was conducting at that time with the French<br />
Government. </p>
<p>The Forum also requested me to take up with the British<br />
Government later in my visit the question of French tests in the<br />
Pacific, since that. Government is responsible for dependent<br />
territories in the area including Pitcairn Island, the British<br />
Solomon Islands Protectorate, the Gilbert and Ellice Islands<br />
Colony and, in part, the New Hebrides. This I did.<br />
I was also pleased to announce to the Forum a voluntary<br />
contribution of $ NZ250, OOO for 1974. This contribution, which is<br />
made to the South Pacific Commission, is in excess of our assessed<br />
contribution and in addition to the SA15 million three-year aid<br />
program announced in 1972.<br />
Fiji, and other members of the Forum, also accepted an<br />
Australian proposal that there should be a conference of Labour<br />
Ministers from Forum countries to discuss labour and related<br />
matters in Australia later in the year.<br />
I also indicated Australia's willingness to organise<br />
an international training course in export development for the<br />
island members of the Forum in Australia in November.<br />
I left the Forum for Vancouver and London before the<br />
final day, on which the Special Minister of State led the Australian<br />
Delegation. In Vancouver, the Prime Ministe~ r of Canada, Mr Pierre<br />
Trudeau, extended to me the courtesy of meeting me in Vancouver<br />
for private talks while my aircraft was in transit,<br />
The value of these talks was in no way diminished by<br />
the informality of the occasion and they confirmed my long-held<br />
belief that there are many areas in which Australia and Canada<br />
should co-operate more closely than in the past. We face similar<br />
problems in relation to our need to improve the status of our<br />
Aboriginal people. We face similar problems related to Foreign<br />
ownership and foreign investment. We can, I believe, develop * a &amp;/ 3 </p>
<p>-3-<br />
fruitful and more regular consultations on trade matters of<br />
common interest, our approach to questions in the United Nations,<br />
and law of the sea and multi-national corporations.<br />
I have arranged with Mr Trudeau that our Governments<br />
should consult more closely and directly on these mL-ters and<br />
that we should telephone each other as a matter of course when<br />
matters of mutual interest arise which affect Canada and<br />
Australia. Before going into details about my London discussions,<br />
I would like to place on record the Government's general approach<br />
to relations with the United Kingdom.<br />
The Australian Government's aim is to make our<br />
relations with Britain an integral and important part of our<br />
general international relations and not something apart as they<br />
have tended to be in the past.<br />
Our relationship with Britain is inevitably changing.<br />
The changes we have made or propose to make on such matters as<br />
the powers of the Governor-General, appeals to the Privy Council,<br />
a new national anthem, the Queen's Style and Titles and the<br />
amendment of the oath of allegiance are in no way directed<br />
against Britain. They are solely intended to put our relationship<br />
on a more mature and con ;-emporary basis and to reflect the<br />
development of a more -dependent Australian identity in the<br />
world. Indeed, what the Australian Government is seeking to<br />
achieve in its relations not only with Britain but with a number<br />
of other countries the United States, China, Canada, and our<br />
Asian neighbours, for instance is to give formal recognition<br />
to what has already happened, as the necessary foundation for a<br />
realistic, more independent, more mature foreign policy. What<br />
we seek to do is no artificial convulsion of contrived nationalism.<br />
This is certainly well understoo(' and appreciated in London. </p>
<p>-4-<br />
My talks with Mr Heath, Sir Alec Douglas Home, Lord<br />
Carrington, Lord Hailsham ana other Ministers covered a wide<br />
range of matters of mutual interest in the foreign affairs,<br />
defence and constitutional fields.<br />
I explained to Sir Alec Douglas Home and other<br />
Ministers and officials the decision of the South Pacific Forum<br />
in relation to French nuclear tests. I said that I was not<br />
speaking only on behalf of Australia but of the seven countries<br />
of the Forum, all of which were associated with the Commonwealth.<br />
I indicated that the Forumn countries believe the United Kingdom<br />
should talk to the French. This would appear to be a natural<br />
consequence of our close Commonwealth relations, of Britain's<br />
major role in the negotiation of the partial Nuclear Test Ban<br />
Treaty and of its responsibilities, as an administering power,<br />
in respect of a number of Pacific territories. Honourable<br />
Members will be pleased to know that Sir Alec Douglas Home said<br />
he would study the views expressed at the Pacific Forum meeting<br />
and by myself and that he would draw them to the attention of<br />
the French Government. Sir Alec also pointed out that the<br />
United Kingdom had already urged the French to sign the partial<br />
Nuclear Test Ban Treaty.<br />
In Rome I was received by His Holiness the Pope in<br />
private audience. I regard myself as privileged to have been<br />
able to discuss many matters with this gentle and wise man.<br />
He welcomes the establishment between Australia and the Vatican<br />
of diplomatic relations, as a convenient means of communication<br />
and as facilitating the practical matters which need to be<br />
transacted. The Holy Father said, however, that even this<br />
sensible development of diplomatic machinery could not increase<br />
the depth of his regard for Australia and its people, and the<br />
warmth of his recollections of ' his visit to this country.<br />
I took advantage of my brief visit to Rome to call<br />
on the senior Italian minister in Rome during my visit, Signor<br />
Golombo, who is, as honourable members will know, the </p>
<p>predecessor of the present Prime Minister of Italy, Signor<br />
Andreotti, who was away from Italy. Signor Colombo has an<br />
especially high reputation in E. E. C. circles.<br />
I outlined to Signor Colombo the present Government's<br />
thinking on foreign policy matters. I found a close identity<br />
of views between our two Governments on all matters which we<br />
discussed, for example, the recognition of China and North<br />
Viet-Nam. I also explained to Signor Colombo our attitude to<br />
continued French nuclear testing in the Pacific. I posed the<br />
question to him that, if the tests were as clear and as harmless<br />
as the French suggested, then could they not be conducted in<br />
Corsica. I was given to understand in clear terms that the<br />
Italian Government understood the concern of Australia, New<br />
Zealand and the Pacific Islanders in a continued atmospheric<br />
testing in the Pacific and I was left in no doubt as to what<br />
the reaction of Italy would be if the French were to conduct<br />
nuclear tests in the Mediterranean.<br />
On the way home I had talks in Mauritius with the<br />
Governor-General and the Prime Minister and Leader of the<br />
Labour Party, Sir Seewoosagur Ramgoolam. I told the Prime<br />
Minister that we would welcome Mauritian representation in<br />
Australia and, apart from our need for area consultation, the<br />
opportunity that this might provide to tell Australians of the<br />
great pleasure they could derive from visiting the star and<br />
key of the Indian Ocean; that we were happy with the way in<br />
which the 26,000 migrants from Mauiitius have settled without<br />
difficulties in Australia. I also assured the Prime Minister<br />
that our modest aid program under the Special Commonwealth<br />
African Assistance Plan would continue, and offered further<br />
assistance in the trade promotion field and marketing.<br />
I raised, as I did in each country I visited, the<br />
question of French atmospheric nuclear tests. The House will<br />
understand that traditional French influence in Mauritius is / 6 </p>
<p>-6-<br />
substantial. Nevertheless, the Prime Minister indicated that he<br />
would consider what he might say on this matter when he visits<br />
Taris shortly, and, in the meantime, indicated that he would have<br />
the question raised with the French Ambassador in Mauritius. The<br />
Prime Minister is clearly aware that, travelling as it does from<br />
west to east, fall-out from French testing affects his country as<br />
much as it does ours.<br />
In conclusion, I would inform the House that during the<br />
14 days I was away, including Easter Week, I believe I was able to<br />
emphasise our growing interest in regional co-operation in the<br />
South Pacific, to take steps to put our constitutional relationship<br />
with the United Kingdom on a more mature and rational basis and<br />
to clear away any misconceptions that may have existed about our<br />
relations with the United Kingdom, to establish as Prime Minister<br />
personal contact with Her Majesty the Queen and the Pope, and to<br />
pay a goodwill visit to the small but important Commonwealth<br />
country of Mauritius.<br />
In each of the four areas in which I stopped, the South<br />
Pacific, the United Kingdom, Italy and Mauritius, I was able to<br />
outline the general direction of the Government's foreign policies<br />
and the more independent stance we are taking in four diverse and<br />
widely separated areas of the world. </p>
