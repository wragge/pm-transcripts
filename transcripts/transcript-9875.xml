SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
LAUNCH OF THE COMMONWEALTH HOUSING POLICY,<br />
COMMUNITYAND NATION -BEENLEIGH, 11 DECEMBER 1995<br />
It is a real pleasure to be here.<br />
A nation's success depends on adapting to change and preparing for future<br />
needs. That is why there could be no more appropriate place to launch this<br />
Statement than here in Beenleigh.<br />
Everywhere you look around here there is change. Yet there are also<br />
unmistakable signs that traditions are continuing and that a sense of<br />
community has been retained.<br />
This is a community centre, after all, and it sits between two old landmarks, the<br />
Power Brewery and the famous Yatala Pie Shop which has been an institution<br />
in these parts since World War 11.<br />
Cities need traditions and a sense of continuity because people need these<br />
things. We need to be part of the story. And we need to be part of<br />
communities. We need to belong.<br />
But we need to balance these needs with the need for change. Because we<br />
need investment and growth to create opportunities and jobs, we need the sort<br />
of change which is happening here. And because Australia and the world<br />
Australians live in is changing all the time, we need the sorts of change this<br />
Statement brings.<br />
Last Wednesday in Melbourne I launched the Government's Innovation and<br />
Information Statement. Today, we launch this housing Statement. We have<br />
called it Community and Nation. Both of these Statements are essential steps<br />
on the way to a stronger, more secure and more dynamic Australian social<br />
democracy. The Innovation Statement described major new investments in Australian<br />
industry, technology and telecommunications. It recognised that to keep </p>
<p>Australia in the first rank of nations we need to be at the forefront of technology<br />
and ideas.<br />
The Statement was an investment in ideas: it contained strategies for making<br />
Australian ideas, and world ideas, work for Australia.<br />
It was also an investment in best practice, in making Australian business and<br />
industry as efficient and productive and creative as any in the world.<br />
It was an investment in small business, because it is in small and medium<br />
sized enterprises that ideas become products, Australian products.<br />
We also invested in markets, particularly in the great markets of our region,<br />
because it is on overseas markets that the success of these small businesses<br />
largely depends.<br />
And it was an investment in jobs the jobs of the future which will increasingly<br />
come from these knowledge-based industries and the entrepreneurs who<br />
provide their energy.<br />
The Innovation Statement went much further than questions of technology,<br />
industry and finance. It was a Statement about the kind of Australia we want,<br />
the kind of society we want.<br />
We were concerned with the application of telecommunications technology in<br />
ways which will bring benefits to the greatest number of Australians; including<br />
those for whom this technology creates an opportunity to escape from social,<br />
economic and personal disadvantage. It was a Statement, as I said, to bring<br />
us all closer together.<br />
And so is this housing Statement, Community and Nation.<br />
In so far as the Innovation Statement was an investment in the wealth of the<br />
nation and jobs and opportunity for the Australian people, it was investment in<br />
Australian social democracy. It was done to help provide the foundations of<br />
our future prosperity and strengthen the bonds between us.<br />
Community and Nation expresses the same ambition. It comes from a different<br />
angle, but the ultimate goal is the same.<br />
If it is not already obvious, the example of other countries should make it clear:<br />
we cannot have a fair and just society, one in which opportunity and freedom<br />
abound, if we do not have a strong, flexible, world class economy. But it is just<br />
as true that the most dynamic economy does not guarantee fair and just social<br />
results.<br />
Those social results depend on the willingness of governments to<br />
imaginatively and sensibly intervene. It depends, not just on good intentions<br />
and good feelings, but on good policy. It depends on applying ourselves to </p>
<p>social policy with the same rigour and intelligence we bring to industry or<br />
telecommunications or the economy.<br />
And that is what we have done, I believe, with Community and Nation.<br />
Housing is fundamental. Cities are fundamental.<br />
We are talking about the environment in which Australians live. In which we<br />
work and raise families. There are no better measures real or symbolic of<br />
how well we are succeeding as a nation and as a society than the quality of<br />
our housing and the nature of our cities.<br />
Cities symbolise our economic and social ambitions and measure how<br />
earnestly we pursue them. They are essential repositories of our continuing<br />
traditions and community values, yet they are also a measure of our dynamism<br />
and modernity.<br />
Look at some of the richest countries in the world even the richest and you<br />
see the results of inadequate planning and infrastructure, all of it ultimately<br />
reflecting inadequate responses to social and economic change and ordinary<br />
human need.<br />
Look and you will see stark evidence of the fact that poor quality housing and<br />
poor urban environments mean greatly reduced opportunities, greatly<br />
increased crime and other social problems.<br />
Not only do such cities inflict environmental hardship and deprivation on large<br />
numbers of their inhabitants, they entrench poverty and disadvantage, they<br />
entrench crime and despair.<br />
You see the manifestations of poverty and crime, but what you don't see is the<br />
economic, social and human cost. You can count the cost of law enforcement<br />
or drug programs, or social welfare; but you can't count the cost to the nation's<br />
social cohesion and self-esteem. And you can't count the cost of wasted talent<br />
and ambition.<br />
When poverty is passed on from one generation to another we all lose. When<br />
we condemn generations to poverty the loss of human energy and creativity is<br />
immeasurable.<br />
As this Statement says, in Australia we have largely avoided the worst of these<br />
problems. However, there is no denying they exist. There is equally no doubt<br />
that the potential for them to multiply is real and immediate.<br />
That is the principal reason for this Statement. If we are to maintain our social<br />
cohesion and keep faith with our traditional egalitarian ambitions, we need to<br />
respond to economic, social and demographic realities. If we are to break the<br />
poverty traps and broaden the fight against unemployment particularly youth<br />
unemployment, we need to respond now. </p>
<p>This is a Statement to meet modern realities and future needs. It proposes a<br />
long term reform agenda which will go a long way towards ensuring that in the<br />
21 st century Australia's characteristic way of life will be maintained.<br />
This Statement provides for a fundamental reform to housing assistance for<br />
Australians on lower incomes. We hope to enlarge their realm of opportunity<br />
by providing accommodation which meets their family needs and puts<br />
education, training, employment and services within their reach. We aim to<br />
give them better housing and more choice, more options.<br />
Housing is one of the largest components in most families' budgets. Yet the<br />
benefits provided by public housing are the smallest component of the social<br />
wage. While the benefits to a few people may be high, the average benefit is<br />
low because few people can get into public housing.<br />
Under these reforms the Commonwealth will take a much greater responsibility<br />
for providing housing assistance. The reform package will underwrite:<br />
substantial increases in rent assistance for about 500,000 people on<br />
low incomes in private rental housing who might otherwise have to wait<br />
years to get into public housing<br />
the maintenance of a strong public housing sector without financial<br />
disadvantage to existing tenants<br />
subsidies for new tenants in public housing to guarantee that they pay<br />
no more than 25 per cent of their income in rent<br />
a wider choice in housing and location for people on low incomes<br />
the renewal of old public housing estates<br />
the development of benchmarks of affordability for low income renters,<br />
and in consultation with the States, the creation of a new Consumer Code of<br />
Practice.<br />
The linchpin of Community and Nation is a radical reform to the<br />
Commonwealth/ State Housing Agreement indeed we propose to negotiate<br />
with the States a newagreement, one which addresses present and future<br />
needs.<br />
The first Commonwealth/ State Housing Agreement dates from 1945 when it<br />
was introduced to provide public housing for people working in expanding<br />
post-war industries. In the fifty years since that first Agreement, nearly<br />
400,000 houses have been built. </p>
<p>The people who designed that first agreement had ambitions not unlike our<br />
own. To quote from a report of the Commonwealth Housing Commission at the<br />
time: We consider that housing is essentially an expression of the way of<br />
life of people and that, therefore, it is impossible to separate housing<br />
from a consideration of the broader aspects of the life of the people<br />
from such questions as how and where they earn their living and how<br />
and where they spend their leisure.<br />
These were enlightened sentiments, but the old approach to public housing no<br />
longer delivers what we need.<br />
Many of our housing estates are ageing. The houses are ill-suited to the<br />
composition of families today. They are not located where the jobs are.<br />
And waiting lists which now stand at well over 200,000 continue to grow.<br />
Despite major increases in rent assistance, over 40 per cent of recipients still<br />
pay more than 30 per cent of their income in rent.<br />
The time has clearly come for a reform as basic as that first Agreement.<br />
What the Commonwealth is proposing today is a package to help people live<br />
where the job, training and other opportunities are.<br />
These reforms are about providing greater flexibility in the provision of public<br />
housing. And they are about making housing more affordable for those renting<br />
private houses. The housing reform package we are putting forward today is<br />
about providing opportunities for a better future for many Australians.<br />
The Commonwealth today proposes a package to help Australians live where<br />
the jobs, training and other opportunities are.<br />
These reforms will provide greater flexibility in the provision of public housing<br />
and they will make renting private houses more affordable.<br />
Accordingly, we will seek from the States a fundamental realignment in roles<br />
and responsibilities. We will offer to take over full responsibility for housing<br />
support for people on low incomes, including responsibility for the subsidy<br />
implicit in public housing rental rates. In turn, the States will be asked to<br />
vacate the public housing rental subsidy arrangements and to take<br />
responsibility for the supply and management of public housing.<br />
This increase in Commonwealth responsibilities will require a transfer of funds<br />
from States to the Commonwealth. That is, those funds now employed by the<br />
States in the provision of these subsidies would be turned to the hand of the<br />
Commonwealth. The reforms will be budget neutral across the<br />
Commonwealth, State and Territories. </p>
<p>The Statement contains a set of key principles for service providers including<br />
the development of a Consumer Code of Practice.<br />
It is important to stress that people currently living in public housing will not be<br />
affected financially by the proposed reforms; and in future, public housing<br />
tenants will pay no more than 25 per cent of their income in rent for<br />
appropriate housing.<br />
However, the principal target of this Statement is a group of Australians who<br />
far outnumber those in public housing. There are 400,000 Australians in<br />
public housing. But there are around 976,000 people receiving assistance for<br />
private rental.<br />
In recent years, we have significantly increased assistance for people on low<br />
incomes in the private rental market. In 1986 we extended rent assistance to<br />
the unemployed, and in 1987 to low income working families. And we have<br />
increased the rates of assistance. For a couple with one or two children, rent<br />
assistance has increased by almost $ 21 a week in real terms since 1983 an<br />
increase of more than 100 per cent.<br />
Nevertheless, there is a huge gap between those receiving rent assistance<br />
and those in public housing, even for people on similar incomes. On average,<br />
rent assistance is worth $ 1,500 per annum for a household. But the public<br />
housing subsidy is worth an average of $ 3,800.<br />
Under the reforms we propose the Commonwealth will use the funds flowing<br />
from the realignment of roles and responsibilities not only to pay directly for the<br />
subsidies of public housing tenants, but also to substantially improve<br />
assistance for those renting privately.<br />
But the primary aim of this Statement is to substantially improve the choices<br />
open to those people on low incomes. There is no doubt that the current<br />
arrangements make it difficult for people to get the housing that best suits<br />
them. There are people in public housing who want to move closer to job<br />
opportunities but are frightened of losing the security and financial support that<br />
public housing provides.<br />
There are others sitting it out on long waiting lists for public housing because<br />
they cannot afford to pay the extra costs of private rental.<br />
The fact is that many Australians take up these advantages, even though it is a<br />
long way from their families and communities and from employment and<br />
training opportunities.<br />
The great change the Government seeks is that people on low incomes get<br />
access to housing that is appropriate to their needs meaning principally<br />
employment, education and services, which are the sources of opportunity. </p>
<p>The implementation of these reforms is contingent on successful negotiations<br />
with the States. If they are to proceed, we will need to agree a satisfactory<br />
adjustment to financial assistance grants to reflect the Commonwealth's<br />
increased responsibilities on the income support side.<br />
My colleague, Brian Howe, has already advanced discussions with the States<br />
through meetings with State Housing Ministers.<br />
We will also need to agree on a new results-based approach to public housing,<br />
with clear performance indicators.<br />
And the States will need to undertake the responsibility for providing an<br />
adequate supply of affordable housing in appropriate locations.<br />
The Government has proposed to the States and Territories an Interim<br />
Agreement for up to three years from 1 July 1996, based upon existing<br />
arrangements and funding levels, during which many of the building blocks for<br />
the new model can be put in place.<br />
Under the reforms, the States and Territories will have much greater flexibility<br />
in the provision, financing, pricing and efficient management of the public<br />
housing stock. The States and Territories will have more autonomy in<br />
managing their housing programs within an agreed needs framework, a<br />
change which will provide more accountability in property and tenancy<br />
management arrangements.<br />
As I said, the States will be required to supply appropriate housing where it is<br />
needed and that will mean increases in the supply to some areas. However,<br />
the States will be able to consider alternative suppliers and commercial<br />
financing options.<br />
These key changes will allow them to provide more appropriate assistance to<br />
the needs of public housing renters. They will be able to respond to client<br />
needs through a wider range of mechanisms, including leasing in the private<br />
market rather than constructing purpose-built dwellings. This will provide a<br />
substantial and continuing boost to the housing industry. The States and their<br />
authorities will be able to develop a much closer relationship with tenants and<br />
that should mean better results for everyone.<br />
We will seek a better standard of service for people in public housing. At<br />
present, most public housing authorities fill a dual role: they manage the<br />
public housing stock and help potential clients with their accommodation.<br />
As part of the microeconomic reform process, we will seek the separation of<br />
these roles in order to provide a more concerted focus on client needs and<br />
more efficient property management practices. T </p>
<p>In Sydney, Better Cities is creating the Parramatta link and Blacktown<br />
station. In Melbourne, it is electrifying the rail in Melbourne's South East and<br />
South West corridors.<br />
That is to nominate just some of the projects.<br />
And of course here in Beenleigh, just over three years ago I had the pleasure<br />
of launching the Beenleigh to Robina rail project under the Better Cities banner<br />
in the company of my colleague, Premier Wayne Goss. So I hardly need tell<br />
you that it is a matter of great satisfaction to travel on this railway today.<br />
I also hardly need to say that it is even more satisfying to announce another<br />
million in capital funds for the Better Cities program over the next three<br />
years. This funding will be used for projects in three priority areas.<br />
We will continue to pursue programs of urban renewal, particularly in some of<br />
our older public housing estates.<br />
Our second priority is to improve the links to those international gateways<br />
which connect us to the world. As part of this strategy, the Commonwealth will<br />
contribute to the acquisition of land for a rail corridor to Sydney West Airport.<br />
This contribution will be subject to the New South Wales Government meeting<br />
certain conditions, including agreement on land use around the new airport,<br />
and a timetable and strategy for the rail and road links.<br />
The third priority is to make a better fist of managing development in our major<br />
urban growth corridors. Brisbane to the Gold Coast is an obvious one and<br />
hence our commitment to the railway.<br />
Another example is Mandurah, south west of Perth, where rapid population<br />
and industry growth has put great pressure on infrastructure and services,<br />
particularly transport and water.<br />
Under Better Cities, an integrated approach to management is developing a<br />
rail transit system to service half a million people and clever ways of handling<br />
water, sewerage and urban runout, to improve coast and river quality and<br />
reduce demands for scarce water.<br />
There have been a lot of mistakes made over the years, there has been a lot of<br />
neglect and myopia. These projects prove not only that we have learnt from<br />
our mistakes, but that we can rectify them.<br />
Better Cities has proved just what its name says after generations of<br />
indifference and thwarted good intentions we can build better cities. </p>
<p>By the same means we hope to eliminate the poverty traps and the alienating<br />
and dispiriting environments in which too many Australians live.<br />
We agree with the remarks made by Father David Cappo of the Australian<br />
Catholic Social Welfare Commission last week when he said that we need to<br />
provide not just houses for people but homes.<br />
And I sincerely hope that the States and Territories will come to the<br />
negotiations with this in mind and in this spirit.<br />
We have an opportunity to make a fundamental and profound improvement not<br />
only to our housing and our cities, but to the quality of our society and the well<br />
being of a great number of our fellow Australians.<br />
At the same time as we pursue this reform we must continue to renew our<br />
urban environment.<br />
Of course, we were not the first to believe in the planning and renewal of our<br />
cities. The Whitlam Government made a concerted effort to solve the<br />
problems. And there were sporadic attempts in the years separating that<br />
government from the original Commonwealth Housing Commission. The<br />
Commission itself was insisting on planning back in 1945, even going so far as<br />
to say that the States should receive no financial assistance unless they had<br />
enacted legislation for regional and town planning.<br />
There have been many successes, but it is safe to say that neither the States<br />
nor the Commonwealth have consistently lived up to these good intentions.<br />
The Better Cities program provides evidence that we can live up to them, and<br />
repair some of the damage.<br />
I have visited any number of major projects in the past couple of years and I<br />
have to say it has been one of the more inspiring experiences. Better Cities is<br />
quite literally revitalising city centres and urban environments around the<br />
continent. In doing so it is conferring very considerable benefits on the<br />
Australian people and on the Australian economy.<br />
In Newcastle, Better Cities' funds have helped restore historic buildings,<br />
construct sea walls and realign roads and build bridges to link the city centre to<br />
major residential developments.<br />
In Stirling, in Western Australia, an electric rail link to the Perth CBD,<br />
constructed with Better Cities funding, has made local businesses more viable<br />
and life more convenient for residents.<br />
In Elizabeth and Munno Para in South Australia, Better Cities funding is<br />
helping to create affordable housing close to centres of employment, education<br />
and community services. </p>
<p>The Taskforce, working in consultation with State, Territory and local<br />
governments, will seek the means of increasing competition through a<br />
coherent national approach to regulation.<br />
The national approach to regulation will allow consumers a wider choice of<br />
builders, more affordable choices in designs and materials, better quality<br />
homes and a more efficient building industry.<br />
There is some indication of the potential benefits of a national approach. The<br />
Australian model code of residential development, which was released in 1990,<br />
has been widely accepted and is helping people design and build attractive<br />
affordable housing in well planned communities.<br />
The name of this Statement, like the Statement itself, originated in Brian's<br />
office. It suits the man as much as it suits the statement.<br />
Brian Howe is leaving the parliament at the next election and it will be a<br />
distinguished record of public service he leaves behind him. If this is not his<br />
crowning glory it is at least a very big and bright last feather in his cap.<br />
I know that it has been one of Brian's great ambitions to correct that inequality<br />
in our national life which sees a very large number of Australians in private<br />
rental accommodation living with an unwarranted and quite unjustifiable<br />
disadvantage. In the end the justice and the wisdom of his proposal was<br />
irresistible. Brian Howe has been an outstanding member of this Labor Government. He<br />
is, of course, a man of the left but more than that, a man of passionate<br />
conviction. He is also and just as importantly a good politician and a<br />
conscientious and responsible Minister. History will show that he never put his<br />
great desire for reform ahead of what was-on the day practical and necessary,<br />
both for the Government and the nation.<br />
That's why I say the title of this Statement is so appropriate. It is an<br />
expression of Brian's belief in the community of men and women. He believes<br />
in the values of ordinary people; in their capacity, if they are given a chance, to<br />
lead good creative lives and collectively do great things. And he believes that<br />
it is Labor's mission and a government's duty to give them that chance.<br />
Brian also believes in the Australian nation. He believes that for all the vast<br />
distances and cultural differences which separate us, we are, in the last<br />
analysis, all Australians living in one nation; and we do best when we adopt a<br />
national approach and put the national interest first.<br />
He is a communitarian and a nationalist. In this he gives expression to a great<br />
tradition. He has been a proud bearer of that tradition in the Commonwealth<br />
Parliament and he leaves it knowing that in no small way this Statement will<br />
continue to bear it for him. </p>
<p>And there are many good reasons for building them. Good urban design has<br />
profound benefits for the community, for the environment and for the economy.<br />
Good urban design can remove stress and difficulty, maximise efficiency and<br />
provide the essential " glue" for a community. It can link us both to the future<br />
and our past. It can express our values and ambitions.<br />
Good urban design is also an essential element of good environmental<br />
practice. With good design we can protect natural habitats, prevent<br />
contamination of land and water, improve micro climates and raise community<br />
awareness of environmental issues.<br />
And good urban design also is a powerful force in economic activity. Good<br />
urban design can be a decisive factor in attracting investment. It can give<br />
cities a significant comparative advantage. An OECD report recommends that<br />
cities wishing to stimulate economic activity should invest in infrastructure and<br />
the quality of their urban environments.<br />
These are powerful arguments and cities which have heeded them in Europe,<br />
like Lyon and Munich, are reaping great benefits. In Australia it may be we are<br />
inclined to take our relatively comfortable and easy way of life too much for<br />
granted. If we are to maintain these comforts into the 21 st century and<br />
compete effectively in the front rank of nations we are going to have to take<br />
urban design and planning much more seriously than we have so far in our<br />
history. We hope that this Statement will in time be seen as a turning point in the way<br />
we think about our cities.<br />
Housing is one of our most important industries. It contributes over five per<br />
cent of GDP. In 1994-95 about $ 22.9 billion was spent on new houses,<br />
renovations and additions.<br />
Over the next ten years we will need to add another 1.5 million dwellings to the<br />
6.9 million presently in existence. The fact is we will not be helped in this by<br />
the complex and contradictory web of housing regulations which afflicts the<br />
national housing industry.<br />
The Industry Commission has estimated that reform of building regulations and<br />
building approvals has the potential to deliver an increase in real GDP of one<br />
per cent. If that estimation is correct, reforms to the housing industry have the<br />
potential to deliver more than reforms to water, rail and road combined.<br />
In other words, the housing industry constitutes an area of the economy in<br />
need of major microeconomic reform. To do this the Government will establish<br />
a high-level Taskforce to develop a comprehensive national reform strategy. </p>
