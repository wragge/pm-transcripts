SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING, MP<br />
NATIONAL PRESS CLUB, CANBERRA, 5 MAY 1994<br />
f I were to begin with a quotation today, you might expect it to be fr~ om Ben Chifley<br />
or John Dedman, or Bevan or Beveridge, or some other author of a white paper on<br />
employment. I will begin with a quotation. It's a very simple quotation and its from Samuel<br />
Johnson, who is not generally regarded as one of the heroes of the Labor movement.<br />
Johnson said, " Inj a civilised society, we all depend upon each other".<br />
And I can't think of a better text for the day. I can't think of any more appropriate<br />
injunction for Australia in the 1990s or any better broad definition of what this<br />
Government is about.<br />
We are about a civilised society.<br />
And we shouldn't underestimate the forces working against us. Think of them. We<br />
are as culturally diverse as any country on earth. We have people among us who in<br />
other places are sworn enemies. But we do behave with proper regard for one<br />
another. Even though we have close to half a million long-term unemployed, we live<br />
in peace with one another.<br />
The other force potentially working against our sense of society is the necessity to be<br />
competitive. This might encourage us to think that the way to succeed is through a<br />
creed of dog-eat-dog.<br />
Some countries whose traditions should have instructed them better did read it that<br />
way in the last 20 years. They took the imperatives of economic progress to mean<br />
social regress.<br />
Australia did not. Australia in the last decade has stuck by it's civilised traditions. At<br />
every election, including the last when, after ten years of the same Party in office and<br />
the worst unemployment figures in sixty years, the temptation was great, the Australian<br />
people refuased to vote for a dog-eat-dog society.<br />
They stuck by the principles which have their origin in the birth of the Labor<br />
movement a century ago and in those true Liberals who believed that the imperatives<br />
of civilisation should temper self-interest.<br />
There was a profound lesson in last year's election. The people of Australia were given<br />
a genuine choice: should Australia take on the ethic of unmitigated self-interest? Or<br />
should they stand by their own values? </p>
<p>It will not have escaped some of you, that Labor won that election by making the<br />
difference as stark as possible. I know John Hewson has been inclined until recently to<br />
say that we ran a scare campaign.<br />
My answer to that is read Fightback. Remember what John Hewson said about the<br />
unemployed and the disadvantaged. The echoes of Thatcher and Reagan were clear<br />
and unmistakable.<br />
The notion that if you reach back for the poor and the weak they will drag you down,<br />
quite simply, stands for a set of values which Labor will never stand for and I don't<br />
believe Australians will ever stand for.<br />
That remark, as much as Fightback itself, threw down the political gauntlet. It<br />
challenged Australians to abandon a century-old tradition which even at its worst ( in<br />
Labor's eyes at least) his own Party had never totally abandoned. Labor did not run a<br />
scare campaign, it put the traditional view that " in a civilised society we all depend<br />
upon each other".<br />
Faced with this stark choice, the Australian people voted for their beliefs. They voted<br />
for one nation, not two. They voted for bringing the unemployed along with us. They<br />
voted for what I called policies of inclusion a phrase which our opponents are now<br />
using. This idea of " inclusion" is unremarkable. It simply encapsulates the idea of a nation<br />
even a nation which for all sorts of geographic, demographic and historical reasons is<br />
as loosely constructed as Australia. It encapsulates a nation of people as diverse and<br />
easy going and individualistic as Australians are.<br />
It poses no threat to that marvellous reality of Australian life and culture. It simply<br />
means that " we all depend upon each other".<br />
The fact that Johnson said it at a time when Britain was treating her own people<br />
abominably, hanging and flogging the poor and preparing to shovel them off to the<br />
other side of the world where they would be out of sight and out of mind, only goes to<br />
show that words are not enough the only proof is what people do.<br />
Whatever our problems as a Government since 1983, I hope we will at least be judged<br />
as a government which did things.<br />
Had words been enough for the Government in 1983, we would still be talking about<br />
the need for Australia to be a competitive country. We would still be talking about<br />
deregulating the economy. We would still be talking about lowering the tariff wall.<br />
We would still be talking about opening up to the world and succeeding not just in<br />
mining and agriculture, but as a manufacturing nation. We would still be talking very<br />
largely about succeeding in the Asia-Pacific.<br />
There are many things we would still be talking about. But instead we did them. In<br />
1994, Australian workers are doing them. The regions of Australia are doing them.<br />
And had we been satisfied with words alone, we might still be talking about the need<br />
for extensive and sophisticated social services. About what a nice thing it would be,<br />
and how consistent with our democratic pioneering traditions, if we implemented to an<br />
extent greater than any other country in the world the UN Convention on the<br />
Elimination of Discrimination Against Women.<br />
Or how we might one day recognise that this continent had belonged to Aboriginal and<br />
Torres Strait Islanders. We could very easily still be talking about these things, but we<br />
have done them. </p>
<p>In 1994 we live in a country which has few peers in the world in the way it has<br />
transformed its economy, developed its social services, extended freedom and<br />
opportunity, and maintained its values through an era of extraordinary change. We five<br />
in a country which has responded to every challenge.<br />
We should never underestimate this. Few, if any, generations of Australians have<br />
proven themselves more comprehending of what the challenge was and what was<br />
required to meet it.<br />
As a member of the Government in these last eleven years, I am proud that we painted<br />
a picture of the reality. As an Australian, I am much prouder of the fact that the<br />
people of this country recognised it. The Labor Party recognised it, the trade union<br />
movement and an increasingly large section of the business community, and the<br />
Australian electorate.<br />
They recognised that cooperation in workplaces was better than conflict. They<br />
recognised that we could be a manufacturing nation without a tariff wall. They<br />
recognised that we could succeed ini the Asia-Pacific.<br />
And why did they recognise it? Because they believed in themselves and that in their<br />
country there was a wellspring of potential which had not yet been tapped.<br />
They had what these days is called a vision and they knew that the best way of<br />
realising it was to work with a common purpose, to work together.<br />
In other words, they recognised that in a civilised society, we all depend upon each<br />
other. The White Paper I presented yesterday is prefaced with a reminder of the things I said<br />
on election night last year and on Australia Day this year. The words were that we<br />
would not leave the unemployed behind.<br />
There have been a few critics of this White Paper today who say that we should leave<br />
them behind. They say it in various ways. They do not say it directly. They say that<br />
to prepare the long-term unemployed for jobs, is to create competition for the shortterm<br />
unemployed.<br />
This is the moral equivalent of transportation. It is to say these people have lost their<br />
right to a job like other Australians and we have lost our capacity and our will to get<br />
them ready for a job. They are simply a problem and should be ignored. We won't<br />
have it.<br />
There is another argument which says that we shouldn't pick them up, and train them,<br />
and get them back into the labour market where they can enjoy, not just an income, but<br />
the self respect and social intercourse and creativity which work provides, because the<br />
cost is too high.<br />
This is the moral equivalent, not of transportation, but of keeping them on the hulks<br />
keeping them in jail because it is cheaper. It takes no account of what the cost of<br />
doing nothing is the cost to their lives and the cost to ours. The cost to our social<br />
cohesion and order if we were to allow an underclass of Australians to form.<br />
The cost also to our sk411 Ãµ . The cost of wasting this potential. The cost to our<br />
civilisation of saying that we don't depend upon each other that these people are<br />
expendable. </p>
<p>There is another argument that has been put. It says that the only way that we will<br />
create jobs for these people is to so change our industrial relations system that wage<br />
rates and conditions of employment will be debased.<br />
This, it seems to me, would be to betray the unemployed as profoundly as neglect<br />
would betray them. It would be truly a cruel hoax on Australia.<br />
This argument says we will substitute an army of working poor for unemployment. It<br />
says we will abandon our goals of a good and equitable society, we will lower our gaze<br />
to a society where differentials of wealth are wide and profound. We Will have the<br />
same problems of social disorder and alienation and decay but we will have the<br />
unemployment figure down a couple of notches.<br />
The argument is not only devious, regressive and deceitful, it's fundamentally wrong.<br />
As the Green Paper pointed out, cutting wages in the great depression did not produce<br />
a surge in employment. It made those high-minded, comfortable, middle-class<br />
economists feel very morally superior, just as it makes some of our own academic and<br />
journalistic pundits feel superior but it didn't solve the problem then, and it won't<br />
solve it now.<br />
Many of you would have read the Phillip Knightley article recently in which he<br />
described how in Great Britain they have lowered wages security guards can be paid<br />
as little as $ 2.50 an hour for an 84 hour week. There are women doing piece work for<br />
$ 6.30 a day. The chairman of the company employing them at that rate earned<br />
$ 270,000 a year. He said " we wouldn't get the productivity if we paid an hourly rate".<br />
I will never accept for Australia the notion of a competitive economy being a synonym<br />
for social regression.<br />
Nor do I have to describe to people here the tragedy of American poverty. Some of<br />
our opponents point to the American unemployment rate of 6 1/ 2 per cent and say that<br />
is the model for us to follow. To which I would reply if you would like to fight the<br />
next election on your support for an American social model and our support for an<br />
Australian one, we will be very happy to do so.<br />
As Geoff Kitney pointed out today, America is also paying an enormously high price<br />
for widening the dispersion of wage rates.<br />
Those who criticised the White Paper make one fundamental error or at least a<br />
fundamental misjudgement about this Government. A long while ago, we committed<br />
ourselves to finding a place for Australia in the very front rank of nations.<br />
The point of opening up this economy and deregulating it, and lowering tariff walls,<br />
and building an export culture, and best practice, was to make sure that Australia<br />
became a player in the premier league. I mean where the technology is, where the high<br />
value adding is and where the best jobs are.<br />
To opt for any other goal is to opt for a place in the second division where the<br />
second rate jobs are and where the national pride is missing.<br />
Now we are not going to opt for the premier division in the global economy and, at the<br />
same time, opt for the second division in our social goals. We are not going to accept<br />
social decay, human alienation, rising levels of crime, a loss of faith and belief in other<br />
words, an underclass cut off from the rest of the nation.<br />
We did not take the economic path we have to end up with a second rate country. It is<br />
so plainly true you cannot have a first rate economy and a second rate society. </p>
<p>Let me give you just one little example of what I mean. When McKinsey surveyed<br />
firms in regional Australa they found that just 4 per cent among them thought wage<br />
casts were an impediment to growth. Increasing productivity and seeking out new<br />
opportunities were the keys to the way forward.<br />
The White Paper is not proof of success. But it is proof that this Government<br />
continues to believe that words alone are not enough. We will do what on a strenuous<br />
appraisal of the evidence presents itself as necessary.<br />
On that appraisal, it is necessary to sustain economic growth and much in the White<br />
Paper is about the means by which we will do that. We will do it by providing the<br />
means for firms to build, to take advantage of the expanding markets in Australia and<br />
in the region.<br />
It is also necessary to make an effort of unprecedented intensity to lift the long-term<br />
unemployed out of the mire in which they are trapped. That is the heart of it.<br />
The economy in which skills are our greatest resource. Now I won't go into the details<br />
again of how we are going to do that. But let me say that when you examine the<br />
document, it should be apparent that it is a document for these times it brings our<br />
labour market, education and training, and social security programs up to the 1990s<br />
and they will serve us well into the 21 st century.<br />
That's why comparisons with the 1945 White Paper on Employment are largely<br />
inappropriate. They are different documents, informed by different ideas to meet the<br />
imperatives of different times. They have two things in common: the 1945 document<br />
was required to find the way to demobilise a million servicemen and women and the<br />
1994 document has set itself the task of finding ways to remobilise a million<br />
unemployed. That is the first thing they have in common. The second thing is they<br />
were both done by Labor governments.<br />
Growth is the context. Employment, training, support, help, is the heart of it.<br />
I don't think we can stress enough how great the changes have been. How important it<br />
is that we succeed in getting into that front rank. It has been, I suppose, something of<br />
a highwire act. The rewards will be huge not just because it will maintain our<br />
standard of living but improves them for generations. There are also basic quality of<br />
life considerations involved in this.<br />
Yesterday I quoted Chifley's definition of the social safety net the net under the<br />
trapeze artist to catch him when he falls so that he can climb the ladder of opportunity<br />
again. What we are doing with this statement on employment, is providing, on behalf<br />
of the nation, the net and the ladder for the long-term unemployed and for the youth<br />
of Australia.<br />
If it is true that in a civilised society we all depend upon each other, we have to<br />
provide that net and, principally through training and education, the ladder of<br />
opportunity. </p>
