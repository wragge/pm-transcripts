<p>Flood-affected primary producers in more of the hardest hit regions of Queensland can now apply for clean-up and recovery grants.</p>
<p>The grants of up to $25,000 are available to help with the economic impacts of these devastating floods.</p>
<p>Primary producers in targeted areas within the local government areas of Central Highlands, Gold Coast, Logan, Rockhampton, Sunshine Coast, and Western Downs are now able to apply for this assistance under the jointly funded Natural Disaster Relief and Recovery Arrangements.</p>
<p>The eligible activation area for grants in Goondiwindi and Toowoomba has also been extended to ensure similarly affected primary producers can also access assistance.</p>
<p>These grants are already available in the local government areas of Bundaberg, Fraser Coast, Gladstone, Gympie, Lockyer Valley, North Burnett, Scenic Rim and South Burnett in addition to targeted areas within Banana, Goondiwindi, Ipswich, Somerset, Southern Downs and Toowoomba.</p>
<p>The grants assist with the cost of cleaning up and removing debris, replacing damaged equipment and stock, and help ensure business isn't disrupted beyond the next season. This assistance does not compensate for income losses and is not intended to replace insurance.</p>
<p>In addition, concessional loans and grants of up to $650,000 have been extended to these local government areas in recognition of the impact of primary producers in South East Queensland.</p>
<p>The exceptional loan and grant package is now available to eligible primary producers and businesses the LGAs of Banana, Bundaberg, Central Highlands, Fraser Coast, Gladstone, Gold Coast, Goondiwindi, Gympie, Ipswich, Lockyer Valley, Logan, North Burnett, Rockhampton, Scenic Rim, Somerset, South Burnett, Southern Downs, Sunshine Coast, Toowoomba and Western Downs.</p>
<p>The Disaster Income Recovery Subsidy (DIRS) is also being made available to individuals in the Central Highlands, Gold Coast, Logan, Rockhampton, Sunshine Coast and Western Downs local government areas. This assistance provides payments to employees, small business people and farmers who can demonstrate they have experienced a loss of income.</p>
<p>The assistance will ensure that people are able to stay in these areas and will support the longer-term recovery of the devastated local and regional economies.</p>
<p>The subsidies are already being provided to individuals in Banana, Bundaberg, Fraser Coast, Gladstone, Goondiwindi, Gympie, Ipswich, Lockyer Valley, North Burnett, Scenic Rim, Somerset, South Burnett, Southern Downs and Toowoomba local government areas.</p>
