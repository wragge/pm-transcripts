PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW WITH BRIAN WHITE, RADIO 2UE, 2 MARCH<br />
1989 E &amp; 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
WHITE: Good afternoon to you Sir.<br />
PM: Good afternoon Brian.<br />
WHITE: Good to see you.<br />
PM: Good to see you.<br />
WHITE: You're looking well.<br />
PM: I've never felt better.<br />
WHITE: Have you had a chance yet to look at the report from<br />
the Institute of Family Studies?<br />
PM: No I haven't been able to study it yet but I've had<br />
just a couple of notes put in front of me of what has been<br />
said on behalf of the Institute and apparently they go out<br />
of their way to commend the Government for the initiatives<br />
we've taken in the area of the family allowance supplement,<br />
which is not surprising when you think that by the end of<br />
this year we are going to be spending $ 1.5B to deliver on<br />
the pledge. That is there won't be any financial need for a<br />
child to live in poverty. It's an enormous amount of money.<br />
WHITE: Yes that's true but one major point that they make<br />
is that in the ' 77 financial year the family on the average<br />
wage with two children paid 46% less tax than a single<br />
person on that wage. Today that family pays only 26% less<br />
tax.<br />
PM: Well I've got to look at the report in detail I<br />
understand just a very brief note that I saw that the<br />
Treasurer had at question time that the comparisons in<br />
percentage terms have, I think, a fair bit to do with the<br />
timing of the base and the end point as to it being the end<br />
point with the conservative government being taken just<br />
after a tax cut and before so I think that I just<br />
wouldn't be fair to you and I must say to your listeners to<br />
try and make a detailed comment until I've seen it. I'm<br />
more than happy to talk to you at some time later after I've<br />
had a chance to study it. </p>
<p>-2-<br />
WHITE: Yes well perhaps one general thing that I could<br />
raise about what they say though is that their proposals<br />
would cost $ 5.5B in government revenue. They're looking at<br />
the financial year after this one. Is that a feasible<br />
amount for them to be looking at or anybody?<br />
PM: No I don't think that is feasible but what our approach<br />
has been as you know is to adopt the targeted approach to<br />
try and put the money where the greatest need is but in<br />
the work that we'll be doing now Brian as we look at the tax<br />
cuts, there'll be associated decisions about the whole<br />
question of family allowances and what we can do to best<br />
help families and how to target it and I think the consensus<br />
will be after the decisions that we've taken and which will<br />
involve a final delivery on the pledge in regard to child<br />
poverty concerning the family allowance increases, I think<br />
the judgement will be made it's inevitable that what<br />
this Government will have done will far surpass anything<br />
that's been done by any other government in the history of<br />
this country.<br />
WHITE: Will this report from the Institute be part of your<br />
consideration of how tax cuts are to be<br />
PM: Certainly we will obviously we must look at what<br />
they've had to say, yes.<br />
WHITE: I mean one wonders of course whether they haven't<br />
already had an input?<br />
PM: What is being done in this whole area of the<br />
formulation of policy Brian, my colleague Brian Howe, the<br />
Minister, is to undertake consultations with a whole range<br />
of in the social welfare community. I mean for instance<br />
in what we're doing in regard to the aged. We had the<br />
report from Bettina Cass which came out last year. Now what<br />
Brian is doing is having consultations not merely with<br />
pensioners groups but with the superannuation industry, with<br />
going around and talking to and listening to individual<br />
pensioners. I mean everyone who's got a legitimate basis<br />
for input has been listened to.<br />
WHITE: Yes. Of course the general impression I mean the<br />
Sydney Daily Mirror as I understand it, has got this family/<br />
tax institute report all over page one and page three today.<br />
The impression of course that I suppose is going to be<br />
created is that the families of Australia are bleeding?<br />
PM: Let me say as I've said quite obviously before that for<br />
some people there is no doubt that there has been a decline<br />
in standards. The interesting thing if I may say so in<br />
terms of the political situation is that if you look at the<br />
document, the much touted Howard document about which he<br />
calls Future Directions but which is properly entitled<br />
Futile Diversions, is that he actually criticises the<br />
Government. in the Parliament that he actually<br />
criticises the Government for the attempt that we've made to<br />
protect those in the community who really need assistance. </p>
<p>( PM cont) They say that as a result of the change in the<br />
balance of trade there's been a decline in the national<br />
income and we're wrong to try to protect people. I mean<br />
just let me read it, " This has been aggravated by Labor<br />
policies which have attempted to shield certain groups in<br />
the community from the effects of a reduced national<br />
income". I mean there it is starkly in this document what<br />
they say is their central document. They say there has been<br />
this decline in the national income associated with the<br />
external situation, a loss of national income, a loss of<br />
national income and criticising us for attempting as they<br />
say to shield certain groups in the community from the<br />
effects of it. Now we make no apology for the fact that in<br />
a difficult situation where the national income did go down<br />
in that period that we and that meant that some people<br />
were hurt we moved Brian, to try and protect those who<br />
needed help most.<br />
CALLER: Speaking to you as a member of a family who has<br />
gone back for absolute generations of very active Labor<br />
Party members, my dad was a foundation member of a<br />
particular branch of the Labor Party<br />
PM: Which branch was that?<br />
CALLER: Bankstown.<br />
PM: Bankstown, oh yes. That's in Paul's electorate.<br />
CALLER: That's right, he worked very hard for years, we had<br />
all these gentlemen, worked very hard. But the<br />
part that upsets me at the moment, I have four sons ranging<br />
from 33 to 25 who all their life worked hard distributing<br />
pamphlets and working in booths with great pride as part<br />
of a working part of the Labor Party. But at the moment<br />
they're getting quite disillusioned, they now have young<br />
families and trying to get homes and get ahead in life and<br />
it just disappoints me that I'm finding my sons becoming<br />
quite disillusioned with the Labor Party and also in<br />
particular with Paul Keating for whom they've worked so<br />
hard. PM: What's your name by the way.<br />
CALLER: Pat.<br />
PM: Let me say to you as briefly as I can Pat why I think<br />
you and your sons should just think about what this<br />
Government has done and why they should have pride, if I can<br />
put it that way, as I do in the achievements of this<br />
Government and they are achievements in the Labor tradition.<br />
Just let me briefly, if you'd like me to Pat, just go to<br />
some of the things that I regard as important in the Labor<br />
tradition and important in terms of what the real needs of<br />
this country are. First of all you referred to them<br />
working. what this Labor Government has done, and it's not </p>
<p>-4-<br />
PM ( cont): just done it sitting here in Canberra but it's<br />
done it in cooperation with the other part of the Labor<br />
movement, the trade union movement, we've had an accord<br />
which has meant that we've created in this country in the<br />
period we've been in office one and a quarter million new<br />
jobs. I wonder Pat if I could just tell you so that you and<br />
your sons can understand just what an enormous achievement<br />
that is in creating one and a quarter million new jobs in<br />
this country. That's four times, four times, not just one<br />
or two, but four times as fast a rate of job creation as in<br />
the seven years under the conservatives before us. It's<br />
more than twice as fast the rate of job creation as in the<br />
rest of the industrialised world. Now the best thing Pat<br />
that any government can do for your sons and for their<br />
children is to run an economy which is having a rate of job<br />
creation faster than we've had before and much much better,<br />
twice as good as the rest of the world. That's what we've<br />
done. Just let's look at the question of education Pat<br />
which I'm sure for your sons would be regarded as<br />
fundamentally important. We've thought it proper Labor<br />
policy to try and create a society in which it's easier for<br />
the kids of lower to middle income parents to be able to<br />
stay on in the education system. So what we've done is very<br />
substantially increase from $ 23 a week to $ 50 a week the<br />
secondary education allowance. Now what's that meant Pat?<br />
It's meant this, that when we came to office the number of<br />
kids that stayed on in the education system at the end of<br />
that seven years of Tory rule was only 36%. In other words<br />
only a third, just over a third of our kids stayed on in the<br />
education system. Now as a result of the decisions that<br />
we've taken that 36% is up to 58%, to more than half. As a<br />
result of the policies we've got in as we go into the early<br />
part of the 90s we'll have that up to 65%. Let me look at<br />
the other end, the elderly people. Under the Liberals in<br />
their seven years, let me take the four years of John<br />
Howard. The real purchasing power of the pension under<br />
Howard was cut by That was deliberately, they made a<br />
decision through not making the rich and the wealthy who<br />
could afford to pay their taxes, letting them avoid paying<br />
their taxes, it meant that they cut, one of the things they<br />
did was to cut aged pensions. We've brought in a fairer<br />
taxing system which meant that those with the greatest<br />
capacity to pay pay and the aged, instead of getting a cut<br />
in pensions as they did under John Howard, have had an<br />
increase of 7.7% in real purchasing power. So I could go on<br />
Pat but I've just mentioned three things that I thought<br />
would be important to you and I respect what you say about<br />
Labor tradition. Jobs, four times as fast as the<br />
conservatives, twice as fast as the rest of the world,<br />
education for kids and looking after the elderly. That's<br />
all in the Labor tradition and it's all the sort of thing<br />
that I think ordinary decent Australians want.<br />
WHITE: Let's move to another caller. </p>
<p>CALLER: Good afternoon Mr Hawke.<br />
PM: Good afternoon. Who am I talking to?<br />
CALLER: Peter's my name Mr Hawke. I'm an airlines clerk<br />
presently on holidays at the moment. I'm having a nice<br />
relaxing time, I'm reading a book called The Fall of the<br />
Third Republic by William Shirer.<br />
PM: Third Reich isn't it?<br />
CALLER: No, that was one of his other books.<br />
WHITE: This is about France is it or what?<br />
CALLER: This is about the French one.<br />
PM: I wish I had time to read books like that mate.<br />
CALLER: done it for a while. In it it mentions about<br />
one of the reasons with the movement of French capital<br />
overseas before the Second World War, the French didn't<br />
keep their capital at home. I was worrying a little about<br />
how capital in this country, how when we earn interest on<br />
our savings accounts, how we're taxed at the marginal rate<br />
and I was thinking a better inducement for people to save<br />
even small amounts if there was some sort of concessional<br />
rate on interest that you earn. I know a chap at work, he<br />
won't put money in the bank at all. He says the interest,<br />
Paul Keating gets it all. He's paying a marginal rate of<br />
about 40%. Any interest you get you're paying your marginal<br />
rate of tax and even if small sums up to $ 2000 if some sort<br />
of concessional rate of tax was like on the capital gains<br />
tax.<br />

that it's interesting I think that it hasn't been done<br />
anywhere in the world and that's no accident. Could I just<br />
point out to you there are enormous technical difficulties.<br />
You need to look at the question of it's put in terms of<br />
taking account of inflation and only if you're imposing some<br />
tax on real interest for instance. But you've got to look<br />
at both sides. You have a position in terms of the<br />
conduct of business that interest costs are deductible as a<br />
business expense. Are you, on that side, if you're going to<br />
do it on the side that you're talking about, are you going<br />
to say in regard to business that only their real interst<br />
costs will be deductible? The other point that needs to be<br />
taken into account Peter is this, that there is no guarantee<br />
that what you're talking about would in fact add to the<br />
savings of the community because what you must appreciate is<br />
that what is paid as tax is a form there of public saving by<br />
definition. Now what is being suggested is that if you<br />
allowed the tax deduction for interest that that would mean<br />
that it would be at least compensated by private saving. </p>
<p>-6-<br />
PM ( cant): There's no guarantee that that would be the case<br />
and this I think Peter is really probably the most<br />
compelling reason why in fact what I admit to you has some<br />
superficial attractiveness has not in fact been adopted.<br />
WHITE: Can I pick up on one thing that you just said, if I<br />
understood you correctly, that that hasn't been done<br />
anywhere in the world, because the Japanese did not have any<br />
tax on savings interests from the end of the Second World<br />
War until a matter of a few years ago when they introduced a<br />
flat 15 percent and they've recently kicked it up to<br />
PM: Well my understanding and I obviously say this subject<br />
to correction, but my understanding from just a note I saw<br />
the other day Brian was that this general proposal has not<br />
been adopted elsewhere in the world and that's certainly the<br />
information that I have and I think that's accurate.<br />
WHITE: Yes, well<br />
PM: I mean as you can see there are obvious difficulties, I<br />
mean there are technical, administrative and conceptual<br />
difficulties. The last one I mention is really I think the<br />
major one because when tax is paid, that is by definition,<br />
public saving. I mean, it's withdrawn.<br />
WHITE: Yes, well it's public saving as against private<br />
saving. PM: Yes, but you see the assumption, all this is based upon<br />
what is a real problem and Peter is correct and I'm indebted<br />
to him. It's one of the real problems we've got in this and<br />
and in a number of other countries that what we technically<br />
refer to as a savings ratio is low, that is the proportion<br />
of peoples' income that they save rather than the consumers'<br />
low and therefore your investment pool is down and in our<br />
country if you don't save enough there we borrow from<br />
overseas.<br />
WHITE: Well, one of the main things that results from it of<br />
course is that we nowadays have every month in our balance<br />
of payments an interest bill going overseas, with various<br />
other payments going overseas of a like kind, which comes to<br />
about $ 1 billion a month which is matched up against the<br />
fact that the fall in savings in the last 15 or 20 years<br />
also works out at about $ 1 billion a month.<br />
PM: Well it's true, you've got to recogn ise that what is<br />
happening in Australia in terms of a lot of this borrowing<br />
is that the great majority of it, the overwhelming majority<br />
of it, is because we are now as a result of our decisions as<br />
Government, the public sector borrowing requirement is zero<br />
as a result of reducing our deficit and moving into surplus<br />
and we more than compensate for what the States are doing.<br />
So the borrowing now is private sector borrowing. Now these<br />
are decisions by the private sector that they are borrowing </p>
<p>-7-<br />
PM ( cont): and that they will be able to meet that interest<br />
commitment out of the earnings which are generated by the<br />
investment and it's also part of what you must take account<br />
of when you look at this current account question that you<br />
talk about and which I'm sure is partly in Peter's mind, the<br />
gentleman who raised the question. Obviously we can't go on<br />
with the sort of current account deficit figures that we've<br />
been seeing but on the plus side of it what you've got to<br />
remember is this and it's interesting. I've just been<br />
talking to the metal trades employers today and they are<br />
saying, confirming to me that what's happening is that they<br />
are undertaking massive re-equipment of industry. They're<br />
bringing in new capital equipment to make Australian<br />
industry more competitive, both import competitive in this<br />
country and competitive in export terms. Now, OK, so<br />
currently it's a minus but what is happening is that as a<br />
result of so much of this import of capital equipment,<br />
Australian industry and the Australian economy is going to<br />
be a very very much better place in years ahead.<br />
WHITE: We don't have time for very many calls, but let's<br />
have what we can. Good afternoon it's your turn.<br />
CALLER: Good afternoon, good afternoon Prime Minister.<br />
PM: Good afternoon, what's your name please?<br />
CALLER: Brenda.<br />
PM: Good afternoon Brenda.<br />
CALLER: I just wanted to speak to you. I probably identify<br />
with the first lady that you spoke to, Pat.<br />
PM: Yes.<br />
CALLER: I come from a long Labor tradition and a long Labor<br />
background too. Amongst my friends, I probably belong to<br />
that group that has been identified as the gender gap-<br />
PM: Oh yes.<br />
CALLER: to the new election and you'll be happy to<br />
know I'm not interested in talking about tax cuts or<br />
anything to do with money<br />
PM: Yes.<br />
CALLER: a philosophical thing.<br />
PM: Sure.<br />
CALLER: This is more in terms of a statement than a<br />
question. PM: Yes. </p>
<p>-8-<br />
CALLER: As a long term Labor voter the singular thing that<br />
has upset me and my friends most is the concentration<br />
of media ownership in Australia, in particular the print<br />
media. PM: Yes? That's interesting.<br />
WHITE: Now let's see if Prime Minister you'd like to handle<br />
it as quickly as you can so we can get one more caller.<br />
PM: I mean that is interesting. I would, you talk about<br />
the concentration of media ownership. I wonder do you<br />
realise Brenda that no Government in Australian history has<br />
done more than we have to lessen the concentration of media<br />
ownership in the regions of Australia. By that I mean that<br />
up until my Government came in, you could have a situation<br />
where one person, that's my beaut mate Brian White<br />
Brian could in one region, he could own the television<br />
station, the newspapers and the radio stations. He could<br />
totally dominate for a community what they were going to<br />
get. Now what we've done is to break up that cross media<br />
ownership by legislation Brenda, so that for the first time<br />
in Australian history that concentration of media ownership<br />
across the media is not possible. So with respect I think,<br />
that's why I sounded a bit surprised, because no Government<br />
has done more than I have and with my colleagues to break up<br />
the concentration of the media ownership.<br />
WHITE: Now Prime Minister we really don't have enough time<br />
to take any more which means we've only got three calls in.<br />
We'd better do this again if we're going to talk to the<br />
people. PM: Love to Brian.<br />
WHITE: John Howard has said today that it's not the fault<br />
of his statement about Asian immigration that the number of<br />
business migrants has fallen.<br />
PM: Well, rather than just relying on my assessment that he<br />
is the culprit and the hypocrite, could I just quote<br />
Michelle Gratten, The Age, 14 September 1988. " The real<br />
villain in the immigration debate is their own leader, John<br />
Howard" and Steketee in the Sydney Morning Herald " Howard is<br />
exposing his own hypocrisy". Now this is the judgement and<br />
of course John Stone has made it quite clear when he talked<br />
about the debate. He said " we didn't go through this to<br />
leave the policy as it was" he said " what a lot of goats<br />
we'd look wouldn't we". So'he was asked " do you think that<br />
the bottom line is fewer Asians" " that is so"<br />
WHITE: Mr Hawke, thank you.<br />
ends </p>
