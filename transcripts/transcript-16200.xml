    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Rudd Government will host a Small Business Summit on the global financial crisis in Brisbane this Friday.</p>
<p>The forum will allow small business operators and their representatives to discuss with the Prime Minister and Ministers how the global financial crisis is affecting the small business community.</p>
<p>The Government does not hold all knowledge when it comes to dealing with economic turbulence and input from the small business community is essential.</p>
<p>Friday's meeting is being organised in collaboration with the Council of Small Business of Australia and Commerce Queensland.</p>
<p>Treasurer Wayne Swan and the Minister for Superannuation and Corporate Law Senator Nick Sherry will also attend the Summit.</p>
<p>Major bank lenders will be invited to explain their lending policies for small businesses.</p>
<p>Small businesses are usually the first to feel the effects of an economic downturn.</p>
<p>The Government is committed to supporting Australia's small businesses through this financial crisis.</p>
<p>Our Economic Security Strategy will inject $10.4 billion into the Australian economy, stimulating consumer spending to the benefit of Australian small businesses.</p>
<p>The Rudd Government has also moved to guarantee all deposits of Australian banks, building societies and credit unions and Australian subsidiaries of foreign-owned banks.</p>
<p>This guarantee will operate for a period of three years and there is no cap on the deposit amount.</p>
<p>The Government will continue to liaise with both big and small business as we work on a co-operative and sustained strategy to see this crisis through.</p>
