ljj&gt; AUSTRALIA.. J<br />
PRUME NIMSTMER Press Statement No. 537<br />
July 1975<br />
MEDIBANK AGREEMENTS<br />
The Prime Minister today signed the Medibank hospital<br />
agreements under which the Australian Government will meet half<br />
the net operat;. ng costs of the public hospital systems of<br />
Victoria and West-ern Australia.<br />
The agreements will be flown to Melbourne and Perth<br />
tonight for endorsement by the Premier of Victoria, Mr Hamer<br />
and the Premier of Western Australia, Sir Charles Court. The<br />
agreements are due to take effect from Friday 1 August.<br />
The Prime Minister said the Australian Government's<br />
financial commitment to the States' hospital systems this<br />
financial year would be $ 200 million for Victoria and $ 78 million<br />
for Western Australia.<br />
The State governments would meet similar amounts.<br />
The Medibank agreements would ensure that everyone in<br />
those States was entitled to free access to standard ward public<br />
hospital treatment free of means test.<br />
This restored the situation which was introduced by the<br />
Chifley Labor Government in 1947 and allowed to lapse under the<br />
Menzies Government five years later.<br />
Apart from providing sorely needed funds for the public<br />
hospital systems, the Prime Minister said, the Medibank agreements<br />
would also reduce the charges for private and intermediate ward<br />
care in public hospitals.<br />
Private hospital insurance contributions would also be<br />
reduced considerably because the Australian Government benefits<br />
of $ 2 a day, under the old National Health Act, would be<br />
increased by $ 16 a day.<br />
The agreements signed today mean that four States have<br />
now entered the Nedibank hospital plan.<br />
The States of South Australia and Tasmania joined the<br />
plan on July 1. Negotiations are continuing for the entry of the<br />
remaining States of New South Wales and Queensland as soon as<br />
they accept the same arrangements as the other States.<br />
