SPEECH 13Y THE PRIh: MINISTER THE RT. HON. R. G.<br />
MENZIES, AT HOR. SHAM, ON MON{ DY, 28TH NOVEMBEa,<br />
_ 1960<br />
Mr. Chairman, Mr. Rylah, Parliamentary colleagues and ladies<br />
and gentlemen: It must be a considerable time since I : ias on this<br />
platform last. I remember it very well. It was a very good<br />
meeting. As I told some of you this afternoon we had a bit of<br />
good spirited heckling, and some very lively questions. So I<br />
remember the meeting with considerable affection.<br />
But I also remember the place, though not this actual<br />
hall which was thenrmt built, because in its predecessor my late<br />
father spoke many times when he uas the Member for Lowran in the<br />
State Parliament. By that time we lived in Melbourne, and when my<br />
father disappeared, with a great flurry, to go to Horsham it<br />
was almost as if a man had been called before the Judgnent Seat<br />
to caifront his Masters.<br />
Because, usually it had happened that he had cast a<br />
vote that Horsham didn't like, or that Horsham was arguing<br />
about; and so, following his usual attitude, he came up to<br />
argue with Horsham about it. In the long run, af courselost<br />
his seat. ( Laughter) But it is a very good example to follow.<br />
Now, I just want to say something to you tonight, not<br />
all as a matter of history certainly not ancient history.<br />
But when I look back on what we have achieved in this Party I<br />
like to remember a few things, and I would wvish you to rumember<br />
them also. In 1943, speaking about the Federal Parliament, we<br />
who wore then in Opposition, had the most complete thrashing,<br />
politically, at an election that uie have ever had. In fact<br />
somebody rang me up afterwards to ask for a comment, and I<br />
said, " It's very difficult to make a comment when you've been<br />
run over by a traction engine". And that was about where we<br />
were. We looked around I was not then Leader of the<br />
Opposition for a variety of reasons and I was asked by the<br />
survivors, whether I would once more lead them. I said I<br />
would; but there was one great condition to be attached to it<br />
and that was that we . rre to get together in Australia and<br />
become, as far as possible, one body.<br />
At that time, the end of 1943there were no less<br />
than 14 different organisations in Australia all professing,<br />
broadly, the same point of view. But all different.<br />
Fourteen' So from the office of the Leader of the Opposition at<br />
Canberra I . convened a meeting, at C3nberra, of representatives<br />
of all 14. They came, together with other interested persons.<br />
' e had a very spirited session, and we passed a resolution<br />
declaring that we would form one body and that that one body<br />
was to be the Liberal Party of Australia.<br />
Six months later we mot at Albury and at Albury we<br />
had a Constitution, and a Platform and we became fully embodied.<br />
Now that was 1944. In 1946, at the next Federal<br />
election and you will understand it if I speak primarily in </p>
<p>0 2.<br />
those terms-in 194+ 6 we won a fow seats, but we were still<br />
hopelessly outnumbered. In 194+? we had a tremendous victory.<br />
Now I'll say a little neror about that in a moment,<br />
but pausing there, let me tell y~ u this, out of my own long<br />
political axperience.<br />
There are two periods danger in tho lifetime of a<br />
political movement: one is when it appears to be hopelessly<br />
outnumbered, and gives up the gho-st; the other is when it has<br />
boen in office so long that pcoplc say, " Wlperhaps it's<br />
time for a change; we've nothing gainst the Government; we're<br />
doing very well, but perhaps it's t. ime for a change" l.<br />
These are the two periods of danger.<br />
Going back to that first oie, let me remind you that<br />
when we first organised ourselves in-, o one body in the Federal<br />
Parliament, there were 17 in a House of 74+ talking about the<br />
house of Representatives 17. Numoerically a contemptible<br />
Opposition. In point of fact, I wi-l say with all humility,<br />
it was the greatest Opposition that v; as over seen in the<br />
Federal Parliament. Because it had Life, and imagination and<br />
ideas. It knew the business. It nev Parliamentary procedure.<br />
Although it was always dooned to be outnumbered, it<br />
did, in the course of less than five years after being<br />
constructed, achieve the greatest vic-tory that had been seen up<br />
to that time in Federal politics.<br />
Then we were outnumbered of course, still, for old<br />
reasons, in the Senate. We took a Doi. ble Dissolution in 1951,<br />
another election in 154f, another *. election at the end of 1<br />
when there were economic problems of great complexity; and<br />
another one at the end of 1958. Every one of those Electiona<br />
we have won, with fluctuating majorities the last one bythe<br />
biggest majority we have ever had in the Federal Parliament.<br />
I think it is worthwhile recalling those matters.<br />
Of course I occasionally meet those candid friends who are the<br />
curse of humanity you know what I moan who say, " Well, old<br />
man, yes, congratulations! You've done vory well to win these<br />
Elections. But of course you know you had the advantage of<br />
having so-and-so on the other side". It's always somebody else<br />
who has done it; it's never ourselves.<br />
All I want to say is that I have no reason to doubt<br />
that ' v~ hovor had led the Opposition in the Federal Parliament,<br />
we would have won the elections; and we would have won them<br />
because we have constantly maintained a positive approacil, and<br />
a positive contribution to the solving of the Nation's problems.<br />
There are people, of course, who sit on the side<br />
lines, who always know all the answers they know nothing<br />
about these problems for the most part; they have never had<br />
to handle them. 11e have.<br />
The result has been, or rather the history has been,<br />
looking internally, looking at our Australian problems,<br />
domestically, that in the course of these eleven years, we<br />
have had the most complex variety of economic problems. ' Ve<br />
have had booms; we have had recessions; we have had an<br />
,_; normous expansion in the price of wool and dramatic falls in<br />
the price of wool. Jo have had some little unemployment<br />
not very much at any time. We have had tremendous over-full<br />
employment, and an unsatisfied demand for labor. Our overseas<br />
balances have fluctuated quite violently at times; and they<br />
have fluctuated for the most elementary reasons. </p>
<p>0 3.<br />
4hen at the time of the Korean Jar the boom in wool<br />
came on, it reached absurd and embarrassing heights. That<br />
wasn't the fault of anybody in Australia. That was the fault<br />
of some extraordinary, incompetent mass wool buying elsewhere<br />
in the world. But the fact was that our overseas balances rose to<br />
an enormous height; inflation grew at a tremendous speed in<br />
Australia, and we had to do some pretty unpopular things. But<br />
we did them, and those who attacked theon when they were done<br />
and I could understand them attacking them; they were very<br />
disagreeable subsequently came to realise that they had been<br />
right, that they had produced the right results.<br />
Do you know that after the famous Budget of 1952<br />
when we were supposed to be absolutely certain to be destroyed,<br />
the Gallup Poll recorded us, I think, as having a percentage<br />
of about 37 the all-time low. And the vreaker brethen would<br />
come around and say, " It's hopeless; we're g6neol The people<br />
are against us". I used to have to say, " Look by the time the<br />
next election comes around, we will win you see' This is<br />
going to work out well". It did uork out well, and we won the<br />
next election; and the one after that by a bigger majority, and<br />
so on down the line.<br />
I have an infinite belief in the people. I think<br />
that the people of Australia are sensible, honest people. If<br />
I didn't believe that, aill politics would be a mere masquerade,<br />
a worthless occupation. You can only carry this occupation on<br />
if you believe in the honesty, and decency and fundamental<br />
commonsenso of your own people. That belief has been<br />
vindicated, I venture to say, over these years so far as our<br />
party and our representatives, and our policies have been<br />
concerned. Somebody said, of late, having regard to certain<br />
changes that we have made, somebody coined a phrase you know<br />
it's a great thing to coin a phrase and the phrase nou is<br />
that this is a " stop and go" Government. Jfell, of course,<br />
they have always said that about us. The extraordinary<br />
thing is that Australia hasn't stopped. It has gone steadily,<br />
steadily growing until oven the Leader of the Opposition has to<br />
admit that of course Australia is a prosperous country. Of<br />
course it is! So apparently these alleged fluctuations of<br />
policy haven't brought the country to a standstill. But let us<br />
see what they mean. I wrant you to understand this kind of<br />
thing. Our policy has been constant, just as the strategy<br />
of a General may be constant, his overall strategic<br />
conception. ut just as he changes his tactics according to<br />
the dispositions of his enemy, and the circumstances of the<br />
time, so we, without altering our policies, of course adjust<br />
our detailed application to the circumstances of the moment.<br />
Jo wrould be incompetent fools if we didn't.<br />
I gave an illustration one night about the Central<br />
Bank, the Reserve Bank of Australia, the Bank which sits in the<br />
middle of the entire credit structure of Australia, and upon<br />
the capacity and honesty of which people in Australia depend<br />
to a very largo extent.<br />
Jhat does a Central Bank do anywhere in the iorld?<br />
Does it say, once a year, " This is our policy for the ycr<br />
this is what we are going to do for the year, and we will leave<br />
it at that, and whatever happens we won't change ftr 12 months".<br />
ihy the country would be in a state of chaos if a Central Bank<br />
did that. </p>
<p>It is the duty of a Central Bank to say, " What is ourpolicy?<br />
Our broad policy is to maintain, as far as we can,<br />
stability, economic stability in the community. ~ Je don't want<br />
too much credit in the i rong direction, or too little credit<br />
in the direction in which it ought to 3o. Ie want to have a<br />
reasonable degree of liquidity in the Trading Banks so that<br />
they maintain an oven process of business'..<br />
Therefore a Central Bank will sell securities this<br />
month and buy then next month. It will release money to the<br />
trading banks out of their special reserves this month, and<br />
call it up in two months. Those things must occur in the<br />
course of the conduct of a Reserve Bank. They put out, they<br />
take in. Every Reserve Bank in the world has to do it. If it<br />
didn't do it, that would be a calamity to the country in which<br />
it was operating. The weather isn't the same every day, or every week.<br />
Circumstances change. You may have a sudden rise in the price<br />
of wool or a sudden collapse. Export sales of some other<br />
commodity may also be affected because of drought or some other<br />
unpredictable reason. And in two or three months the whole<br />
of your circumstances in relation to your overseas balances<br />
can be affected. Therefore there must be a watchful eye.<br />
And just as the Reserve Bank is not to be afraid to<br />
do its duty, so we are not to be afraid to change our course<br />
to meet the new circumstances. The objective will rumain the<br />
same. But as the Chancellor of the iEchequer in the United<br />
Kingdom said the other day, " It is necessary very frequently,<br />
while maintaining your course to the port of destination, to<br />
make many movements of the wheel, this way or that, according<br />
to the jind and the weather."<br />
That is what you are entitled to expect. If this<br />
country had suffered from people who, in a wooden-headed<br />
fashion, ' ihen the Budget had been pronounced said, " Jell now<br />
that's the whole of our financial activity for the year, and<br />
whatever comes or goes for the next 12 months, we stand by<br />
that document and we do nothing to meet the new circumstances"<br />
if the country had been cursed by such stupidity, then I<br />
would be very sorry for it and it wouldn't be the country that<br />
it is now. That is a broad aspect of this matter, ladies and<br />
gentlemen, that I do want to emphasise to you.<br />
My colleague, the Treasurer, has been making some<br />
magnificent statements on this matter. They won't satisfy a<br />
lot of these people -ho are described as " economists" in the<br />
newspapers. Because, you know, it's just one of the bad luck<br />
things about political life we have economists in the<br />
Government service; and the newspapers have economists which<br />
are their own people. But the irony of it is, that although<br />
the Government goes to the greatest possible pains to<br />
assemble the ablest possible men, it turns out that Governumnt<br />
economists are always wrong, and that newspaper economists are<br />
always right. This is one of the strange laws of life. I h-. ve<br />
sometimes thought that it . night not be a bad idea to take them<br />
all over, or make a swap. ( Laughter) We would be in a<br />
position of powerful advantage then.<br />
Ui, cÃ± u juaun asiac, zne whole essence of what<br />
we do from time to time as a Liberal administration is to aim<br />
at stability, at development, at reconciling the highest<br />
possible degree of national growth with the highest maximum<br />
attainable degree of stability of the currency, to avoid<br />
unemploynent, to preserve our international credit, to<br />
preserve our international reserves and, so help us, to<br />
finance the development of Australia.<br />
Now those are groat tasks. I can honestly claim<br />
that we have, to a substantial extent, performed them; and<br />
are proposing to continue to perform them.<br />
Now my opponents, your opponents, the Labour Party,<br />
what their economic policy is I have yet to discover and so<br />
have you. In terms of the economy of Australia they have not<br />
condescended to tell us.<br />
But one thing they have let drop which is very<br />
important, and which I want you all to remember. Every time<br />
they have a chance they complain about foreign capital coming<br />
into Australia. It was their annual exercise, and I suppose<br />
will continue to beo, to complain loudly and bitterly in<br />
Parliament about profits earned by foreign companies operating<br />
in Australia. If that complaint means anything, then I can only<br />
assume that they don't want foreign capital in Australia; but<br />
if it comes in, it must be, of course decent enough to make<br />
no profits. Because their great complaint is that those<br />
companies want to send some of their profits out of the<br />
country. It is quite true that they spend most of theo in<br />
Australia in developing their enterprise, but the very fact<br />
that they want to send a few millions out of the country by<br />
way of dividends, excites horror in the apostles of Socialism.<br />
Now, what are the facts? This is one of the vital<br />
facts of recent years.<br />
Jo are a country of enormous import demand. Our<br />
standard of living is so conspicuously high in the world that<br />
our capacity to buy things from overseas is enormous. By and<br />
large you can reckon, year by year, that Australia wants to<br />
spend Å 1,000 million, Å 1,100 million, Å 1,200 million every<br />
year on imports. These are enormous sums of money; and in<br />
order to bring in imports we must, of course, pay for them.<br />
I hope nobody suffers from the illusion that paying<br />
for goods brought from overseas is a mere matter of signing a<br />
cheque and trusting to providence. It isn't. If we haven't<br />
got the capacity to find Å 1,000 million overseas we can't pay<br />
Å 1,000 million overseas. It is as simple as that.<br />
As, year by yoer, you are earning money overseas,<br />
and you are spending money overseas, you always need to have in<br />
reserve, to pay for things you are buying, a few hundred<br />
million pounds. The broad principle of this thing is quite simple:<br />
aibntlee rntoa tipoanya, l absroolavde, n cyfo rf orth eA uthstirnaglsia thdaept eknwde s guotp ont heurs e. being<br />
Now we have a high demand for imports, very high.<br />
But our export income fluctuates, and principally witk h Ã± C<br />
price of the products of the land. In the last years,<br />
ladies and gentlemen, we have been kept ih-sly solvent </p>
<p>S </p>
<p>0 6.<br />
overseas, not simply because of our export income, but<br />
because we have attracted fron overseas scores of nillions of<br />
pounds of private investment. And of course money that cones<br />
in like that is equivalent, for this purpose, to export<br />
income. I was able to stand on a platform about three years<br />
ago and say that for some time, under our administration, and<br />
with the confidence that we have been able to create overseas<br />
in hard-headed circles, that we were receiving into Australia,<br />
on private investment account, Å 100 million each year, Å 100<br />
million. Tremendous! All over Australia. And, as has been<br />
pointed out, in particular in the State of Victoria you will<br />
se vast enterprises that have been established, and which<br />
maintain enormous employment with money that cane in from the<br />
United States and the United Kingdom rather more from the<br />
United Kingdom than from the United States you wvill be<br />
interested to know.<br />
There it is. To cut it off would at once present a<br />
problem on our overseas reserves, and our overseas balances,<br />
of the most acute kind. But we have goneonn, whatever they<br />
may say, or some people may say here.<br />
The people in the world who have noncy to invest<br />
the hard-headed people of Great Britain and the United States,<br />
they look at us in Australia, they say, " There is a stable<br />
country; that country appears to have the right ideas; that<br />
country is developing; that is a cuuntry in which we are not<br />
at danger of being nationalised or taken over. put our<br />
money there". Last year it wasn't Å 100 million it was Å 200<br />
million. Å 200 million sent into this country for investment<br />
in our present and our future, in our fertility and in our<br />
character. If there is one thing that we stand for in this<br />
movement it is character, it is the honesty of administration.<br />
These things count with the rest of the world,<br />
I can remember that when we caeo in, in 1949, the<br />
end of 1949, I don't think the reputation of Australia had<br />
improved nuch abroad over the previous few years. The then<br />
Governnment had had a rather untidy wrangle with the United<br />
States of Aeorica, and had said, " Wo don't want you to<br />
establish a base on Manus Island". The then Minister for<br />
External Affairs had made a great point at all international<br />
conferences of attacking, or criticising, or in the homely<br />
phrase, " cocking a snoop" at the United States, and at the<br />
United Kingdon because this seemed to be a rather clever thing<br />
for us to do. Our reputation today with the United States, and<br />
with the United Kingdon, is, I believe, higher than it has ever<br />
been before. And that is tremendously important to us.<br />
When we cane back into office here was Australia,<br />
remote in the world; there was China, Communist, aggressive;<br />
China that had become Cormunist with all the pressure going on<br />
in South East Asia, tremendous pressure it is on at this<br />
moment in Vietnam; it is on at this moment in Laos.<br />
We can sit hero and talk and I can stand here and<br />
speak, but at this very moment there are all sorts of things<br />
going on in these countries every one of them related to<br />
Communist pressure, to the Communist attack, to the Con-. iunist<br />
ambition to control, if it can, every country that sits<br />
between us and the free world, </p>
<p>These are treiuendously important affairs. And we<br />
said, " Well, we must do something about it. It's no use just<br />
having pious speeches about wanting to be friendly wJith the<br />
United States, or friendly with the United Kingdom. T'* hat are<br />
we to do, placed as we are down in this corner of the Pacific?<br />
What can we do that is practical and positive?".<br />
After all, you know, the two reat achievements in<br />
foreign policy have been that we did get a three-cornered<br />
treaty with the United States of America and Now Zealand in<br />
what is called the ANZUS Pact; and we also were one of the<br />
proroters of the South-East Asian Treaty which embraces in one<br />
defensive organisation not only Pakistan, and Thailand and the<br />
Philippines, and Australia and New Zealand, but also the United<br />
States of America, Great Britain and France.<br />
These two arc rorarkable achievements, though I<br />
describe them in those terns myself. They have revolutionised<br />
the position of Australia, In the old days before the war<br />
America didn't make engagements of this kind. There was an<br />
attitude, " No we make no cormitmnts; we don't get tied up<br />
with obligations outside our country". It is one of the great<br />
things that since the War, America has engaged herself with<br />
other countries. She has behaved, I venture to say,<br />
magnificently. Here, in our corner of the world, she stands as our<br />
ally and associate in those two treaties, an achievement which<br />
would have been thought, and I dare say would have boon, in<br />
fact, impossible 20 years ago.<br />
So far as Great Britain is concerned, Sir, I hope<br />
that it won't be necessary for : e to justify our relations<br />
with Great Britain. I am perfectly certain that at Whitehall,<br />
whatever Party may be in Office at Whitehall, we are rogarded<br />
as true, trusted and respected friends. And indeed we ought<br />
to be, because we are of the same blood. ( Applause)<br />
Wo had an illustration I think I ought to say a<br />
few words to you direct it's boon discussed a good deal of<br />
the kind of problem that arises for Australia at the United<br />
Nations at this last Assembly, where I had the great privilege<br />
of listening to Mr. Khrushchev, and watching his g; rnastic<br />
exercises, even with the shoo. And it was a very interesting<br />
experience. He cane across, I think it's always difficult to<br />
know what a dictator is thinking because democratic leaders<br />
like myself occasionally have to expose to the people what<br />
they are thinking and be judged by them; but a dictator, he<br />
hasn't to worry about that, so you don't know whether he is<br />
saying one thing and thinking another but I rather think<br />
that he went across with this in his mind: that he would like<br />
to weaken, and perhaps ultinately, destroy, the United Nations.<br />
You may say, " Well why should he do that?". Well<br />
the answer is, I think, clear enough. The Soviet Union first<br />
of all set out to render the Security Council which is the<br />
only executive body in the United Nations, to render it futile,<br />
by exercising the Veto. Every time a decision of any moment<br />
occurred they would say, " JWe vote And then, under the<br />
rules of the United Nations, that was the end of it. They<br />
might be out-numberod by 11 to 1, but it doesn't mattoer they<br />
arc one of the pernanont members and when they say the<br />
answer is " No".<br />
And so they have rendered this, a rather unsatisfactory<br />
I al-ost said a rather futile body. </p>
<p>And then they switch into the General Assebly.<br />
And the General Assoebly this is just a comnittoc meeting<br />
compared to the General asscmbly. Ninetyeight nations, I<br />
think, or there nay be 99 at the moment, but call it 100 just<br />
in round figures, each one of then with half a dozen doleo: ates<br />
and half a dozen advisers and you can imagine it's an amy<br />
of people, in a huge theatre.<br />
Australia, by the luck of the draw, sat in the back<br />
seat, looking down the slope. It's not a bad position to be<br />
in because you could see quite a lot. When I wanted to speak<br />
I had to get up and do a route narch down the aisle. It<br />
seemed to ne to be about 200 yards; I daresay it wasn't any<br />
nore than about 80 or 90 yards. But it is an enormous place.<br />
In the result, of course, no debates occur at all.<br />
Speeches are nado, which is a rather different matter. Long<br />
speeches. Two hours appears to be the rule. The day before I<br />
arrived Fidel Castro had spoken for hours the first<br />
minutes on his hotel accommodation and the next 2 hours and a<br />
half on the story of his life. ( Laughter) Now you wouldn't<br />
read about it. It's trneendous. I know that because I read<br />
the translation the day I arrived.<br />
But this is the sort of thing that goes on.<br />
Khrushchev was out to do two things in that Assembly:<br />
one was to attack the Secrotary-General, who has a difficult<br />
enough task in all conscience. But he thought that if he<br />
could attack him and bring hin down then he would weaken the<br />
whole executive position of the United Nations. The other<br />
object, of course, was to beguile, or threaten, or actually<br />
frighten, new nations, of whom there are plenty.<br />
About fifteen new nations from Africa arrived this<br />
year. They are inexperienced in self-government. They haven't<br />
yet, for the iost part, found their feet. They uay, perhaps,<br />
be a little more disturbed by threats than we are.<br />
And he said to hiniself, " This is it. I will make<br />
these people feel that I am somebody to be afraid of; and<br />
that the Suviet Union is a power to be obeyed".<br />
, oll, I an happy to say I think he failed to<br />
achieve that result because he didn't understand that now<br />
nations, like old ones, have a dignity of their own. These<br />
people don't cone to self-governnont, they don't come to<br />
independence, they don't celebrate their Independence Day,<br />
without feeling proud that they are now a free nation. And as<br />
he doesn't understand free nations, never having set one free,<br />
having only conquered then, he doesn't understand the dignity<br />
of freedom. That is why I thought that he failed on that side<br />
of his tactics. But one way or another, I think that he will not<br />
rest until ho has nade the ultimate attempt to persuade people<br />
to do sonothing that will weaken the United Nations and that<br />
will then draw into his own orbit as nany nations as possible.<br />
And this is a grin thing for the world.<br />
The vorld stands outside global war today because the<br />
free world possesses the power to destroy the ajgrussor just as<br />
indeed the aggressor has the power to destroy nuch of what they<br />
have thensolves. Here is the deadlock of power, of toe. riblo<br />
pjwuutr. But he fooeels that if ho could wean away, persuade, or </p>
<p>9.<br />
threaton, or infiltrate to got another ton, fifteen, twenty,<br />
twentyfive, nations into his own orbit, then he could develop<br />
what he would represent as such a moral body of opinion in the<br />
world, as would weaken the will of the people of the United<br />
States and of Great Britain, and of Australia.<br />
Because thero are plenty of people willing to<br />
weaken our will if they can. And this is the thing of which<br />
we ust beware. We nust retain the initiative; we nust retain<br />
the moral initiative; in all matters that affect the rorld's<br />
peace we nust be united and positive inwhatevor , we are<br />
proposing should be done.<br />
Above all things we should know where our friends<br />
are. What a silly lot of nonsense it is to say to somebody<br />
like myself, " You should prefe-to get the vote of a neutral<br />
country, when you nove something in the United Nations, to the<br />
votes of Groat Britain, the United States and France" who are<br />
the three most powerful allies we have in the world.<br />
Did you ever hear such nonsense? If everybody in<br />
Australia got into his mind that that was ny kind of " surrenderism"<br />
to coin a word that that was ny understanding of<br />
what the great interests of Australia needed, then I would<br />
expect to be swept out. But before I was swept out I would<br />
know that the Liberal movement would have swept no out and got<br />
another loader, another S-pokesnan.<br />
Je, Liberals', we stand for these things. io stand<br />
for friendship witt our great friends overseas. Wo know that<br />
it is only by.,. hving sonm security for our Nation based upon<br />
magnificent-active friendships around the world that we can<br />
hope to set ourselves to the great tasks that we have not to<br />
put everybody under government control, but to put every<br />
individual citizen, so far as we can, into a position of<br />
developing his own life.<br />
Liberalisn, based upon individual human freedom,<br />
individual hunan dignity these are the things that stand in<br />
our lives; these are the things that have no existence in<br />
Communist countries, or among Communists in Australia itself,<br />
or anong their dupes.<br />
Australia is a friend of the United States. We are<br />
of course, intimate, family people with the United Kingdom.<br />
But when we , go to an international conference we have our own<br />
mind. We are capable, around the corner, of having<br />
discussions with our friends.<br />
When I was in the United States on this recent<br />
visit I was honourod by being askod by the President to go up<br />
to Washington to confer with him at the 1White House with Mr.<br />
Harold MaCmillan. I thought this no insult to Australia, that<br />
the three of us should be sitting there, in private, discussing<br />
these urgent current matters. But does anybody suppose we just<br />
sat down and somebody beat time and we all said the same thing<br />
not a bit. I think that for the first hour they probably<br />
heartily disagreed with what I was saying: and I disagreed<br />
with one or two other things that wore said.<br />
We thrashed then out. W4 are grown-up people. We<br />
have minds of our own, and duties of our own, and conceptions<br />
of ourown. But in the end, we agreed.<br />
But, in the United Nations Assembly, where you had<br />
the Soviet Union, and the satellite countries, as they are<br />
pleased to call them, or as we are you know countries like<br />
Rumania and Czechoslovakia and Poland and so on there they<br />
are. </p>
<p>When Khrushchev decided that sormething ought to be<br />
applauded, ho always startcd applauding up here like a fellow<br />
in a boxing ring you know always started up thero; they<br />
all looked around from wherever they sat in this great hall<br />
and there they were.<br />
If on the other hand he was going to thump the<br />
table, like that, he raised his fist high, or his shoo as the<br />
case Day be, and they all looked around, nodded, and then<br />
( L. ughter) Of course he had shoes and he could hit the table<br />
with then; I didn't inspect the satellite countries closely<br />
enough to know whether they had any. But at any rate they<br />
thumped the table.<br />
Now you see the difference between the complete<br />
subjugation of these people not a man there from Poland, or<br />
Czechoslovakia, or as the case n:' ay be, not a nan there who<br />
would dare to have a mind of his ovm, who would dare to ar gue<br />
with the head of the Soviet Union.<br />
These are the things that we have to m.~ aintain. We<br />
won't always agree with each other. I an happy to say that we<br />
can have discussions in Cabinet and discussions in the Party<br />
Room that reveal a wide variety of ideas. In fact I have<br />
never seen an idea put forward yet that I hadn't first heard<br />
in the Cabinet Room, or in the Party Room. \ Ie are not such<br />
inexperienced people as all that, and we thrash thoe out.<br />
A1nd when we thrash then out we arrive at a conclusion which is<br />
part of the substance and spirit of what Liberalism stands for.<br />
When we do, we go forward with it, as you would<br />
expect us to not apologetically, but with some0 courage and<br />
determination, and belief, in what the result will be.<br />
Now, as I said to you at the beginning, it was a<br />
dangerous time back in 1944-, 14 because we were a remnant,<br />
and remnants are inclined to be disposed of at a rumnant sale..<br />
But we weren't a remnant in that sense, and we arrived.<br />
tWo are now getting towards the end of our 11th year.<br />
The very prosperity of Australia detaches th~ e minds ofa lot of<br />
people from political affairs: they think that they can<br />
safely leave these things alone. This is a point, therofore,<br />
of danger for any Government, and any movement.<br />
I am addressing one or two mootins for the prime<br />
purpose of saying to our own people, " You believe in the<br />
things we stand for; you have your pride in what is going~ on<br />
in Australia; you are maintaining your interest in the<br />
political affairs of Australia; you are not going to allow<br />
the citadel to be captured by inadvertence, or idleness. Go<br />
out and persuade as many thousands of people, Liberals, as you<br />
can find, that that is their duty also".<br />
I haven't the slightest doubt in ny mind that with<br />
awareness of our political issues Liberalismn is destined to<br />
serve this country in Governrient for many years to come.<br />
( Applause) </p>
