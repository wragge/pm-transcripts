EMDARGO: 3.00PM TUESDAY 30 APRIL<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, MR. E. G. WHITLAM, TO AN<br />
ELECTION CAIMPAIGN MEETING AT SPRINGVALE TOWN HALL, MELBOURNE,<br />
VICTORIA, TUESDAY 30 APRIL 1974<br />
Labor is a national party. The Labor Government is a<br />
truly national government. We are the only party whose policies<br />
are directed, not to sectional interests, not to privileged<br />
minorities, but to the welfare of all Australians. For this<br />
reason it was natural and inevitable that we would be the<br />
first party to recognise that the true interests of the majority<br />
of our people would best be served by an attack on the growing<br />
problems of our cities. That was the central and winning theme<br />
of our campaign in 1972. It is the basis of all our major programs<br />
and policies in 1974.<br />
To say this is not to suggesL that we are concerned only<br />
with the cities. Of course we are not. It is merely to recognise<br />
that the greiL majority of our people live in the cities, and that<br />
p; li. ies for cities are therefore policies for peoile. All our<br />
plans fcr a richer and fuller life for pee all our hopes<br />
and ambitions for their future, for the quality of their lives and<br />
their children's lives are bound up with our plans for the cities.<br />
I ask you to keep in mind what this word " cities" implies in the<br />
context of our policies it means better-schools, better transport,<br />
better housing, better health services, better working conditions,<br />
a more beautiful and orderly environment. It means an end to urban<br />
sprawl, an end to squalor, an end to inefficient and dilapidated<br />
public transport, an end to much of the ugliness that has characterised<br />
tlhe working and living conditions of our people for too long.<br />
As in so many areas of political life, our initiatives<br />
f. or the cities have set the pace for all political parties.<br />
For what did " the cities" to the Lib-ral and Country Parties<br />
in 1972? For the Country Party they meant hostile c; icentrations<br />
of power; " city" was a dirty word, and still is a dirty word.<br />
For the Liberals, the cities meant one of two scquare miles of<br />
office blocks and financia; l institutions, the centres of corporate<br />
wealth and power. They had plenty of policies for the insurance<br />
companies and stockbrokers who made up the Liberal concept of the<br />
city. But for the millions of Australians who lived in tho suburbs,<br />
especial]. y in the fast growing outer suburbs, who yearned for a better<br />
deal in education, housing, transport, sewerage, health services and<br />
so many other things, the Liberals had nothing to offer at all.<br />
How gratifying it is that the Opposition is now putting forward<br />
policies for the cities how gratifying, yet how cynical! / 2 </p>
<p>2.<br />
How empty and belated their promises are now.<br />
The men who ignored the cities for 23 years, who left them<br />
to the tender mercies of land sharks, property speculators<br />
and developers, who tolerated generations of urban sprawl,<br />
ugliness and inefficiency, who did nothing about the great<br />
and growing problems of high land prices, run-down transport,<br />
unsewered suburbs and inadequate health care these men now<br />
come before you with their so-called policies for the cities,<br />
policies flung together three or four weeks before a national<br />
election which they have forced on the people by a gross<br />
violation of constitutional principles. Of course our Iopponents<br />
have " policies" for the cities. They dare not run away from<br />
this issue any longer. Their policies, insofar as they amount<br />
to anything at all, amount to no more than a continuation of<br />
the programs my Government has initiated and pursued during<br />
the past 17 months. I merely ask: whom should you trust<br />
to carry out these policies? The men who spurned them for so<br />
long, and have indeed done much to frustrate them during my<br />
Government's period of office; or the men who worked for<br />
years to create and propound these policies, and who see them<br />
as a basic and central ingredient of our whole political<br />
philosophy? In my policy speech in 1972 1 said that " a national<br />
government which cuts itself off from responsibility for the<br />
nation' s cities is cutting itself off from the nation's real life".<br />
In its direct involvement in cities the Australian Government has<br />
entered the mainstream of Australian life. We want to remould,<br />
modernise and revitalise our cities; and ~ to do that we want to<br />
remould, modernise and revitalise the relations between the three<br />
levels of government national, local and State. The national<br />
government must accept at least as much responsibility for cities<br />
and centres as the national governments of comparable countries<br />
already do. At last we have a national government which is doing<br />
just that. We also have a national c:'-7ernment which is determined<br />
to see that local government the area of government closest to<br />
the people and closest to their needs should have the opportunity<br />
and the financial resources to carry out their responsibilities.<br />
for the benefit of the cities, for the peop ' le, of Australia.<br />
Our referendums to be held with the election on 18 May will<br />
enable us to make grants direct to local government bodies<br />
who request-them. We want to make local government. a genuaine<br />
partner in the federal system. This proposal has t1' rof<br />
the overwhelming majority of local government as~.. n<br />
and councils throughout Australia.<br />
Let me recall some of the g~ reat things we undertook to<br />
do in attacking the problems of the cities and improving the lives<br />
of their people. From the outset we set about this task with<br />
speed, with vigour and with determination. </p>
<p>I 3.<br />
I promised in 1972 to establish a Department of Urban<br />
palnadn sR egfioor naela chD evceiltyo pmaenndt rteog ioann alaynsd e, t o raedsveiasrec h thaen d ncatoi-oonradlinate<br />
government on grants for urban purposes. The Department was<br />
established as soon as we came to power. It is functioning<br />
with great effect under the leadership of Tom Uren.<br />
I promised that we would request the Grants Commission<br />
to recommend the amount of national government assistance<br />
required to remove the inequality of servicing developing<br />
regions. We have carried out that promise. One of the first<br />
acts of the new Parliiut. len. t enpow. ered the Grants Commission to<br />
make grants to local government for this purpose i: 1 the same<br />
way that it has traditionally recommnended grants needed to<br />
remove inequalities between the States.<br />
I promised that one of 1he functions of the Department of<br />
Urban and Regional Development would be to conserve the National<br />
Estate, our national and man-made heritage. We have established<br />
a committee of inquiry on the National Estate and have received<br />
its report. Our first Budget provided an initial $ 2.5 million<br />
to be applied to the preservation of the national estate.<br />
I promised that we would make grants to the State<br />
Ilousing Commissions for welfare housing purposes conditional<br />
on the funds being spent on housing communities which<br />
provide a safe, pleasant, modern and civilised environment.<br />
Our Budget raised the allocation for welfare housing by<br />
26 per cent. The national government has assumed virtually<br />
full responsibility for this important field.<br />
I undertook through the establishment of a<br />
Schools Commission that the national government would accept<br />
direct responsibility for schools, whose welfare bears<br />
directly on the quality of life in the cities. I pointed<br />
out that the previous Government's system of per capita<br />
grants to non-government -chools -ilone did nothing to help<br />
tl-e stabli u: L ent r-f new Catholic schools in gro': ing areas<br />
such as this a-. i no incUlti\' es for the reduction of<br />
class sizes or for the training of teachers in existing<br />
Catholic schools. It left existing Government schools<br />
as deprived and overburdened as ever. Through the Schools<br />
Commission the national government has accepted a continuing,<br />
comprehensive commitment to all schools on the basis of needs<br />
and priorities. We have almost doubled national government<br />
expenditure on education.<br />
I saiO w determined that every child in Australia<br />
; oucli have tie same opportunity then enjoyed only by children<br />
in Canberra to a full year's pre-school education from qualified<br />
staff in proper buildings. The Budget allocated $ 10 million<br />
foi ani early start for the redemption of this promise and we<br />
are providing a further $ 8 million to help in the construction<br />
and operation of child-care centres. </p>
<p>I promised a vigorous attack on the backlog of sewerage<br />
in our major cities. $ 30 million was provided in the 1973/ 74<br />
* Budget to make a start on overcoming this backlog. Discussions<br />
are under way'with the States to develop a continuing longterm<br />
program beginning in 1974/ 75.<br />
I promised special help for the new developing regions<br />
of our cities. As a result, $ 8 million was provided in the<br />
1973/ 74 Budget to provide urgent assistance to local government<br />
bodies in the western sectors of Melbourne and Sydney.<br />
I pledged an all-out drive to create new cities and<br />
regional growth centres. The Australian Government has offered<br />
financial assistance to the States for a program of development<br />
of twelve new growth centres in sub-metropolitan and regional<br />
locations. An amount of $ 33 million was * provided in the 1973/ 74<br />
Budget. We have made a bold and encouraging start with the*<br />
new city of Albury-Wodonga. This is an outstanding example<br />
of co-operation between the Victorian, New South Wales and<br />
Australian Governments.<br />
I promised a vigorous campaign to upgrade the standards<br />
of urban public transport. We are providing $ 32 million this<br />
year to the State Governments for urban public transport<br />
improvements. We are proposing to provide another $ 41 million<br />
to complete projects comnmencing this -vear. Half the money<br />
has been allocated for the acquisition of new railway rolling<br />
stock, buses and trains. Additional new railway tracks will<br />
be built in Melbourne to relieve congestion and increase<br />
the capacity for express services operating to outer suburban<br />
areas. Fundamental to our plans for better cities is'an attack<br />
on the crippling problem of land prices. The cost of land is<br />
the greatest single component in the cost of a home and the<br />
greatest impediment to a fair deal for the average homebuyer.<br />
We pledged to set up Land Commissions with the help of the<br />
States to buy up large tracts of residenthial land in new<br />
suburbs and towns and sell them at fair prices as fullyserviced<br />
building blocks. The anti-Labor States have stalled<br />
on this proposal. They have dithered and blocked our planswhile<br />
the cost of buildingx land has contiruee to soar. Who<br />
are the interests who benefit front this obstruction? They<br />
are the land speculators, the profiteers and developers who<br />
have grown fat on the savings of young Australian families.<br />
Their interests, and their interests alone, have been served<br />
by the dilatory and obstructive tactics of the anti-Labor<br />
States. Remember that the States have all the powers they need<br />
to control the soaring price of land. The anti-Labor States<br />
refuse to use them. And all the time land is becoming<br />
increasingly expensive further beyond the reach of the average<br />
wage earner. In Melbourne the average cost of a block of<br />
land is $ 13,000; in Sydney it is $ 18,000. In fAelbourne the<br />
rate of inflation in the cost of land more than doubled in<br />
1973. It increased by 46 per cent, while average earnings </p>
<p>Sby 12 per cent. The cost of land in Melbourne now<br />
'. esents 60 per cent of the cost of a home. It takes the<br />
. ivalent of 22 months' wages to buy an average block of<br />
in Melbourne and 32 months' wages in Sydney. The Li bera. L<br />
Governments have done absolutely nothing to check this<br />
jndalous profiteering in the price of land. They have<br />
, eat powers at their disposal. They have done nothing.<br />
My Government established its Land Commission program<br />
to attack this urgent problem. We are determined to provide<br />
land at prices people can afford. We will not tolerate the<br />
increasingly common spectacle of thousands of young homeseekers<br />
being turned away from land auctions in Melbourne and Sydney<br />
while prices. soar beyond their reach. In the first part<br />
of our program, we offered the Victorian Government $ 30 million<br />
for a land acquisition program the highest amount for any<br />
State. New South Wales was offered $ 28 million, the Queensland<br />
Government $ 6 million, the Western Australian Government $ 6 million<br />
and the Tasmanian Government $ 1 million. Only in South Australia<br />
has the Government taken appropriate action to attack land<br />
price.-s, and their legislative steps have done much to<br />
stabilise the price of land. They have also sjigI1d an agreement<br />
with ry Government they are the first State to do so<br />
for the establishment of a Land Commission. What a contrast<br />
with the anti-Labor States! In New South Wales where<br />
land prices are at catastrophic levels the Askin Government<br />
has refused to accept our offer. In Brisbane where land<br />
price inflation is running at 100 per cent a year, the highest<br />
in Australia the Queensland Government has also rejected our<br />
offer. In Western Australia a hostile Upper House prevented<br />
the recent Labor Government from accepting our Land Commission<br />
proposal. And under Hamer nothing happens. There could be<br />
no better example of State Government obsuruction at the expense<br />
of the people in Australia's cities.<br />
Despite all the Liberal talk a. out the cities, their<br />
sudden discovery of the plight of city dwellers, their lastminute<br />
conversion to the cause of the cities, their record<br />
on land prices shows where their real interests lie.<br />
Here is an area where the Liberal/ Country Party State<br />
Governments have great and undoubted powers. They have<br />
refused to use them. We will be judged by our record and<br />
performance. Let the homeseekers and young families of<br />
Australia judge the Liberals by theirs.<br />
In the light of their miserable and obstructive record,<br />
. iho can take their last-minute promises seriously? They are<br />
vague and unspecified promises. Over all their promises<br />
for the cities, for education, health and welfare hangs<br />
the equally vague and unspecified commitment to cut. back on<br />
Gov-enment spending. The people of Aus-alia can be sure of<br />
one thing: if the Liberals were to cut back on spending, they<br />
would make their cuts in the only area where econo.: ies w.:. uld<br />
be meaningful that is, in the essential and histric<br />
programs my Government has undertaken to improve our citiz:;<br />
and make them worthy places for ustralian people. </p>
