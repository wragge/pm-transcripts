    <content><![CDATA[<p>Mr Dennis Richardson AO has advised me that he wishes to tender his resignation as Secretary of the Department of Defence with effect from 12 May 2017.</p>
<p>Mr Richardson has had a long and distinguished career and has made a significant contribution to Australia’s national security and foreign policy over 48 years of public service. He was appointed as Secretary of Defence in 2012 having served previously as the Secretary of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (2010-2012), Australian Ambassador to the United States of America (2005-10) and the Director-General of Security (1996-2005). He previously worked in the Departments of Immigration and Prime Minister and Cabinet, and served as principal adviser to Prime Minister Hawke from 1990 to 1991.</p>
<p>In this near half century of service, Mr Richardson has served twelve Prime Ministers with consistent professionalism. His commitment to public service, his strategic insight, his candour and integrity have made him a trusted adviser to Governments from both sides of Australian politics.<br />
On behalf of the Government and the Australian people, I thank Mr Richardson for his leadership and service and I wish him and his wife, Betty, all the very best for the future.</p>
<p>Brendan Sargeant, Associate Secretary, will be Acting Secretary pending the appointment of Mr Richardson’s successor.</p>
