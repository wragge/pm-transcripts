CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY<br />
EMBARGO: 12.30pm AEST<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR IMEDIA FRIDAY, 14 JANUARY 1983<br />
ADDRESS TO YOUNG LIBERAL NATIONAL CONVENTION, ADELAIDE<br />
The Young Liberal National Convention in mid-January is one of my most<br />
regular and important engagements, and I am delighted to be here<br />
today, back in harness for the first time. 1983 is obviously<br />
going to be a critical year for Australia. It will be a year<br />
of difficulties, but also of challenges and opportunities.<br />
It has never been more important to have the right priorities,<br />
the right policies, the right directions. As a Liberal Government<br />
our overriding obligation is to address the issues of economic<br />
management firmly and effectively, without losing sight of our<br />
wider objectives.<br />
We all know that in today's situation there are no short term<br />
solutions, no instant palliatives or quick fix answers.<br />
We need medium to long term policies, consistently applied.<br />
People are rightly concerned about the difficulties Australia<br />
is facing, along with other countries. But I find it enormously<br />
encouraging that most people are expressing a determination that<br />
issues should be addressed constructively, looking to the interests<br />
of all Australians. A national mood of realism is imperative.<br />
For provided we are realistic, provided we are willing to make<br />
the best use of skills and resources, I have total confidence<br />
Australia can look to the future with optimism.<br />
We also need to keep today's difficulties in perspective. While<br />
we do not have the levels of economic growth we would like,<br />
our gross national product is continuing to plateau at or near<br />
its highest level ever. This contrasts starkly with the<br />
catastrophic collapses of the 1930s. At the present time, our<br />
national stock of houses, household goods, factories, commercial<br />
buildings, galleries, roads, schools and hospitals has never<br />
been greater and is still grow~ ing. We live at a much higher<br />
standard than previous generations.<br />
I want to talk first about where Australia now stands,<br />
especially in the'light of the world recession. Secondly,<br />
I want to examine the importance and continuing role of the major<br />
policy initiatives put in place during 1982. Finally, I want<br />
to look ahead to our objectives and priorities for this year.<br />
There is no doubt that Australia's immediate situation and<br />
prospects are greatly affected by the world recession. We are<br />
affected by a general world problem, which is having an impact<br />
on every country. There are some things we can do ourselves ./ 2 </p>
<p>1, 1 V -2-<br />
to lessen the impact of recession but because trade is our<br />
lifeblood, the recession was bound to hit us hard. The recession<br />
has meant less demand for -our products, lower<br />
prices for our commodities, and more competition in the markets<br />
where we sell. This means less incentive to invest, and a<br />
tighter squeeze on the profitability of Australian producers.<br />
The world recession is-proving far deeper and far more prolonged<br />
than most people would have thought possible, and there are<br />
few signs of sustained recovery.<br />
It is estimated that real GNP growth for OECD countries as a<br />
whole in 1982 was minus and in the previous year, the value<br />
of world trade actually fell, for the first time in over<br />
twenty years. The average level of unemployment in 1983 for the<br />
OECD area is forecast at 35 million people, a rate of<br />
compared to about 8 million people or 3.6% 10 years earlier. it<br />
is worth reflecting that if someone had argued ten years ago<br />
that OECD unemployment would rise to 35 million, no one would have<br />
believed it. People would have said they could manage their<br />
economies better. We now face the unhappy question of how high<br />
unemployment must go before major countries will face the reality<br />
of trade problems and thus take decisions to get trado moving<br />
again and unemployment down and restore economic growth.<br />
The world desperately needs concerted international action<br />
to help us break out of the vicious circle where negative<br />
influences feed upon each other. The failure of the November GATT<br />
Ministerial Meeting to take effective steps was a serious<br />
disapppointment to all who seek a revival of world trade and a<br />
fall in unemployment. Australia had put forward some<br />
proposals designed to encourage world trade by halting the<br />
drift to increasing protectionism overseas.<br />
In principle, our proposals were widely accepted and logically<br />
unassailable, they would have helped renew confidence, but there<br />
was insufficient strength of purpose to grasp the opportunity.<br />
The Secretary-General of the OECD has summed up the seriousness<br />
of the situation by saying " in the light of events over the last<br />
few months, it is my considered opinion that ( the) danger of<br />
a chain reaction of beggar-thy-neighbour policies, with<br />
potentially disastrous consequences, is now greater than at any<br />
time since the Second World War".<br />
The absurdity and the danger of what is now happening is<br />
obvious from a few examples of existing trade barriers. One<br />
EEC country, France, has erected barriers against imports of<br />
Japanese video-recorders by requiring that all recorders<br />
come through one . inland customs post totally ill-equipped to handle<br />
the volume of trade, while in Ireland the furniture industry<br />
was protected by making it compulsory to provide instructions<br />
for ' build-yourself' furniture in Gaelic.<br />
International action to revitalise the world economy would help Australia<br />
greatly, we will contribute in any way we can to achieve<br />
that objective, for continuing world recession ine~ vitably<br />
means continuing difficulties for our economy. The impact<br />
of the recession on Australia was worsened by 3 </p>
<p>-3-<br />
excessive wage settlements over the last 12 to 18 months. These<br />
wage rises came at the worst possible time, both because wages<br />
overseas were rising at a much slower rate and because<br />
production and profits were weakening here. over the 12 months<br />
to the September quarter 1982 profits in Australia fell by 13%,<br />
to their lowest level as a proportion of non-farm GDP since<br />
at least 1959-60.<br />
The wage rises have inevitably damaged our international<br />
competitiveness. They have worsened inflation and unemployment.<br />
This is not an occasion for political point-scorin'g the issues<br />
facing Australia today are far too serious for that. But I<br />
do say that those who pushed for higher wages and shorter<br />
working hours must carry a good part of the responsibility for<br />
the difficulties we are now experiencing.<br />
The third major factor affecting Australia is one of the worst droughts<br />
we have ever had. Most farm prices were down anyway, but<br />
the drought is likely to cut the wheat crop almost by half,<br />
and more than 110,000 of farms, carrying nearly 100 million<br />
sheep and 14 million head of cattle are affected. The drought<br />
is having effects far beyond the rural sector and is adding to the<br />
severity of the present recession.<br />
Throughout last year, both in our statements and in a series<br />
of consistent and far-reaching actions, the Government showed<br />
it was aware of the economic difficulties that were looming.<br />
In a statement to the Parliament last March dealing with the<br />
seriousness of the situation, I pointed to the inevitable<br />
impact on Australia of the slackness in world demand and the<br />
high cost of funds. I referred to the dangers of increasing<br />
protectionism in other countries during<br />
world recession. I highlighted the damage caused by excessive<br />
wage rises and demands for shorter hours, and I spoke of<br />
the importance of matching expectations with reality.<br />
The concerns expressed in that speech were consistently reflected<br />
in policy initiatives throughout 1982. The Government pursued<br />
the twin objectives of helping people cope with the recession,<br />
while working to establish the circumstances in which<br />
private enterprise will be able to build up the Australian<br />
economy and take advantage of opportunities as they arise.<br />
In March we introduced a far-sighted housing package at a time<br />
of high interest rates, real difficulty in bridging the deposit<br />
gap, and growing problems in the housing industry. This-package<br />
helped some 450,000 families buying their first home. We later<br />
widened the housing interest rebate to include almost all home<br />
loans. Commonwealth welfare housing expenditure has been greatly<br />
increased and will build nearly 4,500 new dwellings in<br />
1982-83, more than half as many again as last year. In all,<br />
our decisions in 1982 have led to additional funds totalling<br />
some $ 1.2 billion in a full year being diverted into housing<br />
rebates and loans. Many of these measures will have a continuing<br />
effect. Now that interest rates are starting to fall, these / 14 </p>
<p>4<br />
housing measures will have a greater impact on construction in<br />
particular as the confidence of house buyers returns and<br />
they are prepared to take out new loans.<br />
Since last July, the Government has announced a number of<br />
measures designed to help Australian industry. In particular,<br />
depreciation provisions have been improved considerably so as<br />
to ease cost pressures and assist reinvestment, especially in<br />
new technology. An increase in the retention allowance will also<br />
encourage reinvestment. Industry will also benefit from the<br />
launching of the " Buy Australian" campaign, and more help for<br />
small business through the Commonwealth Development Bank. And<br />
industry will be given a boost by the increase of about<br />
$ 580 million expenditure on capital works and other capital<br />
purposes this financial year, by the $ 2.5 billion which is to be<br />
spent on the ABRD program over the next six years, and the tax<br />
cuts of $ 1.5 billion, effective from November, which will<br />
generate increased spending in the economy.<br />
The Government has been particularly concerned with the needs of<br />
young people and we have helped them considerably this financial<br />
year. Not only have the maximum tertiary and secondary allowances<br />
been increased, but to help train young people to get jobs<br />
and to contribute more effectively to building up Australia,<br />
the Government has expanded employment and training programs,<br />
increased work experience and apprenticeship subsidies and<br />
the school-to-work transition program, and provided a special<br />
three year capital program of $ 60 million for TAFE. In a<br />
wider context, the Government has done a great deal to improve<br />
the position of those people in need during this time of<br />
difficulty. In addition to the measures I have mentioned already, low income<br />
families will be helped by the family income supplement,<br />
which will take effect from May this year, and from reductions<br />
in charges made for pharmaceuticals. Pensioners have benefited<br />
not only from increased pensions, but also from increases in<br />
supplementary assistance for those pensioners paying rent, from<br />
changes to the income test on pensions, and from a $ 250 tax<br />
rebate for low income pensioners. The unemployed have been helped<br />
by significant increases in unemployment benefits, and there has<br />
been an increase of 65% in direct funding for welfare housing.<br />
I hope Young Liberals will get out and ensure the community is<br />
aware of these effective and innovative actions the Government<br />
has taken to help those in need. We need to be on constant<br />
lookout for areas-of need in our community and to continue to<br />
provide assistance wherever practicable.<br />
One of our most important objectives during 1982 was to<br />
establish a climate for wage restraint and this is being<br />
achieved in very large measure. Acceptance of the need for<br />
restraint was strengthened by the Remuneration Tribunal's<br />
decision on Parliamentarians' salaries, by the Academic Salaries<br />
Tribunal's decision, and by a number of moderate determinations<br />
for both Commonwealth and State public servants. </p>
<p>All this gave impetus to the idea of a wage pause. The agreement<br />
which all governments reached at the December Premiers' Conference<br />
to introduce a wages pause in the public sector, and to press<br />
strongly for its extension into the private sector, provides<br />
Australia with an opportunity which we must use to the fullest<br />
advantage. The benefits of the pause are two-fold. First, substantial<br />
Government funds can be diverted from wages to employmentrelated<br />
programs. In the case of the Commonwealth, over<br />
$ 300 million are being diverted over a twelve month period.<br />
The Government has already announced that $ 100 million of that<br />
money will be committed to welfare housing construction, an<br />
activity which is labour intensive and which has a high<br />
Australian content. I am also pleased to announce that at<br />
yesterday's Cabinet meeting the Government decided that a<br />
further $ 100 million will be used to assist the young unemployed<br />
by offering them an opportunity to work on worthwhile community<br />
projects rather than being unemployed. $ 100 million is also to<br />
be spent to help the older unemployed and others disadvantaged<br />
in the labour market. Typical projects funded by these programs<br />
could include national parks and wildlife activities,<br />
conservation and environment projects, national heritage, forestry<br />
and local improvement projects. They would be run by local<br />
councils, State Authorities and voluntary organisations. These<br />
are constructive projects which meet very real needs, and I am<br />
sure this convention will be particularly pleased with the<br />
measures we are t Lking to tackle youth unemployment.<br />
Secondly, and more importantly, benefits from the pause will<br />
flow through to the private sector. in the short term it may not<br />
do much more than help some employers keep employees they would<br />
otherwise have retrenched. But in the longer term it will help<br />
restore profitability and competitiveness more quickly,<br />
enabling Australian firms to sell into other markets -and offer<br />
more jobs. The pause is above all an attack on one of the major<br />
causes of the unemployment problem.<br />
The recognition by all eight governments that a wage pause<br />
was needed is a significant fact, and it has sent a<br />
significant signal to the private sector, to the union movement<br />
and to the various wage tribunals, because all governments,<br />
whatever their political colour, are saying that wage rises<br />
have caused problems and that strong action is needed to counter,<br />
these problems.<br />
I have referred to our actions in 1982 because it is important<br />
to realise that the Government has been responding to the<br />
situation in a comprehensive and consistent manner. As and<br />
when we need to build upon those measures, or take fresh<br />
initiatives, we will do so. Australia needs stable, long<br />
termf policies, consistently applied. The direction of our<br />
economic policy is right and we shall maintain that direction. 6 </p>
<p>-6-<br />
We shall continue to support private enterprise, and a more<br />
competitive Australian industry. We will maintain the fight<br />
against inflation. And as we can afford it, we will continue<br />
to assist people and families.<br />
There would be no point in trying to forecast specific actions,<br />
but I want to point to some issues the Government will need<br />
to address in 1983.<br />
The first issue is wages. I have spoken of the opportunities<br />
provided by the wage pause. The pause is not just something for<br />
Governments. It is something which affects all Australians.<br />
It is an example of what Australians can do if they are not only<br />
realistic, but if they work together to help each other.<br />
In the case of the wages pause, employees of the Commonwealth<br />
will be foregoing $ 300 million in wage increases to help other<br />
Australians out of work.<br />
Because of the importance of the wage pause to everyone, I am<br />
extremely pleased with the support it has received,<br />
not just from the Premiers, but from the community as a whole.<br />
It is disappointing that some State Premiers would only support<br />
a six-month pause in the first instance, but they will be<br />
reviewing their position in mid-year, and I am optimistic that<br />
they will agree to extend the pause for the full twelve-month<br />
period. The Arbitration Commission has granted a six-month pause, and the<br />
Government is delighted that the Commission accepted the<br />
arguments which we put to it. These arguments wilibe equally<br />
strong in six months time, when the Commission reviews the<br />
pause, and I very much hope the Commission will extend the pause<br />
for a further six months. In the current climate Australia's<br />
situation can only be made worse by further wage rises. It would<br />
be a mistake, though, to see the wages pause as a solution in<br />
itself to our economic problems. It is not.<br />
What it does do is provide us with an opportunity. An opportunity<br />
to improve the competitive position of our economy, to restore<br />
profitability to our businesses and industries, to get out<br />
into the world and sell Australian products, and to create nore jobs.<br />
Whether we take that opportunity will depend on attitudes as<br />
we approach the end of the pause. If we just put but our hands at the<br />
end of the pause and demand they be filled no matter what the<br />
consequences then. that opportunity will be lost and the benefits<br />
of the pause will be lost. Australia will be submerged in<br />
mediocrity. If we rise to meet the challenges and opportunities offered<br />
by the pause, and if we are realistic about our position when the<br />
pause ends, then we can use the great strengths Australia has to<br />
regenerate this nation. / 7 </p>
<p>The second issue I want to mention, which is directly related to<br />
the end of the wages pause, is the method of fixing wages. It<br />
is one of the most important issues Australians need to address<br />
and it will be of critical importance to industry.<br />
During the year the Government with employers and employees,<br />
will be examining the wage fixing system to find the most<br />
effective way of determining wage levels to meet our social<br />
and economic objectives. No matter what the outcome, it is<br />
imperative that we have a stable and predictable system.<br />
A third issue I want to mention is the calls for higher<br />
levels of protection. It is inevitable that during times of high<br />
unemployment and falling demand some people will call for<br />
increased protection. But we have to be clear-eyed about the<br />
consequences of higher protection.<br />
The first point I would make is that demands for significantly<br />
higher protection must be seen against the background of the<br />
support over the last year the Government has given to industry.<br />
I have already referred to the improved depreciation provisions<br />
and a number of other initiatives which have helped industry.<br />
The Minister for Industry and Commerce recently announced steps<br />
to speed up and strengthen our procedures against dumping. He<br />
has also announced steps to improve the temporary assistance<br />
mechanism. And industry will benefit enormously from the<br />
wage pause because it will help reduce cost increases.<br />
The 10% devaluation of the Australian dollar against the<br />
trade weighted basket over the last 18 months 13.5% against<br />
the US dollar has also helped domestic industries by raising<br />
the landed cost of imports and by lowering the prices of our<br />
exports in foreign markets it has helped our exporting industries<br />
in difficult overseas markets.<br />
The Government recognises that protection will remain necessary<br />
in Australia, and in July last year we decided against a programme<br />
of further general reductions in protection, but significantly<br />
higher protection would do very real harm to the Australian<br />
economy. The most serious consequence of too much protection is<br />
that it has counterproductive effects and damages industries<br />
which are strong, and export oriented.<br />
It is imperative that we do not take decisions which would make<br />
it even more difficult to sell Australian goods on the world<br />
market. Higher levels of protection tend to give the<br />
greatest support, and therefore the greatest advantage, to<br />
non-exporting industries, and this is not Jinthe long-term interests<br />
of Australia.<br />
Too much protection means higher costs, so it is harmful to our<br />
growing often export oriented industries. Last year, for example,<br />
in responding to the application for temporary assistance for the<br />
steel industry, the Government was acutely conscious that too<br />
large an increase in protection for Australian steel would have ./ 8 </p>
<p>meant higher costs for many downstream industries, including<br />
manufacturing industries, which use steel in their products.<br />
This would have made it harder for these industries to sell<br />
their products in Australia as well as overseas. Indeed, some of<br />
these industries might well have asked for more protection for<br />
themselves because there had been more protection up the line.<br />
And because higher protection means that consumers have to pay<br />
more, they have le's s to spend on other things.<br />
Higher protection may protect jobs inthose industries protected,<br />
but it would mean less employment in those industries not<br />
protected. It would mean a concentration of economic resources<br />
in industries which are less efficient. With too much<br />
protection, we would build an economic wall around Australia which<br />
would not only be harder for imports to scale; it would also<br />
be harder for exporters to get out because in many cases their<br />
costs had been increased by a higher price for their inputs.<br />
Denying access to our markets would invite retaliatory action<br />
by other countries, shutting Australia out of markets around the<br />
world. That way lies disaster. Protectionist measures<br />
overseas at our expense could cost us tens of thousands of<br />
jobs. Would we want to run the risk of that happening to the<br />
Pilbara region of Western Australia or in coal mining towns<br />
like Blackwater and Collinsville in Queensland, or<br />
Muswellbrook and Singleton in NSW all of which depend almost<br />
entirely on export markets?<br />
We need to remember that approaching three quarters of a million<br />
Australian jobs depend directly on exports. Even more jobs<br />
depend on exports indirectly. By preventing efficient<br />
industries from prospering as they should, too much protection<br />
would deny us the general improvements in living standards<br />
which we would all like to see and in the process would<br />
undermine our ability to provide secure and sustainable<br />
jobs in the longer term. And if there was substantially<br />
increased protection, what guarantee would there be that the<br />
short-term advantage conferred on those industries would not be<br />
whittled away by price and wage increases, just as the living<br />
standards of people who have become unemployed have been whittled<br />
away by the wage increases of others?<br />
The fourth issue I want to mention is the importance of introducing<br />
new technology. It is essential that Australian industry<br />
adopts new technology if it is to become more competitive.<br />
our industries cannot afford to be frightened of new technology<br />
or fall behind in its development because without it we will<br />
not be able to compete with our neighbours and our opportunities<br />
for economic growth and, in the longer run, more jobs will be lost.<br />
At present the Government encourages the introduction of new<br />
technology through depreciation allowances, the Australian<br />
Industrial Research and Development Scheme, the CSIRO, the<br />
Rural Research Programme and the National Energy Research<br />
Development and Demonstration Programme. Total Government<br />
spending on all forms of research and development as a proportion<br />
of GDP is the fifth highest in the O. E. C. D. but our level of<br />
research and development by the private sector is noticeably low. </p>
<p>-9-<br />
our broad policy for encouraging new technology is not<br />
industry specific: rather, we have allowed industries to make<br />
their own decisions and to determine the direction of expenditure<br />
on new technology. I have discussed with the Minister for<br />
Industry and Commerce whether or not this policy should be<br />
maintained or whether specific policies for specific industries<br />
and technologies should be introduced. He will be considering<br />
this question early this year. we will also need to examine<br />
whether Australia spends enough on research and development<br />
and -the application of new technology and to see if there is more<br />
we can do.<br />
The fifth question that clearly needs examining is the<br />
response of Government to changing levels of investment. We<br />
have been saying in past years that public investment should be<br />
held back to make room for rapidly rising private investment.<br />
But the situation has now changed, and private investment is<br />
falling under the impact of the recession. When private<br />
investment is down it is appropriate for governments to examine<br />
the levels of-their own investment. We have already moved in<br />
this direction, expecially through increased capital works,<br />
including the new airport programmes and the A. B. R. D. Governments<br />
can do a great deal, operating in partnership, to build the basic<br />
infrastructure for the future and assist private enterprise when<br />
opportunities occur.<br />
In this context I am pleased to announce that at yesterday's<br />
Cabinet meeting the Government decided that the Alice Springs<br />
to Darwin railway will be completed by 1988 Australia's<br />
bicentonnial year. The rail link will be of tremendous economic,<br />
social and defence significance to Australia and will be the<br />
largest current railway development project in the world. It<br />
will cost a total of $ 545 million. During construction the railway<br />
will provide employment both directly and indirectly for over<br />
1250 people. one of our election promises in 1980 was to complete<br />
this project by 1990: the project will in fact be completed two<br />
years earlier.<br />
The sixth matter which needs to be addressed is water resources.<br />
We are now in the middle of what could turn out to be the<br />
worst drought this century. The drought has highlighted in the<br />
starkest way the problem of adequate water supplies. Australia<br />
is often described as the world's driest continent and water<br />
has always been of critical concern. Millions of people in<br />
cities and on the land in NSW, Victoria and South Australia,<br />
depend on the Murray Basin for their livelihood. Much has been<br />
done already to improve the quality of River Murray water but<br />
in the present circumstances we will need to see what else<br />
ought to be done.-Also our dams are dangerously low and major<br />
cities are facing severe water restrictions. </p>
<p>In 1981 the Commonwealth set up a forward looking investigative<br />
study to develop a perspective on Australia's total water resource<br />
needs through to the year 2000. The States are co-operating<br />
with us in this exercise. But there is an urgent need for us to<br />
consider whether our current programmes and policies are<br />
adequate and whether the scale of our thinking has kept pace<br />
with that of cnur nredecessors when the Snowy Mountains Scheme<br />
was developed and carried through. We need to consider an<br />
imaginative approach which recognises that water will always<br />
be scarce in Australia and that it should be conserved wherever<br />
possible. 1983 will be a year of immense challenge to Australia, but will<br />
also be a year of opportunities. We must learn from what has<br />
happened, and make sure we emerge from the recession stronger,<br />
more competent and more competitive than we have ever been.<br />
We need a total effort from every part of the Australian<br />
community. The challenge for Government is to guide Australia<br />
through the recession, with a clear perception of our long<br />
term objectives. Coping with the recession realistically is<br />
not a matter of throwing up our hands in despair and saying<br />
there is nothing we can do to help ourselves.<br />
We cannot just rely on economic recovery in the United States<br />
to regenerate Australia. Rather, we need two things. We need<br />
the right policies to enable our businesses and industries to<br />
go out and get a larger share of markets, to become more competitive<br />
and to be more profitable. Without the right policies, economic<br />
recovery in America won't help us at all. But in addition to<br />
the right policies we also need the energy, innovation and<br />
determination to get out and get a bigger share of the action<br />
even if world economic recovery doesn't come for a very long time.<br />
I know Australians can and will do just that. This is what<br />
faith in Australia is all about. It is what our commitment<br />
to freedom and private enterprise means, it is the path which<br />
realism dictates for 1983 and it will make our nation stronger<br />
and more self-reliant than ever.<br />
Socially, we must continue to build on Australia's excellent<br />
record as a genuinely liberal society. A society which<br />
rejects uniformity and which has what someone recently described<br />
as a " zest for differences" which generate innovation, ideas and<br />
progress. The differences between us as individuals, the variety<br />
that different and distinctive cultures and attitudes give to<br />
Australia, are an essential part of the community's driving<br />
force. Tolerance of differences and their encouragement also<br />
engenders in individuals respect for their own community and<br />
social system. By creating a liberal, dynamic society we can<br />
make Australia really great and set an example to the rest<br />
of the world. </p>
