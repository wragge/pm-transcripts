    <content><![CDATA[<p>Bud Tingwell was in every sense an Australian legend.</p>
<p>Older generations knew him through Homicide. A newer generation knew him as the battlers' friend in The Castle.</p>
<p>Since his first film in 1946, he was a constant presence on our cinema and television screens, and behind the scenes as a director and producer for series like Cop Shop, The Sullivans and Prisoner.</p>
<p>His was an extraordinary life  -  from service in World War II as a RAAF pilot to his acting and directorial career in Hollywood, London and back home in Australia.</p>
<p>Bud was the consummate professional on set, and was renowned for his generosity towards young actors and film students.</p>
<p>In 1999, he was appointed a Member of the Order of Australia for his contribution to the performing arts as an actor, director, producer, and to the community.</p>
<p>He was so much part of the Australian character, as it has been shaped, and as it will evolve in the future. All Australians are sad to see his passing.</p>
