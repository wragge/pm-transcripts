PRESS STATEMENT NO. 403<br />
9 December 1974<br />
IMPORT POLICY FOR 1975<br />
The Prime Minister, Mr Whitlam, announced today<br />
a program of action for 1975 aimed at reducing current pressures<br />
from import competition on employment in certain industries.<br />
The Prime Minister said this action followed a<br />
recent review of import trends undertaken by himself, the Deputy<br />
Prime Minister, Dr Cairns, and the Minister for Manufacturing<br />
Industry, Mr Enderby. The Prime Minister said it was clear that high levels<br />
of imports were contributing to problems of unemployment in those<br />
industries sensitive to import competition. It was important that<br />
manufacturers and importers who were planning their activities for<br />
1975 be aware of the Government's concern with recent trends,<br />
and the Government's intentions in relation to imports during<br />
1975. The Prime Minister went on to say that the program<br />
of action decided upon would be based on a selective review<br />
of those industries with demonstrable import problems. The<br />
review would be undertaken through the machinery and procedures<br />
provided under the Industries Assistance Commission Act. A program<br />
of references would be sent to the Temporary Assistance<br />
Authority and the Textiles Authority during the next month. This<br />
would ensure that reports would be received and action taken<br />
by February. The Government was determined to use to the full<br />
the system and the machinery it had created to deal with such<br />
problems. The integrity of the system would be maintained.<br />
The Prime Minister said that, consistent with the<br />
provisions establishing the Temporary Assistance Authority, new<br />
appointments would be made to the Temporary Assistance Authority<br />
to enable it to undertake enquiries promptly. In addition, the<br />
Department of Manufacturing Industry had been instructed to<br />
provide full assistance to manufacturers to help them prepare<br />
cases for consideration for references to the Temporary Assistance<br />
Authority. / 2 </p>
<p>2,'<br />
This programme of action involves an examination of the major<br />
industries being affected by a high level of imports. The<br />
Government will initiate appropriate action on these industries<br />
within a few weeks, with full regard to the short term need to<br />
maintain employmen~ t in these industries. The Prime Minister<br />
stressed that the more prompt and specific an application for a<br />
reference was, the more quickly appropriate action to safeguard<br />
employment could be taken.<br />
The Prime Minister pointed out that should the need for urgent<br />
action emerge from these inquiries, goods ordered overseas but not<br />
cleared for home consumption at the date of announcement of any<br />
action would lie subject to the terms oi. -the action. Importers should<br />
therefore exercise cauition in placing orders overseas and in<br />
entering into financial commitments on such orders as special<br />
consideration may not be given to outstanding commitments should<br />
action be taken by the Government0<br />
Motor Vehicles<br />
As part of-the new policy for the motor vehicles industry<br />
announced by the Government last month, the tariff on<br />
passenger motor vehicles was immediately raised as shaort term<br />
action, N~ ith the object of limiting imports of completely built*<br />
up vehicles to a level no higher than 20 per cent of the<br />
1-ocal market. * o / 3 </p>
<p>Textiles. Clothina and Footwear<br />
Effective action against imports had already been taken in<br />
relation to a significant part of the textiles~ clothing and<br />
footwear industries and further action was now being taken as<br />
part of the program of action.<br />
Import licensing controls ha~ d been applied to footwear in<br />
October, following an inquiry and recommendations by the Temporary<br />
Assistance Authority.<br />
In clothing, the Government had in recent months negotiated<br />
voluntary restraints on exports of certain knitwear and woven<br />
apparel from Hong Kong, India, People's Republic of China and the<br />
Republic of Korea. Import licensing controls had been applied<br />
to imports of the knitwear goods concerned from Taiwan. These<br />
arrangements generally applied to imports to 30 June 1975.<br />
A review of the arrangements would be made early in 1975 to<br />
determine as soon as possible the arrangements to apply from<br />
1 July 1975.<br />
Tariff quota arrangements h1ad been announced on 3 December for<br />
imports of acrylic apparel yarns, knitted man-made fibre fabrics<br />
and towels. This action followed an inquiry and repoort by the<br />
Textiles Authority within the TAG.<br />
As a result of decisions taken today on IAC reports before the<br />
Government, tariff quota arrangements were also to be applied<br />
immediately to imports of<br />
0 polyamide and polyester yarns<br />
o woven man-made fibre fabrics<br />
o foundation garments<br />
Details of these decisions would be announced separately by<br />
the Minister for Manufacturing Industry.<br />
There were currently references with the Textiles Authority<br />
on the balance of the apparel industry for re.-. ort by the end of<br />
December and January 1975 and further references were being<br />
considered in relation to cotton fabrics and piece goods. 00 ./ 4 </p>
<p>4,<br />
A reference had been sent to the Textiles Authority in the<br />
last few days on the carpet industry and the report on that<br />
industry was expected about the end of January 1975.<br />
in addition, over $ 1.5 million have been approved as grants to a<br />
number of textile firms affected by import competition. These<br />
grants were made under the Special Assistance for Non-Metropolitan<br />
Areas ( SANMA) Scheme. Further applications from textile firms for<br />
assistance under this scheme were being given urgent attention.<br />
Domestic Appliances and Electronics<br />
The Prime Minister said that the Government had been informed<br />
tha~ t the domestic appliance industry was in the final stages of<br />
preparing a documented case on the problems of import competition<br />
which it was facing as the basis for an application for additional<br />
short term assi~ tance. Submission of this application was expected<br />
in the next few days. The application would be given urgent<br />
consideration by Departments.<br />
In relation to consumer electronic products, no application had<br />
been made for additional assistance, elthough this had been<br />
foreshadowed by some companies in the industry. The Prime Minister<br />
invited the industry to prepare and submit a documented case<br />
concerning import competition. Departments would consider urgently<br />
any application submitted for a reference to the Temporary<br />
Assistance Authority.<br />
Other Industries<br />
Reference's were sent last week to the Temporary Assistance<br />
Authority on injection moulding machines and tyres. In the area of<br />
glass, tariff preferences for imports of flat glass from developing<br />
countries have been removed and the Government will be announcing<br />
decisions on the IAC's glass and glasswear report early in the<br />
New Year. Sectors of the forest products, furniture and ceramics </p>
<p>industries have foreshadowed making applications for short-term<br />
assistance. In relation to printed books which are assisted by<br />
way of bounty rather than tariff or quantitative restrictions,<br />
the. Government is currently considering representations for a wider<br />
coverage of bounty0<br />
Other Measures<br />
In the field of exchange rates the Government took action in<br />
September to devalue the Australian dollar by 12 per cent. This<br />
significantly improved the competitive position ofL Australian<br />
industry on both domestic and export markets0<br />
The Priine inister said thct thLe Department of Customs and Excise<br />
had been directed to expedite action regarding applications for<br />
anti-dumping action and to give more attention to the likelihood<br />
of injury to Australian industry from dump,. ing0<br />
Similarly, in relation to by-law policy, the Minister for Customs<br />
and Excise had already announced that this policy would be<br />
interpreted to ensure that local manufacturers were not disadvantaged<br />
vis-a-vis imports. A careful Miatch would be kept on the<br />
application of by-law policy during 1975,<br />
The Prime Minister concluded by saying that the Government would<br />
ensure that the community had a reasonable choice between imports<br />
and local manufacture. However, there was a need for a<br />
careful balance to ensure that employment opportunities were not<br />
disrupted. The Government would ensure that during 1975 the most<br />
appropriate balance was achieved between imports and local<br />
production. 0 </p>
