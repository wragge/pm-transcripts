PRIME MINISTER'S PRESS CONFERENCE<br />
COLOMBO 15 DECEMBER 1974<br />
FOLLOWING IS TEXT OF PRIME MINISTER'S PRESS CONFERENCE<br />
HELD AT 0830 HOURS SUNDAY, 15 DECEMBER.<br />
REPORTER: REGARDING THE POLICY OF IMMIGRATION YOU HAVE AT THE MOMENT<br />
IN AUSTRALIA WE SEE THERE IS A KIND OF CURTAILMENT. THERE<br />
IS A KIND OF HUNCH OR SOME PEOPLE, ESPECIALLY THE SETTLERS IN<br />
AUSTRALIA, FEEL THAT ALTHOUGH YOU STILL HAVE THIS CURTAILMENT<br />
ON THERE IS A KIND OF PREFERENCE TO SOME OF THE PEOPLE COMING<br />
FROM THE WEST WHICH IS A SORT OF UNDECLARED POLICY OF THE<br />
AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT. I'D JUST LIKE TO FIND OUT WHETHER THIS<br />
IS CORRECT OR NOT?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
THERE IS A CURTAILMENT IN THE OVERALL IMMIGRATION TO<br />
AUSTRALIA BECAUSE OF UNEMPLOYMENT WHICH.. IS AT PRESENT<br />
IN AUSTRALIA NOW BUT THERE IS NO CURTAILMENT ON REGIONAL OR<br />
RACIAL GROUNDS. THERE HAS BEEN A CURTAILMENT PERCENTAGE<br />
WISE IN RESPECT TO EUROPEAN MIGRATION JUST AS MUCH AS THERE<br />
HAS BEEN IN RESPECT TO MIGRATION WITHIN OUR REGION. ONE OF<br />
THE FACTORS WHICH ENTITLES A PERSON TO COME AS A MIGRANT<br />
TO AUSTRALIA IS THE FACT THAT HE HAS CLOSE RELATIVES IN<br />
AUSTRALIA NOMINATING HIM SUCH AS PARENTS, CHILDREN OR<br />
DEPENDANT BROTHERS OR SISTERS. THERE WOULD VERY LIKELY BE<br />
MORE SUCH PERSONS IN AUSTRALIA FROM EUROPE THAN FROM THE<br />
./ 2 N<br />
I K&gt; </p>
<p>REGION BUT, NEVERTHELESS, THE QUALIFICATIONS ARE THE SAME<br />
AND HAVE BEEN SINCE MY GOVERNMENT WAS ELECTED TWO YEARS AGO<br />
IN RESPECT OF ALL PEOPLE SEEKING TO COME TO AUSTRALIA. I<br />
THINK THERE ARE MANY THOUSANDS I'M NOT SURE THERE'S NOT<br />
ABOUT 30,000 PEOPLE IN AUSTRALIA WHO HAVE COME FROM<br />
SRI LANKA.<br />
REPORTER: IF I MAY JUST ADD ONE MORE QUESTION TO THAT. WHAT WOULD<br />
HAVE BEEN THE CONSIDERATIONS FOR THE CURTAILMENT WERE THEY<br />
POLITICAL OR a*<br />
PIAME MINISTER:<br />
ECONOM IC.<br />
REPORTER: MR PRIME MINISTER, YOU ARE A FIRM SUPPORTER OF OUR PRIME<br />
MINISTER'S INDDAN OCEAN PEACE ZONE IDEA. WHAT ARE YOUR VIEWS<br />
ON BUILDING OF THE DIEGO GARCIA BASE. THE DIEGO GAR'CIA BASE<br />
ANGLO-AMERICAN BASE IN THE INDIAN OCEAN?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
YES, WHEN WE CAME INTO OFFICE WE VOTED IN THE UNITED<br />
NATIONS GENERAL ASSEMBLY IN FAVOUR OF SRI LANKA'S PROPOSAL<br />
FOR A ZONE OF PEACE IN THE INDIAN OCEAN. THE PREVIOUS<br />
GOVERNMENT HAD NOT VOTED FOR OR AGAINST THE PROPOSAL. IT<br />
HAD ABSTAINED IN THE VOTE UPON IT. WE REMAIN OF THE VIEW<br />
THAT IT IS HELPFUL IF THE TWO GREAT POWERS, THE UNITED<br />
STATES AND THE SOVIET UNION, THE TWO GREAT NAVAL POWERS IN<br />
THE WORLD DO NOT INCREASE THEIR FORCES IN THE INDIAN OCEAN.<br />
WE RESIST THE ESCALATION OFI OR ANY CONFRONTATION BETWEEP<br />
THEM. WE HAVE MADE IT PLAIN IN BOTH WASHINGTON AND MOSCOW<br />
THAT THAT IS OUR VIEW. I'VE MADE IT PLAIN IN WASHINGTON A<br />
COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO AND I WILL BE DOING IT IN MOSCOW IN ONE<br />
MONT H. * K:~<br />

A N<br />
' S </p>
<p>REPORTER: AS A FOLLOW UP TO THIS QUESTION MAY I KNOW YOUR REACTIONS<br />
ABOUT THE RECENT CENTO EXERCISES IN THE INDIAN OCEAN CENT0,<br />
CENTO EXERCISES.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I WOUIN'T EXPRESS A VIEW ON THE CENTO ONES I'M<br />
NOT FAMILIAR ENOUGH WITH THEM AND, OF COURSE, WE AREN'T<br />
A MEMBER OF CENTO.<br />
REPORTER: IN YOUR DISCUSSIONS LAST NIGHT WITH OUR PRIME MINISTER<br />
DID YOU SUGGEST THAT SRI LANKA SHOULD JOIN ASEANO<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
THE TALKS BETWEEN THE PRIME MINISTER AND ME WERE JUST<br />
BETWEEN US, THERE WERE NO OTHERS THERE AT ALL THEY WERE<br />
PRIVATE. SO I THINK THAT YOU OUGHT TO ASK ANY QUESTIONS<br />
LIKE THAT IF I MAY SUGGEST IN THE FORM OF '" DO I -FAVOUR<br />
ANY SUCH PROPOSAL?"'<br />
REPORTER: NEVILLE DE SILVA NEW YORK TIMES<br />
ONE OF THE OBJECTIVES OF THE INDIAN OCEAN PEACE ZONE<br />
PROPOSAL IS TO SEE THAT THE INDIAN OCEAN IS FREE OF FOREIGN<br />
MILITARY BASES. IT IS NOT INCONSISTENT THAT YOU SHOULD<br />
SUPPORT THE PEACE ZONE PROPOSAL WHILE YOU PERMIT FOREIGN<br />
BASES TO EXIST ON YOUR TERRITORY? I REFER IN PARTICULAR TO<br />
THE NORTH WEST CAPE BASE.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
THERE IS ONL Y ONE MILITARY BASE ON AUSTRALIAN TERRITORfY.<br />
IT IS THE U. S. NAVAL COMMUNICATIONS STATION AT NORTH WEST<br />
CAPE. IT WAS ESTABLISHED UNDER A 25 YEAR ARRANGEMENT MADE<br />
IN 1963. IT THUS HAS 14 YEARS TO RUN. I DON'T BELIEVE THE<br />
ARRANGEMENT WOULD HAVE BEEN MADE THESE DAYS. THERE HAVE<br />
BEEN SOME NECESSARY AND ACCEPTABLE ALTERATIONS MADE TO IT<br />
SINCE MY GOVERNMENT CAME INTO OFFICE. I SIGNED THOSE<br />
0 0 / 4 Sz'<br />
N S<br />
N'<br />
N N </p>
<p>-4-<br />
ARRANGEMENTS, I EXPECT THEY WILL BE MADE STATUTORY IN THIS<br />
COMING YEAR, THE ARRANGEMENTS ARE THERE AND, OR COURSE,<br />
ONE CANNOT BREAK ARRANGEMENTS.<br />
REPORTER: ROBERT HAUPT AUSTRALIAN FINANCIAL REVIEW.<br />
POLLOWING MR DE SILVA'S QUESTION, COULD WE TAKE IT FROM<br />
YOUR REMARKS THAT IF YOU WERE IN POWER WHEN THE NORTH WEST<br />
CAPE AGREEMENT COMES UP FOR RENEWAL YOU WILL DO EVERYTHING<br />
IN YOUR POWER TO END THE ARRANGEMENT.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
THIS IS TOO SPECULATIVE I WON'T ANSWER THAT. THAT'S<br />
14 YEARS AHEAD. I EXPECT TO BE IN RETIREMENTTHEN. I WILL<br />
RET'RF MIDWAY BETWEEN NOW AND THAT TIME.<br />
REPORTER: HOW WILL YOU REGARD OUR PRIME MINISTER AS THE LEADER OF THE<br />
NON-ALIGNED NATIONS.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
MRS BANDARANAIKE HAS PLAYED A LEADING ROLE IN THE WHOLE<br />
NON-ALIGNED MOVEMENT. SHE AND PRESIDENT TITO I BELIEVE,<br />
ARE THE ONLY HEADS OF GOVERNMENT OR HEADS OF STATE WHO HAVE<br />
ATTENDED ALL FOUR NON-ALIGNED CONFERENCES. I BELIEVE, IT<br />
IS A VERY FITTING TRIBUTE TO MRS BANDARANAIKE'S STATUS IN<br />
THE WORLD AND IN THE NON-ALIGNED MOVEMENTt THAT SHE WILL BE<br />
THE HOSTESS TO THE NEXT CONFERENCE HERE IN COLOMBO IN 1976.<br />
REPORTER: U. P. I.<br />
MRPRIME MINISTER, ANY CHANCE OF AUSTRALIA PARTICIPATING<br />
IN THE NEXT W4ON-ALIGNED CONFERENCE?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
WE AREN'T A NON-ALIGNED COUNTRY BUT WE WOULD BE VERY<br />
HAPPY TO ATTEND IF WE WERE INVITED AS AN OBSERVER. </p>
<p>REPORTER: NEVILLE DE SILVA NEW YORK TIMES<br />
WOULD YOU CARE TO COMMENT ON MR BREZHNEVS PROPOSAL FOR<br />
ASIAN COLLECTIVE SECURITY SYSTEMS.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
NO. THE PROPOSAL WAS MADE ABOUT THREE YEARS OR SO AGO<br />
NOW. I WOULD RATHER SEE WHAT THE PRESENT OBJECTIVES OR<br />
PROPOSAL ARE I CAN DO THAT WITHIN A MONTH. I'D RATHER<br />
HEAR DIRECTLY, SOON, RATHER THAN COMMENT AT THIS DISTANCE<br />
FROM THE ORIGINAL PROPOSAL.<br />
REPORTER: MANIK DE SILVA CEYLON DAILY NEWS.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
VERY GOOD EDITORIAL YESTERDAYGOODo<br />
REPORTER: COULD YOU KINDLY COMMENT ON FUTURE SRI LANKA/ AUSTRALIAN<br />
RELATIONS? PARTICULARLY IN THE CONTEXT OF YOUR HAVING MET<br />
OUR PRIME MINISTER LAST NIGHT.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE VERY GOOD OPPORTUNITIES FOR<br />
MAKING THE RELATIONS BETWEEN SRI LANKA AND AUSTRALIA MORE<br />
DIRECT AND SUBSTANTIAL THE PRIME MINISTER ASKED ME TO VISIT<br />
CEYLON WITHIN A COUPLE OF WEEKS OF MY BECOMING PRIME MINISTER.<br />
IT WAS ONE OF THE VERY FIRST INVITATIONS I RECEIVED. I<br />
THINK I CAN SAY THAT I CAME TO KNOW THE PRIME MINISTER QUITE<br />
WELL AT OTTAWA LAST AUGUST, DURING THE MEETING OF THE<br />
COMMONWEALTH HEADS OF GOVERNMENT. MY WIFE WAS THERE AND<br />
MRS BANDARANAIKE'S DAUGHTERS WERE THERE AND SO NOT ONLY DURING<br />
THE CONFERENCE WHICH EXTENDED OVER, I THINK, SEVEN WORKING<br />
DAYS, BUT ALSO THE INTERVENING WEEKEND AND AT VARIOUS OTHER<br />
OCCASIONS ONE OF WHICH WAS HER GRACIOUS INVITATION TO ME TO<br />
HAVE LUNCH WITH HER. I THINK I CAN SAY WE CAME TO KNOW EACH<br />
OTHER QUITE WELL. IT'S BEEN, OF COURSE, A VERY GREAT PLEASURE<br />
6<br />
oN </p>
<p>FOR ME TO SPEND SOME HOURS WITH HER LAST NIGHT. SHE HAS BEEN<br />
A HEAD OF GOVERNMENT FOR LONGER THAN MOST PEOPLE IN THE WORLD.<br />
SHE BECAME THE HEAD OF GOVERNMENT, OFCOURSE, IN 1960<br />
AND HAS CONTINUED WITH A FIVE YEAR INTERVAL AND SHE REMAINS<br />
A FIGURE OF VERY GREAT INTERNATIONAL INTEREST BECAUSE SHE<br />
WAS . THE FIRST WOMAN TO BECOME A PRIME MINISTER.<br />
REPORTER: DE SILVA<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
ANOTHER DE SILVA. THE PORTUGESE INFLUENCE IS STILL<br />
TERRIBLY STRONG HERE.<br />
REPORTER: DO YOU SEE ANY FAINT SIGNS OF PROGRESS TOWARDS DETENTE<br />
BETWEEN CHINA AND THE SOVIET UNION?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I'D RATHER NOT COMMENT ON THIS MATTER. I'D OBVIOUSLY<br />
BE IN A BETTER. POSITION TO MAKE AN ASSESSMENT IN A MONTH'S<br />
TIME AFTER I'VE BEEN TO THE SOVIET UNION. I'M RELATIVELY<br />
HOPEFUL THAT THERE ARE SUCH SIGNS. THE GREAT STEP TOWARDS<br />
DETENTE RECENLY HAS BEEN THE MEETING BETWEEN MR BREZCHNEV<br />
AND MR FORD IN VLADIVOSTOK.<br />
REPORTER ( INDISTINCT)<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
OH NO, NO, A TROIKA. ARE THERE ANY OTHER DE SILVA'S.<br />
HERE? FOUR DE SILVAS A QUADRUMVERATE.<br />
REPORTER: HOW FAVOURABLE DO YOU THINK YOUR RELATIONS ARE WITH THE<br />
EUROPEAN COMMON MARKET? o,/ 7 </p>
<p>7--<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC<br />
COMMUNITY IS ONE OF THE THREE GREAT COMMERCIAL AREAS OF<br />
INTEREST TO AUSTRALIA. IN VERY ROUGH TERMS ONE THIRD OF<br />
AUSTRALIA'S TRADE TAKES PLACE WITH THE EECo ONE THIRD WITH<br />
JAPAN AND ONE THIRD WITH THE UNITED STATES. CLEARLY, THEREFORE,<br />
IT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO AUSTRALIA THAT SHE SHOULD BE AWARE<br />
OF AND SHE SHOULD BE INVOLVED IN THE AFFAIRS OF THE COMMON<br />
MARKET. TRADITIONALLY, AUSTRALIA'S INTERESTS WITH THE MEMBER<br />
COUNTRIES OF THE COMMON MARKET HAS BEEN IN AGRICULTURAL AND<br />
PASTORAL PRODUCTS. NOW THERE IS A VERY GREAT PROSPECT OF<br />
INTEREST IN MINERAL PRODUCTS. THE COMMON MARKET IS NATURALLY<br />
CONCERNED WITH THE ENERGY CRISISo AUSTRALIA HAS VERY GREAT<br />
ENERGY RESOURCES. THE ENERGY RESOURCE IN WHICH THE MEMBERS<br />
Or fHE COMMON MARKET ARE MOSTLY INTERESTED IS URANIUM. WE<br />
WOULD HAVE IN AUSTRALIA ABOUT ONE FIFTH OF THE KNOWN<br />
PROVEN URANIUM RESERVES IN THE WORLD. FURTHERMORE, EUROPE<br />
IS INTERESTED IN, FOR INSTANCE, OUR COAL TO A CERTAIN<br />
EXTENT BECAUSE THERE hGAIN WE HAVE VERY GREAT COAL RESERVES<br />
OF ALL SORTS FOR HYDROGENATION AND FOR STEAMING AND FOR<br />
METALLURGICAL PURPOSESe THE LOT.. o. WE HAVE IN VERY GOOD<br />
QUANTITIES AND EUROPE HAS MADE IT PLAIN BY DELEGATIONS FOR<br />
INSTANCE, THE FOREIGN MINISTER OF THE EEC, SIR CHRISTOPHER<br />
SOAMES, HAS BEEN TO AUSTRALIA AND IN A SOMEWHAT RELATED AREA<br />
THE OECDt THE SECRETARY-GENERAL, YONKIER FARN-LINETTE<br />
HAS BEEN TWICE TO AUSTRALIA. NOW IT'S BEEN VERY CLEAR TO<br />
ME IN THE CONVERSATIONS WHICH I MYSELF HAVE HAD AND SEVERAL<br />
OF MY MINISTERS HAVE HAD WITH SIR CHRISTOPHER SOAMES AND<br />
MR FARN-LINETTE THAT THE COMMON MARKET IS VERY INTERESTED IN<br />
THE DEVELOPMENT OF AUSTRALIA'S RESOURCES AND THE COMMON<br />
MARKET'S PARTICIPATION IN THAT DEVELOPMENT. FURTHERMORE,<br />
THERE IS THE GENERAL QUESTION OF TRADE AND INVESTMENT AND<br />
DEVELOPMENT AMONG COUNTRIES OF THE COMMON MARKET OR<br />
AUSTRALIA PATTERN THE OECD PATTERN. THE GREAT ECONOMIC<br />
PROBLEMS WHICH BESET AUSTRALIA ARE JUST THE SAME AS THOSE<br />
WHICH BESET THE COMMON MARKET COUNTRIES AND IN FACT, OF.<br />
COURSE, ALL THE OECD COUNTRIES BECAUSE THE OECD CONSISTS<br />
IN EFFECT OF THE COMMON MARKET, MOST OF THEM, AND<br />
AUSTRALIA, NEW ZEALAND AND JAPAN AND THE UNITED STATES AND<br />
CANADA, SO IT ' S VERY IMPORTANT INDEED THAT THESE COUNTRIES,<br />
AS I POINT OUT, THREE QUARTERS OF AUSTRALIA'S TRADE TAKES<br />
PLACE WITHIN THE OECD CONTEXT AND MOST OF OUR INVESTMENT </p>
<p>AND TECHNOLOGY IS IN THAT CONTEXT. NOW IN THESE<br />
CIRCUMSTANCES IT IS VERY IMPORTANT INDEED THAT AUSTRALIA<br />
AND THE EEC SHOULD BE CONSTANTLY IN CONTACT,<br />
REPORTER: FERNANDO<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
ANOTHER PORTUGESE'. ANY MORE FERNANDO'S OR PERERA'S,<br />
NO PERERA'S? RIGHT FOUR DE SILVAS, TWO FERNANDOSo<br />
REPORTER: WHAT ARE YOUR RELATIONS WITH THE PEOPLES REPUBLIC OF CHINA<br />
AND HAVE THEY IMPROVED SINCE YOU BECAME PRIME MINISTER?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
CLOSE YES. MY GOVERNMENT WITHIN A COUPLE OF WEEKS OF<br />
COMING TO OFFICE NORMALISED RELATIONS WITH THE PEOPLES<br />
REPUBLIC OF CHINA AND, MR BOWEN, THE SPECIAL MINISTER OF<br />
STATE, THE MINISTER WHO ASSISTS ME, WENT TO CHINA IN THE<br />
MIDDLE OF LAST YEARo I, MYSELF, WENT THERE WITH THREE OTHER<br />
MINISTERS IN NOVEMBER LAST YEAR. THE DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER,<br />
DR CAIRNS, WHO IS NOW THE TREASURER AND AT THAT TIME WAS THE<br />
MINISTER FOR OVERSEAS TRADE, WENT THERE TWO MONTHS AGO.<br />
THERE IS QUITE A CLOSE RELATIONSHIP NOW BETWEEN THE PRC AND<br />
AUSTRALIA. THIS IS GROWING COMMERCIALLY AND CLEARLY, OF<br />
COURSE, WE TAKE INTO ACCOUNT WHAT THE ATTITUDES OF CHINA<br />
ARE LIKELY TO BE TO OUR NEIGHBOURS AND THE ATTITUDES OF OUR<br />
NEIGHBOURS TO CHINAo IT'S SIGNIFICANT OF COURSE, THAT<br />
THERE HAS BEEN A CONSIDERABLE MOVEMENT AMONG THE ASEAN<br />
COUNTRIES TO NORMALISE RELATIONS WITH CHINA NOWo SUCH<br />
RELATIONS HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED BETWEEN MALAYSIA AND CHINA,<br />
AND THERE HAVE BEEN TOP VISITS FROM THAILAND AND. THE<br />
PHILIPPINES TO CHINA.<br />
REPORTER: PRIME MINISTER:<br />
WHAT'S YOUR NAME? i </p>
<p>REPORTER: TAMIL NEWSPAPER,<br />
T1iE WESTERN NATIONS ARE MILITARILY AND PHYSICALLY STRONG<br />
AND WEt IN OUR VIEWt WE ARE SPIRITUALLY STRONG. STRONGER<br />
THAN THE MILITARY STRENGTH OF THE WESTERN NATIONS0 SO AS<br />
W2: LL AS AUSTRALIA IS. CONCERNEDt WHICH ONE IT GIVES TOP<br />
PRIORITY FOR THE SPIRITUAL SIDE OR THE PHYSICAL SIDE?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I DON'T KNOW THAT ANY ANSWER I COULD GIVE TO THAT<br />
QUESTION WOULD BE SATISFACTORY. I CERTAINLY OBSERVE AND<br />
APLFtJD THE SPIRITUAL STRENGTH OF MANY COUNTRIES IN THIS<br />
REGION. IT IS ONE OF THE VERY HOPEFUL SIGNS THAT THERE<br />
ARE SEVERAL COUNTRIES IN THIS REGION WHICH HAVE THE<br />
CONFIDENCE, THE DIGNITY, WHICH STEMS FROM HAVING CENTURIES<br />
OF IDENTITY IN THE ONE GEOGRAPHICAL AREA AND THAT IDENTITYp<br />
THAT CONFIDENCE, THAT SERENITY, HAS SURVIVED ONSLAUGHTS FROM<br />
OUTSIDE, YOUR OWN COUNTRY HAS BEEN RULED BY THREE EUROPEAN<br />
NATIONS, THREE GREAT EMPIRES IN THE LAST FOUR CENTURIES OR<br />
SO. THE EMPIRES ARE GONE AND SRI LANKA REMAINS. THERE AREA<br />
SEVERAL OTHER COUNTRIES WHICH HAVE THAT SAME CONTINUITY AND<br />
COHESION AND IDENTITY IN A GEOGRAPHICAL AREA AND THEY ALSO<br />
HAVE THE ADVANTAGE OF HAVING OVER CENTURIES BEEN ABLE TO COME<br />
TO SOME ACCOMMODATION WITH THEIR NEIGHBOURS WHO MAY BE<br />
DIFFERENT IN RELIGION OR RACE OR HISTORY BUT, NEVERTHELESS,<br />
HAVE A SIMILAR COHESION, IDENTITY AND CONFIDENCE, THERE ARE<br />
GREAT ADVANTAGES IN THIS, THE OLD INTRUSION FROM EUROPE<br />
TO DIVIDE AND RULE CAN NO LONGER APPLY.<br />
REPORTER: WHEN YOU'RE . IN EUROPE, WHAT ASSURANCES WILL YOU BE GIVING<br />
TO, PARTICULARLY ITALY AND GERMANY, REGARDING SUPPLY OF<br />
AUSTRALIAN URANIUM AND THE SALE?<br />
;' hfliff MINISTER<br />
THE ATTITUDE THAT WE'VE TAKEN TO SUPPLYING URANIUM TO<br />
THOSE COUNTRIES HAS ALREADY BEEN MADE PLAIN ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS I U V. </p>
<p>FOR SOME TIME PAST BY MY MINISTER FOR MINERALS AN ENERGY.<br />
THEY RELATE TO THE USES, THE PEACEFUL USES, THAT WILL BE MADE<br />
OF NUCLEAR FUELS. THE DEGREE OF CONTROL EXERCISED OVER THEM<br />
WITHIN AUSTRALIA, AND THE PROPER RETURN WHICH AUSTRALIA WILL<br />
GET FROM THEM AND PARTICIPATION WHICH AUSTRALIA WILL GET IN THEM.<br />
VERY OBVIOUSLY THERE ARE COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD WHICH HAVE MUCH<br />
GREATER TECHNOLOGY THAN AUSTRALIA CAN HOPE TO ACQUIRE IN THE NEAR<br />
FUTURE OR WHICH, SAY JAPAN HAS AT THIS STAGE. NOW IN THESE<br />
CIRCUMSTANCES, IT'S VERY MATERIAL TO DISCUSS THESE MATTERS ON THE<br />
SPOT AND I'LL BE VISITING BRUSSELS, THE CAPITAL OF THE COMMON<br />
MARKET, AND OF COURSE, ALSO GERMANY AND FRANCE AND ITALY AND<br />
BRITAIN, ALL OF WHICH HAVE INTERESTS IN THIS MATTER, AND I'M<br />
ACCOMPANIED BY SIR LENOX HEWITT, THE SECRETARY OF THE DEPARTMENT<br />
OF MINERALS AND ENERGY, WHO HAS BEEN INVOLVED IN ALL THESE<br />
MATTERS IN ALL THESE COUNTRIES THROUGHOUT OUR TERM OF OFFICE0<br />
REPORTER DE SILVA TIMES''<br />
MAY I TURN FROM THE SPIRITUAL TO THE POLITICALo WOULD YOU<br />
CARE TO COMMENT ON PAKISTAN'S PROPOSAL FOR A NUCLEAR WEAPON FREE<br />
ZONE IN SOUTH ASIA.<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
WE SUPPORTED THIS PROPOSAL AS WE SUPPORTED ALL THE SIMILAR<br />
PROPOSALS IN THE UNITED NATIONS IN THE LAST FEW WEEKS. IRAN<br />
MADE ONE AND THERE HAVE BEEN SEVERALo<br />
REPORTER LANKA DIVA<br />
IN MORE OF THE SAME ( INDISTINCT) OF MR BREZHNEV'S SUGGESTION<br />
OF COLLECTIVE SECURITY SYSTEM AND THE EXPANSION OF ASEAN<br />
COMMUNITYo<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
WELL WE AREN'T A MEMBER OF ASEAN AND WHAT THE ATTITUDE " OF THE<br />
MEMBERS OF ASEAN TO EXPANDING THEIR MEMBERSHIP MAY BE, IS A<br />
MATTER FOR THEMo ASEAN HAS BEEN A MOST VALUABLE ARRANGEMENT AND<br />
IT HAS DEVELOPED CONSISTENTLY OVER THE YEARSø AUSTRALIA WOULD<br />
VIEW WITH FAVOUR ANY EXPANSION OF ASEAN. NOW WHICH COUNTRIES 0 ,0/ 11 </p>
<p>-FRIN<br />
SHOULD COME IN IS REALLY NOT FOR AUSTRALIA TO SUGGEST -IT IS N<br />
FOR THE FIVE PRESENT MEMBERSO<br />
REPORTER BEFORE THE SECOND WORLD WAR THERE WERE EIGHT MAJOR POWERS<br />
GEIRMANY, ITALY, JAPAN, BRITAIN, RUSSIA, AMERICA AND ALL THOSE<br />
THINGS. NOW IT IS R~ EDUCED TO TWO WORLD SUPER POWERS. THAT IS<br />
BECAUSE OTP'THIS PHYSICAL CONFLICT. BECAUSE OF THE PHYSICAL<br />
CONFLICT WORLD POWERS HAVE REDUCED TO TWO FROM EIGHT* SO IN<br />
THAT CASE, EIGHT OF SUPPOSED COUNTRIES LIKE ASIA JOIN THESE<br />
COUNTRIES OF ASIA THE OTHER NEIGHBOURING COUNTRIES THAT MEANS<br />
TO MAKE THE INDIAN OCEAN A FREE ZONE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.<br />
IF IT DESISTS FROM JOINING THE MILITARY PACTS I THINK IT WOULD N<br />
BE VJERY HELPFUL TO THE BENEFIT OF THE FUTURE WORLD,<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
I'M NOT SURE IF I CAUGHT OR FOLLOWED EVERYTHING YOU WERE<br />
PUTTING TO ME. I DOUBT IF THERE WILL BE ANY MORE MILITARY PACTS<br />
IN THE WORLD, THERE HAVEN'T BEEN ANY NEW ONES FOR MANY YEARS<br />
NOW. THERE WERE A FEW MADE IN THE 1960' S IN THE VIET-NAM<br />
CONTEXT AND THE LESS SAID ABOUT THEM THE BETTERO* AND. THE ONES<br />
THAT WERE MADE IN THE 50' S HAVE NOT REALLY BEEN EXPANDED MUCH<br />
SINCE. I THINK THE DAYS OF MILITARY PACTS ARE NUMBERED. I DON'T<br />
KNOW OF ANY WHICH ANY OF THE GREAT POWERS ARE NOW SEEKING TO<br />
FORM.<br />
REPORTER FERNANDO<br />
MR PRIME MINISTER WOULD YOU CARE TO COMMENT ON THE OPPOSITION<br />
TO YOUR OVERSEAS JOURNEY FROM THE HOME FRONT AND ALSO ON THE<br />
REPORTED BOMB SCARE ON BOARD THE PLANE YOU ARRIVED ONO<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
OH I WON'T COMMENT ON THE FIRST BECAUSE THAT HAPPENS WJHENEVER<br />
WE ARE STILL VERY PROVINCIAL, 1 MUST CONFESS0 AND<br />
; O HE0OTHER ONE IT BEARS OUT THE WISDOM OF THE HEAD OF GOVERNMENT " N<br />
CHARTERING HIS OWN PLANE IN THIS RESPECT. IF THIS BOMB SCARE<br />
HAD BEEN MADE IN RESPECT OF A COMMERCIAL PLANE THEN THE WHOLE OF<br />
THE JOURNEY WOULD HAVE HAD TO BE DISRUPTED. WE WOULD HAVE HAD TO </p>
<p>DELAY OR DEFLIGHT, 9 GO BACK TO BASEt UNLOAD AND SO. ON. BUT<br />
WE KNEW FOR CERTAIN WHAT WAS ON THE PLANE, SO ANY SCARE LIKE<br />
THAT WE KNEW TO BE A COMPLETE HOAX. YOU WOULDN'T KNOW IN THE<br />
CASE OF A COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT BECAUSE YOU CAN'T BE CERTAIN WHAT<br />
IS IN THE HOLDS OR THE LUGGAGE OR ON THE PERSONS OF THE PASSENGERS.<br />
SO IT ' WOULD SEEM, IF ONE TRAVELLED COMMERCIALLY IT WOULD NOT<br />
ONLY DISRUPT THE OFFI* CIAL PARTY IT WOULD INCONVENIENCE AND DISTRESS<br />
THE UNOFFICI. AL 0 THE CIVILIAN PASSENGERS AS WELL.<br />
REPORTER DID IT BOTHER YOU IN ANY WAYo<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
I DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT IT UNTIL DURING DINNER LAST NIGHT. IT<br />
DIDN'T PUT ME OFF THE FOOD.<br />
REPORTER MR PRIME MINISTER MAY I ASK YOU A QUESTION ON CRICKET.*<br />
YOU KNOW INDIA, PAKISTAN AND SRI LANKA ARE FORMING THE -ASIAN<br />
CRICKET CONFERENCE BECAUSE SINCE MANY YEARS CEYLON, SRI LANKA HAS<br />
BEEN TRYING TO GET INTO THE INTERNATIONAL CRICKET<br />
CONFERENCE.<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
YE S<br />
RE PORTER AND UNFORTUNATELY SHE HAS BEEN KEPT OUT BECAUSE AUSTRALIA<br />
AND BRITAIN, I BELIEVE, HAVE A VETO POWER, IN THE INTERNATIONAL<br />
CRICKET CONFERENCE. SO WE HAVE JUST FORMED THE ASIAN CRICKET<br />
CONFERE NCE, WHAT ARE YOUR VIEWS ON IT MR PRIME MINISTER.<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
WELL I9M VERY GLAD TO HEAR THIS. I DIDN'T KNOW THAT<br />
AUSTRALIA AND BRITAIN HAD VETO POWERS IN THIS RESPECT I'M<br />
0/ 13 K~]<br />
K </p>
<p>EMBARRASSED TO HEAR IT. NEVERTHELESS AS YOU APPRECIATE THE<br />
SPORTING ASSOCIATION ARE ENTIRELY VOLUNTARY ONES AS FAR AS MY<br />
COUNTRY IS CONCERNED. IT'S TRUE MY GOVERNMENT IS NOW SUBSIDISING<br />
INTERNATIONAL SPORTING CONTESTS AND I'D BE GLAD TO<br />
KNOW IF THERE IS ANY SUCH VETO POWER BEING USED BY OUR CRICKET<br />
ASSOCIATION. IF THERE IS, IT WOULD OBVIOUSLY AFFECT OUR VIEW<br />
OF' THEIR ENTITLEMENT' TO ANY SUBSIDIES IN THIS RESPECT. NOW, 9<br />
I THOUGHT WE WERE GOING TO GIVEt OR LEND, 9 A FAST BOWLER TO HELP<br />
IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF CRICKET IN THIS COUNTRY. ONE OF THE<br />
REMARKABLE THINGS ABOUT THE OLD BRITISH EMPIRE WAS THAT ALL<br />
ITS MEMBERS ARE HAVE DEVELOPED THIS FASCINATION WITH CRICKET.<br />
NOW INDIA, AND PAKISTAN HAVE FOR A VERY LONG TIME. THE WEST<br />
INDIES HAS AND I'M DELIGHTED TO HEAR THAT SRI LANKA IS DEVELOP-<br />
.( NG IT TO O0 I'VE NO REASON TO THINK THAT THEY SHOULDN'T<br />
BE 3 OUTSTANDING IN THE GAME AS INDIA AND PAKISTAN HAVE LONG<br />
BEEN KNOWN TO BE, INTERNATIONALLY.<br />
REPORTER CAN YOU ENLIGHTEN US ABOUT ANZUS THE PACT BETWEEN AUSTRALIA<br />
AND NEW ZEALAND AND THE UNITED STATES ITS PURPOSES AND ITS<br />
FUNCTIONS ANZUS.<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
YES., 9 ANZUS HAS BEEN THERE FOR WELL OVER 20 YEARS<br />
NOW A ND IT ' S NEVER CALL ED I N QUESTIO0N I N AUSTR AL IA, NEW<br />
ZEALAND OR THE UNITED STATES. THE FUNCTIONS OF IT, OF COURSE,<br />
ARE WELL KNOWN THEY ARE SET OUT IN PUBLIC DOCUMENTS. THERE<br />
IS AN ANNUAL, SOMETIMES MORE FREQUENT CONSULTATION BUT IT'S<br />
JUST NOT A MATTER OF CONTROVERSY OR CHALLENGE IN ANY OF THE<br />
THREE COUNTRIES.<br />
REPORTER THANK YOU, PRIME MINISTER. 9 N </p>
