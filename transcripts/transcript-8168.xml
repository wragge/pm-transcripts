PARTIAL TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW ON ABC GRANDSTAND, DARWIN,<br />
OCTOBER 1990<br />
E OE PROOF ONLY<br />
INTERVIEWER: Well let's talk about sport. Politicians, of<br />
course, enjoy a high profile in sport. I think in the last<br />
couple of weeks we've seen Robert Ray on the front page of<br />
The Age.<br />
PM: Not the most elegant picture was it.<br />
INTERVIEWER: No not at all. Another politician, I think,<br />
on the front page of The Sydney Morning Herald and<br />
Paul Keating of course joining Collingwood. Is that because<br />
politicians like to get away from the hurly burly of<br />
Parliament and their electoral responisibilities; or is<br />
being involved with sport good for the image?<br />
PM: Well, I think it's different things for different<br />
people. I mean, in my case, I've been a sports fanatic ever<br />
since I was a kid. It's been part of my life. I played<br />
first grade cricket in Western Australia for about six years<br />
before going to Oxford. I played baseball for the<br />
university and have always been very keen on tennis and now<br />
golf. I just regard sport as an intrinsically important<br />
part of a fully rounded life. I just love it. So it comes<br />
0 naturally for me. For others I think perhaps they think it<br />
does them some good to be seen with sporting people. You<br />
know, it's different things for different people but with<br />
me, I mean I just love sport myself and I love being with<br />
sporting people.<br />
INTERVIEWER: inaudible<br />
PM: Well I suppose with Paul he's a New South Wales bloke<br />
and getting involved with a Victorian Aussie Rules side<br />
gives him an extension. I know from talking to him that he<br />
really does like the game. With John Hewson, although he's<br />
my political opponent, from what I understand he's got a<br />
legitimate interest in sport. I think he's been a pretty<br />
good golfer in his time. So politicians, you know, when it<br />
comes down to the line they're not that much different to<br />
other people in terms of their likes. Australians generally<br />
are a people who like their sport. </p>
<p>2.<br />
INTERVIEWER: Sport, of course, being one of the great<br />
levellers, particularly up here in the Northern Territory<br />
with football. Football has always been regarded up here as<br />
the showpiece, perhaps, of Darwin society where Aboriginals<br />
and people from interstate and Europeans etcetera all mix<br />
together. Do you think that sport sometimes has more to<br />
offer some of the social issues than perhaps politics or<br />
legislation does?<br />
PM: I think it's a marvellous part of bringing Australians<br />
together. You mention, for instance, our Aboriginal people<br />
there's just so many of them who just seem to bring a very<br />
special gift of timing and fleetness of foot and agility to<br />
football. Not only this code. We've got so many that come<br />
from here [ Maurice Rioli]. I was just having a yarn to<br />
Maurice out at the races today. I saw him in his last game<br />
in Perth in 1981. I saw him then and I said to people,<br />
God he'll be a star in Victoria. You see them in other<br />
codes too. Since I've been Prime Minister I've got to know<br />
about Rugby League. I've been living in Canberra and we've<br />
got the Raiders team there that's now won two years in a<br />
row. They've got that magnificent winger, Chicka Ferguson,<br />
I mean, just a magnificent athlete.<br />
INTERVIEWER: Fabulous player. Not only for his fleetness<br />
of foot but his fitness for his age.<br />
PM: Fitness for age. I know him quite well because he's<br />
the electrician at The Lodge. He comes in and he often pops<br />
in and you see him and you never pick him. This lazy loping<br />
around way but you see him on a field and he's the most<br />
elusive bloke you've ever seen.<br />
INTERVIEWER: Yes. He's in fabulous form. In fact, his<br />
form in the Grand Final was terrific. You just wonder,<br />
for how many seasons will Chicka Ferguson go on?<br />
PM: He's not going to play. He's finished now.<br />
INTERVIEWER: Yes well he said that at the end of the season<br />
but he said<br />
PM: No I think he meant it.<br />
INTERVIEWER: inaudible<br />
PM: That's a bit rough David.<br />
INTERVIEWER: inaudible<br />
PM: About accurate.<br />
INTERVIEWER: inaudible<br />
PM: Yes. It's been a significant part of it. It's been<br />
pleasing, in one sense, to get the acknowledgement from<br />
President de Klerk and other, for instance, the head of the<br />
Reserve Bank there though. They've made it clear that the<br />
I </p>
<p>pressures that have been put on by the rest of the world,<br />
including Australia, is the thing which has now brought them<br />
to the negotiating table. Of course, from my point of view,<br />
I hope that as soon as it's reasonable now we'll be able to<br />
lift the sanctions. We'll want to do that as soon as it's<br />
clear that the processes are irreversible. We've always<br />
wanted to not bring South Africa to its knees, as I've put<br />
it, but bring them to the negotiating table. It looks as<br />
though those processes are getting to the stage where they<br />
may well be irreversible and then when that happens well<br />
then these sanctions will be able to be lifted and they are<br />
a talented sporting people. Of course, when you get the<br />
integration of the much larger non-white population fully<br />
integrated into their sport well then you'll see a much<br />
stronger South Africa in all fields of sport.<br />
INTERVIEWER: It's quite awsome to consider even South<br />
Africa's ability in cricket, for example, and it was<br />
segregated. If they open it up to their entire population<br />
they may well be unbeatable for years and years.<br />
PM: They could be. Of course, they're great rugby union<br />
players. So if they, as you say, fully integrate their<br />
society and develop the talents of all their population they<br />
could be very, very formidable opponents.<br />
