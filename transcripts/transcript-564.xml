No. 51.-/ 19262<br />
STATEMENT BY T1TH PRIME MINISTER, RT. HON. R. G. MENZIES3<br />
The Prime Minister, Mr,, Menzies, said<br />
today " I have arranged with Mr. Bury that<br />
the text of his speech should be sent to me.<br />
I will study it caref'ully,<br />
Meanwhile, so that there may be no<br />
misunderstanding either at home or abroad, I want<br />
t'o make it quite clear that Mr. Mc~ wen's work overseus<br />
and my oydn latei-visit both to the United Kingdom<br />
and to the United States were clearly based upcn<br />
our conviction a conviction shared by the<br />
Cabinet that the economic problems which would<br />
be presented to Australia by any entry cf Great<br />
Britain into the Common Market on terms which<br />
did not reasonably protect our export trade would<br />
be of very sericus moment. The whole purpose of<br />
the current activities of Australia in relation to<br />
the Common Market negotiations is to minimise<br />
economic injury. I want to repeat that the views<br />
which have been expressed by Mr. Mc~ wen and myself<br />
in relation to these matters are the views of the<br />
Cabinet. I myself' have stated our position not<br />
only in Parliament but publ~ icly in London and America<br />
and in Australia since my return,, There is nothing<br />
to subtract from these statements."<br />
CANBERRA, 26th July, 71962. </p>
