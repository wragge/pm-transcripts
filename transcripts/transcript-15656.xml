<p>JOURNALIST: </p>
<p>Prime Minister, you have been speaking about the benefits of AWAs in Western Australia but there are workers in the east, in particular in retail and in hospitality, who are getting less now than they were before. Why did you proceed with WorkChoices when your Cabinet was told that there would be losers?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:  </p>
<p>Well Mr Andrews and I both, after discussing that report in the book, dispute that version. But look, we have a Fairness Test which says that if any worker is asked to give up penalty rates or overtime loadings they have to get fair compensation and the great generality of people have benefited enormously from the changes. More people are in work and here in Western Australia the loss of AWAs would cost workers in many cases hundreds of dollars a week. One in four workers in Western Australia is on an AWA. And to abolish AWAs in Western Australia will cause chaos and loss of income. It's madness to contemplate it yet the Labor Party is hell bent on creating that madness and chaos in Western Australia.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>But so you dispute...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Mr Andrews and I dispute the version that appeared in that book.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>What it's not true?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well we dispute the version. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I am sorry?</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>The Nationals are urging people to hold off converting from CDMA to next...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I am sorry, who is that?</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>The Nationals.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh, I am sorry, the Nationals. Yes, yes, I am sorry. The National Party.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Yes. The National Party is urging people to hold off from converting from CDMA to Next G because they believe there will be too many black spots particularly for people in the bush. What is your message to...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well our message is that we want to be completely satisfied that the new system will work effectively and we have sought assurances on that and we will take whatever action is required to guarantee that that occurs.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, did you, your Cabinet or your Cabinet taskforce ever get advice suggesting that stopping the Tampa from entering Australian waters might be illegal?</p>
<p>   PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No. I am mystified at this. I remember this very clearly. Henry Burmeister and Bill Campbell actually came to a meeting of the National Security Committee of Cabinet. I am told it was on the 27th of August and advised that what we were proposing to do was perfectly legal. What is more, didn't the case end up before the full Federal Court and didn't the full Federal Court uphold what the Government had done?</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>What do you say to those workers on AWAs who are getting less now who are not getting, are not as well off that aren't doing it so good?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, Jim, it would depend entirely on whether they were workers who were previously not in jobs and...</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>(Inaudible)</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I dispute that. And the whole purpose of the Fairness Test is to make certain that they aren't worse off.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, you have spoken today of the benefits of Barry Haase. Will he ever be off the backbench?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well look, I don't speculate about future Cabinet appointments. I appoint people on merit. Hard work is part of the criteria that I use to decide whether or not people should be promoted but Barry is a wonderful member and he is a person who has worked very hard and he has an understanding of a large chunk of remote and regional Australia.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, can I ask about Dr Haneef - Mohamed Haneef.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>   JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Do you have confidence in the way that case has been investigated or do you think it should be just time to let him go?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Look, this case should be investigated and handled by the police and the Director of Public Prosecutions. It's not for me to say whether he should be let go. A decision has been taken about his visa. But can I make the observation that the Labor Party is playing a double game on Dr Haneef. They are saying through Mr Rudd that the matter is being handled correctly yet Mr Rudd has his agents like the Queensland Premier out there attacking the Federal Police. To call the Federal Police keystone cops is disgraceful. The Federal Police are integral to the fight against terrorism in this country and it is quite irresponsible of Labor figures such as Mr Beattie to use that sort of language. He is playing cheap politics, he ought to know better. He didn't like politics being played in relation to difficult legal issues in his own state and I regard this as part of a pattern with the Labor Party. Mr Rudd stands up there and supports the Government, somebody else is sent out to run interference so that if the going gets a bit tough the Labor Party can switch its position.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Are you frustrated that the polls are (inaudible) to believe that it is working?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well Jim, I am not going to give another commentary on the polls. Come on Jim. I know you have come, I know you have come a long way to ask me that question but I am not going to alter my answer.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, you mention zone rebates and (inaudible) shares. Is there really any chance of those, either of those bulletins being...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well we have taken the view that the best thing to do for taxpayers is to cut their tax and I know that workers in Kalgoorlie appreciate the fact that the top rate of marginal tax from the 1st of July next year will only apply to $180,000 which is a huge improvement on what it was a few years ago.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Why should they vote for Mr Haase if he hasn't managed to get...</p>
<p>   PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I think they should vote for Mr Haase because he is not only an energetic member but he is also part of a Government that has seen unemployment fall in Kalgoorlie to what 3.6 or thereabouts. This electorate is enjoying very significant prosperity, that's not to say there aren't some people as there are in all parts of Australia who are doing it tough. I recognise that. But the general level of prosperity in this part of Australia is all around to see and every small business man and woman in this electorate should vote for Mr Haase to keep those dreaded unfair dismissal laws from returning.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>The situation in the Kimberley with child abuse, is the State Government handling it properly or is the Federal Government going...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I think the State Government has played, once again, a double game on this. When I first made my announcement Mr Carpenter said it was another Tampa - another Tampa - they were his words. Within two weeks his acting premier was asking us for police. Providing police is a fundamental responsibility of a state government and that just shows the politics that the Labor Party plays with many issues. See, somebody says one thing and somebody else over there says something else so you cover every base. So that if it all, sort of, gets difficult you can say, well we were always very critical of it and Mr Rudd has arranged for this to occur in relation to quite a lot of issues.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, is it never too late for a political party to change leaders if it means (inaudible)?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Jim, I think you are asking me whether I will be leading the party to the next election. The answer is yes.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>(Inaudible)</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, no, well I am not going to answer a hypothetical question like a commentator. The answer is yes to my question. You know, I'll ask the question, I'll give the answer as well.</p>
<p>   JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>When would you like to retire Mr Howard?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh, I am not going to talk about retirement. I have got a lot to do. I am very fixated on the next term.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>When would you like to come back to Kalgoorlie?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>When would I like to come back to Kalgoorlie? Oh, soon. I may, in fact, come back sooner than you think.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>So you could be back before the election?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I wouldn't be surprised. I expect to be in Western Australia between now and the end of the year.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>How many seats do you think you could pick up here?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh look, Jim, I am not making any bold predictions. This election is going to be very tough. We have good candidates in our marginal seats, both the ones we hold and the ones we don't hold. But every seat is going to be quite a battle and I'll leave the hubris to my opponent. Thank you.</p>
