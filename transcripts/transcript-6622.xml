TRANSCRIPT OF PRIME MINISTER'S PRESS CONFERENCE 22 APRIL 1985<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
PM: The Cabinet today endorsed the decision of the Expenditure<br />
Review Committee to the effect that a major statement will<br />
be made in the Parliament in May indicating a cut of at least<br />
$ 1 billion in 1985-86 Commonwealth Government outlays. I<br />
can put this in the simplest possible terms. This community<br />
can not simply go on running up debts and living beyond its<br />
means. This is a position which we realised as soon. as we<br />
came to Government and saw the excessively large deficits<br />
that we inherited from the previous Government. From day<br />
one we moved to cut government expenditures in a way which<br />
would enable the deficit to be brought down.. We intend to<br />
continue to do this and the expenditure cuts that we are<br />
making are deliberate. They mean that policies that'are<br />
under'way now will either in some areas-: be eliminated or<br />
curtailed so that this community will now and into thefuture<br />
have a better opportunity aski say of living according<br />
to its means and ensuring that the significant economic<br />
recovery that has been initiated under the policies of my<br />
Government will be continued. I don't go into details of<br />
these expenditure cuts now except to say that we hay been.<br />
guided in our considerations by the criteria of effici--cy<br />
and equity. But it is certain now that with the recovery<br />
that has been initiated under our policies which see he<br />
private sector recovering and providing' 75% of the increase<br />
of the new jobs that are taking place now, that it is important<br />
that the Government by its actions does not crowd the<br />
capital market, does not impose by unnecessarily high deficits<br />
additional pressures on interest rates. It is this sort of<br />
policy, these sorts of policies, which mean that the futura<br />
welfare of all Australian citizens will be advanced. And * we<br />
are committed to that policy.<br />
JOURNALIST: How have we been living beyond our means?<br />
PM: It is fairly simple. You can't have a situation whera<br />
year after year you are running deficits in billions of<br />
terms. VWhen we came in, we looked at thL inheritancc c. a<br />
$ 9. G billion deficit. No,, what that rmeans is that<br />
keep on doing that, you are going to be putting unbe. rable<br />
strains on the capital markets, the private. sector i, not<br />
going to be able to obtain funds for its expansion at<br />
PriMME </p>
<p>PM. , cant: . reasonable costs, costs that they will regard<br />
as Gconomically viable. And that is why we have in our<br />
first budget, we were not prepared to accept that figure<br />
of 9.6, we brought it down to a cohsiderably lower figure,<br />
8.4, and going for a much lower figure now. And in this<br />
way we will combine the degree of stimulus that is required<br />
from the public sector but at the-same time allow the private<br />
sector to go about its business of expansion and job provision.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, how much blame must the trade union<br />
movement.. PM: I am pointing up here at Michelle.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, when you talk about a cut of at least<br />
$ 1 billion in outlays, a cut from what, presumably the forward<br />
estimates. PM: The answer to that is simple. It represents a cut of<br />
a $ 1 billion in the 85-86 year from what would have been the<br />
case if we had in 85-86 continued the policies operating in<br />
84-85.<br />
JOURNALIST: And will you release those forward estimates?<br />
PM: Well, forward estimates are not there in a releasable<br />
form because what is happening is that we undertook the<br />
expenditure review exercise early in this year. You know<br />
that we accelerated the budget program and de liberately<br />
did it on this occasion and so in that proce'ss you had<br />
actual decisions being taken that would have' affected those<br />
estimates. of course the other thing which has affected the<br />
forward estimates is the whole volatility of the currency.<br />
And so the simplest way and the accurate way of putting what<br />
we are about is that,. put it this, ' a ; a that in respect of<br />
forward that would have existed before we * Undertook the<br />
expenditure review process, these decisions that we are<br />
taking represent a cut of at least a billion dollars.<br />
JOURNALIST: how do you know..<br />
PM: We have got the figures. We know what the on-going<br />
costs would have been. What I am saying to you is that at<br />
the same time as those would have been prepared and perhaps<br />
as a government engaged in the outlay cutting exercise and<br />
the easiest and the accurate way of putting it is to say that<br />
if there had been no decision by the Government to cut down.<br />
on programs then in 1985-86 the community would have been<br />
facing outlays of a billion dollars more than we have taken<br />
now. In other words, by these decisions we have either<br />
eliminated or cut back on policies currently operating.<br />
And we have done that to the tune of at least a billion<br />
dollars. JOURNALIST: an aggregate expenditure figure at the<br />
Ministers' meeting last Friday, Mr Hawke, can you tell us<br />
what that was?<br />
PM: No I am not going through what happened in the full<br />
Ministry. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: I think what you are arguing here is that the<br />
Government would be reducing tne deficit, not just through<br />
extra revenue, but also through a very tough attitude towards<br />
spending proposals. I wonder if, in this context, you could<br />
perhaps go a bit further and perhaps tell us what sort of<br />
spending increase in real terms, we are looking towards in<br />
the next financial year given that the Expenditure Review<br />
Committee has now concluded most of its work.<br />
PM: Well there is still more work to be done. We will be<br />
trying to keep that increase in real terms to the lowest<br />
possible figure and clearly the slicing off of a billion<br />
dollars, will be at least a billion dollars, will be<br />
significant of achieving that objective.<br />
JOURNALIST: I just wonder in general terms if you<br />
can put a figure on it.<br />
PM: I don't want to put a figure on it at this stage but<br />
we are, but let me say this, we are determined to give<br />
effect to the trilogy and within the trilogy that reduction<br />
in significant money terms of the deficit in 1985-86 from<br />
the deficit level of this year and we are therefore, as you<br />
will appreciated, not in a position where we are going to<br />
be able to achieve that objective by just going down the<br />
revenue route. And, by definition, if you say, if you<br />
make the commitment that you are going to retain, restrain<br />
your movements in revenues so that there is no increase<br />
in tax as a proportion of GNP, then you are constrained<br />
by going down that route. You have got to if you are going<br />
to achieve the trilogy result, exercise very considerable<br />
restraint on the expenditure result. And this is what this<br />
exerc ise is about. But I don'It want to * give you the exact<br />
figure now. All I want to emphasise as* I do in the statement<br />
that the triology will be achieved.<br />
JOURNALIST: You were trying to get, the deficit-for next<br />
year down to, I think, around about 6 billion&gt;*' C an we say<br />
that you are aiming for something. considerably. less than<br />
than. ARe you looking at 5 billion now, or what?<br />
PM: I don't know what you are looking, * all I can say is that<br />
we have never said unequivocally a particular figure. But we<br />
have said that we want to get,.. not want to but will get the<br />
deficit down in money terms in 85-86 significantly beneath<br />
what it is this year. Now we will be doing that and we will<br />
be without question be achieving that this year and creating<br />
the basis for the achievement of the trilogy through the three<br />
years of the government as I have promised we would do.<br />
JOURNALIST: Can you give us any estimate of the extra<br />
revenue which will accrue to the Government next financial<br />
year devaluation?<br />
PM: No, Paul, we can't. All that we say, and that is the point<br />
of that part of the statement is to say that the best evida. nce<br />
that we have got now is tliat in not terms there will be maore<br />
revenue than additional costs. And I am making the undertaking<br />
that that will not be used to finance new programs. It will<br />
be used either further to reduce the deficit or to reduce<br />
taxes or charges. I simply don't know, I haven't been<br />
given a specific estimate of what that net outcome is </p>
<p>PM, cont: likely to be.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, given that the federal deficit<br />
is roughly half the overall national deficit, will you as<br />
part of this belt-tightening process be looking to the states<br />
and local governments to make cuts of a similar magnitude.<br />
PM: Well, the statement makes it clear that what we are doing<br />
here is quite independent of the federal/ state relationship.<br />
We will obviously be expecting a stringency on the part of the<br />
states because, you will appreciated that on the last occasion,<br />
we adopted both in regard to the grants to the states and the<br />
we handle that and also in regard to states' borrowings. An<br />
approach which recognised that what happened in the area of<br />
the states' budgets and borrowing program was relevant to the<br />
total macroeconomic situation. We will be expecting from the<br />
states their cooperation to achieve what is necessary for the<br />
economic welfare of Australia as a whole. You can'It have a<br />
strigency on the part of the Commonwealth and profligacy on the<br />
part of the states.<br />
JOURNALIST: What is the Government's attitude to discounting<br />
the inflation effects of the latest CPI, it is suggestL-ed it<br />
might be .4 of 1 per cent, over the next few quarters?<br />
PM: Well I have made it clear in the Parliament and elsewhere<br />
the approach that the Government will take in regard to<br />
devaluation. We are not going to allow the results, the<br />
advantages of the devaluation to be dissipated. And the<br />
Government will take the appropriate action which is necessary.<br />
I have made itclear on a number of occasions that it-is too<br />
early now in April to be talking about something that arises<br />
in the first place, minimally in September, more substantially<br />
of course 12 months away from now. don'~ t handle economic<br />
policy in that way.<br />
JOURNALIST: Is it fair to say that you will'no~ i be looking<br />
at deficit for 85-86 than you had intended before<br />
you had decided to make your expenditure cuts in May?<br />
PM: Well, the thing that is constant Mike is that we want<br />
to make the cut as substantial as we can. What is complicated<br />
the picture now is the devaluation effects. We just don't<br />
know at this stage what sort of allowances we are going<br />
to have to make for that. Although I have indicated<br />
that on balance the effect of that should be to. provide<br />
more flexibility for the Government. The question will be<br />
as we say in the statement whether you do that on the aspect<br />
of even further reducing the deficit or perhaps in other ways<br />
which will be beneficial to maintaining the strength of economic<br />
recovery.. But I don't think anything that has happened which<br />
would be make us be looking at a lesser reduction in the<br />
deficit, if I can put it that way. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: But don't you leave yourself open to a charge of<br />
window dressing if you're not prepared to make any sort of<br />
commitment on the figures for the next financial year?<br />
PM: We certainly don't leave ourselves open to window dressing.<br />
There's just absolutely no basis for that. We're making the<br />
substantial decisions now and we are going to make sure that<br />
we get the full year effect of these decisions. We're going to<br />
be doing everything we can to put ourselves in a position and<br />
make the most substantial cut in the deficit we possibly can.<br />
There's no question of window dressing. We're making the decisions<br />
There'll be legislation involved. We're doing everything we<br />
possibly can to put ourselves in the strongest position to make<br />
the most substantial cut in the deficit.<br />
JOURNALIST: When it comes to your of the devaluation are<br />
in fact retained, obviously you have got to do that to wages<br />
policy, budgetary policy or monetary policy. When it ccmn2s<br />
to the latter, you wouldn't shirk would you from a general increase<br />
in the level of interest rates if that in fact was need to achieve<br />
that policy objective.<br />
PM: Well, I think the record of this Government has shown that<br />
we will not shirk from any decisions that need to be taken to<br />
produce positive economic results. We've done that fairly<br />
consistently and we've done a broad range of things which our<br />
predecessors were never prepared to do to produce the<br />
appropriate ec'onomic results. So I rely on the-. record there<br />
to say -that in the circumstances with which this Government<br />
is faced, we'll make those decisions which are necessary to<br />
sustain economic recovery. And I make no exclusions or<br />
exceptions-in regard to that.<br />
JOURNALIST: In the Budget will we see follow, up expenditure<br />
cuts ~ of the same order?<br />
PM: the same order. But I make it clear that this is not<br />
an exclusive list of what will be done by the Government.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, you could well find that the effect<br />
of the devaluation on budget revenues could result in you taking<br />
certain actions breaching the trilogy commitment in relation<br />
to taxation. If you find that you have that spill-over in<br />
relation to that trilogy commitment will all of the spill-over<br />
be given back in the form of say tax cuts, or would you consider<br />
the option of marginally breaching that trilogy commitment in order<br />
to further reduce the deficit?<br />
PM: We will not be breaching the trilogy and I make in response<br />
to that question the answer that I've given before. It just does<br />
not make sense at this point to say precisely what action you'll<br />
take for some point a long way down the line. What does r'-11ke<br />
sense now, and this is why we've made the decision that W3havtoday<br />
endorsing the ERC decision, . is that it does make senSe now<br />
to give notice of the fact that you are goin4 to be moving<br />
substantially and early to make those decisions which are </p>
<p>going to be for the economic benefit of the country. That's<br />
why we've made this announcement now, but it doesn't make<br />
sense to go to a detailed answer now as to the sort of<br />
alternative choices you may make later on down the track to<br />
give effect to the broad commitments that you've made now.<br />
What the community and the business community of Australia<br />
needs to know is that we intend to keep to the trilogy<br />
commitment. And I repeat, we're going to adhere to that<br />
commitment.<br />

PM: Well you certainly can, but I don't want to go back and<br />
forth from Canberra to Coburg, if I can put it that way. So<br />
we could we deal with Canberra<br />
JOURNALIST: The statements that you make in May, as well as<br />
details of the spending cuts program by program, will presumably<br />
give us the full year cost before the cut was made. And at the<br />
same time will you be free then to give us fresh, up-to-date,<br />
forward estimates for the Government's whole spending progr. n<br />
PM: Well I don't want to today give a commitment in regard<br />
to the surrounding documentation to the May statement. But that<br />
will be a matter for decision in the Cabinet and it will be<br />
specifically considered by the Cabinet when the Treasurer<br />
returns at the end of this week. And I'll be ina p6sition to<br />
answer that question within the next week or so. I can't<br />
give you a final answer now.<br />
JOURNALIST: But you see what I'm ' driving at. When we get<br />
the May statement we want some context to put a-billion dollars<br />
into.<br />
PM: And I can assure you from what I've said that you 1ihlalv e<br />
no difficulty at all in determining the reality of th.' cuts.<br />
That's what you want to know, and I'm simply saying i vcu' zen<br />
4 a fly on the wall in the ERC Committee and seen the s.: eat and<br />
blood that had gone on, you'd have no doubt about the reality<br />
of the billion dollars, my friend.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, is this statement dependent on the dollar<br />
staying at the low value that the currency's at and whiat effect<br />
would there be if the dollar recovered.<br />
PM: The statement that we will be issuing is not related to<br />
the level of the dollar.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, I was wondering if you could elabo$-<br />
on your comments in. Parliament this afternoon about tL:<br />
summit. Can you give us any more inforanation on when icV* o<br />
be held, how many people might be coming<br />
PM: We'll get to the tax summit. I just want to be vy usualogical<br />
self and go from subject to subject. Have we finishc.<br />
the billion dollars? Now it's Coburg I think next is it? </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: your comments on the re-admission of the unions<br />
and the violence that occurred, and why didn't you make an<br />
appearance. PM: Well the comment about the admission of the four unions<br />
obviously I'm extremely pleased about it because I'm the one<br />
who has been advocating this for a very long time. And I'm glad<br />
to see that the proper principles have now been applied. And that<br />
is that unions who apply to be affiliated are allowed to be<br />
affiliated. And you cannot have discrimination in this<br />
area and it's right and proper that these four unions should<br />
be affiliated, and I welcome the fact that at last they have<br />
been. As to the violence of course, I unequivocally condemn<br />
it and deplore it. And I believe those who are manifestly<br />
responsible for it will be properly judged, not only within<br />
the Party but within the community. And if I am attacked as<br />
I have apparently been by certain elements in the VictL-orian<br />
Party the President, Mr Hartley well, so be it. It's not<br />
the first time they have and I don't imagine I will stiffer in<br />
any way if I'm-the object of their attacks..<br />
JOURNALIST: Who or what sort of people do you think were<br />
responsible for the violence.<br />
PM: Well you had all your media there and there is an<br />
acceptance that it was-one section of the one grouping and<br />
the more extreme element of the Socialist Left Well, they<br />
don't have to have othor. s accusing them. They accept that it<br />
was them. Now, I say no more than that I deplore and absolutely<br />
condemn'that sort of reaction. It will not be accepted within<br />
the Party, and certainly is not acceptable to the community and<br />
properly not acceptable.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister what is your assessment of the<br />
long-term effects of the entry of the unions into the Branch.<br />
Do you think there'll be substantial changes in the next couple<br />
of.. PM: Oh, I think through time, not just in Victoria, I think that<br />
through time the Party will come more the reflect the constituency<br />
out there that votes for it. I believe that with the relatively<br />
small membership of I think of about 56,000 members throughout<br />
Australia in the Party, that that's a very, very small proportion<br />
of that very substantial number of people who vote for the Party.<br />
I think it hasn't been totally reflective of our constituency<br />
who vote for us-and I think this will be part of a gradual<br />
enlargement of the party through time now which will see the<br />
Party more reflecting the constituency that vote for them.<br />
JOURNALIST: Is that the end of the split.<br />
PM: Well, it means that those unions who were in and then<br />
were out, are no,.. w back in. Now i'm obviously embarrassed about<br />
stating the obvious. I think it's the end of that split. If<br />
others who have been in the Party dislike it-that much that they<br />
feel they have to go, well.. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: There's obviously still a lot of bitterness, isn't<br />
there.<br />
PM: That was a reasonable conclusion, I think, to draw from<br />
the events of the weekend.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, will it be better for the Party if they<br />
did go.<br />
PM: Well, I mean really they have to make up their mind. The<br />
Party has made its decision. And if they feel that the Party<br />
has been made something that they don't like and can't accept,<br />
I can assure them that the Party is not going to change its<br />
decision about who's come in. So the Party is going to be of<br />
the kind and character which it is now as a result of that<br />
decision. So if they don't like that, and they think they<br />
can't live with it, well it will have be their decision.<br />
Because the Party is not going to change.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, will you go to the Conference<br />
in Victoria in June.<br />
PM: I think I'll be going, yes.<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you think there's room for some sort of<br />
disciplinary action against the extreme sections of the Party<br />
who were involved in the violence.<br />
PM: Well I haven't addressed my mind to that. If something<br />
is put forward, if someone proposes it, it will have to be<br />
examined. But I've not addressed my mind to it and no-one has<br />
suggested anything to me at this stage.<br />
JOURNALIST: Any further details about the tax summit.<br />
PM: No, no more than I really announced in the Par'liement.<br />
I would think that within about a week the decisions shiould hnave<br />
been made about the invitations. I. just haven't spokE to that<br />
part of our bureaucracy which is addressing itself to that ciustion.<br />
But I think it's something like a week or so that that should<br />
be finalised. And I really can't add anything to wha. a sai. c.<br />
in the Parliament.<br />
JOURNALIST: You are inviting the Opposition, Mr Hawke. Do you<br />
expect them to come and how important would their attendance bc<br />
PM: Well, as I say, it's very hard to tell about these people.<br />
I mean people thought I was being a little bit humourcus when<br />
I talked about this division-ridden Opposition. But t'-ey are.<br />
They're very deeply divided on this and everything else and I<br />
don't know there'll be some who will want to come, others who<br />
won't want to come. And I don't know how they'll pick their<br />
team if they do decide to come, because they've got so nany<br />
different views themselves about what should happen.<br />
I seriously would like the Opposition to be thare, bec.-<br />
I believe that they must havc something useful arid con. I..: c<br />
to say. I hope they will not say to the Australian pcoe<br />
going to be negative, we won't go to the Summit, we'll let crc-. </p>
<p>else'go, and then we'll set off and see how we can score : Doints.<br />
I hope they don't do that because that's not helpful to the<br />
community and, of course, in the long term it wouldn't be<br />
helpful to them. Because I think the community would make a<br />
very adverse judgement about them if they attempted that sort<br />
of approach.<br />
JOURNALIST: How far will the Government be able to go towards<br />
implementing some of the changes from the Summit in the<br />
August Budget.<br />
PM: Oh, I've said before that I would think it would be very<br />
difficult to pick up in the August Budget anything of any<br />
significance from the Summit. For significant changes you<br />
will require changes in legislation and you wouldn't be<br />
able to pick those things up in the Budget. But that's nothing<br />
new, I've said that over a fairly long period now.<br />
JOURNAL IST: Was the principle aim of your statement today to<br />
calm down the money market and re-affirm your economic<br />
credentials. PM: Well I don't think our economic credentials need re-affirminc.<br />
I'll come to the first part of your question because, as much<br />
of the media has been kind enough to point out, the basic<br />
economic statistics that keep coming out are pointing to the<br />
continuing strength of the economy which results from the<br />
impact of the policies of this Government. So ' all the<br />
evidence is there about the basic strength of: the economy and<br />
the credentials of this government in the area of economic<br />
management. I think there are these things to be said about<br />
the timing. The first is to say that we obviously want to<br />
make it clear that we are going to adhere to the econcmic<br />
strategy and the fiscal strategy that P : ul * Keating and I<br />
have consistently outlined and which has been adopted by<br />
the Cabinet and accepted by the Caucus. I and: Mr Keating<br />
outUned that strategy at the end of last year. We have<br />
adhered to it steadfastly and it has been accepted by the<br />
Cabinet and by the Caucus. Now we want to make sure that we<br />
get the full year benefits of the hard decisions that we're<br />
taking and to do that you need to have legislation. And therefore,<br />
you need to make the statement and get the legislation going<br />
in this session so that you will have those full year benefits.<br />
And of course I do believe that the market will also, and I<br />
acknowledge that, the market will appreciate the clear<br />
determination of a Government to pursue these responsible<br />
economic policies which will be evidenced by this statement.<br />
ENDS. </p>
