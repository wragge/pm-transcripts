CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERED<br />
PRIIME MINISTER<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER MR BOB HAWKE<br />
NATIONAL PRESS CLUB<br />
CANBERRA 22 FEBRUARY 1984<br />
I very much appreciate this opportunity to be with you again<br />
today. I understand you are expecting both a review of the<br />
Government's first year in office and a report on my<br />
recently completed visit to North and South-East Asia. My<br />
primary emphasis will necessarily be on reviewing my<br />
Government's period in office, not least because of the<br />
extensive media coverage that my trip received, but I will<br />
touch on aspects of that vi-sit central to the basic thrust<br />
of our policies.<br />
The course we embarked on in March 1983 was one of national<br />
reconciliation, national recovery and national<br />
reconstruction. From the beginning my Government has been clear in its<br />
purpose.<br />
We knew what was wrong.<br />
We knew what had to be done.<br />
Rather than simply reacting to events, the policies that we<br />
have developed and are implementing have been based on a<br />
clear view of where we as a nation should be heading.<br />
We have done more in the past twe lve months to give effect<br />
to basic Lahor principles, policy and Platform than any<br />
previous Labor Government in a comparable period.<br />
This past year has been one of achievement. We have turned<br />
the economy onto a path of strong recovery; a degree of<br />
industrial peace unprecedented for many years now prevails;<br />
far-reaching social reforms have been introduced; and<br />
credibility and respect have been restored to our<br />
international relationships. </p>
<p>The excesses of negative and destructive conflict which had<br />
characterised Australian life in the past were holding back<br />
the achievement of Australia's great potential. They were<br />
sapping our great nation of its essential energies as talent<br />
and ability were side-tracked into the selfish pursuit of<br />
narrow sectional interests. We were a divided nation.<br />
My Government has changed this. A new national consensus<br />
has been forged. We have sought to identify and by the<br />
dissemination of knowledge and information to assist the<br />
community to identify both the areas of conflict which<br />
were artificial, and the areas of common interest and shared<br />
purpose in which agreement was achievable.<br />
This focus on reconciliation and co-operation underpinned<br />
the Prices and Incomes Accord, the National Economic Summit<br />
Conference, the June 1983 Premiers' Conference and provides<br />
the rationale of the Economic Planning Advisory Council. It<br />
was also pivotal to our approach to industrial relations,<br />
and finds concrete expression in the consultative mechanisms<br />
we are putting in place with industry. We are not a<br />
Government who believe we have a monopoly of wisdom, but<br />
have sought to draw on the accumulated wisdom and experience<br />
of the community.<br />
The achievement of our objectives has required restoration<br />
of a strong national economy. We have, therefore, from the<br />
outset, accorded a high priority to this task. In twelve<br />
months we have turned the economy around.<br />
We have laid the basis for continued non-inflationary growth<br />
and increased employment opportunities in the medium and<br />
longer-term.<br />
We have established a coherent and integrated framework for<br />
economic decision making without precerient in Australia.<br />
The results speak for themselves.<br />
When my Government came into office Australia was in the<br />
midst of a-deep recession: employment had declined<br />
disastrously and unemployment had risen to unacceptably high<br />
levels; inflation stood at twice the rate of most major OECD<br />
countries; a negative rate of GDP growth had been recorded<br />
in the previous y'sar, and real wages and through them<br />
living standards were falling.<br />
Through immediate action taken in the 19 M~ ay Economic<br />
Statement, through the August 1983 Budget and helped both<br />
by the breaking of the drought and strong recovery in the<br />
Unite'd States my Government has not only arrested the<br />
decline, but has quite dramatically turned it around. </p>
<p>3.<br />
From the time of the Summit last April to January this year,<br />
seasonally adjusted employment has expanded by over 2 per<br />
, cent and seasonally adjusted unemployment has fallen from<br />
10.3 per cent to 9.5 per cent.<br />
indeed the number of jobs created so far thi~ s financial year<br />
already exceeds the number projected by the Budget for the<br />
whole financial year. We are also ahead of the rate<br />
required to meet our target of 500,000 new jobs in our first<br />
three years in office. Inflation has as well been brought<br />
down from over 11 per cent to 8.6 per cent.<br />
We have achieved these results with expansionary fiscal<br />
policies, and with firm but not tight monetary policies.<br />
Importantly, we have financed the deficit successfully at<br />
the same time as seeing interest rates fall below the levels<br />
which prevailed at the time of the Budget.<br />
But if our immediate priority was to turn the Australian<br />
economy around, we have attached at least equal importance<br />
to securing the requirements of medium and long-term growth.<br />
The perspectives we have brought to bear have given as much<br />
weight to longer-term requirements -as to short-term<br />
imperatives.<br />
Crucial to the maintenance o'f sustained recovery into the<br />
medium and longer term, is continued income restraint.<br />
Restraint of the kind needed has been made possible, and<br />
will hinge in the future, on continued adherence by all<br />
parties to the Prices and Incomes Accord.<br />
Very deliberately my Government has moved to give effect to<br />
its responsibilities under the Accord. The second progress<br />
report of the Advisory Committee on Prices and Incomes on<br />
Government Initiatives, to be released shortly, will<br />
describe a very solid record of achievement.<br />
Let me briefly go Co what has been done already in this<br />
regard, it being understood that the' Accord touches in one<br />
way or another on almost all areas of Government<br />
responsibility.<br />
A centralised wage fixing system is now firmly in place<br />
throughout Australia; legislation establishing the Prices<br />
Surveillance Authority has been passed; taxation<br />
arrangements have been changed; the equity and efficiency of<br />
the taxation system is being discussed within EPAC. As well<br />
. major job creation programs have been introduced, training<br />
schemes developed and social security needs addressed. </p>
<p>A particular area given prominence by the Accord, and for<br />
too long neglected by Governments in the past, is that of<br />
occupational health and safety. The establishment in<br />
October 1983 of an Interim National Occupational Health and<br />
Safety Commission provides the means by which. a major<br />
national effort can now be mounted in this important area.<br />
The other side of the coin is that the Accord has played a<br />
particularly important part in the very significant<br />
improvement in industrial relations which has occurred<br />
during my Government's term in office.<br />
From the outset my Government made clear its commitment to<br />
securing the establishment of an orderly and stable<br />
industrial relations system consistent with our<br />
constitutional practices in Australia.<br />
The Prices and Incomes Accord, the active support we have<br />
given to the creation of tripartite consultative organs at<br />
industry level, and the thorough review of the industrial<br />
relations machinery we have initiated, are al11 part of a<br />
deliberate effort to rid Australia of the costly burden of<br />
continuing industrial strife.<br />
The results already achieved are impres * sive; in the twelve<br />
months to November last year, ' the number of working days<br />
lost through industrial disputes was the lowest in a<br />
comparable period for fifteen years, and nearly 30 per cent<br />
less than for the year ended November 1982.<br />
It is significant that the extent of this improvement in<br />
Australia's industrial relations scene has been recognised<br />
by our major trading parptners in Asia.<br />
While some of them may in the past have exaggerated the<br />
costs associated with industrial action in Australia, I was<br />
left in no doubt in my discussions with Asian leaders on my<br />
recent overseas trip that, in their minds, the improvement<br />
achieved has helped restore confidence in Australia as a<br />
stable, reliable supplier. Equally, I have no doubt that<br />
for many Australians this improvement is a major factor in<br />
their renewed confidence in our economic outlook.<br />
My Government is also directing attention to the structural<br />
conditions necessary to ensure persistent growth in national<br />
productivity, output and employment. As was clearly<br />
evidenced in the Steel Industry Assistance Plan, my<br />
Government is committed to the dual, complementary<br />
objectives of maintaining and increasing employment in the<br />
manufacturing sector and of making Australia more<br />
intetnationally competitive. To the extent we realise these<br />
objectives, Australia as a nation should prosper and our<br />
neighbours will benefit from dealing with us. </p>
<p>Success will hinge on the ability of our nation to adapt to<br />
the rapidly changing world about us. There must be an<br />
imaginative pursuit of available opportunities for securing<br />
our medium and longer-term growth prospects and increasing<br />
employment. Steps should include a return to a position of<br />
increased competitiveness in the changing world.<br />
In a speech in Osaka on 3 February which picked up themes of<br />
earlier statements, I referred to the need to develop in<br />
Australia long-term programs aimed at facilitating<br />
structural change and developing strong, efficient and<br />
competitive Australian industries. The reaction of<br />
interested parties and of the media to these views was<br />
generally very encouraging.<br />
The reaction suggested to me that we have'passed the point<br />
where we need to argue the case as I have long done for<br />
Australia not only to accept such change, but to find ways<br />
of turning it to our advantage. There is, I believe, now a<br />
widespread community recognition of the need for gradual<br />
change in Australia's industry structures.<br />
What as a Government we will now be doing is putting in<br />
place consultative processes regarding the framework within<br />
which such change can occur., including through the provision<br />
of a more adequate data base on macroeconomic and industry<br />
trends. Changes in our industry structures cannot and will<br />
not be superimposed by Government. We are not in the<br />
business of picking winners and losers. But we will do<br />
everything we can to provide a more comprehensive and<br />
predictable framework for decision making by industry, and<br />
will assist directly through working to develop a more<br />
flexible and skilled workforce.<br />
My Government's aim in considering industry adjustment is to<br />
promote increased and assured emplo-yment in growing and<br />
viable industries. Adjustment properly undertaken and<br />
managed in an intecirated way is entirely consistent with,<br />
and in the modern world essential to, rising living<br />
standards. This has been an important aspect of rapid<br />
development in Japan and in those other countries in our<br />
region which have experienced strong growth.<br />
The issues associated with structural change are at the<br />
heart of this Government's agenda and can he expected to<br />
continue receiving our closest attention.<br />
As a Government we have moved also to establish the basis<br />
* for greater equality in the nation's social and economic<br />
fabric. While recognising the need for changes in work<br />
patterns, industrial structures and patterns of trade, we<br />
are acutely aware of the simultaneous need for deliberate<br />
measures to ensure that these changes do not reduce groups<br />
of Australians to a permanently marqinal position in our </p>
<p>society. While recognising the importance of individual<br />
initiative, and wanting to do everything we can to encourage<br />
it, my Government is at the same time committed to securing<br />
for all our people fairer shares of the nations wealth and a<br />
larger measure of genuine equality.<br />
This dimension to our policies is apparent in a wide range<br />
of areas. Some examples are the Community Employment<br />
Program, the vast expansion of the public housing program,<br />
the highly successful First Home Owners Scheme, and the<br />
assistance extended to the young unemployed and children of<br />
pensioners. Other steps include measures aimed at<br />
redirecting social security benefits to those who need them,<br />
the abolition of more blatant tax concessions and<br />
inequities, our attack on tax avoidance to the extent we<br />
have not been frustrated by a Senate ignoring the wishes of<br />
an overwhelming majority of the Australian people and our<br />
deliberate moves to promote real equality of opportunity<br />
regardless of sex, race or ethnic background. All these<br />
measures together constitute a major and concentrated drive<br />
to establish Australia as a fairer and more equitable<br />
society. In that drive we have directed considerable attention to the<br />
situation of our Aboriginal people. We have substantially<br />
boosted Commonwealth Government funding for aboriginal<br />
advancement programs. We aim to reverse a situation in<br />
which the lot of too many of our aboriginal people is one of<br />
constant denegration and contempt, grinding poverty, fear,<br />
helplessness and apathy.<br />
Similarly the initiatives we have mounted to eliminate sex<br />
discrimination constitute an important element in our<br />
overall interest in securing a more just and equitable<br />
Australian society. Among the significant achievements of<br />
my Government is the progress it has made in raising the<br />
status of women. The full details of our approach I spelt<br />
out recently at the National Labor Women's Conference in<br />
Adelaide. The introduction of Medicare is another landmark in the<br />
history of my Government.<br />
Every Australian is now covered for 85% of the schedule fee<br />
in respect of all services provided by doctors and<br />
specialists. In times of acute illness every Australian can<br />
now receive free hospital treatment. With Medicare we now<br />
have a stable system which provides everyone with cover at a<br />
fair cost.<br />
Similarly in education, the policies and initiatives we have<br />
introduced in the last year are aimed at increasing<br />
opportunities for all Australians to develop, on an<br />
equitable basis, their full potential. </p>
<p>My Government' believes strongly that as a nation we must be<br />
prepared to invest heavily in human skills. Only if we<br />
equip our people with the capacities and attitudes to<br />
compete effectively, with flexibility and with confidence,<br />
can we make the most of future opportunities.<br />
Training the workforce to maximise the benefits for<br />
themselves and for our society of new, more productive<br />
technologies is of fundamental importance. As a Government<br />
we are giving urgent attention to the creation of a base of<br />
skills across the whole workforce through education and<br />
training of our young people, at the same time as seeking to<br />
ensure an adequate retraining of the existing workforce to<br />
handle these new technologies more capably.<br />
The provision of financial assistance to enable diversity of<br />
educational opportunity is an integral part of my<br />
Government's education policy approach. Such assistance is<br />
provided with due regard both to the principle of equality<br />
of educational opportunity, and the principle of need as<br />
defined in close consultation with interested parties.<br />
The Government is committed to supporting all those schools<br />
most in need with the limited additional resources it is<br />
able to make available. Somehow or other the gap between<br />
low resource schools and other schools has to be reduced.<br />
This year my Government is giving more money to<br />
non-government schools than any Government before it. The<br />
fact is that in 1984 the neediest non-government schools,<br />
and that includes more than 90 per cent of all<br />
non-government schools, will receive higher Commonwealth<br />
Grants in real terms tlian before.<br />
Arrangements for 1985 and beyond are not yet settled. The<br />
Government has asked the Schools Commission to provide<br />
advice and options on a new arrangements for non-government<br />
school general resources funding. No new arrangements will<br />
be implemented witfiout the fullest possible consultations<br />
with non-government schools, and I give a guarantee that I<br />
will be fully involved in this process. I will not only be<br />
interested in seeing that all views are heard but, with<br />
Senator Susan Ryan, will aim to ensure that the Gov'ernment's<br />
objectives in this area are carried forward in so equitable<br />
a fashion that they have the full support of the interested<br />
parties.<br />
When we talk of education we naturally thin' of the young.<br />
One of the most difficult and necessary issues we as a<br />
Government have to face in the medium and longer term is how<br />
to handle the aging of our population in a fair and<br />
equitable way. </p>
<p>We have taken steps to tackle this issue but I am prepared<br />
to say that we have not been as successful as we should have<br />
been. A year ago I conceded that our Government., like any other,<br />
would make mistakes. At that time I added that I hoped one<br />
of the distinguishing features of our Government would be<br />
that we would have the courage to admit errors and face the<br />
responsibility of correcting them.<br />
It has become clear that there is continuing and justifiable<br />
uncertainty about whether the Government has yet found the<br />
best way to implement legislation on an assets test mna<br />
fair and equitable way.<br />
My senior Ministers and I remain absolutel. y wedded to the<br />
principle that the majority those who genuinely need<br />
Government support through the pension receive it, and<br />
that the claims of those like ex-Prime Ministers who do<br />
not need it, do not continue to limit the Government's<br />
capacity to help the truly needy.<br />
However, we have also become concerned that many ordinary<br />
pensioners have been caused unnecessary worry by those who,<br />
for short-sighted political purposes, have encouraged<br />
groundless fears about our intentions.<br />
I concede that as a Government we have not been able to<br />
allay those fears. There is no way that we will allow these<br />
people the people who during their working lives<br />
contributed to building Australia into the great country it<br />
is today to be worried and alarmed about their future.<br />
After consulting with some senior Ministers I have decided<br />
that the whole question must be looked at again.<br />
Cabinet will review this matter tomorrow. I expect<br />
following that consideration to be able to announce details<br />
of an alternative,-more acceptable approach.<br />
The task my Government has begun is one not only of shaping<br />
an Australia which will be well placed to Sustain growth in<br />
the medium and longer-term. It is also one of sharing the<br />
benefits of such growth equitably and of maintaining a<br />
credible standing in the international community.<br />
A sound foreign policy is obviously important to securing<br />
these objectives.<br />
My Government has made clear from the beginning its<br />
commiitment to its alliance relationships. Australia is an<br />
aligned nation and we regard this as being fundamental to<br />
the conduct of our international relations. </p>
<p>On this basis, and bringing to bear a healthy independence<br />
of view, Australia's relationship with the United States has<br />
been consolidated into a mature, multifaceted and beneficial<br />
partnership. This represents a logical progression of the<br />
foundational Australia/ United States relationship forged by<br />
Labor Prime Minister John Curtin. That relationship is now<br />
stronger than ever before.<br />
At the same time, while we do not seek to disguise<br />
fun'damental differences of outlook and strategic interest,<br />
we have moved to put Australia's relations with the Soviet<br />
Union on a more productive footing. Paul Keating's recent<br />
visit to Moscow was important in this regard not only was<br />
he able to indicate our interest in constructive dialogue<br />
with the Soviets in multilateral disarmament fora, he was<br />
also able to register clearly with the Soviet leadership our<br />
readiness to seek further opportunities for practical<br />
co-operation with the Soviet Union.<br />
Relations with the countries of the Asia/ Pacific region must<br />
obviously command the highest priority for Australia. I<br />
said this immediately after assuming office; others had said<br />
it before me. I suggest the difference is that over the<br />
last twelve months my Government has succeeded in giving<br />
real substance to the character of Australia's involvement<br />
with the region.<br />
This reflects the very substantive character of the<br />
political, strategic and economic issues that my Government<br />
has been prepared to address with the countries of the area,<br />
and the unprecedently cordial terms on which these<br />
disucssions have proceeded.<br />
As a Government we have been concerned to promote conditions<br />
of regional peace and stability, and in particular we have<br />
actively explored with interested parties the scope for<br />
progress in the Kampuchean situation. The spontaneous<br />
commendation of our efforts by Premier Zhao and Prime<br />
Minister Lee duringj our recent discussions indicate that our<br />
efforts are of value and are appreciated by the countries in<br />
our region.<br />
My Government's ability to address openly and constructively<br />
differences where they exist has contributed significantly<br />
to respect for Australia's role in the region. The<br />
Australian electorate will match this reality against the<br />
base and baseless opportunism of our political opponents in<br />
their claims that in pursuing this approach we were<br />
endangering our relations with the region. The truth is<br />
that these relations are now stronger than they have ever<br />
been before. </p>
<p>The reaction on my overseas trip to my 22 November Bangkok<br />
trade initiative suggest that this has also struck a<br />
responsive chord with the countries of the! region. All the<br />
regional countries we have approached, including all of the<br />
Asean countries, have now agreed to participate in a senior<br />
officials' meeting to be convened i~ n April in an Asean<br />
country, to help identify regional countries' interests in a<br />
proposed multilateral trade liberalisation round. The<br />
meeting would also consider how best to focus attention on<br />
those interests in such a round. For Australia our<br />
interests would include subsidies and non-tariff barriers to<br />
trade, especially in agriculture and processed minerals.<br />
Closely linked with this effort to secure an international<br />
trading environment more satisfactory to the countries of<br />
the region, has been the deliberate effort we have made to<br />
put Australia's bilateral trading relations with individual<br />
countries of the region onto a sounder, long-term footing.<br />
As a result of rapid economic development throughout the<br />
region, quite fundamental structural changes are taking<br />
place within the countries of the area.<br />
This has major implications for the character and direction<br />
of Australia's regional trade. In established markets it<br />
makes diversification of our trading interests a compelling<br />
necessity. Elsewhere, high growth opportunities and new<br />
markets are opening up.<br />
In each of the countries I recently visited Japan, Korea,<br />
China, Singapore and Malaysia the speed and extent of<br />
change are considerable. Australians must understand the<br />
full dimensions of what . is happening and move effectively to<br />
relate our productive capacities to these dynamic and<br />
challenging developments.<br />
For example, the interest that Premier Zhao demonstrated in<br />
the integration of -the iron and steel industries of<br />
Australia and China through programs of mutual investment,<br />
technical assistance and the supply of Australian raw<br />
materials and semi-processed products to China's mills is<br />
indicative of the scale of possibilities which exist.<br />
Indeed the importance of what is happening in China is too<br />
rarely appreciated. I am convinced that the fundamental<br />
changes taking place in China today, in its economic<br />
philosophy and practices, hold major implications for all<br />
countries. Australia, as a country now enjoying a<br />
particularly close relationship with China, is well placed<br />
to work together with it to our Mutual advantage.<br />
Australia's regional relationships have been nurtured in the<br />
context of an overriding desire for global peace and<br />
stability. </p>
<p>At a time when the world has entered an era of heightened<br />
distrust and suspicion between the super-powers, my<br />
Government's commitment to securing progress in arms control<br />
and disarmament has taken on a particular significance.<br />
Every available opportunity has been taken to press the case<br />
for agreements that might preserve the strategic balance and<br />
secure deterrence at the lowest possible l. evel of armaments.<br />
This has included our discussions with the super-powers,<br />
with the other nuclear powers China, France and the United<br />
Kingdom, and with the international community more generally<br />
including at the CHOGM.<br />
My Government, and our Ambassador for Disarmament, have been<br />
working especially hard for the revitalization of the<br />
international non-proliferation regime and for the creation<br />
of an international climate that could lead to agreement on<br />
a comprehensive and fully verifiable ban on nuclear testing.<br />
A convention to ban chemical weapons and an agreement to<br />
prevent the arms race from extending to outer space are also<br />
high among our priorities.<br />
We were recently very encouraged by the adoption at the<br />
United Nations General Assembly of the Australia/ New Zealand<br />
resolution calling for negotiations to commence on a<br />
comprehensive test ban treaty.<br />
That the United States was persuaded to move from its<br />
previous year's negative vote to abstention was a<br />
significant development a development we appreciated and<br />
now intend building on.<br />
We shall also continue to lay great emphasis on the risks<br />
not only of vertical but also horizontal proliferation of<br />
nuclear weapons.<br />
As a producer and exporter of uranium we see ourselves as<br />
having particular responsibilities in this regard.<br />
More specifically,-Australia has an obligation under Article<br />
IV of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation-Treaty to facilitate and<br />
participate in the exchange of equipment, materials and<br />
information for the peaceful uses of atomic energy, with due<br />
consideration for the needs of the developing areas of the<br />
world. Acceptance of this obligation serves to accentuate the<br />
particular responsibility we have to secure improved<br />
international safeguards against diversion of nuclear<br />
materials from peaceful uses.<br />
We take this latter responsibility seriously and are<br />
unflinching in our commitment to the demands it imposes. In<br />
this, we believe we are contributing within our capacities<br />
to a better world. </p>
<p>I Z<br />
The challenges of the year ahead are not to be<br />
underestimated. The main challenge is to keep the economy moving in the<br />
right direction.<br />
This will involve maintaining continued progress in the<br />
positive trends in the principal economic indicators that<br />
is, employment and unemployment, economic growth, inflation<br />
and interest rates. This is no simple task. But the<br />
prospects are good and it can be said with certainty that<br />
there will be no return to the sustained, simultaneous high<br />
unemployment and inflation levels that characterised the<br />
economy during the period of my predecessors.<br />
Another key challenge will be to continue progress towards a<br />
manufacturing sector that is viable and competitive and<br />
contributes directly to strong growth in employment.<br />
To this end my Government will be stepping up its process of<br />
consultation with the manufacturing sector and seeking wider<br />
community understanding of the issues involved. In this way<br />
it should be possible to contemplate in the longer run<br />
structural changes that are understood by all to be in the<br />
community's broader interest.<br />
Finally, 1984 should be a year in which recovery depends<br />
less directly on the Government sector, and is carried more<br />
by the private sector. As I have said many times, we<br />
recognise the vital role in our economy of the private<br />
sector where more than three quarters of the work force are<br />
employed. Quite deliberately many of the Government's<br />
decisions have been aimed at providing a basis for healthy<br />
growth in the private sector. Let me give you two examples.<br />
First, the Government's own borrowing strategy has been<br />
geared to allowing substantial private borrowing in the<br />
second half of the current financial year, to meet seasonal<br />
as well as longer-term investment needs. Later in the year,<br />
in our 1984/ 85 Budget, we will be seeking to make further<br />
progress in reducing the deficit thus ensuring that<br />
interest rate pressures do not re-emerge with their negative<br />
impact on growth while providing some tax relief. Second<br />
ours is not an approach which seeks regulation for the sake<br />
of regulation. Only where regulatory approaches clearly<br />
promote economic efficiency or social equity will they be<br />
considered by our Government.<br />
I recognise that some of the decisions we have taken have<br />
not and will not win universal acclaim, at least not until<br />
the results are in. But frankly I am not prepared just to<br />
sit on the popularity ratings my Government now enjoys. I<br />
do not want to fritter away the opportunities this measure<br />
of community support provides to move this country in<br />
directions which almost all objective observers agree are<br />
vital for our future we ll-being and that of our children. </p>
<p>13.<br />
1983 was a year in which I along with most Australians took<br />
pride in a number of great sporting achievements. The task<br />
, we all have now, I would suggest, is to harness that same<br />
focus of national interest and enthusiasm to those other<br />
issues of national significance which too often in the past<br />
have been determined exclusively by narrowly-based<br />
