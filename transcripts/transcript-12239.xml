    <content><![CDATA[<p>I announce today that the Coalition will provide $80 million over four years in new funding to support Australiaâs 2.3 million carers, with special attention being given to carers of people with dementia and ageing carers of people with disabilities.</p>
<p>The Coalition's election commitments to providing more resources for residential and community care now exceed half a billion dollars following today's announcement.</p>

<p>The $80 million Carers Package is a recognition of the significant contribution made by Australia's 2.3 million carers.</p>
