<p>E &amp; OE.........................</p>
<p>Good morning ladies and gentlemen. This is an inaugural exercise for me. It's theÂ fourteenth meeting of the Prime Minister's Science and Engineering Council but it is ofÂ course the first such meeting to occur since the change of government in March andÂ therefore it's the first meeting that I and my Ministerial colleagues, in particularly theÂ Minister for Science and Technology Peter McGauran but also attended by a numberÂ of other ministers, including the Minister for Primary Industry and later on thisÂ afternoon, the Minister for Schools and Education. And it's also attended by a veryÂ large number, I think some 14 in number of Coalition Members and Senators.</p>
<p>IÂ would also like to extend aspecial welcome to anumber of people who are attendingÂ their first meeting today Professor John De Laeter of the Curtin University ofÂ Technology, Professor Fay Gale, President of the Australian Vice ChancellorsÂ Committee and Dr Joe Baker, President of the Federation of Australian Scientific andÂ Technological Societies. I do have an apology from John Moore, the Minister forÂ Industry, Science and Tourism and one of the Council Members, Dr Ed Tweddell.</p>
<p>I would like to in front of an invited audience make the point that this is the first timeÂ that the Prime Minister's Science and Engineering Council has invited Members ofÂ Parliament, the media and interested scientists and others to observe part of the councilÂ meeting. We want to broaden community understanding of the work of the council,Â and through that emphasise the importance that the members of the council and also ofÂ course the Government, and the Prime Minister in particular, and the Ministers also inÂ particular, place on the work of the Council and quite a deal of the areas of discussionÂ that will be in the opening session to which members of the public and the media haveÂ been invited touch upon subjects that are important to contemporary scientific andÂ political debate and through that I hope we can broaden in a small way communityÂ understanding of the work of the council and the role that science and technology doesÂ play in everyday life and how important it is to the solution of ongoing nationalÂ problems. I do hope that the guests who are here today as part of that new approachÂ find something of value and something of enjoyment from the proceedings.</p>
<p>I believe that the new Government, through both its policy statement on science andÂ technology and engineering and its actions in the recent budget has shown a strongÂ commitment to supporting science and technology. It has provided generously in theÂ budget for assistance to our best researches through increased funding for theÂ Australian Research Council and the National Health and Medical Research Council.Â Additional funds have been provided to research infrastructure. That's $ 90 millionÂ over three years and research training, $ 9.3 million over three years for 100 additionalÂ post graduate research scholarships.</p>
<p>Research industry interaction was subsequently boosted through extra resources forÂ the Co-operative Research Centre's program. While the extent of application and theÂ level of the industrial research and the development tax concessions have beenÂ reduced, we believe that the concession still remains generous in comparison withÂ those of other OECD nations and the new R D start program introduced in theÂ budget will provide attractive project based packages of very considerable help toÂ Australian industry.</p>
<p>This morning's agenda items will deal with, firstly ways for science and technology inÂ managing Australia's inland waters and presentations by two active scientists on theirÂ areas of research. The afternoon session will involve a presentation on a current studyÂ by the Australian Science, Technology and Engineering Council on primary schoolÂ science and technology, and presentations from the major science and technologyÂ representative bodies on key issues confronting Australian science and technology.Â The agenda papers for today's meeting will be published including on the Internet. IÂ will draw members' attention to the minutes of the last meeting held Â on the 8th ofÂ December last year which are the members' agenda papers.</p>
<p>We now move, ladies and gentlemen, to our first presentation for the morning which isÂ called Managing Australia ' s Inland Waters Roles For Science and Technology. ThisÂ is an important topic as the sustainable use of our natural resources is vital to ourÂ future. In Australia, in particular, proper management of our water resources is criticalÂ to sustaining agriculture, the environment and even human health. The Coalition'sÂ proposal about which much has been written and said to establish the Natural HeritageÂ Trust of Australia into which will be paid, continuant on the sale of one third ofÂ Telstra, $ 1 billion to establish a fund in perpetuity for major environmental works is, inÂ part, a recognition of the thrust of various Science Council work on sustaining theÂ agricultural resource base.</p>
<p>Today's session on waterwork resources will add to our understanding of the naturalÂ resource which is important to us all. The presentations will focus on the MurrayÂ Darling Basin and the Great Artesian Basin. There will be three speakers to begin withÂ and they will be followed by discussion. I would now, ladies and gentlemen, like toÂ ask Professor John Murray, the President of the Murray Darling Basin Commission, toÂ lead off the presentations and introduce the other speakers. But before asking him toÂ the microphone, may I say to all of you, for me, this is a new experience. It is aÂ privilege as Prime Minister to chair a body that is so directly concerned about planningÂ for the long term future of the country a body which is so directly responsible forÂ giving high quality advice to the Government and to the community generally aboutÂ matters that will affect the way in which we live in this country, the extent to which weÂ are mature and responsible enough to husband the resources given to us by nature andÂ whether we are to strike that often elusive balance between protecting and nurturingÂ our natural environment, but at the same time allowing for proper and progressiveÂ economic development which is also important to the future quality of the lives that weÂ live.</p>
<p>But ladies and gentlemen, I invite Professor Laver to open discussion on the first of theÂ agenda items. Thank you very much.</p>
