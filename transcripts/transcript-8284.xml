JOINT STATEMENT WITH THE MINISTER ASSISTING THE<br />
PRIME MINISTER FOR THE STATUS OF WOMEN, WENDY FATIN<br />
Tomorrow is National Stop Domestic Violence Day.<br />
The development of a national strategy for the elimination<br />
of violence against women was endorsed recently by the<br />
inaugural meeting of the Commonwealth-State Ministers'<br />
Conference on the Status of Women.<br />
The national strategy will be developed by the National<br />
Committee on Violence Against Women, established late last<br />
year to carry, out research and develop recommendations for<br />
new policies and programs aimed at eliminating violence<br />
against women.<br />
April 26 has again been proclaimed National Stop Domestic<br />
Violence Day to remind all Australians that domestic<br />
violence is a. crime and is unacceptable.<br />
This Government will continue to reinforce the message that<br />
domestic violence cannot be tolerated.<br />
Violence perpetrated against women inside and outside the<br />
home has been. witnessed in frightening proportions in this<br />
country and around the world.<br />
The development of a national strategy will provide a<br />
comprehensive and coordinated framework for eliminating<br />
violence against women. We need to engage the cooperation<br />
of all levels of government and the community. Everyone,<br />
everywhere must become intolerant of domestic violence.<br />
This is a meaningful turning point in Australia's approach<br />
to this widespread and complex issue. The strategy will<br />
provide a foundation for the future development of policies<br />
and programs aimed at eliminating violence against women. </p>
