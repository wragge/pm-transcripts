I\<br />
FOR PRESS AUlTRALIA AT EXPO 67<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, Mr. Hirold Holt<br />
Canada's Centennial Exposition, better known as<br />
Expo 67 will open in Montreal on Friday. This great display,<br />
of icially styled the Montreal Universal and Internati'onal<br />
Exhibition, is a central feature of Canada's celebration of her<br />
first hundred years of Confederation. The Exposition will remain<br />
open for six months.<br />
Australia will be one of more than sixty nations<br />
represented. 7te have set up an impressive Australian Pavilion<br />
on the Exposition's man-made islana site in the St. Lawrence<br />
River, opposite downtown Montreal. Our exhibits are installed,<br />
the Pavilion staff has been assemoled and trained and arrangements<br />
have been completed for us to take part in the various cultural<br />
activities associated with Expo 67. These include the International<br />
Film Festival and the Vorld Festival of Ballet and Music.<br />
The whole Exposition is larger than the recent New<br />
York World Fair but is different in concept, presentation and<br />
management. The Exposition portrays, " Man and His Jorld" his<br />
endeavours in science, fine arts, exploration, agriculture and<br />
iniustry. Australia's Special Day will be June 6 and I will be<br />
there for the occasion. As my colleague, the Postmaster-general,<br />
has already announced, arrangements have been made for a direct<br />
pioneering telecast to Australia by way of the satellite ' Telstar'<br />
of the special events of that day.<br />
This is the first time Australia has taken part in<br />
such an international Exposition. The decision to do so was taken<br />
at a comparatively late stage and this imposed a demanding<br />
programme for planning and construction and called for special<br />
measures to ensure that we would be ready on time.<br />
The theme of the Australian Pavilion follows carefully<br />
the theme of the Exposition. Design studies were undertaken by<br />
the Commonwealth De-artment of ; orks and in December, 1965,<br />
Cabinet selected a aesign by an architect of that Deoartment, Mr.<br />
James Maccormick. Early in 1966, Cabinet approved proposals by<br />
the Exhibits Architect, Mr. Rooin Boyd, and the general approach<br />
proposed by the Commissioner-Jeneral, on other forms of participation.<br />
The total cost is estimated to be q3.14 million.<br />
It is a matter of satisfaction that, despite the time<br />
factor, oroblems of distance and climate and our lack of previous<br />
experience of such an exhibition, plans have been carried through<br />
and the Pavilion is ready to open on time with an effective<br />
presentation. This has been possible only through the enthusiastic<br />
and purposeful work of the Commissioner-Jeneral, Sir Valston<br />
Hancock, and his team, and the wholehearted suprort which the<br />
Organisation has received from Commonwealth Departments and<br />
authorities from the States, and from many private sources in<br />
industry and business throughout Australia.<br />
The mounting of our exhibition is in fact a remarkable<br />
story of co-operation and enthusiasm. The Canadian authorities<br />
estimate that some two million visitors will pass through the<br />
Australian pavilion during the Exposition. Far larger numbers<br />
will of course, be reached through specially arranged T. V. Radio<br />
and Press coverage of occasions including Australian presentations<br />
such as our Special Day. All this will promote greater A </p>
<p>-2-<br />
international awareness of Australia, its achievements and its<br />
potential. Throughout the Australian Pavilion the exhibits are,<br />
as far as possible, Australian made. Many of them have been<br />
manufactured in Australia for the first time from original<br />
designs. The Pavilion is virtually a floatin, box, 1361 square<br />
with two glassed-in sides, suspended above a typical Australian<br />
bushland setting. The mood created within it is one of space<br />
and tranquility. The Spirit of Adventure has been expressed<br />
through curving tree forms that support four independent roof<br />
sections. The theme of Australia as the world's major wool producer<br />
is emphasised and an immense off-white carpet of natural wool covers<br />
the entire floor area and sweeps up two end walls to ceiling height.<br />
Twenty-two hostesses will wear costumes of golden wool designed in<br />
Australia. The uniforms of male attendants are also of wool.<br />
There is a model of our great radio telescope at Parkes<br />
an animated scale model of the Snowy Mountains Scheme, a scale model<br />
of Canberra. There is a collection of contemporary Australian art and<br />
displays of acoriginal bark paintings : and precious opals. In a<br />
series of photogr phic and physical exhibits all our great developmental<br />
projects, from mining to medical research and architecture<br />
are presented. There is an unusual feature at the heart of the Pavilion,<br />
consisting of electronically operated sound chairs. There are 240<br />
chairs, grouped about various exhibits. They have a built-in<br />
stereophonic sound system developed and produced in Australia<br />
enablivn visitors to hear, as in personal discussion, the voices<br />
of notable Australians describing the exhibits.<br />
The Pavilion is in a natural Australian setting, of gum<br />
trees some up to 30' high and other native trees and shrubs.<br />
There is a spectacular scientific display of over 1,000 pieces of<br />
coloured coral from the Jreat arrier Reef. There is a billabong,<br />
a water hole, 20 kangaroos and 10 wallabies to make the atmosphere<br />
complete. The Australian Ballet will give six performances in<br />
Montreal oefore leaving to tour South America and the Meluourne<br />
Symphony Orchestra will give two performances. There will be a<br />
pop concert including well-known performers like the Seekers, and<br />
the Central 3and of the Royal Australian Air Force will give<br />
several open-air concerts. A comprehensive prozramme of<br />
entertainments, including sheep dog trials, woochopoing,<br />
boomerang throwing, and an unofficial Davis Cup has been devised<br />
by Mr. Robert Helpmann for presentation at the Place des Yations<br />
on our Special Day.<br />
I have every confidence that our staff in iontreal will<br />
acquit itself well. I am satisfied that the 3xhibition will stand<br />
proudly among the best of all the nationa" exhijitions, and I would<br />
hope that all Australians travelling abroad will take the opportunity<br />
of seeing it.<br />
