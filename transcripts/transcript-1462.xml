FOR PRESS: P. M. No. 1/ 1967<br />
VISIT TO NEW ZEALAND<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, Mr. Harold Holt<br />
I shall be in New Zealand at the invit ation of the New Zealand<br />
Prime Minister, Mr. Keith Holyoake, from Thursday, February 2 until<br />
Wednesday, February 8.<br />
The friendship between New Zealand and Australia is close and<br />
warm, It has been strengthened by our common background of British<br />
democracy and parliamentary institutions. We have been comrades in the<br />
cause of freedom and resistance to aggression in two WTorld Wars and, in more<br />
recent years, in Korea, Malaysia and Viet Nam. We have many mutual<br />
interests in trade, Commonwealth co-operation and in the security and<br />
economic progress of South-East Asia and the Pacific. The word ANZAC<br />
forged at Gallipoli has a special emotional and historic significance for<br />
Australia and New Zealand. There is a personal friendship between Mr.<br />
Holyoake and myself which appropriately reflects the relationship between our<br />
two countries. This will be my second visit to New Zealand. The first was<br />
made in 1950 when I led the Australian Delegation to the Commonwealth<br />
Parliamentary Conference. I look forward to my discussions with Mr. Holyoake<br />
and members of his Cabinet, also many other New Zealanders with whom I<br />
shall be coming in contact. I welcome the opportunity to see something of<br />
the considerable developments which are taking place in New Zealand in many<br />
directions. CANBER RA,<br />
January, 1967.<br />
BACKGROUND: The last visit by an Australian Prime Minister to New Zealand<br />
was in 1954 by Sir Robert Menzies. Mr. Holyoake was in Australia last June<br />
for meetings of the SEATO Council.<br />
Mr. Holt, while in New Zealand for the Commonwealth<br />
Parliamentary Association Conference of 1950, toured the North Is land<br />
extensively but has never been previously to the South Island. His itinerary,<br />
on this occasion, will take him to Wellington only in the North Island but to<br />
several points of interest in the South Island.<br />
Mr. Holt will depart from Sydney on Thursday, February 2,<br />
and will arrive at Wellington Airport towards the end of the afternoon.<br />
Friday will be spent in discussions with New Zealand Ministers, Saturday and<br />
Sunday in attending various functions in Wiellington and in travelling to<br />
Christchurch. During the remainder of the visit, the Prime Minister will be<br />
visiting places in the South Island, and will leave Christchurch for Sydney<br />
during the afternoon of Wednesday, Fetruary 8.<br />
Mr. Holt will be accompanied by Mrs. Holt. With the Prime<br />
Minister will travel also his Private Secretary, his Press Secretary and a<br />
member of the Prime Minister's Department. </p>
