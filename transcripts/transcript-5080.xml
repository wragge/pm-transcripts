PRESS OFFICE TRANSCRIPT WEDNESDAY 20 JUNE 1979 0<br />
PRIME MINISTER INTERVIEWED ON ABC'S " NATIONWIDE" BY<br />
RICHARD CARLETON<br />
Carleton<br />
Here in Canberra what happened was that at 11: 15 this morning<br />
Mr. Fraser, Mr. Anthony, Mr. Viner, Mr. Macphee and Mr. Ellicott<br />
were joined by Mr. Peter Nolan, the Secretary of the ACTU,<br />
Mr. Petersen, of the Manufacturing Group in the ACTU, Mr. Scott<br />
of the Metal Group, Mr. Bob Gregory of the United Trades and<br />
Labour Council of South Australia and Mr. Ray Geitzelt of the<br />
Services Group of the ACTU, and also Mr. Cliff Dolan the<br />
ACTU Vice-President. These gentlemen all together had lunch<br />
in the Cabinet room, the discussions continued all through the<br />
afternoon. At one stage Mr. Fraser had a break I understand<br />
to sreak to the Chairman and Chief Executive of Caltex Oil.<br />
The discussions continued after that and they had sandwiches<br />
for dinner. The discussions continued after that and they broke<br />
a little before 9: 00 EST. Mr. Fraser has since had a press<br />
conference and has been kind enough to come down to the studios<br />
here in Parliament House.<br />
Mr. Fraser, I would like to ask you simply, what has been<br />
achiaved since 11: 15 this morning?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I think a good deal has been achieved. As you know the ACTU<br />
resolution that was passed yesterday was calling for a day of<br />
protest tomorrow and then also indicating the very strong possibility<br />
of continuing bans on the exports of major commodities and<br />
indicating that if the TLC in Western Australia requested it,<br />
there could be a blockade against the State of Western Australia.<br />
It wasn't just a question of a day of protest that was confronting<br />
Australia. It was also a question of a continuing situation of<br />
deep industrial turmoil that would have done grievous and great<br />
harm to this nation. We've had discussions today which have<br />
been undertaken, I believe, with goodwill, on all sides. I also<br />
believe that those members of the ACTU who were with us today<br />
were concerned about the consequences of the proposed action on<br />
Ausrralia and therefore we were working to see how we could<br />
prevent that happening. Now, as a result of discussions, as a<br />
result of discussions that the ACTU representatives had with<br />
P. rr Czok cf t-e TLC in Western Australia; that Ian Vi~ er and<br />
mysef h-ad-with Des O'Neil, Acting Premier in. Western Australia;<br />
and also as a result of discussions that were being undertaken<br />
between Mr. O'Neil and the TLC in Western Australia, very late<br />
in the afternoon we got to a situation in which Mr. O'Neil wanted<br />
to amplify a statement that he'made earlier in the day about<br />
the nature of a review of the laws of assembly in Western Australia<br />
and other States. / 2 </p>
<p>2<br />
Carleton Let me just reiterate here; Mr. O'Neil is the Acting Premier<br />
of Western Australia.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
The Acting Premier of Western Australia.<br />
Carleton<br />
He is taking the place of Sir Charles Court whilst he is<br />
out of the country?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
That's right. So he issued a further statement indicating that<br />
the C:.-. monwealth Attorney-General and the Attorney-General of<br />
the Stae would jointly conduct a review. Now it is our<br />
understanding... Carleton What are they reviewing?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
They are reviewing the laws of assembly in Western Australia and<br />
other States.<br />
Carleton This is the Attorney-General in Western Australia<br />
Prime Minister<br />
And of the Commonwealth<br />
Carleton<br />
And Senator Durack the Commonwealth Attorney-General are to<br />
review the laws of assembly?<br />
Pri-e Minister<br />
They are the laws that are in question. This section of the<br />
Police Act which has caused this controversy is right at the<br />
centre cf it. They will be reviewing the situation! the law<br />
as itL i in Western Australia, the equivalent sections in the<br />
Acts of other States and obviously making recommendations to the<br />
Western Australian Government. I haven't got any doubt at all<br />
that in that review the Attorney-Generals will be wanting to<br />
reach a situation which prevents a continuation of these<br />
difficulties. / 3 </p>
<p>-3-<br />
Carleton To take it step by step sir, what happens tomorrow when the<br />
unionists go into court in Western Australia?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Tomorrow, it is our understanding that the cases will be deferred.<br />
There is no position being put by the Western AustralianGovernment<br />
in relation to that, but on all the advice available to us and<br />
in the normal practice, the case will be deferred and it is<br />
the intention to use the period of adjournment of the case of<br />
deferrment of the case for the two Attorney-Generals to encompass<br />
their review. It will be the objective to have the report of<br />
the Attorney-Generals in the hand of the Western Australian<br />
Govern-ment before the case is resumed. Again, that position was<br />
put to the ACTU representatives. As a result of that, they are<br />
prepared to recommend to the ACTU Executive tomorrow that<br />
any -uestion of continuing bans and limitations on the export<br />
of co-modities from Australia or bans on Western Australia as a<br />
State be put aside.<br />
Carleton Could I summarise what you have said? You correct me where I<br />
am wrong. That tomorrow morning the court case goes ahead in<br />
Western Australia.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Well, it will start.<br />
Carleton Sorry, it will start. Right. And also the day of national<br />
protest, the psuedo national strike, goes on tomorrow?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
They go on tomorrow.<br />
Carleton Right-1ow the expectation is that. the court hearing tomorrow<br />
will be adjourned.<br />
That's right. / 4 </p>
<p>-4<br />
Carleton And then whilst that court hearing is adjourned, then your<br />
Attorney-General and the West Australian Attorney-General will<br />
get together to review the laws of assembly?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Yes. Carleton And 1tihat review of the laws of assembly is expected to be<br />
complete before tomorrow's anticipated adjourned case is resumed.<br />
Prime M. inister<br />
That's r-! ight.<br />
Carleton<br />
That's the compromise?<br />
Prime MLinister<br />
That's the position that we reached this evening. As a result of<br />
that any question of further industrial action is put aside.<br />
Carleton THat' s'some achievement, isn't it?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I think it's a very significant achievement.<br />
Ckrle ton<br />
Not Just on your part I mean just in the negotiating process<br />
between you and Mr. Nolan.<br />
Prime Minister-<br />
I thin-k it was a very significant achievement. We had a joint<br />
press conference at the end of it all. I believe that the<br />
representatives of the ACTU who were with us today did have a<br />
wish -to reach a compromise. If you compare what we have arrived<br />
at with the initial demands of the TLC or the union movement, it<br />
was very different. I think also there is a recognition on the<br />
part of the Western Australian Government that a question of a<br />
national stoppage to be followed by bans on the export of major<br />
commodities was going to cause a very very serious situation<br />
indeed. If I could just make the point, it started as a<br />
Western Australian matter one of Western Australian responsibility,<br />
of Western Australian law and all that is perfectly true, it<br />
doesn't involve us at all but when you start to talk about<br />
bans upon a whole State by the rest of Australia, bans upon the<br />
export of Australian goods to markets right around the world,<br />
then very obviously the Commonwealth is involved and has to be involved. </p>
<p>Carleton I don't want to throw up a nasty issue when this air of<br />
compromise is around. Do you think you could have got this<br />
far if Mr. Hawke had been in the country.<br />
Prime-Minister<br />
I would prefer not to comment about that. Let me only say<br />
that I think the representatives of the ACTU who were with us<br />
today believed that there was a job to do. They were<br />
representatives of the industrial movement, representing the<br />
industri: al interest, with a concern for the right of assembly<br />
because they felt that was threatened whether that was a valid<br />
fear or not it was a fear that they had and they are people<br />
with one objective and one purpose and as a Government we were<br />
able tosit down with them and have a discussion that was<br />
sensi--.-. There was no grandstanding, not grandstanding at the<br />
press conference afterwards. It was productive and I think it's<br />
the wa-; relations ought to be conducted between a union movement<br />
and a Government.<br />
Carleton<br />
Are you going to turn those skills now, those negotiating skills,<br />
to solving the problems that exist in N. S. W. for the oil industry,<br />
and where are we now with that from your point of view?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Representatives of the Kurnell Refinery company people<br />
came down to see me today because they wanted to report directly<br />
on the seriousness of the situation in N. S. W. About 60 percent<br />
of the oil used in N. S. W. is for industrial purposes or important<br />
essential services. With the Kurnell shut N. S. W. has available<br />
to it with the Shell Refinery only about half the oil that is<br />
necessary for essential purposes and for industrial purposes.<br />
That just emphasises the enormous seriousness of the present<br />
positi" on. I don't want to comment on what has been happening in<br />
N. S. 1W4. today because there have been discussions involving elements<br />
of the N. 5. W. Government, as I understand it, all the people<br />
involved, including Sir John Moore. I only hope that having regard<br />
to the enormous severity of this issue, that they do reach a<br />
sati-' s,-'-Actorv-and a r-easonable and an-ecruitable solution.<br />
Carleton Eve r= has h-oe but is there expectation on your part that<br />
the aolat-ion to the oil indus'try dispute is<br />
Prime Minister<br />
We've obviously been having reports through the course of the<br />
day. But as I was advised just 10 or 15 minutes ago the discussions<br />
are still going on and I am afraid that I don't want to make<br />
any comment about that. I can only express a : hope at the moment<br />
because it is sensitive and it is delicately balanced and it<br />
again just shows the enormous harm that can come, in this case to<br />
a whole of State, to tens of thousands of people. / 6 </p>
<p>6<br />
Prime Minister ( continued)<br />
If you just think for a moment what's going to happen to<br />
Carleton Everyone knows they can't get<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I don't really know that they do. You might think that they<br />
know they can't get petrol to put in their car, but think of<br />
the person whose business depends on being able to get petrol.<br />
There are many small business people in that particular position.<br />
Their businesses can be destroyed as a result of this continuing.<br />
Many larger businesses that can ultimately survive find that<br />
they just have to stand people down. They can't keep operating.<br />
The hardship if you say you think you understand but I<br />
think the hardship that would be involved if this continues<br />
is aLrcst beyond our comprehension.<br />
Carleton That's why all the efforts, I suggest maybe impertinently<br />
but all the efforts should be directed towards a solution rather than<br />
Prime Minister<br />
They are being today. I haven't got the slightest doubt of that.<br />
That's why I don't want to comment on negotiations that are so<br />
important, that are still continuing, that I do know from<br />
reports that have come through the day are sensitively balanced<br />
at this moment. 000---</p>
