ORATION BY THE PRIM~ E MINISTER AT THE HAND) ING OVER TO<br />
THE BATHUJRST CITY COUNCIL OF THE COTTAGE OF J. B. CHIFLEY,<br />
BATHURST 24 MARCH 1973<br />
It is a profound measure of weight and force of Ben Chifley's<br />
personality that of the 14 Australian Prime Ministers now dead, he is<br />
outstandingly the one whose memory is clearest and strongest in the<br />
hearts and minds of his countrymen. The Chifley legend I use the<br />
word in its nobler sense has a force and meaning, even for the<br />
new generation which never knew him. Each of us will have our own<br />
opinion about who was the greatest of Australian Prime Ministers. I<br />
venture to suggest, however, that there would be no dispute as to who<br />
was the best loved.<br />
One of the sources of Chifley's ability to inspire affection<br />
was the simplicity of his life style. This cottage his only real<br />
home in or out of office symbolised it. That is not to say that<br />
Chifley was a simple man. He had inner reserves and an outer reserve<br />
which sprang from a character of great complexity. There was a very<br />
private Chifley unknown to the public, known perhaps not entirely<br />
even to his closest colleagues. For all his great warmth, for all<br />
his easy fellowship, for all the loyalty and love his inspires, he<br />
was in fact never " one of the boys". In this sense there was another<br />
Chifley apart, above, even dare one say it aloof.<br />
So great is the hold of the Chifley memory on the Australian<br />
Labor Party that it is usually forgotten how untypical of Labor leaders<br />
he actually was; paradoxically he has become the archetype for our<br />
leadership. There is something naturally very appealing to the Party<br />
in the rise of an engine driver to Prime Minister; yreat of the 11 of<br />
us who have led the Parliamentary Labor Party, only he and Matthew<br />
Charlton fit the classic type. So in this, as in so many other ways,<br />
Chifley was in a class of his own.<br />
It is a great thing for us all to be here at Ben Chifley's<br />
home not just this cottage but in this city which was so very much<br />
his city. It is a very moving thing for me to be here as the first<br />
Labor Prime Minister of Australia since Chifley. For us allt for the<br />
Australian Labor Party, Bathurst holds a very special meaning at his<br />
birthplace, his only real home; among the people who shared with him<br />
the bitterness and frustrations of the thirties, the victories and<br />
achievements of the forties. He was a Bathurst man through and through.<br />
He used to say " No Chifley ever left Bathurst except feet first".<br />
He did leave Bathurst to give on the national scale the same service<br />
that he had, for so many years, given Bathurst in local affairs,<br />
But it was to this city and the people of this city that he always<br />
returned and did return to his last rest.<br />
It is saddening to find that after 22 years his grave has<br />
fallen into disrepair. When we looked into the matter we found there<br />
was no machinery available to fulfil what is clearly a national<br />
responsibility and should be a national charge, so I have decided that<br />
henceforth the Australian Government shall assume responsibility for<br />
maintaining the graves of all former Prime Ministers and I have asked my<br />
colleague Don Willesee, the Special Minister of State, to make the<br />
necessary arrangements. It is fitting that monuments and memorials of our great should<br />
be preserved and cared for. We are not so rich in the memorabilia of<br />
history that we can afford to allow them to be lost or neglected. I<br />
congratulate all those who have worked for the preservation of this<br />
cottage. Nonetheless, Chifleyts lasting memorial lies in what he<br />
achieved for his nation and he himself has his true resting place in the<br />
hearts of his countrymen. Those monuments are imperishable; that place<br />
cannot be moved. </p>
