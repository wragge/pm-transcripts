ii) A U6T HAIA<br />
FOR PRESS 19 SEPTEMBER 1977<br />
ADDRESS AT CHINESE DELEGATION FAREWELL DINNER<br />
Mr Vice-Chairman, since we first met you, just a week ago<br />
you have travelled across part of our country. You have<br />
seen the cities of Sydney and Melbourne and some of our rural<br />
areas. In this respect your trip somewhat resembles my own<br />
visit to China last year when I saw, not only your great cities,<br />
but also more remote areas, including Urumchi.<br />
You will have gained some impressions of our people, our way<br />
of life and our countryside. But Australia, like China,<br />
is a vast country. When I visited China I was struck by the<br />
distances involved and the diversity of the countryside.<br />
I am sure you have had a similar experience over the past week.<br />
I hope you will come back again to see some of the things your<br />
limited time here prevented you from seeing.<br />
Mr Vice-Chairman, I spoke last week of the excellent way in<br />
which relations between Australia and China are developing.<br />
The Australian Government will continue to foster this<br />
development. I believe, especially, that we have much to<br />
share and build in our economic relationship.<br />
As you said last Tuesday, China is now embarked on a great<br />
plan to modernise he-r economy by the end of this century.<br />
You have seen some of the best examples of our agricultural<br />
and pastoral industries during your visit to the Royal Melbourne<br />
Show and to Wagga Wagga, one of our flourishing rural centres.<br />
In Sydney you have seen the port facilities where many of<br />
the projects which make up the expanding trade between our two<br />
countries are handled.<br />
I look forward to, and indeed firmly believe that there is much<br />
scope for, further expansion in our economic exchanges.<br />
I note in particular the prospects in the agricultural field<br />
which have presented themselves during your visit.<br />
When I was in China, I looked upon your agriculture with<br />
a farmer's eye, and although the farming practices of our two<br />
countries are different, the care with which the Chinese people<br />
tilled their fields and tended their crops was apparent.<br />
The capacity to feed and house 800 million people, to banish the<br />
spectre and the reality of famine is a great achievement. / 2 </p>
<p>Australia as a singificant farming nation can well appreciate<br />
the magnitude of this achievement and its significance.<br />
I know that your visit, Mr Vice-Chairman, will have stimulated<br />
the interests of many of my parliamentary colleagues in<br />
visiting China. It will also have strengthened the attitude<br />
of friendship which Australians hold towards China,<br />
and their interest in contributing to the growth of<br />
mutual understanding. This understanding was strengthened<br />
by the family reunion arrangement reached between Australia<br />
and China shortly after my visit to China last year.<br />
Chinese settlers have made a significant contribution<br />
to the development of Australia and it is important that<br />
our two countries should have arrangements for family<br />
reunion.<br />
Mr Vice-Chairman, our two countries have many interestsin common<br />
and on many matters we see eye to eye. On some matters there<br />
are differences in our points of view, but our relationship<br />
now has enough depth and substance to it that it is not<br />
put at risk by plain speaking on such issues of importance.<br />
As you prepare to leave, may I ask you to convey the greetings<br />
of the Australian Government and people to the Government and<br />
people of China.<br />
Your visit, Mr Vice-Chairman, has been a great honour for us<br />
and has given us much pleasure. We have enjoyed having you<br />
and your delegates as we have enjoyed your gracious hospitality<br />
tonight. </p>
