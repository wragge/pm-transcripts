<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>I have Prime Minister John Howard on the line. Good morning Prime</p>
<p> Minister.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>How are you, Howard, nice to talk to you again.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>Thanks for joining us on the programme. What are you doing in Sydney?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Doing some work. I have met the United Kingdom drugs czar a few moments</p>
<p> ago. A very interesting man. We compared notes and it would appear</p>
<p> that the approach to dealing with the drug problem in the United Kingdom</p>
<p> under the Blair Government is fairly similar to the approach being</p>
<p> adopted in Australia. There is a mixture of giving more support for</p>
<p> law enforcement, more support for education and more support for treatment.</p>
<p> We spent almost an hour together. He is a former West Yorkshire police</p>
<p> officer and he's got an overall responsibility to assess systems</p>
<p> different from ours in that they don't have a State/Federal arrangement.</p>
<p> But I was impressed with what they have been able to achieve and he</p>
<p> indicated that he though the approaches were broadly similar. Obviously</p>
<p> they don't need and shouldn't be carbon copies but it's</p>
<p> all part of the, I guess, learning experience countries have who have</p>
<p> a common commitment to fighting this huge social problem. And I think</p>
<p> it's very beneficial. I have got a strong personal interest in</p>
<p> and commitment to the fight against drugs and I feel grateful that</p>
<p> we have got a lot of support from the State Premiers right across</p>
<p> the political divide. And I want as far as possible to keep party</p>
<p> politics right out of drugs in this country.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>Good. Do they allow heroin shooting galleries of the kind that are</p>
<p> in Sydney at the moment?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No...well, he was very critical of that.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>You are too.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I am very, very critical of that but of course it's a matter</p>
<p> for the New South Wales law enforcement authorities and the New South</p>
<p> Wales Government. But there's not a lot of support from the people</p>
<p> I speak to. It is seen very much as a stunt and I am very critical</p>
<p> of it. He certainly was.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>Okay. Let's talk about something that involved Western Australia</p>
<p> this week, you signed the Regional Forest Agreement and one of the</p>
<p> greenies tried to snatch the microphone. You probably were aware of</p>
<p> that were you?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh yes, but they're the usual stunts. I mean, people keep running</p>
<p> them and I keep doing it.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>She has been charged by the way. Now, the thing I need to ask you</p>
<p> about that, as a result of that the greenies have declared war, they</p>
<p> say, on the Government here, probably war on the Opposition as well.</p>
<p> Does that worry you politically electorally?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, I think there are some greenies who will never be satisfied. And</p>
<p> this outcome, the RFA outcome in Western Australia, is a very fair</p>
<p> and balanced package. It has won the support of the union that says</p>
<p> although it is unhappy it, in fact, says it's too green but in</p>
<p> the end it acknowledges with all of the difficulties that it is not</p>
<p> a bad outcome. And I think that is very significant. I mean, we worked</p>
<p> very hard to make sure that jobs in towns like Nannup were protected.</p>
<p> There is a potential to create another 500 new jobs in value adding</p>
<p> and the RFA and the funding under the RFA, and there's a funding</p>
<p> package of about $59 million to which we're making a significant</p>
<p> contribution of about $20 million, that funding package will support</p>
<p> activities in some of the towns that would otherwise be affected.</p>
<p> There is an increase in the formal reserve of 151,000 hectares and</p>
<p> with 12 new national parks as well as other additions. Now, you know</p>
<p> as a Western Australian and the listeners know just how heated the</p>
<p> debate has been and how difficult it is to get everybody totally happy</p>
<p> about every aspect of these RFAs....</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>Yes but your critics are saying, one of the reasons why you came out,</p>
<p> they reckon, on side with the companies down there is that the companies</p>
<p> donate money to the Liberal Party...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh get lost, really, I mean, not you personally....</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>Are you telling me to get lost or....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, not you. I mean those critics. I'd never tell you to get</p>
<p> lost Howard.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>Thank you very much.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>That's all right.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>All right. Let's go north now if we could to the deal that has</p>
<p> been done between the Indonesians and Portugal over the future of</p>
<p> East Timor, the future leading up to the elections. Now, was there</p>
<p> any commitment, because I couldn't see it, to disarm the pro-Indonesian</p>
<p> paramilitaries?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>So the commitment....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>There's a commitment in the agreement. There's a commitment</p>
<p> to ensure that conditions of peace and an absence of intimidation</p>
<p> obtains. And, look, this is a difficult issue. You can approach it</p>
<p> in one of three ways. You can do what we are doing and that is use</p>
<p> our influence to bring about a fair result, you can, sort of, wave</p>
<p> your arms around and say we are going to invade the place if you don't</p>
<p> behave Â now that's absurd Â or we can simply sever</p>
<p> all connection with Indonesia, threaten to withdraw our aid, threaten</p>
<p> to break off other ties unless they do as we ask them to do. Now,</p>
<p> everyone who understands the pride involved for Indonesia and the</p>
<p> history of relations between the two countries and common sense will</p>
<p> realise that that's not an option either. Now, what we have tried</p>
<p> to do is to use our influence. Now, we have been very successful.</p>
<p> After all it was my letter to Dr Habibie in December of last year</p>
<p> that was the catalyst for the change in policy by the Indonesian Government.</p>
<p> And there's no doubt in the world that the meeting I had with</p>
<p> Dr Habibie which involved a one-and-a-half hour one-on-one personal</p>
<p> discussion with nobody else present. That meeting received a lot of</p>
<p> international focus. There is a very heavy degree of international</p>
<p> pressure on Indonesia to see that the words of the agreement that</p>
<p> has been signed in New York are lived up to. The issue still requires</p>
<p> a great deal of very delicate handling but we have a formal commitment</p>
<p> now by the Indonesian Government to conduct a ballot to allow the</p>
<p> people of East Timor to decide their future. We have a commitment</p>
<p> from the Indonesian Government to ensure that proper conditions obtain</p>
<p> for the conduct of that ballot. Now, if you say to me, can I guarantee</p>
<p> there'll be no deviation from that, I can't do that. No</p>
<p> Prime Minister of Australia can do that. But what I can guarantee</p>
<p> you is that we have used our influence as a close friendly country</p>
<p> but having a strong view about the need to have a democratic process</p>
<p> in East Timor, to improve the situation immeasurably from what it</p>
<p> was a few years ago.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>Will our Federal Police that go to East Timor be armed?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, it is our view they should have side arms, yes.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>Are you worried about their safety?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I always concerned about the safety of Australians who are in trouble-spots</p>
<p> of the world. I mean, we have seen two humanitarian aid workers taken</p>
<p> into custody in Yugoslavia. Of course there is a danger involved and</p>
<p> I said last week in Bali and I repeat it today, I am not going to</p>
<p> pretend to the police who might go or to their families that there</p>
<p> isn't some element of danger. Of course there is. We have been</p>
<p> involved in police operations all around the world in recent years.</p>
<p> In Bougainville, in Cambodia, in Cyprus, in Latin America, in a number</p>
<p> of places. And our police have done it with enormous distinction.</p>
<p> But there's always an element of danger, I can't pretend</p>
<p> that for a moment.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>Are you going to meet the first Kosovar refugees tomorrow?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes, I'll greet them and extend a few words of welcome on behalf</p>
<p> of the Australian people. I believe that this is a demonstration of</p>
<p> the open-heartedness and decency of the Australian people. There's</p>
<p> great concern about what has happened in their homeland. We hope that</p>
<p> they will only be here temporarily in the sense that we would like</p>
<p> them to be able to go back to their homeland and I am sure they'd</p>
<p> want to do that. And it's the least that a country as fortunate</p>
<p> as Australia can do to take 4,000 of them and provide them with a</p>
<p> safe haven during these extraordinarily traumatic and difficult times.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>How do you rate former Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser's chances</p>
<p> of extracting Peter Wallace and Steve Pratt from their captors?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I hope Malcolm is successful. I had a number of discussions with him</p>
<p> earlier this week. I have written to the Yugoslav President, reiterating</p>
<p> that these men were humanitarian aid workers, that they were doing</p>
<p> work for Serbian refugees. They were not in any way aligned with one</p>
<p> or other side of the conflict. I don't want to say too much because....</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>I know but it's extraordinary isn't it, that you've</p>
<p> got three combatants with the United States Army, albeit in Macedonia</p>
<p> when they were captured, but they are released and their country is</p>
<p> at war with Serbia. We're not and yet we've got two peaceful</p>
<p> aid workers who are still captives. Amazing.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I certainly regard what is happening as quite wrong.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>Bizarre almost.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes, but please, I choose my words carefully because my one aim is</p>
<p> to get them out, and that should be the aim of anybody who makes any</p>
<p> comment of any kind on this issue, and we are dealing with a delicate</p>
<p> situation. We are doing our level best and I just hope that we can</p>
<p> get them out.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, I believe you met with the key voter on your tax package,</p>
<p> Senator Brian Harradine yesterday I think it was. How did you go?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well we had a very pleasant discussion, and we'll have more.</p>
<p> I'm not going to give a commentary on what was said, or what</p>
<p> might be likely to be said in the future. He's a voter. There</p>
<p> are other voters too.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>He's a pretty important one.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, that's if you just sort of accept that everybody else who's</p>
<p> voting in the senate has a right to ignore the decision of the Australian</p>
<p> people last October.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>Well I think they will won't they?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well they ought to think very hard about the outcome of that election.</p>
<p> But look, I've been through all of this before. Everybody knows</p>
<p> that we want to get our tax plan through the Senate, and everyone</p>
<p> knows we need a majority of the Senators in order to do it. And everyone</p>
<p> knows that we would like the support, if the Labor Party and the Democrats</p>
<p> and the Greens remain opposed, we need the support of Senator Harradine</p>
<p> and Senator Colston, and we're obviously going to try and get</p>
<p> that support. Now I respect Senator Harradine very much. I believe</p>
<p> he's got strong views on some things. We agree on a lot of things,</p>
<p> we disagree on others. I'm not going to speculate about how he</p>
<p> might vote. That's a matter for him in the end. I'll obviously</p>
<p> go on talking to him and the Treasurer and I will have further discussions</p>
<p> with him.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>Yeah, but if doesn't get up what happens to tax reform in Australia?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I will deal with that if it doesn't. I mean perhaps you</p>
<p> should say that, you should put it to those who are escaping any of</p>
<p> the responsibility for voting against it now, like the Labor Party</p>
<p> and the Democrats, as to what happens in tax reform in Australia.</p>
<p> It's a very fair question. I mean we have been debating tax reform</p>
<p> in this country for 25 years. It is 14 years now since the Hawke Government's</p>
<p> tax summit. It's six years since John Hewson's ÂFight</p>
<p> Back'. We had an election last October. We have a ramshackle</p>
<p> tax system. It needs to be reformed. We had the courage to put a plan</p>
<p> down to reform but I think the Australian people would expect that</p>
<p> plan to be passed by the Australian Senate. But in the end the Senate</p>
<p> will decide. I hope that it passes it and I will do my level best</p>
<p> to persuade a majority of Senators, I don't need to persuade</p>
<p> my own, but a majority of Senators to pass the legislation.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>The Federal budget comes out next week doesn't it?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>It does indeed. On the 11th of May.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>How can you possibly frame a Federal budget without knowing whether</p>
<p> the major plank in tax reform, your revenue base, is going to get</p>
<p> through the Senate? I mean.....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well very easily.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>How do you do that?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well budgets are always framed on the basis that government legislation</p>
<p> will be passed by the Parliament.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>Well what if it's not? We'll have to have another budget</p>
<p> won't we?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, you won't have to have another budget. That's not the</p>
<p> case at all. The budget doesn't fall apart. Look they are related</p>
<p> but they are two separate streams, if you like, of economic management.</p>
<p> It is always the case that you frame a budget on the basis that legislation</p>
<p> sponsored by the Government will go through the Parliament.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>Good luck.</p>
<p>[COMMERCIAL BREAK]</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>My studio guest, he's in our Sydney studios at least, is the</p>
<p> Prime Minister of Australia and he is inviting your calls in the few</p>
<p> minutes he's got left before the ten o'clock news on 9221</p>
<p> 1233. Prime Minister, let's talk with Harley. Good morning, Harley.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>Good morning, Howard. Good morning, Mr Prime Minister.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Good morning, Harley.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>I have a daughter that's just about Â she's pregnant</p>
<p> and she was due about three or four days ago and she heard the news</p>
<p> about the lady that was sent back to China with their one-child policy</p>
<p> and then her child was due to be born in ten days time and they just,</p>
<p> you know, virtually butchered it. The point I'm asking you is,</p>
<p> perhaps we could get the Minister for Foreign, Alexander Downer, to</p>
<p> take on board something like this because there's murder being</p>
<p> carried on, probably to some horrendous degree, far worse in China</p>
<p> than there is in Kosovo. Now, you know, surely just because China</p>
<p> is the biggest, you know, whip-cracker in the world doesn't mean</p>
<p> to say that they, you know, possess the ordained right to turn around</p>
<p> and just start, you know, butchering people just because they want</p>
<p> to have more than one child. I think this would be a far bigger platform</p>
<p> for Mr Downer to possibly take on.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, Harley, in relation to the claim that's been made concerning</p>
<p> this lady, if that happened then I'm quite horrified and I'm</p>
<p> sure most Australian would be equally horrified. I'm having it</p>
<p> investigated. I discussed this matter with Senator Harradine yesterday</p>
<p> during a discussion that we had which covered a number of subjects,</p>
<p> not just taxation. I have also discussed it in some detail with Mr</p>
<p> Ruddock, the Immigration Minister, and we are waiting on a detailed</p>
<p> report from his Department about what happened. I can't pre-judge</p>
<p> the outcome of that. Mr Ruddock made the observation yesterday that</p>
<p> it's normally not the policy of airlines to fly people in a very</p>
<p> advanced state of pregnancy. I don't know all the circumstances.</p>
<p> We've just received the, so I'm told, all the video evidence</p>
<p> from Senator Harradine and the matter is going to be investigated</p>
<p> quite stringently because I am very concerned about this claim. I</p>
<p> am very concerned about it. It offends my own instincts and I'm</p>
<p> sure it offends your instincts and the instincts of millions of Australians.</p>
<p> Now, we can't govern what other countries do but we can, of course,</p>
<p> control what happens to people who are temporarily in this country</p>
<p> no matter what the circumstances are. It certainly would have been</p>
<p> against policy for somebody in that situation to have been returned</p>
<p> against their will.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>All right, Harley, thanks for your call Â 9221 1233 if you want</p>
<p> to speak with the Prime Minister. Hello, Marlene.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>Hi, Howard. Hi, Prime Minister.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Hi Marlene.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>Yes, all the aid we're giving to Indonesia now right, what happens</p>
<p> if later on we've trained them here so when they go back, what</p>
<p> happens if in 10 or 15 years down the line they want to overrun us?</p>
<p> They can because we haven't got the power or anything else to</p>
<p> save us.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, the likelihood of Indonesia invading Australia is extremely</p>
<p> remote. And that is not only my view, it's been the view of previous</p>
<p> Labor governments. The Indonesian Army's logistic capacity is</p>
<p> such that it couldn't possibly sustain such an invasion, quite</p>
<p> apart from the fact that there's no reason why Indonesia would</p>
<p> want to invade us. The aid and training of which you speak is not</p>
<p> so extensive as to make an enormous difference to that capacity, although</p>
<p> it is very valuable. We do give some foreign aid to Indonesia and</p>
<p> I defend that because Indonesia is our nearest neighbour and we have</p>
<p> an interest. It's for Australia's benefit that we have friendly</p>
<p> relations with our nearest neighbour. It's also for Australia's</p>
<p> benefit that we stand up for the things that we believe in and</p>
