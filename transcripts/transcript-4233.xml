FOR PRESS 20 SEPTEMBER 1976<br />
ADDRESS TO THE R. S. L. CONGRESS<br />
It gives me great pleasure to be present at this official<br />
opening of the 61st National Congress of the Returned Services<br />
League. I, like the overwhelming majority of Australians am deeply<br />
appreciative of the basic commitments that motivate the R. S. L.<br />
The ideals of devotion to the nation, loyalty, service and<br />
the wilinness to serve one's country in a military capacity<br />
overseas. 71: qualities of devotion and service that the<br />
R. S. L. -e-r-lifies are of great importance to the well-being<br />
of the-As-.-s-aian Commonwealth.<br />
The R. S. L. -1 nurtured these qualities and contributed to the<br />
vitalit: which they are passed from generation to generation.<br />
On ever-Day Australians reflect on their past and the<br />
qualities d sacrifices that made possible the freedom<br />
Australians now enjoy.<br />
As the: years pass this appreciation for past sacrifices has<br />
come to be shared by families who have come to Australia in the<br />
post-war years and whose children are such a vigorous<br />
and important part of Australia.<br />
Every natio! needs to take the time to reflect and<br />
affirm the values the R. S. L. represents the values of<br />
patriotisn and the capacity for sacrifice and achievement<br />
against odds.<br />
It is a great tribute to the League that Anzac Day has come to<br />
serve this purpose. The motto of the R. S. L. is " the price of<br />
liberty is eternal vigilance". This motto has guided the League<br />
in relatiz r: c questions of the national defence.<br />
Today, r. ne-ed for vigilance in the defence of liberty remains.<br />
The intern.~ ional situation is one in which tensions have not<br />
been eli:-'-ined. There is a continued readiness on the part of<br />
some st3es -o nursue theirinterests by the use of force. The<br />
influence countries opposed to the freedom and respect for<br />
the individual is growing. / 2 </p>
<p>In acting effectively in such an international environment,<br />
Australians must be willing to view the world as it is,<br />
not as we would like it to be. There must be a willingness<br />
on the part of many people to discuss the needs of Australian<br />
defence and foreign policies: in ways which illuminate the<br />
underlying realities of the international situation;<br />
in ways which produce an ability to cope with challenge<br />
and complexity and in ways which serve Australia's national<br />
interest.<br />
The discussion should be dispassionate and free of either<br />
stridency or false illusions. The Returned Services League<br />
has a significant role to play in the discussion of our<br />
foreign and defence policies. One of the major advantages<br />
democracies have over authoritarian regimes is that they have<br />
the benefit of the free play of discussion and debate.<br />
This is not a restriction on foreign policy as some might<br />
think. It is in fact essential to the development of<br />
effective and sophisticated foreign and defence policies.<br />
The Government has sought to take the lead in pomoting<br />
this discussion by putting before the Australian public<br />
its perspective on the world, the problems and the<br />
opportuniti. s it affords to Australia.<br />
Let me refer briefly to one matter which I raised in my<br />
June 1 st-ement and which has occasioned some debate. I expressed<br />
the Australian Government's concern at the growth of Soviet<br />
military power, pointing to the fact that the U. S. S. R. now has<br />
a strategic and political reach a capacity to influence and<br />
intervene -: ell beyond the established zone of Soviet security<br />
interests. -is concern has also been expressed by the defence<br />
and foreign ministers of the NATO powers.<br />
The Opposition Shadow Minister for Defence, Mr Hayden, seeks to<br />
deny that there is any reason for Australia to be concerned.<br />
He makes the acute observation that the NATO powers' statements<br />
relate to: " events 14,000 kilometres away in the distant<br />
reaches of Europe."<br />
Somie people apparently cannot grasp that what happens<br />
in Europe is of . vital importance to Australia that we are<br />
no longer living in the days of sailing ships but in the days of<br />
I. C. B. M's. We no longer live in an isolated region but in a<br />
world of nations linked by the technological revolution.<br />
The Australian Government seeks nothing more than friendly and<br />
mutually beneficial relations with the Soviet Union.<br />
But the Government must put before the Australian people its<br />
concerns. The Government must tell the truth as it sees it.<br />
To adopt any other course would be to rail in its responsibilities<br />
to the nation.<br />
If the concern we have expressed on the basis of evidence before<br />
us is misplaced, it is within the means of the USSR to make this cleo<br />
We fervently hope it will do so. / 3 </p>
<p>Since the Government came to office, it has acted to strengthen<br />
Australia's relations with a number of countries in the<br />
region and ouside it. This year a Treaty of Friendship<br />
and Cooperation has been signed with Japan.<br />
Extensive discussions have been held with the Chinese<br />
leadership. In South East Asia our major concern is to support<br />
the ASEAN countries' efforts to promote internal development<br />
in the region. We believe the ASEAN countries are making significant.<br />
progress and that it is vital that the conditions allowing<br />
this progress to continue are maintained.<br />
Our attitude to foreign and defence issues are not based<br />
on ideological preconceptions but on a realistic concern for<br />
Australia's national interests.<br />
In pursuing these interests, the nation with which we can have the<br />
closest cooperation is the USA.<br />
America has assumed tremendous responsibilities in the world.<br />
In the Second ' orld War, the USA ensured Australia' security from<br />
invasion and led the destruction, of the Axis powers.<br />
Since has played an indispensable role in preserving<br />
world 2e: ed security.<br />
This CGoverr-e-t will ensure that the ANZUS alliance with the<br />
U. S. and Zealand is sustained. We will meet to the full<br />
our res. ilities under this alliance.<br />
In this z: k, we have the overwhelming support of the Australian<br />
people. who tried to undermine the ANZUS alliance by<br />
attempting prevent the visit of the Truxton have discovered<br />
where the c.: imitments of the Australian people lie.<br />
Although Australia has been facing great economic difficulties<br />
the Governe. nt has taken decisions to ensure that the defence of<br />
Australia * ill not be allowed to run down. Recognition<br />
of the realities of Australia's global and regional strategic<br />
circumstances gives rise to the requirement to formulate<br />
and implement a national defence policy.<br />
Firstly, we must ensure that realistic diplomacy is<br />
employed to the full to support our security and accordingly<br />
that of friends and allies.<br />
Secondly, , e nmust achieve within the practical limits of our<br />
available rsz-urces a steady enlargement of self-relianoe<br />
in defe.-. pability.<br />
Thirdl:, e -ust cooperate with and support our allies and<br />
regional . ssciatesi n countering threats to peace and stability.<br />
The Gov'er-. ent recognises that Australian policy must be based<br />
on a czm. re. ensjve, independent and coordinated assessment and<br />
definition our national interests, and on maintaining close<br />
consul: atin and collaboration with our allies. / 4 </p>
<p>4.-<br />
Acceoting responsibility to achieve greater military<br />
self-reliance in no way diminished the importance of our<br />
defence alliance with the United States. But we do not<br />
believe that America should alone bear the responsibilities<br />
which other nations share.<br />
Our first concern must be to ensure that Australia is seen<br />
as a nation that is militarily competent, capable of independent<br />
effort and that has a realistic understanding of its strategic<br />
situation. Military forces able to discharge a range of current and foreseeabl<br />
tasks, and which have the ability to expand are an<br />
essential element in Australia's defence policy.<br />
It is against this background that the Government announced<br />
earlier this year its intention to embark on a defence programme<br />
that will involve the expenditure in real terms of more<br />
than $ 12,000 million in the next five years.<br />
The first instalment of this programme has now been approved<br />
in the 3ud;, e for 1976/ 77 in . which provision of $ 2,178 million<br />
is made Defence. This is an increase in real terms<br />
in excess f 7%.<br />
Making -such significant increase at a time of acknowledged<br />
economic difficulties is an indication of the priority<br />
this Gove_-. rnt attaches to national security, our refusal to<br />
follow : he previous Government in its relegation of the nations<br />
defence tc-second place.<br />
Further in: reases are planned in the later years of the programme,<br />
which is the time at which spending on substantial and long lead<br />
items begins to take effect. The White Paper soon to be<br />
presented vy my colleague, the Minister for Defence, will elaborate<br />
on these matters.<br />
In the equipment area advantage will be taken of the enhanced<br />
capabilities made possible by new techniques which have produced<br />
weapons with unsurpassed accuracy. Examples of this may be seen<br />
in the capabilities that will be available in the new long<br />
range maritime reconnaissance aircraft and the new destroyers.<br />
The weapons system associated with these two purchases will<br />
herald a significant advance in the technological level of Australia'<br />
forces.<br />
There is one final point which I wish to make. The Government<br />
recognises That in peacetime, with volunteer defence forces,<br />
there is a nced to provide for an adequate community life for<br />
servic. e. en and their families.<br />
The R. S. L. has done admirable work in assisting ex-servicemen,<br />
and their f~-ilies in these matters. </p>
<p>My Government has and will continue to ensure that the<br />
C: f. nce forces requirements not only the equipment and<br />
f:,:; lites but also for conditions of service, receive<br />
the highest priority.<br />
My colleague, the Minister for Repatriation, Senator the<br />
Honourable Peter Durack, will be addressing you later today<br />
so I will comment on repatriation matters except to say<br />
that the Go : ernment has before it the reports of a number of<br />
expert inquiries all of which touch upon repatriation in some way,<br />
In acting on these inquiries the Government will be guided by<br />
its commiitment to preserving and improving the repatriation<br />
s; stem including retention of the Department and Commission<br />
which have served the ex-service community of this country so<br />
well for some sixty years.<br />
Both the Liberal Party and the National Country Party recognise<br />
that the repatriation system needs to be adjusted from time to<br />
-time in line with the needs of ex-servicemen and women and their<br />
dependants. Ladies and -en-lemen, thank you for giving me an opportunity<br />
to relate the objectives of the Government to the ideals of<br />
this gre-: : ational institutions.<br />
I hope th:--our Congress is a very successful and productive one.<br />
