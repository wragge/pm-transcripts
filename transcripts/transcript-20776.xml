    <content><![CDATA[<p>I refer to the report by Marian Wilkinson in the Sydney Morning Herald of   7 July 2003 (“Canberra knew of Iraq doubt”).</p>
<p>I have been advised by the relevant Australian agencies that they have no record of having received any report by Ambassador Wilson as referred to in the article.</p>
<p>The article also canvassed the differing views among US agencies about whether aluminium tubes purchased by Iraq were designed to enrich uranium.  Australian agencies were aware of the debate in the United States about the purpose of the aluminium tubes.  I made no reference to aluminium tubes in my statement to Parliament of 4 February or subsequently.</p>
