EMBARGOED 4pm<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON PJ. KEATING, MP<br />
PROTECTING AUSTRALIAN EMPLOYEES<br />
Over the last eight weeks the Commonwealth has become Increasingly concerned<br />
about the threat to social cohesion and economic recovery posed by attempts to cancel<br />
the award. systcm:<br />
The Kennett Government is the first to adopt the Hewson agenda in Lndustrial<br />
rtelations. The Commonwealth Government has put Australia's industrial relations system on to<br />
an irreversible path towards workplace bargaining.<br />
This is the key to ensuring that Australia does make the big productivity advance in<br />
the 1990s.<br />
Nearly 600 enterprise agrecments have already been registered with the Australian<br />
-Industrial Relations Commission and the Government is well on the way to having at<br />
least half the workforce currently under federal awards in enterprise bargains by the<br />
middle of next year.<br />
And these cnterprise agreements will be secured through eoopcration not intimidation.<br />
If we have learnt anything in the last 10 years it is that the most successful economics<br />
are those that harness the power of competition and reform with cooperation.<br />
Intimidation leads to dislocation and the intransigcnt protection of entrenched rights.<br />
The Kennett Government is taking Australia down the confrontation route which will<br />
simply derail the reform of industrial relations in this country.<br />
The Victorian Govcrnment's decision to cancel the award systcm and force more than<br />
six hundred thousand Victorians on to individual contracts has already fractured the<br />
long period of irdustrial harmony which has seen the lowest national strike rate for<br />
thirty years. It has disturbed the confidence of investors. </p>

For Victoria itself, which accounts for 27 per cent of Australian output, a third of<br />
Australian manufacturing output and 17 per cent of our exports, the industrial conflict<br />
has had a devastating effect on confidence. Classified job advertisements in Thc Age<br />
have fallen. DEETs indicator of skilled job vacancics released yestcrday showed rises<br />
for other states but no movement in Victoria.<br />
As yesterday's National Accounts figures showed recovery is well under way in<br />
Australia and we have been growing at an annual rate of around 2 per cent for 4<br />
quarters. It is a measure of the Government's accomplishments that this has been done In a<br />
situation where most countries are growing much more slowly than this or are still<br />
contracting. However, Australia's growth rate must be increased further and we must build on what<br />
has already been achieved.<br />
On this score, industrial conflict in Victoria is putting the entire Australian . recovery at<br />
risk,<br />
The Victorian Government's decision also highlights the way in which the Hewson<br />
agenda in industrial relations obstructs reform in Australian workplaces. The<br />
Commonwealth has adopted a policy of encouraging workplace bargaining, with<br />
award wages and conditions operating as a safetynet to catch those employees who are<br />
unable to reach agreements with their employers.<br />
Arbitrated minimium wage outcomes are becoming less relevant to actual wage<br />
outcomes, but the Commonwealth believes that the provision of a permanent and<br />
reliable safety net, and of rights to~ plqteetion_ against unfair dismissal, are an essential<br />
foundation upon which reform in industrial relations should proceed.<br />
The Commonwealth's assessment is that conflict between the Victorian Government<br />
and Victorian employees is now settling into a dangerous deadlock.<br />
The Commonwealth Government has decided to legislate to offer Australians who find<br />
themselves in the circumstances produced by the Victorian industrial relations<br />
legislation the. safcty net of federal awards, and the enterprise bargaining structure of<br />
the federal legislation.<br />
This is to ensure that we continue to make progress in making the labour market more<br />
flexible and that we don't get side tracd into pointless and destructive industrial<br />
disputes.<br />
The safety net of minimum wages will be available both thirough federal awards, and<br />
through a new provision which will allow the Commission to determine minimum<br />
wages in a wider set of circumstances than is currently possible.<br />
The Commonwealth Government has therefore also decided to legislate under<br />
internationa~ sonyti o to guarantee rights to equal pay for work of equal value by<br />
men and women, and to protection against unfair dismissal, two national standards<br />

which the Victorian Government does not guarantee and which are most threatened by<br />
its legislation.<br />
These protections will be guaranteed undcr the external affairs power of the<br />
constitution and R1O conventions setting international standards in these areas.<br />
Since the ILO convention governing unfair dismissal has to yet be ratified by the<br />
Australian Government, we will consult with the States and with the industrial parties<br />
on its implementation.<br />
The Government intends to have most of the legislative provisions available by the<br />
time Victorian awards are abolished on March 1 next year.<br />
Consideration is being given to legislation protecting some other internationally<br />
recognised standards, such as annual leave, maternity and parental leave and hours of.<br />
-work,.<br />
This new legislation is not designed to create new national standards, to lay a new<br />
safety net where one already exists, or to replace State systems offering conciliation<br />
and compulsory arbitration.<br />
All awards created as a result of the legislation will continue to be subject to the<br />
provision that they can be varied by enterprise bargaining, so long as therc is clear<br />
evidence that the employees consent to the variation, and the new arrangement does<br />
not leave them worse off in total than the old arrangcment.<br />
Improved acccss to fedcral awards will be facilitated by an immediate change to the<br />
objects of the IR act to encourage Access t-oawards for employees who are not now<br />
under federal awards and arc not within the scope of a state arbitral jurisdiction.<br />
The AIRC will be given the authority to determine minimum rates, whether or not an<br />
interstate industrial dispute exists, for an employee or a group of employees who do<br />
not have that protection.<br />
The Commission will be given the power to award e~ qual pay.<br />
The termination and redundancy provisions sought by the Commonwealth are those<br />
specified in the relevant ILO convention. These include the requirement for an<br />
employer to offer a valid reason for dismissal, Severance pay, and appeal to an<br />
impartial tribunal against unfair dismissal.<br />
The legislation will guarantee the Australian Government's charter for industrial<br />
relations which I announced on August 31<br />
At that time I gave 11 undertakings to Australian employees, some of which the<br />
Victorian legislation has since put at risk<br />

Among other commimrrcnts in the Govcrniments charter for industrial relations we<br />
undertook to keep a safety net under the low paid and poorly organised<br />
to makc sure workplace agreements are fair<br />
to enforce agreements with simple procedures<br />
not to force employees off awards<br />
to allow employees to be covered by u nions<br />
In my vicw thes rights cannot be guaranteed for Victorians under the Kennett<br />
Government's Industrial legislation. The legislation which I have announced today is<br />
Intended to fulfil our undertaking, and to safeguard the system of enterprise bargaining<br />
underpinned by award minimums which is successfully transforming workplaces<br />
operating under Commonwealth legislation.<br />
The system of awards is the safety net which protects thc minimum wages and<br />
working conditions of Australian enhployces. It is the Australian Governments belief<br />
that all Australians arc entitled to this form of protection, and the changes announced<br />
today are designed to guarantee them.<br />
