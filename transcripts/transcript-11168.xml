<p>E&amp;OE...................</p>
<p> CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>  Prime Minister, welcome to town.</p>
<p> PRIME</p>
<p>   MINISTER:   </p>
<p> Very good to be here again Jeremy.</p>
<p> CORDEAUX:</p>
<p> It is good to see you.  I saw Rod Kemp</p>
<p>   last night on television attempting, I really didn't understand</p>
<p>   what he was saying about this casino GST break.  If he was</p>
<p>   trying to make the point I couldn't understand it.  Maybe we'll</p>
<p>   deal with that first.  People sort of see it as being very</p>
<p>   strange that you've been besieged with all sorts of charitable organisations.</p>
<p>People want food, the necessities of life made GST free.  Yet</p>
<p>   you pick up the paper and you find that the casinos, or the high</p>
<p>   rollers of the casinos are going to get a break.  Help me to</p>
<p>   understand that.  </p>
<p> PRIME</p>
<p>   MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well they're not getting a break, but before I explain it can</p>
<p>   I just point out that we have given a lot of concessions to charities.</p>
<p>Only last week we announced that raffles and bingos would be completely</p>
<p>   free of the GST.  We made another major concessions as a result</p>
<p>   of representations from the welfare sector concerning opportunity</p>
<p>   shops.  That was done several months ago.  We have in</p>
<p>   fact made a lot of concessions already in response to representations</p>
<p>   that have been put to us by the charitable sector.  They don't</p>
<p>   get much publicity.  It's much easier to say: shock horror</p>
<p>   Crown Casino, and because it's guaranteed a big headline because</p>
<p>   of some of the personalities involved in the casino.  But we</p>
<p>   are not giving them any concession.  Under the GST you don't</p>
<p>   tax the winnings of the gambler.  You don't tax the punter.</p>
<p>You tax the operator and you tax the operator on his margin, his</p>
<p>   net profit if you like.  And his net profit is what he gets</p>
<p>   out of the gambling transaction.  And if he gives a rebate</p>
<p>   as part of attracting his custom that rebate reduces his profit.</p>
<p>Therefore you pay the GST on the profit.  And that was always</p>
<p>   going to be the case.  That was the announced policy.</p>
<p>It was never any different and the legislation as originally introduced</p>
<p>   didn't give effect to that.  Therefore the casino association</p>
<p>   as I understand it, went to the Treasury and made a representation</p>
<p>   to the Treasury.  The Treasury took the view that it was a</p>
<p>   reasonable change.  It brought the legislation in line with</p>
<p>   the original policy.  It does not involve making casinos free</p>
<p>   of GST.  Casinos will pay the GST.  They will pay the</p>
<p>   GST on their margin, on their net operating profit if you want to</p>
<p>   put it that way.  But high rollers like any other punter don't</p>
<p>   bear the GST.  That's how the system works.  And for people.I</p>
<p>   mean it's very easy because it's Crown Casino, and because of the</p>
<p>   personalities involved, Mr Walker and others, people who run around</p>
<p>   and say this is a shock horror fix. It's not a fix.  There's</p>
<p>   no reason why you shouldn't bring legislation into line with the</p>
<p>   policy and I just say again that we have made a lot of changes,</p>
<p>   the raffles and bingos is the latest example, a lot of changes to</p>
<p>   meet the legitimate concerns and objections of the welfare sector.</p>
<p>And we are continuing to be open to fine-tuning of the package.</p>
<p>And this thing that was announced on the casinos doesn't involve</p>
<p>   making any revenue concession that wasn't already allowed for. </p>
<p> CORDEAUX:</p>
<p> Yes, well that explains it better than I think</p>
<p>   Mr Kemp tried last night.  </p>
<p> PRIME</p>
<p>   MINISTER:</p>
<p>It's a very.look I know because it's Crown Casino, and I speak</p>
<p>   as somebody who doesn't like gambling very much as people know.</p>
<p>I think there's too much gambling in our country.  But if you</p>
<p>   lay down a policy and the legislation doesn't meet that policy,</p>
<p>   and anybody's entitled to come along and say: look this is what</p>
<p>   you said.  Your legislation doesn't match it.  Will you</p>
<p>   please change the legislation.  Now that's fair enough and</p>
<p>   we've done that in a lot of areas in relation to charities and I</p>
<p>   say again, it's not fair of people like Harry Herbert and others</p>
<p>   to run around and say we don't listen to the welfare sector.</p>
<p>We listened in relation to opportunity shops, we listened in relation</p>
<p>   to raffles and bingos, we've listened in relation to a lot of things.</p>
<p>But some of the requests that are being made of us are not reasonable</p>
<p>   and we can't accede to them. But I'm not going to be sort of knocked</p>
<p>   off course through the emotional use of a controversial name like</p>
<p>   Crown Casino.  </p>
<p> CORDEAUX:</p>
<p> It was just that the opponents, the critics</p>
<p>   of tax reform seem to me to be getting one hell of a free kick yesterday.</p>
<p> PRIME</p>
<p>   MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well it's easy when you've got an emotional thing like that,</p>
<p>   but can I say to your listeners we have not exempted casinos from</p>
<p>   the GST.  They pay the GST on their net operating margin as</p>
<p>   they should, as they were always intended to. That was the arrangement</p>
<p>   and high rollers like any other punter don't pay tax on their winnings.</p>
<p>I mean you don't want a GST that taxes the punter.  You want</p>
<p>   a GST that taxes the deal of the operator.  </p>
<p> CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>The thing that's interesting South Australians today is the</p>
<p>   wine industry.  I guess everyone is going to try and screw</p>
<p>   for his sector, or his industry a better deal.  What can you</p>
<p>   tell us that might be of relief for..?  </p>
<p> PRIME</p>
<p>   MINISTER:   </p>
<p> Well I hope, as I have an opportunity, my colleagues</p>
<p>   have a further opportunity to explain the details of what we've</p>
<p>   done, that we're treating the wine industry very fairly.  What</p>
<p>   we've sought to do is produce a result that is fair in relation</p>
<p>   to all beverage sectors.  Now we spent an enormous amount of</p>
<p>   time listening to the wine industry before we brought the package</p>
<p>   down as to what kind of tax regime that should accompany the GST.</p>
<p>There were some producers who wanted one method, there were other</p>
<p>   producers, the majority, and certainly the majority that live in</p>
<p>   South Australia who wanted a different method and we adopted the</p>
<p>   latter method, not without some criticism from some small operators</p>
<p>   and a lot of operators in States like Western Australia.  Now</p>
<p>   I saw some people yesterday and will continue to examine what they're</p>
<p>   putting to us and I hope that we can persuade them that what we've</p>
<p>   done is fair.  </p>
<p> CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>But with regard to tax reform I saw one paper this morning really</p>
<p>   made a very good point, The</p>
<p>   Daily Telegraph in Sydney.  They say in their editorial</p>
<p>   "if ever there was an argument for tax reform it is the unfortunate</p>
<p>   effect that the current tax structure had on the $12 wage increase</p>
<p>   granted yesterday by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission.</p>
<p>The net result being that the average person would get $1.50, $1.50</p>
<p>   from the increase.  </p>
<p> PRIME</p>
<p>   MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I don't know whether that $1.50 is exactly right, but the</p>
<p>   line of argument is right.  The $10 or $12 is reduced by the</p>
<p>   tax you pay, but it can also be reduced if  </p>
<p>  you're getting a special family allowance</p>
<p>   supplement, and you go into a higher income bracket you can lose</p>
<p>   some of that.  Now one of the neglected elements of our tax</p>
<p>   plan is that we are increasing very significantly the cut off points</p>
<p>   for those extra family allowances so that you can earn more income</p>
<p>   without losing the family allowance supplement.  The other</p>
<p>   benefit of tax reform is that 80% of wage and salary earners in</p>
<p>   Australia, 80% will be on a top marginal rate of 30 cents in the</p>
<p>   dollar.  Now many of the people that were the subject of that</p>
<p>   projection by the Sydney Daily Telegraph editorial are paying 34</p>
<p>   cents at the margin.  Some people of course on higher incomes</p>
<p>   are paying 40 cents in the dollar, and of course at the top level</p>
<p>   47.  Now the really big tax reform is that 80%, 80% of Australian</p>
<p>   taxpayers will be on a top rate of 30 cents in the dollar.</p>
<p>Now you can't have that unless you have the whole package.</p>
<p>And that is an overwhelming argument as the Telegraph editorial</p>
<p>   says for taxation reform.  I mean we've got to keep coming</p>
<p>   back to the main game.  The main game is whether we're going</p>
<p>   to have a personal tax system that provides incentive, or we're</p>
<p>   going to have an efficient business tax GST system that helps our</p>
<p>   exporters and helps our businesses and makes us more competitive.</p>
<p>Now that is what is really at stake.  You can have a lot of</p>
<p>   emotional arguments about other issues but in the end are we going</p>
<p>   to have a modern competitive tax system or are we going, you know,</p>
<p>   rumble along with the present arrangement.  And that is what</p>
<p>   the Senate has got to decide.  And I mean that's what we took</p>
<p>   to the people.  </p>
<p> CORDEAUX:</p>
<p> Well you had the Premiers signing off..</p>
<p> PRIME</p>
<p>   MINISTER:</p>
<p>Every last one of them. Even the Labor Premiers.  They</p>
<p>   said: oh you realise Prime Minister we don't agree with this, where</p>
<p>   do we sign.  </p>
<p> CORDEAUX:</p>
<p> And the Senate is a States' house, all the States</p>
<p>   agreeing.  </p>
<p> PRIME</p>
<p>   MINISTER:   </p>
<p>  It was meant originally to be a States</p>
<p>   house.  But you had Peter Beattie and Bob Carr as enthusiastic</p>
<p>   about this as John Olsen and Jeff Kennett.  And they all lined</p>
<p>   up to sign.  Now you don't often get peace and harmony at a</p>
<p>   Premiers' Conference.  It was almost a political love-in they</p>
<p>   were so keen to have it.  And so they should be because over</p>
<p>   time the States will be a lot better off and they'll have more money</p>
<p>   for government schools, and for hospitals and for police.</p>
<p>More money than they get under the present system.  </p>
<p> CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>Have you ever been as passionate about anything as you are about</p>
<p>   this?  </p>
<p> PRIME</p>
<p>   MINISTER:   </p>
<p> No I don't think I have.  Except perhaps,</p>
<p>   since I've been Prime Minister, I was even more passionate about</p>
<p>   gun control.  </p>
<p> CORDEAUX:</p>
<p> Yes.  Would that passion if Senator Harradine</p>
<p>   is intent upon frustrating you.  I mean would that take you</p>
<p>   back to the people.  </p>
<p> PRIME</p>
<p>   MINISTER:</p>
<p>Jeremy I hope reason prevails.  I'm never afraid to face the</p>
<p>   people, but I've not long had an election and I don't think the</p>
<p>   Australian public wants another election.  Most of the Australian</p>
<p>   public thinks that they decided this issue in October last year.</p>
<p>Even those that voted against me believe that the issue was decided</p>
<p>   and they would like the Senate to get on with it and pass it and</p>
<p>   get onto something else.  </p>
<p> CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>  Well maybe we could run the whole thing a lot more</p>
<p>   cheaply if we just let Senator Harradine run the whole country.</p>
<p> PRIME</p>
<p>   MINISTER:   </p>
<p> Well Senator Harradine shouldn't incidentally</p>
<p>   cop all the blame.  If the Democrats and the Labor Party accepted</p>
<p>   the will of the people then Senator Harradine would be irrelevant.</p>
<p>It is their obstinancy as much as anything that is making him the</p>
<p>   central player.  </p>
<p> CORDEAUX:</p>
<p> A couple of other headlines that would please</p>
<p>   you I guess, the nation's GDP tipped to top the world's best which</p>
<p>   I think is impressive.  Inflation is down.  The economy</p>
<p>   looks like it is..  </p>
<p> PRIME</p>
<p>   MINISTER:   </p>
<p>  The economy is running very well.</p>
<p> CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>What sort of a surplus do you think we're going to have?</p>
<p> PRIME</p>
<p>   MINISTER:   </p>
<p>  Well we'll have a surplus.  I can't</p>
<p>   tell you.I have a rough idea of what it is so therefore I don't</p>
<p>   think I should speculate.  But we will have a surplus.</p>
<p> CORDEAUX:</p>
<p> But they are tipping that you're going to have</p>
<p>   a lot more money than you expected to have.  </p>
<p> PRIME</p>
<p>   MINISTER:   </p>
<p>  Well people always say that.</p>
<p> CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>  Now if you do, you might be able to be a bit more</p>
<p>   generous with the compensation package for..  </p>
<p> PRIME</p>
<p>   MINISTER:   </p>
<p> I think people should wait and see the figures.</p>
<p>Look Jeremy, it's a difficult time.  We're only a few weeks</p>
<p>   out.  I know what the figures are.  I've got to be careful</p>
<p>   how I respond to questions like that and you're perfectly entitled</p>
<p>   to try and get me to be careless.  </p>
<p> CORDEAUX:</p>
<p> Okay.  Well there are first signs also</p>
<p>   that your policy on getting more people into health insurance, or</p>
<p>   keeping..  </p>
<p> PRIME</p>
<p>   MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Yes the signs on that are good.  According,</p>
<p>   this is a survey not by the government but by the health insurance</p>
<p>   industry, they say at least 100,000.  And the other good news</p>
<p>   that I have today is that it's the first anniversary of the new</p>
<p>   improved privatised employment network, the Job Network, and I can</p>
<p>   report that it has been 50% more successful than the old Commonwealth</p>
<p>   Employment Service in finding work for people wanting a job.</p>
<p>50% more successful.  Now this was ridiculed and abused and</p>
<p>   subject to all sorts of criticism.  </p>
<p>  CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>But it deserved a bit of criticism in the early days.</p>
<p> PRIME</p>
<p>   MINISTER:   </p>
<p> Well okay, but something.this was a world first.</p>
<p>We were the first country in the world to try the comprehensive</p>
<p>   privatisation of the labour exchange system of a country.</p>
<p>We were the first nation on Earth to try this, and of course it</p>
<p>   was going to have some teething troubles.  I used those very</p>
<p>   words myself a year ago and it did.  But we're now through</p>
<p>   that stage and Tony Abbott, who deserves enormous credit for the</p>
<p>   job that he's done in relation to this since last October, he'll</p>
<p>   be issuing a report card on the job network at midday today.</p>
<p>But it has been a great success and it's 50% more successful in</p>
<p>   finding work than the CES.  </p>
<p> CORDEAUX:</p>
<p> Prime Minister if I could get you to put the</p>
<p>   headphones on.  Erwin from Mitchell Park, hi.</p>
<p> CALLER:</p>
<p> Good morning. Good morning Mr Prime Minister.</p>
<p> PRIME</p>
<p>   MINISTER:   </p>
<p> Good morning Erwin.  </p>
<p> CALLER:</p>
<p>  I'm on a disability pension and the thing</p>
<p>   is, if you've got one guy in the unit like I am in a housing trust,</p>
<p>   on a disability pension, and the guy next door's just on an ordinary</p>
<p>   single pension, every time he gets a rise it's okay because he's</p>
<p>   got no medical things to pay for, nothing like that.  I have</p>
<p>   to pay for massages and physio all out of my pension and the pension</p>
<p>   doesn't seem to go quite far enough.   </p>
<p> PRIME</p>
<p>   MINISTER:   </p>
<p> Your general medical expenses are covered are</p>
<p>   they?  </p>
<p> CALLER:</p>
<p> No.  </p>
<p> PRIME</p>
<p>   MINISTER:   </p>
<p> You have to pay for all of your medical expenses?</p>
<p>You have Medicare.  </p>
<p> CALLER:</p>
<p> [inaudible] public hospital and you can't always</p>
<p>   get there.  You can't get massages there, see.  And I</p>
<p>   go there for the swimming pool but if I don't have massages they</p>
<p>   reckon, because I'm not in a wheelchair, but if I don't have massages</p>
<p>   they reckon I'll be in a wheelchair within ten years, instead of</p>
<p>   40 years or 20 years.  </p>
<p> PRIME</p>
<p>   MINISTER:   </p>
<p> Is your disability the result of an accident,</p>
<p>   sir?  </p>
<p> CALLER:</p>
<p> I've got a crook back, and I've got a nerve</p>
<p>   growing in the backbone.  </p>
<p> PRIME</p>
<p>   MINISTER:   </p>
<p> I see.  </p>
<p> CALLER:</p>
<p>I would have done it when I was very young, [inaudible] cart</p>
<p>   milk around.  And I did a lot of lifting, then I went into</p>
<p>   baker and there's a lot of flour.  But I'm only 49 and I'm</p>
<p>   on a disability pension.  I have no super, no nothing to fall</p>
<p>   back on.  </p>
<p> PRIME</p>
<p>   MINISTER:   </p>
<p> Would you like to sent to me care of the station,</p>
<p>   no send it to me in Parliament House in Canberra, all of the details</p>
<p>   of your expenses and everything and the disadvantage you think you</p>
<p>   suffer in relation to an ordinary pension and I'll check all the</p>
<p>   facts out.  And I'm not saying I can change it but I will at</p>
<p>   least examine it and check out the facts.  </p>
<p> CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>  How are you Ken.  </p>
<p>  CALLER:</p>
<p>  Yes good morning.  </p>
<p>  PRIME</p>
<p>   MINISTER:   </p>
<p>  Good morning Ken.   </p>
<p>  CALLER:</p>
<p> Yes, good morning, Prime Minister, thank you</p>
<p>   very much indeed for giving the opportunity for people to speak</p>
<p>   to you on Jeremy's program.  Prime Minister, I was quite appalled</p>
<p>   a couple of weeks ago when you allowed 2000 Yugoslavs to remain</p>
<p>   in this country on extended visas because of the problem in Serbia</p>
<p>   at the present moment.  </p>
<p> PRIME</p>
<p>   MINISTER:   </p>
<p> I thought it was 200.  </p>
<p> CALLER:</p>
<p> Oh, was it?  Well, I'm sorry there.</p>
<p> PRIME</p>
<p>   MINISTER:   </p>
<p> I thought it was 200; it was a decision taken</p>
<p>   by the Immigration Minister.  My recollection, are you talking</p>
<p>   about people who were here at the time the conflict broke out or</p>
<p>   the 200?  I think, I'm sorry, on reflection, I think you're</p>
<p>   talking about some people here who were, who were sort of, who were</p>
<p>   here at the time the conflict broke out. </p>
<p> CALLER:</p>
<p>  Yes.</p>
<p> PRIME</p>
<p>   MINISTER:   </p>
