EMBARGOED AGAINST DELIVERY , lb. TPAL A. CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY<br />
1. 30P11<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
ADDRESS BY THE PRIME MINISTER BUSINESS-LUNCH, SYDNEY 23 NOVEMBER 19<br />
I VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TO SO<br />
MANY KEY REPRESENTATIVES OF THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY AND I<br />
THANK YOU ALL FOR THE SUPPORT YOU'VE SHOWN HERE TODAY.<br />
As BUSINESS PEOPLE YOU, AS MUCH AS ANYBODY, APPRECIATE THE<br />
DISTINCTION BETWEEN RHETORIC AND PERFORMANCE, BETWEEN<br />
PROMISING SOMETHING AND DELIVERING.<br />
SO IT IS WITH GREAT PRIDE THAT I'M ABLE TO COME BEFORE YOU-<br />
' WITH PAUL KEATINGo THE WORLD'S BEST TREASURER, AND WITH<br />
THE PRESIDENT OF OUR PARTY, PREMIER WRAN AND SAY: DURING<br />
OUR FIRST TERM THE HAWKE GOVERNMENT HAS DELIVERED THE<br />
ECONOMIC GOODS. IT'S WITH A GREAT SENSE OF ACHIEVEMENT<br />
.4<br />
THAT I SAY: WE HAVE HONOURED OUR tOMMITMENTS. IT'S WITH<br />
A GREAT DEAL OF PLEASURE THAT I SAY: IN ALL OF THE CENTRAL<br />
AREAS GROWTH. EMPLOYMENT, INFLATION, WAGES, INTEREST<br />
RATES, INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS THIS GOVERNMENT'S ECONOMIC<br />
PERFORMANCE HAS EXCEEDED EXPECTATIONS.<br />
THAT IS A TRULY REMARKABLE THING TO BE ABLE TO SAY. BUT<br />
IT UNDERLINES JUST HOW MUCH WE HAVE ACHIEVED TOGETHER.<br />
AND I SAY " TOGETHER" BECAUSE NOT FOR ONE MOMENT DO I BELIEVE<br />
THAT WE COULD HAVE ACHIEVED ANYTHING LIKE THE RESULTS WE<br />
HAVE WITHOUT THE SUPPORT OF THE COMMUNITY AND PARTICULARLY / 2. </p>
<p>2.<br />
THE SUPPORT, ON THE ONE HAND, OF THE TRADE UNION MOVEMENT,<br />
AND ON THE OTHER, OF YOU IN THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY.<br />
AND I APPRECIATE THAT SUPPORT VERY MUCH.<br />
THERE'S NO NEED FOR ME TO GIVE A LONG LIST OF STATISTICS<br />
ON WHAT'S HAPPENED IN OUR FIRST TERM BECA USE YOU IN THE<br />
BUSINESS COMMUNITY KNOW IT ALL. YOU KNOW THAT STRONG<br />
ECONOMIC GROWTH IS UNDERWAY. YOU KNOW THAT INFLATION<br />
HAS BEEN MORE THAN HALVED. YOU KNOW THAT I TfEREST RATES<br />
HAVE FALLEN. YOU KNOW THAT CONSUMER CONFIDENCE IS AT<br />
RECORD LEVELS. YOU KNOW THAT UNEMPLOYMENT IS FALLING.<br />
YOU KNOW THAT THE HOUSING INDUSTRY IS OPERATING AT<br />
PER CENT HIGHER LEVELS THAN TWO YEARS AGO, YOU KNOW<br />
THAT INDUSTRIAL DISPUTATION. JS THE LOWEST FOR MORE THAN<br />
A DECADE. YOU KNOW THAT AUSTRALIA HAS GONE FROM ECONOMIC<br />
DECLINE TO BEING THE WORLD'S NUMBER ONE<br />
ECONOMIC FRONTRUNNER. YOU KNdt4 ALL THAT.<br />
BUT IT IS NOT SIMPLY A MATTER OF IMPROVED STATISTICS.<br />
IT IS A MATTER OF A DRAMATIC ECONOMIC RESURGENCE WHICH<br />
HAS HELPED US PROVIDE GENUINE AND SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENTS<br />
IN THE LIVES: OF ORDINARY AUSTRALIAN FAMILIES:<br />
OVER 260A000 EW JOBS FOR THE PARENTS AND CHILDREN<br />
IN<br />
OF AUSTRALIAN FAMILIES<br />
60,000 AUSTRALIAN FAMILIES ASSISTED WITH HOME<br />
OWNERSHIP UNDER OUR FIRST HOME OWNERS SCHEME </p>
<p>400,000 AUSTRALIAN FAMILIES PREVIOUSLY WITHOUT<br />
ANY FORM OF HEALTH COVER NOW PROVIDED FOR THROUGH<br />
MEDICARE OUR NEW 8 YEAR EDUCATION FUNDING PLAN TO GUARANTEE EVERY<br />
AUSTRALIAN FAMILY THE RIGHT TO'A GOOD EDUCATION FOR THEIR<br />
CHILDREN IN EITHER THE PUBLIC QR PRIVATE SCHOOL SYSTEMS<br />
A 40 PER CENT INCREASE IN THE; FAMILY INCOME<br />
SUPPLEMENT BENEFITTING 30,000 OF AUSTRALIA'S MOST NEEDY<br />
FAMILIES<br />
MAJOR INCREASES IN PROVISION FOR PENSIONERS WHO<br />
RENT ACCOMMODATION AND FOR OTHER PENSIONERS IN GREATEST<br />
NEED TAX CUTS FOR EVERY tAXPAYING AUSTRAL. IAN FAMILY FOR MOST<br />
A REDUCTION OF $ 7.60 A WEEK<br />
A ONE PER CENT CUT IN HOUSING INTEREST RATES SAVING<br />
A FAMILY WITH A $ 30,000 MORTGAGE MORE THAN $ 20 A<br />
MONTH. AND CUTS IN OTHER INTEREST RATES OF UP TO AROUND<br />
3 PER CENT.<br />
THESE ARE THE ECONOMIC REALITIES THAT MATTER TO ORDINARY<br />
AUSTRALIAN FAMILIES%-JOBSS HOUSING, HEALTH, EDUCATION, TAXATION.<br />
INFLATIOF AND INTEREST RATES@ </p>
<p>AND THESE ARE THE THINGS WE ARE DELIVERING TO AUSTRALIANS<br />
AS PART OF THE SAME GREAT PROGRAM THROUGH<br />
WHICH WE ARE DELIVERING EFFECTIVE ECONOMIC MANAGEMENT<br />
TO YOU IN THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY.<br />
I SUBMIT THERE IS NOT A PERSON HERE INDEED NOT A SINGLE OBJECTIVE<br />
AUSTRALIAN ANYWHERE WHO WOULD NOT AGREE THAT AUSTRALIA<br />
IS NOW A HEALTHIER, STRONGER, HAPPIER NATION THAN IT WAS<br />
TWENTY MONTHS AGO.<br />
AND WHATEVER POLITICAL AFFILIATIONS YOU MAY HAVE, I KNOW<br />
THAT ALL OF YOU, AS SINCERE AND COMMITTED AUSTRALIANS,<br />
WELCOME THAT PROGRESS. I KNOW YOU WANT US TO CONSOLIDATE<br />
AND BUILD ON THAT PROGRESS AND ENSURE THE EXTRAORDINARY<br />
POTENTIAL OF OUR NATION IS REALISED TO THE FULL.<br />
Now, AFTER A PERIOD OF SJCH REMARKABLE RESURGENCE IT IS<br />
' S<br />
VERY EASY TO FORGET THE STAGNATION AND ECONOMIC DECLINE<br />
OF AUSTRALIA WHEN WE WERE OLLED TO OFFICE. IT IS VERY<br />
EASY TO FORGET THAT INVESTMENT WAS DRYING UP, THAT DEMAND<br />
WAS SHRINKING, THAT ECONOMIC GROWTH HAD CEASED ALTOGETHER,<br />
THAT JOBS WERE DISAPeEARING AT A DEVASTATING RATE, THAT<br />
WHOLE INDUSTRIES WERE BEING THREATENED WITH EXTINCTION.<br />
BUT THAT SORRY STATE OF\, AUSTRALIA THAT STAGNATION AND<br />
DECLINE IS STILL A, DESTINY VERY MUCH OPEN TO OUR NATION.<br />
BUT'IT IS A DESTINY WE NEED TO REJECT DECISIVELY. AND ON<br />
DECEMBER 1, I BELIEVE WE WILL. </p>
<p>IN MY POLICY SPEECH A WEEK AND A HALF AGO I SPELT OUT<br />
KEY ELEMENTS OF MY GOVERNMENT'S PROPOSALS TO SUSTAIN<br />
STRONG GROWTH, NOT FOR ONE OR TWO YEARS, BUT OVER THE<br />
TERM OF THE NEXT GOVERNMENT, AND MANY YEARS BEYOND.<br />
AUSTRALIA NEEDS A GENERATION OF STRONG SUSTAINED<br />
NON-INFLATIONARY ECONOMIC GROWTH.<br />
I NOW GIVE YOU IN THE BUSINESS COMMUNIVTY-ONE VERY SIMPLE<br />
BUT. VERY FUNDAMENTAL UNDERTAKING. DURING OUR SECOND<br />
TERM THIS GOVERNMENT WILL DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO CONTINUE<br />
THE MOMENTUM OF ECONOMIC GROWTH THAT HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED<br />
OVER THESE LAST TWENTY MONTHS.<br />
THIS GOVERNMENT IS A GOVERNMENT OF ECONOMIC GROWTH AND<br />
THE LABOR PARTY IS THE PARTY OF ECONOMIC GROWTH. AND WE<br />
DON'T'APOLOGISE TO ANYBODY FOR THAT.<br />
BUT WE DON'T SEEK ECONOMIC GROWTH MERELY FOR ITS OWN SAKE.<br />
RATHER WE SEEK IT BECAUSE tJE KNOW THAT ECONOMIC GROWTH<br />
IS CRUCIAL TO ACHIEVING A FAIRER AND MORE EQUITABLE SOCIETY,<br />
WITH HIGHER LIVING STANDARDS FOR ALL AUSTRALIANS.<br />
GROWTH MEANS HIGHER WAGES AND BETTER CONDITIONS FOR<br />
AUSTRALIAN WORKERS. -GROWTH MEANS IMPROVED CAPACITY TO RAISE<br />
PENSIONS AND TO PROVIDE FOR THOSE IN NEED. GROWTH MEANS\ A<br />
MORE COHESIVE SOCIETy WITH LESS PRESSURE FOR DEBILITATING<br />
CONFLICTS OVER INCOME SHARES. AND GROWTH MEANS MORE JOBS<br />
FOR AUSTRALIANS YOUNG AND OLD. AND ALL THIS DERIVES FROM A<br />
PROFITABLEo EXPANDING PRIVATE SECTOR WHICH NOW ePROVIDES AND<br />
INTO tHE FORESEEABLE FUTURE WILL. CONTINUE TO PROVIDE<br />
THREE OUT OF EVERY FOUR JOBS. 6, </p>
<p>I FIRML. Y BELIEVE THAT AUSTRALIA H-AS AN OPPORTUNITY NOW TO<br />
BUILD A NEW ERA OF GROWT-t DEVELOPMENT AND PROSPERITY,<br />
BUT TRANSLATING OPPORTUNITY INTO REALITY IS QUITE ANOTHER<br />
MATTER. IT REQUIRES CONTINUED BALANCED -FISCAL AND MONETARY<br />
POLICY, PLUS EFFORTS TO PROVIDE INCREASED PRODUCTIVITY<br />
AND INCREASED EFFORT IN OUR MOST PRODUCTIVE INDUSTRIES.<br />
IT REQUIRES AUSTRALIANS TO BE CONFIDENT". IN THEMSELVES AND<br />
IN * THE COUNTRY IN WHICH THEY LIVE,, SO THAT THEY TAKE RISKS<br />
NOW IN THE EXPECTATION OF FUTURE REWARD." IT REQUIRES<br />
CO-OPERATION AMONG THE GREAT ELEMENTS OF THE AUSTRALIAN<br />
ECONOMY, SO THAT OUR EFFORTS ARE DEVOTED TO INCREASING<br />
PRODUCTION RATHER THAN BEING DISSIPATED IN CONFLICT.<br />
UNDER OUR GOVERNMENT THESE ESSENTIAL ELEMENTS OF A GROWTHPRODUCING<br />
ENVIRONMENT HAVE BEEN AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE<br />
PRESENT. BUT WE SHOULD NOT BE FOOLED THAT BECAUSE THESE<br />
CONDITIONS EXIST NOW.-THEY WILL AUTOMATICALLY CONTINUE IN<br />
THE FUTURE. WHAT YOU IN THE.% BUSINESS COMMUNITY KNOW ALREADYAND<br />
WHAT THE AUSTRALIAN PEOPLE NEED TO UNDERSTAND IS JUST<br />
HOW EASY IT WOULD BE TO " BLOW" THE ECONOMIC RECOVERY WITH<br />
THE WRONG POLICIES. WHAT AUSTRALIA SIMPLY CANNOT AFFORD AT<br />
THIS CRITICAL TIME IN OUR HISTORY IS COMPLACENCY.<br />
CERTAINLY WE CAN'T AWORD THE COMPLACENCY OF OUR<br />
POLITICAL OPPONENTS WHO WOULD IMPOSE RADICAL AND DANGEROUS<br />
CHANGES IN OUR WAGE FIXATION ARRANGEMENTS FOR PURELY<br />
IDEOLOGICAL REASONS. 4 s 5 / 7 </p>
<p>THERE IS ONE THING WE CAN LEARN FROM THE ' ORRY ECONOMIC<br />
EXPERIENCE OF THE 1970' s AND 80' S, IT IS THE NEED FOR A<br />
CO-ORDINATED APPROACH TO WAGES AND OTHER IIFCOME CLAIMS,<br />
THAT IS WHAT WE HAVE ACHIEVED AND THAT IS WHAT OUR<br />
OPPONENTS WOULD DESTROY.<br />
IN LAST WEEK'S POLICY SPEECH I SAID THAT bNDEi' THE LABOR<br />
GOVERNMENT'S POLICIES, EMPLOYMENT WOULD EXPAND MORE RAPIDLY<br />
THAT THE LABOUR FORCE SO THAT UNEMPLOYMENT'CON1INUED TO FALL.<br />
I AM CONFIDENT THAT THE HIGH GROWTH ANTICIPATED OR THE CURRENT<br />
FINANCIAL YEAR IN THE 1984-85 BUDGET WILL BE EXCEEDED, LARGELY<br />
BECAUSE OF STRONGER THAN EXPECTED CONTRIBUTIONS B" PRIVATE<br />
CONSUMPTION AND PRIVATE INVESTMENT,<br />
PRIVATE CONSUMPTION WAS STRONGER THAN ANTICIPATED It' THE<br />
SEPTEMBER QUARTER, AND THAT WAS BEFORE THE TAX CUTS ' ND<br />
INCREASES IN SOCIAL SECURITY PAYMENTS EARLIER THIS MClTH.<br />
IT IS CLEAR FROM RECENT SURVEYS OF INVESTMENT AND INVE3TMENT<br />
EXPECTATIONS THAT THE BUDGET ESTIMATE OF 5 PER CENT GRC'WTH<br />
IN PRIVATE INVESTMENT WILL BE EXCEEDED. I SAY THIS FOL,.. OWING<br />
ANALYSIS OF YESTERDAY'S DATA ON NEW FIXED CAPITAL EXPENI TURE,<br />
WHICH SHOWS A WEAKER OUTCOME FOR THE SEPTEMBER QUARTER 1i84;.<br />
BUT A MUCH STRONGER OUTtOOK FOR THE DECEMBER QUARTER AND 1984-85<br />
AS A WHOLE. THIS RESULT IMPLIES A STRONG BUILD-UP INPRIV. TE<br />
INVESTMENT THROUGH THE YEAR, CARRYING FORWARD INTO AND LAY. NG<br />
A STRONG FOUNDATION FOR RAPID ECONOMIC GROWTH IN A935-85. </p>
<p>ONE REMARKABLE FEATURE ABOUT THE STRONG AUSTRALIAN ECONOMIC<br />
RECOVERY SINCE MID-1983 IS THAT THE AUSTRALIAN ECONOMY HAS HAD<br />
RECORD GROWTH DESPITE SUBDUED PERFORMANCE FROM THE RESOURCES<br />
SECTOR, WE HAVE HAD STRONG GROWTH IN RURAL PRODUCTION; IN PRIVATE<br />
SERVICES, LED BY THE GOVERNMENT'S INNOVATIVE AND INTENSIVE<br />
PROMOTION OF TOURISM; IN GOVERNMENT SERVICESs IN HOUSING; AND<br />
IN MANUFACTURING.<br />
BUT SINCE THE COLLAPSE OF THE DISASTROUSLY MANAGED " RESOURCES<br />
BOOM" OF THE LATE COALITION YEARS, INVESTMENT IN THE RESOURCES<br />
SECTOR HAS BEEN DEPRESSED. THIS HAS DRAGGED DOWN THOSE PARTS<br />
OF THE MANUFACTURING SECTOR WHICH SUPPLY RESOURCE PROJECTS,<br />
MOST NOTABLY HEAVY ENGINEERING.<br />
As I EXPLAINED IN DETAIL YN WESTERN AUSTRALIA ON MONDAY, THE<br />
OUTLOOK FOR RESOURCES INVE. TMENT HAS STRENGTHENED RECENTLY.<br />
OVER THE PAST THREE MONTHS, SIX MAJOR RESOURCES DEVELOPMENTS<br />
TO THE VALUE OF ABOUT $ 15 BILLION HAVE MOVED FROM BEING GOOD<br />
IDEAS TO BEING CONSIDERED BY THEIR PRIVATE SPONSORS AS CERTAIN<br />
TO PROCEED THROUGH 1985.<br />
ON TOP OF THE STRONG'GROWTH MOMENTUM IN OTHER SECTORS, THIS NEW<br />
STRENGTH IN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT UNDERWRITES CONFIDENCEIN HIGH<br />
LEVELS OF OVERALL ECONOMIC GROWTH THROUGH NEXT FINANCIAL YEAR AND<br />
BEYOND. BUT LET ME MAKE ONE POINT CLEAR: THIS GOVERNMENT DOES NOT LOOK<br />
TO EXPANSION IN THE RESOURCES SECTOR ALONE PrR MAINTAINING<br />
STRONG GROWTH IN THE AUSTRALIAN ECONOMY* </p>
<p>WE ARE SEEKING TO PROMOTE STRONG PERFORMANCE ACROSS ALL SECTORS,<br />
AND NOT A LOP-SIDED RESOURCES BOOM.<br />
IT WAS THE HEIGHT OF FOOLISHNESS FOR THE LIBERAL AND NATIONAL<br />
PARTIES IN GOVERNMENT TO BELIEVE THAT STRONG GROWTH IN ONE<br />
SECTOR COULD SOLVE THE PROBLEMS THAT THEY'H-AD CREATED FOR<br />
AUSTRALIA. WE. ARE SEEKING WELL-BALANCED GfROWTH IN AUSTRALIA,<br />
WITH. ALL SECTORS CONTRIBUTING THEIR PARTICULAR STRENGTHS,<br />
STRONG ECONOMIC GROWTH BASED ON RAPIDLY EXPANDING PRIVATE<br />
INVESTMENT INCREASES THE IMPORTANCE OF REDUCING THE<br />
BUDGET DEFICIT NEXT YEAR. GIVEN OUR COMMITMENT NOT TO INCREASE<br />
THE OVERALL TAX BURDEN, THIS WILL BE ACHIEVED BY HOLDING THE<br />
RATE OF GROWTH IN GOVERNMENT EXPENDITURE BELOW THE RATE OF<br />
GROWTH OF THE ECONOMY. THIS " TRIO" OF FISC AL COMMITMENTS HAS<br />
BEEN INTERPRETED BY SOME COMMgNTATORS AS A CONSTRAINT ON<br />
REFORMS TO INCREASE EQUITY IN AUSTRALIA. I REJECT THAT<br />
COMPLETELY. THE FULFILLMENT 4OUR dOMMITMENTS ' IS TOTALLY<br />
CONSISTENT WITH CONTINUED REFORM IN THE.-SERVICES PROVIDED BY<br />
GOVERNMENT TO THE PEOPLE OF AUSTRALIA THROUGH USING WISELY<br />
THE MODEST GROWTH IN REAL OUTLAYS THAT WILL STILL OCCUR, AND<br />
THROUGH FIRM DISCIPLINE IN THE ASSERTION OF PROPER PRIORITIES<br />
IN THE BUDGET-MAKING PROCESS. I a410/ 1 </p>
<p>IT IS A DANGEROUS ILLUSION TO BELIEVE THAT UNCONTROLLED<br />
EXPANSION OF GOVERNMENT SPENDING IS NECESSARY FOR REFORM<br />
DESIGNED TO MAKE AUSTRALIA A FAIRER AND BETTER SOCIETY.<br />
THE EFFECTIVENESS OF EXPENDITURE IN RELLJCING POVERTY, PROVIDING<br />
SERVICES OF VALUE TO THE COMMUNITY AND OTHERWISE CONTRIBUTING<br />
TO IMPROVEMENTS IN THE LIFE OF OUR SOCIETY, DEPENDS NO MORE ON<br />
ITS AMOUNT THAN ON THE WISDOM WITH WHICH IT IS ALLOCATED AMONG<br />
COMPETING PRIORI'TIES.<br />
THIS GOVERNMENT IN OUR FIRST TERM HAS ALREADY DONE MUCH FOR<br />
THE POOR AND THE DISADVANTAGED, AND FOR THE LOW AND MIDDLE<br />
INCOME EARNERS. IN FRAMING OUR LAST BUDGET,-WE TOOK THE VIEW<br />
THAT THE HIGHEST PRIORITY FOR NEW OUTLAYS SHOULD BE GIVEN<br />
TO SOCIAL WELFARE RECIPIENTS. AND SO WE PROVIDED MORE THAN<br />
$ 1 BILLION ADDITIONAL FUNDING IN A FULL FINANCIAL YEAR FOR<br />
WELFARE BENEFICIARIES. THE TAX CUTS, NOW BEING ENJOYED BY ALL<br />
AUSTRALIANS, ARE HIGHLY PROGRESSIVE AND LOW AND MIDDLE INCOME<br />
EARNERS ARE RECEIVING THE ~ RAETBNFT. THE MEDICARE<br />
LEVY IS ALSO HIGHLY PROGRESSIVE, WITH THE LOWEST COSTS FOR<br />
HEALTH SERVICES BEING LEVIED ON THOSE WHO HAVE THE LEAST<br />
CAPACITY TO PAY.<br />
AND SO I PUT IT TO YOU: THESE ARE THE ACTIONS OF A GOVERNMENT<br />
FOR WHOM A FAIRER AND\, MORE EQUITABLE SOCIETY BASED ON STRON4G<br />
AND SUSTAINABLE ECONOMIC GROWTH IS THE HIGHEST PRIORITY.<br />
0<br />
I WANT NOW TO CONCLUDE WITH THIS OBSERVATION </p>
<p>THROUGHOUT THIS ELECTION CAMPAIGN I HAVE DELIBERATELY AVOIDED<br />
RESORT TO EXTRAVAGANT CLAIMS ABOUT AUSTRALIA'S FUTURE. ALL<br />
POLITICIANS LIKE TO BE THE BEARERS OF GOOD NEWS AND I CLAIM<br />
NO EXCEPTION FOR MYSELF ON THAT SCORE. -BUT I HAVE BEEN VERY<br />
CAREFUL NOT TO MAKE ANY CLAIMS ABOUT WHICH I CANNOT BE<br />
ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN.<br />
Too OFTEN IN THE PAST, AUSTRALIANS HAVE BEEN PROMISED A POT OF<br />
GOLD AT THE END OF THE ELECTION RAINBOWS<br />
Too OFTEN, THEY HAVE BEEN PROMISED POST-ELECTION-DAY BOOMS<br />
AND BONANZAS.<br />
Too OFTEN, THEY HAVE HAD THEIR EXPECTATIONS LIFTED TO EXTREME<br />
HEIGHTS BY OUR ELECTIONEERING CONSERVATIVE OPPONENTS ONLY<br />
TO SUFFER EVENTUAL DISAPPOINTMENT.<br />
To PUT IT BLUNTLY, AUSTRALIt AND AUSTRALIANS HAVE BEEN HOAXED<br />
TOO OFTEN.<br />
EVEN THOUGH I BELIEVq MY GOVERNMENT HAS THE BEST STORY TO<br />
TELL FOR VERY MANY YEARSo I WILL HAVE NO PART OF NEEDLESS<br />
EXAGGERATION. </p>
<p>12.<br />
I AM CONTENT TO LET OUR RECORD OF THE FIRST 20 MONTHS SPEAK<br />
FOR ITSELF BOTH AS A TESTAMENT TO OUR SKILLS AS A GOVERNMENT<br />
AND A POINTER TO THE FUTURE. WE HAVE THE DETERMINATION TO<br />
STICK TO THE ROUTE WE HAVE PLOTTED AND THE DISCIPLINE TO SEE<br />
THE TASK THROUGH TO THE END.<br />
HAVING SAID THOSE THINGS, LET ME MAKE IT VERY CLEAR THAT MY<br />
RETICENCE TO ENGAGE IN BLOATED RHETORIC AND NEEDLESS HYPE<br />
HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH PESSIMISM.<br />
INDEED I GO BEFORE THE PEOPLE ON DECEMBER 1 AS A PRIME<br />
MINISTER FULL TO THE BRIM WITH OPTIMISM FOR OUR COUNTRY<br />
CALM OPTIMISM BASED ON FACTS, FIGURES AND INFORMATION.<br />
WE ARE, I BELIEVE, AT THIS VERY MOMENT, LAYING THE<br />
FOUNDATIONS FOR A NEW ERA OF GREATNESS IN AUSTRALIA. NOT THE LUCKY<br />
COUNTRY BUT A COUNTRY WHERE GREATNESS, WILL HAVE BEEN ACHIEVED<br />
BY DEDICATED AND COMMITTED CO-OPERATION IN HARNESSING TO<br />
THEIR FULL OUR UNRIVALLED HUMAN AND MATERIAL RESOURCES.<br />
ALREADY, WE ARE REBUILDING THOSE PRECIOUS ASSETS<br />
CONFIDENCE AND BELIEF IN OURSELVES. WE ARE REBUILDING<br />
SHATTERED INDUSTRIES. ALREADY, RENEWED PROSPERITY IS<br />
BEGINNING TO FLOW FROM RENEWED GROWTH.<br />
REAL PROSPERITY PROSPERITY RESULTING FROM GROWTH*<br />
CO-OPERATIVE PLANNINGs INCREASED PRODUCTIVITY AND TRADE<br />
WILL FLOW'TO ALL AUSTRALIANS. .,. 113. </p>
<p>THROUGH GROWTH AND PROSPERITY WE CAN ATTACK UNEMPLOYMENT,<br />
POVERTY, HARDSHIP,-AND INEQUALITY OF OPPORTUNITY,<br />
EXPAND AND IMPROVE OUR EDUCATION AND HEALTH SYSTEMS,<br />
LIFT OUR SUPPORT FOR PENSIONERS, EASE THE TAX BURDEN<br />
OF MIDDLE AND LOW INCOME EARNERS AND CONSISTENTLY AND<br />
STEADILY LIFT OUR STANDARD OF LIVING.<br />
WE HAVE MADE GREAT STRIDES, NO LONGER. ARE WE AS WE<br />
WE. RE, JUST 20 MONTHS AGO A NATION HANGING ON AND HOPING<br />
TO SURVIVE. WE ARE ON THE ROAD BACK.<br />
OUR NATIONAL ENDEAVOURS ARE NO LONGER A POINTLESS EXERCISE<br />
OF KIDDING OURSELVES THAT SOMETHING WILL TURN UP. WE<br />
ARE PROGRESSING NOW IN AN ORDERLY PLANNED WAY. WE HAVE<br />
NATIONAL TARGETS, NATIONAL ASPIRATIONS -AND WE ARE MOVING<br />
RESOLUTELY TOWARDS THEM.<br />
AS A NATION, AUSTRALIA IS WINNING AGAIN. AND THAT MEANS<br />
AUSTRALIANS ARE THE WINNER.<br />
As I SAID, I APPROACH 1985 BRIM FULL OF OPTIMISM OPTIMISTIC<br />
NOT ABOUT SOME UNREAL MAGIC-WAND SOLUTION TO OUR PROBLEMS<br />
BUT ABOUT THE WAY WE ARE WORKING TOWARDS REAL AND LASTING<br />
SOLUTIONS. OPTIMISTIC NOT THAT THERE' IS A FLASHY, PATCHY BOOM AROUND<br />
THE CORNER BUT THAT AUSTRALIA WILL STEADILY AND ENDURIN~ GLY<br />
GROW RICHER AND STRONGER. A BETTER COUNTRY FOR ALL<br />
AUSTRALIANS. * 40* ee* </p>
