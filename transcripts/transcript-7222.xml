FOR ESDEIPAT1E3M BER 1987<br />
EMBARGOED UNTIL 6.00 PM, 13 SEPTEMBER 1987<br />
The terms of all non-Commonwealth members of the Economic<br />
Planning and Advisory Council have now expired and I today<br />
announce the membership of the new Council.<br />
Consistent with the rotational arrangements provided in the<br />
EPAC Act, Premiers Unsworth, Bannon and Gray have now been<br />
appointed for a two year term. These replace Premiers Cain<br />
and Burke and Chief Minister Hatton.<br />
The EPAC Act requires that non-Government membe-rs be<br />
appointed following consultations with certain industry and<br />
community groups.<br />
I am pleased that a number of members of the previous<br />
Council have been renominated by the relevant organisations<br />
and have agreed to accept reappointment, providing an<br />
invaluable element of continuity to the Council's work.<br />
These are:<br />
Messrs Crean, Kelty and MacBean and Mrs Marsh ( appointed<br />
after consultation with the ACTU);<br />
Mr B Kelman ( business organisations);<br />
Mr F Davidson ( rural industry);<br />
Ms L Cutts ( The Council of Local Government<br />
Associations); and<br />
Mr, 3 Disney ( welfare organisations).<br />
The new non-Government members are:<br />
Mr W. J. Bailey<br />
Mr A. R. Jackson<br />
Mr H. Rose<br />
ms P. Smith ( Group Managing Director and Chief<br />
Executive officer, ANZ Bank);<br />
( Managing Director, BTR Nylex<br />
Limited); ( Management Consultant, Horwath and<br />
Horwath Service Pty); and<br />
( Policy and Public Affairs manager,<br />
Australian Consumers' Association) 00101<br />

Messrs Bailey and Jackson were appointed after consultation<br />
with business groups, while Mr Rose and Ms Smith were<br />
appointed after consultation with representatives of small<br />
business and consumer/ community organisations respectively.<br />
They, in turn, replace Messrs Coates, Hughes and Gibbons and<br />
Dr Braithwaite.<br />
The non-Government members have been appointed to four-year<br />
terms. As in the past the Commonwealth will be represented by<br />
myself, the Treasurer, Paul Keating and the Minister for<br />
Industrial Relations, Ralph Willis.<br />
I take this opportunity to thank all of the retiring members<br />
for the valuable contribution which they have made to the<br />
work of EPAC over their terms of appointment.<br />
The Economic Planning Advisory Council was established in<br />
1983 to continue the process of consultation and information<br />
exchange started at the National Economic Summit Conference.<br />
It has proved to be an important forum for consultation and<br />
debate on issues vital to Australia's economic performance<br />
in the medium and longer term. Although the Government has<br />
consulted a number of groups in deciding the membership of<br />
the Council, members are appointed in their personal<br />
capacity and for their ability contribute to the work of the<br />
Council. The new members bring a range of experience and talents to<br />
the Council and are to be congratulated for their<br />
willingness to serve the community in this way. I look<br />
forward to the next meeting of EPAC which will be held in<br />
Canberra on 6 November 1987. o0(). I1 </p>
