[ Fromn the " Parliamentary Debates," 4th May 1965]<br />
Sir ROBERT MENZIES ( Kooyong-<br />
Prime Minister) Speaker, I have<br />
listened to the speech of the Leader of the<br />
Opposition ( Mr. Caiwell) with acute depression.<br />
' It seemed to me to demonstrate<br />
an approach to these great and vital<br />
problems that I would hardly ' have expected<br />
to hear described in this place. Indeed, he<br />
summed it all up in the second last paragraph<br />
of his speech. May I remind the<br />
House'that he said-<br />
Let me sum up. We believe that America must<br />
not be humiliated and must not be forced to<br />
withdraw. Having said that by way of summary, he<br />
has said that in the clear view of ' his party<br />
America should be required to go it alone<br />
with no assistance from us. That, really,<br />
is a pretty neat, short summary of the speech<br />
that he has made. I will come back to it<br />
because there are a few things that should<br />
, be put straight on the record, if they need<br />
to be put straight.<br />
The first thing that I want to mention,<br />
as briefly as may be, is ; the grievance with<br />
which he began. It is quite true ' that he<br />
did not elaborate it today. I am supposed<br />
to have concealed from the Leader of the<br />
Opposition and the Deputy Leader of ' the<br />
Opposition ( Mr. Whitlam) the fact that I<br />
161/ 65 was going to make a statement on Thursday<br />
night. He did not say much about it today<br />
but has been very vocal about it in other<br />
places; so there is a widespread belief<br />
entertained ' by some people who are<br />
apparently willing to believe anything that<br />
this was, for some low cunning political<br />
-reason, concealed from them and that I<br />
sprang it on Thursday at 8 o'clock. I just<br />
want to say something about that because<br />
it will be useful for honorable members to<br />
become aware of the basis of discussions<br />
* between governments, because ' these allegations<br />
display a woeful ignorance of how<br />
things are done between governments and<br />
between nations. The announcement of the<br />
provision of fighting forces by us for South<br />
Vietnam was not one that could be made<br />
without a great deal of preparatory discussion,<br />
not only on ' the military level but<br />
also on the political level where ' the last<br />
responsible decisions have to be made. It<br />
has to be remembered that Australia has<br />
commitments as a member of the South<br />
East Asia Treaty Organisation and that one<br />
of the protocol nations under S. E.* A. T. O.<br />
is South Vietnam. We have commitments in<br />
respect of Malaysia which have been fully<br />
stated and debated in this House. We have<br />
joint interests with the United States of<br />
America and with New Zealand under the </p>
<p>Security Treaty between Australia, New<br />
Zealand ' and the United States of America,<br />
and we : have, of course, a responsibility<br />
for the defence of Australia, including<br />
Papua and New Guinea. So we have a<br />
variety of responsibilities, each of them<br />
importing some contingency that may or<br />
may not arise.<br />
1 had some exchanges with President<br />
Johnson towards the end of last year in<br />
which the possibility of increased military<br />
activity was envisaged and in the course of<br />
which we agreed that there should be, at a<br />
suitable time, discussions on the military<br />
level. These took place, in fact, in March<br />
and the result of the talks was available<br />
to us early in April. We made our formal<br />
decision in principle on 7th April, that<br />
decision being that we would be willing to<br />
provide a battalion, should it be requested<br />
and should all the circumstances render its<br />
employment useful, fitting in with the<br />
general pattern of what was being done. So<br />
it was a decision in principle. But that was<br />
not the end of the matter. Before an actual<br />
decision could be announced, discussions<br />
had to occur with the various governments<br />
with which we are associated and, in particular,<br />
with the Government of the United<br />
Kingdom, the Government of the United<br />
States and the Government of South Vietnam.<br />
A great number of broad details had<br />
to be considered and certain more detailed<br />
arrangements made at the government level.<br />
Very properly, I wanted to have all these<br />
matters quite clearly established before<br />
making any announcement to the House.<br />
I need not elaborate. All of us who are<br />
familiar with this kind of international discussion<br />
will realise that not one of us is<br />
entirely his own master in respect of the<br />
timetable. Statements have to be synchronised<br />
very frequently in one country and<br />
another, and any statement made would<br />
need to be made with the concurrence<br />
of Sou'th Vietnam, as the nation<br />
requesting our help, with the United States,<br />
with whose troops ours would be associated<br />
in South Vietnam, and with the United<br />
Kingdom, which has accepted great responsibilities<br />
in relation to Malaysia where we<br />
have already made a substantial contribution.<br />
So we have the three governments.<br />
When on Wednesday of last week a story<br />
about the battalion broke in sections of the<br />
Press, I felt a great deal of embarrassment because the time -had not quite arrived<br />
when I could feel that our relevant discussions<br />
had concluded. On Wednesday a<br />
rumour was circulated ' that I would be<br />
making a statement on Thursday night and<br />
that that statement would relate to the provision<br />
of an Australian battalion. At that<br />
time I literally did not know whether I<br />
could be ready -by Thursday night. The<br />
Leader of the Opposition inquired at my<br />
office on Thursday morning at a time when<br />
I was heavily engaged on a matter of some<br />
urgency. He said he would like , to know<br />
what was happening. That was a very<br />
reasonable request, I thought. He said that<br />
he had plans to go to Sydney in connection<br />
with the election campaign and could hardly<br />
change them. He added that he thought<br />
t'h't any statement might be made or could<br />
be made on Tuesday night, that is, tonight.<br />
After this ' had ' been conveyed to me, the<br />
Leader of the Opposition was -told that it<br />
was possible that I would ' be making a<br />
statement on Thursday night ' but : that it was<br />
not certain and : that when I knew definitely<br />
I would -let ' him know. He was told that if<br />
I found myself in a position ' to make a<br />
statement I would hope to be in a position<br />
to give him the ' text of it -by 5.30 p. m. I<br />
' follow these rules, if I may say so, very<br />
strictly. At 4.45 p. m. the Leader of the<br />
Opposition -inquired again as to whether<br />
there were any further developments as ' he<br />
and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition<br />
were about to leave for Sydney. He was<br />
told that ' it was still not certain ' that I would<br />
be in a position ' to make a statement-it<br />
was possible, even probable, but not yet<br />
certain. The Leader of the Opposition said<br />
that he was leaving the honorable member<br />
for Melbourne Ports ( Mr. Crean) in<br />
charge and -asked if I would let the honorable<br />
member for Melbourne Ports know<br />
of any further development. This I agreed<br />
to do. I think the Leader of the Opposition<br />
would agree that that is a straightforward<br />
narrative of what occurred.<br />
The final international messages which I<br />
thought I should have before making a<br />
statement arrived at something after 5.30<br />
and I then decided that I would make<br />
the statement at 8 o'clock. The honorable<br />
member for Melbourne ' Ports, who was leading<br />
the Opposition in the absence of -the<br />
Leader, was informed of this as soon as<br />
possible and was told : that ' the text ' would be<br />
available ' to him at 7 o'clock, and this was </p>
<p>done. The result of all this was that when I<br />
made my statement I was in a position to do<br />
so with the approval of the President of the<br />
United States, the Prime Minister of Great<br />
Britain and the Prime Minister of South Vietnam.<br />
I will not need to say to honorable<br />
members that, in view of the spread of newspaper<br />
headlines on this matter, I simply<br />
could not defer my statement until today,<br />
without acute embarrassment to myself and<br />
to the other governments concerned. Clearly,<br />
I could not have made my statement over<br />
the weekend because it is in this Parliament<br />
that such a statement ought to be made.<br />
This Parliament is entitled to hear all of<br />
these matters direct and to have the opportunity<br />
of debating them. Therefore, the<br />
choice was to make the statement on Thursday<br />
or -to let all the rumours flourish, to<br />
let the news go on breaking all around the<br />
world and then come along today and make<br />
the statement.<br />
Mr. Clyde Camnieron.--How did the<br />
Press get the news?<br />
Sir ROBERT MENZIES.-I wish I knew,<br />
but I do not. The Press certainly did not get<br />
it from me or from the Government. For all<br />
those reasons I made the statement. The<br />
notion that either the Leader of the Opposition<br />
or the Deputy Leader of the Opposition<br />
was deceived or that something was<br />
concealed from them is really shown to be<br />
completely without foundation. Each of<br />
them ' knew that if I did make a statement<br />
it would be related to this question, because<br />
the dogs were barking it around the<br />
premises. The newspaper stories had made<br />
that quite clear. Perhaps I have mixed up<br />
two notions in saying that. Notwithstanding<br />
these circumstances, the two honorable<br />
gentlemen opposite left the House-no<br />
doubt for very good political reasons-and<br />
they were competently represented by the<br />
honorable member for Melbourne Ports<br />
who had a copy of the statement and heard<br />
it. Therefore, the grievance to which the<br />
Leader of the Opposition made a faint reference<br />
at the beginning of his speech, is without<br />
foundation.<br />
I now turn, as he did, to the merits of<br />
this matter. Where does the Labour Party<br />
stand? I have been asking myself this question<br />
for some time. We heard the answer<br />
today. The Labour Party is against us on the<br />
merits. This is a clear cut issue of whether or not we should provide forces in South<br />
Vietnam. The Opposition says You should<br />
not do it for a variety of reasons which<br />
I invite honorable members to study and to<br />
understand, if they can. I turn to the<br />
merits for three reasons. One is to establish<br />
the rightness of our position under all the<br />
circumstances that exist. I do not propose<br />
to repeat what I said in my statement to<br />
the House on Thursday, because I dealt<br />
with the substance of the matter and the<br />
merits of the case on that occasion. But<br />
I do want, once more, to remind the House<br />
that, when the 1954 Geneva Agreements had<br />
been entered into and they were reported<br />
in statements to the House, I myself made<br />
a statement relating to this matter right here.<br />
I said that the Government of Australia<br />
would view aggression in violation of the<br />
Indo-China settlement as a threat to international<br />
peace and security. That was a perfectly<br />
explicit statement. It is because we<br />
believe that there has been a breach of<br />
international law and a violation of the<br />
Charter of the United Nations that we have,<br />
in relation to the present matter, notified<br />
the President of the Security Council of our<br />
decision, adding these words-<br />
This decision has been made at the request of<br />
the Government of the Republic of Vietnam and<br />
it is in accordance with Australia's international<br />
obligations. That is the formal ground on which we<br />
stand. But this is not a matter that lends<br />
itself to decision with reference to formalities<br />
only. Therefore, it is necessary to continue<br />
an examination of the merits of the<br />
matter. I must say that the Leader of the<br />
Opposition rather puzzled me because in<br />
the course of his speech-he was courteous<br />
enough to give me a copy of it when he<br />
came into the House-he made two statements<br />
of really splendid simplicity. One<br />
was-That there has long been, and still is, aggression<br />
from the North and subversion inspired by the<br />
North, I do not for one moment deny.<br />
Here is a proposition of fact which I<br />
thought would represent common ground<br />
on both sides of the House. I am very glad<br />
to have it stated by the Leader of the Opposition.<br />
I have said it in my statement and<br />
on other occasions. That there is aggression<br />
from the Communist North is not denied,<br />
and that there is subversion from within,<br />
fostered by the Communists of the North,<br />
is not denied now by the Leader of the </p>
<p>Opposition. 1 have ' heard it denied in a<br />
sense, but it was not denied today. This is<br />
a very significant fact. It describes the<br />
origin of the whole of this business in which<br />
we find ourselves involved.<br />
A little later in his speech the Leader<br />
of the Opposition made another statement<br />
which I will read. He said-<br />
I agree that the pace of North Vietnamese<br />
aggression-and that is the only term for it-has<br />
increased, though estimates as to its extent vary<br />
considerably. So, here is the admission that while all<br />
this is going on the pace of aggression<br />
from the North, the pace of the positive<br />
action by the Communist North, has increased.<br />
That is the state of affairs-it is<br />
now common ground between the Government<br />
and the Opposition-in which we have<br />
had to consider whether we should withdraw<br />
from the scene, whether we should<br />
make our contribution by words, whether<br />
we should leave the United States to go<br />
it alone, or whether we should, with all<br />
our partnerships and involvements and all<br />
our risks in this part of the world, determine<br />
that we will play our part, although it may<br />
be a small one, in positive action. Broadly,<br />
that is what we have done and why we<br />
have done it.<br />
I do not understand how my friend, the<br />
Leader of the Opposition, can delude himself<br />
on this matter. He used some fine words,<br />
some rather emotional words, towards the<br />
end of his speech. But does he really believe<br />
that Australia should walk out on this<br />
matter? This is the question. Does he really<br />
believe that the United States of America,<br />
of whose actions he has approved and reapproved,<br />
ought to be allowed to continue<br />
to carry this burden and that we, as one of<br />
the S. E. A. T. O. powers, with South Vietnam<br />
requesting our help, should say: " Sorry;<br />
there is nothing we can do about it"? This<br />
is a very serious position, I venture to say,<br />
for the Leader of the Opposition to get into.<br />
It certainly is not a position that we want<br />
to get into.<br />
It is in the continuing interest of this<br />
country-to put it on no higher ground<br />
than that-to be regarded and to remain as<br />
a valued ally of the United States, which is,<br />
in this part of the world, our own most powerful ally. 1 would hate to be the head<br />
of a government which had to say to the<br />
United States on an occasion like this:<br />
Sorry; we can do nothing about it. We will<br />
help you with debate in the United Nations.<br />
We will offer some fine words and some<br />
good sentiments. -But, as for practical action,<br />
no; that is for you. American soldiers from<br />
the Middle West can go and fight and die in<br />
South Vietnam, but that is not for us". I<br />
think that is a disastrous proposition for<br />
any opposition to put forward.<br />
I do not want to prolong this speech. The<br />
whole essence of this matter seems to me<br />
to be clear. The Leader of the Opposition<br />
may be right; perhaps I oversimplify it. I<br />
am a great believer, when it comes to determining<br />
international obligations, in simpliiing<br />
a proposition so that it stands out<br />
stark and clear and so that we all know<br />
what it is we are deciding, what we are<br />
debating, and what we are to do about it.<br />
From things that have been said one would<br />
think that this decision by the Government<br />
was not entirely consistent with statements<br />
repeatedly made by us in this House. Indeed,<br />
an attempt has been made here and there<br />
to suggest that this decision came rather as<br />
a surprise, a little bit out of the blue. May<br />
I remind the House-I am sure the Leader<br />
of the Opposition needs no reminding-that<br />
this approach of ours has been stated<br />
repeatedly in this place and from this table.<br />
, I have just quoted what was said after<br />
the Geneva Agreements were entered into.<br />
Without labouring the matter, everybody<br />
knows that announcements have been made<br />
from time to time about sending military<br />
instructbiors to South Vietnam. The number<br />
has grown from a small 30 to a substantial<br />
100-very substantial, considering our own<br />
requirements in this field. We have provided<br />
aircraft: Caribou aircraft have gone<br />
there. We have provided a substantial<br />
amount of economic aid. We have supplied<br />
much appreciated groups of people of a<br />
military order, and equipment of a military<br />
order-not large in numbers, but very significant<br />
from their moral effects not only<br />
on the problem itself but on the opinion<br />
and feeling of the United States of America.<br />
Therefore. it is idle to say that this is something<br />
new and that we have a new approach.<br />
The Minister for External Affairs ( Mr.<br />
Hasluck) made an extraordinarily able </p>
<p>statement in this House comparatively<br />
recently in which he outlined the whole of<br />
our policies in these matters in the clearest<br />
possible terms. I have, in my own fashion.<br />
though not as well, tried to say very much<br />
the same kind of thing. I do not think anybody<br />
has any ambiguity in his mind as to<br />
where we stand. Certainly nobody in the<br />
American Administration has any; certainly<br />
nobody in the United Kingdom Government<br />
has any; certainly none of our friends<br />
and allies in these various places have any:<br />
Why should there be any existing in this<br />
place? It has all been completely clear.<br />
And now the Leader of the Opposition<br />
criticises. I would say to him that he had<br />
better look at himself, at his colleagues and<br />
at his Party. He has really, of course,<br />
disclosed their approach. He has not, I am<br />
happy to say, got down to the level of one<br />
or two of his supporters by suggesting that<br />
this was an indecent bargain for dollars,<br />
which I thought was a monstrosity of a<br />
proposal and which, as I have said, reveals<br />
only the murky recesses of the minds of<br />
the people who make it. The Leader of the<br />
Opposition has not said this: He would not<br />
dream for a moment of saying it. But he<br />
has put his case in the curious, evasive and<br />
defeatist terms to which we have listened<br />
-today. I say defeatist, inactive. He says in<br />
effect: Kind hearts are more than coronets.<br />
Do not let us have actual forces used to<br />
repel force-to repel open Communist<br />
attack, to repel Communist aggression and<br />
subversion from the Vietcong. No, do not<br />
let us use force to meet force, because that<br />
is wrong." I noticed that the Labour Party-I suppose<br />
it is permissible to describe it in that<br />
phrase-issued a policy statement not long<br />
ago, on 18th February. I have been enriched<br />
with a copy of it and it has one or two<br />
interesting things to say. It states-<br />
In its statement to the Security Council on<br />
February 7th, reporting the air strikes against<br />
military installations in the south of North Vietnam,<br />
America insisted that its object in South<br />
Vietnam, while resisting aggression, is to achieve<br />
a peaceful settlement maintained by the presence<br />
of international peacekeeping machinery and that<br />
it would not allow the situation to be changed<br />
by terror and violence.<br />
Then it goes on-<br />
This statement of American purposes is<br />
uinexceptionable. Thg Australian Labour Party starts by<br />
saying: " Yes, that is right. You say this is<br />
what you are doing. This is the object of the<br />
exercise. You are going ! to repel the<br />
aggressors. You are going to attack their<br />
lines of communication. You are going to<br />
do everything you can to produce stability<br />
and get rid of civil war in South Vietnam<br />
Then it says: It is all right if the Americans<br />
do it, but it is no good to us. God made<br />
the United States our protectors and we<br />
ought to leave it to the United States<br />
Now Sir, : this is a matter which, I venture<br />
to say, is unarguable, but the last point<br />
that the Leader of the Opposition undertook<br />
to make was that in South Vietnam there<br />
was a poor government-a corrupt government.<br />
This word " corrupt" comes -trippingly<br />
to the tongue. Every government of<br />
this kind is corrupt or it is "' Fascist".<br />
I know of no evidence that the Quat Government<br />
in South Vietnam is corrupt. I<br />
certainly have had no evidence that the government<br />
of Ngo Dinh Diem was corrupt.<br />
I thought he was a brave and honest little<br />
man, and a patriot. But to say, " They are<br />
corrupt. They do not have ordinary elections<br />
in South Vietnam what sort of nonsense<br />
is this? On the honorable gentleman's own<br />
showing, South Vietnam is torn apart, torn<br />
to pieces, by the activities of the Vietcong<br />
in all their little pockets around the country.<br />
In those circumstances there cannot be the<br />
peaceable processes of election, there cannot<br />
be what we call a democratic self govering<br />
system if people are in that position.<br />
Why are they in that position? It is<br />
through no fault of their own, and no-one<br />
suggests it is. They are in that position because<br />
the Communists have set about two<br />
tasks. One is to make life intolerable for<br />
the South Vietnamese along their northern<br />
frontier and to cross over thousands of<br />
people to : help the Communist forces, and<br />
the other is to maintain a system of Communist<br />
subversion which is designed -to overthrow,<br />
by force, the Government of South<br />
Vietnam and to substitute for it a government<br />
which will never be elected by the<br />
people but which will be a simple Conmmunist<br />
dictatorship corresponding to that of<br />
Ho Chi Minh in North Vietnam.<br />
Therefore, I venture to say there is a<br />
good deal of humbug in talking of South<br />
Vietnam as though it -were exposed to criticism<br />
because of the manifold difficulties it </p>
<p>has had in securing stability, just as there<br />
is more than a shade of humbug in saying<br />
that what we ought to be doing is getting<br />
on with the work in the Mekong Valley.<br />
I ask members opposite to get on with it;<br />
to go along pretending that there is no<br />
fighting going on-pretending that the<br />
Vietcong are not there and pretending that<br />
there is no North Vietnam. Really, Sir, this<br />
is the height of absurdity.<br />
I recognised -the somewhat pathetic note<br />
in the honorable member's speech when he<br />
turned to his own people and said, metaphorically<br />
and literally: " We will be unpopular but we will stick to it. You must<br />
remember that we are ready to suffer in an<br />
unpopular cause". All I can say is that I<br />
wish he were willing to suffer in a good<br />
cause of his own, because I have not the<br />
slightest doubt that on the merits not only<br />
we in Australia, but also all those governments<br />
and people with whom we are associated<br />
in this tremendously important exercise<br />
which is so significant for the security<br />
of our own country, are on the side of the<br />
great majority. If 1 may end on a horribly<br />
political note, it is a good thing occasionally<br />
to be in a big majority.<br />
