TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
SPEECH AT THE ACTU CONGRESS, MELBOURNE,<br />
27 SEPTEMBER 1995<br />
AS DELIVERED<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
Well, Martin, Jennie, Bill, Members of the Executive, friends one and all it<br />
is great to be back and I mean that. I always look forward to coming to the<br />
ACTU Congress.<br />
One of the happiest memories I have of the 1993 election was the meeting<br />
I had with the ACTU Executive a week or so later. That wilt always sit in my<br />
-mind as a manifestation of what it was all about coming home to our real<br />
friends. Now I have always stuck with the unions. I believe in union people because<br />
I believe in the things that most of you people do. You spend your working<br />
days and your working week looking after the interests of ordinary<br />
Australians. And it is hard going and it has always been hard going, but we<br />
have done many things together and the model we have put together is so<br />
sophisticated, in certainly western world terms, but what pleases me greatly is<br />
not only has it worked but you all know how it works and why it works and<br />
why the consensus and the cooperation that we have had between us does<br />
really mean something and that the trust that we have built up between us<br />
does really matter.<br />
And I couldn't think of a healthier thing than the trust between the<br />
Government of the nation and the workforce of the nation, or the leadership of<br />
that workforce. And if you are about building trust, about a cooperative<br />
partnership, is there any greater basis than this? Well I wouldn't think so and<br />
that is why I am here, pleased again, to be able to talk about it.<br />
The other thing I am pleased about is Jennie George gave me a kiss when<br />
I arrived. But she won't be giving John Howard one. </p>
<p>And I have got to tell you how much pride it does fill me to find people like<br />
Martin Ferguson, who has just given me a kind introduction, to know that after<br />
having led the industrial movement, he will be going to the national<br />
Parliament to carry on his life's work and to see that torch passed to another<br />
great person in the labour movement Jennie George.<br />
I congratulate Jennie on what is not simply a wonderful endorsement to be<br />
the President-elect of the ACTU, a wonderful endorsement of a Labor person,<br />
but a wonderful endorsement of a Labor woman. And I mean she has been<br />
so good at it and I watched her in a few interviews recently. She has got<br />
them coming and going, she knows all the angles and she is only limbering<br />
up. When she really gets going and all the lines really start rolling through<br />
her mind and, of course, I always find this in the election campaign for the<br />
first week you are stumbling around, pulling the lines together, then you start<br />
really refining them down and by the third week they're deadly. A punch in<br />
every sentence and I am sure that is the way it will go here too.<br />
But it does fill me full of pride to think that the trade unions in this country<br />
have been able to elect a leadership group in this last decade that has meant<br />
so much to Australia and so much to the labour movement. We will never<br />
see it better than this. It doesn't matter how long we live, I don't think it has<br />
ever been any better than this. There is no time when the Labor Party and<br />
the industrial labour movement have had such shared objectives and have<br />
done so much together and, again, in that relationship of trust. I<br />
We have completely remodelled a middle-sized OECD economy from the<br />
ground up its economy and its society and we have done it in the image of<br />
labour, of industrial and political labour and we sit here today with 4 per cent<br />
economic growth, 4 per cent employment growth, 2 1/ 2 per cent inflation and<br />
one of the most fairest and decent wage and social policy systems in the<br />
world and that is a tremendous achievement a great achievement.<br />
And they are the things, I think, the values we have to inculcate in the<br />
Australian community. That by cooperation you can do good things. If you<br />
have, as I think we all have, faith in ourselves to do something good and<br />
belief in our fellow Australians that with them something great can be<br />
achieved, there are no boundaries to what can be done in this country.<br />
I mean I wasn't surprised the other day when the World Bank came out and<br />
said that on an asset basis we were the richest country per capita in the<br />
world. And I said on an asset basis because that is not so on an income<br />
basis. But you don't have to be an economist to know that the great wealth of<br />
this continent, as large as it is spread over just 18 million people would<br />
have to turn up a result something like that.<br />
But this is the great opportunity we have been given just in four times our<br />
lifetime there were no Europeans here and that the Aboriginal and Torres<br />
Strait Islanders of this country had held this great continent in trust for us and<br />
we have a remarkable opportunity to do something with it. </p>
<p>You know from the history of the labour movement in the 19th and early<br />
century of people going off looking for nirvana in South America to make the<br />
sort of social paradise, to build the model they didn't think they could build<br />
here with the forces of reaction. Well I am glad some of them stayed at home<br />
because we are able to build now a model that very few countries can<br />
emulate. And when we are looking at ourselves you look at Japan, it is growing at<br />
1/ 2 per cent a year at the moment. Western Europe is growing at around<br />
1 1/ 2 per cent to 2 per cent. The United States is growing at around<br />
2 1/ 2 per cent. We are averaging around 4 per cent. We have been growing<br />
as high as 6 per cent. That means we are creating twice as much wealth and<br />
twice as much opportunity as we would otherwise were we in some<br />
straight-jacketed model, some model which says " let's not cooperate<br />
together', but rather " let's let the people take the best and the devil take the<br />
hindmost, the strong take the best and the devil take the hindmost, and we<br />
will see what happens after that."<br />
Rather than that, we have gone a long a path which says that employment<br />
matters and I think the thing that is lost on many people, it is certainly lost on<br />
our friends in the Coalition, that the Accord has always been a very clear<br />
trade-off of wage restraint for growth. And the growth is the thing that<br />
delivers the employment and the employment goes to the people who are<br />
either at the bottom end of the queue or starting in the workforce. So it has<br />
always been, in a sense, an internal trade-off for the trade unions of this<br />
country. In a sense, restraining the top-end power of the ACTU constituency<br />
to deliver equity and fairness in the bottom and the middle ranges of the<br />
income scales and to guarantee to those people employment, so that we can<br />
run a quite fast, high growth, economy and we can run it with low inflation.<br />
Now, of course, under the changes we have introduced, we have now come<br />
to a productivity model. We have come away from the strictures of a<br />
centralised system which wasn't able, while we could get aggregate wage<br />
adjustments from it, national wage aggregate adjustments, we weren't able to<br />
get the within sector flexibility we have always known we have needed. So<br />
we needed the award restructuring to proceed that. We put that into place.<br />
Amalgamation of unions. That has got into place and we are now into an<br />
enterprise bargaining system, which gives us the capacity to lift the earnings<br />
and productivity of businesses and share it between profits and wages.<br />
As well as that, for those not able to access the system, we have got a safety<br />
net. We probably have the nearest thing to a permanent wages system, we<br />
have had certainly in the twelve years of the Accord because we had so many<br />
various wage models to take us through those difficult years of transition from<br />
the uncompetitive economy, industrial archaeology of the early 1980s,<br />
through the big collapse in our terms of trade in 1985-86, to the big<br />
deprecation of the exchange rate, at the same time then trying to pick it up, </p>
<p>restrain the growth of the late 80s, to hold inflation down so that we knew we<br />
wouldn't be back where we started in 1982-83.<br />
Now we have come through all those wage systems. We have now got low<br />
inflation and we all know it is much easier to run a wages system on low<br />
inflation and, I think, we know that the system we now have together is a very<br />
fair one. If you don't have enough bargaining power to get yourself an<br />
enterprise bargain that increases your income, or at least where you would<br />
get protection, real wage protection, you can fall back to the safety nets.<br />
So it is, I think, a model, perhaps, in transition, but one getting very near to<br />
the one that we are going to finish up with and that is one where enterprise<br />
bargaining will be the order of the day. And, of course, one of the things<br />
I said to you in 1993 and since and that is were we still hostage to the<br />
centralised wage fixing system, how much easier it would be for a Coalition<br />
Government to hop into Australian working people, to tear the hell out of it.<br />
Whereas now we have developed a model that lives by itself and breaths by<br />
itself, out there, in the industrial landscape in the workplaces of this country.<br />
Because we can what the Liberals are about. They are always about the<br />
same thing. It doesn't matter whether it is Stanley Melbourne Bruce in the<br />
1920s, or the Earl Page's of this world, or any of the Labor renegades like<br />
Joe Lyons, or Menzies, or Fraser, or any of them they are always about the<br />
same thing: basically, cutting peoples' wages. And I don't quite know why<br />
because the profit share is almost at an historic high. And you have got to<br />
say well what do you want. Do you want the profit share beyond any historic<br />
precedence and what is the point in that? Aren't the executives already<br />
getting enough out of it? Are they milking the system as much as they can?<br />
What do you want to cut the wages of working people for, other than spite<br />
spitefulness, a sort of an ideological envy? But you see it with Jeff Kennett in<br />
Victoria. You see it now in Western Australia. We have seen John Howard<br />
endorse the Western Australian model.<br />
Fortunately, with Labor in office, with the Federal legislation so many people<br />
came back under the Federal award umbrellas. But, of course, with a<br />
Coalition Government that option would still be there. But, in a sense, the<br />
option would be to fall into their schemes so that they took a lot of these<br />
protections away.<br />
So, I think, that we have been able, through all of the vicissitudes and<br />
difficulties of a re-modelled economy, to put an essentially fair wage system<br />
into place. And, I think, that is the message that we have got to get to<br />
Australians. That we have given Australians huge employment growth<br />
2 million jobs since 1983. That our wage that we have adjusted the country<br />
economically to low inflation, but we have done it fairly and decently. That we<br />
have tried to protect the weak and the disadvantaged and, as a consequence<br />
of all of this, we have a much more cohesive and united country and a much<br />
more efficient economy. </p>
<p>This is an -extremely great achievement and I am quite sure, -rot even in the<br />
halcyon days of the labour movement in the earlier part of this century and<br />
last, such cooperation never really existed to this level and so precise have<br />
been our objectives to go and do it together. And we have kicked other<br />
milestones that, I think, we mightn't have even have thought were possible<br />
back there in 1983 and a couple of obvious ones come to mind<br />
superannuation is perhaps the most obvious. Because for those of us who<br />
have got a lot of our working lives behind us, it won't mean as much as for<br />
those with their working lives ahead of them.<br />
But, even today, with a couple in their mid-30s in the workforce there is going<br />
to be a substantial increase in retirement incomes for those people above the<br />
age pension. And for those, of course, starting work now, it will mean<br />
essentially someone on average weekly earnings will, at the end of their<br />
working life, retire on a retirement income of about the same around<br />
average weekly earnings in today's dollars. And that is real progress<br />
because it is not very many times that any Government, or a trade union<br />
movement, get the opportunity to put such a thing into place. And to do it in<br />
the way in which we have, adjusting the wage systems over the years, now<br />
putting some tax cuts aside to go into superannuation accounts, a relatively<br />
modest contribution on the part of employees, will get us to 15 per cent by the<br />
year 2002. We will see a huge pool of savings built and a set of protections,<br />
for Australian working men and women in retirement, we would never have<br />
got by simply the public budgets, by legislation and, certainly, not from a<br />
conservative Government.<br />
We have been able to do things like that and maternity leave is the thing we<br />
have just done most recently. There are others that spring to mind,<br />
child care, support for women in the workplace, the changed status of women<br />
both in the country at large and in the workplace. All of these things have<br />
come from the Accord and come from the relationship of trust that we have<br />
developed together.<br />
Now the Liberals, they don't understand any of this because, basically, they<br />
don't have any faith in people, they don't see you as fellow Australians, but<br />
rather some sort of class enemy, some sort of political enemy. But their story<br />
is starting to fall on deaf ears because the business community know that<br />
industrial disputation now is at the lowest it has ever been since they have<br />
been keeping the records. They know it is 1/ 6 of what it was when<br />
John Howard was last Treasurer. They know that the profit share is up and<br />
the stock market is running at about 2,150. The day I was sworn in as<br />
Treasurer, the All Ordinaries Index was 451, from memory. There has been a<br />
five-fold increase, a four to five-fold increase, in wealth in the stock market.<br />
They know these things.<br />
They know that there is flexibility in the workplace. They know that they are<br />
able to drag productivity out of businesses and sensibly share it between<br />
profits and wages. And you have got to wonder now, how many of them want<br />
to turn it up because I am finding, as I go about, that the endorsements that </p>
<p>one would formerly expect to see for the Liberal Party are just not there<br />
anymore. That it has been on for too long now and it has worked and that<br />
people have faith in it not just us, but the employers as well.<br />
Now, Howard is out there doing what he normally does and, today, he is in a<br />
difficult spot because he made a great mistake yesterday in saying that he<br />
will open the cross runway at Sydney Airport, so as not to concentrate the<br />
traffic on the two parallel runways. And you might say " well what has that got<br />
to do with industrial relations". Well I will tell you it has got this to do with it.<br />
This is a fellow who has been telling us for years that we are slack about the<br />
micro-economy. He is going to be guy that cleans up the ports and wharves<br />
and the rail system and all of the other things that we, he says, haven't been<br />
able to do. You can say to them the turn-around time in the ports is the same<br />
as European ports. You can tell them now that there are 18 people per ship<br />
on the Austfalian coast when there used to be around 28. You can say these<br />
things it cuts no ice with them because they say they are going to do the<br />
tough things.<br />
But the one major micro-economic reform to the airline system in the last<br />
years, has been the opening of the third runway at Mascot. It is the<br />
gateway to Australia. It is the key to Australian tourism. It is the linkages to<br />
Melbourne and Brisbane and the other major ports in Australia. It is the<br />
change which John Howard was out there arguing for, pressing us for, for<br />
years and years and years, on the record.<br />
Yesterday he said he now opposes it now that it is built, he wants to put a<br />
cross wind runway across it which will mean that the safety margin falls to<br />
pieces, that we would actually halve the traffic of the airport, and so the one<br />
micro economic test, not even a test for him because we built it not him, for a<br />
few votes in the seat of Bennelong, in his own seat, he is prepared to tip on<br />
its head the one major micro economic change in civil aviation, yet have the<br />
rest of Australia believe that he is going to be the guy that does it to wages,<br />
the labour market, the waterfront, to shipping, to transport, to all the other key<br />
areas of the micro economy in this country.<br />
Not only has he said that, he has gone and said that he will down the asset<br />
sales task force budget measure of selling the airports off by withdrawing<br />
support for the sale of Kingsford-Smith airport while ever the government<br />
doesn't exceed to his demand to have cross wind traffic. Now you know that<br />
if you put a plane across two parallel lanes of traffic what you have got is a<br />
recipe for disaster.<br />
So, here he is telling the employers at the business lunches in Melbourne and<br />
Sydney that he is the one to do the tough things. He is the one to make the<br />
fundamental changes, but on a change where they are needling him in<br />
Hunters Hill, where in that important headland for him between Lane Cove<br />
and Woolwich in Sydney he thinks the pressure is getting too hot, what does<br />
he say, he will tip the major civil aviation micro change on its head, he'll got </p>
<p>back to an unsafe airport, he'll actually punch a $ 2 billion hole in the surplus<br />
by vandalising the government's asset sales program.<br />
I can tell you this, there is blood in the water, and in politics you have got to<br />
have a nose for it. I watched him in the Parliament today, it came in, we had<br />
the vote on it, but normally sitting opposite me in the chair all cocky with<br />
inane little comments, but where was he? He was down in the back end of<br />
the triangle of the Parliament, back into the back of the horseshoe talking to a<br />
couple of backbench MPs while the votes were taking on. The psychology<br />
was all wrong, all wrong. I said to them ' where's you little mate? He's down<br />
the back here.' And, of course, they were on the back foot on the wages front<br />
because they knew I was coming here today and I know you have seen some<br />
of our advertisements this morning and so have they, which underlines the<br />
fact, of course, that the award protections which are there now in overtime,<br />
penalty rates, holiday leave loadings et cetera, would go without<br />
compensation under their model and it would mean that for people in certain<br />
circumstances, in certain occupations, I gave the figures during the week<br />
transport workers losing nearly $ 5000 a year, nurses losing more than $ 5000<br />
a year by losing penalty rates and these things, or losing overtime payments,<br />
that this would be a material disadvantage, a large disadvantage for a very<br />
large section of the work force. To which they say ' we'll be keeping the award<br />
protections', but only for people who don't change jobs. But 1.7 million<br />
Australians change jobs every year. In the last three years 43 per cent of the<br />
work force have changed jobs. That is 43 per cent of people that don't have<br />
the option of award protection. Like for instance, all the higher education<br />
people. Students, who leave and graduate, who come into jobs and there are<br />
600,000 of those a year, no award protection. For half the year 11 and 12<br />
leavers, about 200,000, no award protection. For the women joining the work<br />
force, no award protection.<br />
We are gradually getting these points out and they don't like it because,<br />
essentially, it is the same miserable policy they have always had. It is<br />
Jobsback, just dressed up in another way and it is about those things<br />
tearing down wages for ordinary men and women through the loss of such<br />
conditions without compensation.<br />
We say we have a no disadvantage test. That enterprise bargains have got<br />
to be run past the test and that you can vary some of these conditions, but<br />
there has to be no disadvantage overall. No remunerative disadvantage<br />
overall. They would never agree to such a test. We are also saying some<br />
community standards just shouldn't change, like sick leave for instance. You<br />
just shouldn't trade it away even though there are many things that can be<br />
traded away providing there is a remunerative benefit in return.<br />
So, this is there difference and we are starting to get them out. They were<br />
feeling the pinch today on industrial relations and they are feeling the pinch<br />
on this very important, I think, icon issue. That is whether Howard has the<br />
bottle, or, put in the vernacular, the guts, to do the big changes in this<br />
country. Whether he can take on the big issues and do them co-operatively </p>
<p>as we have done in places like the waterfront or in shipping and in transport<br />
or in telecommunications or in civil aviation or in any of these areas.<br />
Because when the first test has come, he has caved in for a few votes in<br />
Bennelong because he has only got a three and a half per cent margin in<br />
Bennelong. So, instead of walking along with confidence believing he might<br />
win a national election, he is really worrying about whether he can hold the<br />
seat of Bennelong and whether he can please the Gurghers of Hunters Hill.<br />
He has not had a good day and, I think, this is a turning point in the dream<br />
ride he has had to date. Many people have said well, the government has<br />
been in office a long time, we want an alternative to be able to vote for and<br />
the moment that Downer resigned Howard jumped straight in the polls, but of<br />
course, with time the journalists have been saying to us ' is there an early<br />
election on?' I've been saying no, no early election. I want plenty of time to<br />
have a look at Howard. It is the same old Howard that we saw in the 1 980s<br />
and the 1970s. He might be trying to airbrush himself and Andrew Robb<br />
might be trying to airbrush him and wash away a few of his problems, but in<br />
the end, when you peel it all off he is the same person. He wants to hop into<br />
working people and when it comes to the big changes we called him in the<br />
Parliament today " gunna Howard" he was gunna to float the dollar, but he<br />
didn't. He was gunna deregulate the financial markets, but he didn't. He was<br />
gunna knock over the tariff wall, but he didn't. He was gunna change the<br />
micro economy, but he didn't. He was always gunna do these things and yet,<br />
here he is, naked now coming up to a poll saying, for the shabbiest ot<br />
reasons, let's cut back the capacity of our largest airport and let me vandalise<br />
the budget surplus. All for a few votes in Bennelong.<br />
I hope the public understand this, while at the same time he is saying he<br />
endorses the Western Australian industrial legislation and he wants to see<br />
these changes of the Western Australian variety in the Federal jurisdiction.<br />
So, it is very clear what we are going to fight. It is very clear, I think, that we<br />
can beat him because we'll beat him not just on these issues, but on the basic<br />
issue that he has no faith in Australians and no real belief in Australia.<br />
Howard is a person from that part of Australian history that has always seen<br />
Australia as a derivative society. He doesn't even understand the<br />
opportunities we now have. He doesn't see the imperative of our integration<br />
in Asia. Four weeks ago he refused to see the General Secretary of the<br />
Vietnamese Communist Party Mr Do Muoi, who the previous week had joined<br />
ASEAN the Association of South East Asian Nations as a full member.<br />
Who, two days after leaving Australia sat down in a meeting with the United<br />
States Secretary of State Warren Christopher, but he wasn't good enough to<br />
meet John Howard. And, all around the region now, we have got people<br />
saying, ' What about the Federal Opposition in Australia if they are not<br />
prepared to talk to the Vietnamese, will they talk to us?" I mean, what sort of<br />
a relationship would the rest of ASEAN have with them? These are the sort<br />
of obscurantist views, he is still fighting the Vietnam war or here he thinks<br />
there may be a few votes in the Vietnamese community in western Sydney or<br />
in Melbourne, just the same way as he thinks there might be a few votes over<br />
at Bennelong with the airport. In just the same way at St Joseph's College in </p>
<p>Hunters-Hill, eight weeks ago he told a group of high school students, yes, he<br />
thought he should put a ban on uranium sales to France when he knew his<br />
policy was the very opposite.<br />
You see, there is no strength there and there is no purpose and there is no<br />
understanding. To think that now here we are with a growth economy, a<br />
productive economy, a stripped down one, one that can now engage itself in<br />
Asia in the fastest growing part of the world, where we are making bilateral<br />
relationships the likes of which we have never had with these old societies<br />
like Indonesia and Vietnam and China and, of course, the great relationships<br />
we have built up over the years with our biggest trading partners Japan and<br />
Korea it is lost on him.<br />
So, these are the reasons why I think the Australian community are not going<br />
to take him. He is out of his age and he is out of his depth. Worst of all he is<br />
weak and sneaky and they don't like sneaks.<br />
I know you see most of these things in him that I see, but what I see in you is<br />
the good things about Australia-the things that we have done together and<br />
the things we do believe in together. The building blocks we have put into<br />
place, where we have taken this country from an industrial backwater with old<br />
derivative technology to a modem industrial country, which is still changing,<br />
still evolving, where we have set up partnerships not simply between the<br />
government and the industrial wing of the Labor movement, but also with the<br />
farm organisations, also with industry, where product innovation is the order<br />
of the day, where the education system is the thing that pumps our product<br />
innovation along, that great liberator of education. These are the things that<br />
have remade Australia and they are things we have done together and they<br />
are not academic things, they are not esoteric things, they are real things that<br />
have been put together because of trust between us and the faith we have in<br />
our fellow Australians to make adjustments and to see a better way.<br />
We in the Labor movement always think we do represent the best instincts of<br />
Australians out there because the Labor Party is a collection of little branches<br />
spread across the country, joined by people who have no other reason for<br />
joining it, no ulterior motive but the advancement of the nation. You people<br />
represent working Australians in trade unions, you do so simply for their<br />
advancement. They are very decent and pure motives and it is why, I think,<br />
at our grass roots we have been able to always produce good policies. And<br />
you have had the leadership. You have had great leaders in these years and<br />
leadership is everything in an organisation and in the ACTU you have had a<br />
great clutch of leaders who have seen the opportunity and steered the boat<br />
the right way, in their own right and in partnership with the government.<br />
That is why I am pleased to be back today to say to you that you did keep the<br />
faith for us last time. You did fight the unwinnable election. We did win it and<br />
we have kicked into place since the industrial legislation, we have seen home<br />
enterprise bargaining, we have stitched up superannuation now to 15 per<br />
cent, we have put in the maternity allowance, the home child care allowance, </p>
<p>the generalised child care rebate and we have seen since the election,<br />
680,000 jobs created and fulfilment of the most solemn commitment we made<br />
at the poll and we have seen the target we set in Accord Mark VII exceeded<br />
in two and a quarter years. So, it was worth it. It was worth it to win that last<br />
election just as it will be worth it to win the next one. Because the thing we<br />
must remember, people talk about the golden age of Australia in the 1950s<br />
and the 1960s and when you looked around it was a fairly ordinary world. It<br />
was a bit golden for us because we were selling food to countries that<br />
couldn't feed themselves. We were selling wool to people who couldn't clothe<br />
themselves and we had a ray of sunshine shining on us, but there was a lot of<br />
darkness around. This is not the world today. The world today, there is sun<br />
all over the place east Asia is growing as never before, the Indian sub<br />
continent is growing as never before, South America is growing as never<br />
before there is a real light shining out there and Australia is now part of that<br />
broader sunshine and we are not just sitting there with some sort of natural<br />
endowment or benefit that gave us a 10 or 15 year benefit which then washed<br />
away as these other great countries caught up and passed us like Japan and<br />
Germany in the post war period or the United States or some of the countries<br />
of east Asia. Now we are out there in our own terms in the broad sunlight of<br />
world growth, of broadly spread world growth and opportunity and we are<br />
earning our freight amongst the community of nations in the area in which we<br />
live, not as some sort of European enclave, but as a part of the Asia-Pacific<br />
region ourselves.<br />
It has never been a better scenario for us and that is why it would be a<br />
tragedy to see this scenario darkened by an obscurantist reactionary<br />
government that doesn't understand where we are at all and has no capacity<br />
to keep the co-operation of the kind we have going.<br />
So, I ask you to keep the faith in the Labor Party. Keep the faith in this Labor<br />
Government and know that the things we promised you, we have done, but<br />
also know we have done it together and we can keep on doing it.<br />
Thank you </p>
