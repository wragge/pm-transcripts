STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
SUPPORT FOR JOINT COMMEMORATION AT KOKODA<br />
The Australian Government will contribute $ 1.5 million to commemorate jointly with<br />
Papu~ a New Guinea the sacrifices made by both countries on the Kokoda Track during<br />
World War Two.<br />
I first discussed this proposal with the then Prime Minister, Rabbie Namaliu, when I<br />
made what was for me a very memorable visit to Kokoda in April, 1992.<br />
When the Prime Minister, Paias Wingti, was in Australia recently I returned to the<br />
discussion, and we agreed our two governments would undertake construction of a<br />
number of facilities at Kokoda.<br />
Details of the construction will be finalised with the Papua New Guinea Government<br />
soon, but Australia expects that they will include a new airport terminal at Kokoda, an<br />
expanded and renovated war museum, a hostel for people hiking along the track and a<br />
new medical centre to serve the area.<br />
Those who made the greatest of all sacrifices, in the name of their country and their<br />
people, have already made Kokoda sacred.<br />
Australian servicemen, many still in their teens, came to Kokoda to save their country<br />
from a ruthless enemy. They won a famous victory, and we honour them for that. We<br />
also pay tribute to the unquestioning help, courage and selfless humanitarianism of the<br />
people of Papua New Guinea who supported them.<br />
Together they suffered appalling hardship in a terrain totally inimical to their task.<br />
They suffered in battle. Many suffered long after. This and future generations must<br />
not forget them.<br />
We hope that tomorrow, " Anzac Day, we can begin to remember their sacrifice and the<br />
bonds between our two people in a substantial way.<br />
I also thank Rotary Australia, which has agreed to undertake the construction and<br />
supervise the associated administration.<br />
