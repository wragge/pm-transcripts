    <content><![CDATA[<p>A new coin to celebrate the APEC Australia 2007 year is in circulation.</p>
<p>The Royal Australian Mint has produced the new one dollar coin in recognition of Australia's hosting of meetings for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation.</p>
<p>The APEC Australia 2007 dollar coin will continue to be distributed through commercial banks across Australia in the coming weeks. </p>
<p>It is a fitting commemoration of the importance of Australia's membership of APEC and will raise the public profile of APEC Australia 2007 events.</p>
<p>The release of the APEC themed coin coincides with this week's Senior Officials Meeting to be held in Canberra, 15-27 January.</p>
<p>Incorporating the APEC Australia 2007 logo, the coin is a dynamic representation of Australia's distinctive seven-point Star of Federation and comprises 21 individual elements, representing the 21 APEC Member Economies from across the Asia-Pacific, uniting to form a diverse but open community. </p>
<p>A minimum of 10 million APEC Australia 2007 themed one dollar coins will be produced this year. The Royal Australian Mint will circulate 4.2 million coins this month.</p>
