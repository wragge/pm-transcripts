FOR PRESS: P. M. No. 60. . o<br />
CANBERRA<br />
BOMBING OF HANOI AND HAIPHONG. 8<br />
STATEMENT BY THE ACTI G PRI', MINISTER. THE RIGHT<br />
HON. J. McEN, 1I. P.<br />
The Acting Prime Minister said this morning that the<br />
Australian Government fully supports American policy on South<br />
Viet Nam. As the Prime Minister has indicated in W. ashington,<br />
the action to bomb oil installations on the outskirts of Hanoi<br />
and Haiphong arose from a military assessment, which the<br />
Australian Government accepted, of the needs of the situation,<br />
since these supplies contributed importantly to the capacity<br />
of the enemy, including their capacity to operate destructively<br />
against Australian and allied forces.<br />
The Australian Government was aware of the decision<br />
to strike the oil installations. The nature of discussions on<br />
such operational matters are, of course, confidential between<br />
the Governments concerned.<br />
CANBERRA, June, 1966. </p>
