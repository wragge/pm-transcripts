St; L-ate ren No 5 8 7<br />
3 N~ ovember 1975<br />
THE BUDGET<br />
Mr Fraser can muster the votes of half thr. Senat.-ors<br />
to delay a vote on~ the B~ udget. By various strcagatemEs he<br />
is trying to use this half of the Senate to force an e). e ction<br />
for -the House of epeetivs<br />
The system of Government that Australia has<br />
enjoyed for 75 yecars would be destroyed if any Prime : Unister,<br />
now or in the future, were to give in to the type of b: lackmail<br />
Mr Fraser continue s to use.<br />
The Senate has never rejected a Budget. Mr Fraser<br />
cannot muster the votes to reject the 1975 Budlget. The<br />
Liberals are deferring a-vote on thce-Budget because they<br />
are desperate. The Opposition has been making hysterical<br />
accusations against the Government because it now realises<br />
that Public Servants will not be bankrupted by any<br />
Opposition refusal to pass the Budget. My Government would<br />
not contemplate any raising, authorisation or expenditure of<br />
money which was not within the existing Australian Conistitutional<br />
and legal framework. My Government believes in Parliamentary demcocracy.<br />
It has kept the Parliament sitting through its normal recess<br />
because it asserts that the political problems of the day must<br />
be settled in the Parliament not by some backdoor deal..<br />
The Australian Labor Party has a clear majority in<br />
the House of Representatives. While it retains that majority<br />
it remains the Government.<br />
on the particular issue of the Budget, the Government<br />
in fact has the support of a majority of both Houses of<br />
Parliament. only the creation of false numbers in the Senate<br />
through the death of a Labor Senator and the destruction of<br />
conventions by two anti-Labor Premiers has enabled the<br />
Opposition to keep deferring a vote on the Budget.<br />
I once again challenge Mr Fraser to free his Senators<br />
to vote on the substance of the Budget that is to vote on<br />
whether they will pass or reject the two Appropriation Bills.<br />
It is intolerable that the present sham of deferring a decision<br />
on these Bills should continue. The Australian people have a<br />
right to know whether the Senate accepts or rejects this Budget<br />
and the economic strategy it contains.<br />
