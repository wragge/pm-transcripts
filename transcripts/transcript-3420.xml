PRIME MINISTER 18 October 1974<br />
PENSION PORTABILITY STATISTICS<br />
The Prime Minister, Mr. Whitlam, today released<br />
figures showing the number of former Australian residents*<br />
now receiving social security payments overseas. The figures<br />
show that at the end of June 1974 a total of 1,429 people<br />
were receiving Australian benefits or pensions in Greece,<br />
Italy and Yugoslavia. Mr. Whitlam said the Labor Party had<br />
promised in the 1972 election campaign to implement a policy<br />
of full portability of pension rights for migrants. This<br />
Wdo1id enable migrants, especially old or retired people, to<br />
return to their homielands without sacrificying their pension<br />
rights. " It can be seen from the figures prepared by the<br />
Immigration Advisory Council that we have fulfilled this<br />
pledge in full" Mr. Whitlam said. Attached is a table of<br />
portability statistics.<br />
