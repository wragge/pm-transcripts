TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING, MP<br />
DOORSTOP, TREASURY, 17 FEBRUARY 1992<br />
E&amp; EO PROOF COPY<br />
PM: The discussions were held in the friendly environment<br />
of the Accord. We have been doing this for now nearly<br />
a decade, and it has changed Australia. It is one of<br />
the reasons we have got a low inflation rate, it is one<br />
of the reasons why we have got a big emphasis now on<br />
productivity, it's one of the reasons we have been so<br />
successful on exporting, manufacturing and we are now<br />
using these processes to induce a recovery and create<br />
jobs. We think we will get there. And that the Unions<br />
have put their positions, and we will be talking about<br />
wages after' the Statement, when they get a chance to<br />
read it. It was a very useful exchange of views.<br />
Which is as the Accord processes should be.<br />
J: Is the Government prepared to support a general wage<br />
increase sometime this year?<br />
PM: Well you will read about that. But we know where their<br />
views are, where they're going, and they know where we<br />
are going I think, and I found the whole meeting very<br />
satisfactory. Thank you.<br />
