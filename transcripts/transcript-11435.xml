    <content><![CDATA[<p>E&amp;OE....................................................................................................</p>
<p>Well thank you very much, Philip. To you and to Neville Roach, the</p>
<p> Chairman, can I express very warm personal thanks. This is an ideal</p>
<p> forum for me to record my immense appreciation and respect for the</p>
<p> work that Philip Ruddock has done as the Minister for Immigration</p>
<p> and Multicultural Affairs. Quite deservedly he enjoys a wide affection</p>
<p> and respect, not only in the communities that this audience represents</p>
<p> but also in the broader Australian community. He handles a portfolio,</p>
<p> which is never free from day-to-day controversy and difficulty, with</p>
<p> enormous sensitivity and skill. And I do want to record, quite unreservedly,</p>
<p> my immense gratitude to you, Philip, for the fine work that you've</p>
<p> done in the period of a little over three years. I know that everyone</p>
<p> in this audience welcomed the return of the immigration portfolio</p>
<p> to Cabinet after the last election. And Philip does bring a very strong</p>
<p> voice in relation to those issues as well as, of course, contributing</p>
<p> very constructively in the broader deliberations of the Government.</p>
<p>To you, Neville, can I say thank you very much. You're a very</p>
<p> busy man. You have a lot of other irons in the fire as well as your</p>
<p> role as Chairman of the Council and I think you've done an outstanding</p>
<p> job. And I want to say to all of the other members of the committee,</p>
<p> thank you from the Government for the work that you've done.</p>
<p> As Philip said, all of the detailed recommendations will be examined.</p>
<p> I can say to you that the essential thrust and the main elements of</p>
<p> the report are, of course, endorsed by the Government. Most importantly,</p>
<p> what the Government endorses are the values that are expressed in</p>
<p> the report.</p>
<p>What holds a nation together more than anything else are its common</p>
<p> values. I share Philip Ruddock's optimism. I share his positive</p>
<p> note. The experiment that Australia represents, if I can call it that,</p>
<p> of bringing together, in a quite unprecedented way people from the</p>
<p> four corners of the earth and doing it consistently over a period</p>
<p> of time and continuing to do it, both in a humanitarian way as well</p>
<p> as in a nation-building way, as we again remind ourselves this week</p>
<p> as we prepare to receive the first of the 4,000 refugees from Yugoslavia</p>
<p> that will be received within our midst, that it really has been a</p>
<p> quite remarkable experiment.</p>
<p>And Neville is right to use the adjective Australian before multicultural</p>
<p> because what he's really putting his finger on is that we have</p>
<p> developed an Australian way of doing things. And, increasingly, not</p>
<p> only in relation to settlement and other policies but also in other</p>
<p> areas of public life and public policy, we are developing a quite</p>
<p> unique Australian way of doing things. Not that there is anything</p>
<p> strange about that. We've always found a particular Australian</p>
<p> way of doing things. And one of the elements, one of the genius elements</p>
<p> of the Australian story is the way in which we have been able to retain</p>
<p> the good bits that have been contributed to Australian society by</p>
<p> the various tributaries, cultural tributaries, that make up our nation</p>
<p> and reject the bad bits.</p>
<p>Much of our society, of course, is heavily influenced by our British</p>
<p> and other European heritage, by no means of course exclusively, and</p>
<p> that's an important part of the Australian history. But we've</p>
<p> been very clever. We've taken the good bits and we've rejected</p>
<p> the bad bits. A long time ago we decided to reject the class-consciousness</p>
<p> that was part and parcel of much of our European heritage. We rejected</p>
<p> that a long time ago. But we've retained the habits of civil</p>
<p> discourse, of freedom of an open media and, of course, the rich cultural</p>
<p> treasure that we have inherited from Europe.</p>
<p>When I addressed the Australian Unlimited Conference in Melbourne</p>
<p> last night I spoke very optimistically about our country. I said that</p>
<p> it occupied a special intersection of history, geography and culture</p>
<p> and it really does. There's no nation on earth that, in this</p>
<p> part of the world, in the Asian Pacific region, that has such profound</p>
<p> links with the nations of Europe, shares such values in common as</p>
<p> we do with the nations of North America, has taken people from 140</p>
<p> source countries. And more recently, and certainly not exclusively,</p>
<p> we've taken large numbers of people from the nations of the Asian</p>
<p> Pacific region. And they have made an immense and beneficial and positive</p>
<p> contribution to the modern Australia.</p>
<p>So with all of those linkages and occupying that very special intersection,</p>
<p> as I call it, of history, geography and culture, we have an opportunity</p>
<p> and a place in the world that no nation on this globe has or can possibly</p>
<p> rival. But what we need of course to convert that fortunate conjunction</p>
<p> of history and geography and other circumstances, into an enduringly</p>
<p> positive advantage for the Australian community is of course to maintain</p>
<p> the values of which Neville spoke, and of which this report speaks.</p>
<p> And they are the values of tolerance, the values of understanding,</p>
<p> of respect for cultural difference, a sensitivity to ethnic diversity,</p>
<p> an understanding that when people come to a country which however</p>
<p> friendly it may be is nonetheless different and strange. There is</p>
<p> a process of adjustment, and there is a process of understanding that</p>
<p> is needed from those of us who were either born in this country, or</p>
<p> have lived for a long time in this country.</p>
<p>Now we Australians have done it rather better than most. It doesn't</p>
<p> mean for a moment some new comers have not been subjected to bigotry,</p>
<p> discrimination and intolerance. And like any country that has been</p>
<p> in the general successful, we've had individual blemishes and</p>
<p> dark spots and we have a collective responsibility on all occasions</p>
<p> to stare down tendencies towards extremism within our community. And</p>
<p> I do want to make it very plain on behalf of the Government, without</p>
<p> ambiguity, that we stand totally and utterly and uncompromisingly</p>
<p> opposed to any form of discrimination of any person in this country</p>
<p> based on ethnic background, nationality, race, colour of skin, religious</p>
<p> or political convictions. And it is a cornerstone of the Australian</p>
<p> way that we resist bigotry and we resist intolerance.</p>
<p>I think we have come a long way in this country. I think the debt</p>
<p> that we owe to the successive waves of migrants who have embraced</p>
<p> the Australian way is incalculable. With exception of course to the</p>
<p> indigenous people of our country which occupy a very special place</p>
<p> in our history, we are all in one form or another immigrants or the</p>
<p> children of immigrants. And that will continue to be the case. And</p>
<p> in that way Australia is one of only a relatively small number of</p>
<p> societies that can say that. And it gives us a special, I suppose</p>
<p> understanding, of the difficulties, particularly for those of us and</p>
<p> including many any in this audience who were not born in Australia,</p>
<p> a special understanding of the difficulties of adjustment that people</p>
<p> must encounter when they first settle in this nation.</p>
<p>And I believe that the principles espoused in this report encapsulate</p>
<p> what most people think. We believe in treating people decently, we</p>
<p> believe in the unity of the Australian nation above all else. But</p>
<p> we respect and understand the fact that if you were born in another</p>
<p> country you retain a special place in your heart for that country.</p>
<p> And there is nothing that in my view that diminishes the wholeness</p>
<p> of the Australian nation in that being fully recognised.</p>
<p>I think we have been very successful. Philip is right to refer to</p>
<p> the cohesiveness that was retained at the time of the gulf war. I</p>
<p> can understand the feelings of many people from the former Yugoslavia</p>
<p> about events which are now occurring in that country. And I was sad</p>
<p> that in some of the ANZAC Day marches the Serbian-Australian contingents</p>
<p> felt unable to participate. But I was delighted that in many parts</p>
<p> of Australia, including in Melbourne, they did. And that particular</p>
<p> day which has such a special place of hallowed reverence in the Australian</p>
<p> history and the Australian experience, above all celebrates respect</p>
<p> for those who fought together and does not in any way seek to perpetuate</p>
<p> hatreds in relations of those who fought in opposing armies so many</p>
<p> years ago. It's a day to celebrate sacrifice and valour together</p>
<p> and not indeed to focus on different and past dissent.</p>
<p>But I think we have been very successful and the reason we've</p>
<p> been very successful is that within the individual commitment and</p>
<p> affection that people have to the culture and the land of their birth</p>
<p> they have developed, and all of us have together, acquired a common</p>
<p> overriding commitment to the values of the Australian nation. They</p>
<p> are unique and special values. They've been contributed to from</p>
<p> many sources, and they have over a period of time evolved into a distinctive</p>
<p> and quite outstanding, and quite tolerant and humanitarian Australian</p>
<p> culture. And I think the values espoused in this report resonate very</p>
<p> well with the Australian experience. I have great pleasure in launching</p>
<p> it. I warmly thank you Neville, and all the members of your committee</p>
<p> for your work. I think it contributes greatly to the ongoing debate</p>
<p> about the Australian story and the Australian identity. Thank you.</p>
