TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
DOORSTOP ON ARRIVAL AT RAAF FAIRBAIRN, CAN BERUA<br />
MARCH 1995<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
PM.: I might just say a couple of things about the trip it was, for me, as<br />
successful as I could have had, this visit to Germany the third largest<br />
economy in the world and then to Holland where we have a good bilateral<br />
trade and investment relationship, but where the relatior; hip<br />
needed to be w-armed up, and I think that has happened too. The visit<br />
I had with Chancellor Kohl couldn't have been better the policy<br />
discussions couldn't have been better I think there is a wider<br />
appreciation now of the policy innovations in Australia, the grow-th wye<br />
are having with low inflation which most Europeans could only dream<br />
about the high employment in Australia, how we have done it, and<br />
what we might do with Germany and with Europe. At the same time, of<br />
course, I went to the CeBIT Fair, which is the largest information,<br />
technology and telecommunications fair in the world, and we<br />
Australian companies are already writing tens of millions of dollars of<br />
business. We had 170 companies there ten years ago in this<br />
country, before this Government came to office, we would have been<br />
lucky to have had ten companies there. So it's an indication of the<br />
huge technological chE nge and product innovation which Australians<br />
have been able have been capable of and we had very warm praise<br />
for the quality of the exhibits we had there.<br />
J: Should you have raised domestic issues while you were over there?<br />
PM: There are always domestic issues being raised there, on overseas<br />
visits, and so we will be dealing with those as we come ho) me. But as<br />
far as Mr Howard is concerned, I will be just leaving him to his<br />
conscience.<br />
ends. </p>
