continued interest in the development of South Pacific countries. In light of the<br />
newly Introduced dialogue arrangements, , the Forum agreed that major<br />
consultations with those donor governments and organisations that are invited to<br />
participate in the Post-Forum Dialogue will be in the Dialogue. The Forum noted<br />
with particular appreciation the valuable cooperation arrangements developing with<br />
Canada, Japan, the United Kingdom, the United States and the European<br />
Community. 2 </p>
<p>Association of South-East Asian Nations ( ASEAN)<br />

main focus of the 20th Forum, although a range of economic issues was discussed.<br />
Reports of the Committee on Regional Economic Issues and the<br />
Regional Committee on Trade<br />
7. The Forum considered Reports from the Committee on Regional Economic<br />
Issues and the Regional Committee on Trade, which addressed a broad range of<br />
economic and development matters of concern to member countries. The Forum<br />
agreed there was a need for member Governments to explore new trade and<br />
investment policy initiatives to promote national development. It recognised the<br />
importance of the GATT/ Uruguay Round of Multilateral Trade Negotiations. The<br />
Prime Minister of Australia advised the Forum of developments in proposals for<br />
closer economic cooperation amongst Asia/ Pacific countries, and indicated that he<br />
would discuss with representatives of those governments involved the possibility of<br />
the Forum being invited to observe the meeting proposed to be held in Canberra.<br />
The Forum agreed that if such an invitation were issued it should be represented by<br />
the Secretary General.<br />
8. The Forum agreed that meetings of Forum trade and economic Ministers<br />
be held to address specific economic issues and concerns, It expressed<br />
satisfaction with the strengthening of the Secretariat's capacity to provide economic<br />
analysis and advice since the Nuku'alofa Forum in 1988. It directed that the<br />
Committee on Regional Economic Issues and the Regional Committee on Trade<br />
continue to meet in tandem to address economic and trade issues. </p>
<p>Telecommunications<br />
9. The Forum noted with gratitude the reconfirmation by the Prime Minister of<br />
Australia of the offer of A$ 2.6m as assistance for the Pacific Area Cooperative<br />
Telecommunications Network ( PACT) which was made at the 19th South Pacific<br />
Forum in Nuku'alofa. As requested by governments interested in participating in the<br />
network, these funds will be used to modify national earth stations in participating<br />
Forum Island Countries.<br />
Fisheries Issues Drlftnets<br />
The Forum expressed its profound concern that the damange now being<br />
done by pelagic drift net fishing to the economy and environment of the South<br />
Pacific region. Given the catastrophic effects of this fishing technique on the lives of<br />
the peoples of the South Pacific, the Forum adopted the Tarawa Declaration.<br />
Through the Declaration the Forum:<br />
resolved for the sake of this and succeeding generations of Pacific<br />
peoples to seek the establishment of a regime for the management of<br />
albacore tuna in the South Pacific that would ban drift net fishing from the<br />
region; such a ban might then be a first step to a comprehensive ban on<br />
such fishing;<br />
determined, to this end, to convene an urgent meeting of regional<br />
diplomatic, legal and fisheries experts, to develop a Convention to give<br />
effect to its common resolve to create a zone free of drift net fishing;<br />
called on the international community to support. and cooperate in, the<br />
urgent conclusion of a Convention establishing the zone;<br />
resolved that individual member states of the South Pacific Forum will<br />
take all possible measures in the interim to prevent drift net fishing within<br />
their waters, and to otherwise actively discourage operations of drift net<br />
rfsihers; </p>
<p>further resolved that member states acting individually and collectively<br />
will take what action they can within relevant international organisations<br />
to contribute to the cessation of this harmful form of fishing;<br />
commended the Republic of Korea for its decision to cease drift net<br />
fishing in the region; and<br />
called on Japan and Taiwan to follow this example, and abandon<br />
immediately their damaging drift net operations.<br />
11. The Forum accepted the generous offer of the New Zealand Government<br />
to host the meeting of experts to develop the drift net Convention.<br />
12. The Forum recognised the urgent need for closer cooperation among all<br />
Forum members in order to protect and preserve their fishery and other marine<br />
resources as effectively and cost-efficiently as possible. The Forum therefore<br />
directed the Forum Fisheries Agency to investigate, promote and implement the<br />
design and development of an Integrated Programme of Regional Fisheries<br />
Surveillance. 13. The Forum was pleased that Japan had agreed to begin discussion with<br />
Forum Fisheries Agency member countnies on a multilateral fisheries arrangement,<br />
but disappointed that no progress had otherwise been made on the issue. It renewed<br />
its mandate to the Director of FFA to continue negotiations with a view to early<br />
agreement on a multilateral fisheries arrangement.<br />
Pacific Economic Cooperation Conference ( PECC)<br />
14. The Forum supported the development of cooperation with the PECC,<br />
through a PECC Task Force, which will consider measures for developing business<br />
opportunities in Forum Island countries and explore mechanisms for strengthening<br />
PEOC activities in the region. It noted the importance for Forum/ PECC links of the<br />
PECC meeting to be held in New Zealand in November, 1989. </p>
<p>POLITICAL, SECURITY ISSUES AND ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES<br />
Decolonisatlon New Caledonia<br />
The Forum reviewed recent developments affecting New Caledonia since<br />
the last Forum. It expressed its deep sadness at the assassination of FLNKS leaders<br />
Jean-Marie Tjibaou and Yeiwene Yeiwene, and urged all parties to promote<br />
reconciliation and to refrain from acts of violence.<br />
16. The Forum welcomed the positive measures being pursued by the French<br />
Government, in cooperation with the people of New Caledonia, to promote political,<br />
economic and social development in the Territory. The Forum expressed its<br />
continuing support for the agreements concluded in Paris in June and August .1988<br />
0as a framework for New Caledonia's peaceful progress to self-determination. It noted<br />
the progress made by the Government of Prime Minister Rocard to implement the<br />
agreements, including the recent elections leading to devolution of powers to<br />
provincial assemblies and a territorial congress in the Territory. It urged all parties to<br />
continue to work for the successful implementation of the agreements in a spirit of<br />
constructive dialogue and reconciliation.<br />
17. The Forum expressed the hope that consideration of New C aledonia by<br />
the United Nations Committee on Decolonisation ( C24) and the United Nations<br />
General Assembly would continue to be characterised by the consensus approach<br />
adopted in 1988.<br />
18. Forum Governments reiterated their willingness, collectively and<br />
individually, to contribute to the process of reconciliation and to the training process<br />
for New Caledonians in the lead up to the act of self-determination in 1998.<br />
19. The Forum restated its strong support for an act of self-determination<br />
consistent with the established decolonisation practices and principles of the United<br />
Nations, in which all options, including independence, would be open, and which<br />
would lead to a settlement that safeguards the rights of the indigenous Kanaks and<br />
all New Caledonians in a multiracial society. </p>
<p>Climatic Changes and Sea Levels<br />
The Forum expressed concern about the possible effects on island<br />
countries of rising sea levels resulting from global warming, and emphasised the<br />
importance of a regional approach to environmental matters. It agreed that Forum<br />
members should take decisive action to draw world attention to the way the<br />
environmental problem affected the South Pacific, and to represent regional views at<br />
appropriate international gatherings, possibly including by way of a resolution in the<br />
United Nations General Assembly. The Forum supported the candidature of New<br />
Zealand to the Governing Council of the United Nations Environmental Programme<br />
as one means of achieving this.<br />
21. The Forum welcomed confirmation by the Prime Minister of Australia that<br />
0 his Government would fund a core project over the next five years to establish a<br />
network of monitoring stations in the region to research such areas as changes in<br />
sea levels, atmospheric pressures, and rainfall patterns. The total cost, including the<br />
design phase, will be A$ 6.25m, with implementation to begin early in 1990. The<br />
Prime Minister emphasised that the results of this research would be available to all<br />
Forum members and suggested that this be done in the context of a programme of<br />
information exchange. He emphasised also Australia's commitment to a long-term<br />
programme in this area.<br />
South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty<br />
22. The Forum noted with appreciation the ratification of the Treaty by<br />
Solomon Islands, making that country the tenth Party to the Treaty, and the ratification<br />
of Protocols 2 and 3 by the People's Republic of China. It called upon those nuclear<br />
weapon states, which had not acceded to the Protocols, todo so as soon as possible.<br />
It also authorised the Secretariat to engage in cooperation and information exchange<br />
with the Organisation for the Prohibition of Nuclear Arms in Latin America ( OPANAL).<br />
23. The Forum recorded its deep concern at continuing nuclear testing in the<br />
region by France. A reduction in the number of tests was not what was sought. The<br />
Forum again called upon France to cease immediately all nuclear testing in the<br />
region. </p>
<p>( 4):-South Pacific Regional Environment Programme<br />
24. The Forum reaffirmed its strong support for the SPREP Convention and<br />
welcomed the active steps taken by several Forum countries to ratify this Convention.<br />
It urged the rest of the Forum countries to make their best endeavours to ratify the<br />
SPREP Convention and bring it into force at the earliest opportunity.<br />
INSTITUTIONAL ISSUES<br />
South Pacific Organisatlons Coordinating Committee ( SPOCC)<br />
The Forum welcomed and recognised the importance of SPOOC in<br />
0ensuring cooperation and coordination of activities among the various regional<br />
institutions. The first meeting of SPOCC was held successfully in March 1989.<br />
FORUM COUNTRY INITIATIVES<br />
26. The Forum endorsed initiatives by the Prime Minister of Australia on action<br />
to eliminate all forms of Chemical Weapons, the convening of a meeting of regional<br />
officials to discuss greater law enforcement cooperation, and a joint United<br />
Nations/ Australia sponsored Seminar on the Convention for the Elimination of All<br />
Forms of Discrimination Against Women. It also endorsed the forthcoming Seminar in<br />
Canberra on Security Issues in Oceania organised by the Australian National<br />
University.<br />
27. The Forum agreed that while there was a need for fair and accurate<br />
reporting in regional media, there was clear support for the principle of freedom of the<br />
press and that nothing should be done which could be interpreted as limiting that<br />
freedom. The Forum authorised the Secretariat to investigate the possibility of funding<br />
and convening a workshop for interested government and media representatives to<br />
consider measures to encourage well-informed and balanced reporting by regional<br />
media. </p>
<p>FORUM SECRETARIAT<br />
28. The Forum commended the Secretary General and his staff on their<br />
achievements since the last Forum. It emphasised the successful arrangements that<br />
had been put in place for the first Dialogue meetings, the increased activity by the<br />
Secretariat in projecting the region internationally, and the increased cooperation<br />
which was evident with other organisations in the region.<br />
FORUM FISHERIES AGENCY<br />
29. The Forum congratulated the Director of the Forum Fisheries Agency on<br />
the many valuable activities undertaken by his organisation for the benefit of the<br />
region. It welcomed the concept of the forthcoming Conference to mark the tenth<br />
anniversary of the Agency, at which its past programmes would be reviewed, and<br />
plans would be discussed for its activities over the next decade. The Forum noted<br />
with appreciation that Tonga had ratified the US Multilateral Fisheries Treaty, which<br />
meant that all Pacific Island Countries were now parties to the Treaty and its benefits.<br />
CCOP/ SOPAC The Forum noted with appreciation the various programme activities<br />
that were being administered by the Coordinating Committee for Mineral Prospecting<br />
in South Pacific Offshore Areas, CCOP/ SOPAC, to assist the Island member countries<br />
in identifying, assessing and managing the mineral, energy and other non-living<br />
marine resource potential of their respective exclusive economic zones. It also<br />
acknowledged the generous contribution and assistance of donor countries and<br />
agencies, both within and outside the South Pacific region, in supporting the work of<br />
CCOP/ SOPAC. The Forum noted the need for appropriate legislation to protect the<br />
region's marine and mining resources in accordance with the United Nations<br />
Convention on the Law of the Sea. </p>
<p>UNIVERSITY OF THE SOUTH PACIFIC<br />
31. The Forum expressed its satisfaction with the increasing contribution the<br />
University of the South Pacific had been able to make to development and education<br />
in the Island countries, and its hope that ways could be formed to increase its<br />
resources accordingly. It noted also the telecommunications and postal difficulties<br />
faced by the University in spreading educational services throughout the region.<br />
PACIFIC ISLANDS DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMME<br />
32. The Forum thanked the Director of the Pacific Islands Development<br />
Programme, who had been invited to adress the Forum following the establishment of<br />
SPOCC, for his organisation's work in the region<br />
OTHER BUSINESS Proposal by Nauru to be Accorded Small Island Country Status<br />
33. The Forum accepted a proposal by Nauru to be accorded Small Island<br />
Country status within the Forum.<br />
21ST SOUTH PACIFIC FORUM<br />
34. The Forum accepted with pleasure the invitation by the Prime Minister of<br />
Vanuatu to' host the 21st South Pacific Forum. It noted the generous offer of<br />
Federated States of Micronesia to host the 22nd South Pacific Forum in 1991.<br />

TARAWA DECLARATION<br />
The South Pacific Forum meeting at Tarawa on 10-1 .1 July 1989<br />
recognisIng the crucial dependence of the Pacific Island peoples on marine<br />
resources; profoundly concerned at the damage now being done by pelagic drift net<br />
fishing to the economy and environment of the South Pacific region;<br />
convinced that this indiscriminate, irresponsible and destructive fishing<br />
technique threatens the survival of the albacore tuna resource, and so the<br />
economic well-being of Forum Island Countries;<br />
deeply regretting that Japan and Taiwan have failed to respond to the concerns<br />
of regional countries about this most serious issue;<br />
noting that it is in the mutual interest of the major fishing nations active in the<br />
region, and the Forum, to conserve fisheries stocks;<br />
noting that all countries inside and outside the region are affected by the<br />
mismanagement of the resources of the world's oceans, by the environmental<br />
dangers of drift net fishing and by the threat to safe navigation;<br />
recalling the relevant provisions of the 1 982 United Nations Convention on the<br />
Law of the Sea, and in particular Articles 63, 64, 87, 116, 117, 118 and 119;<br />
recognising that the use of drift nets as presently employed in the Southern<br />
Pacific Albacore Tuna Fishery is not consistent with international legal<br />
requirements in relation to rights and obligations of high seas fisheries<br />
conservation and management and environmental principles; </p>
<p>resolves for the sake of this and succeeding generations of Pacific peoples to<br />
seek the establishment of a regime for the management of albacore tuna in the<br />
South Pacific that would ban drift net fishing from the region; such a ban might<br />
then be a first step to a comprehensive ban on such fishing;<br />
determines, to this end, to convene an urgent meeting of regional diplomatic,<br />
legal and fisheries experts to develop a Convention to give effect to its common<br />
resolve to create a zone free of drift net fishing;<br />
calls on the international community to support, and c6operate in, the urgent<br />
conclusion of a Convention establishing the zone;<br />
resolves that individual member states of the South Pacific Forum will take all<br />
possible measures in the interim to prevent drift net fishing within their waters,<br />
and otherwise actively to discourage the operations of drift net fishers;<br />
further resolves that member states acting individually and collectively will<br />
take what action they can within relevant international organisations to contribute<br />
to the cessation of this harmful form of fishing;<br />
commends the Republic of Korea for its decision to cease drift net fishing in the<br />
region; calls on Japan and Taiwan to follow this examp le, and abandon immediately<br />
their damaging drift net operations. </p>
