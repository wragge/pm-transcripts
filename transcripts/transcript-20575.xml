    <content><![CDATA[<p>I am pleased to announce the appointment of Peter Conran as Secretary to Cabinet and Head of the Cabinet Policy Unit with effect from 11 March 2003.</p>
<p>Peter Conran is a Senior Adviser in my office responsible for a variety of legal, industrial relations and other issues including border protection. He joined my staff in May 2001.</p>
<p> Peter Conran has extensive senior executive experience, including as Head of the Chief Minister's Department in the Northern Territory Government and at the deputy level of the Western Australian Ministry of the Premier and Cabinet. Peter brings to his new position extensive legal and policy experience, a strong understanding of the machinery of government and particular expertise in Commonwealth State relations. I am sure he will make a highly effective contribution to the work of the Government in his new role.</p>
<p>I would also like to take this opportunity to thank Paul McClintock for his excellent contribution to the work of the Government over the last nearly three years. Paul has been involved in all significant areas of Government decision making, particular achievements include the establishment of a more strategic approach to Government policy making and streamlined processes for Cabinet decision-making. Paul's links with the business community have proven particularly valuable in addressing major economic and financial issues facing the Government.</p>
<p>Paul has decided to return to the private sector and I wish him every success in his future endeavours.</p>
