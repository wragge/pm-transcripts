PRESS OFFICE TRANSCRIPT TUESDAY,. MARCH 4 1980<br />
INTERVIEW ON MIKE WILLESEE AFGHANISTAN<br />
Film clip of Mr Hayden on Willesee, March 3, 1980:<br />
" We resent very much the way Mr Fraser is prepared to<br />
misrepresent, distort, in the most vigorous way, what we stand<br />
for.<br />
Willesee: When have you ever gone so far in Parliament as to call somebody<br />
of Mr Fraser's level, a liar, lacking integrity, lacking in<br />
integrity, lacking in ethics, honesty, virtue, desperate and<br />
unprincipled I mean, it was an enormous attack Et was an<br />
emotional attack.<br />
Mr Hayden:<br />
Sure, and it was an enormous misrepresentation on the part of<br />
Mr Fraser.-It was a massive assault against* tue -Labor Party<br />
a despairing effort by a desp-arate man. Everyone in the backbench<br />
behind as well as the frontbench reacted the way I did. They were<br />
furious. It was outrageous what Mr Fraser did. Mr Fraser has never<br />
been under any doubt as to how I feel about him or indeed the<br />
Labor Party. He is easily the richest, the meanest and the most<br />
unscrupulous Prime Minister this country has every had, and I<br />
make no apologies about saying that.<br />
( End of film clip)<br />
Willesee: That is an unusually strong attack, and when Mr Hayden made that<br />
last night I countered by sat ing that we would give the Prime Ministe<br />
a right of reply, and the Prime Minister is in our Canberra studio<br />
right now in Parliament House. Let's cross to the Prime Minister,<br />
Mr Fraser. Thanks for.-coming in, Mr Prime Minister.<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
Thank you very much.<br />
Willesee: What do you say to that?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
I don't really think I want to say anything to it because I believe<br />
the language was extreme and quite unjustified. I would like to<br />
talk about the policies surrounding these particular matters<br />
because I think it is important that they be discussed, and I<br />
regret very greatly the kind of language that has been used in the<br />
Parliament, and apparently in other places also. </p>
<p>-2<br />
Willesee: So none of those particular words worry you to the extent that<br />
you would like to reply to them?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
I don't like them,, Of course, I don't. But if I was going to<br />
want to reply to the slightly unkind things that are said about<br />
me from one week to the next, or one year to the next<br />
Willesee: More than slightly...<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
I know that but, is that my typical understatement perhaps?<br />
I think we could have a profitable discussion about issues. I also.<br />
believe that anything I have said about the Australian Labor Party<br />
on this issue has been accurate, can be demonstrated to be so,<br />
but that again doesn't help to get to a public understanding of the<br />
issues which are of vast and enormous importance to the future of<br />
all the Australian people.<br />
Willesee: But that's the whole problem, isn't it? The issue has been obscured<br />
by the rhetoric and the emotional outbursts in Parliament.~.<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
I think it has and I am now trying to say, " Let's talk about the<br />
issues" because the issues are important.<br />
Willesee: Do you concede that you might have gone too far on your part in<br />
that emotional rhetoric?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
Have you looked at the. Parliament, the record, the Hansard?<br />
Willesee: I have read it all, and I have read it all with great repetition<br />
because you said it many times.<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
Said what many times?<br />
Wille see:<br />
Well, in particular your attitude of the Labor Party having a thread<br />
in it or a part of it which was, to paraphrase, soft on the Russian<br />
invasion of Afhganistan. ./ 3 </p>
<p>-3<br />
* Prime Minister:<br />
I think the words I used were ' finding excuses for or reasons why<br />
we should do nothing'. The thing that is puzzling me about this,'<br />
in part, is that while the Labor Party condemn the invasion of<br />
Afghanistan just as vigorously as anyone else, so there is agreement<br />
about that, but while Mr Hayden also says that an effective boycott<br />
of the Olyrtipic Games will bring the message home to the Soviet<br />
government and people, more effectively than anything else, then<br />
he and the Labor Party won't work for it. And I believe that if<br />
you condemn what the Soviets have done, as we all do, and if you<br />
then believe that an effective boycott of the Olympic Games<br />
would bring this message home to the Soviet government, but<br />
even more important than that, to the Soviet people, in an<br />
effective and realistic way, then I think there is a moral<br />
obligation to work for that effective boycott.<br />
Willesee: Let's start with what went wrong with our Australian leaders.<br />
You agree that you both have that commonality, what went wrong?<br />
Let's start with you. What did you do that was wrong?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
Is this going to be a programme for self confession? Quite<br />
seriously..<br />
Willesee:-if I could be constructive, Mr Prime Minister you can't get<br />
that bi-partisan non-political approach unless you both concede<br />
some error.<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
I am trying to make it as easy as possible by emphasising the<br />
points in which the parties are in agreement. I have been making<br />
the point that if one thinks that in an effective boycott of the<br />
Olympic Games will get the message through to the Soviet government<br />
and people, and there is agreement on that, why then is it so hard<br />
to work for that effective boycott. You see, on all the earlier<br />
statements Mr Hayden had made, I believe there was every juqtificatior<br />
for believing that the Australian Labor Party would support the<br />
Government in working for these things. There have been, as I<br />
believe, a very large number of countries around the world that<br />
take the same view, where the governments are working for an<br />
effective boycott, ironically, the leader of the Opposition,<br />
the Labor leader of the Opposition, in New Zealand is saying that<br />
Mr Muldoon should be stronger on the issue and work more effectively<br />
for a boycott, so, it is not something where people are necessarily<br />
divided on philosphical or party grounds...<br />
Willesee: divided on the boycott issue, aren't they?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
But not between countries.' am mak-ing the point..<br />
Willesee: . Australia.. </p>
<p>-4<br />
Prime minister:<br />
In Australia no I think in the wider community people have views<br />
on this issue quite irrespective of their party political affiliations.<br />
Wille see:<br />
Well, could you have done better, and I hope I am saying it<br />
constructively, by talking to the Labor Party, before you<br />
proposed the boycott?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
Again, having in mind the fact that Mr Hayden had also said that an<br />
effective boycott would get the message home, through , to the Soviet<br />
govern-ment and people, and that was one of his first statements<br />
on the question of boycotts. I would have thought that one could<br />
expect that that would therefore be worked for by the Australian<br />
Labor Party, and I am puzzled, and remain puzzled as. -to why they<br />
don't. Willesee: You have become upset, and I can understand i-t about the emotive<br />
issue of wool from your property, Nareen, going to Russia, becausein<br />
logic it is not relavent. But, in emotive terms, of course,<br />
it has become highly irrelevant highly relevant, I'm sorry...<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
You were right the first time, but for the purposes of the interview,<br />
you have got to say, relevant.<br />
Willesee: Yes, but, is that the real problem? Emotion? Is that what gave the<br />
Labor Party the chance to bat you around the head?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
If they took that Course because they thought they could bat<br />
me around t42 head over wool sales, well then, quite obviously,<br />
there was never an opportunity of getting a bi-partisan policy,<br />
because, a couple of points have been known by the Australian<br />
Labor Party for a long while. One, almost an irrelevancy.:. that<br />
wool was sold before the war began. But also, by the time they<br />
started to attack Fraser, for wool that was alleged to be his<br />
but had been sold before the occasion and therefore wasn't mine.<br />
And people know how the auction system works you put your wool<br />
into the ring and anyone of 200 people buy it. You don't know<br />
where it goes that, in this case,, all happened before the war<br />
began the invasion of Afghanistan. Even before they started to<br />
talk about that, they had said that a boycott of trade with the<br />
Soviet Union wouldn't work., and especially for farm products.<br />
It would be dangerous and unfortunate if we went down that path.<br />
So, they had already put themselves against a boycott on trade<br />
matters. Willesee: You're talking political sophistication. The people in the street<br />
who we work hard to keep in touch with., and we have done several<br />
street surveys on this matter people talk in simple terms-</p>
<p>Willesee: ( cont.)<br />
the athletes are being punished, but Malcolm Fraser can sell wool<br />
and make some money.<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
Can I make a couple of points about that, because the Australian<br />
Labor Party had said, and you don't want me to look up the quotes<br />
but I have brought them in with me if you want it, from Mr Hayden<br />
and from others, which show that they were opposed to a boycott<br />
of trade, especially opposed to a boycott of farm produce.<br />
Willesee: We accept that.<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
All right, you accept that...<br />
Willesee: Mr Prime Minister, if I could interrupt, I really would like you<br />
to address yoarself to the people who take that simple approach,<br />
well why should the athletes be punished and Malcolm Fraser can<br />
sell his wool or other traders can trade. That's the thing that<br />
sticks in-the mind...<br />
Prime M inister:<br />
. on the basis of all traders, and let's deal then with the trade<br />
position. There is no point and Mr Hayden again was<br />
right in this in Australian pursuing trade sanctions which are<br />
not going to be supported by other countries and other places.<br />
What we-are doingon trade matters is just as vigorous as anything<br />
that other countries are doing. We have said that we will support<br />
a list of strategic gc-! ids and whatever is on that as part of the,<br />
European approach to these particular matters, if additional<br />
goods, if commodities happen at some future time to get put<br />
on that list, then obviously we take note of it, but at this<br />
point they haven't, and there is no point. As Mr Hayden has said,'<br />
in pursuing a trade boycott, which the Russians will-get around<br />
because they will buy it somewhere else, and which no other country<br />
is trying to pursue...<br />
Willesee: So you are saying that if it is going to hurt them you will stop,<br />
if it is just going to hurt us, there is no point?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
If it is just going to hurt us, if it is just going to hurt Australia<br />
and it is not a question of wool growers.<br />
Willesee: That is the simple message, isn't it?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
Yes it is. / 6 </p>
<p>-6<br />
Willesee: That both of you are trying to say that really., hasn't got<br />
across. Prime Minister:<br />
Well, you say it again as you did it as you said it then.<br />
Willesee: If it is going to hurt them, you take action. If it is simply<br />
going to hurt us, you don't do it.<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
There is no point, and I think that is a very good way of putting~<br />
it. But can I say something about the Olympic Games, and Why I<br />
think that the boycott of the Olympic Games and why I think that is.<br />
important. For two years, the Soviet government has built up<br />
this issue to their own people. All the countries of the world<br />
coming here. Their athletes, their countries paying homage to<br />
the first Socialist state, as a mark of approval of the Soviet<br />
government's foreign policies. Now, how do you get it home to<br />
the Soviet people, that we don't approve of their foreign policy.<br />
That is it putting the world on the brink of a great danger, flags<br />
absent, athletes not appearing, all the Soviet experts that I<br />
have discussed it with, and including Mr Hayden himself, have said<br />
that this is the most effective way of getting the message through<br />
to the Soviet government and people. It is a public thing it<br />
can't be hidden.<br />
Willesee: Yes, it is very difficult to argue with that. I think that maybe<br />
you might agree that the problem is getting the message ' across<br />
of domestic politics in Australia..<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
I think that you have done a great service in helping to get<br />
that through in making that comment if it hurts the-Soviets,<br />
you do it, if it just hurts us, we don't do it.<br />
Wille see:<br />
We are running out of time, Prime Minister, but I would like to<br />
raise two points briefly. One, Mr Hayden did have a crack at you<br />
last night. Do you think that he is under inordinate pressure?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
I would have thought inevitably after the last weekend, and I<br />
have thought, sometimes, that within~ his own-Party he-is under great<br />
pressure. But, I don't want to reply in kind,. I really don't, and<br />
I am not going to.<br />
Willesee: All right, so I will leave it with one more question. Have you<br />
been under inordinate pressure bear in your mind thie Parliamentary<br />
performance and your clash with another television interviewer. / 7 </p>
<p>7<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
I hope that you have read that interview, because I enjoyed it<br />
nearly as much as I am enjoying this one. The worst pressure I<br />
feel is when I am in . a Willesee interview to make sure that<br />
it keeps moving and interesting and good humoured. Is that fair<br />
enough Willesee: That will get in quotes of the week, I promise. The other point<br />
is that if we are really fair dinkum. about a bi-partisan approach,<br />
and surely that must be the way if we are serious about international<br />
politics something of the magnitude of the Russian invasion of<br />
Afghanistan you have failed so far to get that, Bill Hayden<br />
has failed so far to get that, and I think the people expect it,<br />
what can you do about it?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
I think you gave the answer to that, by making it perfectly plain<br />
that Mr Hayden was pursuing the dual question of-Olympics coupled<br />
with trade, because of the fact that I grow wool gave him the<br />
bat to belt me around the head with, and so you gave the answer<br />
to it, because if he hadn't taken hold of that bat to knock<br />
me on the-head with, if he hadn't seen that opportunity, I think.<br />
he would have been taking quite different attitudes to a number<br />
of these questions, and would have followed through on his original<br />
statements a boycott of the Games would be effective, a boycott<br />
of trade would be totally ineffective.<br />
Willesee, ' if you could see a situation where both you and Mr. Hayden could speak<br />
unemotionally to the people of Australia and put your points of<br />
view, and seek their reaction would you agree to that?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
What do you mean? On the Willesee programme?<br />
T,-illesee:<br />
Yes, that would be ideal I would imagine. It hasn't worked in the<br />
Parliament, has it.<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
No, but I don't really think it would work on your programme either<br />
because you read out or you showed at the beginning of the programme<br />
the sorts of things that Mr Hayden said about me.<br />
Willesee: But if you say that then how can you really seriously seek a<br />
bi-partisan non-political approach?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
Again I think you gave the answer to why that won't workc under the<br />
current circumstances, and Mr Hayden has said some very stronq<br />
things. I suppose I could adopt an approach which. Carlton tried to<br />
adopt with Alex Jesaulenko, but I don't think that would work either </p>
<p>8<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
so I am not going to.<br />
Willesee: That was very unAustralian.<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
What was unAustralian?<br />
Willesee: Treating Jessa like that a great footballer.<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
I have got some divided loyalties. I am a very violent Carlton<br />
supporter, but I am certainly going to have some soft spot for<br />
St Kilda and Alex; Jesaulenko when he is playing.<br />
Willesee: You have just lost 25,000 votes and picked up another 200,000, I think.<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
Which ones did I lose and which ones did I gain.<br />
Willesee: You lost Carlton and you picked up St. Kilda.<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
Oh no, I didn'. t lose Carlton because I suspect that the large<br />
number of Carlton supporters and barrackers-still have a great<br />
affection for what Alex Jesaulenko has done for that club.<br />
Willesee: How did. we get. onto the subject?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
It's a question of keeping the interview moving.<br />
Willesee-Also, Melbourne:. Tootballis a priority always.<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
Yes it is.<br />
Willesee: But wouldn't you look I mean, a referendum is far too difficult,<br />
but if you could have professionally conducted opinion polls...<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
You cannot conduct a foreign policy or a major matter of government.. / 9 </p>
<p>9<br />
Willesee: But this is a divisive community issue.<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
But you cannot conduct a major element of policy by the polls,<br />
by an opinion poll or by a referendum, because a government<br />
has got to make up its mind what it believes to be right. It then<br />
has to argue for it, and argue as strongly as it can and as well<br />
as it knows how, and that is the way it goes. On this particular<br />
matter in which I have got the deepest of all possible convictions,<br />
I think we need to support each other, independent nations of the<br />
world, support the efforts of the United States and of the leading<br />
countries in Europe to try and stop this world in the 1980s going<br />
through the tragic and dangerous path that it took in the latter<br />
part of the 1930s. If we believe that, if I believe. that, I can't<br />
put it to a poll to judge it you know, a -Gallup Poll. I have<br />
to argue for it because I believe it, and it is a fundamental<br />
signficance to the future, the freedom and to the happiness of<br />
every Australian. </p>
