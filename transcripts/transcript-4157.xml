AUSTRALIAN SOCIETY OF SENIOR EXECUTIVES<br />
Extract from an address by the Acting Prime Minister, Minister<br />
for National Resources and Overseas Trade, the Rt. Hon. J. D.<br />
Anthony, Dinner, Lazar's Restaurant, Melbourne, 16th June 1976.<br />
It is important that people understand the purpose of<br />
the Government's actions.<br />
Why is the Government cutting back so strongly on<br />
spending? Why are we reducing numbers in the Public Service?<br />
Why are so many good and worthwhile programs and projects being<br />
slowed down, delayed and deferred? Why are we now asking those<br />
who can afford to do so to make a bigger contribution to the<br />
cost of their health insurance?<br />
We are doing these things, as unpopular as they are, so<br />
that we can regain control of the country's finances control<br />
which our predecessors went perilously close to losing, if they<br />
hadn't in fact lost it.<br />
We are doing things so that we can begin to bring the<br />
massive budget deficit we inherited back to more manageable<br />
proportions. We want to do that so we can get inflation under control.<br />
And we must get inflation under control because it is the<br />
economic and social disease whose symptoms we see in massive<br />
unemployment, stagnation in industry and the most hurtful burdcuii<br />
being placed on our pensioners, our small businesses, our farmers<br />
and, most significantly, our exporters.<br />
I believe we are now seeing early yet clear signs of<br />
economic recovery.<br />
I also believe there is wide acceptance in the community<br />
of the need for the kind of firm action the Government is taking.<br />
We were elected to do the job of pulling the economy<br />
back into shape, and people expect us to do what is necessary<br />
to achieve that objective.<br />
No doubt some elements in the unions will try to frustrate<br />
our efforts, but I am sure the great majority of people are<br />
prepared to have the patience and to accept the discipline nceedc<br />
_ o get the economic situation under control. / 2 </p>
<p>2.<br />
The Government believes that the connection between<br />
excessive wage rises and inflation and unemployment is becoming<br />
much better understood throughout the community.<br />
We have recently had very useful discussions with the<br />
p ACTU, and I think we can all be very encouraged by the<br />
constructive and positive atmosphere in which that meeting took<br />
place. What the discussions should have made clear to the whole<br />
community is that we are all in this fight together. If we're<br />
not, we might as well give it away now.<br />
I think too that the community is now more aware of the<br />
fact that a Government that tries to spend its way out of<br />
economic problems only drags the country deeper into trouble.<br />
Our experience of the last two years should have shown<br />
us that. In the task we have set ourselves of reducing the very<br />
bloated budget deficit, we have to remember that there are<br />
really only two ways of doing it by cutting back on government<br />
spending, or by imposing higher taxes.<br />
But taxation in Australia is already too high.<br />
Our predecessors were not prepared, or did not appreciate<br />
the need, to take substantial steps to relieve the tax burden.<br />
In fact, they needed inflation to produce the revenue<br />
to pay for their generosity.<br />
By holding down government spending, we have been able to<br />
bring in one of the most far-reaching taxation reforms ever seen<br />
in this country tax indexation. This will give people greater<br />
opportunity to look after themselves.<br />
But, while this is a major step, I believe there is a<br />
need for considerable amount of further reform when we are in<br />
a position to do it.<br />
For example, the tax scales need adjustment to remove<br />
anomalies. They will, o. f course, be adjusted for indexation purposes,<br />
but the basic income groupings also need revisic,-.<br />
Company taxation needs to be reviewed, an&amp; we will be<br />
reviewing-it.<br />
The present stock valuation system and de--re-ciation<br />
allowances need to be revised so that bezter-account can be<br />
taken of inflation. </p>
<p>3.<br />
Private comnanies are at a grave disadvantage beside<br />
public companies i-raising funds for new investment because<br />
of the existing t res relating to retention of profits.<br />
The Treas-. urer has already said that we will give private<br />
companies the option of being taxed as partnerships.<br />
But the burden placed on private companies by the<br />
retention allowance provision must be eased.<br />
In the field in which I have special responsibilities,<br />
-he. r is great need for a fresh look at the taxation arrangements<br />
cplying to mining exploration and development.<br />
I think it is quite unrealistic to fail to see mining<br />
tLhse utilisation of a resource that has a limited life.<br />
The tax laws should take account of that fact as they<br />
i. until three years ago.<br />
These are all matters which need to be locked at<br />
when, I repeat, the economic situation allows us to do so.<br />
Bringing about that fundamental improvement by getting<br />
inflation under control must remain our prime cbjective for<br />
the immediate future.<br />
If the economic recovery now beginning to take shape<br />
is to. be a lasting one, inflation must be brought back to a<br />
level we can cope with.<br />
