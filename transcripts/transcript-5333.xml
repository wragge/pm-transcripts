FOR MEDIA MONDAY, 28 APRIL, 1980<br />
WALTER AND ELIZA HALL INSTITUTE<br />
The Prime Minister, Mr. Malcolm Fraser, and the Victorian<br />
Premier, Mr. R. J. Hamer, today jointly announced a grant<br />
of $ 200,000 for a feasibility study for a new building<br />
for the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research.<br />
Half the grant will be provided by the Commonwealth Government<br />
and half by the Victorian Government. The grant, which is in<br />
the context of provision of facilities for medical research<br />
in Victoria, will be made forthwith.<br />
The Prime Minister, who visited the Institute today, and was<br />
given an exposition of its work by the Director,<br />
Professor Sir Gustav Nossall, said it was a matter of. great<br />
pride to Australians that the Institute was amongst the<br />
world's foremost research bodies in the field of-immunology.<br />
This was reaffirmed only last year by an expert.<br />
international scientific review Committee sponsored<br />
by the National Health and Medical Research Council.<br />
However, the Institute's capacity to contribute further<br />
outstanding scientific research, particularly towards<br />
prevention and treatment of cancer was dependent largely<br />
on additional modern laboratory facilities.<br />
* The Prime Minister said further consideration of a new building<br />
and the method of funding it would be given when the results<br />
of the study were available. 000---</p>
