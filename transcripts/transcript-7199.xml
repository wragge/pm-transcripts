PRIME MINiSTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 21 JULY 1987<br />
I wish to indicate that with the cooperation of my Caucus<br />
colleagues the representational outcome for the Ministry<br />
that I want will be fully achieved.<br />
There will b three Queenclandero, three women and a<br />
TaeGanian. This will appropriately and precisely refloct<br />
the wicheo X have expressed on the basic of the desirable<br />
repreGentation of all Statec and women.<br />
The Government is blessed with an abundance of talent on its<br />
enlarged bachkbnch and it is therefore appropriate to say<br />
that opportvnities will arise during the course of this<br />
Parliament for new faces to enter the Ministry. This<br />
process of chango and development will be consistent with<br />
the process of restructuring that we will be engendering in<br />
the Auatralaan economy.<br />
I express my appreciation to the individuals and groups who<br />
have respondcd to oy wishes on these important issues and<br />
indicate to those individuals that they will be welcome<br />
candidates to fill positions in the Ministry when such<br />
vacancies acice. </p>
