21 March 1997 TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
THE HON JOHN HOWARD MP<br />
WITH THE TREASURIER, THE HON PETER COSTELLO M] P<br />
PRESS CONFERENCE AFTER PREMIERS' CONFERENCE<br />
PARLIAMENT HOUSE, CANBERRA<br />
E O E<br />
The meeting was shorter and quieter than last year. There was a ready acceptance by<br />
the States for the Commonwealth bonouring the commitments made last year in<br />
relation to the financial assistance grants. We did agree to special requests from both<br />
the Australian Capital Territory and Tasmania to defer half of their contributions for<br />
this year into next year. That was put forward as a special request from those two<br />
jurisdictions because of the particular economic circumstances and it was supported by<br />
the other states and the Commonwealth agreed to that. In relation to the specific<br />
purpose payments the Commonwealth confirmed the offer document which is the<br />
amount of specific purpose payments in the for-ward estimates and we said as a<br />
maximum in the budget process we would cut 1.3% off those specific purpose<br />
payments. Last year we said that we would cut three percent as a maximum off the<br />
specific purpose payments as outlined in the forward estimates. It is fair to say the<br />
States weren't happy with that figure but of course that is not a negotiated figure. The<br />
idea that you reach agreement on what we pay another party out of our budget has<br />
never been a part of Premiers" conferences. In the end, like any other outlay, the<br />
Commonwealth wil determnine how much is paid out of the budget. The meeting also<br />
at the end had a very intense and helpfiul discussion about what of course is the<br />
predominant domestic challenge Australia faces at the moment and that is to find a<br />
resolution to the very difficult Wik issue. it was a very good discussion and it was of<br />
great assistance to me in the light of my meeting on Sunday afternoon at the Lodge<br />
with representatives of the indigenous community, the mining industry and the<br />
National Farmers Federation and I took the opportunity fortuitously of this gathering<br />
to get the views of the State Premiders. Last night in particular they expressed<br />
appreciation of the fact that on this occasion with this government they have been fully<br />
consulted and fully involved in discussing matters relating to Native Title. But overall<br />
as Premiers' conferences go, it was a fairly straightforward meeting. Inevitably there<br />
are disagreements. States rarely express rapture at the financial offers of the<br />
Commonwealth; we kept our word on the financial assistance grants; we gave a little<br />
special assistance to Tasmania and the ACT, we said that at a maximum we might take<br />
Faoxm 21/ 03/ 97 19: 08 Pg: 1 </p>
<p>Fax from $ 139 million out of $ 10 690 million of specific purpose payments to the States, that<br />
being the figure in the forward estimates.<br />
JOURNALIST: Is that figure, 1. 3 inclIude a one percent additions in the.. that you foreshadowed some<br />
time ago?<br />
COSTELLO: The efficiency dividend which was announced in last years budget was in relation to<br />
running costs on specific purpose payments. It's already been factored into the<br />
specific purpose payments. What our forward estimates have in them, is as the Prime<br />
Minister said, an air1ount for specific purpose payments of $ 10 692 million. We said in<br />
our budget we couldn't see us affecting that by more than 1.3% and we won't. Now,<br />
what it actually is, t may be less but it certainly can't be more. Last year we said we<br />
wouldn't affect sp ilic purpose payments by more than 3% we affected them by two<br />
and a half.<br />
JOURNALIST:<br />
They say that you lare forcing them to make the tax increases, that you aren't man<br />
enough to make yourself They are going back to...<br />
PRIME NMNSTP;:<br />
They wanted me to break my commitment to the Australian people about putting up<br />
tax. it's always easy to tell somebody else to break his or her promise.<br />
JOURNALIST: They're going back~ to their states to galvanise public opinion now, it's the Howard<br />
tax, the Costello tW, to this service and so on. Are you happy to wear that?<br />
PIM M1NISTIR<br />
Well Ii think it will l e seen as part of the ritualistic aftermath of Preiers' conferences.<br />
The public has heard it before. Can I just give you one little statistic. Even if we were<br />
to cut the whole $ 139 million out of the specific purpose payments, total<br />
Commonwealth pa r ents to the States in 1997/ 98 would rise by about If we<br />
didn't cut one dollar out of our own purpose payments in the coming budget, they will<br />
be rising by We obviously will cut many millions of dollars out of the forward<br />
estimates in relation to the Conmmonwealth's own purpose payments so the point I<br />
simply make is that any suggestion that we are cutting the States harder than we are<br />
cutting ourselves is wrong. Fafru~ 21/ 03/ 97 19: 08 Pg: 2 </p>
<p>Fax from JOURNALIST: as a maximum is a bit bigger for the Commonwealth to be adding to its own<br />
purpose outlays in the Budget?<br />
PRIME MINSTER:<br />
I don't want to get into that but we will obviously not....<br />
JOURNALIST: inaudible...<br />
PRIME, MINITER:<br />
Well what is relevant is to look at all of the payments to the States and when you lump<br />
in the financial assistance grants and the specific purpose payments. In the forward<br />
estimates they are up by 1. 1 which will take away the $ 139 million that gives you the<br />
0.7 and what I'm saying is that even if we didn't take a dollar out of our payments,<br />
we're on We're obviously going to take many dollars out so from what those<br />
sort of arguments and comparisons are worth.., it can hardly be said that we are asking<br />
them to carry a burden that we are not carrying ourselves.<br />
JOURNALIST: limit the cuts in the budget to your own purpose payments to you're saying<br />
now that that's not the case?<br />
PRIME MNISTER:<br />
Well, I'm saying the figures are as I describe them.<br />
COSTELLO:<br />
Can I give you the actual figures? The actual figures are....<br />
PRIME MNISTER:<br />
are better. Well they are! I<br />
COSTELLO: Of course they are Prime Minister! In 1996/ 97 the actual payments to the States are<br />
$ 33 billion $ 188 million. Our forward estimates show including the increase in the<br />
FAGS, the financial assistance grants, that in 1997/ 98, it would be $ 33 billion $ 553<br />
millon, that is a 1.1 % increase. We reserve the right to reduce that $ 33 billion $ 55 3<br />
million dollars by $ 139 million. We reserve that right. If we exercise that right the<br />
increase would be 0.7% rather than 1. 1% that's the worst the States could do. The<br />
point the Prime Mnister is making is the best the Commonwealth could do, that is if<br />
Fa om21/ 63/ 97 19: 08 Pg: 3 </p>
<p>Fax from no money were cut out of Commonwealth owned purposes is That's the best<br />
the Commonwealth could do.<br />
PRIM MINISTER:<br />
And I can assure you that won't be the case because we will be cutting out of our own<br />
purpose outlays, so that sort of disposes of the argument that in some way we're being<br />
harder on the States than on ourselves.<br />
JOURNALIST:<br />
Can you tell us what the difference would be for the second fiscal year, 1998/ 9 which<br />
is your target fiscal year?<br />
COSTELLO:<br />
Well this was only in relation to 1997/ 8. In relation to 1998/ 9, there would be the real<br />
increase plus the fa9 that it's only been reduced by 50% would lead to substantive<br />
increases. I can't give a figure but it would be greater in 1998/ 99 on current policy, but<br />
we haven't discussed specific purpose. paymnents for 1998/ 9 yet with the States. But<br />
the point that the Prime Minister makes is, the Conumonwealth has never agreed on<br />
specific purpose payments announced with the States.<br />
PVM NIST R.-<br />
it's an alien notion to the whole Premiers' Conference procedure. You don't negotiate<br />
an agreement on specific.... I mean, last year I didn't negotiate an agreement with the<br />
states, I told the Premiers that in response to a question, that we did not expect that<br />
the reductions in the specific purpose payments would be greater than 3% off the<br />
forward estimates 4nd they expressed satisfaction with that assurance, and it ended<br />
being 2.5% but you don't reach an agreement on these things. I mean, you listen and<br />
you are courteous and we were and we did.<br />
JOURNALIST: I<br />
Mr Howard what was your position in terms of the States arguing this afternoon for a<br />
significant change in the rights to negotiate process under the Native Title Act?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well that issue along with a number of other issues has been under discussion for quite<br />
some time and I'm not going to in the interests of keeping all the options that ought to<br />
be on the table on th~ e table. I'm not going to get into the detail of what was discussed<br />
this afternoon or last night or what was discussed about 10 days ago when I had a<br />
meeting with Mr Borbidge. I'm trying to get an agreed outcome and I want to express<br />
my appreciation of the very constructive attitude that the Prerniers have taken, and I<br />
include all of the Premiers in that. I include the Premier of New South Wales as much<br />
as I include the Premiers of the other States. I think they are genuinely trying to reach<br />
an agreement. It's going to be very hard because the parties are still a long way apart.<br />
Fa rom21/ 03/ 97 19: 00 Pg: 4 </p>
<p>Fax from JOURNALIST: Can I ask what's your expectation after your talks today on the timidng of a decision by<br />
you on this? Secondly, we were talking a little earlier by Tracker Tiilmouth, that they<br />
are hoping to see you I think on Tuesday. Can you confirm whether that will be<br />
PI3M MINISTER:<br />
Well the answer to that second question is yes and I'm also having a meeting with all<br />
of them together on Sunday and I am having second meeting with...<br />
JOURNALIST: This Sunday?<br />
PRIE MINISTER.<br />
This Sunday in two days' time, and on Tuesday I am having a meeting with a group<br />
of the indigenous leaders including Tracker Tilimouth, so the answer to that is yes.<br />
My expectation on timing? It is really no different from what I've been saying up until<br />
now. I've said about Easter. Well we are getting pretty close to about Easter.<br />
Obviously if we are on the verge of a breakthrough in this area and you need another<br />
week or two or threF, well, nobody's going to quibble about that. On the other hand if<br />
it looks over the course of the next week or two we are not on the verge of break<br />
through I may w911 shortly after I come back from China be putting certain<br />
recommendations tq the Federal Cabinet.<br />
JOURNALIST: I<br />
Did you put a package to the Premiers this afternoon, did you put forward a proposal?<br />
PRIME MHISTE I:<br />
No, I had a discussipn with them last night and then there were some discussions from<br />
the... I then had some discussions this morning with one or two of them and then there<br />
were some discussigns between my office, federal offices and state officers and then<br />
there was fuarther discussion around some proposals that came out of those discussions<br />
this afternoon. It's pne of these things that just keeps rolling on and on and on.<br />
JOURNALIST: Have you put a central proposal of.. -to put to the various parties?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Look I'm trying to, reach an outcome that respects the opposition of the indigenous<br />
people to extinguish but delivers the certainty to which I believe the farmers of this<br />
country are rightfiull entitled, and it is very hard. Fa rom21/ 03/ 97 19: 08 Pg: </p>
<p>Fax from : 21/ 03/ 97 19: 08 Pg: 6<br />
JOURNALIST: Are you more confident now than you were say, a week ago?<br />
PRIE MNISTER:<br />
About the same. Going in a straight line. Reasonably flat but nonetheless straight.<br />
JOURNALIST: After lagt night's discussion on this matter were you disappointed when this morning<br />
Mr Court and Mr Borbidge came out with very strong statements saying that they<br />
basically settled for kiothing short of extinguishment?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:-<br />
I didn't actually seq those statements. Seriously, I don't want to sound di singenuous<br />
but the only Prengier I heard this morning was the epitome of sweetness and<br />
reasonableness. I 4ieard the Victorian Premier being interviewed on Radio National<br />
and he correctly described my determination to bend over backwards to try and reach<br />
an agreement which was satisfactory to all parties. I understand the feelings of people<br />
on this and I am trying hard to get an agreement within the parameters I described to<br />
Laura and it's very -hard and I can't say that I'm overwhelmingly confident that it can<br />
be achieved but I do understand the view of the Aboriginal community about<br />
extinguishment but they must also understand that if there is to be an alternative to<br />
extinguishment if we are to stop short of extinguishment, we have got to reach an<br />
agreement that delivers certainty to the farmers of Australia and also a regime which<br />
prevents scores of Century Zincs.<br />
I mean, the Century Zinc thing has been a disgrace and essentially Century Zinc has<br />
been a disaster. It's a condemnation of the Native Title Act as it now stands and<br />
perhaps the most interesting development in this whole debate is the growing incidence<br />
of Aboriginal elders and people in the Aboriginal community condemning the existing<br />
Native Title Act, the Waanyi elders who came to see me three or four weeks ago were<br />
bitterly critical of the operation of the Native Title Act so, I mean, I understand the<br />
concern of the Aboriginal people about extinguishment. They must understand that<br />
we've got to have some very dramatic changes to the present system otherwise it<br />
won't work.<br />
JOURNALIST: ( inaudible) as a result of the consultations? How much is your own view of how this.. </p>
<p>Fax from PIME MINISTER:<br />
My broad view hasn't changed. Look, you have a view. I've had from the very<br />
beginning an idea as to how you might reach an accommodation in this area if there<br />
was some goodwill from all parties and I have been trying all sorts of proposals and<br />
you put a set of proposals in some discussion and then people react to that and you<br />
add a bit and then you try somebody else and you take a bit away and you add a bit<br />
more and you just keep trying until you get something that everybody clicks on. Now<br />
in the end that might happen. In the end it mightn't. Then I've got to decide what<br />
recommendation I put to the Government.<br />
JOURNALIST: You've described this as a ritualistic aftermath of the states ( inaudible) in the Premiers'<br />
Conference. Is it a ritualistic aftermath to have the Treasurer of Victoria accusing you<br />
of abandoning Federation and saying that ( inaudible) your own expenses ( inaudible)<br />
PRIE MINISTER:<br />
Yes. I've heard worse than that.<br />
JOURNALIST: . the aftermath to have the Premiers and Treasurers leave without an agreement on<br />
financial jpayments to the states which we have..<br />
PRIME NMNISTER:<br />
Look there's no, the agreement stands. They made it clear in the room.<br />
JOURNALIST:<br />
The state Treasurers said that there was a total confict between yourself and the<br />
Treasurer about exactly what was going on. Mr Egan said that when he asked a<br />
question of you, you nodded and Costello shook his head. I mean, why...<br />
PRIM MINISTER:<br />
Mr Egan has a particular way of putting things.<br />
JOURNALIST: Why was there so much confusion about...<br />
PREME MINISTER:<br />
There wasn't any confusion about it but Mr Egan always likes to add a bit of colour.<br />
Fa om21/ 03/ 97 19: 08 Pg: 7 </p>
<p>Fax from JOURNALIST: Why were all of the Treasurers confused about it and saying that you were ambiguous?<br />
PRIMIE MNI4STER:<br />
I wasn't ambiguous because they introduced into the discussion a figure that wasn't in<br />
the offer document and a figure which hasn't been discussed in the discussions that I<br />
had had privately with the Premiers last night. I mean, let's get this straight. Last<br />
night we had a discussion and the Premier of Victoria I think it was, said to me, ' Well,<br />
we seem to have got a very civilised outcome on the financial assistance grants and the<br />
commonwealth is offering its deal. Now what about the specific purpose payments?"<br />
And he said, last year you put a ceiling of 3% on any cuts? You know, what sort of<br />
figure have you got in mind this year? And I said, in the order of 1 2. He said, we'd<br />
like it closer to one than two. If it goes close to two there will be a lot of trouble.<br />
JOURNALIST: What was the figure that the Treasurers made up?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Some figure of 0.8. And it was on the figure of 0.8 that this question, various<br />
questions were put to me, Look, it's always been the case that Treasurers and<br />
Premiers complain about specific purpose decisions by the Commonwealth.<br />
JOURNALIST: Aren't you nevertheless ( inaudible) the point there, some services simply can't keep<br />
being cut, like public hospitals and so on?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Actually, if you look at the contributions to public hospitals, the commonwealth<br />
contribution to public hospitals over the past five years have gone up and the state<br />
contributions have gone down.<br />
JOTJRNAI. IST:<br />
Mlr Kennett suggested the possibility of another meeting next week.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I'm too busy next week, Alan, I'm going to China on Wednesday and I've got one or<br />
two other things on. Fa au21/ 03/ 97 19: 08 Pg: 8 </p>
<p>Fax from JOUJRNALIST:<br />
Mr Howard, on native title, in terms of the discussions ( inaudible) in respect of native<br />
title and Century Zinc, to what extent have Aboriginal people put a view to you that<br />
some of these so called Aboriginal leaders, they're not actually representatives?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Look, I'm trying to get an agreement and I am simply not going to be drawn on that.<br />
It's not helpflul. I'm not into that.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Costello, do you feel that your relations with the premiers and the treasurers have<br />
improved since last year's meeting?<br />
COSTELLO: Actually I thought they were very warm-<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Yes. COSTELLO: In fact, very warm indeed.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Almost mellow.<br />
COSTELLO: In fact, I actually thought it was a very warm conference.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
It was.<br />
COSTELLO: As the Prime Minister said, the agreement which was handed out in relation to the<br />
fiscal grants, the general revenue was maintained and agreed. In relation to specific<br />
purpose payments, they have never been agreed. Can I make this point about specific<br />
purpose payments. These are wheni the Commonwealth decides to run a programme<br />
and makes a specific purpose paym~ ent to the states to run it. Now the Commonwealth<br />
has never in the past come to an agreement about what it will spend or whether it will<br />
get out of one and into another. The Commonwealth has always made those decisions<br />
in the budget context and that has been the position at every Premiers' Conference.<br />
Fa om21/ 03/ 97 19: 08 Pg: 9 </p>
<p>Fax from Last year for the first time ever we gave an indicative figure. We gave another<br />
indicative figure this year but these are not negotiated matters.<br />
JOURNALIST: So the Treasurers were just stunting?<br />
COSTELLO;<br />
No the Treasurers are arguing a case for a status quo position. That is they don't want<br />
any further tightening in relation to..<br />
PRE14E UMNISTER.:<br />
They wanted more money than we were willing to offer. Now there is nothing<br />
particularly revolutionary about that.<br />
COSTELLO: And we have reserved under the Budget the right to vary specific purpose payments.<br />
And all we've said is we've reserved the right to vary them but they won't be varying<br />
particularly much if the ceiling is 1.3%.<br />
PR] NME MIN1STER:<br />
If it's not a negotiated position, why did you leave the room to consider their counter<br />
offer to your 1.3%?<br />
PRIMEAEMSTER: You often go out to have a chat to each other. That happens.<br />
JOURNALIST; If it's not negotiated, why bother?<br />
PRIE MINISTER:<br />
Well we are infinitely courteous people,<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Howard, we've had a confiation that the Australian Defence Force has been put<br />
on an increased state of readiness because of Papua New Guinea. Was that merely on<br />
the possibility of evacuation of Australian nationals or was it also to give assistance to<br />
the civi cairn in Papua New Guinea, Fa om21/ 03/ 97 19: 08 Pg: </p>
<p>Fax from ] PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well it was in response to a routine determination by the head of the Australian<br />
Defence Force, General Baker, and it wasn't specifically in response to, it certainly<br />
wasn't in relation to the latter of the alternatives that you have suggested but it was a<br />
normally prudent, sensible thing and it was a very sort of modest acceleration of the<br />
state of readiness and the sort of thing that you would expect the commander of the<br />
ADF exercising normal commnonsense and prudence to do.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, what contact have you had with your emnissary to PNG?<br />
PRIE MINISTER:<br />
Well he's returning to Australia right now and I hope to be briefed by him in either<br />
Canberra orSydney later this evening and I have had some telephone messages relayed<br />
to me through my office but I will be seeing him as soon as possible to get an extensive<br />
debriefing from himn, and I want on behalf of the Government to thank Mr Flood and<br />
Mr White and Mr Taylor for the job that I think they have done. I think they are three<br />
first class public servants who I believe have done a very good job and I am looking<br />
forward very much to hearing what they've got to tell me.<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you have a preliminary feeling on what's going on over there?<br />
PRIE MINISTER:<br />
Well it's obviously still very unstable but the calming influence being exercised by the<br />
former head of the Defence Force, General Singirok, is to be welcomed. We remain of<br />
course very strongly opposed to the use...<br />
do you have a preliminary feeling on what's going on over there?<br />
PRIE MINISTER:<br />
Well it's obviously still very unstable but the calming influence being exercised by the<br />
former head of the defence force, General Singirok, is to be welcome. We remain, of<br />
course, very strongly opposed to the use of the mercenaries and every indication we<br />
get that the mercenaries have, in some cases, gone or are going is to be welcomed.<br />
And overall the more that that is accelerated the better. We remain willing to discuss<br />
the reasonable alternatives that were put on the table at my meeting with Sir Julius<br />
Chan in Sydney last Sunday week. It's a country that's important to us and the<br />
internal stability of Papua New Guinea is something that we take very seriously. But<br />
we respect the fact that it's a sovereign country and it does have a very difficult<br />
situation in Bougainville. The impression is that things are domestically a little calmer<br />
today than what they were yesterday but I don't want to emphasise that too strongly.<br />
Fa rom21/ 03/ 97 19: 08 Pg: It </p>
<p>Fax from JOURNALIST: Is your information that Sir Julius Chan is now rather more inclined to look at those<br />
reasonable alternatives favourably?<br />
PRIME M241STER:<br />
Well he has certainly changed his position on the mercenaries, there's no doubt about<br />
that. The mercenary contract has been suspended and there's an inquiry and it's been<br />
suspended for at least two weeks. That does represent a very significant change. I<br />
don't want to put it any more strongly than that.<br />
JOURNALIST: on the specific alternative arrangements that you put to him.<br />
PRIMIE MINISTER:<br />
Well, the two were linked when I put it to him and it's obvious that there has been<br />
movement on one. I don't want to presuppose what is in his mind and I don't think<br />
it's sensible of me to try to do so. But I do note there has been movement on one.<br />
JOURNAJJST: ( inaudible).,. expressed concern that money from the Natural Heritage Trust would<br />
only be paid out if the States matched it on a dollar-for-dollar basis. They said they<br />
had no idea this was the case. Is this in fact the case or would you reconsider?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, I did receive some questions from the Premiers about that. I said that I would<br />
investigate what had taken place at the meeting between the Commonwealth and State<br />
Ministers. The preliminary advice I had was that that was not the case, but there may<br />
well have been a misunderstanding. But I'm going to find out some more information<br />
and come back to the Premiers, But we obviously, in providing a lot of extra money<br />
for the environment, we don't want that money as it were to replace State expenditure,<br />
we don't want the States to use the provision of that money as an excuse, a reason, an<br />
opportunity to reduce their own spending. But equally it's meant to be money over<br />
and above what is already being spent by the Commonwealth and the States on the<br />
environment. But I'll look into that and obviously the Commonwealth's policy in that<br />
area will be observed,<br />
Thank you very much. Fa om21/ 03/ 97 19: 08 Pg: 12 </p>
