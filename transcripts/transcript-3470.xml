TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW V<br />
BROADCAST 9.3Oam NOVEMBER 18 ON 4BC<br />
BETWEEN HAYDN SARGENT ( HTS:) AND THE PRIME MINISTER.<br />
( Recorded Friday November<br />
HS: Prime Minister, Mr Hawke said last night that he anticipated<br />
that next year would be the worst year the world and Australia<br />
had experienced since the great depression.<br />
PM: I think he's right. I think the figures for the next<br />
few months are going to be quite bad here and in every comparable<br />
country, western Europe, North America, Japan.<br />
HS: He says that he thinks maybe the western world has got<br />
to rethink its attitudes towards production, distribution of<br />
wealth, do you think that that's the way to solve the problem?<br />
PM: I think the western world has to sort out its priorities<br />
much more, there's no doubt about that. It has tak~ en some things<br />
too much for granted, some things at home,* some things in other<br />
parts of the world upon which it depended, such as the oil-producing<br />
countries, but that will take quite some time to do.<br />
But for the next few months, things will be very disappointing,.<br />
in all economies like ours, all countries'like ours.<br />
HS: You say for the next few months yes so I anticipate<br />
you're seeing some kind of a pick-up somewhere along the line.<br />
PM: Yes, I've said that I think we will have turned the corner<br />
by the middle of next year.<br />
HS: What do you think it will have been that will make us turn<br />
the coi. Ac<br />
PM: I believe the biggest single problem we have in Australia,<br />
and just as the biggest single problem in the other countries<br />
too is the cost inflation now. The fact that incomes are rising<br />
even faster than prices. Now the Australian Governement has come<br />
out with a proposal which ought to break that vicious circle of<br />
wages chasing prices and prices chasing wages. We have proposed'<br />
I hat there should be very considerable decreases in taxes, with<br />
the consequence that the take home pay, the net take home pay<br />
for people in general will be considerably higher. These tax<br />
reduct. ions which I announced on behalf of the government last Tuesday<br />
mean that a man, say on $ 100 taxable income, that is, taking away<br />
the deductions that he has for his dependants and for his medical<br />
expenses and so on, would have the equivalent of an 8% increase<br />
in his income. A man on $ 150 taxable income.. would have an increase<br />
of about 6% in his net income. He would take home as much as'he'd<br />
take home as if his wages had increased by 8% and 6% and this will<br />
mean that we believe that the Arbitration Commission can be<br />
persuaded to say that the increase in prices in this December<br />
quarter will have been compensated for by the reduction in taxes.<br />
The Arbitration Commission will therefore, in our argument, say<br />
there is no need to increase awards for-wage and salary earners<br />
to account for increases which occur in prices in the December quarter.<br />
The increases in prices in the December quarter will have been<br />
compensated for by a drop in taxes. That means, thereafter, from<br />
the March quarter onwards, we are asking the Commission to index<br />
wages so that any increase in prices will automatically. produce<br />
an increase in wages.*-</p>
<p>-2-<br />
HS: Now that's good in theory Prime Minister, but what about<br />
the Trade Unions? Those who have already said, we are not<br />
committing ourselves to co-op'erate.<br />
PM: Well,* you quoted Mr Hawke before. Mr Hawke has commuitted<br />
himself to co-operating. And after all, the arguments before<br />
the Arbitration Commission will be put by the ACTU on behalf of<br />
the unions and Mr Hawke is their president and the argument will<br />
also be put by the Australian Council of Salaried and Professional<br />
Associations, ACSPA, and by the Commonwealth Council of Public<br />
Service Organisations, COPSO. This means that the blue collar,<br />
the white collar, the public service unions, will all be putting<br />
an argument. Its true enough, you know how some of the papers<br />
are, if anything comes out, they make phone calls round for<br />
everybody to make a comment. and they publish the comments which<br />
express reservations. But the people who express those reservations,<br />
won't be making submissions to the Commission. They won't be<br />
giving evidence to the Commission. They will be ~ involved in a<br />
collective submission made by the ACTU and ACSPA and CCPSO.<br />
After all the Commission doesn't make up its mind from what it<br />
reads from a selective group of telephone calls. It makes its<br />
mind up on the basis of arguments put to it.. by employers and<br />
employees and governments.<br />
HS: And yet we've seen a number of trade unions that have<br />
been I think to use Jack Egerton's word, irresponsible.,<br />
PM: Yes we have, in the past, I do believe, irresponsibility.<br />
Thanks largely to leaders like Jack Egerton who are prepared to<br />
give a lead they have moderated these excessive claims very<br />
largely in the last few months. Of course the biggest problem<br />
with unemployment in Australia now, the biggest cause of unemployment<br />
is that people are pricing themselves out of jobs. one man's<br />
increase could mean another man's job and what we're doing<br />
will not only give employees as good an increase in their standard<br />
of living as any increase in wages would have given them,. but<br />
it will not involve a payment by an employer. And this means<br />
employers will be encouraged to keep peopl. e, on their payrolls,<br />
and to put more people on their payrolls.<br />
HS: Talking about a man and his job, why the attack on Mr Crean?<br />
PM: I'm blessed if I know! But its just part of the thing,<br />
the speculation, ana if one doesn't respond immediately to every' form<br />
of speculation, one thinks that where there's smoke there's fire.<br />
There's the absurd position yesterday in the House of Representatives,<br />
Mr Snedden said that I was not only going to twop jobs for Mr * Crean<br />
but for Mr John son.. He brought this allegation on in Parliament'.<br />
in the morning rather early, he cut off question time so as to bring<br />
it up-and then he caught a plane to Brisbane and mentioned three<br />
more names. Well of course you can see what the consequence would<br />
be if I say. yes or no to Crean or yes or no to Johnson. Then<br />
next time there's a question time, he asks me to say yes or no<br />
about the next three he's mentioned, the ones -but the damn<br />
funny thing he didn't mention in Parliament all five,<br />
when three hours before he'd mentioned twreAnd of course behind-, the<br />
scenes he's been planting this idea about a whole lot. Well I don't<br />
respond to these things. I have my responsibilities and I'll exercise<br />
them as I see fit.&amp; I C" </p>
<p>-3-<br />
. HS: Prime Minister a lot of people voted for the Labor Party<br />
on 7 December 1972 and again the 18th May because they believed<br />
the Labor Party had some vigorous, exciting plans. And yet a lot<br />
of people who voted Labor on both those occasions have lost<br />
confidence. Why?<br />
PM: Oh some might have. I also believe however that a great<br />
number have had their confidence confirmed and a lot of others<br />
have decided that we deserve support because we are trying to<br />
carry out what we promised to do. Now we've been very unfortunate<br />
of course because this world-wide movement, almost recession,<br />
has taken place and this makes it very difficult to get on with<br />
all the things which we've promised to do and which we've tried<br />
to do. But there's.. a also a very great deal of obstruction.<br />
There's been obstruction in the Senate quite inexcusable delays<br />
in getting some Bills through. I mean the Trade Practices Bill<br />
should have gone through a year earlier. It would have been of.'<br />
very great benefit to consumers if it had gone through. And<br />
there are many other instances too. And of course, some of the<br />
States have delayed or obstructed, and Queensland, consistently<br />
so, in fact vituperatively so. That is you get the absurd<br />
position that Queensland alone among the States will not co-operate<br />
with some of the things which we promised to try to do and which<br />
the other States are co-operating with us in doing.<br />
HS: I' ve got a press release here from the Premier's Department<br />
and he says and I quote " The Prime Minister was launching into<br />
his usual campaign of stand-over and cries of obstructionism<br />
because somebody stood up to him." Meaning I presume himself..<br />
PM: Wcil of course he would criticise me for what he c~ ijects<br />
to there. The extraordinary thing is however, that not only<br />
the Labor Premiers, but the Liberal Premiers, the three Liberal<br />
Premiers are not objecting to the things to which Mr Bjelke-Petersen<br />
objects. I'll give you a couple of instances. Queensland is the<br />
only State which has not co-operated with us in setting up<br />
a Land Council to acquire and develop and make available at cost,-<br />
land for people who want to build. The Liberal Premiers have all<br />
greed. Again growth centres everybody knows that two Liberal<br />
i.: iers have co-operated with me, Sir Robert Askin and Mr Hamer<br />
in getting ahead with the growth centre in klbury Wodonga. We<br />
sta),!-rl this in January. A973. We wanted to do exactly the same<br />
thing lownsville. But Mr Bjelke-Petersen will not do so.<br />
HS: Does he give a reason?<br />
PM: No he doesn't. As a matter of fact that's one of the<br />
most extraordinary things, thaL he doesn' ' t even answer the letters<br />
very often. I give a couple of instances of this, not only the<br />
letters, you might remember that in September last year there was<br />
a Cori; titutional Convention in Sydney and the Premiers of N. S. W.<br />
and Victoria made a particular suggestion. and I said ' Righto,<br />
I'll take that up, let's discuss it over dinne! r tonight'. So<br />
all the Premiers were asked to have dinner with me in Sydney.<br />
And all of them came, except Mr Bjelke-Petersen. And we agreed,<br />
and Mr Ejelke-Petersen himself agreed, that we should all get<br />
our parliamentary draftsmen to draft an amendment to the Consitituion..<br />
It was to make it more flexible so that there could be references<br />
by the States to the Federal parliament, as qlready happens<br />
but to make it clear that this could be for a certain time or subject. </p>
<p>I-4-<br />
to certain conditions and the reverse process, that the Federal<br />
Pariament could refer matters for a time or on conditions if it<br />
wished to any or all of the states. And then all these were<br />
drafted and I sent the drafts along to all the premiers. And<br />
' Mr Bjelke-Petersen hasn't responded in any way.<br />
iiS: Have the other Premiers?<br />
PM: Yes they have, they have.<br />
PM: I'll give another instance. There was a special Premiers<br />
conference to discuss inflation last August. We all agreed<br />
that our officials should get together and prepare papers for us<br />
on six matters, and-then we could discuss those after we got<br />
the papers and come to some agreement on them. They were things<br />
like the procedures for government tenderings and wage tribunals<br />
and wage fixation, a great number of things concerning inflation,<br />
which did need us all to pursue the same course.<br />
The reports were sentby me, they were good reports by these<br />
officials, federal and state officials, from all the States<br />
as well as the federal and I sent these all' 2 months ago.<br />
And Mr Bjelke-Petersen hasn't yet replied or acknowledged.<br />
Its no use saying I'm out of step with him everybody's out of<br />
step with him, the other five Premiers too, the two Labor ones<br />
the three Liberal ones, but just forget that. Look at the position<br />
that Mr Gorton was in. When we were first elected in December 72<br />
it very quickly emerged that there were 3 quarrels between us and<br />
they were the same ones there were between Mr Bjelke-Peterson and<br />
John Gorton. They were the Barrier Reef, overseas control of our<br />
natural resources, and aboriginal land rights. Exactly the same<br />
thing. Now he's out of step with Gorton, he's out of step with<br />
Askin and Hamer and Court as well as the Labor Premiers. And<br />
then there are several things which concern Queensland alone.<br />
And he has either not answered or he's just stalled.. He's stalled<br />
now for twenty-three months on the proposal that I made, I mean<br />
our predecessors have made it too, but I raised it when we came<br />
in, that the Australian National Line should be allowed to trade<br />
between Queensland ports, which need more ships and the ships<br />
of course have spare cargo space. Now I'll give you 3 or 4 other<br />
instances, last June these came up, I proposed to him that we<br />
should see if we could reduce-electrici
along Queensland's coast, in every provincial city. their electricity<br />
costs around double what they are in the provincial cities in<br />
N. S. W. and Victoria. He hasn't even answeredothe letter. Then<br />
I suggested to him that we should get an environmental impact statement<br />
made on beachsand mining and he hasn't even answered the letter.<br />
And there are a couple of things about aborigines and he hasn't<br />
answered those either. Its rather extraordinary, this is not standovei<br />
I'm not standing over Askin, I'm not standing over Hamer, I'm not<br />
standing over Court. They see advantages. But there must be at<br />
least $ 50 million that would have come to Queensland if they had<br />
accepted offers which have been accepted by other States.<br />
HS: Fair enough point. Mr Bjelke-Petersen of course is fighting<br />
the forthcoming State election on the issue that the people of<br />
Queensland have got to decide between his Government and a Government<br />
which is aligned with the Federal Government. </p>
<p>PM: Yes the people of Queensland have to decide whether.<br />
-they want an obstructionist Government in their State or a<br />
co-operative one.<br />
HS: Fair enough point. You're going overseas -PM:-yes)<br />
Some people wonder about Prime Ministers, Premiers for that matter,<br />
who go overseas when there seem to<br />
PM: Well last year for instance the Premier was away<br />
from Queensland in more days than I was away from Australia.<br />
HS: Touche. Do you see any particular advantage in going<br />
overseas, particularly when Australia's facing this difficult<br />
time.. PM: There are plenty of people whc can pursue the domestic<br />
policies. And of course, I devote the great bulk of my time to<br />
them. But there are many things which can only be determined At<br />
the level of head of government and . face-to-face. After all,<br />
there are great number of heads of government who now come to<br />
Australia: the Prime Minister of Japan, the Shah of Persia<br />
in the last couple of months, and of couse you remember since we've<br />
been in there've been more people visit Australia, heads of government<br />
or heads of state, than in the previous ten years. Now take the<br />
question of Japan, surely nobody should dispute that I should<br />
visit Japan, as I did a year ago, and as a result, of my government's<br />
contacts with Japan the price that Australia including Queensland<br />
has got for. mineral export is three times what it was.<br />
Now Queensland coal is fetching 3 times the price that it was<br />
getti. ng when we came into office 23 months ago. And this was<br />
becak. of-* the Australian Government's initiatives.<br />
Surely .&amp; ody says that I shouldn't see President Foird, or that<br />
I shouldn'lt go to the United Nations, where some things a-lone can<br />
be solved, that I shouldn't have gone to Japan, as the group of<br />
ministers repaying, the visit that Japanese ministers made a year<br />
before. This is an annual thing. Nobody's going to suggest surely<br />
that I shouldn't go to the Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting<br />
These things clearly require my presence and it would be taken amiiss<br />
I believe if I were not to make the visits I mention. And any<br />
other visits I mention have only been over a week two weeks in<br />
S. E. Asia, all the countries there. Well for God's sake, surely<br />
I should visit them. They visit here too. And the other ones I've<br />
made ve been just for 3 or 4 days, over the weekend.<br />
HS: Prira' Minister, you've made reference to the improvement<br />
in the price of coal, getting back to things like attitudes ito<br />
overseas investment and international trade. Why does the Federal<br />
Labor Government Appear to have virtually dhAnged its mind ab * out<br />
say overseas investment in Australia, how much should be investe~ d<br />
how much should be held.<br />
PM: W want to see that we have an Australian control of our<br />
resourcesT Now it doesn't matter so much who owns them but it is<br />
essential that we should exercise control over them. Its not good<br />
enough for big international cdtkpanies to come along and pick off<br />
State governments which don't themselves and the public services<br />
too, one has to confess, don't have sufficient skill to deal with<br />
these things. The big companies with whor. we are dealing are bigger<br />
in their scale of operations-and in-the experts at their disposal,<br />
. than any State government in Australia, inclUding N. S. W And its<br />
6-~ 7 7-* </p>
<p>-6-<br />
only the Federal Government which has the resources and the<br />
-skills and the status to deal in this way. There's been a great<br />
deal of obstruction, take the uranium things, there's been challenges<br />
in the Courts, and there's been obstruction in the Senate there.<br />
For six months they held up regulations and then disallowed them.<br />
Well when that avenue was closed Mr Connor, Dr Cairns and I got<br />
together with the uranium people and we made a contract. And<br />
B as a result of that we will get a very much better deal for<br />
Australia. For instance, the amount of the royalty for the<br />
export of yellowcake you know, the uranium powder, from Australia<br />
when we came in, the amount of the royalty was We've been'<br />
able to get 50%. Forty times as great!+ And in the process<br />
we have been able to secure by co-operation with the main company<br />
concerned; the erection of a processing plant and thi hmeans we'll<br />
be able to co-operate with the people who discovered uaniumn<br />
They'll get a very good return themselves, they know that, and<br />
whilethey used to join in the general criticism ofeus, they now<br />
say that this is an equitable arrangement, and of course it is.'<br />
Now in some other respects we want to be ensured that the environment<br />
isn't harmed and that aboriginal susceptibilities are not<br />
affronted. Now that's delaying some things with some other companies.-<br />
But the one where there was no objection on the basis of overseas+<br />
control or aboriginal rights or environmental hazards, the arrangements<br />
have been made, very sensible arrangements.<br />
HS: Prime Minister a final question there was no doubt<br />
I think in most people's minds, particularly the minds Of observers<br />
that it was Gough Whitlam who led the Labor P r victory in<br />
1972 and again in May. Is Gough Whitlam stil I7tle gaptain of the<br />
ship though, that's the question in the minds of a lot of people.<br />
PM: Well I would think I am, I would have though that nobody<br />
was doubting that this week. But the main thing I want to emphasise<br />
is there is a good crew for the ship as a whole and some excellent<br />
officers. I think that the ship is well-handled and its in good<br />
shape.<br />
HS: Fair enough. Prime Minister thanks very much. </p>
