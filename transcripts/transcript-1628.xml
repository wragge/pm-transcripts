Prime Minister' s Pres-s Conference<br />
BRITAINS " EAST OF SUEZ"' DECISION<br />
( Main points from press briefing by the Frime Minister,<br />
Mr Harold Holt, to H-eads of Bureau in the Parliamentary<br />
Press Gallery, Canberra) -19TH JULY,-1967<br />
PRIME MINISTER: One useful result from all the discussion which has<br />
proceeded on the " East of Suez" question over recent months has been<br />
the development of a closer contact between the other interested countries.<br />
I speak in particular of the United '_ tates, New Zealand, Malaysia and<br />
Singapore. Australia has been in frequent contact with these countries<br />
on various aspects of the matters covered by the United Kingdom defence<br />
paper, and we have, I think, established a basis as a result of these<br />
contacts for even closer co-operation for the future, though 41t is of<br />
course much too early to say in what direction the co-operation would<br />
develop or to discuss it in any detail.<br />
The second thing which I thirk does come out of is that over the<br />
years ahead and we do have a very considerable period of years in<br />
which to carry out our defence planning and our consultations together<br />
there will emerge no doubt some regional defence arrangements. But<br />
who will be party to these, or again, what form they will take remains<br />
to be resolved. But the very fact that a group of countries are associated<br />
in the Vietnam conflict and the fact that others of us have been associated<br />
in maintaining the security and stability of Malaysia and Singapore at<br />
least provides the groundwork of some future co-operation in directions<br />
which may develop arising out of consultations we shall be having together.<br />
The third pont I would like to make about it ; is that it becomes<br />
all the more important to Australia that we should have in office a<br />
government which at least has a consistent foreign policy and an ' ntelligible<br />
foreign policy, and a government capable of working in close co-operation<br />
with allies who see the needs of the area in much the same terms.<br />
Fourthly, these developments will, I hope, bring home to the<br />
great mass of Australians the fact that -we don't live in some sort of a<br />
lotus land, that we are placed by geography in an area of the world where<br />
some of the greatest dangers, and at the same time some of the greatest.<br />
opportunities exist in the world today. We can't afford an attitude that<br />
we can defend and develop this vast continent on the basis of ' 5weeks of<br />
work a year of ' 2hours a week. ' e just have to realise as fellow Australians<br />
we have to put our best efforts forward 4n the years ahead for the security of<br />
the country and for its growing strength and prosperity, and out of that the.<br />
growing contribution that we can make to the security and stability of the area<br />
in which we live.<br />
Q. Sir, reference to your remark about 45weeks of 610 hours, you are<br />
not suggesting that you are going to shorten the holidays and lengthen the<br />
working week?<br />
FM: No, I'm not. I'm just putting that that is the current si tuationthree<br />
weeks' annual leave, ten days of holidays, public holidays, a<br />
week of sick leave is usually taken, and an accumulative week for<br />
long service leave that is the net effect of it. I merely used that as<br />
an illustration 17e have got ourselves, many of us, I think, into the<br />
frame of mind that we can just go on indefinitely, doing less and getting / 2 </p>
<p>2-<br />
PM ( Contd.)<br />
more in a period of our history when we have very important problems of<br />
defence and development ahead of us.<br />
Q. You are not 4mplying, Sir, that there will be an increase i~ n<br />
the working hours?<br />
PM: No, I'm not. Of course I recognise that many Australians work<br />
considerably longer hours, But what I am trying to direct my comment at is<br />
a mental attitude which does exist in some places and which will, I hope,<br />
receive something of a jolt from developments such as these, I'm speaking<br />
in particular, in making this comment of the younger generation of<br />
Australians who -are building their future in a country which, I repeat,<br />
has great opportunities, , but by virtue of its geographical position and<br />
political developments in the region also faces dangers which this country<br />
has probably not been conscious of earlier in its history.<br />
Now, there is one fairly obvious question: Is Australia likely<br />
to build up forces to compensate for the United Kingdom force reductions<br />
In South-East Asia, particularly in the(" Commonwealth Brigade? Australia<br />
has had this long-standing association with the United Kingdom and New<br />
ZLealand in assisting in the defence of the Malaysian area and we wil I<br />
continue in co-operation with these gove-.. nr-i-ts and the Malaysian and<br />
Singap~ re Governments to contribute to the stability of the area.<br />
First, there is the fact that the United Kingdom withdrawals<br />
will be spread over a fairly long period of years, measured in modern terms<br />
in a fairly rapidly changing world, and also the United Kingdom has made the<br />
statement clearly that she will continue to honour her obligations to defend<br />
this area under the present defence agreement and will engage in<br />
consultations as to the best way of meeting those obligations. The fact<br />
that these plans for reductions are spread over a fairly long period of time<br />
indicates the United Kingdom's continuing sense of responsibility for<br />
assisting the security and stability of the area. The precise shape and<br />
size of Australian forces deployed in the area in the years to come will<br />
have to be determined, of course, after the review which will become<br />
necessary of our own defence arrangements, but it will require not only<br />
considerable study by us but consultation with our allies. This applies in<br />
particular to the Commonwealth Brigade which Australia has always rated<br />
as a valuable protective force from the point of view of preserving . a military<br />
presence in the area and for the deterrent effect it provided In that it<br />
indicated the backing to It of the countries concerned.<br />
V/ ill the British decisions mean an increase in our contributions<br />
to aid Malaysia and Singapore to build up their own forces?<br />
Aiustralia has already committed $ 25 million towards the<br />
build-up of forces the Malaysian area, and following the visit of the<br />
Malaysian Minister for Defence, Tun Razak, to Australia several months<br />
ago, the Australian Government announced that it would continue to provide<br />
aid up to 1970. A technical mission was sent to examine needs with the<br />
appropriate representatives of Malays-: a and Singapore and its report is<br />
now being submitted to Ministers.<br />
The question of our further aid is under consideration at<br />
present in relation to Budget matters generally, but it may not be possible<br />
to resolve this in any detail at this time because we will need to consider<br />
the bearing that these developments will have on it. In any event, it may a. 9 / 3 </p>
<p>-3<br />
PM ( Contd.)<br />
appropriately form part of a wider discussion with others later on.<br />
Will the United Kingdom announcement preclude a further<br />
Australian contribution to Vietnam or even necessitate a withdrawal of<br />
Australian forces deployed there?<br />
Australia will maintain its commitment to contribute to the<br />
defence of South Vietnam against communist subversion and aggression in<br />
that country. As I have said on a number of occasions, the Australian<br />
Government maintains a continuing defence review which includes the size,<br />
and shape, of its force contribution to the Vietnam conflict. This review<br />
is made in the light of military developments in the area kind in concert<br />
with our allies. The reduction of the United Kingdom forces over a fairly<br />
long period of years will not require us to change this practice.<br />
Well, another question that might be likely to arise is whether<br />
the Australian defence expenditure is likely to rise rapidly in the next few<br />
years as a result of the planned British force reductions.<br />
Wle have a Budget in preparation right now and I am not discussing<br />
it nor to be taken as discussing it in any sense. But given the long-term<br />
nature of the United Kingdom plans for reducing forces in the area, I<br />
wouldn't expect that any of the adjustments arising out of the British decisions<br />
will have large and immediate financial implications. This is a gradual<br />
phasing out and already, of course, our defence provision is a very<br />
substantial one. I am thinking in terms of a percentage of GNP exceeded by<br />
very few countries in the world the United Kingdom and the United States<br />
perhaps, but it wouldn't be easy to point to others. In the longer term, as<br />
I have stated on previous occasions, Australia will continue to contribute<br />
to the defence of South-East Asia and its own defence needs on a scale which<br />
will be related to our economic growth and the view we take from time to<br />
time of our interests and responsibilities in the area.<br />
Tell, I think those are the main items. There may be others<br />
which are in your mind. just before I go on, I don't think I need to fill<br />
you in on the sort of discussions we had with the United Kingdom Government.<br />
I did that pretty thoroughly, I think, while we were in London those of<br />
you who were there and when I came back here subsequently. You will<br />
know the sort of views we put forward and the reasons for them, but what<br />
I would like to make clear is that they were not only views put by Australia,<br />
but this was the general approach of the other governments I mentioned,<br />
including the United States.<br />
C. Have you had any request from President Johnson yet for more<br />
military aid in Vietnam?<br />
PM: Well, as Secretary McNamara pointed out, this is not the way<br />
business is done between governments who are interested there. There<br />
is a process of consultation and discussion. One government indicates what<br />
it feels necessary to be done. I've not even had a proposal put to me in<br />
any form which you could term a specific request but we recognise, of<br />
course, that whatever any of the of the allied countries are able to contribute<br />
is welcomed by the Government of South Vietnam, and we do from time to<br />
time review the size and nature of our own contribution. I have already<br />
pointed to the very considerable defence provision falling on our Budget and<br />
indicated earlier, without trying to prejudge the outcome of our Budget, that / 4 </p>
<p>-4-<br />
PM ( Contd.<br />
this year's appropriation for defence will, J'n the nature of things, be<br />
larger than that of last year. just how large depends on the view taken of<br />
our Budget responsibilities generally. I would believe that the kind of<br />
continuing review which includes, from time to time, an assessment of<br />
what we can do in Vietnam would need, on the next occasion we come together<br />
for it, to take account of these developments in the Malays ia/ Singapore<br />
area and just what provision we need to make in relation to those.<br />
C. Sir, the tone of that suggests that any additional aidwhich we<br />
might give in Vietnam will be only marginal.<br />
PM: Well, I wouldn't like to have too much significance read into the<br />
tone at this point of time. There have been suggestions which you may<br />
have seen for another meeting of the countries represented at the Manila<br />
Conference, and I can just fill you in on that to this extent.<br />
In the course of the year I have discussed this myself with various<br />
heads of governments in the countries concerned with whom I have been in<br />
contact Mr Holyoake when I visited him, Prime Minister Ky when he wa<br />
out here, the Prime Minister of Korea when I was there, and Presidert<br />
Johnson himself. And all those with whom I have talked about the matter<br />
when it has arisen 4 n discussions between us have favoured another meeting,<br />
but the timing of it we felt called for some consideration in view of the<br />
impending elections South Vietnam. But for that, I think, you would have<br />
seen a conference held In an earlier point of time than this.<br />
Now, for my part, I would prefer some discussion on force levels<br />
to take place In this kind of company because we could all assess what could<br />
usefully be done and what commitments we had in other directions.<br />
Australia, of course, does have to make defence provision in other<br />
directions and this is not always clearly perceived by our allies who look<br />
to what we are doing in South Vietnam and tend to ignore that we are also<br />
making a contribution in the Malays ia/ Singapore area and that we have some<br />
responsibilities in respect of Papua and New Guinea as well as responsibilities<br />
in relation to the Australian mainland. Another factor which is not widely<br />
recognised, it * seems to me in the countries concerned, is that Australia<br />
is the one country in addition to the United States of America which i~ s<br />
providing a three -S'ervice contribution. Australia, of course, is paying<br />
its own way entirely for what it is contributing. If it is a case of doing<br />
more, then I think it would be helpful if we all considered together what<br />
each is contributing, what each is capable of doing.<br />
C. This meeting is likely to be in September, Sir, in South Korea,<br />
is it?<br />
PM: Well, I have heard September and October mentioned. I would,<br />
myself, have thought it would appropriately be held after a Presidential<br />
election, possibly even af ter the assembly elections they have in South<br />
Vietnam. I should have mentioned that the matter was discussed at the<br />
conference in WTashington attended by Mr Hasluck. I think it followed on<br />
the SEATO discussions. It was discussed there and both Korea and Thailand<br />
have apparently indicated their willingness to have a conference held there.<br />
I think it gets pretty cold in Korea abou~ t October. </p>
<p>C. When do you hope the conference will take place from your<br />
point of view?<br />
FM: Well, first, as you will be aware, it is not a conference which<br />
occupies a great deal of time. The whole exercise for me last time took<br />
two days of travel and two days of conference<br />
Q. Talking in terms of October, what month do you think<br />
PM: The Assembly elections are held in November, I am told, but<br />
I think the really important thing is the Presidential election, and no doubt<br />
the appointment of a Prime Minister and a Vice President. They would be in<br />
a position to speak for the country, so I don't think it would be necessary<br />
to await the Assembly elections, but I would have thought it desirable to<br />
await the Presidential election.<br />
C. VWhich is when, Sir?<br />
PM: September 3rd.<br />
Q. VWill the increased costs of defence next year have any impact on<br />
national development?<br />
PM: Well, we can't indicate at this stage what the defence bill will be<br />
You mean the defence bill we are now deciding in our Budget discussions?<br />
Q. Yes. You said it would be larger next year than it was this year.<br />
Will this mean that<br />
PM: Well, our revenues will be larger also. It would be the aim of<br />
the Government to retain sufficient flexibility in its Budget arrangements to<br />
keep the process of development going steadily forward.<br />
C. W~ ill this mean higher taxation?<br />
PM: Not necessarily. You are e sking me to indicate the contents of<br />
the Budget. We have just started our discussions on it.<br />
Q. Mr Holt, do you visualise an early meeting on a Minister,; al<br />
level of the countries concerned with Singapore and Malaysia?<br />
PM: There have been press reports that the Tunku is thinking of<br />
a five-power conference to discuss future arrangements for defence in<br />
the Malaysian region in the light of Britain's planning decisions. However,<br />
no proposal has yet reached me at the governmnental level, and whether a<br />
formal conference is necessary I think is still too early for us to say. My<br />
own Government would first wa nt to study the British decisions closely and<br />
consider, as I have said, how our own arrangements and policy might be<br />
affected and whether any changes are desirable. Clearly there will need<br />
to be consultations among interested governments. Tlbse have been taking<br />
place already as I mentioned and will continue. A proposal for a conference<br />
could arise out of these consultations. Vie should then want to consider<br />
what the conference is intended to do and how other governments feel about<br />
it, but at this stage, the question has not arisen in our own considerations.<br />
It hasn't been discussed as a substantial matter by Cabinet. / 6 </p>
<p>-6<br />
Q. When do you expect to be in a position to tell the Americans<br />
the result of Cabinet's review on the Vietnam commitment?<br />
PM: Well, first of all I have indicated that there has been no<br />
particular proposal put to me from any source, although if the Americans<br />
are reviewing their own force contribution, I imagine that they would<br />
expect that once they have reached their own conclusions that their allies<br />
would have also been giving some thought to theirs, but I would not expect<br />
us to be making any early decision on this matter because, as I have said,<br />
we have first to resolve just what we can provide through the Budget for<br />
defence and, secondly, we have to see the total picture which includes<br />
future developments now notified to us formally in Malays ia/ Singapore.<br />
Q. Mr Holt, how much regard do you attach to the British suggestion<br />
about sharing bases in Australia.? WHill the discussions that have been<br />
going on be stepped up?<br />
PM: I would like to give you a fairly precise comment on that.<br />
Yes, well, the United Kingdom air, land and sea forces already make<br />
some use of our facilities in Australia in exercises, and as you will be<br />
aware, we also have begun a preliminarxy study involving an initial<br />
survey in relation to Cockburn Sound. I did speak in my statement about<br />
feasibility studies and that includes this one. But the question of specific<br />
facilities for use by British forces in the 197C,' s is, as indicated in their<br />
own White Paper, a matter for further examination between our countries.<br />
You will remember that when Denis Healey was here, one of the points<br />
made at the time was that if it became impracticable to remain on In<br />
Malaysia and Singapore, then either they would need to come to bases in<br />
Australia or they would need to go home. We put in hand some studies at<br />
the Service level on various possibilities.<br />
Q. Mr Holt, in view of the rapidly-changing assumptions on which<br />
we based our defence policies, is it likely that Mr Fairhall will be bringing<br />
out a White Paper, giving our estimates and saying where we stand and what<br />
we see the policy alte-;-natives are in the years ahead?<br />
PM: Well, I couldn't comment on that yet. We havent really ha'd the<br />
opportunity to sit round on this. I imagine it will be a fairly early item<br />
of business for us, but we have first to get through what is a major exercise<br />
for us and that is the Budget, including the defence vote in the Budget.<br />
While I have no doubt that at the Service level and in the Departments<br />
concerned there will be immediate activity in reassessment of where we<br />
stand and the implications flowing from all this, we should still have in<br />
mind that this is a programme which runs for over eight years at least<br />
or it is likely to run for at least eight years, it could conceivably be<br />
longer, it could conceivably be less, but at least it is going to run over<br />
some years. That doesn't mean that we can just sit back and take our<br />
time; it doesn't mean that we are faced with decisions that have to be<br />
announced in the next few days. </p>
