F76/ 25<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
FO RS February 9, 1976<br />
NEW PUBLIC SERVICE AND STATUTORY AUTHORITY STAFF CEILINGS<br />
As a result of recommendations made to me by the Public Service Board,<br />
by the Treasury and by my owmn Department, further revised staff ceilings<br />
have been approved for the Public Service and for Statutory Authorities<br />
financed wholly or partly from the budget..<br />
These ceilings have been set taking fully into account the services that<br />
must be supplied to the Australian public.<br />
They represent staff levels which the three departments believe to be<br />
appropriate in the light of decisiops so far taken by the Government for<br />
the efficient and economic performance of the functions of the Commnonwealth.<br />
On 23 December the Treasurer announced immediate measures to restrain<br />
Commonwealth Government spending which indicated the Government's then<br />
intention to hold staff ceilings at the level they had reached at the end<br />
of November last year.<br />
As a result of the searching reappraisal of priorities and programs already<br />
made, the Governmj-ent believes it is now Practicable to reduce staff Ceilings<br />
f ur thle r.<br />
The total of such employment, including employment under the Public Service<br />
Act, to be reached by June 30 will now be 326,558.<br />
This total represents a reduction of 17,480 on the level of employment which<br />
would have been reached under ceilings set by the previous Government for<br />
departments and authorities ( including the Parliamentary Departments) which had<br />
previously been the subject of staff ceilings. / 2 </p>
<p>Employment under the Public Service Act would have increased by 2.8 per<br />
cent during the current financi&amp; l year as a result of a decis-In by the<br />
previous Government.<br />
T istead there will now be a reduction compared with July 1 last year of<br />
3.3 per cent. This will result in approximately 9,800 fewer Public Service<br />
Act staff at June 30 than would have been the case if employment had risen by<br />
2.8 per cent.<br />
The wage and salaxy savings represented by this depends on a number of variables,<br />
such as the rate of incredse that world have occurred, and the rate of<br />
decrease that will now take place.<br />
A precise figure thus cannot be put on the savings, but they would be of the<br />
order of $ 20 million during this financial year and over a full year on current<br />
average pay rates there would be a saving of some $ 80 million dollars, with<br />
significant additional savings on overhead s.<br />
In the case of employment in those statutory authorities for which ceilings<br />
were set by the previous Government there will be approximately 7,680 or<br />
per cent fewer staff at June 30 1976 than would have been the case. The<br />
wage and salary savings in this diverse area is not as readily identifiable<br />
as in the area of employment under the Public Service Act.<br />
I am writing to all Ministerq informing them of the importance placed on<br />
me.' ntaining the revised ceilings in reducing overall Commonwealth expenditure.<br />
Departments and authorities -re expected to reach their revised staff ceilings<br />
by processes of natural wastage such as retirements and resignations.<br />
Ministers and the Public Service Board have been asked to keep me informed as<br />
to any difficulty encotintered in achieving the ceilings by June<br />
The Public Service Board, the Treasury and my own department are being asked<br />
to review further the revised staff ceilings in the light of additional<br />
information coming to hand in the weeks ahead, as the result of the Government's<br />
ongoing review of expend-tture, and to bring forward suggestions of further<br />
reductions in such revised staff ceilings where appropriate. / 3 </p>
<p>The new levels for Public Service Act and statutory authority employment<br />
have been made necessary by the enormous and unreasonable growth of the<br />
public sector ovnr the past three years. As evidence of this, at the<br />
end of December 1972 the Pablic Service totalled 134,465. This was<br />
exclusive of the Postmaster-General's Department which had a staff of<br />
119,709 at the time and of staLatory authorities.<br />
At June 3n 1975 the Public Service had reached 160,177 and would have gone<br />
on to reach 164,650 at June 30 this year if policies which then Lxisted<br />
hadd continued. This is a growth of over 25,7C3 oi: 19 per cent in 2 years<br />
in employment under the Public Service Act alone.<br />
The new level for June 30 1976 will be 154,881 in Public Service Act<br />
employment and 171,677 for statutory authorities outside the Public Service<br />
Act and wholly or partly dependent on the Budget. </p>
