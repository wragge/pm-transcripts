FOR PRESS 5 DECEMBER 1978<br />
PRIME MINISTER PROPOSES JOINT COMMONWEALTH/ STATES<br />
ACTION TRANSITION FROM SCHOOL TO WORK<br />
The Prime Minister, Mr Fraser, has written to the Premiers<br />
proposing joint Conmnonwealth/ States action in education to help<br />
young people in the transition from school to work.<br />
Mr Fraser announced today he had written to the Premiers to<br />
tell them that the Commonwealth Minister for Education,<br />
Senator Carrick, would raise the issue at the special meeting<br />
of the Australian Education Council .( AEC) in Melbourne on<br />
December 8 and 9.<br />
Mr Fraser said he believed all Governments should look to see what<br />
more can be done to alleviate youth unemployment.<br />
Many young people still left school without being adequately<br />
prepared for the world of work, Mr Fraser said.<br />
Longer-term 6hanges to the process of schooling could involve<br />
modification of secondary education and modification of primary<br />
courses to help students achieve greater success at secondary level.<br />
As an example of possible measures, the Prime Minister suggested<br />
alternative courses. at secon'dary level to meet the needs of<br />
students who would leave school early for various reasons.<br />
Similar courses could be established for young people 16 to 18<br />
years old who had already left school. This would be an<br />
experimental development of courses outside the school systems,<br />
possibly through the use of the technical and further education<br />
( TAPE) systems.<br />
Another possibility could be the establishment of intensive<br />
courses during the summer holidays for school-leavers who were<br />
unable to secure employment. These courses could concentrate on<br />
labour market information, careers guidance and vocational<br />
counselling. There was also the need to ensure that more effective cooperation and<br />
coordination was achieved between secondary schools and the TAFE<br />
systems, for instance, through the systematic development of<br />
linked courses. </p>
