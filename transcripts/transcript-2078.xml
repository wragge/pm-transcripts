ANNUAL LIBERAL PARTY RALLY<br />
WA. DIVISION<br />
PERTH, WA. 7 JULY 1969<br />
Speech by the Prime Minister, Mr John Gorton<br />
Mr President, Parliamentary Colleagues and Delegates:<br />
It is an honour for me to technically open this Conference<br />
of West Australian Liberals.<br />
As you say, Sir, I have been here, I think on five I am<br />
told on five I think on six occasions since becoming Prime Minister.<br />
I will certainly be back before the elections and while the elections are<br />
on and, given your assistance, I would expect to be back as Prime<br />
Minister after the elections are over.<br />
After all, this is a really exciting part of a really exciting<br />
nation. Here, Sir, I think you are taking something like ttrnce the<br />
national average of migrants and the population here is growing at<br />
something like twice the national average. Here we have a part of<br />
Australia which is already contributing enormously to our total<br />
mineral exports and which nothing can stop contributing in even<br />
greater measure in the years to come.<br />
You must feel it yourself, the excitement in the air in<br />
Perth; though that is nothing compared with the excitement in the air<br />
in Port Hedland, in Mt Tom Price, and in the other new frontiers of<br />
this developing State. There is an enormous future which has just<br />
begun for Western Australia, and that is not to be regarded as merely<br />
a future for Western Australia but for Australia as a whole.<br />
I wonder what it; is that brings you, as Liberal delegates,<br />
to a meeting of this kind. What is it that you want to see happen in<br />
this country? What is it that you want to see the Members you support<br />
and the Government you put in office do? There will, of course, be<br />
on matters of detail different answers from different individuals, but<br />
there must be some basic overriding consensus of what you wish to<br />
happen in Australia, of what you wish a Government to do for<br />
Australia. Because you don't go out, I am sure, merely to elect a 2/ o </p>
<p>Mr Smith or Mr Jones or Mr Robinson to some particular seat. You<br />
must, and have, a reason for seeking a particular representative of<br />
a particular philosophy. And I want to talk a little tonight of what I<br />
think motivates you people to see that the sort of Government you want<br />
is in office in Australia.<br />
I suppose first of all you want to see a continuation of a<br />
climate which a Government can create a climate which enables Individuals<br />
in Australia to take their risks in a developing coun~ try, to use their<br />
initiati-t~ s, to, take their losses if thuy fail, and star-t again, and to take their<br />
gains if they succeed without being envied by others. Because this is<br />
the sort of climate which permits to individuals the greatest possible<br />
area of freedom to experiment, to build new businesses, to try new<br />
developments. In that climate, and in that climate alone, can a<br />
country quickly and properly and to the benefit of its citizens grow<br />
rich and prosperous and give to its citizens the chance of self<br />
fulfilment. So it is, I think, that climate, as opposed to the idea the<br />
socialist idea that the individual exists to serve the state that you<br />
want to see in the Government you elect in Australia. But you want<br />
to see other things too. You want to see other things done as a result<br />
of that climate being created and these are the ones that I see as<br />
important. And these are the ones I believe you see as important.<br />
Firstly, you must wish to look to the defence and security<br />
of Australia. We are not under any imminent threat of invasion or<br />
attack, nor can I envisage myself in the decade ahead that we would<br />
be under such imminent threat. But history shows that a nation which<br />
does not look to its own defences and its own security even in times of<br />
peace fails to do so at its peril. And the pages of history, and receltt<br />
history, show hations which thought they were safe, and because they<br />
didn't contribute to that safety, found out too late they we:--e noDt cafe at<br />
all. So you would wish us, I think, to regard this as the rock on which<br />
all other development, and indeed our existence, mustC~ pend.<br />
To do this, we must look to our own defences, though the<br />
defences which can be called in to being by a nation of 12 million are<br />
not great. Yet we must look to our own defences and be able to be<br />
seen in the world to be taking a serious and a real approach to our own<br />
security. And we must also look beyond ourselves. We must, as you<br />
know we have done, become involved in the region to our North. This<br />
is the region in which we live, the region in which in the future we must<br />
0 </p>
<p>continue to live; and we must help that region technically, economically,<br />
by opening the avenues of trade and by doing all we can to increase the<br />
standards of living of the peoples in that region. For in that way lies<br />
ukimately the greatest defence. But we must also show our readiness<br />
to participate in the defence of that region against external attack. And<br />
this we have done, and this I believe you would wish us to do.<br />
When I say " participate in the defence of that regioii', I mean,<br />
precisely, participate in it. Up until the present and for a little while to<br />
come, Britain has taken full responsibility for the defence of the region<br />
to our North. She has accepted that responsibility as a major power.<br />
She has looked for assistance to the people in the region themselves, to<br />
those in Malaysia and in Singapore; and she has looked to us and she<br />
has looked to New Zealand, and she has not looked in vain. But we<br />
cannot take over that overriding responsibility and that must be clear to<br />
all.<br />
0 We can join in, and will join in concerted efforts against<br />
external attack, but we cannot take over the full responsibility that<br />
Britain had. And that is the difference between what was, and for a<br />
little while is, but what in the future will not be. I believe you would<br />
wish us to do this. I believe you would see it as sensible. I believe<br />
you would see the stationing of our air force on the peninsula of<br />
M~ alaya and the stationing of our troops in Singapore as visible evidence<br />
of this interest, of this willingness to participate, and as tt. e only real<br />
way in which such visible interest can be shown.<br />
This is one great difference between ourselves and our<br />
opponents, for they would reject what I have just put to you. They<br />
would say we should not do this. Rather would they adopt a jack-inthe-<br />
box policy of shooting some troops up and then bringing them back<br />
.9 and then shooting them up and briaging them back on the premise of<br />
now-you-see-' em-now-you-dork; a proposition which is as psychologically<br />
inept as it is logistically absurd, and which in fact would mean no real<br />
readiness to partic ipate in the defence of the region at all. This is one<br />
great difference and this is one clear-cuLc difference.<br />
But also in this area of defence, we must look to alliances<br />
with major powers. Britain will come to our assistance, I am sure, but<br />
the major assistance I think we must look for now is from the United<br />
States. We have an understanding and an undertaking that that<br />
assistance will come under the ANZUS Pact, but we would not wish as<br />
a Government, and you would not wish, I believe, as an Australian<br />
people that we should expect to get that assistance in time of peril,<br />
without ourselves contributing to Zue. alliance which promises us that<br />
o 4/. </p>
<p>assistance. There is another major difference between ourselves<br />
and our opponents. We are prepared to contribute to a joint defence.<br />
We are prepared to participate in such installations as North-West<br />
Cape, Pine Gap or Woomera because'they are for our joint protection.<br />
But our opponents would not be prepared to do that. They would seek<br />
only to take and not to contribute because there might be perhaps some<br />
small danger in contributing. I do not believe that any alliance which<br />
seeks only to take and not to give will be a lasting alliance or a lasting<br />
security for this country. And in this field, which I have rated so<br />
important, these are the great differences between what I believe and<br />
hope you wish, and what I know our opponents would destroy.<br />
Then, what next? What more? What other things are<br />
uppermost in your mind. I venture to say that development of this<br />
nation, continued and accelerated development, is one of the major<br />
W things you wish to seethappen. Yet because at the moment there is<br />
virtually no unemployment at all in Australia, which means that all<br />
the labour available is e mployed in one field or another, in private<br />
enterprise development or government development but employed<br />
there is no unused labour on which to call for accelerated development.<br />
So there must be a continued effort to bring in more migrants to this<br />
country and to beat the record number of migrants which this year wil 1<br />
see coming to these shores. This is one of the essentials of continued<br />
and accelerated development.<br />
The other, of course, is the provision of capital to enable<br />
labour and capital to work together. Her-w e cannot possibly hope to<br />
generate from within our own savings and within our own community<br />
sufficient capital to develop this country as quickly as it must be<br />
developed. I believe we could not possibly hope to generate from<br />
within our own savings even half as much capital as is required for<br />
our future development. So we : must continue, as we have done, to<br />
look to overseas capital to flow here to enable the strength of this<br />
country to grow and to enable the industrial and material capacity of<br />
this nation to increase.<br />
Yet, at the same time, we would wish as a government,<br />
and I believe that you would wish, that the maximum opportunityfor<br />
Australian participation in this growth and development should be<br />
offered to the Australian people, preferably at the beginning of a<br />
development, but certainly as that development progresses. It is<br />
impossible, of course, and it would be ridiculous to try to say that<br />
there must be a specific proportion of Australian ownership or some<br />
0<br />
goe' </p>
<p>I think that it is cynical in the extreme,<br />
extreme, to talk about abolishing the means test.<br />
$ 150 million more for social services, and that is improper in the<br />
For if there is to<br />
what ultimately the<br />
o. 6/.<br />
4<br />
.4 development can't go ahead. But if it is known abroad that an Australian<br />
Government wishes and expects that an opportunity for Australian<br />
participation will be offered to the Australi; n people then I believe that,<br />
knowing what a government wants and tenZ i-es--onsible, those grvat<br />
companies will do what they are already daiiw and that is offer more<br />
and more~ opportunit5es for iequity pz-rt!, ipation in dc2velop--m-nt. And<br />
this we will seek to bring about.<br />
This is not putting curbs on the flow of capital into Australia.<br />
This, I believe, will not frighten off any capital from Australia. For<br />
given a politically stable country such as we are, and given the opportunity<br />
of full profits from an investment of capital, then I believe that capital<br />
will come here and will not be deterred by the request that an offer should<br />
be made of some participation in that development. And it is important<br />
that this should happen because in fifty years, developments which now<br />
begin will, as this country grows, grow with it, and the assets and the<br />
value and the worth of these developments will, in fifty years' time, be<br />
immensely greater than they are now. And there should be a chance for<br />
Australians to own and participate in some of that growth in their own<br />
country. So I believe that you would wish to see, and we will do our best<br />
to see this happens an increasing flow of labour, an increasing flow of<br />
capital, an increasing chance of Australian participation in that material<br />
development of which I have spoken to you.<br />
What else should a community require? What else do Liberal<br />
supporters seek from their Government? To my mind, having spoken of<br />
material things, one of the requirements you wouid wish a requiremnnnt<br />
essential if a nation is to be truly great is proper care of the aged, the<br />
widowed, the children of widows, the ill and the handicapped amongst us.<br />
That will require, an d has indeed called forth, careful analysis of our<br />
social services system as it at present exists, in an endeavour to<br />
isolate the areas of greatest need and give more assistance to those areas,<br />
And, at the same time we must deal with a problem which is wih us now<br />
and which in the future will grow, and that is the problem posed by those<br />
who during their lives have themselves saved in one way or another, such<br />
as contributing to superannuation, or in some other way. Some of these<br />
people now find themselves little better off, possibly even, when one takes<br />
into consideration their ineligibility for pensioners' fringe benefits,<br />
possibly even worse off than those who have not contributed during their<br />
lifetime.<br />
WI-6 </p>
<p>0z the abolition of the means test would cost $ 150 million more a year<br />
then that amount would go into this one proposition without one single<br />
cent flowing to ameliorate the lot of those who are really in need. But<br />
having said that, it still remains true that if saving is not to be<br />
discouraged, and it must not be, then we must see that those who do<br />
save andhave saved get some advantage from that saving and do not find<br />
themselves in a disadvantageous position as against those who have not.<br />
This kind of compassion, this kind of thought-out approach as opposed<br />
to the past practices of merely raising pensions all across the board<br />
is something that I think you would wish to see happen in this country<br />
and something we are determined to see happen.<br />
On the other fronts, on th e other problems which face us,<br />
there are many difficult choices of priority. Of course, throughout<br />
this nation we want better hospitals, more hospitals, cheaper hospitals<br />
and a health scheme which works better than the existing one. Not that<br />
that scheme is as bad as is sometimes painted, for 77 per cent of<br />
the Australian people are covered by health insurance, another 12 per<br />
cent are covered by repatriation or old-age benefits or in similar ways,<br />
but not enough citizens are covered sufficiently to meet the calls of<br />
illness, particularly prolonged illness.<br />
Then there is the need for more technical schools, since if<br />
the nation we have in our mind is to grow as we hope it will, then it<br />
will only grow by the proper application of modern technology. This<br />
can only be done by properly trained technicians and technologists, the<br />
demand for which is immense and will grow in geometric proportions<br />
in the years ahead.<br />
There is a demand for more education. I speak not now of<br />
technical education but of general education. A requirement for better<br />
communications, a call for more to be spent on roads, a multitude of<br />
requirements and nobody can meet them all, quickly. Should anybody<br />
come before you, as I suspect somebody night, and say " I will overcome<br />
the problems of health; I will overcome the problems of education; I<br />
will build a new naval base in Western Australia; I will build new<br />
railways everywhere; I will provide powerhouses there; I will provide<br />
you name it and I will promise it", then he would not be able to deliver<br />
on that promise, and all men of sense must know this. We would not<br />
adopt that attitude. We would select what we would consider the highest<br />
priorities for the national good, provide finance sufficient to see that<br />
all our manpower and all our materials and all our resources were put<br />
to use, and would necessarily if we are to avoid inflation and the<br />
raising of taxes have to do this over a period of time. But we would<br />
wish to put before you our goals and the steps by which we hope to approach<br />
and hope to solve them. And perhaps when you think of it, that is another </p>
<p>difference between ourselves and our opponents. For I think that<br />
is a more honest approach, I think it is a genuine approach, whereas<br />
I think those who promise all things to all men at once, must be seen<br />
to be lacking in credibility.<br />
Sir, in endeavouring to do what the people in this room<br />
would want us to do, I am sure that from time to time we will make<br />
some mistakes, forno man and no woman and no government can avoid<br />
mistakes. If we do, they will be mistakes which have been made<br />
honestly after examination of all the facts, and when they are realised,<br />
they will be admitted and the course of action changed. I do not think<br />
there will be many such mistakes. I think that I can only make this<br />
one promise that the team we have in Canberra, strengthened as it<br />
is by the members who come to us from West Australia, will dotheir<br />
utmost to carry out what I feel you have in your own minds as objectives<br />
for the future of this, our nation. And we will try to do two things which<br />
are not finite. We will try to encourage and increase a feeling of pride<br />
in being Australians, even if that overrides pride in being Victorians<br />
or West Australians. So that wherever in this nation a man may live<br />
Queensland, New South Wales or Victoria he will be proud and<br />
pleased and happy at the development going on in other parts of the<br />
country. And we will try to do something else if we canA. We will try<br />
to foster amongst the Australian people a flietnf of unity of purpose.<br />
I don't mean the acceptance of uniform ideas but I do mean the acceptance<br />
of the concept which I am sure is true, that there is no longer room in<br />
our nation for the idea, for example, that employees are automatically<br />
opposed to employers and that their interests are different. Rather,<br />
looked at properly, must they be the same for a manufacturer must<br />
wish to see as much purchasing power as possible among the people,<br />
most of whom are employees, and an employee must wish to see as<br />
much efficiency as possible, because in that way the goods he and his<br />
friends buy are cheaper. So there is no longer room for a concept of<br />
employees on one si de and -mployers on the other, no longer room for<br />
a concept of owners of industrial factories having interests diametrically<br />
opposed to those who are or, the land. Rather there needs to be a feeling<br />
that what happens, happens for all Australians, for the good of all<br />
Australians and there is no divisive requirement because a man is an<br />
employee or employer or works in the city or works in the country.<br />
This is another thing, I believe, that is required of a great nation.<br />
Given the continuation of the climate I have spoken of, given<br />
an attempt to approach these non-definable things I have spoken of,<br />
given the approach to defence and social services and the other calls<br />
8/. </p>
<p>8.*<br />
upon us which I have mentioned, then I think we have, through you, a<br />
better chance of turning this country into the one I think we all imagine<br />
in our hearts it can be, a better chance than any other group or any other<br />
organisations existing in Australia today, or likely to exist in Australia<br />
in the future. We will, given your continued support, make our efforts join<br />
with yours to realise the promise of this sunburnt country and pass this<br />
promise on to our children and our children's children. This, I think,<br />
is why you leave your homes to hand out" how to vote" cards, why you<br />
work, what you want to see happen, and if it is, then we will try our<br />
utmost to be worthy of your confidence. </p>
