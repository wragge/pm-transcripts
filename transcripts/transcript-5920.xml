EMBARGO: 5.00P14<br />
PREE MONISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA SUN4DAY SEPTEMBER 26 1982<br />
ELECTORATE TALK<br />
The Government is determined to get rid of the cancer of<br />
tax evasion, and blatant artificial and contrived tax<br />
avoidance schemes.<br />
Already the Treasurer, John Howard-, has done more to<br />
eliminate tax avoidance and evasion schemes than any<br />
Treasurer in the history of the Commonwealth. Some of<br />
the rewards that honest tax payers are reaping fromr the<br />
Government's unremitting campaign against tax evasion<br />
are particularly evident in this year's budget. For the<br />
first time in many years, the Commissioner of Taxation<br />
has said that it will not be necessary to make allowance<br />
in income tax revenue estimates in the budget for revenue<br />
lost through tax evasion. Indeed, hundreds of millions of<br />
dollars of extra revenue will be collected this year from<br />
measures taken against avoidance and evasion.<br />
Taking out that extra revenue to be collected from tax<br />
dodgers there is actually a fall in real terms in tax<br />
collection-.. Clearly, the measures we have introduced<br />
are having an impact on tax levels faced by honest tax<br />
payers, and there can be no doubt that the measures have<br />
contributed significantly to the Goverpment's ability to<br />
give the tax cuts which will start from November 1..<br />
One of the measures that we are introducing is designed<br />
to allow the Government to recoup tax lost as a result of<br />
the so-called bottom-of-the-harbour schemes. These schemes<br />
were particularly unpleasant, and particularly fraudulent.<br />
They always involved some people in some parts ofL the<br />
transactions acting-illegally. Let me give an examjple of<br />
how a bottom-of-the-harbour operation worked, an exampl~ e<br />
drawn in its broad outline from the McCabe Lafranchi Report:<br />
A company has made a current year trading profit of about<br />
$ 750,000 on which company income tax should eventually<br />
be paid.. Including that current year profit, it has a total<br />
" fcashed-up" value of about $ 1.1 million. That is, when all<br />
its assets are sold, and the proceeds put into the company's<br />
bank account, there is the amount of about $ 1.1 million in<br />
that account.<br />
The company is then sold for about $ 1 million and that<br />
$ 1 million is then divided between the company's original<br />
shareholders. The other $ 100,000 then goes to the promoter<br />
or to the person who did the deal. The $ 1 million represented<br />
capital to the original shareholders. / 2 </p>
<p>2-<br />
We'need to remember that in the particular example there<br />
was about $ 750,000 which was current year profit on which<br />
taxes should have been paid but o ' n which no taxes had been<br />
paid. No allowance was made for meeting the tax either by<br />
the original shareholders or by the purchasers and that is<br />
where the fraud came into the scheme.<br />
You can see that there was a lot of money involved. It was a<br />
fraudulent way of avoiding paying company tax. At some point the<br />
scheme had to involve fraud. At some point the scheme had<br />
to be illegal. These became known as bottom-of-the-harbour<br />
schemes because in some cases the documents were literally<br />
dumped into the harbour.<br />
I think you can see how unfair all that is, how unreasonable<br />
that is. Why should people be able to profit by that kind<br />
of device? Why should the Government and honest tax payers<br />
put up with losing the tax that ought to have been paid<br />
which in the example that I have given could have been<br />
over $ 340,000?<br />
The practice was stopped by a special Act of Parliament<br />
in 1980 and that legislation provides for very severe<br />
criminal penalties of up to five years in gaol. Schemes<br />
of this kind corrode the whole basis of Australian society.<br />
There are some who say that they went into such schemes<br />
innocently, not knowing that something was wrong. But the<br />
essence of these schemes is that the price paid to the<br />
shareholders was * too high because no allowance was made<br />
for paying tax. Some people involved in this practice went<br />
back to the trough time and time again. The Government made<br />
up its maind that it was going to collect the tax that should<br />
have been paid, and we are going to collect that tax fro~ m<br />
the pepewopoied from the device. That is, from the<br />
shareholders who sold the company and from others who<br />
benefited from the deal. I would think that most'Australians<br />
would agree that that was fair enough.<br />
There is an element of retrospectivity in the legislation<br />
that John Howard introduced last Thursday and 1 know there<br />
are many people who intensely dislike any idea of retrospectiVity.<br />
As a broad principle, I and all members of the Government would<br />
support that view. It is an important principle. But it is<br />
not the only principle by which we must govern. There is, above<br />
all, the principle of fairness. The Government represents<br />
all Australians. Its duty is to govern fairly for all<br />
Australians. At elections, people divide up their vote<br />
between political parties. But it is the duty of governments<br />
and of members of Parliament to represent all Australians.<br />
That deepl. y held conviction is the very foundation of the<br />
Liberal Party. It is clear that the Government had to make<br />
a difficult choice between supporting absolutely the principle<br />
of no restrospective legislation or maintaining its support<br />
for the principle of governing fairly for-all Australians. / 3 </p>
<p>3<br />
In this instance, in relation to the bottom-of-the-harbour<br />
schemes, we made the decision that we must place the principle<br />
of fairness above the principle of retrospectivity. I hope<br />
that the legislation will be given a thoughtful but<br />
nevertheless speedy passage through Parliaanent so we<br />
can get on with the business of collecting taxes that<br />
should have been paid.<br />
There is no doubt that the legislation will be passed.<br />
My Government will not stand by and see average Australians<br />
ripped off by a very few mean and greedy individuals who<br />
have been very unAustralian in their attitudes and practices.<br />
There is one final point I want to make, and that concerns<br />
Mr Hayden's cowardly and vicious attack on Mr John Reid,<br />
following his appointment as Chairman of the Review of<br />
Commonwealth Administration. The Cornunissioner of Taxation<br />
has given Mr Reid a clean bill of health, and that fact has<br />
now been widely publicised. Mr Hayden began a smear campaign<br />
against Mr Reid without any attempt to have his implied<br />
allegations checked. The record has been set straight,<br />
but Mr Hayden seems determined not to accept the facts.<br />
He seems determined to continue the smear. He can gain<br />
no credit from that. </p>
