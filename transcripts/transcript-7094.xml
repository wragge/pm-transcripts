PRIME MINISTER<br />
TrRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW WITH REGIS FAUCON.. TELEVISION FRANCE CHANNEL<br />
OQNE, ._ 31 January 1967-.__-<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
FAUCON: How bad are the relations now between France and Australia?<br />
PM: You would really have to address that question t~ o Monsieur<br />
Chirac. As far as I am concerned we have done nothing to strain<br />
the relations. My attitude and the attitude of the government<br />
and the people of Australia towards the people of<br />
France is one of very considerable admiration in so many ways.<br />
We share a great deal. We have fought together in two wars the<br />
blood of thousands of Australians is in the soil of France. WE<br />
have the same commitment to the concepts of free parliamentary<br />
democracy, liberty for the individual. WE have a great admiration<br />
for the cultural heritage of France and the great contribution<br />
it has made to the world.--And so--the--things that unite us are<br />
infinitely stronger than those on which we have differences. There<br />
seems to be some inability on the part of this government of France<br />
to understand that two countries can have great respect for one<br />
another, share so many things, but-. in a mature relationship can<br />
differ on particular points of policy.<br />
FAUCON: From your point of view what is the most disturbing problemr.<br />
Is it the nuclear test, the French nuclear or New Caledonia?<br />
PM: We have concern about both. ON the question of testing at<br />
Muroroa we and our fellow nations in the South Pacific have taken<br />
the view that we don't argue with France's right to make a decision<br />
according to its perceptions of its own interests, that it needs<br />
to have an independent nuclear force. That is a decision for France<br />
to make. But if they are going to conduct nuclear testing in support<br />
of that policy and they say it is safe and they assert that it<br />
is then let them conduct the testing in metropolitan France.<br />
It follows as a matter of logic that if it is safe, do it there.<br />
On the question of New Caledonia.. We do have very consideragle<br />
concerns there. WE understand that this is a ' difficult problem<br />
because the Kanaks are in a minority and as. President Mitterand<br />
said to me when I was talking with him in 1983. he said you must<br />
understand that New Caledonia is not Zimbabwe. There it is easy<br />
to transfer power, it is not easy in New Caledonia.<br />
FAUCON: And it is not Algeria.<br />
PM: And it is riot Algeria, correct. I am just using the anal ogy<br />
that tie used. What we were hoping to see and what we thought we<br />
saw in the Mitterand/ Fabius plan was a process whereby there could </p>
<p>PM cont: a gradual constitutional development which would recognise<br />
both the rights of the Kanaks and of the non-Kanaks. And let me<br />
emphasise that we recognise the rights and the interests of the<br />
non-Kanaks as well as the Kanaks. We saw that being able to develop<br />
in a way which coul~ d lead to a constitutional development which<br />
could emcompass an independence in association with France. The<br />
problem we see now is that the Kanaks are going to repudiate the<br />
processes of the present government. They are not going to associate<br />
themselves with the referendum. In that situation, it seems to<br />
us and to our friends in the South Pacific that the likelihood<br />
in those circumstances that the tendencies within the FLNKS whichsee.<br />
mer it in some association wi th Libya -and. that -sortof association<br />
will be strengthened. So we are very concerned about those potential<br />
devel] opments.<br />
FAUCON: Is there a better way than a referendum to get the advice<br />
~ of the population since it is on a one man, one-vote system.<br />
PM: I suppose the answer to that is that the previous government<br />
thought ther-e was a better way of handling the process than Australia<br />
and Australia and the other South Pacific nations saw more merit<br />
in the previous French approach.<br />
FAUCON: You know what the French say, if I may use this expression,<br />
that it is not your business and you make things worse. What do<br />
-you say to that?<br />
PM: If we are going to conduct international relations on the<br />
basis that it is theibusiness of no -othyer country-in terms of what<br />
one country does, I suppose it follows from that that what the<br />
Soviet Union does in Afghanistan -is nobody else's business. I<br />
don't accept that. I think that what happens in other areas is<br />
often the business of others. Let-me make this point. We can<br />
say in respect of ourselves that we are not asking of France a<br />
process that we didn't apply to ourselve. When it came to our<br />
de-colonisation process with Papua New Guinea, Nauru, Cocos Island,<br />
we deliberately invoked the committee of 24. We saw merit in being<br />
assisted in our processes of getting a lasting and peaceable<br />
resolution of that decolonisation by involving others. So we are<br />
not suggesting nor are the South Pacific nations suggesting something<br />
which, as far as we were concerned, we weren't prepared to do<br />
oursevles. FAUCON: If the referendum says no to independence, what are you<br />
going to do. H-ow far are you ready to go yourself?<br />
PM: I wonder whether I could turn the question around to you and<br />
say what are you going to do if the whole of the Kanaks boycott<br />
the referendum as they say are going to and they turn to other<br />
measures, what are you going to do.<br />
FAUCON: Did you find a change of attitude when there was new majority<br />
elected in France last year?<br />
PM: I think I am a reasonably intelligent bloke that is Australian<br />
for person, male person anyway I would have to-go on the evidence<br />
that since there has been the change of government there have been<br />
decisions taken by this French Government that weren't taken by<br />
the previous one. Let me be precise. There has been now the banning<br />
8y g~ jpn86nRjM~ nigterial interchanges. There has been the rejection<br />
n', </p>
<p>FAUCO4: Hlow did you react to that?<br />
PM: In addition to that there has been the colourful language<br />
by your French Prime Minister about my lack of intelligence. I<br />
always thought that the French were elegant, mature, sophisticated<br />
in the handling of their affairs. I would simply say that I wouldn't<br />
regard those actions as consistent with elegance and maturity.<br />
And we-won't be reciprocating.<br />
FAUCON: So how do you react when the French say that you are in<br />
a bad position since you didn't do too well with the aboriginals?<br />
-PM: I would say iti itia loyrav yut aalogy?<br />
We had a colonial relationship with Papua New Guinea. WE didn't<br />
seek to impose an outcome. The characteristics of the de-colonisation<br />
process in which AustrAlia was involved was one of consistent.<br />
patient negotiation and discussion-with-the representatives of<br />
Papua New Guinea including as I say invoking the assistance of<br />
the relevant United Nations agencies. WE thought that we could<br />
be helped by others. And we were. I don't accept the analogy.<br />
If you want to ask me a question about the aborigines. in a relevant<br />
sense I am more than happy to answer.<br />
FAUCON: Personally I know the problem very well.<br />
PM: You accept-that -it-is-not a relevant-. analogy. If--you Want<br />
an analogy-<br />
FAUCON: I am not working for the Chirac Government.-<br />
PM: I am not suggesting that your are.<br />
FAUCON: You are saying that Chirac is anti-Australian<br />
PM: I am not saying that he is. I don'Ik make assertions where<br />
I don't know the facts. All I can say in respect of the facts<br />
that I do know is that he has done things which don't seem to be<br />
consistent with a very cordial relationship towards us.<br />
FAUCON: You disagree, but at least you should talk.<br />
PM: Yes, of course. That is my view domestic, political and<br />
economic affairs and it is my attitude in regard to the relations<br />
between nations. It is much better to talk than impose bans.<br />
If you can.<br />
FAUCON: France says that the truth is that Austrafria wants to<br />
get rid of any French influence in<br />
PM: It is a nonsense and a palpable nonsense'. And I don't know<br />
why people come to stupid conclusions without evidence suggested<br />
that we want to take the place of France. Let me say to you and<br />
if I may. Indirectly through you, to Monsieur Chirac. I and my<br />
Government have our hands completely full in conducting the affairs<br />
of Australia and in handling, within our limit of economic resources<br />
the amount of aid that we were able to make available to the countries<br />
inthe region. We have-neither ambition nor capacity to take the<br />
place of France in the region. And I must say that any view that<br />
we want to do that Is both a misapprehension and if I may say so<br />
borders on the paranoia. I I </p>
<p>4.<br />
FAUCON: Ylou are in Europe and you arc not going to visit France.<br />
And if you are invited tomorrow by Chirac to visit him what would<br />
you do?<br />
PM: I would say the invitation was a bit late.<br />
FAUCON: Next time?<br />
PM: Tomorrow I am with President Mubarak and I am not going to<br />
offend President Mubarak by saying " President I am whipping over<br />
to Paris".<br />
FAUCON: Are you ready to see Chirac?<br />
PM: I would always meet with Prime Minister Chirac.<br />
Let me say I am not prejudging the future.<br />
FAUCON: How do you see the future? Do you think it can-go sofar<br />
as break up the diplomatic relations?<br />
PM: NOt on our part. I would hope that in the light of the things<br />
that I have said that the French Government would understand that<br />
it is non productive to conduct affairs in this way. I simply<br />
don't believe it is appropriate to insult the intelligence of leaders<br />
of other countries. That is not the way Australia-<br />
FAUCON: Do you feel insulted?-<br />
PM: I think I have seen an inaccurate statement when the Prime<br />
Minister of France describes me-as--stupid. I don't feel -terribly<br />
insulted. I just feel I am the object of inaccuracy.<br />
I don't think it is a very elegant, mature, sophisticated way of<br />
conducting relations, any more than I think it is elegant, mature<br />
or sophisticated to demand the withdrawal of the consul on false<br />
grounds the suggestion that they weren't aware of what the consul<br />
was doing when in fact there is written ev-idence of transmission<br />
by the consul to the French authorities of what he was doing.<br />
And in return, written correspondence indicating the acceptance<br />
of that. So this is not the way for intelligent, mature people<br />
to conduct themselves. I hope that they won't go any further.<br />
France will not be finding any reciprocal sort of attitude from<br />
US. FAJJCON: Yes but it is really a dead end street. What can happen<br />
now? PM: It is not really a dead end street. WE are still trading.<br />
Last year we had $ 670 million imports from France, we export $ 710<br />
million worth of Australian goods to France. I think that will<br />
go on. I think Australians will travel to France. I hope French<br />
people will travel to Australia. There is no'better country in<br />
the world for them to travel to. So we hope those things will<br />
go on. And this, if I can describe it as this, hopefully passing<br />
paranoia will disappear and we can have the maturity from France<br />
that we have come to expect from them.<br />
FAUCON: You tend to make a difference between the French and Mr<br />
-Chirac, Your problem is with Mr Chirac?<br />
PM: I haven't got a problem. Do I look as though I have got a<br />
problem. I don't feel problem-ridden in regard to </p>
<p>FAUCON: With Australia, the problem is Mr Chirac?<br />
PM: Again, I wouldn't want to exaggerate a sense of Australian<br />
problems with Mr Chirac. It seems to me that Mr Chirac has a problem<br />
either with me or with Australia. I have tried to explain that<br />
his problems are ill-founded. And there will be nothing that we<br />
will be doing which would be seeking to exacerbate those problems.<br />
I say this to Mr Chirac. as I said at the beginning of this interview,<br />
I, the Government and the people of Australia have enormous admiration<br />
for the people of France, for France. WE have certain differences<br />
of opinion and intelligent, mature people, certainly where those<br />
two people share so much in common, ought to be able to handle<br />
__ differences of opinion in a more mature way.<br />
FAUCON: On the economic side, arenr'tou afrfaid-that Ftrnce~'-hAV<br />
influence the Common Market with more on your agricultural<br />
exports? PM: I don't think they would be silly enough to try and do that<br />
, on the one hand. Nor do I'think the rest of the community would<br />
be unintelligent enough to' respond to those pressures if they were<br />
to be applied.<br />
FAUCON: Will you send somebody to the OECD meeting in Paris, I<br />
think it is in May?<br />
PM: WE have always done it in the past, why would we not do it<br />
now. ENDS<br />
