4j.. AUSTRALIA<br />
FOR PRESS 19 FEBRUARY 1978<br />
OFFICE. OF NATIONAL. ASSESSMENTS<br />
The Prime Minister,, Mr Malcolm Fraser, announced today the the<br />
Office of National Assessments would begin operations on<br />
February.<br />
The decision to create the Office of National Assessments<br />
( ONA) was announced by Mr Fraser on 5 May last year, and<br />
legislation. to establish the Office was assented to on<br />
19 October ( Act No. 107 of 1977).<br />
Mr Fraser said that the Director-GeneridL of ONA, Mr R. W. Furlonger,<br />
had taken up duty in August and had been engaged since in<br />
recruiting staff and in making other administrative preparations<br />
for ONA to begin operations.<br />
The Prime Minister said that the decision to establish the<br />
Office of National Assessments had been very well received by<br />
those sections of the community concerned with analysing the ways<br />
in which present and future changes in Australia's external<br />
environment could affect our national security and welfare.<br />
Mr Furlonger had reported that he had been able to attract high<br />
calibre staff from a variety of authorities and intellectual<br />
disciplines, and the Government looked forward to the progressive<br />
improvement of the quality and range of assessments available<br />
to it as ONA established itself.<br />
ONA will not itself collect intelligence by clandestine or<br />
other means, nor will it concern itself with domestic situations.<br />
It will, however, analyse intelligence and other information on<br />
international, political, strategic and economic issues<br />
of national importance to Australia. It will coordinate<br />
and reconcile the assessments of the various Commonwealth authorities<br />
on external issues, which often affect the interests of more than<br />
one Department or authority. In cases where unanimity cannot<br />
be reached, the Government expects ONA to make the best assessment<br />
it can, but also to indicate what the major dissenting judgement<br />
or judgements are.<br />
Mr Fraser said that ONA would not be a large body, and that it would<br />
have a professional staffof about 35,. consisting of officers<br />
permanently appointed to ONA as well as specialists seconded from<br />
other Departments and authorities, such as Foreign Affairs, JIO,<br />
National Development, the. Reserve Bank, Trade and Resources and<br />
Treasury. ONA would avoid duplicating existing resources and data,<br />
but would involve other authorities in its work, and base its<br />
assessments on information available either inside or outside the<br />
Government. </p>
<p>2.<br />
The Government attached great importance to the close<br />
involvement of the economic Departments in the work of ONA.<br />
The Royal Commissioner on Intelligence and Security,<br />
Mr Justice Hope, had emphasised that, while politico-strategic<br />
assessments would have continuing importance, Australia, as<br />
similarly placed countries were doing, needed to do much more to<br />
develop its assessment capability in the economic and resources<br />
fields. It was clear that developments inthese fields<br />
would be of increasing significance fbr Australia's national<br />
development and security.<br />
The establishment of ONA represents a major step forward in<br />
implementing the recommendations of Mr Justice Hope. Mr Fraser<br />
said that he had'on 25 October announced Government decisions<br />
on other recommendations made by the Royal Commissioner, and<br />
these were also now being put into effect. </p>
