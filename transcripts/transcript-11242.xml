    <content><![CDATA[<p>I warmly welcome Mrs Shipley's announcement today that she has</p>
<p> approved the design for a New Zealand Memorial to be built</p>
<p> at the intersection of ANZAC Parade and Constitution Avenue in Canberra.</p>
<p> A gift from New Zealand to Australia, the memorial will honour the</p>
<p> strong bonds between our two countries, forged first and most famously</p>
<p> at Gallipoli and renewed on many occasions since.</p>
<p>The memorial will stand on either side of ANZAC Parade and represent</p>
<p> in bronze the handles of a traditional Maori kete basket. The memorial</p>
<p> will be a solemn tribute to the important place that the original</p>
<p> ANZACs have in the history of both countries.</p>
<p>It will symbolise the shared sacrifices both nations have made in</p>
<p> defence of the common principles and values their people hold dear.</p>
<p> It will also be a constant reminder of the continuing commitment by</p>
<p> us both to those values.</p>
