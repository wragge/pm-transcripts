STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
( THE RT. HON. R. G. MENZIES)<br />
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES<br />
TUESDAY, 11th APRIL, 1961<br />
OVERSEAS VISIT 1961<br />
What I am about to say will cover some of the more important matters<br />
with which I was concerned da~ ring my recent overseas journey.<br />
On my way to London I had the advantage of meeting both President<br />
Kennedy and the new Secretary of State, Mr. Dean Rusk, in Washington. Our<br />
conversations were quite extensive, but of course private. But it is, I<br />
think~ proper to say that the new President has a most alert interest in<br />
Australia and its problems. In particular, we discussed the problems of<br />
S. E. A. T. O. and LAOS, and the relations between the democratic world and the<br />
Communist powers. I told him about our policies and activities in Papua<br />
and New Guinea and about the position of West New Guinea. I naturally<br />
seized the opportunity thus presented of making a comprehensive series of<br />
remarks along lines which are familiar to members of this House.<br />
I hope it will not be thought an impertinence if I say that nobody can<br />
fail to be impressed by the liveliness of mind, vigour of approach, energy and<br />
desire for results, and forceful personality of the new President.<br />
The atmosphere of our meeting was warm, friendly, and helpful.<br />
My clear belief is that Mr. Kennedy will not rush to conclusions, that<br />
he will be at pains to ascertain the facts, and that when he decides the<br />
decision will be his. I subsequently saw a good deal of Mr. Rusk in Bangkok,<br />
where, with our other colleagues, we worked in close consultation with most<br />
fruitful results. In my opinion, Australia can regard the new Secretary<br />
of State as a very able thinker and negotiator, and as a good friend to us.<br />
I thein proceeded to the Prime Ministers' Conference in London.<br />
All of the Prime Ministers who attended that Conference have now returned to<br />
their home lands, and most, if not all of them, have given their account of<br />
what went on. The Prime Minister of New Zealand and I are later, for we<br />
both attended the S. E. A. T. O. meeting in Bangkok. It is now my right, and,<br />
more importantly, my duty, to make my report in the Australian Parliament,<br />
on its first sitting day after my return. </p>
<p>2.<br />
What I have to say will fall into three parts. I will first say<br />
something about the disarmament sections of our London communique, a<br />
document which I now formally table for the information of Honourable Members.<br />
I will then speak of the events concerning the imminent departure<br />
of South Africa from the Commonwealth; an event of great historic importance,<br />
on which I will speak quite frankly, but, I believe, with moderation.<br />
Finally, I will briefly discuss the meeting of the S. E. A. T. O.<br />
Council of Ministers, a meeting largely concerned with the current situation<br />
in LAOS and the attempts now being made to secure a fair and peaceful settlement.<br />
* Turning to disarmament, there are several comments which I would like<br />
to make upon the statement of principles to which we agreed and which appear<br />
in the annex to the communique. But before I do so, let me say that this<br />
overshadowing problem of disarmament is of crucial and urgent importance.<br />
It touches the hearts and minds of all men and women. We therefore devoted<br />
great attention to it. Against this background, these are my comments.<br />
First, disarmament resolutions can give rise to false hopes unless<br />
they are immediately accompanied by action, with concurrent effective inspection<br />
and control.<br />
* Second, nuclear and " conventional" armaments must be dealt with<br />
simultaneously so that at no stage will any country or group of countries<br />
obtain a significant military advantage.<br />
Third, expert consultations must take place during the currency of<br />
political negotiations for a treaty, and should be, in their main aspects,<br />
concluded before any general treaty. To make general declarations about<br />
disarmament at a time when the techniques of inspection and check had not been<br />
worked out or agreed upon would be very dangerous. The Communist powers<br />
would retain full control of their own forces, while in democratic countries<br />
recruiting would tend to disappear, and the public support for defence<br />
expenditure would, on the general promise of disarmament, tend to weaken.<br />
There would, I imagine, be great practical difficulties in securing, by<br />
inspection, the abolition of small arms and other " conventional" weapons in a<br />
vast country with authoritarian control oyer the movements of people and the<br />
reporting of news. Such difficulties must be provided for as part of a treaty,<br />
and not left to subsequent negotiation.<br />
Fourth, we must consider with care the implications of the clause<br />
" All national armed forces and armaments must be reduced to the levels agreed<br />
to be necessary for internal security,." Some nations may claim that,<br />
having regard to their population, territory, and social circumstances, </p>
<p>3.<br />
comparatively large " forces and armaments" are needed for internal security.<br />
Others may need very little. Yet armed strength is relative, not absolute.<br />
The threat of war may well continue on a reduced level of armaments, unless<br />
those armaments, at that reduced level, provide a reasonable balance which<br />
will discourage aggression.<br />
Fifth, assuming as I do that the processes of negotiation, in the<br />
full sense that I have described, will be lengthy and obviously difficult, I<br />
would wish to see a start made with one matter which, if it could be solved,<br />
would do much to create a new and hopeful atmosphere. I refer to the<br />
proposed ban upon further nuclear tests. The nuclear powers have already made<br />
some progress in this field. There is no reason why, with goodwill and good<br />
human sense, success should not be achieved. With nuclear weapons confined as<br />
they are to-day to the control of a few powers, the danger of nuclear war is<br />
reduced. Should more and more nations come into the field, the dangers of<br />
irresponsible use would be materially increased.<br />
There are many other aspects of this vast problem which deserve the<br />
consideration of this Parliament. All I have tried to do at this stage, and<br />
in a brief compass, is to indicate afew matters of what I believe to be of<br />
singular importance. On the question of South Africa and the Commonwealth, I am indeed<br />
sorry that I cannot be as brief as I would wish, During the proceedings in<br />
London there appeared every day, in some newspapers, so-called reports of our<br />
deliberations which were so false as to be absurd; some of them no doubt found<br />
their way to Australia and may have affected many minds. It is therefore<br />
necessary, while not attributing particular views to particulat Prime Ministers,<br />
to put the record straight.<br />
South Africa, having decided to become a Republic, formally applied<br />
for permission to remain a member of the Commonwealth. On the precedents already<br />
established in the cases of India, Pakistan, Ceylon and Ghana, there could be no<br />
technical ground for refusal. But some, not all of the Prime Ministers<br />
indicated that, as Dr. Verwoerd had already indicated his willingness on this<br />
occasion to engage ( under a later item) in a full discussion of South Africa's<br />
racial policies, they would prefer the question of continued membership and<br />
the question of racial policy to be discussed together. This ( though<br />
Dr. Verwoerd clearly desired that the question of continued membership should<br />
be first determined) was accordingly done. The debate was full, frank, and<br />
courteous. However wrong we thought his policies, nobody at the London<br />
conference could or did challenge Dr. Verwoerd's own sincerity. </p>
<p>I pause here to say that this debate having occurred, and there being<br />
now no secret about the opinions expressed by others, I feel relieved of my<br />
previous inhibitions about public statements, and will therefore, before I<br />
conclude, state my own condemnation of apartheid, and my reasons categorically.<br />
At the end of this discussion in the conference, a communique was<br />
drafted, after considerable debate, and after various suggestions and amendments,<br />
I took an active part in the drafting. The broad nature of the draft<br />
was that we first set out that we saw no technical constitutional ground for<br />
refusing the application, but that we had debated, with Dr. Verwoerd's consent<br />
on this occasion, the matter of racial policy. We then went on to summarise<br />
the criticisms that had been made, and the nature of the replies made by<br />
Dr. Verwoerd. We then concluded that, notwithstanding those replies, we<br />
adhered to our criticisms.<br />
There were things about the draft which Dr. Verwoerd did not like.<br />
He availed himself of an adjournment to consider whether he could accept it.<br />
I can say for myself that I believed that if Dr. Verwoerd could accept<br />
the draft, the issue of membership would be decided in his favour. Indeed,<br />
I thought this was the reason for the adjournment. After studying the draft,<br />
Dr. Verwoerd saw Mr. Macmillan, and said that, with some possible verbal and<br />
minor amendments, he would accept the draft, thus making it a unanimous record.<br />
On our resumption, Mr. Macmillan announced this with, I thought, some natural<br />
satisfaction. I say quite confidently that both he and I thought everything<br />
was clear; that the effect of agreement upon the communique would be that<br />
South Africa stayed in.<br />
It was at this closing stage that several of the Prime Ministers<br />
disclosed a final line of attack. Two wanted the communique to conclude with<br />
a declaration that South Africa's policies were incompatible with membership of<br />
the Commonwealth. Another agreed, and added that he reserved the right to move for<br />
expulsion, or to withdraw his own country. Another stated quite frankly that<br />
he would attack South Africa's policies and membership at every possible<br />
opportunity. I need not elaborate. There could be no mistake about the<br />
intensity and sincerity of the views stated. As the discussions proceeded, it<br />
became clear to me that, unless South Africa changed its policies, a considerable<br />
section of the Prime Ministers wanted South Africa out. Speaking for myself,<br />
I wanted it in, for the reasons which I will state a little later.<br />
Once more Dr. Verwoerd withdrew to consider his position. On his<br />
return he said he felt he had no option but to withdraw his application. He<br />
made a few pointed comments on policies in some other countries, but he accepted<br />
the inevitable. </p>
<p>Technically Dr. Verwoerd w~ ithdrew. -But in substance he had to<br />
withdraw unless he was prepared to depart from policies which however criticised<br />
are the settled doctrine of his own Government.<br />
In a section of the Australian press a great effprt is being made to<br />
show that on these matters I am at loggerheads with Mr. Macmillan, and that it<br />
follows that I must be wrong. This is indeed a curious attitude for Australians,<br />
but I will devote a few minutes to dealing with it. I have now studied very<br />
carefully the Hansard record of Mr. Macmillan's speech in the House of Commons<br />
on March 22nd, in order to ascertain what differences of Yvleiwthere may be.<br />
1. Mr. Macmillan said " There was no question of the expulsion of South<br />
Africa, for it became apparent to Dr. Verwoerd himself that he<br />
could not serve the Commonwealth or help its unity and coherence<br />
in any other way except by withdrawing his application."<br />
I have myself stated the facts in their sequence, and what I regard<br />
as the inevitability of Dr. Verwoerd's withdrawal. . The House will<br />
make up its own mind as to whether there is here a difference worth<br />
prolonged debate.<br />
Indeed, I note that in a speech by Lord Home, recently circulated by<br />
the United Kingdom Information Service, Lord Home said " This week a<br />
foundation member of the Commonwealth had to leave the Commonwealth."<br />
2. Mr. Macmillan said " There are some who think that the Commonwealth<br />
will be gravely and even fatally injured by this blow. I do not<br />
altogether share this view. I do not share it at all".<br />
This is not a difference about the facts; it is a difference of personal<br />
opinion as to the consequences of the facts.<br />
I deeply respect my friend Mr. Macmillan's opinion, and I most sincerely<br />
hope that it turns out to be right. But, discarding the word<br />
" fatally", which is not mine, I retain my right to offer my own<br />
opinion that the Commonwealth had been injured and not strengthened<br />
by the departure of South Africa. If I had not thought so, I should<br />
not have been wasting time in efforts to keep South Africa in. Nor,<br />
I imagine, would anybody else! I would like to elaborate my reasons for<br />
my own attitude. They depend, I believe, upon a basic concept of the<br />
Commonwealth which I was not able honestly to abandon. For I believe<br />
in the Commonwealth. Despite what has happewtd, it has much to do for<br />
us and for mankind<br />
But before I deal further with the Commonwealth aspect, I must somewhat<br />
abruptly turn to recent events i'n. the United Nations, so as to. clear<br />
the ground. </p>
<p>6.<br />
Having regard to the events of the last few days in the United Nations<br />
General Assembly and its Committees, and having further regard to what some<br />
regard as a " switch" of policy by Australia, I crave leave merely to state the<br />
facts, which I hope will be allowed to speak for themselves. Having stated<br />
them, I will return to the Commonwealth issue, which was the sole matter to which<br />
the apartheid debate related in London.<br />
In the Special Political Committee, on April 4th, a week ago, there<br />
was a general discussion on apartheid. The particular resolutions to which I<br />
S will refer later were cabled to us and received by us on the morning of<br />
Wednesday April 5th. Our representative, Mr. Hood, made a speech which<br />
accurately expressed our ideas. He did not ( and, in view of some newspaper<br />
observations, I repeat not) say how Australia would vote on any specific<br />
resolution. For the records of this House, I will quote what Mr. Hood said, in full.<br />
" Although the description of this item has not changed since the last<br />
time the Committee debated the policies of apartheid in South Africa, certain<br />
events since 1959 have understandably injected an increased degree of urgency to<br />
which all of us are certainly bound to pay attention. For one thing, the<br />
procedures of the Security Council here for the first time invoked on this matter<br />
a year ago. More recently the outcome of a meeting of Commonwealth Prime<br />
Ministers in London three weeks ago is fresh in the minds of everyone and the<br />
prospect that the Union of South Africa will shortly cease to be a member of the<br />
S Commonwealth has been copiously referred to during this debate.<br />
However, it is the General Assembly consideration that is relevant to<br />
this at the moment. The Commonwealth aspect is a quite separate thing. It has<br />
to be remembered also that the Security Council still has before it the question<br />
S in the form in which it was submitted following the Sharpeville incident in<br />
March 1960. What then is the right way for the General Assembly to treat the<br />
item? We have at issue here the clear disregard by the Union of South Africa<br />
of many previous strong expressions of the views of the General Assembly that the<br />
policy of apartheid is repugnant to Charter principles almost universally accepted.<br />
The provisions concerning human rights are one of the most notable objectives<br />
set out in the Charter, and any failure in their observationce wherever it may<br />
occur is indeed legitimately a matter for the concern of all. The Australian<br />
Government has stated that it feels a most serious disquiet at the racial<br />
policies which have been practised in South Africa, and that it deplores the<br />
results of the application of these policies, one tragic example being the<br />
events at Sharpeville last year.<br />
With the vast majority of world opinion, we neither support nor<br />
condone policies that is deliberate policies of racial discrimination and<br />
we can understand the strong feelings which have led so many delegations once<br />
again to express their condemnation of the practice of apartheid in the Union. </p>
<p>7.<br />
Furthermore, in addition to the questions of principle involved, the policy<br />
of apartheid is, as the Prime Minister of Australia has said, unworkable.<br />
We can at the very least hope that through what one speaker yesterday described<br />
as enlightened self-interest, South Africa will come to a realisation of this.<br />
The question arises whether the General Assembly this time and in the<br />
circumstances that have arisen since 1959 should go further in stressing its<br />
repeated requests that the Union Government should revise its racial policies<br />
0 to remove some of the flagrant contradictions that these have brought about with<br />
some of its obligations under the Charter. It must be pointed out in this<br />
connection that the Charter does expressly set a limit to intervention by<br />
the United Nations in a field of essentially domestic jurisdiction. In addition<br />
to those limits, there are further limits set by the Charter to the powers of the<br />
General Assembly. While there may be marginal ground here, many times fought<br />
over and contested, we should still pause before embarking on any course which<br />
would in effect throw away the whole intent'and purpose of the limitations<br />
specifically put into the Charter. The Australian Delegation, as in the past,<br />
will keep this consideration very closely in mind in examining proposals which<br />
are or may be put before the Committee.<br />
Furthermore the important objective is surely to look beyond simple<br />
condemnation and to open the way for eventual improvement in racial relations<br />
in the Union.<br />
SThe Security Council itself in its resolution last year clearly had<br />
such a prospect in mind. We certainly ought not now to foreclose by drastic<br />
recommendations to Member States the possibility that by patience and sustained<br />
contact, such as that already opened up by the Secretary General, the total volume<br />
of effort and opinion both outside and within South Africa may at last be<br />
concentrated to good effect. It is in the best interests of the Bantu polulation<br />
that this should happen and that the South African Government should not be<br />
confirmed in obduracy by an imposed isolation, The weight of world opinion<br />
against the practice of racial discrimination in South Africa is more than<br />
impressive, it is formidable. Once again the great majority of the members<br />
of the United Nations will wish to give expression to it, this time doubtless<br />
even more emphatically, but punitive measures are likely to serve no purpose,<br />
and on the contrary make it more difficult for those, especially in the Union,<br />
who believe there is still time to reverse a collision course."<br />
On the day on which we received a report of this speech, we were<br />
informed that two Resolutions were to be moved. One, put forward by 25 Member<br />
States, recommended to Member States a series of positive sanctions against<br />
South Africa, including<br />
the breaking off of diplomatic relations with South Africa;<br />
( ii) the closing of ports to all vessels flying the South African flag; </p>
<p>8.<br />
( iii) the prohibiting of ships from entering South African ports;<br />
( iv) the boycott of all South African goods, and a refusal to export<br />
goods to South Africa;<br />
the refusal of landing and passage facilities to all South African<br />
aircraft.<br />
We felt, and feel, no difficulty in opposing such a resolution, for<br />
the reasons so concisely stated by Mr. Hood.<br />
The other resolution, put forward by Ceylon, India and Malaya, was<br />
much more moderate in tone. It deplored the racial policies of South Africa<br />
and some consequences of their enforcement; it deprecated policies based<br />
on racial discrimination; it requested in paragraph 3, action by ' Member States,<br />
within the Charter, to bring about the abandonment of these policies; it<br />
affirmed that such policies violate the Charter and the Declaration of Human<br />
rights; it noted ( in paragraph 5) that " these policies have led to international<br />
friction and that their continuance endangers international peace and security";<br />
it called upon South Africa to bring its policies and conduct into conformity<br />
with its obligations under the Charter.<br />
The time for decision was, as is not uncommon under United Nations<br />
procedures, very short. I consulted my senior colleagues. The resolution<br />
had been up before in the previous Assembly in November, 1959, when Australia<br />
had abstained. In the events that had happened and were happening, we instructed<br />
the Australian Ambassador to the United Nations to vote for this resolution,<br />
having first reserved our position on paragraph 3 ( as it then stood, without a<br />
reference to action being " within the Charter") and on paragraph<br />
Mr. Plimsoll, with our complete authorisation, repeated salient<br />
passages of Mr. Hood's speech and then said<br />
" But, having made this clear, the Australian delegation will record its<br />
vote in favour of the Resolution. This it does so as not to have its<br />
position misinterpreted. It does not support the policy of apartheid and<br />
it joins with other countries in calling upon the Government of the<br />
Union to bring its policy and conduct into conformity with its obligations<br />
under the Charter. To achieve this result, it is, we think, necessary to<br />
vote for the resolution as a whole. But so that there will be no<br />
ambiguity deriving from the Australian vote, it is to be understood that<br />
Australia does not support all the elements of the resolution and that,<br />
in particular, it is strongly opposed to suggestions of sanctions against<br />
Sputh Africa, and that it does not accept the idea that international<br />
peace and security are endangered, as stated in paragraph 5 of the Resolution"<br />
It has been said that this action contradicts my attitude over South<br />
Africa's membership of the Commonwealth. Clearly therefore, the difference </p>
<p>between a Commonwealth matter and a United Nations matter must be cleared up.<br />
The General Assembly of the United Nations is a deliberative, not an<br />
executive body. It offers opinions, which are of course, entitled to great<br />
weight. If it chooses to offer views upon the conduct or policy of any<br />
country, those views will be offered, with every member nation free to speak.<br />
SResolutions are proposed, and votes are taken.<br />
The CommonweaIth is a different matter. Itis, ina loose. but. real qense,<br />
a special organisation ufider the head,; 6ftheC6dmonWealth, the Queen. -Its membership<br />
grow. out ofa special history,', and is nQt conditionedu* byrules or procedures<br />
ef the United Nations. Members stand in. a very special relationship one to anothera<br />
relationship quite differentfrom.. thatof members of the United Nations.<br />
The Commonwealth has hitherto existed without resolutions or votes<br />
except in such a case as that which arose in 1949, when India became a Republic<br />
and when a new constitutional structure or practice was adopted unanimously.<br />
The Prime Ministers meet in private for a frank exchange of ideas and information.<br />
They have discussions of an intimacy which is quite impossible in the United<br />
Nations. They frequently exercise more influence over one another than they<br />
perhaps realise at the time. Their strength is in their very variety.<br />
In a paradoxical sense, part of their strength is in their differences of<br />
history, of background, of traditions, of personality. They advocate their<br />
own views, but they do not sit in judgment. This year there were suggestions<br />
made by some Prime Ministers that the Commonwealth should " show what it stands<br />
for" by propounding a code of principles, or a new " Bill of Rights", observance<br />
of which would presumably become a condition of new or confirming membership.<br />
I want to state quite clearly that I most strongly opposed any such notion.<br />
I said that it would give rise to problems of interpretation under a host of<br />
changing circumstances; that it would encourage legalisms in a body<br />
previously happily free of them; that it could well lead to charges and<br />
counter-charges of breach; and that the old happy and profitable search amid<br />
differences for unities and understanding would be replaced by an emphasis upon<br />
disagreements. The British Commonwealth, I said, could not long survive<br />
such a development. I went on to say, as I say now, that a written code of " principles"<br />
could not stop short at racial problems, which are in any event not peculiar<br />
to one Commonwealth country. It would presumably set out some of those great<br />
elements which are part of our heritage; the rule of law, the sovereignty of<br />
Parliameht, no imprisonment without trial, an uncontrolled press.<br />
The famous Balfour formula of 1926, which set out for the first<br />
time to define the Commonwealth, used three expressions which are to-day either<br />
inaccurate or not generally accepted. </p>
<p>practice that Commonwealth Conferences do not discuss the internal affairs<br />
of member countries Ministers avAiled themselves of Mr. Louw's presence in<br />
London to have informal discussions with him about the racial situation<br />
in South Africa. During these informal discussions Mr. Louw gave<br />
information and answered questions on the Union's policies, and the<br />
other Ministers conveyed to him their views on the South African problem.<br />
The Ministers emphasised that the Commonwealth itself is a multi-racial<br />
association and expressed the need to ensure good relations between<br />
all member-states and peoples of the. Commonwealth."<br />
I know of nothing which has happened since May 1960 to convert the<br />
internal affair of South Africa into a matter warranting intervention by the<br />
Commonwealth, except that it has been widely debated, and the policy<br />
roundly condemned. I hope that nobody will suggest that Dr. Verwoerd admitted that<br />
, apgrtheid was no longer a domestic matter. What he did was to face the fact<br />
that on this occasion, with his continuation of Membership application before<br />
the chair, debate about apartheid was inevitable.<br />
However, the departure of South Africa has happened, and I have no<br />
heart to enter into needless arguments about it. But let us, who are within<br />
the covenant of the Commonwealth, make no mistake. The issue concerns more<br />
than South Africa; it concerns the whole characteraind future of the greatest'<br />
international partnership the world has yet seen.<br />
One should, perhaps,. hesitate to speak of J. C. Smuts, the great<br />
Commonwealth man, who, be it remembered, first expressed the policy of separate<br />
development in South Africa, but whose contribution to freedom cannot be reckoned<br />
inferior to that of any man now engaged in public affairs. But in 1960, after<br />
the Prime Ministers' Conference and on invitation by the University of Cambridge<br />
I delivered the first Smuts Memorial Lecture. My subject was " The Changing<br />
Commonwealth". I will quote, for my present purpose, just one passage from a paper<br />
to which I devoted the thought and experience of half a life-time.<br />
" We do not meet as a tribunal, to sit in judgment upon each other,<br />
or to ventilate intra-Commonwealth issues, We are not a super-state.<br />
During the recent tragic ep~ isodes in South Africa there were not<br />
wanting suggestions that South Africa should be expelled presumably by<br />
majority vote from the Commonwealth. Any such suggestion, in my opinion,<br />
misconceived the nature of our association. We do not deal with the domesticpolijpolicies<br />
of any one of us, for we know that political policies come or go with<br />
governments and that we are not concerned with Governments and their policies </p>
<p>12.<br />
so much as we are with nations and their peoples. If we ever thought of<br />
expelling a member nation of the Commonwealth it would, I hope, be because we<br />
believed that in the general interests of the Commonwealth that nation as a<br />
nation was not fit to be our associate."<br />
These words come back to me to-day. Under inexorable pressure,<br />
South Africa is. out of the Commonwealth. It is not the Verwoerd Government<br />
that is out. It is the Union of South Africa; the nation evolved by the<br />
great Liberal statesmanship of 1909; the nation of Botha and Smuts;, the<br />
nation from which, in two wars, soldi~ rs fought side by side with our own,<br />
the 1st South African Division being alongside our 9th Division at El Alamein;<br />
the nation which provided lines of supply to the Middle East at a time when<br />
the Mediterranean was an acutely dangerous sea; the nation, over 45% of the<br />
voters of which recently voted to remain w-ithin the direct allegiance to the<br />
Throne; the people, three quarters of whom, as men of colour, to whom we have<br />
a great and brotherly responsibility, might reasonably be presumed to find some of<br />
their future hopes of emancipation in the membership of the great Commonwealth.<br />
I hope I may look to my fellow members of this Parliament to share in<br />
my sorrow at these unhappy circumstances.<br />
I therefore now turn to a statement on apartheid, a statement now<br />
rendered l oth permissible and necessary. I preface it by emphasising that I was<br />
not, in Ldndon or here, concerned to defend apartheid, which, indeed, I condemn.<br />
My great object was to defend the interests of my own country.<br />
I deeply resent the attempt that has been made in some quarters to<br />
suggest that, as I wanted to keep South Africa in the Commonwealth, I should<br />
be taken to favour or con ope the shooting of natives at Sharpeville. That<br />
0 incident shocked the world, and me.<br />
I am against apartheid; against some of the modern manifestations and<br />
practices because they offend the conscience; against it as a basic policy<br />
because it seems to me to be doomed to a most terrible disaster. But we are<br />
a fair-minded people, and we should try to understand how the basic policy came<br />
to be adopted, and what it was originally designed to achieve. What I will say<br />
will be by way of explanation and not by way of defence.<br />
In 1917, while in London as a distinguished member of the War Cabinet,<br />
Smuts made a notable speech on South African problems. He said<br />
" Instead of mixing up black and white in the old haphazard way, which instead<br />
of lifting up the black degraded the white, we are now trying to lay<br />
down a policy of keeping them apart as much as possible in our institutions.<br />
in land ownership, settlement and forms of government we are trying to keep them </p>
<p>apart, and in that way laying down in outline a general policy which it may<br />
take a hundred years to work out, but which in the end may be the solution<br />
of our native problem. Thus in South Africa you will have in the long<br />
run large areas cultivated by blacks and governed by blacks, where they will<br />
look 8fter themselves in all their forms of living and development, while<br />
in the rest of the country you will have your white communities, which<br />
will govern themselves separately according to the accepted European<br />
principles." In our thinking this idea is now outmoded; it is much too severely<br />
applied;-huniane modern political ideas are against it; it will fail<br />
disastrously. But in every country in which there are large numbers of people<br />
of different races, millions of European stock, millions of coloured stock,<br />
the problem must arise as to whether there should be separate development,<br />
or integration, with equality of political and social rights within the same<br />
geographical area. This, to me ( and I still refer to the original policy),<br />
is essentially a problem of statesmanship. It has moral aspects if, in the<br />
pursuit of one policy or the other inhumanity is practised, injustices occur,<br />
or the dignity of man is debated. But the initial judgment is one of statesmanship.<br />
The problem exists in many countries; but it is most acute in South<br />
Africa. I am profoundly grateful that we do not have it in Australia.<br />
It is against this background that I criticise what South Africa does<br />
about a problem which is its problem, not ours.<br />
I think that the policy will, if it continues to be applied as it is<br />
now, end in the most frightful disaster, Dr. Verwoerd told us in London<br />
what his government is doing, in the fields of health and education in<br />
particular, for the Bantu, both in the Bantu territories or homelands", and<br />
in the ordinary provinces. He demonstrated that South Africa was spending<br />
very much more on these purposes than any other African country. He saw<br />
the Bantu, in the territories, coming up by stages to self-government, as we<br />
see the people of Papua and New Guinea. But he saw no prospect of equal<br />
political rights for the Bantu living and working in the ordinary provinces.<br />
Nor did he seem to me to envisage ( if, indeed, such a thing be practicable)<br />
a complete territorial as well as a racial division of South Africa, so that<br />
all members of each race might be completely self-governing in their own place.<br />
As he knows from what I have said to him, both in conference and out of it,<br />
I think there is a fatal flaw in this policy. The more zealously the<br />
Union builds up the minds and bodies of the Bantu, the more certain will it<br />
be that the day will come when, conscious of their own human dignity, their<br />
capacity, and their strength, they will no longer tolerate the status of </p>
<p>144<br />
second-class citizens. And, when that dOy comes, they will demand their<br />
due, not inan atmosphere of evolving friendship, but with hostility and,<br />
for all Me know, violence. The ultimate conflict, as I said in London,<br />
may be bloody and devastating.<br />
There are, to us, certain astonishing things in the application of<br />
the policy which have, ' I'think, done much to alienate world opinion. One of<br />
them I, and others, earnestly discussed with Dr. Verwoerd in London. The<br />
Union does not accredit-or receive diplomatic missions to or from Commonwealth<br />
countries in Asia and Africa. This discrimination is, to me, offensive to the<br />
great countries concerned. I pointed out that there is great valuein such<br />
exchanges, and that to deny them is to suggest some notion of racial<br />
s uperiority, intolerable in form, and utterly unjustified in fact. I did my<br />
best to point out to him that even this one diplomatic step would do something<br />
to lesson the tension which we all wanted to see relaxed. But Dr. Verwoerd<br />
was adamant on this point, as on others. He felt that there would be a grave risk<br />
of " incidents" arising from public opinion and private action. I said, in<br />
vain, that it was better to accept these risks than to incur the certainty<br />
of mounting hostility-.<br />
A phase has been coined to the effect that I have " equated"<br />
apartheid and Australia's immigration policy. This is quite untrue. One<br />
policy relates to a discriminatory policy in respect of people already<br />
permanently resident; the other, our own, to a discrimination in the<br />
W admission of persons for permanent residence. I hope I do not need UL be. told<br />
that the two things are quite different. I have always been grateful,* to my<br />
friend-, the Tunku Abdul Rahman, the Prime Minister of Malaya, for his warm<br />
and helpful . recognition of the validity of our policy and of our right to adopt it.<br />
But the whole point that I make is that, while I believe that our<br />
immigration policy is both wise and just, is based not upon any foolish -notion<br />
of racial superiority, but upon a proper desire to preserve a homogeneous<br />
population and so avert the troubles that have bedevilled some other countries,<br />
it is a domestic policy. And the right to determine our domestic policy is<br />
part of our sovereignty as a member of the Commonwealth.<br />
In short, what I have been saying is that the rule of non-interference<br />
in the domestic affairs of sovereign communities in the Commonwealth, once<br />
broken, may be broken again in the future. Such a development would concern us<br />
all very deeply. Before leaving the London Conference, I would like to say that in the<br />
course of a general review of the world situation, several of the Prime<br />
Ministers mentioned the matter of Continental China. No conclusion was<br />
either sought or arrived at, reports to the contrary in a section of the press<br />
being quite untrue. </p>
<p>But I think it my duty to the House to put it in posse-ssion of the<br />
views presented by me.<br />
I said thai I thought there was much lopse talk about " recognising"<br />
Continental China as if the problem admitted of a simple-answber. I pointed<br />
out that we have here a complete nest of questions. liplomatic recognition,<br />
for example, was a bi-lateral matter. Some nation might be unwilling to<br />
" recognise" in this sense, while being willing to admit Continental China<br />
to the United Nations. But then there were further considerations.<br />
Was Continental China to include Formosa? Were the inhabitants of that<br />
country to be handed over to the control of the Communists?<br />
And then, supposing that Continental China accepted, as a condition<br />
Sof admission to the United Nations, the exclusion of Formosa ( the " two Chinas"<br />
solution) was Formosa, as an independent nation, to be cast into outer darkness,<br />
or was she to become herself a member of Who was, in any such events,<br />
to have tie permanent seat on the Security Council, with its right of veto?<br />
And, supposing that, as many nations feel, the Security Council should be<br />
broadened by the addition of further permanent and temporary members ( I have<br />
heard countries like India, Pakistan and Brazil mentioned), should the new<br />
permanent members be permanent in the sense of not needing to be re-elected,<br />
or should they also have the veto?<br />
I ha # re re-stated these points to the House as a warning against over<br />
W simplificatio', and not as containing any suggestion that Australia's policy<br />
on the matter is in process of change. It was stated fully in this House by<br />
Mr. Casey ( as he then was) and that statement stands.<br />
After the Conference, I attended a meeting with Mr. Heath, the<br />
Lord Privy Seal, Mr. Selwyn Lloyd, the Chancellor of the Exchpquer, and<br />
Mr. Soamep, the Minister for Agriculture, on the problem of the European Common<br />
Market, and its relation to the Free Trade area, i. e. the problem of" the seven"<br />
and " the six". As Honourable Members know, our position is that, so far from<br />
complaining about the 6-power treaty we have seen in it great political as<br />
well as economic value. But we believe that some wider association which<br />
would include Great Britain is desirople if Western European unity is to be<br />
achieved and maintained.<br />
But we have our special interests to protect, particularly our<br />
exports of primary products both to Great Britain and Eurbope. I made it clear<br />
to the United Kingdom Ministers that before any negotiation calculated to<br />
lead to an offer or " agreement in principle" took place, Australia<br />
expected the fullest consultation. </p>
<p>In that sense, I said, consultation was essential % hen ideas were in<br />
proce . ss of formulation, and not after they had become either fixed or<br />
presented. I received an explicit assurance that this rule should be<br />
observed. There was also agreement to my suggestion that our officials<br />
should meet to examine whatever specific proposals might'. be put forward<br />
within a month or two.<br />
Subsequently, I was able to have a talk with Mr. Lloyd about the<br />
possibilities of Australian entry to the London loan market durkg 1961.<br />
As Honourable Members know, Treasury approval is needed in such matters.<br />
Mr. Lloyd was most helpful and favourable, subject of course to amounts and<br />
details which always have to be workedout nearthe chosen time for an issue.<br />
Incidentially, I found that our London stocks were strong in the market; and<br />
our credit good.<br />
Finally, I spebk of the SEATO Meeting at Bangkok. Among those<br />
present were the Foreign Secretary of the United Kingdoip,' the-U, S. A. Secretary<br />
of State, the Prime Minister of New Zealand, and the foreign ministers of<br />
France, Pakistan, Thailand and the Philippines. The principal subject was<br />
LAOS. That country's future in or out of the Communist orbit is<br />
very important. It is one of the countries covered by the South-East<br />
Asian Treaty. It has a long common frontier with Thailand, a member of<br />
SEATO. It is vulnerable to aggression from North Vietnam and Communist<br />
China. The civil conflict is conducted by relatively small forces, and, in<br />
its own way, life goes on. In such circumstances, Communism has a happy<br />
hunting-ground. But for SEATO, Laos is important in terms of defence. It provides<br />
a test of the significance and effectiveness of a treaty or~ anisation creat~ d<br />
to resist Communist aggression. For, if Laos passes into Communist hands,*<br />
where does the process end? There are grim thoughts in this for Australia.<br />
The conference proved to be both understandirU and invigorating. All<br />
representatives went away feeling and saying that SEATO had bdeen given'ne***<br />
significance and force. We finally evolved a Resolution which was, in spite<br />
of some anticipations of differences and difficulties, unanimously approved.<br />
I had the satisfaction of playing an active part in its drafting andi<br />
acceptance. It has been published, but I table it formally for the<br />
information of H-onourable Members.<br />
At this stage, I will content myself with a few observations </p>
<p>1. We all agreed with the proposals made by the United Kingdom<br />
to the Soviet Union: that there should be a cease fire, a<br />
revival of the I. C. C. to supervise the Cease Fire and the<br />
stabilisation of the local scene, and an International<br />
Conference of the kind which gave rise to the Geneva Accords<br />
in 1954.<br />
2. We all felt that there should be created in Laos a more<br />
broadly based government which could, by commanding wide<br />
support in Laos, eliminate avoidable causes of internationtl<br />
strife.<br />
3. We made it clear that we did not wish Laos to become a " satellite"<br />
of either the Communist or the non-Communist Powers. We desired it to be<br />
independent, united, sovereign and neutral. We felt that<br />
if Laos were unaligned with any power or group of powers, no<br />
good excuse would arise for further Communist intervention.<br />
4. We had, and I now more than ever have, great hopes that the Soviet<br />
Union would accept the United Kingdom proposals. But we<br />
affirmed that. should there continue to be an active military<br />
attempt to obtain control of Laos, members of SEATO, are prepared,<br />
collectively and in the terms of the Treaty, to take whatever<br />
action may be appropriate in the circumstances. We all hope and<br />
believe that no military intervention will be necessary. There<br />
can be no actual commitment of forces except by the decisions of<br />
governments I say this because I would wish to dispose of any<br />
idea that SEATO is either truculent or aggressive. But it is<br />
necessary to say that if, unhappily, collective SEATO action<br />
is forced upon us, we will need to act together or find SEATO<br />
weakened and destroyed.<br />
I must not dwell on these possibilities. At present, we have<br />
high hopes of a peaceful settlement and should concentrate our efforts upon<br />
it. Before I conclude, I would like to say two things.<br />
The first is that this statement of mine, though inevitably<br />
expressed very largely in the first person since I have been actively and<br />
personally concerned in these matters, and have no desire to escape my<br />
great personal responsibilities expresses the viewi; of Cabinet, which has<br />
taken a full share in its preparation. </p>
<p>18.<br />
The second is that I have had no desire torehearse differences,<br />
or merely to criticise decisions already taken. But over a period of a<br />
quarter of a century,-it has been my privilege to have something to do,<br />
or say, or write, about the Commonwealth. It is something dear to our<br />
hearts. It means and will mean much for sanity and tolerance in a<br />
grievously troubled world.<br />
We shall play our part with as: much vigour and determination as in<br />
the past. We maintain our faith in the Commonwealth, in its valueto its member<br />
nations, and in its ability to make constant and notable contributions to<br />
the peace and prosperity of the world and of all its peoples. Controversdes<br />
have arisen about my own attitude towards recent events. It is, if I<br />
may say so, only just that my reasons for my views should be plainly stated<br />
to the Australian Parliament, which has given me itsg nerous confidence for so<br />
many years, and to the Commonwealth of which I have tried to be a loyal servant. </p>
<p>MEETING OF COMMONWEALTH PRIME MINISTERS<br />
FINAL COMMUNIQUE MARCH 17th, 1961<br />
The Meeting of Commonwealth Prime Ministers was concluded to-day.<br />
Pakistan, Ghana and Cyprus were represented by their Presidents. The other<br />
Commonwealth countries were represented by their Prime Ministers.<br />
It had been agreed that on this occasion the Prime Ministers would<br />
concentrate their main attention on a limited number of specified problems which<br />
are currently of common concern to them all namely, disarmament, the structure<br />
of the United Nations and certain constitutional problems affecting the<br />
Commonwealth itself. At the outset of the Meeting, however, the Prime Ministers<br />
held a general review of the international situation as a whole, in order to set<br />
these particular problems in the perspective of current world events. They also<br />
considered, in the course of their Meeting, recent developments in the Congo<br />
and in South East Asia.<br />
The Prime Ministers re-affirmed the upport of their Governments<br />
for the efforts of the United Nations to restore order in the Congo and to<br />
secure the independence and integrity of the Republic. They deplored outside<br />
intervention in the Congo and recognised that many of the problems which had<br />
arisen were due to such intervention. They considered that the United Nations<br />
forces in the Congo should be strengthened and that the Security Council<br />
resolution of 21st February should be fully implemented.<br />
The Prime Ministers noted with concern the situation which had<br />
developed in Laos. They expressed the hope that the parties would be able to<br />
reconcile their differences, that intervention from outside would cease, and that<br />
Laos would be enabled to enjoy an independent, neutral and peaceful existence.<br />
The Prime Ministers held a full discussion on the problem of<br />
disarmament. They recognised that this was the most important question facing<br />
the world to-day and considered that a favourable opportunity was now at hand<br />
for a fresh initiative towards a settlement of it. They agreed that the aim<br />
should be to achieve general and complete disarmament, subject to effective<br />
inspection and control, on the general lines indicated in the statement in<br />
Annex 1 of this communique. They recalled the resolution on general and<br />
complete disarmament which was adopted unanimously at the 14th session of the<br />
General Assembly. They agreed that every effort should be made to implement<br />
this resolution by agreement between the major powers, and that further<br />
negotiations for this purpose were necessary. Certain proposals designed to<br />
promote such negotiations have been put by various countries before the United<br />
Nations. </p>
<p>2.<br />
The Prime Ministers expressed their hope that the negotiations on the<br />
cessation of nuclear weapons tests, which were due to re-open at Geneva on 21st<br />
March, would lead to the early conclusion of an agreement on this subject.<br />
Such an agreement, apart from its importance in itself, would provide a powerful<br />
impetus towards agreement on disarmament generally.<br />
The Prime Ministers considered the various proposals which have<br />
recently been put forward for changes in the structure of the United Nations<br />
S including, in particular, the structure of its Councils, the position of the<br />
Secretary-General and the organisation of the Secretariat. They recognised<br />
that such changes could only be made with general consent. They agreed that,<br />
whatever adjustments might be made, it remained vitally important to uphold<br />
the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter and to preserve the<br />
S international and independent character of the Secretariat. They further agreed<br />
that members of the Commonwealth shared with all nations a fundamental common<br />
interest in maintaining the integrity of the United Nations as a force for<br />
orderly political, economic and social progress throughout the world.<br />
The Prime Ministers also discussed certain constitutional<br />
questions relating to Commonwealth membership. The conclusions reached were<br />
announced in communiques issued on 13th, 15th, and 16th March relating,<br />
respectively, to Cyprus, South Africa, and Sierra Leone. The text of these<br />
communiques is reproduced in Annex 11. </p>
<p>ANNEX 1<br />
STATEMENT ON DISARMAMENT<br />
Aim 1. The aim must be to achieve total world-wide disarmament, subject<br />
to effective inspection and control.<br />
2. In view of the slaughter and destruction experienced in so-called<br />
" conventional" wars and of the difficulty of preventing a conventional war,<br />
once started, from developing into a nuclear war, our aim must be nothing<br />
less than the complete abolition of the means of waging war of any kind.<br />
Principles 3. An agreement for this purpose should be negotiated as soon as<br />
possible, on the basis of the following principles<br />
All national armed forces and armaments must be reduced to the levels<br />
agreed to be necessary for internal security.<br />
Once started, the process of disarmament should be continued without<br />
interruption until it is completed, subject to verification at<br />
each stage that all parties are duly carrying out their undertaking.<br />
The elimination of nuclear and conventional armaments must be so<br />
phased that at no stage will any country or group of countries<br />
obtain a significant military advantage.<br />
In respect of each phase there should be established, by agreement,<br />
effective machinery of inspection, which should come into operation<br />
simultaneously with the phase of disarmament to which it relates.<br />
Disarmament should be carried out as rapidly as possible in<br />
progressive stages, within specified periods of time.<br />
At the appropriate stage, a substantial and adequately armed<br />
military force should be established, to prevent aggression and<br />
enforce observance of the disarmament agreement; and an international<br />
authority should be created, in association with the United Nations,<br />
to control this force and to ensure that it is not used for any<br />
purpose inconsistent with the Charter. </p>
<p>2.<br />
4. On the basis of the above principles, it should be possible, given<br />
goodwill on both sides, to reconcile the present differences of approach<br />
between the different plans put forward.<br />
Negotiations 5. The principal military powers should resume direct negotiations<br />
without delay in close contact with the United Nations, which is responsible<br />
for disarmament under the Charter. Since peace is the concern of the whole<br />
world, other nations should also be associated with the disarmament negotiations,<br />
either directly or through some special machinery to be set up by the United<br />
Nations, or by both means.<br />
6. Side by side with the political negotiations, experts should<br />
start working out the details of the inspection systems required for the<br />
measures of disarmament applicable to each stage, in accordance with the<br />
practice adopted at the Geneva Nuclear Tests Conference.<br />
7. Every effort should be made to secure rapid agreement to the permanent<br />
banning of nuclear weapons tests by all nations and to arrangements for<br />
verifying the observance of the agreement. Such an agreement is urgent,<br />
since otherwise further countries may soon become nuclear powers, which would<br />
increase the danger of war and further complicate the problem of disarmament.<br />
Moreover, an agreement on nuclear tests, apart from its direct advantages, would<br />
provide a powerful psychological impetus to agreement over the wider field of<br />
disarmament.<br />
8. Disarmament without inspection would be as unacceptable as<br />
inspection without disarmament. Disarmament and inspection are integral parts of<br />
the same question and must be negotiated together; and both must be made as<br />
complete and effective as is humanly possible. It must, however, be recognised<br />
that no safeguards can provide one hundred per cent protection against error or<br />
treachery. Nevertheless, the risks involved in the process of disarmament<br />
must be balanced against the risks involved in the continuance of the arms race.<br />
9. It is-a~ rguable whether the arms race-is the cause or the. re-sult'of<br />
distrust between nations. But it is clear that the problems of disarmament and<br />
international confidence are closely linked. Therefore, while striving for the<br />
abolition of armaments, all nations must actively endeavour to reduce tention by<br />
helping to remove other causes of frict'ion and suspicion. </p>
<p>4. ANNEX 11<br />
CYPRUS Communique issued on 13th March. 196<br />
At their meeting this morning the Commonwealth Prime Ministers<br />
accepted a request from the Republic of Cyprus for admi'ssion to Commbnwealth<br />
membership. They invited the President of the Republic to join the Meeting.<br />
SOUTH AFRICA<br />
Communique issued on 15th March, 1961<br />
At their meetings this week the Commonwealth Prime Ministers<br />
have discussed questions affecting South Africa.<br />
On 13th March the Prime Minister of South Africa informed the<br />
Meeting that, following the plebiscite in October, 1960, the appropriate<br />
constitutional steps were now being taken to introduce a republican form of<br />
constitution in the Union, and that it was the desire of the Union Government<br />
that South Africa should remain within the Commonwealth as a republic.<br />
In connection with this application the meeting also discussed,<br />
with the consent of the Prime Minister of South Africa, the racial policy<br />
followed by the Union Government. The Prime Minister of South Africa informed<br />
the other Prime Ministers this evening that in the light of the views expressed<br />
on behalf of other member Governments and the indications of their future<br />
intentions regarding the racial policy of the Union Government, he had decided<br />
to withdraw his application for South Africa's continuing membership of the<br />
Commonwealth as a republic.<br />
SIERRA LEONE<br />
Communique issued on 16th March, 1961<br />
The Prime Ministers noted that~ Sierra Leone would attain<br />
independence on 27th April, 1961.<br />
They looked forward to welcoming Sierra Leone as a member of the<br />
Commonwealth on the completion of the necessary constitutional processes. </p>
<p>THE SEVENTH MEETING OF THE COUNCIL OF SEATO,<br />
BANGKOK, MARCH 29th, 1961<br />
R E SOL UTIO N<br />
Having examined the situation in Laos and the Republic of Vietnam,<br />
the Council unanimously approved the following resolution<br />
1. Consulting together as provided in the Manila Pact, the SEATO<br />
Council has noted with grave concern the continued offensive by<br />
rebel elements in Laos who are continuing to be supplied and assisted<br />
by Communist powers in flagrant disregard of the Geneva Accords.<br />
The Council once more makes it clear that SEATO is a defensive<br />
organization with no aggressive intentions and reiterates, in the<br />
words of the Treaty " its desire to live in peace with all peoples<br />
and all governments".<br />
3. The Council desires a united, independent and sovereign Laos, free<br />
to achieve advancement in ways of its own choosing and not subordinate<br />
to any nation or group of nations.<br />
4. It is believed that these results ought to be achieved through<br />
negotiations and cannot be hoped for if the present fighting continues.<br />
The Council notes with approval the present efforts for a cessation of<br />
hostilities and for peaceful negotiations to achieve an unaligned and<br />
independent Laos.<br />
6. If those efforts fail, however, and there continues to be an active<br />
military attempt to obtain control of Laos, members of SEATO are<br />
prepared, within the terms of the Treaty, to take whatever action may<br />
be appropriate in the circumstances.<br />
7. The Council also noted with concern the efforts of an armed minority,<br />
again supported from outside in violation of the Geneva Accords, to<br />
destroy the Government of Vietnam and declared its firm resolve<br />
not to acquiesce in any such takeover of that country.<br />
8. Finally, the Council records its view that the Organization should<br />
continue to keep developments in Laos and Vietnam under urgent and<br />
constant review in the light of this resolution. </p>
