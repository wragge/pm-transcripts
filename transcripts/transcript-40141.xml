    <content><![CDATA[<p><strong>The Hon Jamie Briggs MP</strong></p>
<p>The Minister for Cities and the Built Environment, the Hon Jamie Briggs MP, has resigned from the ministry.</p>
<p>As Mr Briggs has noted in his public statement, Ministers are expected to uphold high standards of behaviour as set out in the Ministerial Standards. On this occasion his conduct fell short of that standard. After being invited to reflect on his position, he offered his resignation which I have accepted.</p>
<p>While disappointed by the conduct that led to his resignation, I thank Mr Briggs for his capable service as a Minister.</p>
<p>I look forward to Mr Briggs continuing to make a valuable contribution to the work of the Government in the future.</p>
<p>The Minister for the Environment, the Honourable Greg Hunt MP, will act as Minister for Cities and the Built Environment.</p>
<p><strong>The Hon Mal Brough MP</strong></p>
<p>The Hon Mal Brough MP and I have agreed that he will stand aside as Special Minister of State and Minister for Defence Materiel and Science pending the completion of inquiries by the police.</p>
<p>The Minister for Finance and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator the Hon Mathias Cormann, will act as the Special Minister of State, and the Minister for Defence, Senator the Hon Marise Payne, will act as Minister for Defence Materiel and Science.</p>
<p>In offering to stand aside Mr Brough has done the right thing, recognising the importance of the Government maintaining an unwavering focus on jobs, economic growth and national security.</p>
