<p>CAMERON:</p>
<p>Good afternoon and welcome to the ABC.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, it's very nice to be here and it's nice to be interviewed</p>
<p> by you.</p>
<p>CAMERON:</p>
<p>Well, the first question would have to be, how on earth are you running</p>
<p> the joint without me?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>With difficulty. With several degrees....</p>
<p>CAMERON:</p>
<p>I thought you'd be struggling a bit.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>We have been and with great difficulty and we miss you.</p>
<p>CAMERON:</p>
<p>Oh well, I am pleased to hear that.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>We do miss you. We are sorry that you are not with us but we are very</p>
<p> pleased that you have re-engaged in your original profession of choice</p>
<p> which you do very well.</p>
<p>CAMERON:</p>
<p>Would you be pleased to know there is life after politics?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I am reassured about that, yes.</p>
<p>CAMERON:</p>
<p>I have discovered weekends, I have discovered night-time, I have discovered</p>
<p> family and grandchildren. It's all terrific.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>That's good, I am pleased to hear it.</p>
<p>CAMERON:</p>
<p>How was Kalgoorlie?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Kalgoorlie was great. First visit there by a Prime Minister since</p>
<p> Malcolm Fraser went in 1981. Great town. I hadn't been there</p>
<p> for more than 10 years. I didn't know it all that well. The people</p>
<p> are pretty optimistic despite the understandable....</p>
<p>CAMERON:</p>
<p>They've been [inaudible]?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>They have been. Commodity prices are down, the world outlook for gold</p>
<p> is not all that strong. They are hung up and [inaudible] and held</p>
<p> back because the native title thing in Western Australia has still</p>
<p> not been resolved. They thought that once we resolved it federally</p>
<p> then a resolution of it at State level would happen automatically.</p>
<p> It has happened in New South Wales and Queensland but it hasn't</p>
<p> happened here. And because of that there's a lot of hesitancy</p>
<p> about investment.</p>
<p>CAMERON:</p>
<p>Do you think you are able to allay some of their fears whilst you</p>
<p> were out there yesterday?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I think they would have come away with a very strong impression</p>
<p> that I was sympathetic to the mining industry. On native title the</p>
<p> outstanding issues can only be resolved at a State level. We have</p>
<p> done our bit, I mean, we fixed the federal legislation but Richard</p>
<p> court can't get the complementary State legislation through because</p>
<p> the Labor Opposition is opposing it. Now, they reached settlement</p>
<p> on one relatively minor element of it yesterday but the major issue</p>
<p> which is the replacement of the right to negotiate with a State based</p>
<p> regime hasn't yet been passed and that is holding up a lot of</p>
<p> exploration and a lot of investment.</p>
<p>CAMERON:</p>
<p>Well, I often quote that there are problems and inconveniences if</p>
<p> I could suggest that Kalgoorlie is an inconvenience compared to the</p>
<p> problems faced by the people of East Timor. You are obviously keeping</p>
<p> a very close eye on this, you are going up, I believe, to Bali next</p>
<p> Tuesday?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Next Tuesday, yes, to have a talk with the Indonesian President.</p>
<p>CAMERON:</p>
<p>You obviously managed to organise that fairly quickly. I was impressed</p>
<p> by the fact that you are able to be on the phone one week and say</p>
<p> I am going to be speaking to the President, the Defence Minister and</p>
<p> the Foreign Minister the next week.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes, I decided on Sunday that I would ring him and express my concern</p>
<p> about what had happened in Dili over the weekend. Because of the conversation,</p>
<p> the way the conversation was going I thought it was appropriate to</p>
<p> [tape break]...responded very positively and immediately and said,</p>
<p> yes, that's a good idea, let our foreign minister organise the</p>
<p> details of the meeting. And it's taking place next Tuesday and</p>
<p> I'll be taking Alexander Downer and John Moore with me and he'll</p>
<p> bring his Defence Minister and his Foreign Minister, Ali Alitas.</p>
<p>CAMERON:</p>
<p>It often makes me wonder when you say you've called President</p>
<p> Habibie - and you can say, well, I'm not going to answer that</p>
<p> question if you don't want to - does he speak good English?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>He does, he has very good English. We conducted the conversation in</p>
<p> English.</p>
<p>CAMERON:</p>
<p>Oh right.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>And his English is very good. [tape break] understood English but</p>
<p> in any formal situation we would talk through interpreters.</p>
<p>CAMERON:</p>
<p>Right. So if you'd phoned the previous President....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>That would have been done...it would have been what I call a three-wayer.</p>
<p> He would have heard me in English and then he would have answered</p>
<p> back through his interpreter.</p>
<p>CAMERON:</p>
<p>Do you find it when dealing with your counterparts in other countries,</p>
<p> it is a lot easier to be able to speak in one language?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh, of course it is. I feel inadequate that I cannot speak all of</p>
<p> these languages but so many people, of course, leaders around the</p>
<p> world are fluent in English. Dr Habibie is one, the Prime Minister</p>
<p> of China, Zhu Rongji, I've had a half hour conversation with</p>
<p> him in English. He's quite fluent. It's very impressive</p>
<p> when people have your language and very diminishing in a sense when</p>
<p> you don't have their language.</p>
<p>CAMERON:</p>
<p>Especially when it's a language so different.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, that's right and...but....</p>
<p>CAMERON:</p>
<p>What about Pope John Paul II, he's got eight languages or something....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>He has. I've had a few brief exchanges with him but not as Prime</p>
<p> Minister. I met him briefly when he was out here in 1986. He's</p>
<p> quite fluent in a number of languages, he's quite a linguist.</p>
<p>CAMERON:</p>
<p>Well, I heard recently the album that is being put out with featuring</p>
<p> the Pope on it, you may have seen the CD being advertised with some</p>
<p> very lovely music with various things the Pope has said over the last</p>
<p> 25 years recorded. And one of my grandchildren said to me listening</p>
<p> to this, this is the Count isn't it? And this is the Count Dracula</p>
<p> from Sesame Street because he has got that middle European accent.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes, he has.</p>
<p>CAMERON:</p>
<p>Moving on to another trouble spot in the world, to Kosovo, and the</p>
<p> fact that we were going to take in some refugees from there physically</p>
<p> into Australia it now appears that the powers that be in that part</p>
<p> of the world would prefer them to remain close to home which seems</p>
<p> to me an imminently sensible thing. Australia, I presume, will be</p>
<p> providing some kind of financial support to help those people out</p>
<p> as it would have cost us a fortune to bring them here anyway?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, Eoin, our offer to take them still stands and whilst it is less</p>
<p> likely now that they will come it is still possible that we will be</p>
<p> asked after all to take some and we are still willing to do so. We</p>
<p> have already offered $6 million, we will obviously consider offering</p>
<p> more if, particularly if it has become absolutely certain that we</p>
<p> won't be required to take the 4,000 or any part of the 4,000.</p>
<p> It would have cost us quite a lot of money and plainly it would be</p>
<p> reasonable for us if they are definitely not coming to consider contributing</p>
<p> something out of the money it would have cost to take them here for</p>
<p> their upkeep in Europe.</p>
<p>CAMERON:</p>
<p>To help them at home.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>It's a huge humanitarian challenge. I understand the reason why</p>
<p> the authorities in Europe decided as they did but I want people to</p>
<p> understand that our willingness to take them still stands.</p>
<p>CAMERON:</p>
<p>Okay. Alan Jones, a well known Sydney commentator who you'd be</p>
<p> aware of, made a comment on television whilst I was crook a couple</p>
<p> of weeks ago, I remember seeing him on television. He came up with,</p>
<p> what I thought was a relatively simple and sensible idea, that very</p>
<p> often Australia is called upon to provide humanitarian aid to people</p>
<p> in trouble spots around the world, why can't we provide that</p>
<p> aid in food that our farmers need to flog somewhere, in other words,</p>
<p> the Government buys it from the farmers and then passes it on as aid.</p>
<p> Woollen goods that have been manufactured in Australia from wool grown</p>
<p> in Australia, and I can imagine that in places like Kosovo there'd</p>
<p> be a demand for woollen goods, jumpers, blankets, that sort of thing.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, on the face of it that sounds a very sensible suggestion. I</p>
<p> guess it's all a question of whether what you need at a particular</p>
<p> time is available in the quantities that you want at that particular</p>
<p> time. And oddly enough there may not be surplus supplies of the woollen</p>
<p> goods that you might need tomorrow in Kosovo available today in some</p>
<p> store somewhere in Australia. I guess the answer is that if you could</p>
<p> do that and it be made to work properly we'd do it. I think it's</p>
<p> a very sensible thing....</p>
<p>CAMERON:</p>
<p>They could be stockpiled surely because I am sure that people aren't</p>
<p> going to worry about last year's fashions or the year before.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, no, you could certainly stockpile clothing, food is more difficult.</p>
<p>CAMERON:</p>
<p>Senator Harradine, I know that we are jumping everywhere here but</p>
<p> I have a lot to get through in a very short period of time. Do you</p>
<p> ever get frustrated, I know that you have to be fairly sensitive with</p>
<p> him because you are relying on this man to get some legislation through</p>
<p> the Senate along with Senator Mal Colston, do you sometimes think</p>
<p> you could grab him by his relatively scrawny neck and strangle him</p>
<p> a bit?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, I don't. I don't feel that way towards Senator Harradine,</p>
<p> I feel that way towards the Democrats and the Labor Party but not</p>
<p> Senator Harradine. Because Senator Harradine has been pretty constructive.</p>
<p> Remember that Senator Harradine did end up sitting down with me and</p>
<p> negotiating a sensible outcome on native title, which is more than</p>
<p> the Democrats and the Labor Party did. He sat down and negotiated</p>
<p> a sensible outcome on other things. I have found him over the last</p>
<p> three years to be a reasonable man. He has strong views on certain</p>
<p> issues, he's never made any secret of that  never made</p>
<p> any secret.</p>
<p>CAMERON:</p>
<p>So you know where he's coming from?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I know exactly, well not exactly, but I understand his value system.</p>
<p> I respect it, I may not always agree with it although I'd have</p>
<p> to say a lot of the things he says on a lot issues are not terribly</p>
<p> different from some views I hold too. And I don't mind saying</p>
<p> that but there are some things where he obviously goes [tape break]</p>
<p> issues he is still very much a Labor man and therefore he's not</p>
<p> very helpful to us on things like youth wages and unfair dismissal</p>
<p> laws but he's never dissembled about that. But I don't get</p>
<p> frustrated with Brian Harradine at all.</p>
<p>CAMERON:</p>
<p>Well, we have a lot of talkback callers on this programme who do get</p>
<p> frustrated with the minor parties, a lot of them support the minor</p>
<p> parties too and say, we didn't elect this mob, they only got</p>
<p> x' number of votes and yet they are holding the country</p>
<p> to ransom and saying you can do this, you can't do that. That</p>
<p> must be a frustration?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, look, let me put it this way  we went to the last election</p>
<p> and as you know we suffered some casualties....</p>
<p>CAMERON:</p>
<p>You did, you are looking at one.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Indeed. And we took a huge risk in running on what was a potentially</p>
<p> unpopular tax reform proposal. We won that election and we put out</p>
<p> all of the detail and we really think we have a right to have that</p>
<p> implemented, we think we do have a mandate. If we don't have</p>
<p> a mandate to do this tax thing then no government in the history of</p>
<p> Australia has ever had a mandate to do anything. So I can understand</p>
<p> the anger of people and they should really direct some of that anger</p>
<p> at the Democrats and the Labor Party and not just at Senator Harradine.</p>
<p> See he seems to cop a disproportion share of the blame of things being</p>
<p> altered in the Senate yet his attitude towards Government legislation</p>
<p> in the Senate has been a lot more accommodating and reasonable than</p>
<p> the attitude of say the Democrats or the Greens.</p>
<p>CAMERON:</p>
<p>I noted that Meg Lees, leader of the Democrats, today was talking</p>
<p> about what food they reckon should be exempted and what.....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Hmmm, the Irish model.</p>
<p>CAMERON:</p>
<p>The Irish model? Well, it's almost like, and I hesitate to say</p>
<p> an Irish joke, when she's talking about this because she was</p>
<p> talking about, okay, plain bread would be GST free under her model</p>
<p> and it would be free if it had fruit in it but you can't put</p>
<p> vegetables in it.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, that's right. And a hamburger wouldn't be under her</p>
<p> model.</p>
<p>CAMERON:</p>
<p>That's right.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I mean, that is a joke, Irish or otherwise...</p>
<p>CAMERON:</p>
<p>It's a joke, an Australian joke.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I said yesterday, forget about the Irish model much and all</p>
<p> as I love the Irish but let's focus on the Australian model which</p>
<p> is the one the people voted for last October. And this idea that we've</p>
<p> got to borrow from experience overseas, let's construct a tax</p>
<p> system that suits our circumstances. That's what we did last</p>
<p> year and that's what, can I say again, what the people voted</p>
<p> for. It would be a different matter if I hadn't said anything</p>
<p> about this or if I had just said, I am in favour of tax reform people</p>
<p> and I will tell you the details after the election. They'd have</p>
<p> had every right then to pick and choose and put and take but I laid</p>
<p> it all out as you know. We produced tables and this and that and we</p>
<p> argued every last dollar and we won and we have a right to see the</p>
<p> plan implemented.</p>
<p>CAMERON:</p>
<p>One of the very popular breads, at least in Western Australia at the</p>
<p> moment and I presume all over Australia, at the moment is plain bread</p>
<p> with sundried tomatoes through it. Now, under the Senator's model,</p>
<p> you might like to put this to her, that would have to be GST free</p>
<p> because a tomato is a fruit not a vegetable.....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I won't presume to answer for her but it sounds as though</p>
<p> are right.</p>
<p>CAMERON:</p>
<p>Well, thank you very much for that. Bob Hawke, this is once again</p>
<p> leaping in a different direction, Bob Hawke has made a statement and</p>
<p> a speech he has just made about the stolen generation, he called Australia's</p>
<p> attitude as a stain on Australia's collective history. How's</p>
<p> your reaction to that?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I understand why, and I am one of those myself, why Australians</p>
<p> now feel that those things shouldn't have been done, and they</p>
<p> wouldn't have been done today and they regret them and they're</p>
<p> personally sorry for what happened. I have no argument with that and</p>
<p> I've said that myself and I guess in a sense his view and my</p>
<p> view's not all that different. I think where we may depart is</p>
<p> whether we have some kind of collective formal apology for what happened</p>
<p> then by today's generation even though today's generation</p>
<p> were not involved. Now I don't think that's appropriate.</p>
<p> It's not because I'm insensitive to what happened, (inaudible)</p>
<p> indifferent to it. But you've got to remember that a lot of the</p>
<p> people who were involved in looking after these children in missions</p>
<p> and homes and so forth, thought they were doing the right thing. No</p>
<p> I know it's possible now to brand all of them as transgressors,</p>
<p> and molesters and all this sort of thing. And in many cases that is</p>
<p> monstrously unfair to people who are now dead, or too old to sort</p>
<p> of defend themselves. Now that wasn't always the case. In some</p>
<p> cases it was. But abuse occurs in all sorts of circumstances. It goes</p>
<p> on today. It goes on as we speak. My only quarrel with the people</p>
<p> who've been critical of me on this issue is not that I would</p>
<p> want to see that happen today. It's clearly not right. But it</p>
<p> was something that people thought was beneficial at the time, sanctioned</p>
<p> by the law of the time, and I just don't think it's appropriate</p>
<p> for today's generation to sort of collectively apologise. I mean</p>
<p> I will say sorry and I'll apologise for something that I've</p>
<p> done wrong, or something for which I'm directly responsible,</p>
<p> but a forced apology just for the sake of settling a political problem</p>
<p> is no apology at all. If people who say to me, why don't you</p>
<p> just give the apology and move on  that is utterly insincere.</p>
<p> It would mean nothing to the people who want it and I'm just</p>
<p> not in the business of doing that.</p>
<p>CAMERON:</p>
<p>Well you're the big kahuna in Australia. I mean you are the person,</p>
<p> obviously if there was going to be a formal apology would say: as</p>
<p> the Prime Minister of Australia I'm terribly terribly sorry for</p>
<p> what has happened in the past, any mistreatment ta da ta da ta da.</p>
<p> The fear of yours that then the legal fraternity will be saying ripper.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
