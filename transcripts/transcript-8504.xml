SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING MP,<br />
PRIME MINISTER'S OLYMPIC DINNER<br />
NATIONAL TENNIS CENTRE, MELBOURNE<br />
FRIDAY, 8 MAY 1992<br />
Ladies and gentlemen<br />
It is my pleasure to be here tonight, to welcome all of you,<br />
and to have the opportunity to briefly speak on behalf of a<br />
great cause.<br />
We have a love affair of long standing with the Olympic<br />
Games. Perhaps a little conceitedly, we tend to see our Olympians<br />
as a measure of ourselves.<br />
It is therefore only just that as a nation we make a<br />
collective contribution. It is not too much to ask that we<br />
pay for the privilege of basking in the glory.<br />
I think it's of some significance that the idea of the<br />
modern Olympics was born in the 1890s, the decade in which<br />
it might also be said that the idea of Australia was born.<br />
The history of our nation and the history of the Olympics<br />
have run remarkably parallel courses.<br />
The 1890s saw the birth of the Commonwealth of Australia.<br />
More than that, it was the period when Australian men and<br />
women writers and artists, politicians, visionaries of all<br />
kinds, ordinary Australians talked about what sort of<br />
society they might build under the Southern Cross.<br />
They celebrated what was here. The virtues of the great<br />
outdoors. The light and the space of Australia and the<br />
distinctly Australian way of life which evolved from that. </p>
<p>They celebrated the pioneering virtues of mental and<br />
physical endurance. And the great virtue of freedom.<br />
They celebrated a distinctly Australian way of life.<br />
They used words like " mateship", " solidarity", and a " fair<br />
go for all" to describe what they believed were the<br />
essential principles of life and what, therefore, were the<br />
essential principles of a good society..<br />
The ethos in Australia was different to that which evolved<br />
in another pioneering society, the United States we<br />
tempered their rugged individualism with a much stronger<br />
belief in social equality. In the fair go.<br />
The principles which evolved in this country in those years<br />
sat very happily with the creed of the modern Olympics.<br />
Australians, still in the pioneering phase of their history,<br />
still in competition with nature, young and determined to<br />
prove themselves against the world, relished the idea of<br />
Olympic competition.<br />
But there are other elements in the idea of the Olympics<br />
which I think also appealed.<br />
I mean the idea that the important thing is not to win but<br />
to take part. That it's not the triumph but the struggle.<br />
That it's not to have conquered but to have fought well.<br />
Above all, the goal is to quote the Olympic Charter to<br />
contribute to building a peaceful and better world by<br />
educating youth through sport practised without<br />
discrimination of any kind and in the Olympic spirit, which<br />
requires mutual understanding with a spirit of friendship,<br />
solidarity and fair-play.<br />
If you substitute the word " mateship" for the word<br />
" friendship", you have some very familiar Australian values<br />
there at the end.<br />
Mateship, solidarity, fair-play.<br />
It seems to me that the idea of Olympic competition as it<br />
was originally conceived, and as the Charter still insists,<br />
has much in common with our own traditional aspirations as a<br />
nation. And perhaps that has something to do with the fact that<br />
Australia is one of the very few countries in the world to<br />
have participated in every Olympic Games since their<br />
foundation in 1896.<br />
It has something to do, perhaps, with all of us being here<br />
tonight. From the very beginning, we have been highly successful<br />
participants. </p>
<p>Australians have always been famously good at sport.<br />
Here in Melbourne in 1956 we did so well I suspect we<br />
thought that there was none better in the world, and never<br />
would be.<br />
It has not been so easy since of course.<br />
Other countries, in particular those in what used to be<br />
called the Eastern Bloc, overwhelmed us until the awful<br />
day came when we went to an Olympic Games and came back<br />
without a medal.<br />
Our collective misery after this might have produced a panic<br />
reaction. We might have lost sight of the main game.<br />
But twelve years later I think we can say with some pride<br />
our response has been the right one to my mind the very<br />
best one.<br />
We responded with vigour and determination and, dare I say<br />
it, money.<br />
In 1980 the team which went to Moscow received a Federal<br />
Government grant of $ 800,000.<br />
The teams for Barcelona and Albertville received a Federal<br />
grant of $ 10 million.<br />
Before the govbernment came to office the sports budget was<br />
$ 6 million.<br />
In 1983 we increased that to $ 36 million.<br />
Last year it was $ 68.4 million.<br />
Let me say at once never, I believe, has Commonwealth<br />
money been better spent.<br />
Among many other things it enabled the completion of the<br />
Australian Institute of Sport, which is now pretty well<br />
universally considered to be the best of its kind in the<br />
world. The money we have spent has enabled us to produce a whole<br />
new generation of young Australians to dedicate themselves<br />
to becoming world class athletes.<br />
And many of them have become world class athletes and that<br />
includes sports we never excelled before.<br />
I think we can take the greatest pleasure from the fact that<br />
we have broadened the base of sport in Australia. </p>
<p>More Australians many more Australians play many more<br />
sports than they ever did before.<br />
There was a paradox about sporting performance in the past<br />
those golden years when Betty Cuthbert was winning gold<br />
medals on the track and Dawn Fraser swept all before her in<br />
the pool, the years when our athletes turned in consistently<br />
spectacular performances were years when most Australians<br />
were spectacularly unfit.<br />
Spending on sport has played a major part in seeing our<br />
national health levels, particularly among children,<br />
immeasurably improved.<br />
As I said, we have broadened the base.<br />
We have done this through a large and strategic<br />
encouragement of sport of f the Commonwealth budget, which<br />
has made sport and sporting facilities much more generally<br />
available to Australians.<br />
The establishment of the Australian Sports Commission has<br />
been a boon.<br />
At the same time Aussie Sports adapted traditional sports in<br />
ways which allow everyone to take part.<br />
These steps have not only broadened the sports base, but<br />
improved the quality of our society.<br />
They represent further progress towards the land of the fair<br />
go towards both the Olympic ideal and the Australian<br />
ideal.<br />
Such achievements don't thrill us in the way that Betty<br />
Cuthbert and Dawn Fraser did in Melbourne, or the sight of a<br />
Keiran Perkins or a Tim Forsyth winning in Barcelona will.<br />
But as a country we should be proud of these acheivements in<br />
the last decade. They are very much in the tradition of the<br />
Olympics. I was impressed by a speech Shane Innes formerly Shane<br />
Gould gave at the Prime Minister's Women and Sports Awards<br />
in March.<br />
She spoke about the terrific pressure sports people were<br />
under, especially because of the philosophy that says " if<br />
you don't win, you lose."<br />
True as that might be in politics, it is not true in the<br />
Olympics. At least it should not be: though we all know that too often<br />
too many countries, too many athletes, have taken that as<br />
their motto. </p>
<p>I think we can take great pride in the fact that it has<br />
never been ours.<br />
Every athlete wants to win every Australian wants to.<br />
But the real aim is participation: it is to strive to do<br />
your best.<br />
In the Olympics it is very simple if your best on the day<br />
is the best in the world, and only if it is, you win.<br />
And your country will be proud-of you.<br />
If it's not enough to win, you've achieved what few others<br />
will ever achieve you've competed with the very best.<br />
And your country this country will be proud of you.<br />
I think we should work to keep those principles in<br />
Australian sport.<br />
They will serve our country very well. Our youth very well.<br />
I think they're the key to a good society.<br />
They will serve both the Olympic spirit very well, and the<br />
spirit of Australia.<br />
I am also one of those who believe that they will see their<br />
benefits on the victory dais in Barcelona.<br />
I thank you all for coming. For your contribution to what<br />
is a great national cause.<br />
And most of all I congratulate those members of the<br />
Australian Olympic team whose hard work has earned them the<br />
privilege of meeting and competing with the best athletes<br />
from 170 nations of the world.<br />
I wish you all the success and the fun you deserve. </p>
