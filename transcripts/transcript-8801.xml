TEL: PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW WITH HOWARD SATTLER, RADIO 6PR 27<br />
JANUARY 1993<br />
2 AND OE PROOF ONLY<br />
SATTLERI Are you going to be an asset or a liability to<br />
Carmen Lawrenceat this election?<br />
PMI I am leading John Hewson in the preferred Prime<br />
Minister stakes and every national oinion-pol so I don't<br />
have any problems about entering state election campaigns but<br />
they are state election campaigns.-Of their essence they are<br />
different to commonwealth issues and therefore one can lend<br />
support as I am to Carmen and her government but I am not<br />
obviously part of the campaign in a sense that I am part of<br />
the governent here.<br />
SATTLERI yourself? Were you invited to take part or did you invite<br />
PMi I was over here in December Z think or November<br />
and of course a week or so ago and I have seen her a number of<br />
times recently and she said come over, we would he pleased to<br />
see you here.<br />
BATTLER! PM Â® She said we would be pleased to see you?<br />
Absolutely.<br />
BATTLERi DO you think the electorate will be, that's the<br />
most important part of it?<br />
PMI am the Prime Minister and<br />
see you. That may be why the electorate is not happy to<br />
PMI The fact is, well let's go on the polls. The<br />
polls say that the Federal Government is ahead and that I am<br />
at this stage preferred Prime Minister over John HewSon so I<br />
27. Jan. 93 19: 40 No. 052 P. 01/ 12 </p>
<p>TEL: 27 .3an .93 19: 4U NO UDZ L-<br />
2. P) s ( cont'd) don't have any reticence about coming here but<br />
again I am not trying to Claim it as territory that is ours.<br />
It's obviously a state issue and how often one enters, I mean<br />
how often does a Prime Minister enter a state elections that<br />
is the question you are saying. I mean I don't know,<br />
BATTLERt While you are here you have become involved in<br />
a Public row over john . UoWrunis tax af fairs. Why for god's<br />
sake would you do that?<br />
1PlC Because I was attacked yesterday by Mr Downer.<br />
BATTLER i Mr Downer is a pretty junior member of the<br />
Howson team, why would you worry about him?<br />
PM: And by Dr Howson today.<br />
BATTLERS He attacked you after your attack.<br />
PM. No, no thin matter was raised not by me or the<br />
government, it came up in a book written by<br />
BATTLER: An unauthorised biography?<br />
PM: Well Dr Heweon I think was interviewed by the<br />
woman who wrote the book, Christine Wallace and his tax<br />
af fairs came into the public arena ' anid I just ' simply made the<br />
point that it's Dr Howson who was saying that the first<br />
national issue of note in Australian public life should be tax<br />
policy. He wants to tax everyone's expenditure and so I was<br />
pointing simply to his philosophy about taxation. If he takes<br />
the view that, particularly low and middle income people whose<br />
income and expenditure are one and the same, that Is people<br />
who save nothing, spend every cent they earn, whether you tax<br />
their income or their expenditure is the same. So he i s<br />
saying let's tax their expenditure with a GST but if you are a<br />
high income tax payer then he thinks app a-rently that you can<br />
minimise your tax,<br />
SATTLERS Can't you legally?<br />
PM: It's a matter of what one's moral stand in.<br />
Thare is no minimisation with the GST, you pay it or you don't<br />
got the goods.<br />
GATTLERi But isn't it true your own piggery business<br />
earned 84 million and didn't pay any tax?<br />
PM: Totally without foundation-<br />
8ATTIER: True or false?<br />
PM: False, totally without foundation.<br />
GATTLERtBATTLmEucRh. HdOiWd it Pay out of the s4 million? </p>
<p>TEL:' 27?. Jan .93 19 : 40 No Ut2 M, -uo i z<br />
PM. I See Howard you are asking me a qusion about<br />
Dr Howson&amp;' s tax. For eight months I have been attacked in the<br />
Senate at Dr Howson's behest by Senator Baums<br />
GATLEMa Who you are now suing?<br />
PK, No I don't remember you ever saying to Dr<br />
Howson on any radio program, why are you getting to the Prime<br />
Hiniuter, Dr Howsonl about his personal affairs? Why have you<br />
done this for eight months? No one said that to hime so oneO<br />
Mention from the Government and then it's all a matter of high<br />
notoriety. SATTLERs But the point is you have been the Treasurer or<br />
Prime Minister for all of the time Labor's been in power. Now<br />
if Dr Howson is doing things illegal that's another matter but<br />
this has all come about<br />
PX. Look, look i am Just simply making a simple<br />
point. Wte a matter of philosophy, he is saying that if you<br />
are an ordinary wage and salary earner he is going to tax<br />
everything you consume and your services bar certain food<br />
items# certain food items, but everything else, your shoes,<br />
clothing, household materials, your dry cleaning, it doesn't<br />
matter what it is and your gas, your water, your electricity<br />
and you can't avoid it because you pay the tax, that's it.<br />
You can't minimise it but if you are on the income tax side<br />
it'* a matter of where his philosophy is whether he believes<br />
one should be able to minimise tax.<br />
SATTLERs You believe that don't you if you can do it<br />
l egalIly?<br />
PM, One shouldn't need to pay more than their fair<br />
share of tax but it's a matter of whether in this case what<br />
appears to be the case, and he hasn't refuted the claims made<br />
in the book, is that he's tried to make a private expense into<br />
a business deduction, that's the point.<br />
BATTLERt He is trying to make the beet of Paul Keating's<br />
policies. PM: No, no, no leave me out of it.<br />
BAT'ILERt You have been the Treasurer or Prime Minister<br />
PM-. I am not the Tax Comissioner.<br />
BATTLER: You arc the goverrnent you set the rules.<br />
IPM. Ibut I don't peer over Dr Howson's shoulder when<br />
he is filling in hie tax return, that's for him to do.<br />
BATTLERt Just put those headphones on for a moment<br />
because I have got a cut of a speech you made in 1988 and I<br />
would like you to respond to this. </p>
<p>TEL: 27. Jan. 93 19: 4U No. u z r. u,,-L<br />
4. PMI anyone in this country who has wealth,<br />
ilncom are mostly inCorporated. I guarantee you half the<br />
prose gallery is incorporated and it is entirely sensible. I<br />
am not attacking you for it, it'@ the thing you do when the<br />
tax system urges you to do it."<br />
SATTLER: That's what you said In 1988 to the Press Club,<br />
PX1 I'll say it again, no problem at all.<br />
BATTLER: But you seem to be encouraging people<br />
P) 1 But look Howard your listeners don't have their<br />
mortgage payments deductible against their income, do they?<br />
SATTLERs Well some do, ne don't.<br />
PX1 That's the point, that's the point. That is,<br />
what is a private expense and what is a business deduction?<br />
An inoorporatLon is beside the point. You incorporate if you<br />
are running-a--business, if someone is a business person<br />
selling radio services you may well be incorporated and that<br />
would be fine. if somebody is providing accountancy services<br />
they could be incorporated. They are providing a service and<br />
the incorporation covers them against limitation of liability<br />
etC. The whole question goes to one's philosophy about<br />
taxation. I am not the one proposing to put a GST on<br />
everybody's back, John Hewuon is. He is the one that has got<br />
to answer the questions.<br />
SATTLERt You are saying it I am right that this revolves<br />
around something which you should not have been able to claim<br />
company expenses for. Is that right?<br />
PM: I think it's a matter of how one exploits the<br />
tax system and what one's philosophy is about it. Por most<br />
people that is a matter not of such consequence but for Dr<br />
Hewson he is proposing to levy a GST which is equal to half<br />
the income tax of Australia. The GST's proceeds are half the<br />
current Commonwealth income tax, that's how big it is. He is<br />
campaigning on a totally radical change to the tax system so<br />
one has to be quite clear about one's philosophy in these<br />
respects. SATTLERt Your track record in the tax area, your<br />
personal record isn't perfect is it?<br />
PM: In terms of tax changes?<br />
SATTLERs No, no 7our personal tax situation, You failed<br />
to lodge returns at least once.<br />
PX1 I failed to lodge a return but it was a return<br />
where I was in credit, I wasn't in deficit. I didn't owe<br />
money I was owed money, I was owed money but it was late. </p>
<p>TEL: 27. Jan. 93 19: 40 No. Ut2 F. u/-<br />
SATTLER But I just Wonder whether or noi from an<br />
electoral point of view you are getting yourself into an area<br />
which might rebound on you.<br />
PM: Howard, look let me say this. When was the<br />
last time you had John Heweon here?<br />
SATTLERo I had him last week as I understand it.<br />
PMI ' Why didn't you ask him why did he attack me for<br />
eight months in the Senate? Did you7<br />
SATTLERI No I didn't ask him that.<br />
PM. Why didn't you?<br />
SATTLER I was doing an interview about his wife and<br />
what role his wife was going to play if he became Prime<br />
Minister. PM: But why didn't you ask him, I mean this has<br />
been a matter of public notoriety?<br />
BATTLERs Because it wasn't in the context of the<br />
interview. PHI Okay that's a somewhat disingenuous answer you<br />
agree? SATTLERs No I don't.<br />
PM No well of course<br />
SATTLER: well next time round when he is sitting here on<br />
his own like you, I mean next time if you bring Annita with<br />
you I suggest I would be talking to her about the role she is<br />
going to play<br />
PM: That's fine, I am Just saying to you, this<br />
matter has been reported in The West Australian over the<br />
months. He has had Senator Baume in there without any<br />
justification, without -an wvibtahsoiust, any substance,<br />
attacking me under parliamentary privilege<br />
SATTLER: And you are suing Senator Eaume?<br />
PMI Finally of course he started to say things<br />
without the parliamentary privilege and I took the first<br />
opportunity to respond to him, Nobody asked me on radio about<br />
that, no one asked John Hewoon on * adio about it. The only<br />
journalist as far as I know in this country who raised it was<br />
Alan Ramsey in the Sydney Morning Herald.<br />
BATTLER: Will Parliament be recalled on February 23 as<br />
scheduled? </p>
<p>TEL: 27. Jan. 95 19: 4U NO. U'Z r. uQ,'<br />
G PNI Yes.<br />
SATTLERS And will you be happy to take questions about<br />
your personal tax situation and his?<br />
PM1 Mine is as clean am a whistle, there is no<br />
problem about me I have got a small interest in a piggery,<br />
simple as that. There must be thousands of farmers in Western<br />
Australia, my situation no more or less complex than that.<br />
SATTLZRi How much money have you got in the piggery?<br />
PM1 That's all a matter of public record.<br />
SATTLERi Don't you know?<br />
PM1 Yen, I have got about $ 400,000 in it.<br />
SATTLERt That's a small investment?<br />
PM: ror piggeries these days, for a farm, farms are<br />
quite capital intensive things but I don't remember anyone<br />
asking Doug Anthony, who was deputy prime minister about his<br />
piggery. I don't remember anybody asking Malcolm Fraser about<br />
his farms but you see there is one rule for the coalition and<br />
one rule for Labor.<br />
SATTLER. Could it be that you have set new rules, new<br />
standards about getting personal of people and<br />
PM8 NO, no just understand this I have never<br />
attacked people about their personal affairs, never.<br />
SATTLER: include what you are saying about John Hewson<br />
in that category?<br />
PM: Zn Parliament, in Parliament, I will defend the<br />
governmentle policy, I will put a view aggressively but what I<br />
on't do is use the parliamentary privilege to hop into<br />
people's personal affairs.<br />
SATTLER: But if yOU recall Parliament as planned on the<br />
23 February will you be prepared to take questions about the<br />
piggery, bacause I am sure you are going ask questions about<br />
John Hewson?<br />
PM: I have been sitting there for eight months in<br />
the House of Representatives, every day prepared to take<br />
questions about anything and John Howson wouldn't ask me. You<br />
know why, because there was nothing in it? He was happy to<br />
have someone do it in a cowardly way up in the Senate under<br />
privilege and at least one journalist said, if these questions<br />
are so important Dr Hewson why don't you ask them in the House<br />
of Representatives? One journalist put a note into his office<br />
saying, here was the reply, no reply came because he knew it<br />
was just basically a scam and a shambles. </p>
<p>EL: 27. Jan .93 19: 40 qo .052 P. 07/ 12<br />
7. GATTLISRi Were you accusing him of being gutless?<br />
PM. I am accusing him of trying to disparage me<br />
undrr vilgein another chamber. No is out saying Keating<br />
plays it tough, he hits us in the jaw, he does this, he does<br />
that bUt w~ hat I don't do is use parliamentary privilege to<br />
make defamatory claims about members of parliament, I have<br />
never done that.<br />
BATTLU t You said this has been talked about f or some<br />
time and we have spent a bit of time on it today but I just<br />
wonder whether all this personal squabbling between you and<br />
John Howson about your own personal affairs ion't irrelevant<br />
to the main game?<br />
PHI Let's make this clear. I gave a major speech<br />
to 10500 people in the convention centre in Sydney the day<br />
before Australia Day associated with the Sydney 2000 bid. on<br />
Australia Day yesterday I gave a major speech to the country<br />
about all the great public issues, Last week in Nelbourne I<br />
gave a ma jor speech about education and the fact that they are<br />
not being picked up in the media is not my fault or the<br />
Government's fault. It's the priorities which people in the<br />
media put on news.<br />
SATTLERi Yes# but I have got a feeling the electorate,<br />
the people in the real world would be saying can we just get<br />
on with the real job here.<br />
PM: Why don't the newspapers report the real<br />
speeches, why isn't the messages of Australia Day in a thirty<br />
minute speech or the day before reported broadly?<br />
SATTLER; Are you aure?<br />
PMI Because the media is always looking around for<br />
something which is more inflammatory.<br />
SATTLERo Do you agree Prime Minister that discussion and<br />
quite expansive discussion today all over the place about Paul<br />
Keating's piggery and John Hewson'S Miftimiuing tax should be<br />
dispensed with?<br />
PH. Put it this way, it was not the Government who<br />
raised this matter. Let me remind you this was raised in a<br />
book by somebody totally dissociated with the Government. In<br />
fact a former Liberal Party staffer, a former Liberal Party<br />
staffer who wrote a book, not me, not at our urging, it Just<br />
appeared two days ago,<br />
BATTLERt But why are you even bothering about it?<br />
PHI Because Dr Hewqon wants to put a consumption<br />
tax on everybody's back.<br />
TEL </p>
<p>I~. z an: .(. Jdfl.' j i' 4 1 w<br />
0.<br />
SATTL222 So if someone writes something about John<br />
Hewson minimising tax you will use that to beat him over the<br />
head over his CST?<br />
PX4 Just to make the point that he in not entitled<br />
I don't think to be asking people to pay through the nose with<br />
the GST while reserving the rLght to minimise tax.<br />
SATTLIRI Other issues which again are not main issues<br />
but ones which certainly got a lot of feedback over here were<br />
the issue of the Speaker, Leo XcLeay, I think he is a friend<br />
of yours and I think he is from the same faction as you.<br />
PM3 Can I just interrupt you there. Here you are<br />
Howard saying a minute ago that we would be on the main issues<br />
and what do you do one minute later, you are onto some side<br />
event that just doesn't matter.<br />
SATTLZR i What I am saying is the electorate, the<br />
talkback callers in droves were ringing up and saying why is<br />
this man getting $ 65,000 for falling off a bike he shouldn't<br />
have been riding? They say it's symptomatic of the Government<br />
that doesn't care.<br />
PM$ It's nothing to do with the Government.<br />
SATTLERI Didn't the Government finally approve the<br />
PM1 It's not the Government It was done through the<br />
established Commonwealth processes, all set up within the<br />
SATTLERs But you are for a fair and Australia<br />
PMe Listen, look, two days ago, for two days I gave<br />
major speeches to the country about Australia's place in Asia,<br />
about the need for Australians to mount the challenges that<br />
are confronting us, about the need to get investment and<br />
employment back. About putting research and development and<br />
education back high in the constellation of our national<br />
affairs which again I was doing today with Carmen Lawrence.<br />
They are the subjects that I have elected to speak about but<br />
it's very hard to get any coverage for them and I had some<br />
people say to me on Australia Day, those who attended the<br />
convention centre, some of the 1,500 who attended the<br />
convention centre in Sydney the day before how scandalous was<br />
the scant reporting of what I laid, you see.<br />
SATTLER&amp; I have heard John Hewson complaining that he in<br />
not getting a fair go from the media.<br />
PM1 I don't mean a fair go, no, it's about whether<br />
the media focusses on trivia or on substantive national issues<br />
and you just a minute ago said, I am not quite sure whether<br />
you understand what you said to me. What you have said to me<br />
was why are you on this and not on the major issues?<br />
I E" L: </p>
<p>Jan .93 19 : 40 No .052 P .09/ 12<br />
SAMTE1 Why are you?<br />
VMS Yaen, and then a minute later you ask about Lo<br />
McLeay's compensation claim.<br />
BATTLERS But I prof aced that by saying we have had heaps<br />
Of calls on it, the public think it's a big issue.<br />
PXI The job of people like you and me is to say the<br />
real issue in to make sure that the basis f or growth and<br />
employment and wealth and prosperity are progressed in this<br />
country. They are the real issues.<br />
SATTLERi They are the thing that people believe that you<br />
should be doing.<br />
PHI That's what we, are doing, that's what I devoted<br />
Australia Day to and the day bef ore to and last week a major<br />
speech on education.<br />
BATTLER: But an appeal to national prLde on Australia<br />
Day which by the way and this is another issue I jiLght put,<br />
you might think it'a an issue that's not of great importance<br />
but an Ausatralia where half of the country celebrates the<br />
national day one day and halt on another day, I mean surely<br />
that's symptomatic of the malaise of Australia.<br />
PNI I think that's coming together next year.<br />
GATTLERi In it?<br />
PM, I think so.<br />
BATTLER., But why didn't you step in?<br />
FMm I think it will all be on the one day.<br />
BATTLER: What do you think of the Government here<br />
decreeing it will be next Monday, forget your Labor<br />
affiliations? PM I think Australia Day should be acknowledged<br />
across the country on the one day, on the 26 January. That's<br />
what should happen, that's the sensible thing to happen.<br />
BATTLERs Is that the right day too because a lot of<br />
Aboriginal people think it's not, they think that's the day<br />
when they should be mourning. I wonder when we become A<br />
republic, and I underline that when, and if you are around at<br />
the time how about makinj that our national day whenever that<br />
happens? PK: The 26 January is the day we celebrate as the<br />
day of our settlement, our first day of our settlement,<br />
European settlement in Australia and no doubt if you were part<br />
of a nation dispossessed you would have a jaundi~ ced view of<br />
TEL </p>
<p>T2EL7: . Jan. 93 19: 40 No. 052 P. 10/ 12<br />
' O.<br />
PH. ( cont'd) the 26 January too and that's why it is<br />
imnortant that Australia move ahead as a country where therse<br />
diferences are basically reconciled. ' That we put behind us<br />
our history.<br />
SATTLER' Could that involve changing our national day to<br />
another day which everybody supports and may be that would be<br />
the day we became a republic, think about it?<br />
PHI I will take it on board.<br />
SATTLERe What do you think about it?<br />
PH. I thinkc the 26 January is a legitimate day of<br />
celebration in Australia and I thinkc the more important issue<br />
is though these questions of reconciliation with the<br />
Aboriginal community, that is it should be that all<br />
Australians, the first Australians and those of us who have<br />
followed a1l the regard the place as their home and that we<br />
can all see it as our home.<br />
BATTLER: Under federal Labor, you as Treasurer and now<br />
Prime Minister, we have suffered and I don't think you would<br />
disagree with that, post depreassion record unemployment,<br />
correct? PHI Yeu but let me remind you when I became<br />
Treasurer there was six million people in the workforcs,<br />
there's eight million today, that's a quarter bigger. Nowv<br />
Zealand which you hear about across the water from Dr Heweon<br />
and his pals ham fewer people in work today than they had in<br />
1983. We have got 264 more people in work today than we had<br />
in 1983. Now unem~ ployment is high, too high and we have got<br />
to got it down but we have kept, the key numbers are these.<br />
In the 80s we created 1.75 million jobs, in the last three<br />
years we have lost 300,000 ot them so we have gone 1.75<br />
million is now just under 1.5 million.<br />
SATTLERs we can't keep up at the moment can we?<br />
PHI What's happening is we are going through slower<br />
growth and also a productivity binge. I mean companies are<br />
getting more output from fewer people. The economy is now so<br />
efficient and companies by and large are so stripped down that<br />
they are getting the same or more output from a smaller<br />
workcforce. N~ ow all that means is we have to actually have<br />
more growth and more activity so that even more output comes<br />
from the economy so we will start to rehire people and we are<br />
reaching the stage where companies won't be able to wring Any<br />
more, squeeze any more jui. ce from th. e lemon,, that is they<br />
won't be able to get more output from the same workcfore and<br />
they will start to have to rehire. Now the economy has been<br />
growing SATTLERt You are pai~ nting a picture of them almost<br />
beating them to work harder.<br />
TEL </p>
<p>TEL<br />
11 P no what's happened is we have had a big<br />
risle in productivity. Now what that means inu we are getting<br />
more output from fewer people so that's good but it's not good<br />
tor employment so to make it good for employment we have got<br />
to get more growth again. we Are growing at the moment faster<br />
than any other OECDl economy and its. our economy picks up<br />
particularly if the US picks up and we get a bit of help then<br />
we can get back to rates of growth which will see employment<br />
pick up. We did phenomenally well with employment in the<br />
and it's a great pity that we dropped off the pace but the<br />
good thing about it Is we kept most of those jobs and what we<br />
have now got to do is start growing again, growing in<br />
employment again.<br />
BATTLER S John Heweon suggesuted that interostL rate, -may<br />
go up before the federal election. Can you give any<br />
guarantees that they won't?<br />
PMe John Howson has all these predictions which are<br />
always at the national expense. He is saying the exchange<br />
rate we can't affCord to fund Reserve Bank interventions on the<br />
exchange rate. He makes comments about interest rates, all<br />
these things are not designed to produce confidence in<br />
financial marketis and frankly I don't think there is much<br />
benefit in political leaders making thos sorta of claims.<br />
BATTLERi I know you can't tell uas that you think<br />
interest rates are going to to down but can you give any<br />
guarantee that it won't go up before the federal election?<br />
PM8 I am not giving guarantee. on radio stations<br />
about interest rates, It's just a wrong place, we run<br />
monetary policy in this country between the Government and the<br />
Reserve bank under an Act of Parliament the R9serve Bank Act<br />
which requires a government and the bank to agree and I don't<br />
make pronouncements about rates without speaking to the<br />
Governor. SATTLZR# Will they stay the same?<br />
PM: It's not for me to say. We have got inflation<br />
low that's the main thing. The main reason that interest<br />
rates are down to these levels, bill rates of 6.75t is because<br />
we have got low inflation and low inflation<br />
SATTLERt We have got that because people can't afford to<br />
buy what they used to be able to.<br />
PM, We have got low inf lation and we ar. 4 going to<br />
k: n ai t t took us2 years to break the back of inf lation<br />
we ve otit's bakbroken and now if we keep it's back<br />
broken we can keep lower interest rates.<br />
SATTLERi Go out as far as you can, when are you going to<br />
let us know about the federal poll because that can create<br />
T2EL.: Jan. 93 19: 40 No. 052 F. 11/ 12 </p>
<p>TEL: 27. Jan. 93 19: 40 No. 052 P. 12/ I1<br />
12.<br />
8ATTLURs ( Cont'd) uncertainty. What's the last time you will<br />
be able to tell us there in going to be a federal poll?<br />
PX: I think the Parliament can meet three years<br />
after it first met in the ensuing Parliament, that puts I<br />
think an election needs to be held around the first week or so<br />
of May.<br />
BATTLERs You don't want it that late do you?<br />
PM. rt's a matter of what the Government thinks is<br />
fair and reasonable.<br />
SATTLER: No, it's a matter of what you think.<br />
PM: More particularly, all of us in fact.<br />
SATTERi You can't just sort of wake up one morning and<br />
may I'll have an election today.<br />
PMI No, I pick up cues from the electorate and the<br />
cabinet and in this system the Prime Minister has discretion<br />
over the election and<br />
SATTLERs Could you win if you called it now?<br />
PM: I think we have a very good chance of winning,<br />
yes. SATTLERs At least even money?<br />
PM: At least, at least even money. I mean the<br />
polls say we are in front.<br />
SATTLER: May be it's time to go.<br />
PM: We are a reasonable chance. I mean Dr Xewson<br />
was telling everybody last year we were going to have an<br />
election in March, then we were going to have an election in<br />
June, then we were going to have an election at the Budget,<br />
then we were having an election in November, an election<br />
before Christmas, so the best thing you can do is the three<br />
years SATTLERs Why didn't he give you a call?<br />
PMI The three years come around In March. The<br />
Government was elected in March ' 90 so the three years in<br />
March but the Parliament runs until May, so the short answer<br />
is between now and May.<br />
