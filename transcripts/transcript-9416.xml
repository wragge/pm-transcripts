TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
DOORSTOP AT FAIRBAIRN ON DEPARTURE FOR JAKARTA<br />
SUNDAY 13 NOVEMBER 1994<br />
PMV: This is, I think, an historic opportunity for the region, this meeting of<br />
APEC. It represents half the world's production and half the world's<br />
population the whole of the Pacific rim and it has never been<br />
organised before with anything like a free trade agenda. So, with this<br />
adoption of these objectives APEC would become an institutional ised<br />
force for freer trade in the area. And upon the adoption of these<br />
proposals it would give Australia a seat at the largest table it has ever<br />
sat at because we have never been part of any area dedicated to free<br />
trade, we have always been on our own. So, that is what we are<br />
hoping from this meeting, that President Soeharto's draft declaration<br />
will be adopted and then in subsequent meetings we can get on to<br />
working out how and when we put these things into effect.<br />
J: ( inaudible Optimistic?)<br />
PMV: Well I think so. I think there are very good feelings about it. You can't<br />
hope to span an area like the United States, Japan, China, South East<br />
Asia, and have everyone agreeing to every dot point. But I think most<br />
people take the view that they have got to give something to get<br />
something and that there is a greater good to be served here, so I am<br />
reasonably optimistic about it.<br />
J: ( inaudible what will it mean to Australia?)<br />
PMV: It will mean multiples of what the Uruguay Round meant for us, and I<br />
gave some of the figures on Friday.<br />
J: Mr Downer faces an important party room meeting on Tuesday how<br />
much longer do you think he'll last?<br />
PMV: Well I hope the Liberals don't do anything rash while I am away. I<br />
always like to be in town when they get up to their tricks. And I want to<br />
concentrate on the events at hand in Bogor, in Indonesia. So they<br />
should think of the country and not provide any distractions.<br />
