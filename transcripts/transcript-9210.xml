PRIME MINISTER 40/ 94<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
VISIT TO AUSTRALIA BY US PRESIDENTIAL REPRESENTATIVE<br />
I am pleased to announce that Mr Jack H Watson Jr will visit Australia from<br />
4-9 May as the personal representative of President Clinton during Australia-<br />
America Friendship Week. Mr Watson is a lawyer. He was Cabinet<br />
Secretary in the Carter Administration and is an adviser to President Clinton.<br />
Mr Watson will participate in various activities in Canberra and Hobart to<br />
commemorate the 52nd anniversary of the Battle of the Coral Sea as a guest<br />
of the Australian Government. He will also hold discussions on Australia-<br />
United States relations with senior members of the Government.<br />
The Battle of the Coral Sea, fought in May 1942, was a turning point of the<br />
war in the South Pacific and laid the foundations for the Australian-American<br />
alliance. The close cooperation between Australia and the United States,<br />
based on the strong bonds forged during that conflict, continues over fifty<br />
years later. The alliance between our two countries retains its relevance and<br />
strength in these very different times.<br />
