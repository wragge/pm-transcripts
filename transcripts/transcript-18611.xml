More than $1 billion in household assistance payments has been delivered to about 5 million Australian families and pensioners since the roll out began almost a month ago.</p>
<p>The Gillard Government is delivering household assistance to help people on low and middle incomes make ends meet.</p>
<p>The latest round of household assistance payments  -  advances of up to $190 for eligible students  -  will be rolled out from today, ahead of the carbon price introduction on 1 July.</p>
<p>Many students who rely on Youth Allowance can expect to be well ahead, given that the carbon price is expected to have an impact of $117 per year on their living costs.</p>
<p>More than 315,000 students on Youth Allowance, Austudy or ABSTUDY will share in $52 million in payments over the coming fortnight, with the payments to be paid straight into their bank accounts.</p>
<p>Students are also set to benefit from tax cuts starting on 1 July.</p>
<p> * 	All workers earning less than $80,000 a year will get a tax cut.<br />
 * 	A young person in part-time work earning $20,000 will get a tax cut of up to $600; and<br />
 * 	Students earning $18,200 or less will get to keep all of the money they earn through work and won't need to fill out a tax return, because the tax-free threshold will triple to $18,200.</p>
<p>And from March 2013, the Government will deliver a new Supplementary Allowance to people on payments such as Youth Allowance and Newstart to spread the benefits of the boom. This will mean an annual increase of $210 for singles and $350 for couples.</p>
<p>Later this week more than 200,000 veterans and war widows will receive a household assistance advance payment of up to $250 for singles or $380 for couples combined.</p>
<p>And on 25 June, 281,000self-funded retirees who hold a Commonwealth Seniors Health Card and receive the Seniors Supplement, will also receive an advance payment of $250 for singles or $380 for couples combined.</p>
<p>This advance will be paid along with their quarterly Seniors Supplement, which assists with paying regular bills such as power, rates, phone and car registration.</p>
