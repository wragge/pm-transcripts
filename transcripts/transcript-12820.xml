I am pleased to announce today Australia will host APEC in 2007 after our offer was supported by all of Australia';s regional partners.<br />
As host, Australia will be responsible for arranging the annual Leaders'; Meeting and a range of Ministerial, business and officials'; meetings throughout the year.<br />
Since APEC began its current practice of annual Leaders'; meetings in 1993, the host country role has rotated among regional countries.  Australia has not previously hosted APEC meetings at Leaders'; level but has always played a committed and positive role in APEC, including convening the first APEC Ministers'; meeting in 1989.<br />
Hosting APEC in 2007 is important for Australia on the world scene and will be a worthy successor to the Olympic Games, CHOGM, the Rugby World Cup and the Melbourne Commonwealth Games as a major international event.<br />
We look forward to the opportunity to showcase Australia to APEC Leaders, while pushing forward with APEC';s important work opening markets for Australian exports. </p>
