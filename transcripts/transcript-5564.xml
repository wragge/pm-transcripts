EMBARGO: 6.3OPM<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA MONDAY, APRIL. 6 1981<br />
SPEECH IN SUPPORT OF WENTWORTH CANDIDATE<br />
I have no doubt that the voters in the Division of Wentworth<br />
will show next Saturday that Peter Coleman has their support<br />
as well as mine and yours.<br />
S Peter Coleman will bring to Canberra a strong voice to<br />
support the kind of government that the people of Wentworth<br />
want. He is a-man of unusually wide experience. He has<br />
been closely involved in the legal, cultural, educational<br />
and Journalistic worlds. Wide experience like his is valuable<br />
in government, and it is important that Members of Parliament<br />
should be able-to bring broad perspective and informed<br />
judgments to bear on the issues that come before them.<br />
In addition to this, Peter Coleman knows the political world<br />
well. He served in the New South Wales Parliament for ten<br />
years as a backbencher, as a minister and as Leader of the<br />
New South Wales Parliamentary Liberal Party. I look forward<br />
to his. joining the Liberal team in Canberra just as soon as<br />
there has been time for the poll to be declared.<br />
Since the last election, the Government has been active to<br />
ensure that we keep well on track with the sort of government<br />
that Australia and Australians want with the kind of government<br />
this electorate wants.<br />
The Liberal Government has a clear and practical vision of the<br />
future well-being of the Australian community, not just a<br />
section of the community, but everyone, not just narrow<br />
economic well-being, but a way of life in a free society<br />
in which there, are opportunities for all, in which all people<br />
have the confidence and security to grasp opportunities,<br />
and live their own lives after their own fashion.<br />
This Liberal vision is unique in Australian politics, and it<br />
is in harmony with the aspirations of most Australians. No<br />
other party has a clear vision of the future of this country<br />
or an effective concern for the well-being of the Australian<br />
community in its entirety.<br />
Look at the Labor Party. What does Labor offer this country?<br />
Wthout doubt, Labor wants a Socialist Australia. But Labor<br />
is otale-or not willing to tell Australia what its<br />
version of Socialism means.: The reality-is that Socialism is / 2 </p>
<p>-2<br />
not only a divisive doctrine it means big bureaucracy, big<br />
spending, higher taxes, and over-regulation.<br />
Labor knows that Australia does not want Socialism, that<br />
Socialism cannot be made attractive to Australians. Andone<br />
Labor Senator has said, to the extent that the Socialism<br />
of theF-Labor platform can be implemented, it is ' electoral<br />
dynamite'. Yet Labor continues to retain Socialism as the heart and the<br />
basis of their policy, and the Leader of the Opposition keeps<br />
affirming his commitment to Socialism.. He says-that Labor<br />
politics need to be guided by what he calls the ' egalitarian.<br />
and internatibnal principals of democratic Socialism'.<br />
All of thisis an absurd spectacle in a major party in<br />
this country. The plain fact is that the Labor Party is<br />
barren in ideas. It-. is empty of ideals that are relevant to<br />
Australia's circumstances and to the aspirations of Australians.<br />
The Liberal Party is the . only party thatknows where it is<br />
going. We are the only party with a clear view of the way<br />
to build the kind of Australia that theigreat majority of<br />
Australians want.<br />
In building for the future, we are well aware, as I am sure<br />
the electors of Wentworth are aware, that good economic<br />
management is absolutely crucial. Without a strong economy,<br />
every other success turns sour. A government that fails in this<br />
fails Australia fundamentally.<br />
The Liberal Government has not forgotten the lessons of the<br />
last ten years. We have not forgotten how quickly Labor<br />
ran the economy down or how hard it has been to build it<br />
up again. we are well aware that we must continue to rein in<br />
government expenditure, bring inflation down still further,<br />
encourage investment and growth and thus increase employment.<br />
This basic strategy is still the right one. We embarked upon<br />
it five years ago when we came to office, and its dividends<br />
are becoming increasingly obvious. We have demonstrated<br />
decisively that we can deliver the goods, as decisively as<br />
Labor demonstrated that it can only deliver economic chaos.<br />
Over the~ last five years, the growth of Commonwealth Government<br />
spending through the budget has been held to an average<br />
annual rate of about 1% in real terms. The average rate under<br />
Labor was 10%. Our restraint has been a remarkable achievement,<br />
and we are determined to keep it up. Inflation has been brought<br />
under control by this Government. In the year to last December<br />
it was down at And let me repeat that we shall not<br />
let up in the fight against inflation.<br />
The encouragement we have given to investment has borneamazing<br />
fruit. $ 33 billion is committed or * At the final<br />
feasibility stage in mining and manufacturing alone. Consumer<br />
confidence has-also been restored. For the three months to<br />
February retail sales were almost 15% higher than a year<br />
earlier. And the OECD predicts a 4% growth rate in Australia<br />
for 1981, against a 1% average in the OECD. I believe it : is ./ 3 </p>
<p>-3-<br />
to our great credit that although we have a small economy<br />
by world standards, we have swum against'the tide. And it<br />
has done us good not harm, as the doom merchants in the<br />
Labor Party predicted. Mr Hayden's 1978 prediction that the<br />
1980~ s would be a decade of gloom seemed absurd at the timeand<br />
how much more absurd it now is.<br />
Employment growth has always been an integral part of our<br />
total ' economic approach. More than quarter of a million<br />
new jobs have been created in the last two years, more<br />
than 116POQ in New South Wales. Employment opportunities<br />
grew more rapidly in Australia in 1980 than in the United States,<br />
the United Kingdom, Germany or Japan. None of this is accideital.<br />
It all comes from the firm, consistent and sustained applications<br />
of Liberal policies. The gaiins which we have achieved establish<br />
a strong base for economic recovery. It is now plain to see<br />
that economic recovery is spreading right across this country<br />
7 in manufacturing as well as in resources. This recovery<br />
* is already bringing -and will continue to bring -steadily<br />
increasing prosperity for all Australians.<br />
Let me say, however,-. that the present period is critically<br />
important in ensuring that the benefits of growth are not<br />
thrown away. It always happens, when things start to go<br />
well, that some people push relentlessly for themselves,<br />
wanting too much, too quickly, caring nothing about others.<br />
Australia cannot afford the strikes we are experiencing or<br />
the 35 hour week campaign or the relentless wage pushes that<br />
are going on.<br />
The Government stands for the better future of this country<br />
as a whole.-and for the just claims of young people in<br />
particular for employment opportunities. we have made plain<br />
our resolve-~ to resist threats to economic recovery. I have<br />
no doubt that the voters in-Wentworth like voters throughout.<br />
Australia, want their government to be willing to take a<br />
strong stand, when necessary, to protect the public good.<br />
I have no doubt that the country is behind us in our moves<br />
to de-register the BLF, just as the country was behind us in<br />
the Qantas dispute, and when we brought in the RAAF to fly<br />
home stranded passengers from overseas.<br />
The Government will act and act strongly when sectional<br />
interests threaten-the -overa-ll1 well-being-of the-community.<br />
The Liberal. Party asks.. yo-u. to,. give practical expression, in<br />
Saturday's election, to your support for this approach.<br />
The Government also seeks your support in its call for<br />
acceptance by all people for their responsibilities. to their<br />
fellow Australians. We all know that voluntary acceptance of<br />
But the Government will step in if it must in order to deal<br />
with threats to economic recovery. .14 </p>
<p>-4<br />
in a similar way, it has been forced to step in to deal with<br />
various anti-social tax avoidance schemes. Labor did nothing about<br />
tax avoidance when they were in office. Now they say they will cut<br />
it out. That is easy to say but it not so easy to find a<br />
practical way to catch the guilty without harming the innocent.<br />
The plain fact is that no government has taken such a strong<br />
stand, ' nor such a fair stand, against tax avoidance as has<br />
the Liberal Government, and we shall continue to do so. But<br />
let me also say this, if every piece of anti-social behaviour,<br />
whether strikes or tax avoidance or whatever, has to be<br />
proscribed by law, then we shall be overwhelmed by laws.<br />
Reasonable people in a co-operative community are willing to<br />
accept-their obligations to others, we must never allow the<br />
divisive and selfish forces within our community to get the<br />
upper hand, or the basis of freedom may be undermined. A.<br />
free society must be based on attitudes of mutual respect<br />
between people,' and upon acceptance of moral responsibility<br />
without recourse to law at e'Cery point.<br />
We are all Australians, and we want the Australian way of life<br />
to continue, this means that we must accept our community<br />
obligations. Since the last election, the Government has taken<br />
a major step to ensure that its own house is in order and a<br />
massive review of the.-. functions and activities of the<br />
Commonwealth is now almost complete. TIhe review committee,<br />
headed by Sir Phillip Lynch, has been nicknamed the razor<br />
gang, and I think that most people see the review as nothing<br />
more than a cost-cutting exercise. In fact, it is far more than<br />
that, far more. It will lead to expenditure cuts, and these<br />
cuts will be significant and useful, but these cuts are<br />
incidental to the main purpose of the review.<br />
The essential role of this major review has been to ensure that<br />
the Commonwealth bureaucracy is not allowed to grow like<br />
Topsy, and that the Commonwealth is not distracted from its<br />
proper tasks by a needless duplication of tasks which<br />
are more appropriately handled by private functions are<br />
effectively-and economically discharged. The R. C. F Report<br />
will be finalised and acted upon within the next few weeks<br />
and this will make plain our commitment to Government that<br />
is limited and restrained, but also firm and effective.<br />
In case there is any misunderstanding, let me make it clear0<br />
that the R. C. F. does not seek cut-backs for the sake of cut-backs,<br />
at the expense of effectiveness, in functions that belong<br />
to the Commonwealth. The review is concerned to achieve<br />
the twin goals of effectiveness and economy in the functioning<br />
of the Commonwealth.<br />
In social security,-for example, the Government remains<br />
absolutely committed to making sure that support and assistance<br />
will be available to those who need it. Australians are a<br />
generous people, and they rightly insist ' that Governments<br />
make good provision for pensioners and disadvantaged. The<br />
present Government is not a big spending Government, but<br />
neither is it a small spending Government in the help<br />
it gives to theelderly, the sick and disabled. During the<br />
period of this Government pensions have stood at higher levels<br />
in relation to average weekly earnings than at any time in the<br />
last 25 years. We are now spending over $ 1 billion on overall<br />
assistance to the handicapped, a substantial real increase in </p>
<p>the-amnount of five years ago. Liberals-act in these areas,<br />
while others just talk, and for our partE,' we will continue<br />
to act.<br />
I want to emphasise that small and limi-ted Government bears<br />
no relationship to mean and ungenerous Government. On the contrary,<br />
by producing a strong and growing economy, limited Government<br />
provides the only foundation for the kind of social security.<br />
arrangements that Australians want. Economic growth is<br />
equally the foundation for pulling tax rates further back.<br />
Through our restraints on expenditure, we have-made<br />
substantial inroads on marginal tax rates. Since we came..*<br />
to office, we have cut the marginal tax rate on the<br />
average wage earner from 44 cents in the dollar under Labor<br />
to the present rate of 32 cents, and the highest rate has come<br />
down from 65 cents in the dollar to 60 cents. But the real<br />
basis for tax cuts lies in economic growth and increasing<br />

Overall, then, there is room for tremendous optimism about<br />
Australia. Provided that we act together as one people,<br />
our future looks magnificent. I only wish that other countries<br />
possessedthe stability and the prospects, the freedom<br />
and opportunities, which we have in Australia. I do not<br />
have time to talk of these matters tonight, but there are<br />
considerable uncertainties abroad at this time. Look at<br />
Poland, or El Salvador, or Afghanistan. There are<br />
de-stabilising influences ready to take advantage of any<br />
opportunities that arise. I said in Parliament last<br />
week that the world would not be the same again if the<br />
Soviet Union moved to-an invasion of Poland. I just<br />
mention these things because we are not insulated from<br />
world events in this country.<br />
And I want to take this opportunity-t6 say how pleased Australianscan<br />
be at the success of our recent negotiations with the<br />
United States on B-52' s staging through Darwin for training<br />
and surveillance flights. The negotiations have established an<br />
extremely good relationship between the Australian Government<br />
and the Reagan administration in the United States. This<br />
relationship is vitally important to Australia. It forms<br />
part of a good overall picture for Australia's future.<br />
. As-. Australia-. embarkson. anewage of growth and.-development,<br />
we must keep clearly in view what we want from Government in<br />
the 1980' s and beyond. The goals of the Liberal Party<br />
in Government are clear. They are a strong, growing and securea<br />
Australia; an Australia united in a commitment to solving<br />
problems by co-operation, not confrontation; a competitive<br />
Australia which can hold its own in an increasingly competitive<br />
world, an Australia in which individual people can build<br />
the kind of lives they want for themselves and their families,<br />
not an Australia dominated by bureaucrats and politicians. ./ 6 </p>
<p>-6-<br />
We stand for the right of people to choose for themselves<br />
and for the opportunities which give meaning to that freedom.<br />
of choice. We stand for an Australia in which people recognise<br />
their moral responsibilities to the best of the community, a<br />
nation which is morally and spiritually, as well as materially,<br />
strong.<br />
On Saturday, when the electors of Wentworth weigh up the<br />
candidates and their parties in this by-election, there is<br />
only one choice.<br />
A vote for Peter Coleman and the Liberal Government is the<br />
right vote on every score, on every issue. 0<br />
