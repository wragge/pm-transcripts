I am pleased to announce that Mitsubishi Motors Corporation has accepted a $35 million offer of assistance from the Commonwealth Government.  This assistance will facilitate a major new investment in Mitsubishi';s Adelaide plant and the establishment of a global research and development centre in South Australia.<br />
The Commonwealth';s decision reflects the important role Mitsubishi plays in the South Australian economy and Mitsubishi';s commitment to make Adelaide an integral part of its global operations, including through the research and development facility.<br />
The Commonwealth';s additional $35 million of assistance will be available from 2004-05 and will be contingent on Mitsubishi meeting specific commitments on the timing and scale of its investment.<br />
In particular, the assistance is conditional on the creation of an additional 900 direct jobs in Mitsubishi';s Adelaide manufacturing operations and the establishment of a global research and development centre in South Australia with ongoing employment of approximately 300 people.<br />
The upgrade of Mitsubishi';s Adelaide manufacturing facilities will facilitate the production of two new models from 2005, including a new generation Magna and a luxury long wheelbase version.<br />
The Commonwealth assistance announced today is in addition to the more than $200 million Mitsubishi is expected to receive from the government';s Automotive Competitiveness and Investment Scheme to 2005.  The South Australian Government will also provide $50 million in cash and â€˜in kind'; assistance to Mitsubishi to facilitate this investment.<br />
Mitsubishi';s decision to continue manufacturing in Australia will be welcomed by the company';s 3,200 strong Australian workforce.  The decision to undertake a substantial new investment in Australia also reflects the company';s confidence in the Australian automotive industry and the effectiveness of the Government';s economic and industry policies.</p>
