MEDIA TRANSCRIPT<br />
Prime Minister the Hon. John Howard MP, ADDRESS AT CANBERRA<br />
BUSINESS COMMUNITY DINNER<br />
13 December 1996<br />
E&amp; OE T hank you very much Mr Denis Paige, the Chairman of the Canberra Business Council; to<br />
Mrs Kate Carnell, the Chief Minister of the ACT; to my ministerial colleague Warwick<br />
Smith; Andrew Whitecross, the Leader of the Opposition; Ministers in the ACT<br />
Government, Tony Dedomenico, Gary Humphries and Bill Woods; to my parliamentary<br />
colleague Gary Nairn, the federal member for Eden Monaro; to the mayor of the Tumut<br />
Shire Council, Mr Geoff Pritchard and to David Evans, the recently appointed and new<br />
Chairman of the National Capital Authority, ladies and gentlemen.<br />
I am particularly pleased to be here tonight to acknowledge the presence of such a big<br />
cross section of the community of the Canberra region and to take the opportunity of<br />
saying very directly to you a few things about the attitude of the Federal Government<br />
towards the Canberra region.<br />
I amn releasing tonight a vision or mission statement about the attitude of the federal<br />
Government to the Canberra region and my remarks will be built around some of the<br />
things that are contained in that statement but will also contain some specific<br />
announcements which are not canvassed is such detail in the statement. 1 want to say very<br />
directly to you that the Federal Government remains absolutely committed to the special<br />
role of Canberra and the Canberra region as the location of the national capital of our<br />
nation, and because of that there are a number of particular things which we regard as<br />
ongoing commitments and obligations. And I speak as a Coalition Prime Minister,<br />
conscious, and I don't say this in any carping sense, of the contributions of Labor<br />
Governments to Canberra but I am very conscious of the history of Coalition<br />
Governments and their contribution to the development of Canberra. The particular role<br />
played by Sir Robert Menzies as a Coalition Prime Minister in really laying the<br />
foundations of modern Canberra, the establishment of the forerunner of the national<br />
Capital Authority by the Fraser Government, the establishment also of the Australian<br />
Institute of Sport;, the Australian Defence Academy; the High Court building and the<br />
National Gallery, all of those projects were essentially initiated by and established under<br />
Coalition Governments.<br />
I don't come as a political pauper in any sort of you know descended sense, so far as the<br />
Coalition is concerned it is an Australian gathering, I come as somebody who is in a<br />
particular tradition. Now I recognise that the decisions that we have taken have had a<br />
disproportionately large impact on the Canberra community. I know that, I acknowledge<br />
that, I don't mince words on that, I'm sorry about that, and it is important that it be<br />
understood that those decisions weren't taken in any punitive sense against the Canberra<br />
community. They weren't taken because the Federal Government dislikes public servants<br />
that's nonsense. Anybody who pokes fun at the public service doesn't understand the<br />
important role the public service plays in the fabric of our country and particularly in the<br />
life of the Canberra community.<br />
But we did have a problem, I don't want to go over all of that, you've heard the debate,<br />
I of 51 f 501/ 1170/: 9587: 44 </p>
<p>PM-Can erraBusne.. ityDninlear,. g3o. v1.. a9u6/ phmttpc:/ p// rwewsswre. l/ cbc. htmi<br />
but I want you to understand the context in which those decisions were taken. We do<br />
attach particular importance to the role of the private sector in the Canberra community.<br />
It is true that 48% of employment in the Canberra area is in the public sector which is of<br />
course the highest anywhere in Australia, but that does leave 52% in the private sector<br />
and one of the emphasises as the Chairman said of the new Government has been on the<br />
role of small business. And I think it will only be over the next 12 months that the entire<br />
Australian community and particularly the small business community of Australia will<br />
begin to understand the scale of the changes and begin to experience the benefits of the<br />
changes that we are making in the area of small business. The changes under our<br />
industrial relations legislation for example don't come into operation until the first of<br />
January. As I speak now that silly unfair dismissal law which has discouraged so many<br />
men and women in small business around Australia from taking on new staff, that is still<br />
with us, and it won't be until the first of January that the new and better and fairer law<br />
comes into operation. It won't be until the first of January that small business has greater<br />
freedom and flexibility to arrange workplace bargains that suit their circumstances and the<br />
circumstances of their employees.<br />
And it won't be until July 1 st next year that an absolute tax revolution so far as the<br />
application of the Capital Gains Tax to small business will come into operation and I don't<br />
want anybody in this audience to misunderstand the scale of what we have decided to do<br />
in that area. We've not simply said that you can roll over the proceeds of the sale of one<br />
business into the purchase of another business of a like kind. We've said that up to a limit<br />
of $ 5 million you can roll it over into the purchase now of any kind of business, any other<br />
kind of business without incurring Capital Gains Tax liability, and the impact of that when<br />
it spreads through the community and particularly through the small business community,<br />
and the new law will come into operation on the first of July of next year, we can't afford<br />
to run it any earlier than that because it will be quite an expensive item so far as the<br />
revenue is concerned. I think it will be very popular and I think it will have quite a<br />
liberating effect on small business. And there are many other things that we've done for<br />
small business. We altered the provisional tax uplift factor. I had a report from Mr Charlie<br />
Bell, the Managing Director of McDonalds on cutting red tape on small business, and he<br />
has put forward a number of very in fact 62 specific recomnmendations and I've<br />
promised him a definitive and positive response by the middle of February.<br />
So when you add all those things up, when you add up the knock-on effect for small<br />
business of I believe a rise in investment and investor confidence. I'm appointing to my<br />
staff a major projects facilitator whose role will be to clear away unnecessary hurdles to<br />
government approvals for major projects in Australia. Now, major projects are important<br />
in themselves but they also have great effects for small business. Now, I stress the small<br />
business changes because they are a very important part of our long term strategy and<br />
they have very important affects for the Canberra region and they have particular<br />
relevance to the many people who are in this audience. So, part of our vision, indeed the<br />
fundamental part of our vision for this region is of course an invigoration and expansion<br />
and liberation of the opportunities for small business. And the growth of the private<br />
sector in the region is tremendously important.<br />
Now yesterday Warwick Smith announced the appointment of David Evans as<br />
Chairman of the National Capital Authority and he brings a wealth of experience to the<br />
job, he brings particular knowledge of the area, his administrative and leadership role in<br />
the RAAF ideally suits him for this kind of job and Warwick Smith has confirmed that the<br />
Coalition will amend the ACT planning and land management act during our current term<br />
to remove the current legislative barriers to perpetual leases. 2 f 501/ 17/ 97 10: 58: 46<br />

The final decision on if and when to introduce the new lease hold system is of course<br />
something that rests with Mrs Carnell's government, and that decision will be a particular<br />
benefit I believe to Canberra's business community as it will improve investor confidence<br />
and therefore lead I hope to more jobs in Canberra. Now, the public service will remain a<br />
major part of the life and the economy of Canberra and although there has been a<br />
downsizing the federal public service, which I have to say in a sense matches the<br />
downsizing that has occurred some years earlier in a number of the State public services<br />
and perhaps we've done it in a rather more overt fashion than some of the actions of our<br />
predecessors because there was a significant reduction in the number of people employed<br />
in the federal public service under the actions of our predecessors.<br />
We are increasing opportunities for the outsourcing of services to Government and they<br />
will be a particular benefit to small business, It's been estimated for example that<br />
initiatives in the administrative services portfolio alone could generate up to 2,500 jobs in<br />
the private sector. And right at the moment we are examining ways to facilitate greater<br />
access for small business to outsourcing opportunities. And as a result of the round table<br />
with local business and Government officials yesterday it's been agreed that the business<br />
community will be connected in the preparation and development of guidelines to deal<br />
with the outsourcing of Government services.<br />
That brings me, Mr Chairman, to the issue of the National Museum. You will remember<br />
that during the election campaign I made a commitment to the establishment of the<br />
National Museum of Australia and the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait<br />
Islander studies. I made that commitment during the Canberra by-election in 1995. It was<br />
reaffirmed by me during the Federal election campaign and tonight I say that the<br />
Government stands solidly behind that commitment. As a first step we provided<br />
million in the 1996-97 Budget for the National Museum Committee to investigate side<br />
options. The committee has reported and has recommended that the Museum be located<br />
at Acton Peninsula. And I announce tonight that the Commonwealth will accept the<br />
Committee's recommendation. The National Museum and the Institute will be major<br />
national cultural institutions which will service permanent repositories of Australia's rich<br />
heritage and culture. Now, I recognise that there's been some debate in the community<br />
about where the Museum should be located and not everybody will agree with the<br />
recommendation of the Committee nor with the Government's decision. But I think the<br />
essence here is to get on with it. The essence here is to make decisions and to move<br />
forward. Now we're going to announce, as we probably should, funding details in the next budget.<br />
But as a down payment on further work and as a earnest of where we stand and what we<br />
think, the Commonwealth will allocate three quarters of a million dollars for a<br />
development brief to commence in January 1997. Can I also say that we will continue<br />
with the refurbishment of the Old Parliament House, the Australian War Memorial, as<br />
well as the extension for the National Gallery.<br />
Now, we recognise the great importance of infrastructure for this region. And it is for that<br />
reason that I announced last week that the Commonwealth, the New South Wales and the<br />
ACT Government's will shortly call for expressions of interest in the provision of the high<br />
speed train service between Canberra and Sydney. We take a positive attitude to the<br />
private sector development of this proposal. There will be a competitive tender process<br />
and the Commonwealth will play its role as a member of the Project Control Study<br />
Group. We will facilitate a commercially viable rail service. They know that this project<br />
holds out very positive signs for many people in the region and I hope that the response 01/ 17/ 97 10: 58: 46<br />
PM Canberra Busine ity Dinner, 13.12.96 </p>
<p>PM -CanerraBusne.. ityDiner, 3.1.96http:// www. nia. gov. au/ pmc/ pressrel/ cbc. htmi<br />
of the private sector is a very fulsome and positive one.<br />
We also recognise the potential for expanding the role of Canberra airport so that it can<br />
better serve the needs of the region. The Federal Airports' Corporation is examining the<br />
feasibility of upgrading Canberra airport to international status which could, for example,<br />
facilitate direct flights between the region and major export markets into the Asia-Pacific<br />
area. This could be of particular benefit to local primary producers who want to develop<br />
niche markets in the Asia-Pacific region. I believe very strongly that the future of the<br />
region will be assured once major stakeholders accept that a new model of development is<br />
needed to guide it into the next century.<br />
I want to commend the Canberra business community for responding in a positive, even<br />
aggressive fashion to the challenges that have been presented over the past few months,<br />
and exploring ways of embracing a new approach. The way in which the various members<br />
of the Canberra business community have come together at such short notice tonight, the<br />
evident commitment of so many of the people involved in that community to Canberra's<br />
future; a desire not to look back over the shoulder in recrimination about what may have<br />
gone before but rather to recognise that changed circumstances present new opportunities<br />
as well as new challenges is a very encouraging development.<br />
As I said at the beginning of my remarks, I am very cognisant of the impact of some of<br />
our decisions on this region. Those decisions were necessary in the national interest, they<br />
were not taken lightly. I regret the personal difficulty that some of them have caused to<br />
many of my fellow Australians. I do not lead a Government which is a public service<br />
basher. I lead a Government that believes very strongly in the private sector, particularly<br />
in the small business sector. I have a deep personal and philosophical commitment to<br />
small business. I believe it is the engine room offu ture economic growth in Australia. I<br />
believe it is the sector which over time and I stress over time can provide the answer to<br />
our employment difficulties. But there is an important role for a professional and highly<br />
motivated and highly committed public service in Australia and it has a special role here in<br />
Canberra. And there is also a special place for Canberra in the life of Australia as its<br />
National Capital. It is a source of very great pride to me, the city of Canberra. It is a<br />
source of very great pride to all Australians. There is obviously debate around Australia<br />
about the size, the role and the shape of federal vis a vis State and municipal government.<br />
But that is part and parcel of the normal ebb and flow of political debate.<br />
But I do want to assure all of you that my Government remains, as former Coalition<br />
governments have been and demonstrated, very deeply committed to the welfare of the<br />
Canberra region, very deeply committed to the people of Canberra. Anid I've endeavored<br />
tonight, with some of thle announcements that I have made, to indicate thle measure of<br />
that commitment. I can't promise that I will agree with everything that is put to me by the<br />
ACT Government or by the Canberra business community. But I can promise both the<br />
Government and the business community a very frank and regular communication and<br />
dialogue, a willingness to listen, a willingness to accede to reasonable requests that are<br />
clearly in the interests of the region and consistent with Government policy. And I hope<br />
that the announcements that I've made in relation to the speed rail project, to the possible<br />
extension of Canberra airport and in relation to the National Museum, coupled those<br />
things with our very strong generic commitment to small business, will represent a<br />
demnonstration of our commitment to you and our desire to see a very bright and<br />
prosperous future for the people of the Canberra region.<br />
Thank you very much. 4 f 501/ 17/ 97 10: 58: 47<br />
