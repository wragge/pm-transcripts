The meeting was chaired by H. E. Dato Seri Dr. Mahathir Bin Mohamad,<br />
Leader of the ASEAN delegation.<br />
H. E. Datuk Ali Bin Abdullah, Secretary-General of the ASEAN<br />
Secretariat was also present.<br />
The ASEAN Ministers reiterated the ASEAN common stand adopted<br />
at the Seventh ASEAN Economic Ministers Meeting on 12-13 December<br />
1978 and the special ASEAN Economic Ministers Meeting on 22 February<br />
1979. The Australian ministers outlined the philosophy and objectives<br />
of the new Australian International Civil Aviation Policy. They<br />
explained particularly its objective of providing the<br />
lowest possible fares for international travellers. They emphasised<br />
that it was the policy and intention of the Australian Government<br />
that the ASEAN countries should share equitably in the benefits<br />
of the new scheme.<br />
The Ministers addressed the principles set out in the ASEAN joint<br />
statement of 22 February and agreed courses of action that would be<br />
taken on these. </p>
<p>2<br />
With regard to participation by ASEAN carriers in the Australia-UK/<br />
Europe low fare scheme, Ministers agreed that further studies<br />
were needed on this subject.<br />
Concerning the level of a stopover fare on the Australia-UK/ Europe<br />
route, Ministers agreed that further work was also required on<br />
this matter with a view to proposals being developed on an appropriate<br />
fare level.<br />
Ministers directed officials to proceed quickly with further<br />
work on these two matters and to report back to their respective<br />
Ministers within a month.<br />
Ministers agreed in principle on ranges of cheap fares proposed by<br />
the ASEAN Ministers for travel between Australia and ASEAN<br />
countries. They further agreed that these could form the basis<br />
for bilateral negotiations between Australia and each of the ASEAN<br />
countries. Ministers confirmed that such bilateral discussions<br />
would take place without any way affecting the ASEAN collective<br />
approach to this subject.<br />
Ministers agreed that the ASEAN countries would develop proposals<br />
which they would put to Australia in intra-ASEAN stopover fares<br />
to be used in conjunction with the low cost fares between<br />
Australia and the ASEAN region.<br />
The meeting was held in a cordial and constructive atmosphere,<br />
in keeping with the long established tradition of close and<br />
cooperative links between the ASEAN countries and Australia. </p>
