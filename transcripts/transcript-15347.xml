<p>Good morning,</p>
<p>The Federal Government's Budget is in healthy surplus due to the Coalition's economic policies. We have paid off Labor's $96 billion debt, saving taxpayers about $8.5 billion a year in interest payments.</p>
<p>This has allowed us to deliver important social programs, cut taxes and maintain a generous family assistance system.  </p>
<p>It has also relieved pressure on interest rates. When governments borrow money they compete with private borrowers putting upward pressure on interest rates. </p>
<p>While the Federal Government is not in the borrowing marketplace, state Labor Governments are going into deep debt across the nation. Over the five years to 2010-11, state debt will increase by about $70 billion.  </p>
<p>This will place significant upward pressure on interest rates and is a glaring example of Labor's double game with the Australian community. While Federal Labor pretends to be fiscally responsible, state Labor Governments are anything but.</p>
<p>If you want a true insight into how Labor would run the economy nationally, look no further than how Labor runs the state finances.</p>
<p>The national economy is strong courtesy of the Coalition Government. A Rudd Labor Government would put all of that at risk.</p>
