  I am appalled at the repeated and inaccurate assertions by the Leader of the Opposition and the Defence spokesman for the Labor Party that Australia';s military contribution in and around Iraq is merely symbolic.  This is insulting to our personnel who face constant danger in their efforts to bring security and stability to Iraq.  And it is grossly inaccurate.</p>
<p>  To give a specific example, as recently as last Saturday the HMAS Stuart was involved in two incidents in the northern part of the Persian Gulf.</p>
<p>In the first incident the HMAS Stuart was directly involved in rescuing American personnel who had been attacked by a dhow loaded with explosives.  Seven Americans (two dead and five injured) were taken on board the Stuart.  In the second incident the Stuart provided on site command for allied forces when two other terrorists vessels believed to be speedboats attempted to attack Iraqi oil terminals in the Northern Arabian Gulf.</p>
<p>This issue starkly reveals the split in Labor ranks over Iraq.  The more experienced Foreign Affairs spokesman, Kevin Rudd, has praised the role of the ADF and properly said that their role is both important and involves great danger.  By contrast, both Mr Latham and Senator Evans, the Defence spokesman, have effectively belittled the ADF';s contribution.</p>
<p>Mr Rudd is right.  Mr Latham and Senator Evans are completely wrong.  </p>
