    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Government will move to a single regulatory framework for all Australian international airlines.</p>
<p>As soon as possible, legislation will be introduced to remove the foreign ownership restrictions and conditions that apply to Qantas’ business operations contained in Part 3 of the <em>Qantas Sale Act 1992</em>.</p>
<p>Removing these conditions is the best way to ensure Qantas can secure Australian jobs now and into the future.</p>
<p>Australians want a strong and competitive Qantas. The existing <em>Qantas Sale Act 1992</em> places restrictions on Qantas that advantage its competitors.</p>
<p>Like all other Australian international airlines, Qantas will continue to be subject to the <em>Air Navigation Act 1920</em> (ANA). The ANA applies to both Virgin Australia and Jetstar.</p>
<p>The ANA effectively limits total foreign ownership of Australian international airlines to 49 per cent, but does not impose the additional restrictions on business operations that apply to Qantas under the <em>Qantas Sale Act 1992.</em></p>
<p>These changes will provide business flexibility for Qantas consistent with other airlines based in Australia.</p>
<p>Foreign investment will continue to be subject to consideration and approval by the Foreign Investment Review Board.</p>
<p>This is the best policy response to the difficulties currently being faced by Qantas.</p>
<p>Legislation will be finalised and introduced as soon as practicable. Any changes to Qantas’ operations as a result of these changes are a matter for the Qantas board and management.</p>
