F 77/ 140<br />
FOR PRESS 30 JUNE 1977<br />
COMMONWEALTH OMBUDSMAN COMMENCEMENT OF<br />
OPERATIONS<br />
On 17 March 1977 I announced the appointment of Professor J. E.<br />
Richardson, Robert Garran Professor of Law at the Australian<br />
National University, to the position of Commonwealth Ombudsman.<br />
I am pleased to announce that Professor Richardson will take up<br />
his appointment on 1 July 1977 for a period of seven years.<br />
He will be supported by two Deputy Commonwealth Ombudsman who<br />
are expected to be appointed shortly.<br />
The Ombudsman has power to investigate complaints made by<br />
citizens, organisations and associations against the administrative<br />
actions of Commonwealth officials. He may also conduct<br />
investigations on his own initiative. He will be concerned<br />
mainly with the way officials have handled a matter and will<br />
be looking at alleged bias, neglect, delay, incompetence or any<br />
other complaints that can be generally classified as bad<br />
administration. The Ombudsman has power to gain immediate access to documents<br />
or premises and is able to interview officials or anyone else<br />
who may assist in his enquiries. All enquiries are made in<br />
private. If the Ombudsman finds that some remedial action is required in<br />
relation to a complaint, he will make recommendations to the<br />
relevant department and to its Minister. Where in the opinion<br />
of the Ombudsman, appropriate corrective action is not taken,<br />
he may report directly to the Prime Minister and to Parliament.<br />
All complaints to the Ombudsman must be in writing, although he<br />
and his officers may assist citizens to prepare their written<br />
complaints. Eventually, the Ombudsman will have offices in all states.<br />
However, as from 1 July he will be located in the Prudential<br />
Building, corner London Circuit and University Avenue, Canberra<br />
City, postal address P. O. Box 442, Canberra City A. C. T. 2601,<br />
telephone ( 062) 475833. / The </p>
<p>-2-<br />
The establishment of the office of Commonwealth Ombudsman<br />
is one of a number of measures the Government is introducing<br />
to ensure that citizens have adequate avenues of appeal<br />
against administrative actions of officials.<br />
In the field of administrative law, the Commonwealth legislation<br />
so far enacted, and the legislative proposals in train, will<br />
provide the most comprehensive machinery for the redress of<br />
grievances in any jurisdiction in Australia, and it may fairly<br />
be suggested, in any jurisdiction in the common law world. </p>
