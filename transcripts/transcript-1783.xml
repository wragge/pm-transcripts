TELE VISION INTERVIEW GIVEN BY THE<br />
PRIME MINISTER, MR JOHN GORTON ON<br />
GTV9, MELBOURNE<br />
Interviewer Mr Tony Charlton 18TH FEBRUARY, 1968<br />
MR CHARLTON: Facing your electorate for the first time as Prime Minister,<br />
-how do you really feel about it?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well, I hope I will win it.<br />
Q. And you are conifident that you will?<br />
PM: I hope I will,<br />
Q. But has the enormity of the job you sought and won really had<br />
time as yet to register with you.<br />
PM: I think it has. Let us examine the question you asked me<br />
Has the enormity of it had time to impress me? It did the very first moment at<br />
the time I won it. It has been impressing me since I can answer that yes, but<br />
if you say have I sufficiently studied it to know how to overcome all the<br />
problems which make up this en ormity, the answer is No. I doubt if<br />
any Prime Minister ever would reach that position.<br />
Q. I had the feeling, of course, that you could have had no notion<br />
that one day you would become Prime Minister before the Harold Holt<br />
tragedy. Then the race was on, you were involved in it, and maybe only<br />
now you are sitting back and thinking, " Good Heavens, what have I done?"<br />
PM: Oh, I was a volunteer.<br />
And happily so!<br />
Your predecessor, Sir Robert Menzies was critical of the<br />
spectacle of the power struggle that the Prime Ministership became.<br />
How do you feel about it?<br />
PM: Well, I think that is a little bit of a conservative view. Personally,<br />
I think it was not bad that the public should have had the opportunity and<br />
I speak now from a party point of view that it was not bad for the public<br />
to have had the opportunity to see four people appearing before them all<br />
of whom, I think, were good, without any personal attacks the one upon<br />
the other. From my point of view, I can see nothing that was reprehensible<br />
about that. Indeed, as I say, I think it could well have been a good thing.<br />
Of course, ever since 1949 untilS ir Robert retired, he having formed the<br />
Liberal Party, he was outstanding. I really, myself, see nothing to object<br />
to in what happened.<br />
Q. Do you see anything to object to in some of the goings-on with the<br />
opening of your Higgins b y-election campaign? There were a number of<br />
arrests. Does the conduct which brought about that acti'on register with<br />
you as being part of the game, or deep down are you really disturbed by it? / 2 </p>
<p>PM: Well, I have to rely on what I read in the papers this<br />
morning because I didn't see any of the actual occurrences outside<br />
the hall. Certainly there was nothing that I could see to complain<br />
of inside the hall at all. I didn't see what happened outside the hail,<br />
but I think I can answer your question perhaps this way. I think the<br />
people have inalienable rights to co me to public meetings and to<br />
interject and to ask questions. I don't think they have got. an i~ nalienable<br />
right to come in force and make a constant barrage of noise so that the<br />
man on the platform can't put his message to the Australian people<br />
because that seems to me to be interfering with a proper method of<br />
running a democratic country. Similarly outside the hall, or protest<br />
meetings generally groups of people, as I said before, must have,* the<br />
right to protest, but I believe their protests must not be allowed to be<br />
carried to a point where they are in fact using force against people<br />
with whom they disagree, such as trying to overturn cars, throwing<br />
paint bombs, or even lying down in the streets to prevent other citizens<br />
from using them. This is carrying the right to protest into an area<br />
of licence rather xhan right.<br />
Q. And even in the knockabout world of politics, what of the f'aunts<br />
and barbs like " Liar" and " Murderer". Surely they would revile -any<br />
decent man?<br />
PM: Oh, I think you have got to take cogn isance of the quartet<br />
from. which they come, and I am not particularly worried about the.<br />
quarters that have lately been calling me either liar or murderer.<br />
Q. As far as the hubbub your " enough is enough" statement on Viet Nam<br />
has caused, do you feel on reflection that maybe this will be as prominent an<br />
indisctftion as " All the Way with LBJ"?*<br />
PMF' I don't think -the statement which Mr Holt made, and he made<br />
it in a context which I think has been misrepresented, was an indiscretion,<br />
although it has been so used that in the public mind it became to be an<br />
indiscretion. I don't think that what I said was an indiscretion at all.<br />
I believe, as I said last night, that we are making for our size and<br />
considering all our other requirements, a very significan t contribution<br />
in Viet Nam. I believe we are proving ourselves there to be an ally<br />
in the real sense. I believe if we were to acdd 2, 000 or 3, 000 more troops<br />
should we be asked to, or 4, 000 should we be asked to and we haven't<br />
been asked to we would make a very minor additional contribution to<br />
the military operations, but the expense of that, apart from other things,<br />
could have a very major effect on things we would like to do in Australia<br />
itself.<br />
Q. Well, did you make that Canberra statement off the cuff, or as<br />
one would thin k, after considerable thought?<br />
PM: It wasn't a statement. It was in answer to a question at a press<br />
conference. The answer provided was not provided just-sort of out of<br />
the air but because I had thought about it beforehand.<br />
Q. Nonetheless, it seemed to be modified a few days later in Sydney.<br />
Now, was this as a result of indignation on the line from America? / 3 </p>
<p>PM: No, we have heard nothing from America, and with great<br />
respect, I don't think the English language could be so used as to say<br />
the statement was modified. One statement was: We are not going<br />
to increase the forces that we have in Viet Nam. The other statement<br />
was: We are going to maintain the forces we have in Viet Nam for as<br />
long as is necessary to attain our obj ective. Now it doesn't seem to<br />
me that they are in any way-contradictory or that one modifies the<br />
other.<br />
Q. Well, Mr Prime Minister, would it be reasonable to deduce<br />
that what you said, in effect, means that being in Viet Nam is not the<br />
vital be-all and end-all thing that your predecessor believed?<br />
PM: I think that being in Viet Nam * is of immense significance to<br />
us, but I believe that we have so much to do in other areas outside<br />
Australia and inside Australia that we have to balance the overwhelming<br />
importance of being in Viet Nam with more troops against the<br />
overwhelming importance of building our country as quickly as we can in the<br />
time we have.<br />
Q. Can I put it to you this way? Did you mean that we can't do<br />
more in Viet Nam or that we shouldn't do more?<br />
PM: Oh, we could do more. We could do more in Viet Nam. We<br />
could perhaps fill the place that Britain is leaving in Singapore anid<br />
Malaysia, but if we did, we wouldn't be able to do anything else at all..<br />
Q. The point about this line of questioning is: If the cause if<br />
justified, why then stop at a commitment of 8, 000 men or, as you say,<br />
a few hundred more?'*<br />
PM: Because last October I think it was, only a few months ago<br />
we examined the military requirements in Viet Nam from the point of<br />
view of our troops, and considerably increased the forces that were<br />
there. Nowit was worked out that to add another battalion to the two<br />
that were there was not merely increasing its efficiency by one-third.<br />
It was increasing it by a factor much more than that because instead of<br />
having one battalion out and one battalion resting and in reserve, you<br />
could have two battalions out and this could do far more than could be<br />
done previously more than twice as much. This was the military<br />
advice as to what we could do and this is what we did. Now, it would,<br />
of course, be arguable that, all right, Viet Nam is so important let's<br />
send another three battalions up there, but I am saying that I think the<br />
other things we have to do, bearing in mind the significant task we are<br />
fulfilling in Viet Nam, would make a judgment on my part that we are<br />
doing all that can reasonably be expected from a country of our size.<br />
Q. When you underlined your Viet Nam attitude the other night in<br />
the Higgins by-election campaign opening, were you aware then that<br />
America would throw a further 10, 000 troops into the Viet Nam conflict?<br />
PM: No, I wasn't. No. / 4 </p>
<p>Q. Isn't it extraordinary that the Australian Prime Minister<br />
wouldn't be advisedjin advance of such a step by our ally?<br />
PM: Why? I don't think so. I can'. t imagine that the United States<br />
would need to inform a Prime Minister of another country that it was<br />
inceasngfrces that were already there. It may well be thAt on<br />
military iscussions this was made known but I can't see any necessity<br />
for it to have been made known.<br />
PM: Overall, do you see Viet Nam as being something of a finger<br />
in the dyke in view. of the festering problems in Canmbodia, Laos and<br />
Northern Thailand?<br />
PM: I have always felt that if Viet Nam were to be overrun by the<br />
North let met put it that way that it would be likely that what people<br />
call the domino theory would come into practice instead of being theory<br />
and we would see the same sort of thing going on in Laos; ( indeed we've<br />
seen it in provinces of Thailand) and perhaps in Cambodia. I think the<br />
people in that area of the world also have that feeling, though some of<br />
our opponents in Australia regard it as nonsense.<br />
Q. is there right for thinking harki~ g back to that Viet Nam<br />
statement which; as I say, has caused so much comment that there is<br />
a revision of our Asian policy in your mind?<br />
PM: Because we are not increasing the number of. troops?<br />
Q. No. just generally speaking. The Asian situation you are<br />
wanting to impress on Australia a revised Asian outlook?<br />
PM: I don't think so. In what way... Could you explain that a little<br />
bit more?<br />
Q. I feel there was a parellel in your comment on Viet Nam with<br />
a comment you made during your dealings with Lee Kuan Yew yes,<br />
we should be involved in Malaysia but not too involved. Yes, we<br />
should maintain our involvement in Viet Nam but not become-overinvolved.<br />
PM: Ah, well I don't think there is any revision of our policy to<br />
Asia. Asia is an awfully big woidd, isn't it? We are really talking,<br />
both of us in our minds, of the countries of Asia nearest to us Indonesia,<br />
Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, Cambodia and the Philippines, that<br />
area of Asia. I don't think there is any revision there at all. We are,<br />
as I said last night, not only in but of Asia, and we do need to give such<br />
assistance as we can and-as we have been giving, and I think it is the<br />
sort of assistance that ought to be so designed by imparting skills or<br />
technological capacity or capital or factories which will not'just be<br />
consumed as it is given but build up the country to which it is given.<br />
This is the part that we have been playing and must continue to play.<br />
In relation to the military involvement in Malaysia and Singapore which<br />
was what we were talking about, I think, in my comments on Lee Kuan Yew, </p>
<p>PM ( Contd. they have both asked and wish for us to keep some military presence<br />
there. It is a matter still under discussion as to what role that presence<br />
would be, whether it would be expected to be bigger that at present; what<br />
the countries themselves could do. But they do express this wish, and as I<br />
said again last night, this wish must weigh quite heavily with us. I think the<br />
late Harold Holt paid particular attention to Asia, made us known'in Asia<br />
better. than we have been known before. I think * this was one great achievement<br />
of his, particularly the personal contacts he made to do it. This is something<br />
I would hope to W~ ild on rather than revise.<br />
Q. As he was keen, so are you keen to develop our relationship with<br />
Indonesia?<br />
PM: Yes.<br />
Q. Now on this point, the F1Il was ordered at the time when the<br />
situation with Indonesia., was anything but happy. Since then, of course,<br />
Britain has cancelled its order. Do you feel it would be prudent for us now<br />
to cancel ours with that as a background?<br />
PM : I think it would be too late for us to cancel the order, leaving aside<br />
the question of whether one should or whether one shouldn't. I think it would<br />
be too late. I speak subject to correction, but I believe the first of these<br />
aircraft is due to be delivered in July or very soon and that they are to follow<br />
along later. I would think that apart from anything else cancellation at that<br />
late stage, cancellation charges involved, would all leaving aside the<br />
questio n of whether one should or shouldn't add up to the suggestion that it<br />
is too late anyway.<br />
Q. Personally, do you feel we should?<br />
PM: Personally do I feel we should.. well, clearly we shouldn't<br />
because it is far too late.<br />
Q. Mr Prime Minister, a further note I had here concerning the home<br />
front is: If there is poverty in Australia as indicated in your speech the<br />
other night, is the Government going to investigate it? Will there be an<br />
enquiry?<br />
PM: I was speaking the other night on particular matters, paritularly<br />
related to our health scheme.<br />
Q. The health scheme and the need you hinted there for an overhaul<br />
on the problem of the pensioners and the aged....<br />
PM. Yes. I was trying to compartmentalise it a little, talking on the<br />
health scheme. It is true, I think, that some of the charges for insurance<br />
are getting a bit dear and people aren't therefore covering themselves with<br />
insurance as much as they should. And, of course, there is this thing which<br />
has always disturbed me and still disturbs me that long chronic illnesses<br />
aren't covered, and that can cause immense hardship and economic distress.<br />
Now, you asked Me if there was going to be an enquiry. We are still<br />
compartmentalising. The Department of Heal th. has been examining how to<br />
overcome this. There will need to be in some areas consultatbns, discussions / 6<br />
L </p>
<p>6.<br />
PM ( Contd.) with State Ministers of Health. There is a kind of overlapping<br />
field here. Their views would need to be obtained on perhaps the best way<br />
of tackling the aged long-term -illness people should we seek as much as<br />
possible to keep them in their own homes by providing nursing services,<br />
should we provide more geriatric wards ' to our existing hospitals where<br />
they might be brought back to'a situation where they could retuirn to their<br />
own homes, or, should we just merely seek to build on to additional<br />
hospitals. or nursing homes. Look, it's enormous I could make a speech<br />
for an hour on it.<br />
Q. I understand that, and I think these steps are desirable, but is<br />
there a change in policy because at the time of the last Budget, Mr McMahon<br />
made it known that as much as he would have liked to have helped pensioners<br />
he couldn't., because of the size of the Defence Vote?<br />
PM: I wouldn't put it as a change of policy. Budgets happen year by<br />
year by year. You have asked me is there a change in policy. I would be<br />
sure that we would be' doing something something and it may involve<br />
some sort of enquiry as to the best way of going about it to see that what<br />
we do is directed to ' the areas of real need without upsetting people and<br />
stopping them saving and making them feel, " Well, I have saved for<br />
myself and I am not being treated properly". This is not an easy problem,<br />
to balance those two things. That would need to be investigat-ed not necessarily<br />
by anybody but the Social Services Department, but examined by us. This<br />
is the sort of thing we would need to look into, to do something in the coming<br />
0 Budget. This need n ot necessarily be a change of policy. It is just that<br />
something is going to happen in one Budget that didn't happen in the other.<br />
Q. Do you feel on reflection that you were being a little over-optimistic<br />
in saying that what happened in the Holt Government period could be. ruled off?<br />
PM: Did I say that, that everything that happened in the Holt Government<br />
could be ruled off?<br />
Q. You are suggesting I have misinterpreted it?<br />
P~ M: My recollection of that was t hat somebody asked me a particular<br />
question bearing simply on Mr McMahon and Mr McEwen, and that my<br />
answer to that particular question was that in the new Governent, I would<br />
propose to rule off the book.<br />
Q. A final question. How do you intend to go about correcting the<br />
problems Within the Coalition if you are going to rule off the book and start<br />
again with a new Ministry?<br />
PM: Well, I believe that we will be able to work as a Coalition,<br />
certainly as well as the Coalition has worked in the past. I would be most<br />
surprised if that were not so. I admire and like Mr McEwen and I feel he<br />
has a liking and respect for me and this is a good basis on which to start.<br />
I have more than mere political associations with a number of his Ministers<br />
as well. Now, in any Coalition there are bound to be differences of emphasis<br />
from time to time, there are bound to be conflicts of ideas as to what should<br />
be done in some particular field, but these can be settled, these can be<br />
ironed out if the overall philosophy and the ultimate objective of the two parties<br />
are the same. It is a disagreement on methods of obt-aining an overall </p>
<p>7.<br />
PM ( Contd.) objective, but if the overall objective is there and if confidence<br />
is there, then those do not in my view break, or tend to break, a<br />
working partnership </p>
