THE CARETAKER MINISTRY<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER,<br />
THE HONOURABLE MALCOLM FRASER, M. P.<br />
ON 11 NOVEMBER 1975 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES<br />
I STATED THE TERMS ON WHICH HIS EXCELLENCY THE GOVERNOR-GENERAL,<br />
HAD INVITED ME TO FORM A CARETAKER GOVERNMENT " THAT IS ONE<br />
THAT MAKES NO APPOINTMENTS OR DISMISSALS AND INITIATES NO<br />
POLICIES UNTIL A GENERAL ELECTION IS HELD".<br />
I SAID THAT I HAD GIVEN HIS EXCELLENCY THAT<br />
ASSURANCE. I ALSO SAID THAT THERE WILL BE NO ROYAL COMMISSIONS<br />
OR INQUIRIES INTO THE ACTIVITIES OF THE WHITLAM GOVERNMENT<br />
THROUGHOUT THE PERIOD OF THE ELECTION CAMPAIGN.<br />
liHEN I ANNOUNCED THE FORMATION OF MY MINISTRY<br />
YESTERDAY I WENT ON TO EXPLAIN THAT MY GOVERNMENT WOULD NOT<br />
ALTER THE POLICIES OF THE PREVIOUS GOVERNMENT UNTIL THE ELECTION<br />
IS DETERMINED. WE WILL OF COURSE BE ADVOCATING THE POLICIES<br />
THAT WE BELIEVE OUGHT TO PREVAIL AND THAT WE WILL IMPLEMENT AS<br />
A RESULT OF WINNING THE ELECTION.<br />
I HJAVE, TITEREFORE, ISSUED INSTRUCTIONS TO ALL<br />
MINISTERS THAT EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY THEY SHOULD TAKE ONLY<br />
THOSE ACTIONS NECESSARY FOR THE ORDINARY ADMINISTRATION OF<br />
THEIR DEPARTMENTS AND THAT AS FAR AS POSSIBLE THEY SHOULD<br />
AVOID MAKING DECISIONS THAT COULD GIVE RISE TO CONTENTION. </p>
<p>YESTERDAY IN CABINET IT WAS AGREED THAT IF CASES<br />
ARISE WHERE APPOINTMENTS ARE UNAVOIDABLE, THE TERMS OF SUCH<br />
INTERIM APPOINTMENTS SHOULD NOT RUN BEYOND 1 JANUARY 1976.<br />
THE GOVERNMENT AGREED THAT THE PUBLIC SERVICE BOARD<br />
SHOULD ADVISE DEPARTMENTS THAT, IN THIS INTERIM PERIOD,<br />
EXCEPT IN SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES TO BE OUTLINED TO DEPARTMENTS<br />
BY THE BOARD, THE CREATION OF NEW POSITIONS SHOULD NOT BE<br />
PROCEEDED WITH AND NEW PROVISIONAL PROMOTIONS SHOULD BE HELD<br />
OVER. IN THE ELECTION PERIOD, NORMAL DEPARTMENTAL<br />
INFORMATION, ADVICE AND ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES WILL BE<br />
AVAILABLE TO MINISTERS. THIS ACCORDS WITH THE USUAL PRACTICE.<br />
13 NOVEMBER 1975 </p>
