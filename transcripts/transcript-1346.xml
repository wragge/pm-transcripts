PRIME MINISTER'S VISIT TO U. S. A. AND U. K.'<br />
Reply to Mayor Lindsay by the Prime Minister. Mr. Harold Holt<br />
at Dinner at Metropolitan Museum of' Art. New York<br />
Thank you, Mr. Mayor. Well, Mr. Mayor, before we let you go<br />
away, would you come back so that people can see me gettin rd of<br />
this thing to begin with. This isn't our principal gift, Ladies and<br />
G-. ntlemen, but I thought it had better get out of the way in case<br />
there was any confusion... ( Inaudible exchange with Mayor Lindsay).<br />
This is not a very big cigarette case, but it holds a few cigarettes<br />
and it has got in opals at each point around the me pof Australia<br />
the capital cities. You won't find Alice Springs tht's an extra<br />
opal, which we, in this difficult year, felt we couldn't afford<br />
we've had a drought as you mentioned. But it's got all the regular<br />
capitals and it comes to you as a small but sincere memento of a<br />
warmth of feeling between Australia and your countr and in<br />
particular the special place which New Yy~ rk has in the minds of<br />
people in my own country who recognise it as one of the great<br />
romantic and historic cities of the world. But I'm going to say<br />
something about that so I won't spoil the speech. Here you are..<br />
Well, now, Ladies and Gentlemen, that was really only a<br />
little bit of trackwork. now settle down to the serious running.<br />
Mrs. Holt and I, who have been honoured in so many different ways<br />
in this visit we have had to the United States, and who have<br />
memorable thoug. hts to take away with us of the kindness, the<br />
graciousness of the American people, add another chapter tonight to<br />
that story of our friendship with your country and of the unique<br />
features which have made the United States one of the exciting<br />
countries in the history of the human race. This city, New York, has<br />
its o' ins pecial place of course. We take a magazine called the<br />
New Yorker each week just so that we'll know what is going on around<br />
the place. We never seem to get to a lot of the well-commended<br />
and well advertised establishments I thought I might have got to<br />
one of the livelier places of entertainment, but at least we have<br />
had a topless show. here tonight as I gaze around the room. My wife<br />
brought me here to this vionderful gallery and museum of yours in<br />
order to see a mobile of the sun. I didn't know what she was<br />
talking about. It seemed an unnecessary invasion into the very<br />
limited time wie have had. But we camne to see the mobile of the sun.<br />
I think wie have been back a few times since, and she is threatening<br />
to return before we catch the plane tomorrow morning. But we<br />
couldn't have had a more delightful setting for this dinner which<br />
you have broug5ht to us by way of honour, and we couldn't have had a<br />
nicer group of people, which, by succession of visits, seems to<br />
include a great many of the friends, respectable and otherwise, I<br />
have formed in this city of New York.<br />
But you and I have quite a few things in common. You are in<br />
the first six months of your Mayoralty. I'm in the first six<br />
months of my Prime Ministership. I don't think you have to stand<br />
for re-election as quickly as I do on the other hand I doubt<br />
whether we will have any tugh fiscal measure in my Budget which<br />
would endanger my position. It's a remarkable thing that you seem to<br />
avoid these problems as you get close to your election. The following<br />
year fiscal necessities build up but I don't want any trepidation<br />
to develop in my own country on that account. I had the privilege<br />
of introducing seven Budgets. It says much for the toughness, the<br />
durability, the tolerance of the Australian people, that I was able<br />
to succeed Sir Robert Menzies by unanimous election after a punishment<br />
on my fellow countrymen of that kind and over that duration.<br />
-4A. </p>
<p>2.<br />
Tonight we have been honoured by an assembly here of people<br />
whose names are household words throughout the world and whose<br />
generosity or whose contribution to industry, science, to knowledge<br />
and in a variety of other directions in which human experience have<br />
come together in this amazing city of New York. I think, Mr.<br />
Mayor, you have a population very close to that of my own country<br />
and we have a country the size of the United States if Alaska can<br />
be left out of it. It's always a difficulty for me about this<br />
Alaska business. I've got nothing against the people of Alaska.<br />
I've no doubt that they are very fine people, but it spoils my<br />
whole comparison iffl have to bring Alaska into the comparison.<br />
But leave them out, and there we are with the same dimension of<br />
country to look after. I understand you have some 27,000 policemenwell<br />
wie have only 18,000 policemen, and I don't know whether<br />
that means that we're just short of policemen, or that you need<br />
more policemen than we need policemen. But it's a fact. But the<br />
thing which really makes me warm to this city is that, through your<br />
gate and with the symbolic Statue of Liberty was built the greatest<br />
democracy in the history of mankind. The strongest power, the<br />
richest civilisation and most affluent society. This all came<br />
largely through the people that flowed into this country through<br />
this city of New York.<br />
I happen to have been Minister of Immigration in my owin<br />
country for nine years and made quite a study of how you did it<br />
because in this day and age it couldn't be repeated. People<br />
w,-ould want, if you brought them here, the schools, the hospitals,<br />
all the other amenities of the community life the stress and<br />
added burden of the community would seem almost insupportable. I<br />
wionder if you would know that if you have the same growth rate in<br />
the United States today in population that wae have in my country you<br />
would have to build another half million homes a year to accommodate<br />
that rate of population growth. Yet, through the 19th century, people<br />
pDoured in the numbers were not accommodated in the organised way<br />
that they are at this time but somehow '. he nation adapted itself<br />
to the growth of population, new industries sprang up, employment<br />
grew as the demands and needs of one supplied the opportunities for<br />
the other. I have speculated more than once in a lifetime that if, in<br />
that period of human history, the critics had succeeded in<br />
discouraging the men in leadership in the United States at that<br />
time if all the things that could be said against the pressures<br />
that arise from building up a population too rapidly had carried<br />
the day, then would w~ e have had brought into the cause of freedom<br />
at a critical stage in two world wars the power, might and resources<br />
of this great American democracy? I leave that thought in your<br />
minds because it is somethaing I have often thought about and when<br />
the doubt has attacked me at times, when the pressures on our<br />
resources seem greater than we could comfortably bear, I was<br />
heartened by the recollection of what had been accomplished in your<br />
great country and I felt if America could be made great through<br />
people of quality, and exploiting the resources of a pioneering<br />
country, then Australia could follow in that example and itself </p>
<p>contribute a great democracy to the cause of freedom throughout<br />
the world. We have been together in the cause of freedom four<br />
times already in the course of this century and I suspect that<br />
over the long; years ahead of us there will be many times shen<br />
America and Australia will go in comradeship together, whether<br />
in war, but, more hopeftilly, in the conditions of peace, to build<br />
a better world for free people. I have been proud to acknowledge<br />
in this visit the contribution that you have made to the security<br />
for us all. I hap pen to come fromn an area of world where, as I<br />
was just saying to M1iss Douglas, our hopes are highest but our<br />
dangers are greatest. It's an area of the world where, over the<br />
next 10, 20, 50 or 100 years, I believe a great new chapter of<br />
human history will unfold. If it develops in the way in which<br />
we would hope to see it develop, then that will be because of<br />
the resolution, the generosity, of the people which made the<br />
Marshall Plan a turning point of history. And you, Mr. Mayor,<br />
through this city which has given so much in leadership and<br />
inspiration to the American people as a whole, can feel that you<br />
have been a great inheritor of the democratic tradition of a<br />
courageous leadership -and that you, in your high office, are now<br />
launched on the endless adven'ture of the public man who has to<br />
give that leadership and see the issues through.<br />
We have in your President such a leader and his resolution<br />
is rallying the people in the area from which I come. Through<br />
him and through you we give thanks to the American people for<br />
vxhat they mean and tonight you have added a colourful, gracious,<br />
and attrative memory to that feeling we have of comradeship<br />
together in the great responsibilities, the great enjoyments which<br />
the modern world has opened to us. Thank you very muich. </p>
