COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA<br />
SPEECH BY<br />
The Rt Hon. J. G. GORTON, M. P.<br />
ON<br />
MOVES TO PREVENT OVERSEAS TAKEOVER OF<br />
NORTHERN TERRITORY URANIUM DEPOSITS<br />
Ministerial Statement<br />
[ From the ' Parliamentary Debates', 17 September 19701<br />
Mr GORTON ( Higgins-Prime Minister)-<br />
by leave-On 16th September 1969<br />
1 made a statement in this House concerning<br />
the Government's policy on overseas<br />
investment in Australia. In the course of<br />
that statement I said:<br />
In the past the Government has acted to preserve<br />
Australian ownership and control of enterprises<br />
which for special reasons of national interest<br />
or importance could not be permitted to pass<br />
into foreign hands.<br />
And I went on to say:<br />
We reserve the right to do all in our power to<br />
prevent particular takeovers when, in the circumstances<br />
of the case, we would consider it to be<br />
bad in the national interest.<br />
There has recently been a discovery of<br />
uranium deposits by a company called<br />
Queensland Mines Ltd, in the Northern<br />
Territory at Nabarlek. The estimates made<br />
by the Chairman of the Company are that<br />
the ore body is so large, and the grade of<br />
ore so rich that it would be possible to<br />
supply the free world's requirements of<br />
uranium at a price considerably be-low that<br />
now ruling.<br />
The Government does not know that<br />
this claim is accurate and it in no way<br />
vouches for its accuracy. But it has been<br />
made by Mr E. Hudson, the Managing<br />
Director of Queensland Mines Ltd. Should<br />
the claim be accurate then there could be<br />
a clear temptation to overseas interests to<br />
22917170 gain control of the Australian companies<br />
which at present own these assets. Queensland<br />
Mines Ltd is one company concerned<br />
and the other is Kathleen Investments<br />
( Australia) Ltd which owns 50 per cent of<br />
the shares in Queensland Mines. It is<br />
therefore clear that control of Kathleen<br />
Investments would in fact lead to control<br />
of Queensland Mines Ltd. It is a matter of<br />
record that in recent days there has been a<br />
heavy -turnover in the shares of both companies,<br />
and although there is no indication<br />
that this heavy turnover is as a result of<br />
overseas ' buying, nevertheless the Government<br />
would not wish a situation to arise<br />
where it could be discovered that control<br />
of these companies had passed out of Australian<br />
hands. The deposits held by the<br />
companies were discovered by Australians,<br />
and exploration work was financed with<br />
Australian capital. The deposits can be<br />
exploited by Australian personnel using<br />
Australian technical knowledge and knowhow<br />
and can be sold on the world market<br />
by Australia.<br />
The Government feels that if Australia<br />
is to reap the full benefit of these discoveries,<br />
full control of this development exploration<br />
should remain in the hands of Australian<br />
companies for the benefit of<br />
Australian shareholders and Australia<br />
generally. We have therefore decided that it </p>
<p>would not be in the national interest for<br />
control of these uranium deposits to pass<br />
into other than Australian hands. We<br />
intend . to guard against control of either of<br />
these companies being gained -through purchases<br />
of shares by overseas investors.<br />
Both companies are incorporated in the<br />
Australian Capital Territory. We therefore<br />
intend to legislate in order:<br />
to limit to 15 per cent of the issued<br />
share capital the total number of<br />
shares able to be held in either company<br />
by persons not ordinarily resident<br />
in Australia or by foreign corporations.<br />
Foreign corporations will<br />
be defined in general similarly to the<br />
definition in the Companies ( Life<br />
Insurance Holding Companies)<br />
Ordinance 1968.<br />
to limit the number of shares held<br />
in either company by any one person<br />
not ordinarily resident in Australia<br />
or held by any one foreign corporation, -to not more than 5 per<br />
cent of the issued share capital.<br />
This means that a total of 15 per cent of<br />
the issued share capital can be held abroad<br />
but that no one holder can hold more than<br />
5 per cent of the issued share capital in<br />
either companyto require any nominee holding, in<br />
total, shares in excess of 5 per cent<br />
of the issued capital in either company<br />
to disclose the beneficial<br />
ownership of those shares.<br />
This action is not to be interpreted as anything<br />
other than an attempt to preserve in<br />
Australian hands and under Australian management<br />
assets which have been discovered<br />
by purely Australian endeavours and which<br />
may be of very significant benefit to Australia.<br />
It is an instance of -the working out<br />
of that policy announced on 16 September<br />
last year, which I reiterated at the beginning<br />
of this statement.<br />
