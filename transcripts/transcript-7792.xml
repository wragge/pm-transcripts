PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW WITH MARGARET PEACOCK, RADIO 3AK<br />
27 OCTOBER 1989<br />
E OE PROOF ONLY<br />
PEACOCK: Welcome Bob.<br />
PM: Thanks very much Margaret.<br />
PEACOCK: Do you feel a bit scathed by your coming up<br />
C. against the mighty Maggie?<br />
PM: No, I don't feel scathed Margaret. Mrs Thatcher's<br />
become used to getting her own way. She hasn't had a very<br />
strong opposition over there either on the other side of the<br />
Parliament or within her own ranks. She's not really<br />
accustomed to people who have another point of view putting<br />
it up and putting it strongly. In the case of Brian<br />
Mulroney and myself, Brian being as it were on her side of<br />
politics and myself being on the other, we have common views<br />
on these things. And when we stand up and express them I<br />
think she gets a little bit frustrated and says some things<br />
which perhaps normally she wouldn't say.<br />
PEACOCK: She's sort of been on the outer for a while though<br />
on South Africa in particular hasn't she? You'd wonder why<br />
that sort of I'd put it down to arrogance when she's up<br />
against the rest of the Commonwealth Heads of Government<br />
representatives but -she's so stubborn about that stance.<br />
PM: I don't want to ascribe it to arrogance or say just<br />
what it is. But it's certainly against all the evidence.<br />
It is just literally impossible now Margaret to use the<br />
argument that Mrs Thatcher does that sanctions haven't<br />
worked when for instance you have the minister for finance<br />
in the South African government, duPlessis, explicitly<br />
saying two things, two related things. He said that the<br />
sanctions have hurt South Africa, they've imposed severe<br />
economic constraints on them. The second thing he says, and<br />
that will continue to be the case until we change the<br />
political situation. The same thing has been said by the<br />
late Governor of the Reserve Bank of South Africa, deKock,<br />
he said in May the same thing. So when their own members of<br />
government critically, key important members of the<br />
government and of the Reserve Bank, are saying that<br />
sanctions are hurting and that they must change the internal<br />
political situation, it's very silly for Mrs Thatcher to be<br />
saying they're not working. </p>
<p>PEACOCK: would you like to see those sanctions go further,<br />
perhaps harsher economic sanctions?<br />
PM: The ideal situation I would like is no sanctions at<br />
all. I don't favour sanctions for the sake of sanctions..<br />
The phrase I've used is sanctions are not to bring South<br />
Africa to its knees but to bring it to the negotiating<br />
table. The ideal situation would be that the South African<br />
government would say we recognise that we have to end<br />
apartheid. We agree to do that. If that were the case I<br />
would say, and I'm sure it would be accepted, we'll lift<br />
every sanction. If they gave an unequivocal commitment to<br />
negotiate with the non-whites to move to a non-racial<br />
democratic South Africa then sanctions are off. Now,<br />
however, if they're not going to do that, and there's no<br />
indication yet that that's what they're about, then the<br />
sanctions, the existing ones should be maintained and<br />
financial sanctions should be increased.<br />
PEACOCK: Your relationship with Margaret Thatcher, the<br />
slanging match if you like, is very personal. It seems to<br />
me that you really don't like each other.<br />
PM: No I don't think that that's right. I mean just let's<br />
look back. Mrs Thatcher came here last year and she was<br />
kind enough to say it was probably the best overseas visit<br />
she'd had. She was very very warm both directly to me,<br />
speaking to me, and by way of letter. She went back and<br />
spoke very very warmly of the visit out here and asked that<br />
I go over there with some of my senior Ministers this year.<br />
She went out of her way to organise that visit that we had<br />
in the middle of this year to London. She went out of her<br />
way to organise that in a way which gave us every<br />
opportunity of full contact not only wFith ministers but with<br />
business people. She gave me a very very warm dinner at her<br />
residence in 10 Downing Street. So I think it is the case<br />
that the relationship apart from the issue of apartheid in<br />
South Africa has been a sensible one and a reasonably<br />
constructive one. we differ of course in our politics but<br />
we've recognised there's an historical relationship of<br />
importance between our two countries and that there are<br />
opportunities for development of that relationship. ' But on<br />
this issue we simply are polls apart.<br />
PEACOCK: putting it mildly. with Malcolm Fraser not<br />
getting the Secretary-Generalship, you lobbied pretty hard<br />
for him, he was lobbying pretty hard for himself. I mean he<br />
was almost electioneering I would have said in the lead-up.<br />
Were you disappointed or are you quite relaxed about it?<br />
PM: I was disappointed. I honestly believe that Malcolm<br />
was the better of two excellent candidates. We were in the<br />
fortunate position of having two excellent candidates. my<br />
argument in favour of Ma * lcolm was very simple and it's this.<br />
That while South Africa is not the only item on the<br />
. Commonwealth agenda by any means, it never should be,<br />
however-by any standard -it's going to continue to be a very </p>
<p>very important one. It's my judgement that it is what is<br />
going to happen outside the Commonwealth, what's going to be<br />
done by countries like the United States, the European<br />
countries and Japan which will finally, with the<br />
Commonwealth action as well, be decisive in forcing change<br />
in South Africa. And I simply believe that Malcolm, because<br />
of his experience as an Australian Prime Minister and the<br />
stature that he had internationally, that he was in a better<br />
position than the Chief, the other candidate, to bring<br />
pressure in those other countries, to use influence. None<br />
of that thinking reflected anything derogatory about Chief<br />
Anyaoku. I mean I like the man. He's a very good man. He<br />
will be a very good Secretary-General. It was just that<br />
point alone that on this issue of race and colour as you<br />
know Malcolm's credentials are impecable and I think he<br />
could have done that part of the job better. He went very<br />
close to getting it too I might say.<br />
PEACOCK: What was the vote?<br />
PM: I can tell you. I mean I musn't tell you the exact<br />
vote but I can tell you it was less than a handful of votes<br />
required to change hands. So it was very very close. But<br />
once the decision, the vote was taken we all then<br />
unanimously came in behind the one who had the majority. He<br />
will do a very good job.<br />
PEACOCK: Malcolm's gone fishing in the meantime I think.<br />
Back home, the pilots. Australia's sort of been brought to<br />
its knees in a lot of ways because of this pilots' strike<br />
and anybody listening to my program will know that I don't<br />
support the pilots in their action. The Federation I think<br />
has been outrageous. But I'm wondering what the current<br />
situation as you read it is. How many planes are flying?<br />
What capacity? And what sort of pilots?<br />
PM: The current capacity is over 60% and it will be going<br />
up to 80% before very long. That capacity is of course made<br />
up of part of the RAAF and part of the international<br />
airlines, but increasingly it's Australian and Ansett<br />
building up their own capacity through these elements. A<br />
return of some of the Federation pilots, there's some of<br />
those going back consistently now. There are some from the<br />
Australian general aviation industry that have been<br />
recruited and there are foreign pilots. So the building up<br />
of the airlines is going ahead just consistently and<br />
remorselessly. what it will mean Margaret is that when we<br />
go into next year we're just going to have an infinitely<br />
more efficient aviation industry in this country. If you<br />
talk about microeconomic reform this will be a massive<br />
microeconomic reform. It will be about a 60% improvement in<br />
productivity. The basic number of hours that were worked on<br />
average by pilots before was 32 hours at the stick. Now the<br />
basic figure under the contracts is about 55. So what will<br />
happen is that you're going to have just an enormous<br />
increase in productivity and efficiency which will be good<br />
. in the long run for our whole economy and for our tourist<br />
industry in particular.. </p>
<p>PEACOCK: Do you see the pilots' federation as an operating<br />
body now? Is there any legitimacy to it?<br />
PM: What I find very difficult to understand Margaret is<br />
why having made the terrible mistakes they did in the first<br />
place and having acted against their own interest and<br />
against the economy's interest in the first place -I guess<br />
everyone can make those sort of mistakes initially -but I<br />
can't for the life of me understand their continuing saga of<br />
stupidity. Before I went away, with the decision of the<br />
Industrial Relations Commission, they were given their<br />
chance then, their sort of final chance of becoming relevant<br />
and part of the action. Because what the Commission said Is<br />
well the individual contracts are the basis for building up<br />
the airlines and that's what's got to happen. The<br />
federation can be considered to have possibly part of this<br />
if they do these things. one, if they drop their embargo on<br />
their members signing contracts with the airlines. And then<br />
C the second and third points being that they accept the<br />
guidelines and the decision of the Commission. Now if<br />
they'd done that, they'd said alright, ok, we've played our<br />
cards, we've lost, we want to be part of the game, if they'd<br />
said that then the Commission could've given them a role.<br />
But they refused to do that and so they've dealt themselves<br />
out. I must say this that I never wanted to be vindictive<br />
about the pilots individually but I must say in regard to<br />
their leadership if I look back over the whole of Australian<br />
industrial relations history I find it impossible to<br />
remember a situation Margaret in which a leadership of an<br />
industrial organisation has so grievously harmed their<br />
members. Because look at what they've done. They've cost<br />
them their jobs. For those who do go back they've cost them<br />
their seniority. Thirdly and very importantly, they've cost<br />
them their redundancy. Because if they'd stayed in the<br />
airlines and there'd been productivity negotiations and<br />
pilots had become redundant then the airlines would've had<br />
to pay them significant redundancy payments, the golden<br />
handshake. But by telling their members to resign they've<br />
lost all that.<br />
PEACOCK: But politically could I put it to you that at the<br />
start it was a very good issue that you could go in hard on<br />
because 30% to any Australian and recent polls show that<br />
only two per cent of Australians actually support the<br />
pilots' federation 30% is really over the top. It's a<br />
very safe issue for you to go in when you're calling for<br />
wage restraint everywhere else. It also suited the<br />
airlines. I mean the silly pilots came up against a<br />
government and massive airlines. From the start they really<br />
couldn't win as far as I could see. But it suited the<br />
airlines because of deregulation and the restructuring that<br />
is now going on in the airline industry. </p>
<p>PM: It suited the airlines but they didn't want the fight.<br />
The airlines wanted to negotiate. They wanted to negotiate<br />
within the guidelines from the Commission. But it was the<br />
pilots who said no. I pleaded with the pilots at the very<br />
beginning. I said negotiate. Do what every other group of<br />
workers in the country has to do and that is to negotiate.<br />
Workers and professional-type workers around the country are<br />
doing this. They are negotiating within the guidelines and<br />
able to get quite significant increases. But the pilots<br />
said no. Now as you rightly say the airlines, while they<br />
are suffering very grievous losses whil. e it's on, taking the<br />
longer term view are going to be better off. But that's not<br />
the course of action they wanted. They did want<br />
negotiation. So did the Government.<br />
PEACOCK: But what about my first point there that it was a<br />
good political issue for Bob Hawke to campaign<br />
PM: I didn't say here's a good political issue. I mean it<br />
was rather, this was my view. I knew Margaret that if we<br />
didn't oppose, and oppose fiercely the pilots, then we were<br />
on notice. It was perfectly understandable from the rest of<br />
the trade union movement if the pilots were allowed to get<br />
by exercising a muscle, they said that's the end of the<br />
game. We will say to everyone else whose got the muscle, ok<br />
well you go and get 30%. 1 knew that was the end of the<br />
economy. You just can't have a wages break-out like that.<br />
So it wasn't just the pilots. I mean if you'd been in a<br />
situation where you knew it was just the pilots, just the<br />
pilots and no-one else, it wouldn't have any effect, people<br />
might have said oh well we'll put up with all this<br />
kerfuffle, I still think I would've opposed it. But the<br />
critical issue was that we knew if the pilots were allowed<br />
to break through for 30% it was game,-. set and match. The<br />
economy was finished.<br />
PEACOCK: Bob, just back on the airlines for one little bit<br />
more and that is the compensation that you're paying to the<br />
airlines. First up, how much have you currently paid the<br />
airlines and if the strike goes on and on it could cost the<br />
Government millions and millions while the travel industry<br />
is falling apart.<br />
PM: There are two things about that. I just don't know<br />
what the precise figure is now Margaret. But these things<br />
should be understood about it. It is not compensation for<br />
their losses. So they're not being distinguished from the<br />
tourist industry in that. It was simply that we had a<br />
situation that if the airlines had stood down the other<br />
non-pilot employees, as would have been the sort of thing<br />
that would've normally happened, then two things would've<br />
happened. One you just couldn't have built up the, you<br />
couldn't have had the structure for building up the airlines<br />
again and two there would've been a breakout elsewhere. So<br />
there was a decision made that the airlines, not being able<br />
. to stand down their employees without those consequences, we<br />
would compensate there.. * In the tourism industry where they </p>
<p>-6-<br />
didn't have jobs they were able to stand down their people.<br />
That was something that the airlines couldn't do. But as<br />
far as the tourism industry is concerned, they came to see<br />
me. To their great credit they said we don't want<br />
compensation. They understood the distinction. They said<br />
quite specifically to me we don't want compensation but what<br />
we do want is assistance for rebuilding the industry when<br />
the dispute is finished. I said well you'll get that. So<br />
what they are doing now is they're putting up proposals and<br />
a number of sections of the tourist industry are going to be<br />
doing this. They'll be putting up proposals to me for how<br />
the Government can assist in the sort of advertising<br />
campaign that will build the industry up. We will help them<br />
in that way. Because what we've got to understand is that<br />
the great attractions of Australia as a tourist destination,<br />
both people from overseas and for people within Australia,<br />
that they remain unchanged. The Barrier Reef's still there,<br />
the Rock's still there. All our natural attractions are<br />
still there. Once the airline industry is back and running<br />
S fully, as it will be, then the tourism industry will build<br />
S up. What we can do is to accelerate the knowledge and<br />
understanding of people that it's all there and ready to go<br />
again. PEACOCK: It could be too late for a few people who've gone<br />
out of business. You mentioned the standdowns and the fact<br />
that the airlines can't stand people down and I can<br />
understand the logic in keeping the airlines going and<br />
helping the travel industry. But there are a lot of people<br />
who have lost jobs. When you mention that the travel<br />
industry can stand down people there are thousands of people<br />
out of jobs and even with the collapse of Christopher Skase<br />
for instance<br />
PM: The collapse of Christopher Skase has got nothing to do<br />
with PEACOCK: He mentioned specifically the pilots' strike.<br />
PM: Christopher Skase may mention it but look, no, there is<br />
no economic analyst who will give you a moments thought on<br />
that. Christopher Skase hasn't collapsed because of the<br />
pilots' strike. Now in regard to people who have been stood<br />
down it's true some people have suffered. But what I've<br />
done there Margaret is to write to the banking industry and<br />
to the finance industry, and I've got positive responses<br />
from them. I've said where people, small enterprises are in<br />
a situation where they need to be accommodated financially,<br />
please do it. I've got a positive response from the banks<br />
and finance industry on that. They are prepared to do that.<br />
So that where an operator is really financially stretched as<br />
a result of the pilots' dispute they can be accommodated.<br />
The important thing is too that they should understand that<br />
the industry is going to come back and is going to come back </p>
<p>-7-<br />
stronger. Because what you've got to understand is that<br />
with an airline industry which is going to be operating with<br />
that significant improvement in productivity and efficiency,<br />
that will mean as you look through time the actual fare<br />
structure will be at a lower level than it otherwise<br />
would've been.<br />
PEACOCK: I'd love to see the fares go down for a change.<br />
But we talked to Ben Sandilands, the travel writer for the<br />
Bulletin the other day. He said there was no hope of<br />
getting the travel industry back together and operating<br />
before 1993.<br />
PM: Well, I just don't agree with Sandilands on that.<br />
PEACOCK: OK, well you'd beg to differ. On the economy,<br />
main question. I said to one of the young people in this<br />
office today ' if you were talking to the Prime Minister what<br />
sort of question would you like to have the answer to'. She<br />
came up with, a young 20 year old, interest rates.<br />
PM: Yes, sure. Well, there always is a problem. I hate to<br />
sound like a professor of economics when I answer this, so<br />
I'll try and put it in language which<br />
PEACOCK: Yes, don't talk like Mr Keating.<br />
PM: Yes, sure. Well, I'm not talking about Paul, but I do<br />
want to put it in terms that that lass that you're talking<br />
about would understand. So, I'll try not to be technical.<br />
Let me put it this way. Interest rates, very simply, are<br />
the price of money. That's what interest rates are. Money<br />
that you want to borrow, that's the price you have to pay to<br />
borrow money. You borrow money to actually play some part<br />
in the economic process, either to help run you're<br />
running a business or you're buying a house or you want to<br />
purchase some commodity. But in some way or another you are<br />
playing some part in the economic process and you've got to<br />
borrow money so you've got to pay a price for that money you<br />
borrowed. Now, what we've got in Australia at the moment is<br />
a situation where too many things are happening in the<br />
economy. The level of activity, that is people who've been<br />
building that many houses, they have been starting that many<br />
areas of activity, doing that many things that we, with that<br />
level of activity, were sucking in, bringing in from<br />
overseas a level of imports that we're not able to pay for<br />
by what we export. So that means you just can't you can<br />
do that for some time because you borrow and you can do that<br />
for a while but you can't go on doing that for ever and<br />
ever. So, what we have to do is to get that level of<br />
activity down somewhat so that the level of imports that's<br />
coming in we can afford to pay for. So that what we've got<br />
to make the price of money a little bit higher so that<br />
people will marginally not make the decision to do that,<br />
undertake that activity or buy that thing so that it will<br />
bring things down. Now that's if we didn't do that, I<br />
jnean, I -think I'm a pretty intelligent guy, pretty<br />
intelligent politician., I'm not doing it for fun. I mean, </p>
<p>-8-<br />
high interest rates hurt Prime Ministers. No doubt about<br />
that, but the simple fact is, and you can explain to this<br />
lass, if I just made the price of money cheaper and she was<br />
able to go off and buy more things or buy another house or<br />
' do something lik~ e that then, it might sound nice for a<br />
moment, but before long she'd be much worse off because if<br />
that happened the economy simply would collapse. We'd have<br />
that many imports in that our exchange rate would be<br />
destroyed, interest rates would go through the roof and the<br />
whole economy would collapse.<br />
PEACOCK: But can you see how we all, listening to you, the<br />
banks put up the interest rates, the Government's talking to<br />
us about how greedy we are buying all these things-<br />
PM: It's not a question of greedy.<br />
PEACOCK: But what I'm trying to say is that the people who<br />
are paying the interest rates, who are just expected time<br />
and time again to cope with one percent rises here and there<br />
and it's been a fair percentage over the last year or two<br />
PM: Yes, it has. It's gone up.<br />
PEACOCK: to find the money and they're looking at a<br />
bank that's supposed to be lending them at fair and<br />
reasonable rates and a Government that's blaming them for<br />
their consumption.<br />
PM: No, it's not I'm not blaming them. There's no<br />
suggestion on my part, Margaret, that I'm blaming anyone.<br />
I'm simply saying that as we came into 1989 and out of last<br />
year, judgements were made by the economists in Government<br />
and in the banks in the private sector about what sort of<br />
level of activity would be. None of-us really anticipated<br />
that the level of activity would continue to be so high. So<br />
we've had to, in that situation not say look, we blame<br />
anyone that you're doing too much. We've simply, if we're<br />
going to protect the economy we've got to make sure that<br />
everyone's activity is dampened down a bit. That's why I've<br />
had to say and it's not just interest rates, that's why in<br />
the area of wages we're keeping the lid on wages. I've had<br />
to say to the pilots you're not getting 30 percent. I've<br />
had to say to members of Parliament, you're not getting the<br />
sort of increases that you thought you were going to get.<br />
I've stopped the -Parliamentary increases in levels they<br />
thought they were going to get. We've had to say to<br />
everyone, come on you've just got to dampen down a bit<br />
because if we all don't do that then the economy will<br />
collapse. I mean, no economy can simply keep saying you can<br />
buy everything you want, have everything you want to do if<br />
you're not producing it yourself and you're just getting it<br />
from overseas and borrowing to pay for it. You've got to be<br />
able essentially, essentially you've got to be able by what<br />
you export to pay for what you've got to import. That's<br />
essentially what you've got to do, you can't keep borrowing<br />
. for ever. That means all of us, without blaming anyone,<br />
without-blaming members of Parliament for wanting more or </p>
<p>blaming the lass that you're talking about for wanting to<br />
buy a better house or something like that. It's simply that<br />
all of us have got to reduce our expectations a little bit,<br />
not a great deal, but a little bit. That means, for a<br />
while, interest rates being up where they were. I can tell<br />
that lass out there, as soon as the day comes, as soon as<br />
the day comes where we can see the evidence that the level<br />
of activity is levelled off and it's coming down a little<br />
bit, then interest rates will come down.<br />
PEACOCK: Well, you said that in February this year in<br />
Perth, that interest rates would fall this year. They've<br />
gone up and Paul Keating is saying they'll stay there until<br />
next year.<br />
PM4: Well, what people are trying to say that Paul said<br />
that they wouldn't come down before June next year. He<br />
didn't say that. What Paul has said is consistent with what<br />
I've said. We've both said we will keep interest rates as<br />
high as they need to be for as long as is necessary to get<br />
that level of activity down a bit.<br />
PEACOCK: So it could be well into next year. You're not<br />
saying it won't be.<br />
PM4: No, but what I'm saying is that the financial community<br />
must know, both within this country and overseas that we are<br />
not going to play fast and loose with interest rates. In<br />
other words, they needn't, don't think that because there's<br />
an election coming up I will be irresponsible by. interest<br />
rates and bring them down before it's responsible to do so.<br />
But if we see the signs that through the various economic<br />
indicators that all of us, as a result of interest rates and<br />
wage compression and so on, as a result of all those things,<br />
the level of activity is coming down,-then interest rates<br />
will come off.<br />
PEACOCK: What about your, the Reserve Bank agreement with<br />
the four major banks. What was the purpose, what is the<br />
agreement, what have they promised in return?<br />
PM4: They've agreed, in that situation where we let me go<br />
back one step so that you can understand. We've got these<br />
things called non callable deposits and when they were set<br />
up there was a, sort of a, punitive rate on them. They only<br />
got paid at about five percent on that as against what they<br />
could get in the market Now, with the rise in market<br />
rates, that penalty rate was widened. So what we did is to<br />
restore the gap between what it was when we first put them<br />
in and now-<br />
PEACOCK: Why?<br />
PM: Well, because there was no reason to impose a further<br />
penalty on them. I mean, we thought that the housing sector<br />
had really made enough contribution, there had been a<br />
. flattening off in the housing sector and we didn't think.<br />
there needed to be any-more there. So in return for having </p>
<p>that sort of gap restored to what it was before, the banks<br />
said alright and they undertook not to increase mortgage<br />
rates. PEACOCK: So they actually said that the mortgage rates in<br />
those four major banks will stay at 17 percent?<br />
PM: At the level that they were because they had been<br />
compensated by the restoration of the differential that<br />
existed at the beginning of the non callable deposit<br />
a rrangement.<br />
PEACOCK: For how long?<br />
PM: Well, that will go, obviously go up to the end of this<br />
year and I think we'll have a situation where, I believe,<br />
that you've had the peaking of rates. what's worried people<br />
obviously through this year is that mortgage rates have, as<br />
you referred to before, they've gone up and up. I think we<br />
can say now that they've peaked. I think that there is<br />
S evidence coming through, it's not conclusive enough yet<br />
right across about what's happening to the general level of<br />
activity but I don't believe that we're looking at an<br />
increase in rates now.<br />
PEACOCK: And yet the State Bank here in Victoria, not part<br />
of the system of course, the big four, has indicated that<br />
they thought interest rates would go up.<br />
PM: Well<br />
PEACOCK: I mean, they're outside that agreement.<br />
PM: They're not outside that agreement. I mean, why it<br />
applied to these major banks they were the ones who had the<br />
non callable deposits who had the penalty attached to them.<br />
So it's logical why<br />
PEACOCK: Just getting back to you saying that the interest<br />
rates have peaked<br />
PM: Well, let me say about that, I mean, I don't want to be<br />
misquoted on that. what I've said is I think on the<br />
evidence that's available, Margaret, that we are not seeing<br />
now the level of economic activity continuing to grow. I<br />
think the evidence is coming that it's flattening, but the<br />
basic thing I want to say to, not just to ordinary people<br />
and voters our there, but what I'm saying to the financial<br />
markets too, is that we are not going to go sloppy on<br />
interest rates. They are not going to come off a day<br />
earlier than they should. I'm simply saying that on the<br />
evidence I don't believe that we're looking at any need for<br />
a further increase. I think, if anything, what will happen<br />
is the level of activity will lessen, the general economic<br />
activity and it's within that framework that you can see<br />
interest rates coming off. But they are going to stay up<br />
. there as long as is necessary until we make that judgement. </p>
<p>-11-<br />
PEACOCK: So you've got the guarantee from the big four that<br />
interest rates will stay about the same with your<br />
compensation or your giving back that money till the end of<br />
the year. But there's no control over the other banks or<br />
the building societies?<br />
PM: Well, that you've got the situation, as I said before,<br />
they haven't got the same penalty as part of their base<br />
and it is a reasonably competitive situation so I think<br />
that, you know, generally speaking you can look at mortgage<br />
rates being stabilised. But I say that within the framework<br />
of the general answer. I've got to be cautious in that<br />
statement, Margaret, because the markets look very closely<br />
at what Prime Ministers and Treasurers say and it's very<br />
important that they understand what I've said and I repeat<br />
it, that we're not going to be sloppy about interest rates.<br />
I mean, there'd obviously be a temptation for some people<br />
not for us because we are pretty rigorous in the way we do<br />
these things. But there must be some sort of temptation to<br />
say ' oh well, wouldn't it be nice, you know, if we could<br />
bring interest rates off'. People would like that. well,<br />
I'd like it too, but I'm not going to do it before it's<br />
responsible to do it.<br />
PEACOCK: Well, I really appreciate you spending some time<br />
with us today. I haven't covered half the things I think I<br />
wanted to but I know time is pressing. I just wonder in a<br />
political sense it's sometimes not easy to keep a track of<br />
your words. I'm wondering if some of the statements you've<br />
made, whether you regret things. Like the child poverty<br />
statement, interest rates coming down statements, the<br />
billion trees planting statement, perhaps the flying hours<br />
that you had to do to become a pilot statement and putting<br />
your credibility on the line over the pilots. I'm just<br />
wondering if you ever just, sort of, -feel a smidge sorry<br />
that you said something?<br />
PM: Of course I feel, you know, there are some things that<br />
I've said before I was Prime minister and since I've been<br />
Prime Minister that I, in retrospect, I would have preferred<br />
: tatlI dsihndsi feetyou din' ondet I mean, ouibfn'<br />
ttalI dihsnasi do diffeenly MyneGodd ,. I meoanl, n ' foub<br />
you didn't concede that you're saying you're perfect-and<br />
I've never made that claim. For God's sake there's too much<br />
evidence to refute it if I tried to.<br />
PEACOCK: The child in poverty<br />
PM: well, I'm glad you let's go to that. What I<br />
regret about that is that the actual phrase in the speech,<br />
the election speech, was not the phrase which was in the<br />
fully developed document. In the attached document with the<br />
speech what was said that there'll be no financial need, but<br />
now we shortened that, there'll be no child in poverty.<br />
Now that, I believe, was. unfortunate because what we were<br />
saying is what, all that a Government can say. As I've<br />
. said, no politician could say ' no child will live in<br />
poverty'. I mean, I could provide $ 1000 to every low income </p>
<p>-12-<br />
family and create a situation, no financial need, but that<br />
still wouldn't mean that because a kid ran away from home or<br />
because the mother or father just went and, you know, did<br />
the wrong thing with it that there wouldn't be situations of<br />
poverty. What I was saying and what was spelt out in the<br />
full attached document that we would make decisions,<br />
Margaret, about making financial assistance available which<br />
would mean there would be no financial need for any child to<br />
live in poverty. Could I just<br />
PEACOCK: I've seen both of those statements and I realise<br />
that you said no need for a child to live in poverty-<br />
PM: No financial need.<br />
PEACOCK: And also no child will be living in poverty-<br />
PM: Yes. That shorthand phrase in the speech I consider,<br />
in retrospect, was unfortunate. I mean, we should have<br />
spelt out in the detail of what was all that a Government<br />
could do. That is, look after the financial side of it.<br />
Now I'd Just like, if I could, refer to, you know, the<br />
acknowledgement, the acknowledgement by the welfare<br />
industry that I've kept the promise that I made. I mean,<br />
without being exhaustive about it, just let me go to what's<br />
been said on that.<br />
PEACOCK: That doesn't really<br />
PM: Well,<br />
PEACOCK: I mean, I'm just gratified to hear that you regret<br />
that shorthand statement because, of course it was a very<br />
famous one. We've got to let you go in a minute Prime<br />
Minister. I just want to ask you<br />
PM: Just let me quote two of them. This is from ACOSS<br />
PEACOCK: Yes, I know ACOSS.<br />
O PM: ' The Prime Minister is correct to say that he has<br />
achieved the financial benchmarks for children and this is a<br />
major achievement'. I mean they are saying that and I think<br />
just the last word from Bishop Peter Hollingsworth where he<br />
refers to what we've done the achievements of what we<br />
promised and he said ' these reforms are too important to be<br />
caught in the crossfire of political conflict. The<br />
Opposition ought to openly acknowledge the merit of such<br />
reforms and move towards a more bipartisan stance on welfare<br />
policies for children'. I mean, we are now, Margaret,<br />
paying out over $ 2 billion a year and we've indexed these<br />
things. I mean, this is the absolute enormous dimension of<br />
our achievement, recognised as having done something that's<br />
been done nowhere else, matched the benchmarks that we set<br />
so that there is no financial need for a child to live in </p>
<p>-13-<br />
poverty. We've met that target ahead of time. what<br />
Hollingsworth is saying, this is enormous this achievement<br />
and he's saying to the Opposition ' for God's sake don't be<br />
so damned petty, acknowledge the magnificence of this<br />
achievement and get into a bipartisan situation on it'.<br />
PEACOCK: Election? When can we expect that?<br />
PM: Well, if you look back over all my statements it's<br />
quite clear that I've thought that 1990 is the most likely<br />
time and I think that's still the case.<br />
PEACOCK: Another couple of terms for Bob Hawke?<br />
PM: Certainly<br />
PEACOCK: ( inaudible)<br />
PM: busy time up in Malaysia and back here, but I<br />
still love it. I'll lead the Party into the next election.<br />
I believe that we'll win the next election, Margaret, and<br />
I'll lead the Government through that full term and then,<br />
you know, we can look at it after that.<br />
PEACOCK: Bob, lovely to spend time with you and I know that<br />
time is very precious for a Prime Minister and I appreciate<br />
it all the more for that reason. Thank you.<br />
PM: Thank you Margaret. It's always a pleasure to talk to<br />
you, thank you very much.<br />
