TRANSCRIPT OF PRESS CONFERENCE AT DIAOYUTAI STATE GUEST HOUSE<br />
BEIJING 19 MAY 1986<br />
PM: I have just completed a little over three hours discussion<br />
with Premier Zhao. As you would appreciate they have covered<br />
a wide range of international issues in the political area<br />
the economic area and of course a number of bilateral matters<br />
of importance to us. I think it is important to indicate at<br />
the outset that Premier Zhao in his opening statement indicated<br />
the very great significance with the Government of China attaches<br />
to building the relationship with Australia and as he put<br />
it to working in a way to realising the full potential of<br />
that relationship. He referred with pleasure the fact that<br />
since we last met there have been 20 ministerial visits between<br />
our two countries. There has been six completed technical<br />
co-operatio projects here, another 14 underway. He said that<br />
there have been notable developments in other fields. He mentioned<br />
in that context the development of the sister province relationship<br />
with the States, the developments in the area of civil aviation,<br />
the establishment of the operations of the Bank of China in<br />
Australia, the consular agreements whereby we have opened<br />
up in Shanghai and there is agreement now for the development<br />
of consular relations by China in Melbourne and Perth. He<br />
referred particularly with pleasure to the development of<br />
our consultation between China and Australia in a number of<br />
international forums in the way in which Australia had been<br />
able to be of assistance to China's interests in many of those<br />
areas. He referred to the developments in the four sectors<br />
iron, steel, wool and textile, non-ferrous metals and transport<br />
as well as coal. So in total there was a firm expression by<br />
Premier Zhao firstly of the fundamental importance attached<br />
to the relationship, the pleasure that they derived from the<br />
way in which there had been the significant developments to<br />
which* I refer. Now without going to all the details of the<br />
matters that were covered, let me say this, in the area of<br />
international political issues I referred to the importance<br />
that Australia attaches to disarmament issues and in that<br />
area expressed our satisfaction with the decision of the Chinese<br />
Government announced earlier this year to end atmospheric<br />
nuclear testing and also their decision to participate in<br />
any negotiations towards a comprehensive test ban treaty in<br />
the Committee on Disarmament. I also expressed on behalf of<br />
the Government of Australia our appreciation of the very positive<br />
response from China to the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone<br />
concept and welcomed the indication from Premier Zhao that<br />
China would become a signatory to the protocols of-the treaty. </p>
<p>I gave the Premier a run down on developments in the South<br />
Pacific area and included in that run down referred to the<br />
state of play, if you like, in regard to ANZUS between Australia<br />
and the United States of which you are aware and indicated<br />
that in the event that New Zealand proceeded to legislate<br />
in that area that the relationship and the commitment between<br />
Australian and the United States would continue as would the<br />
defence co-operative relations between Australia and New Zealand.<br />
There was, of course, a fairly lengthy exchange of views-between<br />
us on the position in Indo-China and as you know we have a<br />
co-incidence of view about the necessity for the withdrawal<br />
of Vietnamese troops from Kampuchea so that there can be the<br />
emergence of an independent, mutual and non-aligned Kampuchea.<br />
The Premier gave me a quite a detailed exposition of their<br />
perception of the state of Sino-Soviet relations and essentially<br />
what the Premier conveyed was that while there had been a<br />
development in the area of economic relations there was no<br />
question of the normalisation of political relations between<br />
China and the SoviEt Union until the three obstacles had been<br />
removed. The three obstacles the Soviet divisions on the<br />
border, Afghanistan and Soviet involvement in Vietnam. And<br />
he saw no move at this point to the removal of those obstacles<br />
and in that sense hie did not see any move towards the normalisation<br />
of relations. In the international economic area we found<br />
full agreement on the view that I had been expressing as you<br />
know in America, Europe and Japan the need for an early start<br />
to the new multilateral trade negotiations round and he expressed<br />
his gratification of the assistance that Australia was providing<br />
by way of technical assistance to the preparation by China<br />
for its application of GATT membership. We are providing a<br />
consultant experienced in these matters to train Chinese trade<br />
policy officials in this area. There was agreement not merely<br />
for the need for an early start to the new round but the importance<br />
within that round of including on the agenda items of importance<br />
to developing countries including of course the issue of agriculture.<br />
We discussed then a number of issues of bilateral importance<br />
without being exhaustive about that, we covered the area of<br />
iron and steel. We expressed mutual satisfaction with the<br />
very significant developments in the areas which have been<br />
identified two years ago. Those areas of trade in steel making<br />
raw materials, trade in semi finished steel, Chinese investment<br />
in the Australian iron and steel industry; * Australian investment<br />
in the Chinese iron and steel industry and technical co-operation<br />
in.-iron mining and steel. We re-affirmed the importance of<br />
the work of the joint study group in those areas. On the question<br />
of the negotiations in regard to Kwinana and Channar, we recognised<br />
that these were negotiations to be finalised between the enterprises<br />
concerned, that neither my Government nor the Government of<br />
China had the capacity to direct the enterprises in the area<br />
of commercial negotiations. We recognised that in regard to<br />
Channar in particular, the gap between the enterprises was<br />
narrow and we agre-ed as governments that we would by our actions<br />
as governments try and provide the appropriate framework within<br />
which those negotiations could hopefully be concluded. 3;.<br />
raised the question of possible Australian association with<br />
a number of particular projects Shanghai liquid waste project<br />
in which Australia has been involved in the earlier feasibility<br />
stages and in regard to which we have put forward a proposal </p>
<p>for assistance with the co-financing of the implementation<br />
of an aspect of that project. In the area of transport, also<br />
we made the same point in regard to the Dongdu Port where<br />
there has been a funding by Australia in the early feasibility<br />
stage of that project and we welcomed the assurance that depending<br />
upon the results of further feasibility studies that China'<br />
would be willing on the basis-of mutual benefit and equality<br />
to co-operate with Australia as a joint venture partner on<br />
the design and the financing, construction, management and<br />
operation of stage two of the Dongdu Port at Xiamen. I also<br />
raised the question in the context of the desire by China<br />
to reduce the imbalance in our trading relationship to the<br />
possibility of some of our resource companies perhaps contemplating<br />
the purchase of ships constructed in China for the purpose<br />
of carriage of goods in that trade if China were prepared<br />
in that context to contemplate some change in the exsting<br />
position where there is an insistence on the carriage of such<br />
goods in Chinese ships. And it was agreed that that was something<br />
which could be examined I also raised with the Premier the<br />
concern I have that there could be and should be a further<br />
development of exchanges between us in the educational field<br />
and he agreed with this and so we have undertaken that work<br />
will proceed at the officials level on this matter as a basis<br />
of leading up to the business here in September by our Minister<br />
for Education, Susan Ryan, as I do believe that there is more<br />
that can be done in that area. I also raised with Premier<br />
Zhao the desirability of including a double tax agreement<br />
and indicated that wo~ rk was going on at the official level<br />
He agreed that that work should be expedited and it was desirable<br />
to have an early agreement. Finally I thanked Premier Zhao<br />
for the extension of involvement of China in our Bicentennial<br />
celebrations in 1988, participation in Expo ' 88 and a number<br />
of other ways in which they intend to be associated with us<br />
including particularlIy the intended loan by China of two pandas<br />
to an Australian zoo which will be obviously a matter of great<br />
interest and attraction to people in Australia at periods.<br />
Colleagues, without being exhaustive, that I hope will give<br />
you an indication of the wide variety of subjects that were<br />
traversed, some in more detail than others in that three hour<br />
discussion. I simply conclude by saying that the discussions<br />
that I have had with Premier Zhao are a further indication<br />
of the closeness of the relationship between our two countries,<br />
our two governments and the commitment of both governments<br />
to intensify broadening and deepening that relationship. We<br />
will continue our discussions on the informal occasions that<br />
we will now have tonight and tomorrow when we will be together.*<br />
We will also continue further discussions in some of these<br />
areas with Chairman Deng and Secretary-General Hu Yaobang<br />
and Secretary Hu Chi. Li.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister is this the first time the Chinese<br />
have been involved....... iron and steel......<br />
PM: No, I think in the discussions that have taken place<br />
at the officials level and when the representatives of the<br />
forum countries visited the nuclear powers earlier China was<br />
the most positive and indicated their approval of the course<br />
of action that had been taken and I think this is merely,<br />
if you like, a confirmation of the indications that have been<br />
earlier given. It was the first direction confirmation at </p>
<p>the Premier to Prime Minister level. The second question Michelle,<br />
it is the case that as I said the Government doesn't control<br />
BHP and as I indicated parenthetically, I wasn't quite sure<br />
at the moment who does. But we certainly don't and the Premier<br />
indicated the same position as far as they were concerned<br />
that under the reform program that has been established the<br />
Government doesn't direct its commercial enterprises in matters<br />
of these kind. Now we can't therefore on either side say look<br />
this is what must happen. All we can do and will do is to<br />
indicate the fundamental importance that both governments<br />
attach to these developments and we will provide at our level<br />
all the official assistance that we can to, if you like, lubricate<br />
the negotiations so there is extremely positive attitudes<br />
on the part of both governments and I am optimistic about<br />
the due course and we can reach agreements in this area.<br />
JOURNALIST: Was there any discussion on time on either Kwinana<br />
or Ohannar?<br />
PM: No, simply the view that we hope that they could be achieved<br />
as soon as possible. I think it is fair to say that probably<br />
the gap that exists between the two enterprises in regard<br />
to Channar is the narrower and it would be more appropriate<br />
to expect an earlier positive outcome in regard to Channar.<br />
JOURNALIST:... PM: It is realist ic to have that hope but I emphasise that<br />
this is not a matter that we as governments can determine.<br />
It must be negotiated as a commercial matter between the enterprises<br />
concerned. But there is a recognition, let me say this, that<br />
we both re-affirm the importance of the long term inter-relationship<br />
of the development of our two industries.<br />
JOURNALIST: Did you go into Australia's competitiveness in<br />
relation to Brazil?<br />
PM: Yes. The point was made by Premier Zhao that....... Brazil<br />
we were much closer than Brazil. Therefore the shipping of<br />
the product should be cheaper. IT* made., the point in regard<br />
to the comparison with Brazil-that it.% is of course difficult<br />
if not impossible to intrude into the, economic calculous that<br />
one makes in these comparative matters the question of what<br />
weight you attach to relative political stability. But I made<br />
the point that nevertheless that was significant and asserted<br />
as I have in a number of discussions here and with other countries<br />
that there is when contemplating sources of supply, there<br />
is no country which is more politically stable than is. Australia.<br />
And it is appropriate that those considerations should be<br />
taken into account.<br />
JOURNALIST: Did the Premier bring up industrial relations?<br />
PM: No. They are fully aware of the magnificence of the improvement<br />
in industrial relations in Australia. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Did Premier Zhao as or indicate in anyway that<br />
he would like to change Australia's position in Kampuchea?<br />
PM: No. There was a recognition of the role that Australia<br />
has played and of the shared interest we have in the outcome<br />
of this matter and what needs to occur. I think it is fair<br />
to say that the Premier expressed his belief that there had<br />
been a strengthening of the position of the CGDK forces and<br />
he believed that that would lead to the sorts of result that<br />
we are talking about. Now that association that China has<br />
with elements of the CGDK forces leads them to that position.<br />
Perhaps they are better placed to be able to make an assessment<br />
as to the outcome of the pressure of the CGDK forces. But<br />
no there was no suggestion of wanting any change of view or<br />
role on the part of Australia.<br />
JOURNALIST: Just on iron and steel. What is your perspective<br />
of how serious the Chinese are in these discussions with Brazil.<br />
You mentioned that distance......<br />
PM: I think clearly and there has never been any suggestion<br />
at any stage of our discussions that China was going to say<br />
our focus is going to be exclusively on Australia. We have<br />
to be competitive and while China sees some obvious benefitsin<br />
development the relationship with us and that has been<br />
proved in the two years the sorts of things that have been<br />
happening to substantial developments. Nevertheless, they<br />
are going to look at relative advantages. Let me say this,<br />
this was not something that I went to in the discussion with<br />
Premier Zhao although it may well be that we will develop<br />
this point in some subsequent discussions. Let me say this,<br />
that it is well known that some of the developing sources<br />
of supply of raw materials have in the pricing policies which<br />
they undertake have not been strictly commercial in their<br />
assessments. They have a pressing need for foreign exchange<br />
to meet their debt servicing requirements. Now that is going<br />
to be a changing sort of situation and as for instance in<br />
Brazil you get increasing levels of activity within Brazil<br />
and demands for their products internally then you are going<br />
to see some changes I believe in pricing policies. Now what<br />
I am saying as far as Australia is concerned that w e are increasingly<br />
a competitive and reliable supplier and we do have the capacity<br />
which very few other countries have to provide a range of<br />
input and involvement in the whole area of the iron and steel<br />
industry both in terms of investment in this country and th..<br />
-provision of technical assistance. So it is our view that<br />
taking all these aspects into account it will lead to a continuing<br />
integration of our industries..<br />
JOURNALIST: When do you believe an agreement on Channar will<br />
be reached?<br />
PM: I can't answer that with precision. All I can say is<br />
that there is a recognition on both sides that the gap is<br />
small. It is a question of what should be the service charge<br />
for the facilities to be provided by Hamersley. There is a<br />
very narrow gap in that. One area of previous disputation<br />
and that is how the charges are indexed. I think that has<br />
basically been resolved and now it is a reasonably narrow<br />
gap. I hope that it won't be long but I haven't got a basis<br />
for giving you a date. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: On your previous trip here this initiative was<br />
presented very much in terms of an integration of the iron<br />
and steel industries of Australia and China. Do you think<br />
that when that was put forward that the Government underestimated<br />
some of the commercial factors relating to prices and competition<br />
and in any way do you withdraw from that sort of concept you<br />
were putting forward last time? Do you still think<br />
be realised despite the lack of progress.<br />
PM: Well, I don't accept that there has been a lack of progress.<br />
Neither side says there has been a lack of progress......<br />
which is completely unsustainable. I mean if you look at the<br />
areas that I have referred to. Let me remind you of them again.<br />
That is the trade in steel making raw materials, the trade<br />
in semi-finished steel, the mutual investment in the industrial<br />
and technical co-operation. In all of those areas very specific<br />
progress has been made. So I just repudiate that part of the<br />
premise of your questions. However, having said that Paul<br />
I acknowledge that in regard to the specific projects at Kwinana<br />
and Channar the process of finalising the commercial details<br />
has been longer. But I think both sides expected that1 t2i<br />
I have no reason having acknowledged that to change my belief<br />
that there is a recognition on both sides of the very considerable<br />
benefits there will be for both countries in an increased<br />
degree of integration of our two industries.<br />
JOURNALIST: The fact that those........ steel question?<br />
PM: No. I think the approach has been very sensible. And<br />
it is recognised by Premier Zhao and myself that the framework<br />
that has been established has worked. This is the joint consultative<br />
group has worked consistently, there has been a consistent<br />
interchange of missions between Australia and China. They<br />
have developed and there has been out of that consistent interchange<br />
of missions progress in integrating our industries in a number<br />
of ways provision of training facilities, the development<br />
of investment opportunities here in China. That work is going<br />
on and I think we have been very sensible therefore in the<br />
framework that has been established. Within that framework<br />
we have come to see that in regard to these two particular<br />
projects that both sides are going to try and ensure that<br />
they get the best commercial outcome that they possibly can,<br />
Now that is natural and as I say I repeat the hope that that<br />
can lead to a finalisation of those actual two projects.<br />
But the 1way in which we have gone about-it seems to me to<br />
be sensible.<br />
JOURNALIST:........ optimism about the eventual finalisation<br />
of Kwinana......<br />
PM: Well, on these two basic considerations, firstly that<br />
there is recognition on both sides of the very distinct possible<br />
advantages that can come from the finalisation agreement.<br />
And secondly that the movement in international factors in<br />
prospect can operate in a way to reduce the gap that currently<br />
r i 4i , r </p>
<p>7T<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, your talks this morning with your<br />
Cabinet colleagues........ Can you briefly tell us how<br />
they went and what were the results?<br />
PM: Very well. I indicated to my colleagues what should<br />
be the course of events. That has, of course, been accepted.<br />
Let me make these points, firstly as to the timing of<br />
the meeting. It is now being suggested that perhaps the<br />
meeting might be on Thursday, 5 June and I think that<br />
now subject to a cheque with the other participants of<br />
ACPI that is when the meeting would be. I have indicated<br />
as has Mr Bowen confirmed after the meeting that all<br />
matters that are important to the determination of the<br />
interests of this country are decided by Cabinet. That<br />
is where the decision will be made. Any minister that<br />
may have some desire to have an input in the process<br />
will do that via Mr Bowen. The actual preparation for<br />
the meeting, of course, will be for Mr Willis who is<br />
the Chairman of ACPI and with Mr Keating, the two ministers<br />
who represent the Government in that meeting. I will<br />
be kept informed to the extent necessary by Mr Bowen<br />
while I am away of any developments that I need to be informed<br />
of and of course I will pick the matter up directly on my<br />
return in a weeks time. The position I put to my colleagues<br />
was, of course, accepted.<br />
JOURNALIST:..........( inaudible)<br />
PM: I wouldn't think that that is in any sense necessary<br />
or likely. I have kept open that option. But essentially it<br />
has got to be understood, as I have said, this is another<br />
meeting of ACPI. Mr Willis is the normal chairman of that<br />
meeting. At this stage I don't, in the light of what I have<br />
said in discussions I have had with my colleagues, I don't<br />
see any reason t~ o be saying that I will.<br />
How much discussion was there on<br />
PM: Not an extensive discussion. The position that I think<br />
was put at the last meeting was that those who are the<br />
participants in ACPI will be able to raise any questions that<br />
they regarded as relevant and nothing has changed on that<br />
so we didn't need to have any detailed discussion about that<br />
Mike. JOURNALIST: What about in terms of Government proposals?<br />
PM:* Well, as far as the Government is concerned it will be<br />
largely a listing process. I think what we would do would<br />
be as is normally done with these meetings is to put a statement._<br />
on analysis of the economic position as it seen. That is what<br />
has been done in the past and it would be appropriate to do<br />
it again. Within that context some proposals may emerge from<br />
the parties. If they do then the Cabinet will consider them. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Will there be any....... consultation......<br />
PM: There may well be and certainly if either the employers<br />
or the ACTU want to have discussions it would be appropriate<br />
for them to raise matters with us. I don't know how far they<br />
would want to but consistent with what we have said in the<br />
past and we are open to what people may have to say to us.<br />
It is up to them if they really want to raise some matters<br />
in advance with us.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, can you tell us anything of what the<br />
ministers said in response to your statements?<br />
PM: Yes, I can say that there was, as far as I could tell,<br />
a complete acceptance of the course of action I proposed.<br />
JOURNALIST: Did any of the ministers complain about reports<br />
in this morning's papers?<br />
PM: There was one raising of that issue but very briefly.<br />
JOURNALIST : Who was that Prime Minister?<br />
PM: Mr Keating went to that issue but it was very, very brief.<br />
JOURNALIST: What was the import of his comment?<br />
PM: I am not going into that issue.<br />
JOURNALIST: There has been reports that there is a rift between<br />
you and Mr Keating......<br />
PM: Well, I think that the media has fairly assiduously for<br />
some time been reporting on this proposition. All I can say<br />
is this that as far as I am concerned I have made it clear<br />
both on Friday night during my discussion with Mr Bowen and<br />
then this-morning in my discussion with my colleages that<br />
this meeting has to be seen in its right perspective and that<br />
has been accepted by all ministers including Mr Keating. Now<br />
you can spend as much time as you like on trying to develop<br />
a proposition about rift. I don't think it would be very<br />
productive. As far as I am concerned I repeat now what I said<br />
to you before that I have complete confidence in Mr Keating<br />
as Treasurer. He has done an excellent job. I believe he will<br />
continue to do it.<br />
. JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, would you like to see some positive<br />
outcome from this meeting particularly in terms of policy,<br />
particularly given the extent of the trade problems?<br />
PM: Well, at any time when there is a meeting between Government<br />
and representatives of employers and the trade unions of course<br />
one likes to se. e agreement emerge. And that's why I have said<br />
that if out of this meeting some agreement can emerge on<br />
particular elements of policy then we Would want to consider<br />
that in the Cabinet. That's consistent with the way we have </p>
<p>approached economic policy making since we have been in Government.<br />
But I repeat and it is important that it be understood that<br />
as far as the actual decisions about economic policy are concerned<br />
they will be made in the Cabinet. And I can't see anything<br />
that will come out of this which will involve a radical redirection<br />
of policy. We have got the elements of policy there and in<br />
the implementation of that policy we may get some useful assistance<br />
as to developments of that out of the meeting, I don't know.<br />
But we certainly, as I said, think it appropriate that when<br />
there is an indication at that meeting as there was on Friday<br />
that they would like to have further discussion. then of<br />
course we will facilitate that.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, did you ask for or did any minister<br />
volunteer an explanation about how things could have got out<br />
of PM: No.<br />
JOURNALIST: PM: I have been around politics for so long that if I got<br />
carried away by a headline you would know where you would<br />
finish up. You may think headlines determine politics, I don't.<br />
JOURNALIST: gut your deputy is blaming<br />
PM: OK my deputy may be-doing that. If you have got a question<br />
that you want to ask him as to why he is doing that you direct<br />
the question to him. But you asked me about headlines. Let<br />
me make it quite clear, I have been around in public life<br />
now for a generation and if I had allowed what I see as a<br />
headline to upset me, to make me think that that is how policies<br />
are determined then I wouldn't be where I am now.<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you see it as a problem of media perception?<br />
PM: I think that the media or parts of it got somewhat carried<br />
away with what developed on Friday and I have tried gently<br />
in Tokyo and here to make the point that what happened on<br />
Friday is not terribly complex that a suggestion spontanesously<br />
arose about an extensionlof the meepting with employers being<br />
more involved in the discussion about economic policy that<br />
they thought they had been in the past. There was a positive<br />
response to ministers to that. That is what is going to happen,<br />
nothing more, nothing less.<br />
JOURNALIST:......... in saying yourself last night in a background<br />
briefing........ PM: I didn't hear what you said then.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, Mr Keating said that this meeting will<br />
be the most important held since the 1983 economic summit. </p>
<p>PM: I am not in a position to make that judgement. It is<br />
a very large statement to say it would be the most important.<br />
I think that it is useful that there is going to be that meeting<br />
and if agreement comes out of it then it can be significant.<br />
And I certainly don't want to create false expectations nor<br />
in any sense, as you can appreciate from anything I have said,<br />
want down grade the importance that people might attach to<br />
it who are going to be involved in the meeting. I hope that<br />
they will go into it with a view that they are going to be<br />
discussing what sort of things may be most appropriate for<br />
the economic health of Australia. And I congratulate those<br />
involved wanting to do that. How important it is going to<br />
be will depend on the meeting itself not what is said about<br />
it before. It is the meeting itself that will determine how<br />
important it is.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, what was Mr Keating's reaction to what<br />
PM: Well, I think it is fair if you want to get Mr Keating's<br />
reaction you should ask him. I don't think you have ever in<br />
the past had difficulty about talking to people that you want<br />
to Michelle.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, you have criticised the media<br />
PM: Hey, I haven't gone a media cri ticising thing. That is<br />
not my caper. I just think that there was a little bit of<br />
perhaps exaggeration about what had happened on Friday. But<br />
that is fair enough.<br />
JOURNALIST: But don't you think that Mr Keating has to bear<br />
some of the responsibility for that in the way that he handled<br />
the remarks......<br />
PM: You ought to know by now that I don't get into this exercise<br />
of trying portion blame when it comes to my ministers. All<br />
you will find me doing is giving credit to my ministers. And<br />
that is what I have done consistently since I have been in<br />
office. And that is what I am about. now.<br />
JOURNALIST: The panda initiative any more details on that?<br />
PM: No I haven't. It may be that our Excellency here, Ambassador<br />
Garnaut, may be a fuller bottle on the panda issue than I<br />
am.-All I know is that there is an enormous enthusiasm and<br />
excitement in Australia for the proposal as part of the<br />
