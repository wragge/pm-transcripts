BANANA IMPORTS REFUSED A3-V7.7<br />
Joint statement by the Acting Prime Minister and Member for Richmond,<br />
the Rt Fon. J. D. Anthony, M. P. and the Member for Cowper, the licn.<br />
I. L. Robinson, M. P.<br />
" Applications to import bananas into Australia from<br />
Pacific Islands and South East Asia have not been approved because<br />
of. the presence of diseases and pests in those areas", Mr. Anthony<br />
said. The Banana Growers' Federation made representations to<br />
Mr. Anthony expressing concern at the possible introduction of<br />
disease if banana exports were admitted.<br />
Mr. Anthony referred the matter to the Department of<br />
Health for investigation and a report has been submitted to the<br />
Minister. " The Department of Health has refused banana export<br />
applications from Western Samoa and Tonga on the grounds that the<br />
diseases and pests in those areas could endanger the Australian<br />
industry", he said.<br />
Mr. Anthony said a serious fungal. disease of banana lea: ves<br />
known as black leaf streak was widespread in the Pacific and South<br />
East Asian areas. " The presence of exotic fruit flies in the* Pacific Islands<br />
would require fruit to be fumigated before export and I understand that<br />
Western Samoa and Tonga are unable to meet Australian fumigation<br />
. equirements", he said.<br />
" The import applications for bananas from Ecuador have<br />
similarly not received approval, principally because of the<br />
possibility of ioko disease being introduced into Australia",<br />
Mr-Anthony soid. </p>
