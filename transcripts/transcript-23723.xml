    <content><![CDATA[<p>I’m pleased to be here in the Netherlands, although obviously there’s a certain sorrow which brings me here.</p>
<p>I’m here, first and foremost, to offer condolences to the government and the people of the Netherlands on the extraordinary loss that the Netherlands have suffered in the MH17 atrocity.</p>
<p>I’m also here to thank Prime Minister Rutte and his team – the police and military – for the magnificent way that they have led the police mission to the Ukraine.</p>
<p>I’m also here to say thank you from a grateful nation to the Australian police and military personnel who played such an extraordinary role in Operation Bring Them Home.</p>
<p>Obviously while here in the Netherlands, I’ll have an opportunity to talk to Prime Minister Rutte and other Dutch officials about the ongoing investigation into the shooting down of MH17. I’ll have an opportunity to talk to Prime Minister Rutte and his senior officials about just what needs to be done to ensure that the investigation is concluded, the guilty are punished, and justice is delivered to the grieving families of the 298 innocent people who were murdered on Flight MH17.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
