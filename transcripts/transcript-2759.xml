TEPORT TO Tr NATION<br />
Good evening. Just over two weeks ago the people of<br />
Australia gave the Australian Labor Party a clear mandate to put into<br />
effect the policies which I had set forth on behalf of the party<br />
during the campaign. The uncertainties and complexities of the<br />
Australian electoral system are such that it was not possible until<br />
this week to assemble the parliamentary party and elect the full<br />
ministry. But I believed it was essential that the new Government<br />
should waste no time in implementing its program, and therefore I<br />
formed an interim ministry with my Deputy, iMr. Barnard, A great<br />
many decisions were made, but I am anxious that it should not be<br />
thought that any of them were hasty or ill-considered. Every<br />
decision was a clear expression of the program on which we were<br />
elected, an expression of our unmistakable mandate. The question<br />
was simply whether there was any good reason for delaying action,<br />
in obedience to the people's will. I could find no good reason.<br />
The most important of our initiatives have been taken<br />
in the field of our relations with our neighbours, our friends and<br />
our allies, and in this area it was particularly urgent that any<br />
doubt or confusion about the intentions of the new Government<br />
should be set at rest immediately. How we have a ministry. I am<br />
delightd with the choice my colleagues have made. I am honoured<br />
and proud to be the Leader of this team. The leader not just of<br />
the ministry but of the many excellent men who have not been chosen<br />
but who will render great service to our nation as members of the<br />
Government. In the past two weeks I have been vastly encouraged by<br />
the help and co-operation given to us by all sections of the public<br />
service. It speaks volumes for the strength of Australia's democratic<br />
system that the loyalty and integrity of the public service can be<br />
transferred without question or qualification to a newly elected<br />
Government after 23 years of equal fidelity to another Government.<br />
A. d in this context I take the opportunity to congratulate ir. 3nedden<br />
t'Le new Leader of the Liberal Party and the Leader of the Opposition.<br />
i') nc knows better than I the burdens and can one say the<br />
rustrations of that high office. And none appreciates more than<br />
its crucial importance to the proper working of our democracy. / 2 </p>

Now the real work of Government begins. I believe exciting<br />
months and years are ahead for all of us. Abroad I believe we are<br />
already forging a new style and image for Australia nothing raucous<br />
or rash or abrasive but Australia is speaking with a firm, clear and<br />
independent voice and I believe we are being hoard with a new respect.<br />
At home we have already begun the restructuring, reinvigoration and<br />
modernisation of administration to equip Lustralia this great urban<br />
nation to meet the problems we face in the last quarter of the<br />
twentieth century. And let's not under-estimate the problems, the<br />
immediate ones, the long term ones. In particular, my G overnmont<br />
will spare no effort to restore genuine full employment in this<br />
country. Yet we must do this while continuing a battle to contain<br />
inflation. I'e are under no illusions about the difficulty of this<br />
double task. One of the worst aspects of inflation is that it is socially<br />
disruptive. It creates tremendous pressures for new wage and salary<br />
Cemands. Inevitably whole sections of the community people such as<br />
the retired, who are dependent on Governments for their income, and<br />
those on fixed incomes struggle behind in the race. And it is these<br />
social aspects of inflation the things that would weakcn unity and<br />
mutual goodwill among our citizens that, for the Australian Labor<br />
Party, give added urgency to the problem. For we do want the great<br />
theme of our Government to be the restoration of national unity, the<br />
ending of the weakening divisions whereby employees have been set<br />
against employers, the young against the mature, the parents and<br />
teachers of pupils at government schools against those at nongovernment<br />
schools. It was this determination, as much as anything<br />
else, that gives us pride in the fact that the first great decision<br />
of our Government was to end conscription, for perhaps its very<br />
worst feature was the way it created needless and harmful divisions<br />
in our community. And for the same reason it has given me tremendous<br />
satisfaction that history will show that our first major appointments<br />
were the highly qualified men and women who have agreed to give their<br />
time and talents to the work of the Interim Schools Committee. This<br />
committee has already set about with great enthusiasm its appointed<br />
task of ensuring that every Lustralian child who embarks upon secondary<br />
education next year will leave school with an equal start in life.<br />
I believe that the futile debate on State aid and State rights in<br />
education, which has divided our society for a century, is now ended.<br />
I last spoke to you. directly on the eve of the elections.<br />
I then said that I would seek and need the help of all sections of<br />
the Australian people in the task of leading this great nation.<br />
Everything I have seen and learnt in the past two weoks confirms<br />
that need. Together we can achieve great and good things for Australia.<br />
Mlay I wish you and your families a very happy Christmas<br />
and assure you that my Government will do its very best to ensure<br />
that we all have a prosperous iTew Year.<br />
CAIBER~ AE. A. C. T. </p>
