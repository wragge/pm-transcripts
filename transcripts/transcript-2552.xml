IAS TRALIAN MININC IND) USTRY C. OUNC IL<br />
Speech by the mime Minis-ter, The Rt Hon. W-illiam Mc?' ahon, M. P.<br />
Mr Prbident, Distinguished Guests and Gentlemen,<br />
This occasion offers both to my Government and to your Council,<br />
the chance to exchange views at first hand. The establishment of<br />
the Ki~ ning Industry Council just five years ago showed the importance<br />
you attach t1-o the communication of your views and trends in your<br />
industry to the National Government here in Canberra.<br />
For our part, we have for a considerable time now conducted<br />
regular consultations at the Cabinet level with the organisations<br />
representing the major groups in the economy. Your Council has become<br />
a more important part of these regular economic consultations in recent<br />
years, reflecting the dramatic increase in its conttbution to the<br />
national economy. We consider this direct consultation1 to be an<br />
important two-way stream of communication between the Government and<br />
other component parts of the economy. We want it to continue and<br />
develop, and I am sure you do too. You know the figures relating<br />
to the Mining Industry's contribution to the nation just as well as<br />
I do. Nonetheless, these figures need emphasis to a much wider<br />
audience. Since the mid-sixties the Mining Industry in Aus; tralia<br />
has trebledits performance in both total production and in its share<br />
of our export income. In 1965, the " ex an" value of mineral<br />
production was worth $ 542 million. By 1971, the figure was<br />
$ 1600 million. In 1965, minerals and metals brought us in about<br />
$ 300 million in export income. For 1970-71, the industry earned<br />
$ 1250 million overseas or about 29 per cent of total exports.<br />
These are impressive, and I am told that on present indications,<br />
there could be a further trebling of export earnings from mining and<br />
metals during the seventies to reach $ 3,500 million by 1980. Tib<br />
upsurge in mining activity and production of minerals which those<br />
figures describe has had the most significant effects on the growth<br />
and progress of this nation. Our ' jpattern of trade was transformed<br />
as the export contribution of minerals firstly overtook 1969<br />
wool, and has since continued to overtake the contribution of the<br />
whole of our other rural exports. T~ Iere are those who assert for<br />
example that without the minerals boomt of the late sixties and early<br />
seventies, Australia could have been faced with s _ vece balance of<br />
payments problems.<br />
That is the external picture. At home, there has been a matching<br />
development boom accompanying the great new m~ mmaq projects and<br />
involving new ports, hundreds of miles of new railway lines, and more<br />
than a dozen new towns have been created in remote parts of our<br />
continent. </p>
<p>It is clear from this that the mining industry has contributed<br />
very substantially to the broadening and diversification of the economy.<br />
But in more recent times, your industry has, along with other important<br />
sectors of the economy, suffered from the effects of the world currency<br />
realignmentheoThe Government has been concerned at the effects of this<br />
downturn in/ rate of development of world trade, and in particular, the<br />
effects of mineral production and mineral exports. On the production<br />
side, cost increases, falling demand and prices and currency realignment<br />
have had their effect on iron ore, coal, copper and lead. On the export<br />
side, we have seen the requests by* Companies to reduce below<br />
the quantities specified in contracts, the tonnages of iron ore and<br />
copper for delivery to their mills and smellfrs,.<br />
Now I said the Government was concerned about this situation and<br />
it may be asked,' well, what has the Government done Ve have taken<br />
a number of important initiatives, both to assist the major exporting<br />
industries generally and the mining industry in particular. Firstly,<br />
there was the question of the revaluation of the Australian dollar.<br />
In terms of pure monetary theory there could, of course, have been a<br />
full appreciation to the'dia.-. point of 8.57 per cent in the Australian<br />
dollar as against the American dollar. In reality, there was a<br />
situation where major mineral contracts were affected to the extent<br />
of approximately $ 8 million for each per centage point movement in<br />
the appreai-atioi_ of the Australian dollar; where our other primary<br />
industries faced difficulties in competition with other nations which<br />
had already devalued and where the success of the manufactured<br />
exports drive could have been affected. Above all, there was the<br />
impact on confidence in the community generally to be considered. At<br />
the time, confidence was not particularly strong, although I now<br />
believe that with fresh signs of the recovery showing up, confidence<br />
is being restored.<br />
That brings me to the second point. One of the stimulus measures<br />
we announced at the recent Premiers' Conference was the re-instatement<br />
of the investment allowance which was mentioned so generously here<br />
earlier tonight. As I am sure you are well aware, the Government is<br />
keen to see a greater degree of processing of our minerals, especially<br />
where this is economic and where it represents a rational use of<br />
resources. We have assisted this aim in a number of ways. There is<br />
the re-instatement of the investment allowance, which we believe will<br />
prove to be a big help to the mining industry in establishing<br />
processing and manufacturing plant. There is also our undertaking to<br />
provide about $ 80 million to the Queensland Government for the Gladstone<br />
power station of 1100 megawatts. We regard the establishment of this<br />
large-scale source of power as a catalyst for the further expansion<br />
of mineral processing at Gladstone. We stand ready to provide this<br />
finance, so long as the conditions stipulated are met.<br />
The third area of assistance has been in the decision to continue<br />
the financial assistance provided under the industrial research and<br />
development grants scheme for a further five year period from July.<br />
It is estimated that expenditure on this scheme, which is designed to<br />
encourage manufacturing and mining companies in Australia to increase<br />
the-i research and development spending, will be $ 60 million for the<br />
first five year VeriOd which began in 1967.<br />
Our fourth recent initiative relating to the mining industry<br />
concerned the Japanese requests for a cutback in iron and copper<br />
deliveries which I have already mentioned. The Minister for Tnational<br />
Development made representations to the Japanese Government tc ensure<br />
that our companies were treated no less favourably than companies from<br />
other countries in the negotiations over these requests. </p>
<p>There are, of course, other recent Government decisions and<br />
actions bearing directly on the mining industry. The Government is<br />
looking at the development of our Uranium resources with a view to<br />
achieving the maximum benefit from these resources to Australia. There<br />
may well be benefits in co-ordinated development.<br />
There have already been discussions between Commonwealth and<br />
State officials and the industry on the production and marketing of<br />
Uranium. We recently decided to provide a non-repayable capital grant<br />
of $ 2.5 million to Western Australia for the provision of a new ship<br />
which will help restrain the growth of transport costs in areas where<br />
many major mining projects are located.<br />
I notice that your council has this afternoon released a proposed<br />
five-point mining and conservation plan for consideration by<br />
Governments, both Federal and State. We are all aware of the growing<br />
interest in conservation and environment protection and it is encouraging<br />
to see a major industry group taking a lead to provide positive<br />
proposals. It is a responsible way to approach this question.<br />
Although, the States have the major responsibility in this area, I<br />
know your proposals will be most carefully considered. We are, as<br />
you know, in the process of forming a National Environment Council<br />
The other questbn I would like to mention to you tonight<br />
concerns our policy on overseas investment whichhas been the subject<br />
of some comment recently. First, I must say that overseas capital<br />
has had a great cal to do over the years with the expansion of our<br />
economy and the technological advancement of our industry. It has<br />
provided resources additional to those we have raised fromour domestic<br />
capital markets, and in particular has been highly important in<br />
sustaining our large-scale migration programme and, of course, it<br />
brings with it not only capital resources but also advanced technology,<br />
managerial skills and market connections. It is noteworthy that our<br />
largest mining companies are managed by Australians, men who have a<br />
close interest in the development of this nation.<br />
The other side of this large contribution to our development<br />
has been a significant measure of foreign ownership and control of<br />
our company assets. It has long been the Government's aim to ensure<br />
that Australians have the opportunity to participate in these foreign<br />
operations and I am sure most foreign corporations respect this<br />
attitude. Again, we have stood ready to prevent -specific takeovers<br />
of Australian-controlled companies if such takeovers are seen as<br />
against the national interest. Constraints under our guide lines have<br />
been placed on foreign companies borrowing here, both to conserve<br />
our domestic capital resources and to provide an additonal incentive<br />
to overseas companies to offer equity participation to Australian<br />
interests. There are, too, other causes of potential conflict arising out<br />
of capital inflow. These will be thoroughly investigated in a<br />
document being prepared by the Treasury, and nearing completion.<br />
The very substantial level of inflow in the last two years or so<br />
has created special problems for the successful pursuit of our<br />
national monetary policies. THis issue is al. o being closely examined.<br />
I have the personal belief that as time proceeds, Australians<br />
should undertake more investment opportunities overseas, and particularly<br />
in the Asian and Pacific region. Direct investment overseas,<br />
which for most practical purposes is not restricted,'. has in fact<br />
been increasing in recent years as Australian companies have been<br />
establishing nterprises in many countries overseas, particularly in<br />
/ 4. </p>
<p>New Zealand, South-East Asia and the Pacific, but also in the United<br />
Kingdom, the United States and elsewhere. We will be looking in<br />
particular, at the sharp increase which has recently occurred in the<br />
level of borrowing overseas and its impact on liquidity whether by<br />
Australian-owned or foreign-owned companies in Australia, which has<br />
contributed to the high level of capital inflow. It could be, for<br />
example, that increased borrowings fromlocal sources would help ease ' hany<br />
problems of excess liquidity arising from a level of inflow, and<br />
contribute to greater stability of our domestic economy<br />
In any review of this or other aspects of this important matter<br />
the Government would, of course, take all factors into consideration,<br />
including our over-riding wish to see the continued stable growth<br />
and development of the Australian economy. Many Australian companies<br />
have shown that they have the technical expertise and managerial<br />
knowhow to set up successful ventures abroad. Although the trend has<br />
been upwards in recent years the amounts involved have heen relatively<br />
small. They hive averaged some $ 60 million annually over the past<br />
years or so. I. sincerelyhope that the trends of recent years will<br />
improve. The Treasury at present has in hand an in-depth study on the<br />
whole subject of foreign investment in Australia. I dc not wish in<br />
any way to forecast what, if any, 9hanges in the Government's policy<br />
might eventuate as a result of its consideration of this study. I<br />
can, however, say that one of the aspects we will be looking at will<br />
be whether the very high level of capital inflow we have experienced<br />
over the past couple of years poses difficulties for the domestic<br />
management of the economy and, if so, whether there is need for a<br />
change in policies to forestall any danger of that kind.<br />
We believe the balance of the foreign contribution to our<br />
development has, over the years, been very much in our favour.<br />
Nevertheless, should it be demonstrated that in some measure the<br />
volume and form of the inflow of capital are not, in fact, enhancing<br />
the performance of the economy, we will, of course, review our policies<br />
and announce them in clear and understandable terms. But we will do<br />
so on the basis of fact and detailed analysis and against the philosophy<br />
that what we do will be in the best interests of this country.<br />
