4JJ,) AUSTRALIA J1 26 August 1974<br />
NATIONAL BROADCAST<br />
You will be aware that throughout last week the Cabinet met<br />
in Canberra to discuss the basic framework of this year's Budget.<br />
There is one unusual circumstance about the Budget this year.<br />
It is being introduced five weeks later than usual mid-September<br />
instead of mid-August. There's only one reason for the delay<br />
the unexpected onset of the May elections and the interruption<br />
of the normal business of Government and Parliament which resulted.<br />
So because of this delay I thought I should report to you<br />
tonight. I cannot of course give you a Budget preview that would<br />
not be the proper course. And, I want to emphasise that-the Budget<br />
is not intended to be some grand design for solving all the nation's<br />
problems. It isn't in itself a blueprint for the future. It's<br />
only part of our ongoing program and it's only part of our ongoing<br />
fight against inflation.<br />
We are framing a Budget well in tune with the needs of the<br />
Australian economy and the needs of the Australian people. And<br />
let me emphasise that we see those needs not only in the context<br />
of inflation. It is not enough just to beat inflation. We have<br />
to plan for the future, for the future of all Australians for<br />
our schools, our hospitals, our cities, our transport, our trade,<br />
our great resources. And this is what we are doing, laying the<br />
foundations for an even stronger fairer Australia.<br />
Our deeply considered view is that one battle, a major battle<br />
in our war on inflation, is being won. When we came into office<br />
in December 1972 we inherited the problem known as demand<br />
inflation that is, too much money chasing too few goods. Levels<br />
of spending were being fed by a flood of money from overseas and<br />
by the unjustified deficit in the 1972 Budget.<br />
My Government acted firmly to increase supplies by restoring<br />
full employment and by increasing the flow of imports. We also<br />
applied restraints to the flow of funds from abroad and to spending<br />
financed by borrowing. These measures have had steadily increasing<br />
effect and it can now be said that they are fully achieving their<br />
purpose. We are now closer to a balance between spending and the<br />
goods and services becoming available. </p>
<p>-2-<br />
It is therefore no longer necessary for the Budget to be<br />
actively restraining expenditure. We must of course be careful<br />
not to re-establish the conditions it has taken us so long to<br />
bring under control.<br />
The Government has therefore reviewed its plans for new<br />
expenditure with great care.<br />
SWe intend to proceed soberly but steadily with the programs<br />
which you have twice endorsed. We shall, for instance, go ahead<br />
with a greatly expanded program for the care and education of preschool<br />
children. We shall also begin a major restructuring of<br />
the taxation system to reduce the burdens on lower income earners<br />
and on single income families.<br />
In the fight against inflation, we shall not be using the<br />
weapon of mass unemployment in the way that previous governments<br />
have sometimes chosen to do.<br />
The spectre of masses and masses of workless should be<br />
laid to rest. We have in reserve a wide and flexible program<br />
to cope with such unemployment as will occur. On this point you<br />
can plan ahead for yourselves and your families with confidence.<br />
You will say: fine, but what about the rising prices we<br />
see around us. There are many elements in this, many causes.<br />
You know that all the major industrial countries share this<br />
problem with us some far worse. I have to be quite frank with<br />
you: inflation will not be wholly beaten until there is a worldwide<br />
solution. There is no complete national answer to this<br />
international problem least of all, in a democracy like Australia.<br />
For Australia there is the further complication of the Federal<br />
system, and the national government does not have the constitutional<br />
power to act directly on prices and incomes.<br />
The most serious element in Australia's inflation is that<br />
very large wage and salary increases, sometimes thoroughly excessive,<br />
are pushing up costs and therefore pushing up prices. Quite bluntly,<br />
the Australian economy in 1974 just cannot absorb wage and salary<br />
increases of 20 per cent and 30 per cent without large increases in<br />
prices. Now this is a matter involving all of us. It cannot be<br />
shrugged off as a problem for the Government alone. We cannot<br />
solve this problem single-handed. We cannot solve it without<br />
co-operation and commonsense.<br />
The national Government can do much. We are doing much.<br />
We've strengthened the Prices Justification Tribunal. Only last<br />
Friday we at last secured the passage of the Trade Practices Act<br />
which will protect the customer and prevent price fixing agreements<br />
by companies. This legislation could have been passed a year ago<br />
except for continued and repeated obstruction in the Senate. We<br />
are carefully studying proposals for tax penalties on companies<br />
which grant excessive wage demands. </p>
<p>-3-<br />
But the really important thing is for all Australian<br />
employers and employees to grasp the ultimate futility of<br />
grossly excessive demands which are just eaten up by inflation.<br />
It is not only a matter of the effect it has on yourselves and<br />
your families, but the consequences to fellow Australians, not least<br />
fellow working Australians. The simple fact is that if certain<br />
industries are priced out of existence then men and women will be<br />
thrust out of work.<br />
Further, it is quite unacceptable that the strike should come<br />
to be regarded as the court of first appeal. It is quite<br />
unacceptable that unions or companies should use their muscle<br />
power in key industry to gain short term advantage at the expense<br />
of their fellow Australians. These are not particularly palatable<br />
things for me to say, but we have to face the facts.<br />
I know the pressures, I know the temptations and they are<br />
certainly not diminished by scare tactics and rumour-mongering<br />
of the sort we have had recently. But it is a time for care and.<br />
responsibility by all of us for our own sakes as well as our<br />
fellows' and our families'-sakes.<br />
The national Government fully accepts its responsibilities.<br />
The State governments too have their responsibilities. And there<br />
are things that we can all do. For instance it is important that<br />
customers should resist unfair price rises whenever possible.<br />
As long as sellers of goods believe they can pass on to buyers<br />
whatever costs they agree to accept or whatever profit margin they<br />
care to impose, prices will continue to rise. Every time you forgo<br />
a purchase because the price is too high, you strike a blow against<br />
inflation. Let me sum up: the Budget, like our whole program is based<br />
on certain principles. There are four very important ones.<br />
As I have already said, we are not going to resort to mass<br />
unemployment. Secondly, we will protect the weaker sections of the community.<br />
Last month's $ 5 increase in the pension, the largest single increase,<br />
by any measure, in Australia's history, is an earnest of our<br />
determination. Thirdly, the most help will be given to those most in need.<br />
Fourthly, where we seek restraint we shall seek it from the<br />
strongest, from those best able to share the load.<br />
When you returned my Government just three months ago,<br />
I told you that together we would face some difficult times and<br />
difficult decisions. We Australians have faced infinitely more<br />
difficult times together in the past. Difficult decisions are<br />
an inevitable part of the task of any government worth its salt.<br />
My Government, the government you confirmed in office a mere three<br />
months ago, will neither flinch from difficulty nor exaggerate the<br />
difficulty. And if I know anything of the character of the<br />
Australi an people, neither will you. </p>
<p>In particular, don't let yourselves be used by people<br />
or groups who have a vested interest in creating panic,<br />
division or confusion.<br />
The fact remains that despite inflation, the vast majority<br />
of Australians have a higher standard of living than they did<br />
twelve months ago. Even average weekly earnings have risen 3<br />
per cent more than the cost of living. Of course we can do<br />
better than that and we shall all of us. The important thing<br />
is that we are a skilled, intelligent people living in a country<br />
with great basic resources.<br />
It is a time for care, yes; but certainly it is not a<br />
time for despair. Given the commonsense and steadiness which<br />
I believe are part of the Australian character, given reasonable<br />
time for the Australian Government's whole program of renewal<br />
and reform to take full effect, we can be assured of a bright,<br />
confident future together.<br />
