<p>E&amp;OEâ¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, the World Trade Organisationâs ruling in favour of our sheep farmers is very good news.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Itâs very good news.  The first bit of international trade justice Australian farmers look like getting for a long time.  There is time for appeal by the Americans and they have that right and the thing wonât be finally resolved until December.  But the Government has always thought that the American position was wrong.  Thatâs why we fought so hard in the World Trade Organisation on behalf of Australian farmers.  And Iâm keeping my fingers and toes crossed, as are farmers all around Australia, that at long last there may be a modicum of international trade justice for them.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Would you urge The Americans not to bother with the appeal because they donât have a very high success rate - appeals from the World Trade Organisation.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>The Americans play it very hard when it comes to trade.  They will appeal.  If theyâve got a right to appeal they will appeal and I hope that what has been provisionally given to the Australian lamb producers is kept.  It was always wrong, the imposition by the Americans.  We always thought it unfair and thatâs why Iâm so encouraged and I congratulate the Trade Minister Mark Vaile and his department on the work that they have done on behalf of Australiaâs lamb producers.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>There is the vexatious matter of compensation.  Would you beâ¦â¦</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well itâs too early for me to be talking  about that.  There is a process.  I respect that process.  And itâs in the interests of Australian lamb producers that I continue to respect that process.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, the cuts to the ABCâs news and current affairs budget arenât going down too well in the bush.  Are they justified?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well that is a matter you should question the ABC about.  We provide the ABC with a good budget and itâs up to the ABC as an independent broadcaster to decide how the money is allocated.  I was not at the board meeting, I was not consulted, and I shouldnât be.  You really have to take that up with the ABC.  Iâm not going sit in judgement on the independent authority of the ABC.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>On the issue of Trish Crossin [inaudible], whatâs your understanding of that situation and do guidelines need tightening there?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I know nothing more of that incident than what has been in the press and I donât have any comment on it.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Not another case where guidelines need to be looked at?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I donât have any comment on it.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Do you think it was proper use of the car?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I donât have any comment on it.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Is there any disquiet amongst the parliamentary Liberal Party backbench about just generally guidelinesâ¦..?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Nobody has raised concerns with me.   Thank you.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>One last question.  On the trade matter, the process we appear to have had with this win, and if the appeal doesnât succeed, that would go a long way do you think in silencing the critics about our involvement with the WTO on freeing upâ¦</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well one swallow doesnât make a summer.  But itâll be good, itâll be really great because Australian farmers have had a terrible time on the international trade field for a long long time and it will encourage them to believe that there is a modicum of international trade justice.  Thank you.</p>
