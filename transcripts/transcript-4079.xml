PERTH CHAMBER OF COMMERCE<br />
THE CONFEDERATION OF WESTERN AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRY<br />
Luncheon March, 1976<br />
Address by the Acting Prime Minister<br />
and Leader of the National Country Party<br />
RT. HON. J. D. ANTHONY </p>
<p>If you cast your mind back to 1972 you will rnembe2<br />
that it was a year when Australia's mineral industry had<br />
just completed a decade or more of the most spectacular<br />
development in our history. It seemed poised for a further<br />
surge of the same sort of development.<br />
The Weipa and Gove bauxite projects, the Bass Strait<br />
oil and natural gas fields, the Bowen Basic black coal<br />
projects, and many other projects had come into production<br />
or were comnitted. Here in Western Australia, the great<br />
iron ore projects, the Kambalda and Scotia nickel mines,<br />
the Jarrahdale and Del Park bauxite projects, the Kwinana<br />
nickel refinery, and the Kwinana and Pinjarra alumina<br />
refineries had been established.<br />
These were the projects of the preceding decade.<br />
Ahead of you was the prospect of the enormous potential<br />
arising out of the gas discoveries on the North West Shelf.<br />
It has been said before, but it bears repeating, that<br />
in this State you have what is probably one of the most<br />
remarkable combinations of mineral resources the world has<br />
ever seen: natural gas, iron ore, nickel, uranium and<br />
bauxite in great abundance, and a host of other minerals<br />
in varying amounts copper, zinc, manganese, vanadium,<br />
mineral sands and salt. In Queensland major deposits<br />
of high grade coking coal and in the Northern Territory<br />
major deposits or uranium also offered prospects for major<br />
new developments. At the time the feeling had grown in the community<br />
that nothing could hold back the realisation of that great<br />
potential. But something, or someone, arrived on the<br />
scene with a stultifying influence on development plans.<br />
A different political philosophy and a different economic<br />
approach were brought to bear. Important decisions were<br />
deferred. This was then compounded by the worst slump in<br />
the world economy since the Second World War and the greatetL<br />
inflation that Australia has ever experienced.<br />
The net result was that in the period after 1972, -he<br />
momentum of the development and exploration of the previous<br />
decade began to falter. The prospect of further spectacula'<br />
developments began to look less promising. The development;<br />
that did take place was on projects that were already ii, t:<br />
pipeline. The Liberal-National Country Party Government feels<br />
strongly that Australia cannot afford to allow that momentu,:<br />
to be lost. To a large extent our standard of living<br />
depends upon it. If we are to improve our standard of livi.. . g<br />
we will have to increase our imports, and the simple fact i.-<br />
that we can only do that on a permanent basis if we also<br />
increase our exports. / 2 </p>
<p>The mineral industry provides us with the most likely<br />
prospect for substantially incrcasing our export inco'-, e<br />
in future and generating growth in our domestic economiy.<br />
We must also look at our crude oil production. Althouglh<br />
this is not exported, it has the same effect on our balance<br />
of payments. Last year it enabled us to avoid import<br />
spending in the vicinity of $ 1500 million. We must find<br />
and develop new deposits, or other sources of energy that<br />
we can substitute for oil, or face the prospect of a growiL,-<br />
dependence on overseas oil and a massive growth in our<br />
import bill.<br />
If we want a graphic illustration of just how import4Ianimour<br />
oil and minerals are in this regard, we have only to<br />
look at the way we were bailed out of trouble by our mineral<br />
export income during the 1970/ 71 wool slump, and how we weri'<br />
cushioned from the worst effects of the energy crisis by<br />
the availability of a domestic supply of crude oil.<br />
Because our balance of payments at this stage is healthy<br />
we should not be complacent. If we are to secure our future<br />
we must look ahead. A rough rule of thumb is that it takes<br />
years from the commencement of exploration before a project<br />
comes on stream and five years from the date of the discovery.<br />
In our exploration we should therefore be thinking 10 years<br />
ahead, and in the development of known deposits five years<br />
ahead. The contribution that minerals make to our balance of<br />
payments is, of course, not the only benefit to be derived<br />
from such developments. You are all well aware of the great<br />
benefits for regions, for states and for the nation that<br />
they bring.<br />
Nor is it only our own welfare that is at stake.<br />
The customers for our minerals are also affected by what<br />
we decide to do in our minerals industries. As a nation<br />
rich in resources, we have a real responsibility to nations<br />
which lack them and need them. Japan in particular is<br />
vitally affected. The Australian and Japanese economies h'E<br />
over the space of 20 years developed a marked complemerit--ari&gt;.<br />
Overall Japan takes about 50% by value of mineral exports,<br />
and in the case of coal and iron ore about 75% and 78%<br />
respectively. Clearly what concerns one of us concerns ano<br />
affects the other.<br />
All this means that we must proceed with the develc~ pme:--<br />
of our mineral resources. Certainly I place great importan-, c<br />
on restoring the minerals industry to its proper role in<br />
Australia's economic development. / 3 </p>
<p>This does not mean, however, that the Government: will1<br />
be uncritical in its examination of new projects. Amiongst<br />
other things, -the Government will want to be satisfied that<br />
the rights and needs of the Aboriiinal people are safeguarded.<br />
There will need to be adequate protection of the enviroriipentL.<br />
Before major projects are undertaken we will want to be as<br />
sure as we can be that a market exists for major additions<br />
to output, at reasonable prices. Projects that merely<br />
displace existing Australian producers, or that force down<br />
prices in a scramble for sales, will transfer the benefits<br />
of our resources to our foreign consumers and bring little<br />
if any benefit to ourselves.<br />
Further and this is a point I felt it necessary to<br />
emphasise, when I was in Japan a few weeks ago'-the<br />
Government will want to ensure that arrangements entered<br />
into between Australian exporters and overseas buyers do not<br />
prejudice Australia's interests. We will retain the existing<br />
export control arrangements and, if necessary, use them.<br />
The Government also will want to be satisfied that<br />
development proposals meet its foreig n investment policy<br />
guidelines. We recognise that foreign investment can bring<br />
advantages that might not otherwise be available. And we<br />
should continue to welcome foreign investment that is<br />
mutually advantageous to Australia and the foreign investor.<br />
But at the same time we must not lose sight of the legitimate<br />
aspirations of the Australian people towards Australian<br />
ownership of our natural resources.<br />
Subject to being satisfied on these points, the Government:<br />
wishes to see new projects proceed, and is taking urgent<br />
steps to ensure that they do so.<br />
One of the first of these steps was my visit to Japan.<br />
It was of the utmost importance that we clear away any<br />
doubts that Japan had about Australia's trading policies. I<br />
wanted to restore the former harmony in our relations with<br />
our most important trading partner as early as possible.<br />
As I have stressed again and again, Japan needs an<br />
assured and stable supply of raw materials and energy sources<br />
at reasonable prices. We have the potential to give he-r<br />
the security and stability she needs. But we can only do<br />
so if she in return gives us an assured and stable market<br />
at reasonable prices for our output of these materials.<br />
So on the one hand I sought to restor * e confidence in<br />
Australia as a reliable and willing source of supply; on<br />
the other I sought to be assured that if we expanded our<br />
industry to meet Japan's needs, the Japanese market would<br />
have the growth potential and the certainly to absorb our<br />
additional output. / 14 </p>
<p>In Japan I found a very obvious desire to co-oore4--te<br />
with us and I believe that my purposes were achieved to a<br />
very satisfactory degree.<br />
Another step, and one which I consider fundamental to<br />
netting development under way, is to restore consultation<br />
the Commonwealth and State Governments and between<br />
the Commonwealth Government and the mining companies. Quite<br />
clear. ly, the Commonwealth Government, the State Governments<br />
industry each have important roles to play in the<br />
dev.' lopment and operation of the mineral industry. If we<br />
are to restore the industry to its proper role in the nation's<br />
development, it will be most effectively done if<br />
:, ct together to see how we should best go about it.<br />
1. have already taken steps with my State Government<br />
-*.: nte. rparts to revive the Australian Minerals Council<br />
Ind'. i have had very many meetings with industry<br />
rpresentatives in the last two or three months.<br />
All of this, however, in no way runs counter to the<br />
_ act that the Commonwealth Government generally looks to the<br />
4. aivte sector to seek out trading opportunities, to find<br />
resources, to marshall capital, to develop projects and<br />
ng2o tiate and carry out contracts.<br />
Western Australia, with the very great potential of<br />
ineral resources, is affected to a very special degree<br />
the question of getting development going again. I have<br />
the last few days in the northern part of your State.<br />
cl: ays, I have been amazed by the sheer scale of the<br />
n and of what it promises in terms of resource develctl'..:,'..<br />
. it to the area leads me to make some comments on mattr.<br />
articular interest to Western Australia.<br />
P ; otroleum exploration is a classic example of the<br />
I have been discussing. The confidence of the in-t:<br />
been seriously eroded over recent years, largely becau-e<br />
, uncertainty about the role of the Government, and about<br />
'-nq and export policies. Compared with 38 exploration<br />
-drilled offshore in 1972, only 19 wells were drill. ed i,<br />
This decline is also clearly reflected in the numbel.<br />
' 7oration vessels actually working on our coast. Only<br />
-an Digger is now operating, on the North West Shelf.<br />
' r six were operating a few years ago. Two Australiantied<br />
up for lack of work. One of these is th'e<br />
which was completed last year at Freemantle.<br />
a restoration of confidence and as qui'-.'<br />
But it cannot happen overnight. It takes<br />
s of companies to be put into effect..'ø.<br />
' ation of great economic difficulty. </p>
<p>One significant way of encouraging further exploration<br />
and development is by allowing lim'Ited exports of natural<br />
gas. I took some soundings in Japan about the prospects of<br />
sales from the North West Shelf. Japan's requirements of<br />
LNG will double between now and 1985, but the bulk of their<br />
requirements are already securod. However, they are looking<br />
to Australia to meet some of the balance. I explained to<br />
the Japanese that our Government's policy will be to allow<br />
reasonable quantities of exports of LNG on a commercial basis.<br />
The way is therefore now open for companies concerned to<br />
explore the sales prospects in greater depth.. I hope that<br />
arrangements mutually satisfactory to both countries can be<br />
concluded at an early date.<br />
I must say the way in which Japan is using LNG<br />
is tremendously impressive. They have put this very clean<br />
and efficient energy source to use for domestic and<br />
industrial purposes and for power generation. The LNG<br />
terminal I saw on Tokyo Bay is supplied by seven tankers<br />
which operate continuously between Japan and Brunei. The<br />
terminal supplies five million households as well as<br />
industry, and fuels a power station which is part of the<br />
Tokyo Electric Power Company system supplying thirty three<br />
million people in the Tokyo region.<br />
The major significance of the North West Shelf gas,<br />
especially for Western Australia, is very well appreciated in<br />
Canberra. The Shelf holds about 50% of Australia's known<br />
reserves of gas. The development of the project will be one<br />
of major proportions running into thousands of millions of<br />
dollars including the necessary pipelines and the new end user<br />
industries in Western Australia, including the Pilbara. The<br />
development will thus have a very big impact on the economy<br />
of Western Australia in the years ahead. Unfortunately,<br />
Decause of the attitudes of the previous Commonwealth<br />
Government, much valuable time has been lost with drastic<br />
effects on the development costs the companies will now face.<br />
I have already had discussions with the Woodside-Burmah<br />
representatives, and also with the State Government, on ways<br />
and means of getting the consortium's project off the ground.<br />
The companies have been reviewing their production and marketing<br />
plans and I hope these will be available for consideration by<br />
both Governments at an early date. The Commonwealth Government<br />
will work very closely with the companies and the State<br />
Government to ensure that the necessary decisions can be<br />
expedited. 6 </p>
<p>The Commonwealth Government is also working with<br />
the State Government to find other vays of increasing<br />
exploration offshore. Some applications for permits are<br />
currently under consideration. As announced by Mr.<br />
Nensaros in January, plans are in hand to call applicatioriS<br />
for permits over large areas of the North West Shelf<br />
relinquished last year during the renewal. processes.<br />
Australia's present known petroleum reserves are quitc--<br />
inadequate. It is only by a major revival in exploration<br />
that we stand a chance of making the large discoveries so<br />
essential for Australia's future needs.<br />
Turning to iron ore, we find that after a period<br />
of unprecedented expansion in steel output, Japanese<br />
production has fallen well below earlier estimates. Thi1s<br />
has led to a downward revision of forecast steel output<br />
over the next few years. This means Japan needs less raw<br />
material than expected. But there is optimism that the latterhalf<br />
of this year will see the start of a recovery in dcmand<br />
for steel. And it should strengthen next year. In other<br />
important steel markets a similar recovery is forecast. The<br />
International Iron and Steel Institute expects steel<br />
consumption this year to rise by 11% in the and<br />
by 15% in the United States, over last year.<br />
Details given to me of the Japanese steel companies'<br />
forward construction programmes indicate that there will<br />
be opportunities for additional iron ore sales. As it<br />
takes some time to bring new mines into production I expect<br />
that new contracts with Japanese mills will be signed fa2",* Ly<br />
Soon. In Japan I stressed that as Australia is an efficic!-rand<br />
stable supplier and has the advantage of geographical.<br />
proximity, the Japanese should consider the benefits of<br />
increasing the proportion of iron ore requirements taken f:.<br />
Australia. As well as Japan, promising markets are also being<br />
developed for Australian iron ore in Europe, the People~ s<br />
Republic of China, the Republic of Korea and the United<br />
States. I am confident that other new markets will emiergc<br />
in the future, particularly in nearby countries in our r~&gt;<br />
But the iron ore market will continue to be very<br />
competitive. Iron ore is an internationally-traded conmmodiZy,<br />
To maintain our world rating status we must maintain o-ur<br />
competitive position. We cannot take continued growth o<br />
granted. But it will occur if we remain an efficientrlUZ:<br />
and stable supplier. / 17 </p>
<p>7.<br />
For my part I will be doing my utmost, in co-operation<br />
with the Western Australian Governrent~ to bring into being<br />
as many of the potential iron ore expansion proposals as<br />
can be reasonably accommodated by assured markets. The<br />
Federal Government also supports the upgrading and<br />
processing of Australia's~ iron ore resources where this<br />
is economically practicable. In time, I expect that natural<br />
gas from the North West Shelf will play a very important<br />
role in such processing.<br />
The immediate development picture in regard to nickel<br />
is a more promising one, with the Agnew Partners having<br />
decided to take the initial steps in that project. In<br />
looking at this project the Government will want to look<br />
also at the prospects of the early development of a smelter<br />
and at the longer-term prospects for a refinery.<br />
Mineral sands is an area where there has been<br />
considerable development in Western Australia recently.<br />
With the open:-ng up of deposits and some expansion, this<br />
State is on the verge of becoming the leading producer<br />
of mineral sands.<br />
Currently the industry has marketing problems, particularly<br />
for ilmenite and zircon, your two main products. It is a<br />
great pity that the large-scale expansion of the industry<br />
in this State has coincided with the economic recession in<br />
Western economies. Big tonnages are available for export<br />
just when the market is weak. I hope that further development.<br />
can be timed to come in when markets are more buoyant.<br />
These four case studies petroleum, iron ore, nickel<br />
and mineral sands indicate that getting development going<br />
again will not always be easy. It will require initiative<br />
by industry and by Government. Above all it will require<br />
co-operation between the Commonwealth Government, the State<br />
Government and the companies concerned. But there can be<br />
no doubt that very great opportunities exist if we have the<br />
wit and will to grasp them. I leave with you the -thought<br />
as I leave it with our overseas trading partners whenever<br />
the opportunity presents itself that Australia under<br />
this Government will be a secure, dependable and predictable<br />
source of the resources that underpin the world economy.<br />
Thank you for your hospitality. It had been my hope<br />
to have visited Western Australia earlier this year, but<br />
circumstances arose which did not allow this to happen. To<br />
my long-suffering and very understanding hosts I say a<br />
special word of thanks. And thank you all for this<br />
opportunity to speak to you. </p>
