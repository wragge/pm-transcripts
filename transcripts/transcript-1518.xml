STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE RT. HON.<br />
HAROLD HOLT, IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES<br />
7TH MARCH, 1967<br />
TASMANIAN BLJSHFIRE AID<br />
I desire to inform the Wnuse that I have this day informed<br />
the Premier of Tasmania that the Govorrinent has agreed to his<br />
to provide special financial ac-sistanc. to the State of Tasmania L&amp; c. rdance<br />
with the broad terms and conc.. iions sez out in the report b. y Offfcers<br />
of the Tasmanian Government and agrcc~ d to by officials of the ( Comi-n-nowealth<br />
Government, based on the case presented on behalf of the Govera;.; S,, flC of<br />
Tasmania. As agreed, the measures of assistance that will be introduced<br />
will be State measures with the Commonwealth standing behind the State to<br />
provide adequate support for the State's ove: 41al financial position. Ti'is<br />
would accord with the arrangements agree-with the States of New South Wales<br />
and Queensland in connection with assistance for drought measures.<br />
Estimates of the maximum assistance likely to be required by<br />
the State indicate that the total amount that will have to be provided by the<br />
Commonwealth will be about 14.5 m~ illioni dollars. This estimate is, however,<br />
tentative and may be subject to substantial revision.<br />
As in the case of the drought measures, the Commonwealth's<br />
overall financial assistance to the State will be provided partly by way of<br />
interest-free loans and partly as grants according to the proportions in which<br />
the State's own expenditures, under the various measures, take the form of<br />
loans and grants respectively. Loans made by the Commonwealth will be<br />
interest-free and have a term of fifteen years. Repayments will be sought<br />
in twelve equal instalments over the last twelve years of the loans.<br />
The Commonwealth is proposing to provide loans to the State<br />
free of Interest on the understanding that the State will charge interest, where<br />
appropriate, on advanm for housing and loans to businesses and primary<br />
producers. The interest received by the State is regarded as being available<br />
to enable the State to meet any losses arising from bad debts. We also<br />
expect that any excess of interest received by the State over its requirements<br />
should be applied to reduce its dependence on special grants.<br />
As soon as possible a Bill will be presented to the Commonwealth<br />
Parliament to authorise payments of Commonwealth financial assistance to<br />
Tasmania. I expect that the bill will be drawn in general terms to authorise<br />
a grent and a loan to the State of Tasmania for measuires associated with the<br />
f ire. In the meantime, our officers will continue to be in contact on<br />
detailed arrangements. From the outset I have, on behalf of the Commonwealth, assured<br />
the Tasmanian Government and people that the Commonwealth Government<br />
would approach their difficulties in a helpful and, indeed, a generous fashion.<br />
I knew that this would be supported by the people of Australia as a whole. I<br />
am glad, therefore, to be able to report to the House that we have met in<br />
substance the requests which have come to us from the Government of Tasmania<br />
and we hope that this quite substantial assistance will quickly enable the<br />
people of that State to be restored to full economic operation. </p>
