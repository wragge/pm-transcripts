PRIME MINISTE<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING, MP<br />
THE VALUES MR HOWARD'S POLLSTER TELLS HIM TO BELIEVE IN<br />
Anyone reading Mr Howard's document cannot fail to be impressed by the<br />
number of things he believes in at least for now, in these times, which he<br />
hopes will suit him.<br />
Yet the document leaves many questions unanswered. There is no mention<br />
of Christmas, for example. Does Mr Howard not believe in Christmas? There<br />
is nothing on gardening or intergalactic travel.<br />
I have no doubt that Australians will find many other things Mr Howard does<br />
not mention and they too will ask themselves if he does not believe in these<br />
things, does he believe in anything at all.<br />
