PRIME MINISTER Press Statement No. 488<br />

PRIORITIES REVIEW STAFF REVIEW<br />
The Prime Minister Mr Whitlam today announced<br />
that he had asked for an urgent review of the Australian<br />
Government's income maintenance and allied schemes,<br />
including their relationship with the general social<br />
security system, and its schemes for structural<br />
adjustment assistance to employers. The review will<br />
be carried out by the Priorities Review Staff.<br />
Mr Whitlam said that the Government had<br />
introduced various programs to aid structural adjustment<br />
in both metropolitan and non-metropolitan areas.<br />
Mr -Whitlam said that these programs had done a great<br />
deal to mitigate financial and social hardships associated<br />
with long-term adjustments but that problems and<br />
anomalies have arisen as economic circumstances have<br />
changed. Mr Whitlam said that there was now a need to<br />
take stock of the various programs in operation. He<br />
emphasised that the Government would filfil its obligations<br />
to persons and firms eligible for benefits under<br />
existing schemes.<br />
