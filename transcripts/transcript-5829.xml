PRiME MINISTER<br />

VICTORIAN GOVERNMENT THREAT TO BAN NUCLEAR SHIPS<br />
I regret deeply the unilateral statement by the<br />
Premier of Victoria that his Government proposes to<br />
0 enact legislation to seek to bai nuclear powereed vessels<br />
or vessels with nuclear armaments from Victorian<br />
ports. This could have grave and far-reaching implications<br />
-n an its relationshipswithits<br />
allies. I regret also the fact that the Premier of Victoria saw<br />
fit to make a public announcement on this matter before<br />
completing consultation with the Commonwealtl) Government<br />
oft--it. I. am therefore taking the unusual step of<br />
rele~ sing the correspondence which -has taken place-between<br />
the Premier of Victoria and me on the subject.<br />
0 I an advised that the Comnonwealth has the ultimate<br />
constitutional power. .1 Lm therefore seeking urgent<br />
advice as to whether legislation may be necessary to put<br />
thatbeyond any doubt, to ensure that the Government<br />
is able to carry out its constitutional responsibilities<br />
for the defence of Australia. </p>

Dear Mr. Fraser, Visits to VictorTAAAI tclear Powa~ rcd<br />
and Nuclear Armed Warships<br />
1 hiave been advised that until early in 1980 it<br />
had been the practice in the case of proposed visits to<br />
Victoria by nuclear powered warships for the Prime Minister<br />
to write to my predecessors as Premier seeking their<br />
concurrence. Since February, 1980, arrangemints for routine<br />
v'isits to Victoria by nuclear powered warships have been<br />
handled at departmental level.<br />
I am writing to give you early notice of my<br />
Government' s policy that it will not pemiit visits of<br />
nuclear powEtred or nuclear armed vessels to Victorian ports.<br />
~ rhis policy, which was part of the platform on<br />
which my Government was elected, will apply without<br />
quali fication. : 1lo ok forward to your co-operation in assisting<br />
us in the maintenance of compliance w'ith this policy. It<br />
would be ap:? reciated if your Government could advise<br />
relevant foreign Governments, as appropriate, of my<br />
Government's policy in order to avoid misunderstanding. In<br />
each case of a proposed visit to Victoria by a naval vessel<br />
of a country controlling tactical nuclear weapons, it would<br />
also be appreciated if you could obtain from the relevant<br />
foreign gov'arnment an assurance that no nuclear weapons are<br />
carried. Yours " incerelyo<br />

<p>COPY OF HR CAIN'S TELX TO THE<br />
PRIME MINISTER OF 3 JUNE 1982<br />
Dear Mr Fraser,<br />
I have received your letter of 3rd June, 1982 about the policy<br />
of the Victorian Government of not permitting visits to Viotoria<br />
by ships which are nuclear-armed or nuclear-pow. ered.<br />
I note the Commonwealth's policy of not seeking assurance from<br />
the U. S. Government that its naval vessels are not carrying nuclear<br />
arnament s.<br />
In this particular case, I do not intend to raise objections about<br />
the visit of the U. S. S. Hector which from published sources<br />
is manifestly an elderly, non-combatant, auxiliary ship which<br />
would not. carry nuclear weapons. I understand that its armament<br />
is restricted to four machine guns and that its function is to<br />
provide a capability to repair other vessels.<br />
You have raised a number of ) points wghich I have had put to study<br />
in the context of Victoria's declared policy on this subject. I<br />
welcome your desire which I share to resolve the policy matters<br />
between us in a spirit of co-operation and harmony.<br />
Yours sincerely,<br />
John Cailn<br />
Premier </p>

4 June 1902.<br />
My dear Premier,.<br />
Thank you for your teleprinter message of 3 J3une.<br />
I am writing to ensure that there is -no<br />
between us. There can b~ e no ground!; for assuiny that.<br />
USS. HECTOR is iiot carrying nuclear armaments. Part. of<br />
her role could be the carriage of nuc-lear weapons of<br />
various kinds for resupply to other vessels of the US<br />
Nav" y.<br />
I rote that the rseoond paragraph of your teleprinter<br />
mes~ sage reflects a misunderstanding. It is the policy<br />
of the United StateB Governurtent and Navy to neither<br />
conifirm nor deny that their warship. 9 are carrying<br />
nuclear weapons. The Cowitonwelth Government accepts<br />
that pol-icy as revelation of which warships are, and<br />
which are not, carrying nuclear armaments would<br />
dlisadvantage our P. lly and weaken deterrence.<br />
Yours Sincerely,<br />
( Mal1colm r-raser)<br />
The Hfonourable J. Cain, MT. L. A.,<br />
Premier of Victoria,<br />
MELBOURNE. VIC. -3002 </p>
