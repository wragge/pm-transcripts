PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING MP<br />
AND THE MINISTER FOR PRIMARY INDUSTRIES AND ENERGY,<br />
SENATOR THE HON BOB COLLINS, JOINT PRESS CONFERENCE,<br />
8 DECEMBER 1994<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
PM: the statement just released to you which is a decision taken by the<br />
Cabinet on submissions lodged by my colleague Senator Collins in a<br />
set of proposals which have been worked up by the leader of our Rural<br />
and Regional Task Force Harry Woods, Member for Page, Bob<br />
Horne, Member for Patterson and Dick Adams, Member for Lyons as<br />
well as with extensive consultation with the farm sector and the<br />
leadership of the major farm and grazing groups.<br />
I think the first thing we want to say about this is that the Government<br />
regards this drought as probably the most serious ever. I said at the<br />
election that we wouldn't be leaving any section of Australia behind<br />
and that included farming families. So, in 1994 we have introduced a<br />
White Paper for the long-term unemployed because of their plight. We<br />
have now focussed, I think, systematically on the difficulties faced by<br />
rural Australia particularly those people affected by severe drought.<br />
As a consequence, the Government, in a quite revolutionary change of<br />
policy announced some time ago that we would remove the farm<br />
assets test for the purpose of income support, for people in farm<br />
communities and improve also the capacity of the Rural Adjustment<br />
Scheme to adjust farms who are in marginal conditions at the best of<br />
times away from the sector now that conditions have become far more<br />
critical and also to improve farm management capacity and Senator<br />
Collins and I gave a commitment that we would look at the possibility<br />
of structural improvements to the tax system to encourage for the<br />
future the putting away of money for difficulties. circumstances or the<br />
putting away of fodder and the storage of water. These are things that<br />
we gave a commitment to the farm leaders on and the farm<br />
communities on at the time of our last major package.<br />
Now, that was $ 164 million of assistance over time and this package is<br />
$ 112 million over four years which adds to the cost of the scheme, but<br />
again, seeks to try to deal with the problem. </p>
<p>2<br />
In a nutshell what we have today, we have the RASAC giving us<br />
advice upon what areas are exceptional circumstance areas drought<br />
exceptional circumstance. Now, it has to be a scientific evaluation, it is<br />
one away from the political fray, it is one that looks objectively at the<br />
problems of particular localities in respect of drought and the qualifying<br />
criteria. The submission which Bob Collins brought to Cabinet<br />
yesterday extended that drought exceptional circumstance area down<br />
the north coast of New South Wales. There is a map here and you are<br />
welcome to it which shows in orange the general, Bob, maybe you<br />
could show them Bob. Have you got the map?<br />
BC: They are coming.<br />
PM: Here it is here, that is the new area. All of this pink area is already<br />
receiving drought exceptional circumstance support, but where we<br />
have taken the policy a little further is in the areas which are here in<br />
primrose, these are the areas if you like, in central western New South<br />
Wales from the Hunter back in through to Dubbo and to Nyngan.<br />
Those areas don't qualify for the drought exceptional circumstance, but<br />
they are severely drought affected and they are structurally depleted in<br />
terms of the way in which the sector has been managed in that part of<br />
New South Wales. So, what we have sought to do to overcome this<br />
problem, we are enlarging the regional RAS program which will help<br />
ensure that those areas outside of these drought declared areas are<br />
sensitively managed. The other declaration, of course, is in the<br />
eastern side of Tasmania which is also an area recommended by<br />
RASAC. So, we are doing two things. We are extending the drought<br />
exceptional circumstance declarations down the New South Wales<br />
coast and into Tasmania. We are also, in areas which are severely<br />
drought affected but don't qualify for technical reasons, be it late rains<br />
or other things, and where there are structural problems, to extend<br />
regional RAS for adjustment there and because the people in that area<br />
don't qualify for income support under the exceptional circumstances<br />
what Bob Collins has recommended is that the Cabinet allocate a<br />
further level of funding for the Farm Household Support scheme, which<br />
is an income support scheme which is not part of the social security<br />
system as is the availability of income support under the exceptional<br />
circumstances drought arrangements. The Cabinet has agreed to<br />
provide a further $ 5 million in 1994/ 95 and 1995/ 96 to enable the<br />
Minister for Primary Industry and Energy to exercise his discretion<br />
under Section 5.3 of the Farm Household Support Act 1992 to extend<br />
the grant period under the scheme for eligible farmers in the western<br />
division and central west of New South Wales from nine months to a<br />
maximum of 24 months.<br />
In other words, what the Government is seeking to do here is to cover<br />
off the areas of exceptional circumstance, to provide the income<br />
support that comes with it and where the drought extends itself to have </p>
<p>RASAC examine the areas and make appropriate declarations. But,<br />
where we have a critical situation on our hands and -we do in some of<br />
these areas, particularly in the central west area of New South Wales<br />
which hasn't caught the southern rains in the way the ACT has, we<br />
have sought to extend the policy further by putting another, if you like<br />
backup, to the drought exceptional circumstances policy.<br />
Let me say that our Rural and Regional Task Force has been quiet<br />
significant in this, that is, the touch that they have had with the rural<br />
farm communities around Australia including in New South Wales and<br />
in this area out in central western New South Wales, Bob Homne has<br />
been in touch with the farm community and getting an assessment of<br />
how we can deal with farm degradation, how we can deal with<br />
overstocking, how we can deal with some of the problems which are<br />
now making itself pretty obvious.<br />
Can I just say we have had criticism here from the New South Wales<br />
Ministers Souris and Causley and the gall of them is that less<br />
payments are going to New South Wales farmers, say compared with<br />
Queensland, because New South Wales won't provide the funding.<br />
New South Wales won't provide the funding. The hypocrisy of Souris<br />
and Causely is manifest. So, as always, as in most things in this<br />
country, to get a structural change in this area of policy, it has come as<br />
always, from the Labor Party. But, we are guided by the thing that<br />
always guides us and that is if people are in trouble, no matter where<br />
they are or where they are from or who they vote for, let me say that,<br />
we are there to give them a hand. But, give them a hand with a policy<br />
that will stick under pressure and one that is rational and sensible and<br />
that is why, I think, generally the farm leaders have supported this<br />
change. One final thing and that is on the future. Bob and I gave a commitment<br />
to the farm sector that we would look at farm management bonds and<br />
the IEDs and we are increasing the limit on the farm bonds from<br />
$ 80,000 to $ 150,000 per tax payer, which is $ 300,000 for a two tax<br />
payer farm family which means that they can save for tomorrow, if you<br />
like, when they get income they can start to put money away. They get<br />
a choice, they could either save money or in some respects if they<br />
wanted they can save fodder, they can do the things that help them<br />
through the tough times and we. have also introduced a 10 per cent<br />
investment allowance for fodder storage, livestock water storage and<br />
water conveyancing subject to investments being consistent with farm<br />
management plans. That I might say, is a further change. In other<br />
words we will encourage more water storage, we will be encouraging<br />
greater provision for fodder and beyond that we will be encouraging<br />
provision for finance for people to put funds away as they need it.<br />
You might recall just a couple of weeks ago I put out a statement<br />
introducing the Land Management Task Force to investigate ways to<br />
improve the adoption use of property management plans for the farm<br />
sector. What we want to see come out of the drought, out of this </p>
<p>4<br />
period of stress for people, is in the future we look at w~ hole of farm<br />
planning: management of the soils; stocking rates; provision of water;<br />
advice about what -sort of crops should be sown, how the contour<br />
ploughing should take place. And we are trying to encourage the<br />
banks to get into this so that they lend only when there is a competent<br />
farm management plan. In other words, they are not just lending on<br />
marginal land, that is marginal at the best of times and completely<br />
lacking viability at the worst of times. So, that coupled with what we<br />
are doing here today means quite a large change to agricultural policy<br />
in Australia and let me complement my colleague Bob before he says<br />
a word to you on understanding all these things, having the wit to put<br />
a policy like this together, for his linkages and touch with the farm<br />
community and the grazing community out there and, again, working<br />
as he has in co-operation with our own colleagues in the caucus who I<br />
have mentioned. This should mean that a lot of people in rural<br />
Australia will know that whatever else happens, there is going to be<br />
income support there for them in difficult circumstances, where they<br />
are in exceptional or as we described very difficult circumstances and<br />
for the future we'll let them put more funds away, we will help them<br />
build their fodder and water capacity and we will get some real whole<br />
of farm planning into the farm sector.<br />
BC: With the delivery of this component for long term handling of drought<br />
which we committed ourselves to in September, what this Government<br />
has in fact done is we have delivered to primary producers across<br />
Australia the most comprehensive and the best structured package of<br />
drought assistance that any government has ever delivered to primary<br />
producers in Australia. For both short term measures and for longer<br />
term measures. One of the reasons for that is that we have worked<br />
hand in glove with all of the major* farming organisations in Australia.<br />
This has been developed in full co-operation with them. They haven't,<br />
of course, got all they wanted, but they have got a substantial part of it.<br />
They have got the parts of it that we thought were good policy. I<br />
expect the FMBs that Paul has just referred to in particular will get a<br />
huge tick from farmers right across Australia because the constant<br />
demand from the primary producers, and they are fair dinkum about it,<br />
is that they want the government as well as helping us now in the short<br />
term to attack the underlying structural policy problems with the<br />
existing short term measures of drought relief and what we have been<br />
doing for 100 years in this country. is running in when there is a crisis<br />
and slapping band-aids all over it, we have done it for a hundred<br />
years. It hasn't been until this package has been delivered that we now have<br />
a structured, comprehensive package that will target the assistance<br />
properly and will help farmers help themselves.<br />
One of the criticisms can I say of the FMBs has been, in terms of these<br />
enhancements, ' oh well, this is going to help the very good farmers'.<br />
Yes, it will and the reason I stress that is there is a very strong social<br />
underlay to this package, very strong. In terms of maintaining the </p>
<p>integrity of that bush community that really provide the wfioe spirit and<br />
heart of Australia. The FMBs are absolutely crucial to that which is<br />
why the farm organisations asked for this as their major priority and it<br />
will help the best farmers survive the worst times in Australia and keep<br />
them on those family farms.<br />
Just to give you a quick example, the farming community, the NFF, the<br />
Grains Council, the SA Farmers Federation, NSW Farmers<br />
Federation, asked in respect of the taxation arrangements, the<br />
investment allowances, that they be extended. Not just to water<br />
storage, but also importantly to water conveyancing, that is actually<br />
reticulating crops, reticulating it across the property, that made sense.<br />
They also asked for it to be extended to minimum tillage equipment as<br />
well, we have delivered on all that.<br />
I would just like to take you quickly through the actual structure of what<br />
has happened in New South Wales, which is important, again, in terms<br />
of the social underlay of this. The Government has adopted in full all<br />
of the recommendations of RASAC. Every single recommendation was<br />
supported. RASAC, I have to say, have done a herculean task over<br />
the last month or so, getting this into Cabinet in time. They have not<br />
only done the massive analysis that is required, but they have been on<br />
the ground as well, in all of these in places. And they have<br />
recommended that this strip and you have got the maps now down<br />
the East Coast of NSW and if you have a look at the historical Met.<br />
patterns you will see why that has happened we have declared<br />
exceptional circumstances and we have done it, a little consistent rain<br />
shadow in Tasmania has also been allocated exceptional<br />
circumstances. All of this area, of course, is currently getting it, and I<br />
might add, in the short time this scheme has been working -since<br />
September, basically 5 weeks from a running start, or a standing start<br />
it has been dramatically successful. We now have 5000 farm families<br />
receiving farm household support, or drought household support,<br />
where they were getting nothing before. 5000. There'hasn't been a<br />
hitch in the delivery of this.<br />
PM: And that is worth about $ 6 million.. million.<br />
BC: Now, the green area here is the Western Division of NSW which we<br />
have already allocated funding for, for rural restructuring, in exactly the<br />
same way as the package that has already been delivered and was<br />
signed off by the Prime Minister in Charleville for South West<br />
Queensland. I am heartened by the fact that George Souris in<br />
response to a few complaints we made last week did say on the ABC<br />
radio that the NSW Government is committed to deliver the assistance<br />
here. Now, we were left with this band here in Central Western NSW<br />
Nyngan and Dubbo and so on and this in fact was the basic request<br />
for assistance this band here. This has been delivered.. . we were left<br />
with this in here. It did not qualify, on the recommendation of RASAC,<br />
for exceptional circumstances assistance. But there are hard problems<br />
in here, I mean this area is essentially only been droughted since the </p>
<p>beginning of the year, but because of massive structurar problems -I<br />
mean a lot of these places are ex-dairy farmers that are now running<br />
cattle and so on. There are massive structural problems, and RASAC<br />
reported all this, massive environmental problems being caused in this<br />
area, but also there are welfare problems. So we were faced with the<br />
difficulty of getting some help to these people that's needed, while<br />
maintaining the structural integrity of this approach. What we did was<br />
this: we are going to incorporate the entire Central West area that is<br />
yellow into this are as a Structural Adjustment Package for NSW, and<br />
we will put that offer on the table immediately with NSW. Now what<br />
that means importantly of course, are, enhanced re-establishment<br />
grants $ 45,000 to $ 75,000 across this entire area for those people<br />
that want to exit but also importantly we will provide you with the<br />
detail of this later all of the productivity enhancement assistance that<br />
is going to be put into here as well. But, what we have also done the<br />
farm household support scheme which is the equivalent money to<br />
JSA and the Drought Relief Payments it's the same amount of money<br />
is currently only available for 9 months. At the end of that 9 months,<br />
you either exit, in which case the loan is converted to a grant and you<br />
don't have to repay it, or if you don't exit, that has then got to be<br />
repaid. What we have done is we have extended for this are the FHS<br />
qualifications from 9 months to 2 years. In fact, it has become a<br />
central part of the reconstruction part of this area. So farmers in this<br />
region will be able to go on farm household support in this whole<br />
region for 2 years now. They will be able, if they wish to exit farming,<br />
and indeed some of these farms without question are not viable, and<br />
they will still get the re-establishment grant of $ 75,000 on top of that.<br />
If, of course, they want to stay, they will be able to do that and that<br />
grant will then be converted into a loan. So, we have delivered<br />
fundamentally on everything we have been asked to deliver, in terms<br />
of the major asks of the farming community, and as I said before, in<br />
doing so, and addressing the social needs of farmers in a difficult<br />
situation, this is the most comprehensive and best structured package<br />
of drought assistance that has ever been delivered.<br />
J: What happened to the appeal by the various state's to be included in<br />
Exceptional Circumstances?<br />
BC: They were all assessed by RASAC one important thing, we also said<br />
as you recall when we launched the package, that we had adopted<br />
a criteria of 24 months out of 36 as an immediate fix. The reason is it<br />
has been used in Queensland now for 2 years now and we have to get<br />
this assistance on the ground quickly. We acknowledge then the<br />
deficiencies of it, and said we would go out with the co-operation of the<br />
State ministers hopefully, and we did that. At the ARMCANZ meeting<br />
in Adelaide, all Ministers signed off on this everyone, including Ian<br />
Causely from NSW. This is the criteria, and I will just indicate that it is<br />
available if you want it, and it is now being used by RASAC. All of<br />
these assessments were made on the new criteria. 24 out of 36<br />
( months) is finished, Cabinet has adopted the new criteria for future<br />
assessment and RASAC is now using that. If you are interested in </p>
<p>what RASAC is and I just recommend that you have a rook at the list<br />
of membership of RASAC it is a very, very good bunch of people.<br />
The President of the South Australian Farmers Federation is on it, a<br />
board member of the NSW RAS Authority, one of the rural managers<br />
of the National Bank is on it it is a very independent and expert group<br />
of people. What will now happen, we will get applications, they will be<br />
given to RASAC and this is what was agreed in Adelaide RASAC<br />
will use the new criteria, and provide the Government with independent<br />
advice on whether these areas should be granted. I stress again,<br />
Cabinet supported every recommendation of RASAC. RASAC has not<br />
recommended that Victoria should be included, it has not<br />
recommended that the Northern Territory should be included, but is<br />
has recommended that the areas that we have granted in NSW and<br />
Tasmania, and in the report to me pointed out that although this<br />
area didn't qualify, it didn't qualify because of the massive underlying<br />
structural problems in this region that have simply been exacerbated<br />
by the drought, and we have acted on that recommendation as well, in<br />
putting in this rural restructuring package. And I might add, there are<br />
when you see the detailed costs later there are significant funding<br />
implications of this. There are quite a few million dollars are now going<br />
to go in here. I am happy to say, that a significant amount of that is<br />
Landcare, and I might add, this package costing does not include the<br />
labour market programs of course that are administered by Simon<br />
Crean that is, the programs specifically directed to environmental<br />
damage. The money that is in this package for Landcare is for the<br />
project funding, that is actually for the hardware that will be needed to<br />
help farmers put these measures into place to try to stop the<br />
environment problems in this region. The enhancement of the FHS<br />
arrangements will cost $ 10 million over 2 years that it is going into this<br />
region. But I might add also, that there is no need for the NSW<br />
Government to match that the only matching funding we need from<br />
NSW is for the Structural Adjustment Package the family household<br />
assistance package that we fund.<br />
PM: What we need from NSW is some matching goodwill and some<br />
matching concern for the farmers that is what we need from NSW.<br />
BC: And an agreement like tomorrow....<br />
PM: And can I just say on this question about the Landcare programs<br />
apart from their values in terms of dealing with environmental<br />
degradation, the labour market component of them which as Bob has<br />
said, is funded under the DEET programs of Simon Crean the extra<br />
$ 14 million over 2 years for the National Landcare Program in drought<br />
affected areas will also help those people who work on farms who are<br />
not farm owners that is the farm workers and the townspeople who<br />
find themselves in a great difficulty of finding work. So, there is the<br />
environmental benefit, but there is also a social benefit too. </p>
<p>J: Mr Keating, you have given an awful lot of money to a mob of people<br />
who will never vote for you, in a fairly tight fiscal situation as well<br />
why?<br />
PM: For the same reason that we have given a structured set of policies to<br />
the long-term unemployed wherever they might be I am quite sure<br />
that a lot of them are in the areas where they have not been<br />
traditionally supporters of the Government. But the Labor Party has<br />
always had that sense of society about looking after people in difficult<br />
circumstances when events have overtaken them through no fault of<br />
their own, and they find themselves rather to deal with it. And let me<br />
just reiterate what Bob Collins said about the farm family he said we<br />
are supporting those who have got viable farms with these tax<br />
arrangements we are, because we have to maintain the core of the<br />
family farm, and the family farming business, and the towns and the<br />
communities that arise as a result of it. Otherwise, you will just see<br />
massive aggregations to industrial companies, which may be owned by<br />
Australians, and may not be owned by Australians. And therefore you<br />
have got a change in the nature of rural society. So this is a large<br />
issue, as far as we are concerned.<br />
J: You have said that you will speak to the banks, or encourage the<br />
banks to lend only to viable farmers to what extent do you think the<br />
problem of non-viable farmers exist, and won't one consequence of<br />
that be further de-population of rural Australia?<br />
PM: There has been, over a long period of time now, an aggregation of<br />
larger holdings, and that has been true as farm efficiencies have<br />
needed to increase particularly in the face of polluted markets around<br />
the world, and price competition so that has happened. And there<br />
has been a drift away from the country-side to the towns and cities, but<br />
we still want to maintain viable units. The banks, by and large, have<br />
taken a view that there was no point in throwing a lot of properties onto<br />
the market as through 1990/ 91 etc and that has been a wise view,<br />
and I think now they want to seriously remain in the business of<br />
lending to the farm sector, but they now understand as we<br />
understand, and as the peak farm organisations understand that we<br />
have got an obligation not simply to the incumbent farmer, but to the<br />
land that they farm and graze, its long-term viability, to soil erosion, to<br />
wind erosion, to adequate water arrangements on farms, and therefore<br />
the business of the whole of farm planning will start to consultancies<br />
drive all around the country helping and providing whole of farm<br />
management plans, and which I think<br />
J: Do you have in mind further specific drought initiatives to bring that<br />
about?<br />
PM: We have got a lot of extension and advisory services running now, and<br />
a lot of it is funded here, and as you know, I was in Charleville last<br />
week with the South West Queensland strategy with the farm<br />
community out there, which is just about that. You see, this can't just </p>
<p>9<br />
be done by Governments is got to be done by farm communities, and<br />
I think what was very encouraging about the South West Strategy was<br />
that you have got that essentially coming from the farmers and graziers<br />
themselves in this case graziers; themselves saying " look, we are<br />
overstocking, we are putting the land at risk, a lot of us are not viable,<br />
if some leave, the rest of us can be viable, and if they leave, if you the<br />
Commonwealth give them income support and labour market programs<br />
and some financial adjustment, you can get them out, help them, focus<br />
them, and get them a job". In other word, it makes possible that which<br />
could never happen were we not around, or were there not a strategy.<br />
So I think this is going to be the mood of it, ( inaudible), the Murray-<br />
Darling basin and you could perhaps see the South West Queensland<br />
regional strategy as being part of what we call a drift down the Murray-<br />
Darling Basin as we continue to improve these strategies right through<br />
the area of that system.<br />
BC: Can I just say in advance of your question that there is one important<br />
part of this package that we haven't dealt with a lot of the detail, that is<br />
have a look at the detail, there is significant money for additional<br />
scientific research. We have already put money in which has<br />
produced a real result the Rain Man Package which has been a real<br />
winner was produced with the funding we provided last time, we have<br />
extended that. But there is an important component of the funding -I<br />
think it's close to $ 0.5 million it is $ 480,000 I think what we are<br />
going to do, it has never been done before, is the Department of<br />
Primary Industry and Energy, DEET and Social Security, are going to<br />
conduct face to face surveys with 3,500 farmers right across Australia.<br />
It has never been done before. We are going to develop a data base<br />
from face to face interviews with 3,500 farm families across Australia<br />
about the full range of their problems, the Government Assistance, the<br />
Social Security system and all the rest of it. And I think that will<br />
produce an extremely invaluable result for Government in terms of any<br />
future policy decisions we take.<br />
J: Mr Keating, now that we know what you are going to do for the country<br />
people, when are we going to<br />
PM: Can I just say...<br />
J: what are you going to do about those people in trouble because of<br />
the operation of the third runway?*<br />
PM: I'm not here on this occasion. l know you would like me to stay here<br />
for the rest of the afternoon to answer all the questions that come into<br />
you head....<br />
BC: How about 10 minutes attention on the bush instead of the towns all of<br />
the time? I </p>
<p>PM: How about 10 minutes attention to any one subject that would do us?<br />
But before I I hope you noted that Alan for your Saturday column<br />
Alan...<br />
J: How are we going to know when you are going to do something about<br />
the third runway.....<br />
PM: Well, I am about to I should have at 10.30am been delivering a<br />
speech on the Defence White Paper in the House, and I have got to<br />
go, we will be considering the third runway today in Cabinet, and at the<br />
appropriate time today, we will be saying something solid about it.<br />
J: Will you come back and say something Prime Minister?<br />
PM: I don't know... just as Bob Collins in a sense doesn't need me to explain<br />
this change, nor does my colleague Laurie Brereton need me to<br />
explain the others. And....<br />
J: You have chosen to explain this policy....<br />
PM: I have.<br />
J: You can choose to explain the one about the third runway?<br />
PM: I have a completely deep interest in the third runway, and all the<br />
corridor chit-chat and scuttlebutt about it just for you Alan, I will think<br />
about it. But only just for you.<br />
J: That is very kind of you Prime Minister.<br />
PM: It is a sign of my concern.<br />
J: Prime Minister, it has been reported that you are responsible for one of<br />
the key decisions that diverted planes over the suburbs, rather than<br />
the sea is that accurate?<br />
PM: You will have to wait ' til after Cabinet.<br />
ends. </p>
