    <content><![CDATA[<p>I will visit New York from 11 to 16 September to attend the United Nations 2005 World Summit.  The visit will provide an opportunity to advance Australia's foreign and trade policy interests through discussions with a number of the many other world leaders who will also be attending.</p>
<p> At the United Nations, I will reinforce Australia's strong stand against terrorism and other threats to collective security.  I will emphasise the importance of effective aid delivery and trade reform in efforts to reduce poverty.  I will highlight Australia's leading work in peace-building and the expertise Australia can bring to the United Nations in this area.</p>
<p>I will promote Australia's foreign policy and trade agenda in meetings with world leaders in the margins of the Summit.  I will also take the opportunity to deposit Australia's ratification instrument for the People Trafficking Protocol.</p>
<p>  While in New York, I will address the Asia Society on Australian policy priorities for the Asia-Pacific and seek to promote trade and investment opportunities for Australia through meetings with corporate leaders.  </p>
