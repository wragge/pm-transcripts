P R IMI MINISTE<br />
FOR MEDIA THURSDAY, 5 JULY 1979<br />
SOUTH PACIFIC ARTS FESTIVAL<br />
The Prime minister announced today that the Australian Government<br />
would provide $ 200,000 to the South Pacific Commission as<br />
its contribution towards the South Pacific Arts Festival.<br />
The Festival, the third to be staged, will be held in<br />
Port Moresby from 29 June to 12 July 1980.<br />
Previous Festivals were held in Fiji in 1972 and Rotorua,<br />
New Zealand, in 1976.<br />
The purpose of the Festivals is to foster and celebrate the<br />
rich and diverse cultures of the South Pacific region.<br />
Australia recognises the value of such Festivals as one of<br />
the most important cultural initiatives in the region, and has<br />
actively supported and participated in the previous Festivals.<br />
Australia's contribution is intended to assist with both the<br />
costs of staging the Fes-tival and transporting participants,<br />
and to help ensure the success of the occasion. The grant<br />
will be reviewed when the final costs of the Festival are<br />
known to see if there is any additional assistance which<br />
could be provided.<br />
The Prime Minister said it was also an expression of our<br />
continuing and expanding interest and involvement in<br />
the South Pacific region.<br />
Australia will also be contributing by sending performers and<br />
other participants to the 1980 Festival. 000---</p>
