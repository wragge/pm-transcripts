    <content><![CDATA[<p>The launch of the first National Indigenous English Literacy and Numeracy</p>
<p> Strategy today is an important step towards addressing educational disadvantage</p>
<p> among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples.</p>
<p>The government will provide $27 million over the next four years to back</p>
<p> this strategy, which addresses indigenous literacy, numeracy and attendance</p>
<p> problems in the most disadvantaged areas.</p>
<p>I am delighted that a number of high profile indigenous Australians,</p>
<p> including Jimmy Little, Cliff Lyons and Nicky Winmar are supporting the</p>
<p> strategy by serving as Ambassadors for Indigenous Education.</p>
<p>Addressing disadvantage in education is a key step towards real reconciliation</p>
<p> and improving the status and standard of living of indigenous Australians.</p>
<p>Being able to read and write, add and subtract is fundamental to a good</p>
<p> start in life. We are making progress, reflected in a fourfold increase</p>
<p> since the 1970s in the proportion of indigenous children completing high</p>
<p> school and a trebling of indigenous higher education enrolments. But more</p>
<p> needs to be done and this landmark strategy contains practical measures</p>
<p> to improve the situation.</p>
<p>It includes action to lift school attendance rates, address hearing and</p>
<p> health problems that affect educational performance, improve pre-school</p>
<p> opportunities, train more teachers for indigenous communities and apply</p>
<p> transparent measures of success to accurately gauge progress.</p>
<p>An important element of the strategy is that it is based on a cooperative</p>
<p> effort by local communities, schools, parents and government departments,</p>
<p> both State and Federal, to achieve improved outcomes.</p>
<p>This is another expression of the social coalition at work to address</p>
<p> difficult problems within our society by drawing on the skills and resources</p>
<p> of individuals, local communities, government and business.</p>
