TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
INTERVIEW WITH RICHARD UTTING, ABC RADIO, 15 MAY 1995<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF ONLY<br />
RU: Very good morning Paul, how are you?<br />
PM: Good thank you. Good to be around.<br />
RU: And a good game of football yesterday?<br />
PM: Well, there have probably been better games, but I don't know there<br />
has been better football. You know what I mean? It wasn't as close a<br />
game as I think the Dockers would have liked, but there was some<br />
amazing football.<br />
RU: Well it was a historic event, I suppose, the first Western Derby and the<br />
opening of the grandstand as well.<br />
PM: The ground looked terrific. It was like a bowling green out there.<br />
RU: Yes. Now I don't know if you heard it, but I have just been reading an<br />
apology concerned with the behaviour of one of your MPs I suppose,<br />
Graeme Campbell. How long can the ALP put up with somebody like<br />
Graeme Campbell?<br />
PM: I haven't heard anything about it, I am sorry. I didn't hear. I heard you<br />
reading something as I walked in.<br />
RU: Well you would be aware that Mr Campbell has made a series of<br />
attacks on the Director of Public Prosecutions here, John McKechnie.<br />
PM: Well I am not really aware of that, no.<br />
RU: One of which involved allegations about Mr McKechnie's 17 year old<br />
daughter and I am simply asking the question, is it appropriate for<br />
Labor MPs to do those sorts of personal attacks? </p>
<p>PM: Oh well I don't believe in personal attacks and I think there is enough<br />
policy meat to get into, without worrying about individuals.<br />
RU: Have you spoken to Mr Campbell about his allegations at all? The<br />
way he has been conducting himself?<br />
PM: Well, he often gets into me, of course.<br />
RU: Yes, I know.<br />
PM: So I don't talk to him too much at all these days.<br />
RU: Alright, now, we talk about personal attacks and I guess after the<br />
Budget you have had people like John Howard calling you a liar and<br />
saying that the Budget is a pack of lies. I guess you are used to it, but<br />
the sort of personal attacks there are in Federal Parliament and in<br />
Parliament House itself, I mean it must have an effect on families and<br />
those associated with politics.<br />
PM: Well it is a barrage of abuse and by and large I think the Government<br />
and the public system has served Australia well in introducing probably<br />
the greatest range of changes of any OECD country whether it be in<br />
economic policy, in education, in superannuation or in cultural policy<br />
these dramatic changes over the last 10 or 12 years. What we get<br />
from our opponents is a barrage of abuse and I will get more. You<br />
know, John Howard has been Leader of the Opposition now since the<br />
beginning of the year. He has not addressed an issue of substance in<br />
a substantial way since he took the leadership and he is always talking<br />
about honesty. Well you have got to ask yourself, what is honest<br />
about somebody who won't tell the public what they are doing. I mean,<br />
what is credible about that? Trying to sort of curl up and be the<br />
smallest possible target, not saying what you stand for, where the<br />
Government always whether it is Working Nation, Cultural Nation, the<br />
Budget, the National Superannuation Scheme we are out there all the<br />
time with the big positives. Every time you put a positive up like<br />
superannuation or the Budget or the surplus, you duck under a hurl of<br />
abuse. As they hurl the abuse.<br />
RU: I suppose that is the nature of the beast in Opposition.<br />
PM: But, look, the trouble is the Liberal Party have got no structures and no<br />
ideas. If you look at their front bench. It is Fischer who is politically<br />
illiterate. Costello, who is like a crow on the back fence, everything is<br />
bad, he picks the eyes out of anything that is good. And, Alexander<br />
Downer who is a sort of professional failure. I mean that is their front<br />
bench. </p>
<p>RU: But as far as the Budget is concerned, you have had the attacks by<br />
John Howard. Now, I guess, you must have been very happy, for<br />
example, that interest rates did drop when they did. It seemed to me<br />
almost an act of God.<br />
PM: Well, not really. What has happened is this. The Budget has gone<br />
from a deficit of over $ 12 billion to a surplus of $ 700 million, but the<br />
change in the Budget financing task that is the Commonwealth Bond<br />
program that the Commonwealth has let me explain it to you this<br />
way, last year we sold $ 21 billion worth of bonds $ 21,000,000,000.<br />
This year, as a result of the Budget, we will sell $ 6 billion, so there is a<br />
reduction in the bond selling program of $ 15,000,000,000. If there is<br />
much less paper around, Commonwealth Bonds, or paper as it is<br />
called in the trade, the price of the paper rises. As the price goes up<br />
the yield comes down. The yield is the interest rate. So that is why<br />
long term bonds fell about a percentage point last week and what we<br />
saw at the end of the week was the short term rates of variable rates in<br />
the housing market falling with them. So it is all rather mechanical in a<br />
sense. The Budget was a very big swing from deficit back into surplus<br />
and the bond selling program is a dramatic reduction and by taking<br />
that pressure off interest rates. Amongst the first things to fall were<br />
some of those fixed and variable housing rates.<br />
RU: Well interest rates having dropped it seems then, whenever the next<br />
election is, that the Government won't have to worry about further<br />
increases between now and the next election. Would that be a fair<br />
comment?<br />
PM: Well, I think, there is a huge pressure being taken off interest rates. I<br />
mean what we have done, we have reweighted policy off monetary<br />
policy on to fiscal policy. In other words, we have reweighted it off<br />
interest rates, on to the Budget. Now, I think, that is going to augur<br />
well for investment and confidence into the future. Now we have seen<br />
enormous gyrations in financial markets this year. I mean the long<br />
bond yield went up all around the world one of two percentage points<br />
in the last 12 months. I mean no Government can ever see what is<br />
ahead of it in that sense. But what we can do is what we are in charge<br />
of. What we are in charge of is bringing budgetary policy back into<br />
surplus. That is the point the chap from Moody's made on the radio<br />
here in an interview with the ABC last Friday, I think. What he said<br />
was look all this discussion about the elements of the Budget, what we<br />
look at is the bond selling program. If it is in surplus that is all we want<br />
to know and that means there is going to be far less bonds sold, which<br />
means the price of bonds are going to go up and the yields are going<br />
to come down and that is where we make our money, or we lose our<br />
money.<br />
RU: As far as the average person is concerned, it all sounds a touch<br />
esoteric, I guess. But when we look at the Budget, people are saying </p>
<p>well you promised a reduction in taxes, the second tier of that now we<br />
are not going to get a reduction in taxes. Instead, you are going to put<br />
them into superannuation. However valuable that superannuation<br />
program is, and you are clearly very enthusiastic about it.<br />
Nonetheless, it is a broken promise is it not?<br />
PM: No. Now look, what we said was this. The principle promise of the<br />
election, I mean the Liberals run around talking about these things.<br />
Most everybody saw the election.' They saw me on election night.<br />
They saw me in the two debates and they saw me at the policy speech.<br />
What was the principle policy the Government was re-elected on? It<br />
was employment and unemployment. That was bringing employment<br />
back to the Australian economy. Our target, we said, we are going to<br />
try and get to 500,000 jobs in three years. We have already had<br />
650,000 jobs in two and a quarter years. In other words we have met<br />
our three year target and more in two and a quarter years. In other<br />
words we got to our target. We actually got to 500,000 jobs in twothirds<br />
of the time. We are now at 650,000. I mean that was the<br />
principal commitment. Not to leave the unemployed behind, put our<br />
arm out, bring them up and now, of course, with Working Nation we<br />
have now seen 100,000 of those people come from the long term<br />
unemployed. I said we wouldn't leave the unemployed behind,<br />
particularly the long term unemployed. We didn't want an underclass.<br />
That is the thing I said on the evening of the election. That is the<br />
principal commitment we made. Now in One Nation, one year earlier,<br />
that was in March 1992 not March 1993 we introduced One Nation<br />
to stimulate the economy, including such things as the Subiaco Oval<br />
which was part of the public infrastructure spending. The one I had the<br />
pleasure of opening yesterday. And the tax cuts which we paid at the<br />
end of 1993 were to stimulate the economy and it worked a treat. The<br />
economy sprang back into life and we have been growing faster than<br />
any other western economy. Now, what I said was there were two tax<br />
cuts, one we have already paid at the end of 1993. We brought one<br />
forward to the end of 1993 and we put one back. The one we put back<br />
we said we would think about it again as fiscal conditions permit and<br />
we will probably pay it in 1998. Well what we are doing, we are paying<br />
it in 1998. But we are paying into superannuation accounts under a<br />
policy that will give the average working person, every working person,<br />
per cent contributions in superannuation. Now this is a<br />
revolutionary change to Australian savings. It is the most<br />
comprehensive savings plan the country has ever had because<br />
superannuation was always for the high paid before we came to office<br />
and it only covered 40 per cent of people. But now it covers 90 per<br />
cent of people. What it will mean is this. When this scheme we<br />
announced the other night is up and running, someone on $ 33,000 a<br />
year, average weekly earnings, will end up with a lump sum at the end<br />
of their working life of $ 470,000 in today's dollars and an ongoing<br />
annuity, an income in retirement, of $ 30,000 a year. So they are on<br />
$ 33,000 a year now and they are on $ 30,000 a year in retirement in </p>
<p>today's dollars. In other words, there is no drop in living standards, a<br />
very small drop in living standards. Now that is a very great change<br />
and I think if you ask people well, look, would they rather have the<br />
second tax cut as cash or would they rather have something that really<br />
looks after them so that they never have to really worry again about<br />
their standard of living in retirement, I think they will take the latter.<br />
RU: If we can go back to the last election. Fightback, the Liberal Party<br />
policy, there has been described as the longest suicide note made in<br />
history. Wasn't it really a question of the Opposition losing the<br />
election, rather than the Government winning it?<br />
PM: I don't think so. The thing is the Liberal Party these days is without<br />
any structure, or any ideas. I mean you saw Dr Nelson's election on<br />
the weekend. I mean here he is 17 years a member of the Labor<br />
Party. He resigned, apparently, because the Labor Party had<br />
foresaken its socialist principles and next thing the Liberal Party gives<br />
its safest seat to an opportunist. I mean here is the Liberal Party so<br />
moribund, it has so had it that it gives its safest seat in Australia,<br />
Bradfield, to somebody who is essentially in their terms an opportunist.<br />
I mean this is the problem. Before that it was Dr Hewson. He bowled<br />
into Wentworth and then he is off now back in some private career. I<br />
mean what happened at the last election is this. The GST was just a<br />
symptom of the problem. It wasn't the issue alone. It was a symptom.<br />
I think the public looked at the Coalition and they said, well look have<br />
these people got any real ideas for Government? Can they get us out<br />
of the whole and growing again? Are they really dedicated to<br />
employment? Do they believe in social equity? I mean, do they<br />
believe in the culture and values of the country. Do they believe in our<br />
identity? Do they believe in all these things? Do they believe in<br />
access and equity in health and access an equity in education? And,<br />
when Dr Hewson attacked the renters and the school teachers and the<br />
churches and he also bowled up the GST I think people said look,<br />
thank you but no thanks. I think the GST was just, if you like, an<br />
example of the problem. I don't think the election was won or lost in<br />
the GST. It was won on the fact that the Liberal Party in their<br />
judgement wasn't up to it. That meant when we won it was a big<br />
responsibility on us to do the things we said we would do and we have<br />
done as many of them as any Government, more than any<br />
Government, in history. That is, we have got the place growing again,<br />
it was our principal commitment. We had the promise of a generalised<br />
child care rebate, we put that into place. The Home Child Care<br />
Allowance, we put that into place. The Parenting Allowance, we put<br />
that into place. In this Budget now the Maternity Leave, that is going<br />
into place. So what is remarkable about this Budget. You look at my<br />
colleagues Kim Beazley who lives here in the West, the Minister for<br />
Finance, a bloke with enormous quality and experience. Ralph Willis,<br />
the Treasurer, Gareth the Foreign Minister, younger people like the<br />
Attorney-General, Minister for Communications and others. You look </p>
<p>at the strength of the Cabinet and you look at the sort of workmanlike<br />
way that they have dealt with these problems in the<br />
Expenditure Review Committee and people say well the Government<br />
has been in office 12 years. But what a remarkable Budget for a<br />
Government, all the freshness and the zing and the verve in the world.<br />
Not just a Budget. Working Nation, Creative Nation and the Budget all<br />
in a row, within six or eight months.<br />
RU: Alright, but you run the risk don't you of a Government who has been<br />
in power for 12, 13 years even though you have been turning over the<br />
faces I suppose. But isn't there the risk the public are going to say well<br />
look, you have had enough, it is time for somebody else and maybe<br />
from a democratic point of view, that is not a bad thing.<br />
PM: If that was the argument, it would have to be time for somebody who<br />
has got a contribution to make. Here John Howard got up with the<br />
Budget reply and didn't have one policy word to say. Not one policy<br />
word to say. He has got no policies and he has got no ideas. One of<br />
the things that always tends to annoy me about these debates is that<br />
people compare Howard with me, or the Opposition with us, and you<br />
say what have they done. Here we are, we have remodelled a whole<br />
middle sized OECD economy. We have turned into an international<br />
place. Ten years ago, only three kids in ten were completing<br />
secondary school. This year, it is eight in ten. The throughput of<br />
universities, the TAFE system, all these things have been enormous<br />
and culturally and economically the whole of the economy has<br />
changed. The Liberal Party has been in none of these things. So<br />
whereas I say this. If you look at this Budget and the enormous<br />
changes we have seen come through it and that is to try and deal with<br />
major long term issues like superannuation and all these sorts of<br />
issues to try and deal with them, we have introduced Budgets which<br />
have dealt with these things. What other Government is likely to turn<br />
up a national savings scheme which has 15 per cent of everyone's<br />
income into it. This Government has got the Budget back into surplus,<br />
it has got the economy growing, it has got the highest rate of<br />
employment growth in the western world, we have had the biggest fall<br />
in unemployment in our history in the last twelve months. But we will<br />
turn them out and we will take a party that has got no ideas and no<br />
structure all on the basis that we need a change. I mean I just don't<br />
think they are going to do that.<br />
RU: But people might say that it was your policies that were responsible for<br />
the unemployment, the interest rates and all those sorts of matters that<br />
were coming out. Now you do have to take some responsibility for that<br />
surely?<br />
PM: Yes, the policies we presided over for sure. But let me just say this to<br />
you though. Let's take 1983-95. Yes, we had a rise in unemployment,<br />
back to 10 per cent in 1992, but it got as low as 6 per cent by 1989. </p>
<p>We had an average 4 1/ 2 per cent growth all the way through the<br />
There are 26 per cent more people employed in Australia today, than<br />
there were in 1983. If you compare New Zealand, which we are often<br />
compared with, they have got now 2 per cent more people employed in<br />
New Zealand than they had in 1983. In Australia there is 26 per cent<br />
more people. Look at what the Liberal's left us with inflation double<br />
digit inflation. That is where the massive interest rates of the 70s and<br />
early 80s came from. Those huge inflation rates sitting under interest<br />
rates, double digit inflation. Who broke the back of Australian<br />
inflation? This Government. Certainly, the recession helped break the<br />
back of it, but basically it was a Wage Accord sitting underneath it<br />
which did it. If people look at it, we have now had 3 1/ 2 years of<br />
growth. See John Howard has been running around with this cynical,<br />
nasty, little opportunist line about five minutes of sunshine. We have<br />
had 3 1/ 2 years of growth now, since the recession and the Treasury is<br />
forecasting another 3 years of growth. Another 3 years into the future,<br />
so we will have around 6 years of growth as far as we can see at this<br />
point. If you go from 1983-1998, that is 15 years, it will only be 18<br />
months where we were not growing strongly. 18 months out of<br />
years. So what I would say to people is look at the record across that<br />
period and look at the fact that the Australian economy has grown in<br />
real terms by about 35 per cent real. That is after you have washed<br />
the inflation out in that period. Another interesting figure, Richard, is<br />
household disposable income. That is the disposable income of<br />
Australian households has risen 40 per cent since 1983. Not 4 or 14<br />
Now these are big achievements.<br />
RU: Talking of big achievements. There is a launch, I think, coming up on<br />
Thursday a justice or an access to justice package what can you tell<br />
us about that? I think Ronald Wilson's part of that, inquiring into<br />
Aboriginal children who have been separated and so on?<br />
PM: It is basically that. You are going to have to wait for the<br />
announcement. But essentially it is about access to justice, how<br />
justice and access to the justice system is central to our sense of<br />
democracy, our sense of ourselves, our sense of justice in general and<br />
we will be looking at some of those issues and announcing policy<br />
changes on some of those issues, which I think will make this a better<br />
and fairer society. One of those things is the thing you mentioned, that<br />
is Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander families and the inquiry we are<br />
going to be having there under Justice Wilson looking at the removal<br />
of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children from their families and<br />
the present policies and practices concerning indigenous children and<br />
families. You see, a lot of these Aboriginal people that die in custody,<br />
a very high proportion of them were removed from their families and<br />
looking at some of those influences.<br />
RU: Now, we have got a few callers that have some questions to ask of<br />
you, Paul, so if I could get you to put those headphones on. </p>
<p>C: Hi, Paul. In order to maintain our sense of nationhood, surely we<br />
ought not to act like a vassal state and allow an American citizen who<br />
changed his citizenship to get an American TV network to own a press<br />
organisation in Australia and we shouldn't allow a Canadian to control<br />
the other major press organisation. What about forcing them to<br />
relinquish their control because it has a large impact on the cultural life<br />
of the country.<br />
PM: Well, at the time when judgements were made, this is when News<br />
Limited bought the Herald and Weekly Times back in about 1987 or<br />
1988, at that time, a judgement was made was the News Corporation<br />
an Australian company? Well, it is incorporated in Adelaide, it is listed<br />
on the Australian Stock Exchange, it is not incorporated in New York or<br />
Washington or somewhere like that, it is incorporated in Adelaide. The<br />
majority of the stock was held by Australians and although the Chief<br />
Executive Officer, Rupert Murdoch, was by that stage an American<br />
person having accepted American citizenship and relinquished<br />
Australian citizenship, the judgement at the time was that it was an<br />
Australian company and that a transfer of most of its assets from the<br />
Herald and Weekly Times group to News Limited wouldn't in any way<br />
alter, if you like, the questions of sovereignty in the exercise of news<br />
judgement in Australia. I think, to a lesser extent, that has also been<br />
true by some of the foreign ownership we have permitted of, say,<br />
The Sydney Morning Herald and The Melbourne Age, bearing in mind<br />
of course that Australians can in some places, for instance, in Britain<br />
you might remember Rupert Murdoch's big breakthrough was buying<br />
News of the World and News of the World newspaper in the 1970s.<br />
Now, if there had been heavy foreign restrictions on Australians buying<br />
or foreign interest buying British press that wouldn't have happened<br />
and since then, of course, he has bought the Fox Studios in the<br />
United States. He has bought into what is now the Fox Network, he<br />
has put together what is called the Fox Network. So, we try and keep<br />
a premium on our cultural identity and our cultural values, I think it is<br />
just a matter of exercising some judgement and some sense when<br />
these things come along. And they came along basically because the<br />
current owners at the time in the case of Channel 10, the current<br />
owner at the time sold from the business because they were not able<br />
to make it fire. You know the story of Channel 9 of course and<br />
Channel 7 and the same with Warwick Fairfax, who bought his family<br />
interest out of The Sydney Morning Herald and The Age and The<br />
Financial Review but then couldn't make a success of it. It was on the<br />
market and in the hands of the banks. So I take your point but I think<br />
we have just got to measure those things off against our national<br />
interests and try and make it fit and make the money go around, make<br />
it work. </p>
<p>RU: Okay, thanks for that Robert. Let's now go to Ellen from Thornleigh.<br />
How are you Ellen?<br />
C: Well, thank you, good morning Paul.<br />
PM: Ellen how are you there?<br />
C: I believe I am typical of many pharmacists who are concerned about<br />
the nearly 50 per cent rise in the safety net level for people who have<br />
genuine medical conditions such as asthma, heart problems,<br />
hypertension, arthritis. We are continually having to supply free drugs<br />
such as valium, serapax and panadeine forte to the soft drug addicts.<br />
The people who visit many different doctors for free, under the<br />
Medicare scheme, and once they have got their $ 135.20 limit for<br />
prescriptions, they get free scripts for the rest of the year and they go<br />
from pharmacy to pharmacy and they are just abusing the whole<br />
system and there seems to be no rehabilitation for them. We are<br />
concerned for the patients and we are also concerned for the cost to<br />
the Government and the taxpayer.<br />
PM: Well, these are really legitimate worries and this is part of the issue<br />
about what doctors should be prescribing, when and where. Of<br />
course, if patients end up shopping around, there is only so many<br />
doctors they can shop around. After a while doctors get to know them<br />
and there should be more perhaps judicious use of the scripts for<br />
these things as you say serapax and valium and panadeine forte and<br />
these various drugs. Part of the reason why we have got the safety<br />
net set at $ 600 is that people have got to find their costs up to that<br />
level and after that it becomes free. So that is there to protect the<br />
families that do have a couple of children and run into a bout of<br />
sickness and so they are not put into some sort of financial stress<br />
trying to find pharmaceuticals. Now you will also find other people get<br />
on to that bandwagon and use that opportunity. Part of the problem is,<br />
of course, that drugs are becoming more sophisticated, more effective,<br />
but also vastly more costly and in any list of drugs where they are<br />
provided at concessional rates, I am sure the authorities who make the<br />
list up have always got to keep an eye out on the practical and<br />
effective use of the drugs and what they bring versus the costs. So the<br />
scheme is basically a scheme to limit the cost and put some cost on to<br />
the patients and the pharmaceuticals, but at the same time not put<br />
heavy penalties on families or other acutely sick people. Now there<br />
always will be people who slip through and get their valiums, you are<br />
quite right about that. But it is very hard to know how to deal with<br />
them.<br />
RU: Now we have got time for last one call, let's go out to Lyn at Lawson.<br />
Hello Lyn. </p>
<p>C: Hello, I will try and make it brief, but I have got two comments, not so<br />
much questions, but comments so I will leave them with you.<br />
Mr Keating, you are taking the credit for the current interest rate drop<br />
will you then also take credit for them rising to 18 per cent a few years<br />
ago when you were Treasurer?<br />
PM: I didn't take the credit, I got the blame for them didn't I and let me just<br />
make this point. Had interest rates risen on Friday, people would have<br />
said " Budget condemned", the Government would take responsibility.<br />
But if they go down, people say well it's not the Government's doing.<br />
You can't win can you.<br />
C: But they were 18 per cent under you.<br />
PM: And they went up to 22 per cent under Mr Howard, so what.<br />
C: Well neither is any good.<br />
PM: But they are now down. They went up to 18 per cent and they dropped<br />
down to 6. They dropped from 18 to 4 1/ 2 per cent.<br />
C: But a lot of people were hurt when they went up to 18.<br />
PM: And they went up because banks were lending money like there was<br />
no tomorrow. That is why you saw the big blowouts in these private<br />
financial corporations and the rest. That was unsustainable for the<br />
country and we are now back to a sustainable low inflationary, low<br />
interest rate future. That is progress.<br />
RU: We have to leave it there, we are running out of time. Thanks very<br />
much for your's today and you wouldn't like to tell us if there is going to<br />
be an election this year, would you?<br />
PM: I see a few people in my Party saying, I like their optimism, we ought to<br />
be going to a poll earlier, rather than later. But the only person<br />
fortunately in the happy position to decide that is me. ( Broadcast<br />
interrupted for news.)<br />
