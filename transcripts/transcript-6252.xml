FOR MEDIA 2 November 1983<br />
The Prime Minister and Foreign Minister today met with the<br />
Heads of Mission of Commonwealth African countries ( Ghana,<br />
Mauritius, Nigeria, Uganda and Zambia).<br />
At the meeting the attached aide-riemoire was presented<br />
in response to Australia's new policy initiatives on<br />
sporting contacts with South Africa </p>
<p>AIDE MEMOIRE<br />
The Heads of Mission of Commonwealth African countries<br />
( Ghana, Mauritius, Nigeria, Uganda and Zambia) accredited to<br />
Australia have been encouraged by the official statement<br />
released by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, on October 26,<br />
1983 with regard to the new policy Jnitiatives of the<br />
Government of Australia on sporting contacts with South Africa.<br />
They hope that in the implementation of these policies, care<br />
would be taken to avoid misinterpretation with regard to the<br />
amateur and professional status of sportsmen and women from<br />
South Africa.<br />
There is no doubt that many African and Third World<br />
Commonwealth countries would be heartened by this significant<br />
strengthening of Australia's anti-apartheid position, which<br />
should further encourage other Commonwealth countries to<br />
adhere to the spirit and the letter of the Gleneagles Agreement.<br />
The Heads of Mission also note with appreciation the<br />
decision of the Australian Government to permit both the ANC<br />
of South Africa and SWVAPO of Namibia to open information<br />
offices in Australia. This move will significantly assist in<br />
keeping the Australian people inform-ad about the true situation<br />
in South Africa and in Namibia. The Scholarship scheme for<br />
the victims of apartheid, and the arrangement for the opponents<br />
of apartheid to visit Australia and share their experiences<br />
with the Australian public also deserve commendation.<br />
Mindful that the Australian Government has yet to take<br />
a final decision on the question of flights by South African<br />
Airways and Qantas to and from Southern Africa, the Heads of<br />
Mission sincerely hope that the final decision will help to<br />
reinforce Australia's commendable position in the overall<br />
struggle for the elimination of the apartheid system. </p>
