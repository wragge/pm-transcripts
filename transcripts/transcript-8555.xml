PRIME MINISTER<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING MP<br />
COMM( ONWEALTH RESPONSE TO THE ROYAL COMMISSION INTO<br />
ABORIGINAL DEATHS IN CUSTODY, 24 JUNE 1992<br />
Mr Speaker<br />
I seek leave to make a Parliamentary Statement on the<br />
Commonwealth's response to the Royal Commission into<br />
Aboriginal Deaths in Custody<br />
Mr Speaker<br />
On 26 February, I presented the One Nation Statement. In<br />
it, I announced measures to help close the gaps which for<br />
so long have separated Australians.<br />
I said then that all our efforts should go towards<br />
uniting the country. I also said we should combine a<br />
more efficient economy with a fairer and more equitable<br />
society. 27 May was the 25th Anniversary of the 1967 referendum to<br />
give the Commonwealth the power to legislate for<br />
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.<br />
On that occasion I said that, as a nation, we have not<br />
yet succeeded in meeting the challenge set by the<br />
triumphant referendum result.<br />
Today, there is no more central issue to our national<br />
identity and self-esteem than the injustices brought home<br />
to us all by the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths<br />
in Custody.<br />
There is nothing more central to our reputation in the<br />
world. Or to the kind of democratic, just society to which we<br />
aspire. Mr Speaker </p>
<p>2<br />
The needs are clear.<br />
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people have about<br />
half the average yearly income of other Australians.<br />
Participation by Aboriginal young people in post-school<br />
education is around a fifth of the rate for<br />
non-Aboriginal young people.<br />
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in all age<br />
groups have mortality rates almost three times higher<br />
than for the overall population.<br />
The custody rate of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander<br />
people is 29 times that of the general community.<br />
These few statistics give some idea of what the Royal<br />
Commission called " the disadvantaged and unequal<br />
position" of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people<br />
in all aspects of Australian society.<br />
The Commonwealth sees the Report of the Royal Commission<br />
into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody as a national<br />
opportunity for genuine change in the lives of<br />
Australia's Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.<br />
On behalf of the Government, I would like to say again<br />
how much we appreciate the work of the Royal<br />
Commissioners and their staff.<br />
Their work documented a tragic waste of life.<br />
The Royal Commission investigated the deaths of ninetynine<br />
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in<br />
custody. But at least thirty more Aboriginal and Torres Strait<br />
Islander people have died in custody since the Royal<br />
Commission finished its investigations.<br />
I know that nothing can remove the grief, anger and loss<br />
felt by the families, relatives and friends of those who<br />
died. But it is fundamentally important that the Royal<br />
Commission found the real killer.<br />
The responsibility lies in large measure with entrenched,<br />
institutionalised racism and discrimination.<br />
Those who died were victims of over two centuries of<br />
dispossession, prejudice and neglect.<br />
We cannot evade these harsh truths. Nor should we.<br />
But we can work to change them. </p>
<p>On 31 March this year Robert Tickner, the Minister for<br />
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, tabled<br />
responses by the Commonwealth and all mainland State and<br />
Territory Governments to the Royal Commission into<br />
Aboriginal Deaths in Custody.<br />
This kind of cooperation is a truly national achievement,<br />
crossing boundaries of jurisdiction and politics.<br />
Its importance cannot be minimised.<br />
In our response to the Royal Commission, the Commonwealth<br />
supported all but one of the Royal Commission's<br />
recommendations.<br />
We allocated $ 150 million over five years for law and<br />
justice initiatives and to assist Aboriginal and Torres<br />
Strait Islander people in their own efforts to overcome<br />
alcohol and substance abuse.<br />
Today I am proud to announce the second stage of the<br />
Commonwealth's response a concerted attack on the<br />
economic and social disadvantage which is reflected<br />
nowhere more starkly than in the numbers of Aboriginal<br />
and Torres Strait Islander people in custody.<br />
And a renewal of our commitment to empower Aboriginal and<br />
Torres Strait Islanders.<br />
These measures entail an additional $ 250 million over<br />
five years, taking the total Commonwealth expenditure in<br />
response to the Royal Commission, over five years, to<br />
$ 400 million.<br />
In difficult times, this level of funds is not easy to<br />
find. But the need must be faced.<br />
Mr Speaker<br />
The Royal Commission's report described the efforts,<br />
initiatives and dedication of Aboriginal people and<br />
communities and organisations across Australia to protect<br />
their culture, restore self-esteem and achieve real<br />
equality. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are taking<br />
control of their lives and communities.<br />
They are demonstrating the will for renewal and for selfdetermination.<br />
Today the Government reaffirms its support for these<br />
Australians. The concepts " self-determination" and " renewal" are<br />
increasingly a reality. </p>
<p>The structures are there to ensure both their effect and<br />
their survival.<br />
Elected Commissioners of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait<br />
Islander Commission now make national decisions in<br />
Aboriginal Affairs.<br />
Sixty elected Regional Councils now make decisions on<br />
priorities, needs and funding for their areas.<br />
The knowledge and expertise of Aboriginal and Torres<br />
Strait Islander organisations are now vital. in developing<br />
and delivering important Commonwealth programs and<br />
services. Mr Speaker<br />
From the beginning, the ATSIC Commissioners had a major<br />
role in shaping the responses by Governments to the Royal<br />
Commission. I would like to express the Commonwealth's gratitude to<br />
the Chairperson of ATSIC, Miss Lois O'Donoghue, and to<br />
the Commissioners for their dedication.<br />
I would particularly like to thank the Commissioners and<br />
Regional Councils of ATSIC for their efforts over many<br />
months of consultations and negotiations to ensure the<br />
best possible responses by Governments to the Royal<br />
Commission. The ATSIC Commissioners were closely involved in<br />
developing the measures I am announcing today and<br />
endorsed this package of measures before it was<br />
considered by Cabinet.<br />
I would also like to recognise the energy and dedication<br />
of the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander<br />
Affairs, Mr Robert Tickner.<br />
His contribution has been extraordinarily valuable and<br />
central in responding to the Royal Commission.<br />
The initiatives I announce today constitute a renewed<br />
attack on economic and social disadvantages among<br />
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.<br />
These are initiatives with a difference in that they<br />
are firmly based on the notions of empowerment and selfdetermination.<br />
No real change is possible without the energy and will of<br />
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people themselves.<br />
Imposed solutions will not work.<br />
This has been the fundamental flaw in many previous,<br />
well-intentioned policies. </p>
<p>We are focusing on the future on economic development<br />
and on Aboriginal young people.<br />
We are working for increased income in Aboriginal and<br />
Torres Strait Islander communities and organisations,<br />
thus reducing dependence.<br />
We have balanced this strong emphasis on economic<br />
development with equally strong initiatives in social and<br />
cultural self-determination.<br />
These initiatives will mean more jobs, enterprise<br />
opportunities and more training for Aboriginal people.<br />
They will raise community and individual incomes.<br />
They will improve community living standards.<br />
They will increase community self-reliance.<br />
They will address the needs so clearly set out in the<br />
Royal Commission's report.<br />
Mr Speaker, I turn now to the detailed economic<br />
development aspects of this package.<br />
million over five years will be provided for a land<br />
acquisition and development program.<br />
It will provide the capital resources and training for<br />
better use and sustainable development of Aboriginal and<br />
Torres Strait Islander land.<br />
$ 6.6 million over the next three years will be directed<br />
to an Aboriginal Rural Resources program to encourage<br />
enterprise, particularly in managing pastoral properties.<br />
A Community Economic Initiative Scheme, costing $ 23.3<br />
million over five years, will foster local enterprises.<br />
The Australian National Parks and Wildlife contract<br />
employment program for managing natural and cultural<br />
resources will be expanded at a cost of $ 10.6 million<br />
over five years.<br />
ATSIC will develop long-term Aboriginal industry<br />
strategies in the pastoral, arts and tourism industries.<br />
million over five years will be provided for these<br />
strategies, to draw together and build on existing<br />
initiatives.<br />
The Community Development Employment Program will be<br />
expanded at a cost of $ 43.9 million over five years. </p>
<p>This will ensure an increased emphasis on incomegeneration<br />
and will enable CDEP to better meet the needs<br />
of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women and young<br />
people.<br />
A Young Peoples' Employment Program will be established,<br />
at a cost of $ 21.9 million, to provide work placements<br />
largely within Aboriginal organisations and linked to<br />
TAFE training.<br />
The total cost of these economic development initiatives<br />
is $ 181.1 million over five years.<br />
They will make a difference because they ARE different.<br />
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people will shape<br />
and control them.<br />
Mr Speaker, I now turn to the youth aspects of the<br />
package. A Young Peoples' Development Program will be<br />
established, at a cost of $ 23 million over five years, to<br />
encourage planned community action to meet the specific<br />
needs of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander young<br />
people.<br />
We will set up an Aboriginal Youth Sport and Recreation<br />
Development Program at a cost of $ 9 million over five<br />
years. This initiative will provide Aboriginal sports<br />
development officers to work in communities.<br />
million over five years will be provided for 200<br />
additional Aboriginal Education Workers from 1993.<br />
million will be provided for 600 more pre-school<br />
places for Aboriginal children from 1994.<br />
We will also work for better Aboriginal access to preschools.<br />
These measures respond directly to the strong views of<br />
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people that their<br />
children are their future.<br />
All Australians can understand and share this view.<br />
Mr Speaker<br />
We will also provide $ 6.9 million over five years for<br />
measures to improve cooperation between the Commonwealth,<br />
States and Territories and to assist them to monitor<br />
initiatives arising from the Royal Commission.<br />
We have already announced that ATSIC will monitor<br />
progress by Governments in implementing the Royal<br />
Commission' s recommendations. </p>
<p>These processes will be public and will continue our<br />
commitment to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander<br />
participation. The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission will<br />
also report annually on the human rights situation of<br />
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in<br />
Australia. The Commonwealth Government cannot, alone, eliminate the<br />
disadvantage of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander<br />
people.<br />
Aboriginal affairs is the concern of all Australians and<br />
their Governments.<br />
For real change, Commonwealth, State, Territory and Local<br />
Governments must work together with Aboriginal<br />
communities and organisations.<br />
We are making progress. On May 11, Heads of Government<br />
endorsed a framework for intergovernmental cooperation in<br />
Aboriginal affairs.<br />
The Commonwealth is working with State, Territory and<br />
Local Governments to put this cooperative framework into<br />
action. We will develop, with the States and Territories, a<br />
National Aboriginal Policy Statement and negotiate joint<br />
responsibility agreements in specific areas.<br />
These arrangements will take some time to put in place.<br />
However, our discussions with the States, Territories and<br />
Local Government on the response to the Royal Commission<br />
have emphasised the need for real cooperative planning<br />
and delivery.<br />
Among the measures I have announced today, the Rural<br />
Resources, Australian National Parks and Wildlife<br />
Contract Employment, Sport and Recreation and education<br />
initiatives all involve funding or delivery through the<br />
States and Territories.<br />
Local Government is also actively involved in the<br />
intergovernmental cooperative framework now accepted by<br />
Heads of Government.<br />
It would confer a great advantage on our efforts if local<br />
government were to actively participate in our<br />
initiatives. We will continue to encourage practical cooperation<br />
between Local Government and Aboriginal communities and<br />
organisations particularly the sixty ATSIC Regional<br />
Councils across Australia. </p>

Mr Speaker<br />
Last year, by Act of Parliament supported by all<br />
political parties, we established the Council for<br />
Aboriginal Reconciliation.<br />
In itself, this is evidence of the desire for justice<br />
among Australians.<br />
I have great faith in the Council and its Chairperson,<br />
former Royal Commissioner, Mr Patrick Dodson.<br />
I think the Council offers Australia its greatest chance<br />
of learning that there is no true loyalty or affection<br />
for this country that does not include respect for<br />
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians.<br />
Mr Speaker<br />
These issues are central to our nation and its future.<br />
They are also urgent.<br />
As a nation, we face the challenge of the consequences of<br />
dispossession, conquest, brutal treatment and equally<br />
inhuman neglect of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander<br />
people the first Australians.<br />
As I have said more than once in recent months, in this<br />
last decade of the 20th century there is no greater goal<br />
for Australians than the delivery of long overdue justice<br />
to Aboriginal people.<br />
The Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody<br />
reminded us of that.<br />
This year should be the turning point: the year when as a<br />
people we decide that if we are to be truly one nation,<br />
true to our traditions and ideals, then by the year 2000<br />
justice wil have been delivered, and the shame removed. </p>
