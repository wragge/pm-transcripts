-, AS LI( AL EMBARGO: AGAINST DELXVERY<br />
CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY<br />
FO EI THURSDAY, 22 OCTOBER, 1981<br />
STATEMENT TO THE PARLIAMENT ON THE SINAI PEACEKEEPING FORCE<br />
I wish to announce today to Honourable Members the Australian<br />
Government's decision on the question of-Australia's<br />
par ticipation in the proposed Sinai peacekeeping force.<br />
In doing so, I want to set that proposal against the background<br />
of the hi's tory of the Middle East over the last thirty years,<br />
f or it is only against that background that the importance of<br />
the proposal can be judged and the decision relating to<br />
it understood.<br />
Over the last three decades the Middle East has been the most<br />
unstable region in the world. This instability has had many<br />
causes, but what has given it special character has been the<br />
conflict between Israel and the Arab states. This has generated<br />
more bitterness, more hatred, more suspicion than any other<br />
conflict ifl\ the world during this period.<br />
Four times in one generation it led to war: in 1948 immediately<br />
after the creation of Israel; in 1956 during the Suez crisis;<br />
in 1967 and again in 1973. These wars not only disrupted the<br />
region itself, but threatened the peace of the world.<br />
As well as war, the conflict caused a terrible refugee problem,<br />
fed fanaticism and terror, and distorted and warped the lives<br />
of-the countries involved. By the mid-1970.! s. for exam . ple,<br />
Israel found it necessary to spend 36% of its GNP on defence,<br />
with crippling results for its economy.<br />
All efforts to end the conflict, and there were very many, failed<br />
in the face of accumulated suspicion and hostility. The differences<br />
appeared irreconcilable. Then, in November 1977, the nearest<br />
thing to a political miracle in our time occurred.<br />
In an extraordinary act of political courage and vision,<br />
President Anwar Sadat of Egypt flew to Jerusalem and addressed<br />
the Knesset, the Israeli Parliament. This single dramatic act<br />
created a new situation overnight. It set in train a process of<br />
negotiation between Egypt and Israel, with the United States<br />
closely involved. / 2 </p>
<p>-2<br />
within a year, this had culminated in the Camp David Accords<br />
of September 1978, and, in another few months, it resulted in<br />
the Egypt-Israeli peace treaty of March 1979.<br />
These events were generally welcomed as an historic breakthrough.<br />
It was not a matter of believing that all problems were solved,<br />
for clearly there was a long hard road ahead and the principal<br />
actors would need not only great determination and skill, but<br />
all the support they could get from the international community, ifthey<br />
were to complete the journey. But the problems no longer<br />
appeared utterly intractable and a willingness to contemplate<br />
compromise had replaced complete dependence on solution by<br />
the gun.<br />
The Camp David Accords and the peace treaty contained two<br />
essential elements. One dealt with the procedures for<br />
implementing " full autonomy" for the inhabitants of the West Bank<br />
and Gaza after the establishment of an elected self-governing<br />
~ authority', The other dealt with the bilateral aspects of the<br />
peace treaty and, specifically, with the return to Egypt of the<br />
territory. occupied by Israel in the ' Sinai Peninsula during<br />
the earlier fighting.<br />
Several things n eed to be noted about these two parts. First,<br />
they are not separate and discrete but interconnected, two<br />
parts of a total and very carefully negotiated package. In<br />
particular, progress on the future of the occupied territories of<br />
the West Bank and Gaza depends on maintaining confidence at the<br />
bilateral level between Israel and Egypt, and this in turn<br />
depends on the completion of the return of the occupied territor7ies<br />
of the Sinai to Egypt.<br />
Second, the future attitude of the other Arab states to the<br />
Accords is likely to depend very substantially on the successful<br />
carrying out of the Accords as they relate to the Sinai. If<br />
the current reservations and suspicion of the Arab states are to)<br />
diminish, it is essential that they be carried out.<br />
Thirdly, both elements of the peace process require substantial<br />
political and strategic concessions by Israel. These were agreed<br />
to by Israel in return for an agreement on a satisfactory set of<br />
arrangements to guarantee its security. It is here that the<br />
peacekeeping force assumes prominence.<br />
On the basis of the confidence established at. Canp David, Israel<br />
has already withdrawn from approximately two-thirds of the Sinai.<br />
and, given the history of the relationship between the two countries,<br />
that it has done so had been remarkable. It is scheduled to have<br />
withdrawn completely from the Peninsula by the end of April 1982.<br />
But, as the text of the treaty makes clear, that complete<br />
withdrawal is conditional on the existence of a peacekeeping force<br />
which will supervise both the Israeli withdrawal from the Sinai<br />
and the implementation of the security arrangements agreed on in~<br />
the treaty. / 3 </p>
<p>-3<br />
The existence of an effective peacekeeping force in the Sinai,<br />
one which would by its presence secure Israel's southern flank,<br />
is therefore a necessary condition for total withdrawal. It<br />
would also help to create the kind of confidence required for<br />
progress to be made with respect to the West Bank and Gaza.<br />
The existence of such a force would not guarantee success<br />
nothing can do that. But without it there can be little hope.<br />
The peace force that was envisaged in the treaty was a<br />
United Nations force. Unfortunately, it has not been possible<br />
to bring that into being.<br />
The Soviet Union, which has consistently opposed the Camp Davi d<br />
Accords and which vetoed the extension of the mandate of the U. N-.<br />
emergency force, stands as an insurmountable obstacle to its<br />
creation. The Soviet Union has consistently adopted an<br />
obstructionist approach to the search for a Middle East peace,<br />
has sought to encourage and take advantage of instability and<br />
Ito position itself to make strategic gains.<br />
The question has been, therefore, whether faced with the Soviet<br />
veto, there should be no force at all with the disastrous<br />
consequences that would entail in the whole peace process or<br />
whether there should be an international peacekeeping force outside<br />
the United Nations system. In considering that question it should<br />
be noted that the likelihood of a Soviet veto was anticipated<br />
at the time of the signing of the treaty.<br />
In letters to both President Sadat and Prime Minister Begin,<br />
President Carter undertook that, " if the Security Council fails<br />
to establish and maintain the arrangements called for in the<br />
treaty, the President will be prepared to take those steps<br />
necessary to ensure the establishment and maintenance of an<br />
acceptable alternative multinational force". That letter and the<br />
assurance it gave were an integral component of the agreement<br />
reached by Egypt and Israel in 1979.<br />
The Australian Government believes that while it would have been<br />
prefereable for the" Sinai peacekeeping force to be established<br />
under a United Nations mandate If that is ruled out by the<br />
position taken by the Soviet Union-then in terms of what is at<br />
stake, in terms of peace in this highly sensitive region, it<br />
is infinitely preferable that there should be an international<br />
peacekeeping force created outside United Nations auspices than<br />
that the whole peace process should be frustrated by the absence<br />
of any force at all.<br />
Let me add that we should be careful, in a situation where it<br />
is possible to take significant initiatives for peace, before<br />
we circumscribe them by establishing circumstances in which the<br />
Soviet Union would gain a permanent capacity to interpose a<br />
veto, for that might give to the Soviet Union a greater power than<br />
it could manage on its own account to thwart and frustrate<br />
progress towards peace. / 4 </p>
<p>-4<br />
Granted that the need for a peacekeeping force to support the<br />
continuation of the Israeli-Egyptian peace treaty is accepted<br />
the question remains as to whether Australia itself should<br />
participate in such a force.<br />
No-one would pretend that this is an easy question to answer<br />
and this Government has deliberated long and hard over it.<br />
I make no apology at all for the time we have taken in coming<br />
to a decision. There are-considerations which weigh for and<br />
against participation, and these were set out in the statement<br />
to this House by the Minister for Foreign Affairs on 26 May.<br />
A number of major arguments point in the direction of<br />
participation. Participation by Australia would encourage the<br />
formation of a more broadly-based peacekeeping force which<br />
would enhance prospects for international acceptance of the<br />
peacekeeping force a force which is needed to ensure that<br />
Israel's withdrawal from the Sinai can be carried out in accordance<br />
with inte~ rnational commitments; Australia has given strong<br />
support to the development of the peace process in the Middle<br />
East and has a responsibility to follow up with practical<br />
assistance; President Sadat took great political risks in<br />
initiating and persevering with the peace process and it is<br />
vital for his successors who have committed themselves to<br />
support that peace process that the remaining third of Sinai<br />
still under Israeli control be regained by Egypt in April 1982;<br />
the failure, of Australia and other Western countries to<br />
participate would require the United States to bear the burden<br />
itself and would be seen as a failure by the West to support<br />
United States policies in the middle East. This would risk<br />
giving propaganda opportunities to the Soviet Union, whereas<br />
participati-on in peacekeeping would encourage constructive<br />
United States involvement in efforts to bring about a lasting<br />
settlement of Arab/ Israeli differences. our participation would<br />
be welcomed by Egypt and Israel, as well as the United States,<br />
and our participation would imply our continuing support for<br />
Israel's security; it would have positive impact on Israel's<br />
approach to negotiating similar arrangements for its other borders.<br />
A number of arguments have also been used against Australian<br />
participation. It is sometimes said that our policy has been to<br />
participate only in United Nations sponsored peacekeeping<br />
operations, and that a force which was not broadly based would find<br />
little international acceptance. Some have said that the<br />
Middle East is remote from Australia and that the reactions of other<br />
states in the region might be adverse. Some have said that the<br />
extent of any Australian commitment would be uncertain and<br />
potentially too extensive, especially in view of our commitment<br />
to participate in peacekeeping in Namibia. Some have said that<br />
participation in a peacekeeping force in such a volatile area<br />
is too risky, and that it might even result in an adverse impact<br />
oii supoprL it Australia for our relation.-.-io with the Unil: d States. </p>
<p>While there are weighty considerations on both sides a number<br />
of factors have led the Government to the view that Australia<br />
must be prepared to contribute to the multinational peacekeeping<br />
force.<br />
The starting point is that Australia has a clear and strong<br />
national interest in the progress of peace in the Middle East.<br />
It is first and foremost a matter of deciding what it is in our<br />
own national interest to do, and then acting accordingly.<br />
Without question, the continued progress towards peace in the<br />
Middle East is of enormous significance to Australia. An<br />
outbreak of conflict would have repercussions not only for the<br />
region but for the peace of the world which would affect us<br />
profoundly and in manifold ways. It would affect our allies and<br />
friends in ways which could not but impinge greatly on our<br />
international relationships and with risks for the strategic<br />
1alance of great moment to our national security. Australia'* s<br />
interest is in seeing what is probably the single most serious<br />
threat to world peace removed. Further warfare in the Middle<br />
East could trigger off a much wider war.<br />
Australia has a legitimate interest in preventing this. This<br />
point is so evidently true that I believe it does not require<br />
elaboration here. There is also the economic fact that Egypt is<br />
Australia's largest single trading partner in the Middle East.<br />
As the Deputy Prime Minister said in the House yesterday, a stable<br />
Egypt is very important to the whole of our trade with the<br />
Middle East region. It is in the interests of Australia and<br />
the whole world that Egypt's stability be maintained, and this<br />
maintenance requires continued international support for the<br />
policies commenced by President Sadat, and which his successor<br />
President Mubarek is pledged to continue. That we have an<br />
interest in peace, rather than war, in the Middle East is, I<br />
believe, indisputable.<br />
This leads to the second fact which has weighed in our decision<br />
that the peace process which has been begun in the region under<br />
the Camp David Accords is the only framework for peace which has<br />
been put forward in the long history of that region which<br />
shows some prospect of achieving its immediate objectives. While other<br />
proposals have been made from time to time, none has yet achieved the<br />
degree of acceptance from Israel and Egypt the Camp David<br />
Accords have achieved.<br />
Senator Church made this point eloquently in Canberra yesterday<br />
when he said: " There has been much said for and against the.<br />
Camp David Accords, but remember that those Accords, though they<br />
are still only partially implemented and far from perfect<br />
represent the only formula that has yet achieved a peace in this<br />
part of the world..."<br />
i. central ip~ irt of the Caiiip David process i s the cst-b 1 . L; hi'mli-of a<br />
pe-: acekeepinq force in the Sinai. The Government is aware~ that many<br />
Arab Governments have stated public opposition to the Camp<br />
David Accords. The Government believes, however, that thcere is<br />
support for the concept of. returningj Arab land to Arab sovereignty:<br />
in this case returning Sinai to its rightful owner, the Govornment<br />
of Egypt. </p>
<p>6<br />
The Government attaches great importance to its relations with<br />
Arab countries, and understands their wish to achieve<br />
a settlement which makes proper provision for the interests of<br />
the Palestinian people. Australia hopes that its relations with<br />
Arab countries will continue to develop. There is<br />
a growing realisation that many countries including a major part of the<br />
Arab world, are seeking the same objective peace.<br />
Given that peace in the Middle East is in Australia's national<br />
interest, and given that the only existent basis for peace is<br />
Israeli-Egyptian accommodation, and the establishment of a<br />
multinational peackeeping force, Australia cannot avoid the<br />
cuestion: do we have a capacity to make a contribution to the<br />
peace process by membership in that force?<br />
One fact is plain: there is a limit to what Australia as a<br />
middle power can do. We must avoid an unrealistic<br />
view of what we can achieve. But to say that there are limits<br />
is in no way to say that we could not make a useful and a<br />
valuable contribution, in conjunction with other countries who<br />
share our interests and our concern for peace in the region.<br />
Egypt, Israel and the United States the nations which signed the<br />
agreement in August this year providing for the establishment of<br />
a multinational peacekeeping force have made it clear that<br />
they would welcome Australian participation in the force.<br />
: ndeed, they have indicated that they attach great importance to<br />
our participation and that the assassination of President Sadat<br />
has made that participation even more important to them.<br />
President Sadat's successor, President Mubarek, has indicated<br />
his determination to remain on the course set by his predecessor.<br />
President Sadat's assassination has in fact created a greater need<br />
for international recognition of the conditions for peace in<br />
the Middle East.<br />
Egypt without President Sadat needs more support from other nations<br />
S-o continue the peace process than Egypt with President Sadat,<br />
and the Egyptian Government made clear to the Deputy Prime Minister<br />
on his recent visit that this was very much its own perspective.<br />
This consideration has weighed with the Government and has been<br />
significant in tipping the balance in favour of participation in<br />
the peacekeeping force. We have a capacity to contribute, and<br />
our contribution is sought by the countries most closely involved.<br />
These facts place the most weighty responsibility on us.<br />
This Government has never taken the view that Australia should<br />
refrain from doing what it can to create a better and more<br />
peaceful world. Within realistic limits we have consistently<br />
argued that Australia has responsibilities, and must recognise<br />
those responsibilities in our actions.<br />
iAustralia has had recent involvement in peacekeeping in the<br />
: iddle East: Austral . i n forces were part o. the U. N. pcacekeeping<br />
corces in the Sinai 1: rr'rio 1976 to 1979 and were only withdrawn<br />
when the Soviet Union indicated that it would veto an extension<br />
&gt; F the force's U. N. mandate. / 7 </p>
<p>-7<br />
In this case it would obviously be more comfortable to do<br />
nothing to say that peace in the Middle East does not concern<br />
us, or that we cannot contribute to peace. But neither of those<br />
propositions would be true. Those attitudes widely adopted<br />
amongst nations in other times and in other conflicts have led<br />
in the end to catastrophic war. If all nations wanting peace<br />
were to leave the active pursuit of peace to others, peace would<br />
fail by default and we would all bear the tragic costs.<br />
Australia is concerned. We can contribute. And accordingly,<br />
we have decided, provided certain reasonable conditions are met,:<br />
to make a contribution to the multinational force.<br />
On 12 October .1 wrote to President Reagan informing him that the"<br />
Australian Government would agree to participate in the peacekeeping<br />
force if certain conditions were met. I informed President Reagan<br />
that the Government has decided that Australia will agree to<br />
S? participate in the Sinai peacekeeping force subject to Britain and<br />
WCanada also agreeing to participate.<br />
In the interests of obtaining the broadest-based international<br />
acceptance of the force, significant European participation is a<br />
critical factor. We are glad to see from published reports that<br />
France is reconsidering her attitude. The Australian contribution<br />
would be limited to th * e contribution we are initially called upon<br />
to make, and that contribution will be of limited duration to be agreed.<br />
Apart from the membership of the peacekeeping force there are<br />
other matters which the Government believes are important to<br />
Frovide full protection for Australia's independence and<br />
sovereignty, and which were set out in my letter to President Reagan.<br />
As is usual practice, we would need to instruct the commander of<br />
any Australian contingent that if he received orders from the<br />
commander of the force which he believed were contrary to, or went<br />
beyond, the agreed purposes of the force, he should not comply<br />
with them until he had consulted with Australian authorities.<br />
SNo part of the peacekeeping force ( including the United States<br />
Wcomponent) should have any association with the United States<br />
Rapid Deployment Force.<br />
A, solution to the Palestinian issue is clearly central to the<br />
future stability and peace of the Middle East. In participating<br />
in the Sinai peacekeeping force we would be concerned that our<br />
contribution would have the maximum positive influence in continuing<br />
and broadening the peace process in the Middle East..<br />
Australia has consistently supported the continuing peace process<br />
but we have been disappointed by the lack of progress and prospects<br />
for further movement in the autonomy negotiations.<br />

<p>8-<br />
We recognise how much the United States has been doing in an<br />
endeavour to establish lasting peace in the Middle East.<br />
We recognise also what President Sadat and Prime Minister Begin<br />
were trying to do in their search for a peaceful solution.<br />
It is important for the Middle East and for the whole world<br />
that these efforts should be continued ar~ d should have the<br />
widest possible support.<br />
Our participation in the peacekeeping force would be on the<br />
understanding that all the parties to the Accords abided by<br />
word and deed with their provisions, and press forward with a<br />
continuing peace process in the Middle East. The conditions neaess3-ary<br />
for Australia's participation have all been conveyed in the clearest<br />
terms to President Reagan. The Australian contribution under<br />
consideration at present comprises elements of an air transport-unit,<br />
equipped with helicopters and fixed wing aircraft, and probably<br />
involving some 200-300 personnel. But the precise composition of<br />
cur contribution will of course depend on the outcome of discussions<br />
1with other participants. I want to set out step by step the<br />
timing of the decision and the discussions and consultations<br />
which led up to it, because it is important that there should be<br />
no misunderstandings about this. During the Commonwealth Heads of<br />
Government Meeting I would obviously want to have consulted with<br />
leaders, and at the time President Reagan put the same suggestion<br />
to me and to certain other countries. I consulted with the Prime<br />
flinisters of Canada, New Zealand and the United Kingdm in Melbourne during the<br />
Conference. And then following the assassination of President Sadat, the<br />
Deputy Prime Minister consulted with Secretary of State Haig,<br />
Dr. MacGuigan, Lord Carrington and Mr. Colombo, who were in Cairo<br />
for President Sadat's funeral. These consultations in Cairo<br />
took place on 10 October, and I was informed of their content<br />
by cable and i~ n telephone conversations with the Deputy Prime Minister.<br />
The decision that Australia would participate under the conditions<br />
I have already outlined was taken on 12 October. And I want to<br />
make it plain that that decision was taken after consultation<br />
with, and with the agreement of, the Deputy Prime Minister<br />
who was overseas at the time.<br />
The Government's decision about participation in the peacekeeping<br />
force and the conditions for that participation<br />
was conveyed by letter to the President of the United States<br />
and to the Prime Ministers of Great Britain and Canada on<br />
12 October and the Prime Minister of New Zealand was subsequently<br />
advised of our position. It will be obvious to the House that.<br />
while Australia's decision was taken on a completely independent<br />
basis, the practical commitment which will flow from it will<br />
depend upon the decisions of other Governments, and this is why<br />
I said in the House on Tuesday that " there is no procrastination<br />
on this issue by this Government" and also that " I expect to be<br />
in a position to make some announcement about this decision in<br />
the relatively near future, but that is not necessarily waiting<br />
on decisionFs of this Government, but decisions of other Gov'ernmients"<br />
/ 9 </p>
<p>9-<br />
It was appropriate, in view of the conditional nature of<br />
Australia's decision, that the other Governments should have some<br />
time to formulate their own positions in relation to that, but<br />
it is the view of the Government that events have now moved ahead<br />
and that Australia's decision should be made known.<br />
The Australian Government believes that this multinational<br />
peacekeeping force is a significant step for peace. It is not<br />
a decision which is pro-Arab or pro-Israeli. It is a decision<br />
pro-peace. It is a decision which could never have been made had<br />
President Sadat not taken his historic initiatives.<br />
The assassination of President Sadat has strengthened, not<br />
weakened, the need for international support for the peace process.<br />
A role of the utmost importance now falls on Prime Minister Begin.<br />
Many have questioned his approach to peace and the implications<br />
of his policies.<br />
Australia has made abundantly clear on many occasions, its<br />
support for the State of Israel behind secure and recognized borders<br />
as specified in U. N. Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338. our<br />
credentials on that matter are not exceeded by any nation. So let<br />
me from that point of support and friendship say that much will<br />
now depend on Prime Minister Begin and on the Israeli Parliament.<br />
There are many who believe that it was President Sadat who was<br />
foremost in carrying the banner for peace in the Middle East.<br />
Nothwithstanding that Prime Minister Begin has fully participated in<br />
the progress) to that point, with President Sadat's death there now falls<br />
to Prime U1inister Begin the opportunity to hold aloft the banner of<br />
peace that President Sadat carried with such courage. Prime Minister Begin<br />
nav has the opportunity to make sure that the autonomy talks are meaningful,<br />
and do all that he can to bring about positive results. Let him<br />
make-sure that there is a true and fitting memorial to<br />
President Sadat in a peace settlement that can endure and that<br />
leads to a wider settlement in the Middle East.<br />
There is a challenge before Prime Minister Begin, Israel, Egypt<br />
and other countries such as the United States to act with vigour<br />
0 and initiative so that those who celebrated President Sadat's death<br />
by firing their guns for joy are confounded, and the terrorists<br />
and promoters of discord are defeated. And let those who have used<br />
terror as an instrument recognise, with the vision of a Sadat,<br />
that the true road to peace lies in a recognition of Israel's<br />
right to exist then discussion and negotiation can replace the<br />
sound of gunfire.<br />
In making this commitmnent I wish to emnphasise that what<br />
Australia will contribute to is a peacekeeping force not to<br />
a conflict. The Sinai peacekeeping force will not be taking sides<br />
with either Egypt or Israel. It is not going to be involved in<br />
either military attack or defence in any military sense. Its<br />
role is to monitor, to observe. </p>
<p>10<br />
I consider it most understandable that when two countries,<br />
with a long and sorry history of mutual conflict, decide to<br />
put this history behind them and engage in a new era of<br />
peace, they should wish to have mutual friends in whom they<br />
can have confidence to assist them in the sensitive business<br />
of overcoming past suspicions. The Sinai peacekeeping force<br />
is to play the role of mutual friend.<br />
If the time should come when either party should wish to attack<br />
the Sinai force, then the whole peace process would have come to<br />
an end. By definition the force's role would already have come.<br />
to an end and it would leave the region. But this situation wiIl<br />
not come about, and it will not come about because Australia and<br />
other countries are ready to play their part, which is after all<br />
a modest part, in ensuring that Israel and Egypt pursue their<br />
mutually declared objective of developing a new and friendly<br />
relationship.<br />
I realise that at the moment there are differences of. view<br />
on this important issue. I hope that<br />
Honourable Members and the Australian public will give very<br />
careful consideration to all the considerations I have mentioned<br />
and will agree that in the end the right course for Australia<br />
is the one the Government has decided to take.<br />
Australia has played a significant role over many years by its<br />
willingness to contribute to peacekeeping forces in trouble spots<br />
around the world, and while this particular decision has been more<br />
finely balahced than others, I have no doubt that in the end the<br />
easier decision would be irresponsible and wrong. The easier<br />
decision would be one we might well live to regret, for surely<br />
none of us would want the situation in which a failure on our<br />
part to help two countries in their search for a lasting peace<br />
might contribute to increasing instability in a region where it<br />
is the interest of Australia as of the whole world that there<br />
should be increasing stability.<br />
I appeal to Members of the Opposition not to seek to divide<br />
Australia on this issue. I appeal to them not to be swayed by<br />
talk of war when the proposition and possible prospect is one<br />
of peace for one of the most war-torn parts of the whole world,<br />
The conditions wrapped around this particular decision are such<br />
that all parties can accept the decision itself as one that in no<br />
way derogates from Australia's sovereignty, as one that<br />
recognises our responsibilities to do what we can to help achieve<br />
the objectives of peace that is so close to the hearts of<br />
Australians, as one that is in Australia's widest national interest.<br />
