PRESS CONFERENCE GIVEN BY THE PRIAvE MINISTER,<br />
THE RT. HON. R. G. r.' ENZIES, IN MELBOURNE, ON<br />
13~ TH DECEMBER, 1961<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I would just like to start in my own way, if I may.<br />
As you know I have a long established practice of not<br />
making a comment on election results until they are<br />
reasonably clear, and in a normal election they would<br />
have been reasonably clear by now. But it seemed to me<br />
that if I refrained from saying anything too long it<br />
might lead to misinterpretation so, while the results are<br />
not final, perhaps I ought to say something about them.<br />
It would be foolish to say I am not surprised by the<br />
vote. So is Mr. Calwell, and so are you. de are all<br />
surprised. It was reasonable to assume " Chat after 12 years and<br />
with the argument that had gone on about the economic<br />
policy there would be some losses on the part of the<br />
Government that was to be expected, and we all expected<br />
it. But t~Ã± e odd thing about this election not so odd,<br />
well I' 11 use the wiord " odd" is that in ? I4estern<br />
Australia, in South Australia, in Tasmania, and in<br />
Victoria, the movement of votes has been no more than you<br />
would expect after a Government has been in office for 12<br />
years I don't know yet what the final result is in<br />
Kal. goorlie or in Stirling, I don't know, But Kalgoorlie<br />
was one of those miracle wins in 1958 in a Labour stronghold<br />
and if Mr. Browne is defeated which he doesn't<br />
concede yet~ and I don't concede It will be by a very<br />
narrow margin; and similarly with Mr. Cash in Stirling.<br />
Also in gestern Australia the prospects Ithink, are<br />
very high that the Government will win three Senate<br />
seats, In WJestern Australia the changes are mer'ely<br />
fractional, if any. dell, they exist of course, but they<br />
are very, very marginal. The same in South Australia,<br />
same in Victoria, On a big swing against the Government<br />
who would have thought we would hold Maribyrnong? Yet<br />
Maribyrnong looks like being held, Seats once regarded<br />
as marginal like Corio zare strongly held and so on.<br />
Tasmania, no change. So that in four States out of six<br />
the movement in the voting has been no more than one<br />
might have sensibly expected<br />
New South . Iales, where the Government's economic<br />
policies. I think were more violently resented than in<br />
other States, well there were a couple of marginal seats.<br />
I admit that I am very concerned about the position of<br />
Mr. Osborne in E~ vans. I don't yet know finally any more<br />
than anybody else what is going to happen in Hume. And<br />
there is Cowper. Yes, let's face up to it, the losses,<br />
or prospective losses, in New South " Jales are greater<br />
than I would have expected.<br />
But the key State has been Queensland. And the<br />
Queensland vote is not to be explained on the basis of<br />
the little lag that comes at the end of a 12 years'<br />
term; nor is it to be explained more than fractionally<br />
by the economic policy. It is not reasonable to assume<br />
that its impact in Queensland would be more violent than<br />
in New South 1ales, or in Victoria. But undoubtedly in<br />
Queensland the electors had come to believe, as I think<br />
quite wrongly, that Queensland had had a poor deal in the<br />
treatment of the States by the Commonwdealth, I don't<br />
want to argue about that I may be arguing about it<br />
quite a lot before I am all that much older, </p>
<p>I think there was a -wide misunderstanding on this<br />
matter, but unquestionably on Polling Day and no doubt<br />
for weeks and weeks and 4ieek-1-s before it, the people of<br />
Queensland -felt that *.'. ueenslarid was a neglected State.<br />
N othing else could explain this phenomonal overturn of<br />
votes, particularly concentrated, in quantitative terms,<br />
on Ministers like Mr. Hulme and Dr, Cameron, each of whom<br />
has done a splendid piece of vork in his own right, but<br />
who were between them held responsible for what was said<br />
to be the neglect of Queensland,<br />
And in the result, well I don't yet know wuhat is<br />
going to happen maybe 50-50, myeavr iemjrt<br />
resolving a f' w doubts, perhaps, rather imp-Crobably, out.<br />
All right, well, if we are out we are out. I'm not<br />
saying we are out I don~ t think we're out but if we<br />
aie then all I can say is the eople of Australia have<br />
given me their confidence for a long time and therefore<br />
I have no 2ers onal grievance, none at all. I don't say<br />
that we ar.. out I would think that the worst was 50-50<br />
or, 9 to be more precise, 61-61. I suppose that by the end<br />
of the week we will know what the results are they have<br />
been rather long drawn out. I feel rather like King<br />
Charles, you know, who apologised for being such an<br />
unconscionable. time a-dying. But the time has gone on<br />
and no doubt we will know by the end of the week.<br />
Whichever way it goes a dead-lock or majority T<br />
am inviting my Ministers and my Members, that is to say<br />
the surviving Members, to meet me in Canberra on Tuesday<br />
of next week. Members have to meet because they have to<br />
deal with such matters as the election of a leader and<br />
deputy leader; and of course Ministers will need to meet<br />
because we will need to concert our ideas on what we do.<br />
And I don't profess to know the ., nswer yet.<br />
Suppose we were even 61-61. All right, well, you<br />
might very properly say that that will inevitably lead in<br />
due course to a dissolution and another election, since<br />
neither side could carry on an effective Government in<br />
the House with 61 all. We put a Speaker into the chair,<br />
we are out-numbered; th-e other side put a Speaker into<br />
the chair and they are out-numbered: we are in exactly<br />
the same case if it's 61-614 But you can't dissolve a<br />
new Parliament, of course, until the Parliament has been<br />
created and that depends on when the writs are returned<br />
and the procedures for calling a new Parliament<br />
together I ': ontt prophesy about that, but no doubt that<br />
would be relatively early in the New Year,<br />
If, on the other hand, we have a majority in the<br />
new House, well, we have a majority, and we go along.<br />
it is very interesting to recall you know that<br />
after the 1954+ election, ihen Dr. Evatt produced. his<br />
promises, and we were not long after2 a spate of<br />
unemployment and the budget, which was called the<br />
" horror budget", you remember, by somebody or other, and<br />
we were a little bit unpopular a " little bit" is a<br />
euphemism I think we did win in 1951+: we had a<br />
majority of seven. Well, there it is, it was a small<br />
majority. In the next election it was seventeen, and in<br />
the next one it was 32. So that one mustn't become too<br />
dogmatic about the size of majorities. The one thing I<br />
am interested in at present is to have one. And, as I<br />
say, I don't yet know. </p>
<p>It's all very well to say that in a campaign. you<br />
must expect casualties of course you do but I do feel<br />
very sad about losing good colleagues. If I might talk<br />
particularly about Ministers I have said something<br />
about Mr. 1-ulme of Supply, and Dr. Cameron of Health, for<br />
he has a wonderful record of achievement for this<br />
country, and I am told today that Mr. Osborne is in grave<br />
danger he has boen doing extraordinarily well at<br />
Repatriation it is a great pity that such men should<br />
be lost to the service of the country. But still we have<br />
elections so that people may say what side they want<br />
and being a democrat I am all for it so I must have my<br />
sorrow for my colleagues in private; and in public<br />
recognise that it is not for me to complain I have won<br />
five elections up to this one so I can hardly accuse the<br />
people of being unkind or ungenerous.<br />
I am not going to repeat the speectes that were made<br />
during the campaign: I think it is tremendously<br />
important that the Government should remain in office;<br />
but I thirKc it is very important that Australia should<br />
have a Government with authority, because, overseas in<br />
particular, there are questions to be thrashed out in<br />
the next six months in the resolution of which the voice<br />
of Australia oughit to be clear and powerful.<br />
If it turns out that we have a majority, all right,<br />
we naturally will go on. A majority is a majority. Anu,<br />
i: you might allow me to say something that is quite<br />
homely, a majority is better than a minority, from the<br />
point of view of a Government. If it turns out that it<br />
is a dead-lock then quite plainly, at the appropriate<br />
time, and I don't profess to know because I haven't<br />
looked at the prescriptions on this matter you know<br />
about the reassembling of Parliament and so on then it<br />
will become very important that next time the people<br />
should produce a Government that is in possession of a<br />
majority. And of course the whimsical part about that<br />
is that it means that if there is another election<br />
somebody will have to change his mind, or his vote,<br />
because if everybody votes in the same way and we are<br />
back again in a deadlock, the only sufferer will be<br />
Australia, because it will have-committed itself to<br />
having no Government. Anyhow, ' Tuesday morning I will<br />
talk to my Mvinisterial colleagues and Tuesday afternoon<br />
to the Members.<br />
QUESTION: Are you suggesting, Sir, that the election would be<br />
perhaps in March?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Look, I don't know. Anybo. y can work that out as<br />
well as I can. You see a lot of people think that you<br />
can at once proceed to have an election. Of course you<br />
can't. The old Parliament is dissolved and the new<br />
Parliament hasn't been created; and the new Parliament<br />
is created -when the writs are returned and Members are<br />
sworn in. I don't, off-hand, know Akn that is. I am<br />
going to Canberra I will be there tomorrow and I<br />
will have an opportunity of looking into that. But<br />
until the new Parliament is assembled and created,<br />
officially, you know, technically, then there can be no<br />
question of dissolving something that doesn't exist.<br />
I'm not going to offer a view on the dates. </p>
<p>QUESTION: Do you concede, Sir, that a possible majority of<br />
only one, after providing a Speaker, is a -working<br />
majority, that could be carried on indefinitely?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: If we have a majority of two, and one goes into the<br />
chair, then we have a majority of one on the floor of<br />
the ' House. These are interesting speculations. You<br />
know there was a time in the history of the Commonwealth<br />
Parliament when a Government existed for quite a time on<br />
the casting vote of the Speaker not a very satisfactory<br />
state of affairs, I would pray to be delivered from it.<br />
But if it came to me I would accept it being a<br />
realist on the principle that a majority of one is a<br />
majority.<br />
QUESTION: When was that Sir?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Befere the<br />
1914+ wasn't it?<br />
majority of' one<br />
casting; votes.<br />
QUESTION: First World War you must check it up<br />
( 1913 or 1914+, something like that). A<br />
and the Speaker got worn out making<br />
But of course in this Parliament, which has even<br />
numbers they were odd numbers at that time 759 You<br />
s'e) e, 38 to 37, so they were even-ateven on the floor of<br />
the House the Speaker had to give the casting vote.<br />
But if you have 62 60 then the Speaker, if everybody<br />
votes, does not have to cast a casting vote, the<br />
Government wins by 61<br />
Wouldn't this create extreme difficulty in cases of<br />
the Prime Ministers' Conference?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I would think so. Of course we have the practice in<br />
the House of Representatives of having pairs and if you<br />
have a majority you can adjourn Parliament for long<br />
enough to permit of an attendance. So that technically,<br />
it's all right, but substantially I agree with you: I<br />
wouldn't think it a very happy state of affairs.<br />
QUESTION: If you had to approach another election, Mr. M~ enzies,<br />
would you take the optimistic view that a greater number<br />
of people had voted at the last Polls to frighten you<br />
rather than to encourage Labour?<br />
PRIME MINISTamj.. You know I am neither a prophet, nor the son of a<br />
prophet. Of course there are factors in this matter. No<br />
doubt there were a lot of people who said, " We'll give<br />
him a fright", " They need a better opposition", " W~ e'll<br />
stir them up". You know, and I know, that there are lots<br />
of people like that, but whether they represent a<br />
determining factor in an election I wouldn't like to say.<br />
I admit their existence. There may be other people '-Ath<br />
quite different views, but I don't think you know, that<br />
a second election at a relatively early late would<br />
necessarily be a Chinese copy of the current one, no.<br />
But I would hope that that election would decide the<br />
problem so that ordinary Australians would know where<br />
they were, and what Government they had. That is the<br />
important thing.<br />
QUESTION: PRIME MINISTE'F Would you care to further define a Chinese copy?<br />
Is that one of those expressions 1 use that is<br />
capable of misquotation? You know you would almost<br />
think I was stirring up the Immigration policy. It is a<br />
phrase with which you, I know, are very familiar. I'm<br />
not at all sure you weren't the first fellow to teach me<br />
years ago. Well let's call it a literal copy. </p>
<p>QUESTION: I remember once making a statement about something<br />
and saying that I thought I detected the fine Italian<br />
hand of Mr. so-and-so in this statement, and there was a<br />
frightful uproar. " He would have me know that he had no<br />
Italian blood whatever..." 1 One must not use these<br />
literary allusions, you must make a note of that.<br />
All right, well, you know the old biblical<br />
instruction, Mr Tebbutt -Itm speaking to you because I<br />
know that you're susceptible to these things " Watch<br />
and pray lest ye enter into temptation". I don't know<br />
what that means in effect, but Douglas Wdilkie he knows<br />
everything heill tell you. Any more macabre<br />
questions? Just one more, Sir, on the Common Market, Does it<br />
affect your immediate consideration, your immediate<br />
pians?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well it doesn't affect mine, if you are asking<br />
about mine, because I had not contemplated that I might<br />
have to go there before March, April, or whatever it<br />
might be. But if it's 50O-50 and if, therefore, we are<br />
all getting ready for another election, well, of course,<br />
it would become inmpossible for Mr. McEwen to be there.<br />
I had always thought that he might be there ahead of me,<br />
because he is in very close contact with these matters,<br />
and that I think would be a pity, but still...<br />
What do you think of Mr. Calwell's view that if<br />
the result is 61-61, the Labour Party has a manda~ e<br />
because of the majority of primary votes and therefore<br />
should ask the Liberal Party to supply a Speaker and<br />
form a caretaker Government?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well I think that i~ s exactly what I would expect an<br />
Opposition Leader to say but of course it is useless<br />
observation. Parliament makes or unmakes Government.<br />
Why, how amusing it would be if I said, " Well, yes, I'm<br />
very impressed by that", so I resign and I tell the<br />
Governor-General to send for Mr. Calwell and then M~ r.<br />
Calwell elects a Speaker in the new Parliament and I<br />
toss him out on a vote of no confidence. Let's talk<br />
practical sense that is a very unreal remark. I don't<br />
blame Mr. Calwell for making it because he is as<br />
surprised as I am by the results and is therefore,<br />
perhaps, a little excited. Oh, no, that shot is not on.<br />
QUESTION: Sir, the Leader of the Opposition Mr. Calwell, has<br />
also said that this will be the first time that either<br />
the Liberal or Country Party has had to face sustained<br />
pressure and he feels that the Liberal/ Coun~ ry Party is<br />
the kind of Party that crumbles on pressure'<br />
PRIME MINISTEi: I notice he said that, Well, all I can say is that<br />
his Party must be the greatest authority on crumbling in<br />
the history of Australia, and I'll. always bo willing to<br />
take his expert opinion.<br />
QUESTION: Do you think that perhaps his g-ains in these<br />
elections have 6, iven the Labour Party a new sense of<br />
power unity?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I don't know. Who am I to explain the mind of the<br />
Labour Party? I have been trying for years to<br />
understand it without success. He needn't worry about<br />
my side of the House crumbling.<br />
QUET ION: </p>
<p>QUESTION: If itts 61-61 then, Sir, you will remain in office<br />
and have an election, tht is the general thought in<br />
your mind?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: If itts 61-61 we will meet the Parliament, the<br />
Parliament will make a decision you're guess is as<br />
good as mine as to what this decision will be then I<br />
think you might lay a reasonable shade of odds that we<br />
will be out electioneering in the summer, in the<br />
tropics 2<br />
QUESTION: Will you use television this time?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: WJell I did last time, Whether one uses television<br />
or whether television uses one, I wouldn't like to sayr,<br />
it's a very difficult medium. Well go honB boys, thank<br />
you very much.<br />
Do you know this is the fifteenth election Ive had<br />
personally, do you know that? Fifteen. And I thought I<br />
knew e-: ery noise an election campaign made and could form<br />
a pretty rough idea as to whether the tide was coming in<br />
or out, I confess to you this one was a surprise this<br />
was a dumper, in Queensland. Is that the right<br />
expression? I'm not a surfing character.<br />
QUESTION: Are you being kept in touch continually with the<br />
results or are you just waiting,...?<br />
PRTME MINISTER: Oh, about half a dozen times a day we find out what<br />
the last thing is, But you see there are very curious,..<br />
Now Maribyrnong: I'm told that nothing more will emerge<br />
from Maribyrnong until Friday night, and there you are.<br />
And of course other seats Maranoa. Well, of course<br />
Brimblecombe will hold Maranoa because Maranoa is running<br />
true to the pattern. You see they will all come in.<br />
H-ume, we won't know finally about for some days.<br />
QUESTION:. Would you say it all supports Churchill's thesis<br />
that preferential voting is unsatisfactory?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No. I believe in preferential voting I do indeed,<br />
I am a gr:.. at sceptic about proportional voting, but<br />
preferential voting for the Lower House is, Ithink,<br />
first class. Quite frankly I've never understood why<br />
they don't have it in Great Britain.<br />
QUESTION: Proportional voting has gone on for the Senate<br />
throughout your 12 years of office?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Yes, I know. Once the system of voting for the<br />
Senate is established, it is very difficult to change it<br />
because only half go out at a time. And to have half<br />
elected under one system and another half elected under<br />
another system is very difficul-t, and there it is. But<br />
make no mistake under the system ofvoting for the Senate<br />
no Government will have a Senate majority, no Government<br />
that lasts more than a year or two will have a Senate<br />
majority for all its time, You look back on it, From<br />
19 + 9-51 I had a minority in the Senate and we got out of<br />
that on a double dissolution; from 1955-58 I had<br />
in the Senate and there: fore under the Constitutional rule<br />
that where the voting is equal in thie Senate the negative<br />
prevails, I wasn't in command of the Senate in 195' 5-58,<br />
but we got along.<br />
QUESTION: The Senate is not your major worry in any case?<br />
MR. ! vNZIES: No. </p>
<p>QUESTION: Do you feel that the original purpose of the Senate<br />
has been lost?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Do you want to buy me into a brawl with those two<br />
fellows you know about? No thanks, no. This is not a<br />
time for philosophising about the Senate. It is a time<br />
for being philosophical about your on position.<br />
QUESTION: Mr. Calwell said he thought since democracy is<br />
better served by a clear-cut two-Party system instead of<br />
a multiple-Party system...<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well was that blow directed at me or at the DLP?<br />
We'll save up all these reflections until after<br />
Christmas.<br />
QUESTION: When are you going back to Canberra Sir?<br />
PRIME MINISTE,: I was going back this afternoon but it turns out<br />
that I cant. I'm going back in the morning.<br />
QUESTION: May I ask one personal question, Sir? What is the<br />
symbolism of that tie? It isn't one of your collection<br />
that Itm familiar with.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: , Idell when I -, 1as in Jestern Australia in this<br />
election he Party chartered a plane from MacRobertson<br />
Mil. ler's to take me up to Geraldton with a number of<br />
your brigade you know to a big meeting there, and they<br />
presented me the Captain of the aircraft presented mewith<br />
a MacRobertson Miller tie. And there it is: it's<br />
red that gives me a bit one way; and it was : iven to<br />
me for nothing that's very satisfactory; and they tell<br />
me that Ansett controls the MacRobertson Miller so that<br />
gives me a bit the other way. I put it on this morning<br />
thinking this was a very happy compromise 61-61.<br />
QUESTION: Has this been your most tiring election, Mr.<br />
Menzies?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Oh, I don't know, I did about the same campaign as<br />
I did last time. I find flying very tiring and when you<br />
do about 12,000 miles you're weary. And of course I<br />
don't like great heat. But still I must keep my mind off<br />
that because if there is another election, and if it's in<br />
the summer, I shall have to carry an air-conditioning set<br />
under my waistcoat.<br />
QUESTION: You said that Mr. Calwell is as surprised as you are<br />
Sir, When did this surprise start? Can you tell us what<br />
day, or the result, that started this surprise?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well, on Saturday night at about 10,30 or 11 I<br />
would have put down the losses at 8 or 10. I then<br />
listened ir, until midnight and I then " rumbled it in my<br />
brain" as I lay in my bed and on Sunday morning I sat up<br />
and said, " By jove, thinking it all over, this might be<br />
14 or 15%. And so my surprise you might say, was a subconscious<br />
one between midnight and 8 o'clock on Sunday<br />
morning.<br />
QUESTION: This was before you heard a radio or read the paper<br />
on Sunday?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Oh, yes, You can't read a paper on Sunday in<br />
Melbourne, except the Sydney papers which go to bed the<br />
ones we got when there are about 600 votes9 400 votes,<br />
200 votes, </p>
<p>QUESTION.-Are you finding it possible to relax now, or is it<br />
still a<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I'm a good sleeper. When I put my head on my<br />
pillow I believe in going to sleep. And I have had many<br />
strange and some bitter experiences in my political life,<br />
and I've always put my hoad on the pillow and said,<br />
" That's that". That is why I remain outside thie Lunatic<br />
Asylumr, I suppose, or whatever they call it nowadays.<br />
QUESTION: Could we take a quick shot at this small kite you<br />
obviously deliberately flew a little earlier, Sir, about<br />
Members having to elect a Leader and Deputy Leader? Have<br />
you any new thoughts on any leader or deputy leader there<br />
might be?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No, no, no. But still it has to be done because<br />
yr-1 must, in whatever you are doing, be able to speak<br />
with authority. I haven't heard of somebody who is<br />
going to oppose me, but still they have a perfect right<br />
to. It's free country.,<br />
QUESUI ON: Sir, are these results likely to change your<br />
thinking the Government's thinking as far as the<br />
economic policy is concerned?<br />
PRIME M-' INISTER: You mustn't ask me anything about policy because<br />
that is the kind of thing thatomy colleagues and I wi] ll<br />
ha-e to consider in the light of the circumstances as<br />
t hey emerge. No, I have nothing to say.<br />
All right, boys, now, you have bashed me into the<br />
ground, that's enougha. </p>
