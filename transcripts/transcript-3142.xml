PRI1F T471NISTER' IS SPEDCXH AT THAI-AUSTRALIA ILUNCHEM DUSIT THMAHNO! T1E L<br />
1 FEBRUARY 1974.<br />
I have had many occasions in A~ ustralia and overseas to stress, not<br />
just the change of policies of the new Australian Government, but the<br />
continuity vithin thot changre. Continuity within change is one of the<br />
themes of this current journey. Its re-assertion is one of the purposes<br />
of this visit. The relations between Thailand and Australia perfectly<br />
illustrate that theme. Thailand itself is a splendid example of national<br />
continuity within change, and of chanre within continuity and never more<br />
truly than in this crucial time in Thailand's long history, a time when men<br />
and worren of goodwill around the world are drawinG new hope, new encouragement,<br />
from the events in our region.<br />
Change of quite revolutionary dimension has been the very dssence of<br />
the recent history of our region. One has only to consider that less<br />
than 30 years ago, of the six nations on may current itihierary, Thailand<br />
alone was independent. Or consider that in the great area from the old<br />
north-west frontier of India to the shore of the South west Pacific an<br />
area containing nearly a quarter of the world'Is people Thailand and<br />
Australia alone were not under colonial rule. This is one measure of the<br />
scope of change we have lived with and are still living with. The yearning<br />
for true national independence, for national dignity, which called this vast<br />
change into being is still the most powerful force in our region. That<br />
spirit has preserved the national identity and independence of Thailand for<br />
700 years. It is the sort of spirit which the Australian Government brings<br />
to its own affairs and to Australia's relations with its neighbours, its<br />
friends and its allies. " le have tried to understand the aspiration of<br />
others as we wish others to try to understand our own aspirations.<br />
The Governments of both our countries have changed relatively recently.<br />
Of course we have both changed many of our policies. We are both striking<br />
out on new paths. But in both nations there is also a basic continuity of<br />
policies. Certainly in the case of Australia most publicity has naturally<br />
been given to the changes, to the new directions. Yet it cannot be<br />
stressed too much or too often that there is a basic continuity in the<br />
conduct of Australian affairs.<br />
Many of our decisions have been responses to developments in the<br />
relations between the great powers. We have tried to adapt prornpt~ y and<br />
intelligently to the new realities, particularly in our region. In some<br />
matters, such as normalisaition of relations with China, we have been able<br />
to move more rapidly than some of our neighbours, including Thailand, but<br />
there can be no mistaking the direction events are leading us all. While<br />
developing new relations not just with China but in Akfrica and Latin<br />
-imerica and Eastern Europe we have strengthened old friendships as well.<br />
This is very much the Case with Thailand.<br />
We don't believe it is good enough that Australia should regard<br />
countries like Thailand and her Asian partners merely as some sort Of<br />
military buffer placed by geography for Australia's convenience. We have<br />
defence arrangements with such countries. We continue to: But we want<br />
them to be viewed in the perspective of our total relation with the region.<br />
Far from losing interest in Thailand, the fact is that there has never been<br />
greater mutual interest and wider exchanges between the two countries than<br />
there is now. This interest is growing on both sides. Australia attaches<br />
great importance to the continuing well-being of an independent and forwardlooking<br />
Thailand, a Thailand playing an 8ctive and cooperative role in the<br />
region and adjusting its policies skillfully to the developing international<br />
situation. Australia and Thailand are expanding their cooperation in all fields.<br />
More Australians than ever before Eire coming to Th. oiland in my own case<br />
this is my eighth visit in the last fourteen years. M~ any Thais have<br />
studied in kustralia and more will come in the future. This co-operation<br />
has developed steadily over nearly 50 years, since Australia established a<br />
mission in Thailand. That mission was one of the first Australian posts </p>
<p>2-<br />
to be opened in South-East Asia. A high point in the development of<br />
our relations was the visit to Aiustrilia in 1962 of Their Majesties the<br />
King and Queen of Thailand. Wehave Palso been gre,-t+. y honoured tha~ t His<br />
Royal Hi; hness The Crown Prince is furthering his education in ! Lustralia.<br />
Australions and Thais have for twenty years been co-operating in the<br />
development of Thailand. I number of joint projects are being undertaken<br />
in different areas of the country through the Australian aid program.<br />
Consultations have recently taken place between officials of our two<br />
governmnents on another important and innovative project. Through the<br />
efforts of HRH the Princess Mother, voluntary medical units have been set<br />
up in many provinces to improve health services for people in outlying<br />
areas. However, due to difficulties of communication, medical treatment<br />
is not readily available to large numbers of people in reilote areas a<br />
similar situation to that in A~ ustralia which led to the creation of the<br />
Royal Flying Doctor service. I am happy to announce that, in response to<br />
a request from the Government of Thailand, the Australian Government will<br />
support the Princess Mother's pioneering medical volunteers project by<br />
providing ambulances and radio transceivers. ' he hope that a pilot project<br />
to determine the exact requirements of the communications network will<br />
proceed in the near future. As a further example of co-operation<br />
Prime Minister Sanya and I # wv* 1i deoided in principle on a cultural<br />
agreement between our two countries.<br />
Quite recently the Australian Government held discussions with ASEANI<br />
representatives in Bangkok on possible Australian assistance to ASEAN<br />
projects. Right now my colleague, the Minister for Education, is in<br />
Bangkok for the Conference of South-East Asian Ministers of Education<br />
Organisation at which we were represented for the first time we an<br />
associate member. We recently participated for the first time in the<br />
Ministerial Conference for the Economic Development of South East Asia.<br />
We are co-operating with the Mekong Scheme with its headquarters in Bangkok,<br />
which has such great potential as an instrument for the reconstruction of<br />
Indochina. In the wider region, we share common membership of ECAFE with<br />
its headquarters also in Bangkok. Later on I shall be making reference to<br />
SEATO, but I mention these other matters now to show how far we have moved<br />
from a restricted and restricting concept of our relations as being only,<br />
or even mainly, preoccupied with defence and security. Both our countries<br />
have a well-rounded relationship with each other. Both are anxious to see<br />
that it ripens and matures.<br />
To illustrate this, let me say something of our trade and conomio<br />
relationships. There are long established and valued economic links<br />
between t'ustralia and Thailand. Our total trade of some dollars A43 million<br />
last year is not as largesas we would wish, but it has shown a rapid rise in<br />
recent years. For our part, we are confident that s uch growth will<br />
continue. We recognise, moreover, that trade must be viewed as a two-way<br />
flow. We have taken a number of initiatives to ensure that countries such<br />
as Thailand will have considerably greater opportunities, and greater<br />
encouragement, to sell to the Australian market. Last year we reduced all<br />
Australian tariffs by 25 per cent. In addition, from the beginning of this<br />
year, wme have introduced for the benefit of developing countries a scheme<br />
whereby those countries will receive additional preferences in the Australian<br />
tariff. We will continue to increase both the scope of the scheme and the<br />
margins of preference we accord until we are satisfied that the developing<br />
countries have achieved a competitive position in the Australian market.<br />
For this purpose my Government is establishing a facility within the<br />
Australian Department of Overseas Trade to provide market research and to<br />
handle trade inquiries for countries such as Thailand. I invite the<br />
Government of Thailand to make use of it. Let me remind you also that we<br />
recognise the importance you attach to receiving fair and reasonable prices in<br />
international markets for your primary products. Uur support in international<br />
forums for the basic justice of such an approach is well kniown and will<br />
continue. </p>
<p>3<br />
Next a word about overseas investment. -Australia recognises that<br />
in the right circumstances Australianlri) tG investment overseas can make a<br />
positive contribution to the industrial development of the host country.<br />
Although Australia in the past has not been a significant generator of<br />
capital for investment in overseas countries. We expect more activity<br />
in this area in the future. We believe, however, that every country<br />
should have the right to regulate foreign investment in accordance with<br />
its own national aspirations and social and economic objectives. It is<br />
a right we exercise ourselves in relation to foreign investment in<br />
Australia. For that reason we have recently announced that we will seek<br />
to encourage Australian private investment overseas only where-it is fully<br />
welcomed by the host country, where it will be favourable to the country<br />
in which it is made, and where it will be consistent with advanced labour<br />
relations and local environmental policies.<br />
I have aid that Australia and Theiland have a well-rounded<br />
relationship which we want to see ripen and mature. We are bringing this<br />
approach to all our other relationships in the region. It is by<br />
understanding this basic approach thot one can best understand the changes<br />
we have made. I can illustrate it by reference to some of the more<br />
notable of our policies.<br />
I mention the United States. We have an important defence treaty<br />
with U. S. and New Zealand but the American alliance should never have been<br />
regarded as the be-all and end-all of Australia's defence ard foreign<br />
policies and it should never have been viewed solely or principally as a<br />
defence association. Yet there developed in Australia over a generation<br />
a tendency to view all matters beyond our shores through the single narrow<br />
focus of China. What we are now trying to do is widen the range of our<br />
vision not to downgrade the importance of our friendship with the U. S.<br />
but to upgrade the importance of other relationships, above all in Lsia.<br />
We believe we are thereby creating a more mature partnership. And we<br />
believe that frankness is the best basis for friendship. We expect<br />
franknesss We intend to be frank.<br />
I should also refer to our relations with Japan. We are widening<br />
them beyond economics alone, important to both countries as that aspect is.<br />
Japan is Australia's bigest customers We are. Japan's second biggest<br />
customer after the United States. Obviously therefore, Australia's<br />
prosperity is closely linked with Japan's. We recognise Japan's need<br />
for secure access at fair prices to the raw materials her industries need,<br />
and so much of which Australia can provide. At the same time, the<br />
Australian people want a fair say and a fair share in the control and use<br />
of our own resources, just as the Thai people recognise that investment<br />
and trade relations between States not merely the States of our own<br />
region henceforth take account of the welfare and aspirations of the<br />
peoples of those States and cannot be based solely on business criteria.<br />
alone. I come now to China. Australia's new relations with China are<br />
based on the rejection of the relevance today of the DWlles concept of<br />
military containment of China. The war of intervention in Vietnam was<br />
created by that doctrine skid destroyed that doctrine. SEATO itself was<br />
originally the treaty expression of the doctrine. Clearly our view of<br />
the con~ cept which gave birth to SEATO influences our view of SEATO's present<br />
role. When we addressed ourselves to this matter on assuming office 14<br />
months ago it was urged upon us that withdrawal by Australia would damage<br />
confidence in the area. ' With an understanding of the position of Thailand<br />
particularly in mind, and the importance Thailand attaches to the Manila<br />
Treaty, we therefore agreed to work within the organisation for modification<br />
of its operation and orientation: Underpin confidence, Yes., underwrite<br />
containment, no. And with the co-operation and agreement of all members,<br />
this is what we have done. </p>
<p>Finally I mention our attitude towards regional arrangements and<br />
associations. Of all those in this region, AS= AN is unquestionably the<br />
most important, the most releva~ nt, the Most natural. &amp; ustralia does not<br />
seek to be a member of ASEON, though we have close bi-lateral and regional<br />
relationships with all its members. My present tour takes me to four<br />
ASEhN capitals. . with each member country and with Indonesia, our nearest<br />
neighbour, we are developing ever-increasing co-operation at all levels,<br />
including defence co-operation. Australia is playing a co-operative<br />
role in the other regional associations I mentioned earlier. We are<br />
strengthening all our bi-lateral~ relations in the region and are seeking<br />
new forms of regional co-operation. Increasingly I believe the nations<br />
of the Asian and Pacific region will in the future come to see the need for<br />
a 7wider forum than presently exists where all who have a commnon interest and<br />
a oommon destiny in the region can meet regularly, quietly and constructively.<br />
On this matter I just say two things heret Nobody, least of all me, believes<br />
that any new arrangements will come into being overnight.., And secondly,<br />
nobody, certainly not me, believe that any such arrangements should or<br />
could supplant or absorb ASEAN.<br />
I recognise too that the continuing conflict in Indochina our hopes<br />
of a year ago being still unfulfilled represents a major obstruction to<br />
any plens for new arrangements in our region. But ' the need remains, and<br />
I believe that perception of that need will grow and sharpen.<br />
It should be plain therefore that the direction of our decisions and<br />
hopes are outword-looking, regional and truly international. It is<br />
absurd to suggest that Australia is going isolationist when the whole thrust<br />
of our policies is towards greater international co-operation than ever<br />
before, towards deeper interests in a great number some of them nations<br />
which have hitherto scarcely made a scratch upon the Australian consciousness.<br />
New interests do not mean a loss or lessening of old interests. They mean<br />
rather a widening of Australian awareness, a realisation by Australians of<br />
their capacities, their responsibilities and their opportunities.<br />
Australia has not grown weary of international involvement, whatever our<br />
disillusionment as a result of Vietnam.<br />
That experience, the Vietnam experience when Australian youth<br />
decided no longer to to'. erate the intolerable, just as the youth of<br />
Thailand, in a very different context, did so decisively last October<br />
still deeply influences our judgments upon the affairs of this region and<br />
the responses we believe we should make to events in this region. What<br />
a strange government we would be if our attitudes, declared throughout a<br />
decade when we were powerless to act, were discarded the moment we had the<br />
power to translate those attitudes into action. That would have been true<br />
unpredictability, true irresponsibility.<br />
Decidely Australia has not grown weary of being involved: Vie have<br />
simply come of age. We draw a distinction between constructive involvement<br />
and counter-productive intervention. I hope that what myr Government has<br />
been able to show is an Australian capacity for self-renewal, just as this<br />
ancient Kingdom. is demonstrating its capacity for renewal and resilience,<br />
for change in a world of change, without rejecting its traditions but rather<br />
involving the very essence of its national tradition as the instrument of<br />
ordered change itself.<br />
