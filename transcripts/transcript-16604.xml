    <content><![CDATA[<p>Chris O'Brien was a man of leadership, vision and courage.</p>
<p>He inspired people, both through his work as a cancer specialist and through his own three-year battle with an aggressive, highly malignant brain tumour.</p>
<p>Chris transformed his personal adversity into a national opportunity, using his experience to fight so much harder for cancer patients and their families.</p>
<p>Chris's vision was for an integrated cancer treatment centre so that patients would no longer have to navigate their way through all the different elements of dealing with their illness alone.</p>
<p>His experience with cancer gave him the moral authority to advocate this model of integrated cancer care to the highest offices in the land, and he succeeded.</p>
<p>Just seven weeks ago, Chris and I were in Sydney together to launch the new Sydney Cancer Centre  -  Lifehouse at RPA.</p>
<p>Chris would not let us name this new centre after him. But it will be an enduring legacy to a great man, and a dearly missed friend.</p>
<p>On behalf of all Australians, I offer my condolences to Chris's wife Gail and their children Adam, Juliette and James.</p>
<p>The Australian Government has offered the O'Brien family a state funeral in honour of Chris O'Brien's contribution to the nation. The O'Brien family advised me this morning that they would be pleased to accept this offer.</p>
<p>It is only in exceptional circumstances that Governments offer state funerals.</p>
<p>I believe Chris O'Brien has been a truly exceptional Australian</p>
