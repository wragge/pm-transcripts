PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR PRESS 28 NOVEMBER 1976<br />
ELECTORATE TALK<br />
The Australian Government has made considerable and genuine<br />
efforts-. to keep the natioh's shipbuilding industry alive.<br />
For many months, we have shown consistently our concern for<br />
the future of shipbuilding and in particular, our concern<br />
for the'New South Wales owned dockyard at Newcastle.<br />
I and many of my senior Ministers have met delegations of<br />
shipworkers; we've had many formal and informal discussions<br />
Swith Mr. Wran and the trade uni-on leadership; officials from<br />
the Commcnwealth have. spent hours in discussions with their<br />
State counterparts.<br />
The Government has acted in good faith. We have wanted the<br />
shipbuilding industry to continue. We know full well of. our<br />
obligation to the men employed and their families.<br />
But we also have an obligation to every Australian taxpayer<br />
and all other Australian workers. We have to act in their<br />
best interests, too.<br />
The Government has made it clear to the shipbuilding industry and<br />
the New South Wales Government that shipbuilding costs are far<br />
too high. The taxpayers would be subsidising workers at Newcastle<br />
dockyard to build two A. N. L. ships at more than $ 20,000 per man.<br />
Clearly then, the Government had to make a decision about the<br />
future of the dockyard.<br />
Last week, the Government presented Mr Wran with a number of<br />
proposals designed to keep the industry going and to save the<br />
Newcastle dockyard.<br />
In essence, the Government was simply asking the dockyard<br />
workers not to strike, to improve productivity and to agree to<br />
forego wage rises above indexation. ./ 2 </p>
<p>In return the Government offered to support the dockyard<br />
with more thana $ 29 million subsidy to build the two<br />
A. N. L. ships all money from the Australian taxpayer.<br />
Even before the workers involved were given an opportunity<br />
to consider the offer, Mr Wran was making it clear the<br />
offer was totally unacceptable.<br />
He pre-empted the decision and possibly the wishes of the<br />
workers themselves the men he claims to have concern for.<br />
His main concern is to avoid his own financial responsibility.<br />
The Government believes our proposals fo~ r the dockyard are fair.<br />
Under no-circumstances could we agree to an,' open-ended programme<br />
of financial support. We had to be sure that -the taxpayers' money<br />
was not being wasted. We had to be sure that the dock-yard workers'<br />
really wanted to save their jobs.<br />
I believe that the Australian taxpayers and the Australian0<br />
workers have a right to know that the dockyard workers were<br />
willing to pull their weight.<br />
Throughout the months of negotiations over Newcastle the Government<br />
has been concerned about industrial unrest at the yard,<br />
The figures show a singular lack of genuine effort to slow down the<br />
rate of industrial disruption. More than 168,000 man hours have<br />
been lost at the Newcastle dockyard in the 12 months to<br />
October this year, and yet, the union had claimed that industrial<br />
trouble had stopped in the year.<br />
The Government was not prepared to tolerate this situation with so<br />
much taxpayers' money at stake in keeping the yard operating.<br />
It is for that reason that we put up our proposals, that some say<br />
are too harsh. We believe we owe the Australian taxpayer<br />
nothing less.<br />
Our proposals are not harsh they ar e just and reasonable. 0<br />
While the idea of an industrial relations contract between unions<br />
and management is novel in Australia, it is common overseas.<br />
The Government is not asking for too much.<br />
We are simply asking for the unions to use proper dispute<br />
procedures so there will be not strikes. We are asking for<br />
the unions to give up strikes while the ships are being built.<br />
We are also saying there should be no increases in wages above<br />
adjustmen-ts awarded by the Arbitration Commission or by the<br />
appropriate wage tribunals.<br />
In return, the Government is providing substantial support to<br />
keep the industry alive. The indemnity clause in the contract is<br />
entirely in the unions' own hands. Indemnity will simply pay for<br />
strikes that ought not to be happening because the unions<br />
are contracted not to strike. 3 </p>
<p>The Government hasbeen patient on this matter. We have<br />
listened to argument and considered options.<br />
We have been particuarly concerned about jobs in the<br />
industry. We have made strong efforts to protect those jobs.<br />
But the Government will not accept the wider consequences<br />
of allowing wildcat of political strikes and demarcation<br />
disputes. We cannot accept the consequences of open-ended<br />
financial support.<br />
Our proposals to keep the New South Wales owned Newcastle<br />
dockyard going w and to save the jobs of the men involved<br />
are firm and final.<br />
If jobs are not to be lost and an industry not thrown on<br />
the scrap-heap, our offer must be accepted. I don't believe<br />
Australians think there is any other way.<br />
