PRIME MINISTER'S ADDRESS ON THE OCCASION OF THE<br />
OPENING OF THE CHINESE EXHIBITION, MELBOURNE, 18.1.77<br />
The Exhibition, which is to be opened today is of exceptional<br />
significance, both artistically, and in the development: of<br />
relations between Australia and the People's Republic of China.<br />
This is by far the most significant exhibition ever to<br />
come to Australia.<br />
It is the third major archeological exhibition to be si-. own<br />
overseas by the Chinese Government.<br />
It is the first comprehensive exhibition to be mounted solely<br />
for one country, and includes selected pieces from exhibitions<br />
sent previously to Europe, North-America and Japan, together<br />
with some important items which have not previously been out<br />
of China.<br />
The generosity of the Chinese Government in making it possible<br />
for Australians to see the exhibition has been great. our<br />
appreciation of this generosity is increased by the fact that<br />
preparations for the exhibition went ahead despite the tragic<br />
earthquake China suffered during them.<br />
It is notable that it is the present Government of China which<br />
has done so much to explore and unearth China's past.<br />
The extraordinary quality of the exhibits all of which have<br />
been unearthed since 1949 demonstrate the commitment of the<br />
Chinese people and Government to preserve their cultural<br />
heritage, and the recognition of the continuity of China's history.<br />
It is a tribute to the skills and care with which Chinese<br />
archeologists, historians, and technicians have scientifically<br />
excavated historically significant sites and reconstructed their<br />
past. This exhibition is remarkable for the period of time it covers.<br />
It ranges over 600,000 years from the fossilised skull of<br />
Lantian Man to works of the 14th century Yuan Dynasty. </p>
<p>2-<br />
The richness and diversity of styles and materials of the 233<br />
pieces in the collection make it a major event for the scholar,<br />
the artist and the laymnan. These cultural relics are not only<br />
of great archeological interest, but often of incomparable beauty.<br />
Archeologically, the earliest pieces tell us something about<br />
our early predecessors, their hunting and domestic implements,<br />
their use of fire. Later pieces reveal the existence of writ-ten<br />
language in China before the 14th century BC, show us something<br />
of early technology and the development of Chinese society over<br />
many centuries. They fill significant gaps in our knowledge of<br />
China and will be particularly important for specialists in<br />
Chinese history, art and archeology who have hitherto been<br />
unable to see them.<br />
Artistically, the exh~ ibition is a superb display of man's<br />
responsiveness to colour, style and order in the artifacts<br />
with -which he surrounds himself. The pottery, bronzes, porcelains<br />
jade and other pieces show remarkable skill and dedication to<br />
artistry from very early times. These treasures, products of a<br />
civilisation noted for its many splendid achievements reflect not<br />
only aspects of the life of the nobility in China in earlier times,<br />
but also the outstanding facility of ordinary craftsmen a~ nd<br />
artisans in working in bronze, clay, gold, and other materials.<br />
The exhibitions the Chinese Peoples Republic has sent across the<br />
world are part of the wider range of contacts which are now<br />
developing between China and the international community. These<br />
relations had been arrested for too long, and it is of great<br />
importance that there be increased communication, consultation<br />
and understanding between the international community and China.<br />
one of the reasons for the difficulty of communication may have<br />
been external powers attitudes towards China, and their treatment<br />
of the things the Chinese people valued, including China's art<br />
treasures in the 19th century and early 20th century.<br />
When I was in Peking, I saw some of the work of the allied soldiers<br />
who broke into the forbidden city in 1900. The bayonet marks they<br />
had left on large water urns in their attempts to scrape off the<br />
gold with which the urns had been plated. These days are fortunately<br />
gone, and contact and communication between China and other<br />
countries is increasing. The fact that contacts have been limited<br />
in the past make it even more important that we work to develop<br />
them now, and in the future.<br />
If relationships between countries are to endure and develop, they<br />
must be based on a foundation of mutual understanding and respect.<br />
Cultural exchange programmes are an especially important rieans for<br />
laying that foundation. We also look forward to increased contact<br />
between our two nations at all levels, so that there can develop a<br />
greater understanding between our two Governments And our two peoples.<br />
/ The last </p>
<p>-3-<br />
The last major exhibition seen in Australia was the Modern<br />
Master's Exhibition from New York. The even more significant<br />
Chinese Archeological Exhibition marks a further stage of<br />
contact between Australians and the art of other societies<br />
of bringing overseas art exhibitions directly to hundreds of<br />
thousands of Australians. This development has been made<br />
possible by the co-operation between Governments and Feople.<br />
I am delighted to welcome here today the members of the<br />
official Chinese Delegation, and leading Chinese Journalists,<br />
who have been able to visit our country.<br />
I am sure that we would all like to acknowledge the ccntribution<br />
which many Chinese experts, and particularly the working party<br />
who travelled with the collection to this country, have made<br />
to the exhibition's success. We should also pay tribute to<br />
the work of Australia Council officers, the Directors of the<br />
Australian Art Exhibition Corporation which was established<br />
by the Government through the Australia Council, to organise<br />
the exhibition on the Australian side, the professional staffs<br />
of the National Gallery of Victoria, the Art Gallery of New<br />
South Wales, and to the work done by our Embassy in Peking.<br />
Finally, Mobil has played a significant part by undertaking<br />
to sponsor the exhibition and underwrite its costs.<br />
This is a Particularly important indication of the development<br />
of substantial co-operation between the private sector and<br />
the various spheres of Government in support for the arts.<br />
It is through a diversity and plurality of support for the<br />
arts that they can be strengthened in the interests of all.<br />
This objective is basic to the Government's Policy towards<br />
the arts.<br />
The exhibition contributes admirably to the fulfilment of key<br />
objectives in our policy of support for the arts, the promotion<br />
of excellence, the fostering of wide access, enjoyment and<br />
appreciation of the arts, and their development as a medium<br />
of international understanding.<br />
I have the greatest pleasure in opening the Chinese Exhibition. </p>
