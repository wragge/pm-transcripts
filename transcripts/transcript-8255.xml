FOR MEDIA 20 FEBRUARY 1991<br />
APPOINTMEN4T OF MINISTER ASSISTING THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR ABORIGINAL RECONCILIATION<br />
When the Government announced its in-principle support for a<br />
framework for advancing a process of reconciliation between<br />
Aborigines anti Torres Strait Islanders and the wider<br />
community, it was also indicated that the proposed Council<br />
for Aboriginal. Reconciliation would be supported by a<br />
secretariat located in my Department.<br />
An Aboriginal Reconciliation Unit has recently been<br />
established in my Department to service the Council and to<br />
carry forward the reconciliation process.<br />
As a further development, I have today appointed the<br />
Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, the Hon Robert Tickner MP,<br />
as Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Aboriginal<br />
Reconciliation. Mr Tickner will assist me with both the policy and<br />
operational issues involving the proposed Council and the<br />
reconciliation process. The Minister will also be<br />
responsible fo'r administrative matters involving the<br />
Aboriginal Reconciliation Unit. </p>
