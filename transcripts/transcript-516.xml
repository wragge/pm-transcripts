MELBOURNE HIGH SCHOOL OLD BOYS' ASSOCIATION DINNER<br />
IN HONOUR OF RETIRING HEADMASTER, I. M. WOODFULL<br />
HELD IN MELBOURNE ON 21ST MAY -1962<br />
Speech by the Prime Minister, the Rt. Hon, R. G. Menzies<br />
Mr. Chairman, My Lord Bishop and gentlemen: ( Or perhaps I should<br />
have said Lindsay Hassett and gentlemen) ( Laughter)<br />
Look, if I don't speak up half your lucki ( Laughter)<br />
Sir, with very great respect to you I don't think I<br />
very much approve of being described in this honorific fashion<br />
as a " Guest Speaker" because, really, this is not my night.<br />
This is Bill Woodfull's night, Heaven be praised. ( Applause).<br />
I don't mind telling you that the only reason I had an invitation<br />
to come here to propose Bill's health was that they thought it<br />
was very desirable that I should do it while I was Prime Minister.<br />
( Laughter, applause). So, although I am setting out into what<br />
you * ght call foreign parts in about three days' time, I said<br />
" I must be there".<br />
But my real job tonight is to say something about<br />
Woodfull and if I stray a little, and to references to anybody<br />
else, you will understand that these are mere decorations on the<br />
true motive of my speech, which is William Maldon Woodfullo<br />
Now you see at once I strike a note in your minds: Why<br />
is he christened William Maldon Woodfull? The answer is quite<br />
simple-Because he was born in Maldon, ( Laughter) And when I<br />
was coming here tonight I thought how lucky that my parents<br />
didn't christen me " Robert Jeparit Menzies'K. ( Laughter, applause)<br />
Now your very distinguished guest tonight, William Maldon<br />
Woodfull, has been a very versatile person. I am sure that quite<br />
a lot of people seeing him only on the cricket ground, and then,<br />
as a rule, for inordinate periods of time, little thought that<br />
he was a teacher of mathematics, the most depressing occupation<br />
I would have thought ( Laughter) that beset any man. And he<br />
taught mathematics, either so well or so badly, one never knows<br />
about these things, that they decided to make him a Headmaster,<br />
( Laughter) And for a time he coruscated in my electorate.<br />
I'm not going to embarrass him by suggesting that he voted for<br />
me, or any of those rather eccentric things ( Laughter) but he<br />
was there. Then he succeeded., in this vury famous School, two<br />
very famous Hoadmastors, Ramsay, Langley, Woodfull This is a<br />
wonderful trio to contemplate isn't it? ( Applausel And it is<br />
worth contemplating them, because, though we never feel like<br />
admitting it when we are at school, headmasters are tremendously<br />
important. I'm surprised and perhaps some of you who are as<br />
venerable as I am and who have got the years of wisdom may agree<br />
I'm always astonished to find how a Headmaster I didn't like<br />
very much became a legendary figure years after. ( Laughter)<br />
You find yourself in the company of old boys and you look back<br />
years, 40 years, or whatever it may be and you say, " By Jove<br />
the old man was wonderful wasn't he?" At the time you didn't<br />
say that. ( Laughter) B'It the truth is, of course, that a great<br />
Headmaster will do more to make a great school that any other<br />
single factor, He will do more than bricks or mortar, or a<br />
benevolent department, or a kind and charitable Government.<br />
( Laughter) When I looked around tonight and I saw the relatively<br />
high percentage of dinner jackets I thought that this talk about<br />
depression might have been over-estimated. ( Laughter) But<br />
anyhow I hope you will agree with rae on this I'm sure you will<br />
that a notable Headmaster helps to make, and indeed in some ways<br />
makes, a notable school.. And in the case of this school you </p>
<p>have had a remarkable succession of people of mnsequence, of<br />
substance, of personal authority and of personal example. And<br />
they have all helped to make you come along and sing that inspiring<br />
song which you sang a little earlier, and feel proud of the school<br />
through which you passed. Therefore, here's William Maldon<br />
Woodfull, a Headmaster, and, I venture to say, a great Headmaster.<br />
If I make a glancing reference to his immediate predecessor,<br />
George Langley, I hope you will understand me because this<br />
man, Langley, between you and me I wouldntt wish it to go any<br />
further ( Laughter) served me a very ill turn once. He was<br />
nominally in charge of a school at Jarrnambool ( Laughter) and he<br />
had enough spare time to take a little interest in politics,<br />
fortunately, as I thought at the time, on my side. I went down<br />
to Warrnambool to make a speech it was in a State Election:<br />
this was when I occupied a really dignified position and was a<br />
State politician ( Laughter) and there was a big meeting at the<br />
Warrnambool Town Hall. I was down there, allegedly, to support<br />
the candidature of the late J. G. Fairbairn, serum et venerabile<br />
nomen, and George Langley met me. He looked very busy. He<br />
sounded very busy. And he said to me " A wonderful meeting<br />
tonightl It will be packed and all the other side are going to<br />
be here and you'll have a lively meeting." Well I've never had<br />
any feeling of reluctance about a lively meeting ( Laughter) and so<br />
I said, " Thank you very much, George. This sounds most promising,"<br />
I went to the Warrnambool Town Hall. It was full,<br />
there's no doubt about that, and I spoke, there's no doubt about<br />
that ( Laughter) and there was an unbroken silence right through<br />
the Hall. I thought " This is no good√∏ What about this fellow<br />
Langley who promised me a bit of life in this meeting?" So I<br />
then resorted to all I hope you won't use this against me<br />
all the tricks of the trade to stir them up. I thought I must<br />
get some hostility in this meeting. No. It was just like going<br />
out and making a speech on a Thursday afternoon in the Kew Cemetery.<br />
( Laughter). Well, of course, they had decided that that didn't<br />
pay off, so they were silent. But I think that it set George<br />
Langley back, in my mind, for a long time. But I recovered-as<br />
I have now recovered long enough to realise that George Langley<br />
is one of the great enthusiasts in education in Australia and<br />
Victoria, and a great master of your own school. ( Applause).<br />
p Now they tell me that Bi. 7L Woodfull is retiring by<br />
effluxion of time the retiring age in August. You know there<br />
is no retiring age to Prime Ministers. ( Laughter) In August<br />
I will have been, man and boy at one time or another, Prime<br />
Minister of Australia for fifteen years ( Applause) and this old<br />
friend of mine will retire and sit under his own vine and fig tree<br />
while I'm still being chased up and down the entire country. It<br />
isn't right. ( Laughter) I wish some of you chaps who write those<br />
silly letters to the newspapers would start a campaign for the<br />
compulsory retirement of Prime Ministers at the age of ( Laughter)<br />
with a provision for retrospective double pay ( Laughter) if<br />
their retirement has to be dated back from 67 to 65 ( Laughter).<br />
But Bill all this is good fun and games. I just want<br />
to say to you an Im saying it not only for myself but for<br />
everybody here tonight and, indeed, for hundreds of thousands of<br />
people in Australia that you are being honoured at this dinner<br />
tonight because of your character, clear marvellous character so<br />
well known to everybody whoever has anything to do with you, your<br />
immense skill your great wisdom and, above all, your warm, simple<br />
humanity. ( Applause) * o 0. / 3 </p>
<p>Now, gentlemen, if I had as much sense as I had fifteen<br />
years ago,, I would pause and stop at that point because that<br />
is really what I wanted to say about Bill Woodfull. But my<br />
attention was drawn to the fact that a certain number of his<br />
contemporaries in the cricketing world have been dredged up<br />
( Laughter) and placed here tonight Fieetwood-Smith has been<br />
smoking the biggest bent-stem pipe I've ever seen in my life;,<br />
Vic,, Richardson smoking one of my cigars. ( Laughter) Therefore,<br />
perhaps, I ought just to say a word about that aspect of your<br />
life. This is a little mixed up with politics. You young<br />
fellows don't realise how far old fellows like myself go back<br />
in the political scene. I can remember a time when, in the<br />
Victorian Parliament, I was asked w~ iether I would go up and make<br />
a powerful speech somewhere in the Goulburn Valley, And that<br />
was at a time when there was a Test Mlatch on. (" Laughter) Oh,<br />
not here, otherwise I wouldn't have been in the Goulburn Valley,<br />
but in England somewhere. And my host on this occasion was a<br />
keen cricket lover. We went down to the local hall, we had<br />
all the local citizenry there, and in a little anteroom my friend,<br />
the chairman who was a solicitor, had installed his clerk to<br />
listen in to the broadcast and to send in progress reports.<br />
Well, before we got a chanco of having one progress report, I<br />
had only uttered the first four or five sentences when the<br />
local firebell went. You know what happens in a little country<br />
town when the fire bell rings:. everybody leaves at once hoping<br />
that it's the neighbour's house that is being burnt down.<br />
( Laughter) And the hall completely emptied. They just disappeared,<br />
And I said to the Chairman " Do you think they will come back?"<br />
And he said, " Oh yes, they'll come back; I've arranged to have<br />
the cricket scores." ( Laughter) So they camne back. Well we<br />
got going. At the end of about a quarter of an hour, I was just<br />
warming up to point one you know, this powerful unanswarable<br />
argument, this was it, 1his was to demolish the 6pposition.<br />
( Ilve forgotten whether there was one ( Laughter) ( Applause)<br />
Anyhow this was going to demolish the opposition. When in<br />
ca~ me my chairman who ha-: d "' nicked out", as we say, held up a<br />
hand like a traffic cop signal, you know, and said " Excuse<br />
me," 1 I was half way through a sentence. This happened four<br />
times% I almost applied for a job as a member of the Indeterminate<br />
Sentences Board. ( Laughter) ( Applause) " Excuse me,"<br />
he said, " laa~ ies and gentlemen-, Australia won the toss,<br />
Australia batting, Woodfull 15 not out, Ponsford, naturally,<br />
not out". ( Laughter) W4ell this cheered me up immensely,<br />
because of course I knew that Bill must have had a couple of'<br />
" no balls" delivered to him,, ( Laughter) Then we went on for<br />
another fifteen minutes, and there was another interruption,<br />
right in the middle of a sentence, and this time it was " Ponsford<br />
27 not out, Woodfull 25 not out". This was a bit awkward.<br />
Anyhow when we got along to a stage when this Bill was leading<br />
that Bill by 1 the strain was too greats we declared the meeting<br />
closed somebody carried a unanimous voie of' confidence in me<br />
( Laughler) and we went back to my host's house,<br />
In those days, you had to catch a very early train from<br />
this place to get back to Melbourne and I said to this wretched<br />
fellow, " Have you any teetotal drink that I might apply myself'<br />
to?" ( Laughter) And with some difficulty he said " No" ( Laughter)<br />
( Applause) So then I said " Well I must break my principles"<br />
( Laughter) and he said " Yes". And we sat there for the rest<br />
of' the night loosening the laces in our shoes and we heard the<br />
whole thing through. I don't think, as a matter of fact, either<br />
of them got out that night. I was only surprised next morning to<br />
have sombody say to me " Extraordinary thing, you know, in<br />
England, they play cricket in the dark",, ( Laughter) Anyhow<br />
most of that story is quite true. ( Laughter) </p>
<p>I wouldn't like to say too much about some of these<br />
other characters who are here tonight, I wouldn't. Oh, yes,<br />
I must say, yes. Would you forgive me? I am delighted to<br />
find tonight my old friend Mr. Ironmonger, for some obscure<br />
reason called " Dainty". o you know that when Larwood was<br />
bowling at his fiercest on the Melbourne Cricket Ground, Ironmonger,<br />
alrays under-rated as a batsman.. delivered a clout at<br />
one ball which went to the boundary so fast that the eye could<br />
hardly follow it. And it was only about eight years ago that<br />
I looked over the Committee Box at the Melbourne Ground where<br />
I go occasionally by courtesy of Ian Johnson ( Laughter) and down<br />
below I saw Dainty Ironmonger I won't say in conversation with<br />
Jack Ellis listening to Jack Ellis ( Laughter) so I went down<br />
at once. I thought " This is a splendid gathering. I must<br />
be in this". And I said to Bert Ironmonger " Ive always wanted<br />
to ask you: you remember that superb four that you hit off<br />
Larwood?" He said " I'll never forget it, neve? forget it".<br />
" Tell me am I right in thinking that your eyes were shut at the<br />
moment of impact?" ( Laughter) To which he made the classical<br />
Australian reply " Too right". ( Applause) It is a wonderful<br />
thing to see him here tonight, Somebody told me how old he was<br />
and I don't believe it, All I know is that he was a great<br />
cricketer' and the greatest bowler never to have a visit to<br />
Great Britain. ( Applause)<br />
Oh, I mustn't take up too much time. But, oh yes,<br />
Hassett. Do you know about this fellow Hassett? I've been<br />
pretty friendly with this fellow Hassett. He has been a guest<br />
in my house in Canberra several times and by and large he has<br />
behaved very well ( Laughter) His hours have not always been<br />
of the most appropriate, but they have always been regular.<br />
( Laughter) The other day he went up, keeping an eye on the<br />
business, I suppose, to Canberra to the golf tournament and with<br />
my usual courtesy and generosity I spoke to him on the telephone<br />
in fact I think he rang me up ( Laughter) and I said, " Lindsay,<br />
come round and have a drink before lunch." You know we always<br />
keep a bit of Coca-Cola in the refrigerator. And he said<br />
you dontt mind Lindsay if I quote this, it desorves to be<br />
immortal he said ' Look Itm terribly sorry Sir' he always<br />
calls me OSirl in public ( Laughter) ' but 11m woman-bound'.<br />
I said? " Heaven help me, what does that mean?" ' Well'. he<br />
said, 1' Ive got six women with met, Some of them turned out<br />
to be children. So I said " Bring them all old boy" ( Laughter)<br />
You know it's a wonderful thing, if you get even a modest<br />
entertainment allowance, it's wonderful how generous you can<br />
be. ( Laughter) So I said " bring them round". And he brought<br />
themaround. There were eight of them if remember correctly.<br />
It was very good. All I know is we had lunch three quarters of<br />
an hour late that day. Ian Johnson7<br />
Look, I could go through all these people. I see them.<br />
Vic. Richardson, fielding at silly mid-on. Fabulousl These<br />
men have given me the most tremendous pleasure in the world;<br />
and they have given it to you too. ( Applause). The only<br />
remarkable thing is that if you happen to be a fanatic about<br />
cricket, as I am, you are occasionally a little put out by the<br />
non-cricketing onlooker, with a serious mind, These people<br />
oughtn't to be allowed to go to a cricket match. It ought<br />
to be confined to the Houses of Parliament. ( Laughter) I<br />
have a match each time there's a visiting team and Lindsay Hassett,<br />
on the last occasion, when the M. C. C. were here was, having<br />
received my hospitality and generosity, you know at the Lodge,<br />
and all that kind of thing, he was fielding a little ahead of<br />
square leg and fairly short and Colin Cowdrey was batting and<br />
Colin had made enough runs Laughter) that's a remarkable<br />
fact he had made enough runs and so he decided to go out so<br />
he cocked one up about ten yards past Lindsay and Lindsay felt<br />
S. </p>
<p>that this was carrying friendship * boo far so he lot it fall on<br />
to the ground and somebody else fielded it and then the next<br />
time Colin, not to be outdone in generosity, hit it very high<br />
and very short, Lindsay stepped across to the square leg umpire,<br />
took his white hat off, caught the ball. in his white hat over<br />
his shoulder, then appeared to tear the hat to pieces and throw<br />
it on -the ground and walked off. And cne of these humourists<br />
you encounter at a cricket match sitting next to me said, " But<br />
Mr,, Prime Minister, that's not out, that's against the rules of<br />
cricket." ( Laughter)<br />
Well, of course, you could get me going forever on<br />
this because I happen to be one of those fellows who have, believe<br />
it or not, a lot of very heavy, serious and responsible matters<br />
to attend to in my own life ana to me cricket, and the cricketers<br />
have been the great joy of life.<br />
And that brings me back to this great captain of<br />
Australia, ( Applause) Most people in the course of their<br />
lives manage to make some enemies, manage to have some knowledgeable<br />
critics, manage one way or another to be involved in what<br />
they are pleased to call I believe, " incidents". I venture<br />
to say there is no captain of Australia, no captain of Australia<br />
ever went out of the game leaving behind him a more untouched<br />
reputation a greater affection, a greater respect than Wtilliami<br />
Maldon Woos full. ( Applause)<br />
Sir, having bored everybody stiff, may I now have<br />
the privilege of proposing his toast. Bill Woodfull, Headmaster,<br />
scholar, cricketer and friend. </p>
