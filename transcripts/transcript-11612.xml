    <content><![CDATA[<p>All Australians will be saddened by the death today of Dame Roma Mitchell.</p>
<p>Dame Roma will be remembered for her pioneering role in the legal profession</p>
<p> and her long and distinguished service to the Australian Community, especially</p>
<p> in South Australia, and to the Winston Churchill Memorial Trust.</p>
<p>Admitted to the bar in 1934, Dame Roma became Australia's first</p>
<p> woman QC in 1962. She was made a judge of the Supreme Court of South Australia</p>
<p> in 1965, a post in which she served until 1983.</p>
<p>She was Governor of South Australia from 1991  1996 becoming the</p>
<p> first woman Governor in Australia when she took up the post.</p>
<p>Dame Roma also served as Chancellor of the University of Adelaide from</p>
<p> 1983  1990 and was a member of the Council for the Order of Australia</p>
<p> from 1981  1990. She also served as Chairman of the Commonwealth</p>
<p> Human Rights Commission from 1981  1986 and was awarded a DBE in</p>
<p> 1982 and an AC in 1991.</p>
<p>Dame Roma was recently made a Commander of the Royal Victorian Order</p>
<p> by The Queen.</p>
<p>I extend deepest sympathies on behalf of myself, my wife Janette and</p>
<p> the Federal Government to her loved ones.</p>
