    <content><![CDATA[<p>Fellow Australians, friends of Australia, Veterans of Australia </p>
<p>90 years ago today, the great guns fell silent.</p>
<p>After fours years of bloodshed, the battlefields were silent.</p>
<p>Great empires had been broken.</p>
<p>Millions, millions lay dead.</p>
<p>Among them, sixty thousand Australian heroes whose final resting place will forever be foreign soil.</p>
<p>And then there were the wounded  -  a further one hundred and fifty thousand whose bodies and minds were to be forever scarred by the horrors of war.</p>
<p>And all this from a country of some four millions.</p>
<p>The scale of the carnage; the new ways of killing on an almost industrial scale; the tiny pieces of land over which so much blood was spilt; the sheer, stark horror of life and death in the trenches  -  made all peoples hope that this could never happen again.</p>
<p>It was called the War to End All Wars.</p>
<p>But we now know that it was not.</p>
<p>It was the First World War.</p>
<p>The League of Nations did not prevent a Second.</p>
<p>Barely a generation had passed before the killing began again.</p>
<p>This time on a mass scale that saw civilians too as the target of war.</p>
<p>Once again the years of destruction made victors and vanquished alike commit afresh to peace.</p>
<p>Once again an international institution was established to maintain the peace  -  once again representing the hopes and aspirations of all humankind.</p>
<p>But war has continued and the innocent continue to die.</p>
<p>Causing us all to ask, is war our permanent condition?</p>
<p>Must every generation go through war to be reminded why there should be no war?</p>
<p>Or can we dare to do something different, can we dare to think something different.</p>
<p>Not just to be informed from history.</p>
<p>But to learn from history.</p>
<p>We have all endured a most bloody century.</p>
<p>But let us resolve afresh at the dawn of this new century, this century of the Pacific, that this might just be a truly (inaudible) peaceful century.</p>
<p>Let us resolve afresh to build the habits of cooperation rather than to yield to the inevitability of conflict.</p>
<p>Let all peoples of goodwill resolve afresh for peace, resolve afresh a century free from the threat of nuclear war.</p>
<p>So that our world community can work with one heart and one mind for the great challenges of our age.</p>
<p>Of course tyranny cannot and can never be wished away with a pen.</p>
<p>Tyrants must always be confronted when all other options are exhausted.</p>
<p>And that means that the price of peace remains eternal vigilance.</p>
<p>That is why we need our men and women in uniform.</p>
<p>That is why we are proud of our men and women in uniform.</p>
<p>That is why we are proud of the 100,000 names etched in the walls of this great memorial.</p>
<p>We as a nation have paid a great price.</p>
<p>Think of the war which ended 90 years ago today.</p>
<p>Gallipoli  -  26,000 casualties.</p>
<p>Fromelles  -  5,500 Australian casualties.</p>
<p>Pozieres  -  nearly 7000 Australia casualties.</p>
<p>Bullecourt  -  7500 Australian casualties.</p>
<p>Ypres  -  38,000 Australian casualties.</p>
<p>Today these numbers are mind-numbing, they are horrific in their magnitude.</p>
<p>90 years ago the Australian troops on the Western Front were at the forefront of the fighting.</p>
<p>The Australian Corps played a critical role in the actions that helped bring about the end of the war.</p>
<p>They brought some of Australia's greatest victories.</p>
<p>They saw some of the greatest acts of heroism.</p>
<p>In August, led by Monash, the Australians attacked from Villers-Bretonneux and Hamel, fighting side-by-side with our Americans allies for the first time.</p>
<p>They drove back the enemy lines.</p>
<p>Ludendorff described it as “the black day of the German army”.</p>
<p>In September, Australian diggers fought at Peronne and Mont St Quentin.</p>
<p>In October, Australian troops of the Second Division broke through the Hindenburg Line at La Motte Farm and Mushroom Quarry.</p>
<p>And again they drove the enemy back.</p>
<p>This was the last engagement of the Australian troops in the war.</p>
<p>These victories helped to set the path for the Armistice to be signed in November.</p>
<p>They are part of the proud tradition of the Australian military, each one of them heroes of Australia and we honour them.</p>
<p>And today too we honour our friends and our allies who have been with us in the thick of battle.</p>
<p>Behind every name on the walls of this great memorial is a story.</p>
<p>The story of someone in uniform, someone who gave their conflict, a very human story, a very personal story, a story of a family and families changed forever.</p>
<p>The story of communities changed forever.</p>
<p>For the loss of one of their sons.</p>
<p>This great memorial, looking down this great avenue of heroes, honours them all.</p>
<p>As we as a nation honour them today.</p>
<p>It honours what they have achieved in the name of Australia.</p>
<p>And through honouring them, we remember them.</p>
<p>In the words of Charles Bean, in this memorial “Here is their spirit, in the heart of the land they loved.”</p>
<p>It is right that we honour the service and sacrifice of the fallen today.</p>
<p>It is right that we honour all those who have served.</p>
<p>And it is right that we remember today those who are still serving.</p>
<p>For there is no higher calling in Australia than to wear the uniform of Australia.</p>
<p>What is the message of this 90th Armistice Day?</p>
<p>I believe each of the fallen would say to us this, be forever vigilant and be equally unstinting in the preservation of the peace.</p>
<p>Today we remember those who fell.</p>
<p>We honour the contribution they have made to this great nation Australia.</p>
<p>We honour the contribution they have made to the world.</p>
<p>And we commit ourselves to upholding the values for which these Australians, these hundred thousands and more Australians who gave their lives in the service of this nation.</p>
<p>And we commit ourselves afresh to the great cause of peace.</p>
<p>We honour them. </p>
