I, AUSTRALIA<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR PRESS 9 JUNE 1978<br />
AUSTRALIA/ EEC NE-OYrTIONS<br />
The Prime Minister of Australia, Mr Malcolm Fraser, said today<br />
that he had received a report from the ' Minister for Special Trae<br />
Representations', Mr R. V. Garland, on the outcome of trade tal.: s<br />
with Commissioners of the European Community held today and<br />
yesterday in Brussels.<br />
Mr Fraser said that the Community's response to Australia's<br />
proposals for improving the present imbalance of trading<br />
opportunities with the Community was neither reasonable nor<br />
acceptable. It did not represent a serious response to the<br />
central thrust of Australia's proposals to get even marginally<br />
better access for beef and other agricultural products, as well<br />
as some mitigation of the Community's massive export subsidisation<br />
of agricultural surpluses which is a ersely affecting Australia's<br />
export opportunities in third markets.<br />
Mr Fraser pointed out that Australia * as not seeking to balance<br />
its trade with the Community, which -was heavily in the Community's<br />
favour. Rather the objective was to reduce the imbalance of<br />
trading opportunities. The present trading relationship whereby -he<br />
Community has virtual across the board access to the Australian<br />
market for exports of industrial products and even some<br />
foodstuffs cannot be balanced with a situation where the<br />
Community's market is virtually closed to a wide range of Australian<br />
agricultural exports.<br />
Mr Fraser said that Australia, as a major world trader, regards<br />
an improvement in trade opportunities and in the balance of the<br />
trading relationship with the world's largest trading<br />
bloc as an essential basis upon whizh to sustain our<br />
future trade growth. Such an improwement is not only valid in the<br />
context of Australia/ European relations, but it is also valid f: r<br />
the European consumers who are forced to pay much higher than wcrld<br />
prices for their foodstuffs. In this regard the recent decision by<br />
President Carter to substantially inzrease the levels of beef<br />
imports into the United States is a cassic example of the way<br />
in which improved access for primary products to the markets<br />
of the developed countries can assist in the fight against inflation.<br />
I 2 </p>
<p>The Community's response on our major items of' concern,<br />
in particular beef, is that Australia should await results' in<br />
the MTN. Mr Fraser said that Australia accepted that many<br />
of our problems could only be resolved in the MTN and that<br />
the Australian Government attached tkhe highest priority to<br />
the achievement of a successful MTN package with a balanced<br />
outcome on both industrial and agricultural products.<br />
To this end, we had completely re-appraised our position and<br />
are now prepared to participate on the basis of a 40 percent<br />
formula cut on tariffs provided full reciprocity for our<br />
exports is achieved.<br />
Australia would hope that all major participants will<br />
similarly re-appraise their MTNP approach especially the<br />
Meanwhile Australia continues to see as essential the -need for<br />
serious and sustained bilateral negotiations with the<br />
Community to provide the neceSsary basis for the successful<br />
resolution of our problems on the MTN. Such a basis can-not<br />
exist unless the Community is prepared to respond in a<br />
meaningful way to our proposals.<br />
Mr Fraser said that the Community's response on beef,<br />
based as it is on the vague and ill-defined " joint disciplines"<br />
concept, does not offer real -: rospects of achieving reasonable<br />
or secure access to the Commnity market. Australia's beef<br />
proposals involve global accescs for about 4 percent of the<br />
Community's total consumption of 6.5 million tonnes.<br />
Mr Fraser pointed out that Australia had been in negotiations<br />
with the Community since June last year when he and President<br />
Jenkins agreed that wide ranging discussions should be held<br />
on the totality of Australia's trading and ecoftomic relations<br />
with the Community. Mr Howard, the Minister then responsible,<br />
conducted a round of discussions with Commissioners of' the<br />
EEC and Ministers in Member States. These d-iscussions allowed<br />
Australia's concerns to be fully explained and<br />
explored. Mr Howard had left with the Commission at the end<br />
of last October a Note settin; g out substantive and concrete<br />
proposals for improveme. nts.<br />
Only now, more than seven months after Australia's detailed<br />
written proposals were conveyed formally to the Community, has<br />
the Community been able to respond. Even now, its consideration<br />
of' our detailed proposals has been such that it has not even<br />
been able to give us a written response.<br />
Mr Fraser said that after all these detailed and lengthy<br />
discussions the Community's response was disappointing and<br />
completely inadequate. It does not in any way help to improve<br />
the present unsatisfactory state of trading relationships<br />
between Australia and the Comz'anity. Indeed, it raises serious<br />
doubts about the Community's -willingness to respond in any<br />
meaningful way to Australia's proposals. 13 </p>
<p>Mr Fraser said that Australil could not accept the<br />
continuation of the present situation. A more careful<br />
response is required if satisfactory solutions to our p ' roblems<br />
are to be reached. Wi-thout such solutions the Commrunit~ y<br />
will force Australia to re-examine the totality of<br />
Australia' s commercial and trading policies with the<br />
Community. There should be no mistake or misunderstanding<br />
about Australia's resolve in -this regard. Mr Fraser said<br />
that Mr Garland would be reporting in detail to him and<br />
his Cabinet colleagues in Canberra. He will convey the<br />
considered response of the Australian Government to the<br />
Commission next week. </p>
