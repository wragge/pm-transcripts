PRESS, RADIO A111 TV CONFERENCXE<br />
GIVEN BY THE PRIME MINISTER, IMR. JOHN GORTON<br />
AT PARLIAMENr HOUSE, CANBRA A. C. T. 18 JUNE 1970<br />
PR IME MINISTER I'll be quite short, gentlemen, I thin:' w e have<br />
recently concluded a Session which you will agree wao -full of<br />
incident and which, I suggest, was full of some accornF, 113hment.<br />
There have been significant statements on defence and on<br />
foreign affairs, charting our course for the future. We at for 38 days,<br />
which is a long Session, the longest Autumn Session, 1 think, in the<br />
last ten years, and we passed 61 bills. Up to lunch-timle, the Senate<br />
had passed 51, which is not quite a record, but, agair, close to it<br />
for the last ten years. A lot of them were comparatively small<br />
bills, but I think bills of some significance for a lot of people in<br />
Australia and some of them for Australia -itself bills<br />
dealing with capital assistance to handicapped children, dealing with<br />
paying higher pensions to married couples who are separated,<br />
setting up commissions of enquiry into dangers to the Barrier Reef<br />
and into the Crown of Thorns star fish, providing a loan to the<br />
Queensland Government for the development of central Queensland<br />
which could be an extremely significant development for Australia.<br />
And a whole variety of bills which I won't go into.<br />
But three significant proposals, two of which have now become<br />
law, two passed through the House during the time; one, the<br />
establishment of an Australian Industry Development Corporation and<br />
one, the Health Scheme which has taken some considerable debate<br />
before it finally reached its present stage. And on the n~ otice paper<br />
is still the bill for the territorial sea and the continental shelf. So<br />
there was quite a lot of incident, quite a lot of accomplishment and<br />
some significant things which I believe were done. I wifll now pass<br />
this conference over to you. You will no doubt have other matters on<br />
which you would like to ask questions but I hope there will be some<br />
on what I have considered to be significant actions.<br />
Q. lack Commins, ABC In the Senate just a while ago, the<br />
DL? did say that it would vote against the Receipts Duties Bills<br />
which would mean the defeat of the measures. Will the Government<br />
take it as far as a double dissolution?<br />
PM. Well it can't take it as far as a double dissolution unless<br />
it is defeated twice, can it? All this legislation does is to enable<br />
the Commonwealth Government, acting as an agent or, behalf of the<br />
States at the States' request, to collect a particular portion of a tax<br />
for them. We told the States we would try and do this . r: them. If<br />
the States' House won't help the State Governments who have indicated<br />
that they want this revenue, then that is a matter which affects the<br />
States more than it affects us. But the question of a dou.: ie dissolution<br />
doesn't arise until quite a period of time has passed and inatters are<br />
rejected twice, as far as I can remember. a o. / 2 </p>
<p>Q. David Solomon of the Australian On the same subject,<br />
Mr. Prime Minister, will you have an election for the House of<br />
Representatives because of the defeat soon to come of the Receipts<br />
Duties Bill and will you provide money for the States to recompense them<br />
the $ 50 million which they would have got under the bill, will you<br />
provide this in some other way?<br />
PM. The answer to the first question is of course wie won't have a<br />
House of Representatives election on a matter which is not our legislation.<br />
It 18 legislation we are acting as agents on behalf of the States for. As<br />
regards the other part of your question, we would have to discuss that<br />
with the States. In any case, there are always other op-ortunities, you<br />
know, for continuing endeavours in these fields In that ) articular field<br />
of legislation.<br />
Q. Frank Chamberlain, AEP, Macquarie btr. ' Prime Minister,<br />
on the question of States, you have a Premiers' Conference next week.<br />
Will this question which was raised in the Senate today be discussed<br />
with the Premiers?<br />
PM. Which question was this?<br />
Q. The receipts duty. Will you discuss that and also will the<br />
opportunity be taken to discuss again the offshore minerals problem?<br />
PM. We haven't had an agenda from the States on this. We have<br />
asked the States for proposals they would like to have on an agenda,<br />
but so far we haven't received them. I would doubt very much if<br />
the offshore minerals. 1 et me call it by its proper tit'le The<br />
Territorial Sea and Continental Shelf Bill would be the subject of<br />
discussion. If it was sought to be, it could be, and similarly with the<br />
whole field of financial assistance to the States which could well involve<br />
the attack on their taxation rights which the Labor Party seems to be<br />
making in the Senate. You see, no matter what arrangements are made<br />
in the future for Commonwealth grants r~ f finance to the States no<br />
matter what arrangements are made in the future if the States are<br />
denied the opportunity for us to act as their agen. ts to raise this<br />
particular tax, then no matter how much we give themnthey will always<br />
be denied the extra amount which they cotId have raised.<br />
Q. Wal Brown, Courier Mail When do you propoce to proceed<br />
with the territorial sea legislation in the face of the strong opposition<br />
from several States?<br />
PM. I would hope to proceed with it in the Budget Session.<br />
Q. Do you hope to confer with the States again before you go<br />
ahead with it? / 3 </p>
<p>PM. We would be quite happy to confer with the Statces again. What<br />
we would be conferring with the States about would be the heads of agreement<br />
and the arrangements for administration and royalties and all the rest of the<br />
matters which form a part, at the moment for example, of the petroleum<br />
agreement. Now, the petroleum agreement deals with such matters as<br />
administration, royalties, various fees, things of that k4-ind, granting of<br />
titles, but it specifically puts aside without resolution the claim of the<br />
States to have legal sovereignty, not only over the territorial sea but<br />
right out to the limits of the continental shelf, and the claim of the<br />
Commonwealth to have the same sovereignty. It puts that aside, it<br />
doesn't resolve it, and the resoltuion of that is necessary. But it is a<br />
completely different question from the working out of administrative<br />
arrangements and spreading of royalties and so on, which would need to<br />
be brought in to operation, no matter which way the decision in the High<br />
Court went on this matter. So does that answer your question?<br />
Q. Peter Martin, Seven National News Prime M-nister, does that<br />
mean that there will be rno discussion on the question of the Territorial<br />
Seas Bil1, on the question of the legal rights, but there may be discussion<br />
on administrative arrangements for other things like the offshore<br />
minerals?<br />
PM. Yes, I think we need to resolve the question of who has the legal<br />
sovereignty over the seas which lap Australia's coast. It seems to me to<br />
be quite absurd for Australia to be the only nation in the world that<br />
doesn't know, the only Federation in the world that doesn~' t know who has<br />
got sovereignty over the seas around it s coast. And this needs to be<br />
resolved. Now, it will' be resolved one way or the other. I mean, even<br />
if our legislation didn't go ahead and I am not suggesting for a moment<br />
that it won't but even if it didni't it would be resolved because this question<br />
having been raised by the various High Court decisiozs, there will<br />
undoubtedly be cases concerning fisheries or concerning minerals or<br />
concerning something which will lead to a case which will ultimately<br />
resolve it. But the sooner we can get it resolved the better, as the<br />
Premier of New South Wales agreed with me the other day.<br />
Q. Stan Stephens, Adelaide Advertiser While we are still on State<br />
matters, Sir, could I get in a parish pumper which is rather important.<br />
The South Australian economy, as you know, is geared to the motor<br />
body industry and to the home appliances industry. The South Australian<br />
Government is deeply concerned over the effects of the higher interest<br />
rates and the credit squeeze on the South Australian economy. Will the<br />
Commonwealth do something to help South Australia urgently? / 4 I </p>
<p>PM. 1 haven't studied this particular matter that you raise, nor has<br />
it been brought to my attention by either the previous or the present<br />
South Australian Government. Perhaps because one hasn't had time.<br />
But you used the phrase " credit squeeze" and I wonder whly you used it?<br />
Q. It was the term Mr Dunstan used. It was a pity I didn't introduce<br />
the subject better, but he made an appeal for assistance for South<br />
Australia. He made an appeal yesterday.<br />
PM. It is not unusual for him to say that. I am intrigued by these<br />
words that you used or he used " credit squeeze".* I have always thought<br />
of a credit squeeze as an occasion where a government calls up money<br />
from the trading banks and puts it into the Reserve Banlk or where it gives<br />
directions or guidance as to fields in which money should be lent or<br />
shouldn't be. 7The sort of thing that happened in 1961. 1Nw what is<br />
happening today is nothing whatever like that. Last time I came and<br />
talked to you gentlemen, you were talking about the economy and you<br />
pointed out that the Treasurer had said there was a dangerous situation<br />
those were the words, I think. Don't hold me to them....<br />
( Interjection) Menacing.<br />
PM. Menacing, right. And I said, " Well, I think it is potentially<br />
menacing. But I think it is only potentially menacing because there is<br />
going to be towards the end of this year a considerable decline in liquidity<br />
because we budgeted for a $ 500 million surplus and that is going to have<br />
its effect towards the end of this year, and it is having its effect, it is as<br />
a result of the surplus which was budgeted for, tightening up the amount<br />
of money available. But this is different, I thinklr, from what people<br />
have in their mind, when they talk about a credit squeeze. And I<br />
believe it will loosen again as soon as the financial year is over and<br />
people begin to get refunds of taxation which will be quite considerable<br />
in the first quarter of the financial year.<br />
Q. Does that mean, Sir, that you are suggesting that we can hope<br />
that the Budget mightn't be as tight as at present it appears it might?<br />
PM: Well, I am not going to talk about the Budget except to say that<br />
I don't think that is completely logical because if there is going to be a<br />
considerable loosening up of finaince available, then the conclusion you<br />
draw from it wouldn't necessarily follow. I wasn't putting this in a<br />
Budget context at all. I was just saying I believe that at the present time<br />
there is a very tight money mark-et which was foreseer-, which I pointed<br />
out to you last time we were here, which is a result of budgeting for<br />
a surplus. This will again I say this this will, in the first quarter<br />
of the next financial year quite considerably be relieved by a very<br />
rconsiderable amount of taxation refunds which will tak,-, e place, apart<br />
from anything else. </p>
<p>Q. A taxation adjustment for middle income groups, for instance?<br />
PM. Wouldn't you be surprised, really, if I gave you answers to<br />
things that are going to be in the Budget?<br />
Q. On that very question, Sir. Your last preas curierence ended in<br />
some confusion Barnes from " The on this question of taxation<br />
cuts for the middle and lower income groups. At the time you said you<br />
didn't want to discuss the Budget. What I want to do is to draw your<br />
attention to the fact that you had already discussed the Budget in the<br />
Governor-General's speech when you said the Government aimed to put<br />
before Parliament specific provisions for relief In the next Budget. Does<br />
that still stand, Sir?<br />
PM. What you have quoted, let me repeat to you, vias that I said it<br />
would be my Government's aim to put proposals before Parliament<br />
designed to carry out our promises. Now, the Budget should be brought<br />
down about August 18 and at that stage, your queries ought to be fully<br />
answered.<br />
Q. I just wanted you to give your aims, Sir. That's all, just the<br />
aims....<br />
PM. One always aims to do the best possible.<br />
Q. Peter Samuel, the Bulletin In the middle of 1, Aril, the<br />
Cambodian Government -switching to foreign policy the Cambodian<br />
Government made an urgent request to the Australian Government and<br />
other governments for military assistance to defend itsoelf against the<br />
Vietnamese communists. For two months now, there has been no<br />
response that we have heard about to that request. If there hasn't been<br />
a ny response, when do you expect there will be a res' onse? And,<br />
secondly, how important does the Australian Governme-nt consider the<br />
independence of Cambodia,<br />
PM. Well, in answer to the first part of your question, the request<br />
has been under consideration by the Depart ment of External Affairs<br />
and the Department of Defence. They have now :; repared a joint paper on<br />
what they are prepared to recommend to Cabinet that it should do, and<br />
we will quite shortly be deciding on what is suggested by these Departments.<br />
We attach a considerable amount of importance, a very great deal of<br />
importance to the independence of Cambodia. That, of course, was one<br />
reason why we were so pleased that our Foreign Minister was able to go<br />
to Djakarta to join in a conference with other Asian nations designed to<br />
try to mobilise world opinion in support of the neutrality of Cambodia<br />
and therefore of the independerce of Cambodia. I don't suggest that<br />
this corference has had any concrete effect. I don't suZgest that. / 6 </p>
<p>but I do, in answer to your question say that we regard it as of very great<br />
importance indeed and that we regard the fact that this conference in<br />
Djakarta was held as being of great importance, even though it may not<br />
have any concrete effect.<br />
Q. Laurie Oakes, Melbour-. ne Sun One of the problems with this<br />
press conference format is that you don't get a chance to follow up<br />
questions. Sir, you haven't yet answered Stan Stephenc' question atout<br />
your attitude to the South Australian Government's appeal.<br />
PM. Well I gather from Stan Stephens that it was made yesterday<br />
apparently publicly and not through the normal channels and I would prefer<br />
to wait and see whether it was made through the normal channels before<br />
I consider it. You can't go answering anybody who rushes out in a<br />
newspaper I beg your pardon, gentlemen anybody who rushes out in<br />
public and makes these sort of remarks or whatever they are.<br />
Q. And now my question, In September last year, you were quoted<br />
in Parliament that the new Melbourne airport at Tullaryarine does not<br />
necessarily come under the night flying ban. I know that you spent today<br />
looking at files in view of the current controversy, but I am wondering<br />
can you announce now whether you are prepared to lift the ban, or<br />
whether you are sympathetic to Sir Henry Bolte's demands that you should?<br />
PM. Well, first of all, I have not spent the day looking at files on this,<br />
but nevertheless it is an important question. I have been looking at it but<br />
not at files. One of the things that fascinates me about it is the way everybody<br />
rushed in and assumed and has gone on television on the assumption<br />
that the Minister has said he wouldn't lift the ban on jet flying at<br />
Tullamarine. As far as I can discover he has never said anything of the<br />
sort. What happened, as I understand it, from examining it today, was that<br />
a representative of the " Melbourne Herald" rang up the Minister and the<br />
Minister said I quote from memory but it is pretty accurate " There is<br />
at the moment no proposal before me from the Department or from any<br />
other source for altering the hours of jet curfew." That's all he said.<br />
That was comparatively faithfully reported in the " Melbourne Herald",<br />
after which a whole lot of people made comments on the assumption that<br />
he said he wasn't going to lift the jet ban. Now the position is this.<br />
There is a joint Commonwealth/ State Committee which has been looking<br />
into the operation of Tullamarine. It comprises representatives of the<br />
Department of Civil Aviation, of the State Town Planning Authority, and<br />
the Melbourne and Metropolitan Board of Works, and they have, so I am<br />
told, just reported to the Minister for Civil Aviation and to the State<br />
Minister concerned on their recommendations of how Tullamarine<br />
should be operated, and both the State Minister and the Minister for<br />
Civil Aviation are examining those reports. So, you know, it is not quite / 7 </p>
<p>so frantic as it has been made to appear, and I think the line they are<br />
taking when they operate these airports is to endeavour to see how you<br />
can get the greatest operational efficiency out of the airport married with<br />
the greatest protection for populations living around the airport. They<br />
shouldn't be living around there anyway, but we won't go into that at the<br />
moment, or the reasons why they are. But I think there is no decision<br />
taken on this yet. This Commonwealth/ State Committee Report is being<br />
examined in both places, and there is a report of our own House of<br />
Representatives Committee which would also have an elfect upon any<br />
decision which is ultimately taken, though I understand the Premier of<br />
Victoria is not very well disposed towards Senate or -buse . d Representatives<br />
Committees, but nevertheless, we would pay some attention to this one.<br />
Q. Michael Willesee " Four Corners" Prime Minister, the Press<br />
and the media have been under some examination recently. I wonder if I<br />
can ask you what you see their funct ion to be in relation to what you<br />
think their function should be in relation to government and politics. And<br />
having told us that, I wonder if you could then tell us if you think that<br />
function is being fulfilled adequately?<br />
PM. What should their function be? I think they have got a very<br />
important function, and quite inalienable rights in fulfilling that function.<br />
I think their function should be to criticise.... well, let me change that.<br />
I think their function should be to examine proposals which are brought<br />
forward by a government and after that examination to give criticism or<br />
support, supplyingtheir readers with the reasons for that criticism or<br />
that support, not suppressing reasons, not inventing reasons, not<br />
slanting anything. And also to report anything that appears to them to be<br />
instances of governmental injustice to individuals or groups of people<br />
or matters of that kind. This, I believe, is a function of the Press which<br />
is essential if a democracy is properly to run. And they have that right.<br />
Having that right, they have also got a duty because you cannot have a<br />
right without a duty or an obligation in any field. And that duty is to<br />
report accurately, to comment having given both sides of the question, but<br />
coming down on one side not to suppress one side and only put forward<br />
the other and not deliberately to misrepresent it. So they have the<br />
right which it is necessary to defend to the utmost, and they have a duty<br />
which I think they should carry out. I would add just one more thing to<br />
this. I haven't been particularly terribly disturbed, as far as I know,<br />
about criticisms of me, and I think the Press should never or the media,<br />
let us say should never get into a position where they could be thought<br />
to be saying " We are above criticism. Nobody else is, but we are.<br />
We musn't be attacked for what we have done or what we have recorded<br />
because we are above reproach." They haven't got that right but they<br />
have got every other right that I have mentioned. / 8 </p>
<p>The second part of the question, Prime Minster do you think<br />
that function is being fulfilled adequately?<br />
PM. I think it is being fulfilled adequately, though if you ask me<br />
personally, I think there are instances I could point to where I would think<br />
the criteria I have laid down have not been fully Zliowed,. so can Members<br />
of the Cpposition. But I an not only talking of political inatters. I am takinig<br />
generally. You asked me, let me give you an example ai2 a field which is<br />
not strictly political where I don't myself think a full a: zd proper coverage<br />
was given, and that is when " Four Corners" went to M' ze a story on<br />
Duntroon. I think a great deal too much lam alot getting personal here<br />
a great deal too much was devoted to people cleaning their boots and getting<br />
shouted out by a sergeant-major walking around on a parade ground and<br />
all that sort of stuff, and far too little attention given to the fact that it<br />
is a place where more academic work is done than the sort of work that<br />
was shown, that people come out of It with the equivalent of a university<br />
degree, recognised by the University of New South Wales and that it Is<br />
not really a spit and polish establishment and a place to bring up<br />
automatons but a place to partak. e of a university education as well as the<br />
discipline of an army. Now anybody can argue against that view that I<br />
hiave got, but I have got a right to put it.<br />
Q. If I could just say one little bit more there, Prim-e Minister. Do<br />
you go along with the sort of expressions that the Postmaster -General and<br />
the Queensland Premier have made in the last week?<br />
PM. I don't go along with the expressions o&amp; the Queensland Premier...<br />
I think one of them had something to do with me -if I reinember rightly,<br />
and I haven't read in detail what the Postmaster-Gerteral said last week,<br />
but surely, having just answered your questiort at some Length in the way<br />
that I have, my own position ought to be fairly clear.<br />
Q. Tom Connors " Financial Review" Githe question of assistance<br />
to the wool industry, you said at the last confereince that we had that you<br />
were waiting for the report of the Gunn Committee?<br />
PM. Yes.<br />
Q. I believe that they have completed their first report. I was<br />
wondering whether the Government has received it and have you any<br />
comment at this stage?<br />
PM. Well, I haven't received the report of the Wool idustry<br />
Advisory Committee. I don't think the Minister for Priniary Industry has<br />
received it, but I was talking to him today and we expect to receive the<br />
report within the next fortnight. / 9 </p>
<p>Q. I just want to hop on to that question of wool. Mv~ r. McEwen is<br />
going to Japan. I thought this might be an opportunity for you to clarify<br />
the reports that when you were in Japan you discussed the idea of a<br />
-negotiated price..., in the unofficial reports. Would you clarify this for<br />
us, Sir?<br />
PM. Yes, I think so. Clearly, the question of an auction system<br />
completely unchanged from the present auction system; a system where<br />
you have one purchasing authority which has been put forward without<br />
any detailed explanation of what iAs meant by it by the various woolgrowers'<br />
bodies; a question of some kind of rarrying of an auctica system and a<br />
negotiated system for particular classes of wool are all possibilities and<br />
this matter of seeking to shall I say sell wool in the na.: ne way as we<br />
sell iron ore, or partly seU wool in the same way as we sell iron ore is<br />
a matter that would need to be discussed and taken into consideration.<br />
Q. Alan Reid of the Daily Telegraph Oil health. The New South<br />
Wales medicos are reported to be contemplating a rise of nine per cent in<br />
fees. How will this affect your health scheme? Rill it affect it adversely,<br />
and if the New South Wales medicos take unilateral action, will this prompt<br />
you to implement your suggestion of a part icipa tory scaeme?<br />
PM. Well, I was talking to Dr. Forbes on this matter, perhaps two<br />
days ago and I am not sure of the basis of the report, and neither is he,<br />
that the New South Wales Branch of the AMA is consider~ ng adopting the<br />
rise you spoke of. I understand there was some membex of an economic<br />
advisory committee who leaked to the newspaper.-, or Leaked to somebody,<br />
the idea that he thought that thio could be justified. But I have got nothing<br />
so far to indicate to me that the New South Wales Bran-c'. of the AMA would<br />
adopt his proposition. If they did, they would be adopting it in a way which<br />
I think is not normal because normally they have been Waiting two years, all<br />
the time, and it is only less than a year before there = as a ri se. So I am<br />
not by any means accepting that this would in fact happen. Noiv, if it did<br />
happen then of course it would adversely affect the patien ts of our health<br />
scheme in New South Wales, because there would only be two courses open<br />
to us. One would be to increase the scale of benefits so that the patient<br />
didn't suffer, which would mean that the doctors at their own sweet will<br />
could decide what burdenis the taxpayers would have to gay. One would be<br />
to increase the scale of benefitoo, or the other wiould be riot to increase the<br />
scale of benefits whereupon the patient benefits would be eroded. Now this<br />
clearly would affect the patient adversely, and ' we would have to consider<br />
if this became a common thing just what we could and should do to protect<br />
a patient without slugging the taxpayer at some outside body's instigation.<br />
As I said when I was talking to thie Liberal Conference, our health scheme<br />
and any other health scheme medical benefits scheme must depend<br />
on most of the doctors charging an agreed common fee and that common<br />
fee only being increased at reasonable intervals and by reasonable<br />
amounts. Now, that sort of co-operation is essential from the doctors<br />
for any health scheme of this kind to work, and if it is not forthcoming<br />
and I have no indication to say that It won't then we really will have to<br />
look at how we can make it wor,. </p>
<p>Q. John Bennetts of the " Canberra Times" Does tie Government intend<br />
to prosecute any of the people who in recent days have been urging defiance<br />
of the National Service Act?<br />
PM. Well, you are talking mainly I take it of the Victorian Labor<br />
Party Conference....<br />
Q. And others.<br />
PM. I think the really serious part about this is the Victorian<br />
Labor Party Conference and what their delegateo said and did there, but<br />
I have been in touch with the Attorney-General on that question and his<br />
preliminary advice at any rate is that he believes there is not sufficient<br />
grounds to prosecute and also there is the difficulty inherent in prosecuting<br />
every member of a political party in particular which could be extraordinarily<br />
divisive. But it is a very difficult question this one and one that<br />
I would want to talk a bit more about with my Cabinet colleagues. But the<br />
really serious thing in this is that not more than eight nonths ago there<br />
was an election this country in which specifica4y the Government said<br />
they believed ,' ey would have to continue Naticnal Service and they would<br />
continue National Service, and they put that before the -eople. And,<br />
specifically, the Opposition said they would abolish National Service and<br />
they put that before the people. And by the ballot box, tae people<br />
supported the proposition that we would continue Nlational Service. Now<br />
it is a really grave and sombre thing in Australian politics so soon after<br />
that, or at any time after that, any political party in Cp; osition could<br />
urge not that the law be changed, not that all sorts of arguments should be<br />
put forward to make the people change their mind or the Government change<br />
their mind, but that the law, as propounded by a gover:. innent and supported<br />
by a people should be broken, urging that it should be broken. This is<br />
something new in Australian politics. Having been done in this case,<br />
how many other cases can it be done in? Does it not really completely<br />
break down the concept of democratic government we have got in this<br />
country for any Party in Opposition to take this sort of line? In a shortterm<br />
political way, it could, on my judgment, be advantageous for this<br />
sort of thing to happen advantageous to my Party. In the long-term<br />
Australian way, I think it is extraordinarily grave and dangerous.<br />
Q. Bob Baudino, " Daily Telegraph" Talking about the law, it is<br />
equally important to enforce the law as it stands. We have been told by<br />
your Minister, Mr. Snedden, that there is something lik. e fifty people<br />
who have broken the law now by refusing to register for National Service.<br />
Nothing has been done against these people as yet. Is anything to be<br />
done against them? 11 </p>
<p>11.<br />
PM. Yes, I think the law will have to be enforced. As you know, the<br />
Cabinet was looking to try and find a civilian alternative for people who<br />
reffused to carry out the declared obligations. I think you will forgive<br />
me if I point out to you that there are many ways in which people can avoid<br />
being called up for National Service. For example, if they join the CMF,<br />
they do not have to be called up for National Service. If they can convince<br />
a court that they are conscientious objectors, they are not called up for<br />
active service. And there are the people who remain who take their chances<br />
in a call-up, and 99. 8 per cent of them accept their obligations. For those<br />
who don't and who can't show they are conscientious objectors, we<br />
nevertheless looked to try and find a civilian alternative, a civilian<br />
alternative which would need to be as subject to discipline as would service<br />
in the Army, which would need to require as much dislocation of life as<br />
service in the Army, which didn't give an advantage to the person who said<br />
" I won't go into the Army". And we couldn't find one which we felt did<br />
that, so we believe we will have to enforce the law as it stands.<br />
QO Has the civilian alternative been abandoned, Sir?<br />
PM. Well we haven't been able to find one which meets the criteria<br />
that it doesn't give an advantage to the person who....<br />
1Q. Sir, you say you will prosecute 2O-ye rx-old youths who don't<br />
register, and yet you imply you are not going to prosecute the Victorian<br />
ALP Conference delegates, Sydney poets, professors, and GPS headmasters<br />
w~ ho defy the Crimes Act. Isn't this selective enforcement of the law'?<br />
PM. Well, it is two different laws for a start. One is the obligation<br />
to render National Service and if the law was not applied in that instance,<br />
then you might as well not have National Service because anybody could<br />
just say, " I won't go into Natiornal Service" and nothing would happen, and<br />
the whole concept of National Service would be destroyed. The other area<br />
is an area inciting people not to register which is different from the first,<br />
and that is, I think, a difficult field, but I would draw a distinction between<br />
that and refusing to render National Service when one became liable for it.<br />
Q. Is one a less important offence in your mind?<br />
PM. In my own mind, it is~ less important, a less significant offence<br />
to say to people, to say to somebody else you don't believe he should do<br />
something than to refuse to do it, but when I say that, I am not saying it<br />
it unimportant. / 12 </p>
<p>Q. Aren't they saying rather, Sir, " We believe you should not. You<br />
should defy the law rather than. I<br />
PM. Well, some are saying " We believe you should defy the law",<br />
some are not. Everybody has got lumped together in this, but the<br />
Victorian ALP Executive was saying they believed you shaould defy the<br />
law.<br />
Q. Has your attention beer. drawn to the fact, Sir, that the New<br />
South Wales ALP followed your concept, in other words-, advocated the<br />
change of the law rather than the breaking of It.<br />
PM. Yes, this appears to me to be the only proper a!-d responsible<br />
way for a political party to go on.<br />
Q. On a related subject, Sir, can you give any details of plans<br />
to withdraw our troops from Vietnam?<br />
PM. No more than when I announced in the House that we would be<br />
withdrawing troops and they would be out by November....<br />
Q. One battalion only....<br />
PM. Yes, and some supporting troops.<br />
Q. Peter Barron from the " Sydney Sun" On the civilian alternative,<br />
you said " We have not been able to find a suitable altern: ative". Did<br />
you mean " we, the Cabinet" or " we, the Government Parties"?<br />
PM. We, the Cabinet. I am not sure what is inhereat in your<br />
question. We looked for a civilian alternative in the Cabinet and we<br />
put to the party room a possible civilian alternative. The party room<br />
itself was very strongly against it on the grounds that I put forward that<br />
it did not provide for submission to discipline in the way that going into<br />
the Army did; people could get home for weeke--i-ds arind Ypeople wouldn't<br />
have to have leave and people would in fact be living a civilian life<br />
instead of an Army life.<br />
Q. Yes, but when Cabinet put this, was it satisfied that it was a<br />
suitable alternative?<br />
PM. Well, we were satisfied that we could put to the party room for<br />
its views a possible alternative. / 13 </p>
<p>Q. Barry Wain from " The Australian" On the subject of conscription,<br />
regardless of what you say, the impression is still comig across that in<br />
the case of the Victorian Executive, perhaps no action will be taken there<br />
simply because of the numbers involved as you pointed out, it is difficult<br />
to prosecute all the members of a political party whereas in the case of the<br />
very few 20-year-olds who are refusing to register, refusing to answer<br />
the call-up, they will be prosecuted.<br />
PM. h'es, well, if they were members of the Victorian Executive and<br />
who refused to answer the call-up, they would be prosecuted<br />
too. Don't get the two things mixed up. Oae is refusinr, to accept an<br />
obligation imposed by law. The other is particularly in the case of the<br />
Victorian ALP, a significant section of the ALP, I think quite clearly an<br />
attempt to grandstand, an attempt to pose as martyrs, an attempt to get us<br />
to be in a position where we could be claimed to be attacking a whole<br />
political party, and this is a matter which is, I think, quite different.<br />
Q. Ya are not being intimidated by the fact that they are members<br />
of a political party?<br />
PM. I think we would be playing into their hands.<br />
Q. Wouldn't a better solution be to change that part of the Crimes<br />
Act that says " to incite" and transform it into action?<br />
PM. Well I am bound to say that my inclination is tliat if you have a<br />
law either you apply it or you don't have it.<br />
Q. Prime Minister, in this case whether tihe laws are different, the<br />
fact is that various people have broken the law. There h-ave been cases<br />
in both Sydney and Melbourne completely outside the ALP Executive.<br />
Are you saying that one law is one that should be applied and that this<br />
other law should only be applied if you don't think it is going to lead to<br />
some political disadvantage to yourself?<br />
PM. I am saying one offence is quite differe: t from another offence.<br />
I am saying that if it is an offence for a youth to refuse to answer the<br />
call-up, and you don't apply the law to that offence, then you don't have<br />
National Service. I am saying that in the other case, the offence has a<br />
different result.<br />
Q. Sir, the Deputy Prime MUnister said the Senate election will<br />
be in November. Can you confirm that2<br />
PM. No I don't know he said it and I can't confirm it. Did he say it?<br />
/ 14 </p>
<p>14.<br />
Q. Yes. When will be the date Sir?<br />
PM. Towards the end of the at present thtnhdng.<br />
Q. Ted Barker " The West Australian" VW the Federal<br />
Government continue its subsidy to the gold minzing industry after the<br />
present subsidy expires on June<br />
PM. There is a paper before Cabinet on this at the momnent.'<br />
Q. Stewart Harris, " London Times" I was just going to suggest<br />
if you talk about the duty of obeying the law, and it is your duty as a<br />
government, Sir, if there is a low which you are not enforcing, to repeal<br />
that law. Otherwise the law gen~ erally cetnnot be respected.<br />
PM. Is that a question or a statement?<br />
Q. It is a question because I would like to hear your view On it?<br />
It is a statement and a question. Don't you agree with it?<br />
PM. PMIn. general, yes. </p>
