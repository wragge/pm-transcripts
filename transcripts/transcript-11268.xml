Dear Senator</p>
<p>I refer to our discussions this morning regarding the Government's</p>
<p> tax package and the Government's commitment to the outcomes reached.</p>
<p>Education</p>
<p>The Government will write to the Commissioner of Taxation to seek</p>
<p> a ruling on the definition of education services that are to be GST</p>
<p> free.</p>
<p>The ruling will address all instruction for students directly or indirectly</p>
<p> related to the school curriculum, excursions supervised by schools</p>
<p> and school camps. However, it is not intended that GST free treatment</p>
<p> be extended to activities that are predominantly social in nature.</p>
<p> The Government's letter to the Commissioner of Taxation will</p>
<p> include as an attachment your letter to me of 21 June 1999 on this</p>
<p> matter as items which should be covered in the ruling.</p>
<p>The Arts</p>
<p>You will recall that the Government had previously agreed to review</p>
<p> the need for additional assistance to the arts in the light of the</p>
<p> Nugent Review of arts funding with a view to ensuring that the arts</p>
<p> are not adversely effected by the impact of the GST. As the first</p>
<p> step in that process, the Government agrees to fund a study to develop</p>
<p> an appropriate methodology for measuring the likely impact of the</p>
<p> GST and related measures on the arts and a preliminary assessment</p>
<p> of the likely impact of the GST on various sectors of the industry.</p>
<p>The method will serve as the basis for an assessment of the impact</p>
<p> of the GST on the arts. This study will be concluded no later than</p>
<p> 31 December 1999 and the review will be completed by September 2001</p>
<p> at the latest.</p>
<p>Charities</p>
<p>The Government reaffirms that non-commercial charitable activities</p>
<p> will be GST free. The Government is not disposed to extend the definition</p>
<p> of a charitable institution to advocacy and other groups. In practice</p>
<p> many community groups such as neighbourhood centres should be not</p>
<p> be subject to GST because they are operated by charities or are below</p>
<p> the $100,000 registration threshold. However, given the important</p>
<p> community service role of neighbourhood centres the Government will</p>
<p> review the impact of the GST on their operations in the context of</p>
<p> the previously foreshadowed consultations between the Government and</p>
<p> the Australian Democrats on the GST impact on charities.</p>
<p>It has been agreed that these consultations will now be brought forward</p>
<p> and will occur no later than 31 December 1999. These consultations</p>
<p> will also canvass the application of rulings regarding the divide</p>
<p> between commercial and non-commercial charitable activities.</p>
<p>The Government confirms that relationship counselling will be GST</p>
<p> free where it is provided by an appropriately accredited psychologist</p>
<p> or social worker.</p>
<p>As recommended by the Vos Committee, the Government will monitor the</p>
<p> possible impact of the GST on sheltered workshop services and will</p>
<p> give careful consideration to providing additional compensation if</p>
<p> necessary.</p>
<p>The application of the GST to membership fees payable by charities</p>
<p> and tax-deductible bodies will be examined in the context of the consultations</p>
<p> on charities.</p>
<p>In relation to emergency relief payments the Government confirms that</p>
<p> where a charity pays for goods or services on behalf of a client,</p>
<p> the charity would be able to claim a credit. As discussed at our meeting,</p>
<p> where charities provide cash as emergency relief it would not be appropriate</p>
<p> to give input tax credits because there is no control over how the</p>
<p> money is spent by the client.</p>
<p>Food</p>
<p>Salads and savoury bread will be GST free. Muesli bars but not breakfast</p>
<p> bars and the like will be subject to GST. Fruit and vegetable juices</p>
<p> of at least 90% by volume will be GST free. Cordials and flavoured</p>
<p> milk will be subject to GST. Products consisting of milk not less</p>
<p> than 95% by volume will be GST free. Beverages consisting principally</p>
<p> of soy milk or rice milk, but not including flavoured beverages, will</p>
<p> be GST free. Bottled (still) natural water without any other additives</p>
<p> will also be GST free.</p>
<p>Books</p>
<p>The Government has received your proposal regarding assistance for</p>
<p> book writing and production and remains committed to developing a</p>
<p> scheme that meets our shared objectives. However, it will take time</p>
<p> to develop an appropriate scheme and the Government undertakes to</p>
<p> consult the Democrats and agree on a scheme before the resumption</p>
<p> of Parliament in August 1999. The scheme will pay particular regard</p>
<p> to the educational objectives underpinning the Democrat proposal,</p>
<p> particularly in respect of the price of text books.</p>
<p>Wine Equalisation Tax (WET)</p>
<p>Historically rebates for cellar door sales have been a State responsibility.</p>
<p> The Government and the Australian Democrats agree on the importance</p>
<p> of maintaining cellar door arrangements. The Government undertakes</p>
<p> to ensure that the States keep arrangements which provide a tax exemption</p>
<p> for cellar door and mail order sales up to $300,000.</p>
<p>The Government will also examine a number of definitional issues arising</p>
<p> from the WET bill, which you have advised, and the scope for concessional</p>
<p> treatment of low alcohol wine and intends that these be dealt with</p>
<p> in a Bill to be introduced in the Spring sittings. As a consequence</p>
<p> of these commitments the Government and the Australian Democrats are</p>
<p> agreed that the WET legislation will be passed by 30 June 1999.</p>
<p>Boarding Houses and Caravan Parks</p>
<p>A separate note on the Government's proposed treatment under</p>
<p> the GST of boarding houses and caravan parks will be provided in due</p>
<p> course.</p>
<p>It continues to be the Government's intention that the full GST</p>
<p> will not apply to long term residents.</p>
<p>GST Assistance Scheme for Low Income Persons</p>
<p>The Government is developing a scheme to provide assistance to low</p>
<p> income persons who identify themselves as outside the income tax and</p>
<p> social security systems and therefore ineligible for the compensation</p>
<p> provided in this package. Particular attention is being given to identifying</p>
<p> the groups to which the scheme will apply. The purpose of the scheme</p>
<p> is not to provide a new, generally available income-related entitlement</p>
<p> but to catch those who may otherwise slip through the income tax and</p>
<p> social security net. The Government's intention is to develop</p>
<p> a scheme in consultation with the Australian Democrats.</p>
<p>Disability Services</p>
<p>An amendment will be introduced so that any service funded under the</p>
<p> Disability Services Act 1986 (or similar State/Territory legislation)</p>
<p> will be GST free.</p>
<p>Rent Assistance</p>
<p>In addition to the previously agreed compensation package, Rent Assistance</p>
<p> will be increased by a further 3 per cent in respect of eligible private</p>
<p> renters at a cost of around $33 million per annum with effect from</p>
<p> 1 July 2000. This will bring the total increase in Rent Assistance</p>
<p> up front to 7 per cent.</p>
<p> Yours sincerely</p>
<p>(John Howard)</p>
