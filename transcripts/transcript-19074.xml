<p>Adelaide will be home to a key manufacturing precinct, as part of the Gillard Government's $1 billion jobs plan.</p>
<p>The Adelaide Defence Precinct will service the state's strong defence industry.</p>
<p>The Precinct is scheduled to be fully operation by August 2013 with initial services delivered from May this year, Prime Minister Julia Gillard announced today in Adelaide.</p>
<p>The Adelaide Defence Precinct is part of the Gillard Government's Industry and Innovation statement - A Plan for Australian Jobs. In total $504.5 million has been announced for Innovation Industry Precincts.</p>
<p>The aim of these precincts is to drive productivity, improve connections between business and the research sector and mobilise Australian industry to compete more successfully in global markets.</p>
<p>Australia has strong capabilities in designing and manufacturing world-class defence products and there are major opportunities to win new work in global supply chains.</p>
<p>The Defence Precinct, while based in South Australia, will link businesses, universities and government agencies nationally to generate economic benefits for Australian industry.</p>
<p>The Precinct will complement the Melbourne- based Enterprise Connect Defence Industry Innovation Centre and will work closely with defence focused organisations such as the Defence Materials Technology Centre and Defence SA.</p>
<p>It will foster greater collaboration across SA and the nation's diverse defence sector and will assist the state in realising its vision of employing over 37,000 workers and contributing $2.5 billion to the economy by 2020.</p>
<p>Nationally, A Plan for Australian Jobs - announced on Sunday - will help Australian businesses seize the opportunities for growth in our region and adapt successfully to changing economic conditions.</p>
<p>The plan has three key elements:<br />
â¢           Backing Australian industry to win more work at home;<br />
â¢           Supporting Australian industry to win new business abroad; and<br />
â¢           Helping Australian small and medium businesses to grow and create new jobs.</p>
<p>The location of the Adelaide Defence Precinct is expected to be announced in coming months.</p>
<p>The remaining precincts will be selected in 2013.</p>
