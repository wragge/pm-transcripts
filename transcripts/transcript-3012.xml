If<br />
September 1973 FRENCH NUCLEAR TESTS<br />
France's withdrawal of notice of a danger zone in part<br />
-of French Polynesia had not ended Australia's anxiety about French<br />
nuclear tests, the Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs,<br />
Mr. Whitlam, said tonight.<br />
The notice, signed by the French Minister for the Armed<br />
Forces, appeared in the French Government Gazette of 14 September0<br />
It cancelled, as from midnight 15 September, the notice issued on 4<br />
July " prohibiting" ships from entering a broad zone of the high<br />
seas around Moruroa Atoll and other islands.<br />
Mr. Whitlam said that if yesterday's cancellation of the<br />
shipping notice meant the end of French nuclear tests in the Pacific<br />
it would be universally welcomed, but the French Government had<br />
given no such indication.<br />
Mro Whitlam recalled that in 1970 and 1971 a similar<br />
cancellation had been followed, after a break of several weeks,<br />
by a resumption of testing at a few days' notice. Whether this<br />
would happen again this year might not be known for some time.<br />
Mr. Whitlam also recalled that the French Minister for<br />
the Armed Forces, M. Galley, was reported to have told a press<br />
conference on 31 August that France would not give an undertaking<br />
to cease atmospheric tests or to remove its testing centre from<br />
Polynesia. Australia would not slacken its efforts, by all appropriate<br />
means, to obtain a permanent halt to all nuclear tests, especially<br />
those in the atmosphere, Mr. Whitlam said. </p>
