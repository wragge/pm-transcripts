PRIME MINISTER<br />
For Media SUNDAY 29 MARCH 1981<br />
ELECTORATE TALK<br />
I find when I go around the country that people sometimes<br />
ask me: when is the Government going to loosen the purse strings<br />
and spend a bit more on projects that they think the comminft-itY<br />
needs? Let me explain the dangers of this approach. Many people seem<br />
to think that the policy of restraining Government spending that<br />
we have adopted since 1975 has been necessary only because times<br />
have been hard only because there have been serious<br />
economic difficulties such as rising prices and unemployment.<br />
Some people seem to think that once the worst of these problems<br />
are, behind us, then Governments. can begin spending a lot<br />
more again.<br />
There are many things that we can see are needed in our local<br />
communities. We need better roads; we might like an improved<br />
park; we might want to see more spent on a school or a<br />
hospital;' It is very natural that People will ask Governments<br />
to spend more, and let me say that throughout all the time that<br />
we have been restraining Government spending we have always<br />
made sure that really worthwhile projects particularly projects<br />
to help people who are disadvantaged or poor and in real<br />
need can go ahead.<br />
I might just mention here that spending on the handicapped and<br />
disabled has actually doubled in the last five years and we are now<br />
spending over a billion dollars to help these people. Helping<br />
those in need has been one of our main concerns while we<br />
have tried to restrain Government spending in areas which do<br />
not have such high priority.<br />
The important point I want to make tonight is that higher<br />
Government spending-does not necessarily produce improvements<br />
i~ n our community or in our country. While some people may<br />
benefit, very serious problems can be caused to other people when<br />
Government spending is too high. After all, all Government<br />
spending has to be paid for by taxation. Governments do not<br />
have money of their own to spend. The money comes from you the<br />
taxpayers. And the more governments give in to the demands of<br />
people to spend more money the higher your taxes are going<br />
to be. ./ 2 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
We have taken the view that Australians need lower not<br />
higher taxes and our policies are direct4 d to achieving<br />
this. We have taken the view that peopld know how to spend<br />
their own incomes a great deal better than officials and<br />
politicians do. We believe that in the end this-produces-. a<br />
much more satisfactory life for everyone than taking<br />
away people's income so that governments can spend it for<br />
them. Government spending needs to be kept for those matters<br />
like defence, education, social security and other vital<br />
public services which people can't easily provide without<br />
Government. I think this point is probably well enough<br />
understood.<br />
What I find is not so well recognised is that high government<br />
spending can actually create social problems and the two<br />
most serious problems that it has created in recent years<br />
have been inflation and unemployment. Let me just talk about<br />
unemployment. Government spending which is too high can destroy jobs. Most<br />
jobs in our community three out of every four jobs are<br />
provided by private enterprise. Private enterprise can only<br />
grow and provide jobs when it can obtain the money to expand<br />
and when people have the confidence to buy. When governments<br />
spend too much there is less available to private enterprise,<br />
particularly to small businesses which provide most of our<br />
jobs. They can't expand and as a consequence people can't<br />
find work. The government has to make room for private<br />
enterprise. I am sometimes asked why the government doesn't do more to<br />
make work. The government is concerned to create jobs that<br />
are productive, jobs that have a future. I do not believe that<br />
the taxpayers want the government to spend massive sums on<br />
dead-end, short-term jobs. And that's why the government<br />
rejects make-work schemes which drain money which private<br />
enterprise needs to create productive jobs. We prefer to<br />
give assistance to employers to take on more people. We<br />
have set up a programme called the Special Youth Employment<br />
Training Programme under which 75,000 young people will be<br />
helped this year in this way. The G overnment gives very high<br />
priority indeed to helping young people particularly to obtain<br />
the training afid skills they need to get satisfying jobs.<br />
You may be surprised to learn that in this current year over<br />
200,000 youpig people under 25 years of age will be assisted<br />
by government training and employment programmes.<br />
The Government is very concerned to see that our school system is more<br />
successful in helping our young people obtain the necessary skills for<br />
jobs which are opening up, now that the signs of economic<br />
recovery are all around us. Now that private enterprise is<br />
pibking up-the ball, thousands of new jobs are being created<br />
and employment is growing steadily despite what some people<br />
have said. </p>
<p>3<br />
It is even more important for governmenrEtto continue to be<br />
responsible in its own spending programmes so that private<br />
enterprise can take full advantage of the magnificent<br />
opportunities now opening up. Restraint in government<br />
spending is a policy that is helping to create a strong<br />
and vigorous growing Australia with an exciting future.<br />
It is one of the main ways in which we can guarantee<br />
Australia's future. It is the way in which we will reduce<br />
taxes and create jobs. It will help us to keep prices down<br />
and free available resources to help those who really need<br />
help. Responsibility here as in most other areas of life is<br />
the best way to achieve what we all want.<br />
