    <content><![CDATA[<p>Australia's 3 month National Firearms Amnesty has led to more than 50,000 firearms being handed in across Australia.</p>
<p>This is an overwhelming response and represents a significant reduction in the number of unregistered firearms in the Australian community.</p>
<p>Australia has some of the strongest gun laws in the world but illicit firearms remain a threat to community safety.</p>
<p>As a result of this successful amnesty, there are now 50,000 fewer firearms on the streets.</p>
<p>While the amnesty has now finished, the Justice Minister Michael Keenan is encouraging people who still have an unregistered firearm, or who come into possession of an unregistered firearm, to contact their local police station or firearm registry.</p>
<p>The firearms surrendered under the amnesty ranged from historic pre-1900 weapons and guns from both World Wars, to modern semi automatic firearms, a homemade machine gun and even a rocket launcher.</p>
<p>A number of more unusual items were also handed in. These included a sawn-off shotgun found at a local tip in 1995, a handgun used in the early 1900s for personal protection, a pistol small enough to fit in the palm of a hand, and a heavily modified Russian shotgun.</p>
<p>The Turnbull Government is continuing the Howard legacy of strong gun control laws. We are also seeking to increase penalties for gun traffickers, including with mandatory minimum sentences.</p>
<p>But Labor opposes this change. Theyâ€™ve blocked it in the parliament three times. Labor and Bill Shorten are a soft touch on gun control and would rather have gun smugglers roaming the streets.</p>
<p>This amnesty has succeeded in keeping Australians safe, and confirms the resolute commitment of the Turnbull Government to national security.</p>
<p>Contact details for state and territory firearm registries can still be found on the firearms amnesty website.</p>
