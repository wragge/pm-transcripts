CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
AUSTRALIAN QUALITY AWARDS<br />
MELBOURNE 8 NOVEMBER 1989<br />
Allan Moyes,<br />
Ladies and gentlemen,<br />
In your introductory comments, Allan, you referred to that<br />
most dramatic of processes taking place in Australia today:<br />
the redefinition of Australia's role in the changing world.<br />
I think everyone here, from no matter what industry or<br />
policy sector, finds common ground in the assertion of the<br />
fundamental importance of that process of redefinition.<br />
Earlier this week, with the successful conclusion to the<br />
first Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting, we not only<br />
saw dramatic evidence that this redefinition is taking<br />
place; we also got a clear indication of the direction in<br />
which we are moving to take up the challenge of global<br />
change. I confess I am delighted at the outcome of the APEC meeting.<br />
This was the first time that twelve economies of the dynamic<br />
region of which Australia is part had met, as a region, to<br />
discuss the scope for closer economic cooperation in the<br />
region. Naturally I'm pleased to have initiated the process that<br />
brought so many senior ministers to Canberra for such a<br />
productive meeting.<br />
But more importantly, I believe it's important for all<br />
Australians and it's certainly important for anyone<br />
committed to improving the quality of Australian products<br />
and services that this forum, essentially experimental and<br />
unprecedented in nature, has laid such promising foundations<br />
for future cooperation in the Asia Pacific region. </p>
<p>2.<br />
The meeting identified a number of specific areas of future<br />
possible cooperation and also agreed, as you know, to<br />
reconvene first in Singapore and then in the Republic of<br />
Korea. Very importantly, it agreed on a meeting of regional<br />
Trade Ministers to be held in the context of the Uruguay<br />
round of trade talks.<br />
What these meetings mean or more precisely, what the<br />
spirit underlying them means is that there is a widespread<br />
determination to work together so as to maximise the<br />
opportunities for further growth and enhanced prosperity<br />
throughout the Asia Pacific Region including, not least,<br />
Australia. What I want to stress this evening is that, from Australia's<br />
point of view, international diplomatic efforts such as the<br />
strengthening of regional cooperation go hand in hand with<br />
the domestic effort, even the enterprise-level effort, to<br />
improve the quality of our production of goods and services.<br />
All the attempts that the Government makes on the<br />
international front to improve our economic well-being<br />
such as in APEC, and in the Cairns Group of fair trading<br />
nations that has been pushing for a liberalisation of world<br />
trade will be weakened if in our domestic economic<br />
arrangements and attitudes we fail to recognise the<br />
importance of improving efficiency and productivity.<br />
In an interdependent world, there are almost limitless<br />
opportunities for Australia to grow through enmeshment with<br />
the Asia-Pacific region through trade, investment,<br />
tourism, education links. But by the same token these<br />
opportunities can only be fully realised if there is a<br />
preparedness in domestic terms to be flexible, to<br />
restructure outmoded economic institutions, to abandon<br />
outmoded and inefficient work and management practices, and<br />
to implement, with determination, our commitment to quality.<br />
That is why I am delighted to be here tonight to present<br />
once more the Australian Quality Awards, and why I<br />
congratulate Enterprise Australia for its hard work and its<br />
vision that has drawn attention, through these Awards, to<br />
the critical issue of quality.<br />
What we have seen over the last six and a half years and<br />
what the concept of the Australian Quality Awards recognises<br />
is a comprehensive and effective program of reform to make<br />
Australia a more efficient, more productive and therefore<br />
more prosperous place.<br />
What we must develop is a strong and vigorous export<br />
culture. That, fundamentally, is the economic rationale behind<br />
Australia's multilateral diplomacy in APEC and the Cairns<br />
Group. </p>
<p>That is the rationale behind the massive tariff cuts we have<br />
made. That is why we support AUSTRADE and provide other export<br />
assistance measures.<br />
That is why we have embarked on the nation's first sweeping<br />
program of micro-economic reform, recognising that change is<br />
required not only in export and import-competing industries,<br />
but also in the industries that supply them with inputs, and<br />
also in the infrastructure by which goods and services are<br />
moved within Australia.<br />
And it is that same goal the development of an export<br />
culture that is behind our support for the massively<br />
important strategy of award restructuring.<br />
Award restructuring provides the necessary flexibility to<br />
allow companies to take advantage of new technology and<br />
production processes and to remove restrictive work and<br />
management practices.<br />
This can only contribute to the development of corporate<br />
spirit and identity, which in turn fosters increased<br />
productivity and pride of workmanship.<br />
In other words, it helps increase the quality of the goods<br />
and services we produce and thus improve the international<br />
reputation of Australian products.<br />
I have said the development of our export culture or, to<br />
refer back to Allan's phrase, the redefinition of<br />
Australia' s role in the world is a comprehensive program.<br />
It involves us all.<br />
Not least, it requires managers to rethink the way they have<br />
gone about their job and to consider their contribution to<br />
the production process.<br />
The Quality movement led by Enterprise Australia is<br />
dedicated to training managers in techniques that will raise<br />
the productivity and competitiveness of Australian industry<br />
not just improving the quality of the finished product,<br />
but emphasising -the importance of quality at every stage of<br />
the production process.<br />
The introduction of these quality control production<br />
techniques is not, it seems, without cost. In fact, a<br />
common experience appears to be that costs increase. But<br />
the point is that increased costs are at least offset by the<br />
increased value of the higher quality finished goods.<br />
and in a world where competition is as much about<br />
quality as it is about price, that is no small<br />
achievement. </p>
<p>It is very pleasing to note that the quality of the<br />
applications for the Awards this year has improved<br />
significantly and that the evaluation criteria used by the<br />
judges has also been correspondingly tightened.<br />
I'm looking forward to announcing who has won these awards<br />
and to congratulating them for their fine achievements.<br />
But I think we would all agree that our vision for a more<br />
export-oriented Australia, for an Australia that has<br />
successfully redefined its role in the world, will not be<br />
complete until all Australians, and not just the winners and<br />
finalists of these Awards, have accepted in their day to day<br />
work the paramount need for and desirability of quality.<br />
I thank the organisers for their contribution tonight, I<br />
congratulate the winners for their success, and I commend<br />
the Quality movement for its constructive effort in pursuing<br />
this vital national goal. </p>
