    <content><![CDATA[<p>I congratulate Tim Gartrell on his tremendous service to the Australian Labor Party.</p>
<p>Tim served as National Secretary of the ALP for more than five years, after spending more than three years in the role of Assistant National Secretary.</p>
<p>Tim's leadership qualities during this often difficult period for our party were superb.</p>
<p>As National Campaign Director, Tim was instrumental in the election of a Federal Labor Government.</p>
<p>His ability, hard work, judgment and campaign leadership skills are first class.</p>
<p>Tim was also a great advocate for and helped ensured the promotion of a new generation of quality ALP MPs.</p>
<p>I wish Tim, Kerry and Rose all the best for their future.</p>
