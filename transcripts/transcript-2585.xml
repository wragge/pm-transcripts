LIBERAL PARTY RALLY<br />
CIVIC CENTRE<br />
SOUTH PERTH<br />
Speech by the Prime Minister, the Rt. Hon. William M4cMahon, CH, MP<br />
May 7, 1972.<br />
Ladies and Gentlemen,<br />
This is my second visit to the " W'est" in ten months and I<br />
can assure you that both occasions have been rewarding. I have<br />
been delighted by the warmth and strength of support for the<br />
Liberal Party and the coalition government generally. I have found<br />
this warm support everywhere I have gone during this five day visit<br />
to Western Australia. There is undoubtedly a wave of enthusiasm<br />
for liberalism running for us here. I think there are ' a number of<br />
good reasons for this. There is the steadily rising tide of<br />
business and economic confidence including the strong recovery of<br />
the rural economy. There is a widespread and accurate impression<br />
that the worst is well behind us economically. The economy " bottomed<br />
out" in the first months of the year and the recovery is well and<br />
truly underway. I think we are also getting some be nefit from<br />
disillusionment at the state level.<br />
West Australians are always prepared to give even a Labcr<br />
Government a fair go. But I think-the resurgence of Liberal Party<br />
membership and the great warmth I have encountered here indicate<br />
very clearly which way the political tide is running now. I don't<br />
think doctrinaire attempts to impose bureaucratic and cumbersome<br />
controls do anything but downgrade individual freedom and interfere<br />
with individual initiative. It's clear that West Australians<br />
recognise this in relation to price control plans. At -the Foderal<br />
level, there has been a fair amount ofl discussion about price control.<br />
We have responded initially by commissioning a document which will<br />
review the operation of price control attempts both in Australia<br />
and overseas. When it is complete, we will present that document<br />
to the Parliament and allow debate on it. In that way, people can<br />
be fully informed about the consequences of prices control. We are<br />
opposed to it, at this stage at least. We believe it leads to<br />
distortions and economic bottlenecks and that real headway against<br />
inflation is more likely to come through an attack on its root causes.<br />
Here I refer to the ccmbination of industrial lawlessness and<br />
excessive and unremitting wage demands that we have experienced. / 2 </p>
<p>During the year the end cf Decamber average weekly<br />
earnings went up by 11 Per cent, and during the year up-to the end<br />
of March, prices went up by 7 per cent. Productivity or the actual<br />
increase in real production and income from the economy was around<br />
2 or 3 per cent. The inescapable result of that situation is an<br />
inflationary pressure which sooner or later breaks out in a.<br />
of price increases. Rising prices affect evorybody especially do<br />
they make life hardenfor fixed income earners and others who have<br />
limited influence over the level of their own income. That aspect<br />
of this problem is particularly on my mind today, as I have just<br />
come from a ceremony where I openod a new section of a home for old<br />
people, and I am also glad to see that in tho national wage decision<br />
the Arbitration Commission placed the major emphasis on the increase<br />
in the minimum wage. But of course, others have been doing quite<br />
well through the exercise of industrial muscle by militant and<br />
powerful unions groups, and this is the question that lies at the<br />
heart of the inflationary problem. This is the issue which must be<br />
dealt with before we can be confident of restoring price stability.<br />
The time lost in strikes last year increased very strongly<br />
over the previous year. The total increase in the time lost was<br />
28 per cent and the total of wages lost was 45 million dollars. We<br />
have not just been standing idly by in this situation. We have<br />
made decisions on a whole package of measures to fight inflation.<br />
They can -, mmarised unde,-r four major decision areas:-<br />
There was our decision to make the most significant changes<br />
to the industrial laws since 1947. We brought these amendments<br />
into Parli&amp; ment only a few days ago, and they will be debated this<br />
week. They will provide for secret ballots and they will strengthen<br />
the arbitration system which has served this nation so well for so<br />
long. Next, there was our decision. to-promote grecat competition<br />
in business. We are going : Eo do this by strengthening the<br />
restrictive trade practices laws and reviewing the level of tariff<br />
protection. This wil~ l make it harder to pass on wage increases too<br />
readily given, by simply raising prices. Next, there was cur<br />
decision to exercise our influence before the wage tribunal to<br />
exercise moderation in wage increases in the C.-omomqalth's Iwn<br />
area of influence. Lastly, there was our decision for continuous<br />
Commonwealth intervention in important wage cases oefore the<br />
Arbitration Commission. tc-iiwnress on the arbitration tribunals<br />
as strongly as we were capable of doing what the economic<br />
consequences of their decisions would be.<br />
For months until the carpenters case we had very indifferent<br />
success in this. But in recent weeks, and in the national wage<br />
decision only on Friday, our policy of wage restraint is starting to<br />
bear fruit. We have a balanced and sensible decision in the<br />
national wage case. It presents us with a nationai opportunity to<br />
make further real headway against inflation. We need now a period<br />
of industrial peace and Price stability. Union leaders should<br />
realise that the best interests of their own members lie in<br />
curbing inflation. Employers too, must not use this wage decision<br />
as an excuse for further price rises. Let's have a bit of oi~ a<br />
fashioned commonsense, moderation and restraint. </p>
<p>aI<br />
4 3.<br />
I have outlined our major areas of decision in combating<br />
inflation. There are many other areas of national life where we<br />
have shown a willingness to act boldly and decisively in matters<br />
calling for public decisions. We have implemented a whole string of<br />
economic management decisions from action on interest rates and<br />
bank lending in the secona nalf of last year through to the mini-<br />
Budget", just a couple of weeks ago. Throughout that period we<br />
have not hesitated to make a decision to further stimulate the<br />
economy. We will not hesitate to do so in the future. We have<br />
made many other decisions and taken initiatives right across the<br />
spectrum of national policies; whether it be in land rights for<br />
aboriginals in defence aid to Indonesia and Malaysia or in our<br />
early recognition of, and support for, Bangla Desh: whether it be<br />
in our initiative to establish the Australian Environment Council<br />
of Commonwealth and State ministers. And I will be making a<br />
further statement of national policy on environmental policy quite<br />
soon. In the defence area we have recognised the importance of the<br />
Indian Ocean to cur strategy. We have gone ahead with the: second<br />
stage of Cockburn Sound. We are spending twelve and a half million<br />
upgrading Learmonth Airfield as a base for long range reconnaissance.<br />
Take education as another example. In December, we made a<br />
decision that 20 million dollars would be given to the states for<br />
classroom ccnstruction and some of that money is already being<br />
used to replace or refurbish old schools in inner suburban areas.<br />
We made a decision to increase the grants to independent schools<br />
and we liberalised tax deduction provision for education. We<br />
decided on an extensive programme of support for the arts. We are<br />
nep ng the wool industry: We have a programme of rural<br />
reconstruction. Ladies and Gentlemen, I have a list here which covers over<br />
pages describing our nolicv decisions I will not list them<br />
all, but I will say that as these aecisions work through the<br />
community; as they become more widely known; as economic confidence<br />
grows stronger; as Australians come to understand the serious<br />
defects and consequences of the policies of our opponents, then I<br />
have complete confidence that policies of the Liberal Party and the<br />
decisions and actions of this coalition Government will ensure our<br />
safe return as a Government. We are in a particularly strong<br />
position here in the " West" and I ask you to do all you can to<br />
help return the Liberal candidate in your electorate. </p>
