    <content><![CDATA[<p>PM. No. 95/1967</p>
<p>Statement by the Frime Minister and Chairman of theÂ Australian Loan Council, Mr Harold Holt</p>
<p>The Prime Minister, Mr Harold Holt, said today that a newÂ Commonwealth cash loan will be open for public subscription from Friday,Â 6 October to Friday 13 October. The loan will be the second cash loan duringÂ the current financial year, the first having been issued in July last.</p>
<p>An offer of conversion will be made at the same time to holdersÂ of $272 million of Commonwealth securities maturing on 15 October.</p>
<p>Terms for the new loan are as follows:-</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">4.5 per cent August, l970Â securities issued at 99.75Â to yield approximately 4. 59Â per cent;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">5 per cent July l977 securities issued at par;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">5.25 per cent July 1989 securities issued at par; and</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">5.25 per cent July 2003 securities issued at par.</p>
<p>The securities being issued are the same as those offered in theÂ July cash loan, but the issue price of the August 1970Â securities has beenÂ adjusted to allow for the shorter period to maturity.</p>
<p>The first interest payment on the August, l970Â securities will beÂ made to the original subscriber on 15 October, 1967. The second interestÂ payment, covering a period of four instead of the usual six months, will be<br />made on 15 February 1968. Full six-monthly interest payments will beÂ made to holders of these securities on 15 August, 1968 and half-yearlyÂ thereafter.</p>
<p>Holders of the $272 million of maturing securities eligible for theÂ conversion offer may convert their holdings into any of the securities offeredÂ in the cash loan. The maturing securities were issued in March and August,<br />1954 and carried interest at 4 1/2 Â per cent. Special Bonds Series 0 will remainÂ on issue for cash subscriptions and will also be available for conversion fromÂ the maturing securities.</p>
<p>The usual income tax rebate of 10Â cents in the dollar will apply toÂ interest received from the securities offered in the cash and conversionÂ loans and from Special Bonds Series C.</p>
<p>Further details of the cash and conversion offer are set out inÂ prospectuses which are being circulated to all banks and stockbrokers.</p>
<p>CANBERRA,<br />29Â September,1967</p>
<p>NOTE : During the absence of the Treasurer ( Mr McMahon) overseas, Mr HoltÂ is chairman of the Australian loan Council. This follows normal proceduresÂ adopted when the Treasurer, whom the Prime Minister customarily nominates<br />as Chairman, is overseas.</p>
