PRIME MINISTER<br />
EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
LAUNCH OF RURAL WOMEN'S SURVEY<br />
BATHURST 8 FEBRUARY 1988<br />
David Simmons,<br />
ministerial colleagues John Kerin and Margaret Reynolds,<br />
Dorothy Ross<br />
Today we are releasing the results of a very important<br />
survey about the needs of Australia's rural women.<br />
But we are doing more than simply publicising the results of<br />
a survey as valuable an exercise in consultation as that<br />
survey has been.<br />
We are also demonstrating our recognition that women living<br />
in rural areas face special problems which Governments have<br />
a responsibility to understand.<br />
In that spirit then I must at the outset make special<br />
mention of the new Federal Minister whose responsibility it<br />
is to assist me in the development of policies on the status<br />
of women.<br />
Senator Margaret Reynolds has always been active in both<br />
women's issues and rural concerns.<br />
Her role as minister principally responsible for the<br />
Government's policies on women, as well as her ministerial<br />
portfolio of Local Government, means she has a unique role<br />
to play in the area of rural women.<br />
of course she has a hard act to follow.<br />
Senator Susan Ryan, as a Member of Parliament, minister and<br />
Cabinet Minister, played a pioneering role in the<br />
achievement by women of more equal opportunity and access<br />
role in Australian society.<br />
The Equal Opportunities and Sex Discrimination Acts, in<br />
whose formulation and implementation Susan Ryan played a<br />
major part, will stand as lasting monuments to her work, as<br />
well as enduring proofs of my Government's commitment to<br />
equality of opportunity for all Australians. 004311 </p>
<p>2.<br />
I am confident that Margaret Reynolds will be able to<br />
continue Susan Ryan's good work in this field.<br />
I know she will have your good wishes and your cooperation<br />
in that task.<br />
Let me also pay tribute to another great advocate and<br />
promoter of the interests of Australian women who is present<br />
today, the President of the Country Women's Association,<br />
Dorothy Ross.<br />
The CWA has for many years been an important community link<br />
for country and rural women.<br />
Under the Presidency of Dorothy Ross, it has continued to<br />
grow.<br />
When Dorothy approached me in July 1985 about the<br />
possibility of canvassing women living outside Australia's<br />
major population centres about their needs and priorities, I<br />
welcomed her suggestion.<br />
I saw it as a valuable opportunity to undertake<br />
comprehensive consultations with a part of the Australian<br />
community which is not often consulted and whose views are<br />
little understood.<br />
I asked the Office of the Status of Women in my department<br />
to assist the CWA in the conduct of the survey.<br />
As a result of the assiduous efforts and widespread networks<br />
of both the CWA and the office of the Status of Women, some<br />
14,000 Australian women gave us the benefit of their views.<br />
To supplement the statistics which emerged from this<br />
process, a series of informal discussions with rural women<br />
was held in three states.<br />
As a result we have a unique and valuable document which<br />
throws new light on the problems and aspirations of<br />
Australia's rural women.<br />
Social issues head the list, including isolation and<br />
remoteness, and lack of facilities, services and<br />
information. Financial and economic issues, essential<br />
services, education and employment are also high priorities<br />
for attention.<br />
Senator Reynolds, in her new capacity as Minister Assisting<br />
me on the Status of Women,. will be working with her<br />
Ministerial Adviser, Sue West, on refining these suggestions<br />
and in conducting further consultations.<br />
The Government will consider its response to this survey,<br />
taking into account several other rural advisory groups,<br />
including the Country Task Force a group of Government<br />
members whose role is to listen, assess and report directly<br />
to me on issues of importance to country people. () 04312 </p>
<p>The Government will also ensure that all State and Territory<br />
Governments and respective State and Territory Local<br />
Government Associations are aware of the findings of the<br />
survey. They will then by able to communicate any<br />
initiatives direct to the CWA.<br />
The rural women's survey complements other consultative<br />
efforts we have undertaken.<br />
The Aboriginal Women's Task Force last year produced the<br />
report " Women's Business" on the basis of extensive<br />
consultation with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island<br />
people.<br />
And women across Australia have also been consulted as part<br />
of the research for the National Agenda for women.<br />
I will be releasing the Government's response to the<br />
National Agenda later this month to set forth action plans<br />
and goals in areas of concern to women as we move to the<br />
year 2000.<br />
Already, however, the Government has put in place a number<br />
of programs which have particular relevance to rural women.<br />
In the consultations for the National Agenda, and in the<br />
rural survey, so many women referred to the problem of<br />
domestic violence that we decided something had to be done<br />
about it.<br />
No woman should ever live in fear of such violence. We want<br />
to let everyone know domestic violence is unacceptable and<br />
accordingly we are developing a three year education<br />
campaign on this problem.<br />
Another large scale campaign involves getting more women to<br />
have cancer screening tests. Breast cancer and cervical<br />
cancer are major killers but many women, including those<br />
in rural or isolated areas, don't have access to screening<br />
services.<br />
As part of a pilot program in the Department of Community<br />
Services and Health, women will be encouraged to take part<br />
in a variety of screening trials which will help determine<br />
the best ways of reducing the incidence of cancer.<br />
We have introduced the rural Grants for Women program to<br />
counter the comparative disadvantage of rural and provincial<br />
women in gaining of access to job opportunities and general<br />
services.<br />
These one-off grants are available to organisations, groups<br />
or individuals for projects or research in the areas of<br />
employment, training, or services.<br />
Fifteen grants under the 1987-88 program were announced last<br />
December, and John Kerin is to announce two more today. 004313 </p>
<p>4.<br />
A common theme which emerges from consultation with women<br />
throughout Australia is the critical importance of access to<br />
education and training in the achievement of full<br />
participation by women in our economic and social life.<br />
Since its election in 1983 this Government has made<br />
expansion of educational opportunities a priority.<br />
It was a national disgrace that when we came to office only<br />
about one-third of our students were staying on at secondary<br />
school to Year 12.<br />
As a result of our policies, that proportion is now over one<br />
half. By the early 1990s, we hope that two-thirds of our<br />
students will be completing their schooling, opening the<br />
door to a fuller and more satisfying adult life.<br />
The expansion of the Technical and Further Education system<br />
has provided improved access for thousands of Australians<br />
living in rural areas. New campuses have been built, others<br />
have been refurbished, and the range of courses has been<br />
expanded.<br />
As well, the National Policy for the Education of Girls is<br />
encouraging recognition of the special needs of girls in<br />
rural communities where the range of work and training is<br />
restricted. In the area of child care, which has been a particular<br />
priority of my Government, special funding has been made<br />
available to family day care schemes serving large rural and<br />
remote areas.<br />
Ladies and Gentlemen<br />
It is not my intention to list exhaustively all the efforts<br />
we are making to improve the status of women in Australian<br />
society including rural women and to enhance their<br />
access to government services.<br />
It is a record of which I am proud but much remains to be<br />
done. In 1922, at the inaugural conference of the Queensland<br />
Country Women's Association, the state president, Mrs<br />
Fairfax, made this comment.<br />
" In our Association we are a great sisterhood of<br />
women, and a democratic one, putting aside petty<br />
difficulties of position, wealth, and pride. We<br />
are out to be a mutual help to one another, the<br />
town to the country and the country to the town,<br />
and there is plenty of room for improvement in this<br />
way. 1 004314 </p>
<p>That spirit of mutual help I believe summarises the great<br />
contribution of the CWA over many years. The Association's<br />
role in preparing this survey is yet another proof of its<br />
longstanding commitment to seeking the improvements for<br />
which Mrs Fairfax called in 1922.<br />
Let me close by recording my Government's thanks to the<br />
women on whose views this survey is based and to the broader<br />
group of women, of today and of the future, whose interests<br />
will be served by it. 004315<br />
