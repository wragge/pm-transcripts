SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
LUNCHEON FOR THEIR ROYAL HIGHNESSES<br />
THE DUKE AND DUCHESS OF YORK<br />
CANBERRA -29 SEPTEMBER 1988<br />
Your Royal Highnesses,<br />
Mr President,<br />
Madam Speaker,<br />
Leader of the Opposition,<br />
Distinguished Guests,<br />
Ladies and Gentlemen.<br />
It gives me great pleasure on behalf of the Australian<br />
Government and people to welcome to Australia their Royal<br />
Highnesses the Duke and Duchess of York and in particular<br />
to receive them as our guests here in our National<br />
Parliament. May I at the outset take this opportunity to congratulate<br />
you both on the birth of your daughter Her Royal Highness<br />
Princess Beatrice. we are naturally sorry you were unable<br />
to bring her with you on this occasion but we appreciate<br />
your presence here all the more.<br />
Your Royal Highnesses, we are delighted that, in your first<br />
official visit to Australia, you are able to share with us<br />
in our Bicentennial celebrations.<br />
Your visit follows those of the Prince and Princess of Wales<br />
in January and the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh in April<br />
and may.<br />
Between them they have visited all the Australian States and<br />
Territories. Their presence has given pleasure to many<br />
Australians. Among their many memorable contributions here<br />
we recall in particular the speech by Prince Charles in<br />
Sydney on Australia Day and the opening by the Queen, in<br />
this Great Hall, of our new Parliament House.<br />
Your Royal Highness, it is especially appropriate that you,<br />
as a serving Naval officer, should participate in the<br />
Bicentennial Naval Salute on Sydney Harbor and should as the<br />
Queen's representative take the salute on Saturday.<br />

<p>It will be the greatest peace-time assembly of Naval ships<br />
ever to grace Australian waters some fifty vessels will<br />
take part in the review, from fifteen countries as well as<br />
Australia, and involving more than seventeen thousand<br />
sailors.<br />
We all remember with pride the celebration of the Royal<br />
Australian Navy's 75th Birthday just two years ago when the<br />
Duke of Edinburgh, as Admiral of the Fleet, took the salute.<br />
Having seen fleets on Sydney Harbor both on that occasion<br />
and last January when the Tall Ships arrived, I can assure<br />
you of a spectacular and memorable sight this weekend.<br />
Your Royal Highnesses, Australians are proud, with good<br />
reason, of their achievements in creating over two hundred<br />
years a democratic society and a peaceful and tolerant and<br />
multicultural community.<br />
Proud as we are of our British heritage, today Australia is<br />
home for people of many cultures from all corners of the<br />
globe and we are aware too of the achievements of the<br />
Aboriginal people who cared for this land for more than<br />
40,000 years before 1788. We are a nation which reaches out<br />
to the rest of the world in friendship and which takes pride<br />
in the opportunities which abound here for prosperity and<br />
growth. Over the next few days as you travel around this country, I<br />
trust you will see this Australia and that you will meet<br />
many Australians who I am sure will extend to you a warm<br />
Australian welcome.<br />
Your Royal Highnesses, it is with real pleasure that we<br />
welcome you both to our country. We hope that you enjoy<br />
your visit because we enjoy having you visit us. 23212 </p>
