FOR PRESS ~ E'o'b 2 4 JAN 1968 ~ PM. No. 716<br />
t"-ALKS WITH MR THOMSON ON BRITIH<br />
WITHDRAWAL<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, Senator John Gorton<br />
The Right Honourable George Thomson, British<br />
Secret ary of State for , Ommonwealth Affairs, today told the Australian<br />
Government of British proposals for speeding up the withdrawal of<br />
British forces from Singapore and Malaysia.<br />
The precise proposals will not be disclosed partly<br />
because the British Cabinet has not yet, as we are told, made final<br />
decisions, and partly because we hope that these proposals may be<br />
modified in the light of the views expressed by Australia, New Zealand,<br />
Malaysia and Singapore. However, It can be said that the proposals amount to<br />
drastic alterations of previously understood arrangements as to the<br />
continuing availability of British forces In the region<br />
Australian Ministers expressed their keen concern at<br />
the proposals and made it clear without In any way becoming involved<br />
In rancourcr reedination that they were not resigned to the proposals<br />
and oould not accept them without protest.<br />
They stressed that questions of security are global<br />
questions and that It was vital not to damage the security system of the<br />
South-East Asian region. They expressed the view that a continued<br />
presence of British forces In Malaysia and Singapore could provide a<br />
greater contribution to peace and security than the deployment of those<br />
forces in the European region, and that if economic considerations led<br />
the British Government to their present proposals, it might be preferable<br />
to make savings In some other area than thux of Malaysia and Singapore.<br />
They also stressed that Australia and New Zealand did not have the<br />
capacity to take over the role which British forces had been playing in<br />
that area. Mr Thomson will bring Australia's views before the<br />
British Cabinet before a final decision is made.<br />
