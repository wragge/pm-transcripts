SPEECH BY THE PRIME~ MINISTER, THE RT. HON.<br />
SIR ROBERT MENZIES KT CH QC MP, FROM<br />
THE CRYPT OF ST. P1AUL' CA' 1EDLAL,' 1ONDON<br />
OVER BBC TELEVISION ON THE OCCASION OF THE<br />
FUNERAL OF TIE LATE SIR a~ INSTON CHURCHILL 3OTA AIY16<br />
As this historic procession goes through the stp'eets<br />
of London to the Tower pier, I have the honour of speaking to<br />
you from the crypt of St. Paul's Cathedral, I do this in two<br />
capacities. One is that I, Prime Minister of Australia, happen<br />
to be, in point of time, the senior Commonwealth Prime Minister,<br />
and therefore speak on behalf of a remarkable world organisation<br />
which owes more than it can ever express to our departed leader.,<br />
Sir Winston Churchill. He is one of the famous men whom we<br />
thank and praise. My second capacity is more personal and more intimate.<br />
I am sure that you, mo st of you, have thought about Sir Winston<br />
Churchill a great deal and with warmth in your hearts and in<br />
your recollections. dome day, some year, there will be old<br />
men and women whose pride it will be to say " I lived in<br />
Churchill's time"; some will be able to say, " I saw him, and<br />
I heard him the unforgettable voice and the immortal words."<br />
And some will be able to say " I knew him, and talke~ d with him,<br />
and was his friend." This I can, with a mixture of pride and<br />
humility, say for myself.<br />
The memory of this moves me deeply now that he is<br />
dead, but is gloriously remembered by me as he goes to his<br />
burial amid the sorrow, and pride, and thanks, of all of you<br />
who stand and feel for yourselves and for so many millions.<br />
Many of you will not need to be reminded, but some,<br />
the younger among you, the inheritors of his master-strokes<br />
for freedom, may be glad to be told that your country, and mine,<br />
and all the free countries of the world, stood at the very<br />
gates of destiny in 191+ 0 and 194+ 1, when thu Nazi tyranny<br />
threatened to engulf us, and when there was no " second front"<br />
except our own. This was the great crucial moment of modern history.<br />
' dhat was at stake was, not some theory of government but the<br />
whole and personal freedom of men and women and children. And<br />
the battle for them was a battle against great odds, That<br />
* battle had to be won not only in the air and on the sea and in<br />
the field, but in the hearts and minds of ordinary people with<br />
a deep capacity for horoism,<br />
It was then that Winston Churchill was called, by<br />
Almighty God, as our faith makes us believe, to stand as our<br />
leader and our inspirer.<br />
There were, in 194+ o, defeatists who felt that<br />
prudence required submission or such terms as might be had.<br />
There were others who, while not accepting the inevitability<br />
of defeat, thought that victory was impossible. Winston Churchill<br />
* a0./ 2 </p>
<p>2-<br />
scorned to fall into either category, and he was right. *. U-ith<br />
courage, and matchless eloquence, and hUman understanding, he<br />
inspired us and led us to victbry,<br />
In the whole of' recorded modern history this was, I<br />
believe the one odcasion when one mani with one soaring<br />
imaginahion, with one fire burning in him, and with one unrivalled<br />
capacity for conveying it to others, won a crucial victory not<br />
only for the forces ( for there were many heroes in those days)<br />
but for the very spirit of human freedom. And so, on this great<br />
day, we thank him, and we thank God for him.<br />
. There are two other things I want to say to you, on<br />
a day which neither you nor I will ever willingly forget.<br />
One is that Winston Churchill was not an institution,<br />
but a man a man of wit and chuckling humour, and penetrating<br />
understanding, not a man who spoke to us as from the mountain<br />
tops, but one who expressed the simple and enduring feelings of<br />
or~ dinary men and women. 1t was because he was a great Englishman<br />
that he was able to speak for the English people. It was because<br />
he was a great human being that, in our dark-, st days, he lit the<br />
lamps of hope at many firesides and released so many from the<br />
chains of despair, There has been nobody like him in our lifetimes.<br />
We must, and do, thank God for him, and strive to be worthy of<br />
his example. And the second thing I will never forget is this.<br />
Winston Churchill's iw-ife is with us here in London, a great and<br />
gracious lady in her own right. Could I today send her your<br />
love, and mine? She has suffered an irreparable personal loss.<br />
But she has proud and enduring memories, happy memories, I venture<br />
to say&amp; We share her sorrow, but I know that she would wis i us<br />
to share with her those rich remembrances which the thought of<br />
the great man evokes.<br />
There have been, in the course of recorded history,<br />
some men of power who have cast shadows across the world.<br />
Winston Chiurchill, on the contrary, was a fountain of light and of<br />
hope. As I end my talk to you from the crypt of St. Paul's,<br />
with its reminders of Nelson and "! ellington, those marvellous<br />
defenders of long ago, the body of Winston Churchill goes in<br />
procession through the streets of London, hi London, our Lo'ndon,<br />
this most historic city, this ancient home of freedom, this<br />
place thr~ ough which, in the very devastation and fire of war,<br />
his tojcde rang with courage, and defiance, and hope, and rugged<br />
confidence, His body will be carried on the Thames, a river<br />
full of history. WIith one heart we all feel, with one mind we all<br />
acknowledge, that it will never have borne a more precious burden,<br />
or been enriched by more splendid memories. </p>
