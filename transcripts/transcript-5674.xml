ELECTORATE TALK<br />
A peacekeeping force in the Sinai is an essential part of the<br />
Egypt/ Israel peace treaty. This treaty, which requires Israel.<br />
to move out of the Sinai Peninsula completely by next April was<br />
chieved after 30 years of unremitting bitterness and fighting<br />
between the two countries. In view of the distrust-which 30 years<br />
of enmity has inevitably bred, it is not surprising that the<br />
two countries, at the time when they made the peace treaty,<br />
admitted that a peacekeeping force would be necessary to make<br />
the treaty work. And let me emphasise that it is a peacekeeping<br />
force not a fighting force but a group of military personnel<br />
who will be there to observe and monitor the implementation of<br />
the peace accords by the parties who have themselves made the peace.<br />
SThe difficulty of making the treaty work has been made greater by<br />
the assassination of President Sadat but his successor is determined<br />
by pursue the same peace policy. In their search for a more<br />
permanent peace, Egypt and Israel both want a peacekeeping force<br />
to be established and they both want Australia to be part of iLt,<br />
A United Nations sponsored peacekeeping force would obviously be<br />
the best option and I do not believe that anyone would have opposed<br />
Australia playing a part if a U. N. force had been possible. B3ut<br />
the fact is that a U. N. sponsored force is simply not an option.<br />
The Soviet Union would have vetoed it as they vetoed the continuation<br />
of an earlier peacekeeping force in 1979. We cannot allow the<br />
Soviet Union to veto genuine peacekeeping efforts around the<br />
world. The possibility that the United Nations might be prevented from<br />
lending its weight to the establishment of a peacekeeping force<br />
was foreseen at the time of the peace treaty and that is why -there<br />
was provision in the peace treaty accords for the United States,<br />
whose President had played a key role in the achievement of the<br />
treaty, to take steps to establish a peacekeeping force if the<br />
United Nations did not do so.<br />
The Middle East is a region of vast strategic significance for<br />
Australia as it is for the whole world. It is a volatile region<br />
and no other peace proposals apart from those which came out of<br />
Camp David have ever got off the ground. The Camp David accords<br />
are not a solution to all the problems of the Middle East but it<br />
is surely absurd to imagine that one single package solution could<br />
ever be found to all those problems. </p>
<p>There is no concrete plan for peace, other than the Camp David<br />
accords anywhfere on the horizon. And the fact that there is<br />
every reason to suppose that the Egyptian/ Israeli peace treaty<br />
will break down without the establishment of the currently<br />
proposed peacekeeping force, surely means that this peacekeeping<br />
force should be established to undertake its monitoring role.<br />
The question of whether Australia should participate was under<br />
active consideration by the Government for months because ther-e<br />
were weighty considerations on both sides of the balance, but.<br />
I have no doubt that the decision that Australia is willing toparticipate<br />
on the terms which I announced in the Parliament laSt<br />
Thursday is right for Australia, and for the cause of peace.<br />
This decision means that we will participate if Canada and<br />
Britain participate,-although the Government is hopeful that<br />
other European countries, some of which are apparently reconsidering<br />
Ktheir po ' sitions, might equally take part. The decision also means<br />
that the extent and duration of Australia's commitment will be<br />
defined., n advance and this gets rid of the fear which some people<br />
have expressed about an open-ended commitment. The decision also<br />
means that the Australian commander would retain the ultimate<br />
right-to consult with Australian authorities before complying wit~ h<br />
orders which he believed were inconsistent with the agreed<br />
purposes of the force. No part of the peacekeeping force would<br />
have any association with the U. S. rapid deployment force and our<br />
participation would obviously be conditional on continued support<br />
for the peace treaty from Egypt and Israel.<br />
The decision we have made therefore protects Australia's interests.<br />
It provides the greatest possible security for Australian personnel<br />
and its terms are such that every significant barrier that was<br />
seen in tho way of Australian involvement in the peacekeeping<br />
force is avoided.<br />
It is not good enough for those who seek peace to sit back and<br />
leave it to others to achieve. The history of our own century<br />
shows all too plainly that when that passive course is adopted<br />
peace goes by default and the world can fall into war.<br />
So when people ask the question " Why Australia?", the very<br />
simple answer is because we are concerned for peace. It is my<br />
hope that it will not be long before the peacekeeping force is<br />
established so that it can start its work and thus help advance<br />
the cause of peace in the Middle East.<br />
