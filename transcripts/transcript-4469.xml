STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER r-CST-AS3EA* 1 T'ALl" S 17 AUCUST 19177<br />
rnr Speaker, in 1967 Indonesia, Malaysia, othe Philippines, Singapore<br />
and Thailand met and established the association of South East Asian<br />
nations. The principal aims of the association, set forth in the<br />
ASEAN Declaration signed in Bangkok on 8t(-h August, 1967, are to<br />
accelerate the region's economic growth, social progress and cultural<br />
development, and to promote regional peace and stability.<br />
The leaders of the five ASEAN nations undertook to promote active<br />
collaboration and mutual assistance in matters of common interest<br />
in economic, social, cultural, technical and administrative fields.<br />
This undertaking was reaffirmed in the Declaration of ASEAN concord<br />
issued at the end of the first ASEAN Summit Conference held in Bali<br />
last year.<br />
ASEAN leaders recognise that only through interdependence and self--<br />
reliance will they secure peace and stability in the region.<br />
And they have concerted their einLergies to establish the region as<br />
a force for stability and concord.<br />
The five countries have made a significant effort to develop friendly<br />
relations with their neighbours as well as to accommodate the changirng<br />
pattern of involvement of the major powers in South East Asia.<br />
The ASEAN countries have firmly held that ASEAN is not, and should not<br />
be, a security organisation or military pact. Increasingly their<br />
concern has been with the problems of economic development.<br />
This reflects their clear recognition of the very close connection<br />
between economic development and social and political stability.<br />
Coinciding with ASEAN's tenth anniversary, Australia together with<br />
New Zealand and japan received an invitation to meet with the Heads<br />
of Government of ASEAN in Kuala Lumpur on August 6 and 7.<br />
The occasion was of significance: it was only the second time in<br />
which the five leaders had met together and the first at which any<br />
leader of another country had been invited to meet with the five<br />
ASEAN Heads of Government as a group.<br />
The meetings with the ASEAN Heads of Government were of the greatest<br />
value in furthering the strong and friendly ties that have linked<br />
Australia with these five countries for more than three decades.<br />
The meeting demonstrated, at the highest level, our mutual desire<br />
to enhance Australian/ ASEAN co-operation.<br />
Mr. Speaker, Australia strongly supports ASEAN's objective of preventing<br />
domination of the region by any major power and we have a significant<br />
interest in helping to ensure that ASEAN succeeds in its efforts to<br />
generate the economic grow-th and political stability for which it<br />
is striving.<br />
Our relationship with ASEAN is one which will require continuing and.<br />
special attention. </p>
<p>The opportunities which the Kuala Lumoir meeting provided to<br />
discuss policies in an open and direct manner have made many of our<br />
policies better understood, particularly those relating to our<br />
economic and trading positions. 0<br />
The opening meeting between the leaders of the five ASEAN countries,<br />
Japan, New Zealand and myself afforded a useful opportunity for us<br />
to make contact as a group and to exchange views on matters of<br />
common regional concern.<br />
At Australia's suggestion, world economic trends and their implications<br />
for the region were discussed. Matters which were raised included our<br />
common problems of inflation, economic recovery and international<br />
trade.<br />
The good will between the eight countries was most evident. This<br />
good will has the most important long-term implications for the<br />
development of a framework of co-operative, imaginative<br />
and mutually beneficial relations between the countries of ASEAN and<br />
their neighbours.<br />
The meeting the following day between myself and the five ASEAN<br />
Heads of Government was particularly successful and significant.<br />
It established strong foundations for the further development of<br />
relations between Australia and ASEAN.<br />
The ASEAN Heads cf Government raised the question of our trade and<br />
they expressed the strong wish ho'increase their share of trade with<br />
Australia. I emphasised that the balance of trade with ASEAN countries<br />
has moved relatively in ASEAN's'favour since 1970/ 71 from a ratio<br />
of 3.4 1 to 2: 1. The growth rate of imports to Australia<br />
from ASEAN over the last five years has averaged 30 per year and<br />
because of import competition and changing demand patterns, employment<br />
in the Australian T-extiles, Clothing and Footwear industries has<br />
declined from about 160,000 in 1971, to less than 120,000 today.<br />
Given the short term economic difficulties Australia has experienced<br />
over the past few years, there is little prospect of imports<br />
from ASEAN continuing to grow at the rapid rate of the last five<br />
years at the further expense of Australian industry. There will be further<br />
pportanities for ASEAN ' s exports to Australia to increase . wen the eccnomic and<br />
enplovment situation in Australia improves. I believe the ASEAN countries understand<br />
this. And there are opportunities for ASEAN's exports to Australia<br />
to expand by competing with other countries that export to Australia.<br />
ASEAN enjoys only a small share of Australia's imports of textiles<br />
apparel and footwear under 10% of the value of such imports from<br />
Korea, China, Hong Kong and Taiwan combined, and clearly there is<br />
room for improvement in this share.<br />
In discussing the desirability of increasing ASEAN's share of the<br />
Australian import market, it was agreed that an annual ASEAN trade<br />
fair sponsored by Australia and ASEAN, be held in one or other of the State<br />
capitals. The first of these fairs will be held in 1978.<br />
I also emphasised that ASEAN trade opportunities in the Australian<br />
market were heavily dependent on Australia's access to other markets<br />
particularly the E. E. C. for Australia's agricultural products. </p>
<p>Australia's experience -in endeavouring to obtain access to European<br />
markets has. been far from satisfactGory. Many of our agricultural<br />
products have been utterly exc: luded from the E. E. C. by hugh iniport<br />
levies. In 1960, our exports to members of the E. E. C. accounted for<br />
per cent of our totalJ exo~ orts. Now tha: t proportion has been<br />
reduced to 14.8 to a signi~ icant extent because of the rez-trictive<br />
policies of the E. E. C. To make matters worse, artifically stimulated<br />
domestic surpluses in the E. E. C. are being exported subjectL-to<br />
subsidies which frequently change and are often quite exorbitant<br />
disrupting our other traditional markets around the world.<br />
A rcx; ent example is the E. E. C. si-b-sidy or " restitution" on malt.<br />
As from November, the subsidy will increase by more than 30%. And<br />
this arbitrary rise could have very damaging effects on the Australian<br />
malt industry.<br />
The ASEAN members and Australia noted their common interests as<br />
commodity producers.<br />
We expressed our joint concern at the decline in recent years of<br />
the terms of trade against commodity producers and the difficulties<br />
sharp fluctuations in commodity prices have caused producers.<br />
The role Australia has played in commodity agreements for stabilising<br />
world trade was raised and we expressed our support for the concept<br />
of a common fund for commodity trade.<br />
The ASEAN leaders also welcomed the initiative Australia had taken<br />
at the June Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in establishing<br />
a Commonwealth task force to consider the part a common fund would<br />
play in commodity price stabilisation.<br />
The ASEAN leaders expressed the hope that the adoption of complementary<br />
trade policies would benefit both ASEAN and Australia. In this<br />
respect they indicated their desire to increase their own<br />
imports from Australia.<br />
There has been some speculation in the press about discriminatory<br />
measures against Australian imports continuing to be applied. I<br />
was assured by the Malaysian Trade Minister, in the presence of the<br />
Malaysian Prime Minister, that discriminatory impediments in the way<br />
of the development of that trade had been removed. The Government<br />
attaches considerable importance to that assurance.<br />
In order that we might discuss mutual trade problems before they<br />
become difficult or acute, I suggested that ASEAN and Australia should<br />
establish better arrangements for consultation on trade matters.<br />
The precise form such consultative machinery might take is still<br />
to be determined. We want arrangements which will be responsive<br />
and can be activated quickly by either side. Our objective is to<br />
have a forum for discussion and identification of problems in all<br />
aspects of trade between us. It was agreed that our foreign ministers<br />
should make appropriate proposals to our respective governments<br />
at the earliest opportunity so that the proposed new arrangements can<br />
be established.<br />
In looking at ways in which we could promote closer economic<br />
cooperation, we agreed on the need to establish a sound basis of<br />
knowledge from which a long term economic relationship between ASEAN<br />
and Australia would be developed. </p>
<p>4-.<br />
To that end we proposed and will finance a joint ASEAN/ Australia<br />
research project, its success will require a major mutual effort0<br />
It is envisaged that it will -take the form of an independent research<br />
team in each of our six countries worki ng together and assembling<br />
cooperatively the basic material, ideas and proposals for greater<br />
cooperationa. It will not be expected to bring quick results. But it will give us<br />
a reliable foundation on which to build a long term economic relationship<br />
Another matter which was raised was the basis upon which Australian<br />
import quotas are issued. A rev7' iew Of the principles involved has now been<br />
undertakzen and details will be announced shortly.<br />
At the post ASEAN talks Australia also announced a significant<br />
expansion in the size of Australia's aid programme to ASEAN countries,<br />
and several measures aimed at improving its quality. These proposals<br />
are indicative of our positive interest in the economic development<br />
of the region.<br />
They can be briefly summarised. Australia will contribute an<br />
additional $ 10 million to the ASEAN/ Australia economic cooperative<br />
programme. We have increased our forward commitment for total<br />
bilateral aid to the five ASEAN countries by $ 90 million to $ 250<br />
million. In order to improve the quality of our aid we will untie<br />
it further to allow increased procurcment cf materials and equipment<br />
from within the ASEAN region. We wili also fund some local<br />
costs and enter into co-financing arrangements with international<br />
organisations, where this is considered appropriate by the recipient<br />
country.<br />
The ASEAN leaders sought Australian assistance in developing five<br />
industrial projects which ASEAN is promoting, and the Australian<br />
Government confirmed that it would contribute to those projects<br />
within our available resources and capacities as the projects become<br />
more clearly defined. It is envisaged that our assistance will<br />
take the form of feasibility studies, technical training, design<br />
and construction work, and possibly assistance in the development<br />
of infrastructure. Discussions at official level will be held about<br />
the five industrial projects when appropriate.<br />
The ASEAN leaders were also interested in our policy on Australian<br />
investment overseas. I indicated that the Australian Government<br />
welcomed investment overseas where this contributed to the economic<br />
and social development of the countries concerned, but at the present time we<br />
would have difficulties with investment which involved little more than<br />
the transfer of operations to other countries with a consequent<br />
loss of jobs in Australia. Because of our willingness to encourage<br />
Australian investment in the ASEAN countries, an ASEAN suggestion<br />
that we sponsor an ASEAN/ Australia investment seminar was accepted.<br />
It is envisaged that this will be a major seminar based on the<br />
experience of one which was held most successfully earlier this<br />
year between the European community and ASEAN.<br />
Whilst in Kuala Lumpur I also had the opportunity of having<br />
particularly useful talks with the Prime Minister of Japan,<br />
Mr. Fukuda. A number of matters of significance in our bilateral<br />
relationship were discussed, including the importance Australia<br />
attaches to stability in trade. </p>
<p>Australia seeks predictable and growing access to the Japanese<br />
market for agricultural products on a stable basis. As to Australian<br />
beef exports to Japan, I pointed out to the Japanese Prime MLinister<br />
that the present arrangement of negotiating beef quotas every six<br />
months was disruptive to the beef industry's ability to operate<br />
effectively. It should be possible to devise a system which<br />
both affoids reasonable prc~ tection to the Japanese beef industry<br />
and gives more predictable and stable access to the Japanese market.<br />
Mr. Fukuda agreed that our officials should work together closely<br />
to devise a system which would better serve the needs of stability.<br />
our officials are expected to meet shortly in Japan to consider<br />
various alternatives including, for exairple, a fixed base quota<br />
together with a growth factor related, say, to beef consumption in<br />
Japan.<br />
The current state of negotiations on the long term sugar contract<br />
was also raised. I stressed that the security of long term<br />
contracts as bankable documents should not be compromised in any<br />
way. The Government's strong support for the generality of the<br />
case put by CSR to the Japanese refineries and the Government's<br />
belief that CSR had made concessions enough was also emphasised.<br />
Any concessions made up to 1980 ( when the contract expires) would<br />
need to be compensated for by some arrangement after 1980 covering<br />
both price and tonnage. It is the strong desire of the Australian<br />
Government and, Mr. Fukuda indicated, of the Japanese Government<br />
also, that the commercial parties resume meaningful negotiations<br />
and arrive at a prompt and mutually beneficial solution. It is<br />
in the interests of all concerned that the negotiations be brought<br />
to resolution as quickly as possible.<br />
During the three days of discussions, the Philippines and Japan<br />
both raised the subject of uranium with me. Both stressed the<br />
importance of nuclear power to meet their future energy needs and<br />
expressed the hope that Australia would be a future supplier of<br />
uranium to them. They were informed that the Government's decision<br />
on this issue would be taken shortly and that their representations<br />
would be taken into account in reaching that decision.<br />
The ASEAN leaders warmly welcomed the initiatives Australia had<br />
taken and all our discussions were both constructive and helpful.<br />
The ASEAN leaders are playing a positive and progressive role in<br />
the development of our region.<br />
I am confident that as part of this process ASEAN will strengthen<br />
and extend its relations with Australia and other countries.<br />
Australia is concerned to promote the totality of its relationship<br />
With ASEAN. The measures agreed at Kuala Lumpur will add<br />
significantly to this.<br />
Mr. Speaker, I request leave to table the joint statement issued<br />
at the end of my meeting with the ASEAN leaders.<br />
