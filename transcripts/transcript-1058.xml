P13ESS, R~ ADIO AND TELEVISION CONFERENCE<br />
GIVEN BY THEl PRIME MINISTER THE RT. HON.<br />
SIR ROBERT MENZIES, AT CANB RRA ON<br />
THURSDAY, 11TH FEBRUARY, 1995<br />
PRIME MINISTER Gentlemen, the spectacle of all these microphones<br />
and of all you people suggests to me that I am here under<br />
false pretences, because I want to make it clear at the<br />
outset that this is not one of' those cases where I went<br />
abroad conducting negotiations or discussions about which<br />
something may usefully be said later on, I was on a holiday<br />
and, I assure you, not reading any cables or doing aiay work,,<br />
For the first time since I became Prime Minister, I was hoping<br />
to escape these matters for a time. However, I interrupt * ed.<br />
that and went to London where I had two or three discussions<br />
about which I spoke in London to the Australian Press just<br />
before I left there. So really, I have no great matters t9<br />
report. There are some problems inside Australia about which<br />
I have been trying to learn something in the last twenty-, four<br />
hours, but I don't profess to be a master of them by a long<br />
Mt. and I believe there are certain:<br />
questions you hawe in mind about Malaysia. Well, I have ' done<br />
my best in the last twenty-four hour s to catch up, but one<br />
doesn't entirely catch up the events of a month in twenty-four<br />
hours. At least I can't. Now are there any questions you<br />
would like to put to me?<br />
Q6 There was one report from London, Sir that the British<br />
Government had put pressure upon you to send troops into<br />
Borneo. Is that correct?<br />
A, I didn't even see the report.<br />
Q# Well, it was published.<br />
A. What happened on that matter was that this was being<br />
debated in Australia I mean not debated thrashed out in<br />
Australia in consultation with the authorities in Malaysia,<br />
and when I was in London I received wiord as to what the<br />
availability of' the forces was and what my colleagues here<br />
thought about it. What happened then, was that I conveyed<br />
that to the Prime Minister of Great Britain. There was no<br />
pressure by him. He received the information with great<br />
pleasure,<br />
Q. Sir Robert, what will happen now with the Mt. Isa<br />
dispute? dIhere do you go from here?<br />
A, Where do I go?<br />
Q9 What happens from now?<br />
A* Let us understand that the Mt. Isa dispute is a local<br />
dispute. I know it has immense national consequences of a<br />
disastrous kind but it is, in the strict sense, a local<br />
dispute within the jurisdiction of the Government of Queensland<br />
and the Parliament of Queensland and, so far, matters<br />
have been dealt with by the industrial machinery set up by<br />
Queensland in Queensland. We, literally, have no jurisdiction<br />
in an industrial sense over this matter which ion't interstate.<br />
This is rather more important than appears to have been<br />
realised. A problem may be, as this one is, of very great<br />
national significance tremendous national significance, but<br />
it doesn't follow that the Government of the nation can deal<br />
with it, itself, because we do live in a Federal community / 2 </p>
<p>-2<br />
P. M. and this is one of the awkward things about it. I have been<br />
( CONT.) in touch with the acting Premier of Queensland and I have<br />
told him that if at any time I can be of any help on this<br />
matter I will be not only willing but eager to help, But<br />
what has happened there as I understand it is that the<br />
processes of arbitration have been invoked, awards have been<br />
made, the dispute has been rlc.. x narrowed down almost to a<br />
personal one about this man, Mack. i'e. It seems an extraordinary<br />
state of affairs to bring to a h. tthe greatest copper mine<br />
in Australia, and perhaps becomJir,.: g onie of the greatest in<br />
the icrld, I woul~ d like to thlik that the people concerned<br />
in this mattver were really thlnking about its significance.<br />
I say this not because I am going to crash my way in without<br />
authority in a difficult matter of this kind, but I wonder<br />
if they have all given thought to this that, first of all,<br />
this is really an attack on arbitration. That's quite clear,<br />
and this is an old battle in Australia and it has had to be<br />
fought more than once. We, in AustroUiag believe in industrial<br />
arbitration and the people who are employed in Australia have<br />
a great deal to thank arbitration for. It would be a<br />
tragedy if it were destroyed or even seriously damaged in a<br />
struggle of this kind.<br />
But even more importantly, here is a mine which<br />
contributes and would normally continue to contribute very<br />
great wealth to the country in its international trade, in<br />
its internal economy. One has only to look back over negotiations<br />
that occurred about the railway line from Mt. Isa, with<br />
the many millions that the Commonwealth itself was able to<br />
find for that enterprise, the whole thing being predicated on<br />
a steady increase in the through-put of the Mt, Isa minei<br />
One of the greatest strokes in northern development for a<br />
long, long time, and here is a crippling blow delivered to<br />
it, and delivered innocently in a misguided way by the very<br />
people who have everything to gain by northern development<br />
and by living in a prosperous community.<br />
So that here you have this crippling blow, because it is<br />
one, first of all, to a lot of families living in their homes<br />
in Mt. Isa I have been there myself on one or two occasions<br />
and was tremendously impressed by the fact that here was a<br />
community-this is a crippling blow to themselves; this is,<br />
in hum~ an terms a terrible thing. Then it is a crippling<br />
blow to a great Australian industry, and then in the broad<br />
national sense it is a crippling blow to the whole development<br />
of the north because, let it be remembered, you can't develop<br />
the north of Australia, particularly in the mineral fields<br />
in which there are such enormous possibilities, without<br />
attracting the investment of capital, enterprise, having<br />
people take risks and if they think that their enterprise<br />
can be snuffed oui at short notice by one? one curious<br />
character not even an Australian, I believe this is a<br />
terrible thing.<br />
And I would like so far as I can, to appeal to all<br />
those concerned to realise that they are not just dealing<br />
with a little local dispute about one man but what is<br />
involved in this is all the significance that I have just<br />
been trying to describe. However at this stage this is all<br />
I can do. Mr. Hiley has been good enough to tell me that<br />
if any development occurred on which he thinks my own<br />
influence can be of help, then he will tell me and I have<br />
indicated that I will be willing at all times o help.<br />
I attach enormous importance to this, but I dontt think / 3 </p>
<p>-3<br />
P. M. anything is served by brandishing non-existent weapons. Our<br />
( CJontd.) powers so far as I know; I have had no chance to have<br />
consultations with the Law Department but so far as I know,<br />
our powers on this matter are, for all practical purposes,<br />
non-existent.<br />
Q. Sir Robert, this is very far removed from Mt. Isa.<br />
I wondter if I could get a comment on this from you. Do you<br />
regard the situation between Communist China and Russia, as<br />
it stands now in the political situation of the world, as-a<br />
safety valve for the rest of the free world?<br />
At I don*' t think anybody can answer that question because,<br />
so far as I can gather, and I am gathering up at pretty short<br />
notice, don't forget, and therefore I must be a little<br />
discreet but so far as I can make out the recent contacts<br />
between the Prime Minister of the Soviei Union and the<br />
Chinese authorities gave rise to some suggestion that there<br />
might be a little watering-down of the troubles that arose<br />
between the Soviet and China in the days of Khrushchev,<br />
because we all know there was more than a little difference<br />
between them. Whether this indicates that those differences<br />
are being lessened or not I don't know, but 1 can't help<br />
feeling that they are pro~ ty profound differences differences<br />
of outlook, and that so long as this tension continues, it...<br />
well, it all depends on the point of view I think it is not<br />
a bad thing for the world, I have heard people say, philosophically<br />
that<br />
I have heard this all over the world. It is the thing<br />
that is asked everywhere. What are your vievis?<br />
Aq Well, that's my view. In a realistic fashion, I dont<br />
think it's too bad having two people like that disputing<br />
with each other, disagreeing with each other,<br />
0Q. 0 Could we go back to Malaysia for a minute, Sir?<br />
A, We haven't been there before. ( Laughter)<br />
Q. Mr. Calwell has accused your Government of allowing what<br />
he calls a haphazard drift into war with Indonesia, Sir Robert.<br />
Do you think that is a fair comment?<br />
A. No, I don'tt but still I realise that Mr. Calwell has<br />
his weekly chore to perform and I don't mind. " Allow it to<br />
drift What he is getting at, I sup-., ose is that<br />
we are inert or something like that on the diplomatic front<br />
and that we are thinking solely in terms of military activity.<br />
This, of course, is not right. We are constantly diplomatically<br />
active in Djakarta and we have constantly endeavoured to<br />
produce some peace in this part of the world, but you can't<br />
get away from this that the cause of all this trouble is that<br />
the Indonesians are shooting. Vhen they give up shooting<br />
people, to give effect to whatever their claims may be, then,<br />
of course, there will be plenty of room for negotiation. I<br />
have said repeatedly we have to live with Indonesia for<br />
hundreds of years and I am the last one to want to create some<br />
sort of inevitable hostility, or some long-standing hostility<br />
between Australia and Indonesia. We want nothing better than<br />
sound and good relations, but the fact is that Indonesia is<br />
the aggressor, without warrant, against a neighbour. 0. 0 .1/ 1 </p>
<p>Q Mro Prime Minister, is it still the view of the<br />
Government we having decided to send troops into Borneo, an<br />
attack by indonesia on them would be an attack within the<br />
terms of' the ANZUS pact? Sir Garfield Barwick raised this<br />
issue about a year ago.<br />
A* Now, look I rather deplore this business about the<br />
ANZUS pact. 1 made a statement about the ANZUS pact in<br />
Parliament I thought somebody might ask this. When was it?<br />
They don't even put the date on Hansard now....., 2lst April<br />
1961+, page 1280. There I said categorically what the position<br />
was, as we understood i, under the ANZUS pact and I was able<br />
later on to say that that interpretation was entirely acceptable<br />
by the United Otates. Now, I have nothing to add to that.<br />
We have no dispute or difference with the United States about<br />
the ANZJS pact. I attach supreme importance to it.<br />
Q6 I was going to ask you, Sir, what were the limitations<br />
in the role of' these Australian troops in Borneo. Presumably<br />
they can only go into action in a defensive role on Malaysian<br />
territory.<br />
A, Well, they will be under the command of' the military<br />
people and will no doubt co-operate according to the military<br />
plans. Itm not privy to them at the moment. I can't answer<br />
that question. They will do well, wherever they are.<br />
Q. Sir, will the growing intensity of' the Vietnam struggle<br />
mean a deeper involvement for Australia?<br />
A9 This is a good question. Perhaps it is to be answered<br />
in a somewhat different way from the one you had in mind.<br />
The Vietnam struggle an immfensely difficult one and made<br />
all the more difficult because of the serious political<br />
instability in South Vietnam, seems to me to be associated<br />
with all these other matters, it all tends to become part of<br />
a pattern. The intensification of fighting in South Vietnam<br />
is bound to increase the United States' efforts in that area<br />
because they have made it clear that they intend to remain.<br />
We are profoundly involved in this for a variety of reasons,<br />
one of course, being that we are parties to SEATO, South<br />
Vietnam being one of the protocol States; that the viabilityto<br />
use the blessed word of some of the other South-East<br />
Asian countries will be seriously affected if South Vietnam<br />
falls to the Communists; these things are all inter-acting<br />
or will inter-act one with the other.<br />
Perhaps I ought to say this. I had occasion to point<br />
out in London that we have not only one or two, but perhaps<br />
three or four or five particular interests and responsibilities<br />
in this part of the world, all of which affect defence, One,<br />
of course, is our own self-defence which we dontt see as a<br />
coastal defence but as a defence if possible, in depth, but<br />
it is our own defence and the def'ence of New Guinea and Papua,<br />
our side of New Guinea. In the second place, we have our<br />
old associations with Great Britain and New Zealand in what<br />
has been called ANZAM, which is a planning body. In the third<br />
place, we are partners in SEATO, and SEATO, of course, being<br />
devised as a screen against communist * ggression, gives rise<br />
to contingent liabilities if I may put them in that way. And<br />
under SEATO South Vietnam being a protocol State, we have<br />
come in at their request with modest forces into South Vietnam.<br />
We have the ANZUS pact with the United States and with New<br />
Zealand and in the case of Malaysia we have a unilateral<br />
obligation arising from the statement I made in Parliament. 0* 000../ </p>
<p>P. M. So that we have five aspects of this problem, New Zealand has<br />
( Contd.) four, Nobody else has five. We have a variety of interests<br />
and responsibilities and that is why it is one of the things<br />
I took the opportunRay of discussing with Mr, Wilson and some<br />
of his Ministers in London. I took the opportunity of discussing<br />
with them ways and means of reconciling the views from<br />
time to time not that I contemplate their differing but<br />
reconciling them, getting some order of priority as between<br />
Great Britain, the United States, New Zealand and ourselves,<br />
because there will arise times when you must balance an<br />
actuality like the fighting in and around Malaysia with a<br />
contingency such as obligations that might arise under SEATO.<br />
Q9 There have been some criticisms, Sir, of the Senate<br />
voting system following the long drawn-out poll result.<br />
Is it likely that the Government will review it?<br />
A, I hope you won't use it against me if I say that I<br />
have never professed perfectly to understand how they count<br />
the votes in the Senate. It has always been one of those<br />
murky mysteries to me which I leave to the fellows with the<br />
computersb But, yes, I think the system of voting for the<br />
Senate needs looking at. With great respect to my colleague,<br />
Senator Hannan whose defeat I regret, who advocates a<br />
circular ballot paper, I would never become enraptured about<br />
a circular ballot paper. It is hard enough now when you hold<br />
the thing upright and you try to put the numbers in the right<br />
squares, but if you have to whiz it round, it will. be what the<br />
French call " folio circulaire".<br />
Q. We can take it, Sir, that this matter will be examined?<br />
A, Yes, it will.<br />
Q. Sir Robert, on the score of the Senate, how do you<br />
feel about the future that a deadlock will arise in the Senate?<br />
A, I have had it before, not long ago. It is not keeping<br />
me awake, at nights. Let's put it that way.<br />
Q9 Sir Robert, it has been mentioned in the Press that we<br />
will pay the money owing on the arms deal being conducted in<br />
the United States, that in the first three years or so we will<br />
pay in cash. Have you any knowledge at this time of how much<br />
that cash will be?<br />
A, Don't ask me. I know no more about it than you do.<br />
I read the communique first in a cable from Senator Paltridge<br />
and then in the newspapers, but I have had no time to<br />
ascertain these Treasury matters. There were Treasury<br />
people there.<br />
Q. There have been some suggestions, Sir that the Commonwealth<br />
Government will make a reasonably substantial grant<br />
to the Churchill Memorial Fund. Has any decision been made<br />
on that yet?<br />
As No, not actually, but I think it may be anticipated<br />
that we will.<br />
Q. Sir, is th:-rc anything you can tell us about the<br />
Commonwealth S,. cretariat? 5 e a 9 e / 6 </p>
<p>6-<br />
A, Well, tile officials had a meeting, as you know, in<br />
London and they made a report which I have only just glanced<br />
at because I got it when I was on my way to the funeral.<br />
I had a word with Mr. Wilson about it. I think that we both<br />
a greed it was undesirable to build up a sort of formidableexecutive<br />
body as if we were copying the Secretary-General! s<br />
business in the United Nations, and that this must be avoided.<br />
But on the whole, he is disposed to think that the report has<br />
the root of the matter in it. I offer no opinion on that<br />
except that I would like to see a Secretariat of the right<br />
kind. I don't want to see it become an executive body, nor<br />
do I want to see it become a body in which there are majority<br />
votes and minority movements and resolutions. That would<br />
give me the horrors. However, I have told him that on my<br />
return to Australia we would have a look at this report and<br />
offer him our own views in good time, that is to say, before<br />
the next Prime Minister's Conference.<br />
Q. Sir, when is it likely that you will be able to make<br />
a statement on the new Governor-General?<br />
A. I don't know. You see, I had no chance to have any<br />
discussion with The Queen. I made my bow to her on Saturday<br />
with a lot of other people and Her Majesty was off to<br />
Ethiopia on Monday. I haven't yet arrived in my own mind<br />
at any firm recommendation, so I can't say.<br />
Q. LnoMight the matter stand over, Sir, until you are in<br />
A. I don't know. I won't restrict myself on that matter.<br />
I might take this matter up by correspondence with Her<br />
Majesty or wait until I see her.<br />
Q6 Is it your inclination to recommend another<br />
Englishman or perhaps someone<br />
A, You will know exactly who the appointee is when<br />
The Queen announces it.<br />
Q. Sir Robert, can you tell us your reaction aboDut the<br />
High Court decision on the airlines case?<br />
A. My only reaction is that I even managed last night<br />
to read the judgments, a considerable achievement I think,<br />
and I found them very interesting, and that is all I have<br />
to say because my Law people are going to tell me on Tuesday.<br />
I'm just an ex-lawyer now, but I still think I know a bit<br />
about it.<br />
Q. There are one or two vacancies in Cabinet......<br />
A. We will announce those as soon as we can.<br />
Q. Any date yet for a conference on the airlines with<br />
Mr. Renshaw, Sir?<br />
A. Well, I don't know. I know that there was a<br />
communication between the Acting Prime Minister and Mr.<br />
Renshaw in which they appeared to agree that there would be<br />
a consultation. On what level, I don't know yet. Probably<br />
between Air Ministers and Transport Ministers Civil<br />
Aviation, I mean. a ./ 7 </p>
<p>-7<br />
Recent events in Asia have raised the prospect of<br />
a proliferation of nuclear weapons Chinese, the Indonesians,<br />
India having plutonium capabilities Can you tell us<br />
your thoughts on this prospect in this part of the world?<br />
At Well, I am one of the Prime Ministers who passed a<br />
resolution about this some years ago, urging that there be<br />
no such proliferation, that atomic weapons ought to be kept<br />
in as few hands as possible if possible, in the hands of<br />
the large powers who would have a sense of responsibility<br />
and that to scatter them would be very serious, and I still<br />
adhere to that view.<br />
Q. In regard to Vietnam, Sir, to return to it is it<br />
your understanding that the recent United States aitack<br />
in North Vietnam was a purely retaliatory one and does not<br />
represent any basic change in American policy towards<br />
My impression is that it was purely retaliatory,<br />
but then don't ask to speak to me as if I were an authority<br />
on the matter because I'm not. i'm really forming an<br />
opinion on something about which you probably know as much<br />
as I do.<br />
Q. Mr. Hasluck, commenting on that, Sir, said that the<br />
aggressor must stop or be stopped. Would you take that as<br />
a general statement of principle applying to all aggressors?<br />
A, Well, now, really. A nd then you will think of some<br />
particular case<br />
Q6 Yes indeed, Sir,<br />
A, You must save that one up. Mr. Hasluck was right<br />
all the same in what he said about this case, but that<br />
little curly one that you are thinking about you must tell<br />
me about privately.<br />
Q. Have you got any ideas, Sir, when we are going to<br />
see the Vernon Report?<br />
A, Oh, no. That is one of the many things I haven't<br />
asked about in the last twenty-four hours. </p>
