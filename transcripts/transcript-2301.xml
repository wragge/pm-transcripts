SIXTEENTH COMMONWEALTH PARLIAMENTARY CONFERENCE<br />
LUNCHEON AT PARLIAMENT HGUO3E, CANBERRI OCTOBER 1970<br />
Seechby the Prime Minister, Mr. john Gorton<br />
Mr Vice Chairman, , arliamentary Colleagues all<br />
It falls to my lot to propose the toast of our distinguished guests. Sir, it is<br />
my privilege today, both as Prime Minister and as a member of the Australian<br />
Branch I hope a financial member: to preside at this Luncheon in honour of<br />
Delegates to the Sixteenth Commonwealth Parliamentary Conference. We are glad<br />
to have you meeting here in Australia and here in our National Capital, and we are<br />
glad that you are meeting in Australia for the second time.<br />
I know that many of you came early to our country in order to have the chance<br />
to look around it a little before settling down to the business at the corference table.<br />
I hope you have found this time well spent, interesting and enjoyable. We indeed<br />
are glad that you took this opportunity to see us while you are here. But now you<br />
have business to do, and I see from the agenda that you will be discussing a wide<br />
variety of topics, ranging from co-operation in development to the challenge of<br />
dissent. This Commonwealth Parliamentary Association is unique. With 7, OC0 members<br />
and 80 branches, it's certainly representative, and it touches at some point or other<br />
through its members, its affiliated branches and its associated groups, just<br />
about every part of the free world. And I believe it serves two broad and im; ortant<br />
purposes. It provides continuing links between members of the Commonwealth of Nations,<br />
the greatest multi-racial association of free nations the world has known. And it seeks<br />
to preserve, for the world to see, the image of parliamentary democracy as we<br />
know it, and as we oractice it in varying degrees today.<br />
Let us look at this Commonwealth of Nations for a moment. It has emerged from<br />
an empire of dominions, of colonies under the Crown, an empire that has now passed<br />
down the corridors of history. And in place of that empire, there are free and<br />
independent nations, some owing allegiance to the Crown, some not, but all having<br />
inherited the principles of parliamentary rule, based on the Westminster model.<br />
Some have abandoned that model, others have abandoned it and returned to it,<br />
but whether it be a Westminster system or a Presidential system, the root is the<br />
same, and that is what is sought to be preserved by the members of this Association. / 2 </p>
<p>It would be unrealistic, Sir, to pretend that all is smooth sailing all the time<br />
amongst the members of the Common% ealth of Nations. It would be dull if that<br />
were so. No great historical development such as this can come to this point<br />
and see in front of it the future it can follow without there having bee-i some<br />
problems, some controversy, without there being able to be seen in the future<br />
other problems and other controversy. And I think the Commonwealth has still<br />
to find a way in the future through many problems. But the fact that it will fi-nd<br />
its way through those problems with success is, I believe, attested to by the<br />
evidence of the problems which it has already overcome in its existence so far.<br />
This Commonwealth Parliamentary Association is the Association that provides<br />
a strong and continuing link between the members of the Commonwealth. There<br />
are other links, of course, the Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conlerence,<br />
other Conferences of one kind or another, but the Parliamentary Association is<br />
the most representative because all of us, as members, are directly concerned<br />
in our varying ways with the practice of parliamentary democracy in our own<br />
Houses of Assembly, or Congresses or Senates or whatever the nomenclature<br />
may be. And that, I think, is one reason why the Association is growing in<br />
strength and that is why I hope it will have a long and a useful life, not only for its<br />
members but for the world as a whole.<br />
Now I mentioned a second purpose for the Association, and that was to<br />
preserve the image of parliamentary democracy before the world. And this, I<br />
think, is of immense importance today, perhaps of as great importance as we<br />
have ever known in history. All around the world in, I suspect, all the countries<br />
represented here, there is a clamour for dissent. Our. parliamentary systems<br />
and the rule of law they all have in trust are under test, in all our countries, and<br />
are on trial in many ways, particularly in the eyes of the younger generation.<br />
Let none of us be dismayed by this. Dissent, of itself, is not only not a bad<br />
thing but a good thing. It can be healthy. It can be part of the cleansing process<br />
in a democracy and in the institutions of a democracy, and our institutions I<br />
speak collectively not only allow it, but specifically provide for it. That is why<br />
in so many of our countries here represented, we have an official Cpposition,<br />
a free press, a ballot box. And that is why the Commonwealth Pad iamentary<br />
Association itself puts contentious measures on its agenda and delegates can<br />
speak with heat on this and disagreement on this, and dissent with each other<br />
on this, but each point of view is thereby heard.<br />
But in this goodness of dissent, however, and clamour for it, there can in all<br />
our countries be dangers. There are dangers that in searching for a change for<br />
the better, we may let the legitimate ways of bringing that about become<br />
illegitimate and fatally weaken our system. We should never forget that urbridled<br />
dissent on the part of Hitler's brownshirts led to the overthrow of the parliament<br />
in that country and the world into the bloodbath which followed. a a / 3 </p>
<p>I believe there is no better syst . n than parliamentary democracy. I think<br />
it is the only system which has validity, if we are going to speak of -man's right<br />
to be free and to choose for himself t he way of life he wants and who vwill direct<br />
those public affairs which so impinge upon the way oZ life he wants.<br />
There are many drawbacks to democracy, but I repeat -, It is the best<br />
method of obtaining these ends yet discovered.<br />
The laws which govern our lives are laws we all in our parliaments mk<br />
for ourselves. They are laws we can change in an orderly fashion by exactly<br />
the same process we used to bring them into existence. There are many vilo<br />
consider in one country or another that a law is a bad law, and that can be<br />
changed. There are in many countries good laws, in themselves, but laws whiich<br />
have become out of date. And they can be updated. But if we are to retain before<br />
the world, all of us, that image of parliamentary democracy of which I spokle,<br />
then changes of that kind must be made in a constitutional and parlia-mentary way.<br />
Dai -Yers arise as soon as we reject this course. And, indeed, on this*,-subject,<br />
that great parliamentarian, Edmund Burke, put it quite clearly two hu:Ã± idred<br />
years ago<br />
" The only liberty I mean is a liberty connected with order; that<br />
not only exists along with order and virtue, but which cannot exist<br />
at all without them.<br />
That was true then, that is true now for all who espouse parliamentary democracy.<br />
And that, because those gathered here today are throughout the world showing<br />
a method of government different from a totalitarian government, that is why I<br />
really meant it when I said it is a privilege for me today to welcome you to our<br />
country so that you can continue this great work. This, I think, is the spirit in<br />
which the Parliamentary Association meets, and it is, in that spirit that I welcome<br />
you all here and trust that your deliberations will further advance the cause.-<br />
of all those countries here gathered. </p>
