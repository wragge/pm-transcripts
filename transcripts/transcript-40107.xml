    <content><![CDATA[<p>Congratulations to Trent Zimmerman on becoming our newest member of Federal Parliament after winning the North Sydney by-election.</p>

<p>Trent and the Liberal team in North Sydney and NSW have worked hard to win the confidence of the local community and I have enjoyed campaigning with Trent over the last month.</p>

<p>Trent will serve the people of North Sydney with distinction, as did his predecessor Joe Hockey and I look forward to welcoming him to our party room.</p>
