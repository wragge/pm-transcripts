J AUST LA A L,<br />
FOR MEDIAFRIDAY, 18 DECEMBER 1981<br />
PREMIERS' CONFERENCE/ LOAN COUNCIL MEETING<br />
I have today sent an invitation to the Premiers and<br />
the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory to attend<br />
a meeting in Canberra towards the end of January to<br />
discuss a number of issues relating to the funding of<br />
power generation and other facilities by State<br />
Governments and their authorities.<br />
I indicated that the meeting would provide an<br />
opportunity to consider the reconendation made by<br />
the Campbell Committee concerning the borrowing<br />
arrangements of State authorities and to obtain<br />
the preliminary views of the States on other<br />
recommendations of the Campbell Report which bear<br />
directly on State responsibilities. </p>
