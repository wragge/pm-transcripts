PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF JOINT NEWS CONFERENCE WITH RABBIE NAMALIU,<br />
PRTY41R XTNTSTER OF PAPUA NEW GUINEA, TRAVELODGE HOTEL,<br />
PORT MORESBY 3 SEPTEMBER 1990<br />
E OE PROOF ONLY<br />
PM: Ok. Would you like to just start with the<br />
questions? Would you like any initial statement or just<br />
questions? JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, what did you mean in your speech<br />
today when you referred to the time is long past that<br />
Australian forces could act in an internal security role?<br />
You then qualified this by saying<br />
PM: Yes, I used three adjectives exceptional, agreed<br />
and limited I think.<br />
JOURNALIST; ( inaudible)<br />
PM: Yes. Taking the first part of it Milton, in preindepedence<br />
days of course Australian forces were used<br />
and I think there was some perception in the postindependence<br />
period that that sort of thing could happen.<br />
What I wanted to make ulear within that context of the<br />
general points I'd been making before that, was that<br />
people must absolutely understand the reality that when<br />
you're talking about the relations between Papua New<br />
Guinea and Australia you're talking about the relations<br />
between two sovereign and independent nations. Therefore<br />
when you're talking between two sovereign independent<br />
nations it is not normal to assume that the forces of one<br />
will go in and be involved in the internal security<br />
matters of the other. I wanted to make that absolutely<br />
clear. Now it is the case that, for instance the Prime<br />
Minister and I have talked about contingent situations<br />
where Australia's interests let's be precise, in<br />
Bougainville it was conceivable there that if things<br />
had developed in a way which was, y'know, very bad and<br />
that Australian lives could have been threatened or<br />
questions of hostages involved, that, and given the<br />
numbers of Australians there and also New Zealanders for<br />
instance talked to us about this, it was conceivable<br />
that we might have wanted to say to the Papua New Guinea<br />
Government, well there are circumstances there which,<br />
would you consider it appropriate that we should be<br />
involved for the very limited and agreed purposes of<br />
protecting the interests of a large number of<br />
Australians. Let me be quite specific about it in that<br />
context. But the important point Milton was that because </p>
<p>it is a relationship between two sovereign independent<br />
nations there was never any thought in my mind that I<br />
could just send Australian troops in there. It was<br />
something that I properly had to talk with the Prime<br />
Minister about and get a degree of understanding. That<br />
was the sort of thing I had in mind.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, you also said in your speech that<br />
you felt it was no longer appropriate for people to be<br />
suggesting that Australia should transfer large numbers<br />
of public servants and military advisors to help you<br />
and you say it's just not on? To whom in Papua New<br />
Guinea are you addressing those remarks?<br />
PM: It was not just to Papua New Guinea. You see, one<br />
of the things that's worried me about discussions about<br />
the relations between Papua New Guinea and Australia is<br />
not just within some areas of Papua New Guinea, and<br />
certainly in some areas of Australia, but when I find<br />
people in the region and some of our larger international<br />
friends, they're talking about this region as though<br />
independence hasn't taken place. I mean there is an<br />
unstated assumption in a lot of these areas that we still<br />
have some sort of almost colonial relationship. So in<br />
every respect it's important to be saying I wasn't<br />
talking just Papua New Guinea. I mean that address<br />
was directed to a broad audience as well.<br />
JOURaNALIST: General Benny Murdani was allegedly saying<br />
to Dr Hewson that Australia might have to play a role in<br />
Papua New Guinea. Is that the sort of person you're<br />
talking about? 1<br />
PH: No. Let me say that in regard to those people,<br />
those two participants in that dialogue, it was a<br />
dialogue of the knowledgable and the unknowledgable.<br />
General Murdani does know a good deal about the situation<br />
on the broader and in particular in relations of the two<br />
countries in general. The Leader of the opposition has<br />
an amazing learning curve when it comes to matters<br />
regional and international. As far as Indonesia is<br />
concerned, let me say this, that I believe that the<br />
relations between Indonesia and Papua New Guinea are<br />
mature and intelligent with a shared understanding of the<br />
betwoen then the relationship. And r<br />
indeed Rabbie we've been talking about this issue.<br />
very pleased to see that both the Prime Minister and the<br />
Foreign Minister have asserted the nature of that<br />
relationship as being on a very sound basis. I don't<br />
believe that either the President of Indonesia or Mr<br />
Alatas who I think is an outstanding Foreign minister, or<br />
General Murdani are under any illusions as to the<br />
sovereign independence of Papua New Guinea and within<br />
that framework of the propriety of the relationships<br />
between Australia and Papua New Guinea. Certainly in the<br />
discussions that we've had with the Indonesians we've had<br />
no reason to believe that. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Mr Nainaliu, I wonder if there is any<br />
contingency where you would ask Australia to send troops<br />
to assist in Bougainville?<br />
NAMALIU: The question is obviously hypothetical in the<br />
sense that you don't actually consider those sorts of<br />
options until a situation arises. But in the particular<br />
case that's been referred to here by the Prime Minister<br />
in respect of Australian citizens, say in the case of<br />
Bougainville, being placed in a difficult position<br />
because of safety of lives, there would have to be in<br />
that case a contingency plan to ensure that they were<br />
flown or taken out of the island safely and that no lives<br />
were put in jeopardy. That is one situation where you<br />
could foresee this type of circumstance arising.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Naaliu, what's the latest state of play<br />
as far ab the delivery of goods and services to<br />
Bougainville? NAMALIU: The state of play as of now is that the ships<br />
are still there with the supplies on board, with our men<br />
on board. Discussions are still taking place between the<br />
BRA leaders and the community leaders as to the question<br />
of distribution. question that is still being<br />
resolved because obviously there is a difference of view<br />
as to who should be doing the distribution of services on<br />
the island. And in this case the BRA have obviously<br />
indicated that they would like to co-ordinate all of the<br />
distribution of the goods and services that are being<br />
delivered. on the other hand community leaders feel that<br />
it should be the public servants that should be doing it.<br />
JOURNALIST: H{ ow much pressure has this difference of<br />
view put the Endeavour Accord under?<br />
NANALIU: I think that if tflis nad VuL presouro on thPo<br />
Endeavour Accord to the extent to whether there was any<br />
likelihood of it breaking down it would have happened by<br />
now. The fact that there's been, that, so far, the<br />
Accord is being observed by and large in the sense that<br />
there's been no force used, no arms carried, our men have<br />
been asked to remain there rather than go, there has been<br />
uumxmuzication betweenl our people and the BRA leaders.<br />
The fact that our people are indicating that Lhey should<br />
go because is running low, ask to stay as well as<br />
the fact that they were being asked to tend to urgently<br />
sick people, all indicates that the good will is there,<br />
that the desire is there to make sure that the Endeavour<br />
Accord is implemented but implemented in such a way that<br />
the community leaders and the BRA leaders themselves are<br />
agreed on a common position. So T don't think it is at<br />
risk. JOURNALIST: They're all off Buka Island?<br />
NAMALIU: They're all there now. </p>
<p>JMMW 7WI ST: Are they actually Attending to urqently sick<br />
people? NAMALIU: That's the request that's coming through now.<br />
So within the next few hours we should know whether that<br />
would be possible.<br />
JOURNALIST: So the ships have come along side have they?<br />
NAMALIU: Yes.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Ministers, both of you in your<br />
speeches today referred to law and order concerns. There<br />
seemed to be some suggestion that if a request for<br />
additional assistance for policing be made or the<br />
offer would be made. Is there any funds planned for that<br />
or any request in mind?<br />
NAMALIU: We have a program, as you may be aware, under<br />
AIDAB. That's being funded by the Australian Government,<br />
specifically geared to assisting the police building<br />
and ensuring that at a number of levels, including<br />
management, that we have assistance provided in a way<br />
that it improves the level of performance of our police<br />
force. More recently we have indicated that we may be<br />
requiring some additional help in terms of advisors to<br />
join those that are already here.<br />
PM: I've indicated a positive attitude towards any such<br />
request that may come.<br />
JOURNALIST: To what extent would this extra help go? I<br />
mean how many advisors?<br />
NAMALIU: Twenty.<br />
PM: Twenty.<br />
JOURNALIST: And what's the cost?<br />
PM: It's capable of being accommodated within the<br />
existing programs that we have. Let me say that even if<br />
it were not and I'm assured that it is but even if it<br />
were not I'd be prepared to meet the request.<br />
JOURNALIST: Are there any special areas that these<br />
twenty advl~ orm will be covering, liae crowd control?<br />
NAMALIU: They would be placed in positions at the<br />
provincial levels because at the moment most of those<br />
that are already here are based in Port Moresby. What we<br />
would like is to have more of these advisors out in the<br />
provinces assisting at the provincial level. Assisting<br />
provincial commanders, regional commandem1. As part of<br />
our new initiative to set up regional .&amp; jds in the<br />
country we would also like to build o * mjN aeity at thalevel<br />
in addition to the capacity th fe&amp; ing developed<br />
at the provincial level. </p>
<p>PK4: Let me make the point that that is precisely<br />
consistent with what I was expressing in my speech,<br />
that's it's not an idea of us coming in and solving the<br />
problems, it's a question of assisting Papua New Guinea<br />
to build up their own capacity to deal with these issues.<br />
JOURNALIST: Kr Namaliu, in your speech you spoke of the<br />
tremendous difficulties that will challenge the very<br />
basis of our democratic institutions, which sounds a<br />
fairly dire sort of a worry. Could you elaborate on<br />
exactly what you fear.<br />
NAMALIU: What I think I fear is, as I'm sure you will<br />
understand, is that once you have a total breakdown of<br />
law and order, then the very fabric of democratic<br />
institutions in this country would be at risk. Therefore<br />
it is in our interests and international interests that<br />
we maintain those institutions that are responsible for<br />
ensuring that order exists in this country. And it is in<br />
that context that I was making those comments.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Namaliu, mr Hawke has indicated twice how<br />
he Australia is willing to assist with the of<br />
Bougainville. Have you given, has your Government given<br />
any practical consideration to that offer?<br />
NAMALIJ: Not in a sense of there being specific<br />
requests. But obviously in the overall scheme of things<br />
in respect of the rehabilitation program further down the<br />
line, as we begin this process of delivery services and<br />
goods to the province, there will emerge from time to<br />
time additional needs that we may not be in a position to<br />
do ourselves, in which case we may be looking for<br />
additional help.<br />
0 JOURNALIST: Mr Namaliu, will your Government be<br />
rescinding a recent Private Members Bill regarding<br />
mineral mining, givinq landowners rights down to twenty<br />
metres below the surface?<br />
NAMALIU: That particular bill is not yet in which<br />
case it is not yet in effect. Hioweverl the intention of<br />
the Government is essentially this, that we have been now<br />
relation t; mining" 47 R&amp; AV,~ gslation in<br />
planning and proposing to introduce a series of<br />
ameondments anyhow, changes to the mining legislation<br />
which will in this case 1nciuañ e an twwundment or ahange tm<br />
that particular bill to ensure that existing agreements<br />
are honoured. And also that in relation to alluvial<br />
mining, which is something that we are generally agreed<br />
on, that it is defined in such a way that it is in fact<br />
referring to alluvial mining and that no and no<br />
prospecting or or no existing agreement is affected<br />
in such a way that by the application of that principle<br />
it also creates problems for mining which is the<br />
particular case in the case of Mount.. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: So this would remove the threat to CRA?<br />
NAI4ALIU: That's right.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister Namaliu, what sort of<br />
timeframe are you looking at, what is your latest<br />
assessment on resolving the crisis on Bougainville?<br />
NA! IALIU: If I had we of course have been hoping that<br />
by now we would have resolved the problem. Twelve months<br />
ago I was asked the same question. I said I was<br />
optimistic that we would within the timeframe that has<br />
now brought tn us today. Obviously that has not<br />
happened but it hasn't diminished our resolve to ensure<br />
that we resolve it firstly peacefully, because we believe<br />
very strongly that that's the only way to achieve a<br />
lasting solution to this situation. But we have the<br />
experience that it takes time. And it will take time.<br />
There will not be any magic, fast solution to this<br />
situation. JOURNALIST: In taking this time, is it in your view<br />
entrenching the BRA?<br />
NAMALIU: It depends on how you look at it. Because if<br />
for instance you look at the situation as it has existed<br />
now since M'arch the level of services in the provinces<br />
has collapsed totally in which case those that were in<br />
some position of decision-making over there would not<br />
have been in a position to satisfy the vast majority of<br />
the people in the province with increasing pressures for<br />
access to toivices which cannat be provided under the<br />
present circumstances. So in that sense it is difficult<br />
to entrench your position if you don't have the goods to<br />
deliver to the people. Eventually the people themselves<br />
would get frustrated and will start applying, as they are<br />
in fact doing, pressures on you to either resume the<br />
services or something else might develop.<br />
JOURNALIST: Nr Namaliu, how many people have died as a<br />
result of not having medical supplies and to treat<br />
diseases and so on?<br />
NAI4ALIU: I think that those that have died are all<br />
mainly women in the process of childbirth.<br />
JOURNALIST: Numbers?<br />
? 4AMALIU: No, we don't have any specific numbers. It's<br />
obviously difficult to get correct numbers, or has been<br />
over the last few months.<br />
JOURNALIST: The Australian when they left the<br />
country some time ago, a month or so ago, used the figure<br />
of fourteen people having died. </p>
<p>NAMALIU: No, we don't have any way of confirming that<br />
figureo. go at thig point T rnnin't he any more accurate<br />
than what I'm saying nov.<br />
JOURNALIST: Is that a tolerable situation Prime<br />
Minister? NAMALIU: No situation is tolerable where lives are lost<br />
of course. In this situation unfortunately that has<br />
happened. We wanted to avoid it. We want to avoid it.<br />
Which is why we're anxious to get services restored to<br />
the island as soon as practicable.<br />
JOURNALIST: Are you insisting that security forces be on<br />
the island to distribute those services? Is that your<br />
final position on that?<br />
NAMALI7: No, they'* re all basically to help with<br />
restoration of services roads, health services<br />
getting repaired and put back into a situation where they<br />
can take in nurses and patients and so on. more than<br />
any other option. The distribution will be done by<br />
public servants who are there. That would be<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, I asked for an opening statement.<br />
can you tell me how you felt discussions went today with<br />
the PNG Government and what particular issues dominated<br />
PH: Yes. Well firstly they well let me go back. It's<br />
usual when you visit another country and have discussions<br />
with Heads of Government and Ministers to say that the<br />
talks have boon frank, dirent and constructive. That's a<br />
standard line of patter that's used I suppose. But I<br />
simply want to say to you that on this occasion wh~ en I<br />
say to you, as I will, that have been direct, frank,<br />
constructive, that's not a line of patter because that's<br />
an accurate use of language to describe what's happened<br />
in the relatively brief period we've been here. I've had<br />
firstly a session with the Prime Minister and a smaller<br />
group of Hinicters. That w~ n hofore lunch, And then<br />
after lunch with an expanded group of Ministers. We<br />
wasted no time. We covered the bilateral relationship in<br />
terms of and this is not in order of importance but<br />
covering the things that we dealt with: aid; the<br />
economic development of Papua New Guinea; the issues of<br />
Bougainville; the related issues of resource development<br />
what had been the impact of Bougainville upon those;<br />
the satisfauticin or otherwise of the Government here with<br />
the arrangements they have in place in other areas of<br />
development in terms of the relationship of the central<br />
government, the landowners and provincial government in<br />
terms of share of benefits. There was a lot of<br />
discussion about our defence co-operation programs in<br />
regard to the challenges confronting Papua New Guinea in<br />
the area of internal security and law and order. There<br />
was discussion about trade between our two countries.<br />
And without being exhaustive, they covered the sorts of </p>
<p>8<br />
things that we really spent most of our time upon. There<br />
woo alco a discusgion Ahhit nonstitution4l reform and the<br />
relationship between the central government and<br />
provincial government. We also affirmed the commonality<br />
of our position on the need in this emergence of new<br />
generations of leadership in Papua New Guinea, and in<br />
Australia, to ensure that the framework that we have<br />
should be developed in a way that meant that these new<br />
generations of leadership would take the relationship as<br />
aaeieusly no thoce in the first fifteen vears Qf<br />
independence have done. We talked about the significance<br />
for the development of Papua New Guinea, of its position<br />
in the Asia Pacific region. The whole of those<br />
discussions, if I may say, were premised upon points that<br />
I made in my speech, and that is that we assert the<br />
foundational importance of recognising the sovereign<br />
independence of Papua New Guinea. We're not here to make<br />
decisions for them. That is objectionable in concept,<br />
impractical in fact. And that what the whole thrust of<br />
Australia's position is to try and ensure that the aid<br />
that we give, which more and more is going to be balanced<br />
Nordg nrglect ad goam aid rather than budget aid,<br />
best equip Papua Now Guinea to b. AhlP to meet the most<br />
obvious challenges of economic development and law and<br />
order. Tnat was the 5tLrLuuLL the framework and tho<br />
content of the talks.<br />
JOURNALIST: On the question of aid, Mr Namaliu in his<br />
speech projected the running down of budget aid by<br />
the end of the century. I take it that you'd be happy<br />
with that sort of projection, but have you any idea of<br />
what level of, how the program aid is likely to rise<br />
reciprocally over that period?<br />
PMT No we can't be precise about it. What's been<br />
understood from the time when we really went to tne<br />
Development Cooperation Program was that, and that was<br />
finalised in 89. It has been based on a clear<br />
understanding on both sides that it is politically and<br />
economically appropriate that we should move to the<br />
position where in budget terms the Government of Papua<br />
New Guinea is financially independent. You've got to<br />
reconiao that at tho presPnt time the aid of over $ 300<br />
million is a very significant proportion of their budget<br />
position and the GDP is to the order of six per cent.<br />
And we recognise that that has got to come down and down.<br />
But it will mean that you can't sensibly, at this stage,<br />
put a figure upon either the aggregate or the breakup<br />
wiLhll project and program assistnnp that will b<br />
appropriate at that time. I mean it's too uncertain.<br />
The JlmiLtant thing for Papua Now Guinea to know is tbe<br />
continuing commitment we have to be of relevance to them<br />
and assistance to them in terms of the particular<br />
challenge and problems that confront them. No-one tries<br />
to say at this time that you can put figures upon that.<br />
At all points however there will be one common thread<br />
about our assistance. It will always be directed towards </p>
<p>trying to ensure that the capacity and the instruments of<br />
Papua New Guinea for dealing with its problems are going<br />
to be enhanced. That's the continuing criterion that will<br />
be employed.<br />
JOURNALIST: -In the course of the talks Mr Hawke on<br />
Bougainville, were you able to provide any advice or<br />
assistance at all on the stand-off between the BRA and<br />
the PNG forces?<br />
PM: I neither proffered any nor was I asked. That was<br />
as it should be, I repeat, in a position of the relations<br />
between two sovereign independent nations. The<br />
resolution of the Bougainville issue is a matter for the<br />
Government of Papua New Guinea.<br />
JOURNALIST: 14r Hawke if the situation did deteriorate<br />
and Australian help was requested, would the strategy be<br />
limited simply to trying to get Australians out help<br />
to restore order?<br />
PM: No I must say that the very very firm prima facie<br />
position would be the former. That we would see our<br />
responsibility on the basis of agreement with the<br />
Governmnent of Papua New GUinea would be, in that<br />
hypothetical situation, the provision of our resources to<br />
ensure the safe withdrawal of, not only Australian<br />
citizens, but it would be possible in that situation if<br />
you're talking about perhaps New Zealanders. That would<br />
be the strong prima facie position. I can't rule out<br />
absolutely that there wouldn't be in some situation<br />
either a request and a consideration of some other<br />
function, But prima facie I would be against it and we<br />
should limit ourselves to the role of, on an agreed<br />
basis, protecting Australian citizens.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Namaliu, has Indonesia expressed its<br />
concern about the seccessionist movement in Bougainville<br />
NAMALIU: No.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister Hawkce in your speech you said<br />
Australia hasn't got the capacity I understand<br />
position you've taken philosophically. what does this<br />
capacity mean?<br />
PM: The capacity was related to politics not<br />
intrinsic, I mean I didn'* t mean to convey<br />
JOURNALIST: It's not military force for example, not<br />
military capacity?<br />
PM: No. It's the political, it goes to political<br />
reality. Nothing that and we are talking so<br />
hypothetically. Get back to the facts, we are talking of<br />
relations between two sovereign independent nations. In<br />
that context if Australia were to say we'll. come in and </p>
<p>fix up your law and order problems, the political<br />
realities are that you couldn't do it. They wouldn't<br />
accopt it. Nor should they. It wnifld hp rPp1i1iAt. Pd and<br />
so it should. I mean that's the sense in which we<br />
haven't got the capacity. I am not saying that we<br />
technically don't know what issues are relevant, but it's<br />
only in that sense that if our advice and assistance is<br />
sought we'll give it but we can't do it.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke this constant message you've been<br />
delivering today that it's Papua New Guinea's<br />
responsibility to sort out its problems<br />
PM: I've been delivering two messages so don't say it is<br />
just one It's two. That it is the responsibility of<br />
Papua New Guinea to deal with its problems. It will be<br />
the intention of Australia as a close neighbour and good<br />
friend to assist them to be in a position to do those<br />
things.<br />
JOURNALIST: I think you are on the right track.<br />
PM: Thank you very much. Thank you. That reassures me.<br />
,. URNALIST: What I was qoing to ask though, sir, was is<br />
cL 4 S<br />
in Australia as it is to people up here?<br />
PM: In a sense yes. I go back to the point there is<br />
often, amongst some Australian commentators and some in<br />
the region and some in the world, the unstated assumption<br />
that there is still some quasi colonial relationship.<br />
Well let everyone understand that that finished in 1975.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Namaliu do you have to still wean your<br />
people off the idea well we can turn to Australia in<br />
times of need?<br />
NAMALIU: I think, you know, that the people of this<br />
country know that we cannot go on depending on Australia<br />
forever or indefinitely. On the other hand they know<br />
that Australia is a friend, Australia is right next door,<br />
we have a long historic relationship and tne Australian<br />
people generally I feel are well regarded up here. And<br />
in that regard wherever there is a need that we cannot<br />
fulfill from within and need some help with Australia<br />
obviously comes to the forefront of the countries that we<br />
go to.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Namaliu, Mr Hawke is going to Mt Hagen<br />
tomorrow. There has as I understand it been a<br />
consla. L-WIJt of tcAsien thoro followiiJ 1hD<br />
killing of the Engan businessman, What is the<br />
position at the moment and do you have any security<br />
concerns? NAMALIU: The position is thut-y wiii be welcome 2%<br />
Mt Hagen by the Premier and the people of Western </p>
<p>Highlands. They are prepared for him and they are ready<br />
to welcome him there tomorrow. And then up to Porgera<br />
where the Premier of Enga, and the members from Enga for<br />
the Porgera area as well as the regional member for Enga,<br />
will be there to welcome the Prime Minister tomorrow. I<br />
Anni'-think t-hat thR MIA~ tion of security will be a malor<br />
concern so as to prevent the visit from going ahead.<br />
They are ready, they're prepared and they will be there<br />
to welcome the Prime Minister tomorrow.<br />
JOURiNALIST: Mr Hawkce I presume the London conventiopi<br />
applies-<br />
PH: You'* re absolutely correct.<br />
JOURNALIST: I wondered whether you'd break it for Iraq?<br />
PM: Yes, that's not London.<br />
JOURNALIST; The Iraqi Ambassaator in Lcanberra today has2<br />
stated that men would would be kept as pawns until<br />
the end, until the threat to Iraq had disappeared<br />
PM: Well I deplore it. it is the case that, as I'm<br />
informed as of about 3.00 o'clock this afternoon, I am<br />
trying to keep in touch continuously with the situation.<br />
As I'm informed from the middle of the afternoon there<br />
are I belieVe two Australian males still in detention.<br />
The whereabouts of one is not known. This use of<br />
innocent foreign nationals in the Gulf crisis by the<br />
leadership of Iraq is horrendous, unacceptable and there<br />
will be, I repeat, no resolution. There can be no<br />
resolution of this crisis until really three things<br />
happen. I have been consistent in what I have said on<br />
this from the beginning and that is that there must be<br />
withdrawal of Iraqi forces from Kuwait. There must be a<br />
release of all foreign hostages. And there must be a<br />
cessation of the threat to the country of Kuwait and<br />
Saudi Arabia. These things are non-negotiable facts. I<br />
repeat what I've said consistently that it is an<br />
unacceptable violation of international codes of<br />
behaviour between nations that innocent foreigners are<br />
used as hostages in this sense.<br />
JOURNALIST: do you have any concerns that the Summit<br />
between the US and Russia unprecedented world front<br />
against Iraq will produce any more or is there fears of a<br />
split PM: I have no fears of a split. I think we've got to<br />
put that in the context that the Secretary General of the<br />
United Nations. Perez de Cuellar made a gallant attempt<br />
to mediate in this matter and it may have ended in a way<br />
in which the United Nations Secretary General has said<br />
involves no progress whatsoever. In that circumstance<br />
the meeting between Presidents Bush and Gorbachev is to<br />
be welcomed. I think the statement by President Bush was<br />
an accurate one when he was asked as to what he thought </p>
<p>a. had been the attitude of the Soviets in this crisis in<br />
his words, was superb, in describing their attitude and<br />
their actions. I think that was a proper use of language<br />
and I think within the framework of the developing<br />
constructive relationship between the superpowers I have<br />
no reason to believe that the Summit will involve<br />
anything other than a continuation of that constructive<br />
relationship. I can only express the hope that, as I<br />
have before, that Saddamn Hussein will make a rational<br />
analysis of the facts. Any rational analysis of the<br />
facts must lead to the conclusion that there can only be<br />
UU ft# abL 6-. J. J1 LWA. VIUWFjV, W Lj<br />
the present situation. And I mean by that a continuation<br />
of the economic sanctions can only bring economic and<br />
personal devastation to the people of Iraq. There is a<br />
question of how long that takes but it must end in<br />
devastation. And of course the other possibility that we<br />
all hope and pray would not occur is that some escalation<br />
of the conflict could only mean possible devastation. So<br />
I would just say to President Saddam Hussein that the<br />
rational analysis of the factual situation should lead<br />
him to the conclusion that he should withdraw his forces,<br />
he should release the hostages. I repeat what I have<br />
said and what other leaders have said that if he does<br />
that then he should understand these things'would follow.<br />
there would be an end to sanctions; there would<br />
be a withdrawal of the multinational naval force; ( c)<br />
there would be the draw-down of the desert shield forces;<br />
there would be an effort by everyone to get Iraq back<br />
constructively into the international community of<br />
nations; and importantly, that if Saddam Hussein<br />
believes that Iraq has genuine grievances with Kuwait,<br />
either territorial or in regard to disputed resources,<br />
then there are means available including the<br />
International Court of Justice where these issues can be<br />
decided. He ought to understand that that should be the<br />
route they go.<br />
ends </p>
