PRIME MINISTER MONDAY,. MARCH 17 1980<br />
from the Press Office SUMMARY OF NEWSVOICE N<br />
' Regulations under which the Federal Government may , ipr venrttE~ he<br />
export of wool will be signed into law later this Krnoanwran<br />
come into effect tomorrow. The regulations drawn up er the<br />
Customs Act will effectively close down the wool tra<br />
Ikustralia. The Government's air. is to force wool hand s 41. N-' W<br />
anci Victoria to end their 11 week strike by,, denying~ ther k<br />
relief donated by fellow unionists in other States. To this end,<br />
dismissal notices were today handed to 1400 members of the Storemen<br />
and Packers' Union in wool stores across the country. The notices<br />
hiave effect from tomorrow week. In Melbourne, crucial talks between<br />
the storemen and packers and'the wool brokers, broke up this afternoon.<br />
The wool strike was a major item before Federal Cabinet in* Canberra<br />
this afternoon and, afterwards, Duncan Fairweather spoke t6 the<br />
Minister for Primary Industry, Mr Nixon.<br />
Question: You have just come out of Cabinet, can you tell us what the Government's<br />
attitude it today? Has it changed at all?<br />
Mr Nixon:<br />
No, the Government's attitude has not changed, Indeed, it has hardened.<br />
Yet the Government is determined that this matter ought to be settled.,<br />
The Government hopes it will be settled around the conference table<br />
before the Arbitration Commission as it ought to be but the<br />
Government has set on a course to try and increase the pressure<br />
to go back to work,<br />
Question: But don't you run the risk of jeopardising those talks in the<br />
Arbitration Commission by taking this tough'attitude?<br />
Mr Nixon:<br />
Look. People always accuse us of being too sofl. when we do nothing,<br />
and we start to do things, people start using the words provocative<br />
and things of that nature. The fact is that this strike has been going<br />
on for 11 weeks. The fact also is that this union has refused to<br />
honour a Full Bench decision. Now, I can't recall that having occurred<br />
in history. It may have occurred where a Full Bench decision has been<br />
rejected by a union. I can't recall it, So it is a very serious matter,<br />
and I think we are reaching a new stage in industrial relations in this<br />
country. The Government recognises that, It also recognises the<br />
difficulties for the wool industry and for the wool growers, and for<br />
the exporters of wool, indeed for manufacturers of wool overseas.<br />
So the Government has no options left to it now, but to stand up to<br />
this particular issue,<br />
The Federal Secretary of the Storemen and Packers' Union, Mr Crean,<br />
would not comment on what happened in today's negotiations in<br />
Melbourne but he said that progress was being made,<br />
Mr Crean:<br />
So long as the parties are talking, yes, I am hopeful.<br />
Question: 9./ 2 </p>
<p>2-<br />
Question: rid dismissal notices bog the talks down at all today?<br />
Mr Crean:<br />
Yes, they certainly didn't assist, antd I think it is faii -to say<br />
that anyone who is realistically assessing the position waould agree<br />
with that. Dismissal notices don't take effect until Tuesday and,<br />
one would hope if we are talking towards settlement, they won't have<br />
effect anyway.<br />
Question: Do you think ' you have made any progress at all today?<br />
Mr Crean:<br />
In the sense that we are continuing to talk, yes, I think much progress<br />
Following the break up of the meeting, a spokesman for the wool brokers<br />
Mr Barry Purvis, was asked why the dismissal notices were served on thE<br />
unionists. Mr Purvis:<br />
The reasons have been given to the employees and I think that is betweE<br />
their employers and those employees.<br />
Question: Could it be said though, your action is provocative given that talks<br />
are still continuing to try and find solution?<br />
Mr Purvis:<br />
No, it is just inevitable in the situation. The Government has taken<br />
steps to bring in the control over the export of wool, and wool sales,<br />
as you may well know, wool auctions have been at a stand still for<br />
quite some time, and that is a simple commerical reason why the<br />
industry can't*. continue to operate.<br />
Question: When was the decision taken to issue those notices?<br />
Mr Purvis:<br />
I'm not going to discuss that.<br />
Question: So are you in fact saying that the Government forced you to do what<br />
you have done today?<br />
Mr Purvis:<br />
No, I am not saying that at all, We made our own decision. </p>

Federal Cabinet is concerned about Amoco's decision to stop supplying<br />
petrol to the independent distributor, Mr Leon Laidley. Ron Sinclair<br />
in Canberra says Cabinet is also examining the controversial<br />
legislation on secondary Poycotts, known as Section<br />
Ron Sinclair: Today's Cabinet agenda is obviously a busy one but the<br />
-oil dispuite, I am told, is high on the list. A few minutes ago the<br />
' 4inistar for industrial Relations, Mr Street, em'erged brieflyfo<br />
the Cabinet room but had no comment to make on whether any decision<br />
h-ad been made as to Section 45D of the Trade Practices Act. That is<br />
the section under which Mr Leon Laidley, the NSW independent distributor<br />
gained his injunction against the TWU which led to last week's chaos<br />
in Sydney. From what I am told, one of the things worrying the<br />
Government is that Amoco by now refusing to supply Mr Laidley with<br />
petrol has undermined the effectiveness of Section 45D. Mr Street<br />
has today held discussions with Amoco representatives but was unable<br />
to give any promises as to further Government relations. with the<br />
company. Whether that means the Government is considering a boycott<br />
of Amoco tenders for future contracts has not been revealed, but<br />
is it certain is that there is a full scale Government investigation<br />
going on. Senior officials from the Department of National Development<br />
and Energy, the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs, the<br />
Attorney General's Department and the Department of Industrial Relations<br />
itself, are all examining last week's oil dispute in the hope of making<br />
any changes necessary to ensure that the Federal Trade Practices Act<br />
can' t be so easily side stepped next time should a similar dispute<br />
rise again".<br />
Earlier today, the Minister for Industrial Relations met Amoco<br />
representatives, and Mr Laidley in Canberra. After the talks broke<br />
up this afternoon, the only comment came from Mr John Bowen who is<br />
president of the NSW Fuel Agencies Association, representing<br />
Mr Laidley. Mr Bowen was asked whether Amoco petrol would soon be<br />
flowing again to Mr Laidley's agency.<br />
Mr Bowen:<br />
No, I don't believe that we could answer that,. but we are hopeful<br />
that our discussion will assist the case.<br />
Quest-ion:<br />
Was there any sugg~ estion that Amoco would at least review its<br />
position? Mr Bowen:<br />
No, none whatsoever at this stage.<br />
Question: It would appear that Mr Laidley may have an action under the Trade<br />
Practices Act leaving aside Section 45D against Amoco for refusing<br />
supplies to him, Is there a possibility that such an action is in<br />
contemplation? Mr Bowen:<br />
I am sorry, but we have to get back to Sydney now, and ' have discussions<br />
with our legal advisors before we can make any further decisions. . q./ 4 </p>
<p>-4<br />
Question: So as far as you are concerned, the trip down today proved nothing?<br />
Mr Bowen:<br />
Quite the contrary. The trip down has'. been beneficial, The Minister<br />
now understands much clearer our point of view in the matter, have<br />
been given certain information that will be of-great assistance to us.<br />
Despite the end of the petrol strike, Sydney motorists who can find<br />
a service station with petrol are having to join long queues. Report.<br />
The Australian Olympic Federation says the public is giving strong<br />
support to its appeal to send Australia's team to the Moscow Olympics.<br />
The Federation says the money flow picked up after'-the International<br />
Olympic Commission decided that the Games should go ahead. Report.<br />
Says the Commission has*. to raise more than $ 3/ 4 million. It has<br />
already raised more than million, and the appeal is more or<br />
less on target, despite a lapse of two months when very few people<br />
donated money. Mr Patching says a majority of the letters he has<br />
received contain money and support for an Australian team to go<br />
to Moscow.<br />
The Labor Party's interim administrative committee began moving<br />
into its new offices in Brisbane this afternoon, and Mr Tom Burns<br />
said it was already well on the way to raising $ 100,000 which was<br />
needed to fight the' coming election. After accepting a cheque from<br />
the Shop Assistants Union for $ 9,000, Mr Burns talked with reporters.<br />
Mr Burns:<br />
The enthusiasm is unreal. In fact, it has amazed me the sort of support<br />
that has come forward. The concrete evidence of course this morning<br />
is a $ 9,000 cheque. Another union secretary turned up while we were<br />
meeting here and said I will have $ 2,000 for you tomorrow night. We<br />
have another 10 unions that have. said they will ut money in totalling<br />
about another $ 40,000. We have evidence now of about 95% acceptance<br />
of the Federal rules and the Federal decisions that have-been made<br />
which means that the rank and file in the branches are going to be<br />
forwarding their money to us. We have just got public support. You<br />
can feel it. People ringing up, people bringing in furniture. We<br />
don't even really know where it has come from. We were looking for<br />
typrewriters and then somebody turns up with a typewriter. It* is<br />
remarkable. Question: What sort of -money areyougoingto need to fight elections this year?<br />
Mr Burns:<br />
I think, properly based, and using the two campaigns, hand in hand, so'<br />
that you don't. have a really completely separate federal and State<br />
campaign. I ' reckon that on $ 200,000 I could base a good campaign.<br />
I wouldn't be as rich, like the Bjelke Petersen fund is going to<br />
be able to put' into the National Party, it will be the sort of campaign<br />
that can get votes. And believe you me, when Mr Knox said there is abou<br />
a 4-5% swing to the Labor Party, he wasn't making a mistake, I think he<br />
was being very practical. I think his friends who are attacking him now </p>
<p>ought to look again, because I believe that that is there, and there<br />
is a lot more to come if we are properly organised.<br />

Australians need not worry about Kangaroos being threatened with<br />
extinction according to the Federal Environment Minister, Mr Thomson.<br />
In fact, he says, three species of ' roo are in plague proportions.<br />
The Australian Conservation Foundation is strongly opposing the<br />
export of Kangaroo products to America, but Mr Thomson told reporters<br />
-the opposition was not well founded, Interviewed.<br />
Ansett Airlines today signed a $ 400 million contract for the purchase<br />
of 21 Boeing aircraft including five 767 wide-bodied planes, The<br />
-president of Boeing who was in Melbourne for the signing of the contractsaid<br />
he thought the TAA airbus against which the 767s had been bought to<br />
compete was too' large to be teconomical for most air route in<br />
the world. </p>
