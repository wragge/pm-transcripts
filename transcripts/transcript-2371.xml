STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER TI-E<br />
RT1. H. GON. OR M P. 1. IN THE<br />
HOUEOTKrV 16 FEBRUARY 1971<br />
ECONOMY: REDUCTIONS IN GOVERNMENT EXPE1ITlURE<br />
I recently spoke to the nation on the state of the economy and on the likely<br />
inflationary effects of the Arbitration Commission?' s award of a 6% 0 increase i wages<br />
and salaries.<br />
0 I said in order to decide what action should be taken now Cabinet had sought<br />
to discover the areas in which demand seemed to be growing most strongly. One of<br />
those areas is the public sector, spending by governments, and we believe one of the<br />
eOfnir stht alti naerse ao. f attack on rising costs and prices should be to restrict what is being spent<br />
Vflnen our Budget was introduced last August it was estimated that total<br />
" Commonwealth" expenditure would be 883 million. I diould say here, I think, that<br />
although called Commonwealth expenditure this amount included 708 million for<br />
reimbursement grants and other payments to the States. Indeed such payments mrade<br />
up more than one third of the Commonwealth Budget.<br />
Th-e total was 11. 2 per cent more than the year before. Since that Budget<br />
wa s formulated the Government has been faced with significant additional expenditure.<br />
WIhe National Wage Case decision, and other wage determinations is estimated to add<br />
directly, in the rest of this J. inancial year, $ 88 million to the Commonwealth's own<br />
Wage and Salary Bill in 1970-71.<br />
n II addi i , W~ j wag~ jtp-i inat ions, because they have led to an increase<br />
in average wages/ I/ f requi~ fbimonwealth to pay an additional $ 20 million to<br />
the States under the formula. In addition we will need to pay some $ 58 million to the<br />
States in this financial year to recompense them for the los-, of the receipts duty tax<br />
on which they had budgeted.<br />
Mairly as a result of these two outlays payments to the States are now<br />
expected to exceed the Budget estimates by some $ 83 million. Emergency payments<br />
associated with recent floods will doubtless increase the outlays required. Other<br />
additional demands on our resources since the Budget was brought down include the<br />
provision of $ 12 million as a capital advance to the Australian Wool Commission, and<br />
we believe some $ 6 million will be required this financial year for rural debt<br />
reconstruction and farm adjustment.<br />
We must also expect increases in costs of the material used by the Government<br />
All in all it is estimated by the Treasury that the nett increase in expenditure, since<br />
the Budget was prepared, will amount to approximately $ 242 million, if Departments<br />
were provided with the sums they have asked for. This is the background against<br />
which we have decided that we should make reductions in what would otherwise have<br />
been spent. </p>
<p>Having made a complete and detailed survey of Commonwealth expenditures<br />
we propose to reduce this by scwu--$ 75 milUoi!<br />
in the remaining months of this financial year. These reductions are made across<br />
the whole range of Commonwealth Departments but they do not involve any reduc tions<br />
in our payments to the States.<br />
Our object has been to effect reductions in the Commonwealth expenditures<br />
for its own purposes. We have not sought to achieve this at the expense of the States.<br />
A dissection of the reduction of $ 75 million as between the main categories of<br />
Commonwealth expenditure is provided in the attached table.<br />
I ask leave to have the table incorporated in Hansard. Further details a! the<br />
various reductions will be provided as necessary by individual Ministers. These<br />
reductions are spread right across the board but it will be observed that the areas where<br />
the more substantial savings have been made are defence, capital works and capital<br />
advances, and departmental running expenses. We were particularly anxious to effect<br />
e economies in administrative expenditures, including the overtime and salary expenditures<br />
WOf Commonwealth Departments. At the sanre time we have endeavoured to avoid<br />
reducing expenditures on essential development activities. In more general terms,<br />
we have sought to reduce the contribution of Commonwealth expenditures to total<br />
demand and to curb the Commonwealth's demands on the labour market.<br />
Thus the reductions in departmental expenditures will involve restraint<br />
on Public Service employment. The Public Service Board reported to me that a routine<br />
statistical projection made prior to my instructions indicated an increase in 1970-71,<br />
In full-time employment under the Public Service Act of 4.6% 0 on the numbers employed<br />
at 30 June, 1970. In 1969-70 the comparable increase was 4. 8% 7 whilst the increase in<br />
total civilian and defence forces employment in the community was<br />
The Board advised me that my instructions for restraint : on establishment<br />
Sin creases could benefit the health and soundness of administration in the Commonwealth<br />
WService and it suggested that a limitation ahould be placed on the increase in Service<br />
employment. The Public Service Board has now reported to me that in its discussions with<br />
Departments it has stressed the Government's policy of restraint but has not endeavoured<br />
to impose arbitrary cuts in employment. The Board's recommendation, which has<br />
been L.-cepted. was that Departmental increases in employment, which will be kept to<br />
the minimum, should not exceed at 30th June, 1971 an. overall increase in the Service<br />
of 3.4% 0 as compared with numbers employed under the Public Service Act on 30th Junie<br />
1970. This is a reduction of about 25% 0 on the projected increase in employment<br />
disclosed in the Board's earlier survey. But another way, the Board's original<br />
projection was that the Service would grow by 10, 534 in 1970-7 1. This growth has been<br />
cut by 2, 735. The Commonwealth has, I believe, moved quickly and firmly in the area<br />
available to it. It is necessary to do so. For, as we see it, the best interests of the<br />
community require that inflation shall be overcome and one of the first steps to this<br />
end must be action t o restrain our own expenditures. </p>
