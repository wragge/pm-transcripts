STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING, MP<br />
SIGNING OF NEW FINANCIAL AGREEMENT<br />
Heads of Government today signed the new Financial Agreement Between<br />
the Commonwealth, States and Territories.<br />
Under the new agreement, the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern<br />
Territory become, for the first time, members of Loan Council and parties to<br />
the Financial Agreement, originally signed in 1927. Until now, participation<br />
by the Territories in Loan Council arrangements has been on an informal<br />
basis. Obsolete provisions of the present Agreement, which prevented the States<br />
from borrowing in their own names in the capital markets, have been<br />
removed. The administration of the Agreement has been simplified and the<br />
requirement for Commonwealth and State borrowings to be approved under<br />
its provisions Is removed.<br />
Borrowings by the Commonwealth, States and Territories are subject to<br />
monitoring and reporting under new Loan Council arrangements introduced<br />
from 1993-94.<br />
The new Agreement would become effective after the passage of<br />
complementary Commonwealth, State and Territory legislation.<br />
