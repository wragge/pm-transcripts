    <content><![CDATA[<p>Thank you very much.</p>
<p>I want to thank James Brayshaw, Mike Fitzpatrick, Gill McLachlan for bringing us together for this fantastic tradition – for the 50th year running, the 2016 Mazda North Melbourne Grand Final Breakfast.</p>
<p>It is a great bipartisan morning too – Julie Bishop and I are here and of course we have the Opposition Leader Bill Shorten and the Premier Dan Andrews.</p>
<p>But today, we have to get our heads around something that is a little bit different – an AFL Grand Final that does not involve Jeff Kennett and his brown-and-gold scarf, suit and shoes.</p>
<p>Jeff’s in mothballs for this year.</p>
<p>And so we get to celebrate a contest between two sides that have not enjoyed as much success as the traditional powerhouse clubs of the AFL.</p>
<p>I appreciate that having a Sydney team in the Grand Final is never universally popular here in Melbourne.</p>
<p>But I say to all Victorians, it could have been worse. I’m looking at Tony Shepherd there – it could have been worse, much worse.</p>
<p>But for late goals to Jack McCrae and Marcus Bontempelli, it could have been an all-Sydney affair at the MCG today.</p>
<p>Now Premier, that might have been a reason to have a holiday – there you go. I suppose anything to escape the barbarians at the gates, anyway.</p>
<p>The Sydney Swans are my neighbourhood team. They train and play in my electorate, and they had an outstanding season as minor premiers.</p>
<p>They not only deserve to be here. The football public deserves to see them here – to see Buddy and the AFL’s most formidable midfield display their awesome skills on the biggest stage of all.</p>
<p>And, of course, the Swans represent a proud footy heritage for many thousands of South Melbourne supporters who never lost their love for the Bloods.</p>
<p>But if ever there was a day for anyone’s loyalty to be tested, it is this day.</p>
<p>Who among us would not declare themselves fans of the wonderful Western Bulldogs side?</p>
<p>They have come to the Grand Final the hard way – and as someone born exactly 30 days after their first and only premiership, it is tantalising to think their moment might have arrived.</p>
<p>Yes…it's been that long!</p>
<p>And there is in my neck of the woods, a little corner of red-blue-and-white at Paddington’s Trumper Park where the mighty East Sydney Bulldogs are our local Auskick team.</p>
<p>But, today, my loyalty to the Swans trumps my admiration for the Dogs.</p>
<p>Sadly, therefore there can be no unity ticket with Julia Gillard.</p>
<p>And I suppose there’s not much chance of a unity ticket with Bill. Just ask Julia.</p>
<p>So, as much we applaud the Bulldogs and the way they go about it, it’s the Swans for mine.</p>
<p>This is a tough game and a hard season.</p>
<p>We think of Bob Murphy, the spiritual leader of the Bulldogs team, who will miss out through injury. And of Allir Allir who is also sidelined with injury.</p>
<p>In my national statement to the United Nations General Assembly in New York last week, I was proud to tell the inspiring story of Allir’s journey in life from a refugee camp in Kenya to a career as an elite athlete in our home grown game.</p>
<p>Because Allir embodies that great strength of the AFL – it’s capacity to excite, inspire and unite Australians - magnificent in our diversity.</p>
<p>From our First Australians to our newest Australians - their stories are our stories, their successes are our successes.</p>
<p>That is why we are all so excited by the launch of the inaugural AFL Women’s competition.</p>
<p>My best wishes to both teams.</p>
<p>Either would be a deserving champion - but go Swans.</p>
<p>Thank you very much. </p>
