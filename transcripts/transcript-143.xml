I STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTEI_, THE RT.<br />
HON. R. G. MENZIES, X. P. RECORDED<br />
FOR THE CELEBR TION PARTY TO MARK<br />
FIRST TEN YEARS OF FEDLEPAL GOVERNMENT<br />
HELD IN SYDNEY, THURSDAY, 10TH DECEMBER,<br />
1959<br />
I am very proud that you should have drunk my health<br />
( in my absence from Australia) and given me so much credit, undeserved<br />
though it may be, for the events of the last 10 years.<br />
On the other hand, I am very sorry that I should not be with<br />
you on so happy an occasion. My wife, who has done so much, has<br />
the same emotions. As you know, our relationships with South-East Asia are<br />
of tremendous importance to us. It would be a misfortune if we<br />
uere always to consider them in military terms. I therefore<br />
accepted invitations to go to Indonesia and to Malaya for a brief<br />
visit of goodwill and of understanding. It is of the greatest<br />
importance that in our dealings vrith our Asian neighbours we<br />
should emphasise our points of unity and not dwell too heavily<br />
upon our possible points of difference. Thus, it is that one<br />
of the main things to say to the Indonesians is that, apart from<br />
our difference of opinion about dest New Guinea, we both have all<br />
the reasons in the world for getting to understand each other and<br />
establishing positive friendship.<br />
In the case of Malaya, re already have considerable<br />
historical and current reasons for being friends. Australian<br />
capital and skill were many years ago invested in Malaya, particularly<br />
in tin and in rubber. Through the former Governor-<br />
General of Australia, Sir ; Jilliam McKell, we played an active and<br />
constructive part in the devising of the Malayan constition after<br />
the achievement of Malayan self-government.<br />
The Prime Ministei, Tunka Abdul Rahman, recently visited<br />
Australia and was, I am sure, delighted at his reception and<br />
at the instinctive friendliness of our people.<br />
As part of the British Commonwealth reserve of forces,<br />
we have been and are represented, in all arms, with the willing<br />
co-operation of the Malayan people.<br />
To return to Indonesia, it is, of course, wÂ½ ell-known<br />
that we recognise Dutch sovereignty in West New Guinea and that<br />
on this matter we have, so to speak, agreed to disagree with the<br />
Indonesian administration.<br />
As we are in no sense anxious to piomote hostility we<br />
have, in the first places strongly supported the reference ol the<br />
Indonesian territorial claim to the Permanent Court of International<br />
Justice. The Government of Indonesia has, for its own<br />
reasons, not thought this to be a suitable tribunal. We have<br />
made it clear that, as we recognise Dutch sovereignty, so equally,<br />
do we recognise the right of the Dutch to co4duct negotiations<br />
with Indonesia so long as those negotiations are not conducted<br />
under either threat or duress. On this matter you will recall,<br />
as I do, that the Indonesian Foreign Minister, Dr. Subandrio, on<br />
his recent visit to Australia entered upon a joint declaration to<br />
the effect that Indonesia did not intend to solve those differences<br />
of opinion by force of arms. This, you will agree, is a<br />
civilised attitude and, as your government, 9 we , rill do our best<br />
to preserve it.<br />
It seems to me that the truth is that the great problEms<br />
before the new nation of Indonesia are those of civil administration<br />
and economic develop ent. Ue will do all in our power to<br />
help to solve these poblems. </p>
<p>2.<br />
Indeed, it may be said about both-of these neighbouring<br />
countries Indonesia and Malaya that Australia has a<br />
genuine interest in seeing them develop as free, well-administered<br />
and self-governing communities, with rising standards of<br />
living and that pride in democracy which is the best assurance<br />
of resistance to Communism.<br />
Looking back over these 10 years, we feel proud of the<br />
economic and social development of our own country. ' e have<br />
experienced unpopularity and popularity, but at all times we<br />
have tried to maintain a steady course; a c0ourse which in the<br />
result has, I believe, as you do contributed powerfully to the<br />
g-reatest period of national deveiopment within living memory.<br />
But we have not confined ourselves to domesiic and economic affairs.<br />
* We have set about the task of build1ing up these friendships<br />
and associations abroad which mean so much to our national<br />
security and our national future.<br />
It may occasionally be forgotten that the Colombo Plan<br />
originated with Australian initiative; that we played an active<br />
and I think, a determining part in the creation of the ANZUS<br />
Pact with the United States and New Zealand;, and that we were one<br />
of the founders of the South-East Asian Treaty which has done so<br />
much to stabilise those freedom-loving countries in South and<br />
South-East Asia who are determined not to paiss within Communist<br />
control. In short, we have had a positive, constructive and<br />
fruitful foreign policy. Our association with Great Britain and<br />
the other nations of the British Commonwealth has never been<br />
stronger or more genuine. Our association with the United States<br />
of America has never been so happy or so helpful. Thus it is<br />
that I think we may say at the end of a decadie of government that<br />
both at home and abroad we have served our country with integrity<br />
and with success. It is a good thing that ~ Ve should be able to<br />
say this to ourselves at this time.<br />
That I should say it to you is not an expression of<br />
personal self-satisfaction, because nobody kriows half so well as<br />
I do how much the progress of events has depbnded upon the intense<br />
loyalty and co-operation which has beep received from<br />
Ministei-s, Parliamentary Members and the manyr thousands of Party<br />
Members in the field of organisation whose names are perhaps not<br />
well known but without whose sacrificial work we could never hope<br />
to achieve success.<br />
Ten years seems a long time lookiing forward. it<br />
seems an astonishingly short time looking back. But I see no<br />
reason to doubt that so long as we provide s~ rvice to the Australian<br />
people, a sound character rhich inspires that service,<br />
and a patriotism which prefers the interests of the nation to the<br />
interests of the individual, we should be able to look forw. ard to<br />
another decade of which wve may be as proud a$ we are of the<br />
years just ended. </p>
