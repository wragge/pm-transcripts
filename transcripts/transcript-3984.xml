FOR PRE~ sPRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR RESSCANDURRA<br />
EXTRACT FROM AN ADDRESS AT PENSHURST, WANNON<br />
LABOR HAS BEEN LED BY A MAN WHO ADMITS HE DOESN I T KNOW<br />
ANYTHING ABOUT THE ECONOMY. HE IS BORED BY THE ECONOMY.<br />
HE GIVES US ASSURANCZS THAT THERE IS AN UPTURN IN SIGHT.<br />
FOR MR WHITLAM THERE IS ALWAYS AN UPTURN IN SIGHT. THERE<br />
IS ALWAYS A RECOVERY AROUND THE CORNER BUT EACH TIME THERE<br />
IS MORE UNEMPLOYMENT, MORE INFLATION AND A WORSENING OF<br />
ECONOMIC ACTIVITY. MR WHITLAM HAS YET TO SAY HOW HE IS<br />
GOING TO PAY OFF THE $ 6,500 MILLION IN DEBTS ACCUMULATED BY<br />
HIS GOVERNMENT OVER TWO AND HALF YEARS.<br />
IS HE GOING TO PAY THESES DEBTS OFF BY INCREASED TAXES?<br />
IS HE PROPOSING-TO PAY THESE DEBTS OPP -BY INCREASED INFLATION?<br />
I CHALLENGE MR WHITLAM. TO APOLOGISE TO ALL THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN<br />
HURT BY HIS ADMINISTRATION OVER TWO AND HALF YEARS. HE HAS HURT<br />
THE ELDERLY AND THE RETIRED WHOSE SAVINGS ARE NO LONGER SUFFICIENT<br />
TO SUPPORT TEEM IN DIGNITY.<br />
FARMERS HAVE BEEN DESTROYED. SCHOOL LEAVERS WILL BEGIN THEIR<br />
WORKING LIFE ON THE DOLE AND THERE ARE 230, 000 OF THEM THIS YEAR.<br />
THE FAMILY MAN IS PAYING THE HIGHEST TAXES IN AUSTRALIA'S<br />
HISTORY AND YOUNG COUPLES UNABLE TO AFFORD A HOME OF THEIR OWN<br />
BECAUSE THE COST HAS BECOME SO HIGH UNDER LABOR.<br />
I CHALLENGE MR WHITLAM TO TELL THE TRUTH ABOUT THE ECONOMY.'<br />
HOW WILL HE SOLVE THESE PROBLEMS THAT HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY T913<br />
POLICIES OF HIS ADMINISTRATION. a </p>
<p>-2-<br />
HOW WILL HE OVERCOME UNEMPLOYMENT AND THE FAILURE OF SMA&amp; L<br />
BUSINESSES. THE TRUTH IS AND 14R WUITLAM WILL NOT ADMIT THIS THAT HE WANTS<br />
EVERYONE TO BE DEPENDENT ON THE GOVERNMENT FOR WHAT IT WILL<br />
PROVIDE. THAT IS THE SORT OF TOTALITARIAN AND AUTHORITARIAN<br />
SYSTEM THAT HE WOULD LIKE TO SEE ESTABLISHED IN AUSTRALIA. </p>
