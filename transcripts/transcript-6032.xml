PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA MONDAY, 21 FEBRUARY 1983<br />
PRICES AND INCOMES POLICY<br />
Democracy in Australia has never been more seriously<br />
challenged than it is now by the ALP and the unions'<br />
so-called.-prices and incomes policy.<br />
Labor is not satisfied with putting unions above<br />
the law, under the prices and incomes policy, Labor<br />
would require union consent to make the law.<br />
The agreement has given the unions a right of veto<br />
over a Labor Government's economic policy. It<br />
has given the militant trade union leaders the<br />
right to decide what policies Would govern all<br />
Australians in almost every major area of Government,~<br />
in education, health, social security, taxation and<br />
trade just to name a few. Government decisions<br />
would be made by the faceless men of the union<br />
executives. In no other country in the western world have<br />
militant trade unionists been promised so much power.<br />
They have achieved overnight what they would never.<br />
achieve through the ballot box in a thousand<br />
years. Recently we saw a picture of Mssrs, Carmichael and<br />
Halfpenny handing over a $ 50,000 ' cheque to Mr Hawke.<br />
They indeed paid a small price to buy Government<br />
under Labor. To vote for Labor, is to put these<br />
communist trade union leaders into power. </p>
