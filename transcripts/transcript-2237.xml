PARLIAMENTARY LUNCHEON IN HONOUR OF<br />
THE RT. HON. KEITH HOLYQAKE, CH MP<br />
CANBERRA, ACT JUNE 1970<br />
Speech by the Prime Minister, the Rt. Hon. J. G. Gorton, MP<br />
Mr Prime Minister, Your Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen:<br />
We have welcomed many Heads of Government at Parliamentary<br />
Luncheons, but I think that none has been more welcome than our Guest<br />
of Honour here today. In one way, because we know him so well and<br />
we have had such close associations with him and with New Zealand,<br />
this official function may seem a little peculiar; for after all, Mvr<br />
Holyoake, the P rime Minister has been virtually a commuter to<br />
Australia over the years, constantly coming in and out. But this is<br />
the first occasion on which h_ 3 has paid us an official visit, and we<br />
are delighted that you have done this, Sir, because it gives us the<br />
opportunity to provide an official welcome and to underline the<br />
relationship between our two countries in this way.<br />
You have, Sir, been Prime M. inister of New Zealand for ten<br />
years which have brought new problems to your country as it has to<br />
all others and you are not only the Prime Minister of New Zealand, but<br />
the doye n of all Commonwealth Prime Ministers.<br />
We have, in Australia, a special affection for you and a<br />
special family feeling for New Zealand and for all New Zealanders.<br />
I remember with pleasure that the last occasion you and I were at<br />
a Parliamentary Luncheon was in Wellington when you gave an official<br />
welcome to myself and this is a delightful chance to return that on<br />
behalf of all Australians.<br />
Although Captain Cook, in a way, discovered both of us<br />
two hundred years ago, it was not really until 1944 that our two countries<br />
entered into the first comprehensive bilateral agreement that has been<br />
between us, an agreement for co-operation in defence, for consultation<br />
at Ministerial and other le vels in many other matters. We had formal<br />
trade treaties dating back to 1922, but the Canberra Pact of 1944 was the<br />
first broad, direct agreement, out of which our association and the<br />
relationship between our two countries has grown and strengthened<br />
over the years since then. </p>
<p>2<br />
Yet we had already fought together in one World War,<br />
and we were fighting in another at that time, and we had together<br />
immortalised the name of ANZAC.<br />
But since that first formal agreement almost thirty<br />
years ago, -e have continued that partnership and sat side by side<br />
in world councils and in regional councils. Together we spoke with<br />
the same voice for the smaller nations at San Francisco when the<br />
United Nations Charter was drawn up. Tugether we joined our Pacific<br />
partner, the United States of America, in the ANZUS Pact. We<br />
are in SEATO and ANZAM together, in the Colombo Plan, in ECAFE,<br />
in ASPAC and in the Asian Bank.<br />
We have both played our part i n the Commonwealth of<br />
Nations. We have been in Korea and Malaysia together, and we are<br />
now together in Vietnam. More recently in Djakarta, our fbreign<br />
Ministers sat together at a conference which, I think for the first time,<br />
indicated the interest of the Asian countries of this region and of ourselves<br />
in seeking to find a political settlement to the problems of Cambodia,<br />
a diplomatic break-through and again, one in which we both shared.<br />
We have had our Free Trade Agreement which has worked<br />
well for both our countries. We have had our discussions on defence<br />
standardisation and have declared our jea diness to share military<br />
commitments in Malaysia and Singapore after the British withdrawal.<br />
There iS ahead of both of us in this decade of the seventies,<br />
as the points of power and pressure around the world shift and change,<br />
and have different effects, a new opportunity for doing things together<br />
for our own national interest, and for the security and advancement<br />
of the region in which we both find ourselves.<br />
It may be possible to make a greater impact with aid to<br />
developing nations in our region if some of it is given jointly by<br />
Australia and New Zealand. This is one matter that you have raised<br />
already, and we look forward to examining it more closely and<br />
s ympathaically. But Australians and New Zealanders, living on the perimeter<br />
of Asia, are becoming more involved in that region as each year goes<br />
by. There are changes taking place there which will shape the whole<br />
course of our future and, as I think, the future of the world. These<br />
changes there, and in the South Pacific, are changes which offer to<br />
your country and to my country, further opportunities of that joint<br />
interest, that joint assistance which we have given over the years just<br />
past. ./ 3 </p>
<p>3<br />
Together we are providing substantial aid already,<br />
but perhaps the contribution we can make can be measured not<br />
just in terms of physical aid but by example, the example of<br />
democracy at work in a stable environment where progress,<br />
material progress is joined to the higher values of the individual<br />
happiness in a society, where the imperatives of youth are<br />
understood and given their proper place alongside but not superseding<br />
the judgment and wisdom of older generations.<br />
I think that our two countries can together be a bridge<br />
between the old civilisations of Europe and the new civilisations<br />
or not new civilisations but the developing countries of our own<br />
region. I am sure we can do more things together than we could do<br />
apart. And, therefore, this visit, as an indication of our<br />
intention to do things together, gives the opportunity to welcome you,<br />
but not only to welcome you, but to welcome the fact that these two<br />
countries, with so much in common, so close together, have the<br />
same outlook, share the same determination to do what we can<br />
for ourselves and our neighbours as we have in the past. This is<br />
another great reason, Sir, why I am delighted to welcome you on<br />
this occasion.<br />
