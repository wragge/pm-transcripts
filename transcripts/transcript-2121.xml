FOR PRESS: P. M. No. 76/ 1969<br />
SURVEY OF MUSICAL COMPOSITION IN AUSTRALIA<br />
In Sydney this afternoon, the Prime Minister, Mr. Gorton,<br />
presented the first set of a Survey of Musical Composition in Australia<br />
to the President of the Fellowship of Austral ian Composers ( Miss<br />
Dorothy Dodd). The presentation took place at a reception arranged by<br />
the Advisory Board, Commonwealth Assistance to Australian Composers.<br />
This Survey project was made possible by Commonwealth<br />
funds provided through the Advisory Board, and has also been supported<br />
by the Australasian Performing Right Association. It is the first of a<br />
series of Surveys being arranged by the Advisory Board which will be<br />
sent to major musical and educational organisations and radio networks<br />
overseas to publicise the work of Australian composers. Copies of this<br />
first Survey are being despatched immediately.<br />
The composers represented are John Antill, Nigel<br />
Butterley, Clive Douglas, the late Alfred Hill, George Dreyfus, Robert<br />
Hughes, Richard Meale, Peter Sculthorpe, Felix Werder and the late<br />
Dorian Le Gallienne. Each Survey set comprises an historical review of musical<br />
composition in Australia, a catalogue of Australia's important composers,<br />
their publishers and recordings, the transcript and rec ordings of their<br />
talks, the scores of their works and commercial recordings of their<br />
works. Copies of the printed material are available in English, French<br />
and German.<br />
