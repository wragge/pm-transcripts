TRIBUTE TO SIR DAVID BRAND<br />
Sir David Brand was one of the great Australian Premiers.<br />
For 12 years he gave leadership to Western Australia at a time<br />
of unparalleled development in that State's history.<br />
The results of his foresight and drive are being enjoyed not onl-y<br />
by Western Australians, but all Australians of today.<br />
Most of all David Brand will be remembered for his sincerity and<br />
humanity attributes which won him the support and popularity he<br />
so rightly deserved. </p>
