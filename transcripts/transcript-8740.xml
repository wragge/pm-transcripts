STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING, MP<br />
AUSTRALIAN DEFENCE FORCE POLICY ON HOMOSEXUALITY<br />
Following Cabinet's consideration today, the Government has decided to end the policy of<br />
discriminating against homosexuals in the Australian Defence Force ( ADE). TMe change will<br />
take effect immediately.<br />
This decision reflects broad support in the Australian community for the removal of<br />
employment discrimination of any kind, including discrimination on grounds of sexual<br />
preference. The dccision brings ADF policy into line with the tolerant attitudes of Australians<br />
generally. The ADF acknowicdgcs that there are male and female homosexuals among its members and<br />
has advised the Government that these members arc no longer actively sought out or disciplined<br />
because of their sexual preference.<br />
In making this decision, my Cabinet colleagues and were mindful of the attitudes and opinions<br />
of members of the ADF and the cx-Service community. The Government appreciates the high<br />
standards of dedication and professionalism expected of ADF personnel, but considers that the<br />
decision will not have the adverse effect on morale and cohesion predicted by some.<br />
The Government believes that the new ADF Instruction on Unaccqptablc Sexual Behaviour,<br />
whether homosexual or heterosexual, tabled by Senator Ray in the Senate in June 1992 and<br />
which Cabinet today endorsed, provides adequate protcction for individuals against unwelcome<br />
sexual advances and gives officers the necessary authority to deal with infringements.<br />
The ADF Instruction takes thorough account of all forms of sexual behaviour which could affect<br />
operational effcctivcncss, group cohesion, morale, command relationships, and protects<br />
underage persons within the ADF.<br />
The Government considers that the Instruction on Unacceptable Sexual Behaviour is a farreaching<br />
and commendable reform. It has been praised by the Human Rights Commissioner and<br />
the Caucus Joint Working Group which looked into the ADF policy. I congratulate Senator<br />
Ray, Mr Bilney and the members of thc Department of Defence and ADF responsible for its<br />
development. CANBE-RRA<br />
