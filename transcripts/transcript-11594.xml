    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Prime Minister and the Premier of New South Wales today announced that the Federal and New South Wales Governments have concluded a bi-lateral agreement on funding and arrangements for the diversion of illicit drug users in New South Wales.</p>
<p>Drug diversion gives people who are caught using drugs the option of undertaking treatment and/or education aimed at helping them to stop using drugs, rather than getting caught up in the criminal justice system.</p>
<p>The bi-lateral agreement gives effect to the commitment of the Commonwealth and New South Wales to divert drug users into treatment as early as possible according to the principles of the national diversion framework endorsed by all Australian governments last year.</p>
<p>Under the bi-lateral agreement the Commonwealth will provide the New South Wales Diversion Initiative with $31.8 million over four years from funds allocated to the Tough on Drugs programme.</p>
<p>Consistent with the framework, a reference group with representatives of Commonwealth and State governments and the Australian National Council on Drugs has been established to provide advice on the implementation of diversion.</p>
<p>Diversion will be implemented across New South Wales through five initiatives:<br />
Counselling and other treatment services as part of a Cannabis Cautioning Scheme to be trialed across the State.<br />
Drug Offenders Compulsory Treatment Pilots for the Far North Coast and Illawarra.<br />
An Early Court Intervention Pilot for the Far North Coast operating out of the Lismore Local Court.<br />
The Young Offenders Act will allow police to issue a warning or caution, or organise a youth justice conference, in lieu of commencing court proceedings.<br />
The Youth Drug Court Pilot in the Sydney Metropolitan area is an initiative linked to the Young Offenders' Act for offenders with problematic drug and alcohol related behaviour.</p>
<p>Diversion initiatives will be implemented across New South Wales in areas with the greatest need, be they in cities or in rural and regional areas.</p>
<p>The initiatives resulting from this bi-lateral agreement will maximise the opportunities for drug users to break away from drugs and take personal responsibility for their lives.</p>
