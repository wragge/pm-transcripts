E. O. E. PROOF ONLY<br />
PRESS CONFERENCE PRIME MINISTER AND MR GRAY, TASMANIAN PREMIER<br />
26-JUNE 1984<br />
MR SAMiA, WI' 6;<br />
PRlDIE MINISTER, COULD YOU TELL US ARE YOU SATISFIED YOU'VE SATISFIED<br />
TASiANIANS IN THEIR NEEDS OVER THIS DAM ISSUE?<br />
11R HAZE:<br />
WELL I OF COURSE &amp; M SATISFIED, BUT WHAT'S mRE MPORTANT IN A SEN~ SE THAN ME<br />
BEING SATISFIED IS THAT THE PREIER OF TASMNIA, MRCRAY, HAS SAID AND HS<br />
SIGNED THAT THE CMAONWEALTH HAS NOW MET ITS C( QIFA-fNS. I'D JUST IKE R,<br />
MAU THE POINT THAT, AND I AM PLEASED THAT THERE IS A CLEAR AND UNEQUIVOCAL<br />
UNDERSTANDING.* I WOULD JUST LIFE TO REMIND YOU THkT ON THE NIGHT OF THE<br />
OF IMARCH 1983, IN ACCEPTING THE DECISTON OF TiE AUSTRALIAN ELECTRUTE,<br />
THEN I WV= T OUT OF MY 14AY TO SAY THAT WHI'E WET-' D RECEIVED A BIT OF A SLAP<br />
FRC~ 1 THE TASMANIAN VOTERS, THAT WE WOULD HONOUR OUrR CbIfhNT TO TASMANIA<br />
AD OUT OF THE LOMV DISCUSSIONS THAT THE PMRIIER AND I HAVE HAD OVER A<br />
PERIOD OF Th1ELVE M0MHS FROM THE 1ST OF JULY, WE'VE REACHN) THAT POSITION.<br />
QUESTION: MR HAWKE, DO YOU BELIEVE THAT YOUR OFFER TO THE STATE IS BTER THAN THAT<br />
WHICH MR FRASER....?<br />
MR HAME:<br />
IT'S NOT FOR ME TO D( MEM INTO THAT AWAIYSLS. 1, AT WE'VE DONE IS SAY MTAT<br />
WE HAD AN4 OBLIGATION TO MET, THE DIEWMONT OBLIGATION, THE PEOPLE WHO WOUD<br />
HAVE BEEN ELPLOYED ON THE CORDON-BEItY4-FRANKLIN, TO MEET OUR OBLIGATIONS N<br />
RE. GARD TO ENSURING THAT TASMANTANS WOULD NT BE DISADVANAGED IN THE COST OF<br />
ELWI1ICITY THAT WILL NC% 4 BE GENEATED IN VAYS IT WOULD BE MET BY THE FMVK-JIN'<br />
THOSE AUE THE CXIhiMMS AND WE'VE MET T0H. THE PRESEN'T COST TN TERMS OF<br />
VHAT WTE'VE HANDED OVER T1O MR GRAY AM) WTHAT $ 277 MILLION, BUT<br />
APPRECIATES IT IN RESPECT OF THE $ 200 MILLION, WHICH IS TO SUBSIDISE ' tHAT<br />
112 I'GAWAITS FRCX4 THE ArnHNY AND KING SCIIEES AND THAT WILL BE lIbD1D,<br />
SO WHILE ITS $ 200 MILLICON IMNW THAT WILL BE LNDEM) ANNULMLY BY THE NON<br />
DWELLINGU CONSTRUCTION fULICIT.... OF THE NMTIONAL AC( X) UNTS. SO IN TfIlE IT<br />
WILL BE ' S4EVHAT MDRE THAN . TUAT.<br />
QUESTION: WHAT ABOUT YOU MR GRAY? ARE YOU SATISFIED THAT THIS DEAL IS GOING TO ELP<br />
TASMNIA IN E FU TURE OR DO YoU Thifit I'S A BAD T1{ G?<br />
GRAY:<br />
WE'RE SATISFIED THAT THE PRIE MINISTER IS N( M, BY VIRTUE OF THE AGREDM<br />
THAT WE'VE EM'IRE IOM, AND WI-lEN THAT AGRER1EQiT IS PUT INTO EFFECT<br />
HONOURlD THE UNDIRTAKING HE GAVE TO TAFXNIA. THE $ 270 ODD MILLION THAT<br />
HE REFERS T OF COURSE ONLY REFERS TO THlE FIRST 112 lEGAWATTS. THE<br />
MILLJON HAS BEN SPENT ON THE GORDON-BE* IM-FAtNK. LNN AND THE JOBS THAT THE<br />
0WlbDrEalLTH HAVE HELPED PROVIDE. THERE IS OF ( XXRSE THE QUESTION OF THE $ 68<br />
NEZAWATTS OF POWER HICH TM PRIE MIISTER HAS DRTkEN THAT HE WILL<br />
REDUCE THE COST OF TAT POWER TO TME SAM [ PICE AS IT VJ) lD HAVE BEEN PRODUCED<br />
BY THE GCOrDO-BE a4-FRAhrKLIll PUER SCHE2-' AD THAT OF COURSE ADDS APPRECIABLY<br />
TO THE OVERALL COMPENSATION THAT WLL BE PRVIDED W-EN THE P( YER IS RIBQUTRED,<br />
AS YOU WOULD KNOW MAX, TE TASM\ iANIAN GOVER* 2Nf FhuX. IIS; I; S THAT IT WILL NEED<br />
THAT POWER IN THE 1990s, WETHER IT'S IN 1991 OR 1995. ULTIMATELY IT WILL BE<br />
NEEDED. OUR VERY FIRM ADVICE APPEARS THAT IT ILL 13E NEEDED IN ABOUT 1991,<br />
WE WOULD THEN EXPECT THE C4OZZIONWEALHJ~ TO CO! l1ENCE PAYING THE SUBSIDY ON THAT<br />
68 MEGA34A TS OF POW4ER. </p>
<p>QUESTION: AT WHAT POINT WILL YOU BEGIN TO PAY IIIAT SUBSIDY?<br />
HAhE: AS THE PMFWIIER SAID, IT'S NOT CERTAlNI AT WAT nTW, WHAr WAE'VE DERTAKEN<br />
AND WHAT THE PREMIER ACCEPTED THAT WE WILL MEET AN OBLIGATION IF AND WHEN<br />
THAT FXIRA 68 MEGlAWATTS IS REQUlRED NOW4, THE 00f[ Th%' T IS TO MEET THE<br />
DIFFERI2CE IN THE COST BEMtEEN WHAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN IF THE GORJDN-BELWFRANKLIN<br />
HAD GONE AHEAD AND WAT THE ADDITIONAL COST WOULD BE FROM THE<br />
ALTERNATIVE SOURCE OF GENEATIQN.<br />
N% 7V IT'S MY BELIEF, I THlIK THAT THE PREhIER SHARES THAT BELIEF, THAT WE WIL<br />
BE ABLE IN CONSULTATIONS EFLTEEN US TO WORK OUT THE QUESTIONS IN REGARD TO<br />
THAT 68 MEGAWATS AS TO THE TINE AND THE ME TOD. WE BELIEVE THAT WE'VE SHC%<br />
THAI WE CAN WORK THESE THINGS OUT, IT kIfGV HAVE BEEN A BIT ROUGH AT TRIES,<br />
BUT WE COT THERE, AND THERE 13 A FRCVISION IN1 TE AGREENT THAT IF M<br />
CRI DEALTH A) TASMANIA CAN'T WORK OUT THE QUESTION, THEN THERE IS<br />
PROVISION Fr THE ESTABLISMENT OF A = O OTHEALTh STATE INDEPENDENT CCIS SlCN<br />
TO ADDRESS THAT ISSUE.<br />
QUESTION:<br />
DO YOU ACCEPT THAT IT'S A FAR TOO GMWEOUS OPEN ENDED CMMTInMU ON THE 68<br />
MEA TTS?<br />
HAME: NO I DO NOT ACCEPT THAT IT'S TOD GRNEUMS AND OPEN ED. WE'VE BEEN VERY<br />
CAREFUL ABOUT Ir. AS I SAY TE ARE&amp;= REFERS To THE 68 JEGAWAXTS IN TERS<br />
OF IF AND WHEN THAT IS NEEDED, IN TERMS OF TA&amp; IANIA'S D4aND FOR ADDITICQAL<br />
ELERICITY. SO THAT'S WHAT.... IF AND WHA AND WE ACCEPT THE CCk\ irfITlEN0.<br />
THEN WE ACCEPT THAT WE WILL CONSULT) NEGOTIATE BEIVEEN US, IN THE MKTfiAL<br />
BELIEF THAT WE CAN WORK THAT OUT BEn1EEN US, PREFEERABLY, IF 14E CAN'T<br />
THEN THAT'S THE REASON FOR AN INDEPENDENT CCIMSSION I THINK THAT'S<br />
A RESPONSIBLE ECRCISE OF MY RESPONSIBILITIES ON BEALF OF THE<br />
AND I THINK ON BEHALF OF THE PR ID-ER iN HIS BEHALF.<br />
QUESTION: MR CRAYIT HAS BEEN... QU( OTED IN TIHE IAST FEW DAYS IN THE TAR4ANIAN PRESS THAT<br />
SUBSIDISATION OF ADDITIONAL 68 MEXAWATTS COULD BE WORTH $ 500 MILLION OVER<br />
YEARS. IS THAT FIGURE... THE ONE THAT THE CaikMWEALTH AGREED TO? </p>
<p>-3<br />
M GRAY<br />
it's fairly clear to us that we will need that extra. 168 MW about<br />
1991 and from thereon and even if projection were proved to be<br />
optimistic the latest we believe we would need it would be about<br />
1992. I think the Commonwealth have made an. independant asse~ sment<br />
about that and suggested that it's 1994, as I said betore I think<br />
it matters much as to when it is the commitment is there from the<br />
Prime Minister that when we need the power it will be subsidised.<br />
Now on the basis on the alternatives which we know are presently<br />
available to Tasmania and basically that is only a coal fired<br />
thermal station the guarantee which the Prime Minister has provided<br />
. is equivalent to about 12.5 million dollars per year, you can do<br />
your own arithmatic as to what that comes to.<br />
QUESTION: Mr. Gray do you believe that you have got the best deal for Tasmania.<br />
You have quoted figures in the past that you wanted more money<br />
for what it's already done, more money for resources in the South<br />
West.. MR. GRAY:<br />
I believe we've got a fair arrangement for Tasmania. Obviously when<br />
the High Court ruled against us and I don't think any Tasmanian<br />
really believed that the High Court was going to rule against us,,<br />
but they did, we accepted that decision, that was the decison of the<br />
highest court in Australia and we accepted that and we then had t~ o<br />
set about negotiating with the Prime M4inister to obtain compensation.<br />
Mr. Fraser as you know had offered a figure of $ 500 million in round<br />
terms which probably came back in present day values to a bit over<br />
$ 300 million we were starting at the 1st July last year virtually<br />
from a very deep barganing position I think you would agree Prime<br />
Minister and we therefore made some aibit claims<br />
VM. HAWKE<br />
No Premier has ever had a fairer bargining context to operate in<br />
then you did Robin.<br />
MR GRAY:<br />
Blut we managed to sort it out and negotiate it over the last twelve<br />
months. QUESTION: Premier with that respect did it mean better to accept Mr. Fraser's<br />
offer? MR GRAY:<br />
Oh no, on all the advice that we have from our advisors, the Prime<br />
Minister's offer is worth twice Mr. Fraser's offer.<br />
MR. HAWKE:<br />
I've stayed out of this question of observations about the figure!<br />
and the implecations over $ 277 million dollars which is there on<br />
the table and it's understandable that Mr. Gray is going to have<br />
his figures to throw around. Let me remind you that when we<br />
started this exercise that the claim was three and half billion<br />
dollars was necessary, held make a good Trade Unionist.<br />
MR. GRAY:<br />
That was a trick you taught me when you was President of the ACTU.<br />
MR HAWKE.,<br />
Yeah, all I can say is that we don't accept the calculations that<br />
the Premier is using, he is entitled to for his own political </p>
<p>to try and put figures upon us. I point out; that in respect<br />
of 112 MW that is being produced by the K~ ing and Anthony that<br />
the subsidy involved there is still $ 3.00 million my course that<br />
it probably be provided in a different fashion the 68 MW but<br />
all I can say our peopl2-haven't been entirely slacking in their<br />
calc-iations as WI~ at will be involved, it's no where near the<br />
figure that's being circulated.<br />
QUESTION: Mr. Gray all hope is going to build that dam in the future, do<br />
you believe that the dam might be built one day?<br />
-MR GRAY:<br />
I think in fact that in time we will see a reassessment of these<br />
conservation questions. What will happen in the futute I can't say.<br />
There is now 70% of Tasmanian hydro electric resources, unused<br />
resources locked up in the World Heritage area and that's why power<br />
will not be able to be provided from cheap sources like the K( ing<br />
and the Anthony scheme for the 68 t&amp; J. But ultimately I believe that<br />
common sense will. prevail and we will see the utilisation of those<br />
resources, I might be an old man before it happens but<br />
MR HlAWKE:<br />
Tasmania will have a lot of money to pay back then<br />
QUESTION: Mr. Hawke can you tell me what-calculations under 68MW, what sort<br />
of period are you talking about the 68 MW being subsidised?<br />
MR HAWKE:<br />
Well precisely because it is impossible to put figures on that<br />
but the agreements that ends in the way it does for the purposes<br />
of the people of Tasmania what is important, that I on behalf of<br />
the Commonwealth have honoured a commitment in regard to that<br />
additional 68 MW if and when it is necessary. Our commitment is<br />
there, clear and unequivocal now our definition the Premier and I<br />
and our people weren't able to get agreement as to precisly when<br />
that obligation will arrive'and because we can't do that you can't<br />
put figures in. The obligation is there it can be met as we nave<br />
indicated in correspondence you could have a concept of an annual<br />
subsidy, you could have the concept of an up-front capital contribution<br />
and it will be a matter for discussion between us both as to when<br />
the meeting of the obligation will be necessary and as to how it<br />
should be met. We have recognised that is the fact and we have<br />
also recognised the possibility that we may not be able to agree,<br />
although I believe that experiences shown that we will be able to.<br />
If we can't it will be a matter for an independant commission. Quite<br />
impossible as we recog-nise to put figures on it now.<br />
MR GRAY:<br />
r think the wording of the agreement is quite clear and I think as<br />
the Prime minister says it leaves the way open for the matter to be<br />
rediscussed. if you look at the agreement it says the Comnmonwealth.<br />
undertakes to provide a subsidy to reduce the cost of a further<br />
68MW electricity the balance of capacity that would have been provided<br />
by the Gordon-below-Franklin scheme to the level of the cost of the<br />
electricity that would have been produced by the Gordon-below-Franklin<br />
scheme. If and when the need for the electricity has been demonstrated.<br />
and I think that adequately affects Tasmania and it honours the undertaking<br />
that the Prime minister gave in relation to the assuring that<br />
Tasmania would not be disadvanted in terms of electricity costs as a </p>
<p>result of the Commonwealth action.<br />
QUESTION: But you'd expect that subsidy for something like 60 years, the life<br />
of the dam?<br />
MR GRAY:<br />
Well I think the wording is quite clear, that would have been provided<br />
by the Gordon-below-Franklin sheme Bruce, so you know how long these<br />
Hydro, schemes last.<br />
QUESTION: Mr. Gray are you satisfied that you've got the best deal as far as<br />
Tasmanian's perceive it to be, in otherwords do you think that you<br />
will be able to sell this package in Tasmania.<br />
MR. GRAY:<br />
I have no doubt about that. I think Tasmanians recognise that we.<br />
have had a difficult year as I said earlier -that we really started<br />
from a position of weakness on July the let last year because<br />
stricktly speaking the Commonwealth didn't have a legal liability<br />
and we have negotiated hard it's been sometimes I suppose a<br />
difficult Prime Mrinister but we have-continued to negotiate sometime<br />
negotiations almost broke down but we got together again and we<br />
managed to talk it out and advance the situation and I'm satisfied<br />
we got the best deal that could have been got. Certainly better than<br />
Mr. Fraser offered and having regard to all the facts and the position<br />
from where we started I believe that Tasmanians will be well satZisfied<br />
and as I say I'm satisfied with the P'rime Minister has honoured by<br />
virtue of the implementation of this understanding the comm~ itments<br />
which he gave.<br />
QUESTION: of course you started this as you said from a weak bargining position<br />
would you have been better off if you had started bargining in a<br />
strong position.<br />
MR GRAY:<br />
OH, no not at all. I know the Prime minister sees himself as<br />
generous at time to time but I think tie would have a bit of a<br />
battle to have got to the figure we got to and we've got to<br />
remember this, Tasmanian's wanted that-power scheme built, they<br />
voted us into government, a very clear mandate to build that<br />
scheme and I think their vote at the March 5th election was a<br />
clear indication that they didn't agree with the Prime Minister's<br />
policy. We had a mandate to build it and if we had not proceeded<br />
to the point where we had to stop because of the High Court action<br />
then we would have been letting Tasmanian down and Tasmanians wan~ ted<br />
us to go on, and I'm sure they realise that all this is all unfortunate<br />
that the Government of Tasmania ha., fought very hard to get a fair<br />
deal for Tasmania following the High Court decision. </p>
<p>MR HAWKE:<br />
LET ME JUST MAKE THIS POIT ABOUT THE FAIRNESS AND SO ON WHEN THE<br />
NEGOTIATIONS WERE GOTNG IN AND WE CODN'T AT ONE STAGE GT ANYWHERE<br />
THE MTONVWE4LTH WAS CONVC ED THAT THE FAIRNESS OF OUR APPROACH THAT<br />
WE mADi THE OFER o TASvmAiX TO HAVE A., N nhm~ E):' J) rr FEDERAL/ STATE<br />
CftISSION TO CONS. LDER AND DE= 1fE1NE ON THESE INrAERS. WE WERE LX) NFIDENT<br />
OF THE FAIRNESS OF OUR POSITION. NOW, IN' 17HE EVEln', TASIANIA, AND I'M<br />
CLAD THEY DID, TASMNIA IN TiE FACE OF TMAT OFFE-71 FROM US TO HAVE IT<br />
INEPENI2DELY DETERnD PRMERED TO CO ON VTH TME NEGOTIAT IONS, AIM IN<br />
THE EVEN TIE NEWOTIATIONS HAD PRODUCED WHST WE BELIEVE IS A FAIR POSITION<br />
AND WHAT WE SAID MEt WOULD BE QUITE HAPPY TO GO TO AN IMMEPDENT COMi&gt; SSION.<br />
QUESTION: R GRAY, A QUESTION DIRECTED TO YOU AND THlY PRI MINISTER RESPECTIVEL.<br />
I-MJ DO YOU SEE THE POLITICAL fIPLICATICNS OF THIS AQEEENT IN-TEmm OF<br />
HE ELECTORAL. RESPONSE TO IT AND PARTICULARLY IN VIEW OF A ( XM'fM FED-ERAL<br />
ELECTION?<br />
CRAY: WELL WAE HAVE AIAAYS DONE, MAT E BELIEVE WAS IN THE BEST INERESTS OF<br />
TASMaiNIA AND WHAT TASMAIAZS WANTED TO DO. AS I SAID, WE HAD A VERY CLEAR<br />
MANDATE AND TASMNANS UNDERTAND THAT THE ONLY REAkSON THT WE WMRI' 1T ABE<br />
TO flTLaUU THAT IAS THAT COVEVEINT l14 ANZTHER PlACE DECIDED THAT THEY<br />
THOUGHT IT OUG; HT TO BE STOPPED AND WEE SUCCESSFUL IN THE HIGH OURT. NUW<br />
I'M SURE THAT TASNLWIANS RECOGNISE THAT E DID THE BEST TO TPL-MNa7 THE<br />
POLICIES THAT THEY WANTED Ml ETED AD I THINK TiA'S ALL THAT ANY<br />
GOIUVMLT CkN BE ASKED TO DOD IS TO DO THEIR BEST AND WHM THEVE<br />
DONE TMAT, AS FAR AS THE FEDERAL ELECTION' S CONCMERN, WLL, TIME LIBERa<br />
PARTY tILL HOLD AJL FIVE HOUSE OF REPRSETiATIVES SEATS AND 14R HAE WILL<br />
( XQiME BACK THE ELECTION AFTE AND HAVE ANMoHER GO, I S SURE.<br />
HAX: WELL I CAN'T AVOID THE TJDThTATION OF RESPONDING TO THOSE LEAD LIES. IT'S<br />
VERY PLEASANT TO cWeI DONN HERE IN TASMAI TODAY AlD SEE THE HEADINES<br />
ON TIE HOBART MERCURY SH4TIGC THAT WE ARE 1%, LL N FRONT AS FAR AS FEDERAL<br />
SEATS ARE CONCERNED AND QUITE SERIOUSLY I TINK THAT POLL REFLECTS THE FACT<br />
THAT THE PEOPLE OF TASMANIA HAVE UDERSTOOD THE CM1XIThEW. THE SOLI4N<br />
COIaaTm? E I GAVE ON THE NIGHT OF 5th of march, IN PPSPECT OF THE<br />
PEOPLE OF TLA&amp; XANIA HAS BEEN HOOURED AiD THEME CAN BE NO DOUBT THAT ZIfE<br />
ADVERSE ENVIROITM THAT WE OPERATED qi IN TE LAST FEDERAL ELECTION IV;<br />
BEEN DPROVED AS FAR AS WE'RE CONCERNOD.<br />
QUFZrION:.<br />
A iWT OF uNDECIDED'S IN THOSE POLLS, THOUGH.<br />
HAWKE: yOU mICXJ Hw PousTERS ALCATE UNDECIDEDS Am) IT UsauALY iXS OUT wAu..<br />
THEY USUALLY ALIICATE TIII IN PROPORTIUON To THE WAY THAT PEOPLE HAVE<br />
ALREADY INDICATED. ON THAT BASIS WE HAVE REASON TO BE VERY VERY CONFIDfrT<br />
AND AFTER TAQANIAN HISTORICALLY HaE BEEN VERY SENSIBLE IN REGARD TO<br />
THEifl FEDERAL VOTING PATTERNS AND THERE HAVE BEW SLIGHT ABERRATIONS IN<br />
WE ARE RAPIDLY REThiNG TO TE SITUATION t{ ERE WE WILL PAVE, IF NOT<br />
ALL, AT LEAST A FAIR MAJORIIY Of THE FEDRAL SEATS. AND AFTER ALL, I<br />
ALWAYS BELIEVED AS DISTICT FROM OGlHES IN THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY, I'VE<br />
ALWAYS BELIEVED THAT TA&amp; ANIANS ARE AUSTRALIANS, AND THE CLEAR PATTERN<br />
OF THE AUSTRALIAN INTENTION IS TO INCREASE THE REERSENTATION OF' THIS<br />
OVERN'NM AFTER THE NEXT ELECTION. TP-TANIANS WILL BE LIl( THE REST OF<br />
AUSTRALIA. </p>
<p>CRAY IF THE HRO-ILEMIC CChMISSION HADN'T AEADY SPENT THIS MONEY AND I HAD<br />
IT IN MY POCLT, BOJ3, I'D PiT IT THE RESULT.<br />
MR GRAY'S ASKED FOR FAVOURABLE CONS IDRATION OF FISHING LICEN~ CES FOR<br />
TA2WTIA.... WHY HAVE YOU BEEN DOIM ZS?<br />
HAWKE WELL, SPEAKIG PERSONALLY, I'VE SAID TO MR CRAY TAT I AM TWEL DISPOSED<br />
TOCADS THE DESIRE OF TASIMNIA TO MfY AND GE SCME SHARE OF THESE NE<br />
FISHING VETURES, AND TO ( PURESS A PERSONAL VIE1 IT SMiS TO HE THAT<br />
TAS 4AIA DOES HAVE DISADVANTA(; ES, THROUGH ITS ISLMD STATUS AND THE<br />
EME4iT THAT THERE ARE DISADVAITAGES IN THE ISLA1D STATUS, IT SEn-JS TO HE<br />
FAIR IF WE CAN TO GIVE THR-1 SOME BMIKFIT 1, ROM THAT STATUS. I MADE IT<br />
CILAR TO THE PRER THAT IN THE DISCUSSIONS WITH THE mIISTmR FOR<br />
PRIMARY IIDUSTRY, THAT THAI ATITIJDE OF MME SHOULTD BE MADE M4N. AS<br />
THE PR~ xIER UNDERSTANDS THE RIGHTS OR THE COERN S OF OTHER STATES, NEW<br />
SOUTH WALES AD VrICORIA, HAVE TO BE, ALSO CONSIDEIM, BUT I REPEAT<br />
I HAD A DISPOSITION OF TIS IN THAT RESPECT AS WE POSSIBLY CAN.<br />
QUESTION: ONE FINAL QUESTION, ARE YOU DISAPPOINTED AT THE PAYM4ENT OF THIS ONEY<br />
WITH NO GUARANTEE FROM TASANIA THAT THE DAM WILL NEVER BE BUILT?<br />
MR HAWKE:<br />
WELL, WITH RESPECT TO THEP PRMLE, IT'S NOT IN ILS PROVINCE. 1THI HIGH COURT<br />
AS HE SAYS, IS THE HIGHEST COURT IN TM [ AND, HAS RUED ON THIS MVTTER. AND<br />
THAT IS THE POSITION. NOM I HAVE 1O REASON TO BELIEVE THAT THE HICH COURT CF<br />
AUSTRALIA IS GOING TO CHACE ITS RULIZG. WHIME THAT RULIMG STANDS, THEN<br />
THE POSITION IS THAT THE DM WILL NOT BE BUILT, AND THE PREMER IS NOT<br />
QUIBBLING ABOUT THAT. HE ACCE--PTS THE DECISION OF THE HIGH COURT.<br />
CRAY: THAT'S CX) RRECr SITUATION AND THE ONLY DIFFECE IS AS I UNDERSTD TMIl<br />
SITUATION, THE DECISION RESTS WITHT~ E MISER OF THE DAY AND A FJLUTJRE TNE<br />
A DIFFEREM IMISTER MIGHT PAVE A DFERET ATTITUDE, PUT FOR THE TIE<br />
BEING AT LEAST, THE DAM WILL NOT BE PROCEEDING AND THAT'S THE SITUATION,<br />
WE ACCEPT IT.<br />
QUESTION: IF THW DOES HAPPEN IF A FIUTMRE GOVME0NMt DID APPROVE THE DAM, WOULD YOU<br />
GIVE THIS EY BAUX TO THE CalOMWEALTH?<br />
GRAY: OH I DON'T KNOW, WE'D HAVE TO TAMK ABOUT THA, WOJDN'T WE.<br />
HAMPE: ONE, Tiiw THAT YOUj otii To LEARN ABOUT POLITCS IS THAT GETTING 1EI2CAGED IN<br />
HYPOTHESIS IS A VERY FRUITLESS, UNRISRDIN 4EMRCTSE AND I CAN ASSURE YOU<br />
YOU'RE IN ANWAY IN T= ING ABO'JT THE POSSIBILITY OF THE DAM.<br />
