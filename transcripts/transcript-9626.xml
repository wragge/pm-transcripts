PRIME MINISTER<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON PJ KEATING MP<br />
PEOPLE'S CONVENTION<br />
The Opposition Leader's latest position on his so-called " people's convention" is further<br />
confirmation that his plans are a blueprint for obfuscation.<br />
It is now absolutely clear that he has no intention of answering the simple question: does<br />
he believe Australia should have an Australian as its Head of State?<br />
He now says he is taking his convention a step further by claiming he would put its<br />
outcome to a referendum and a Howard Government would support it if his convention<br />
reached a consensus. But he would make half the appointments to the convention<br />
thereby determining himself whether he wished there to be a consensus or not.<br />
And a consensus about what? The external affairs power, four year terms, relations<br />
with the states? The Republic might not in this context even get a look in.<br />
Mr Howard is now saying that if no consensus is reached a full range of options would<br />
be put to the people including a choice for the present system or for a popularly elected<br />
President. This sounds like " pick-a-box" politics or a multiple choice test a referendum<br />
is a vote on a Government proposal, the question cannot be a set of choices.<br />
All of this is subterfuge to hide Mr Howard from making a real decision. It is a complete<br />
abrogation of leadership to suggest nothing and support nothing.<br />
Mr Howard does not want an Australian as our Head of State but he does not have the<br />
leadership strength to say it. Just as Mr Howard is trying to hide his economic and<br />
social policies from the Australian people so too is he trying to hide his position on the<br />
Republic.<br />
The Government will listen to the people before a referendum is put in 1998 or 1999<br />
and it will then be the people who will decide the future shape of an Australian<br />
Republic not a hand picked elitist meeting claiming to represent the nation.<br />
