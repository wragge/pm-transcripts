.,, QSTRALIA<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 8 NOVEMBER 1988<br />
The Queen has approved Letters Patent and Regulations<br />
establishing three Defence Force awards: the Australian<br />
Active Service Medal; the Australian Service Medal; and the<br />
Champion Shots Medal. The awards will form part of the<br />
Australian system of honours and awards.<br />
The Australian Active Service Medal will be used to<br />
recognise service in minor campaigns. Separate awards for<br />
service in major conflicts will be instituted, if and when<br />
the need arises in the future, in accordance with<br />
established tradition. The Australian Service Medal will be<br />
for service in peacekeeping and other military but non<br />
warlike operations and the Champion Shots Medal for annual<br />
rifle shooting contests in the Defence Force.<br />
The awards will be made by the Governor-General on the<br />
recommendation of the Minister for Defence. In the<br />
Australian order of Precedence of Honours and Awards<br />
gazetted on 2 November 1988 the Australian Active Service<br />
Medal is placed immediately before all existing war and<br />
campaign service medals. The Australian Service Medal is<br />
placed after all war and campaign medals and the Champion<br />
Shots Medal. is placed directly after the National Medal.<br />
The three awards are the first of the new range of<br />
Australian awards for Defence Force personnel, which I<br />
announced on Australia Day 1986. The introduction of the<br />
full range of awards will provide, for the first time, a<br />
national system of recognition of operational and<br />
non-operational service which will meet the requirements of<br />
the Defence Force far into the future. A further<br />
announcement will be made when the remaining awards receive<br />
The Queen's formal approval.<br />
