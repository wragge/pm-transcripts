FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE.<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER.<br />
VISIT OF HER ROYAL HIGHNESS PRINCESS MARINA,<br />
DUCHESS OF KENT.<br />
The Prime Minister announced in Canberra tonight<br />
that the following statement had been issued from Kensington<br />
Palace Quote Princess Marina, Duchess of Kent, has been<br />
invited by the Government of the Commonwealth<br />
of Australia to visit Australia in the autumn,<br />
and has accepted this invitation with great<br />
pleasure. The Princess will arrive in Australia towards<br />
the end of September, undertake a short visit<br />
to Canberra, and later stay for a few days in<br />
Sydney, where she will visit the British<br />
Exhibition. Unquote.<br />
The Prime Minister said that all Australians would<br />
warmly welcome the news of the proposed visit by Princess<br />
Marina. Princess Marina has had a place in the affections of<br />
the Australian people for many years. Australia had looked<br />
forward to welcoming her in 1938 as the wife of our Governor-<br />
General, but the war and the tragic death of the late Duke of<br />
Kent on active service intervened. The Prime Minister said<br />
that he, personally, knew that Australia and Australian affairs<br />
have been ondt of Her Royal Highness' interests for many years<br />
and, with the memorahle visit to Australia in 1959 of her<br />
daughter, Princess Alexandra, this interest greatly increased.<br />
Princess Marina would be assured of a very warm and sincere<br />
welcome. a .1/ 2. </p>

The Prime Minister said he was pleased that<br />
Princess Marina would be able to visit the British Exhibition<br />
in Sydney while she was in Australia.<br />
This will be a comparatively short visit and<br />
Princess Marina will be unable to visit States other than<br />
New South Wales. As is well known, the Prime Minister added,<br />
we have been aimine at short and limited Royal visits so that<br />
they may be more frequent.<br />
Consultations will take place to suggest an<br />
appropriate itinerary for Princess Marina's visit.<br />
