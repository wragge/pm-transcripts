    <content><![CDATA[<p><strong>30 October 1986 </strong></p>
<p>As foreshadowed in my media release of 10 September the President of Israel, His Excellency Mr Chaim Herzog, will soon be visiting Australia ais a guest of the Australian Government. President Herzog and Nrs Herzog will arrive in Canberra on Tuesday, 4 November and will depart from Australia on 10 November.</p>
<p>I look forward to welcoming President Herzog to Australia and regard his visit as an important opportunity to develop further the warm relationship which has historically existed between Australia and Israel.</p>
<p>President Herzog's host on his visit will be the Governor-General, Sir Ninian Stephen. During their stay in Australia President and Mrs Herzog will also be the guests of the Governors of New South Wales and Victoria.</p>
<p>President Herzog will also be meeting the Premiers of New South Wales and Victoria, Federal and State Ministers and a range of Jewish and other community groups.</p>
<p>In my own talks with President Herzog I will be interested in discussing the Australia/ Israel relationship, the Middle East situation, and other issues of broad international concern.</p>
