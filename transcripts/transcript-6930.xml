E O E PROOF ONLY<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF PRESS CONFERENCE AT THE MANILA HOTEL<br />
MANILA 25 MAY 1986<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, can you give us some indication<br />
of the discussions with Hu Yaobang, what were the nature<br />
of the discussions?<br />
PM: I can't go into all the details but I can say to you<br />
that we covered a broad range of relations involving China<br />
with the West, with the Soviet Union and with our own bilateral<br />
relationships. And he gave me his exposition of the way<br />
he and the leadership have China saw the current position<br />
in regard to those relations and their view of the future.<br />
Now there are a couple of aspects of those discussions<br />
which were by their nature confidential and I am not in<br />
a position to elaborate on them.<br />
JOURNALIST: Sir, bearing in mind our relationship or our<br />
position on the Security Council, was South Africa discussed,<br />
any South African initiatives put?<br />
PM: South Africa was mentioned and their position is clearly<br />
as you would expect as being in something of a leadership<br />
with the third world countries in. line with the sort of<br />
approach that we have adopted but. it would be misleading<br />
to suggest that it occupied a significant part of our discussion.<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you think as a result of these talks their<br />
will be any diplomatic action or initiatives taken with<br />
Australia individually or jointly with other countries<br />
and do you see these talks as the outlook for Australian<br />
foreign policy to any great extent?<br />
PM: I will take the second part first. I can't see that<br />
as a result of these talks that there will be any change<br />
in direction of Australia's foreign policy. For that to<br />
be the outcome you would have expected that there were<br />
some issues on which we had differences of opinion and<br />
that we were therefore either going to convert China or<br />
we were going to be converted ourselves. The great benefit<br />
of the relationship that we have is that there is considerable<br />
identity of positions in regard to bilateral and regional </p>
<p>and global matters that substantial identity was confirmed<br />
in these talks. So no, Paul, I don't see new directions.<br />
What 1 do see, which I think is of importance, is the confirmation<br />
of the position between us that it was appropriate because<br />
of what I have said, because of the substantial identity<br />
of views that we have on this wide range issues that we<br />
should increase the level of consultation that we have.<br />
And this really to be done in these ways, the consultation<br />
that takes place in the forums and between our representatives<br />
should continue and be strengthened and a suggestion that<br />
there should be even more interchange of correspondence<br />
between us at the leadership level on particular issues<br />
and that certainly something that we will be doing.<br />
JOURNALIST: What kind of issues are you talking about?<br />
PM: Well, just let me give you an example Mike, take the<br />
question of the Committee on Disarmament and the Comprehensive<br />
Test Ban Treaty. In that area wie think it appropriate that<br />
we should have even closer consultation. The Chinese for<br />
instance, also have, I think, a growing interest in the<br />
South Pacific region and so I think we would be moving<br />
to keep them even more closely informed about developments<br />
there. They were very appreciative of the initiative that<br />
I took at the last forum of indicating to the forum countries<br />
the fact of China's growing interest in the South Pacific<br />
region and our preparedness to act if you like as an intermediary,<br />
an introducer of China to the countries of the South Pacific<br />
region. Those facts you may recall are noticed in the South<br />
Pacific Forum Communique. Anid I have undertaken tb continue<br />
to advance the notification of their interest to the countries<br />
of the forum. So I use those sorts of examples and it is<br />
not intended to be exhaustive in any way.<br />
JOURNALIST: Did you get any indication from<br />
the Chinese that they might scale down development of their<br />
own nuclear program other than the announcement they have<br />
made not to go ahead with atmospheric nuclear tests?<br />
PM: You mean their program for peaceful purposes, the<br />
generation of power you mean?<br />
PM: No, I meant the development of nuclear weapons.<br />
PM: No. no indication in that area other than within the<br />
general statement of commitment that they share with us<br />
to the desire to create a position in which there will<br />
be a move on the part of the two super powers to move to<br />
further talks to bring about a reduction in the level of<br />
nuclear arms. They identify with our position in that area<br />
and to the extent that there was as a result of those discussions<br />
and other initiatives in international forums an increase<br />
in the thrust towards disarmament particularly in the nuclear<br />
area, China would identify with that thrust but apart from<br />
that, no. there was nothing. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Mir Hawke, can I quote from yesterday's China<br />
D~ aily in which there is a storey that says that Pakistan's<br />
President said here on Thursday that the development<br />
of relations between Pakistan and China has provided<br />
a model for the rest of the world on peaceful co-existence<br />
between countries of different social systems. That has<br />
a familiar ring to it, does it suggest that this is a consistent<br />
diplomatic line that the Chinese use?<br />
PM: You are saying that the President of Pakistan said<br />
that.<br />
JOURNALIST: The President of Pakistan said that the relationship<br />
between Pakistan and China<br />
PM: Yes, I heard what you said. If the President of Pakistan<br />
said that I am glad he is saying it. I think if they can<br />
develop good or better relations we welcome that. We don't<br />
seek to have a monopoly good relations with C hina and<br />
you wouldn't say that our system was identical with that<br />
of Pakistan. Now when I talk about and the Chinese talk<br />
about model constituted by that between Australia and China,<br />
we are talking about. in our case, a parliamentary democracy,<br />
Now, by now stretch of the imagination or the English language<br />
does that apply to Pakistan. So there will be obviously<br />
a number of models and I have no reason and I am sure the<br />
Chinese have no reason to change the statement we have<br />
made in regard to the appropriateness of our model for<br />
our system.<br />
PM: Prime Minister, did you discuss the Chinese relationship<br />
with the Soviet Union and if so did you perceive any change?<br />
PM: There were discussions particularly with Hu Yaobang<br />
although not exclusively with him on this issue. There<br />
were some elements of the discussion which I am not at<br />
liberty to go to. But I think I can fairly say this that<br />
the position of the Chinese leadership is that they are<br />
consciously liftingl the level of the economic and commercial<br />
relationship and they see th at as beneficial to them and<br />
of some benefit to the Soviet Union. But they are quite<br />
clear that that lifting of the economic relationship does<br />
not involve a normalisation of the political relationship.<br />
The three obstacles are clearly not merely a matter of<br />
political rhetoric with the Chinese leadership. Anid those<br />
three obstacles as you know are the substantial presence<br />
of Soviet military forces on their border-, the occupation<br />
of Afghanistan and their presence in Vietnam. Those three<br />
issues are ( if quite fundamental significance to China and<br />
while those three obstacles remain then I believe that<br />
they are studying the position as it is and they state,<br />
yes, an improvement in economic relationships but no normalisation<br />
of the political relationship.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, did you cover with Mr Hu relations<br />
with Indonesia because China has not got on well with Jakarta<br />
for many years and we have been having our concerns. Did<br />
you cover these particular problems each country is having? </p>
<p>PM: There was a reference to the region and Indonesia<br />
did get mentioned but it would be quite wrong to say in<br />
answer to your question that was any detailed discussion<br />
on the points you raised.<br />
JOURANLIST: Do you think we have any role at all to play<br />
in the relationship between China and the United States<br />
and what was discussed?<br />
PM: Well, you would know that out of my previous meetings,<br />
the earliest meetings in 1983 that we did raise with the<br />
United States the question of the then current United States<br />
position towards China on the exchange of technology where<br />
China was categorised in the same group as the Soviet Union.<br />
Now we raised that matter and following but I am not saying<br />
exclusively as a result of our representations the categorisation<br />
by the United States of China was changed to friendly but<br />
not allied country. And there was an increase in the exchange<br />
of technology. So it is the case that from the very beginning<br />
of the relationship with China under my Government starting<br />
in 1983, we have seen it as appropriate to use our particular<br />
relatinship with the United States to advance the cause<br />
of closer China/ United States relations. And in the discussinsw<br />
that I had on this occasion without in any sense going<br />
into details because I am not going to, it is. quite clear<br />
that there is a continuation by me on behalf of the Australian<br />
Government and people to use that relationship that we<br />
have with the United States to expound the positions of<br />
China because quite clearly it makes sense of the regional<br />
and global perspectives that one would have to see as far<br />
as one can an improvement in the relations between the<br />
United States-anid China. It is in the interests of the<br />
two countries. It is certainly in our interest that ' understanding<br />
and relationship should improve. And I think my discussions<br />
with the Chinese leadership have left me with the impression<br />
that while there are still some areas of difficulty if<br />
you like that you would have to say that there is I think<br />
a gradual improvement in the relationship between the two<br />
countries and I think that is a very-useful thing.<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you think that the Reagan Administration<br />
has taken advantage of the potential relationship it, could<br />
have with China or do you think it has been a bit. slow?<br />
PM: L think that it will always argue in respect of most<br />
countries with the exception of our own that there could<br />
ha-ve been an earlier and deeper understanding of the significance<br />
of what is happening in China. I think I have said to some<br />
of you before that as far as the United States generally<br />
and not just the Administration that I am somewhat surprised<br />
to government that there hadn't been an earlier<br />
understanding of the dimension anid the significance of<br />
the changes that are taking place in China. I think therefore<br />
it is true to say of the Administration that perhaps that<br />
has been a little slower than one would have expected. </p>
<p>But now it is the case 1 think that the United States<br />
Administration does have a clear picture of the importance<br />
of these changes. Anid at the level of not only the<br />
Administration but 1 think the American business community<br />
there is a growing perception of the importance of China.<br />
So my view is yes, perhaps some original tardiness in perception<br />
but I think i~ t is fairly clear now.<br />
.1rUrA. LS1Mr Hawke, when you were in Japan did you alert the<br />
Japanese leadership of the prospect of a significant<br />
upgrading of Australia's ties with China on this visit<br />
and if so what was their reaction?<br />
PM: I don't know that alert is the right word. I think<br />
if there were any attempt to make a secret of my perception<br />
of the importance of Australia's relations with China and<br />
my commitment to upgrade them it would have to be the worst<br />
kept secret of all time. And so I was quite straight forward<br />
in my discussions with the Japanese in letting them know<br />
the importance that we attach to this relationship, our<br />
intention to strengthen that relationship and that was<br />
I think welcomed by Mr Nakasone and in fact he pointed<br />
out to me the importance that he and his Government attach<br />
to China. He said Further that he thought that the relationship<br />
between China and Japan was improving and further he asked<br />
me to convey his best wishes to the Chinese leadership<br />
which I did.<br />
JOURNALIST: Just going back to the question of Indonesia.<br />
Do you think that the increasing warmth that the relationship<br />
with China coming after the problems Australia has had<br />
with Indonesia recently could be misinterpreted in Indonesia<br />
and could aggravate the difficulties......<br />
PM: I don't think so Michelle, I think there is a clear<br />
enough understanding that what has happened in the Australian<br />
/ Indonesian-relationship has been at the government to<br />
Government level initiated by the Indonesians and not by<br />
Australia. So if there have been changes and of course<br />
there have been then they understand that the responsibility<br />
at a government to government level fo~ r those changes rests<br />
with the Indonesian Government. They do not and cannot<br />
expect that I am going to, on behalf of the Australian<br />
Government, conduct relations with other countries on the<br />
basis of whether. Indonesia will. have some reaction to those<br />
developments-which I see as intrinsically important for<br />
Australia's interests and nor have I had that intention.<br />
As far as I am concerned the reasons for the work that<br />
we are putting into developing the Australia/ China relation<br />
are clear, they are correct, they will remain relevant<br />
into the foreseeable future and we will therefore pursue<br />
those interests for those correct reasons. They are not<br />
being pursued with any intention of setting off that relationship<br />
against another country whether it be Japan, if you remember<br />
I was asked that question at the conference in Tokyo. It<br />
has not been done for that reason nor has it been done<br />
for some compensatory reason.... Indonesian relationship. </p>
<p>It is simply the fact that by any sensible and intelligent<br />
appraisal of Australia's interests we must see what is<br />
happening in China as a fundamental importance. It is in<br />
the . best interests of Australia, China, the region and<br />
globally that we do what we can to strengthen the relationship. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, at the end of the week in China<br />
what are your views about the workability of Communism as a<br />
system of Government? Do you think it would work in Australia<br />
today?<br />
PM: Well, what I think, the most useful way of answering a<br />
question which I think if I may so, an important question<br />
is not in a sense my percpetion, not immediately, I'll come<br />
to it but rather the perception of the Chinese themselves,<br />
I. think it's fair to say that the Chinese leadership, which is<br />
now quite clearly extends, you know, throughout the Country,<br />
when I talk about the Chinese leadership I'm not talking simply<br />
about Chairman Deng, General-Secretary Hu Yao-Bang, Premier<br />
Zhou or Secretary H-u Qi Li but quite clearly the case is now<br />
that the leadership throughout China at all-levels has accepted<br />
and embraced the concepts that have been espoused by the central<br />
leadership, so, ( I put that in bi-parenthesis) the Chinese<br />
leadership, in that sense, have demonstrated an admirable<br />
flexibility in their concepts of socialism. I think it's<br />
important, first of all, to make the point that there remains<br />
a committment to certain basic principles of socialism as they<br />
see them and that is firstly, that major areas of the economy,<br />
as I think I said to one or two of you on the plane, if you<br />
use the language of the commanding heights of<br />
the economy, I think they remain committed to the view that<br />
those should be totally retained within the area of public<br />
ownership and direction, and as far as the ownership of land<br />
is concerned, basically, that should remain within public<br />
ownership. Now, within a committment to those basic concepts,<br />
they have demonstrated a continuing flexibility as to the<br />
administration of the economy without being exhaustive about<br />
it let's pick up these elements. They see as significant a<br />
continuing devolution of responsibility for decision-making<br />
to the level of the enterprise. Where previously direction<br />
as to types of activity, levels of investment and rewards for<br />
participants there is this now increasing devolution<br />
of that decision-making to the enterprise. That they can,<br />
instead of all the profit of the enterprise just being taken<br />
by the centre, they will be able to make decisions on how<br />
they use that profit in terms of new investment, in terms of<br />
degrees of reward to those engaged in the enterprise and so on.<br />
They are also moving much ' More to indirect forms of translating<br />
the central objectives rather than direct forms of control and<br />
the concept of incentive is being extended now from the rural<br />
economy where it's being outstandingly successful, that's being<br />
extended increasingly to the urban economy. Now associated<br />
with that is-a committment to continuation and extension of the<br />
open door, utilisation of * the technology, the capital of the<br />
West, particularly in an increasing number of joint ventures,<br />
so that this flexibility which they are demonstrating shows<br />
that they abandon, if you like, an earlier and sterile committment.<br />
to the rigidities of Marxist-Leninist dogma. So, I think the<br />
important answer to your question is that they have shown<br />
considerable flexibility. They would still say that this a<br />
flaw of socialism adapted to the needs of China and I think </p>
<p>they mean that and they have that committment. The important<br />
thing from the point of view of Australia, and I believe of<br />
the World community, is that the flexibility that they are<br />
showing, means a committment to co-operation with the rest<br />
of the World. The quite damaging closing off of one-quarter<br />
of the World's population which had characterised an earlier<br />
period before the ' reforms of the sixth five year plan and<br />
now into the seventh five year plan, that's come to an end.<br />
It was obviously deleterious for the World that that large<br />
proportion of it's population was closed off. Secondly,<br />
it is tremendously important, I believe, for the rest of the<br />
World that they, the leadership of China, sees an internationally<br />
and regionally peaceful environment as the fundamental condition<br />
for the achievement of their reforms. They understand quite<br />
clearly that it will not be possible to reach or surpass the<br />
targets they have set themselves for the rest of this century<br />
and into the first half of the twenty-first century, if there<br />
is not World peace. And so, you're going to see an increasing<br />
involvement, I believe, of China in the Third World forces in<br />
the relevant international forum, to help to create an environment<br />
of peace. Now I don't believe in any of these things,<br />
either in the way in which they're going about their internal<br />
economic and political reforms or their perceptions of their<br />
place, increasing place, in the World. That they find themselves<br />
constrained by saying, is this in accordance with some preconception<br />
about communism or socialism and I find this extraordinarily<br />
satisfying and reassuring as far as the rest of the<br />
World is concerned. Sorry for the length of the answer but<br />
I hope it picks up the sort of things<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, just following on from that, did they<br />
talk at all about possible tensions that may emerge in their<br />
Country as a result of these developments?<br />
PM: I think one of the most refreshing things about listening<br />
to and talking with the Chinese leadership and I think you<br />
know I've had a, as they say, an unparallelled opportunity<br />
both in terms of length and in depth with the leadership of<br />
China, is that they recognise the problems and the constraints<br />
that are involved in what they are about. They don't see it<br />
as a straightforward uncomplicated path. They recognise for all,<br />
both in terms of party organisation anid public education, that<br />
it * will need to be worked on to ensure there is a growing understanding<br />
amongst the people of China as to both the directions<br />
and the purposes of the reforms. I think that what is reassurin g<br />
is that, and I had a better opportunity on this occasion than in<br />
' 84, when you go out to the regions, and we in fact saw, in the<br />
four provinces we met, as I've said, with over a quarter of the<br />
population of China, you can see that there is a reflection at<br />
the regional and lower levels of the leadership of these places,<br />
as you talk not just to governors but to mayors and other<br />
officials and they are enthusiastically going about the task<br />
of not merely implementing a central doctrine, if you like, a<br />
centrally conceived doctrine, they embrace it. Now I think<br />
it' s not just being a question made and saying, well look, they're<br />
saying these things, you can, I think intelligently, apply the<br />
tests about what you hear them saying because you can see, and<br />
it's natural enough, that they appreciate the devolution </p>
<p>of decision-making, the devolution of responsibility. Tihey<br />
are responding to those challenges that are created, you can<br />
see when you're talking to them that they have great p: JAd<br />
in referring to the levels of increase that have taken uL; I-:_ e<br />
in the sixth five year plan, the way in which they are<br />
approaching the task of trying to meet and surpass the sorts<br />
of targets for the future and also what's interesting is<br />
you see the different levels of economic achievement of<br />
economic wealth. For instance, you go to Szechuan' and you<br />
see that, while they were in the forefront of the reforms<br />
in the agricultural area, they are not at the same level of<br />
per capita income as in the prosperous eastern provinces and<br />
they see themselves as having a responsibility of accelerating<br />
the reforms so that they can lift their-people to these high<br />
levels. So, it's clearly not a question of rhetoric, it is<br />
a question of it happenning and happenning, I think, with a<br />
remarkable degree of integration between the centre and the<br />
provinces, and when you think about, how do you run a vast<br />
country like that of a billion people, you know it's mind<br />
boggling and yet it is working with an appropriate degree,<br />
I think, of responsibility between the centre and the regions.<br />
That part of my answer goes to, if you like, the concept of<br />
economic management. I think, at the level of political<br />
organisation, there are conscious plans to see--that the party<br />
mechanisms are developed in a way which reflects the economic<br />
-imperatives as well. Just let me give you this example. Mir<br />
Hu Qi Li was saying to me that the main work that he's now<br />
involved upon is preparing for the meeting in September of<br />
the Congress of the Central Committee, which involves some<br />
320-odd people. Now, what he is doing is getting the documents<br />
prepared f'or that and he said what he wants to do is ensure<br />
that those are prepared as soon as possible so that they can<br />
go out to the provinces and the regions, so that they will<br />
have the opportunity of analysing those documents, which is<br />
looking at the . immediate next period, as to what needs to be<br />
done, so that they will have the opportunity of analysing themd<br />
and by the time they come to the meeting in September, will be<br />
well prepared so that they can make their contributions<br />
of the task their task at the Centre will be to take account<br />
of. what will then be very considerecL--observations for suggested<br />
amendments from representatives around. China and then finalise<br />
for the next period, the-sort of details........ approached.* Now<br />
it seems to me, again I apologise for. the length of the answer<br />
but I think it's relevant to the concept-about " Do you see<br />
problems They are aware of the need to involve leadership<br />
right throughout in the economic reform as the process is so<br />
that there is this degree of involvement, to which I refer.<br />
So, that's what find refreshing, that in a country of the just<br />
unbelievable complexity of a billion people, of that size, with<br />
different levels of development, that they do seem with an<br />
extraordinary degree of intelligence and sensitivity to be making<br />
the sorts of decisions which are necessary to cope with the<br />
undoubted problems that will arise.<br />
I </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, will you be indicating to Mrs Aquino<br />
that the Australian Government would like to see American<br />
facilities remain in the Philippines when renegotiation comes up?<br />
PM: I'd be more than happy to answer that question after<br />
I've spoken to Mrs Aq uino. I think it's more appropriate that<br />
I have the discussion with her, but I think you could expect<br />
that, given the position of the Australian Government where<br />
we have made the conscious, deliberate decision to host the<br />
joint facilities for reasons of our perception of their importance<br />
in the global framework of stable mutual deterrents, having<br />
made that decision ourselves, we would see it as appropriate<br />
here. JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, did the Chinese leadership express to<br />
you the particular concern about Soviet activities in the<br />
Pacific, particularly the South Pacific? If so, what were<br />
the nature of<br />
PM: I did have some discussion with them about this and I<br />
put the view, Jeff, that we did have a concern about this.<br />
We were not exaggerating the nature of the problem and I think<br />
it's fair to say that' s a perception which recommended itself<br />
to the Chinese leadership.<br />
JOURNALIST: What will Australia do to increase our access for<br />
Chinese products, particularly clothing textiles......?<br />
PM: I think these things are relatively said there. Firstly,<br />
we reached agreement, Mike, on establishing a joint ministerial<br />
committee on trade and economic relations. That committee<br />
will not ignore, in fact it will draw upon, the resources currently<br />
involved in the various sectoral areas of co-operation now<br />
existing. On both sides we hear about by senior minister in<br />
the economic area and the purpose of that committee will be<br />
to ensure an adequate coordination of the various economic<br />
initiatives and activity to keep the progress in these areas<br />
under review, to identify projects for concessional finance<br />
and in that way*........ committee will, as part of its responsibilities<br />
try and ensure that, at our end, there is a co-ordination<br />
of the efforts to increase the opportunities of access by<br />
China to our growing import market. So that's the first<br />
general answer. SecondlylI indicated to them that wewill<br />
continue and try and increase the work under the China Action<br />
Plan whereby we provide facilities to China to examine in<br />
detail the structure of our imports and to see what sort of<br />
particular work may need to be done to ensure the appropriateness<br />
and relevance of Chinese products for that market. And<br />
we will I said to them if there is any particular aspects<br />
of that China Action Program to which we ' ye now added quite<br />
a considerable amount of money, if there are any aspects of<br />
that which they, on their examination, would like to see<br />
improved, then we stand ready to receive recommendations from<br />
them and I think it's fair to say, Mike, that they expressed<br />
their satisfaction with the committment of the Australian<br />
Government to these processes. What their position is on the<br />
question of the bilateral trading relationship is this; they </p>
<p>11.<br />
recognise the imbalance that currently exists. They don't<br />
suggest that we can be moving in any immediate way to removing<br />
that imbalance, rather, they want to see a growth in trade,<br />
a significant growth in trade, but within that process of the<br />
growth in trade a relatively greater increase in the level<br />
of exports from China. So that there is, without an elimination<br />
of the gap a narrowing of it. </p>
<p>/ Z<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke. you are returning to Australia in<br />
a day, have you had or are you planning to have any discussions<br />
with your ministers over the weekend about the issues......<br />
PM: I might be having some phone discussions before I<br />
leave here but Mr Bowen will be meeting me on my return.<br />
I have will have a discussion with him tomorrow night on<br />
my return and then we will be meeting with ministers on<br />
Tuesday. JOURNALIST: Will you be talking with Mr Keating?<br />
PM: Before I leave here?<br />
JOURNALIST: Yes.<br />
PM: I don't think so, I don't know, maybe.<br />
JOURNALIST: I wonder if I could just clarify that prevn' 01.<br />
answer. Can you tell us which economic minister you would<br />
anticipate heading up this from the Australian side and<br />
secondly, on footwear, clothing and textiles can we take<br />
it that what you are saying amounts to a commitment that<br />
protections would : in fact be reduced in the next plan?<br />
PM: I will take the two questions in turn. I have made<br />
no decision in regaird to the minister at this point. Obviously<br />
I will be discussing this whole question with the-Cabinet<br />
when I return and that decision will be made then. As to<br />
the second, what specifically we will be doing on the textile,<br />
clothing and footwear plan for the post-88 period has got<br />
to be decided on the receipt of the final report and the<br />
consideration of the final report by the IAC. We will be<br />
considering that but I have already said publicly as you<br />
will recall, I think it was included in the Nanjing speech,<br />
that clearly the post-88 plan must involve a program of<br />
reduction in protection.<br />
