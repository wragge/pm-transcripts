PRESS STATEMENT NO. 113<br />
23 JULY 1973.<br />
EQUAL PAY AUSTRALIAN PUBLIC SERVICE<br />
The Prime Minister drew attention to the recent<br />
decision of the Australian Labor Party which endorsed the<br />
principle of equal pay to all eligible females employed by<br />
the Australian Government Service without any phasing in of<br />
the pay increases as is the case in private employment.<br />
The Prime Minister said that the Government<br />
supported the principle of implementing equal pay without<br />
phasing in. In the Government's view, this principal should<br />
also be applied generally throughout industry.<br />
The Prime Minister said that the Government's<br />
policy decision had been conveyed to the Public Service Board.<br />
In the light of its responsibilities under the Public Service<br />
Act, the Board has been requested to ensure that equal pay<br />
without phasing in was applied to those categories of eligible<br />
female staff affected by the December 1972 decision of the<br />
Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. The Prime Minister<br />
also said that the Government's policy decision related only<br />
to the method of implementing equal pay and not to the level<br />
of pay itself, which was a matter for the Public Service Board. </p>
