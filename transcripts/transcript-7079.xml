PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF SPEECH AT PELLA. JORDAN, 25 JANUARY 1987<br />
E. 0 E -PROOF ONLY<br />
PM: Thank you Basil. I would just like to say on behalf of Hazel<br />
and myself and I am sure the whole party, two things really.<br />
How interested we are in what you are doing. But secondly, which<br />
flows from that, how proud we are of what you are doing. You<br />
ayhave gathered that as far as I am concerned and the Government<br />
is concerned, we have a very warm relationship with the Government<br />
and the people of Jordan. And it is extremely satisfying to me<br />
Basil, to see here in such a practical way a group of Australians<br />
is working in association with the Jordanian Government and people<br />
to do work which is, I think, immeasurable in its value. And<br />
that it is a group of Australians, gives me a very great sense<br />
of pride. So rather than just being a politician who is saying<br />
I am proud and it is nice I thought I would try and be a bit more<br />
practical than that and promise you two things that would be of<br />
value to you. I am not quite sure of what the order of importance<br />
is to you but I will put them in this order and you can make it<br />
either ascending or descending order. Firstly. I understand that<br />
while you are battlers you are prepared to live in adversity<br />
under tough circumstances, like pioneers there is one thing<br />
up without you will not put and that is Vegemite and that you<br />
are down on supplies of Vegemiter. So I hereby give you a solemn<br />
non pol-itician's undertaking to see tM~ t -you-get a -good supply<br />
of Vegemite sent to you. Secondly, you have told me and I was<br />
surprised, that you really only operate for basically about 3<br />
months of the year and then it is closed down. And that that<br />
means that there is an enormous backlog of work that accumulates<br />
and that you would be able to operate very, very much more<br />
efficiently if you had the wherewithall to have a couple of people<br />
here fulitime. I asked you ideally what you would like to see<br />
and you said if you could have a couple of people here to do that,<br />
to continue the cataloguing of work that is done that would make<br />
life easier but more importantly it would make it more efficient.<br />
The second undertaking I give you is that I will, on my return<br />
to Australia, undertake to find from my contacts.. within the private<br />
sector $ 30,000 a year so that you can do that.<br />
ends -r </p>
