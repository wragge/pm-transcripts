" PHILLIP EL7CTOPATE GARDEN Pl. RTY<br />
ROSF BAY, N. S. W<br />
Speech by the Prime Minister, the Rt. Hon. WTJilliam McMahori<br />
CH, 4MP<br />
Thanks! Dr Derek Freeman for your very kind welcome, and<br />
thanks Frank Theeman and your charming wife for your kindness and<br />
generosity and for inviting us all to enjoy your hospitality this<br />
afternoon. I am delighted to see so many of you here today. Like you,<br />
my main purpose is to lend the strongest support I can to Bill<br />
Aston and the Liberal Party in Phillip.<br />
Bill has been an outstanding Liberal and has occupied the<br />
high office of Speaker with distinction and authority for so long.<br />
So we are all here this afternoon to make sure that when our<br />
Speaker is returned, it will be with the kind of majority he richly<br />
deserves. Amongst us today, there are representatives of the Liberal<br />
Party as a whole Federal and State politicians, officials of the<br />
Liberal Party organisations, "-nch officers, Party members and<br />
strong supporters. I am glad, too, that this Garden Party is<br />
being held in Leslie Bury's territory. Because this is teamwork<br />
in operation and that is one of the great contrasts between the<br />
Liberal Party and our opponents. Unity, loyalty and teamwork are<br />
our insurance policy for success.<br />
In the past few days, we have seen the confirmation of the<br />
swing back of support to the Government. Our support is rising,<br />
and it will be much higher later on in the year as confidence<br />
srrgcs ahead. I ask you to redouble your efforts at the Branch and<br />
organisational level in the coming months. Now is the time to<br />
spread our campaigning and our support throughout the community.<br />
Our policy positions are sound. We have a first--rate story<br />
to tell. It is a story of constructive achievement and imaginative<br />
action. I say let's get on with it as one team and with one voice.<br />
Don't let us be diverted or distracted by side issues or irrelevancies.<br />
We must fight and win on our grounds on the the-nes of our<br />
choice with our timing and with complete unity of purpose.<br />
By way of contrast, our opponents are uniquely vulnerable<br />
this year on just about every main issue that Australiais are<br />
concerned about.<br />
On the other hand, we are strengthened by our policies and<br />
accumulated practical experience of many years of proven record in<br />
government. / 2 </p>
<p>-2<br />
We-lal know there -ar. very real and unbridgeable differences<br />
between our policies and the aressed-up impractical proposals of-..<br />
Labor. Ours arc the practical-policies of a Government which<br />
knows how to implement and finance them.<br />
The Labor Party is completely confused, even on agreeing<br />
what their own policies are, let alone on how they would implement,<br />
administer and finance them.<br />
Let me illustrate this today in three vital areas of<br />
community and national life in our management of the nAtional<br />
economy, in the vital area of education, and in CommonY4-lth/<br />
State relations. First of all, the economy. In common with many nations,<br />
we have in the rast few years, faced new types of economic<br />
problems, problems which have not been as amenable to the traditional<br />
responses and adjustments f previous years.<br />
In the face of this, wc have been prepared to be more<br />
flexible than we have ever been before. We had to frvoL!-<br />
acknowledge where predictions wgere not being borne out, to be<br />
ready to correct trends as they emerged and to adjust our<br />
economic strategy accordingly. We adopted a flexible and very<br />
responsive stance and T think it is now paying off.<br />
We took a series of actions in the second half of last<br />
year, starting with monetary pclicy. Most recently, there<br />
was the mini-Budget which will 2rovide a big li: t in deas'. d, and<br />
in confidence. This was active . nd positive decision-making<br />
in the highest area of government.<br />
Then there is education, and with it the desire to help<br />
in a very substantial way both Government and independent<br />
schools. Last December, I announced a special 120 million emergency<br />
grant to the States. it was the first time the Commonwealth had<br />
moved specifically to provide grants for classroom construction at<br />
primary and secondary schools.<br />
Then at the beginning of the year, we announced increases<br />
in the per capita grants to indep'endent schools. Then a few<br />
days ago, details were given to the Parliament of what I called<br />
imaginative proposals to introduce certainty in planning as between<br />
the Commonwealth, the States and the schools, and to make both<br />
grants for capital construction and per capita assistance part of<br />
permanent Commonwealth/ State education policy.<br />
We announced a fivee-year programme of $ 215 million for<br />
school building, and with it arrangements that are designed to<br />
meet up to 40 per cent of independent school running costs.<br />
This continued a policy our Government started in 1963, when<br />
the Commonwealth first approved the science laboratory plan for<br />
Government and non-Government schools. / 3 I </p>
<p>-3-<br />
I am p~ roud to s.-av that right frorr th-a beginning, I have<br />
tae nv. part in tho-fo--ruation of1 this scheme. Our<br />
obiective thcn was -~ 4gvio0-oa d and -adequato education<br />
to all Austrailian ch6, ildren in all Australian scho-ols. It is<br />
still my own and the Liberal Party's objective and I think We<br />
are getting a great deal closer to our goals3.<br />
Last, let me mention Cormonwealth/ State relationships.<br />
We apnroached the most recent Premiers' Confercnce at three<br />
levels 1. A very substantial increase in financial assistance<br />
to thec State Governments and to local and sem. 4-<br />
Government autho~ rities. New South Wales was particularly<br />
Wol). treated.<br />
2. Substantial inCreases in uncmpioymcnt benefits and<br />
for unemployment in rural areas.<br />
3. A71ssistanco to the free entcr-risc systom. We restored<br />
thi( iLnvestmcnt -lol~~ anteer aonnd a nnounced a new<br />
and better research a-nd investment sc~ ierne for industry.<br />
These three illustratirins are -ocsitivo cxamoles of an<br />
active Government a G3overnment -f decisi ) n in tho areas that<br />
count, in tho are. as that meian much to us all.<br />
This is the message we; c must get across. With teamleork<br />
we can. Members arc not sitting in Canberra watching opinion<br />
rolls. We are imnroving and introducing -practical policies,<br />
policies designed to makc this a stronger, richer, more3 Australian<br />
and exciting nation. </p>
