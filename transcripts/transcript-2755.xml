) PRIME MINISTER PRESS STATEMlET NO. 23<br />
17 December 1972<br />
PIREFERENCE TO AUSTRALIAN SUPPLIERS<br />
The Prime inister, Mr. Whitlam, announced today a new<br />
system of preference to Australian suppliers in purchases by<br />
the Australian Government.<br />
He has directed that Australian Government contracts should<br />
be awarded to an Australian-owned company in cases where Australian<br />
and overseas-owned firms submit tenders which meet specifications<br />
and are equal in respect of price and availability.<br />
This represents a change from present procedures for<br />
selecting successful tendererso<br />
The present practice in most cases in which equal tenders<br />
are submitted is to accept the tenderer who has been the most<br />
recent satisfactory supplier of identical supplies.<br />
His decision follows discussions between Government<br />
departments, held to ensure that future purchasing arrangements<br />
for the Australian Government would take into account the question<br />
of Australian ownership and control.<br />
Mr. Thitlam1 has also ordered that a study be made of future<br />
arrangements which might apply to the purchase of petroleum products<br />
from Australian-owned and controlled companies.<br />
Mr. '; Thitlam said current contracts for petroleum products<br />
will not expire before the end of 1973.<br />
In his election policy speech, Mr. Whitlam pledged that<br />
the Labor Government will give a lead to maximising Australian<br />
ownership and control of the oil industry by ensuring that where<br />
price, availability and accessibility are as good, the Commonwealth<br />
will make its purchases from Australian-owned and controlled<br />
companies. CANBERRA. A. C. T. </p>
