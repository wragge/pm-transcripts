PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF UNEDITED INTERVIEW WITH PAUL LYNEHAM, 7.30<br />
REPORT, 13 DECEMBER 1989<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
LYNEHAM: Prime Minister, thanks for joining us.<br />
PM: Pleasure.<br />
LYNEHAM: Well you're heading for the holidays at the end<br />
of this week with the mortgage rates still at 17% and<br />
according to today's Morgan Gallup Poll you're 2-1/ 2%<br />
behind the Opposition. It's not much of a Christmas<br />
present really is it?<br />
PM: Well, I'm not going off to the break in any sense of<br />
depression. I watch the polls with interests, as you<br />
know, and I don't get carried away when I'm down, I don't<br />
get exuberant when I'm up. I believe that we've shown as<br />
we come to the end of this year that we are still a<br />
tough, resilient, decision making Government and the<br />
contrast with the alternative is becoming starker and<br />
starker, I believe.<br />
LYNEHAM: Of course if we rely on your forecast of last<br />
January, just before the Western Australian election that<br />
interest rates would fall this year, we're due for some<br />
sort of economic miracle between now and new year's eve,<br />
are we?<br />
PM: Well, I've got nothing more to say about interest<br />
rates. I've made my position quite clear about them.<br />
The important thing there is that we' re making the<br />
decisions-LYNEHAM: You did say it, Prime Minister.<br />
PM: Well I said it then and as I've said before every<br />
economic forecaster in the country public and privateunderestimated<br />
the strength in demand in the country. So<br />
I'm with everyone else in that respect. I simply say<br />
that we're making the right decisions, sticking to the<br />
hard policies which are necessary to create the<br />
conditions for a fall in interest rates.<br />
LYNEHAM: Do you regret saying it? </p>
<p>PM: No, I think in the circumstances where I was asked<br />
to make a comment, I did it in good faith in the light of<br />
the assessment that every economist was making at that<br />
time, every economist.<br />
LYNEHAM: Because your critics will say it's another<br />
version of Hawke shooting from the lip, like no child<br />
shall live in poverty. You've only got 18 days to pull<br />
that one off as well, so they'd say.<br />
PM: Well, anyone who talks about this is talking a<br />
nonsense. I mean I do no more than rely on the statement<br />
of the Institute of Family Studies of Australia, the<br />
Brotherhood of St Laurence and ACOSS,' that we have<br />
delivered ahead of schedule on the promise that we would<br />
deliver in financial terms, that amount of money which<br />
would create the situation where there was no financial<br />
need for any child to live in poverty. The assessment of<br />
those that are out there in a daily sense dealing with<br />
this are saying that that financial promise has been<br />
delivered. LYNEHAM: And now you've written to the States calling<br />
welfare ministers together next month to talk about<br />
delivery of government services to kids.<br />
PM: Yes. As I said when I was talking to ACOSS<br />
Australian Council of Social Services there about a<br />
month ago Paul, in the area of poverty the Government can<br />
deliver as we have in terms of now over $ 2B per annum<br />
to meet the financial needs. But there are other factors<br />
which go to poverty, the delivery and the availability of<br />
a range of services. Now those services are shared<br />
between the States and the Commonwealth and what I've<br />
decided should be done is to have a meeting of the<br />
relevant Commonwealth and State Ministers and I believe<br />
there will be co-operation to see that we do everything<br />
we possibly can to co-ordinate our activities to maximise<br />
the accessibility, availability and delivery of those<br />
services. LYNEHAM: What services are you thinking then?<br />
PM: Oh well, there are counselling services, for<br />
instance, and there are other forms of assistance that<br />
are available through a range of agencies. The thing<br />
that I promised in ' 87 and which the welfare sector<br />
acknowledges and I'm thankful to them for is that<br />
we've delivered on the financial promise. I mean as I was<br />
saying today when I, at Queanbeyan, was recognising the<br />
second birthday of the family allowance supplement, and<br />
may I say amongst the women there with their kids, no<br />
cynicism, just gratitude. Recognising as I said, that in<br />
a case of a one income family on $ 320 a week earnings<br />
with three kids, that $ 109 a week tax free family<br />
allowance supplement is equal to a wage increase of $ 167<br />
a week. You don't get any cynicism there, Paul. </p>
<p>LYNEHAM: Now you're saying on interest rates that you<br />
believe that they'll be down before the middle of next<br />
year and they'll stay down.<br />
PM: I'm not going to say anything more about that. I<br />
was asked the question and the important thing that I<br />
want to emphasise is what I've said before in answer to<br />
an earlier question from you. That is that we believe<br />
that we are adhering to the range of economic policy,<br />
tough fiscal policy, tight wages policy and a tight<br />
monetary policy that will produce the conditions we<br />
believe where interest rates can come down. I'm not<br />
going to say anything more than that.<br />
LYNEHAM: But you're not backing away from that stand?<br />
PM: No, I'm not backing away. I'm simply saying I've<br />
said what I've-got to say about that.<br />
LYNEHAM: But why should that statement be, in the long<br />
run, seen as any more likely to occur than the forecast<br />
you made back in January?<br />
PM: Well, I would think that the evidence is emerging of<br />
the slowing down of the economy which is what these<br />
policy stances have been about it.<br />
LYNEHAM: Some say it's getting too slow now.<br />
PM: Well, some are indicating we might be getting to<br />
that point and that's precisely what the fine art of<br />
economic judgement is now to make sure that you don't<br />
take them off too soon nor too late. I believe we'll get<br />
it right.<br />
LYNEHAM: Just getting back to today's Morgan Poll, both<br />
Labor and the Opposition are down in their totals and<br />
there's about 13-1/ 2% of voters out there now going for<br />
either the Democrats or others. Do you think people are<br />
getting a bit sick and tired of big name politicians, big<br />
party machines?<br />
PM: I don't know whether they're getting sick and tired.<br />
I mean I think the right analysis is this; that it's<br />
quite true -as I've said publicly on a number of<br />
occasions -people don't like high interest rates.<br />
That's hurting. And so they're probably taking a little<br />
bit of support away from us at the moment. But the<br />
corollary of that is that they will not buy Andrew<br />
Peacock and who can blame them and so they're saying,<br />
' well alright, we're not going to indicate that we like<br />
what you're doing at the moment. We certainly don't look<br />
at the other mob as an alternative'. So residually, more<br />
votes going to the other people.<br />
LYNEHAM: Andrew's disapproval rating is 54%, yours is<br />
47%, they're both pretty high aren't they? Isn't it a<br />
plague on both your houses? </p>
<p>PM: If you want to compare you know between myself and<br />
Andrew, in the end I guess the thing is as between the<br />
two of us who do they prefer as Prime Minister, and<br />
overwhelmingly it's myself against Mr Peacock.<br />
LYNEHAM: Now you've said if you win again you'll stay on<br />
for a full fourth term.<br />
PM: Correct.<br />
LYNEHAM: Is that an absolute iron-clad guarantee to the<br />
voters? PM: Sure.<br />
LYNEHAM: I mean you might be expected to say that<br />
anyway, of course, a cynic would suggest.<br />
PM: Well I'm a very young, fit, active, healthy, vibrant<br />
S 60 year old. Why should I be thinking of any other<br />
course? LYNEHAM: Wouldn't it though be better to let your<br />
successor because you wouldn't stay on through the<br />
fifth term would you, as you've said that?<br />
PM: Well I can't go on for ever.<br />
LYNEHAM: No, exactly. Wouldn't it be better then to let<br />
your successor lead Labor to the polls for that fifth<br />
time, presumably Paul Keating?<br />
PM: I wouldn't think so. Why should it be better?<br />
LYNEHAM: Well because you're leading a team that is not<br />
going to be led by you through that Government<br />
presumably.<br />
0 PM: At some stage you have to make a decision that<br />
you've given enough of your time and that it's time for<br />
someone else to come on. I'm simply saying that I don't<br />
see that as being before the end of that next term. Then<br />
sometime during the term after that I would say alright,<br />
we hand over.<br />
LYNEHAM: Five wins on the trot would be a hell of a job<br />
for anyone, wouldn't it?<br />
PM: Well, it depends on two things. One, that you are<br />
continuing to deliver good and relevant government, both<br />
in terms of Australia's domestic needs and the place of<br />
Australia in the world. I'd be continuing to do that<br />
with my colleagues. The second thing is the alternative<br />
and one of the unfortunate features of Australian<br />
politics is that the conservatives haven't got their act<br />
together. It's going to take them a long time to do it,<br />
I think. </p>
<p>LYNEHAM: If you lose next year though you'll go.<br />
PM: That's what I've indicated I mean I believe a<br />
totally hypothetical question. I honestly believe<br />
without being cocky or complacent that we will win.<br />
I've simply said in answer to that hypothetical question,<br />
I would think that that'd be the case. It would need a<br />
great deal of pressure from my Party to persuade me to<br />
stay on.<br />
LYNEHAM: There's every likelihood too that if you did<br />
lose Paul Keating would go as well, which raises the<br />
prospect of a very different looking Labor opposition,<br />
doesn't it?<br />
PM: Yes, but I mean we're wasting time I think talking<br />
about a totally hypothetical situation.<br />
LYNEHAM: That hypothetical, it is?<br />
PM: I think so.<br />
LYNEHAM: Have you had any good suggestions from your<br />
Ministers yet for your fourth term?<br />
PM: I must say there is a lot of nonsense talked at<br />
least in one paper about this begging for new ideas. I<br />
mean nothing different has changed there. Whenever I've<br />
been coming up to an election I, at some stage months<br />
beforehand, I've said, ' well now look, what are your<br />
thoughts now about how you would like me to be thinking<br />
in the presentation of the policy speech, new emphases,<br />
or some new directions', and yes, I've had good<br />
responses, as I've had before.<br />
LYNEHAM: When are we going to hear about some of them?<br />
PM: In the right and proper time of my choosing.<br />
LYNEHAM: What about a mortgage relief scheme? I mean<br />
it's good enough for John Bannon, it's good enough for<br />
Wayne Goss. Why not Bob Hawke?<br />
PM: We looked at that and on a national scale we didn't<br />
think it was appropriate. At least there's one point on<br />
which the Opposition and we agree and that is neither the<br />
Opposition nor the Government think it's appropriate. In<br />
a State to State level they've got the responsibility<br />
within their assessment of their financial capacities and<br />
their assessment of the needs of their community. if<br />
they want to make that judgement, that's a judgement for<br />
them to make.<br />
LYNEHAM: It does mean though doesn't it that if you are<br />
holding a mortgage and you're lucky enough to be in a<br />
State that's had an election recently then you get a bit<br />
of a help? If you're not so lucky, well stiff cheese. </p>
<p>6<br />
PM: Yes, well that is true to an extent. But the<br />
important thing nationally is that you have a Government<br />
which is going to take the range of policies which is<br />
going to create the condition for a fall and a<br />
sustainable fall in rates. Now we believe we've got<br />
those policies in place.<br />
LYNEHAM: The pilots' dispute. You said last week that<br />
it would be your very strong recommendation to both<br />
airlines that they not attempt to collect damages against<br />
the Pilots' Federation. Have you talked to them yet<br />
because there's no sign of them being at all as merciful<br />
as you seem to be?<br />
PM: I've given that indication to them and of course<br />
there may be some difficulty as far as they are concerned<br />
in that they are actually still in the courts. The<br />
matter has got to be discussed. There may be some<br />
inhibitions upon what they are able to do at this stage.<br />
That's their business. I've made my position clear.<br />
LYNEHAM: It's been put to me that they weren't very<br />
happy that you made your position clear at that time.<br />
PM: I've seen lots of things put about lots of different<br />
propositions about states of happiness and unhappiness.<br />
If I believed everything I read in the newspapers I'd<br />
probably be inhabiting another form of asylum to this<br />
place. LYNEHAM: Do you think it will come to pass though that<br />
they will show this quality of mercy that you've alluded<br />
to? PM: I hope so. I hope so.<br />
LYNEHAM: You hope so. But you're not all that<br />
confident? PM: Well it's not my decision. I mean I haven't been<br />
running the airlines. Certainly we've had discussions<br />
with them throughout the period of this problem in the<br />
industry. But I don't run them and even in the airline<br />
that the people own, that the Government owns, we haven't<br />
been directing them as to how they should behave during<br />
the period of these difficulties. Now<br />
LYNEHAM: They were at your party on Saturday night Prime<br />
Minister, Sir Peter Abeles and Ted Harris. You must have<br />
got some vibes from them.<br />
PM: We, all of us at the party were relaxing. We<br />
weren't discussing business.<br />
LYNEHAM: Foreign Minister Gareth Evans' peace plan for<br />
Cambodia. </p>
<p>PM: Yes.<br />
LYNEHAM: You've had Mike Costello, a senior Foreign<br />
Affairs official in Ho Chi Minh City recently having<br />
talks with Cambodians and Vietnamese. How have things<br />
been going?<br />
PM: Paul not only there, but even before he went there,<br />
Gareth Evans was getting good responses from Dick Solomon<br />
from the United States, the Under Secretary of State for<br />
this region in the Administration. There were quite<br />
positive responses there as there were from Mr Alatas,<br />
the Indonesian Foreign Minister. Now there were positive<br />
responses in his discussions in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh<br />
City. So much so that Mr Costello has gone on to Phnom<br />
Penh. And I can say to you here on this program now that<br />
as a result of the sorts of reactions that we're getting,<br />
but acknowledging that there are great difficulties<br />
-involved in the proposition as there are in all the<br />
others that are on the table, Gareth and I have had a<br />
discussion not, I haven't spoken to him directly but<br />
I've arranged that there be discussions through my people<br />
and we've agreed that Mr Costello should now go on to<br />
Beijing because China is obviously a player in the<br />
resolution in the Cambodian tragedy. We think it<br />
appropriate to send Mr Costello there to expound to the<br />
Chinese leadership the thinking that is behind our<br />
proposal and to see, hopefully, if we could get a<br />
positive response from them.<br />
LYNEHAM: The Chinese have been very strong backers of<br />
the Khmer Rouge haven't they?<br />
PM: Yes indeed, yes.<br />
LYNEHAM: So if the Khmer Rouge is to be isolated as a<br />
player in this game presumably Chinese support is<br />
critical.<br />
* PM: Well obviously if you were our chances of getting<br />
acceptance of the proposal that we're talking about would<br />
be very much enhanced if the Chinese were to see merit in<br />
it. Because you see the critically difficult issue that<br />
is confronting everyone that's concerned with getting a<br />
resolution of the Cambodian problem is getting some form<br />
of interim administration between now and when the free<br />
elections can be held. And there's a lot of concern in a<br />
lot of quarters that because of the horrendous history of<br />
the Khmer Rouge when they were in control in Cambodia<br />
that they could not<br />
LYNEHAM: The killing fields?<br />
PM: Well of course. And there's a lot of concern that<br />
they should have no role in that interim process. Now<br />
our idea of a UN interim administration is calculated to<br />
meet in part that problem. Now obviously if China, who<br />
as you rightly say have been backers of the Khmer Rouge </p>
<p>in the past, were to see merit in our proposal that would<br />
be very helpful.<br />
LYNEHAM: When would you assume Mr Costello would arrive<br />
in Beijing?<br />
PM: I would think he'd be going reasonably soon. It<br />
would have to be confirmed with the Chinese authorities.<br />
LYNEHAM: That would be the most senior he would be the<br />
most senior Australian official to visit there since the<br />
June massacre wouldn't he?<br />
PM: Yes. And may I say what he's going there for is in<br />
regard to our proposal in regard to trying to get a<br />
settlement in Cambodia. It's not, he's not going there<br />
for other purposes.<br />
LYNEHAM: He doesn't have any other agenda?<br />
PM: No I obviously when he's there there may be some<br />
discussion but he's not going there briefed to argue<br />
positions. I mean other than making it quite clear in<br />
any matter that may arise, any discussion that may arise,<br />
the clear position of my Government in regard to what<br />
happened in China earlier this year.<br />
LYNEHAM: Now, there are three Chinese dissidents due to<br />
visit here next week from Paris. The Chinese say that we<br />
shouldn't let them in, it would be meddling in Chinese<br />
internal affairs.<br />
PM: Yes, one of the head figures of this organisation,<br />
Wan Runnan has applied for a visa and that's been<br />
granted. I understand that the Chinese authorities are<br />
not too happy about this. But what they have to<br />
understand is that this is a pluralistic society within<br />
which the freedom of expression is a fundamental right,<br />
it's one of the fundamental values of our society. Now<br />
in those circumstances this person can come here provided<br />
of course that he observes and abides by the law of this<br />
country. LYNEHAM: Jervis Bay. If you're not going to move the<br />
Navy there, does it make much sense to move the<br />
ammunition dump there?<br />
PM: Well prima facie there'd be obviously a serious<br />
question mark about the appropriateness in those<br />
circumstances. But as I pointed out the other day, we<br />
will allow the EIS studies to go ahead because things<br />
could come out of that which would be relevant to your<br />
consideration of the circumstances as to where it would<br />
go if you were shifting it from Sydney.<br />
LYNEHAM: What do you think of the idea of turning it<br />
into a national park? It's a very beautiful place. </p>
<p>PM: Yes it is very beautiful. I remember Paul at the<br />
beginning of the 1984 election I went down there and the<br />
naval commander said Prime Minister, he said, you see<br />
that beautiful point over there, that wooded point coming<br />
down? And I said yes it looks beautiful. He said well<br />
when they were thinking about where they'd establish the<br />
national capital, and this was one of the sites, that was<br />
going to be the Prime Minister's residence. I must say<br />
LYNEHAM: Bad luck.<br />
PM: I must say it was very attractive.<br />
LYNEHAM: Also on the green front it looks as though<br />
we' re seeing another dust-up now between Senator<br />
Richardson and John Kerin.<br />
PM: Untrue.<br />
LYNEHAM: Untrue?<br />
PM: Untrue.<br />
LYNEHAM: So there's no disagreement about the definition<br />
of sustainable development?<br />
PM: No. I would think if Mr Kerin were asked about<br />
Senator Richardson's speech of yesterday I don't think<br />
you would find Mr Kerin expressing any disagreement.<br />
LYNEHAM: What do you think sustainable development<br />
means? Does it mean we have careful development or less<br />
development or a bit of both?<br />
PM: It's precisely Paul because sustainable development<br />
has come to mean different things to different people. I<br />
had this meeting the other day and I was very grateful to<br />
the representatives of the mining industry, the farmers<br />
and the forestry industry to come and join with the<br />
Australian Conservation Foundation and the Wilderness<br />
Society together with my four Ministers and we agreed<br />
that there were different interpretations of what it<br />
meant and they responded to my suggestion that we would<br />
prepare a discussion paper on the meanings and<br />
implications of sustainable development. We will do<br />
that. We will have that developed and distributed.<br />
LYNEHAM: It does mean different things to everybody<br />
doesn't it?<br />
PM: Precisely. And that's because different people want<br />
it to mean different things. And that's why they agreed<br />
that it would be a good thing for us to prepare a<br />
discussion paper and then we'll distribute that and these<br />
various groups will come together, respond to it and we<br />
believe that on that basis we can get some acceptable<br />
sort of definition even if people don't agree with every<br />
element of it. From there we will move to having working </p>
<p>groups in all the areas of fisheries, forestry, mining,<br />
manufacturing, energy so that we can apply the broad<br />
concepts to what are then sensible working rules for<br />
development in these various sectors of the economy.<br />
LYNEHAM: You wept publicly again recently when you were<br />
talking about your dad.<br />
PM: Well I think to say I wept is a<br />
LYNEHAM: You didn't?<br />
PM: Well, could I finish? I said to say that I wept is<br />
I think putting it rather I certainly had a couple of<br />
tears in my eyes. I make no apologies for that as I<br />
haven't about any other occasion when I've had tears in<br />
my eyes. I have just been thinking a lot about my dad<br />
recently Paul and he is getting very old and very frail.<br />
And as I said I love him very much. I don't think I have<br />
to apologise or explain to you or anyone else that if I<br />
think about someone I love that dearly, if I get a tear<br />
in my eye, so be it.<br />
LYNEHAM: Well we've rather got used to that haven't we?<br />
PM: I don't know whether you have or not. It's a matter<br />
of supreme indifference to me whether you have.<br />
LYNEHAM: What sort of reaction are you getting though?<br />
What do people say when they write to you or speak to<br />
you? PM: Well for what it's worth, the people who get in<br />
touch with me, it's very positive. But let me say this.<br />
I mean it's a matter of indifference to me. It's like<br />
whether I'm fat or thin or have a wart on the end of my<br />
nose. In my physiological makeup, not something I<br />
choose, that happens to me. I make no apology for it.<br />
O It is a fact of life. It is not contrived. I think if I<br />
could press a button if I knew that I was starting to get<br />
emotional, if I could press a button I'd stop it. But<br />
for better or worse there's no button to press Paul.<br />
LYNEHAM: Are you going on holidays on Friday?<br />
PM: Yes.<br />
LYNEHAM: Back on January 8?<br />
PM: I think we're back here next week for a day.<br />
LYNEHAM: That's right. $ 200,000 to bring the House of<br />
Reps back for a couple of days. Why<br />
PM: ( inaudible)<br />
LYNEHAM: Why wouldn't people say hang on, can't they<br />
manage the affairs of government better? </p>
<p>11<br />
PM: They may if you tried improperly to prod them into<br />
such a view. But it would be improper. The fact is that<br />
there are 16 important pieces of legislation which we put<br />
to the Senate on the basis they must be passed this year.<br />
There are some taxation legislation which go to operative<br />
dates from the beginning of next year which require to be<br />
passed. There is also a piece of legislation which<br />
require to be passed to fulfil a commitment which I gave<br />
to the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory, Marshall<br />
Peron, that very important agreement that we reached<br />
which will make available land to Aboriginals on stations<br />
in the Northern Territory. It was a solemn undertaking<br />
between the Chief Minister and myself that their<br />
legislation and ours would be passed this year. So there<br />
are very many, significant, practical reasons which good<br />
government requires having the House of Representatives<br />
coming back.<br />
LYNEHAM: And after that where are you going to go?<br />
What's your holiday like?<br />
PM: I'll basically be in Kirribilli. But I will be<br />
moving from there to play some golf, be lying in the sun,<br />
reading and thinking and playing with my grandchildren.<br />
LYNEHAM: Thinking about the election date?<br />
PM: Not much.<br />
LYNEHAM: You're not going to decide over the holidays?<br />
PM: Might.<br />
LYNEHAM: Are you having second thoughts about going to<br />
Gallipoli in April?<br />
PM: No, I'm not having second thoughts. I believe that<br />
the Australian people would want their Prime Minister, as<br />
0 indeed Mrs Thatcher is going to attempt to go. I would<br />
hope Mr Palmer would be thinking about going. I would<br />
think they'd want their Prime Minister and may I say the<br />
Leader of the Opposition too. I've extended an<br />
invitation to the Leader of the Opposition. Because what<br />
you've got to remember, this is not simply that it's the<br />
anniversay but realistically, obviously this will be<br />
the last significant anniversary occasion in which you<br />
will still have the Gallipoli veterans able to<br />
participate. They clearly won't be available for the<br />
100th anniversary. As I say, I don't want to make<br />
politics of it. It's something where as I say I hope the<br />
Leader of the Opposition would be able to come too. He's<br />
invited. LYNEHAM: You'd still go if hypothetically it were in a<br />
campaign time?<br />
PM: I would hope I'd be able to do so. Yes. </p>
<p>LYNEHAM: And you'd still go if Andrew wouldn't go as<br />
well? PM: I expect Andrew would regard it as appropriate to<br />
go. LYNEHAM: And how about May 5 or May 12? Either of them<br />
sound like a good bet at this stage?<br />
PM: What for, a bet or?<br />
LYNEHAM: Yes, a bet on the election.<br />
PM: A bet on the election is always a good thing. No,<br />
not on the date. I mean wouldn't be betting on any date<br />
if I were you. I discourage betting on these sorts of<br />
things, really.<br />
LYNEHAM: And finally, any Christmas message for Andrew?<br />
PM: Yes, have a good break.<br />
LYNEHAM: It's going to be on next year isn't it?<br />
PM: Whatever happens it's going to be a fairly tough,<br />
busy year. And I sincerely hope he has a good rest.<br />
LYNEHAM: Thanks for your time and merry Christmas.<br />
PM: Thanks very much Paul. And may I take this<br />
opportunity of wishing all of your viewers a merry<br />
Christmas too.<br />
