SPEECH BY TE PRIME MINI ) IIR<br />
ANNUAL SOCCER NATIONAL ILAYEIR 1-TE il YEAR AWARDS<br />
MELBOURNE 14 NOVEMBER 1983<br />
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN<br />
I AM PLEASED TO BE HERE TONIGHT FOR THE NATIONAL SOCCER<br />
LEAGUE AWARDS AND TO PRESENT THE TROPHY TO THE PLAYER OF<br />
THE YEAR IN THE TOP SOCCER COMPETITION IN AUSTRALIA,<br />
THE PRESENTATION OF TROPHIES IN SOCCER AS IN OTHER SPORTS<br />
IN RECOGNITION OF ACHIEVEMENT AND PERFORMANCE SHOULD HELP TO<br />
MOTIVATE AND 1O ENCOURAGE OITHERS r'O I: OLLOW EXAIMPLE AND<br />
ASPIRE TO THE STANDARDS SET,<br />
THE OCCASION OF SUCH PRESENTATIONS ALSO PROVIDES AN<br />
OPPORTUNITY TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE REST OF THE TEAM ' BEHIND THE<br />
SCENES', THEY MAKE MAJOR CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE SUCCESS OF<br />
THE TEAM ON THE FIELD TIE SUPPORTERS, TllE A) DMINIISTRA. rORS<br />
AND THE VOLUNTARY WORERS WHOSE SERVICFS ARE IN: VALUABLE 10 ALL<br />
CLUBS AND SPORTING P'" DIES.<br />
SOCCER IS A TRULY INTERNATIONAL SPORT, WITH INTERNATIONAL<br />
APPEAL, AND IN AUSTRALIA HAS MANIFESTED A TRULY MULTICULTURAL<br />
CHARACTER, SOCCER'S INITIAL GROWTH IN THE POST ' IORLD AR II PERIOD WAS<br />
AS A SOCIAL GAME WITHIN OUR MIGRANT COMMUNITIES,<br />
i </p>
<p>WITH THE URGE TO PLAY THE GAME AT A HIGHER LEVEL, THESE<br />
COMMUNITIES BANDED TOGETHER TO PLAY EACH OTHER IN REGULAR<br />
COMPETITION, SOCCER HAS NOW SF'RI-A.) WIIDEiLY THIRWIJSIIHIIT IIL . OMMUH I TY Al<br />
LARGE.<br />
BECAUSE OF ITS INTERNATIONALISM, SOCCER PROVIDED A UNIQUE<br />
' MULTICULTURAL BRIDGE' WHICH FOR MANY NEWCOMERS HELPED MAKE<br />
A LITTLE EASIER THE CROSSING FROM THEIR HOMELANDS TO THIS<br />
UNFAMILIAR ISLAND CONTNI. Il<br />
IN THIS PROCESS SOCCER FUNCTIONED AS AN IMPORTANT SOCIALISING<br />
MEDIUM HELPING MANY NEWCOMERS SETTFL IN AND ESTABLISH<br />
THEMSELVES IN THE AUSTRALIAN COMMUNITY,<br />
THE IMPACT ON SOCCER BY THE MIGRANT COMMUNITY WAS MOST<br />
CLEARLY FELT IN THE IMPROVED STANDARDS OF THE GAML<br />
WHICH LED TO OUR ENTRY INTO THE WORLD CUP FINALS<br />
NINE YEARS AGO.<br />
IN RECENT YEARS THE EMPHASIS HAS BEEN ON ESTABLISHING<br />
SOCCER WITH ITS OWN IDENTITY AS A NAIIONAL GAME IN AUSTRALIA,<br />
THE IMAGINATIVE AND CRUCIAL STEP TAKEN IN 1977 TO FORM A<br />
NATIONAL SOCCER LEAGUE, BRINGING IOGETHER IN COMPETITION<br />
CLUBS FROM MAJOR CITIES, PROVIDED MAJOR MOMENTUM TO THIS<br />
TREND. </p>
<p>THE NSL's PLANS FOR TWO NATIONAL DIVISIONS IN ]. 9L,<br />
INCREASING THE NUMBER OF TEAMS PARTICIPATING IN THE<br />
COMPETITION TO 2, WILL FURTHER REINFORCE THIS DEVELOPMENT.<br />
Till' IS II L. L P ING TlE GAMF GRADUAL. Y in WI.) I TH 1 BA., I F<br />
APPEAL AND BECOME MORE CLOSELY A PART OF THE AUSTRALIAN<br />
ENVIRONMENT,<br />
WITH FURTHER UPGRADING OF SKILLS AND IMPROVED COACHING<br />
METHODS AND ADMINISTRATIONj STILL WIDER SUPPORT FOR THE SPORT<br />
CAN BE EXPECTED,<br />
THE GAME NEEDS TO BUILD ON ITS POPULARITY AT BOTH THE<br />
GRASS ROOTS LEVEL AND TO PROMOTE AND ENCOURAGE THE PURSUIT<br />
OF EXCELLENCE BY ITS STARS:<br />
THESE OBJECTIVES ARE IMPORTANT AND ARE MUTUALLY<br />
REINFORCING THEY ALSO REFLECT THE BASIS OF THE GOVERNMENT'S SUPPOPT<br />
FOR SPORT IN GENERAL AND SOCCER IN PARTICULAR.<br />
IN 1983/ 84, UNDER THE SPORTS DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM THE GOVERNMENT<br />
PROVIDED THE AUSTRALIAN SOCCER FEDERATION WITH $ 100,000 FOR<br />
ADMINISTRATION, INTERNATIONAL COMPETITION AND FOR DEVELOPMENT<br />
PROJECTS, THIS IS IN ADDITION TO THE ASSISTANCE TO SOCCER PROVIDED<br />
THROUGH THE COMMONWEALTH FUNDED AUSTRALIAN INSTITUTE OF<br />
SPORt WHERE SOCCER WAS ONE OF THE ORIGINAL EIGHT SPORTS<br />
1 NTPOPII'. hD </p>
<p>PART OF THE $ 10.2 MILLION PROVIDEI-D Ti-IIS YEAR FOR<br />
CAPITAL WORKS A1 THE AUSTRALIAN INSTITUTE OF SPORT<br />
WILL BE USED TO COMPLETE AN INDOOR SOCCER HALL<br />
THIS FACILITY WILL ENABLE YEAR-ROIJHF COACHING AND<br />
COMPETITION FOR THE INSTITUTE'S SOCCER PROGRAM,<br />
INCLUDING THE YOUTH TEAM,<br />
THE NEED TO INVOLVE THESE YOUNG PLAYERS IN THE FUTURE<br />
DEVELOPMENT OF THE SPORT IS OF CRUCIAL IMPORTANCE,<br />
IN CONTRAST TO OTIIER CODES AND NAIIONAL SPORT.; SOCCER<br />
HAS PROBLEMS IN PROVIDING CONTINUITY OF PROGRESSION OF<br />
YOUNGER PLAYERS THROUGH VARIOUS LEVELS OF SKILL THROUGH<br />
THE CLUBS AND COMPETITION NETWORKS AVAILABLE.<br />
ACCORDINGLY, I AM PARTICULARLY PLEASED TO NOTE AMONG THE<br />
AWARDS TONIGHT THOSE FOR THE YOUNG I.. EAGUE PLAYER OF T1IF YEAR<br />
AND THE UNDER 21 PLAYER OF THE YEAR; THE FEDERATION ALSO<br />
PLANS TO INTRODUCE YOUTH PROGRAMS INCLUDING THE YOUTH<br />
CHAMPIONSHIPS,<br />
THIS WILL HELP BUILD ON AUSTRALIA'S ACHIEVEMENT IN REACHING<br />
THE FINAL ROUNDS OF THE 1982 W'ORLD YOUTH CUP AND STAND US IN<br />
GOOD STEAD FOR OUR BID TO ENTER rH. l-198C) I'WORLD CUP FINALS, 6 </p>
<p>LOOKING AHEAD, I BELIEVE WE HAVE EVERY REASON TO BE CONFIDENT<br />
UF SOCCER'S PROSPECTS IN THE FUTURE.<br />
A DISTINCTIVE AUSTRALIAN STYLE IS BEING DEVELOPED,<br />
IT SHOULD CARRY US A LONG WAY,<br />
IN LINE WITH THIS, IT GIVES ME PARTICUULAR PLEASURE TO PRESENT<br />
THE NATIONAL SOCCER LEAGUE PLAYER OF THE YEAR AWARD TO<br />
AND ON YOUR BEHALF OFFER HIM OUR<br />
CONGRATULATIONS AND BEST WISHES FOR THE FUTURE, </p>
