TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE MON P J KEATING MP<br />
INTERVIEW WITH ANNA REYNOLDS RADIO 40R, 11I MAY 1995<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
AR: The Prime Minister Paul Keating joins us from Canberra this<br />
morning. Good morning welcome to the program.<br />
PM: Good morning Anna.<br />
AR: Before we get to the actual nitty gritty, how do you think the budget<br />
has been received? You have had a day or so to talk to people<br />
about it now.<br />
PM: Very well, I think. The main point of it, of course, was to sustain the<br />
gro wth through the rest of the 90s. And to do that, we had to<br />
essentially take some off the pressure of interest rates, and reduce<br />
the demand by the public sector or by the Commonwealth<br />
Government on the savings of the country. And we have done that<br />
by changing quite dramatically in fact, it's the largest Budget<br />
change we have ever recorded the Budget balance into surplus,<br />
which reduces that call on savings, which leaves more savings for<br />
Investment, which means there will be more investment and more<br />
jobs. Therefore, the recovery continues on Into the 90s. We had<br />
John Howard running around talking about 5 minutes of sunshine<br />
we have now had 3 years of growth, we have been growing faster<br />
than any other western economy. And now the Treasury is saying<br />
that in the forecast period, we will have sustainable economic growth<br />
and the forecast period Is in the next 3 years. So, we will have had<br />
3 years of growth 3.5 years of growth and 3 coming. it gives the<br />
lie to that cynical line.<br />
AR: Are you satisfied that the pressure is significantly off interest rates<br />
now? </p>
<p>TEL: 2<br />
PM: As I say, It's a dramatic turnaround in the Budget the turnaround is<br />
$ 12.9 billion. In other words, from the deficit we were running last<br />
year, to the surplus this year we had a deficit last year of $ 12.2<br />
billion, and we are going to be running a surplus of $ 0.7 billion so<br />
there is a $ 12.9 billion...<br />
AR: Yes, but the Democrats are saying, of course though, that it depends<br />
on which figure you look at, and whether you actually take the<br />
underlying figure excluding asset sales. Now, I mean, do you<br />
understand the point they are making there, and their need their<br />
indication that they want some sort of clarification with this Inquiry<br />
In the Senate?<br />
PM: No. Look, that's all. everyone tries to get their little tuppence worth<br />
Into a Budget debate. As for the _ Remocats, the first thing they<br />
always think of Is an inquiry about anything. So, what they don't<br />
think about is the time and the waste in the Senate, and the public<br />
expense. The fact is, the Commonwealth buys assets and sells<br />
assets all the time. For instance, in Queensland, one of the things<br />
we are building at the moment Is in partnership with the<br />
Queensland Government the railways of Robena on the Gold<br />
Coast. Now, that's an expenditure on the Budget. So, If we sell an<br />
asset, it's a sale on the Budget, and the Budget is built on a cash<br />
basis, and always has been. These things are only said by the likes<br />
of John Howard to try to diminish the results. There was someone<br />
on from Moody's in New York this morning on Australian radio<br />
saying " look, we don't care how the Budget surplus Is arrived at<br />
what it means is there will be a massive reduction In the bond selling<br />
program In Australia this year". See, if the Budget has shifted by<br />
$ 12.9 billion, it reduces dramatically the bond selling program the<br />
number of Commonwealth bonds the Government will be selling<br />
and that takes the pressure off Interest rates.<br />
AR: Are you comfortable, though, with the way that sells the position of<br />
the Australian economy to the Australian people I mean, the<br />
Democrats are essentially saying you are being less than honest by<br />
Including the asset sales In that figure.<br />
PM: They are being completely dishonest In making that sort of<br />
reference. I mean, you saw also the Secretary of the Treasury<br />
publish a statement the other day saying that these numbers are all<br />
basically put together I mean, the policies are put together by the<br />
Government, and the collation of the numbers Is put together by the<br />
Treasury. EconorniUpoicies are all about the degree of change one<br />
year over th6-ityear, and the degree of change here is a $ 12.9<br />
billion turnaround. And what that means is that we will be reducing<br />
very dramatically out there in that marketplace every day, when the<br />
Commonwealth is selling their tender Commonwealth bonds to<br />
finance the Budget deficit, this year we will be selling vastly less,<br />
and that will make... . that's why bond yields you will notice in the last<br />

3<br />
week, the long-term bond yields have dropped by almost a<br />
percentage point, and that has been confirmed now. In other words,<br />
yesterday they stayed... they dropped even further, so now we have<br />
seen because the market thought the Budget was going to be<br />
good, they have dropped long bond yields by 1 and that Is a<br />
terrific sign for Interest rates in Australia. Can I just make this point:<br />
the short-term interest rates.. . the influence of the short term Interest<br />
rates comes from the markets and also the overnight cash and call<br />
rates set by the Reserve Bank, but then the long rates are set just<br />
exclusively In the market place they are all about sentiment about<br />
inflation, growth, sustainability, Budget deficits, the works. What we<br />
have had there Is a one percentage point reduction In the last week<br />
In the long term bond rate, and that has been confirmed yesterday<br />
with a further small drop. So, that's the judgement that matters.<br />
AR: So you would think that would...<br />
PMV: Not the Democrats. and a silly Inquiry in the Senate.<br />
AR: Speaking of a silly inquiry I mean, presumably they will get it<br />
through, and then they will call on Government people to actually<br />
give evidence, that sort of thing will there be co-operation?<br />
PMV; You have go'. I understand that this Is all part of the trivia and<br />
nonsense of Australian politics now. I mean, when I became<br />
Treasurer all those years ago when I was left that absolute cesspool<br />
of problems by John Howard at that stage, the Coalition<br />
published -one forward-ouDr year estimate of outlays. When they<br />
produced a Budget, they would show you what the next year's<br />
outlays figure would be In projection what we show, is the 2 years<br />
outlays figures 3 years outlays figures in projections, and 3 years<br />
of receipts. In other words, we publish 3 forward estimates of the<br />
deficit or the surplus 3 years out, and the Budget documents all have<br />
graphically Illustrated trend changes in all of the spending programs.<br />
It's the Rolls Royce of Budget documents world-wide there is no<br />
country that produces Budget documents in the OECD like Australia.<br />
AR: Nonetheless, you do have to live with the Senate there is not much<br />
choice about that, and It looks like they will be making some noises.<br />
And noises, too, from the Green Senators about the Increase in the<br />
corporate tax, and saying particularly, worried about the effect on<br />
small business. I mean, can you understand their concern there?<br />
PMV: The Green Senators?<br />
AR: Yes.<br />
PM: These are the people who actually wanted to bang tax rates up for<br />
high Income earners, who wanted to push the company tax rates up,<br />
who want a fixed 20% fiat company tax for all companies. I mean, it<br />

<p>TEL: 11. May .95 1 : 01 No .009 P. 04<br />
4<br />
wears a bit thin for them to be taking a point about the impact of<br />
small business. We have made...<br />
AR: I'm just wondering how you think that tax is going to impact on some<br />
small businesses, who certainly in Queensland, are really feeling the<br />
pinch at the moment?<br />
PMV: If they're feeling the pinch, they are feeling it In the highest growth<br />
economy we have ever had. We have been growing at 5% to 6%<br />
with 2% Inflation, so If they are feeling the pinch, they ought to say<br />
ofsmall business is not for me", because it Is never going to get any<br />
better. This Is as good as It ever gets. To have an economy<br />
growing at 5% with 2% Inflation is as good as it ever gets, so if they<br />
are feeling the pinch, they have got to say " I had better go back to<br />
PAYE employment".<br />
AR: I mean, there are different sectors, obviously, performing differently.-<br />
in the housing industry In Queensland, starts have been low, and<br />
particularly In the growth areas where there has been a boom over<br />
the last 6 months or so small businesses are worried about the<br />
Increase In the tax on some building materials. Do you think that<br />
could bite there, or do you think that impact is being overestimated?<br />
PMV: The whole point of the policy has been to slow the economy down. I<br />
mean, the Government.. . you have got to do some tdU~ ih things to do<br />
kind things.<br />
AR: So people have to suffer in that process?<br />
PMV: No. Not suffer. Just understand this point we Increased interest<br />
rates by 3 percentage points last November, quickly and sharply.<br />
And that did have the effect of slowing the economy down. By now<br />
Introducing a Budget with such a huge change as this a turnaround<br />
of nearly $ 13 billion, taking the pressure off interest rates what that<br />
means is that your average householder, and your average homebuyer,<br />
won't be now In the position of fearing a sort of cascading<br />
interest rate rises because of the decisions that the Government has<br />
taken sensibly, correctly, timely, to change that spending profile in<br />
the economy, and now to adjust the policy weights back on to<br />
Budget policy away from Interest rates. That Is what Is going to<br />
matter to the building industry the building Industry got to the point<br />
where we couldn't keep the resources up to It that's material or<br />
labour. And what happens then is the price of houses starts<br />
rocketing away with price inflation. So, It slowed down yes, It has<br />
slowed down, it will affect some builders, it may affect many builders<br />
but in the longer run, It will pick up to a better growth trajectory, and<br />
that will happen because of the policy decisions made in<br />
October/ November last year by the Government, and by the<br />
Government In the Budget on Tuesday night. </p>
<p>TEL: 11. May. 95 1: 01 No. 009<br />
AR: I noticed one of the resyonses this morning from the Bankers<br />
Association to the increase in corporate tax Is that they say the extra<br />
taxes they are going to have to pay will be passed on to consumers<br />
in terms of higher fees I mean, is that the sort of outcome you were<br />
actually predicting?<br />
PM: That's just a bit of nonsense for the media. Their profits are at such<br />
extraordinary levels, they will just take the hit on their profits, as they<br />
should. In other words, they have got a licence from the<br />
Government.... . you see, those big banks ANZ, the Commonwealth,<br />
Westpac have got a licence from the Government to operate as a<br />
bank, and they have got a great monopoly position, and because of<br />
that, they have these very high profits. Now, what we are saying Is<br />
that they can share some of those profits with the public.<br />
AR: So you don't think they should have to pass on that extra cost they<br />
they will have to bear by Increasing fees to consumers?<br />
PM: They are already on the nose with people through Increasing fees.<br />
People are moving to smaller banking institutions because they don't<br />
like the way the indifferent way -Finey-are treated by the major<br />
banks. And If they want to after a Budget poke their tongue out at<br />
people and say "~ we'll pass some more charges -onto you", more<br />
people will vote with their feet and leave them go to the smaller<br />
institutions. Their profits are so strong, that they will take this<br />
and say its a mere bagatelle for them.<br />
AR: Thinking about the overall way the Budget has been received there<br />
has been a fair bit of emphasis here In Queensland on the way it will<br />
affect certain industries, and people talking about not being able to<br />
buy a new car, increased car prices, this that and the other I mean,<br />
what do you think is In it for the average person?<br />
PM: The biggest thing In It for the average person Is the superannuation<br />
change. What we have put into it Is that the 9% under the<br />
superannuation guarantee charge which the Government put Into<br />
the Budget In 1991 from the changes which were negotiated with the<br />
Trade Unions under the Accord In 1986 we started 3% In 1986,<br />
then we moved it to 5% on a voluntary basis under awards, then to<br />
the superannuation guarantee charge where it became compulsory,<br />
to 6% on 1 July this year. That rises to 9% at the end of this decade.<br />
To that, on Tuesday night, the Government has added 3% by way of<br />
employee contributions, and 3% by way of the One Nation tax cuts<br />
paid Into their superannuation accounts. So, as a consequence of<br />
Tuesday night, we will be adding 6 percentage points to the 9%<br />
already available under the superannuation guarantee. So that<br />
means that every person In the country every wage and salary<br />
earner will have 15% of their wages and salaries going Into a<br />
national superannuation scheme, and what that will mean I gave<br />
the example yesterday of someone on average weekly earnings it </p>
<p>TEL: 11. May .95 1: 01 No .009 P. 06<br />
6<br />
will mean that someone who was on say $ 33,000 a year, at the end<br />
of their working life, will pick up a pension of $ 30,000 a year, coming<br />
from a lump oum of juat on $ 0.6 million. go a porcon on $ 22,000 a<br />
year, will end up putting away a kitty of $ 0.5 million, and that will<br />
then equal an annuity over the rest of their lives of $ 30,000 a year.<br />
Now,..<br />
AR: It's a long-term, type of benefit for people, though, isn't it are you<br />
confident you will be able to get the message through, or do you<br />
-think It will be hard to sell In the run-up to an election?<br />
PM: You have got understand this, Anna, that the time my generation<br />
I'm 50, 51 the time my generation Is 65, this Is the post-baby boom<br />
boomers, so called baby-boomers there will be twice as many<br />
retired age people as there Is today. The pressure on the pension Is<br />
going to be so inordinately high, that this scheme we put in Tuesday<br />
night is going to protect the Income In retirement of not just all the<br />
baby-boomers, but all of their children. And, even some of the<br />
people older than the baby-boomers. In other words, this scheme Is<br />
already going to be at 9% by the year 2000 that's only 5 years<br />
away. And it will go on, but let me make this point to you could you<br />
imagine the Liberal party having the courage, the wit, the<br />
Imagination to sit down with a workforce over a 10 year period, and<br />
piece together a national savings and retirement Income scheme?<br />
AR: All right, we will take that up with them at a later date. Mr Keating,<br />
we will have to leave It we're out of time. Thank you very much for<br />
joining us.<br />
PM: Thank you very much indeed, Anna.<br />
AR: Prime Minister, Paul Keating.<br />
ends. </p>
