SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
LAUNCH OF AUSTRALIA MALAYSIA SOCIETY<br />
WEDNESDAY 13 DECEMBER 1995<br />
PARLIAMENT HOUSE, CANBERRA<br />
It is very good to be here to launch the Australia Malaysia Society.<br />
And it is good to have so many old friends of Australia from Malaysia present.<br />
I particularly want to welcome again the Chief Minister of Sarawak, Tan Sri<br />
Taib Mahmud, who is Chair of the Malaysia-Australia Foundation and his<br />
colleagues from Malaysia.<br />
The establishment of this society and the formation of the Malaysia<br />
Australia Foundation which Dr Mahathir launched in KL last year are a<br />
reflection of what it is that really underpins the relationship between Australia<br />
and Malaysia that is, the level of contact and depth of friendship between<br />
the people of the two countries.<br />
This is not a relationship which exists only between Governments. It is one<br />
which is nourished and sustained by all the links which individual Malaysians<br />
and Australians have been built up over the years. That is what motivated<br />
people in both countries to establish the Society and the Foundation.<br />
Substantially, of course, those ties have grown out of the experience of<br />
students. The figures may be familiar, but they are worth repeating. Over<br />
120,000 Malaysians have been educated in Australia and many of them, like<br />
our guests today, have gone on to hold influential positions in the Malaysian<br />
government, public service and business community.<br />
At any one time, more than 10,000 Malaysian students are studying in<br />
Australia. Another great area of strength has been the relationship between our<br />
defence forces. These ties go back even before Malaysia's independence.<br />
They are formalised through the Malaysia Australia Joint Defence Program<br />
and the Five Power Defence Arrangements. Australia is the major overseas<br />
provider of training for the Malaysian defence force and we have regular<br />
discussions about defence and security matters. No-one who has any </p>
<p>contact with the military in either of our countries can doubt the close<br />
personal bonds which have grown out of these professional links.<br />
The trade and investment relationship has been another key source of<br />
people-to-people contact, of course. As we have seen with the establishment<br />
of this society, the Australian business community has been a keen supporter<br />
of the bilateral relationship over the years.<br />
By next year, Malaysia should overtake Britain to become one of Australia's<br />
ten largest export markets. It is now our eleventh largest trading partner, with<br />
two-way trade of $ 3.5 billion in 1994-95. Australia also ranks as Malaysia's<br />
eleventh largest trading partner, showing how evenly the relationship benefits<br />
us both.<br />
Bilateral trade grew at a remarkable 22 per cent last year and has grown at<br />
that rate for the last three years. And Malaysia's strong growth, predicted at<br />
almost nine per cent this year, and its program of privatisation and<br />
infrastructure development, provide excellent opportunities for Australian<br />
exporters and investors.<br />
Prospects for trade in services are equally good. Total services trade was<br />
worth over one billion dollars in 1993-94 and it has been growing at 17 per<br />
cent a year.<br />
Tourism is a significant part of this trade and another way in which people-topeople<br />
contacts are growing. Almost 60 000 Malaysian holiday-makers came<br />
to Australia last year, and up to 100 000 Australian tourists visit Malaysia<br />
each year. The recent expansion of air services between us is a further good<br />
move which will help tourism.<br />
Australia and Malaysia have also been working closely together on global<br />
and regional economic developments. We have used the Cairns Group to<br />
press for greater liberalisation of world trade in agriculture and we have a<br />
very cooperative relationship in APEC and in the dialogue on trade facilitation<br />
between AFTA and CER.<br />
So this is a very healthy relationship and we have a very good story to tell.<br />
But to maintain it at this level we need to work on it. Because, paradoxically,<br />
there are dangers in our very closeness and familiarity with each other.<br />
It can make the familiar views we have of each other harder to discard when<br />
they are no longer relevant. We can get stuck with images of each other<br />
which are out of date.<br />
Precisely because this relationship is so old, it brings with it a lot of<br />
preconceptions which can impede a clear view of each other.<br />
I have no doubt that Australia needs to see Malaysia in a new way and that<br />
the same is true in the other direction. </p>
<p>Australians need to look at Malaysia, not through the prism of the Emergency<br />
or Confrontation or the Colombo Plan connections, but in the context of the<br />
dynamism and change which have made it Southeast Asia's fastest-growing<br />
economy 9 per cent this year and an average of 8.5 per cent per year over<br />
the past seven years.<br />
And during that same period, Malaysian exports have grown each year at<br />
double-digit rates.<br />
This economic growth has been almost entirely driven by the expansion of<br />
Malaysia's manufacturing sector which contributed 20 per cent of GDP in<br />
1985 but 31 per cent in 1994.<br />
This is a remarkable national achievement.<br />
Looking the other way, I hope Malaysians will see a modern multicultural<br />
Australia which is not an outpost of Europe or North America, which is not<br />
trying to be Asian or American or African or anything other than what we are,<br />
but which is economically strong, technologically sophisticated and endowed<br />
with resources which complement the needs of Malaysia and the other rapidly<br />
developing countries of Asia.<br />
Future success for the Australia -Malaysian relationship depends on our<br />
recognising that these changes are underway and building on them. We can<br />
continue to do the sort of things we have been doing, but we need to do them<br />
in new ways. And we need to take advantage of the economic and social<br />
changes in both our countries to find new things to do together.<br />
For example, Dr Mahathir and I agree that technology and research will be an<br />
important new area for cooperation. We discussed in Jakarta last year the<br />
opportunities for us in environmental technology. Australian Cooperative<br />
Research Centres and Malaysian institutions like the Standards and<br />
Industrial Research Institute of Malaysia, are already pursuing these those<br />
opportunities, and discussing collaborative research into polymers and<br />
aeronautics. In the field of education, where our relationship has been so close, we need<br />
to think less in terms of Malaysian students coming to Australia for their<br />
education, and more about new approaches such as opening Australian<br />
campuses in Malaysia or twinning Australian and Malaysian educational<br />
institutions allowing Malaysian students to share their tertiary degree<br />
between the two countries.<br />
But I have to say that I hope that, in these changes, we will not lose the<br />
opportunity for students from each country to live and study in the other. And<br />
I am pleased to note that some Australian students are now beginning to<br />
pursue their studies in Malaysia. That has been a source of the remarkable<br />
strength in this relationship, and we need to preserve it. </p>
<p>In the area of trade we are already seeing the results of the changes in our<br />
two economies.<br />
Fully one quarter of our trade now comprises Elaborately Transformed<br />
Manufactures. This reflects both Australia's increasing competitiveness in<br />
manufacturing, and the sophistication of the Malaysian economy.<br />
And our long standing investment relationship is one of the healthiest in the<br />
region. We each have investments worth several billion dollars in the other<br />
country. Malaysian investment in Australia has been growing quickly by 34<br />
per cent in 1994 and diversifying into new areas. And while Australian<br />
investment in Malaysia is growing well with over 200 businesses now<br />
represented there I would like to see more growth.<br />
These are some of the matters I hope to discuss when, as I can now<br />
announce, I visit Malaysia officially on 15 and 16 January. I am very much<br />
looking forward to the opportunity of talking to Dr Mahathir and his colleagues<br />
and to seeing developments in Malaysia for myself.<br />
Few relationships between countries have such a base of goodwill as this<br />
one. It has a flying start.<br />
I am sure the Australia-Malaysia Society's activities will complement the work<br />
of the Malaysia-Australia Foundation and other organisations which have<br />
been established to foster people-to-people links between Australia and<br />
Malaysia including the Canberra based Australian/ Malaysian Society in<br />
deepening this relationship. The Society's first project a photographic<br />
exhibition on multiculturalism in Australia and Malaysia, to be shown<br />
simultaneously in both countries is an excellent way to start. I understand<br />
that Dr Mahathir's daughter, Marina Mahathir, proposed this project, following<br />
her own very successful exhibition " Eyes on ASEAN" in Australia last year.<br />
It only remains for me to congratulate all of you, and Ric Charlton in<br />
particular, for the work which has been put into establishing the Society.<br />
It gives me great pleasure to launch the Society formally and to wish it well for<br />
the future. </p>
