    <content><![CDATA[<p>On behalf of the Australian Government, I congratulate Paul Lennon on his productive four years as Premier of Tasmania.</p>
<p>Entering state parliament in 1990, Premier Lennon has had a long and distinguished career serving the people of Tasmania for over 30 years in public life as a unionist and politician.</p>
<p>Mr Lennon served in the office of Deputy Premier with distinction on the election of the Bacon Government in 1998. As well as Deputy Premier Mr Lennon took carriage of a series of senior portfolios in the Bacon Government. During that time he was often described as the engine-room of the State Government.</p>
<p>In the most tragic of circumstances, Premier Lennon stepped up to the Premiership of Tasmania in February 2004 with the resignation of the late Jim Bacon.</p>
<p>As Premier, Mr Lennon was a proud and fierce advocate for the interests of his beloved state.</p>
<p>Premier Lennon was dedicated to the cause of developing modern economic infrastructure in Tasmania and was determined to bridge the gap between indigenous and non indigenous Australians in Tasmania.</p>
<p>I wish Mr Lennon, his wife Margaret and their family the very best of luck and every success in their future endeavours.</p>
