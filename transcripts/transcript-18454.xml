<p>Mr Speaker, nuclear weapons are a reality in our world ... a real challenge to our resolve to build a better world.</p>
<p>A challenge which needs to be faced by all nations ... one not to be ignored ... and one Australia cannot and will not ignore.</p>
<p>We are realistic about eliminating nuclear weapons.</p>
<p>It will be difficult, it will take time and ultimately, it will require a stable international security environment. </p>
<p>But it can be done. </p>
<p>Indeed, progress has been made: there are many fewer nuclear warheads in the world today than there were in 1989.</p>
<p>This is why Australia supports the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, the International Atomic Energy Agency and the disarmament initiatives of the United Nations and the Nuclear Weapon States themselves.</p>
<p>Why Australia supports the United Nations Security Council's measures against the nuclear programs of Iran and North Korea.</p>
<p>Why Australia has our own sanctions targeting the programs of proliferation in these countries.</p>
<p>Why we are introducing additional sanctions measures against Iran, comparable to those of the EU.</p>
<p>And why we urge Iran to comply with its United Nations Security Council and IAEA obligations.</p>
<p>Why Australia also actively supports the Financial Action Task Force and other international measures to combat the financing of WMD proliferation.</p>
<p>And why Australia supports President Obama's call to secure all vulnerable nuclear materials by 2014  -  and the commitments made at the 2010 Nuclear Security Summit in Washington.</p>
<p>Because these measures have made a difference and because they continue to do so.</p>
<p>Australia has made a difference in past years.</p>
<p>Including through our leading role in the negotiation of major international arms control instruments such as the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty and the IAEA's Additional Protocol.</p>
<p>We have a strong and longstanding record of activism and achievement on nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation.</p>
<p>In 1972, when we joined with New Zealand at the International Court of Justice in actions against nuclear testing in the Pacific.</p>
<p>In 1995, when we established the Canberra Commission on the elimination of nuclear weapons.</p>
<p>In 2008, when with Japan we established and supported the independent International Commission on Nuclear Non-Proliferation and Disarmament (ICNND).</p>
<p>In 2010 when we again partnered with Japan to establish the Non-Proliferation and Disarmament Initiative.</p>
<p>We take our nuclear obligations seriously.</p>
<p>That is why Australia exports uranium only for peaceful purposes, under the strictest safeguards  -  now and into the future.</p>
<p>And why we will make a difference again next week, combating the threat of nuclear terrorism, when I participate with other world leaders at the Seoul Nuclear Security Summit.</p>
<p>I commend the members of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, including its Chair, the Member for Wills, for their tireless advocacy of non-proliferation and disarmament that led to this motion.</p>
<p>Now, today, this Parliament, with this motion, can state our ambition to make a difference in future years too.</p>
<p>That is why I move this motion.</p>
<p>And that is why I welcome the fact the Leader of the Opposition will second it as well.</p>
<p>A world without nuclear weapons is a long-term commitment ... we may not see it in the time of any of us in this House.</p>
<p>But one day, our successors should say of nuclear fear: the threat has passed; the game is over; never again.  </p>
<p>I commend this motion to the House.</p>
