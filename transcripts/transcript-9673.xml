PRIME MINISTER<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER. THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
SITUATION 1IN BOSNIA<br />
All Australians have been horrified by the bloodshed and human rights abuses in<br />
Bosnia, and appalled by the misery that has been inflicted on the civilian population in<br />
the former Yugoslavia.<br />
In particular, we feel for those among us who have families and friends and ties with<br />
communities caught up in the fighting.<br />
The Bosnian Serb capture of Srebrenica and continuing Bosnian Serb attacks on other<br />
UN ' safe areas' have provoked another exodus of families and a wave of suffering, with<br />
horrific violations of human rights.<br />
The latest acts of aggression by the Bosnian Serb forces are a moral affront to all of us.<br />
They offend every international standard of decency.<br />
The international community faces immensely difficult decisions about how to respond<br />
to this critical situation.<br />
Though often criticised, UNPROFOR's operations with the UN High Commissioner<br />
for Refugees ( UNHCR) in the former Yugoslavia have helped protect nearly three<br />
million people affected by the conflict. Despite the extreme difficulties imposed on<br />
UNPROFOR by confused mandates, it can continue to make an important contribution<br />
to the humanitarian effort and in restraining conflict in the former Yugoslavia.<br />
The Australian Government welcomes the agreement in London among the countries<br />
most involved in peace efforts in the former Yugoslavia and the UN to ensure access<br />
for supplies to the civilian population in Sarajevo and to meet further Bosnian Serb<br />
offensives with a decisive and effective response. </p>
<p>In order to help relieve immediate suffering, the Government has decided to provide a<br />
new $ 3 million aid package.<br />
Australia will provide $ 1.5 million to the UN lead agency in the former Yugoslavia, the<br />
UNHCR, and $ 750,000 to the World Food Program. We will also provide $ 350,000<br />
to kick-start a joint appeal announced today by UNHCR and Austcare for cash<br />
contributions to make up family survival kits with food, blankets, clothing and other<br />
essential items.<br />
The Government will give World Vision Australia $ 350,000 for its program to provide<br />
food and care to displaced people in and around Zenica. And we will provide $ 50,000<br />
to Austcare to support local women's initiatives to help women who have been subject<br />
to violence.<br />
This package of assistance is additional to the almost $ 5 million the Government has<br />
already provided to the victims of the conflict in the former Yugoslavia, including a<br />
contribution of $ 500,000 to help civilians displaced by the latest fighting announced by<br />
the Acting Foreign Minister on 18 July.<br />
Since the outbreak of the conflict in 1991 Australia has accepted for resettlement some<br />
14,000 victims of the war. This financial year, provision has been made for an<br />
additional 5,600 people under the Government's humanitarian program.<br />
Sir Ninian Stephen and other expert Australian staff work with the International<br />
Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia.<br />
It is in the interests of the entire international community that the crisis in Bosnia be<br />
brought to an end and an enduring peace established in the Former Yugoslavia. That<br />
means all participants must make a determined effort to negotiate a settlement.<br />
