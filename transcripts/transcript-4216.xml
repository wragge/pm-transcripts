JjjAUSTRALIA<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR PRESS 18 August 1976<br />
1976-77 BUDGET<br />
The Government's first budget is an imaginative blueprint<br />
for national recovery and reform.<br />
The Budget will promote recovery. The Budget shows,-concern<br />
for the welfare of people in need.<br />
Australians consumers and investors now have the<br />
opportunity to plan ahead in the confident expectation<br />
that inflation can and will be beaten.<br />
It is a clear and unequivocal demonstration of our<br />
willingness and determination to act with economic and<br />
social responsibility.<br />
Australians now see that the Liberal/ NCP Government is resolved<br />
to act in their best interests. We are determined to<br />
attack inflation in a firm and planned way-. There is<br />
no alternative.<br />
The budget provides producers, businessmen and manufacturers<br />
from the great national corporations to the corner store with<br />
the confidence to invest, produce and expand.<br />
It is also a budget of concern.<br />
The aged, handicapped, homeless, children, pensioners and<br />
ethnic groups all benefit. For all these groups with<br />
particular needs the budget embodies significant and long<br />
overdue social reforms. It follows completely the same<br />
imaginative social thinking that led to our introduction of<br />
the family allowance scheme and full personal tax<br />
indexation in May this year.<br />
It is a budget that throws the ball fairly into the court<br />
of private enterprise.<br />
Private enterprise now has unparalled opportunities to realize<br />
its full potential. It has its. chance to demonstrate that the<br />
free enterprise system can restore the economic health that was<br />
destroyed by Labor socialism.<br />
The long road back for Australia is the responsibility of<br />
every Australian. The budget demonstrates that the-Government<br />
is playing its part. Australia needs unionists, union officials,<br />
private enterprise, State governments all sections of the<br />
community to work together to complete the task.<br />
