PRIME MINISTER Press Statement No. 242<br />
April 1974<br />
COMMITTEE ON INTEGRATION OF DATA SYSTEMS<br />
The Prime minister today released the Report prepared<br />
by the Committee on Integration of Data Systems.<br />
The Prime Minister recalled that in December 1973 he had<br />
appointed a Committee to advise on the general principles and<br />
administrative arrangements which would enable the Government to<br />
integrate the various departmental data systems servicing related<br />
areas of its social and economic policies. The membership of the<br />
Committee comprised Professor L. F. Crisp ( Chairman), Mr. B. Brogan,<br />
Mr. K. L. Brown, Mr. R. Jolly and Professor C. S. Wallace.<br />
The Prime Minister outlined in brief some of the-major<br />
repommendations put forward by the Committee. These included<br />
the recommendations that:<br />
1. The Australian Bureau of Statistics should be<br />
established as a central statistical authority<br />
and be administratively autonomous with the<br />
Statistician having the status and power of<br />
a Permanent Head;<br />
2. the Bureau should be responsible to, and the<br />
Statistician should make an annual report to<br />
Parliament through the Treasurer;<br />
3. the Bureau's continuing program and planned<br />
priorities should be subject to annual scrutiny<br />
by a representative National Statistics Advisory<br />
Council which should have the duty of advising<br />
the Treasurer conc erning them. The Council will<br />
include representatives of various groups, such as<br />
Trade Unionists, Employers, Universities and Civil<br />
Liberties organisations. The Chairman of the Council<br />
should be independent both of the Public Service and<br />
organised economic or social interests;<br />
4. the membership and functions of the existing annual<br />
Conference of Federal and State Statisticians should<br />
be extended to improve it as a vehicle for articulation<br />
of State statistical needs and priorities; / 2 </p>
