P. M. No. 47/ 961<br />
JOINT STATEMENT<br />
By the Prime Minister, the Rt. Hon. R. G. Menzies, and<br />
the lion. G. Nicklin, Premier of Queensland<br />
Last night re conferred at Canberra. Those present<br />
included, apart from ourselves, Mr. ' v,-rris ( Deputy Premier of<br />
Queensland), Mr. Hiley ( Treasurer of Queensland) Mr. McEwen, Mr.<br />
Holt, Senator Spooner, Mr. McMahon, Mr. Davidson, Sir Gaifield<br />
Barwick, Mr. Adermann, Dr. Cameron, Mr. Hulme.<br />
The first purpose of our conference was to discuss the<br />
Commonwealth's financial assistance to the Mount Isa-Collinsville<br />
railway in the light of the recent agreement betwccn the<br />
Coi-monwealth and lostern Australia regarding the Kalgoorlie-<br />
Kwinana industrial development and standardisation and of a<br />
diesclisation offer recently made to the Premier of South<br />
Australia. Those matters and the special features attaching to each<br />
were fully explained by the Prime Minister and closely discussed.<br />
In the result, the Queensland Ministers are fully satisfied with<br />
the proposals for CoTmmonwealth finance as being fair and<br />
reasonable. It will be recalled that these proposals for the<br />
Mount Isa line involved the making of repayable advances by the<br />
Commonwealth up to an amount of Å 20,000,000 as requested by the<br />
State to help to finance the total cost. On the most competent<br />
advice, it is agreed that the traffic on the new line should<br />
readily amortize the cost of the line and the repayment of the<br />
advances over a period of 20 years. The Government of<br />
Queensland will now sign the proposed agreement, which has been.<br />
ewaiting signature. This will enable Queensland to take up in<br />
the current financial year the sum of Å 4.6 million which the<br />
Commonwealth has stood willing to find in 1961-2 as the first<br />
instalment of its advances.<br />
Joth of us attach great importance to this railway<br />
project, one of the biggest undertaken in Australia in this<br />
century. It will facilitate the full development of the great<br />
Mount Isa Mine and will also serve substantial developmental endsin<br />
both the mineral and pastoral industries of North Queensland.<br />
oe are, for these reasons, both happy that all misunderstandings<br />
have been removed and that the project may go " full steam ahead".<br />
For both the State of Queensland and Australia as a whole, this<br />
is a most significant event.<br />
An opportunity was also taken of discussing beef roads<br />
in Queensland. As is well known, the Commonwealth Governmont has<br />
displayed active interest in this matter having regard to the<br />
need for exports and the great possibilities of their increase by<br />
increasing the effective marketing of beef cattle in the Vorth.<br />
Mr. Monzies recalled that in a statement on February<br />
21st on developmental prospects he had referrod to the development<br />
of roads in the North. Mr. Holt had also specifically referred<br />
to this matter in his Budget Speech indicating a willingness to<br />
provide additional funds for these purposes in Queensland and<br />
[., estern Australia. In the existing Connmowealth Budget,<br />
provision is made for the Common ealth to find Å 650,000 for the<br />
Julia Creek-Normanton road with a matching arrangement on the part<br />
of Queensland. In our conference last night, w all agreed that it<br />
would be more satisfactory from the point of view of effective<br />
planning if a longer prograr. u' could be worked out. The Prime<br />
Iinister, recalling the special arrangements that had been made </p>
<p>some years back to find Å 5,000,000 for the State of Western<br />
Australia for northern development, said that the Commonwealth<br />
would be prepared to find, in respct of Queensland2 Å 5,000,000<br />
for beef roads over the five year period to June 19o6, This<br />
Å 5,000,000 will include the " 650,000 already agreed upon this<br />
year. But in respect of Å 4,350,000 representing the balance of<br />
the proposed Å 5,000,000, the State will not be obliged to undertake<br />
matching expenditure. This offer, which we agree should do<br />
much to help this important industry, is willingly accepted by<br />
Queensland. As in the earlier case of Western Australia, the<br />
off-r provides that the State will submit to the Commonwealth for<br />
its approval details of the projects upon which it proposes to<br />
spend the Commonwealth grant. It was also made clear, as Mr.<br />
Holt had indicated in the Budget, that part of the additional sum<br />
could be made available to the State during this financial year.<br />
It should also be made clear that the total sum of Å 5,000,000<br />
need not necessarily be spent at an even million a year, but is a<br />
five-year's sum..<br />
The Premier said that for its part the Queensland<br />
Gova. rnr nt would lose no time in submitting to the Commonwealth<br />
details of further road projects, the planning of which was<br />
already far advanced.<br />
, e are very conscious of the fact that additional<br />
traffic will be attracted to the Mount Isa line as a result of<br />
the joint arrangements that we have just described for a more<br />
intensive development of the beef industry in North Queensland.<br />
This we are glad to observe will strengthen the capacity of the<br />
Mount Isa railway line to pay for its total cost in the period<br />
of 20 years. Our discussions were frank and searching, but most<br />
harmonious. On behalf of our respective governments, we<br />
express our pleasure at the conclusions arrived at, which will<br />
enable great and important work to go on without interruption.<br />
CAN BRRA,<br />
1st September, 1961. </p>
