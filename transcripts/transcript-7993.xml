PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW WITH WARWICK BEUTLER, AM PROGRAM,<br />
23 MARCH 1990<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
BEUTLER: Two of three major newspapers have endorsed you<br />
today but the Australian rejects you. But even those<br />
papers that do endorse you, do so reluctantly.<br />
0 PM: Yes, I wouldn't say it was, you know, an absolute<br />
black an white and that's, that's fair enough. I mean, I<br />
don't claim that we have been perfect, nor do I claim<br />
we're perfect now, but politics is about an imperfect<br />
world and the electors of Australia, tomorrow, have a<br />
clear choice and on that choice there is no doubt, in the<br />
judgement of many, not only in the newspapers, that it<br />
must be for Hawke and Labor.<br />
BEUTLER: Yes, but the editorial writers and the voters<br />
seem to be saying that you've had long enough. They're<br />
sick and tired of the obfuscation, the excuses they're<br />
not certain that the Liberals are any better than you<br />
are. What does it say about you and what does it say<br />
about our system if you have to win this election by<br />
default? PM: I don't say that we'll win it by default. If we win<br />
on the poll of the electorate we will win because in the<br />
judgement of the majority of the people, we're the best<br />
party to govern Australia into the future and that, in my<br />
judgement, would be a correct decision. But one of the<br />
essential features, I think, in the judgement is and will<br />
be which Party is about fairness and equity as well as a<br />
capacity for economic growth and I think the outstanding,<br />
indeed, that glaring illustration, Warwick, of the<br />
relative concepts of fairness and what I come down is<br />
in regard to tax. Let me just give you these figures,<br />
very briefly.<br />
BEUTLER: Very briefly.<br />
PM: But to me they starkly set out the difference.<br />
Under the wage tax arrangement that we've just<br />
negotiated, the person on average weekly earnings at<br />
about $ 28,000 a year gets a tax cut of $ 7.50 a week. I,<br />
as Prime Minister, get $ 13.25 so that's the<br />
relationship, $ 7.50 if you're on average weekly earnings<br />
and the Prime Minister gets $ 13.25. What Mr Peacock is </p>
<p>e-I 2.<br />
proposing under his two tier system is that the person on<br />
average weekly earnings gets a tax cut of $ 4.73 a week<br />
and he gets $ 100 a week more than that, $ 104.46. Now<br />
there you've got it<br />
BEUTLER: Sure.<br />
PM: The concept of fairness.<br />
BEUTLER: Sure, but I think the essential problem that<br />
voters are facing in this election is that they simply<br />
don't believe either of you. They don't believe you and<br />
they don't believe the Opposition.<br />
PM: On the question of tax, on the question of tax<br />
there's no question of belief or not belief. There it is<br />
BEUTLER: Well they don't believe you on interest rates,<br />
they don't believe you on interest rates.<br />
PM: Well you sit there in the comfort of your studio and<br />
assert that. I don't have any evidence to say they don't<br />
believe us on interest rates, particularly, Warwick, when<br />
the banking industry is saying that interest rates will<br />
come down if the Government is elected and not only are<br />
they saying that, but the market is saying that the<br />
coming down of interest rates depends upon Labor. You<br />
know what was on the Reuters screen the other night, they<br />
are saying a further easing in monetary policy in the<br />
next few weeks assuming, their words, assuming the Hawke<br />
Labor Government is re-elected at Saturday's federal<br />
election. So that's what the market is saying, but it<br />
depends upon us being re-elected.<br />
BEUTLER: And they don't believe you on another statement<br />
of yours, that if you win, you'll lead the Government<br />
into the next election.<br />
PM: But it's very easy for you to say they don't believe<br />
it. You haven't got one shred of evidence, my dear<br />
Warwick, to, to sustain your proposition that they don't<br />
believe that. You've got not one piece of evidence. All<br />
you've got is the abysmal assertion' of Hewson that when<br />
the Hawke Government wins, that I'm going to last there<br />
for three months and then I'm going to resign. That's<br />
all you've got.<br />
BEUTLER: Well<br />
PM: Hewson's assertion. Just understand what it means.<br />
What it means is that these people in the Opposition are<br />
frightened about the fact that the electorate seems to<br />
infinitely prefer Hawke to Peacock and so they're trying<br />
to say oh well look, if you vote for Bob, you're not<br />
going to get him. There's one person who knows, one<br />
person who knows Hawke's intention and that's a bloke<br />
called Bob Hawke and let me tell your listeners, now,<br />
unqualified, when we win on Saturday then I will be Prime </p>
<p>3.<br />
Minister for the full three year term and Mr Peacock and<br />
Mr Hewson in their desperation can try and peddle another<br />
story, but they are wrong and they are desperate.<br />
BEUTLER: But it simply doesn't sound like Bob, Bob<br />
Hawke. Why not, why not got out on top? You win this<br />
election, you retire within a year, you leave Paul<br />
Keating or someone else a very real chance of winning the<br />
next election. Isn't that the Bob Hawke<br />
PM: I, I would suggest that I leave a better legacy for<br />
the Party if I lead the Party for another three years,<br />
take them into another election and they've been in for<br />
ten years and then whoever is elected to succeed me,<br />
takes over. I mean you are, you're really trying to<br />
desperately build a straw man and you haven't got the<br />
elements there, mate.<br />
BEUTLER: OK. Andrew Peacock gave you a fright in 1984.<br />
How tough an opponent was he this time?<br />
PM: I said before this election started and you will<br />
recall it, I said before the election started, I hope<br />
that the Liberals and the commentators make the mistake<br />
of assuming that 1990 could be judged in terms of 1984<br />
and there is, as I see it now, a unanimous judgement that<br />
1990, as far as the campaign was concerned, hasn't been<br />
1984.<br />
BEUTLER: What would Bob Hawke, as ex Prime Minister, do<br />
if you were defeated tomorrow?<br />
PM: Well, I heard Mr Peacock saying that he wasn't<br />
contemplating defeat and fair enough, I'm not<br />
contemplating it, so, you know, I think it's a totally<br />
hypothetical question. I hope that I've shown in my<br />
public life that I have the capacity to accept victory<br />
and defeat with, with good grace.<br />
BEUTLER: Alright. Well let's look at the other<br />
hypothetical that you are returned tomorrow. What would<br />
happen to some of the issues that you've been unwilling<br />
to talk about in this campaign?<br />
PM: What's the issue I've been unwilling to talk about?<br />
BUTLER: Well, issues that you say are peripheral.<br />
PM: Well, give me one.<br />
BEUTLER: Privatisation, privatisation a peripheral<br />
issue you called it.<br />
PM: but you say I'm unwilling to talk about it.<br />
That BEUTLER: You've called it peripheral.<br />
i. </p>
<p>4.<br />
PM: it is a different proposition I won't let you<br />
get away with that it's a different proposition to say<br />
that I've said it's peripheral, to say I've refused to<br />
talk about it.<br />
BEUTLER: No, I said you were unwilling to talk about it<br />
PM: No, I'm quite willing to talk about it. Any<br />
question that's been put, I've been willing to talk about<br />
and I'll talk about it now for ten minutes if you want me<br />
to.<br />
BEUTLER: Well, will you be pushing for privatisation of<br />
Qantas, the Commonwealth Bank? I mean, is it back on the<br />
agenda<br />
PM: OK, let's get it. The Commonwealth Bank, I mean,<br />
you really are somewhat uninformed aren't you? I have<br />
never argued for the privatisation of the Commonwealth<br />
Bank so why would I, why would I argue for the<br />
privatisation of the Commonwealth Bank now when I've<br />
never done it before?<br />
BEUTLER: Is privatisation back on the agenda?<br />
PM: Privatisation is on the agenda in the sense that<br />
I've talked about. That is that in regard to two<br />
institutions, the two airlines, we have a Committee of<br />
the ALP looking at the funding of them. If you want to<br />
say that that has privatisation on the agenda, you can<br />
describe it that way. It is a question of what's the<br />
best way of dealing with the question of the capital<br />
requirements of the two airlines. Now we have a Committee<br />
which is looking at that when I have been asked this<br />
question during the campaign, Warwick, I haven't dodged<br />
it I have said that's what's happening and when we get<br />
the report of the Committee we'll consider it.<br />
BEUTLER: OK Prime Minister..<br />
PM: But it is only in regard to those two.<br />
BEUTLER: At the start of this campaign you used that<br />
word bonkers. Have we gone bonkers?<br />
PM: I think some people have gone bonkers but I<br />
certainly haven't and you haven't Warwick and I don't<br />
think the media generally has but it hasn't been a<br />
bonkerless sort of outcome but I don't want to identify<br />
the areas of bonkerness.<br />
BEUTLER: OK. Good luck tomorrow.<br />
PM: Thanks very much indeed.<br />
Ends </p>
