<p>MIKE MUNRO:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, thanks for your time.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Hello Mike.</p>
<p>MIKE MUNRO:</p>
<p>You must feel like King Canute trying to hold back the tidal wave</p>
<p>   of One Nation. Do you?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No I don't. It certainly did better in Queensland than I expected</p>
<p>   but I have been through a lot of such experiences in politics. The</p>
<p>   best response I can give, and the Government can give, is to govern</p>
<p>   better in the interests of the Australian people. There was an obvious</p>
<p>   message in the Queensland result and we don't want to be overwhelmed</p>
<p>   by it but we can't ignore it.</p>
<p>MIKE MUNRO:</p>
<p>What do you see that message as being?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I think it's a collection of things. I think in economic times</p>
<p>   of change people feel vulnerable and ignored particularly in rural</p>
<p>   areas. There is a weariness with the combative style of politics</p>
<p>   between the two major parties. Sometimes we look as though we are</p>
<p>   point-scoring off each other rather than solving the problems of</p>
<p>   the country.</p>
<p>MIKE MUNRO:</p>
<p>Sometimes or all the time?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, sometimes, because a lot of the time we are not doing that</p>
<p>   but those combative bits get reported more than the others because</p>
<p>   they make good theatre and make good television, so we can all learn</p>
<p>   a lesson from that. One of the things I told my ministerial colleagues</p>
<p>   today was that we had to focus on very tight, succinct responses</p>
<p>   in Question Time to focus on issues that are relevant to people.</p>
<p>   When you are in high office like I am you should never so lack humility</p>
<p>   as to pretend that people aren't all the time trying to send</p>
<p>   you a message and I think the Australian public is sending a message</p>
<p>   to all of us that they want us to govern better for them. I accept</p>
<p>   that but by the same token now that One Nation has won seats in</p>
<p>   Parliament it has to be accountable for its policies. It can't</p>
<p>   run around the country saying we've got a simple solution for</p>
<p>   something. It will now have to demonstrate to people that it can</p>
<p>   actually do things better. </p>
<p>MIKE MUNRO:</p>
<p>But a year ago you said Pauline Hanson wouldn't be around</p>
<p>   at the next election?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I was wrong, wasn't I? And I don't mind admitting</p>
<p>   that.</p>
<p>MIKE MUNRO:</p>
<p>And very wrong?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Okay, well I am wrong. I mean it won't be the first mistake</p>
<p>   I have made in my life nor will it be the last and I don't</p>
<p>   mind acknowledging that but the thing now is to focus on the future</p>
<p>   and let us say how we handle it. Now we handle it in a number of</p>
<p>   ways. We govern better, we focus on things that matter to people,</p>
<p>   we remind people of what we've done. We don't abandon</p>
<p>   necessary reforms like giving them a fairer taxation system and</p>
<p>   we also, all of us in public office, learn a bit of humility, listen</p>
<p>   to people better but by the same token don't agree with nonsense</p>
<p>   when it's put forward. And some of the propositions that One</p>
<p>   Nation has put forward are wrong. I mean, for example, the idea</p>
<p>   that you would print money to finance two per cent loans is not</p>
<p>   only wrong but it's also quite dangerous to the savings of</p>
<p>   retired Australians and I think over time those sorts of things</p>
<p>   will come out.</p>
<p>MIKE MUNRO:</p>
<p>But that is the bottom line, that like never before the Australian</p>
<p>   public is so disenchanted, so disillusioned with all political parties,</p>
<p>   not just the Coalition. They really have in the vernacular Â‘had</p>
<p>   a gutful'. What do you do?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well some of...well, you certainly don't sort of go out and</p>
<p>   slash your wrists. You try and understand why, you listen to people.</p>
<p>   If you agree with them you say so, if you don't agree you also</p>
<p>   say so. You don't lose your own self respect, you don't</p>
<p>   lose your own belief in the things that you are doing for the future</p>
<p>   of the country and I certainly intend to spend even more time travelling</p>
<p>   around the country listening to and talking to Australians. And</p>
<p>   you also take the opportunity to point out that One Nation is also</p>
<p>   a political party. It's made up of politicians. Those politicians</p>
<p>   are putting forward policies that have got to be examined and where</p>
<p>   they are wrong and where they are not accountable they will be judged</p>
<p>   by the same rules as the rest of us. And over time you will see</p>
<p>   the fragility and the errors of many of the policies that are being</p>
<p>   put forward.</p>
<p>MIKE MUNRO:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, you have now bitten the bullet and agreed to put One</p>
<p>   Nation last on your seat's preferences. Now is this a matter</p>
<p>   of expediency or principle?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No look, I decided some weeks ago to do this but because of the</p>
<p>   election in Queensland I felt that the Queensland division haven</p>
<p>   taken a decision that it wasn't appropriate to announce it</p>
<p>   then. But these things will be decided on a State-by-State basis</p>
<p>   but I expect that most, if not all, situations will be that One</p>
<p>   Nation will be last.</p>
<p> MIKE MUNRO:</p>
<p>As a matter of principle, would you prefer a Labor MP?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh look, that is a hypothetical question. Look as a matter of principle</p>
<p>   I like Liberal and National Party MPs and this business of which</p>
<p>   degrees of separation do you feel from your political opponents</p>
<p>   - I mean, my principle political opponents are the Labor Party but</p>
<p>   my aim in life is to get Liberals and Nationals elected to Parliament.</p>
<p>MIKE MUNRO:</p>
<p>So shouldn't you be showing some leadership when it comes</p>
<p>   to preferences?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, I think.....</p>
<p>MIKE MUNRO:</p>
<p>You're the Prime Minister.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I think what I should be showing is leadership on policy and</p>
<p>   that's what we are doing by tackling such things as taxation</p>
<p>   reform, getting the Australian economic house in order and stronger</p>
<p>   in the face of the Asian economic challenge. I mean we have made</p>
<p>   this economy much stronger than it would otherwise have been. We</p>
<p>   are willing to try and give the Australian people a fairer tax system</p>
<p>   and the Labor Party and One Nation have joined hands to try and</p>
<p>   stop the Australian people having a fairer and better taxation system.</p>
<p>   Now, the leadership that the Australian people wanted me at a time</p>
<p>   like this is to say that this will be good for Australia, to argue</p>
<p>   why it is good for Australia and to stand against those who want</p>
<p>   to hang on to the present taxation system which is so clearly seen</p>
<p>   by most Australians as being very unfair and quite unworkable.</p>
<p>MIKE MUNRO:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, we appreciate your time.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>It's a pleasure.</p>
