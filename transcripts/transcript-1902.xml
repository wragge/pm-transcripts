S. C. B. G. S. ( SHORE) TRIDENT DEVELOPMENT<br />
PROJECT LAUNCHING DINNER<br />
SYDNEY, NSV# 22 JULY, 1968<br />
Speech by the Prime Minister, Mr John Gorton<br />
Mr Presiding Chairman, Mrs Dixon, Mr Headmaster, Member of Parliament,<br />
Ladies and Gentlemen: It is extremely pleasant for me to have the opportunity to talk<br />
tonight to a number of people who, for the most part, are directly<br />
involved with Shore or, in the case of the female population present,<br />
indirectly involved with Shore. The ladies, no doubt, have been regaled<br />
with anecdotes of what happened when their husbands were at Shore. I<br />
am going to add to some of those anecdotes, if you will forgive me,<br />
because I am really a ring-in in a way.<br />
Two or three years at a fairly early age, I suppose, is not<br />
the same as staying for the whole of one's education'at the one institution,<br />
but nevertheless, those two or three years left a number of indelible<br />
impre. ssions upon me. As Tim Halstead and some of those others who<br />
were with me in the old observatory, which was known as Robson House,<br />
will bear out, those were days which one remembers.<br />
I started as a boy, and that was wonderful, and then as<br />
a weeldy boarder and that was not so bad, and then as a boarder, and I<br />
suppose that was bearable. In those days and this is quite incredible<br />
there was a system under which a housemaster in charge of a house was<br />
paid a certain sum per head per pupil. And anything he could make on<br />
keeping that pupil went into his own pocket, with the result that we were<br />
fed, but I think that on the whole we would have been able to equate ourselves<br />
with " yon Cassius" whom you may remember had a " lean and hungry look".<br />
Tonight I have learnt in the dormitories in this house there<br />
have just been installed carpets is that correct, Mr Headmaster?<br />
Carpets really I don't know what the world is coming to, because my<br />
mind goes back to when very large rats used to run over us every night<br />
I assure you this is quite true:' and being young, and with all the things<br />
that one has when one is young, we managed to buy ourselves these wire<br />
mesh rat traps which we put on the bed. Every now and again somebody<br />
would go " Clonk! I've got one" and we wo aid all rush out and drown it<br />
in the bath and watch the bubbles coming up. This is perfectly true.<br />
That was the way it used to be and I don't think it really did any of us any<br />
harm. But I do remember by contrast between Shore and Geelong Grammar<br />
one strange delicacy concerning Shore, which didn't obta in i~ n the later<br />
schocl to which I went.<br />
When one had somehow or other offended authority in Shore in<br />
those days, they said, " V alk out in front of the class and get chastised"<br />
and they had great canes in those days. They said, " Hold out your hiand"<br />
and they would beat you on your hand. They were much more indelicate in<br />
the later school to which I went. They didn't beat you on your hands at<br />
all, though they beat you just as frequently and just as hard. / 2 </p>
<p>-2<br />
I am sorry that tonight two people that I remember so<br />
well and to whom I owe so much are not here. One is Pat Eldershaw, who<br />
was a housemaster of distinction. He is a man to wthom I owe a great deal.<br />
I am not sure that this wasn't in some way mitigated. You see, he did so<br />
well at teaching me in Lower 4C that I managed to be sort of the top of the<br />
class and was therefore promoted to Upper 4A, and that left a gap which<br />
I didn't understand, and ever since that time, I have never been any good<br />
at academic pursuits at all.<br />
I did go to the Headmaster at the time, Mr Robson.. I was<br />
a very small boy and this was obviously very wrong.... and I said, " I think<br />
you'ye promoted me too far, I don't quite understand this, and he said,<br />
" Take your hands off the desk and stand to attention. You will go where<br />
you are told, so I went where I was told. But they were really, in spite<br />
of these things all of which I said are true.... you didn't believe the rats<br />
but it was true -it did no harm to any single one of us. I am positive of that.<br />
0 The othaer m-an who I am sorry is not here tonight is Bingeye<br />
tBoelSl, owehof ois a vhery alekanb, otakll Quaeennts lansddert whoe, rwnh en hoet first ocam ne dwown<br />
Queenslanders weren't in those days, so on every possible occasion, he used<br />
to take them off and tie the laces together and hang them around his nec.<br />
But he turned into one of the best oarsmen and one of the best boxers and one<br />
of the best house captains, and one of the best citizens that Shore or<br />
Australia has ever had.<br />
There we were in those days, and so many of you who are here<br />
tonight were there with me, when we had education " reading, writing,<br />
' rithmetic, taught with the aid of a hickory stick". And do you remember we<br />
had thirties, the origin of which I never understood until tonight. If you<br />
had somehow or other offended authority, you got one thirty and that didn't<br />
matter you just wrote that in a book. If you did it again, you got two<br />
thirties, and that didn't really matter. Nothing happened. But once you<br />
b got three thirties, you had to go and drill under the sergeant. Do you<br />
remember? On that asphalt place for half an hour. If you got four<br />
thirties, you had to come back on Saturday mornings. I don' t know whether<br />
that still obtains. I hope it does because I think it is a good disciplinary<br />
application. Forty years ago there was a completely different approach to<br />
education from that which we now have. In some ways, I think it was a<br />
little better, because when you did wrong, you got clobbered, and when you<br />
do wrong, you ought to get clobbered. But those days lacked the foresight,<br />
the attempt to understand the individual chpracter and the individual capacities<br />
of the schoolboy and this is now one of those hallmarks of schools such<br />
as Shore, and of our general educational system.<br />
Though I am a little sad I hope the Press won't take this down,<br />
because if they do, it will be misreported though I am a little sad that<br />
discipline and corporal punishment is not as freely. u sed as it was, and<br />
instead people are given lectures which are much harder to take, never theless<br />
the general approach to education mnust be agreed to be greatly improved.<br />
Where, then, do the independent schools and where, then, does a national<br />
as distinct from a state government come into the picture in endeavouring<br />
to foster this improvement? / 3~ </p>
<p>-3<br />
Well, insofar as the independent schools are concerned, I<br />
have no hesitation in saying this that there always has been in Australia<br />
a right for people to choose whether they will, at some sacrifice to them ' selves,<br />
send their children to a school other than those run freely by a government.<br />
And there always ought to be a right for people to malke that choice. It is<br />
a democratic right people ought to be alle to exercise.<br />
Secondly, there is an educational advantage. I do not say<br />
that merit lies in independent schools, or merit lies in government schools.<br />
Quite clearly, as the development of education in Australia has shown, there<br />
is no monopoly of merit either in the independent or in the government school<br />
systems. But I think there would be a danger, if there were to be only one<br />
system in a state or in a nation, that that system might become monolithic, and<br />
because it became monolithic, might become moribund. Therefore, if there<br />
is a chance of a different approach, of a different evaluation, of selecting this<br />
method of education instead of that, then that can only be of benefit both to<br />
the pupils at independent and to the pupils at government. schools. The<br />
systems must interact upon each other, as they do, and the independent<br />
schools must be prepared to take from the government schools the advances<br />
which they have proved, and the government schools are prepared and have<br />
taken from the independent schools the advances they have proved. This<br />
reacts to the benefit of the children and the pupil. So this again is a reason<br />
for the support by governments of independent schools.<br />
I believe that Sir Robert Menzies as Prime Minister, and<br />
if I may s ay so, myself as his first Minister of Education and Science,<br />
and before that as the man to whom he gave the running of Commonwealth<br />
intervention in education have fostered the growth, and the development<br />
not only of independent but of government schools throughout Australia. In<br />
doing this, we were not only motivated by the things I have put before you.<br />
But also by another not insignificant matter, and that is that the economic<br />
cost to the community of maintaining a pupil at an independent school of any<br />
kind is much, much less than the economic cost to the community would be<br />
if all pupils were to go to government schools and all were to be completely<br />
supported by government taxation.<br />
So there was not only a democratic, there was not only an<br />
educational, but there was also an economic reason why schools such as Shore<br />
should be supported and maintained by governments and by those who have<br />
received the benefits of attending such schools and who wish their children<br />
to receive similar benefits.<br />
This is a great school with a great tradition in one State of<br />
a nation, but little less than a fortnight ago, my wife was talking to another<br />
great school in Brisbane, known up there as " Churchie", the Brisbane Church<br />
of England Boys Grammar School. ' There are in Western Australia and<br />
Tasmania and in every State of Australia, schools such as this, schools with<br />
great and long traditions. It is my hope and my belief that those pupils who<br />
attend these schools now will be taught that this country in which they live is<br />
a nation and no longer a collection of six colonies... and that those who<br />
come from Shore next year will in ten years be found working in Queensland,<br />
or Western Australia or South Australia, or wherever it may be; and that<br />
those who come from Brisbane Church of England Grammar School or from<br />
Geelong Grammar School, or wherever, will be found working in New South<br />
Wales because if there is one thing that is needed more than anything<br />
else in this nation today in the situation in which it finds itself, it is the / 4 </p>
<p>-4<br />
fostering of a national and not a colonial and not a state spirit. And I<br />
believe that in schools such as this, and indeed not only in schools such<br />
as this, this is the path of the future. But I air not sure, Sir, that schools<br />
such as this have not led the way towards such a path.<br />
This is another reason, I believe, why the Commonwealth<br />
Government has come into the field of education, come into it not only for<br />
the reasons I have already given you but because it is impossible to leave<br />
such an important, such a significant field to be developed to different levels<br />
in different parts of this nation such as ours. We could not now or in the<br />
future exist if we allowed, for example, in Queensland, the standard of<br />
educat-ion to fall below that in New South Wales or in Victoria, if we allowed<br />
the basic standard of education in any one part of our country to fall below<br />
the basic standard of education in all the rest.<br />
It is necessary for a C-' ommonwealth Government to come in<br />
and see that a child in any part of this nation of ours is enabled to be<br />
provided with the facilities that the children in other parts of the nation have.<br />
This is why there has been so much more involvement in education by<br />
the Commonwealth than has ever occurred before. This is why in the last<br />
three or four years the expenditure has increased three and a half times.<br />
This is why, more importantly, in the last three and a half years or so, there<br />
has been more advice given, more leadership given.<br />
Let us try and get a little bit more agreement as to the<br />
curricula between the various States. Let us try and get a little more<br />
not uniformity, because that is not what is wanted a little more equality<br />
of standards between the various States. Let us try and get to a situation<br />
where a child educated in one State and his parents move to another....<br />
can go to a university in that new State without having to meet special<br />
matriculation requirements. This ultimately must be good for a nation.<br />
I think there are only a-few things more, Mr Presiding<br />
Chairman, I want to say. You will all know that the Commonwealth<br />
Government for long has been interested in the provision of scientific<br />
laboratories and science facilities in schools governmental and independentthroughout<br />
Australia. Indeed, if you haven't received it, you are going to get<br />
another offer of 000 very shortly for your science laboratcry's equipment.<br />
We have heard tonight from a professor of physics, of the technological<br />
requirements of a modern age, and these we can not undervalue, because<br />
if our mterial standard of 1ivigi tpo increase if our capacity to increase the<br />
material standarI of our neigriMus is to incredse, then we must use to the<br />
utmost wivit is discovered by scionce and modern technology.<br />
But I hope that none of us will ever believe that scientific<br />
knowledge and technological knowledge can take the place of proper education,<br />
because with a full and complete knowledge of science, two things are<br />
possible. You can split an atom so that you can diagnose a disease and cure<br />
it where previously it could not bce-diagnosed and cured; or you can split it<br />
so that you can examine the material to be used in building to knaow whether<br />
if it is used that building will stand up under any stress; or you can split it<br />
so that from the isotopes you can discover how better to devel~ op the products<br />
of your land and the products of your industry; or you can split it so that<br />
you can devastate vast areas of land and destroy innumerable populations.<br />
Science offers both those alternatives, 4 * 1 </p>
<p>Similarly with technology. You can use it so that you<br />
can the better produce, so that you can with a smaller number of people<br />
and gre-ter machinery, turn out more and more, or you can use it so that<br />
you put your efforts into creating engines df destruction.<br />
Now what is going to decide whether scientific knowledge<br />
is used for the good or the bad? What is go ing to decide whether technological<br />
advances are used to improve the lot of n'll of us and of our neighbours, or<br />
to hold fears ov.-r the head of us an d of our neighbours? Is true education<br />
the study of history because that shows us the problems which men have<br />
had to face throughout the ages in tryiag to organise a society, and how in<br />
one way or another, with this degree of success or that, they have managed<br />
to overcome those problems, and how something which at first seems a<br />
panacea has been tried and has not been successful. Or is true education<br />
a study of religion, because that breaks the shackles of the present and<br />
makes us look to the ultimate goal we all seek, and that has particular<br />
application to a church school. A study of literature, perhaps, because that<br />
shows the dreams and aspirations of the individuals who make up a nation,<br />
half expressed or fully expressed, according to the capacity of the literary<br />
figure one studies And the study of politics, which shows the duty owed<br />
by a citizen to the community in which he lives, the duty not only to receive<br />
from it, but to give to it. These are the aims of true education,<br />
Fully understood, these will see that scientific and<br />
technical knowledge is used for the furtherance of those aims and not for<br />
the destruction which they make possible. Could anything be more impcr tant<br />
than seeking to see that the forces which are now unleashed through science<br />
and technology are through true education properly used? Can there be<br />
any better way of seeing that this true education is provided to one's children<br />
than by giving to schools throughout Australia the capacity to see that in<br />
this way we become a great nation. This, I think, is what this dinner is all<br />
about because here, in a small way, in one school, we can a little advance<br />
the aims I believe we all have for the nation of Australia. </p>
