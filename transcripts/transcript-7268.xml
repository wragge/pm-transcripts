FOR MEDIA 24 DECEMBER 1987<br />
Christmas is traditionally a time of peace and a time of hope.<br />
As Australians look back over 1987, I believe we have strong<br />
grounds for optimism for the future for both our country and,<br />
indeed, the world.<br />
Earlier this month we applauded asj the superpowers took an<br />
historic step towards disarmament. We all trust this is only a<br />
first step into a new era of peace and hope for every man, woman<br />
and child on the planet a first : step towards a saner, safer<br />
world. For Australia 1987 was a year of consolidation and achievement.<br />
For its part, my Government stuck steadfastly to its task and the<br />
Australian people responded. We made difficult decisions in<br />
difficult times but they were all made in pursuit of the goal<br />
of building a fairer and more productive Australia.<br />
And while we still live in times of uncertainty, I believe all<br />
Australians can nevertheless plan ahead with confidence in the<br />
future. 1988 will be a particularly si. gnificant year for Australia, not<br />
least because we will be celebrating our 200th birthday. Let us<br />
seek to ensure it will be rewarding and prosperous for all<br />
Australians. Hazel and I wish you all a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year<br />
and great happiness throughout 1988. 003710 </p>
