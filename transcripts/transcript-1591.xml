EXTRACT FROM ' PEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER,<br />
MR. HAROLD HOLT TO THE LOS ANGELES WTORLD<br />
AFFAIRS COUNCIL 31ST MAY, 1967<br />
Bombing of North Viet Nam<br />
The American and Australian positions are the same. In February, 1966<br />
1 stated ( soon after the end of the thirty-seven day bombing pause)<br />
" It has consistently been the view of the Australian Government<br />
that North Vietnam must not be permitted to remain a haven<br />
immune from military risk, from which military aggresssion<br />
against the south can be mounted with impunity.<br />
The case for controlled bombing is strong, and it has been conducted<br />
with great care and precision. Reasons are<br />
* It upsets the flow of men and materials to the fighting zones and<br />
damages the transport systems through which that flow goes forward.<br />
* It helps destroy the enemy's base areas, thereby weakening his<br />
capacity to fight and so saving the lives of allied fighting men.<br />
* It ties up hundreds of thousands of North Vietnamese workforce<br />
in repair and reconstruction.<br />
* It demonstrates to the fighting forces of South Vietnam that<br />
America and her allies are giving them full support.<br />
* It demonstrates to the people of South Vietnam as a whole that<br />
we do not expect them to suffer and fight the aggressor only<br />
where he chooses to fight.<br />
* It has the political and psychological effect of reminding the<br />
North Vietnamese that they cannot hope to win the war.<br />
There are critics of these operations in your country and in mine.<br />
Bombing is regarded as a horrible act of war that, in the name of humanity,<br />
should be avoided at all costs. It is said to be militarily unnecessary and<br />
without advantage. It is said that it is politically foolish, serving only to<br />
strengthen determination in the North to continue the conflict and at the same<br />
time making it difficult for the North to enter into negotiations for a peaceful<br />
settlement. Sicce~ it is said, the North Vietnamese Government will not<br />
negotiate under duress, it is feared that bombing might lead to the war spreading,<br />
For example by provoking China, the neighbour and supporter of North Vietnam.<br />
The United States Government has not accepted these arguments, nor<br />
has the Australian Government. We have supported the bombing operations.<br />
This is not to iay that we ignore the humanitarian aspects and are blind<br />
to the political implications. But those involved in the stern endeavour to stop<br />
Communist aggression from the North against the Republic of Vietnam, must<br />
face the realities of the situation. In a violent conflict of this nature, when 2/ </p>
<p>2.<br />
force has to be resisted by force, these realities are harsh. The Communists<br />
from the North have, for many years, sought to overthrow the Government of<br />
the Republic of Vietnam by defeating its armies and by destroying all prospect<br />
of orderly, constructive government.<br />
You know their record of brutal terrorism among the village population<br />
and of the endless guerilla attack. Not a day passes in which the Communists<br />
do not bomb villages and towns in Couth Vietnam by mortar attack. These<br />
mortars all come from the North. They have also organised in an increasing<br />
degree conventional, full-scale military operations. All these things could<br />
never have continued if supplies of equipment, arms and munitions and<br />
reinforcements of trained men had not continually come from tne North. It<br />
is the Communist Government in Hanoi, in the North, that is directing and<br />
organising this unrelenting attack in the South.<br />
It is the Communist Government in the North receiving supplies from'<br />
Communist Russia and Communist China that is giving the support of this<br />
material to Communist-led forces in the South.<br />
In our view, in Australia, if this aggression is to be stopped, the source<br />
of it cannot be immune from attack. We are dealing with a military situation.<br />
Major military measures are being taken against those resisting this aggression<br />
that can only be combatted by military measures. Is the opponent to be allowed<br />
to organise and despatch his manpower and supplies unmolested. Are these<br />
only to be dealt with when they finally arrive in the battlefields of the South,<br />
intact and in good trim? This does not make sense. It can only prolong the<br />
conflict. It exposes the soldiers in the allied armies, among them your men, who<br />
are making the major contribution, to greater dangers. In the Australian view,<br />
attacks in the North on the camps and depots of the aggressor, on his armmaking<br />
capacity, on his roads and bridges, his railways and sea lanes cannot<br />
be avoided if the aggressor's capacity in the South is to be reduced and the<br />
conflict is to be brought to an end. To refrain fromthese measures is to aid<br />
the aggressor in his attacks and to encourage him in the hope of victory.<br />
Of course such a policy involves risks. It involves risks of escalation,<br />
of involving the innocent civilian population, of narrowing the prospect of<br />
peaceful settlement. But how much greater would these risks be if the necessary<br />
military measures were taken in some other way than by bombing from the air.<br />
It is not our view that a wholesale military attack should be launched against<br />
the North, engulfing the entire country in the full horror of war. Surely<br />
controlled bombing, limited to military targets, is the best way of sparing'<br />
the population and avoiding wider risks.<br />
We believe that the effective use of United States power must profoundly<br />
affect the attitude of the rulers in North Vietnam. They must come to see that<br />
they can have no prospect of success. We also believe that the restraint<br />
exercised by the United States in the use of its massive power, while fulfilling<br />
necessary military requirements, would have a beneficial influence in China for<br />
the cause of peaceful co-existence. China is not threatened. Nor is China's<br />
neighbour, North Vietnam. But week by week the cost and futility of aggression<br />
are clearly demonstrated.<br />
Suspension of Bombing<br />
It is in the context of these considerations that we must judge the question<br />
of suspending the bombing, a demand repeatedly raised especially among those<br />
who overlook the basic military aspects of the situation. It would be foolish to </p>
<p>4 3.<br />
say that bombing should never be relaxed or suspended. Military<br />
requirements alone will fromn time to time make a different tempo and<br />
scale of operations desirable. -/ hat wve do know beyond argument is that<br />
whenever there has been a suspension of military activity the other side<br />
has taken full advantage of this to build up supplies of men and material<br />
as rapidly as possible. But the political aspect can never be neglected.<br />
Should the Communists be prepared in good faith to enter into negotiations,<br />
there is a substantial case for suspension of bombing. In this case, the<br />
Communists themselves must be assumed to be demonstrating their good<br />
faith by a suspension, or at least a major relaxation of their own attacks.<br />
But there are no signs that the Communists are interested in negotiation,<br />
and in these circumstances military operations, including bombing, must<br />
continue. lii ® ® 4ilie* </p>
