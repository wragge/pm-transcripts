PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR PRESS 26 JANUARY 1978<br />
ADlDRESS. AT AUSTR~ ALIA DAY. LUNCHJEON, 14ELBOURNt<br />
My Lord Mayor, I am delighted to have had this opportunity to<br />
join with you at this luncheon to celebrate our national<br />
day. Australians do not as a rule talk much about their feelings<br />
towards their country. It is not part of our normal character<br />
to display ardent public patriotism, eyxcept perhaps upon returning<br />
from overseas when many Australians declare their conviction<br />
that, after all they have ' sedyi, Australia Is the best country on<br />
earth.<br />
More public fervour by far is displayed at the V. P. L. Graoid Final<br />
than at all Australia Day celebrations combined, But underlying<br />
all this, there is a great strong curren't of pride in our country,<br />
and a belief in the future destiny of Australia.<br />
Australia Day is an appropriate occasion for Australians to take<br />
a f ew minutes to think about what it means to be an Australian<br />
what makes us distinctive as a nation. Like any other group of<br />
people, we are . a product of the experiences we have had together,<br />
and the experiences and the cultures and traaitions so mnany<br />
Australians have brought with themn to us from other countries.<br />
We have enjoyed good times. We have helped one another, and<br />
other people, in some exceedingly tough times wars, depression,<br />
bushfires, floods. Through it all,' our country has steadily<br />
grown and developed, until we have now created a whole complex<br />
civilisation on this continent. Much has been achieved. Much<br />
remains to be dlone.<br />
B3y thinking inore clearly about Australia and what it means to<br />
each of us, we can f ind ways to -make this country an even<br />
better place to live in than it already is. lie can preserve<br />
our freedom and protect our people from injustice. And we can<br />
and must take care of those among us who need our help, and<br />
give it to them as a right and not a privilege, so that they<br />
retain their dignity and self-respect.<br />
if Australia is to become the great country we all believe it<br />
can be if we are to translate the present into a better fCuture<br />
for all Australians what obligations are on us? What do we<br />
need to do? / The first </p>
<p>The first thing we can all do As to strive harder to achieve<br />
our personal goals. The philosophy of " near enough is good<br />
enoughi" of the half-hearted slapdash effort just is not<br />
gooft enoughb any more. It does not matter what field of activity<br />
we are an.<br />
In the arts,-If we are to have ballet of world-wide distinction<br />
and excellence if we are to give birth to authors whose works<br />
will be read in 1,000 years in sport, if we are to beat the<br />
nnqlish at cricket all of this takes a rmaximnum. effort by<br />
individuals, the company, the team. So far as Axistralia is<br />
concerned, we are all part of the team, every one of us.<br />
We must all put in our best effort, riot just for o-ursel-ves,<br />
bu~ t for Australia.<br />
The next thing we can do As to show -more oare for each other<br />
greater tolerance of others, a greater respect for others,<br />
greater concern for the disadvantaged and underprivileged.<br />
It is too easy to take the selfish attituade that the plight<br />
of those less fortunate than ourselves is the Gover-nient's<br />
problem. If we can su) pport each other -more, we shall all be<br />
the stronger f or itt for' we ' shall be ' a -more ' humane, a mnore<br />
liberal society.<br />
Next, we must be prepared to initiate and adapt to necessary<br />
reforms, and be propared to protcct. and prosearve that which is<br />
best in our society. We need to strike a careful balance<br />
bctween smoothing the way for change which advances ouor goals,<br />
, andi providing the stability which wiill let ouor society prosper<br />
a nd fl1. ourish._<br />
There is a final rcg-uircient. Over a range of issues and basic<br />
values, there is In Australia a strong degree of consensus.<br />
This broad agreement is of te~ i obscured by the heat of political<br />
debate by the division of opinion on the political issue of<br />
the noment.<br />
But Australians are not divided on the sort of country we want.<br />
The great majority of Australians want to see Australia thrive<br />
and develop. Want to see our youong people have the opportunity<br />
to make their contribution to the nation's future. Want to see<br />
that no Australians go without basic necessities throuigh no<br />
fault of their own. Want to see the rights and liberties of<br />
individual Australians protected and enhanced,<br />
What we must all do and political leaders have a parti-cullar<br />
responsibility in this is to support and reinforce these<br />
common values and ideals. The media too has a responsibility<br />
in this. ' They have a duty to criticise and expose, but they<br />
have a like duty to emphasise those things of value in society<br />
those things which act as a -unifying force . inour community.<br />
Let us all concentrate for-a change on those things which<br />
unite us, not seek to emphasise those that divide us. / it As </p>
<p>3<br />
It is not for nothing that Australians are known as knockers.<br />
Sometimes that may be a virtue, but it can be taken too far,<br />
as it is when its proponents live by that philosophy alone.<br />
There is more to life, more to Australia, than that.<br />
The opportunities within our grasp are great. The<br />
possibilities for Australia endless. On Australia Day 1978<br />
it is fitting to reflect for a few moments on what has given<br />
us a sense of national unity, and what it is that each of us<br />
can do to build on that unity. This is a role for Government<br />
and for every Australian, for Australia is no more than the<br />
sum of all its people; nothing but the actions o≈ì all<br />
Australians. If we as individuals act with a sense of responsibility,<br />
Australia will be made a better place. in 1978, we should<br />
all think of what we can do for Australia. </p>
