    <content><![CDATA[<p>STEFANOVIC:</p>
<p>Good morning to you Prime Minister.</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> Good morning Karl. Isn't it a wonderful morning? King Harry. King Harry.</p>
<p>STEFANOVIC:</p>
<p>How was it for you?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> Oh, it was a terrific fight back and we got off to such a terrible start because the Croatians were really in our face right at the beginning and to score that goal within, what, two and half minutes and then that almost dribble in, in the second half that put them ahead in the 58th minute or whatever it was, it was a fantastic fight back. And Harry, well he is King Harry for all of us now, and it was a fantastic performance.</p>
<p> This team, according to the assessment of independent people and the London Times sports correspondent says it's the highest performing team relative to our ranking when the World Cup started. So that is a fantastic performance and all Australia is very proud of Mark and the boys. I spoke to Frank Lowy and John O'Neill straight after the result, the boys were still on the field, but gee they've done us proud and the whole country feels good and warm about it and so we should.</p>
<p> STEFANOVIC:</p>
<p>Like the rest of us, were you a little bit nervous about the outcome?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> Oh very nervous. But this is a very tenacious team. And they've got a wonderful coach. Guus is obviously a very good coach. He's very tenacious, very calculating and there's a lot of natural ability and it's obvious that the team spirit is very strong. I think they will continue to surprise a lot of people.</p>
<p> STEFANOVIC:</p>
<p>Now Prime Minister, I would like you to listen to something that happened a little built earlier on our show with Paul Wade, our expert soccer commentator. If you wouldn't mind just listening in for a short while, we'll play you this grab.</p>
<p>(Honestly, if any boss sacks somebody after this, they should be sacked. Have a great night or morning. See ya.)</p>
<p>Prime Minister, you got the message there?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> You know, what ought to be said is the employers as well as the employees got up early to watch this. I mean this is what's so great about this event, it has united the whole country, so I don't think the question of people dragging their feet in to work later today is going to be an issue.</p>
<p> STEFANOVIC:</p>
<p>Oh come on Prime Minister. You can say it?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> No. You get my drift, mate.</p>
<p> STEFANOVIC:</p>
<p>In terms of sporting moments, is it right up there with Australia Two do you think?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> Oh, a lot of sporting moments, it is a great sporting moment. I mean we've had tremendous sporting moments in all codes. But what is great about this is that for so long we had in Australia hundreds of thousands of young boys, and increasingly girls now, playing soccer, but somehow or other we couldn't break through into the international scene and that's been transformed. And I play a lot of credit to Frank Lowy and John O'Neill, they're a great combination, John with his sporting background through rugby union, and Frank, his great love of soccer and his business acumen, they've been a terrific combination and of course we've got a wonderful team.</p>
<p> And the fact that so many of them play in great teams in Europe means that they are constantly playing in a highly competitive environment and it's going to give a whole new emphasis. But it's just a reminder too, that these days Australians are not so narrow in their sporting tastes. I'm sure die hard Australian rules and rugby league fans were cheering just as wildly and were just as tense and excited as die hard soccer fans, and that is what's so tremendously unifying about an event like this.</p>
<p>STEFANOVIC:</p>
<p>Prime Minister I do want to touch on a couple of other issues but before I do that, can you talk us through the '74 track suit. A very interesting development there out of your wardrobe. Did it have a bit of dust on it?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> No, I was told by my, I think the top bit is actually, I think, the players top of the current team. You think it looks a bit ancient do you?</p>
<p>STEFANOVIC:</p>
<p>No, the retro look, everything old is new again Prime Minister.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, that's encouraging.</p>
<p>STEFANOVIC:</p>
<p> Alright, we'll just leave the Socceroos aside just for a second. A couple of important issues that are going around this morning. Have you apologised to the Iraqi Government for yesterday's accidental shooting?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, I haven't because I haven't got a report on what happened. And until I get that report, I'm not going to be using language which ascribes blame. I don't know what occurred. I know that Australian soldiers always behave in a very professional manner and my operating assumption until I have been told otherwise is that Australian soldiers always do the right thing.</p>
<p> Now that doesn't mean to say I don't sincerely regret the death of that man and the injury to the others, but as to the cause of it and who didn't observe the rules of the road in relation to the incident, I don't know that yet and therefore I'm not going to get into the business of formal apologies. I just really want to know what happened.</p>
<p> But I am very sorry that a man lost his life. That is tragic, it's sad. The death of anybody in Iraq is a matter of sadness and concern. But until I know what's happened, it's not appropriate to be flinging out apologies because we do not know the full story and I think it is very important in these incidents to find out the facts before people in my position start saying what happened.</p>
<p> STEFANOVIC:</p>
<p> Do you think it's going jeopardise our trade? There is some talk that the Iraqi Government is quite upset and livid over this issue. Do you think it will effect, for example, our wheat trade?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, I don't. And I can tell you that a short while ago, last night, a few hours ago, the Iraqi Trade Minister saw the Australian Ambassador and the Iraqi Trade Minister told our Ambassador that he greatly appreciated the letter which Mark Vaile had sent to him, and that he did not want this incident to interfere with the bilateral relationship, or to effect our trade relationship. So that is the Iraqi Trade Minister a few hours ago to the Australian Ambassador in Baghdad. So let's take a breath. It's a sad incident, but let's not overreact and most importantly, let's not give a commentary on what happened until we know what happened.</p>
<p> STEFANOVIC:</p>
<p> Alright. One final serious issue, East Timor. Xanana Gusmao is threatening to resign today if the Prime Minister doesn't. What effect, I know you won't comment on internal politics in East Timor, I understand that, but what effect do you think that will have on the streets of East Timor in terms of security?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> Gusmao has a lot of support in East Timor, he's a very popular figure. How he resolves his differences with Dr Alkatiri is a matter for the processes of Iraqi, of East Timorese democracy. But Gusmao has been a galvanising leadership figure in the affairs of that country for a very long time and I find it very hard to believe that he won't remain at the centre of political events and I find it hard to believe that the great majority of East Timorese won't want him to remain at the centre of events.</p>
<p> STEFANOVIC:</p>
<p> Okay one final question. Two great Australians get married this weekend, Nicole and Keith. Sending your best wishes, perhaps a track suit PM?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> I think the wardrobe of both of them is very extensive.</p>
<p> STEFANOVIC:</p>
<p> Alright Prime Minister.</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> I wish them very well, I hope that they have a happy life together. A wedding is always a happy occasion.</p>
<p> STEFANOVIC:</p>
<p> Thank you very much Prime Minister, appreciate your time this morning on a good day for Australia.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>[ends] </p>
