PRIME MINISTER<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING, MP<br />
RECEPTION FOR DIRECTORS OF COOPERATIVE RESEARCH CENTRES<br />
PARLIAMENT HOUSE, 19 APRIL 1994<br />
This exhibition, which is being mounted in conjunction with the 1994 QRC<br />
Directors' meeting, gives me the opportunity to underline my continuing<br />
support and that of the government for the work of the scientific community,<br />
and in particular for the Cooperative Research Centres program.<br />
Over the past few months, the government has been considering the central<br />
role industry policy must play in shaping our future as a nation.<br />
A vital thread in this is the importance of innovation, which will provide the<br />
only sustainable growth available. Innovation in technology, science and<br />
engineering are central to this process.<br />
Australia comes out well in any international comparison on government<br />
investment in science. Past investment has provided a rich human and<br />
institutional resource base for us to build on.<br />
The creation of my Science and Engineering Council indicates my own<br />
commitment to the development of Australia's science and technology. A<br />
further indication has been my recent decision to include science and<br />
technology in Peter C ook~' s Cabinet portfolio.<br />
The main problem we face is under investment in R&amp; D by the private sector.<br />
Although we have in the past d-ecadehh ad the highest di owth rate -int he<br />
OECD in business funding of R&amp; D, there is still a way to go to match our<br />
main competitors. Government programs for science and innovation, such as<br />
tax concessions for R&amp; D, are supporting the move by the business<br />
community to meet this challenge.<br />
But we must remember that our competitors do not stand still. Our innovation<br />
support programs will continue to be monitored and fine-tuned to maintain<br />
their effectiveness. Most recently, we have been giving increased attention </p>
<p>to the ways in which we can encourage innovation in small to medium sized<br />
enterprises. But there is no reason for large companies to rest on their<br />
laurels. We must also capitalise on the very considerable investment and expertise<br />
that lies within our public sector research institutes by linking them -more<br />
closely with those of industry and attuning them to the market place.<br />
The Cooperative Research Centres program is an important part of our plans<br />
to improve the commercial isation of research results.<br />
The government is expecting that the Australian Technology Group<br />
established late last year will also enable us to make significant steps forward<br />
in this area. I know that the CRCs will be looking to forge strong links with<br />
the ATP and will take advantage of its areas of specialist expertise.<br />
We need to consider whether we are making best use of all the resources<br />
available in our research labs. Women with science skills are a particularly<br />
underused resource. If we cannot involve women in the national pursuit of<br />
innovation and competitiveness, we are not managing our human resources<br />
efficiently. There is room for improvement in both public and private sectors.<br />
As directors of CRCs, those present today may be in a unique position to<br />
develop and promote science skill development, irrespective of history and<br />
gender. I hope you can also promote an increased role for women in industry<br />
research, which has been very much a male preserve.<br />
The pioneering CRCs are now in their third year. Tonight's exhibition gives<br />
just a glimpse of some of the many achievements which they are beginning to<br />
record in fields as diverse as aerospace structures, photonics, and tropical<br />
plant pathology. These achievements have also been demonstrated in the<br />
presentations made by CRCs to my Science and Engineering Council.<br />
As I have stressed, innovation is essential to Australia's future. So the<br />
linkages being developed by the CRC program between public and private<br />
sector research are essential. CRCs have introduced a new kind of multicultural<br />
approach to research, linking industry, academia and the public<br />
sector. CRC participants include business enterprises, universities, and government<br />
agencies including the OSIRO. These participants have agreed to contribute<br />
more than $ 1 ,500 million over the expected life of the existing 51 centres.<br />
This amount includes nearly $ 350 million from business enterprises. Their<br />
total contributions are equivalent to approximately $ 2 for every $ 1 of<br />
Commonwealth funds. Over 200 companies are associated with CRCs in<br />
various ways, many of them as formal participants. The success of the<br />
program depends on the participation of both institutional participants and<br />
individual participants, particularly those who serve as Chairs of CRC boards<br />
or board members. </p>
<p>The next two years will see the CRCs progressing further down the track from<br />
bright ideas to products and services which can generate new industries and<br />
reinvigorate old ones. As the third and fourth round centres come to full<br />
operation, and the program reaches maturity, we shall see more and more<br />
evidence of the economic benefits it will bring to Australia. The CRCs will<br />
help to build Australia's reputation as a nation with leading edge research<br />
capabilities that underpin a dynamic world class economy.<br />
As Australia pursues full and successful membership of the global community<br />
we need improvement and maintenance of our innovative capacity. We need<br />
stronger alliances between business and the public sector, to exploit more<br />
effectively our investments in people, processes and production.<br />
Knowledge, expertise, creativity and technology these are our passports to<br />
a healthy and prosperous future. For the part which the scientific community<br />
in general, and the CRCs in particular, are playing in pursuing these goals, I<br />
should like to convey the thanks of the nation, and the firm commitment of the<br />
government. </p>
