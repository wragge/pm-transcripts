    <content><![CDATA[<p>With the completion of the work of the BHP Welfare Trust, I take this opportunity to congratulate BHP Billiton for its efforts to assist and support those affected by the closure of its Newcastle steelworks.</p>
<p>The $1.5 million Trust has helped former employees and contractors by funding a jobs summit, emergency relief, mentoring, employment assistance and training, chaplaincy services and business development.</p>
<p>  The Trust has also complemented the activities of the $10 million Newcastle Structural Adjustment Fund, established by the Australian Government to facilitate employment growth in the Hunter region.</p>
<p>Together these initiatives led to the creation of over 1,000 new jobs from 19 projects, and helped create a more diversified employment base in the area.</p>
<p>I would also take this opportunity to thank the members of the Prime Ministerial Taskforce, jointly chaired by Rob Chenery and Kevin Maher, for their work over the past four years in assisting with the administration of the Fund.</p>
<p>BHP';s commitment to its former workers, their families and the broader Hunter community provides a valuable example of how business, governments and the community can work together to improve social outcomes.</p>
