PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 7 MAY 1990<br />
When the Ministry was appointed on 4 April 1990, I<br />
advised relevant Ministers to settle the various<br />
responsibilities within their portfolios.<br />
Portfolio Ministers have now advised me concerning the<br />
allocation of responsibilities. A schedule showing the<br />
responsibilities of non-portfolio Ministers is attached.<br />
In order to reflect accurately the responsibilities now<br />
allocated to them, the titles of three non-portfolio<br />
Ministers have been changed. The Governor-General<br />
appointed the three Ministers this morning to their<br />
renamed ministerial offices.<br />
The Ministers concerned and their new titles are as<br />
follows: Mr Baldwin has been appointed Minister for Higher<br />
Education and Employment Services;<br />
Senator Collins has been appointed Minister for<br />
Shipping and Aviation Support;<br />
