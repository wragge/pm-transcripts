COMMENTS ON BUSHFIRES IN LOCAL AREA 3 March 1985<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
JOURNALIST: effected by the bushfires yesterday.<br />
Yes, I extend on behalf of the Governent my sincere<br />
sympathy to them, particularly of course to the families of the<br />
two dead men. And I trust that with the change in weather<br />
circumstances that have now appeared today that these tragic<br />
fires will be able to be brought under control. And we of course<br />
stand ready, as we do in these circumstances, to provide the<br />
appropriate and necessary assistance according to the normal<br />
facilities that are provided in these circumstances. I hope<br />
that now as we are coming to the end of what has been a hot,<br />
dry summer around here the people will be able settle down to a<br />
normal life again without the terrible apprehension that must have<br />
been there for very many weeks now with this very, very dry, hot<br />
summer. I just noticed when I was going out to the airport the<br />
day before yesterday just how very, very dry it was and I said to<br />
my driver it looked a bit dangerous. Unfortunately, we got those<br />
terrible winds yesterday and it was a cauldron(?). </p>
