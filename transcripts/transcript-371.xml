    <content><![CDATA[<p><strong>P. M. No. 49/1961</strong></p>
<p>I have seen reports of an incident in TownsvilleÂ where a hotel-keeper refused to serve liquor to a visitingÂ Education Officer from Kenya. Quite clearly the lawsÂ governing the sale of liquor in Townsville are a matter forÂ the Queensland State authorities and the CommonwealthÂ Government has no jurisdiction in that matter. I have beenÂ reliably informed that in fact a hotel-keeper is not obliged,Â under the Queensland liquor licensing laws, to sell liquorÂ to any individual person if he chooses not to do so.</p>
<p>Having said that, however, I would like to make itÂ quite clear that I greatly regret this incident. I deploreÂ any discourtesy to any visitor to this country from overseas,Â whatever the colour of his skin and whatever country heÂ comes L. rom. I am sure that most Australians will share myÂ feeling on this. I am particularly sorry, however,Â that theÂ incident reported has occurred to a responsible governmentÂ officer of another Commonwealth country who is here to studyÂ the way in which Australians are educated.Â </p>
<p>CANBERRA,<br />22nd September, 1961.</p>
<p>NOTE: Newspapers carried reports on 19th September of aÂ Townsville hotel-keeper's refusal to serve liquor to aÂ Kenya Education Officer, Mr. Gerald Kalya, who is atÂ present on a study course in Australia.</p>
