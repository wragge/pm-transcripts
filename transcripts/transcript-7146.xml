PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 1 APRIL 1987<br />
NO EARLY ELECTION<br />
I have sta~ ted consistently that I prefer the Parliament to<br />
run its full term.<br />
The leadership vacuum and chaos within and between the<br />
opposition Parties, together with their imminent rejection<br />
of the Aucitralia Card legislation for a second time, have'<br />
presented the option and may I say frankly, the temptation,<br />
of an early election.<br />
I am confident that Labor would wenan early election. I<br />
have decided, however, that the election will be held<br />
towards the end of this year or early next year.<br />
The Australian people want continued strong leadership and a<br />
Government that will continue to guide them through<br />
difficult economic times into renewed prosperity. To have<br />
an early election may have brought into question the<br />
Government~ s resolve to make the tough decisions needed to<br />
meet the economic challenge facing this country.<br />
Let me repeat the dimension of this challenge. Through<br />
paying drastically lower prices for many of our exports the<br />
world has cut more than $ 6 billion off the nation's income;<br />
that is, we are poorer to the tune of $ 1500 per Australian<br />
family. As a nation we have no responsible alternative to<br />
adjusting to that reality.<br />
I want to tell the Australian people that we will not shirk<br />
our responsibilities in making the unpalatable, though<br />
necessary aconomic decisions: the may Statement will be<br />
tough but Zair.<br />
The Australian people overwhelmingly reject the deceptive<br />
voodoo economics being espoused by the opposition Partiesbigger<br />
handouts, bigger deficits; that is, a certain recipe<br />
for highcr interest rates, higher inflation, massive<br />
increases in unemnploym'ent total economic disaster.<br />
When the opposition Parties reject the Australia Card<br />
legislation in the Senate later this week, they will stand<br />
condemned by the Australian people for denying to the nation<br />
this fundamental instrument for dealing decisively with tax<br />
cheats and welfare frauds. This denial of more than $ 800m a<br />
year to the public purse from those who should be paying is<br />
simply a continuiation of the traditional<br />
Howard/ Sirclair/ Bjelke Petersen philosophy protect the<br />
privilegedc and increase the burden on the great honest<br />
majority of the Australian people. </p>
