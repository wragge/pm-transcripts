    <content><![CDATA[<p>I intend to recommend to the Governor‑General, His Excellency General the Honourable Sir Peter Cosgrove AK MC (Retd), that he appoint Mr Grant Hehir as the next Auditor‑General for the Commonwealth for 10 years, commencing on 11 June 2015.</p>
<p>As an independent officer of the Parliament, the Auditor‑General is responsible for ensuring accountability and transparency in the delivery of government programmes and services.</p>
<p>Mr Hehir is currently the New South Wales Auditor‑General, and has held a range of positions in state and Commonwealth public sectors.</p>
<p>He was the Secretary of the Victorian Department of Treasury and Finance for seven years, and held senior positions in the Commonwealth Department of Finance and The Treasury.</p>
<p>Mr Hehir is also a Fellow of CPA Australia and the Institute of Public Administration Australia.</p>
<p>The appointment of Mr Hehir would follow the conclusion of the term of Mr Ian McPhee AO PSM, who has served as Auditor‑General for the past 10 years and made a significant contribution to public sector accountability. On behalf of the Government, I thank Mr McPhee for his contribution to public administration.</p>
