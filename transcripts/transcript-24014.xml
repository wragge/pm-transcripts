    <content><![CDATA[<p>I congratulate Dan Andrews on his victory in yesterday’s Victorian election.</p>
<p>Whilst a significant proportion of the vote remains to be counted, it is clear that Victorians have voted for a change of government.</p>
<p>The Commonwealth Government will work with the incoming government in the interests of all Victorians.</p>
<p>I pay tribute to Denis Napthine.</p>
<p>Denis is a man of integrity and decency. He has served Victoria as a member of parliament, as a minister in the Kennett Government, as leader of the opposition, as a minister in the Baillieu Government, and as Premier.</p>
<p>He restored the fiscal position of the state and embarked on a major infrastructure programme to get Victoria moving. I share his commitment to the East West Link and I am determined to do what I can to ensure this vital national infrastructure project proceeds to completion.</p>
<p>Denis Napthine’s public service has left Victoria a better place and I thank him.</p>
<p>30 November 2014</p>
