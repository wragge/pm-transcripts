PRESS BRIEFING GIVEN BY THE PRIME MINISTER,<br />
MR. HAROLD HOLT, FOR THE HEADS OF BUREA JN16<br />
IN THE PARLIAMENTARY PRESS GALLERY AT L1*<br />
PARLIAMENT HOUSE, CANBERRA LB'<br />
27TH JUNE, 1967<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I don't propose to detain you for long because I am hoping<br />
that later in the week I will have the chance to go over a number of<br />
matters on which no doubt you are feeling some interest. There are<br />
just two aspects I wanted to deal with tonight.<br />
The first is just to make some reference amplifying what I<br />
gather Tony will already have told you that today we have been engaged<br />
principally on a series of papers relating to the forthcoming Premiers'<br />
Conference and Loan Council meeting. But prior to that, the Minister<br />
for External Affairs had given us a review of Middle East developments,<br />
and I had indicated to Cabinet that as these other matters were of great urgency<br />
and had -to be disposed of today, I would defer my own account of what<br />
transpired whilst I was overseas until we had got this business out of the<br />
way. Tonight I am hoping to have an opportunity of doing this when we<br />
meet again after dinner.<br />
VWe also discussed the proposed hold-up, as we understand it,<br />
of postal business on Saturday, July 1. On that, the Acting Minister can<br />
be expected to make a statement later this evening.<br />
The particular matter I wanted to mention to you at this<br />
point because I felt in view of all the press discussion and speculation<br />
which had gone on it wasn't desirable that I leave this until our meeting<br />
later in the week is the prominence given in the press to the Basic<br />
Industries Group, its allegations of some association between this body<br />
and my own party, and what I have regarded as quite unfair criticism which<br />
I have read in some sections of the press relating to my colleague, the<br />
Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade. As to the Basic Industries<br />
Group, I confirm that when I returned from overseas, my own Deputy<br />
Leader, the Treasurer, in reporting to me on the various developments<br />
which had occurred on the domestic front whilst I was overseas, spoke in<br />
relation to this particular matter. He gave me his own assurance that<br />
neither he, nor so far as he could ascertain, any of our Liberal Party<br />
Ministerial colleagues had anything to do with the formation of this<br />
organisation or contact with it. For my own part, I have no contact with<br />
any member of it. I question whether I would know any member of it if<br />
he walked through the door, and I was able to convey this to the Deputy<br />
Prime Minister when we talked together about the matter. I may say we<br />
didn ' t talk about it until this morning. I did telephone him on Friday<br />
after my return, but we spoke then entirely on matters which had arisen<br />
while I was overseas, and my own activities the discussions in LQndon<br />
and my discussions both in Canada and with more relevance to him, the<br />
various trade and economic matters which I discussed in Washington and<br />
at Camp David. So far as the Basic Industries Group is concerned,<br />
therefore, it is open to any body of men or women in this democratic<br />
society of ours if they disagree with policies of the government or individual<br />
members of the Government to conduct their own political activities in<br />
relation to them. They are not necess arily by any means helpful to one side<br />
of politics or to one party in the coalition. The Deputy Prime Minister / 2 </p>
<p>FRIME MINISTER ( Contd.<br />
and I have had a long association now in the Parliament extending beyond<br />
thirty years. W. e have been collengues together in governments as fellow<br />
Ministers for upwards of twenty years, and we have managed to get along<br />
on good terms right through that period. Therefore the activities of any<br />
organisation which could be regarded as prejudicial to the harmonious<br />
working of the coalition is certainly not in the interests of myself or my<br />
Liberal colleagues in the coalition.<br />
But in particular, I wanted to refer to what I have described as<br />
unfair criticism of Mr. McEwen as Minister for Trade and Industry and<br />
of the Country Party directed to the tariff policy of the Government, its<br />
alleged effects on costs, particularly as they bear on export industries,<br />
and its general effects on the direction of the use of resources and the<br />
efficiency of industry.<br />
I want to make it very clear that criticism of tariff policy<br />
generally and of Mr. Mc~ weri's role in particular in formulating tariff<br />
policy is not criticism of himself or of the Country Party, but it is<br />
criticism of the Government as a whole. My colleague was asked by Sir<br />
Robert Menzies, my predecessor, in 1956 to take responsibility for the<br />
newly-created Department of Trade. His activities, amongst other tasks,<br />
embraced domestic and international tariff policies. Tariff policy is<br />
reviewed from time to time by the Government. Normally tariff matters<br />
come before the Gene-ral Administrative Committee of Cabinet, and on<br />
this Country Farty Ministers form a small minority, or, if the policy aspect<br />
is considered of sufficient consequence, they go to the Cabinet itself, in<br />
which, as you will know, there are nine Liberal Farty Ministers and three<br />
Country Party Ministers. So tariff policy is a Government responsibility.<br />
It is not the responsibility of any one Minister or of one party in the<br />
coalition. And I just mention a statistical fact, that the recorded value of<br />
Australian exports exceeded COC million for the first time in 1961/ 62,<br />
and we regarded that as a bumper year for exports, as I recall it, when I<br />
was then Treasurer. This coming financial year, five years later, it is<br />
confidently anticipated that exports will exceed 20, C million. This quite<br />
remarkable growth in export income is certainly not consistent with any<br />
charge that our policies have retarded our export industries in general.<br />
And I emphasise again the fact that they are our policies and not the policies<br />
of any particular member of the Government.<br />
I think that is all I wanted to say<br />
MR. EGGLETON Are there any specific questions? We haven't got much<br />
time.<br />
Q. Your discussion this morning, Sir, with Mr. McEwen. W-, as<br />
that outside the Cabinet or inside it?<br />
PM: This has not been discussed in C," abinet. I should have made<br />
that clear to you. / Ie had a talk together which was the first opportunity<br />
we had had, because he came from Mangalore yesterday, and I was<br />
committed to an engagement with the Governor -Gaieral last night, so we<br />
took this opportunity this morning of discussing these matters, and I felt / 3 </p>
<p>Sa -3-<br />
PM ( Contd) arising out of that rather than defer any comment on it until<br />
we met lter in the week, I should say what I had to say right<br />
now.<br />
Q. Sir, just one question before this ends, this<br />
particular episode......<br />
PM: Well, I think that's an optimistic view for any<br />
politician to take!<br />
Q. On the Middle East report, is there anything you<br />
can say about crystallising the views or anything like this<br />
that came out of it?<br />
PM: No, I've got nothing specific myself to say on it.<br />
I think if anything is to be said, Mr. Hasluck might choose to do<br />
so. But I said in London we were striking a rather muted note<br />
on this issue. </p>
