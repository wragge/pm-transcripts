JOINT STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING, MP<br />
AND THE MINISTER ASSISTING THE PRIME MINISTER AND THE MINISTER<br />
FOR SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY, THE HON ROSS FREE, MP<br />
THE SIXTH MEETING OF THE PRIME MINISTER'S SCIENCE COUNCIL<br />
The Prime Minister's Science Council met today for the sixth<br />
time. The Prime Minister, who chaired the Science Council for<br />
the first time, recognised it as an important peak body for<br />
considering science and technoloLgyssues of national<br />
significance. The Prime Minister announced the retirement of the Chief<br />
Scientist, Professor Ralph Slatyer AO FAA FRS, at the end of<br />
his three year term. This will become effective after the<br />
completion of the White Paper on Science and Technology in<br />
August this year. on behalf of-he Government, fiie-Prime<br />
Minister expressed appreciation for Professor Slatyer's role<br />
in the establishment of the science and technology policy and<br />
coordination mechanisms which were announced in the May 1989<br />
Science and Technology Statement.<br />
The Prime Minister also acknowledged Professor Slatyer's<br />
reputation as one of Australia's outstanding scientists. The<br />
importance of Professor Slatyer's standing in both the<br />
international and national scientific communities has been<br />
reflected in his provision of high quality and objective<br />
advice to Government. The Government wishes to continue to<br />
draw upon Professor Slatyer's expertise and has asked him to<br />
chair the Cooperative Research Centres Committee until the<br />
completion of the third round of the Program.<br />
The Prime Minister welcomed two new members to the Science<br />
Council Mr Mal Bryce, Chairman of the Western Australian<br />
Technology and Industry Advisory Council and Professor Michael<br />
airt, recently appointed Chairman of the Australian Science<br />
and Technology Council.<br />
The first major item considered by the Science Council was a<br />
presentation on the manufacturing technology industry in<br />
Australia given by Mr Jac Nasser, President of the Ford Motor<br />
Company in Australia, and Dr Peter Robinson, Chief of the<br />
CSIRO Division of Manufacturing Technology. The paper was<br />

2<br />
prepared by an independent working group consisting of senior<br />
people from industry, research organisations, higher education<br />
institutions and Government. It notes that if Australian<br />
manufacturing is to become internationally competitive, it<br />
needs to focus increasingly on value-adding on elaborately<br />
transformed manufacturers. it argues that to do this,<br />
industry must focus on product differentiation and will<br />
require appropriate highly skilled teams and a well<br />
coordinated national research and development and education<br />
and training infrastructure.<br />
The second major presentation focused on the information<br />
technology and telecommunications industry. This paper was<br />
also prepared by an independent working group, and was unusual<br />
in that it considered the information technology and<br />
telecommunications industries under one umbrella. The Report<br />
found that both industries formed the essential infrastructure<br />
of modern economies and were vital for increasing productivity<br />
across all industry sectors. The presenters were Mr Roger<br />
Allen, Science Council member and the Managing Director of<br />
Computer Power Group, Dr Greg Clark, Director of Science and<br />
Technology for IBM Australia and Mr Bill Page-Hanify, Managing<br />
Director of Alcatel Australia.<br />
Reports from both these working groups will be released today.<br />
The final major presentation examined the scientific aspects<br />
of major environmental topics. There were three presentations<br />
prepared and presented by Australian scientific experts in<br />
these fields. Dr Graeme Pearman, Assistant Chief of the CSIRO<br />
Division of Atmospheric Science spoke about the status of<br />
scientific knowledge on climate change, and Dr Brian Walker,<br />
Chief of the CSIRO Division of Wildlife and Ecology and Dr<br />
Peter Bridgewater, Executive officer for the Australian<br />
National Parks and Wildlife service, spoke about aspects of<br />
biodiversity. The Science Council discussions ended with consideration of<br />
issues relating to the White Paper on Science and Technology<br />
being developed and presented by Mr Free in his capacity as<br />
Minister for Science and Technology and Minister Assisting, in<br />
the context of the 1992-93 Budget.<br />
