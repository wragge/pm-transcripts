FOR MEDIA 12 JULY 1986<br />
JOINT STATEE-NT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, MR HAWKE, AND THE<br />
PRESIDENT 07? THE ARGENTINE REPUBLIC, DR ALFONSIN<br />
This first v sit to Australia by a Head of State from Latin<br />
America has provided the opportunity for very friendly and useful<br />
discussionG. Although our two countries are geographically<br />
distant we are both democracies with important common interests<br />
on major international issues and recognise the potential which<br />
exists for ethanced bilateral co-operation.<br />
we share deep concerns with recent developments in international<br />
agricultural. trade. Both our countries are efficient agricultural<br />
producers anm] exporters, but largely as a consequence of donostic<br />
agriculturai support policies in the major industrial powers we<br />
are seeing ccntinual erosion of and distortions in our<br />
agriculturt~ l export markets, highlighted by a sharp and<br />
protracted declne in prices for most of our agricultural<br />
products. There is a crucial need to liberalise international trade, to<br />
reduce agricultural export subsidies and to bring about reform of<br />
domestic agrJ, 6-ultural policies, particularly of the major<br />
industrial powers, which stimulate over production through<br />
subsidies and barriers to market access.<br />
we are in complete agreement on the urgency and importance of<br />
launching the new round of multilateral Trade Negotiations where<br />
the question of agricultural trade must be effectively addressed<br />
as a priority issue. we also recognise that countries dependent<br />
on agriculture for their livelihood cannot wait the outcome of<br />
these negotiations alone and that there is a need to develop<br />
strategies to be pursued jointly and individually to achieve<br />
agricultural trade reform. Our Ministers and officials will<br />
continue to co-ordinate our approaches to these issues. Argentina<br />
will participate in the Ministerial meeting of like-minded<br />
agricultural producers to be held in Cairns next month as part of<br />
this procesG.<br />
An open intornational trading system, which provides the<br />
opportunity to obtain reasonable and fair prices for exports is<br />
essential if international financial problems are to be overcome<br />
and domestic cconomic growth encouraged. This is, in turn, of<br />
great importance to reinforce the very welcome trend towards<br />
democracy which is taking place in Latin America, and of which<br />
Argentina has been a prime example. </p>
<p>2<br />
We agreed on the need to find a solution to the problems of the<br />
foreign debt of developing countries, especially those of Latin<br />
America, which would enable the strengthening of democratic<br />
systems by means of oconomic growth, and Australia noted the<br />
efforts made by the " Consensus of Cartagena" in that respect.<br />
We also had a wide Tanging discussion of international political<br />
issues. We believe thiat a solution to the problems of Central<br />
America should lie in international negotiation and<br />
democratisation ard fully endorse the Contadora process,<br />
including the work of the Contadora Support Group of which<br />
Argentina is a member. Argentina attaches great importance to the<br />
question of the Falkland Islands ( Malvinas). We are each of the<br />
view that this complex question should be solved peacefully<br />
through negotiation. On the tragic trend of events in South<br />
Africa we agreed that further and effective measures by the<br />
international community are essential, including on the part of<br />
South Africa's major economic partners, to bring home to the<br />
Government there the urgent need for fundamental change. We also<br />
reaffirmed the high priority we attach to disarmament issues.<br />
1oth countries have been increasingly active in this area, for<br />
example Argentina's participation in the Six Nations initiative<br />
and Australia's initiative on the South Pacific Nuclear Free<br />
Zone. We noted anO supported increasing regional co-operation in<br />
both the Asia/ Paclft: and Latin American areas. We agreed to<br />
continue close co.-o'aration on Antarctic issues.<br />
We discussed the potential for closer co-operation between<br />
southern region nations, and in that respect agreed that<br />
officials of the two countries would meet to explore the means of<br />
achieving this co-. oparation. We also talked about Argentina's<br />
participation in tha Australian Bicentennial and Australia's<br />
willingness to cont: ibute its expertise to the planned transfer<br />
of Argentina's capital city. We recognised the scope for enhanced<br />
commercial co-operation.<br />
Our discussions entablish a firm foundation for a closer<br />
relationship than has existed hitherto between Australia and<br />
Argentina, both bilaterally and on international questions of<br />
common concern. </p>
