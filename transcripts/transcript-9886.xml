STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
BOUGAINVILLE PEACE TALKS<br />
Leaders from all the major Bougainvillean factions will meet in Cairns today to<br />
discuss ways of resolving the six year old conflict on Bougainville. The PNG<br />
Government has endorsed the meeting and asked Australia to facilitate it.<br />
The Australian Government is providing a venue and the necessary security<br />
arrangements for this meeting. This will allow leaders to discuss freely the<br />
future of their island and propose ways of settling the conflict there which<br />
could then be taken up in discussions with the PNG Government.<br />
The Australian Government will not be a participant in the Cairns talks.<br />
The Australian Government strongly supports a settlement and stands ready<br />
to assist in restoring the economy on Bougainville, particularly the restoration<br />
of education and health services as soon as circumstances permit. I am<br />
pleased that the Commonwealth Secretariat has expressed its readiness to<br />
assist in the Cairns talks.<br />
But it is only Bougainvilleans themselves, in conjunction with the<br />
PNG Government, who can create a lasting solution to the conflict.<br />
The issues involved cannot be settled by force. The PNG Government has<br />
said that peace can be brought to Bougainville only through a political<br />
settlement. I have sent a message to the participants urging them to make the most of<br />
the opportunity which these talks provide to demonstrate that they are truly<br />
committed to peace on Bougainville and to examine new ways of resolving<br />
the conflict and restoring security and prosperity to the island.<br />
