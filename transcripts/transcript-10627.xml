    <content><![CDATA[<p>MARTIN:</p>
<p>Prime Minister thank you for your time. Now you are a committed</p>
<p>   family man and the father of two young men, what went through your</p>
<p>   mind today when you had to make the decision to send other young</p>
<p>   men off to put their lives on the line?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Everything you can imagine. It is the hardest decision I have taken</p>
<p>   as Prime Minister. It certainly involved a greater sense of responsibility,</p>
<p>   a sense of dread, but also a belief that the country had really</p>
<p>   no alternative.</p>
<p>MARTIN:</p>
<p>Were you aware that you are the first Coalition Prime Minister</p>
<p>   in 30 years to send Australian troops to war?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I don't know that I would quite put it in those terms.</p>
<p>   I mean, the vessel we sent to the Gulf in 1991 was exposed to some</p>
<p>   of the most hostile activity there. So in that sense it is a continuum</p>
<p>   of what was done then. But we do have a responsibility, we can't</p>
<p>   shut our eyes and pretend that this is something that ultimately</p>
<p>   won't affect us.</p>
<p>MARTIN:</p>
<p>Do you serious think there is a threat of something like anthrax</p>
<p>   in Australia's water supply?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well not immediately, no. But there could be in countries bordering</p>
<p>   on Iraq and if he is able to do it then other rogue states, perhaps</p>
<p>   closer to home, might believe that they can do it as well.</p>
<p>MARTIN:</p>
<p>Will you get a chance to look the SAS men in the face before they</p>
<p>   go off?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes I will. I will want to see them if ultimately before they go,</p>
<p>   if ultimately that is the contribution that is agreed between us</p>
<p>   and the United States. We are still discussing with the United States</p>
<p>   the nature of our contribution. But we have indicated, both in my</p>
<p>   discussions with President Clinton and also in the discussions between</p>
<p>   our defence people and the American defence people, that the sort</p>
<p>   of contribution we would make is a small detachment of the SAS and</p>
<p>   of the 707s. And I would certainly want very much to see the men</p>
<p>   before they go.</p>
<p>MARTIN:</p>
<p>Did you speak to President Clinton and is he pleased with Australia?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes he is. I spoke to President Clinton on Saturday when he rang</p>
<p>   to make the request and I rang him again this afternoon immediately</p>
<p>   after I had announced the decision of the Australian people. He</p>
<p>   was very grateful. He expressed the hope to me, and I share it very</p>
<p>   devoutly, that military action will not be necessary. And I believe</p>
<p>   that the more countries that line up publicly with the United States</p>
<p>   the greater is the pressure on Iraq and on Saddam Hussein to see</p>
<p>   the folly for his own people of the course of action that he is</p>
<p>   taking.</p>
<p>MARTIN:</p>
<p>Does it worry you that America's Middle East allies who were</p>
<p>   there in the Gulf War in Â‘91 are not there today and are saying</p>
<p>   no?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>It is too early to write them off, it is too early. And, of course,</p>
<p>   some of them have already indicated a willingness to make airfields</p>
<p>   and other installations available.</p>
<p>MARTIN:</p>
<p>Who was that?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>One or two have done that I am not at liberty to say more.</p>
<p>MARTIN:</p>
<p>Does this mean that if we send SAS troops does this mean we are</p>
<p>   at war with Iraq?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No it doesn't mean that. It means that we are part of a multi-national</p>
<p>   force led by the United States, acting persuant to a Security Council</p>
<p>   resolution to ensure that weapons, the material that is dangerous</p>
<p>   to neighbouring countries and potentially to others is destroyed.</p>
<p>   It doesn't mean that we are automatically at war. And bear</p>
<p>   in mind that the unit that we are proposing to send is meant to</p>
<p>   be engaged in a search and destroy operation.</p>
<p>MARTIN:</p>
<p>But do they have the...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I am sorry, search and rescue not search and destroy, I am sorry,</p>
<p>   search and rescue.</p>
<p>MARTIN:</p>
<p>Alright, search and rescue behind the lines again, do they have</p>
<p>   the protection of prisoner of war status?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well they will have all of the protections that can be available.</p>
<p>   But at this stage we are discussing with the Americans what is involved.</p>
<p>   Bear in mind if you are dealing here with the most highly trained</p>
<p>   section of the Australian Defence Force.</p>
<p>MARTIN:</p>
<p>Would you agree that most people, I guess around the world, want</p>
<p>   to get rid of Saddam rather than kill the Iraqi people?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes I do. </p>
<p>MARTIN:</p>
<p>So what happens PM when those first CNN pictures come in of dead</p>
<p>   babies and crying old people and destroyed buildings, what happens</p>
<p>   then?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I understand the emotional effect of that, I also have been</p>
<p>   told that the Americans have refined even further the precision</p>
<p>   of their military activities since the Gulf War in 1991. I don't</p>
<p>   pretend to the Australian people that there might not be people</p>
<p>   killed or hurt outside the immediate targets, that unfortunately</p>
<p>   is the tragic consequence of when you are dealing with a dictator</p>
<p>   like Saddam Hussein. I mean, if you always factor that into account</p>
<p>   you never do anything and he wins.</p>
<p>MARTIN:</p>
<p>Do you fear a split though, a retaliation from Arab Australians</p>
<p>   or Islamic Australians?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No I don't. And I want to say to Australians of Arab descent</p>
<p>   and of the Islamic faith that you are valued Australians like all</p>
<p>   other Australians, that my Government will not tolerate any kind</p>
<p>   of victimisation or any kind of singling out. I think by and large</p>
<p>   they faired extremely well during the time of the Gulf War. And</p>
<p>   I want to make an appeal to all Australians that under no circumstances</p>
<p>   should the odium of what Saddam Hussein has done and what he represents,</p>
<p>   under no circumstances should that odium attach to any Arab Australians,</p>
<p>   they should be treasured and protected as should all other Australians.</p>
<p>MARTIN:</p>
<p>Well finally Prime Minister, you know that President Clinton is</p>
<p>   going to be accused of going to war against Iraq as a diversion</p>
<p>   to his sex scandals, how do you answer that?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I don't believe it.</p>
<p>MARTIN:</p>
<p>It is already being said.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I know it is being said. I think if you look at it objectively</p>
<p>   in those terms that accusation is untrue, I don't believe it,</p>
<p>   I don't accept it and I don't think it should be allowed<br />
 46;t accept it and I don't think it should be allowed</p>
<p>   to divert President Clinton from his role as the Leader of the free</p>
<p>   world.</p>
<p>MARTIN:</p>
<p>Prime Minister I wish you well.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>[Ends]</p>
