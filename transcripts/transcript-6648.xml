PRIMEUSMINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 17 June 1985<br />
The US Government's recent announcement of a<br />
program of export assistance for US agricultural exports<br />
has wide-ranging implications for international trade in<br />
agriculture. The US export enhancement program is<br />
intended to increase US agricultural exports and challenge<br />
unfair marketing practices.<br />
As this program has evolved, the Australian Government has<br />
brought to the attention of United States' authorities our<br />
concerns about the program and identified legitimate<br />
Australian interests which could be affected by it.<br />
On 6 June I wrote to President Reagan, drawing attention to<br />
these interests and recalling discussions on this subject<br />
which I had in Washington in February.<br />
Last week, John Kerin discussed the matter with US Secretary<br />
of Agriculture, John Block, as a follow-up to a letter which<br />
Mr Kerin had sent to his US counterpart on 22 May.<br />
In these various representations there are three points that<br />
we have sought to stress:<br />
We appreciate the frustrations with unfair agricultural<br />
practices, particularly those of the European Community,<br />
which have in part led to the United States' program.<br />
our own agricultural sector has for a number of years<br />
been severely affected by the use of EC export subsidies.<br />
We would hope, and expect, however, that the program<br />
would be targeted, both in terms of products and regions,<br />
in such a way as to minimise the damage to countries,<br />
such as Australia, that are efficient and competitive<br />
suppliers.<br />
We wo'ild have preferred that the problems to which this<br />
program is directed were dealt with in a broader<br />
negotiating framework.<br />
This last point is crucial. Indeed, any success the US<br />
export enhancement program might achieve will rest on its<br />
ability to bring other trading countries and blocs to the<br />
negotiating table, where the distortions in agricultural<br />
trade can be properly addressed. </p>
<p>This is an ultimate goal which we share with the United<br />
States if, as is the Administration's intention, their own<br />
farm sector is to become more market-oriented.<br />
In our approaches to the US Government we have received<br />
encouraging assurances that in the implementation of the<br />
export enhancement program the interests of countries such<br />
as Australia will be taken into account. The process of<br />
consultation will take tangible shape tomorrow when<br />
Australian officials and a representative of the Australian<br />
Wheat Board meet in Washington with representatives of key<br />
Departments of the United States' Administration.<br />
My Government attaches considerable importance to this<br />
question and, should the need arise, an opportunity to discuss<br />
it further will be presented when Secretary of State,<br />
George Shultz, visits Australia in July.<br />
The United States sees this new initiative as the only<br />
alternative left if it is not to lose further its share of<br />
the world market. Australia is not in a position to<br />
meet subsidy with subsidy. Our markets are under a potential<br />
threat. It is against this background that we will continue<br />
in our constructive efforts to help bring the international<br />
trading community to the negotiating table for the purpose of<br />
establishing fair rules for trade in agriculture which all<br />
nations will adhere to. This is the only effective and<br />
equitable way of dealing with the serious problems we now<br />
face. </p>
