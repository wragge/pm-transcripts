AUSTRAJLI N-AMERICAN ASSOC IATIONt-UNCH-EON<br />
SYDNEY, N. S. W. 17 APRIL 1972<br />
Speech by the Prime Minister, the Rt Hon. W. McMahon, CH, _ MP<br />
May I formally express to you the admiration that<br />
I have for all that the Association is doing. And I believe it<br />
is doing it in the int-6. rests of our two countries that is our<br />
continuing friendship with the United States, which I want to<br />
stress, the United States being the acknowledged leader of the<br />
free world, and our great Partner, as you all know, in the<br />
Pacific. Today I want to talk about that friendship in a<br />
very special kind of context. That context is -the changing<br />
situation in Asia, with all its great potential for good, and<br />
also, of course, its dangers.<br />
And I think that I'm speaking here at an appropriate<br />
time too. Because even though a few weeks ago people could have<br />
felt that the dangers were remote, I think the days have come<br />
-when we all realise that the unexpected can happen, and can<br />
happen in an unfavourable way for us. Because who would have<br />
thought three weeks ago that we could have had another offensive<br />
from the North Vietnamese on the South Vietnamese, with all the<br />
attending danger and all the potentialities that that could bring<br />
in its wake. Now I'm sure you know the position of the super and<br />
the great powers in the Asian area. Japan, for example, has become<br />
a superpower economically. China now moves into new associations<br />
with the rest of the world. The Soviet is showing an increasing<br />
interest in Asia and as you know, the North Vietnamese are<br />
increasing attacks on So" th Vietnam. The Nixon Doctrine is one<br />
which calls on nations of the world, Particularly in the Asian<br />
theatre, to do more in their own defence and to have greater<br />
regional co-operation. And running through all this, is what they call the<br />
bilateral relations or relationship between various countries.<br />
The most of these happens to be the dramatic visit to Peking and<br />
other parts of Continental China by the President of the United<br />
States. Now, I think you know t1-hat we have been busy for a<br />
long time ourselves, trying to establish what is called a dialogue<br />
with the Peoples' Republic of China. We were successful, hut<br />
immediately after the admission of the Peoples' Republic into the<br />
United Nations, the di'alogue ceased.<br />
But it has again been resumed. I think it is not<br />
unfair to say that even some time before the US took an initiative,<br />
we were taking one because it was our view that the PRO should<br />
be brought into the international world that it should be able<br />
to talk at the United Nations, to make its views known, and to<br />
permit others to make their views known to China as well. ./ 2 </p>
<p>IThere<br />
have been other developments, of course, but<br />
I won't go into them to any great extent, oth -1; X-than to mention the<br />
potentials of hostility between China and the6 USSR and America's<br />
relations with Japan and the changing context in which these relations<br />
are taking place. And also the visit soon to take place by President<br />
Nixon to the Soviet Union, which we hope can lead to a greater detente,<br />
disturbed a little, I must confess, by the events in North Vietnam<br />
and South Vietnam over the last few weeks.<br />
Now when I refer to the superpowers, I want you to<br />
know that I refer to the United States and the USSR. These are superpowers<br />
in strength of resources both -military and civil. W] hat I want<br />
to point out to you is what the superpowers are doing, and consequently,<br />
the way in which we must look at our problems. We must understand<br />
what impact their influence can have upon us. Among the smaller<br />
Asian countries and, I believe, in others in the region, including<br />
Australia, tho idea of seeking Asian solutions to Asian problems is<br />
growing. I remember when I went to the Djakarta Conference in<br />
order to see what we could do about peace in Cambodia,' or a guarantee<br />
of peace. That was the first time I heard the Asian peoples<br />
themsel. ves say " Can't we create an Asian identity?-"-Not an identity of<br />
disparate nations or independently pro-nations who weren't strong enough<br />
to look after themselves, but couldn't we in fact create an Asian<br />
identity that in terms of trade and mutual security will be able to<br />
play our part in our constant growth and development, and would be<br />
an impediment to aggressive or subversive action by others?"<br />
But I did refer too, Mr President, to the necessity<br />
or I should have referred to it under the Nixon Doctrine for each<br />
country to be able to do more in the protection of its own interests.<br />
Not that I believe that it means the Unitied States is likely to<br />
leave them alone under all circumstances. But what I am sure about<br />
i4 this. The more you do for yourselves within your own capacity,<br />
the greater will be the desire and the wish of the United States to<br />
make a contribution to the defence and to the freedom of those<br />
countries as part and parcel of the defence and freedo-m of the free<br />
world. But I want to emphasise that no country can go it alone<br />
under all circumstances and conditions, and simultaneously make a<br />
contribution to the peace and prosperity in this part of the world<br />
in which we live. I emphasise, too, that this is not a wealthy part of the<br />
world, leaving Japan and ouselves out of it. There are many parts<br />
where for humanitarian reasons we all have to help, particularly,<br />
Bangladesh. We've all got to try and make a contribution to see<br />
that these people are able to have the good things of life in the<br />
same way that our own people can enjoy them today.<br />
So I want to turn to this question of co-operatn<br />
co-oceration in order to cultivate a stable climate for neace and<br />
development. This is what we are trying to do in the Asian context. ./ 3 </p>
<p>3<br />
What we want is a climate to which the United States<br />
will continue to make a-contribution. We want this trend to<br />
continue this trend of co-operation not only with us, but with<br />
Sall people, of all free people, particularly in the Asian theatre.<br />
I can assure--you,.. as. the Head of Government, that we will do all<br />
in our power, to be able to make our contribution in whatever way<br />
we can. These are the reasons why Australia has welcomed the<br />
development of ASEAN, and is taking an active part in such regional<br />
organisations as SEATO, ASPAC, ECAFE and the Asian Development<br />
Bank. This is the reason why we have established the Five Power<br />
Defence arrangements with Malaysia, Singapore, New Zealand and the<br />
United Kingdom. I can assure you that those arrangements are welcomed<br />
by the Malaysians and the Singaporeans, no matter what you mght have<br />
heard from other sources. I add that the Prime Minister of<br />
Malaysia, Tun Razak, does not regard these arrangements as<br />
incompatible with the ASEAN objective of regional neutralisation.<br />
It is for this reason, too, that we have a programme<br />
of defence co-operation with Indonesia. Recently we had President<br />
Soeharto down here, and I think we realised more emphatically than<br />
we've ever realied before how much they wanted to co-operate, and<br />
how much we think it desirable that we should co-operate with them.<br />
Recently we have been able to aoprove the gift of<br />
a fairly large number of Sabre aircraft to Indonesia and of help<br />
in the construction of the airfield at Iswahjudi, so that they will<br />
have aircraft that will be able to make a contribution to their<br />
deterrent effect in the Asian region.<br />
I also want to mention that for the last five years,<br />
our programme of what is called Government aid, but frankly<br />
which I should call your aid because you make the contribution in<br />
terms of financial assistance and taxation. We are third in the<br />
world as a giver of Government or national aid to the developing<br />
countries, and a large part of this aid does go to Indonesia.<br />
Government aid is the financial and material assistance<br />
we give expressed as a percentage of our gross national production.<br />
You will be glad to know that we are pretty high up in world<br />
affairs with the amount we give something like 1 per cent<br />
of cur gross national production. That is the goal that is set by<br />
international organisations when they ask other countries to be<br />
of assistance. Now it is sometimes said and I've said this before,<br />
particularly at the National Press Club in Washington, that we are<br />
a satellite of the United States and that this might affect our<br />
standing in Asia. I want to assure you this is nonsense. We are<br />
free and independent and, I believe respected throughout the world,<br />
not only for our growing maturity and independence of thought and<br />
action, but because they know we are reliable friends. / 4 </p>
<p>-4<br />
During my recent visit to the tUnjted States, I<br />
said more than once that Australia is a-!_ artrfer with the United-<br />
States in many areas. In my discussions with the Amxerican leadexs_,_.<br />
they responded warmly to the concept of partnership between our'<br />
two countries. And I think I can emphasise that the ones who<br />
responded most warmly to the concept of partnership were those<br />
members of the Admi'nistration under President Nixon who had an<br />
intimate concern with Australia and wanted to make sure that<br />
relationships between the two countries improved.<br />
As an act of policy judged to be in our national<br />
interest, we have decided<br />
closer relationship between the two countries will be to our<br />
mutual advantage. Now this choice does not foreclose differenqes<br />
of opinion nor does it foreclose different policies on different<br />
issues. It is happily reinforced by a genuine warmth of feeling<br />
and mutual understanding which your Association has done-so much<br />
to achieve. But the point I want toemphasise now is that our<br />
partnership with the United States is based', in the first place,<br />
on a hard-headed assessment of mutual national interest. And I<br />
think you can take it for granted that in international political<br />
affairs, naturally enough each country thinks first and foremost<br />
of its own national interest, and then of the contribution it can<br />
make to the solution of the problems of world affairs.<br />
I have to emphasise to you that when we are looking<br />
at our international relationships, of course, the first consideration<br />
is national interest rather than that of other countries.<br />
our formal pqrtnershi.-finds expression in the ANZUS Treaty. The<br />
assurances which I received from President Nixon in Washington,<br />
spontaneol4sly received, have been reinforced by what he said in<br />
his recent state of the world address.<br />
We in Australia, I can assure you, welcome this<br />
confirmation. And we also regard ANZUS as central to our<br />
Asian policies. It is a defence treaty, and something morq.<br />
It must not be turned into a solely social welfare concept as some<br />
of our opponents are trying to turn it.<br />
It is the framework for a wide-ranging system of<br />
co-operatin covering all fields of international relations. ' The<br />
emphasis on self-reliance has long been basic to our foreign defence<br />
policy, and I believe that it antedated the Nixon Doctrine.<br />
I say this only because I want to emphasise the<br />
independent kind of action we take and the way in which I think<br />
the new Department of Foreign Affairs is constantly alert to the<br />
need for new initiatives whenever we feel that it will be in our<br />
own national interest. But what thi * s elf-relance is, is one within the<br />
framework of our alliance with the United States. Inevitably,<br />
and this ought to be stressed, we have followed parallel policies<br />
to those of the United States in a number of what I shall call<br />
ASEAN initiatives. We have done so when we have thought it would<br />
be in Australia's best interests that we have those mutually<br />
accomdating policies.<br />
May I take one exam Pie, and that is our negotiations </p>
<p>with China, which is now after years in the wilderpness a member of<br />
the United Nations.' Iannounced that-Auatralia-was seeking--t6-...<br />
normalise relations with the People's Republic of China shortly<br />
after I became the Prime Minister..<br />
I well remember that paper, prepared as it was by<br />
the Department of Foreign Affairs and myself, because I think it<br />
did start a new epoch for Australia, and drew attention in the<br />
most forceful way to the changes that were occurring in the Pacific.<br />
And I want to emphasise that it was taken at a fairly early date so<br />
far as the Western countries are concerned. It is the nature of<br />
things that a superpower, such as the United States, would have much<br />
more scope for a dialogue and for a wider range of issues with<br />
another great power, than one of the medium-sized countries like<br />
ourselves, because it is not so exposed to a demand for making<br />
important concessions on major issues.<br />
Now Australia is, understandably, in a different<br />
position to the United States. As I said following the Nixon<br />
" isit, I hope that all nations would be treated alike by China. That<br />
hope has not so far been realised. But we hope it will come. Now<br />
I can assure you that the dialogue which did temporarily end<br />
immediatel) after China entered the-United Nationg has now been<br />
reopened, and I believe, is proceeding on a sensible and, I believe,<br />
reasonable course. Now, Mr President, we have parallel policies on<br />
many issues with America, so, too, do our policies diverge in other<br />
areas. Let me give you an example from the past. During the<br />
confrontagion in Indonesia a few years' ago, Australia maintained<br />
its relations and contacts with that country. And we did so betause<br />
we believed that if we weathered the storm, a firm foundation would<br />
be prepored for better relations in the future with Indonesia.<br />
And our wish and our intentions have-come true.<br />
This policy has paid handsome dividends, and is<br />
underlined by the recent visit of the President that I referred to<br />
a few moments ago. Again, but not so Much on exactly the same scale,<br />
but again during the recent crisis on the Indian sub-continent, our<br />
policy again tempcrarily diverged from that of the United States.<br />
Although we were, and remain, anxious to maintain<br />
our friendly relations with Pakistan, we took the view that peace<br />
and stability in the region were likely to be best served by our<br />
immediate recognition of Bangladesh. So Australia did take the<br />
initiative, not only in the Asian theatre, but in the United States<br />
and amongst the continental countries in order to see if like-ipinded<br />
countries could join, and join as quickly as they could in recognition<br />
and in giving assistance to that country.<br />
The fact therefore is this. I hope those two points<br />
that I have mentioned make it clear that our policies are Australian,<br />
and I believe recognised as such and respected as such in Asia.<br />
Much as our opponents contest this view, our alliance<br />
with the United States is understood and accepted in Asia azd in<br />
many cases it enhances our standing and importance in the region.<br />
So we do get the indirect benefit of the very friendly and worthwhile<br />
relationships which we have with our great neighbour over to the East.<br />
But of course we can't affQrd to let this be taken<br />
for granted. We must continue to develop a distinctively Austra'lian<br />
role in the Asian region. And we are. moving in the right direction<br />
in demonstrating that we are helpful and we are cp-operative with<br />
them. / 6 </p>
<p>I have spoken alroady of the hopeful signs of great<br />
power accommodation, of growing confidence and co-operation within<br />
the region itself. There remain problems in the region which<br />
are cause for concern. I mention again the position in South<br />
Vietnam. The invasion by the North in blatant defiance of the<br />
Geneva Agreements is causing the South Vietnamese Government its<br />
greatest test. This, I emphasise, is aggression, naked and.<br />
unashamed, and is being increasingly accepted as such by most<br />
people even those in the Western world who a few months ago were<br />
critics. Now it's still too early to speak with confidenqe about<br />
the outcome. But what we can say, and what we can emphasise, is<br />
that because the Americans and their Allies, including Australia,<br />
have done so much fighting and training and rehabilitating in the<br />
South, the South Vietnamese Army and the South Vietnamese people<br />
are now better trained, better armed and able to take this onslaught<br />
in a way they would not have been capable of taking three or four<br />
years ago. I can assure you, too, that it is giving a good<br />
account of itself.<br />
I do ask you all to note that the offensive now is almost<br />
wholly by the North Vietnamese. The Communists have not launched<br />
this offensive as ' they did at the time of the ' Pet offensive in<br />
the mistaken belief that there would be a spontaneous uprising of<br />
sympathisers throughout South Vietnam. The war in Indochina is<br />
likely to remain with us for some time to come. We want to negotiate<br />
a settlement. And we will continue to seek a peaceful one, but<br />
the inflexibility of the Communists is against an early settlement<br />
and we can see no prospect at the moment however much we and<br />
America and our friends will try in the intervening period to get<br />
one. In the meantime, the Oc~ ernment will continue to assist<br />
the South Vietnamese in other~ ways, even though our troops are home<br />
now. In particular, in economic development and other aid, we<br />
will continue to play our part.<br />
Now there are, of course, other areas of concern for<br />
us in Asia, including the great humaitarizn tasks and development<br />
problems facing the peopl. e of th( region.<br />
This is the situation in Asia as we see it today. The. Ai<br />
picture is a hopeful one. It is also a dynamic one. Recent Changd liv,<br />
have bQen staggering compared with centuries and centuries of little<br />
change. Change is everywhere and everything is changing. we must,<br />
in Australia, be alive to these changes, flexible in our approach,<br />
and we must be willing to take the initiative in meeting the<br />
demands of this new situation, whether it might be in terms of<br />
defence and security, whether it is in terms of aid or personal<br />
visits, whether it is in terms of friendship and co-operation.<br />
In each and every one of these areas, we and the United States must,<br />
and I am sure will, be prepared to play our part.<br />
The free world does hold many initiatives. Australia's<br />
policies in Asia, based on our alliance with the United States,<br />
are, I believe, one of the keys to a stable and prosperous future<br />
for the world in which we have to live. </p>
