    <content><![CDATA[<p>9 DECEMBER 1986</p>
<p>I shall visit three countries of the Middle East from lateÂ January to early February 1987 as part of the overseasÂ program which will take me to Switzerland to deliver theÂ opening address to the Davos Meeting on 29 January.Â I look forward to visiting Jordan, Israel and Egypt, all ofÂ which have warm and friendly relations with Australia.</p>
<p>The Middle East is of great importance to internationalÂ security and the world economy. It is also the originalÂ home of a good many Australians. The Australian GovernmentÂ has a close interest in Middle Eastern problems, includingÂ the continuing need for a peaceful resolution of theÂ Arab-Israeli dispute, the situation in Lebanon and theÂ Iran-Iraq war.</p>
<p>My visit will provide an invaluable opportunity to discussÂ the current situation in the Middle East with a number ofÂ the key leaders, including King Hussein of Jordan,Â President Mubarak of Egypt and Prime Minister Shamir ofÂ Israel.</p>
