    <content><![CDATA[<p>9 DECEMBER 1986</p>
<p>I shall visit three countries of the Middle East from late January to early February 1987 as part of the overseas program which will take me to Switzerland to deliver the opening address to the Davos Meeting on 29 January. I look forward to visiting Jordan, Israel and Egypt, all of which have warm and friendly relations with Australia.</p>
<p>The Middle East is of great importance to international security and the world economy. It is also the original home of a good many Australians. The Australian Government has a close interest in Middle Eastern problems, including the continuing need for a peaceful resolution of the Arab-Israeli dispute, the situation in Lebanon and the Iran-Iraq war.</p>
<p>My visit will provide an invaluable opportunity to discuss the current situation in the Middle East with a number of the key leaders, including King Hussein of Jordan, President Mubarak of Egypt and Prime Minister Shamir of Israel.</p>
