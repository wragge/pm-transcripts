<p>PRESS CONFERENCE GIVEN BY THE PRIME MINISTER,<br />
THE RT. HON. R. G. MENZIES AT MASCOT ON THE<br />
MARCH. 6<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Anything I say that isn't right must be regarded as<br />
talking in my-sleep of which I have had very little.<br />
Shoot me!~ ( Laughter) I'd pay a handsome reward to a man<br />
who would shout me and finish it.<br />
dIell what do you want to know about?<br />
QUESTION: First of all, Sir, could you tell us what SEATO<br />
means by " appropriate action" if the fighting in-Laos<br />
doesn't stop, as reported in this morning's papers?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: You mean you want me to speculate about what may<br />
happen in Laos and what might be done if so-and-so happens,<br />
or something else happens. Oh, no! Not for meJ Not for<br />
me., The whole point about the SEATO Conference was that<br />
it reaffirmed the determination to take whatever-action<br />
might be needed under SEATO. There had been a few<br />
doubts, I think, in some minds as to whether it meant<br />
business. I think this Conference resolved those doubts.<br />
But as to what might need to be done under any given<br />
circumstances, whether military or para-military, or<br />
economic or whatever it may be, these are matters that<br />
will be d. etermined from time to time by the Governments<br />
concerned on advice from the Council representatives who<br />
sit constantly in Bangkok. It is not just theoretical,<br />
it's right.<br />
QUESTION: 11ould you care to commaent, Mr. Menzies, on the<br />
difference in view between yourself and Mr. Macmillan?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: What are they? Do tell me; do help me by telling<br />
rae. All I have had is ochoes of leading articles in<br />
Australia. And as I was unaware of these differences I<br />
would be delighted if you would tell me what they are.<br />
Because Mr. Macrmillan and I, who are groat frien4s and<br />
who have seen a lot of each other over these natters,<br />
still don't know what they are. Could you tell me?<br />
Thank you.<br />
QUESTION: Mr. Macrmillan's staterient about South Africa differs<br />
from your statemient which we have received in Australia.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Does it? In what way?<br />
QUESTION: Your attack on the exclusion of South Africa was<br />
quite fiery at the Australia Club.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: And you thought his was less fiery did you? Well<br />
this is a very odd kind of difference of opinion. He<br />
sounded less fiery than I did. iVell if that is lhe only<br />
difference between us you can put it down to my<br />
passionate Celtic teriperament.<br />
QUESTION: PRIME MINISTEI<br />
QUESTION: Yesterday, Sir, Lord Casey, before he loft here<br />
said that he considered that it was a good thing that<br />
South Africa had left the Corrionwealth of Nations. Do<br />
you think it is a good thing<br />
I didn't hear what he said. I doubt rhether he said<br />
Would you care to comment on South Africa's<br />
withdrawal </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER: I think it is a great misfortune, a great<br />
misfortune. I have said that repeatedly. I hope it has<br />
reached hero. I think it is a groat pity that one of the<br />
foundation members of the Cour. onwealth should be out.<br />
And I think it is an even greater pity that a<br />
foundation member of the Commonwealth whose citizens<br />
have fought alongside our citizens in two wars should be<br />
out on an issue which is primarily, whatever else you<br />
nay say about it a matter of internal policy. Quite<br />
frankly I don't like this idea that we are to question<br />
each other's internal policies and on the strength of<br />
our views about the internal policies of another<br />
country, either nudge each other out or beckon bach<br />
other in. This is not ny idea of the Comnonwoalth.<br />
Q UESTION: Do you think it is a dangerous principle?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I do, I do. Undoubtedly.<br />
QUESTION: Do you have any foolings, Sir, about Sir Roy<br />
Welnsky's statement regarding Australia's white<br />
Australia Policy?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I didn't hear him make a statement on Australia's<br />
white-Australia policy. Sorry.<br />
QUESTION: It was suggested that the white-Australia policy<br />
of Australia and the apartheid policy were one and the<br />
sane thing.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
PRESSMAN: PRIME MINISTER: s
QUESTION: PRIME MINISTER:<br />
QUESTION: Who suggested this?<br />
Welensky and also some commentators<br />
Welensky? Did he really? Well I didn't hear him<br />
ay it. But what do you think about<br />
But I didn't hear Sir Roy Welensky say it.<br />
Some of the papers have said it<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Oh, of course! The papers have said sonething!<br />
Oh, dear now, cone comel What haven't they said?<br />
Really, you nustnt take advantage of me in this way. I<br />
an an innocent fellow.<br />
QUESTION: Do you think things will be easier now in the<br />
British Commonwealth of Nations now that South Africa<br />
has left?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I don't, no.<br />
QUESTION: You don't think there will be less embarrassment<br />
now?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I don't. Indeed it is very interesting. There<br />
will be some people who will now, as they havo indicated,<br />
attack South Africa in the United Nations. A few people<br />
have offered to move to expel South Africa from the<br />
United Nations because of South Africa's racial policy.<br />
But, oddly enough, the very sane people want to import<br />
into the United Nations Cormunist China, which apparently<br />
doesn't deny human rights. All this is too much for me.<br />
I don't understand it. </p>
<p>QUESTION: But Mr. Menzies was South Africa edged out of the<br />
Commonwealth?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I don't think that Dr. Verwoerd had the slightest<br />
option on the final day. I will be making a full<br />
statement about this in Parliament when Parliament<br />
resumes. I will be delighted to. Aind people, so far as<br />
I an concerned, will be completely at liberty, in<br />
Parliament as well as out, to agree or disagree. But<br />
I shall make the whole of my own views quite plain. But<br />
if there is one thing that is quite certain and after<br />
all I was there and no newspaper reporter was it is<br />
that Dr. Verwoerd had no option but to withdraw his<br />
application.<br />
QUESTION: Can you explain why?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Of course I can explain why. Suppose you, having<br />
agreed to a form of corunique which stated the criticisms<br />
quite fairly and the answor quite concisely, suppose you<br />
had agreed to that, and then you were told by Prime<br />
Minister after Prime Minister that he would never let up<br />
until he had got rid of you, would you remain? Of<br />
course not! I must say that I thought the gentleman was<br />
very patient I would have left about two rounds earlier.<br />
Of course he had no option but to go. And if what is<br />
said leaves you with no option but to withdraw your<br />
application, well you can use whatever headlines you like<br />
about that, but we all know what it means.<br />
There was a fantastic story circulating in a<br />
section of the aiglish Sunday press to the effect that<br />
after everybody else had agreed to the communique Dr.<br />
Verwoerd attacked the other members. That is completely<br />
untrue. Dr. Verwoerd had agreed to the corvmunique. I<br />
thought the whole problem was over. So did Mr.<br />
Macmillan, with whom I am supposed to have great disagreement.<br />
I remember after that adjournment he said to<br />
me, " It is all right; Verwoord has agreed to the<br />
cor. miunique." " Well' I said, " this is splendid.. Then our<br />
problem is over." And when Verwoerd had indicated that<br />
he agreed, and Mr. Macmillan had confirried that and<br />
announced it, then it was and then only that certain<br />
other Prime Ministers indicated that this was no good and<br />
it was then, for the first time, that Dr. Verwoord said,<br />
" Well I must consider ry position," withdrew for a little<br />
while, considered his position, came back and said I<br />
thought most courteously, because he is a man of outstanding<br />
courtesy and dignity, whatever you think about<br />
his policies he is that kind of man he cane back and<br />
said, " Well, all things considered I must withdraw my<br />
application." Now that was the fact of it. This story I wish<br />
people did not publish stories that can only be got from<br />
lying sources. Because this happened to be a , rivate<br />
meeting, therefore no story could be got with honour from<br />
anybody. But that story ras completely untrue√∏<br />
QUESTION: If this principle is carried to its logical<br />
conclusion, could it wreck the conference if members were<br />
asked to sit in jud;_ ment on one another?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well, I think I have made this clear. I think it<br />
would be a terrible thing wcre meetings of Prime<br />
Ministers to become courts either of morals or of<br />
justice or of whatever it may be, sitting in judgment on<br />
each other. We have lived for many years by not sitting I </p>
<p>in judgoent on oach other. Nobody supposes that I am<br />
responsible for the political policies of Ghana or the<br />
racial policies of some other country in the Comnonwealth.<br />
Of course not until this time. I think it is<br />
a great pity. I think it alters the character of the<br />
Couionwealth. Perhaps I an out of date. Perpahs this<br />
is a bettor kind of Connonwoalth. Well that is a matter<br />
of opinion, but it is not my idea.<br />
QUESTION: Do you think this could lead to Prine Ministers'<br />
censure at future meetings about our role in Now Guinea?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Why not? Once the door is opened, how do you close<br />
it? And if the door remains open, then are we to<br />
understand that our policies, enlightened as they no<br />
doubt are in Papua and New Guinea, won't be exposed to<br />
examination in a Cornonwealth mneting. Our innigration<br />
policy a policy desined to save Australia from the<br />
Smuth African problen, don't forget, and therefore a<br />
great policy for Australia is this to be brought up?<br />
I don't know. All I : now is that if these natters if<br />
this becomes the practice, then the Connonwealthwill<br />
convert itself into a debating society, into a rather<br />
strange forun of judg-ent and decision and, under those<br />
circumstances well, you nay tell ne that it will<br />
endure but it won't be the Cor. onwealth that I have ever<br />
thought about, or known.<br />
QUESTION: Do you think that by S. outh Africa going from the<br />
Connonwealth this will put us into a nore difficult<br />
position with Asia than if they stayed in?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Oh, that is all a matter of opinion. Look you say<br />
" a difficulty with Asia". There is a great disposition<br />
to assume that all Asian countries think the sane. They<br />
don't, any nore than all European couhtries think the<br />
same. Don't fall into that error. I would not<br />
undertake to say that there was an Asian opinion on the<br />
matter of our innigration policy. Tungku Abdul Rahran<br />
has repeatedly said, publicly, that he thinks it is all<br />
right; it is our business, we have the right to do it.<br />
Others nay have another view. Not one of t'en has ever<br />
criticised the policy to ne. The criticism of our<br />
innigration policy is chiefly confined to a few<br />
itinerant Australians and a few gontlemen in Australia,<br />
including one or two on the press.<br />
QUESTION: If that be so, Sir, why was it necessary to raise<br />
the possibility that it nay be criticised in the future?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: But isn't it obvious? Isn't it obvious? If you<br />
can criticise the racial policy of one country the<br />
internal racial policy and put such pressure on that<br />
country that it leaves, why cantt you criticise the<br />
racial policy of another country? I mean these are very<br />
fine distinctions. Nobody raised that natter, but I did<br />
myself. I did nyself. I said: " Where does this process<br />
end?" because I feel very strongly about this business of<br />
butting in on the donestic policy of another country.<br />
And I would like you all to renmeber this. Apartheid,<br />
separate development there is the choice, you develop<br />
the races separately or you develop then by a process of<br />
integration. Integration is a pretty new doctrine, don't<br />
forget, pretty new this is post-colonial integration.<br />
But that is a choice of statesranship and this has been<br />
the policy. 1 don't agree with the policy. Now that it<br />
is all out, I've said so. I didn't nake public comnents<br />
before. I don't agree because I think that the nore it </p>
<p>QUESTION: succeeds in raising the level of the Bantu the more<br />
disastrously will it fail in the long run because he<br />
won't be treated as a second-rate citizen, he won't be<br />
pushed off the footpath and I think that the end of this<br />
policy is disaster. But that is a problem of judjient.<br />
All I know is that I have attended as many Prime<br />
Ministers' Conferences as anybody else in history and<br />
until last year I had never heard it mentioned, although<br />
the policy bejan with Jan Smuts.<br />
Surely, Sir, it isn't so much apartheid being<br />
directly criticised as the administration, things like<br />
Sharpeville<br />
PRIME MINISTER: ' Things like Sharpeville.'' Is that the only incident<br />
that you know of in which people have been k1illed?<br />
Of course it was a shiocking incident. Of course Langa<br />
was a shocking incident. But the people in London who<br />
stood around talking about Sharpeville and Langa, I<br />
didn't hear a word out of them about the massacres that<br />
occurred in the Congo. Not a word.' Let us be fair on<br />
this matter. Don't let us be too political. If we are<br />
going to be humane, let us be humane all round.<br />
QUESTION: But shouldn't we expect a better standard of<br />
conduct from a foundatin member of the Commonwealth?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Of course, of course.' But was the Government of<br />
South Africa responsible for the shooting at Sharpeville?<br />
Did the Government order the shooting? Do we know that<br />
yet? No. Well, I think we should wait until we know.<br />
QUESTION: Mr. Menzies is there any possibility of you saying<br />
anything about a new Governor-General?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No, none.<br />
QUESTION: There is a rumour in Canberra<br />
PRIME MINISTE: I'm sure there is.( Laughter)<br />
QUESTION: There is a rumour at the moment that Lord<br />
Carrington could be the man?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Oh, you disappoint me. I thought the rumour would<br />
have been that I was going to be. Oh, what a pity. That<br />
is a blow to my ambitions. There is no appointment yet.<br />
QUESTION: PRIME MINISTE<br />
QUESTION: PRIME MINISTE<br />
QUESTION: PRIME MINISTE<br />
QUESTION: re It was reported, Sir, that you made<br />
commendations to the Queen? certain<br />
iR: I'm sure it was. I have read reports of every<br />
conceivable kind.<br />
Is it true?<br />
My conversations with the Queen, my dear fellow,<br />
are private until they produce a result.<br />
When will we know?<br />
Ti: I don't know. As soon as possible.<br />
Mr. Menzies did Australia make any offer to send<br />
forces to Laos if they were needed in the agreement<br />
under SEATO? </p>
<p>PRIM4E MINISTER: No occasion arose for people to make offers. The<br />
SEiTO organisation is set up under a treaty. The<br />
obligations are set out in the treaty. ' Je affirr: med on<br />
this occasion our obligations under the treaty.. And I<br />
imagine that the resolution has now been published,<br />
has it? Well that contains with precision, the results<br />
arrived at by all of us after a day and a half of<br />
constant discussion. I won't add to it because if I<br />
added to it I night subtract from it.<br />

QUESTION: PRIME MINISTER<br />
QUESTION: Did France raise any objection to the resolution..?<br />
Oh, now look, you don't think I an that kind of<br />
fellow do you? You want to get the lowdown, do you, on<br />
the discussions in SEATO. You won't ; et them from me.<br />
Sir do we support the Boun Oum regime or do we go<br />
along with the British in hoping for the return of the<br />
Souvanna Phouma regime?<br />
1: There is nothing to be added to what I haye said<br />
about this statenent on Laos. There it is. It speaks<br />
for itself. Did you havc any discussions on West New Guinea<br />
when you were in London?<br />
Oh, yes, in an occasional way, yes.<br />
Then you don't think it is an important vital<br />
issue at the moment?<br />
R: Does that follow? I think it is a tremendously<br />
important issue, but I did not go around London t4 king<br />
about it all the time. I had talks in the relevant<br />
places. Did you meet Dr. Luns?<br />
Oh, yes.<br />
Did the question of West New Guinea crop up then?<br />
Oh, yes. You nay be perfectly certain that whenever<br />
Dr. Luns and I meet that question crops up.' I mean<br />
that is a reasonable proposition.<br />
But you have no statement to make on the matter?<br />
No. Except that the policy that we have<br />
repeatedly stated about West New Guinea stands<br />
unaltered. Did you get the impression, Sir, at Bangkok, that<br />
the member nations of SEATO were as strong as ever<br />
against the Comm] unist menace?<br />
Stronger, stronger. I am perfectly certain that<br />
we cane out of this conference with the mnone:' nations<br />
stronger on that matter if they needed to o<br />
stronger than before. SEATO is more powerful and<br />
well-knit and significant today than it ever was before.<br />
I ari sure of that.<br />
Sir, do you still intend continue as Minister<br />
for Ecternal Affairs in view of the increasing world<br />
problems and the strain it riust impose on your time?<br />
i </p>
<p>0 7.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: 4ell, I don't know, I don't know. There seems to<br />
be a somewhat strange idea that the Prime Minister is<br />
not worried about external affairs, but a Minister for<br />
External Affairs is. I assure you that that is not<br />
right. I am not aware that I do any considerable ariount<br />
more now that I am Minister for Ecternal Affairs than I<br />
did as Prime Minister. Prime Ministers read the cables,<br />
you know, every day. They always discuss the high-level<br />
policies that emerge. I an not anxious to duplicate my<br />
work, but I will change this position as I see an<br />
opportunity and when it proves convenient. But I think<br />
it is easy to exaggerate the idea I notice it is<br />
exaggerated in certain quarters that I am trying to do<br />
two men's work all of a sudden. I don't mind that, but<br />
after all, Senator Gorton does an awful lot of the work<br />
in External Affairs. It is rather offensive to him to<br />
say that his work is negligible. He does a very great<br />
deal of work, so I an not doing two men's work. I am<br />
doing the work of a man and a third. Well, perhaps that<br />
is a mistake. I don't know. I will get around to it.<br />
QUESTION, What about our internal problems, Sir, regarding<br />
the present credit squeeze?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well since I left the plane, I have had no<br />
opportunity of looking into that matter.<br />
QUESTION: But you must be kept acquainted with what is going<br />
on here in Australia during your trips away?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well I have had one or two cables, yes. But you<br />
are going to ask me now to make a cormient on what has<br />
been happening in Australia while I have been away. No,<br />
I won't take on thro3e men's work. Two men's work is<br />
enough.<br />
With the complinents of<br />
R. C. Maley,<br />
Press Secretary to the Prime Minister. </p>
