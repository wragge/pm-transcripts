F77/ 159<br />
FOR PRESS 27 JULY .1977<br />
MESSAGE. TO. MR.. WRAN<br />
The Prime Minister has sent the following messages today to<br />
State Premiers. The first message was sent to Mr. Wran and<br />
the following messages to the other Premiers.<br />
My dear Premier,<br />
I refer to your telex letter of 24 July advising that your<br />
Government is considering the appointment of a Royal Commission<br />
on Drugs arnd seeking Commonwealth co-operation.<br />
May I emphasise at the outset that my Government is deeply<br />
concerned about the sources and illegal use of and the<br />
trafficking in drugs in Australia. It would seem from your<br />
letter that although the inquiry you are considering would<br />
relate to these matters in New South Wales, it would inevitably<br />
raise questions of national significance including the importation<br />
of drugs, their distribution in Australia, their effects<br />
on communities and individuals, and the measures for control<br />
and prevention which should be adopted.<br />
My Government is of the view that because of the national issues<br />
involved it would be more appropriate that a form of national<br />
inquiry be held rather than one confined to the limits of a<br />
particular State.<br />
I would propose therefore that the Commonwealth and State<br />
Attorneys-General should meet urgently to consider the terms<br />
of reference that might be adopted for the purposes of a national<br />
inquiry and the procedures which would be appropriate having<br />
regard to the interests and responsibilities of the Commonwealth<br />
and the States.<br />
I am writing to other State Premiers proposing that all the<br />
States and the Commonwealth join in establishing an inquiry<br />
into drugs* on a national basis. On receipt of their replies<br />
I will communicate with you again. / At the </p>
<p>-2<br />
At the same time my Government would not wish this inquiry<br />
to impede in any way the investigations by your Police<br />
into the disappearance of Mr. McKay at Griffith and quite<br />
clearly these investigations should proceed ahead of any<br />
national inquiry of the nature we suggest.<br />
May I emphasise that the Commonwealth is prepared within<br />
the limits of its resources to assist your Police in these<br />
investigations.<br />
My dear Premier,<br />
You will be aware that recently questions concerning the<br />
sources, illegal use of and -trafficking in drugs have arisen<br />
in relation to the disappearance of a Mr. McKay at Griffith<br />
in New South Wales.<br />
Following his disappearance demands were made for the setting<br />
up of a Royal Commission in that State, and the Premier,<br />
Mr. Wran, has indicated that he is considering such a<br />
Commission. Mr. Wran has written to me informing me of this and seeking<br />
Commonwealth co-operation. This inquiry would be confined<br />
to New South Wales but it seems to my Government that such<br />
an inquiry would inevitably raise issues of national importance<br />
including the importation of drugs, their distribution in<br />
Australia, their effects on communities and individuals, and<br />
the measures for control and prevention which should be adopted.<br />
Needless to say, my Government is greatly concerned about these<br />
matters and has come to the conclusion that it would be preferable<br />
that a form of national inquiry should be established in relation<br />
to this. I have today written to Mr. Wran suggesting this course.<br />
My Government proposes that the Attorneys-General of the<br />
Commonwealth and the States should meet as soon as practicable<br />
to formulate terms of reference for such an inquiry and determine<br />
the appropriate procedures.<br />
I am writing to seek your urgent response whether your Government<br />
would be prepared to co-operate in the manner I have suggested.<br />
If you agree, my Attorney-General will arrange an early meeting<br />
with your and other State Attorneys-General for the purposes I<br />
have outlined. </p>
