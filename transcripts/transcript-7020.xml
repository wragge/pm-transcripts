SPEECH BY THE PRIHE MINISTER<br />
METAL TRADES INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION<br />
OCTOSBER 1986<br />
Ladioca a3 Gentlemen,<br />
At the oztset lot me congratulate you on the timeliness and<br />
relovance of tho theme for your national forua: New<br />
Direction in Industrial Relations."<br />
I will raturn to this subject a little later because our<br />
indut[ fal relations system and its participants certainly<br />
have a ucor role to play in rebuilding the base for<br />
Austsrn ' s national prosperity.<br />
But girG7t lot me observe that, in preparing for this<br />
AddrooG, I wao struck with a certain sense of deja vu.<br />
When I cidressed the HTIA Annual Dinner soae three years<br />
ago, industrial relations and wages policy also formed an<br />
important part of my address.<br />
The isouo then was how boest to resurrect Australia from the<br />
malaise of 1982-83 and how to achieve wages outcomes and an<br />
industrial climate which would maximise the strength and<br />
length of Australia's economic recovery.<br />
The National Wage Case of 1983 had just concluded and<br />
workers had been called upon to accept restraint in income<br />
claims Da part of a national strategy of reconstruction end<br />
recovery.<br />
Many doubted that the Accord-based approach then proposed<br />
would prevail because it required unprecedented wage<br />
restraint for a time of expected strong economic growth.<br />
Even a few unionists were hait -l exp'.: s some qualms about<br />
what had been proposed.<br />
But the record shows clearly that the doubters were proved<br />
wrong. JKWI<br />

<p>W~ orkers havo boon prepared to make the necossary sacrifices<br />
In the atticona1 intarest which, of course, theyr rightly<br />
perceive to mean the long-term Interests of all current and<br />
potential vockers.<br />
Those early months in the l. 1fo of this Government were<br />
undoubted251 difficult and uncortain. but the Government<br />
provided h~ o leadership, and the community respor~ ded In a<br />
way which Vroducad such oucceou that our country and our<br />
econom~ ic policy earnod plaudits from all ovar Pho wiorld.<br />
That succoDI3 especially took fora In 650,000 Jobe; economic<br />
growth avorcging 4-5 per cent a seari and until the<br />
depreciation boginning early In 1905, docelerating<br />
inl a i n,<br />
Today wo gain faca difficult oconomic tinesi. But In some<br />
sances tho xosponses required this tie are for m~ ore<br />
fundamentrel. Thiree yoavo ngo there were two dominant atreaza to our<br />
economic r; xolicy. This rem~ ains truae lso today.<br />
One emphaoi1 waa on the traditional taska of macro-aconomic<br />
policy to a. iaago domestic demaund and coats.. The Immediate<br />
taalce wore oim~ ply to kickstart the economy at a tUr~ e of weak<br />
PTI~ atC GC_-orf domand and to haul back inflation.<br />
But just as amportant was the need to redress a numnber of<br />
fundaaentc. 1 iehnoes in the domoutic economy which, If not<br />
corrected, uould haive underainad the zuatain~ billtY Of<br />
rocovory Z1h o longer term.<br />
Those the then imbalackne between wages and profits,<br />
our uncempotativenuss, hivlh inflation and an QXCeosiVM<br />
fiacal deficit.<br />
In all casoo we are now far better p laced,' aG a nction, to<br />
onjoy sustained strong grow'th In josand output, if only we<br />
are prepare2 to take the opportuntbie of today's very<br />
different economic circumstances.<br />
The second omxphasis in 1S-83 was more specifically oriented<br />
bwards the longer term.<br />
The premise of our policy stance then was that Australia had<br />
clearly shown itself to be less flexible, less responsive<br />
and less adaptable in a w orld of rapid change than many of<br />
our regional neighbours.. mlany of our neighbours, had onco<br />
been econocically backward but over many years they hfive<br />
progressively outpointed Australia in world marketo and<br />
. reaped the rouards in fost-lr growth of : ing standards.<br />
Accordingly, the new Labor Govern~ ent laid down a oweeping<br />
agenda for eonomic reform. </p>

in oach cao we have sought to promote innovation and reform<br />
in conseL , ction w~ ith the pairtiez 3ftected.<br />
Three yoazc ago, Includingj to this audience* I spelt out the<br />
high Lp7Lri ; y which thia Gnvernment placod on the creation<br />
of an eZIiclent, highlyj coznptitiva nanufacturing sector.<br />
my meg then was that the sector's increased<br />
compottiAveneca would depand on high levels of investment,<br />
the appl~ cation of nev tachnology to production processes$<br />
and an increasing oxport orientation.<br />
And it ic very pleasing to be able to say that this<br />
Associaion in particular has shown a willingness to address<br />
these isoues sq~ uarely and to adopt positions which recognise<br />
the reolity of the changing international market place.<br />
Trhis~ Asc-ociationls contribution to the recent debate on<br />
these ijtoues has been consistent and constructivo and has<br />
placed2 special emphasis on the need to become outward<br />
looking and competitive.<br />
When I ot with representatives of the MTIA National Task<br />
Force on industry competitiveness on 19 September 194t, I<br />
found the approach of both the Task Torc-and itu Report to<br />
.1he Foaral Government on thQ current e of Australia's<br />
manufacturing industry more refreshing than probably any<br />
meeting I had been involved in with business since coming to.<br />
office. The Taak Forco's work recognises the need for changes within<br />
this indUstry, the need for all sections of the industry to<br />
work together to bring these changes about, and the need to<br />
act now. </p>
<p>4.<br />
The urgon-y wiith which this taS1h needs to be addressed flows<br />
f rom tiko charp deterioration in the prices which we have<br />
been re : cvinq fEor our traditional commoditioc based<br />
exports. At curon' pricos our Lncnn heie been offect~ vely reduped by<br />
$ 6 A ia or<br />
Auotral~ lVa haa boon borrowing cibroad in an attempt to<br />
maintainr Living standardo at levels more consistent with our<br />
prcviDUJ3 2ovoLG of Income.<br />
But wo (,. anot Indefinitely borrow on this scale. The, future<br />
prospoirMty of Australia will dopend on how well we set about<br />
trading our way out of our current difficulties and sustain<br />
our llvarnq stand~ ards from Inicreased effort rather than<br />
incroasQoA borrovings.<br />
Thoro to~ no question that our traditional exporters will<br />
remain fihe doninant varnarc og foxeign exchange for<br />
Auatl~ z or docadag to cc=!.<br />
And, oa? curce, tiia% Ao how it should be. Th* 39 are the<br />
areas enable A~ ustralia to capitalise most on-our<br />
natural cvantngeG of climato and resource endowment.<br />
But theioc is a~ lco no question that there is now both a vital<br />
need arnd , ha coriropionding opportunity for the manufacturing<br />
sector t ploy a very much greater role than La the past.<br />
The siopio fact Is thct the approximately 30 por cent real<br />
dcpreciiut" on of the currency since end 1984 has provided<br />
Austral~ si onufacturers with a once-in-a lifetime<br />
opportunity. And thore Is abundant ovidence that<br />
manufacturers and our curvico sector appreciate that<br />
fact and are m~ oving to take advantage of it.<br />
But what seems less v~ ell understood is that we cannot simply<br />
rely on dopreciation alone.<br />
We 5imply cannot expect to secure those extra markets<br />
permanently without sustained effort.<br />
The window of opportunity oponed up by the depreciation will<br />
close, in time, unless first, we act now to increase<br />
productivity perzzwnently and unl. ess, second, we consistently<br />
achieve wage outcomes lots than or close to. those of our<br />
competitors. The industrial relations system has a critcial role to-play<br />
in both cases.<br />
One of the fascinating featureG of Australian industrial<br />
life ic our abiding fascination with the workings of this<br />
quite complex some say unwieldy machinery.<br />
But what particularly strikes me after some 3 er ls<br />
involvement is how flexible and how adaptabl t system has<br />
proved to be. </p>

accelerate the pace at which the action takes place in<br />
practice. </p>
<p>I acknowledge, too, that canufacturing investment has<br />

Uncorin : r about the indtrial climate is likely to<br />

being ro-cgnised that uncartGiinty Ebout investment<br />
performanca and job security can aloo create uncertainty in<br />
the induGW-rial onvironmant.<br />
There cen be little doubt eaut the benefits of freo and<br />
honest comnmunication botweea all parties on these Issues.<br />
And that asu simply anothos u~ ay og atating ono of the<br />
fundamientn~ l principl os of thto Govarnmentna a proach to<br />
economic Teform, which. is that changes will a Mays be more<br />
readily achieved when tho nood for change 4n4 the<br />
consequonc( es of It aro well undor~ tood.<br />
of course the most direct linkage between business costs and<br />
industrial rolations is wageo setting.<br />
It is a credit to our industrial relations system and the<br />
degree of commitment of its participants to appropriate<br />
outconac that real wages have fallen in the latrt three<br />
years. Zvery other period of comparable economic growth in<br />
recent htctory has been azsociated with significant real<br />
wages iflcroa&amp; 305.<br />
That outcome v~ as deliberately engineered, under the Accord,<br />
in ordeT to lay a firm base for sustained growth in<br />
employment. By end 1S984 the Accord had delivered virtually a halv-ing of<br />
our inflation rate to just over 5 per cent and good<br />
.' prospects for continued moderation, ii" 1. Iie witfi the<br />
downward trend of our trading partners.<br />
The downward movoraent, however, has bean temporarily<br />
arrested becausc of the charp increase in import prices in<br />
the wake of tho depreciation. </p>
<p>Indeed the feed-through of the 10 per cent plus depreciation<br />
of the slddle months of this year will be a major force<br />
operating to keep our inflation rate in terms of the CPI<br />
high for the rest of 1986. This phenonemon was anticipated<br />
at the time of the Budget, which clearly forecasts<br />
moderation of inflation, beginning in 1987.<br />
The e~ sential point, however, is that if we want to preserve<br />
our now fcund competitivenGoG beyond the immediate period<br />
those higher import prices cannot be allowed to flow through<br />
into hichor wcgo coots.<br />
The Government is discussing proposals to this end with both<br />
the ACTU and representatives of business. Those discussions<br />
are still at a preliminary Gtage and many details are still<br />
to be determined.<br />
But therc can be no doubt about one thing. And that iG that<br />
the only changos which will be acceptable to the Government<br />
and to tho community at large will be those which can<br />
deliver apropriotoly restroined wages outcomes without<br />
debilitating industrial conflict.<br />
Again our chancos of success depend critically on the<br />
cooperation and realism of the direct participants and<br />
their mcmberships.<br />
Both parties must recognise the economic realities and<br />
also the valuable role which a constructive approach to<br />
industria. relations can play in satisfying those realities.<br />
Ladies and Gentlemen<br />
Australia faces a very difficult period of adjustment. More<br />
than ever our efforts must focus on improving the capacity<br />
of our traded goods sector, particularly manufacturing.<br />
Your Association has demonstrated its ability to recognise<br />
the changed environment within which we all must operate. I<br />
congratulate you and express the unqualified conviction that<br />
if all Australians and their relevant organisations<br />
demonstrate the same attitude, this country can meet and<br />
overcome the challenges before us. </p>
