The Prime Minister today announced that the Australian Government will provide special legislative protection to control the use of names associated with Mary MacKillop, who will become Australia's first Saint on 17 October 2010.</p>
<p>The decision to grant additional protections reflects the significance of the canonisation of Mary MacKillop for millions of Australians.</p>
<p>The Corporations Regulations 2001 will be amended so that requests for use of a company name, or part thereof, that suggests a connection to Mary MacKillop will be prevented, unless Ministerial approval is granted.</p>
<p>A name need not include the text "Mary MacKillop" to suggest a connection. For example, a name including "Saint MacKillop" would be prohibited. A name including "Our Mary" might be blocked, depending on the circumstances and the rest of the text of the name sought.</p>
<p>This amendment will reduce the extent to which an entity may hold itself to be associated with Mary MacKillop.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister said the new measure would provide the highest level of protection currently provided for any individual Australian's name.</p>
<p>The only other individual Australian's name with similar protection is Sir Donald Bradman.</p>
<p>In addition, existing laws will continue to offer a range of protections against the improper use of Mary MacKillop's name, including the Trade Marks Act 1995, Trade Practices Act 1974, equivalent state laws, and the common law.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister said the new measure was further recognition of the significance that Mary MacKillop's life holds, not only for the five million Australians of Catholic faith, but for all Australians.</p>
<p>The amendment complements the Government's election pledge of $1.5 million to assist in the commemoration of the canonisation, which includes support for a delegation of youth and indigenous representatives attending the canonisation ceremony in Rome, and the inclusion of the Mary MacKillop Canonisation Gift Fund as a specifically listed deductible gift recipient. </p>
