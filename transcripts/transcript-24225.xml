    <content><![CDATA[<p>Madam Speaker</p>
<p>On Indulgence.</p>
<p>All Australians were with the people of Queensland and the Northern Territory over the weekend as they grappled with the impact of two severe cyclones and remain with them as they are cleaning up and recovering from the devastation.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, in recent days, the Minister for Justice, who deals with emergency services, and I have been in close contact with our counterparts.</p>
<p>I was briefed by the Northern Territory Chief Minister, Adam Giles, on the impact of Cyclone Lam in Darwin on Saturday, and I know the Deputy Prime Minister in Rockhampton and elsewhere saw first-hand the impact of Cyclone Marcia yesterday.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, we are thankful there was no loss of life and the fact that there was no loss of life is testimony to the actions of emergency services and precautions that were put in place.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, this is a very trying time for everyone impacted by the cyclones; the people whose homes have been damaged or are without power, the small business owners whose properties and whose businesses have been impacted.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, I can inform the House that there are still roads, in parts of Queensland and northern New South Wales, which are cut.</p>
<p>I want to repeat the advice of emergency management authorities:  if it’s flooded, forget it.</p>
<p>Please don’t cross flooded roads.</p>
<p>I can report, Madam Speaker, that in Queensland, the Army is assisting with the removal of debris and the restoration of critical infrastructure in the Rockhampton region.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, the Commonwealth has activated the Disaster Recovery Payment for the Fitzroy district of Queensland.</p>
<p>This can be claimed through Centrelink – as well Madam Speaker, the Natural Disaster Relief and Recovery Arrangements have been activated by the Commonwealth and Queensland Governments for the Local Government Areas of Livingstone, Rockhampton and Banana.</p>
<p>As members would know, this includes personal hardship and distress assistance for individuals who have been impacted by the cyclone.</p>
<p>Financial assistance, Madam Speaker, is also available for local councils to assist with the costs of responding to Cyclone Marcia, including the costs of restoring essential public assets.</p>
<p>Similarly Madam Speaker, the Natural Disaster Relief and Recovery Arrangements have been activated with the Northern Territory for the local government areas of East Arnhem and West Arnhem, as well as in Queensland.</p>
<p>This includes personal hardship and distress assistance for impacted individuals.</p>
<p>As well as in Queensland, that also includes financial assistance for the relevant councils.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, as always in these circumstances, volunteers and community organisations have been hard at work.</p>
<p>Since the dawn of our history, our summers have been difficult and dangerous and it turns out Madam Speaker that this summer is no exception.</p>
<p>As always Madam Speaker, the Commonwealth stands ready to assist Australians in their hour of need.</p>
