FOR MEDIA -THURSDAY, FEBRUARlY 118 .1982<br />
" HELP POLAND LIVE" APPEAL<br />
The Government has decided to give tangible support to the<br />
generosity of the Australian community by making donations<br />
to the national " Help Poland Live" Appeal during the current<br />
financial year tax deductible. This supplements the Government's<br />
decision late last year to make a cash grant of one million<br />
dollars to the appeal.<br />
The appeal is organised by the Australian National Committee for<br />
Relief to Poland, chaired by Mr Frank Galbally, CBE, and with<br />
a membership representing different political persuasions,<br />
religious commitments and walks of life. It is a national<br />
appeal and I am honoured to be its patron.<br />
The appeal organisers advise that the appeal is attracting<br />
generous public support from the people of Australia.<br />
Through our Embassy in Warsaw, and with the assistance of the<br />
Polish Catholic Church authorities, the Government has sought<br />
to monitor the flow of Australian aid and to ensure that such aid<br />
is reaching the people who need it most. The Government is well<br />
satisfied with the assurances it has received in that regard from<br />
the Polish Catholic Church authorities, who are responsible<br />
for distributing the aid raised by this campaign.<br />
Australian private humanitarian aid, of which the " Help<br />
Poland Live" Appeal is a particularly important vehicle, is<br />
making an important contribution to the overall international<br />
relief effort.<br />
This internat~ ional relief effort aimed at alleviating the<br />
hardships of the Polish people is an important element in the<br />
overall Western position on the Polish crisis which was<br />
precipitated by the Polish authorities' declaration of martial.<br />
law last December. The Australian Government is maintaining<br />
strong measuces complementary to the measures of the United States<br />
and other Western allies, aimed at helping to bring about an end<br />
to martial law, the release of politicial detainees, and a<br />
resumption oE the process of political dialogue in Poland,<br />
based on consensus and restraint. </p>
