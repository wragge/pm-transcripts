11I March 1997 TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
THE HON. JOHN HOWARD MP<br />
DOORSTOP INTERVIEW, CARDINIA SHIRE COUNCIIL, PAKENHAM<br />
VICTORIA<br />
E OE Ladies and gentlemen, at this, the first of our Cabinet meetings in outer metropolitan or<br />
regional Australia, we've taken some very important decisions about the shape of the<br />
work for the dole scheme. I can announce that the legislation to change the Social<br />
Security Act to enable the Department of Social Security to require people to do work in<br />
return for the dole, that that legislation will be introduced into Federal Parliament on 18th<br />
March. We will be seeking a speedy passage of the legislation. It is in the national<br />
interest that the legislation goes through quickly. We want the pilot schemes beginning in<br />
September of this year. We plan to have 10 000 young Australians initially between the<br />
ages of 18 and 24 involved in work for the dole schemes, the pilot schemes over a period<br />
of 12 months.<br />
I can inform you that we have already had great expressions of interest. Dr Kemp and his<br />
staff have had presentations in committee rooms in Parliament House from community<br />
groups of proposed work for the dole schemes. So the legislation will be introduced when<br />
Parliament goes back next week on 18th March and we will be asking the Parliament to<br />
pass that legislation this session and it's in the national interest that it go through. The<br />
public supports the work for the dole proposal. We will have ten thousand people<br />
involved in the pilot. It's a fair scheme. They will be paid award rates of pay strictly in<br />
accordance with the principle I enunciated a few weeks ago. This will be a valuable<br />
supplement to the armory of policies the Government has developed to deal with the<br />
problem of youth unemployment. </p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, Dr Kemp, who is the expert on the work for the dole scheme and<br />
of course has Ministerial responsibility is with me and he will help me if the questions you<br />
ask me are too complicated but we had a very important discussion. The details are very<br />
well advanced and I am personally very anxious and all members of the Government are<br />
very anxious to have it up and running as soon as possible and we hope the Parliament will<br />
pass the legislation, no mucking around, no messing about, sending it to committees. Let<br />
it go through this session. A very simple change to the Social Security Act so that if<br />
people are required to do something in return for the dole they can be. The law precludes<br />
that at the present time. We've obviously got to change that in order to give us the option<br />
of having an element of compulsion so far as the work for the dole scheme is concerned.<br />
JRNLST: Are there any capital injections coming to this local community to carry out the projects?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
No, that's not intended. We estimate that the total cost of the scheme will be about<br />
million and we've already had a large number of proposals put forward involving that but<br />
there is no capital injection associated with the scheme but of course proposals may relate<br />
to other schemes in some way which involve the injection of funds.<br />
JRNLST: Can you tell us how many hours the people would be required to work and some more of<br />
the details of the scheme?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
On average, two days of six hours a day. On average, two days at six hours a day.<br />
JRNLST: And it would be compulsory?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well it will be compulsory in certain cases, yes. We've made it very clear that we are<br />
going to change the law to enable compulsion. Some of the schemes will be based upon<br />
purely voluntary participation. Others will be based upon a mixture of volunteers and<br />
some people being required. Others might be fuly compulsory but I've made it clear from<br />
the outset that we always were reserving the right to require people to do it. Now in<br />
many cases that won't be necessary because I think local conditions and the attraction of<br />
the scheme and the value it will bring to the young people will be such that that will not be<br />
necessary. But I have never disguised the fact that we want to amend the law so that </p>
<p>people can be required to do something in return. I mean, this is based upon the principle<br />
of mutual obligation. Society has a mutual obligation built into its ethic. We look after<br />
people who need help and who can't get a job and in return it's not unreasonable to ask of<br />
those people who can't get a job that they do something in return for that help and<br />
provided that is on reasonable awards rates of pay, which it will be, and provided the<br />
schemes have a community base and they don't involve the replacement of private sector<br />
jobs, which they won't, that's an entirely sound principle, the principle of mutual<br />
obligation and it's a principle I will argue and defend in any circumstances anywhere in<br />
this country and I think it's a principle that the Australian community will very strongly<br />
support.<br />
JRNLST: Can you envisage extending the programme beyond ten thousand young people?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well these are, the ten thousand is in the pilots and if it works very well, the answer is yes,<br />
we will extend it but it depends on how well it works. I have to stress that these are pilot<br />
schemes that we have in mind, about 50 70 pilot schemes focussing initially on areas, in<br />
areas that have the highest concentration of unemployed people. We will give priority for<br />
participation in the schemes, for people who have been out of work for more than 6<br />
months and the question of whether we extend it will be governed very much by how the<br />
pilots go.<br />
JRNLST: What about to older people?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well at this stage we're focussing on the 18 24 group.<br />
JRNLST: How will you determine which of these projects are compulsory or which of them will be<br />
( inaudible)<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well it would depend upon the character of the tender. We will be inviting people when<br />
they put forward projects to express a view about whether it should be compulsory or<br />
voluntary or a mixture and of course, the selection process, and we will be adopting a<br />
competitive approach. We will be inviting groups to compete against each other insofar as<br />
the proposals are concerned and that decision will be made according to the circumstances </p>
<p>of the proposal. The assessment made by the panel that makes the decision of the needs,<br />
the locality and the profile of the unemployed in that particular area.<br />
JRNLST: And Prime Minister would you expect these projects to have a trickle down effect on<br />
youth unemployment?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Look I would expect that these projects will have a lot of benefits. They will give the<br />
young people involved a greater sense of self esteem. They will undoubtedly improve<br />
their work skills. They will fulfil the desire of the community to see a mutual obligation<br />
principle applied in relation to benefits in this area. But overall, I think they will help to<br />
break the cycle of despair and despondency and dependency that so many young people<br />
feel in relation to unemployment. That is why my overwhelming experience since this<br />
announcement was made has been one of great support from young people for the<br />
proposal. JRNLST: Over time you wouldn't expect to see an ( inaudible) decline in youth unemployment..<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
This is not designed to manipulate the unemployment figures. It is designed to help young<br />
people. It is designed to involve the community in challenging a great national problem.<br />
If it does have the trickle down effect that you describe, well that is an additional benefit<br />
but I assure you the purpose of the thing is not to manipulate the figures, it is to help the<br />
young people. And could I just note in passing, on the employment front that the ANZ<br />
Job Index today showed a further improvement and it's the third month in the last four<br />
that the ANZ Job Index has reacted in a very positive fashion and I gather a spokesman<br />
for the ANZ not noted for buoyant statements in this area has said the figures aren't too<br />
bad. Thank you, I think we ought to go to lunch.<br />
JRNLST: The Business Council of Australia has joined South Australia and New South Wales in<br />
criticising as unconstitutional the 15% superannuation surcharge. Are you facing another<br />
half a billion dollar blowout in your budget deficit? </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:<br />
No. JRNLST: But if the opinion from Rose QC which, as they have, indicates that this is<br />
unconstitutional, what are you going to do to get that..<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I can tell you that all the advice we have is that the measure is quite constitutional and in<br />
any event I haven't had it suggested from any quarters up until now that the<br />
unconstitutionality relates other than to its application to certain state judges and certain<br />
state officials. Look, there's a very simple principle involved in this. We brought down a<br />
budget that shared the difficulty around and we are now hearing from state premiers that<br />
you should have a budget that is watered down by removing some imposts that reduce the<br />
concessionality of taxation for very high income earners in the community. I mean, what<br />
sort of Australian sense of fair play and justice is that? Are you having the Premiers<br />
saying that it's all right to knock the not so well off in the community but when you talk<br />
about imposing any kind of surcharge that reduces an already high rate of concessionality<br />
that we've got to stop that. I don't think they will seriously maintain it but can I just make<br />
it clear, we are not backing down on the superannuation surcharge. It's a fair measure,<br />
it's a good measure. It added to the balance and the social justice of the first Coalition<br />
budget and we have no intention of backing down, no intention at all.<br />
ends </p>
