' 4,<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR PRESS 8 MARCH, 1979<br />
INTERNATIONAL WOMEN'S DAY<br />
The Prime Minister today announced two grants to mark<br />
the Government's recognition of International Women's Day.<br />
The Government is to provide $ 22,635 to a National Women's<br />
Advisory Council research programme on women at home.<br />
The programme will be carried out by the Women's Research Group<br />
of the Knox Community Relations Centre. It will examine the<br />
economic, social and physical situation of women in the<br />
home and their perception of their role.<br />
As well, the Prime Minister said that the Government had decided<br />
to give financial support to the Working Women's Centre in Melbourne.<br />
The Centre is sponsored by the Australian Council of Salaried<br />
and Professional Associations and receives support from a<br />
number of other trade unions. It aims to raise consciousness<br />
within the trade unions of the needs of women members.<br />
A grant-in-aid of $ 25,000 a year for the next three years<br />
is being considered.<br />
$ 12,500 has been provided for the remainder of this financial year.<br />
The Prime Minister said he hoped the Government's initiatives<br />
would lead to a better understanding of the contribution of<br />
women to Australian society. 000---</p>
