    <content><![CDATA[<p><strong>LUKE SIMPKINS:</strong> Can I just start by thanking the Prime Minister for coming here to Cowan and to Landsdale Primary School. We’ve had a great visit today. Very interesting to see the coding the great innovation of Principal Leanne White, the staff, the students here at [inaudible] and it’s very emblematic of exactly the direction that we would like the country [inaudible].</p>
<p>Thanks very much again, Prime Minister for coming to Cowan.</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER: </strong>Thank you very much and it’s obviously never been a more exciting time than to be at school here today. The enthusiasm and the imagination of the kids doing their coding, working with computers, demystifying machine languages, it’s very exciting. There’s $84 million in our Innovation package that is going to promote STEM and coding in schools. It’s a very important part of our Innovation agenda. A lot of it is to do – as you know – with investment, a lot of it is to do with the CSIRO, but right here, these young boys and girls they are the inventors, the creators, the scientists, the investors, the managers of the industries of the future, the businesses of the future. What they’re learning today, the technology skills they’re learning, the coding skills, the imagination that is being unleashed, that’s being encouraged by those very inspiring teachers, what all that’s doing is laying the foundations for greater success and stronger prosperity, more secure and prosperous Australia in the years ahead. I know Karen, who’s the Assistant Minister for Science, you’re very impressed with what they were doing, weren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR SCIENCE: </strong>Absolutely! Some of those kids had only been coding for two terms at school and what they were able to achieve was just outstanding – and they are our future.</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER: </strong>And you are a good example of a role model, of a woman who’s an engineer and now leading the charge science in the Government.</p>
<p><strong>ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR SCIENCE: </strong>Absolutely – I learnt programming myself back in my university days and I’ve already been online for the hour code and started coding away myself, so it’s great.</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER: </strong>This is very important because one of the challenges that we face which we’re seeking to address in the Innovation and Science Agenda is that not enough women – girls – at school level and women at university level are undertaking STEM subjects – science, technology, engineering and maths. In fact, the percentage of girls doing maths for the High School Certificate has actually declined in recent years. So, Karen and the teachers that you’ve just seen are very important role models for girls and young women to take up these subjects and pursue them through their careers.</p>
<p><strong>JOURNALIST: </strong>Colin Barnett says WA’s being ripped off by an unfair carve up to the GST. Now, is that a fair summation?</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER: </strong>Well, it is certainly not a new summation. I seem to have heard him say that before. But, this is a, I will be seeing Colin later today, and the issue of the GST is always a big one in Western Australia, as you know, there was a, if you like, a compensating payment, was made recently. We understand the consequences of the mining boom that obviously brought very big mining royalties to Western Australia, had to, because of the formula, an impact on its share of the GST. But, I look forward to discussing that with Colin today and of course with the other premiers on Friday.</p>
<p><strong>JOURNALIST: </strong>PM, can I ask you about Tony Abbott's comments please?</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER: </strong>Hang on, just one second.</p>
<p><strong>JOURNALIST: </strong>Do you think Islam needs a Reformation?</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER: </strong>That is a big question. To say this: there is a very serious threat to the world, to all of us from terrorism. From extreme, extremist violence, violent extremism. And this is coming through elements of the Muslim world. There is no doubt about that. We understand that. Is often called Islamist extremism. Now, the vast majority of Muslims, with a they are in Australia or anywhere else I was as appalled by this type of terrorism as we are. And, it is absolutely vital to ensure that we don't make the mistake, which is what the terrorists want us to do, of tagging every single Muslim with the responsibility for the crimes of a few. And, I just point to the great leadership that has been shown by many Muslim leaders around the world and no better here in Western Australia than to point the President of Indonesia, Joko Widodo, who has deplored this type of extremism. Has said it is a defamation of Islam, it is a blasphemy. And he has reminded everybody that Indonesia itself, the largest Muslim country in the world, has demonstrated that Islam is compatible with democracy and an open, tolerant society.</p>
<p><strong>JOURNALIST: </strong>What is your advice from officials about any concerns over tone and language, of the statements being made by [Inaudible]?</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER: </strong>You are asking me about Tony Abbott or?</p>
<p><strong>JOURNALIST: </strong>I am asking you if statements that put a blanket term over Muslims, have you received advice over such statements, the language that Tony… [Inaudible]</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER: </strong>Can I tell you, everything I say, on this subject, is carefully calculated in the light of the advice I receive from the Australian Federal Police and from ASIO. Everything I say on this subject is aimed to make Australia safer and to make the work of our security services, who I believe, are the best in the world, to make that work less difficult, than it already is. It is a challenging environment in which I operate. Everything I say is designed to help them and help them keep us safe. Now, that's enough on Mr Abbott.</p>
<p><strong>JOURNALIST: </strong>You could make it clear, by actually saying whether you agree that Islam needs a revolution.</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER: </strong>Look these one-liners, with all due respect, are not really susceptible to an ad-lib answer. Let me quite clear, everybody knows it is no revelation that there are elements in the Muslim world, extremist elements, violent extremist elements that are doing enormous damage to Muslims and to non-Muslims alike. Most of the victims of ISIL or Daesh, whatever you want to call it, are other Muslims. Let’s be quite clear. So there is, within the Muslim world, a sense of outrage at this extremism. Of course there is. As I said the vast majority of the world’s Muslims or Australia’s Muslims for that matter, are as appalled by this extremism, as all of us are. I think we need to be very careful about that. Our best allies in the battle against terrorism are the Muslim community and it is absolutely critical that we maintain solidarity and unity within Australia. What do the terrorists want us to do?  What do they want? They want us to be scared. They want us to really frightened; they want us to abandon our way of life. They want us to abandon our values of freedom, tolerance and openness. They want us to abandon those, and they want us to turn on the Muslim community in Australia, and indeed in every other country. That is their objective. So we should not do anything that plays into their hands. As I have just said to you, every single word I have said to you, is said in the knowledge of the very best and latest advice I have from the Director General of ASIO and the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police.<br />
 <strong>QUESTION: </strong>Do you think Tony Abbott’s comments play into their hands then?<br />
 <strong>PRIME MINISTER: </strong>Look I am not going to run a commentary on Mr Abbott’s comments or anybody else. You have asked me for my views and I have given them to you.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>[inaudible]… freight link, it has been a huge…<br />
 <strong>PRIME MINISTER: </strong>I am so pleased that we’ve got back to local issues.<br />
 <strong>QUESTION: </strong>It’s been a big local issue.<br />
 <strong>PRIME MINISTER: </strong>I understand that.<br />
 <strong>QUESTION: </strong>You’re Government has committed $925 million for the whole project. Mr Barnett is still in for stage two. Would you consider taking that money and committing it to rail if the WA Government doesn't want to proceed with stage two?<br />
 <strong>PRIME MINISTER: </strong>That hasn't even been proposed or considered. The Australian Government's view, our Government's view is that the project should proceed. We understand that was still the view of the West Australian Government. I look forward to discussing it further with Colin today. As you know, we've made a very substantial commitment, nearly a billion dollars, and we look forward to the project being completed as quickly as possible. I think it's important for Perth, it is important for Western Australia. Now on that note, thank you very much and good to see you. Weren't those kids great!</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Ends</strong></p>
