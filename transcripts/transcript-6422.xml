EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERED<br />
SPEECH TO THE BULLETIN-NEWSWEEK LUNCHEON 4 JULY 1984<br />
IT IS A HAPPY COINCIDENCE AND I AM SURE A HAPPY OMEN<br />
FOR SUCCESS THAT THIS FIRST ISSUE OF THE COMBINED<br />
BULLETIN-NEWSWEEK SHOULD FALL ON THE FOURTH OF JULY<br />
INDEPENDENCE DAY.<br />
SO, FIRST LET ME SAY TO OUR FRIENDS FROM NEW YORK,<br />
REPRESENTING THE AMERICAN HALF OF THIS VENTURE, THAT YOUR<br />
PARTICIPATION IS ENTIRELY COMPATIBLE WITH THE SPIRIT OF<br />
INDEPENDENCE WHICH THIS DAY CELEBRATES NOT FOR AMERICANS<br />
ALONE, BUT FOR ALL THOSE WHO CHERISH DEMOCRACY EVERYWHERE<br />
AROUND THE WORLD,<br />
FOR, AS I UNDERSTAND IT, THIS UNIQUE VENTURE IN AUSTRALIAN<br />
PUBLISHING IS NEITHER A MERGER NOR A TAKEOVER; BUT AN<br />
ALLIANCE OF TWO INDEPENDENT FORCES TO COMPLEMENT THE<br />
STRENGTHS OF EACH; AND BY THIS DECLARATION OF INTERDEPENDENCE,<br />
THE BETTER TO MAINTAIN AND ENSURE THE INDEPENDENCE OF BOTH.<br />
AND THAT IS THE SORT OF ALLIANCE, WHERE AUSTRALIAN AND<br />
AMERICAN INTERESTS ARE INVOLVED, THAT I CAN ALWAYS ENDORSE<br />
AND SUPPORT. w--K<br />
CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY </p>
<p>2<br />
THERE WAS, I MUST SAY, ONE ASPECT OF TREVOR KENNEDY'S<br />
LETTER OF INVITATION WHICH RAISED A DOUBT, IF NOT<br />
APPREHENSION, IN MY MIND.<br />
BECAUSE, AFTER OUTLINING THE COURSE THESE PROCEEDINGS TODAY<br />
MIGHT TAKE AND WHAT WAS EXPECTED OF ME, . TREVOR WROTE:<br />
" PHILIP ADAMS WILL WIND THE WHOLE THING UP."!<br />
NOW, IF EVER I SENSED A SET-UP, THAT IS IT.<br />
BUT I SUPPOSE AT LEAST WHEN PHILIP WINDS THE WHOLE THING<br />
UP, IT WILL HELP OUR AMERICAN FRIENDS UNDERSTAND WHAT<br />
THEY'RE REALLY GETTING INTO.<br />
BECAUSE PHILIP, AMONG OTHER THINGS, REPRESENTS ONE OF<br />
THE GREAT STRANDS OF THE BULLETIN TRADITION ICONOCLASTIC,<br />
RADICAL REPUBLICANISM.<br />
THAT'S THE OLDEST BULLETIN TRADITION; AND IT'S SOMEHOW<br />
MANAGED TO SURVIVE SOMETIMES SO FAINTLY AS TO BE ON THE<br />
VERGE OF EXTINCTION FOR OVER ONE HUNDRED YEARS.<br />
AND OF COURSE WHEN WE'RE SPEAKING OF THE BULLETIN'S<br />
RADICAL TRADITION, WE CAN'T IGNORE THE OUTSTANDING<br />
CONTRIBUTION OF ONE OF ITS LEADING WRITERS. s / 3 </p>
<p>-3-<br />
I MEAN, OF COURSE, DAVID MCNICOL.<br />
How COULD IT EVER BE SAID OF AUSTRALIA, TO ADAPT OSCAR WILDE<br />
ON THE UNITED STATES, THAT WE HAVE NO OLD INSTITUTIONS AND<br />
NO ANCIENT MONUMENTS, WHEN WE HAVE THE BULLETIN AND<br />
DAVID McNICOLI<br />
BUT SERIOUSLY, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, FOR ALL THE VAST<br />
CHANGES IN ITS STYLE, OUTLOOK, POLITICS AND OWNERSHIP,<br />
THE BULLETIN 1U AN INSTITUTION; AND IT IS AN AUTHENTIC<br />
AUSTRALIAN INSTITUTION.<br />
AUSTRALIAN NATIONALISM, THE AUSTRALIAN ETHOS OF THE MATESHIP<br />
OF THE BUSH, A DISTINCTIVELY AUSTRALIAN L. ITERATURE, THE<br />
AUSTRALIAN BRAND OF HUMOUR ALL GREW TOGETHER WITH THE<br />
BULLETIN AND THE BULLETIN'S CONTRIBUTION TO EACH,<br />
EXPECIALLY IN ITS FIRST THREE DECADES FROM 1880, WAS<br />
SEMINALLY AND ENDURINGLY IMPORTANT.<br />
AND IT IS NO COINCIDENCE THAT DURING THIS GREAT FLOWERING<br />
OF THE AUSTRALIAN SPIRIT, THE ORGANISED LABOUR MOVEMENT<br />
TOOK DEEP ROOT IN OUR NATIONAL LIFE AND THE AUSTRALIAN<br />
LABOR PARTY ITSELF WAS BORN.<br />
THE BULLETIN CELEBRATED ITS CENTENARY FOUR YEARS AGO;<br />
AND THE AUSTRALIAN LABOR PARTY WILL CELEBRATE ITS FIRST<br />
CENTURY OF UNBROKEN FORMAL EXISTENCE IN 1991 LESS<br />
THAN SEVEN YEARS AWAY. </p>
<p>4<br />
SAND THESE SIMPLE FACTS SERVE TO REMIND US OF A MOST<br />
SIGNIFICANT, BUT OFTEN IGNORED, ASPECT OF AUSTRALIAN<br />
NATIONAL LIFE.<br />
AND THAT IS, THE REMARKABLE STABILITY AND CONTINUITY OF<br />
MANY OF OUR KEY INSTITUTIONS.<br />
AND THAT IS ESPECIALLY TRUE IN POLITICS AND JOURNALISM,<br />
THE AUSTRALIAN LABOR. PARTY ITSELF IS NOT ONLY FAR AND<br />
AWAY AUSTRALIA'S OLDEST POLITICAL PARTY; IT IS ONE OF<br />
THE VERY OLDEST IN THE WORLD; AND IN THE ENGLISH-SPEAKING<br />
WORLD, OF THEPARTIES WHICH REGULARLY FORM GOVERNMENTS,<br />
WE ARE OUTRANKED ONLY BY THE DEMOCRATIC AND REPUBLICAN<br />
PARTIES OF THE UNITED STATES AND THE BRITISH CONSERVATIVE<br />
PARTY. IN JOURNALISM, THE RECORD ON CONTINUITY IS JUST AS<br />
REMARKABLE. FOR EXAMPLE, SEVEN OF THE TEN MORNING DAILIES NOW PUBLISHED<br />
IN THE SIX STATE CAPITALS WERE ESTABLISHED BEFORE THE END<br />
OF THE LAST CENTURY THAT IS, BEFORE THE AUSTRALIAN<br />
FEDERATION ITSELF. </p>
<p>AND AS I HAVE SAID, THE BULLETIN FALLS WELL INTO THIS<br />
CATEGORY, AS FAR AS VENERABILITY IS CONCERNED.<br />
Now, THROUGH THIS UNIQUE VENTURE, ANOTHER CHAPTER<br />
IS BEING WRITTEN IN ITS LONG HISTORY.<br />
IT IS TRUE THAT IN THIS UNDERTAKING, THERE IS NO<br />
QUESTION THAT EACH PUBLICATION WILL RETAIN ITS<br />
SEPARATE IDENTITY.<br />
HOWEVER, THERE WILL INEVITABLY BE AN INFLUENCE OF<br />
EACH PAPER UPON THE OTHER.<br />
AND IT WILL BE A REAL CHALLENGE FOR THE STAFF AND<br />
MANAGEMENT OF BOTH TO ENSURE THAT THAT INFLUENCE AND THE<br />
CHANGES IT WILL BRING ABOUT, WORK FOR THE MAXIMUM BENEFIT<br />
OF THE READERS THEY NOW SHARE IN COMMON.<br />
FOR EXAMPLE, IT WOULD BE UNFORTUNATE IT WOULD I<br />
BELIEVE, BE A RETROGRADE STEP IF THE BULLETIN WERE TO<br />
ABANDON ITS OWN OVERSEAS COVERAGE OR TO CEASE TO<br />
INTERPRET NEWS AND EVENTS OVERSEAS FROM THE AUSTRALIAN<br />
POINT OF VIEW.<br />
ON THE OTHER HAND, WE SHOULD HOPE TO SEE, ON THE NEWSWEEK<br />
SIDE, AN EXPANSION AND INDEED A BIAS OF ITS COVERAGE<br />
OF NEWS AND EVENTS IN THE ASIAN AND PACIFIC REGION THIS<br />
GREAT AND GROWING REGION TO WHICH AUSTRALIA BELONGS. / 6<br />
M.. ls. rlr. -yq, u . Hl Â® r </p>
<p>-6-<br />
AND FROM THAT EXPANDED COVERAGE IN THE AUSTRALIAN EDITION<br />
OF NEWSWEEK, WE CAN HOPE TO SEE ULTIMATELY AN EXPANDED<br />
COVERAGE OF AUSTRALIA AND ITS REGION IN THE NORTH AMERICAN<br />
EDITION OF NEWSWEEK ITSELF.<br />
IF THOSE THINGS HAPPEN IN THE BULLETIN AND IN NEWSWEEK<br />
THEN THIS VENTURE WILL SERVE A VALUABLE PURPOSE, NOT<br />
ONLY FOR THE READERS, BUT FOR BOTH OUR COUNTRIES.<br />
INDEED THIS MERGER REPRESENTS A SIGNIFICANT RECOGNITION<br />
BOTH OF AUSTRALIA'S OWN ROLE IN REGIONAL AND WORLD AFFAIRS<br />
AND OF THE INCREASED INTEREST OF THE AUSTRALIAN COMMUNITY<br />
IN SUCH DEVELOPMENTS.<br />
WE HAVE TO BE REALISTIC ABOUT THE CONTRIBUTION WHICH<br />
AUSTRALIA CAN MAKE TO FOSTERING THE OBJECTIVES OF REGIONAL<br />
AND INTERNATIONAL PEACE AND STABILITY. BUT THERE ARE<br />
CLEAR OBLIGATIONS UPON US TO ACCEPT THE RESPONSIBILITIES<br />
ASSOCIATED WITH THE PURSUIT OF THESE OBJECI'VES.<br />
AUSTRALIA MUST MAINTAIN A COHERENT, CREDIBLE AND REALISTIC<br />
FOREIGN POLICY, AN APPROACH TO FOREIGN RELATIONS WHICH IS<br />
AT ONCE PRINCIPLED AND SENSITIVE, FLEXIBLE AND RESPONSIVE,<br />
AND ADEQUATE TO THE DEMANDS OF THE COMPLEX AND FASTCHANGING<br />
WORLD AROUND US. CLEARLY SUCH A POLICY MUST BE<br />
KEENLY MINDFUL OF THE EFFECT ANY DECISION OR SET OF<br />
DECISIONS MAY HAVE ON THE BROADER FOREIGN POLICY<br />
OBJECTIVES TO WHICH HAVE ALLUDEDg/. m7 </p>
<p>-7-<br />
THE MATURITY REQUIRED IN THE CONDUCT OF OUR FOREIGN<br />
RELATIONS REQUIRES AN INCREASINGLY SOPHISTICATED PUBLIC,<br />
AND THIS WILL, I BELIEVE, BE FURTHER NURTURED BY THE<br />
PRODUCT RESULTING FROM THE MERGER OF THE BULLETIN AND<br />
NEWSWEEK. THIS IN ITSELF INCREASES THE RESPONSIBILITIES<br />
UPON YOU AS INDEED IS THE CASE FOR THE AUSTRALIAN MEDIA<br />
MORE GENERALLY.<br />
FRIENDS, BEARING IN MIND THE NATURE AND PURPOSE OF THIS<br />
OCCASION, AND THE AUSPICIOUS DAY ON WHICH IT TAKES PLACE,<br />
IT MAY NOT BE INAPPROPRIATE IF I CONCLUDE BY QUOTING<br />
SOMETHING I SAID TO THE NATIONAL PRESS CLUB IN WASHINGTON<br />
JUST OVER A YEAR AGO.<br />
I WAS SPEAKING OF THE RELATIONS BETWEEN THE NATIONS BUT<br />
IT IS NOT WITHOUT RELEVANCE TO THE NOBLE PROFESSION OF<br />
JOURNALISM IN THE WORLD TODAY. I SAID:<br />
" HOWEVER JEALOUSLY EACH OF US MAY GUARD OUR<br />
NATIONAL INDEPENDENCE, WE MUST EQUALLY<br />
RECOGNISE OUR INTERNATIONAL INTERDEPENDENCE.<br />
AND ULTIMATELY, WE HAVE TO RECOGNISE,<br />
HOWEVER DIFFICULT IT MAY BE, EVEN HOWEVER<br />
UNPALATABLE IT MAY BE WE HAVE TO RECOGNISE<br />
THAT INTERDEPENDENCE IS GLOBAL AND UNIVERSAL$ / 8 </p>
<p>AT STAKE, IN THE RECOGNITION AND ACCEPTANCE<br />
OF THAT FUNDAMENTAL FACT, IS NOTHING LESS<br />
THAN THE SURVIVAL OF CIVILISATION ITSELF,<br />
THIS WILL BE THE GUIDING PRINCIPLE FOR THE<br />
GOVERNMENT OF AUSTRALIA: THE INTERDEPENDENCE<br />
OF THE NATIONS OF OUR REGION; OUR INTERDEPENDENCE<br />
WITH THE GREAT DEMOCRACIES; BUT ULTIMATELY, AND<br />
SINESCAPABLY, THE INTERDEPENDENCE OF US ALL<br />
ALL NATIONS, ALL PEOPLE IN THE STARK CHOICE<br />
BEFORE US ALL A CHOICE NEVER BEFORE FACED BY<br />
iHUMANITY THE CHOICE BETWEEN SURVIVAL OR EXTINCTION."<br />
MY FRIENDS, THE PRESS OF OUR TWO GREAT DEMOCRACIES SHARES<br />
A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN MEETING THIS ULTIMATE CHALLENGE FOR<br />
HUMAN REASON AND HUMAN UNDERSTANDING,<br />
AND IN EQUIPPING THESE TWO'IMPORTANT JOURNALS BETTER FOR THE<br />
PART THEY CAN PLAY IN THAT TASK, THIS VENTURE IS WELCOME.<br />
I CONGRATULATE YOU UPON IT, AND WISH YOU EVERY SUCCESS.<br />
