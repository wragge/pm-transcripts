VISIT OF PRESIDENT SOrEHARTO<br />
OFFICIAL LUNCHEON, PARLIAMENT HOUSE, CANBERRA<br />
Speech~ by the Prime Minister, Mr William McMahon<br />
7 FEBRUARY 1972<br />
Mr d aaeSoeharto, Presiding Officers, my<br />
Minist-rñ and Parliamentary Colleagues, Members of the<br />
Diplomatic Corps and Distinguished Guests:<br />
Today, Mr President, we welcome you to Australia and<br />
we do so with warmth and with sincerity, not only because you<br />
have chosen to come here, but because you are the represk: ntative<br />
of 130 million Indonesians, and our nearest ncighbours, and<br />
people for whom we have the greatest friendship and the greatest<br />
goodwill. Now, Sir, this afternoon I want to speak from three<br />
different points of view about your visit to Australia today and<br />
the few days that are in front of us.<br />
First of all, I want to speak to you about the leader<br />
Of Your country and yourself as a man. Then about our international<br />
relationships, the relationships between two great countries, and<br />
then the purposes of your visit here now, and in the days to come.<br />
First of all then, as to you as a man. I know you<br />
won't mind my saying that you were born to a farming family just<br />
outside Jogjakarta, and if fate hadn't inte -oned, or if history<br />
had moved along its normal course, then I haven't the slightest<br />
doubt in the world that by now you would have been the head of<br />
the Country Party of Indonesia, with probably a deep and permanent<br />
influence on the mind and activities of my own Deputy Prime<br />
Minister. But fortunateily for the world, fortunately for us<br />
and fortunately for Indonesia, you decided at a favirly early<br />
age that you would enter the Army at the time of the Dutch<br />
administration. And from then on in successive movements, you went to<br />
the leadership of the Arrmy and in a way that I would like to<br />
stress at this moment. Not only did you move through the<br />
brigades and the divisions, but at añ very critical time in the<br />
history of Indonesia, you became the Supreme-mmander of<br />
Operational Command. And then later on, you went to a more<br />
significant post and that was to the leadership of the Strategic<br />
Command of your own country.<br />
And again, I believe on this occasion that Providence<br />
intervened and placed you in a deci4sive position and one in which<br />
you were able to exercise your power and influence on the future<br />
in a way that no other person in the history of Indonesia had been<br />
able to do. And, Sir, because of those two actions your decision<br />
to enter the Army, your progress to the supreme leadership, you<br />
were, I think, and in fact did, make the decision that saved<br />
Indonesia and I think has brought peace, order and goodwill to<br />
your own country. / 2 </p>
<p>2--<br />
And, Sir, I think I should emphasise that in each of<br />
the posts that you have filled you have been in a position where<br />
you could exert influence of a different kind as well, because<br />
You did take part at the end of the Japanese Occupation. Later<br />
on took piart in the decisions relating to the independence of<br />
your own country. And then at the crucial moment, at the time<br />
of the attempted takeover of Indonesia by elements that were<br />
foreign to the wishes of ftie people of Indonesia, you took control<br />
and you have accomplished in a brief space of time what few other<br />
men would be capable of achieving.<br />
Sir, vno ur talks to me this morning, you used the<br />
phrase, or if it wasn't you, it was your interpreter viho used the<br />
phrase " a new order". You were, I believe, and I know, not<br />
only the architect bu1t the administrator of this programme.<br />
And what has it brought to Indonesia?<br />
Firs-t, I hl~ ave to go back again if I can to your history<br />
as a farmer, because as you well pointed out to me this morning,<br />
that not only do you look at Indonesia from the point of its<br />
international politics and its -,-fence ministry, but you give<br />
primary place in all your thinking to the social welfare and<br />
social justice within Indonesia itself.<br />
And, Sir, you have given emphasis to matters that<br />
Perhaps other people could easily have forgotten. You have<br />
stressed the necessity for the average man, woman and child in<br />
your own country to have the basic necessities of life whetheF<br />
it might be food, whether it might be clothing, whether it might<br />
be shelter. And, Sir, I was glad to hear you say this morning<br />
that these will remain your primary objectives during the time<br />
that you remain the President of your great country.<br />
So~, Sir, we compliment you not only for what you have<br />
done, but the idealism you have brought to this very difficult<br />
ta of yours. Then, Sir, if I look at the changes that have occurred<br />
in the period of the new order, few of us could have thought<br />
that in a period of what is but a few years, not many years<br />
anyhow, few of us could have thought that order could have been<br />
created out of chaos. Few of us could have thought that your<br />
production would have been increasing as rapidly as it has,<br />
and few of us could have thought that you would have brought<br />
inflation under control as rapidly -and that your trade, Indonesia's<br />
trade would be expanding, and gradually you would be placed in a<br />
position of being able to pay your own way.<br />
So, Sir, for all these reasons, I think we in Australia<br />
appreciate what you have done and it adds warmth to the welcome<br />
that I have just conveyed to you on behalf of the Australian<br />
people. Now, Sir, may I turn to our international relationships,<br />
the relationships between our two countries, and again on a much<br />
wider canvas as you expressed to me this morning, the need for us<br />
Jointly and co-operatively to play our part in the peace, freedom<br />
and independence of all of the peoples of the Asian and Pacific / 3 </p>
<p>-3<br />
region. First of all, Sir, in matters of defence, you know that<br />
we are willing and anxious to play our part and to give you<br />
assistance, not only in military aid but also where we can in<br />
training your own people. And whilst we respect the fact that<br />
you want to remain non-aligned and that you want,-as far as is<br />
humanly practicable to be able to take an bttitude of complete<br />
independence from the operations of others, nonetheless you do<br />
4ccept the view that when it is in the interest of Indonesia,<br />
Australia and the free world, then we can co-operate together<br />
ia military area because here we know we are acting in the<br />
* nterests of humanity rather than our own individual interest<br />
Or own political decisions.<br />
So Sir, we play our part and I believe we play our<br />
part together, too, b) ecause we have the same objectives, the<br />
same basic principles in our approach to a common solution of<br />
our problems and those are and again I have an adaptation of<br />
Your own words that you believe, Sir, not so much in establishing<br />
a peace zone in a particular area that may perhaps be indefensible,<br />
Out you do believe in making a maximum contribution to the peace,<br />
to the prosperity, the independence and freedom of every country<br />
in the region in which both ycu and I live.<br />
So these, Sir, are the ideals that ptomote our<br />
activities and determine what we should do. And if we look, too,<br />
in terms of trade and aid, so far as we are concerned, our trade<br />
is improving every day and I hope yours is too. And so far as<br />
our aid programmes are concerned, leaving aside our own external<br />
territories, there is no country to whom we give greater support<br />
and greater assistance than we do to yours. And you very well<br />
said to me, as you reminded me this morning, that not only do<br />
we piake this contribution willingly and freely, but we do it<br />
without expecting any repayment, without any prize of any kind at<br />
all and there is no other country that gives quite as<br />
generously or quite as freely as we do.<br />
There is only one exception here and that is with<br />
pev~ sa Kredi*. and of course with this we have agreed to your<br />
recormmendations and we have ties associated with this kind of<br />
aid, Similarly, too, if we look at other parts of our<br />
programme, I think yn-u can find that there is a willingness in<br />
our development programmes to be able to be of assistance.<br />
And I well remember wheD. I was in Djaklarta probably two years ago,<br />
or probably not quite thatlong ago, I was able to discuss the<br />
development of the port of Tjilatjap in the South of Java, that<br />
it could be done first of all by a feasibility survey then by<br />
ddvelopment from Australian and other resources. And at that time<br />
I was able to tell you and now I confirm what I said then, that<br />
Australian manufacturers will be only too happy to go there and<br />
are now ready to establish factories if they can find, as I am<br />
sure they will, that the opportunities for development are there<br />
and that the markets will be able to absorb their products. .4 </p>
<p>A And so, Sir, may I turn to the purposes of your visit<br />
to my country today. The first one, as I think you will make<br />
more than abundantly clear, is that you want to keep the process<br />
of goodwill and keep the process of mutual co-operation going. I<br />
am certain you will be successful.<br />
The second one is that you want to look at Australian<br />
industry to see whether parts of it are suitable to be created<br />
and developed in your own country. Again I believe you will be<br />
looking at a glass factory in .1elbourne, and if I can take notice<br />
of one of tepeople who talked to me on Monday, he will be<br />
anxiously looking to see whether he will have the opportunity to<br />
develop in your country.<br />
And finally, Sir, again if I can repeat what you said to<br />
me this morning, you did refer to the doctrine of Pantjasila.<br />
Here in other days, we always referred to it as " Panchsheel",<br />
and that is the right of each country to independence and the<br />
wish that each country should let its neighbour live in peace<br />
and freedom from interference from bigger neighbours and bigger<br />
people who have predatory desires against them.<br />
So, Sir, here we are together, joining in common cause<br />
wi~ th our hearts all set on a common destination and common<br />
o ) jectives. I believe if . you look at it in this way, I can<br />
complcte what I want to say to you and to an Australian audience<br />
and to an Australian Parliament.<br />
But you can well go home even now, Sir, not that I want you<br />
to, and I wouldn't let you, but you could go home and you could<br />
hava two words prominently in your mind and I think they would be<br />
in the minds of most people here today, too; you can go home with<br />
Madame Soeharto; you can go home with your friend, Adam Malik,<br />
the three of you together can on the plane t'Lrip home say " Mission<br />
accomplished. We have met with a lot of goodwill. We know they<br />
are friends. We know that they will play t--heir part in the<br />
devqlopment of the free world in that part of the region in whiich<br />
we all have the good fortune to live". </p>
