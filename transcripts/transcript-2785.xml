JOINT COMMUNIQUE<br />
The Prime Minister of Australia, the Hon. E. G. Whitlam,<br />
visited New Zealand from 20 to 23 January at the invitation<br />
of the Prime Minister of New Zealand, the Hon. Norman Kirk.<br />
The two Prime Ministers had lengthy and intimate<br />
discussions on a wide range of issues.<br />
AUSTRALIA-NEW ZEALAND COOPERATION<br />
The Prime Ministers noted that their first meeting<br />
since they came into office took place on the 29th<br />
anniversary of the signing of the Australian-New Zealand<br />
Agreement of 1944 the ANZAC Pact. Although they<br />
recognised that parts of that Agreement had been overtaken<br />
by events and were less relevant to contemporary<br />
needs, the Prime Ministers felt that close consultation<br />
and collaboration between Australia and New Zealand<br />
were needed in 1973 as they had been in 1944.<br />
The Prime Ministers recognised that a habit of<br />
consultation and exchanges had developed between the<br />
two countries based on the 1944 Agreement. They took<br />
the opportunity to reaffirm the principles of that<br />
Agreement. They indicated their intention to work for<br />
the closest possible consultation and collaboration on<br />
all matters political, economic, defence, social and<br />
cultural which affected their joint interests,<br />
particularly in the South Pacific region.<br />
To this end the Prime Ministers agreed to make<br />
every effort to revitalise and further to strengthen<br />
the habit of consultation by means of more frequent<br />
exchanges between Ministers and regular meetings of<br />
officials on both sides of the Tasman. The Prime<br />
Ministers agreed that they themselves should meet<br />
informally at least once a year for an overall review<br />
of relations between Australia and New Zealand.<br />
Economic Particular attention was paid by the Prime Ministers<br />
to the broad principles which should underlie the growing<br />
economic relations between Australia and New Zealand.<br />
Agreement was reached on the need to broaden the range<br />
of consultations on economic matters between both<br />
countries and it was decided that officials of both<br />
countries would jointly undertake a comprehensive<br />
reappraisal of the scope for increased economic cooperation<br />
as soon as possible.<br />
The Prime Ministers noted that the New Zealand/<br />
Australia Free Trade Agreement ( NAFTA) of 1965 had been<br />
an important instrument in contribuiting to a growth in<br />
trade. However, the objectives of the'Agreement / should </p>
<p>should not be seen as directed solely to trade expansion<br />
but through trade expansion to furthering the economic<br />
and social development of the two countries and the<br />
use of their resources. The implementation of policies<br />
of the two Labour Governments would provide the opportunity<br />
for both countries to take a new look at how progre'ss in<br />
bilateral trade under NAFTA might become more rapid and<br />
effective. The development of NAFTA will be thoroughly<br />
reviewed at a Ministerial meeting to be held shortly in<br />
Wellington. The preferential tariff arrangements between the<br />
two countries were considered in the light of the<br />
imminent termination of their trade agreements with<br />
Britain. Agreement was reached that negotiations will<br />
proceed about the retention of preferences on a mutually<br />
beneficial basis.<br />
The Prime Ministers discussed the impact of the<br />
enlarged European Communities on the trading interests<br />
of the two countries. It was -agreed that this development<br />
underlined the need for Aust-.-alia. and No1w Zealand to work<br />
together in the economic sphere. Th1is nee:, d particularly<br />
apparent in the case of primary products where the two<br />
countries would encourage their marketing organisations<br />
to cooperate to the fullest oxtenit possible.<br />
The Prime Ministers~ noted the good work being done<br />
by the Australia/ New Zealand Joinz Dairy Cormittee.<br />
They agreed on the importance of close cooperation in<br />
this sector to imeet changes in the world trading patterns<br />
arising in particular from the enlargement1-of the European<br />
Communities. The two Prime Ministers agreed that the successful<br />
completion of the coming GATT round of multilateral<br />
trade negotiations, particularly in the field of<br />
agricultural trade, was of the greatest importance and<br />
that the two countries would work together to this end.<br />
DefenceCooperation The two Prime Ministers noted that there had been<br />
close cooperation in defence between Australia and<br />
New Zealand ever since World War II, and that it had<br />
developed in recent years. They agreed on the importance<br />
of continuing, and where practicable furthering, this<br />
cooperation, and of assisting each other whenever<br />
possible in such fields as personnel, facilities and<br />
courses of training, operational and technical matters,<br />
and the supply of defence equipment. They noted that<br />
studies were being made of the strategic basis of<br />
defence cooperation, and that the Australia-New Zealand<br />
Consultative Conmmittee on Defence Cooperation would<br />
report to the two Governments on this question among<br />
other s. / Travel </p>
<p>Travel The Prime Ministers agreed that citizens of each<br />
country and citizens of other Commonwealth countries who<br />
have resident status in either Australia or New Zealand<br />
should henceforth be able to travel between Australia<br />
and New Zealand, for permanent or temporary stay, without<br />
passports or visas. Talks between immigration officials<br />
of the two countries regarding practical arrangements<br />
for the implementation of the new policy would take<br />
place as soon as possible.<br />
INTERNATIONAL QUESTIONS<br />
The two Prime Ministers also discussed a number of<br />
international. questions of concern to both Now Zealand<br />
and Australia, on which their two Governments intend to<br />
work together as closely as possible.<br />
South Pacific Affairs<br />
The two Prime Ministers recalled the developments<br />
of the last 25 years in the South Pacific, many of<br />
which owed a good deal to the impetus of the ANZAC Pact<br />
of 1944. They expressed satisfaction that the South<br />
Pacific Conference now meets annually to approve the<br />
work progranate of the South Pacific Commission and that<br />
in recent years both Australia and New Zealand have<br />
been represented at sessions of the Conference by<br />
Ministers. The Conission had been strengthened by<br />
Western Samoa, Nauru and Fiji becoming full members.<br />
They attached particular value to the South Pacific<br />
Forum, which offered the Heads of* Government of the<br />
independent and self-governing states of the Pacific<br />
an opportunity to explore common problems, to consider<br />
priorities, and to plan cooperative programmes on a<br />
practical basis. Already it had demonstrated its<br />
usefulness to the governments concerned.<br />
Both Prime Ministers were planning to attend an<br />
early meeting of the Forum. They were very much<br />
looking forward to this opportunity of meeting their<br />
colleagues, the leaders of the Island states.<br />
Advantage was seen in developing contacts between<br />
Parliamentarians in the area, and enabling them to take<br />
a wider role in the consultative and planning processes.<br />
One possibility which was canvassed was to include<br />
Members of Parliament in delegations attending the<br />
South Pacific Conference, as was the Australian practice.<br />
The Prime Ministers pledged that their Governments<br />
would continue to work to the best of their ability<br />
for the progress and advancement of the people of the<br />
/ Paci f ic </p>
<p>Pacific, guided always by the wishes and aspirations of<br />
the people of the area and their leaders.<br />
The Prime Minister of Australia gave an account<br />
of recent constitutional and economic developments in<br />
Papua New Guinea and forecast an early advance to full<br />
self-government, to be followed by independence. The<br />
Prime Minioter of New Zealand acknowl edged the importance<br />
of these developments for New Zealand, and, as earnest<br />
of the goodwill of the'people of New Zealand, indicated<br />
that his Government wa8 disposed to establish a diplomatic<br />
mission in Port Moresby at an appropriate time.-<br />
The Prime Minister of New Zealand said that he was<br />
glad to report that Niue would soon be fully selfgoverning.<br />
A delegation from the Niue I-ouse of Assembly<br />
was expected inWellington in a few weeks for constitutional<br />
talks. Race Relations<br />
The Prime Ministers reaffirmied their belief in the<br />
equality of every citizen in a multi-racial society and<br />
the right of all to the enjoyment of equal opportunities.<br />
Policies of racial discrimination such as apartheid<br />
are directly contrary to the provisions of the United<br />
Nations Charter. They are abho-rent and cannot be<br />
accepted by the international coanunity. The P'rime<br />
Ministers agreed that their two countries would strive<br />
to implement measures, national and international, which<br />
would help to bring to aneri all such discriminatory<br />
policies. Asian and Pacific Region<br />
The two Prime Ministers made it clear that New<br />
Zealand and Australia stood ready to work with other<br />
countries in the Asian and Pacific region to achieve<br />
for their peoples the benefits of peace, progress and<br />
cooperation. They recalled that since their Governments came to<br />
power Australia and New Zealand had both recognised and<br />
established diplomatic relations with the People's<br />
Republic of China, and they indicated that both were<br />
anxious to develop friendly cooperation with that country.<br />
The Prime Ministers also recalled that, while New Zealand<br />
and Australia had withdrawn their remaining forces from<br />
South Vietnam, both Governments had made it clear that<br />
they are prepared to take their parts in an international<br />
rehabilitation programme throughout Indo-China. They<br />
welcomed the progress that had recently been made in the<br />
Paris peace talks and expressed the hope that agreement<br />
would be reached soon on a settlement fair to all.<br />
/ The </p>
<p>The two Prime Ministers agreed'that the essential<br />
objective was to end the war and the terrible suffering%<br />
it had caused.<br />
Recognising that changes in the relationships<br />
between the great powers aind the ending of the war in<br />
Indo-China were bound to affect other countries in<br />
South East Asia, the two Prime Ministers acknowledged<br />
the importance of maintaining stability and confidence<br />
in the area while the countries there were adjusting to<br />
the new situation. The P~ rime Ministers noted that<br />
Australia and New. Zealand forces were in Singapore and<br />
Malaysia by agreement with the Governments of those<br />
countries. They discusSed the future disposition of<br />
their forces: they, would each consult with their<br />
partners in the Five Power Defence Arrangements.<br />
They also expressed willingness to discuss with countries<br />
in the area what forms of assistance from No1w Zealand and<br />
Australia would be most appropriate and helpful.<br />
The two Prime Ministers expressed understanding and.<br />
support for the desire of the membcers of ASEAN to limit<br />
outside interference in the affairs of South East Asia,<br />
and sympathy for their efforts to make the area a zone<br />
of peace, freedom and neutrality.<br />
The two Prime Ministers agreed that effective<br />
cooperation in the fields of economic and social<br />
development, trade, cultural exchanges and political<br />
consultations was at leaot as important as joint efforts<br />
in the defence field in promoting the peaceful progress<br />
of the region. The Prime Ministers expressed their<br />
intention to work with their Asian and Pacific neighbours<br />
in making adjustmants to existing arrangements and seeking<br />
new forms of cooperation that took full account of the<br />
present realities of the situation in Asia and the<br />
Pacific. They offered to join in appropriate efforts<br />
to bring the countries of the Asian and Pacific region<br />
together in a new collective endeavour to promote the<br />
wellbeing of their peoples.<br />
The United States<br />
The Prime Ministers reaffirmed the intention of<br />
both their Governments to maintain friendly relations<br />
with the United States in a spirit of mutual respect<br />
and trust. They noted that the ANZUS Treaty symbolised<br />
a community of interest and outlook among the three<br />
partners that extended to many fields other than defence.<br />
By strengthening the security of Australia and New<br />
Zealand, the Treaty helps to create a climate that<br />
enables the two countries to work with their neighbours<br />
and to contribute to the peaceful progress of the Asian<br />
and Pacific region in general. There had been occasions<br />
on which the policies of the three Governments had<br />
/ diverged </p>
<p>6.<br />
diverged, and, as they were all sovereign independent<br />
states, there might well be other occasions in the<br />
future. But such instances need not and should not<br />
disturb the friendly ties among the three countries, or<br />
their far-ranging cooperation in practical matters.<br />
Nuclear Weapons Testingl<br />
The Prime Ministers accorded high priority to the<br />
problem posed by continued nuclear weapons testing.<br />
They emphasised that their opposition extended to all<br />
forms of nuclear weapons testing by whatever nation and<br />
reaffirmed the objectives of a suspension of all such<br />
testing and the conclusion of a comprehensive test ban<br />
treaty. They appealed in particular to France to appreciate<br />
the special degree of concern which the toesting of<br />
nuclear weapons in the South Pacific causes throuqhtout<br />
the region. They recalled that an overwheilming majority<br />
in the United Nations had already acknowledged the<br />
legitimate nature of this widespread concern. The<br />
Prime Ministers declared their Governments' intention,<br />
failing such an aszurance, to work together to oppose<br />
the tests by all appropriate means and to consult closely<br />
w ith other countries in the region.<br />
