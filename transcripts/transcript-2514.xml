PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR PPESS: A 2 5 PMN No95197<br />
AWARD OF GEORGE CROSS ( POSTHUMOUS)<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, M~ r William McMahon<br />
Her Majesty The Queen has approved that the George Cross<br />
be awarded posthumously to the late Errol John Emanuel in recogqiti~ on<br />
of the conspicuous courage he displayed as District Commissioner for<br />
the East New Britain district of Papua New Guinea.<br />
As Deputy District Commissioner at Rabaul from July 196~ 9 and<br />
later as District Commissioner for the East New Britain District, Mr<br />
Emanuel was engaged in the arduous role of influencing deeply hostile<br />
groups of the Tolai people to discuss their difficulties i. n a peaceful<br />
and tolerant atmosphere. Even when tension was at its highest, he<br />
visited villages by day and night, almost always alone, to talk<br />
personally to leaders of all groups to gain their confidem-nce and. trust.<br />
On a number of occasions, between March and the date of his<br />
death in August, 1971, involving pulblic confrontations and imminent<br />
violence between police parties and large groups of people, Kr Emanuel<br />
displayed outstanding courage. on each occasion Mr E--manuel deliberately<br />
left the cover of police protection and, regardless of his own satfety,<br />
moved among the people in order to pacify them. Each time h-e war,<br />
personally responsible for avoiding possible bloodshed or loss of life.<br />
He never wavered from his task, choosing to expose himself to danger<br />
rather than risk the lives of his fellow officers and the police,<br />
culminating in his ultimely death on 19 kugust 1971 while carrying<br />
out his official duties.<br />
M1r Emanuel's sustained acts of conspicuous courage over a<br />
long period in circumstances of extreme danger and in complete<br />
disregard for his pearsonal safety were in the highest traditions of<br />
bravery and sacrifice carried out beyond the call of duty.<br />
