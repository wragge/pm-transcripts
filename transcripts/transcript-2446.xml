FOR PRESS PMK No. 74/ 1971<br />
PRESIDENT NIXON'S STATEMENT ON CHINA<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, Mr William McMahon<br />
I welcome without reservation President Nixon's statement<br />
concerning United States relationships with the People's Republic of<br />
China and his intention to visit China early next year. I was informed<br />
of the purport of his statement in advance.<br />
The President's purpose of normalising relationships<br />
with China has been the public ly-announced policy of the Australian<br />
Government for some time.<br />
Indeed, President Nixon's anxiety to " seek normalisation<br />
of relations and exchange views on questions of concern" precisely<br />
describes what we ourselves have been seeking to do by our approaches<br />
through diplomatic channels in Paris.<br />
In particular, I want to draw the attention of the Australian<br />
people to President Nixon's statement that the action he is taking will<br />
" not be at the expense of old friends".<br />
In the future, Australia's policies and actions will be<br />
guided by these principles as they have been in the past.<br />
I share wholeheartedly the President's view that all will<br />
gain from a reduction of tension between the United States and the<br />
People's Republic of Chi na. I wish him good fortune in an initiative<br />
that has the full support of Australia.<br />
I emphasise that President Nixon's statement relates<br />
to the normalisation of relationships with China in the interests of<br />
world peace.<br />
