PRIME MINISTER INTERVIEWED ON CHANNEL 7 ( BRISBANE) STATE AFFAIR<br />
( INTERVIEWER MIKE DARCY: ANCHORMAN GLENN TAYLOR), 27/ 6/ 85 6o30 pm.<br />
II i-<br />
GT: A major split has appeared in the Federal government's<br />
campaign for tax reform. The powerful Centre Left of<br />
the Labor Party, headed by Queensland's Bill Hayden, has<br />
declared it will be opposing the government's preferred<br />
tax plan. It seems no one wants to buy the package<br />
which the Prime Minister and Treasurer have been trying<br />
to sell around Australia over the last couple of veeks,<br />
and time's rup out. The tax summit starts on Monday<br />
a: nd Mr Hawke finished his campaign for support in Brisbane<br />
today. He speaks with State Affair's political reporter,<br />
Mike Darcy.<br />
MD: Mr Hawke, the climb to the summit very difficult for<br />
yourself and Mr Keating?<br />
PH: I wouldn't describe it as difficult, there's been a lot of<br />
hard work but our goals wore clear and we knew the dimension<br />
of the task and the degree of emotions out there ranging from<br />
hostility in some areas to scepticism through to just straight<br />
uncertainty, and think that Paul in particular has had the<br />
main carriage of it, has done an excellent job. I've tried<br />
to assist. I think it's meant that by the time we get to<br />
the summit oh Monday that an unprecedented public debate will<br />
have taken place and it should mean that people when they get<br />
there are going to have to nt . just utter prejudices but<br />
they're going to have to substantiate positions, as we will.<br />
MD: Up until now theares been a lack of enthusiasm right around<br />
Australia about the preferred options.<br />
i/<br />
PRiME MONOSTER </p>
<p>PM: The lack of enthusiasm has pe-' h*&amp; ps been more reported than<br />
the onthusiasm. I1 can say now that I've spoken to thousandsi<br />
o-f' people and received a very . good response. -A lot of'<br />
people have aiid well we were worried but now we understand<br />
apd. we approve. Ithink i~ s In the nz~ ture of' things that<br />
you tend to got the report about opposition rather than<br />
ugreement,,,<br />
MD: Well where is the bagreement c6orzing from...?<br />
PM: From ordinary people.<br />
MD., There seems to be discontent ' in rural Australia you've<br />
got the<br />
P: L'et's take it one by one you'~ vz got the National Farmers'<br />
l'oderation is notv opposed to L. ha totality of the package,<br />
they think the idea of' a consumption tax makes sense they<br />
have the qualificaion. about . the app . lication of it to<br />
their fuel imputs and that's artdrtnal~ obfn tsi<br />
correct to say that the Parmzral federation are against the<br />
totality<br />
HD: No rural Australia'. Ycu've adthes-cene of tens of<br />
thousands in the streets<br />
TMO No. 1309.* d<br />
MD: Yes, but they're c: Oming down to Canberra also t0@ 9.<br />
P: Let's get it quite. clear that. those rallies have not<br />
Veen about the tax, proposals ' as such they've got a concern,<br />
which I understand, and I've said so, about rising farm costs,<br />
Oecause they are being hit to leg on the international<br />
m~ arkets by the operations of : the Europeans and they are<br />
correspondingly mo : re concerne d about farm costs, and that's<br />
what they've been rallying about around Australia in a<br />
s~ ense, justifiablY. But it hasn't been against the tax<br />
package. </p>
<p>tIP.: But they're tur'nina; upi to Canberra.<br />
M: Of course they are and it would be. ver-y silly Of theM<br />
in a sense not to tbiy've been rallying round Australia<br />
an~ d they're going tc have the sp). light on Canberra on<br />
Monday, they'd be silly not to..<br />
MD: The ACTUfs uncommitted, the building unions have rejected<br />
the consumption tak: outright...<br />
PM: The ACTU's left itts option open.<br />
MID: Right. There's opposition from some sectors of the business<br />
jI: There'~ s also Zreat support from some sections.<br />
MD: Well,. lukewarm rec9ption..<br />
PM: No the Business Council of Auptralia when they haC their<br />
second consideration of it, t-ame out wit%-h a very tzl<br />
supportive stAtemefit.<br />
MD: What about welfare agencies? For example the Salvation<br />
Army this morning was reportea as saying they're going to<br />
be out of pocket by $ 5 millioil.<br />
PM: Well on the assumptions they biake but it.' s that area that<br />
I11l1 be listening to very very closely at the tax summit<br />
because we certainl. y are not ' going to do anything which Is<br />
, going to adversely'affoct the needy in this community and<br />
I believe the welfare communit~ y has an obligation to put their<br />
case which they wll. discharge and if they can show the-need<br />
for some sort of adjustment 8and fine tuning so that the needy<br />
are not disadvantaged we'll take that aboard.<br />
MD: Well what about consensus? TYhe polls seem to indicate that<br />
Australians at the' moment are not prepared to-accept any<br />
changes or r~ forms on tax.<br />
* 7 -I r;. q C-r 1 Iz<br />
Y; I </p>
<p>PMI' don't accept thate. 0<br />
MD: There was an-ABC poll last ni*-ht., theve was the Taxpayers'<br />
Association poll which they s'ay 80 per cent of consumers<br />
rejected and 91 pei' cent o~ f business-* O<br />
PM: Yes sure, I just make this ge'neral point about polls -if<br />
you let me write the question's X111 tend to guarantee the<br />
abrt of' answers I1.1l get and : that I want. Now that's not<br />
to say, I'm not trying to dis Icount there's a lot of opposition,<br />
of' course there Is, but there is also much more agreement<br />
than anything else on the tac-t that the existing ayste~ m<br />
has had it and something's go't to be done, and something will<br />
be done. It's a question of whether we can get broad enough<br />
support for exactly the option. that we think at this stage<br />
in all the evidence -is the bea* t way of' doing it, and as I've<br />
said from thelword go we'll l'isten to what people-have to say<br />
at the summit' and if' there's reed for somne sort of'<br />
qualification'to better match the broad community attitude<br />
then we'll do that.'. But we gwill continue to put, as on the<br />
evidence I believe the case t~ o be now, the preferred " p. Ntion,<br />
MD: But. you are keeping-your optf~ ons open?<br />
PM: Yes, but I'm ' not doing it just now, I've done it right<br />
f'rom-the very beginning in the election campaign.<br />
MDl: So there could be ! changes to the preferred options....<br />
M: There could be I'vc-said that but this stage, on the evidence<br />
available to'me, I don't see thtteeneeds to be, but<br />
c'ertain things have arisen which obviously need close<br />
examination and 11' ve taken the. view all along that we're not<br />
going to be~ Pig-headed and s6y that this is what it must be,<br />
sie're absolutely right., we're' going to listen.<br />
MID: ' You talked last night about t he* privileged. That the.<br />
current system i-s set up to look after the privileged in<br />
our community. In trying to get at the privileged and the<br />
tax avoiders, and that in our'. community are you really going<br />
to be hurting the average per : son or the disadvantaged of<br />
Austral. ia? I<br />
' K C. I * 1~ l </p>
<p>PH!~ The evidence is quite to the contrary. If you l. ook at<br />
the simple Guide to T~ ax R~ eforpi we put out, thr~ the<br />
simple facts. You take the person on $ 17,500 income par<br />
year you Ãµ hould get a tax cut' of $ 22.70, the increase of'<br />
costs you'll be cotifronted with. 0.0 s1 it will bo $ 7.40<br />
a week better off &amp; Lnd so on. And, in regard to that those<br />
who are on social welfare payments it's calculated that<br />
for the single penpioner costs Would go up by 6 a week<br />
and. we'll1 increase, the pension by $ 9 a week, so of' course<br />
we'Ire going to enspre that peobple are not only going<br />
to be not worse off, but are better off. Ife'll be able<br />
to do that to a cofisiderable : extent because, under the<br />
preferred option a large econof' the people, those<br />
privileged people who have evaded and avoided tax<br />
wiLll be caught by a consumption ta:: and that gives what we<br />
talk about as a fiscal dividend which gives you part of the<br />
wherewithall to help tiiose wh'o deserve help.<br />
MD: But every gets hur by the consumption tax..<br />
P Therels no point in sayin&amp; ge. t hurt. . I mean it's no good<br />
saying they get hui't by payin* S the. consumption tax and say<br />
you've finished it. The pac'icage is not just about a<br />
consumption tax, at the same time as this increase in price<br />
there's also an increatse in t -he pamnsavailable. So<br />
make this point8 people seem to say, or people perhaps includi<br />
yourself seem to think, that this'is the first time the tax<br />
bystem, has had anything to do. with people's capacity t6' buy<br />
goods and services. At this: ti~ me the tax system determines<br />
your capacity,, and'the capacity-of ot'dinary people to buy<br />
goods and services because you buy your goods'and services<br />
with your after-tax income. Now because your after-tax<br />
income has been reduced considerably by having to pay too muc2<br />
tax in part because other people Are avoiding theirs, you.<br />
have-a lesser amoutit of money with which to buy your goods anc<br />
services than you ehould have.. So the tax system now<br />
operates on the capacity to buy the level of your goods and<br />
services. So if kre substantially increase the amount of<br />
o; W-6<br />
2 ST CV~ j </p>
<p>money that you've got in after-taxc term~ s to buy Goods and<br />
services, the pricbs of which yes have come up sonewhait,<br />
you're gotng to bel better off'. Don't let's think that<br />
tbis9 is the fIrst timo tax system has impinged on goods and<br />
services. It's impinging no and in a very unfair' vay.<br />
14D: Basically'people want to know: what. they're going to'get<br />
oit of it isn't that basically what it come' downt?<br />
PM: That.' s reasonable too,<br />
14D: You're saying that they're going to get -that the average<br />
p~ raon will be better off -so why isn'' t everyone embracing<br />
o ption C?<br />
PM: Because it's natural enough that people will have their<br />
concern focussed upon. things they see that might going to<br />
be hurting thew, Let me say also about the Labor dovement<br />
because there's a lot of oppos8ition or non-acceptance in<br />
the labor movement. Now. that' . s exp lained by the fact<br />
that historically the labor w'overnent both politically and<br />
industrially has skid that indirect taxes are bad and they've<br />
been right because thoe philosophy of that opposition has been~<br />
right because by definition if ' you impose an indirect tax<br />
on goods and services poorer : people are going to be hurt more~<br />
thn-zthe well off. And so peboplea attitudss.-have been shape~<br />
historically by that well-founded position. Now they havenu'<br />
yet realised that it's n~ ot just a question of imposing<br />
indirect tax but a very substantfial compensation--<br />
package of $ 2 billion. Now that $ 2 billion interrupts,, if<br />
y . ou like, your history. So the poor will not in fact be<br />
adversely affected.<br />
MD: B ' i~ f you can't even sell It' to your own ALP branches round<br />
Australia, how do you expect *. to sell it to the average person<br />
in the street<br />
PM: O Tt may in fact be easier because you ' see people have been<br />
a . ctive in the Labor party and, they've been imbued.' with this<br />
h-istory I've referred to and. I understand and accept that<br />
bistory, and I think they haven' 1t been able to make a jump<br />
at sindorstanlding that we know our history as well as they do,<br />
/ 7<br />
4I, _ 2 </p>
<p>and are dealing with it. Al) 1 can jay is I've been round<br />
Australia and I've talkced to thousands of~ people and some<br />
havea come up and said sure we. wer'e worried but w! e now<br />
nderstand. I aclept'that rhabre you're ( ealing with tax<br />
you're dealing with Nomathiig of deep concern and people have<br />
tbeir prejudices. We've gone about our task I think<br />
reasonably, of trying to expl -ain and we realise of course<br />
that there's a lot more explaining to do.<br />
GT: The Prime Minister, Bob Hawke speaking there in our Brisbane<br />
studio with Mike *-' Arcy. Indeed there's a lot of' persuasive<br />
idea and merit to the-notion of catching those people w: ho<br />
do~ n'L contribute any tax at all. ! The way though ia that<br />
there wili'be a lot of middle'to high income earners who<br />
fir'ish up paying both aides of the merry.. go-round getting<br />
no tax relief and getting the' consumption tax as well..<br />
Another . question to be asked, of course, is how much will<br />
this new revenue-raising cost*. in ternpa uo administration.<br />
