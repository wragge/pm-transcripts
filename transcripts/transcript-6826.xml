FOR MEDIA 29 January 1986<br />
The Prime Minister has sent the following message to<br />
President Reagan:<br />
" I am shocked and greatly saddened by the tragic accident<br />
that has resulted in the destruction of the space Shuttle<br />
Challenger and the loss of its crew. We in Australia have<br />
long admired the expertise, dedication and courage that have<br />
characterised the many pioneering American achievements in<br />
space over recent decades. I am sure all Australians join me<br />
in extending through you to the American people and<br />
especially to the families of the Challenger crew our deep<br />
sympathy and understanding."<br />
