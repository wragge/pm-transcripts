PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF COMMENTS, PARLIAMENT HOUSE, 17 FEBRUARY 1987<br />
E &amp; 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
-JOURNALIST: What do you think of-Mr Sinclair's -position?-----<br />
PM: Precarious.<br />
JOURNALIST: Why do you say that?<br />
PM: I just contrast what he says with what Sir Joh says<br />
about the outcome. Sir Joh says an absolute victory for him<br />
and Joh is not always wrong.--It is-a humiliation,--total------<br />
humiliation, for Mr Sinclair. He was making all sorts of<br />
brave noises before he went into his meeting and then had to<br />
sign a virtual handover of his party and eventually his<br />
leadership to Sir Joh.<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you expect to be attacked on the economy<br />
today, Prime Minister?<br />
PM: You never know what you will expect from what passes<br />
for an Opposition but we are ready for whatever they may have<br />
to say.<br />
JOURNALIST: Do those figures make you vulnerable?<br />
PM: They were at the top end of expectations, certainly, and<br />
we would have liked to have seen them lower but we have the<br />
right economic policies for a very difficult situation that<br />
has been imposed upon us from outside. Our policies are<br />
correct, they are understandable and they are there as<br />
distinct from the Opposition who have no policies atall-.--<br />
None. ends I </p>
