FOR PRESS 3i:<br />
PM4L No. 24/ 1969<br />
MRS. HOFFMANN'S STORY<br />
Comment by the Prime Minister, Mr John Gorton<br />
In accordance with established practice, the<br />
Government has consistently refused in Parliament either to confirm<br />
or deny that Mrs Hoffmann did any work for ASLO at the Japanese<br />
Embassy eight years ago.<br />
Again, in accordance with that practice, I do not<br />
propose either to confirm or deny the truth of Mrs Hoffmanns<br />
published story. But the reported comments of Mr Whitlam and<br />
Senator Murphy on the matter appear to me to be both hysterical<br />
and ludicrous. If the story is not true, it can be disregarded. If<br />
it is true, then it shows that as a result of attempted espionage and<br />
bribery against Australia' s interests, Mrs Hoffmann engaged in<br />
counter espionage in Australia' s interests.<br />
Surely no Australian cculd object to that except<br />
apparently Mr Whitlam and his Parliamentary colleagues of the Labor<br />
Party. By their objections I think that they do Australia<br />
a disservice. But this is neither to confirm wr deny Mrs Hoffmann's<br />
story itself.<br />
