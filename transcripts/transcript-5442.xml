Federal Government assistance to local bodies throughout<br />
Australia will exceed $ 300 million this financial year.<br />
This follows implementation of the Government's commitment<br />
to increase the allocation of personal income tax collections<br />
to local Government to 2 per cent.<br />
Local authorities have received $ 300.79 million compared<br />
with $ 221.74 million last financial year a massive<br />
35.65 per cent increase in general revenue assistance.<br />
Overall, local Government will have received over $ 1,000 million<br />
in untied grants in the five years of the tax sharing<br />
arrangements under this Government.<br />
Details of Government assistance to local Government were<br />
contained in a report of the-distribution of Commonwealth<br />
funds by the States Grants Commission for the 1980-81 financial<br />
year tabled by the Prime Minister in Parliament today.<br />
The Government has accepted the recommendations made by<br />
the States Grants Commission and the amounts to be paid to<br />
each State in 1980-81, together with corresponding amounts<br />
for 1979-80 are:<br />
Local Government Tax Sharing Entitlements 1979/ 80 1980/ 81<br />
New South Wales 80.93 109.78<br />
Victoria 56.44 76.55<br />
Queens land 37.39 50.71<br />
South Australia 19.07 25.87<br />
Western Australia 20.82 28.24<br />
Tasmania 7.09 9.62<br />
Total ( rounded) 221.74 300.79<br />
Funds provided to the States under these arrangements are<br />
allocated to individual local Government authorities by<br />
the States. / 2 </p>
<p>I V" Under Federal Government guidelines, at least 30 per cent of<br />
the funds must be distributed to Councils on a per capita<br />
basis which may be weighted for area or population density.<br />
The balance is allocated on a needs basis which is subject to<br />
prior inquiry and report by the individual State Grants<br />
Commissions. General revenue assistance to local Government has increased<br />
from $ 80 million under the previous Labor Government to<br />
$ 140 million in 1976-77, $ 165 million in 1977-78, $ 179.4 million<br />
in 1978-79, $ 221.74 million in 1979-80 and $ 300.79 million<br />
in 1980-81.<br />
In addition to money provided to the States the Federal<br />
Government has made provision for an timount of $ 1.440 million<br />
to be made available in 1980-81 to the Northern Territory<br />
Government for distribution to the local Government authorities<br />
in the Territory. This compares with $ 1.062 million in<br />
1979-80.<br />
Clearly, the Federal Government tax sharing arrangements have<br />
provided a most substantial and rapidly growing source of funds<br />
for local Government bodies throughout the country.<br />
But most importantly, the funds are * Provided without strings.<br />
They have been welcomed by local Governments throughout<br />
Australia because they provide them with the freedom and<br />
the responsibility to determine their own priorities.<br />
The Federal Government believes that local authorities not<br />
the Government in* Canberra are best suited to decide how<br />
money is spent in local areas. 000-<br />
