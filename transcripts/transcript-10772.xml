    <content><![CDATA[<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, what's your response to the death of five</p>
<p>   Victorian firefighters?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well it's a particularly tragic event. The loss of lives is</p>
<p>   always tragic but there's something especially heartbreaking</p>
<p>   and poignant about people who lose their lives looking after others.</p>
<p>   They were all volunteers, they all came from the same part of Victoria,</p>
<p>   and they all died defending other people. And it really is a very</p>
<p>   upsetting thing and I send my sympathy to those who've lost</p>
<p>   family members and loved ones. I express the Government's solidarity</p>
<p>   with the Country Fire Authority of Victoria and all others around</p>
<p>   Australia who work to make our summer periods safe from bushfires,</p>
<p>   and just again express to everybody the absolute necessity during</p>
<p>   the summer period for total caution. Fires can be lit and can start</p>
<p>   from the most careless of actions and tragically from malicious</p>
<p>   actions as well. And last night was an awful tragic reminder of</p>
<p>   what the results of that can be and I really am very upset and I</p>
<p>   think all Australians feel particularly upset that so many people</p>
<p>   should have lost their lives looking after their fellow men and</p>
<p>   women. Thank you.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Does it make it worse just before Christmas?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well it's always sad when people die defending others and</p>
<p>   is something they have sacrificed their lives for their fellows</p>
<p>   and that's a tremendous act and I really am very upset and</p>
<p>   I think most Australians would feel exactly the same way. Thank</p>
<p>  r lives for their fellows</p>
<p>   and that's a tremendous act and I really am very upset and</p>
<p>   I think most Australians would feel exactly the same way. Thank</p>
<p>   you.</p>
