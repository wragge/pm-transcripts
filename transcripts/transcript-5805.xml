EMBARGO: 5.00pm<br />
FOR MEDIA SUNDAY, 2 MAY. 1982<br />
ELECTORATE TALK<br />
Last Thursday, the Minister for Defence, Mr Killen, made a<br />
major statement in the Parliament. It camne on the eve of events<br />
to mark the forthieth anniversary of one of Australia's most<br />
critical momients in history, the Battle of the Coral Sea.<br />
Australia's circumstances today are very different from those<br />
we faced in early May 1942, but the memory of those frightening<br />
days and the substance of last week's defence statement point to<br />
two things. First, that there is a continuing need for a strong<br />
defence force:, tailored to meet the threats and challenges of the<br />
times; and second, that the Government has been meeting its<br />
commitment to building that strong defence force.<br />
Defence requires adequate funding and appropriate manpower and<br />
equipment. The Government's defence spending has been increasing<br />
substantially in recent years, bringing With it s ignif icant real<br />
improvements in Australia's defence capability.. Indeed, defence<br />
outlays in 19181/ 82 have increased by 1 over 1980/ 81, well<br />
above the general price increases of between 10 and 11 per cent,<br />
and although the Budget for 1982/ 83 has not yet been competed,<br />
there will be a further substantial increase in the defence<br />
vote next year, adding further to our real defence capacity.<br />
In relation t~ o manpower, since service pay and allowances were<br />
increased late last year, there are already early indications<br />
that more service personnel are staying with the forces. There<br />
is sometimes the feeling that increases in service pay are not<br />
really a panl: of an increased defence effort, but this is quite<br />
wrong. Apart from the common justice of adequately paying~ those who are<br />
charged with the defence of Australia, it is important to attract<br />
appropriate people, to train and educate them to the high levels<br />
demanded today and then to retain them in the forces. Paying<br />
to attract, ' train and retain service personnel is an integral<br />
part.. of Australia's defence effort.<br />
In relation -to equipment, the Government has made two major<br />
changes to its on-going defence programme. We will acquire a new<br />
aircraft * carrier and ten new Orion aircraft earlier than planned.<br />
They were in the programme but they have both been brought forward. </p>
<p>-2-<br />
The decision to replace HMAS Melbourne with the new British<br />
carrier, HMS Invincible, is well known.. We wanted a new<br />
carrier, the Invincible became availabe, and it was a bargain<br />
price. We had to take advantage of the offer and make an early<br />
commitment or pay a lot more in the future for another aircraft<br />
carrier. Australia will also take early delivery of ten new P3C'Orion<br />
aircraft. In doing to so we have gained an advantage from getting<br />
into the current production run in the United States. They will'<br />
replace the existing squadron of P3B aircraft and their purchase<br />
will increase the nubmer of P3C's Australia has available to a<br />
total of twenty. These are modern long-range maritime patrol<br />
aircraft, they are the best in the world.<br />
The defence programme has to be flexible, we must be able to<br />
respond to changed circumstances. The pay increases and-the<br />
early acquisition of the aircraft carrier and the Orions have<br />
led to a rescheduling of some other items of the programme*<br />
but without detriment to our overall defence capacities'.<br />
We will continue to maintain and develop all cof our defence<br />
capabilities. This financial year, we will spend more than<br />
four billion dollars on the nation's defence and in the last<br />
18 months, we have more than doubled our commitment to future<br />
defence purchases to almost six billion dollars-.<br />
We have now, in the words of the recently retired Chief of Defence<br />
Force Staff, the best-equipped and best trained force we have ever'<br />
had in peacetime, and the programme we have developed for the<br />
future will continue to build it up.<br />
As well as the new aircraft carrier and the. 1.0-extra P3C Orions,<br />
we have decided to buy 75 highly sophisticated F/ A-18 fighter<br />
aircraft. Two new frigates have entered service and A further<br />
2 will enter service over the next couple of years. Our<br />
existing destroyers are being modernised and our defence<br />
industries are being upgraded to support and maintain the complex<br />
equipment entering service in this decade.<br />
Australia's defences are strong and relevant to today. The<br />
Government is fulfilling its fundamental responsibility-to keep<br />
this nation secure. </p>
