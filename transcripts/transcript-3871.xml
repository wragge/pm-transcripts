INTERVIEW BETWEEN THE PRIME MINISTER AND RICHARD CARLETON<br />
STATE OF THE NATION -28 AUGUST 1975<br />
Q. Well, Mr Whitlam how's it affected your running of this<br />
country having as you do the threat of an election hanging<br />
over your head every day?<br />
Prime Minister: I've got used to it. A year ago it would have been<br />
very oppressive to me now we just go on regardless. And<br />
you know we haven't been frozen in our tracks by this<br />
constant threat, for instance, I think we are still a<br />
very active, I think, creative Government... you know,<br />
all these tax reforms, doesn't look as though we're just<br />
looking for next month or next year.<br />
Q. But if you were confident that you had two years ahead of<br />
you would last-Tuesday's Budget have been the same paper?<br />
Prime Minister: Yes, yes, it is on that basis because there can<br />
be no swift change brought about in six months or twelve<br />
months.<br />
Q. Would you not last Tuesday week have brought in more<br />
adventureous, less politically attractive tax proposals if<br />
you could have been sure that you had two years before<br />
the next poll?<br />
Prime Minister: No, no. We wanted to bring in the tax changes<br />
we did partly because we thought they were fair. Partly<br />
because we thought that they would encourage people who<br />
needed encouragement.<br />
0. Do you think the uncertainty of the threat of an election<br />
hanging over you all the time is causing the Westminster<br />
system and our two party or three party system to be a<br />
little less suitable for our day and age now?<br />
Prime Minister: That may well be. There's no question, it is an<br />
aberration to have a Government which is elected for three<br />
years under our system under threat of having to face the<br />
people every six months. This is an aberration and of<br />
course it did last year hinder us quite a lot, but I think<br />
we have got used to it and we are going on as if we have<br />
until the middle of ' 77.<br />
Q. How should the system be changed now in the long term so that<br />
this shouldn't happen again?<br />
Prime Minister: Well, one thing is, of course, that the Constitution<br />
should be changed to requirethat whenever there is an<br />
election for the House of Repyesentatives, there is also an<br />
election for half the Senate. Thereby you bring home to the<br />
Senators, a sense of responsibility. If they decide there is<br />
to be an election for the other House then half of them have<br />
to face an election themselves too. The evil of the present<br />
System is that you can have people deciding there's an election </p>
<p>even although the people making that decision don't have<br />
to face the people themselves. If you synchronise the<br />
elections for the two Houses that will be a very great<br />
improvement a great safeguard.<br />
Q. Mr Whitlam, when things go wrong in the Labor Party and<br />
goodness knows you've had your fair share of troubles<br />
since you've been Prime Minister. When they go wrong,<br />
do you sometimes despair and wonder whether it's worth<br />
all the effort you're putting into it?<br />
Prime Minister: of course.<br />
Q. When was the last time that you've had one of these'downs'?<br />
Prime Minister: I don't know. I'm pretty resilient. I recouperate<br />
fairly quickly. But of course, I and my wife too<br />
sometimes wonder ' is it worth it' but we always decide it is.<br />
Q. Are you a moody person? Some of your colleagues one talks<br />
to around the Parliament say oh, don't go near him<br />
today, he's in such a damn bad mood, sort of thing..... he'll<br />
bite your head off.<br />
Prime Minister: I will bite peoples heads off that's true.<br />
But I get over it very quickly. I'm not a brooding or<br />
vindictive person. I will flare up, sure, but it's soon<br />
over.<br />
Q. But what about moody for a week....<br />
Prime Minister: No, I don't think I'm moody. I sometimes maybe<br />
pensive.<br />
Q. Pensive?... Is the Cabinet system as you've got it now, is it working<br />
well? I mean in those Cabinet meetings that you've had<br />
there are you getting an exchange of views amongst your<br />
Ministers now-a-days?<br />
Prime Minister: It is improving. Obviously they are better than<br />
when they first came in. The Ministry is very much better<br />
as a result of the changes that I made the first<br />
significant changes I made since we got in a thousand<br />
days ago. The 4-hanges I made in July. Now the Minist . y<br />
is very much better as a result of that. We wouldn't have<br />
been able to get so good a Budget as we'vye produced but for<br />
those changes.<br />
Q. But though, you would like this Parliament to run another<br />
two years, three years from...<br />
Prime Minister: Of course it should*.<br />
Q. But in terms of real -pol-itik to use that hackneyed phrase<br />
that it is turning out to be, how long do you really think<br />
the Parliament will run? </p>
<p>3.<br />
Prime Minister: I think it will probably run, I think the chances<br />
are better that it will run till the middle of ' 77 than it<br />
will run only to the middle of ' 76.<br />
Q. Why, do you think Mr Fraser won't have the guts to pull it<br />
on next year?<br />
Prime Minister: No, I don't put it in that way, I'm-not wanting to<br />
have any of that sort of confrontation or brinkmanship.<br />
Malc olm Fraser has got, I think, a better sense of propriety<br />
than his predecessors as leader of the Liberal Party<br />
I think that he looks a bit further ahead because he would<br />
hope to be a Prime Minister himself someday and he would<br />
know that two can play at this game and things can be bad<br />
politically or economically as they have been economically<br />
since we've come in everywhere in the world and a Government<br />
can be deterred from doing the right thing by the fear<br />
that it may have to face the people in the next few months.<br />
I think we've got over that fear a year ago, it's true<br />
enough that we were oppressed by this idea that there might<br />
be an election again at the end of ' 74, there might be in<br />
the middle of ' 75, but we got over that and I think we now<br />
think that the better, the more successful course is to<br />
go for the long haul, you just can't get a quick solution,<br />
you won't get support for trying for a quick solution.<br />
Q. You said two can play at this game does that mean that<br />
you've gone back on your earlier undertaking that you'd<br />
never knock back supply...<br />
Prime Minister: No I haven't, I haven't, that is very strongly<br />
my riew I would still say that if for instance the Labor<br />
Party was in Opposition and I was in the Parliament, I<br />
would still think it improper to use a majority you had in<br />
the Senate or half the numibers because that's all you needhalf<br />
the numbers in the Senate to refuse supply. I had<br />
a big battle in Caucus on that in 1967 I won it and it<br />
is till my view but quite frankly, if Supply was refused<br />
by the Senate a second time, it would obviously be very<br />
much more difficult to keep one's colleagues to the proper*<br />
course thereafter.<br />
0. Your expectations a probability I'm putting words intov your<br />
mouth, I suppose, but the probability is in your mind th't<br />
Supply next year will go through.<br />
Prime Minister: I believe that is probabi x<br />
Q. Sir, with hindsight, Mr Barnard's resignation was that a<br />
mistake politically.<br />
Prime Minister: Ah oh yes, it was obviously in the light<br />
of the result yes.<br />
Q. What about your going overseas last Christmas again with<br />
the benefit of hindsight, was that a mistake politically?<br />
Prime Minister: No, I would do it again, it was time that a Prime<br />
Minister visited countries which-are so economically important </p>
<p>4.9 9,<br />
to us and from which so many migrants have come. I know I<br />
had a terrible blast and the polls were bad but look after<br />
the Terrigal conference, look after the deposition of<br />
Mr Snedden we soared the electorate is very volatile<br />
and I will do what I think is the right thing and one of<br />
the things that a Prime Minister has to do is from time to<br />
time, make overseas visits nobody can represent his<br />
country as effectively as a Prime Minister.<br />
Q. Can. I suggest to you, though, Sir, that because you went on<br />
that trip and the tag is now attached to you -Whitlam<br />
the tripper overseas and that sort of thing -are you<br />
going to have to wear that and wear the effect of it<br />
electorally.<br />
Prime Minister: Maybe I will, and I shall and I don't mind it was<br />
my duty to go. It was time that a Prime minister did visit<br />
some of those countries I mean, we had got on the wrong<br />
foot throughout the 1960s with every member of the Common<br />
Market it was about time that somebody went from Australia<br />
and showed a cooperative attitude.<br />
Q. You haven't committed yourself as to whether or not you'll<br />
be going away this Christmas.<br />
Prime Minister: No, but if I do go, obviously it has to be at a<br />
time when Parliament is not sitting which means one goes at<br />
Christmas or in mid winter.<br />
Q. Would you like to go away again this Christmas?<br />
Prime Minihter: I'd like to, of course, but no arrangements have<br />
been made. If I think I should I shall.<br />
Q. No one would accuse you of being lazy in the job but can<br />
I ask you to ponder on the question of whether or not<br />
you spend your time efficiently, spending as you do,<br />
so much time tripping around Australia giving these<br />
learned discussions and learned papers to these miniscule<br />
audiences in such out of the way places -there's<br />
tomorrow er, where are you going, up to the north coast<br />
of New South Wales, Murwillumbah?<br />
Prime Minister: Yes I am, but I'm not giving a lecture and it won't<br />
be a miniscule audience what happened is, I've been<br />
asked months ago, I was asked if I'd open the new Civic<br />
Centre in Murwillumbah well why not I don't suppose<br />
a lot of people are yet accustomed to the idea of a Prime<br />
Minister arousing interest in local government circles well<br />
my Government has shown a very great interest in local<br />
government, so I've been asked and I'm free to go, and I'll<br />
get pleasure out of it and I would guess that the public<br />
around there will show some interest in it, or even pleasure.<br />
Q. Surely there's more electoral kickback for you that's the<br />
business you're in, of winning votes there's more kickback<br />
for you if you get out on the stump in Sydney or Melbourne<br />
to a big crowd. </p>
<p>Prime Minister: But I do constantly it's true that I would have<br />
been to the outback to remote places, not that Murwillunibah's<br />
terribly remote it's only about an hour and a quarter from<br />
here by air, but it's true that I would have been to<br />
these places more than any other person who's had this<br />
job but after all most of my engagements of course are in<br />
Sydney and Melbourne. And if I give a learned address<br />
as I did last night in Canberra or as I did a fortnight<br />
ago, in Melbourne there'd been hundreds in Canberralast<br />
night a thousand in Melbourne. Sure I put quite a lot<br />
of Work into it but they were important occasions, important<br />
subjects and I'll use the research that I put into it on<br />
these two occasions to other purposes. I know, but you can't<br />
be on the job the whole time, and I can't get any great<br />
relaxation going to a bowling club or that because people<br />
will always say I don't want to talk shop, BUT now I<br />
might as well go where I enjoy it, to some of these<br />
country towns and I've had some excellent days there and I<br />
enjoy it and they seem to.<br />
Q. In politics as in everything else, everyone loves a winner<br />
but do you feel in your own Caucus now that there's a<br />
fair bit of criticism of you in the way you're handling<br />
the job.<br />
Prime Minister: Oh I suppose there is but they seem to be fairly<br />
satisfied that I'm a satisfactory person to lead them.<br />
Q. Only fairly satisfied you're not...<br />
Prime Minitter: Well, you'll think I'm terribly egocentric if I<br />
exgressed the view which I believe they hold of me.<br />
Q. What are your relationships with...<br />
Prime Minister: After all a great number of them wouldn't be there<br />
but for me and they think the best chance of augmenting their<br />
numbers is with me now does that satisfy you?<br />
Q. How does it satisfy the Caucus might be another question.<br />
Prime Minister: Well they've wt shown any dissatisfaction.<br />
. Mml'<br />
Prime Minister: But they're entitled to I welcome, I mean if anybody's<br />
got a complaint about me I'd rather them tell me even in a<br />
Caucus meeting than to bottle up about it.<br />
Q. What are your relationships now like with Mr Rupert Murdoch?<br />
Prime Minister: I haven't seen him for a couple of months actually.<br />
0. Last time you saw him was it-a friendly meeting or...<br />
Prime Minister: Yes, yes always, yes.<br />
Oh, he's a would be politician so like all politicians, we<br />
learn to dissemble. </p>
<p>6.<br />
Q. A would be politician...<br />
Prime Minister: Well, I think that one of the shortcomings of<br />
the media in Australia is that people that run the newspapers<br />
would in fact like to run the country I mean there's<br />
some sad desicated characters like Warwick Fairfax<br />
there are some thrusting ones so far frustrated like<br />
Rupert Murdoch.<br />
Q. What, frustrated because he's not running the country?<br />
Prime Minister: Yes.<br />
0. I see. Sir, you've often expressed your admiration<br />
of the Public Service in many speeches but are some areas<br />
of the Public Service letting your Government down?<br />
Prime Minister: Oh, I wouldn't say that the Public Service is<br />
a superbly competent dedicated lot of people I mean I<br />
know I see the permanent heads and the second division<br />
people and the hours they work and the ideas they come<br />
up with, the way they'll respond to a lead is remarkable.<br />
I think we have done a very good job as a Government a<br />
whole range of issues right basic changes and reformswe<br />
couldn't have done any of them without the assistance<br />
of Public Servants.<br />
Q. Sir, would you rate the State Premiers on a scale between<br />
more uncooperate and the most cooperative.<br />
Prime Min~ ster: Oh, all of them are uncooperative when they beli eve<br />
it suits them.. every one of them. Now I haven't graded<br />
them all I must confess I've got through a few since I<br />
was there.<br />
Since I came in there's been a change of Premier in Western<br />
Australia and in Tasmania and in New South Wales.<br />
Q. Sir, what are the expectations...<br />
Prime Minister: I mean you want me to give a gquite obviously<br />
ah, Mr Dunstan and I have achieved most in cooperation<br />
because Mr Dunstan saw the wisdom and he has benefited<br />
from it in cooperating promptly with the initiatives th'at my<br />
Government has taken in the whole range of activities. 2.-'<br />
Q. Sir, one of the expectations I suggest that a lot of people<br />
placed in you when you came into Government was that you do<br />
away with a lot of the featherbedding and the sectional<br />
interest influence over the process of Government. Things<br />
that came up in the Combes' report the superphosphate<br />
bounty things like that. Now, has the actual system of<br />
Government the two party system and your Caucus system<br />
prevented you from being as thorough in this area as you<br />
would have like to have beeun?<br />
Prime Minister: Oh, of course, it has oh yes, we haven't been<br />
as thorough and as fully rational as we wanted to, and<br />
particularly a year ago there was a loss of morale and<br />
People started handing out hundreds of thousands or in some </p>
<p>cases millions, to prop up industries or particular<br />
companies which had, without justification as it turned<br />
out. At least we did it openly when we gave money<br />
to A. P. P. M., I said well at least put it in an Act of<br />
Parliament don't conceal it. I'm not particularly keen<br />
about it, but if the Opposition is against it, make them<br />
stand up and defeat it well of course they didn't.<br />
Q. We'll just end now, but just to end on, how's Mr Fraser<br />
been going as Opposition leader?<br />
Prime Minister: Magnificently in the media.<br />
Q. How do you think you'll go against him in the...<br />
Prime Minister: I mean in the newspapers in the newspapers<br />
I'm not suggesting in the electronic media Oh, I think<br />
he'll be pretty heavy going in an election you know,<br />
I think it's been shown since the Budget you know, his<br />
first reactions were quite off key to the Taxation reforms<br />
which are the biggest things which have happened in this<br />
field for a quarter of a century he got off on the wrong<br />
foot completely he showed his hand -he showed that<br />
he was still the elitist and still the dyed-in-the-wool<br />
conservative.<br />
Q. Do you think you can beat him?<br />
Prime Minister: Yes give me a campaign and I'll beat him or anybody<br />
else the Liberals put up.<br />
Q. Wall, Mr Whitlam, thank you for appearing on STATE OF THE<br />
NATION tonight.<br />
Prime Minister: Thank you. </p>
