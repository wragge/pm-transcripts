TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING, MP<br />
INTERVIEW WITH JOHN LAWS, 2UE, 4 JUNE 1992<br />
E OE PROOF COPY<br />
JL: I think it might have been weary.<br />
PM: Well we had a week of Parliament and then I had a 7<br />
o'clock breakfast for the Olympic Committee on<br />
Friday, and a lunch time speech to the Tourism Task<br />
Force and a speech at 3 o'clock for the TWU, and<br />
then at 6 o'clock at Parliament House.<br />
JL: You are a stop out aren't you?<br />
PM: Well I can't stay away from it.<br />
JL: I didn't know you were a big party goer like that.<br />
PM: That was just a fund raiser, but by the time Friday<br />
night was over I was just about pooped, and then I<br />
had all this policy stuff which I talked about on<br />
the weekend and which we done this week.<br />
JL: Listen, you realise that the object of this<br />
interview has got nothing to do with the important<br />
running and operation of Australia, it's simply to<br />
let these half-wit journalists know that you and I<br />
are still talking to each other.<br />
PM: We are certainly doing that. Yes, the last time I<br />
had a bit of tucker with you was after that<br />
Balmain/ Canterbury game.<br />
JL: Yes, didn't I do you a favour that night? I<br />
introduced you to Tim Storrier.<br />
PM: You did too and he gave me his tie.<br />
JL: He gave you more than that. He told you how to run<br />
the country.<br />
PM: I know, Yes that's right. I used his tie, but it<br />
camne up so bright green, when I saw the TV play-back </p>
<p>k<br />
2<br />
I thought well that's got to be the last time I use<br />
it.<br />
JL: It's been an amazing few days in Canberra, you must<br />
have made a conscience decision to gain the<br />
initiative?<br />
PM: I had all these things on the go. It's just that we<br />
had all these problems in the Senate a few weeks<br />
ago, but the policy things we had like the<br />
reconstruction of the airlines, that was the merging<br />
of Qantas and -Australian and its sale, the<br />
establishment of a commission to award routes to<br />
another carrier -in this case it will be, amongst<br />
others, Ansett -to build a proper airline system.<br />
And then pay television was something we had on<br />
under debate. During that week you talked about, we<br />
had Parliament sitting and then that busy Friday, I<br />
had all this stuff in the night you see. So we were<br />
already to do it. So I said on Oakes' program on<br />
the weekend this is what we're going to do, and then<br />
this week we've done it.<br />
JL: Yes, obviously you didn't consider it a risk. I<br />
know you like to take the odd one, but you didn't<br />
consider it a big risk to announce it on television<br />
before you talked to Cabinet or Caucus?<br />
PM: It's because we had such extensive ministerial<br />
discussions about these things. None of us can take<br />
it on ourselves and just say we are going this way<br />
or that way. We'd worked all these options up. And<br />
even so, like anybody else if you want to say<br />
something early you've always got to take the risk<br />
of someone not agreeing. But the fact is, the<br />
Cabinet agreed to this and the Caucus. But the<br />
Caucus didn't agree easily and on television we came<br />
to a very good solution in the end one which will<br />
be great for Australian consumers of entertainment,<br />
that's movies, sport, news, and good for the<br />
technology as well.<br />
JL: The airline thing is pretty important and when you<br />
say you've had it on the boil for a while, it hasn't<br />
been there all that long, and I was talking to some<br />
people early this morning, the reaction I get<br />
incidentally from people in the airline industry<br />
that it's absolutely fantastic. But they were<br />
saying to me this morning six months ago Qantas<br />
couldn't even buy one share in Australian that's<br />
how tied up they were. So how were you able to turn<br />
it around so quickly?<br />
PM: We came to the conclusion that selling Australian on<br />
a stand alone basis and selling 49 per cent of<br />
Qantas meant that the Commonwealth of Australia, the<br />
public purse basically was treated pretty poorly<br />
there, we just couldn't get the good prices for </p>
<p>them. But put together the synergies so called, the<br />
operating efficiency gains of the, two companies<br />
running together were quite profound. So Qantas<br />
will now pay the budget $ 400 million for Australian<br />
Airlines and we will float Qantas to the people, and<br />
it will be owned just as we did the Commonwealth<br />
Bank. Remember I did the Commonwealth Bank float?<br />
JL: Yes.<br />
PM: And the shares there?<br />
JL: Yes.<br />
PM: That was one of the most successful floats in our<br />
history. The largest float in Australian history<br />
and the most successful.<br />
JL: How will the average Australian benefit from this<br />
Qantas deal?<br />
PM: For a start Qantas becomes a real airline with a<br />
domestic base and an international base rather than<br />
just a ring fence around Australia so it drops<br />
people at Mascot or Melbourne and it can't fly<br />
domestic routes. That's all finished. Australian<br />
will now be a domestic route flyer and it will than<br />
have that connection to Qantas. And what will<br />
probably happen in the sale process, one of the<br />
world airlines like British Airways or maybe<br />
Singapore, will also buy a piece of the equity so<br />
we'll get an international ' set of linkages out of<br />
it. So you'll be able to go from Wagga to Sydney,<br />
from Sydney to where ever and then link up with BA<br />
or Singapore or whoever bids for Qantas. So Qantas<br />
is going to end up now a major regional carrier and<br />
a world player.<br />
JL: How did you manage to convince those funny fellows<br />
in the Left, and you've got a few funny fellows in<br />
the Left, that this was a right and proper thing to<br />
do and the way a Labor Party should behave?<br />
PM: We are a very plural show John, we're a very plural<br />
outfit. I think they think that we were going to<br />
basically receive very low prices for them, no one<br />
is going to pay you much for 49 per cent of the<br />
company. Australian, you remember, had two bad<br />
years of profit. It had the pilot strike the year<br />
before last and then last year it had the heavy<br />
Compass discounts which cut its profits into loss.<br />
So anyone who could see the blue sky, the upside in<br />
Australian, could see a higher price some years out.<br />
But right now you wouldn't get a high price for it.<br />
But putting the two together the value to Qantas was<br />
quite profound. The other thing is, Ansett which<br />
has been a domestic carrier will now be able to<br />
apply to this new air routes Tribunal, and it will </p>
<p>4<br />
have international routes awarded to it. So we'll<br />
end up with two carriers, two international carriers<br />
not just one. So there will be competition in<br />
international as well as domestic and as well as<br />
that trans Tasman. You will be able to hop on at a<br />
domestic terminal in Sydney and hop off at a<br />
domestic terminal in New Zealand.<br />
JL: Yes all these are very positive things that have all<br />
happened very quickly and I mean it has been an<br />
extraordinary few days. It's been more than a break<br />
through it's been a crash through and you've<br />
convinced people that I would have thought would<br />
have taken a lot of convincing to do things that you<br />
believe are going to be better for Australia. But<br />
it all comes out of a pretty bad period doesn't it?<br />
PM: We got caught up with this problem in the Senate and<br />
Senator Richardson. Look, Richo did nothing<br />
improper. He was unguarded with somebody who was<br />
prepared to prey upon his best instincts, put it<br />
that way. But you see this sort of kangaroo court<br />
routine they do in the Senate these days means it<br />
just gets dragged out, so Richardson said better for<br />
the Government I go. So we put that behind us. But<br />
understand this John, all of this was going on while<br />
all of that was on. It'Is not as if the Government<br />
had stopped, the thing is the Government was going<br />
Or&amp;. The main point is this, there's been more change<br />
since I did the ' One Nation' statement the<br />
rebuilding of the railway system, it's now going on;<br />
the total rnvto-nof the airlines; now our<br />
discussions with the States to rebuild and make a<br />
new technical and further education system for our.<br />
kids. K<br />
JL: Yes, I want to talk to you about that because I<br />
think that's a great idea and obviously it is<br />
required. When you think that there are 50,000 kids<br />
who had the qualifications to get into university<br />
and couldn't because there wasn't room, I mean<br />
that ' s disgraceful.<br />
PM: You see there's more changes in that package than<br />
there was in 15 years of Liberal governments. I<br />
used to sit here for years and nothing like this<br />
would happen. Just on airlines, remember this the<br />
former Liberal goverrnent signed the two airline<br />
agreement, the cosy high fare, high priced two<br />
airline agreement after the writs had been issued<br />
three weeks before the 1983 election and it was<br />
binding on us for 8 years.<br />
JL: Yes, but tell me this why would they have done<br />
that? What was in it for them? </p>
<p>PM: Just a home town decision, just playing to their<br />
mates. One of their mates in those days was Ansett<br />
Airlines.<br />
JL: I see, so really it was jobs for the boys on a grand<br />
scale.<br />
PM: Yes, these guys never broke through the micro<br />
changes. They never did the right things for the<br />
airlined, never did the right things in<br />
telecommunications, never did the right things in<br />
fiscal policy, never tried to internationalise<br />
Australia, sat there like slugs for years. We come<br />
along and in the last 8 years we've totally changed<br />
Australia and we internationalised the place. Now<br />
with low inflation, the lowest inflation rate in<br />
years, and the lowest interest rates.<br />
JL: Just back to the Graham Richardson thing, because<br />
you know my thoughts on that subject. it must be<br />
unbelievably aggravating to have to allow something<br />
like that to happen because of the niggling in the<br />
Senate which really was based on very little, and<br />
proved very little except that I believe as you<br />
believe that he's done nothing untoward. You can't<br />
afford to waste fellows like that can you? Whether<br />
you like him or dislike him, or whether or vote<br />
Labor or whether you vote Liberal, you can't afford<br />
to do without fellows like that.<br />
PM: No, because you see the public system is not<br />
producing enough people of decision making quality,<br />
people who will break the system through. Now in<br />
the Labor Party I think it is true we've been<br />
finding the people, but it's certainly not true in<br />
the Coalition. And the whole political system know<br />
this because the people in it cop so much and wear<br />
so much, so that a lot of the talented people won't<br />
go into public life. The ones that are there having<br />
a go just cop it in the neck all the time.<br />
JL: Ok, well what happens to a bloke like Graham<br />
Richardson? He can't be lost from public life.<br />
PM: No he'll stay as a Sentor. If we win the next<br />
election he'll probably bob up again.<br />
JL: As a Minister?<br />
PM: As a Minister yes.<br />
JL: Would you put him back where he was? He was good.<br />
PM: We'll have to see then where all the positions are,<br />
but he liked the job and he was good at it. He had<br />
the work well in hand at the time he left. Bob<br />
Collins has now taken it up and doing a good job<br />
with it. He was his assistant Minister anyway, and </p>
<p>had aviation for a number of years, and was<br />
representing Kim Beazley in the Senate when Kim had<br />
telecommunications. Bob was across both areas and<br />
was able to take the job quickly.<br />
JL: The job is really too big, both areas?<br />
PM: It is a bit too big, it was part of the ministerial<br />
changes of about three/ four years ago. But it's<br />
become a huge micro-economic reform department and<br />
actually it works well as a micro-reform department.<br />
I've now come to the view that actually if we did<br />
separate them we'd end up with two more conservative<br />
departments than we have in, I think, a department<br />
which is prepared to reform things.<br />
JL: Ok, but when Senator Richardson returns as a<br />
Minister, if you're re-elected, it wouldn't be<br />
unlikely that he'd go back where he was?<br />
PM: It wouldn't be unlikely no. It wouldn't be<br />
impossible. I don't know what he'd like to do. He<br />
might like to do something else. But again, let's<br />
wait and see what happens, he may not exercise that<br />
option.<br />
JL: Yes, you might make him Minister for Sport.<br />
PM: Well.<br />
JL: It's about time we had one.<br />
PM: He might decide being a private member is much nicer<br />
than being a minister. I wouldn't be surprised if<br />
he camne to that conclusion.<br />
JL: I don't know, there are a few advantages.<br />
PM: I had six months on the grass and I enjoyed every<br />
minute of it.<br />
JL: Yes, but a bit tough on the house keeping isn't it?<br />
PM: It's a bit weighty on the house keeping.<br />
JL: When are we really going to get a Minister for Sport<br />
who understands sport? When we had John Brown there<br />
it was fantastic and sport was up high and talked<br />
about and enthused about, that's not happening now.<br />
PM: I don't know. The people going to the Olympics -will<br />
go of f with a $ 10 million budget. Ten years ago<br />
when they went to the Olympics Malcolm Fraser gave<br />
them $ 800,000. So $ 800,000 to S10 million. We're<br />
spending $ 68 million a year on sport this year, in<br />
1983 that was about $ 6 million. So from a<br />
government's point of view we are still pouring a<br />
lot into sport. </p>
<p>JL: Yes, but it's a piddling amount when you think of<br />
the amount you take out in tobacco levies which you<br />
now won't let sponsor sport, and they were doing a<br />
wonderful job sponsoring sport.<br />
PM: Yes, but they were also doing a wonderful job<br />
teaching young kids to smoke, have a drag on a fag,<br />
and that wasn't doing anyone any good either.<br />
JL: No, but you see the evidence in that area is totally<br />
incorrect<br />
PM: You are a beaver on this one.<br />
JL: I mean, you know, it's the opportunists who get in<br />
the ear of people like Roslyn Joan and tell her that<br />
it's naughty to smoke c~ aetss she hangs her<br />
hat on that one, only tell her half of the figures.<br />
The fact Is that those brands that were involved in<br />
sport do sell a lot of cigarettes, but cigarette<br />
increase in older people is greater and they're<br />
buying those brands not young kids, that's all<br />
nonsense.<br />
PM: Well that's not what the data says.<br />
JL: Yes it is. You only see half the data, she only<br />
shows you half the data.<br />
PM: You should sign a nomination form. We could make<br />
you Minister for Sport, in the game.<br />
JL: OK, I thought you might put me in charge of the<br />
Broadcasting Tribunal.<br />
PM: Well Roslyn is flying down to Rio, you know it's<br />
like that old Fred Astaire film ' Flying Down to<br />
Rio'. I don't know whether she'll be tripping the<br />
light fantastic there or not.<br />
JL: Well I don't know. I think a lot of people wouldn't<br />
mind seeing her jump on the wing of an aeroplane.<br />
Remember in ' Flying Down to Rio' when they all stood<br />
on the wing of the aeroplane?<br />
PM: That's right, yes.<br />
JL: Fantastic. Back to more important things, she does<br />
take $ 3 billion out of the revenue excise for<br />
tobacco, so what goes back into sport, really by<br />
comparison, is not a great amount.<br />
PM: Can I just say though, excise revenues the<br />
Commonwealth has got to make up it's revenue whether<br />
it's by income tax, company tax, excises, petrol,<br />
crude oil, whatever. It doesn't mean where it comes<br />
is where it goes back, it never did. That's called </p>
<p>hypothocation, we've never had that. And John until<br />
the Labor Party came along the sports budgets were<br />
no work. I mean everyone in professional sports<br />
knows that.<br />
JL: I agree with that, but we had a good fellow set that<br />
up, John Brown, he sadly got lost to public life as<br />
well. And you see that's the point that people<br />
don't understand. It's the same with you. Like you<br />
or dislike like, vote f or you or not vote for you<br />
the f act is that you'Ire there and all the Australian<br />
people should do their best to get behind you<br />
because you are the Government.<br />
PM: Well at least we try and make things happen, we<br />
don't sit down here on our hands. Australians, I'm<br />
not sure they understand that in the last decade<br />
there has been more change than the previous<br />
years, in terms of the way Australia will function<br />
in the long run. We have set Australia up now as a<br />
low inflation society. Two days ago the Current<br />
Account deficit came out, it's 2 and 3/ 4 per cent of<br />
GDP, it's down to the debt stabilisation point from<br />
6. We are winning now dramatically the current<br />
account battle, we've won the inflation battle.<br />
These were the two scourges on Australia. Sure,<br />
we've had the pain of the recession to go with it,<br />
part of it. But it wasn't just the recession that<br />
pulled inflation down because after the last<br />
recession inflation was 10.5 per cent in early 1983.<br />
After this recession it's 1.5, mainly because of the<br />
Accord and the tax cuts of 1988/ 89 and the wage<br />
outcomes.<br />
JL: Yes, but what about the huge problem of unemployment<br />
particularly with youth?<br />
PM: That's exactly right and I addressed myself to that<br />
subject a day or so ago, and that's why technical<br />
and further education is important. Let me just<br />
give you a little picture about education and kids<br />
and participation. In 1983 John, 3 kids in<br />
completed secondary school. Now how in the hell can<br />
we hope to be a technologically advanced country,<br />
how could you say that you cared for your kids if 3<br />
in 10 only completed secondary school? That's now<br />
nearly 8 in 10 as a * result of this Governments<br />
policies. Forty per cent of those kids then get<br />
into university places.<br />
JL: Yes and can I say this to you, there will be many<br />
who will say, and quite correctly, that a lot of<br />
kids are now staying on longer at school because<br />
they are absolutely aware of the fact that if they<br />
were to leave they wouldn't get a job anyway.<br />
PM: That may be true, that may in part be true, but the<br />
thing is they'll come out with qualifications and </p>
<p>find jobs which are not what John Howard calls dead<br />
end jobs, jobs with low skills.<br />
JL: But how can they do that if 50,000 of them can't get<br />
an education when they are entitled to it by their<br />
qualifications?<br />
PM: Look, let me just say this about tertiary educatin_<br />
about the universitiep. Since 1985 the Government<br />
has added 50 per cent of places to universities.<br />
We've added 120,000 places or the equivalent of 12<br />
universities. Twelve universities with a campus<br />
size of 10,000. That's just a phenomenal rate of<br />
growth in tertiary places. For a country like<br />
ourselves<br />
JL: But it's obviously not enough. I mean you were<br />
there for eight years before?<br />
PM: No, this is from 1985. We were there for two years<br />
before. These other characters who have proceeded<br />
us, 3 kids in 10 completed secondary school. You<br />
can't go to university if you can't even get through<br />
school.<br />
JL: No, but even if these kids are completing secondary<br />
school they still can't get into university.<br />
PM: I'm just saying we added 50 per cent of places. We<br />
put 120,000 extra places into universities and the<br />
proportion of Australian kids going to universities<br />
is now about the average or better than the average<br />
of the OECD. We are at the stage now where our<br />
proportion of the school leaving population going to<br />
university is about right. The problem is TAFE.<br />
The problem is we've got 60 per cent of kids<br />
cascading out of high school, and if the don't go<br />
into technical and further education they go into<br />
sort of milk bars or shopping mall plazas or railway<br />
stations or something.<br />
JL: I suppose somebody has got to do it.<br />
PM: I'm not saying the jobs, I'm saying they just hang<br />
about. The fact is we have an immature technical<br />
and further vocational educational system, that is<br />
people who want to do basic courses to find jobs.<br />
And we're not catering for it, and that's why in the<br />
' One Nation' statement and now Kim Beazley is now<br />
negotiating with the States to develop a mature<br />
technical and further education system. So we end<br />
up like countries like Germany where most kids go<br />
into TAFE and the people who run the big German<br />
companies BMW, Mercedes, Seimens, come out of their<br />
vocational education system, they are not coming out<br />
of universities. The people who actually run those<br />
shows come out of the vocational education area. </p>
<p>JL: Ok, well that's what's got to be rectified here<br />
obviously, but the cry is, and why not, I mean you<br />
rushed through the airline policy and the TV, why<br />
not the initiative on youth unemployment, why not<br />
the TAFE problem being rushed?<br />
PM: Because we've got the dear old States haven't we,<br />
six of them. You know what they're like dragging<br />
them along, you get pulling teeth.<br />
JL: Yes, but you're the boss.<br />
PM: No they're sovereign you see. Under the<br />
Constitution the Commonwealth was not given express<br />
powers over education. The powers reside with the<br />
States. We can only do it through our Financial<br />
Assistance Grant power, it's all carrot and sticksthis<br />
sort of stuff, it's all carrots. So we don't<br />
have a clear power.<br />
JL: But can't you set up, I mean there is talk of you<br />
setting up a form of TAFE to rival the States<br />
anyway?<br />
PM: What we're basically saying to the States is look,<br />
you handle compulsory education, primary and<br />
secondary, we'll handle post compulsory, we'll<br />
handle TAFE and universities. And I made the offer<br />
two days ago that we'll1 not only take over the<br />
funding of TAFE we'll actually take over its<br />
administration. In other words, we'll take from the<br />
States if they wish, the whole burden of technical<br />
and further education and do for TAFE what we did<br />
for university build a solid, mature, high quality<br />
system.<br />
JL: Well when are you likely to get a reply from the<br />
States?<br />
PM: Kim's seeing them within the next day or two again.<br />
But you see, some of them dig in and say look, it's<br />
TAFE one day, what's next? In other words there's<br />
more aggregation of central power they say, we're<br />
against this. And you say well hang on, we're only<br />
a nation of 17 million, there's only one of us so<br />
what's wrong with that? What's wrong with building<br />
a national system of TAFE? And they so oh well,<br />
it's just a further incursion to States rights, and<br />
we say well hang on, that ' s only a line drawn on the<br />
boundary by a bureaucrat in a colonial office in<br />
Britain, let's not get too hung up about it. But<br />
they are hung up about it, so we've now gone one<br />
further than we did in ' One Nation'. In ' One<br />
Nation' we said we'd take over the funding of TAFE<br />
and share the administration. What I said to days<br />
ago is we'll take over the funding of TAFE and the<br />
administration, we'll take the whole burden. Some<br />
States might find that attractive. </p>
<p>JL: But does that mean they all have to find it<br />
attractive?<br />
PM: No, if Victoria gave us a system which I think they<br />
would,, if NSW gave us a system and one or two of the<br />
other states, then we'll just continue to fund them<br />
as we do now, that is joint fund them. But the<br />
growth, if they want to keep it, they'll have to<br />
handle the growth. Not all of it, we'll handle some<br />
of it ourselves, but they'll also handle growth.<br />
JL: This fellow-Arch Bishop Peter Hollingworth, who<br />
didn' t get on too well wf-tK! -F-idiCiEssior<br />
PM: He is a good fellow.<br />
JL: He is a good fellow and he came up with some good<br />
ideas, he reminded us that 30 per cent of the 18 to<br />
year olds who are unemployed often for more than<br />
12 months are out there and they should have<br />
something done with them. He also talked about the<br />
15,000 other young people that you and I have just<br />
discussed, but he also talked about a form of<br />
national service, non-military national service,<br />
voluntary nationaI~ i36 6eet kee-f these'<br />
people up to date with the work ethics so that they<br />
don't sit around doing nothing, so that they are in<br />
fact gainfully employed and making this place a bit<br />
better. Is it not a bad idea?<br />
PM: I spoke at the conference Peter spoke at, his plane<br />
was late so I didn't see him there but he came into<br />
see me yesterday with some other members of the<br />
organisers of that conference and he's given me the<br />
paper he presented with this proposal. I haven't<br />
look at it yet John, but I will.<br />
JL: But there are a lot of unemployed. There are a<br />
million unemployed people in Australian seeking work<br />
and we continue to bring people in from other parts<br />
of the world. Now the perception is that that is<br />
stupid and unfair to the people who, really are the<br />
responsibility of the Government.<br />
PM: But it is a medium term program, well it is a long<br />
term program with a medium term perspective and I<br />
think that the thing about it is, you have got to<br />
decide whether you think this country can take a<br />
share of people from abroad. Is advantaged by a<br />
more diverse and larger population and if you<br />
believe that, a program should exist, and perhaps it<br />
should change in its quality and its quantity as<br />
time goes by, but most governments have changed it<br />
at various times. We had huge numbers come into<br />
Australian and then it dropped of f to much smaller<br />
numbers and it has picked up as prosperity picked<br />
up, and where there have been difficult times it has </p>
<p>dropped back. Can I say the more general point is<br />
by and large I think it has been accepted by most<br />
Australian. The migration program has been good to<br />
Australia, has made it a more interesting place,<br />
made it a more economically robust place. And it<br />
has been very important at various times to<br />
complement skills, the business migration program is<br />
now bringing quite a lot of people from various<br />
parts of the world.<br />
JL: Ah yes, we saw what a rort that was being turned<br />
into by people coming here from Hong Kong and other<br />
places buying real estate and going home, saying<br />
they were unable to make their business investment<br />
and yet that was part of the package.<br />
PM: But there is a lot here though, John, there is a lot<br />
here.<br />
JL: Of course there are and when you say that it has<br />
been accepted I agree with you I think that it has<br />
been accepted. I'm not sure that it is accepted<br />
now, because it has been accepted doesn't mean that<br />
it is going to continue to be accepted.<br />
PM: Well there has always been a debate about the<br />
numbers whenever the economy goes off the boil and<br />
that is fair enough. And I think the Government has<br />
taken note of that and that is why the program has<br />
been scaled back in the last f ew years and we have<br />
got a review of the program underway now. And then<br />
in April, or about April, which is the normal cycle<br />
of these reviews, we will consider the intake again<br />
for the coming year.<br />
JL: What is your recommendation?<br />
PM: Well I will wait and see what the review turns up.<br />
JL: Well assessing it at this stage, you see, you say<br />
that most people accept it. Most people that I talk<br />
to don' t accept it and I think that, with respect to<br />
you, I speak more of the population of Australia<br />
than you do.<br />
PM: You certainly speak to them, whether you speak with<br />
them I'm not sure about that.<br />
JL: Well they speak to me.<br />
PM: Well that's true, that's true.<br />
JL: They pick up the telephone and dial the number.<br />
PM: That is right. I don'It doubt that you have a<br />
perception, and probably a correct one, that people<br />
think the program should respond to difficult times,<br />
and I think it should. </p>
<p>JL: Shouldn't you respond to the people?<br />
PM: Yes, but I'm not going to pre-judge what is a<br />
reasonably sophisticated process of review every<br />
year, and then the Minister, in this case Gerry<br />
Hand, will bring a recommendation to the Cabinet.<br />
JL: But on the information you have know, what would<br />
your recommendation be?<br />
PM: Well I'm not going to make a recommendation. I<br />
won't be recommending. It will be Gerry<br />
recommending to the Government rather than me<br />
recommending to him. But the program has been<br />
coming back and I would be surprised if there was a<br />
discernible trend in any other direction.<br />
JL: But down?<br />
PM: But down? But when I say that,' I don't mean down<br />
the way some of our colleagues in the Opposition<br />
mean down because I think from them we will see a<br />
repeat of what we saw in 1988 which was basically<br />
about how we shouldn't have more Asians here, we<br />
shouldn't have Asians in this country. I mean, if<br />
you scratch most of these characters what you get is<br />
a little bit of that sort of talk from them and that<br />
won't be motivating us.<br />
JL: No. Well of course it is not specifically Asians,<br />
its people that we have to employ, that is the<br />
problem, it doesn't matter where they come from.<br />
PM: I know, I understand that but from the Liberal<br />
Party's point of view the sub-plot in the late 1980s<br />
was about Asians.<br />
JL: OK, prior to my going away in December, I read a<br />
story about a pie manufacturer who warned us that<br />
the great Australian meat pie might soon ship to<br />
China, tasty products, warned that high labour<br />
costs, high taxes expensive food ingredients would<br />
force lots of businesses off-shore. Now it didn't<br />
seem very important at the time, but when you look<br />
into it, in china's Xnandung Province they will give<br />
you the land to build your factory. They will<br />
provide you with labour at $ A16O a month and offer a<br />
flat company tax rate of 16 per cent. Now the SA160<br />
a month is nonsense in this country. But why don't<br />
we consider doing things like they are doing in<br />
China. We have got plenty of land why don't we give<br />
it to people in order that they can create<br />
enterprises and businesses here. And why don't we<br />
offer them a special company tax to come in from<br />
other parts of the world instead of us going of fshore,<br />
bring them here give them the land we have<br />
got plenty of land? </p>
<p>PM: Well the thing is, they are a developing country and<br />
they are re doing all the classic things which<br />
developing countries have done. you know, Korea was<br />
doing that some time ago, and now they are doing it.<br />
I'm sure it happened in Taiwan.<br />
JL: Do we ever give land away, I never heard it was<br />
giving land away?<br />
PM: No we don I don'It think. I mean, certainly the<br />
Commonwealth doesn't. But I mean, the States have<br />
industrial parks and they let people have access to<br />
them.<br />
JL: When I say giving away, I don' t mean give it away<br />
forever. Give a lease arrangement to these people,<br />
but at a proper rate to encourage business to come<br />
here, why don't we do that?<br />
PM: Well, because I think it is important to understand<br />
what we are. This is a developed place. We run a<br />
sophisticated society and public sector. services<br />
here are in evidence wherever you look, whether it<br />
be hospitals, roads, or railways, or what have you.<br />
And we finance this public sector with the second<br />
lowest rate of tax in the world bar a decimal point.<br />
We are a decimal point higher than Japan. We are<br />
the second lowest tax country in the 27 countries of<br />
the OECD. now you can't provide this sort of public<br />
sector with these sort of services and this standard<br />
of living with the tax rate very much below that.<br />
So if you want to give big tax breaks to developing<br />
companies, what you have got to do is put tax hikes<br />
on ordinary people.<br />
JL: Why can't it be done for a short period of time?<br />
PM: Well it all costs and once you do these things, that<br />
is it. you set a new benchmark. I mean, you can't<br />
compete with them because you see<br />
JL: Why can't you?<br />
PM: Well let me just give you an example. Now I was<br />
talking to a company last week. They went to<br />
Malaysia because it had a tax holiday for 7 years<br />
so they said we set up a business in Malaysia<br />
unfortunately they said the 7th year is up so now we<br />
are going to Sri Lanka which promises a tax holiday<br />
for 15 years. That is no tax f or 15 years. Well if<br />
we try and run this country on a basis of no tax for<br />
years, you won't keep this sort of society of<br />
ours together.<br />
JL: No, but this is a more attractive place to be so<br />
surely with some sort of incentive. </p>
<p>PM: But we don't need to do the things which those<br />
people, in other words, rely upon wage rates and<br />
labour conditions that those companies rely upon in<br />
those countries. We produce different things.<br />
JL: But we need to do something.<br />
PM: We are doing it. We literally exported our heads<br />
of f all through the 1980s.<br />
JL: You can't say that because we are developed country<br />
that we don't want to continue to develop.<br />
PM: No, but all the developed countries, we have got a<br />
corporate tax rate of 39 per cent with full dividend<br />
imputation. In other words, you don't pay tax on<br />
dividends twice. Germany has got a corporate rate<br />
in the ' 50s. most of the countries we compare<br />
ourselves with have got corporate rates like us,<br />
Britain, the United States, what have you. They<br />
don't have 15 per cent tax rates. Or zero tax rates<br />
as business incentives because they are developed<br />
places and you can't run your developed society on<br />
zero tax rates.<br />
JL: OK, well if we can't do that for people who want to<br />
create businesses from other parts of the world,<br />
what sort of incentive could we offer to the people<br />
who are one by one going to the wall, and they are<br />
one by one going to the wall, here in Australian.<br />
Surely at this time, we should be offering them some<br />
kind of incentive to keep their. business instead of<br />
taking it to Sri Lanka or Singapore.<br />
PM: Well the best incentive offered to them is growth,<br />
is to get back to rates of growth and that is what<br />
the point of the Economic Statement will be about.<br />
to restore growth to the economy, to get the economy<br />
out of the recession.<br />
JL: How do you do that?<br />
PM: Into recovery. Well it won't be long before you<br />
will see. But we are now assessing how best to do<br />
that, but one of the things which we have obviously<br />
done in the last two years is reduce interest rates,<br />
which themselves will have their effect upon the<br />
economy and we will be doing other things which we<br />
think are sensible in the short term but are also<br />
supportive, if you like, of the structure of the<br />
place over the long term.<br />
JL: Like what sort of thing?<br />
PM: Well I don't want to go through<br />
JL: Well just give me an idea of what sort of thing? </p>
<p>PM: Well some of the public infrastructure, for a start,<br />
which was left to languish in the ' 80s as we cut the<br />
public sector back, and which can take the place of<br />
some of the private investment we're now not<br />
getting. In some of those areas we'Ire looking<br />
closely now.<br />
JL: Does that mean increasing the public sector?<br />
PM: Not particularly, but it means for the moment in<br />
areas of public infrastructure where there are<br />
needs, and where they are an important part of the<br />
efficiency of the economy, then they are areas I<br />
think which we can look. But the main thing is to<br />
provide growth to the economy and that's the best<br />
thing we can give the business sector, small, medium<br />
and large. And there's not much point in saying<br />
well here's a low tax rate, but sorry there's not<br />
much growth around, because if you look at the small<br />
business community in particular, both them survive<br />
on growth.<br />
JL: By growth, you simply mean that somebody who has,<br />
they're making matchboxes, you're going to make the<br />
place so ef ficient that people are going to want to<br />
buy more matchboxes?<br />
PM: Well we're finding, firstly to lift activity and<br />
demand so theres a demand for product in Australia<br />
and people start hiring people again to produce<br />
product.<br />
JL: How do you do that?<br />
PM: Just by lifting activity. We did it after 1983-4,<br />
JL: Well if it was that simple why wasn't it done<br />
before?<br />
PM: Well in 1983-84, when we came to office after that<br />
recession, we turned it around within about 12<br />
months. And I hope that in the same way we can do<br />
that now.<br />
JL: We'll have to do it quickly because from what I<br />
hear, and correct me if I'm wrong, but from what I<br />
hear from business people we are not in a position<br />
to be able to trade competitively with other<br />
countries, we are disadvantaged here in Australia?<br />
PM: I don't think that's true. Because what is<br />
happening and has happened, we are now running a<br />
very large goods and services surplus, we are<br />
running a huge merchandise trade surplus. A lot of<br />
Australian companies I have spoken to in the last<br />
two weeks have said, we've made a shift, because the<br />
domestic market is down we've made a more rapid<br />
shift to exports and we'll stay in exports. Now we </p>
<p>are doing that because the place is largely<br />
competitive, its competitive in wage rates, its<br />
competitive by the exchange rate, its a generally<br />
competitive product that I'm will to support.<br />
JL: Well, why are we in recession?<br />
PM: Well we are in a recession in the domestic economy,<br />
while the international economy is also not doing<br />
well, the truth is we can eat a bigger share of it<br />
and that's one of the things which is at least<br />
holding employment where it is and keeping the place<br />
growing where it is is the fact that we have a thing<br />
which we never used to have called net exports. In<br />
other words we are now exporting a large part of our<br />
product, particularly in manufactures.<br />
JL: OK that's fine, and I understand it is very<br />
important but its very hard to convince people who<br />
haven't got any money and have got kids, and they<br />
haven't got any clothes and they are flat out having<br />
a house, that because somebody is selling something<br />
overseas its going to be to their advantage, its not<br />
to their advantage now. Surely the domestic<br />
economy, as you refer to it, is at this stage in<br />
your career and in the history of this country the<br />
most important thing?<br />
PM: Absolutely.<br />
JL: Well what do you do about that? It's all very well<br />
to talk about the exports<br />
PM: Well, exports are what give you production and there<br />
would be a lot of people employed in factories out<br />
there now, probably listening to us, who are doing<br />
so for products which are going to be exported, and<br />
if they were not going to be exported their jobs<br />
wouldn't be there. So exports have filled a very<br />
large void in this cycle and that's why these export<br />
growth numbers and the merchandise trade surplus is<br />
very important to us, they are complementary to<br />
domestic growth.<br />
JL: Well its not working<br />
PM But it doesn't invalidate your point and that is<br />
that the domestic economy has to grow more, we can't<br />
have the thing, if you like, in the negative, that<br />
is contracting which is what its been. It's<br />
contracted by about three per cent in the last year<br />
and a half or so. And that's what's produced the<br />
angst and produced the unemployment. We have got to<br />
get that back to positive rates of growth.<br />
JL: OK well how do you do that domestically? </p>
<p>PM: Well a combination of I think, a change in<br />
confidence which comes from a willingness on part<br />
the of the Government to let the economy grow. That<br />
people in the business community know now that the<br />
Government wants the economy to grow. Where in 1988<br />
and 1989 and 1990 they thought the Government wanted<br />
the economy to slow down which we did. We now want<br />
it to grow, and we have now provided one of the<br />
instruments of that growth, much lower interest<br />
rates, and we can provide a more direct stimulus to<br />
the economy coming from the Governments own<br />
policies, and that's what we are now examining with<br />
the business community as to how best to cast those<br />
so they complement, if you like, interest rate<br />
reductions. To try to induce and engender a high<br />
degree of business confidence to get people out<br />
there spending again and to pick the place up.<br />
JL: Prime Minister Paul Keating back to the subject of<br />
Australia and its immediate future domestically, and<br />
I think that you agree that that's what matters at<br />
the moment. Certainly that's what matters to the<br />
people listening to this radio program around<br />
Australia.<br />
PM: Exactly. To get back to growth and to get the place<br />
moving again, to get employment shifting and to do<br />
it as quickly as possible. That's got to be our<br />
first priority.<br />
JL: ' OK you can understand the frustration of people and<br />
confusion of people when you can go into a<br />
supermarket and you can buy imported canned<br />
tomatoes, I think from Italy, cheaper than you can<br />
buy the Australian product. So here we have the<br />
dilemma of the people who are doing to tough having<br />
the opportunity to buy the product cheaply but we<br />
also have the converse situation of those producing<br />
the product here in Australia not being able to<br />
compete. Why do we import canned tomatoes?<br />
PM: I think a number of reasons. I mean it makes me<br />
furious as it does you I'm sure. It does make you<br />
furious because its just absurd but I think we<br />
really haven't developed as well as we might<br />
agriculture businesses which extend beyond the<br />
agriculture into canning and into promotion and into<br />
the efficient production of canned products often<br />
particularly in the horticulture/ agriculture sort of<br />
fruit and vegetables.<br />
JL: Is that because we are not smart?<br />
PM: Well I don't know. I think it might be the fact<br />
that a lot of these were done through co-operatives<br />
in the past and the co-operatives flourished well<br />
enough before the trade in these things world wide,<br />
there's now a greater trade in food products and </p>
<p>that we haven't seen the sort of efficiency and<br />
competitiveness coming from the canning of these<br />
sort of foods and their marketing.<br />
JL: OK, well what do you do ' about that? I mean why..<br />
PM: Its a sort of breakdown of entrepreneurship. I mean<br />
there should be in that particular industry more<br />
entrepreneurship I think than there is and its a<br />
pity that people say well its not a pity you saying<br />
it but its a pity its being said, you know what can<br />
we do about the fact that we have got sort of canned<br />
tomatoes from the United States or Italy or Israel<br />
or somewhere like that and you know, I think one of<br />
the things we can do well in Australia is food and<br />
food processing.<br />
JL: In order to let us do that, and I know that this is<br />
a simplistic point of view but most of mine are, why<br />
can't we put some type of moratorium on nonessential<br />
imports?<br />
PM: Well because what happens then is that people put a<br />
moratorium on our non-essential exports. The<br />
trading world is a very nasty place and once you get<br />
into sort of trade reprisals everybody gets into<br />
you. I mean we are still shipping great stacks of<br />
meat to the United States and Japan and if we were<br />
to say<br />
JL: But why are we doing that, because Japan needs it,<br />
that's why they're buying it.<br />
PM: Yes but they can buy it from other places and<br />
JL: And because America needs it<br />
PM: But again it has got other options. I mean if we<br />
get into the trade reprisal business so will they<br />
and that's not a goer and the fact is we have got to<br />
do better. It's not their fault that we are not<br />
doing better, in some of these areas we have just<br />
got to do better. Now its happening. You can see<br />
it, I was talking to one chap last week in these<br />
rounds of consultations who has brought together a<br />
whole lot of food products and is now marketing them<br />
much more efficiently in Australia. These were<br />
formerly brand names which had sort of been left by<br />
the way-side, business which were not running<br />
efficiently but making largely food stuffs. Now<br />
that's changed for that particular person and his<br />
business and for those products. And that general<br />
change is what we need. In other words you see an<br />
opportunity and go and exploit it, not just to say<br />
well look we can actually import compete, compete<br />
against these imports but actually export them<br />
ourselves. </p>
<p>JL: But are you going to encourage people to do it<br />
because the number of people that come to me<br />
directly and indirectly to tell me that they have<br />
had a wonderful idea that they've wanted to start a<br />
business doing something here in Australia, and have<br />
been unable to get co-operation from the Government<br />
and they end up doing it elsewhere and successfully.<br />
Now what are you going to do about that?<br />
PM: Well I think it's happening I mean you know and<br />
again another company I spoke to last week has just<br />
taken over Petersville, this is Pacific-Dunlop has<br />
just taken over Peteraville which is a big food<br />
producer and that includes Edgell and all those<br />
business Edgell, you know, peas and beans and these<br />
things<br />
JL: and tomatoes<br />
PM: and hopefully now with a larger company, a greater<br />
understanding of the value of the product it<br />
produces, its capacity to sell into the largely<br />
growing South-East Asian market, we will see now the<br />
marketing of those products but we haven't seen<br />
enough of the export opportunities being obvious to<br />
people, investing in them, getting an existing<br />
business and making it more efficient, marketing the<br />
things better in Australia, I mean its often true of<br />
the large supermarket, they have often said to me<br />
you can't get people to quote the supply a lot of<br />
the food lines that just don't quote because they<br />
think they will get too tied up to Coles or too<br />
tired up to Woolworths so they don't quote and so<br />
what happens they end up taking stuff from Italy or<br />
from Portugal or somewhere like that.<br />
JL: Would the Government be in a position to subsidise<br />
producers of those kinds of products that have<br />
unfair competition if it is considered unfair from<br />
overseas?<br />
PM: Well, we don't subsidise agricultural produce in<br />
Australia.<br />
JL: I know we don't, but why don't we?<br />
PM: Well because when we do it becomes a cost on the<br />
rest of us. In other words, you know, I mean we are<br />
getting the very thing we are complaining about in<br />
the GATT. I mean the reason why our wheat producers<br />
are not being able to sell now as profitably in the<br />
markets is because of subsidies from the European<br />
Commission and the United States. Now if we get in<br />
the same game the thing is they can outplay us at<br />
that game, theres no point in us getting in.<br />
JL: Then we can't compete? </p>
<p>PM: We don't have a deep enough pocket to go into an<br />
export subsidy war and wouldn'It want to.<br />
JL: OK well let's get back to..<br />
PM: And that's why, can I just say in the GATT in the<br />
Uruguay round, the General Agreement on Trade and<br />
Tariffs where all this is being discussed at the<br />
moment, we're saying keep the markets free from<br />
pollution, keep them open, keep them free from this<br />
export subsidies, give the honest producer a chance.<br />
Now if we were to say well look, forget all that<br />
rhetoric we didn't really mean that what we are<br />
going to do now is start subsidising canned tomatoes<br />
and canned this and something else then the whole<br />
game goes bad and I think it will work against<br />
Australia over the long term.<br />
JL: So what do we do? Stop canning tomatoes and do<br />
something else?<br />
PM: No. Do it ef ficiently. What we should do is<br />
someone say look I've got a tomato here which is as<br />
good as any other tomato, I can put in a can for<br />
this price providing I have an ef ficient business<br />
JL: Yes but then you have difficulty doing it because of<br />
work practices and all sorts of added tariffs here.<br />
PM: Well the good management smooths all those things<br />
out. I mean the huge shift in productivity which we<br />
are seeing in businesses today is coming from the<br />
fact that good managers getting rid of work<br />
practices which are bad. See, a good management<br />
which actually make any of these businesses<br />
competitive.<br />
JL: Despite the trade union movement?<br />
PM: Not despite them, with their support. I mean by and<br />
large the trade unions are knocking out restrictive<br />
work I mean if there's one thing which has come<br />
through four to three days of very intense meetings<br />
now is the almost every hour declaration by managers<br />
of major companies and small companies of the<br />
changes in enterprise bargaining and workplace<br />
reform.<br />
JL: Because the union movement is becoming more cooperative?<br />
PM: Yes absolutely because they are saying lets not only<br />
keep our jobs lets make the place better.<br />
JL: What about the 17.5% holiday loading which is a<br />
laugh, and laughed at all over the world? </p>
<p>PM: Well a lot of other places in the world have got it<br />
to, its in the United States<br />
JL: Not at 17.5t its not.<br />
PM: Well its every higher I think in some places.<br />
JL: But that doesn't make it right?<br />
PM: Well you know why its there, because most people<br />
earned, often earn in their normal working week more<br />
than the standards weekly wage because they get a<br />
bit of overtime<br />
JL: Some, some not all<br />
PM: So when they go on holidays there is a compensation.<br />
JL: Yes<br />
PM: This is a feature of many, many economies.<br />
JL: But the man who introduced it even says its stupid<br />
now. A bit late now but he even says its stupid<br />
now.<br />
PM: Who said that?<br />
JL: Clyde Cameron.<br />
PM: Clyde, well I didn't know he said that but look the<br />
main thing is labour costs in total and labour costs<br />
in total in Australia now by OECD standards are low.<br />
I mean its another thing that has been said over and<br />
over again in the last three or four days in the<br />
last week by people running businesses, look this is<br />
now basically a low labour cost country. John that<br />
is the truth, this is a low labour cost country<br />
which includes holiday leave loading.<br />
JL: Well it is and that's why Japanese motor companies<br />
and others want to set up large factories here<br />
because it is becoming a low labour country.<br />
PM: And that includes the holiday leave loading on these<br />
things.<br />
JL: Yes, it would be better still if we didn't have the<br />
holiday leave loading though wouldn't it?<br />
PM: Well I don't necessarily think that's right. I mean<br />
I think, you know, if someone goes of f on their<br />
annual leave they don't take a big drop in pay.<br />
JL: What about penalty rates on the week-end though?<br />
For working Saturday's, whoever said that Saturday<br />
is different from Friday or Thursday? </p>
<p>PM: Well, now this is an old hobby horse one of yours I<br />
know, I know.<br />
JL: Its a good one<br />
PM: You're like a dog at a bone on these penalty rates.<br />
Look, they are changing, they are changing over<br />
time, they perhaps should change more slowly in some<br />
places I agree particularly in the hospitality<br />
industry but I think a bit of that is changing.<br />
JL: Are you going to encourage the change?<br />
PM: Well part of my job now is to make this a<br />
competitive labour cost country and I did that<br />
across the board, it was part of my job in the 1980s<br />
to get inflation down, we have now got a 31<br />
inflation rate instead of a 10% inflation rate and<br />
that was in a large part accommodated by shifts in<br />
wages so its not my job to run bull-at-a-gate at one<br />
particular thing<br />
JL: But nobody wants you to do that, but could we<br />
receive some sort of guarantee that you will give<br />
your careful consideration to penalty rates?<br />
PM: Your a great one on guarantees you are.<br />
JL: Yes its very important its very important to me<br />
and penalty rates stop people getting work.<br />
PM: Well look, I can see that the structure of penalty<br />
rates are not always conducive to employment and<br />
productivity but changing them is not a simple<br />
matter the Government particularly can change<br />
overnight.<br />
JL: No but you've got friends.<br />
PM: Yes well I hope I've got a few.<br />
JL: Have a quite talk to Bill.<br />
PM: Poor old Bill, you'd get him to do everything.<br />
JL: Well I mean he is the man to do it because by having<br />
those.<br />
PM: Well you get him in, next time you get him in you<br />
put it on him.<br />
JL: OK I will but in the meantime you might put in a<br />
word for me because you're keeping young people out<br />
of work and the same thing in the United States. If<br />
you want to go to a restaurant in the evening or at<br />
lunch time you drive up the to the restaurant, get<br />
out of your car somebody parks it. </p>
<p>9<br />
24<br />
PM: Look the whole service sector in the United States<br />
is far more<br />
JL: Fantastic?<br />
PM: Sophisticated than here<br />
JL: That's right<br />
PM: And we have got to learn to be like that.<br />
JL: Ok and people are doing it Saturday nights, Sunday<br />
nights and their lunch time and they're doing it for<br />
what they get in tips. No you couldn't do that in<br />
Australia because you would have to join the<br />
Transport Workers Union before you could drive the<br />
bloody car. Now that's stupid isn't it.<br />
PM: Well I think that the proof of the pudding is in the<br />
eating. They have a service sector which is a vast<br />
employer, I mean we do to but theirs is greater and<br />
the services are more varied and more sophisticated.<br />
JL: But you see a bunch of young kids could set up valet<br />
parking as they insist on calling it in America, and<br />
be contributors to the economy but making money and<br />
keeping them gainfully occupied instead of hanging<br />
around sticking needles in their arms, but they<br />
can't do it because of some stupid work practice or<br />
having to belong to some union and pay union fees.<br />
PM: Well that's not necessarily true. I mean a lot of<br />
people are working in places which are not<br />
unionised. It doesn't stop people working.<br />
JL: How long do you think it would take before the TWU<br />
wasn't down on people who set up valet parking<br />
outside restaurants? About a day and a half?<br />
PM: No, no I don't think its going to worry the TWU very<br />
much. The truth is as long as it doesn't happen<br />
because it hasn't occurred to people. I mean we<br />
just don't have these sort of services here. I mean<br />
in the US<br />
JL: It has occurred to me.<br />
PM: I know because you travel and you experience it.<br />
But you can see there was a time when there wasn't<br />
propriety car parks, you know car parks operated as<br />
businesses in Australia that happened in the United<br />
States many, many decades ago, its been with us a<br />
couple of decades only and I think, you know, we<br />
will see a much greater sophistication in services,<br />
personal care things.<br />
JL: Ok but you can only do that with the co-operation of<br />
the trade union movement? </p>
<p>PM: John don't underestimate the co-operation. I mean<br />
we are seeing, this is not rhetoric, we're seeing<br />
now such mammoth changes in productivity and work<br />
place reform the likes of which most businesses<br />
could not have contemplated a decade ago, could<br />
never have contemplated and it is why Toyota is<br />
coming to Australia. Toyota motor company, probably<br />
amongst the most ef ficient in the world and which is<br />
going to set up a $ 400M state of the art plant in<br />
this country. It's not doing it because it thinks<br />
labour relations are bad, they know that<br />
productivity is good, they know that the trade<br />
unions are co-operating and we are making great<br />
strides.<br />
JL: That's right, but I have watched the progress of<br />
that from fairly close quarters and its been<br />
interesting to note the reaction of the trade union<br />
movement who have been more than co-operative. Now<br />
obviously they are smart because Toyota obviously<br />
are going to employ a lot of people in Australia,<br />
now that kind of co-operation is the sort of thing<br />
that will help to get the place back. But it means<br />
that the unionists, the trade union movement has got<br />
to co-operate with the Government doesn't it?<br />
PM: It does and what I'm saying to you is that it has,<br />
and that's why the inflation rate is 3% and that's<br />
why interest rates are<br />
JL: Ok but tell my why.<br />
PM: If inflation was 10% interest rates would be 13/ 14.<br />
JL: Its great to have 3% inflation. One of the reasons<br />
it is three per cent is nobody is spending any money<br />
and one of the reasons is nobody's got any money.<br />
PM: The main reason is wage change in the 80s and the<br />
second reason is, in part, the deflation coming from<br />
the recession. But its only a part, a very large<br />
part, the largest part was a decline in inflation<br />
coming from wage changes.<br />
JL: Yes, but obviously inflation is going to be low if<br />
nobody has got any money to spend.<br />
PM: Well, that ' s not true. We came out of the 1982-83<br />
recession flat on our backs with a 10% inflation<br />
rate.<br />
JL: That's true. What about the engineering company<br />
that can buy Australian made BHP steel cheaper in<br />
Singapore than it can buy it in Australia? That's<br />
slightly bigger than tomatoes. </p>
<p>PM: True and I think we need competition in steel like<br />
we do in everything else and I think it is a great<br />
pity that we have to import certain varieties of<br />
steels because they are not available here.<br />
JL Yes but this is Australian made BHP steel which can<br />
be brought cheaper in Singapore $ 700 a ton in<br />
Singapore, $ 1000 a ton here. Now how can you allow<br />
that to happen? Not that its your direct<br />
responsibility.<br />
PM: No its not my responsibility, but look obviously, I<br />
don't know that the numbers are actually right I can<br />
only take your word for those.<br />
JL: Well do.<br />
PM: It may be its been part of an export deal, a package<br />
deal which BHP has done a sort of shop deal for<br />
steel to some supplier in South-East Asia which they<br />
are now supplying back. But I'd be surprised, well<br />
pretty surprised if you could buy BHP steel cheaper<br />
abroad than you buy it here.<br />
JL: Well you can, you can buy it in Singapore for $ 700 a<br />
ton as opposed to $ 1000 a ton here.<br />
PM: Well no doubt that someone in BHP will hear this<br />
conversation and give us an answer.<br />
JL: If the answer is yes that is a fact, what can you do<br />
about it?<br />
PM: Well I think BHP would say it seeks to be<br />
competitive inside the Australian economy and<br />
supplying product. The complaint against it is it<br />
doesn't supply enough product, enough of various<br />
types of product that it should, but there is no<br />
doubt the export markets are very competitive and if<br />
you'ye got people saying, well look you can have an<br />
Australian job at BHP we export steel but we've got<br />
to export it cheaper than we have been exporting it<br />
then BHP will probably taken the view that we want<br />
to keep that employment and we want to keep those<br />
exports. So its losing profitability and margin<br />
exporting but better to have the product export and<br />
have the jobs than not have it all and that's<br />
probably the position right now.<br />
JL: Yes except they are paying the price here in<br />
Australia and obviously they are going to suffer<br />
long term because people are simply bringing it back<br />
from Singapore cheaper than they can get in<br />
Australia.<br />
PM: Well look, I mean the international steel market is<br />
now becoming over supplied, it is very competitive </p>
<p>out there and there is not there is probably price<br />
falls and theres discounting in all markets.<br />
JL: There's a dreadful expression that has come into our<br />
language and that I hope you'll never use, when<br />
people talk about a level playing field which seems<br />
to be all the go, why are we doing that with a level<br />
playing field when nobody else seems to be?<br />
PM: I' don'It think we are. I mean, I think anyone who<br />
believes there's a level playing field off-shore<br />
outside of Australia is basically deluding<br />
themselves, I mean its catch as catch can out there<br />
and survival of the fittest and the smartest and I<br />
think that if anyone believes it is fair and<br />
reasonable and above board and level they are having<br />
themselves on.<br />
JL: Ok well we are about to run out of time and I know<br />
you have got a lot to do with your day jut to rap it<br />
up, the illegal immigrants, these boat people, apart<br />
from costing us a fortune in searching, if we find<br />
out that they are not what they claim to be will you<br />
send them home?<br />
PM: Well I don't want to pre-judge that.<br />
JL: Would that be your desire?<br />
PM: I don't want to pre-judge that let's wait and see<br />
how they interview, where they're from, what their<br />
claims are and there's a very clear process there in<br />
dealing with people who cross our borders and there<br />
is no reason why that process won't work just as<br />
well on this occasion as on any other occasion.<br />
JL: So it would be likely that if they are not what they<br />
appear to be that they won't stay in this country?<br />
PM: Well again that is pre-judging them and I don't want<br />
to do that because to do it in the position I hold,<br />
prejudice is their position, and the processes are<br />
such that they shouldn't be prejudiced.<br />
JL: Ok the other point, when you assess immigration in<br />
April it won't rise?<br />
PM: Well I'm not saying that<br />
JL: No I was asking.<br />
PM: The trend has been down, the trend has been down but<br />
that is not the dissimation of the program which<br />
some people wish and it won't be and it won't be<br />
motivated by crude political instincts like we have<br />
seen from the Liberal Party in the late 1980s and<br />
which we are seeing a bit of now. In other words we<br />
will be looking at the long run future of the </p>
<p>Australian population, its growth, a contribution of<br />
the migration program and looking at the labour<br />
market and the capacity to absorb people in that<br />
market, to house them and making a j udgement about<br />
the intake for the following year.<br />
JL: OK but in the present circumstances being as they<br />
are, would it be reasonable to say that it is<br />
unlikely that it will rise?<br />
PM: Well it hasn't for the last couple of years. It's<br />
unlikely to rise this year.<br />
3L: Ok something else that I think we should touch upon<br />
briefly. Will you be doing something to restore<br />
confidence for the job getters in Australia quickly?<br />
PM: Well that this the whole point of what I'm doing<br />
now, that is trying to make sure whatever the<br />
Government does that is what we announce, when the<br />
statement is announced, that we have assessed as<br />
fully as we can with business and with other groups<br />
in the community the likely measures to have the<br />
greatest and earliest impact upon activity and<br />
employment.<br />
JL: Will the dole rise?<br />
PM: Well that's not an issue which we are examining<br />
right now but the question I think is not a matter<br />
of the dole rising its activity rising is what we<br />
need. We need basically more people being employed<br />
and that can only come from producing more product<br />
and that means getting confidence going, getting<br />
people confident again about the economy that they<br />
think there is a future out their. We actually face<br />
a good 1990s in many respects low inflation, lot<br />
of good structural things there's no reason why this<br />
country can't get back to decent rates of growth and<br />
more satisfying levels of employment.<br />
JL: Prime Minister thank you very much for your time and<br />
let's hope we can talk again very soon.<br />
PM: Thank you John.<br />
