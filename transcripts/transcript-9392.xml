PRIME MINISTER<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
ASIA LECTURE TO THE ASIA-AUSTRALIA INSTITUTE<br />
BRISBANE, 26 OCTOBER 1994<br />
I wanted to give this speech in Brisbane, and I wanted to give it to the Asia-<br />
Australia Institute, because in their respective areas of government and<br />
education Wayne Goss and Stephen Fitzgerald are showing the way forward<br />
for Australia and its institutions in dealing with the region around us.<br />
From the start, the Asia-Australia Institute has been working to bring together<br />
the emerging leaders of the region from Government, business and<br />
universities in order to shape the region and help to create an ' Asia<br />
consciousness', not just to stand back and comment on developments.<br />
Similarly, among our state Governments, Wayne Goss and his colleagues<br />
have been pre-eminent among those working to strengthen ties with Asia and<br />
the Pacific. They have had a strong sense of Queensland's place in the<br />
economic life of the Asia-Pacific and have worked with business to build the<br />
State's trade and investment links. Their active support for the teaching of<br />
Asian languages in schools has had a nation-wide impact in time it will<br />
have a profound influence.<br />
So I am very pleased to be delivering the first Asia Lecture to have been held<br />
by the Institute in Brisbane.<br />
I am also very pleased that we have with us tonight Mr Huang Ju, the Mayor<br />
of Shanghai, whom I had the pleasure of meeting when I was in China last<br />
year. As evidence of the dynamism and ferment of economic growth in Asia<br />
we could hardly have a better example than Shanghai.<br />
My speech tonight will be about Australia's foreign policy and it will be about<br />
the Asia Pacific.<br />
Because, in a way which has never been true before in our country's history,<br />
we are talking about the same thing.<br />
I don't mean by this that Australia has no interests outside the region now, or<br />
that we haven't been interested in Asia before. </p>
<p>Our economic and cultural links with Europe and the United States, for<br />
example, are very important to us.<br />
The interests we have in preventing the spread of nuclear or chemical<br />
weapons, or in supporting multilateral approaches to economic co-operation,<br />
or in helping respond to humanitarian crises like Rwanda, are not confined by<br />
regional boundaries.<br />
Above all, the globalisation of the world economy makes it impossible for us<br />
to ignore what is happening outside our region.<br />
Nor am I claiming that Australia has not been involved in Asia before.<br />
For the most part, our record of engagement is long and honourable, from our<br />
support for Indonesian independence, through the establishment of the<br />
Colombo Plan to the development of our great trading sinews with Japan and<br />
later Korea, which helped to fuel literally the astonishing economic growth<br />
in north Asia.<br />
But that said, it is also true in a quite different way from the past a deeper,<br />
more urgent and more intense way that Australia's economic, strategic and<br />
political interests now coalesce in the region around us.<br />
If we do not succeed in the Asia-Pacific, we succeed nowhere.<br />
East Asia's economic explosion ranks with the end of the Cold War as one of<br />
the defining developments of our time.<br />
Beyond all other things, its consequences will shape the 21 st century for<br />
Australia. In the twenty years from 1970, East Asia's share of world GDP rose from 12<br />
per cent to 25 per cent.<br />
At present, three of the world's ten largest economies are from the APEC<br />
region. But by 2020 the World Bank estimates that seven of the top ten will<br />
be APEC members. China, the United States and Japan in the top three<br />
positions will be joined by Indonesia at five and Korea, Thailand and Taiwan.<br />
By the year 2000, the APEC region will generate nearly 55 per cent of world<br />
trade. These developments represent a profound shift in the balance of economic<br />
power in the world from Europe to Asia, from the North to the South.<br />
And it is an economic transformation which over the longer term will have<br />
deep implications for strategic power as well.<br />
Coming to terms with this change and taking full advantage of it represents<br />
the single most important challenge for Australia in the 1990s. We need to<br />
shape ourselves and our region to prepare for it. I </p>
<p>We have no great and powerful patron in this. We have to make our own<br />
way, in our own way.<br />
In the past, it was possible for Australian governments and business people<br />
dealing with Asia to take the policy equivalent of a five-day package tour to<br />
Bali. But dabbling in Asia is no longer an option for Australia. Our engagement<br />
with the region has to be uncompromising, unfailing, tenacious.<br />
The task ahead requires a Government with a creative policy sense a sharp<br />
awareness of the national interest and, indeed the national identity.<br />
As I have often said, there is a cultural element at work in this confidence,<br />
creativity an appropriate sense of national purpose and appropriate symbols<br />
for it these are all part of the effort.<br />
We will need to create abroad the structures and institutions which match the<br />
new times, just as we have done at home.<br />
This Government opened Australia up to the world.<br />
We dismantled the ring fence of tariffs and foreign exchange controls<br />
Australia had slumbered behind. We did it because we knew Australia did<br />
not need to fear the world, and that we could prosper with competition.<br />
The result of that succession of policy reforms has been dramatic. This<br />
country is now far more integrated into the world economy.<br />
Over the decade of reform, the ratio of our exports plus imports to GDP has<br />
risen from 30 per cent to 40 percent. Australian equity abroad has grown<br />
from around 3 percent of GDP in 1983 to almost 20 percent today.<br />
The effective rate of industry protection in Australia is now about one-third of<br />
what it was in the early 1980s and yet our exports now represent 22 per cent<br />
of our GDP compared with less than 14 per cent in 1983.<br />
Our exports to Asia have been booming, growing at a rate of 20 percent per<br />
annum to the ASEAN countries and 12 percent to East Asia as a whole.<br />
Three quarters of our exports now go to other APEC members.<br />
But we also understand that just dismantling the barriers is not enough. All of<br />
us government and business have to go out into the region and help to<br />
shape it in ways which serve our interests.<br />
And that is happening with a gathering momentum.<br />
Our relations with the individual countries around us are in excellent shape. </p>
<p>In Northeast Asia we have relationships of the highest importance. They are<br />
grounded in economic complementarity but are growing well beyond that.<br />
Japan remains overwhelmingly our largest trading partner and a country with<br />
which our longstanding economic links are being matched increasingly by a<br />
broad policy dialogue and partnership.<br />
Japan is now going through fundamental change, both political and<br />
economic. I am convinced from the discussions I had in Tokyo last month that the reform<br />
process which is now reshaping the Japanese political system will have over<br />
time a very positive impact on Japan's role in the region and the world.<br />
Policy debate will become a much more important element of Japanese<br />
politics. This will help nurture stronger political leadership with greater<br />
initiative over the bureaucracy and a clearer sense of Japan's modern<br />
international role.<br />
Simultaneously, the Japanese economy is becoming more open and marketoriented.<br />
Business is demanding economic reform and deregulation.<br />
Consumers are taking advantage of wide-spread price discounting. The<br />
economic integration of Japan with the rest of East Asia is proceeding apace.<br />
Above all, there is a need for Japan to unleash some of its 157 trillion yen in<br />
savings and to invest in itself, in the living standards of its own people.<br />
Australia's relationship with the Republic of Korea is one of great potential.<br />
Korea is now our third largest export market and may soon be our second.<br />
In addition to a thriving bilateral trade relationship, Korea has been one of our<br />
key partners in developing APEC and we have a security relationship dating<br />
back to the Korean War.<br />
I am looking forward to the opportunity to set new directions for future<br />
cooperation when President Kim Young Sam visits Australia immediately after<br />
the APEC leaders' meeting in November.<br />
Our relations with China are deep and growing. China has more foreign<br />
investment in Australia than in any other country a mark of the deep<br />
complementarity in our relationship.<br />
By some measurements, China is already the third largest economy in the<br />
world. The World Bank expects it to be the largest within 25 years. Its<br />
economy has been growing at an average of 9 per cent each year over the<br />
past decade.<br />
As China's economic weight grows, so will its military and political power.<br />
If anything is inevitable about the 21st century, it is the growing weight and<br />
influence of China in the region and the world. </p>
<p>Australia has nothing to fear from this. We have been a firm supporter of<br />
China's full integration into world and regional institutions. We regard it as<br />
essential to engage China productively in the global economy.<br />
But China's growth is nevertheless one of the great shifts to which the region<br />
will have to adjust in the coming decades.<br />
In Southeast Asia, our core relationship is with Indonesia. As I have said<br />
many times, no country is more important to us.<br />
The progress we have made in the past couple of years in broadening the<br />
relationship is a matter of great satisfaction to me.<br />
But we can do more. There is great potential for more Australian businesses<br />
to establish themselves in Indonesia.<br />
Neither Australia nor Indonesia has designs on the other and our strategic<br />
interests in the broader region are similar. Our defence relations are growing<br />
rapidly and I think they can be strengthened further.<br />
We have deep and solid relationships with all the other ASEAN countries<br />
Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Brunei. Each of these<br />
relationships has its own distinct strength, history and potential.<br />
With Singapore, for example, we have a very close defence relationship<br />
involving regular exercises and training.<br />
And Prime Minister Goh and I have agreed to press ahead with building<br />
strategic linkages between Australian and Singaporean companies operating<br />
in third markets.<br />
With Malaysia, we have an old and deep relationship, strengthened by the<br />
fact that more than 100,000 Malaysians have studied and trained in Australia.<br />
This is already having its impact in the business area.<br />
Outside ASEAN but not for long Vietnam is a country of growing<br />
importance to Australia. It is a strategically significant country with a resilient<br />
hard-working population of 70 million and a strong national sense of purpose.<br />
It will become a much more important influence as it becomes steadily more<br />
integrated into the region.<br />
For Australia, the island countries of the Pacific are an important part of the<br />
Asia-Pacific too. In August, I chaired the 25th meeting of the South Pacific<br />
Forum here in Brisbane. The emphasis at the meeting was on ways in which<br />
we can address the pressing practical problems of sustainable development<br />
in the area. I </p>
<p>Papua New Guinea and the other countries of the South Pacific will continue<br />
to deserve Australia's careful commitment as they confront the pressures of<br />
development. New Zealand is a firm partner with Australia in the Pacific, as well as in<br />
APEC. But beyond these bilateral links we need to create and sustain a multilateral<br />
framework which can engage all the interests of the region.<br />
Over the next few years the countries around the Pacific face a major<br />
decision about what sort of region this should be whether its institutions and<br />
structures should be focussed on East Asia or on the broader Asia Pacific.<br />
The signs of this debate are evident on both sides of the Pacific and its<br />
outcome will have a profound effect on Australia's future.<br />
The growth of regionalism has been one of the great global trends since the<br />
Cold War ended and ideological competition between East and West ceased<br />
to be a determining influence on regional developments.<br />
We have seen it at work in the expansion of the European Union, in the<br />
speedy development of economic co-operation in Asia and Latin America, in<br />
the creation of the ASEAN Regional Forum.<br />
Regionalism should be a positive force, building on the common interests<br />
between neighbours. But it can also have a darker side if it promotes the<br />
emergence of competing and exclusive blocs.<br />
My own very strong view is that the sort of region Australia wants to see, and<br />
the sort of regional structures we need to encourage, are trans-Pacific.<br />
This doesn't stem from any lack of comfort on my part with Australia's place in<br />
Asia, but from my conviction that Australia and the western rim of the Pacific<br />
all of us are better off in a region which is shaped by, and sustains, our<br />
major economic and security linkages. And these remain heavily trans-<br />
Pacific. Despite rapid growth in trade between Asian countries, trade and economic<br />
links across the Pacific remain important to all of us in this region.<br />
The United States remains Asia's single largest market, its major source of<br />
capital and a vital supplier of technology.<br />
One fifth of all East Asian trade is with the United States. And in 1992 the<br />
United States accounted for more than a quarter of the total stock of foreign<br />
direct investment in East Asia.<br />
Because, despite the astonishing growth of some of the emerging economies,<br />
the United States remains a formidable economic power. An economy of nine<br />
thousand billion dollars growing at three per cent a year generates a lot more </p>
<p>purchasing power than smaller economies growing at six to eight per cent a<br />
year. The United States remains central to the region's security as well. Its<br />
alliances with a number of regional countries, including Australia, are a vital<br />
part of the regional security network and its capabilities provide strong reassurance<br />
to the countries of the region that a balancing military presence is<br />
available in the region in time of crisis.<br />
At present we have a highly unusual situation in which the world's second<br />
largest economy, Japan, is a strategic client of the world's largest economic<br />
power, the United States. This is unprecedented historically. Try to imagine<br />
Britain and Germany being in such a position early this century.<br />
And all our interests those of the United States, Japan, Australia and the<br />
other countries of the region are served by the preservation of this<br />
relationship of strategic co-operation.<br />
It is the core of US strategic engagement in the Western Pacific. It<br />
legitimises Japan's defence role. And it removes the need for Japan to<br />
acquire strategic capabilities.<br />
Without the alliance, the pressure for Japan to throw off the constitutional<br />
restraints on its defence posture would grow. The risk of regional instability<br />
and a spiralling arms build-up would increase.<br />
Australia strongly supports a more active international role for Japan. We<br />
believe it has much to contribute to regional and international affairs.<br />
I have said before that Australia regards it as an anomaly that the world's<br />
second largest economy is not one of the permanent members of the UN<br />
Security Council. But, as I have also said , it does not have to be " in uniform"<br />
to perform this role.<br />
These are some of the important economic and strategic reasons why I hope<br />
we will continue to see the active engagement of the United States in the<br />
region, and I believe we will.<br />
But it is not pre-ordained.<br />
The United States always has choices about its role in the world and where<br />
and how it plays that role for example, the extent to which it focuses its<br />
energies in the western hemisphere. We have seen it exercise such choices<br />
in different ways in the course of this century.<br />
Trade tensions between the United States and the North Asian economies<br />
have the potential to fester and to attenuate the existing bonds across the<br />
Pacific. Inevitably in an economy that size, a tension exists within the United States<br />
between those who think that unilateral pressure is the best and easiest way </p>
<p>to achieve trade results and those who see the broader virtues of a<br />
multilateral approach.<br />
This is where APEC fits in.<br />
In the background to all my thinking about APEC has been a conviction that<br />
the greatest danger to the economic dynamism which has been so important<br />
to Australia's development and the region's, would be a fracturing of the post-<br />
Cold War world into competing blocs.<br />
By bringing both sides of the Pacific into a broader partnership, APEC offers<br />
the best way of avoiding this sort of outcome.<br />
It helps to lock in US economic and commercial interest in the region, which<br />
in turn helps ensure US strategic engagement. It provides a framework to<br />
help contain or manage competition between China, Japan and the United<br />
States. And it gives the smaller countries of the region a greater say in the<br />
nature and shape of the trading arrangements in the region.<br />
It should be clear from what I have said that the last thing Australia wants is<br />
for APEC to develop into a protectionist or inward-looking trade bloc. That is<br />
just the sort of global outcome we think APEC can help to prevent.<br />
But that does not mean, in my view, that APEC does not have an important<br />
role to play in regional trade liberalisation in this part of the world.<br />
So long as APEC's approach is GATT-consistent, and equally importantly<br />
so long as it contributes to global trade liberalisation, it seems to me that, as<br />
the weight of economic development in the world shifts towards Asia and the<br />
Pacific, we have a responsibility to show that countries in this part of the<br />
world can take a decisive step towards a free trade goal.<br />
I am equally convinced that anything that we do inside APEC will have<br />
beneficial consequences in bringing closer a new global trading round.<br />
But it is not only in the area of trade liberalisation bringing down tariffs and<br />
non-tariff barriers for goods and services that APEC is important.<br />
It also has a very important role in trade facilitation that is helping to<br />
eliminate administrative and other impediments to trade and investment in the<br />
region. Indeed, matters like the harmonisation of product standards and certification<br />
arrangements, which make it easier for manufacturers in one part of the<br />
region to sell in the other parts of the region, will have even more importance<br />
as trade barriers come down.<br />
It was in my first speech to the Asia Australia Institute in April 1992 that I first<br />
put forward publicly the suggestion that a process of periodic meetings<br />
between leaders of the APEC economies should be established. </p>
<p>Even at my most optimistic I did not expect that a little over two years later I<br />
would be about to attend the second such meeting.<br />
In two weeks' time the leaders of eighteen economies, representing more<br />
than half the world's production and nearly half of its trade, will meet in<br />
Bogor, as in Seattle, in a room without officials or a detailed agenda, to talk<br />
about the economic challenges in our region.<br />
I don't think there has been a more important meeting held in Southeast Asia<br />
since the Bandung Conference of 1955 established the Non Aligned<br />
Movement. In part, its importance lies in the very significant issues the meeting will<br />
address how we can maintain the velocity of trade in this region by getting<br />
down the formal and informal barriers.<br />
We have been shown a path forward in two important reports from the<br />
Eminent Persons' Group, and the Pacific Business Forum. The Australian<br />
participants Neville Wran on the EPG and Philip Brass of Pacific Dunlop<br />
and Imelda Roche of Nutrimetics in the Business Forum made a very<br />
important contribution to the development of the APEC vision and I am<br />
grateful to each of them.<br />
For our part, what we hope to see come out of Bogor is a commitment to free<br />
trade in the APEC region by a realistic date, in a GATT-consistent manner.<br />
I'm not worried about the end date we set, so long as it is not too distant. As<br />
we have seen in Australia, the main thing is to get the political commitment to<br />
make a start. Then, with business factoring further liberalisation into its<br />
decisions the momentum builds up and becomes unstoppable. That is the<br />
process we want to start at Bogor.<br />
Free trade through the Asia-Pacific is a huge enterprise. There are<br />
commentators who are already talking as though it is an accomplished fact. It<br />
isn't it will require major adjustments from all the APEC economies.<br />
Free trade in the APEC region would bring Australia benefits several times<br />
those of the Uruguay Round. And the benefits in terms of increased<br />
competitiveness and integration with the region would be far greater.<br />
It can underwrite Australia's future. It can give us sustainable growth,<br />
employment, a role in technological innovation, cultural stimulation and<br />
enrichment. It can substantially underwrite the democratic, rich and dynamic<br />
nation we want to be in the 21st century.<br />
But the Bogor meeting is important at another level too.<br />
It represents a new level of leadership from Asia and a new level of<br />
leadership from the developing world. </p>
<p>In the past, the great initiatives in trade liberalisation have come from the<br />
industrialised countries. For the first time in Bogor, one of the leading<br />
developing countries is issuing the challenge. This vision is President<br />
Soeharto's and it is vital that we respond to him.<br />
Ladies and Gentlemen,<br />
It could be argued that the end of the Cold War has changed the world more<br />
profoundly than any other single event since the Napoleonic Wars since<br />
Lachlan Macquarie was Governor of New South Wales.<br />
None of us has any experience of the sort of world we are moving into.<br />
It will be more integrated than ever, a globalised environment in which<br />
commerce is freer than ever in history; in which communications are<br />
instantaneous and open to all; in which more and more aspects of national<br />
government have an international dimension.<br />
This prospect frightens some people, as change always does.<br />
Our opponents, for example, wring their hands because Australia is party to<br />
an increasing number of international agreements. They fret that these<br />
agreements sometimes shape our domestic policies. They complain that our<br />
sovereignty is being infringed and pine for a clearer, simpler world in which<br />
foreigners kept a decent distance.<br />
But it's not like that any more. From saving Antarctica as a wilderness park, to<br />
protecting our security by banning chemical weapons, to expanding<br />
Australia's access to other markets through the Uruguay Round negotiations,<br />
to getting agreements on the harmonisation of product standards, we need at<br />
an ever-increasing rate to talk and deal with the rest of the world.<br />
That is the sort of international system we are now entering; with fewer clear<br />
lines between domestic and external interests, and one in which these<br />
external interests economic, strategic, political are intertwined in a way we<br />
have never seen before.<br />
The best guarantee of our national sovereignty will not be any walls we build<br />
around us, but the resources we can call upon within ourselves. The degree<br />
to which our industrial culture operates to principles of world's best practice<br />
and within a culture of innovation and creativity will be essential to our<br />
national sovereignty: the degree to which we are able to engage and<br />
compete on the international front line will be essential. Our national<br />
sovereignty will depend on our worldliness and integration with the world.<br />
Equally it will depend upon the less tangible resources of tradition and<br />
culture: the values of democracy and tolerance will continue to serve us well,<br />
so will our language, so will all those things which remind us of our common<br />
heritage and interest.<br />
We have no need to be defensive about our place in the Asia-Pacific. </p>
<p>Australian engagement with the region is important to us but, equally, it is<br />
important to the region.<br />
Our relationships with Japan, China and Korea show how important the<br />
economic complementarities between Australia and our neighbours are. And<br />
they will continue to be important as economic growth spreads to the<br />
countries of Southeast Asia.<br />
Our services like education have long made an important contribution to the<br />
development of the region, and we are now seeing other Australian services<br />
like health, housing, engineering, communications and law being exported to<br />
the region and helping to sustain its economic dynamism.<br />
Our skills in basic scientific research, and increasingly in the application of<br />
that research through government initiatives like the Cooperative Research<br />
Centres, are a regional resource.<br />
Information technology will play an increasingly important part in our<br />
relationship with the region and the multi-media initiative among other<br />
elements of the Government's cultural statement will significantly boost our<br />
role in the information revolution, particularly as an international software<br />
provider. Our security links, both bilateral and multilateral, make an important<br />
contribution to regional stability.<br />
But we also contribute because we think broadly about the region. We are a<br />
source of ideas and we are good at implementing them. Our contribution has<br />
been seen in many regional initiatives including APEC, the ASEAN Regional<br />
Forum and the Cambodia settlement.<br />
And, beyond that, Australia itself the sort of society we have created here<br />
is an asset to the region.<br />
I make this point not out of national vanity but because we see too often in<br />
Australians the reverse of this an excess of national self-deprecation.<br />
Australians can take a justifiable pride in the achievements of this country, in<br />
the egalitarian, multicultural and humane democracy we have built.<br />
It is a society in which the rights of the individual are protected against the<br />
demands of the state.<br />
This sense of human rights is intrinsic to our sense of ourselves.<br />
The difficult task is not deciding whether human rights are universal. Of<br />
course they are. It is deciding how to apply our own beliefs in the<br />
international arena. </p>
<p>It is not surprising that many of Australia's neighbours have different<br />
standards from our own.<br />
Sometimes that is the result of different levels of political or economic<br />
development.<br />
Sometimes it is the result of a belief that the good of society at large is more<br />
important than the rights of individuals.<br />
Sometimes, there is no question that human rights are abused, by any<br />
standards. Picking our way through this moral thicket is one of the most difficult things<br />
we have to do.<br />
But I am utterly convinced of one thing. We will get much further in advancing<br />
human rights by talking to our neighbours than by shunning them. Cutting off<br />
contacts is less likely to succeed than making human rights part of a broadlybased<br />
relationship in which we are able to talk freely and openly about our<br />
differences.<br />
We do not, and cannot, aim to be " Asian" or European or anything else but<br />
Australians. But we can and should aim to be a country which is deeply integrated into the<br />
region around us. Which understands that our neighbours are increasingly<br />
proud and justifiably proud of what their societies have accomplished the<br />
amelioration of poverty, the growth of education, the massive improvements<br />
in health standards.<br />
By the turn of the century, by the centenary of our nationhood, I hope this will<br />
be a country: in which more and more Australians speak the languages of our<br />
neighbours in which our businesspeople are a familiar and valued part of the<br />
commercial landscape of the Asia-Pacific<br />
in which we are making full use of the great resource of the growing<br />
number of Australians of Asian background<br />
in which our defence and strategic links with the countries around us<br />
are deeper than ever<br />
in which our national identity is clearer to us and our neighbours<br />
through the appointment of an Australian as our head of state<br />
in which our national culture is shaped by, and helps to shape, the<br />
cultures around us </p>
<p>Political scientists have recently been asking themselves what will be the next<br />
big thing in global conflict to replace the ideological struggle of the Cold War.<br />
Much of their discussion has centred around the prospect of a " clash of<br />
civilizations" with suggestions that the coming great strategic divide will fall<br />
between the western, Confucian and Islamic worlds.<br />
If that is in any sense a real prospect, it is one which Australia, by nature and<br />
inclination, stands strongly against. Contemporary Australia itself is evidence<br />
that cultures can coexist and build on each other to create a strong and<br />
cohesive society.<br />
The enterprise in which we are now engaged, the creation of a thriving<br />
community of nations across the Asia-Pacific the enterprise of APEC is an<br />
extension of this model.<br />
It is the best assurance we have that this will be the model for the world as<br />
the next millennium approaches.<br />
ends </p>
