2 May 1997 TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
THE HON. JOHN HOWARD MP<br />
DOORSTOP INTER VIEW SYDNEY<br />
E O E<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to congratulate Tony Blair, the Prime Ministerelect<br />
of Great Britain on an extraordinarily impressive victory. I commiserate with my<br />
friend, John Major. He fought a courageous personal campaign in quite impossible<br />
circumstances. Mr Blair inherits a very strong British economy, in fact the strongest<br />
economy in Europe. He inherits the legacy of 18 years of overall, very successful<br />
Conservative Party rule and at a time in which the electoral fortunes of the British<br />
Conservative Party are at a very low ebb, it is worth recalling the enormous<br />
transformation that the Thatcher years, followed by the Major years brought to the<br />
economy of the United Kingdom. The relationship between Australia and the United<br />
Kingdom is a very important relationship. It consists of many layers of history, of<br />
shared values and shared attitudes and many personal links and on a personal note I<br />
look forward to meeting Mr Blair in the very near future. I again warmly congratulate<br />
him. I wish him well. I hope he brings good government to the country that he has<br />
now been elected to lead.<br />
JRNLST: Mr Howard, is our economy growing as strongly as the United Kingdom's?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Yes, in fact on some estimates, a tick stronger. It depends what measure you use but<br />
certainly, the growth rate in Australia and the growth rate in the United Kingdom are<br />
very similar indeed.<br />
JRNLST: Mr Howard, did you, as has been suggested in newspapers this morning, attempt to<br />
broker a deal with Mr Murdoch? </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:<br />
No, I saw that story. I was rather surprised at the tone of it. What happened was that<br />
I was asked by News Ltd, by one of the Murdochs, whether I would be willing,<br />
whether the Government would be willing to agree to an increase in the foreign<br />
investment limits for television. In the course of discussions with him and also with Mr<br />
Cowley, the proposition was put that, as to whether News Ltd would be willing to<br />
surrender ownership of some newspapers if the increase, if an increase in television<br />
foreign ownership were allowed. At no stage was there any suggestion put that there<br />
was some trade off between changing the cross media rules and lifting the foreign<br />
ownership limits in television. The approach about lifting the foreign ownership limits<br />
in television was to me, came from News Ltd, and may I say, I didn't find that the least<br />
bit odd.<br />
I mean, newspaper and press proprietors are always putting propositions to the<br />
Government about changing the law in a way that might suit them and that applies to<br />
Mr Packer, it applies to Mr Murdoch, it applies to Mr Stokes, it applies to a whole lot<br />
of other people, so there's nothing odd about that and I don't take any exception but<br />
what I do reject about that Financial Review article this morning is the suggestion that<br />
I tried to sort of broker some trade off between changing the foreign investment limits<br />
for television in exchange for some tacit acceptance by the Murdoch interest of<br />
changing cross media. What was put to me was, would we change the television laws,<br />
and we said, well would you surrender some newspaper interests so that the overall<br />
level of foreign ownership in the media did not go up, and nothing has come of that.<br />
So what happens is a matter for the Government to decide but the law as it stands at<br />
the present time is the law as it stands and no Government decision on any aspect of<br />
media law has been taken and I ought to make that very plain to everybody who is<br />
interested. JRNLST: What do you say then Mr Howard, to Mr Stokes who today has accused you of doing<br />
a quote, disgracefuil deal to deliver Fairfax to its...<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Really? Well that rather tiresome allegation was I think launched onto the world stage<br />
in Singapore and outside the Brandenburg Gate by my predecessor as Prime Minister a<br />
couple of years ago. Of course I have not done any deal, disgraceful or otherwise with<br />
Mr Packer. Our policy at the last election left open the question of whether the cross<br />
media prohibitions would be lifted. I am on the record over a period of ten years as<br />
being opposed to the cross media prohibitions and I'm rather puzzled, I had a talk to<br />
Mr Stokes two days ago and he didn't say anything about that to me. </p>
<p>JRNLST: Are you surprised at the bitterness of his attack? He's accused you of playing king<br />
maker, much the way that the Labor Party did?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well I think that's an extraordinary attack but I am not surprised. I mean, Mr Stokes<br />
doesn't want the cross media rules changed so I mean, look, I think there's a pattern.<br />
All media proprietors tend to make public statements in promotion of their own<br />
interests and I understand that. I don't criticise them for it. I think he obviously feels<br />
that obligation to his shareholders to put a point of view. Mr Packer does to his<br />
interests and Mr Murdoch does to his and all the other players on the Australian media<br />
scene really do the same thing. There's no real difference. I think in fact it's better<br />
that these things be discussed in an open fashion like this. Every media proprietor in<br />
Australia is pushing his or her own barrow. There's no qualitative difference as far as I<br />
have been able to divine but I just reject completely any suggestion of a deal. That's a<br />
silly, erroneous and quite dishonourable claim.<br />
JRNLST: Mr Howard, is there any chance that the foreign ownership in television will be lifted<br />
so it's consistent with newspapers, to that 25% limit?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Look, I don't want to speculate or comment any further. Obviously the media laws<br />
are under some consideration at the present time. That's plain. We haven't reached<br />
any final decision. As I said a moment ago, the law at the present time is the law at the<br />
present time and in the course of these reviews you have a lot of views put to you by a<br />
lot of people and I have been receiving a lot of those views from different people. The<br />
one thing I can tell you is that nobody, no one person is in agreement with any other<br />
person. They all have a slightly different point of view.<br />
JRNLST: Is it according to what the proposition, or the counter proposition you put to Mr<br />
Murdoch, you might be prepared to contemplate increasing the levels for tv if there<br />
was a divestiture in, say print or something to ( inaudible)<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well I said what I said. I can't add anything to that and I wouldn't have said it if it<br />
weren't accurate. I simply make the point that at no stage did I try and broker some<br />
kind of trade off between cross media laws and foreign investment laws in relation to<br />
television. That part of the Financial Review story was completely erroneous and I am<br />
very surprised that it was written in that form. </p>
<p>JRNLST: What do you think of the proposition"<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
What do I think of what proposition?<br />
JRNLST: The News Ltd proposition that they increase their stake to seven at the same time as<br />
you ( inaudible)<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well that wasn't their proposition. That was the whole point of what I said.<br />
JRNLST: What do you think of the idea?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
What do I think of the idea? Well I think that's academic.<br />
JRNLST: Mr Howard on Wik...<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
On Wik, yes.<br />
JRNLST: If as reported, next week the National Party forces Tim Fischer to abandon your plan<br />
to favour extinguishment, where do you go?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well I never react to each and every piece of speculation in newspapers and on<br />
television about how something like this is going. I am confident that the plan that I<br />
have put forward is the best plan to give certainty to pastoralists and deliver fairness to<br />
the Aboriginal people. I am determined to press ahead with it. I have already asked<br />
that work begin on preparing legislation. I will be talking to the Cabinet about it next<br />
week and I am very confident that the plan will receive the support of the Joint Party<br />
Room. </p>
<p>JRNLST: Aboriginal groups are worried you've ignored the stolen generation inquiry?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well I haven't received a detailed briefing on that and until I have I am not going to<br />
make any comment.<br />
JRNLST: Mr Howard, when do you expect to make a decision on plans to ( inaudible) the laws<br />
on cross media ownership?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I don't know.<br />
Thank you. </p>
