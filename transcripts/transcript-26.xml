<p>The William Queale Lecture has been established by the<br />
Adelaide Division of the Australian Institute of Management<br />
to honour the memory of their foundation president,<br />
who died on December 25, 1951.<br />
William Queale was a prominent figure in the business<br />
world and public life of South Australia and was well<br />
known and active beyond the borders of this State.<br />
From 1941 to 1944 he was president of the South<br />
Australian Chamber of Manufactures and later president<br />
of the federal body, the Associated Chambers of Manufacturers<br />
of Australia.<br />
During the war he served on a number of boards and<br />
committees engaged in promoting and maintaining the war<br />
effort and for many years he was a member of the South<br />
Australian Industries Advisory Committee.<br />
One of his major interests was of course the better application<br />
of management principles and the development<br />
of managers, and he was keenly interested in the Institute<br />
which was originally formed in Melbourne in 1941.<br />
Ten years ago he was instrumental in promoting the<br />
Institute of Industrial Management in South Australia<br />
which was formed in 1944 and became part of the federal<br />
eblis-henAtian 94. tithetie of his eaetohe tws<br />
ebdy-hmen Auian Ins. tituete of Man aet-o itws<br />
president of the Federal Council of the Institute as well<br />
as President of the Adelaide Division.<br />
To commemorate his name and work a group of friends<br />
and associates have subscribed a fund which has been<br />
applied in two ways. One-to establish the William<br />
Queale Library which is located at the Institute headquarters<br />
in Adelaide and two-to endow the William<br />
Queale Lecture which will be delivered annually by a<br />
citizen of distinction on a topic related to management.<br />
The first William Queale Lecture was delivered by the<br />
Right Honourable the Prime Minister of Australia, Mr.<br />
R. G. Menzies, in the Bonython Hall<br />
in the University of Adelaide on Friday, October 22, 1954. </p>

WIELLIAM QUEALE MEMORIAL LECTURE<br />
delivered by<br />
K The Right Honourable R. G. Menzies, M. P.,<br />
Prime Minister,<br />
in the Bonython Hall, Adelaide<br />
K on Friday, 22nd October, 1954<br />
The William Queale Memorial Lecture has been established<br />
by the Australian Institute of Management to honour the<br />
work and memory of a man whose friendship many of us<br />
enjoyed, and whose doggedness of character was in the great<br />
Australian pioneering tradition. For me it is indeed a distinction<br />
to be named as the inaugural lecturer.<br />
" Bill" Queale's unspoken motto was, ' There is nothing I<br />
can't do if I try hard enough!" Taken as his own motto by<br />
every Australian, that simple but dynamic truth could make<br />
our country, in a few generations, a great nation in its own<br />
right and one of the most siguficant contributors to the wellbeing<br />
of mankind.<br />
Much of the great constructive work in Australia has been<br />
done by men who, like the man whose memory we now<br />
honour, started from the " grass-roots," without privilege and<br />
without any assets except courage, abilityi and vision. Such<br />
men, whom professing democrats occasionally criticise for their<br />
very success, are in fact the fine flower of -democracy. For<br />
democracy's true glory is not the achievement of a uniform<br />
mediocrity or of a spirit of dependence upon Government,<br />
but the encouragement of talent and initiative, the elevation<br />
of the individual, the giving of opportunity to all who have<br />
the inherent quality to seize it. </p>
<p>Democracy is the greatest system of government yet devised<br />
by man; but it has its weaknesses and its dangers. So far from<br />
lessening the responsibilities of the individual, it magnifies<br />
them. ' When one man was the ruler, it was no doubt a matter<br />
for thankfulness that he should be wise and honest and competent.<br />
But now that we are all rulers, we must all seek to be<br />
as wise and honest and competent as honest effort can make<br />
US. Democracy, as it develops, steadily widens the social responsibilities<br />
of government. The organised community accepts<br />
growing burdens in the interests of the individual; the burdens<br />
of industrial welfare, of economic leadership, of social<br />
services, of high and stable employment. The weightier the<br />
burdens we accept, the greater must be our capacity and our<br />
strength, our skill and our production. For to accept, with<br />
popular applause, burdens that we are incapable of sustaining,<br />
is to involve others in our own ruin. As the great Radical,<br />
Thomas Paine, one said, ' Those who expect to reap the blessings<br />
of freedom must, like men, undergo the fatigue of supporting<br />
it." These reflections emphasise the point of danger.<br />
Demagogy is a poor substitute for democracy. Attempts to<br />
create " class!' hatred in a nation whose only true classes are<br />
the active and the idle are in truth attacks upon democracy.<br />
A vehement concentration upon " rights" obscures the vital<br />
fact that unless duties are accepted and performed by each of<br />
us, not only our rights but the rights of others will die for<br />
want of nourishment. If we were all tired democrats, eager<br />
beneficiaries but reluctant contributors, democracy would collapse<br />
under its own weight. There are far too many who desert<br />
the Queale motto and adopt that other which says-' There is<br />
nothing I can't have if other people try hard enough!"<br />
It may be a quaint survival of earlier historical systemsabsolute<br />
Monarchy, or despotic aristocracy, or a narrow oligarchy-<br />
that we should so easily fall into the habit of claiming<br />
upon " the governiment"~ as if it were somebody else, with infinite<br />
resources and power; instead of which, of course, it is<br />
ourselves, with no more resources and power than we, by our<br />
efforts, have created and made available.<br />
4 C-</p>
<p>I make these trite observations about frequently forgotten<br />
things without apology, for I want to remind you that, because<br />
he was first and foremost a contributor, William Queale was a<br />
good democrat.<br />
Your Institute, of which he was one of the founding fathers,<br />
is an Institute of Management. Its very name is a reminder<br />
that in a democracy we need not only effort and skill, but<br />
well-directed effort and skill. And here again I am reminded<br />
of one of the temporary ills of democracy-the quaint illusion<br />
that self-government and discipline are mutually exclusive;<br />
that obedience to orders subtracts from human dignity and<br />
freedom. This illusion, though not uncommon, is so crude<br />
that, in a sense, it needs only to be stated to be destroyed.<br />
Yet, with your permission, I will dwell on it a little.<br />
" Each for himself, and the devil take the hindmost" is the<br />
slogan not of freedom, but of anarchy. In a civilised community,<br />
not one of us can live to himself. In the immortal<br />
phrase of St. Paul, " we are members one of another." My freedom<br />
must be limited if I am to live at peace with my<br />
neighbour and his freedom. The whole history of civilization,<br />
as mankind emerged from primitive tribal warfare and<br />
nomadic man gathered into ordered societies, was and is a<br />
history of limitations upon individual freedom. The growing<br />
mass of laws and the growing precision of law enforcement<br />
have produced an effect upon almost everything we do. The<br />
more robust our democracy becomes, the less do we claim<br />
an unfettered freedom to drive where we like and at what<br />
speed we fancy, to write or say what we like about other<br />
people, to redress our grievances by physical violence. Never<br />
in the history of the world have men and women moved from<br />
day to day in such a vast network of laws and regulations,<br />
orders and prohibitions, as under modern democracy. The<br />
thing to remember is that we wear our chains lightly because<br />
they are of our own forging; that the giving up of the little<br />
freedoms involved in the social compact has raised the quality<br />
and assured the continuity of those great freedoms of the mind<br />
and of the spirit which democracy is destined to serve. As<br />
Edmund Burke said at Bristol in 1774, ' The only liberty I </p>
<p>mean, is a liberty connected with order; that not only exists<br />
along with order and virtue, but which cannot exist at all<br />
without them."<br />
We see, therefore, that sensible discipline cheerfully accepted<br />
and public laws scrupulously obeyed are not the<br />
enemies of freedom, but its essential friends.<br />
Good management is therefore vital to good democracy.<br />
Good management is your daily concern. It is my daily concern.<br />
I hope you will allow me to say a few things about it.<br />
For though I am a political manager ( if the phrase is permitted),<br />
and you are business managers, the principles upon<br />
which we must work have much in common; more, indeed,<br />
than unthinking observers commonly concede.<br />
I have not had all my years of Ministerial office without<br />
learning quite clearly one of the delightful oddities of human<br />
society. I will put it in this way. There is something fascinating<br />
about telling the other man how to run his business.<br />
Naturally, the less we know of the details and difficulties and<br />
headaches of that business, and the less encumbered we are<br />
with training and experience in that business, the more dogmatic<br />
we can be. Dogma is a comfortable thing; it saves thought.<br />
Yet no man can reach a general conclusion of any value unless<br />
he has first studied and mastered the relevant details. Nevertheless<br />
this sober reflection deters street-corner political<br />
philosophers and newspaper commentators not one whit. The<br />
field we are not in continues to look greener. The only wisdom<br />
I can claim to have achieved is that I never tell a manufacturer<br />
how to make his goods better or cheaper; though truth compels<br />
me to say that not infrequently he is quite willing to give me<br />
five minutes of his time in which to solve the problems which<br />
have vexed me, in the study or the Cabinet Room, for years.<br />
Having offered these mild observations to those who may care<br />
to consider them, I make bold to say that the principles of<br />
management are of universal validity; they are the principles<br />
of industrial and business and political government. Let me<br />
set down and expound a few of them, partly for your guidance,<br />
but even more, I cheerfully admit, for my own. </p>
<p>The first principle of management is that the manager should<br />
know what he wants to do or to get done. Infirmity of purpose<br />
at the top will breed indifference, frustration, and<br />
confusion lower down. It is agreeable, in works of fiction or<br />
in the selectively edited autobiographies of what the Americans<br />
call " tycoons," to read of the man who succeeded by making<br />
a long series of split-second decisions. But great enterprises<br />
are not made by split-second decisions. The great decisions<br />
are the fruit of research and labour and skill and imagination.<br />
The port of destination must be selected, the charts laid out,<br />
the crew engaged, the supplies taken aboard. If storms come,<br />
there will be plenty of room for quick decisions, but after<br />
the storm the observations must be taken and the steady<br />
course resumed. Here we have the supreme difficulty of political<br />
management. There are so many side-currents; the<br />
clamour of the moment may indicate some other port, where,<br />
it is said, the seas are calm and the customers eager. The long<br />
view is never as spectacular as the day-to-day diversion. Yet<br />
without long views democracy becomes a mere squabble for<br />
bread and circuses; statesmanship disappears, and the adroit<br />
manoeuvres of evanescent politics prevail. In the lengthening<br />
history of self-government too many lofty conceptions have<br />
been set aside or postponed by the cynical commen t-" There<br />
are no votes in that!" Yet in every generation there has been<br />
enough resolute statesmanship to produce a line of progress,<br />
sometimes distorted by passion or prejudice or sheer greed, yet<br />
tending always towards a wider and better life. So, you see,<br />
we have our first principle in common; for you, the soundest<br />
establishment and long-range development of an enterprise;<br />
for a Prime Minister, some day, the memory not so much of a<br />
debate won or an electoral victory gained as of a nation<br />
advanced in prosperity and justice.<br />
The second principle of management is that the manager<br />
must do his best with the materials he has. Management is not<br />
a matter of detached theory, but of theory applied in practice.<br />
Every manager has his team of human beings, fast, slow,<br />
strong, weak. He is not to cry for the moon, or bite his nails<br />
at night, saying, " If only old Brown or Jones were back with us </p>
<p>again!" Now, in seeking for perfection, we can, if we are not<br />
careful, waste much time and energy. It was Cicero who said<br />
that everything splendid is rare, and that nothing is harder to<br />
find than perfection. So let us use the materials we have, with<br />
the best team that you can; train it; encourage it; lead it. You<br />
will find, as many a captain has, that a team of champions will<br />
always be beaten by a champion team.(<br />
The third principle of management is that we should remember<br />
that we are not conducting affairs in a vacuum. We are<br />
not dealing on paper with abstract ideas, but in a hard world<br />
with ideas in relation to men-a very different matter. Alexander<br />
Pope said that, ' The proper study of mankind is man."<br />
He could have elaborated by saying that the most difficult<br />
study of mankind is man. It is much easier to be mathematically<br />
accurate than to give another man a sensible direction.<br />
For men have at their best that queer mixture of bad logic and<br />
good sense, of courage when cold reason says " fsurrender," of<br />
vigour when, in reason, exhaustion should have arrived, which<br />
makes history by getting things done. This, you may say, puts<br />
a premium on the practical man, and puts the theorist in his<br />
place. But to say that would be to tell only half the truth.<br />
Theory without practice can begin as a divine essence but end<br />
as a mere vapour. Practice without theory can become so nar-(<br />
row and so ignorant that it loses the sense of direction and of<br />
purpose. Let me develop this. The manager uses men. To use them<br />
effectively he must understand them. Men are distinguished<br />
from machines because they have ideas and personalities. The<br />
strong " Practical" man may drive a chain gang along, but he<br />
will never handle men without understanding and imagination.<br />
The business manager must realise that his is not the onlyI<br />
business; that his business is unlikely to succeed in a bankrupt<br />
community; and that he should, therefore, always seek to see<br />
his business in the setting of the business of the nation. The<br />
modem complexity of life involves a growing interaction between<br />
business and business, between business and government,<br />
between national and international economics. You can, </p>
<p>in the short run, make money quickly, as Dick Turpin did.<br />
But in the long run you cannot be a good business manager<br />
without being a good and wise and informed and responsible<br />
citizen. Governments must fit themselves to see economics in<br />
the broad. Since a business manager cannot run his business<br />
and the government at the same time-oddly enough each is a<br />
full-time and absorbing task-he cannot be blamed if, like the<br />
cobbler, he sticks to his last. But I do beg of him that he should<br />
struggle to see the particular against the background of the<br />
general; so that the sense of profit and the sense of community,<br />
each of them so good, should co-exist and derive strength one<br />
from the other. Morally and intellectually, the curse of the<br />
world is narrow and exclusive specialism. It is supremely dangerous,<br />
whether it be the specialism of the manufacturer of<br />
milking machines or of the nuclear physicist.<br />
The fourth principle of management-in order of importance<br />
it should be first-is to establish a sense of community of<br />
interest between manager and managed. Where there is no<br />
underlying sense of unity, differences become exaggerated and<br />
war becomes the normal. This is true of both politics and<br />
industry. Take politics. Most of us at Canberra enjoy the friendliest<br />
personal relations. We have great matters in ' common. We are<br />
all Australians, of common race, language, literature, traditions,<br />
and religious faith. With few exceptions, we began life with<br />
no advantages of wealth or social position. We believe in the<br />
equal rule of law and in the dignity of self-government. We<br />
are British through and through. We are for the Crown. We<br />
are the Queen's men and women. We all believe in progress,<br />
in development, in social justice. What a wealth of agreement<br />
we have here! We disagree; of course; about socialism; about<br />
the limits of functions of government; about financial policies;<br />
about the principles of administration; about foreign policy;<br />
about many things. But the truth remains that, if we concentrate<br />
on our differences and forget our unities, politics will<br />
sound and be-like civil war. The one thing that the bitter and<br />
narrow partisans forget is that continuity of national security </p>
<p>and growth requires, on great matters, a certain continuity of<br />
policy. We secure that by remembering our unities; we destroy<br />
it by thinking only of our differences. I, as you may have<br />
gathered, am a Liberal, with deep and strong convictions. My<br />
opponents, including men of great ability, are Socialists. So let<br />
the fight go on. But whoever wins between us, may Australia<br />
win always. C<br />
So much for the political managers. What about the industrial<br />
managers? As one who once had a great deal of first-hand<br />
knowledge of industrial arbitration, I am conscious of its cen-.<br />
tral weakness. Over 50 years ago, the new Commonwealth<br />
was given power to deal with certain classes of industrial dis-C<br />
pute. No dispute, no jurisdiction. Fight first, and go to court<br />
afterwards. The inevitable result has been that industrial warfare<br />
has tended to become the condition precedent to industrial<br />
peace. This has infected an already difficult problem, the<br />
relation between employer and employee. Too frequently the<br />
question has been, " How much can I get out of the other fellow?"<br />
when it should have been " How much can we all get,<br />
if we work together?"<br />
There are certain simple truths which become obscured by<br />
the dust of conflict. One of them is that there can be no permanent<br />
and progressive employment in an unprofitable<br />
business; good profits are the only guarantee of good wages,<br />
and vice versa. The other is that good-will is vital to efficient<br />
service, and that the employer who performs only his legal and<br />
compulsory duty cannot sensibly demand from his employee a<br />
loftier standard than he himself upholds. I<br />
Year by year, we are, as a people, vexed by foolish industrial<br />
disputes from which there emerge hardships in wageearners'<br />
homes, losses in trading accounts, a fall in national<br />
production and anger in the public mind. In most cases, these<br />
disputes have occurred because the simple truths to which I<br />
have referred have been forgotten.<br />
Politically and industrially, we have major interests in common,<br />
and others on which some disagreement is necessary and<br />
healthy. One of the great tasks of management is to make these </p>
<p>things clear. To work out, even by dispute, the terms of partnership<br />
is one thing; to forget or deny partnership is both<br />
foolish and suicidal.<br />
The fifth principle of management is, in a democracy, the<br />
hardest to practise. It is, in brief, to achieve the highest possible<br />
measure of self-help and self-reliance before asking somebody<br />
else to carry the burden. The ancient question, " Am I my<br />
brother's keeper?" has in modem times been distorted into, " Is<br />
not my brother my keeper?" That mystical creature, the<br />
Government, which nobody has ever seen, has come to be<br />
regarded as the Universal Provider. On great national issues,<br />
Government may well be the port of ultimate resort; but it<br />
should not be the first port of call. Not so long ago, the Tariff<br />
Board had something to say on this matter.<br />
That Board, let me remind you, has over a long period of<br />
years,-established a remarkable degree of authority, and of service<br />
to Australia. That it is occassionally criticised I admit, yet,<br />
by and large, its methods, its principles, and its reports have<br />
enjoyed the respect of industry and of the community at large.<br />
Its high reputation has helped Australia in many international<br />
trade and financial negotiations both before and since the<br />
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. The striking fact is<br />
that over the period of exristence of the Tariff Board, that is,<br />
since 1921, employment in secondary industries has increased<br />
from 435,000, or 8% of a total population of 5,500,000 to<br />
983,000 or 11% of a total population of 9,000,000. This is<br />
strong evidence that the work of the Board has, to say the<br />
least, not hindered the sound growth of secondary industry in<br />
Australia. Yet the Board has repeatedly noted that too many<br />
manufacturers, when meeting competition, think first of added<br />
protection as the quick answer.<br />
In its 1950 Report, the Board said, " Tariff protection should<br />
be a last resource and not a sole or even inevitable method of<br />
securing relief from overseas competition." And again, in its<br />
1953 Report-' The Board does not subscribe to the view that<br />
the Tariff should be used in anticipation of difficulties ahead,<br />
neither does it believe that the Tariff barrier should be the<br />
first line of defence against overseas competition." In the same </p>
<p>report it spoke of industry's " capacity for self-help." These<br />
statements were not attacks on the policy of protection, which<br />
indeed needs no defence; they were designed merely to put<br />
things in perspective. Honest work, good plant, and efficient<br />
management remain the prime weapons against a burdensome<br />
cost structure and competitive disadvantage.<br />
The sixth principle is that every good manager is a pioneer.<br />
I began this lecture by referring to William Queale as one who<br />
was in the Australian pioneering tradition. Many times I have<br />
said, and I repeat it tonight, that we do badly to think of the<br />
pioneers as grandfathers, with beards and bowyangs; dead and<br />
gone, their labours completed. For the truth is that when a<br />
nation gives up pioneering, it goes back. A pioneer is, quite<br />
simply, one who breaks new ground or sets out on new adventures.<br />
His essence is that he is willing to tackle a new problem,<br />
and has a sense of responsibility for the future. Such qualities<br />
are not common, and therefore we cannot all be managers.<br />
But unless in every generation we have an adequate supply<br />
of pioneers, future generations will not call us blessed. Flashy<br />
policies, get-rich-quick schemes, the preferring of big current<br />
dividends to solid reserves for future development; these are<br />
the negation of the pioneering spirit, for they deny or ignore<br />
responsibility for the future. Great enterprises cannot stand still C)<br />
in a growing community; when they do, it is a sign that they<br />
are marked for death. The sad thing, which we have all noted<br />
and which we should all do our best to dislodge, is that there<br />
is such a widespread popular disposition to be critical of big<br />
men or ideas or enterprises, and particularly of great and growing<br />
enterprises, as if in some ways their success is inimical to<br />
social justice or rather literal notions of democratic equality.<br />
In truth, they merely show the pioneering spirit at work; their<br />
success is a proof of the opportunity which democracy gives,<br />
and must continue to give, to talent and character and energy.<br />
In a slave community, the only great enterprise is despotic<br />
government itself. It is in free communities that the citizen<br />
gets his chance. His growth is the proof of his freedom.<br />
Before I conclude, let me recapitulate. I have, it would seem,<br />
stated some principles of management. The manager should </p>
<p>mow his own mind and purpose. He should work with the<br />
naterials he has, and not with those he would have liked. He<br />
nust remember that he is dealing with men and not abstracions.<br />
He must foster a sense of community of interest among<br />
ill those who are engaged in his enterprise. He is to practise<br />
; elf-help to the limit before appealing to Government or other<br />
? eople. He must never lose his capacity for pioneering.<br />
You may dismiss my theme and exposition by saying that it<br />
s all perfectly obvious, and did not need to be said at A In<br />
iway I hope that you can say this, and say it truthfully.<br />
N. othing could be a more splendid proof of the success of the<br />
Institute and of the splendid men who founded and inspired it.<br />
On the whole, however, I think that the criticism is much<br />
more likely to take this form-" Oh yes: it's all very well to<br />
make some academic analysis and produce some counsel of perection;<br />
but business. is a tough practical business, which has to<br />
be learned the hard way, and there's no room in it for these<br />
pretty-pretty theories." So, before I conclude, I will say something<br />
about " tough practical men."<br />
A man may be a tough, concentrated, successful moneymaker<br />
and never contribute to his country anything more than<br />
a horrible example. A manager may be tough and practical,<br />
; queezing out, while the going is good, the last ounce of profit<br />
and dividend, and may leave behind him an exhausted industry<br />
and a legacy of industrial hatred. A tough manager may never<br />
look outside his own factory walls or be conscious of his partnership<br />
in a wider world. I often wonder what strange cud<br />
such men sit chewing when their working days are over, and<br />
the accumulating riches of the mind have eluded them<br />
The truth is that if the second half of the 20th century is to<br />
see a restoration of civilisation and peace, a new marriage must<br />
occur between theory and practice; between the skill of the<br />
hand and the wisdom of the mind; between the spirit of<br />
humanity and the talent of the individual. If we are not just<br />
to blunder along, from crisis to crisis, from expedient to expedient,<br />
we must have in this world a revival in all spheres of<br />
activity, of the human soul and the human intellect. Each<br />
needs cultivating. Each need exercise. </p>
<p>It is worse than foolish, it is dangerous, to regard the<br />
spiritual nature of man as irrelevant to secular enterprise, or to<br />
treat a broad philosophy of life as an intellectual matter fit only<br />
for the university class-room. The basic malaise of our brilliantly<br />
clever century is that we have tended to divide our lives<br />
into water-tight compartments. The enormous and dynamic<br />
energies of business and productive and commercial enterprise<br />
will reach their fullest and most useful expression when pure<br />
learning ceases to be a thing apart, when our knowledge of men<br />
catches up with our knowledge of machines, when industrial<br />
statesmanship becomes recognised as just one branch of a universal<br />
statesmanship, of which the statesmanship of government<br />
will be but a particular expression. ( 3<br />
