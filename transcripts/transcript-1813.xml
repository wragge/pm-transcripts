VISIT TO NEW ZEALAND<br />
WELLINGTON<br />
STATE LUNCHEON 28 March 1968<br />
Speech by the Prime Minister, Mr. John Gorton<br />
Mr. Prime Minister, The Deputy Leader of the<br />
Opposition, and Distinguished Guests:<br />
The first thing that I would wish to say to you and<br />
to those of you who have come along to this lunch is to thank<br />
you for the honour you have done me and to thank you for the<br />
opportunity of having met you and your Cabinet and now having<br />
met, even if vicariously, such a representative section of<br />
New Zealand opinion. I do not know, Sir, whether there are in<br />
fact representatives of the South Island present, but there is<br />
one thing I think I should make clear and that is that although<br />
on this occasion my visit is unhappily confined, on past occasions<br />
I have been to the South Island and have travelled from Christchurch<br />
on the way to regions further south, where I had, at McMurdo<br />
Sound, happy associations with the New Zealanders stationed<br />
there so it is not a completely terra incognito to me as far<br />
as that is concerned.<br />
You were very kind in your remarks to me. There are orn~ n'<br />
two things, before I launch in to what I really have to say of<br />
serious moment to you, which unfortunately I cannot answer. You<br />
asked me how many Rugby matches somebody had won. I do not know.<br />
You see, I am an Australian Rules player myself. I share with<br />
you entirely, Mr. Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the feeling<br />
that this visit is too short, but while it is unfortunate that<br />
one cannot have enough of a good thing, at least it is highly<br />
fortunate that one can have some part of a good thing, and that<br />
is what you are giving to me.<br />
This, Sir, is the first time on which I haves spoken to<br />
a gethering outside of my own country as the Prime Minister of<br />
Australia, and because of that I think you will agree it would<br />
be natural if I were rather nervous. In fact, to let you into<br />
a secret, if you have not discovered it already, I am rather<br />
nervous. But I can say this I am not as nervous as I would<br />
be if I were speaking to a gathering anywhere but in New Zealand,<br />
or to any other than New Zealanders. It is really and this<br />
sustains me no new thing for an Australian to find himself<br />
in company with New Zealanders. Indeed, it is in keeping with<br />
what has happened over the last half century and more.<br />
Australians and New Zealanders have had common goals in the<br />
harsh arbitrament of war on Gallipoli, in France, in Greece,<br />
in Crete, in the northern deserts of Africa, in Korea, in<br />
Malaya, and now in Vietnam and during that time, and I<br />
believe that this is true, those common goals in war which<br />
were attained when the militant Fascism and Nazism of Germany<br />
were overthrown, which were attained when the military invasion<br />
of South Korea by Communism was overthrown, which were attained<br />
when terrorism was prevented and destroyed in Malay-e, have forged<br />
a link between our peoples which is enduring and which will, for<br />
as far in the future as I can see, endure.<br />
But we have now before us goals in peace. We have<br />
now before us goals which beckon us to try together to make<br />
the most use of that opportunity which together, and together<br />
with other nations, has been won in war. It is of this that<br />
I want to speak to you, but before I do, let me just say this.<br />
There has been much speculation in newspapers and by individuals </p>
<p>2.<br />
on both sides of the Tasman as to whether there should or<br />
should not be some form of political unity, and indeed the<br />
Deputy Leader of the Opposition mentioned this, between our<br />
countries; some kind of arrangement by which each one, I<br />
suppose, of our nations I have never seen it spelt out<br />
should give up some of the sovereignty it possesses, some of<br />
the national identity it cherishes. I have no chance of<br />
seeing what in some unforeseen future might occur and I<br />
speak of an unforeseen future. Whenever, if ever that kind of<br />
thing occurs, it can only occur by the nations and the<br />
individuals in the nations of New Zealand and Australia saying<br />
so. But this I say to talk about that now, to worry about<br />
that now, to raise the questions which are involved in that now,<br />
is, I would have thought, not only irrelevant but tending to be<br />
damaging, because it can lead to suspicion; it can lead to<br />
resentment; it can lead to impediments in the gaining of goals<br />
which are quite clear before us and which do not require this<br />
kind of solution in order for those goals to be attained.<br />
So let us put that on one side. Let us put it out<br />
0 of our minds, and let us reconsider what can be done by us both<br />
as we are, with our sovereignty, without worrying about these<br />
future things; these matters which can be achieved by you and<br />
us, bearing in mind that both of us are relatively technically<br />
advanced nations, relatively wealthy nations, relatively<br />
isolated nations as far as the European origins from which we<br />
come are concerned let me put to you what it is that I see<br />
as the closer co-operation-for a common end.<br />
Let me first talk to you about co-operation for a<br />
common economic advancement and for the enhancement of trade<br />
and employment opportunities and increased. populations between<br />
our countries. There was originated not so long ago I think<br />
in January 1966 the New Zealand/ Australia Free Trade Agreement.<br />
Before that time, of course, we had one of those elements which<br />
are claimed to be so significant as a result in Europe of the<br />
creation of the Common Market, because we had taken for granted<br />
the opportunity for New Zealanders to travel to Australia, to<br />
work in Australia, to live in Australia; the opportunity for<br />
Australians to travel to New Zealand, to work in New Zealand,<br />
to live in New Zealand and this interplay of a work force was<br />
one of the great benefits claimed for the European Common Market<br />
in Europe. ' Ve have had it, and have taken it for granted. Not<br />
only have we taken it for granted, but we have discovered that<br />
those New Zealanders who come to Australia and who do live there<br />
and work there have to a highly disproportionate extent attained<br />
the highest offices in our country, and run such things as the<br />
Snowy MountainsAuthority, which is one of our greatest developments.<br />
I do not think we have done quite so well over here, but this is<br />
something of significance, which we have.<br />
This New Zealand/ Australia Free Trade Agreement was<br />
reached on top of that, and I sometimes think that because that<br />
Agreement has not resulted in an immediate and dramatic change<br />
in the balance of payments situation between the two countries,<br />
and because there are, as there will always be in such Agreements,<br />
some areas of exacerbation, that we could tend to write down the<br />
benefit of the Agreement already and the ultimate benefit to both<br />
of our nations. This was not intended as an Agreement which<br />
overnight would alter things dramatically. It was intended as<br />
an Agreement which, as the years passed and as duties were<br />
progressively reduced for the most part over a period:. of<br />
eight years for matters stated in the Treaty would tend to<br />
free trade between our two nations, would tend to help redress<br />
the balance of trade between our two nations and this, I think, </p>
<p>J 3.<br />
it already shows not only promise of' doing but I think some<br />
performance in doing, though, as the Deputy Leader of the<br />
Opposition pointed out, we are four times the size of New<br />
Zealand and you would expect some disparity in trade figures<br />
between a nation four times the size of another.<br />
But let me put this to you. Over the last two yearsand<br />
this is roughly the period of operation of the Treaty<br />
whether entirely due to the Treaty or not I do not know,<br />
but over the period in which the Treaty has operated, our<br />
exports to New Zealand have fallen off I think by some<br />
million or $ 6 million. New Zealand's exports to Australia<br />
have increased, I think by between $ 1 million or $ 2 million,<br />
and this is a move towards what ultimately is suggested to be<br />
the result of this trade Treaty. Of course, each nation will,<br />
as the Treaty operates, seek to protect its own vital interests<br />
if they become disrupted, but still the Treaty was signed and<br />
so far this is an indicationz~ of what is flowing from it. It<br />
provided for a whole list of nominated products which over a<br />
period of eight years were to have duties progressively released;<br />
but again, as a symbol of hope in the way in which this Treaty<br />
is being approached by, I think, both of us, may I tell-: you<br />
this. There was the matter of excuse me if I sound indelicateundressed<br />
timber from New Zealand, which over a period of eight<br />
years was to have duties progressively reduced. There was an<br />
appIcation that we, the Australian Government, should waive<br />
this and should at once say, " No, we will not reduce it over a<br />
period of eight years; we will immediately abolish all duties<br />
on undressed New Zealand timber coniiig to Australia." And<br />
only a week ago it has not yet been announced in my own<br />
country my own Government decided that as a result of that<br />
approach we would agree and we will abolish at once all duties<br />
on undressed New Zealand timber coming into Australia. A<br />
small thing, but an indication of the way in which this Treaty<br />
can work to our common and mutual advantage.<br />
I have no doubt that over the period ahead there will<br />
still be difficulties. There will still bo people in Australia<br />
saying, " You cannot bring blue peas in from New Zealand, or it<br />
will destroy something or other in Tasmania", and there will be<br />
people in New Zealand saying, " We have not really got a big<br />
enough market for our lamb or whatever it may be" l; but these<br />
things can be ironed out, they can be a matter of discussion,<br />
and on the history of the Treaty, so far I believe there is room<br />
for great hope that we will not only have this ability for<br />
employment to move backwards and forwards, but for trade to be<br />
progressively freed to our common benefit, and for joint ventures<br />
of New Zealand and Australian capital to build in New Zealand or<br />
in Australia manufacturing processes such as Comalco, for<br />
example, is building in New Zealand to take advantage of power<br />
from your hydro-electricity capacity, providing employment here,<br />
profits for both of us, and, through profits, an opportunity<br />
for growth for both of us. You, Sir, spoke of the need to help<br />
nations in our region, and I too speak of the need to do that,<br />
and also, as far as possible, to protect ourselves as Britain<br />
goes, as I believe she will completely go, from this part of<br />
the world. That depends on growth, both in population and in<br />
economic resources, to carry out those tasks, and in so far as<br />
this Treaty helps and I believe it does so it will help both<br />
nations to attain what you would, I am sure, agree are , tignificant<br />
go~ als. / 4 </p>
<p>4.<br />
In the field of defence itself lies another close<br />
area of co-operation, not of integration of our Armed Forces,<br />
not of a common commander, one star, for running the Armed<br />
Forces of both nations, though it may be at some stage if a<br />
Task Force is required for some particular purpose the best<br />
commander might be picked from whichever country can provide<br />
him but rather the study in common by an Australian Defence<br />
Committee and a New Zealand Defence Committee of what each<br />
nation was going to require for the purposes of its defence<br />
over thc next three years or whatever time it might be, so<br />
that as far as possible a compatibility of arms might be<br />
achieved, so that we would find, for example, that squadrons<br />
might be partly of New Zealand flights and partly of Australian<br />
flights, and could operate together with the same kind of aircraft<br />
and the same kind of ancillary equipment and same kind of ground<br />
control; so that we might see that if fleets at sea, comprising<br />
partly Australian and partly New Zealand vessels were put in<br />
convoy then the ammunition used was as far as possible the same,<br />
the signals used were as far as possible the same, and the<br />
compatibility was there.<br />
I do not need to spell this out, but it must be clear<br />
that for any given expenditure of national resources on defence,<br />
if two countries are likely to co-operate in defence in the<br />
future as they have in the past and I believe they will then<br />
from that proportion of national resources so devoted, greater<br />
effectiveness can be gained if there is common study at the<br />
beginning of the kind of arms, the kind of logistics, the kind<br />
of spare parts which best will allow the integrated operation<br />
and that is different the integrated operation of forces from<br />
our two nations. And this we seek.<br />
In our approach to foreign affairs there has been for<br />
some time past the closest co-operation which I think is possible<br />
between two countries, and this is whether it means an approach<br />
towards a problem of external affairs posed because of the present<br />
incoherent state of so much of the world, or whether it relates<br />
to assistance in the economic field to try by that way to turn an<br />
incoherent state of the world into a coherent state. These<br />
together, again, are things which we get. They are of great<br />
assistance. They do not require a surrender of sovereignty<br />
by anybody. They do require the abolition of suspicion and<br />
resentment in our own country or in yours. They do require not<br />
only that politicians should say these things and believe these<br />
things, as your politicians and ours say them and believe them,<br />
but they require also that those charged with the industrial<br />
management of a nation should belie-ge those things and should,<br />
by getting together with their counterparts in Australia, and<br />
Australians getting together with their counterparts in New<br />
Zealand, translate the opportunities provided by political<br />
agreements reached into the practical terms which provide the<br />
employment and growth and economic strength we both require.<br />
I am happy to say, again, that there are signs enough that<br />
this already is operating, and I am confident that in the years<br />
ahead not only will we achieve these advanced goals I have spoken<br />
of they are fairly easy not only am I confident there is<br />
unlikely to . be any rift between our approaches to foreign<br />
affairs, but I am confident that firms both here and in my own<br />
country will make their decisions and build their factories on<br />
the assessment of a market available to a firm here or a factory<br />
here; the Australian assessment of a firm or factory in Australia<br />
on the assessment of a market ho-re. </p>
<p>If this happens, as I think it will, and is built on<br />
that goodwill already here, and is built on that experience<br />
already gained, and is built on those sacrifices already jointly<br />
shared, then I think that we have an opportunity and will be able<br />
to take advantage of that opportunity. Perhaps, if this is not<br />
going too far but perhaps let me put it as a dreamer to call<br />
in this regional new world into being to redress the balance<br />
of the old, as once was said about the calling of the United<br />
States into being and when it is called into being, and when<br />
it redresses the balance of the old, it will, if it is properly<br />
done, remove many of the causes of dissension and lead to a<br />
happier and a better life, not only for us and the peoples under<br />
our care, but for the peoples in the region from whom geography<br />
and morality must ever prevent us from being separated. That<br />
is why I attach so much importance to this visit and to the<br />
Australians'and New Zealanders'continued efforts in peace in<br />
the Anzac tradition formed in war.<br />
Thank you. </p>
