    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Turnbull Government is equipping Australian children with the skills in maths and science for the jobs of tomorrow through a $14 million investment as part of the National Innovation and Science Agenda.</p>
<p>Today we announced $4 million each for the Little Scientists and Let’s Count training programs to inspire Australia’s next Howard Florey or Elizabeth Blackburn.</p>
<p>The nature of work is changing. Around 75 per cent of the fastest-growing industries require skills in science, technology, engineering and maths (STEM). The Turnbull Government is committed to helping Australia’s youngest minds develop an interest in these critical fields.</p>
<p>Both programs provide young students with a new way of engaging with STEM subjects which will help to underpin Australia’s competitiveness in the future.</p>
<p>The Little Scientists and Let’s Count programs will reach 350,000 young people across the country.</p>
<p>From seeing how to purify water to exploring and talking about numbers, these initiatives will give children access to fun and engaging ways to learn.</p>
<p>The $8 million for Little Scientists and Let’s Count builds on the $6 million the Turnbull Government has committed for the development of apps to engage children in STEM in their early years</p>
