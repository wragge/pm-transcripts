TRANSCRIPT OF THE HON JOHN HOWARD MP<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
BUSINESS LUNCHEON HOSTED BY THE AMBASSADOR<br />
GREAT WALL SHERATON, BEIJING, CHINA<br />
E&amp; EO<br />
State Councillor Song, Ministers, Vice Ministers, other distinguished guests, ladies and<br />
gentlemen. I really do welcome this opportunity today before an audience which brings together, may I<br />
say, a particularly large number of senior members of the Chinese Government, and in<br />
acknowledging that can I thank Lhose people for the complement that thcy gave to the<br />
relationship between Australia and China. Their presencc together with the presence of such<br />
a distinguished and strong delegation of men and women in business in Australia is an ample<br />
demonstration that on both sides the is a determination to build further the close<br />
relationship between Australia and China.<br />
I congratulate the China-Australia Chamber of Commerce on the first anniversary of its<br />
registration and the successful amalgamation of the three Australian business groups in<br />
China. Let me say at the outset of this speech that I attach very great importance to my visit to China.<br />
My goverment is very firmly committed to a strong and mutually productive relationship<br />
with China.<br />
We seek a relationship which is both strong and diverse and we seek a relationship which is<br />
based on mutual benefit and mutual respect. </p>
<p>This commitment, may I say, is a politically bipartisan one in Australia. It has been an<br />
important element of continuity a constant if I can put it that way in Australia's foreign<br />
policy. This year we mark the twenty-fifth anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic<br />
relations with the modem China. A Labor government under Gough Whitlam was in office at<br />
the time. A Coalition government under Malcolm Fraser subsequently very actively<br />
developed the relationship between Australia and China. Malcolm Fraser's work was<br />
continued by his Labor Party successors.<br />
This visit to China is part of a pattern of visits I have undertaken since becoming Prime<br />
Minister that takes me to Australia's principle partners and friends in the region. I have<br />
already been to Indonesia and Japan and I am particularly happy within a year or so of taking<br />
office to be here in Beijing.<br />
My government's foreign policy including its policy towards China is based on a clearheaded<br />
and independent assessment of Australia's interests in the Asia-Pacific region.<br />
T am confident that after my discussions with President Jiang Zemin in Manila at the time of<br />
the APEC Leaders Meeting that he shares my desire that our relationship should be both<br />
positive and broadly based.<br />
There is little doubt that China is one of the most important countries in our region.<br />
It's hard to think of any major aspect of the Asia-Pacific region which will not be influenced<br />
in some way by China's development during the next two or three decades. It's no<br />
exaggeration to say that what happens in China over that period will be one of the major<br />
influences on the Asia-Pacific region in the 21st century.<br />
The past twenty years have seen a transformation within China. Under Deng Xiaoping's<br />
leadership China threw open its doors to the outside world. It started the programme of<br />
reforms which has seen China begin to fulfil its enormous potential. So Australia like all of<br />
China's partners was pleased to hear the Chinese leadership's recent reatfirmation of its<br />
commitment to that reform programme begun by Deng Xiaoping.<br />
Over the past two or three days in both Shanghai and Beijing I have been able to witness at<br />
first hand China's spectacular growth, spectacular industrial transformation. China's<br />
economic achievements are bringing obvious benefits to China and to her people.<br />
China's growth is beneficial also for Australia and for the region. It creates great economic<br />
opportunitics for China, lor Australia and for our region. Its constructive handling can help<br />
build even greater stability in our region. </p>
<p>I would like to make a few remarks about what this growth means for regional and global<br />
trade. In particular, I would like to say what it means for Australia.. and the part that I would<br />
like to see Australia play in it.<br />
China is the seventh-largest economy in the world and is set to become at least the sixth<br />
largest by the year 2000. Trade has played a vital part in this achievement. Trade and<br />
international services comprise 45 per cent of China's GDP.<br />
In a remarkably short period China has gone from a relatively closed economy to become the<br />
world's tenth largest trading nation. From July with Hong Kong. China wifl be the sixth<br />
largest trading nation in the world.<br />
China's trade combined with Hong Kong's has grown by 15 per cent a year since the late<br />
1970s twice the world's average. China's trading relationships will soon be amongst the<br />
world's most important. For example, soon after the year 2000, China's trade with Japan wil<br />
overtake US-Japan trade which has been a pillar of Asia-P acific trade and the international<br />
economy.<br />
Both China and its trading partners therefore have the very greatest common iterest in<br />
regional and global trading arrangements that are liberal and predictable.<br />
Like the rest of us, China will need continuing access to other markets in ordcr to prosper.<br />
We all need to ensure that markets continue to open up further.<br />
For its part, China is iuaking some meaningful rcductions in its overall tariff rates in the<br />
APEC context. That is very welcome. It will improve market access for China's trading<br />
partners as well as increasing domestic competitiveness, with benefits for China's economic<br />
growth and the living standards of her people. China's trading partners have a strong interest<br />
in the maintenance of open and consistent trade policy and rules within China.<br />
All that is why China will benefit from being aLm ember of the World Trade Organisation; and<br />
why Ausfralia wants to see China join on commercially acceptable terms. The stakes for<br />
China and for the global trading system warant a serious effrt to resolve China's accession<br />
as soon as possible.<br />
This would I believe usefulfly iremovc some of the pressures for protectionism in western<br />
especially Western Europen economies which fear the level of penetration by Chinese<br />
products. </p>
<p>Likewise, China has every reason to take a lead in trade libcralisation within APEC. Steady<br />
progress towards meeting APEC's trade and investment libcralisation goals is our best hope<br />
of ensuring that growth in the Asia-Pacific and China reaches its full potential.<br />
China will continue to need foreign investment, imports, technology and services to<br />
overcome constraints on growth. Much of this will come from among the APEC economies,<br />
rcflccting and in turn further strengthening the very high dcgree of integration amongst<br />
those economies.<br />
Reflecting the diversity of the region, APEC brings together a most extraordiniary range of<br />
economies in terms of size, economic structure and stage of development. It brings togethcr<br />
a most diverse group of societies and cultures. Each member not least Australia has<br />
something unique and valuable to offer to the association and to the region, and each gains<br />
greatly by it.<br />
The value of APEC thereforc goes well beyond the economic. I am convinced that one of<br />
APEC's greatest contributions is that it focuses our attention on the substantial interests Asia<br />
Pacific cconomies have in common.<br />
Australia's relationship with China has long been an important element of this regional<br />
framework. Long before the establishment of diplomatic relations, China was Australia's fifth largest<br />
trading partner and that was in the 1960s as it is today. Australia was a reliable supplier of<br />
wheat throughout the 1960s, during sometimes difficult periods for China-<br />
That continuity underscores the national interests that have driven both countries in<br />
developing our bilateral relationship.<br />
China's economy has grown at an average of 10 per cent a year for the last 15 years. With<br />
good economic management there is no reason why China should not continue to grow at a<br />
similar rate for the foreseeable future. The recent successful management of a soft economic<br />
landing shows that we have good reason to be confident about that. The demand for inputs to<br />
the Chinese economy for raw materials, capital, infrastructure, technology and energy will<br />
therefore be immense.<br />
It is vital for Australia to share in that growth. Australia's trade with China grew twenty five<br />
percent between 1995 and 1996. Between 1988 and 1995, it grew twice as fast as Australia's<br />
trade with the rest of the worid. Our investment has grown over four times in as many years.<br />
Australia is one of the top destinations for China's foreign investment. </p>
<p>I will propose to Chinese leaders during my visit that wc take the opportunity of the twentyfifth<br />
anniversary of our relationship to look crcatively at the strategic partnership that I<br />
believe our economics constitute. Establishing a partnership in growth will bring great<br />
benefits to both our peoples.<br />
As I have mentioned I have brought with me the strongest business group that has ever<br />
accompanied an Australian prime minister abroad. These business leaders are from some of<br />
Australia's longest standing and most reputable companies. They reprcsent a great range of<br />
sectors in which Australia has particular strengths.<br />
This joint approach between Australian business and the Australian Government is a<br />
demonstration of the commitment of both to work together. We are both rcady for a serious<br />
discussion with our Chinese counterparts about the concrete stcps which we might take to<br />
build a new era in the economic relationship between our two countries.<br />
Australia has a track record as a reliable supplier of commodities that are important to<br />
China's economic growth: including iron ore, wool and wheat. Australia is also well placed<br />
to provide China with steaming coal, and with LNG for power generation and domestic<br />
consumption. We offer the technological know-how to make the most productive and<br />
environmentally sound use of our commodities.<br />
China has taken up equity in some mining and resource processing projects. Scope exists for<br />
China to increase dramatically its investment in Austrdia in these areas. I want to emphasisc<br />
that that Chinese investment is most welcome.<br />
Both the Chinese and Australian economies are going through periods of rapid change<br />
resulting from the forces of globalisation. Financial and business services have become more<br />
important to maintaining our competitiveness and our productivity.<br />
I have with mc here today leaders in Australian banking, insurance, accounting and legal<br />
services. Tomorrow I will open a seminar by the Australian Stock Exchange. Australia is<br />
looking for listings by quality Chinese companies to raise capital and encouraging them to<br />
consider fuxther investment opportunities in Australia.<br />
Our economic complementarity is also reflected in the joint venture sigings which we are<br />
marking at this lunch:<br />
the issuing of a busineas liccuea, for example, to the joint venture between Australia<br />
China Holdings and the China International Science Centre to apply Australian </p>
<p>technology and expertise to dealing with water pollution and waste water<br />
management; and<br />
an a~ e ement betwecn the Australian industry Development Corporation through the<br />
China Water Company for their second venture and that is a water plant in Shnoxing.<br />
Australia is already an important supplier of fresh and processed food to China. My<br />
Government's Supermarket to Asia initiative offers the prospect of a large increase in<br />
Australian food exports to China<br />
I am confident, ladies and gentlemen, that our economic relationship will become ever more<br />
important to both countries. This has been the pattern with other regional countries, such as<br />
Japan and Korea, which have followed a similar fast growth path and in whose economic<br />
development Australia has played key roles.<br />
I have naturally spoken today largely about our economic links. The development of our<br />
political co-opcration though is no less important. When I met President Jiang Zenm in<br />
Manila, he made a point, a valuable point, about the value of prsonal face-to-face dialoguc.<br />
I want to build a much closer level of communication between the leadership levels of our<br />
two governments and our two nations. I look forward to the large number of high level visits<br />
planned for the period ahead.<br />
Australia and China have co-operated closely on a whole range of issues in the region,<br />
including APEC and the ASEAN Regional Forumn. As China's influence grows, dialogue and<br />
mutual understanding will become even more important.<br />
Australia and China, my friends, have a long tradition of people-to-people links. Australians<br />
in southern China earlier this century were astounded to find Australian blue gums and wattle<br />
trees in full bloom more than 10,000 miles from home. No-one knows for sure when they<br />
were first planted or who planted them perhaps Australian missionaries in the last century;<br />
or perhaps Chinese miners returning from the Australian gold fields.<br />
Today the contacts between us are growing fast in intensity and varicty.<br />
Australia has a very large community of people of Chinese descent of which it is very proud.<br />
The Chinese community has made a tremendous contribution to Australia and such links have<br />
created a reservoir of goodwill in the relationship.<br />
For example, doctors from Parkes, a regional city in c ntl westemrn New South Wales, at the<br />
moment, are co-operating with the Beijing Hospital in work to understand the causes and help </p>
<p>7<br />
alleviate the effixts of Parkinson's disease. A group of Sydney doctors is actively engaged<br />
with a Beijing hospital in heart surgery. This year the Fred Hollows Foundation plans to<br />
begin helping train Chinese eye doctors in techniques to restore the sight of people suffering<br />
cataract blindness.<br />
So, ladies and gentlemen the links are very deep. They are very diverse. They go beyond the<br />
cconomic. They include the political and as always they include the human.<br />
I am here today as a representative of the Auistralian Government and the Australian people to<br />
tell you that we want a close relationship building on the strengths of the past, recognising<br />
inevitably that there will be differences but knowing that if we focus on the goals that we<br />
have in common. if we recognise that we complement each other in so many ways then wc<br />
can have a truely effective partnership in growth over the next twenty five years and beyond.<br />
Thank you.<br />
