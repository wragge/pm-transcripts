STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
FRENCH NUCLEAR POLICY<br />
The Government welcomes the indication that France may be willing to sign a<br />
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty which imposes a zero threshold on testing, and to<br />
close the Mururoa testing site.<br />
The suggestions were made by a French Foreign Affairs official in a debate with the<br />
Australian Ambassador to Washington, Dr Russell, over night. If this position is<br />
confirmed at a meeting of the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva later today, it<br />
would represent an important step forward by France.<br />
As I said in my statement in the House of Representatives on 19 June and more<br />
recently on Hiroshima Day, 6 August, an international agreement to a binding and<br />
genuinely comprehensive CTBT no later than 1996 is a central policy aim of the<br />
Australian Government. Such an agreement would be a major boost to international<br />
security and to our goal of the eventual elimination of nuclear weapons.<br />
In the meantime, the Government will continue to work in international forums, and<br />
with other members of the growing international coalition against nuclear testing, to<br />
persuade the Government and people of France of the serious consequences of the<br />
decision to resume testing at Mururoa.<br />
We will shortly be in a position to announce the arrangements for the parliamentary<br />
delegation, led by the Minister for Pacific Island Affairs, Mr Bilney, which is to visit<br />
Europe. We are also continuing to work with our partners in the South Pacific Forum.<br />
A special meeting of South Pacific Environment Ministers will be held in Brisbane next<br />
week to discuss this issue.<br />
The Government has received representations for assistance from the organisers; of a<br />
protest vessel to carry Australian and international parliamentarians to Mururoa. In the<br />
light of their advice that without additional funds for a deposit a suitable vessel could<br />
not be chartered, the Government is prepared to make a contribution of $ 200,000<br />
towards this public protest. </p>
<p>2<br />
The Government's contribution will be subject to a number of conditions, including<br />
that the vessel does not breach the French exclusion zone around Mururoa or other<br />
international law, and that a majority of the total costs involved come from private<br />
participants and supporters. The charter will remain a purely private operation.<br />
For reasons I have outlined in the past, the Government will not itself be sending a<br />
naval or other government-operated vessel to participate in the protest.<br />
