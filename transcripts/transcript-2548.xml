been built up over sorme yiars and encouraged byv the former Wcqtern<br />
Australian Coverrnment. If this trarie were to cease, it would be<br />
replaced in the n-orth by imnorts, and erplryment in VTeTstern Australian<br />
industries, suchi as the ti~ mber Aidustry of the qouth--West, would<br />
suffer. The orovision of the grant w3ill enisure the continuance<br />
of' the regular eekly srip! inq service to Darorj. n. Te new ship will<br />
permriit -more efficient ope: ations and the continuation of the service<br />
