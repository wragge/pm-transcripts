SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
NATIONAL ROAD TRAUMA ADVISORY COUNCIL MEETING<br />
CANBERRA 13 DECEMBER 19go<br />
Brian Howe<br />
Bob Brown<br />
Sir Nicholas Shehadie ( Chairman)<br />
Members of the Council<br />
I am very pleased to be with you today at this inaugural<br />
meeting of the National Road Trauma Advisory Council.<br />
When I announced the formation of the Council in August this<br />
year I emphasiLsed that it will allow its members to have a<br />
direct input iLnto the process for establishing and reviewing<br />
road and vehicle safety standards and related issues, on a<br />
national basis.<br />
To achieve a national approach to road trauma we clearly<br />
need to co-ordinate the efforts of the many Government and<br />
non-governmen: organisation whose work contributes to road<br />
safety. The presence here today of my ministerial colleagues Brian<br />
Howe and Bob Brown symbolises my Government's commitment to<br />
work co-operat~ ively to reduce the national tragedy of road<br />
trauma. I am pleased to0 note that we have been able to attract<br />
people of such high calibre to join the Council. As a<br />
result of your presence, this Council possesses skills and<br />
experience of the very highest order, including<br />
medical experts in trauma management and<br />
rehabilitation; transport: economists;<br />
a representative of the law enforcement agencies; and<br />
the motor vehicle industry. </p>
<p>Your collective advice will, I am sure, be of lasting<br />
benefit to the Government and the Australian people.<br />
The Departments of Community Services and Health and<br />
Transport and Communications will, as you know, play key<br />
roles in the working of the Council.<br />
And I have asked my own Department to maintain a close<br />
working relationship with the Council and to keep me<br />
informed of developments.<br />
You may also be aware that, during the earlier planning<br />
stages, I gave my personal assurance to Sir Dennis Paterson<br />
and the Australian Medical Association of my continuing<br />
involvement in the deliberations of the Council.<br />
I reiterate today that my door remains open to you.<br />
Around this time last year, Bob Brown and I announced a plan<br />
to achieve nationally uniform and more effective road safety<br />
rules. As an incentive to State co-operation, we promised<br />
$ 110 million to help eradicate road safety black spots.<br />
And we agreed to invest an extra $ 10 million in road safety<br />
research and public education programs.<br />
I am pleased to say that during the past year all States and<br />
Territories, with the regrettable exception of the Northern<br />
Territory, have agreed to adopt the national 10-point road<br />
safety package that we proposed:<br />
legislation to give effect to the black spot program is<br />
currently before the Federal Parliament<br />
there has been a greater resolution by all Governments<br />
to cut the road toll<br />
Victoria is a particular success story and<br />
nationally, road fatalities have fallen by nearly<br />
400 this year, to a 30 year low.<br />
The importance of the task that lies ahead of you is<br />
underscored by the fact that it is almost a year to the day<br />
since Australians were shocked by the tragedy of a crash<br />
involving two fully laden buses.<br />
With the Christmas-New Year road toll period now upon us<br />
again, it is important that we remind ourselves of the<br />
desperate need for safety on our roads.<br />
With those States which had a .08 blood alcohol level now<br />
moving to adopt, under our black spots program, the uniform<br />
national level of .05, the message all Governments will be<br />
putting out this Christmas is clear if you drink, don't<br />
drive. The lives you save, the injuries you prevent, may be<br />
your own, or those of your own family. </p>
<p>We do not pretend that this Council's job is made less<br />
necessary by the black spots program, or that simple<br />
solutions are available.<br />
We need to change attitudes and behaviours which seem to be<br />
ingrained in-to our society attitudes to speed, drink<br />
driving, risk taking and aggression.<br />
We need to foster greater consideration to other road users,<br />
patience and respect for others. These changes of attitude<br />
are the hardest but most necessary issues we need to<br />
face.<br />
We need to continue our efforts to develop policies which<br />
reduce the incidence of road accidents, to minimise the<br />
impact of those which do occur and to assist the recovery of<br />
those who are injured in crashes.<br />
The National Road Trauma Advisory Council is in a unique<br />
position to assist in meeting these challenges.<br />
It has the support of all the nation's political leaders:<br />
my personal commitment<br />
that of the Premiers and Chief Ministers<br />
and that of the Federal Opposition<br />
Your reports will be addressed to me and they will be tabled<br />
in Parliament. And the Premiers and Chief Ministers have<br />
agreed to table your reports in their Parliaments.<br />
You have an opportunity to influence legislatures as few<br />
other community organisations have.<br />
I encourage you to consult widely with the States and<br />
Territories and with local Government and other interested<br />
groups. I know you will present well considered, constructive advice<br />
and that you are aware of the complex framework within which<br />
advances in road safety need to be made.<br />
But equally, I know that if we work together we will succeed<br />
in advancing road safety for the benefit of all Australians.<br />
I wish you well with your task. </p>
