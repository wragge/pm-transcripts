FOR PRESS: STATEM~' ENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
SVET UNION'SDISARMAMENT.-PROPOSAL<br />
Since in the free world we all wish to see the end of<br />
war, Mr. Krushchev's speech was beyond question brilliantly clever.<br />
But what we have to consider is its concrete significance.<br />
The existence of armaments in the world is not the cause<br />
of international tension; international tension is the cause of<br />
armaments. Had it not been for the Soviet Union's post-war activities<br />
in respect of Poland, East Germany, Hungary and other Middle<br />
European countries, it is very doubtful whether the weight of armaments<br />
in the United States or in British countries would have been<br />
more than a fraction of what it is.<br />
There is something rather ironical in the Russion dictator<br />
offering disarmament now that he has achieved so much conquest and<br />
made so many millions of people his slaves. Another odd feature<br />
of this latest pronouncement is that it comes after a long series<br />
of discussions in the Disarmament Commission of the United Nations<br />
in which the Soviet Union has steadily refused an adequate system<br />
of international inspection to see to the observation of any programme<br />
of reduced armaments. What system of inspection is now offered?<br />
Here again we come to a matter urhich should prevent us from<br />
being too naive about this offer. For in Democracies, the existence<br />
of armed forces and of weapons is and must be a matter of public<br />
knowledge. In a vast country which has no democracy, in which<br />
the press is muzzled, in which people arc allowed to listen only to<br />
the views of the Government and in which communications with the<br />
outside world operate completely according to orders, inspection behind<br />
a disarmament programme is not easy.<br />
The world will want to know a lot more of the practical<br />
aspects of Mr. Krushchev's offor aind will need to have some very<br />
large guarantees of good faith before it will , i ye three hearty<br />
cheers on this occasion. For example, what is Mr. Krushchev proposing<br />
to do about Berlin or East Germany? So long as such matters<br />
of acute difforence remain, Hr. Krushchev is dealing merely with the<br />
symptoms and not with the disease. ADELAIDE, 20th Sept. 1959 </p>
