Now, we hmv a chance of being a paut idustrial ntiot, a nsuaczignadon. I<br />

They are awas about soin it befae than we am ad being up the frovt showing to<br />

om tie POkiCj system and frm the Austaian wmmznity. And we're now seirg<br />
Ig oft poiies home<br />
And the Budget which weCvt just inftdlwed which has had more tha its share of<br />

ConUssB, Resident Clintos s Budge4 with Oe Viso P Castig the caiting voe in<br />
the Seate &amp; CY2 be down to 3% Of GDP only'by the middle 199&amp; s. J other words<br />
asai in fical tetv, ive're going to be ahead of &amp; e world. As wc ae now with<br />
vusmiabfy low inftion and the rest<br />
Now, the AUtra&amp; ia cornmurity has got to think about the long rm and to umderstad<br />
that the Gvenent has to think about their lon rim interests. And if we want hiher<br />
levels of employment and lower levels of aeamployment we have got to get mom<br />
wh. we an't got mom growth without mor uvest ent and we cant get the<br />
investMent if the Government's got its hands in the Uavi cookie jar, tairg the sVh<br />
for publi consumption. But right now we want to kick the economy along with some<br />
Cxta speafin which wil come viato tax cuts, hocaun we need that aw push to<br />
make * e ecooy grow. But as it st growing and we get the investment raly<br />
caciing again we want to pull the public sector ow of the way so te pdvato sector can<br />
come through and create thcjobsL So the balnces have got to be ther.<br />
And a of the people who have urged upon the Govermuet this kind of policy, when<br />
you produce the pokiy they say, VWeo tanrks very much for that but we don't qite at<br />
the way you got thee You know, you should have cut outlays moe, you should have<br />
relied less On reenuC) you should have done this and done that' Well te fact; z, lets<br />
Pay for &amp; e medium to long tm. And nor think about thiMp just tomonmow, bu think<br />
