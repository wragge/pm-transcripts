SPEECH DY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
LAUNCHING OF ' CRICKET WALKA. BOUT'<br />
BY JOHN MULVANEY AND REX HARCOURT<br />
XIRRIBILLI HOUSE 12 JANUARY 1988<br />
With the Aboriginal Cricket Team making final preparations<br />
for its 1988 tour of England, and on the eve of what should<br />
be a thoroughly enjoyable match at Manly tomorrow, it 16 my<br />
ver~ great pleasure to launch ' Cricket walkabout' by<br />
Poessor John Mulvaney and Rex Harcourt, which tell's the<br />
story of the Aboriginal cricket tour, of 1868.<br />
Macmillan are to be congratulated on this timely<br />
publication, which I am very pleased to see has been brought<br />
out in association with the Department of Aboriginal<br />
Affairs. ' Cricket walkabout' makes an invaluable contribution to<br />
Australia's social history and Its sporting history. With<br />
great scholarship, John Mulvaney and Rex Harcourt have<br />
brought~ to life Australian colonial society and the Western<br />
Victorian milieu from which the'players came.<br />
They do not disguise the brutality which marked the race<br />
relations of that era and which was particularly bad in the<br />
Western Districts in the decades leading up to 1868.<br />
Aboriginal social conditions, including health, were<br />
deplorable. Three members of a team who toured Sydney in<br />
1867 died, directly or indirectly, as a result of the tour.<br />
One member of the 1868 team died in England.<br />
' Cricket walkabout' describes how cricket grew up as a<br />
popular game among the Aborigines of western Victoria. The<br />
conditions in which they played cricket were most<br />
rudimentary. For example, Johnny Cuzens, one of the stars<br />
of the tour, learned to bat with a hurdle bar. 003866 </p>
<p>2.<br />
All of this makes the achievements of the men of 1868 the<br />
more remarkable. Their tour began with an eight-day journey<br />
by waggon from Edenhope to warrnambool and a secret v e<br />
departure off Port Phillip Heads for Sydney, in order to<br />
circumvent well-meaning attempts to keep them at home.<br />
While in Sydney, the team stayed on the beach at MIanl y, at<br />
the Pier Hotel owned by one of the tour organiser s, Charles<br />
Lawrence, who also captained the side. George Smith of<br />
Manly, later a prominent figure in local politics in Sydney#<br />
was another backer, who accompanied the team on its tour of<br />
England. An Aboriginal team had in fact played at Manly in<br />
March the previous year and Smith had played in the Manly<br />
side.<br />
After a few games in-Sydney, the team sailed for England on<br />
the wool clipper, ' Parramatta', on 8 February and arrived<br />
three months later. So began the first tour of England by<br />
an Australian cricket team.<br />
As Mulvaney and Harcourt point out, one reco ird established<br />
by the Aboriginal tourists is certain -to remain unsurpassed.<br />
Al though reduced to a mere 11 fit players during the tour,<br />
between their first match at the Oval on 25 May and their<br />
last engagement on the same ground on 15 to 17 October, the<br />
players were in the field 99 days out of a possible 126, and<br />
they ranged almost as widely over the countries as is the<br />
practice of modern cricket tourist&amp;. Their 47 matches were<br />
played in 40 centres, across 15 countries.<br />
Let me quote what ' Cricket Walkabout' has to say about the.<br />
general circumstances of the tour%<br />
" Playing conditions more rigorous than those faced by<br />
modern touring sides also imposed difficulties and added<br />
stthrearien . w ereW himloer e maoft chtehse m, n owrhmiaclhl y adldaesdt edt o onthley ttwiom e dasypse, n't<br />
travelling, often in uncomfortable vehicles and delays<br />
were prolonged while waiting for transport connections.<br />
The houirs of play were longer also than at present.<br />
Play began at 11 am or noon and usually continued until<br />
7 pm or later. The addition of sporting exhibitions to<br />
the Aborigines' programme must have involved even longer<br />
hours. There were no tea breaks and the only interval<br />
was for lunch, a 35-minute period at some time between<br />
2 and13gpm. Most grounds did not provide special. I<br />
catering faclities for the players who had to take<br />
their chance with the crowd which thronged refreshment<br />
tents. if he was lucky, a player emerged with beer and<br />
sandwiches." 003867 </p>
<p>q! t 3.<br />
The pressures placed on the team's stronger players were<br />
remarkable. Johnny Mullagh and Johnny Cuzens played in<br />
and 46 matches respectively. With Charles Lawrence, the<br />
team's English captain, they bowled 4234 of the team's 4983<br />
four-ball overs. These three bagged 609 out of 714 wickets<br />
taken. They also did the bulk of the wicket-keeping between<br />
them, something even Gary Sobers, with his all-round<br />
talents, did only rarely.<br />
In the batting, Mullagh and Cuzens, with Lawrence, also<br />
provided the strength. All three scored over 1000 runs on<br />
toue with Sullagh achieving nearly 1700 runG at the best<br />
team average of 23/ 65. Cuzens scored more than 50 on nine<br />
occasions and Mullagh on eight.<br />
Mulvaney and Harcourt examine in detail the question of just<br />
how good the 1868 team was. They put the tour in the<br />
overall context of the evolution of cricket in the middle of<br />
the last century. The Aboriginal team arrived in England<br />
just when the rules and practice of the game were in a state<br />
of flux. Grounds and pitches were frequently in appalling<br />
condition. My team will be batting 12 tomorrow but in those<br />
days it was common for any number of players to be included<br />
in teams which were often also unequal in size.<br />
The capacities of the tourists obviously fluctuated widely<br />
but, from the authors' analysis, it is quite clear that<br />
Mullagh and Cuzens were class cricketers by any standards.<br />
The redoubtable W. G. Grace praised them for their " very good<br />
all-round form" and their " conspicuous skill at the game"<br />
and although he did not play against them, he included a<br />
photograph of the team in his memoirs.<br />
An idea of mullagh's ability can be seen from an innings he<br />
played more than a decade and a half after the English tour.<br />
Mulvaney and Harcourt record that he opened the batting for<br />
a Western Districts side in Adelaide against Norwood, for<br />
whom George Giffen, the great Test Bowler, bowled unchanged,<br />
taking 6 wickets. Johnny Mullagh carried his bat for 43 not<br />
out in a total of 116.<br />
John Mulvaney and Rex Harcourt have done Australian history<br />
and Australian cricket a magnificent service in writing this<br />
book. When the first edition came out 20 years ago to<br />
celebrate the 100th anniversary of the tour, the book and<br />
its subjects may not have received the recognition they<br />
deserved. 003868 </p>
<p>P 4.<br />
Now, in 1988, with some corrections and additional material<br />
and I am delighted to learn of bill O'Reilly's role in<br />
providing valuable archival documentation this revised<br />
edition, coming out in conjunction with the forthcoming tour<br />
will, I am sure, make a big impact and do something to give<br />
Mullagh, Cuzens, Bullocky, Dick-a-Dick, Redcap and their<br />
fellows the place in our history which is rightly theirs.<br />
Aboriginal people indeed all Australians should feel<br />
pride in the success and character of the first Australian<br />
cricketers to tour England.<br />
May I take this opportunity to congratulate Mark Ella, ian<br />
King and John McGuire and the players, organisers and<br />
sponsors of the 1988 Aboriginal tour on the splendid venture<br />
they have undertaken. You will be great Ambassadors for<br />
Australia and I am very pleased to note that Colin Moynihan,<br />
the British Minister for Sport, has expressed his support<br />
for the tour.<br />
I would also like to thank the distinguished Australian<br />
cricketers, past and present, who have agreed to offer their<br />
services in tomorrow's match for the Trinity Bay Cup, to<br />
which I am looking forward with great enthusiasm. am sure<br />
that the game will provide an unforgettable opportunity for<br />
the Aboriginal crick eters to play with them and the public<br />
at Manly to see them.<br />
And finally, may I also express my appreciation to Mayor<br />
Joan Cooke, Greg Smith and other representatives of the<br />
Manly community, who have shown such goodwill and<br />
imagination in putting on the match. 003869 </p>
