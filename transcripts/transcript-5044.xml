rU &gt; 1<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 9 MAY 1979<br />
UNITED NATIONS CONFERENCE ON TRADE AND DEVELOPMENT<br />
Mr President,<br />
On behalf of the Australian delegation, it gives me pleasure to<br />
congratulate you on your election for this session of the United<br />
Nations Conference on Trade and Development. I-t reflects both<br />
your personal merit and the standing and reputation of your<br />
country. I would also like to express my thanks to Dr. Gamani Corea and<br />
the UNCTAD Secretariat for their work in preparing for this<br />
Conference and in anticipation, for the assistance we will all<br />
receive in the coming weeks. Further, my delegation wishes to<br />
associate itself with others in expressing to the Philippine<br />
Government and people, its warm appreciation for the excellent<br />
arrangements which have been made for this Conference in these<br />
very fine surroundings, and for the most generous hospitality<br />
we have received.<br />
It is a matter of special satisfaction for me to be present a~ t<br />
this United Nations Conference on Trade and Development in the<br />
Philippines, a country with which Australia has close regional<br />
ties and which has in recent years made rapid progress in a<br />
wide range of endeavours, under the purposeful leadership of its<br />
President.<br />
Mr President, this Conference meets at the end of what has been<br />
a troubled decade for the wor] lieconomy, a decade characterised<br />
by high inflation, high unemployment, and, as a consequence, a<br />
dangerous drift to protectionism. A decade which has also seen<br />
a great deal of acrimony and friction between developing and<br />
developed countries, causing alarm in some and disillusionment<br />
and cynicism in others.---<br />
As we come together at such a time, I believe it is essential<br />
that we come armed with a sense of historical perspective, so<br />
that we can see these recent events in their proper context and<br />
proportion. But while the last few years have been difficult<br />
ones, it is as well to remember that the last three decades have<br />
been ones of unprecedented growth and prosperity for the world<br />
economy. In the aggregate, both developing and developed countries<br />
have participated in and benefited enormously from this growth.<br />
2/ </p>
<p>But the aggregate figures hide the fact that there remain areas<br />
of great human need, and that there are countries which have hardly<br />
participated in the general advance. The scope of the gains made<br />
is indicated by the fact that despite the economic stagnation<br />
and slow growth which some countries unfortunately experienced, the<br />
average per capita incomes of developing countries more than<br />
doubled in real terms over this thirty year period.<br />
Indeed, the reason why the last few years have seemed as bad<br />
as they have is largely because they stand in such sharp<br />
contrast to the immediately preceding period. For a quarter of<br />
a century the system worked so well that all our expectations<br />
our sense of what was normal rose very rapidly. During this<br />
period, it was not just the peoples of developing countries, but<br />
those of developed countries who experienced a " revolution of<br />
rising expectations" and a consequent impatience with any<br />
performance which did not meet those expectations, even if by<br />
historical standards it was very respectable.<br />
Despite the confrontationist atmosphere which built up in the<br />
years 1974 1975 and which continued to prevail to some extent<br />
after that, in historical perspective the decade clearly stands<br />
out as one in which real progress was made in the North-South dialogue,<br />
It is worth remembering that the term " North-South dialogue" only<br />
gained currency during this period.<br />
Ten years ago there was really little in the way of sustained,<br />
serious economic discussion between developed and developing<br />
countries to which such a label could be attached. Five years<br />
ago the dialogue was strained and tense. On both sides there<br />
was little evidence of empathy and much of rigidity and selfrighteousness.<br />
To a disturbing extent we were attemtping to deal with very<br />
complex issues using the blunt instruments of dogma, and on the<br />
assumption that they could be dealt with in simple terms of two<br />
undifferentiated " sides"<br />
Mr President, we have not solved all our problems far from it.<br />
And it is entirely possible that if we do not consolidate and<br />
build * on our gains the atmosphere may again deteriorate. That<br />
is the main theme of what I have to say. I believe that the<br />
friction and polemics of the mid seventies were in a real sense<br />
evidence that the two groups of countries, were going through<br />
the painful process of learning how to speak and deal with each<br />
other, and discovering what was productive and counter-productive,<br />
acceptable and unacceptable in their dealings.<br />
If there is less drama and rhetoric today, it is largely because<br />
certain things have been learnt by both developed and developing<br />
countries. In particular, I believe that most of us have learnt<br />
that moderation and compromise are not treason to a cause, but<br />
a necessary condition for accommodation and progress.<br />
Over the last three years my Government has proceeded on the<br />
assumption that it is essential that countries move away from<br />
and break down rigid, fixed positions. We have sought to give<br />
an example. We have worked to strengthen the middle ground and<br />
to build consensus. 3/ </p>
<p>-3<br />
We have done so not only over the issue of the Common Fund, on<br />
which we took up a stance well in advance of the Group B position,<br />
but also in Commonwealth and Regional meetings and indeed wherever<br />
we have been able to inject an influence. Nothing illustrates<br />
the progress which has been made better than the history of UNCTAD<br />
itself.<br />
When it was created 15 years ago, on the initiative of the<br />
developing countries it was received with considerable indifference<br />
and scepticism. Today we are in a position to take a more<br />
balanced view. The institutionalisation of the economic demands<br />
of the developing countries which took place in UNCTAD, concentrated,<br />
and therefore dramatised, the conflict between national interests.<br />
From the point of view of the developing countries this was a<br />
necessary step those who are fighting to have their cause<br />
recognised must dramatise it. But at the same time, it is clear<br />
that UNCTAD has been important in helping to provide a framework<br />
hitherto lacking for the clarification and resolution of those<br />
conflicts through cooperation and compromise, that is, for<br />
constructive dialogue. Such a forum is indispensible if it<br />
did not rxist it would have to be invented immediately. Nevertheless<br />
UNCTAD has shown that its utility extends beyond this that it<br />
has the capacity to be an instruilient for initiating the negotiation<br />
of significant changes, of policies and structures within the<br />
existing international system and a system which cannot accommodate<br />
change cannot survive.<br />
. A major achievement on UNCTAD'S part has been agreement on<br />
the fundamental elements of the Common Fund. The progress towards<br />
the establishment of the Common Fund follows complex and<br />
protracted negotiations between developed and developing countries.<br />
The Agreement is important not only because it provides hope for<br />
commodity exporters that they may have a more stable economic<br />
future, but because it gives evidence of a growing willingness on<br />
the part of countries to approach the problems of trade and<br />
development in a proper spirit; that is, with the aim of achieving<br />
practical solutions to the problems of the global economy.<br />
Australia has taken an active role in these negotiations<br />
because, as a commodity producer and exporter ourselves, we<br />
understand the problems faced by developing country producers and<br />
the beneficial role the Common Fund can play. Our history gives<br />
us that understanding. While our trade has now greatly diversified,<br />
there was a time when we too depended on two or three commodities<br />
whose prices fluctuated enormously. We can remember we can<br />
sympathis-e with.. the plight--of countries.. in that position.<br />
Accordingly, at the Commonwealth and other forums, and at informal<br />
discussions such as that which several Heads of Government held in<br />
Jamaica a few months ago on the initiative of Prime Minister<br />
Manley, I have sought to make other Governments aware at the<br />
highest political level of the importance Australia attaches to<br />
the Common Fund issue. As of now, the Common Fund is far from<br />
being a reality. 4/ </p>
<p>There is much more work to be done, there are more initiatives<br />
to be taken. In proceeding it is imperative that we do not<br />
retread the sterile ground of past debates. The Interim<br />
Committee when it meets must be prepared to produce<br />
agreement on all oustanding issues. Some of these, are<br />
technically complex and detailed technical preparation will<br />
be needed to assist the Interim Committee in arriving at<br />
decisions. I see advantage in the assembling of a group of<br />
technical experts as soon as possible. Such groups have<br />
proved useful in the past and I believe we should utilize them<br />
again. we would lend our support and our own expertise to such<br />
a group if that was wanted.<br />
Governments have also to consider their position with respect<br />
to funding for the Common Fund. Australia will of course be<br />
fully supporting the first window's operations, and the sooner<br />
proportions of contributions are settled between countries the<br />
better it will be. Australia's view has been, and is, that there<br />
should be a viable second window; we will make an effective<br />
contribution to it. We believe that those prepared to support<br />
the second window would do much to guarantee its success if they<br />
could agree on a formula for contributions to it. Again our<br />
support for a second window is firmly based in our own<br />
history we know from experience that such supports as adequate<br />
research and effective promotion can be crucial to the success<br />
of a commodity agreement. We urge all other Governments with<br />
a capacity to do so to adopt a similar approach to the second<br />
window. Experience indicates that those funds which have an<br />
established burden sharing pattern for voluntary contributions<br />
tend to be successful, whereas those which simply make a<br />
plenary appeal for pledges often tend to attract little<br />
support. We therefore strongly support the adoption by<br />
donors of an arrangement which would ensure that the second<br />
window is adequately and equitably financed.<br />
At the UNCTAD IV in Nairobi three years ago this body<br />
adopted a key resolution establishing the integrated programme<br />
for commodities with a Common Fund as a central principle of it.<br />
But while there is now agreement on the basic principles of a<br />
Common Fund, progress in respect of the integrated programme<br />
has been minimal.<br />
Leaving aside sugar, where negotiations were un der way before<br />
the integrated programme was agreed upon, not a single agreement<br />
has been concluded. This truly is a disturbing situation.<br />
Producing and consuming countries with an interest in the<br />
relevant trade should be prepared to cooperate in working out<br />
practical and viable stabilisation arrangements for-appropriate<br />
commodities. Yet what we have in fact is a situation in which<br />
some of the most powerful of the developed countries refuse<br />
to join fully in key commodity arrangements.<br />
It is a matter for concern and regret that the European<br />
Economic Community has not been prepared to join the international<br />
sugar agreement and further that it has used massive export<br />
subsidies to frustrate the operation of the agreement. The<br />
United States has also been unable to participate fully in the sugar<br />
agreement because of domestic political restraints, though, in this<br />
instance, the United States Government has indicated its willingness<br />
to join and in the meantime, to the extent possible, is conforming<br />
with the disciplines of the arrangement. </p>
<p>The result of this limited participation in commodity arrangements<br />
is doubly unfortunate. On the one hand, it becomes more difficult<br />
to achieve the objective which is in the interests of both<br />
producers and consumers of stabilisation of prices on<br />
international markets. On the other, the future of the Common<br />
Fund as an effective mechanism is put in doubt.<br />
In this second respect, if developed countries are serious<br />
if they are to avoid the charge of inconsistency and even of<br />
hypocrisy, they must join and agree to participate financially<br />
in all viable commodity arrangements where they have an interest<br />
in the trade. They must be prepared to participate actively in<br />
work on the other elements of the integrated programme for<br />
commodities. Otherwise, it will be difficult to see their<br />
agreement to the establishment of the Fund as other than an<br />
empty and rather cynical gesture.<br />
I now turn to one of the main themes of this important meeting,<br />
that of the interdependence of North and South, and the need<br />
for a greater accommodation of developing countries within the<br />
global economy. In the context of UNCTAD, " interdependence"<br />
has become something of a term of art. But it has a life<br />
beyond that. It has, in fact, become a standard part of the<br />
rhetoric of the seventies. In this general sense, the term,<br />
and some of the claims attached to it, deserve closer scrutiny<br />
than they sometimes get. We should remember that, in itself,<br />
interdependence does not guarantee a harmony of interest. It<br />
is not irrelevant, for example, to recall that the countries<br />
of Europe had achieved an unprecedented level of interdependence<br />
at the beginning of this century, but that this did not prevent<br />
them from engaging in the most devastating wars.<br />
Again, it should be borne in mind that the existence of a<br />
substantial degree of interdependence does not in itself ensure<br />
that the benefits flowing from it are evenly distributed and<br />
as we all know, economic disputes are often about questions of<br />
distribution. It is important that we do not delude ourselves<br />
about the situation we are in. There is a considerable and<br />
perhaps an unprecedented degree of interdependence among the<br />
countries of the world today. But that interdependence is not<br />
something to rest on it is something to build on: Australia<br />
believes that we.: must build on it by further reducing<br />
restrictions on trade and capital flows. To do this requires<br />
a political will to co-operate and to think in terms of mutual<br />
interest unless and until we do that it will remain part of<br />
the problem rather than of the solution. </p>
<p>-6<br />
Against this background, Mr. President, I want to suggest that,<br />
the international economic system and the long term welfare<br />
of all the participants in it, depend on successfully meeting<br />
two fundamental challenges which now face it: the challenge<br />
of inflation and the challenge of increased protectionism<br />
in all its forms.<br />
I want to lay particular emphasis today on the over-riding<br />
importance of overcoming inflation. Its destructive effects<br />
can hardly be exaggerated. It is an acid that eats away at the<br />
social fabric of nations. It undermines both confidence in<br />
governments and the confidence of governments. It causes<br />
unemployment by reducing profitability and increasing uncertainty.<br />
It leads to disorderly exchange rate conditions and increases<br />
pressure for forms of intervention which inhibit market forces<br />
in general and world trade in particular.<br />
We cannot overlook the conjunction between the increased rates.<br />
of inflation since 1973 and the fact that the volume of world<br />
trade grew at only 4 pe_, rcent per annum between 1973 and 1978<br />
compared with 8 per cent over the previous. 20 years. This one fact<br />
alone underscores the reason why tne world's economies are<br />
in difficulty. Until the challenge posed by inflation is met,<br />
we shall not experience a return to the economic growth rates<br />
which developed countries achieved prior to 1973 and which<br />
underpinned the great progress which was made in liberalising<br />
trade and payments up to that time.<br />
As developed countries provide about 70 percent of the market<br />
for the exports of developing countries, and as the volume of<br />
capital flows to the latter is linked to demand for their<br />
exports, this is a matter of the utmost importance for developing<br />
as well as developed countries.<br />
Given these linkages, it is evident that developed countries could<br />
make a significant contribution to faster economic growth in<br />
developing countries if they adopted policies to overcome inflation.<br />
But this is not the end of the matter. It is not simply a<br />
question of the effects of inflation on aggregate demand.<br />
High inflation rates are also one of the root causes of the<br />
drift towards protectionism. They have created distortions in<br />
our economies which some governments, responding to strong<br />
internal pressures, have sought to correct through resort<br />
to various protective measures to shield industries and employment<br />
from outside competition.<br />
These protectionist pressures must be resisted. If they are not<br />
they will put the future growth of developing countries into<br />
jeopardy. They will make a mockery of talk of " interdependence"<br />
and of claims that the best prospect for developing countries<br />
lies in working within the existing system. If the reward for<br />
success is to be punishment by means of new protectionist<br />
devices, by means of " selective safeguards", by the abandonment<br />
of the most favoured nation clause which in recent decades has<br />
been the only real protection for middle-ranking and less<br />
powerful countries, then what credence will such claims have?<br />
What incentives will there be to succeed? It will demonstrate<br />
that the economic principles by which the established countries<br />
have professed to live apply only to those who have arrived<br />
not to those who are on their way. ./ 7 </p>
<p>-7-<br />
I can think of nothing which would lead to greater bitterness<br />
and disillusionment among developing countries, which would do<br />
more to strengthen the case of those who argue for extreme<br />
policies, than the systematic frustration of their access to<br />
developed country markets by resort to a variety of<br />
protectionist devices. But beyond that, even in terms of<br />
cold-blooded self-interest, such devices are short-sighted and<br />
self-defeating. They deny -the basic truth that the success<br />
of the existing system a system which has allowed enormous<br />
progress to be made in the recent past, depends essentially<br />
on the growth of mutual trade and on maintaining the<br />
conditions which allow and encourage that growth.<br />
The recent MTN negotiations, if disappointing in some aspects,<br />
helped to hold the line and to prevent a further deterioration<br />
in the situation. They made some welcome progress in reducing<br />
traditional barriers to international trade. But most of us<br />
know to our cost that these traditional barriers have, in many<br />
cases, been replaced and supplemented in recent years by other<br />
forms of protection, by quotas and market sharing arrangements,<br />
and by more subtle and covert forms such as job and export<br />
subsidies on a huge scale. What we must do now is to look<br />
beyond the MTN towards the reduction of barriers of all sorts<br />
to the freer flow of goods. It is of vital importance to the<br />
efficient and equitable working of the international economic<br />
system that we ensure the continuation of efforts to liberalize<br />
trade in the post-MTN world. Much remains to be done,<br />
particularly in the area of non-tar-iff barriers. This is a<br />
matter in which all can play a part, working together to achieve<br />
mutual benefit. It is a challenge which we would ignore<br />
at our peril.<br />
As we meet here in Manila we do so knowing that shortly there will<br />
be a much smaller meeting at another place, that the major<br />
developed countries of the world will meet in an Economic Summit<br />
in Tokyo. We also know that, although the great majority of us<br />
will not be represented and will not even know much of what<br />
transpires, what will be decided there could be of great<br />
significance to the issues which concern us. There is, therefore,<br />
a great burden of responsibility on those countries which will<br />
meet in Tokyo for it is their management or mismanagement of<br />
their own economies and the effects of that on the international<br />
system which is decisive. Indeed the holding of the periodic<br />
summit meetings acknowledges the responsibility which resides<br />
with them because of the dominant size of their economies.<br />
I believe that this conference should, therefore, call on the<br />
major industrialised countries in the most forthright terms<br />
to adopt policies to bring inflation under control. They should<br />
do so in their own interests and in the interests of the rest<br />
of the world. We should call on them to resist the temptation<br />
to evade their long-term responsibilities to their own constituencies,<br />
and to the wider world, by surrendering to the pressure for<br />
protectionism. / 8 </p>
<p>8-<br />
Beyond this, I believe that t he individual governments of<br />
developed countries should be prepared to allow increased<br />
market access for imports from developing countries.<br />
Indeed, Australia has been doing this very effectively for<br />
over a decade. During this period the percentage of our-total<br />
imports coming from developing countries has nearly'doubled.<br />
In recent years the rate of increase has been nearly<br />
percent per annum.<br />
We have taken positive measures to encourage this trend. We were<br />
the first developed country to introduce a developing country<br />
tariff preference scheme. More recently we have set up a market<br />
advisory service and held trade promotion seminars to help<br />
developing countries who wish to trade with us.<br />
But there are obvious limitations to what a middle-ranking<br />
country nearly half of whose exports suffer from the<br />
protectionism of others can do on its own. Such a country<br />
finds in practice that tackling protectionism unilaterally must<br />
be a slow and difficult process. That is why we look to the major<br />
trading countries, with the tremendous weight they carry in<br />
international trade to respond effectively to the needs of<br />
developing nations.<br />
Mr. President, Australia attaches special importance to this<br />
Conference because it is taking place here in the Philippines,<br />
one of Australia's neighbours, a member of the ASEAN group<br />
and a representative of regions South East Asia and East Asia<br />
which are both close to my country and among the most<br />
economically dynamic in the world. Our host country is an example,<br />
and there are others, to remind us that UNCTAD need not approach<br />
its formidable agenda in any spirit of despair. Indeed, it<br />
should serve the opportunities that are so manifestly there.<br />
The striking success of some countries in promoting development<br />
must not of course, induce any form of complacency or lack of<br />
awareness of what needs to be done. Some other countries have had<br />
to overcome great obstacles in order to make even the most<br />
modest steps forward and some have even found the obstacles<br />
too great to make any advance. It is a matter of grave concern<br />
that progress has been so uneven and that a significant part<br />
of the developing world has participated to only a very limited<br />
extent in the economic progress of the past thirty years.<br />
The success of this region, however, is important both in its<br />
own right and because it is indicative of what is happening, and<br />
can happen, in the third world. It is well known that some<br />
developing countries have sustained better growth rates than any<br />
developed countries through the 1970S. 9 </p>
<p>-9-<br />
Both developed and developing countries, including my own,<br />
can take a lesson from the recent successes of the South East<br />
and East Asian countries. Of course, this success creates<br />
new challenges and opportunities as old economic partners<br />
are transformed and new competitors, suppliers and buyers<br />
appear. We are determined to face the challenge-and seize the<br />
opportunity of adjusting to that performance and its implications.<br />
We hope that others will realise the fundamental importance of<br />
pursuing sound domestic economic policies and of creating<br />
an economic environment conducive to entrepreneurship.<br />
At this conference the whole range of factors involved in the<br />
development process will be considered: industrialisation,<br />
technology transfer, finance, transport and commercial<br />
arrangements. In some instances it will be true that the most<br />
relevant repositories of recent experience for some of us here<br />
will not be the mature industrialised countries but the<br />
newly industrialising countries not the MIC's but the NIC's.<br />
Until recently these countries were thought by most to face<br />
overwhelming economic difficulties. But they have achieved<br />
spectacular breakthroughs to rapid growth and what is more have<br />
sustained it in difficult circumstances.<br />
Having mentioned the rapid growth of trade between the<br />
developing countries themselves, and the efforts of developed<br />
countries like my own are making to accommodate exports from<br />
the developing countries, it is appropriate to point out that<br />
the centrally planned economies communist countries have<br />
so far proven to be extremely poor markets for developing<br />
countries' exports of manufactures. In fact, the communist<br />
countries' share in developing countries' trade in manufactures<br />
declined in the period 1970-76 from about 5 percent to below<br />
3 percent. When this is set alongside the very low level of<br />
aid that the developing world receives from the communist<br />
countries, it is apparent that the latter are contributing<br />
little to help the development of the third world.<br />
It is to be hoped that the role of the centrally planned<br />
economies increases in the next decade in a constructive and<br />
co-operative fashion. At present what does most to sustain that<br />
hope is the courageous decision of the present leadership of<br />
the People's Republic of China to intensify economic relations<br />
with the rest of the world. The modernisation of the Chinese<br />
economy attracts the closest interest in the countries of this<br />
region including my own and we trust that any impediments<br />
to its progress will be overcome.<br />
Mr. President, the agenda of this conference is so vast that it<br />
is impossible to cover all of the items on a comparatively<br />
brief speech. I-have had to-concentrate-on what I believe are<br />
the key issues, the ones which can unlock the doors to general<br />
progress. I do, however, want to say something about the<br />
question of aid. </p>
<p>It is essential that developed countries maintain, and where<br />
possible improve, their aid effort for many countries whichl<br />
have so far not achieved significant growth are unfortunately<br />
going to need it for some time yet. I would put particular<br />
emphasis on the improvement of the quality of aid, and<br />
Australia has tried to set an example in this respect by<br />
giving nearly all its aid in grant form and by untying it.<br />
Two things must be recognised. First, in the total picture,<br />
as the figures indicate, the role of aid can only be<br />
supplementary. Increasingly it is the right and the<br />
opportunity to trade which developing countries are demanding and<br />
their emphasis is right. It is through trade combined with<br />
sound domestic policies, that they will achieve sustained growth.<br />
Secondly, in so far as aid continues to be important, it must<br />
be recognised that there is likely to be a close connection<br />
between the aid performance of developed countries and the<br />
general growth and prosperity of their economies. In this<br />
respect the general thrust of my comments today have been<br />
very pertinent to the question of the prospects for aid.<br />
The other area on which I would like to touch briefly in<br />
concluding is that of international monetary questions.<br />
We cannot overlook the detrimental effects of instability in the<br />
international monetary system on development efforts. I know<br />
that concern about this basic issue is shared by all participants<br />
in this conference. It is important in this context that the<br />
international Monetary Fund's distinctive role is clearly<br />
appreciated. While the IMF does not provide development finance<br />
as such, the temporary financing it makes available gives<br />
countries timve to adjust their policies to overcome balance<br />
of payments difficulties. This financing, and the pursuit of<br />
sound economic policies that go with it, are thus an important<br />
element in sustaining economic growth in both developed and<br />
developing countries. In approaching its task, the fund needs,<br />
of course, to take account of the particular circumstances<br />
of individual countries. But beyond this, my Government accepts<br />
that the Fund's activities, and its resources, should be directed<br />
towards the achievement of the basic objectives of international<br />
monetary stability and growth and that questions of direct<br />
financing of development are best considered in the context of<br />
other international institutions designed for that purpose.<br />
Mr. President, the task before this conference is a formidable one<br />
and it is very important that we approach it in the right<br />
spirit. We will need to display moderation. Not the moderation<br />
of indifference or lack of conviction, but a principled<br />
moderation derived from an appreciation of the necessity for<br />
compromise and a true understanding of interdependence.<br />
We will need to display realism. We will need to display vision.<br />
And lastly, and perhaps most importantly we will need to display<br />
resolution the resolution to control and shape events, rather<br />
than be controlled and shaped by them, the resolution to face<br />
formidable problems and the resolution to surmount those problems.<br />
With this dedication, with these qualities, I am confident that<br />
together we can make significant progress. We will at times have<br />
our differences. But if we are prepared to seek reconciliation<br />
and moderation we will advance our cause and that is the cause<br />
of mankind. 00---</p>
