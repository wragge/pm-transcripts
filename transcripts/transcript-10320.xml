April 1997 TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
THE HON JOHN HOWARD MP<br />
A CURRENT AFFAIR WITH RAY MARTIN<br />
E&amp; OE<br />
MARTIN:<br />
Prime Minister thanks for your time. In the bear<br />
untouchable? pit of politics, is Pauline Hanson<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, nobody's untouchable in politics.<br />
MARTIN:<br />
Well, when are you going to take the gloves off'?<br />
PREME MINISTERWell,<br />
I take gloves off to real opponents. I think in the long run people will see<br />
Pauline Hanson as one of those transitory phenomena. They come along with glib<br />
criticism, they don't offer any solutions, they look appealing for a while, because when<br />
a nation is going through a lot of change and peoples' lives are going through a lot of<br />
change it is always easy to sort of draw on discontent, but when people see that the<br />
people drawing on the discontent don't have any real answers, they lose interest.<br />
MARTIN: But John you told me last September last year, you called her a one day wonder. She<br />
hasn't disappeared, in fact it appears she is getting stronger. FaFxr om138/ 64/ 97 19: 55 Pg 1 </p>
<p>Fax from PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, I believe that by the time of the next election, which is what really counts inl<br />
political ternis, people will see that like other people in the past they've looked<br />
appealing to a section of the population for a short period of time, and she will have<br />
disappeared. But look there isn't really an alternative policy, an alternative solution, a<br />
helpful idea that has come from her over the last few months. Now, if there were I'd<br />
be very willing to talk about it. Now...<br />
MARTIN: It's been suggested that what she's done is taken all that ground that you took from<br />
Paul Keating on jobs and Aborigines and immigration?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
No, I don't think that for a moment. We've seen this before. I remember when Don<br />
Chipp's party got 19 20% in an opinion poll in the House of Representatives. Joh<br />
Bjelke-Petersen once got<br />
MARTIN:<br />
But you could well say he lost you the election in 1987, and he also lost you the<br />
leadership. PRIMHE MINIISTER:<br />
He was the point I'm making Ray is that it is very easy for a populist without<br />
power to score points off the misery and discontent of sections of the community<br />
without offering any tangible solutions.<br />
MARTIN: Could you lose, could the Coalition, could the National Party specifically lose<br />
Queensland because of Pauline Hanson?<br />
PRIvM MINISTER:<br />
No, the National Party can only lose in Queensland if it is on the nose as a Queensland<br />
Government. Now, my responsibility is to deal with day to day realities such as trying<br />
to get certainty into the land system of this country through tackling the problems of<br />
Wik. MARTIN: Where is your proposal where are these 10 points? Faoxm 30/ 04/ 97 19: 55 Pg: 2 </p>
<p>Fa om30/ 04/ 97 19: 55 Pg: 3<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, they've been exhaustively discussed with Aboriginal leaders and Premiers. I'm<br />
talking to my backbench committee tomorrow and after I've discussed it with my<br />
backbench committee I will make it publicly available.<br />
MARTIN: Are the 10 points now fixed or are they malleable<br />
PRIM MINISTER:<br />
Well the principles of them are fixed. I mean I'm not going to get hung up on a word<br />
here or there but it is a comprehensive integrated plan, it will work. It has the..<br />
MARTIN: But the Aborigines don't say that. MW Borbidge doesn't say that.<br />
PRIM NMISTER:<br />
Well, the Aboriginal leaders have to understand that there is n'o way that the position<br />
that was delivered by the High Court in the Wik Case can be fully maintained, because<br />
that decision was way beyond the original understanding...<br />
MARTIN: Aboriginal leaders and ATSIC are saying to you today as you know that your scheme<br />
will divide the nation.<br />
PRIME MINISTER;<br />
Well I think the sort of language that was used yesterday when some Aboriginal<br />
leaders called for a boycott on primary produce, when they called for disruption to the<br />
Olympic Games, when they called for overseas people to criticise Australia, that was<br />
divisive. And can I say directly to the Aboriginal leaders of Australia, you do your<br />
cause immense damage and disservice by those kind of calls because those kinds of<br />
calls are against Australia's national interest. And at the end of the day what<br />
Australians want is a solution that will bind this country together. I'm the bloke who's<br />
trying to do that. I'm the person who from day one has tried to get an honest, fair<br />
agreement. This country...<br />
MARTIN:<br />
But why is it taking you so long?<br />

PRUME MINISTER:<br />
Because it is can I tell you Ray, this is about the hardest thing I've had in politics.<br />
You have very high expectations from the Aboriginal community; you have an<br />
entrenched position from a section on the other side, and trying to get them to me in<br />
the middle in a way that's fair to both sides is horrendously difficult.<br />
MARTIN: All right. BUP, a boardroom betrayal of the working class Mr Carr called it. Would<br />
you agree what they did yesterday was that?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well I'm very sorry on a number of counts. Firstly, I'm very sorry for the people of<br />
Newcastle. I hope to go to that city soon.<br />
MARTIN: Do they have any obligation to workers who've been loyal and productive?<br />
PRIE MIfNISTER:<br />
Yes they do. They have an obligation to consider their future when they take<br />
commercial decisions. They also have an obligation to have a long lead time when<br />
retrenchments are involved. And I will go to Newcastle myself..<br />
MARTIN: Is that enough I mean, I mean to be fair on this is that enough for you to go and say<br />
you're sorry?<br />
PRIE MINSTER:<br />
Well look, on its own it is at this stage all I can do. Ray, it is the antithesis of good<br />
government for me, a day after the announcement, without having been there, without<br />
having listened to people, without being properly advised to sort of off the top of my<br />
head make a whole string of promises. I can't deliver miracles. I can't reverse BHP's<br />
decision. Bob Car says it's not the fault of the Federal Government.<br />
MARTIN: Can I come back to where we started John and the suggestion that today in the press<br />
that, in fact, Newcastle, because of what's happened there, is a perfect spot for a<br />
Hanson candidate to come along. People are so disillusioned with jobs and with<br />
unemployment and other things. Does that trouble you? </p>
<p>30/ 04/ 97 19: 55 Pg:<br />
PRIE MINISTER:<br />
Well what -troubles me is that people lose their jobs. At the end of the day that's far<br />
more important to me than anything else, far more important.<br />
MARTIN: Well thank you for talking to me as always.<br />
PRIM NMOSTER:<br />
Thank you.<br />
