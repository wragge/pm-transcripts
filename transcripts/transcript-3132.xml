ADDRESS BY THE PRIME MINISTER, MR. E. G. WHITLAM, M, P.,<br />
TO THE 46TH ANNUAL WESTERN AUSTRALIAN SUMMER SCHOOL<br />
UNIVERSITY OF WESTERN AUSTRALIA FRIDAY 18 JANUARY 1974<br />
A SOCIAL SERVICE APPROACH TO HEALTH<br />
LAST MONDAY I WAS ABLE TO TELL A NATIONAL CONVENTION OF<br />
TEACHERS OF MY SPECIAL SATISFACTION AT THE ACHIEVEMENTS OF THE<br />
AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT IN THE FIELD OF EDUCATION IN THE LAST YEAR.<br />
IDESCRIBED HOW IT HAD TAKEN AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENTS NEARLY 100-YEARS<br />
TO ESTABLISH THE PRINCIPLE THAT EDUCATION IS A NATIONAL RESPONSIBILITY.<br />
I OUTLINED HOW THE RESULT OF THE FAILURE TO ACCEPT THIS PRINCIPLE<br />
HAD BEEN " ITO ENTRENCH PRIVILEGE AND WIDEN STILL FURTHER THE<br />
INEQUALITIES'IN THE EDUCATION SYSTEM" THE MAJOR BATTLE OVER THIS<br />
ISSUE WAS WON LAST YEAR WITH THE CREATION OF A NEW CHARTER FOR THE<br />
CHILDREN OF AUSTRALIA AND THE PROVISION OF THE ESSENTIAL FUNDS AND<br />
MACHINERY TO IMPLEMENT IT.<br />
THAT SPEECH COULD HAVE BEEN EASILY ENTITLED " A SOCIAL<br />
SERVICE APPROACH To EDUCATION". FOR THE ESSENTIAL INGREDIENT OF A<br />
SOCIAL SERVICE APPROACH TO ANY ASPECT OF OUR SOCIETY MUST BE TO<br />
OFFSET PRIVILEGE AND MINIMISE INEQUALITIES. IT MUST BE TO IDENTIFY<br />
AREAS OF DISADVANTAGE AND DISABILITY AND STRIVE TO IMPROVE AND<br />
REMEDY THEM. I AM PROUD OF THE IRREVOCABLE FIRST STEPS WE HAVE TAKEN<br />
TO ACHIEVE THESE GOALS IN EDUCATION. I AM CONFIDENT THAT WE CAN<br />
PRESS ON SUCCESSFULLY WITH THE GREAT TASK THAT LIES AHEAD OF US.<br />
v s e/ 2 </p>
<p>-b V<br />
UNHAPPILY I CAi4NOT SPEAK TO YOU TODAY( ABOUT AuSTRALIA0S<br />
HEALTH SYSTEM WITH THE SAME DEGREE OF PRIDE AND CONFIDENCE. WE CAN<br />
BE PLEASED WITH THE PROGRESS THAT HAS BEEN POSSIBLE IN THE LAST YEAR.<br />
THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT HAS MADE THE FIRST MOVES TO IMPROVE OUR<br />
HOSPITALS AND OTHER HEALTH-CARE FACILITIES; THE MINISTER FOR HEALTH.-<br />
DR EVERINGHAM, TOLD YOU OF THESE ADVANCES ON WEDNESDAY. WE AHAVE1<br />
HOWEVER, BEEN THWARTED IN OUR ATTEMPTS TO ACHIEVZE SOME OF OUR MOST<br />
IMPORTANT OBJECTIVES.<br />
THE RESULT IS THAT THE PROVISION OF HEALT H'CARE IN AUSTRALIA<br />
IS STILL CHARACTERISED BY THE ENTRENCHMENT OF* PRIVILEGE AND BY<br />
INEQUALITY. Too MANY AUSTRALIANS MORE THAN A MRLLIONI IN FACT -HAVE<br />
NO FINANCIAL PROTECTION AGAINST THE HIGH COST OF ILLNESS AND INJURY.<br />
Too MANY AUSTRALIANS PARTICULARLY THOSE WHO LIVE AWAY FROM THE<br />
CENTRES OF OUR MAJOR CITIES -HAVE INADEQUATE ACCESS TO HIGH QUALITY<br />
HOSPITALS AND MEDICAL SERVICES. Too MANY AUSTRALIANS SUFFER FROM<br />
A SYSTEM WHICH MAKES IT CHEAPER FOR A WEALTHY MAN TO INSURE H= IMSELF<br />
AGAINST MEDICAL CHARGES THAN IT IS FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT WEALTHY.<br />
IHAVE JUST MENTIONED THAT MORE THAN ONE MILLION AUSTRALIANS<br />
ARE UNPROTECTED AGAINST HOSPITAL AND MEDICAL CHARGES. OUR OPPONENTS<br />
HAVE FREQUENTLY TRIED TO DENY THAT ESTIMATE. THEY HAVE MADE THEIR<br />
DENIALS SO THAT THEY CAN PRETEND. THAT IT IS POSSIBLE TO OVERCOME THE<br />
DEFICIENCIES OF OUR PRESENT HEALTH SYSTEM BY MINOR IMPROVEMENTS@<br />
ON THE 8TH JANUARY THE AUSTRALIAm BUREAU OF STATISTICS A BODY WHOSE<br />
OBJECTIVITY I PRESUME WOULD NOT BE CHALLENGED PUBLISHED A REPORT<br />
ON A SURVEY WHICH GIVES THE LIE 1* O OUR OPPONENTS'I ASSERTIONS. a e3 </p>
<p>-3-<br />
-THE BUREAU CONDUCTED A SURVEY WHICH COVERED ABOUT 30,000 DWELLINGS<br />
IN ALL STATES, THE NORTHERN TERRITORY AND THE AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL<br />
TERRITORY TO DETERMINE HOW MANY PEOPLE AGED 15 AND OVER WERE COVERED<br />
BY HOSPITAL AND MEDICAL EXPENDITURE ASSISTANCE SCHEMES THAT IS<br />
PEOPLE COVERED EITHER BY CONTRIBUTQRY HEALTH FUNDS OR B. Y NONCONTRIBUTORY<br />
SCHEMES, INCLUDING THE PENSIONER MEDICAL SERVICE, FREE<br />
COVER OF PERSONS ON UNEMPLOYMENT OR SICKNESS BENEFITS AND THE LIKE.<br />
THE SURVEY DID NOT INCLUDE SERVICEMEN BECAUSE OF THE FREE HEALTH<br />
SERVICES THAT ARE PROVIDED'FOR-THEM.<br />
THE REPORT SHOWED THAT ONLY 86.5 PER CENT OF THE PEOPLE<br />
SURVEYED WERE COVERED BY AN ASSISTANCE SCHEME. IN OTHER* WORDSi.<br />
13.5 PER CENT OF THESE AUSTRALIANS WERE UNPROTECTED. EVEN ALLOWI1NG<br />
FOR THE PARTIAL PROTECTION AFFORDED TO QUEENSLANDERS BY THE FREE<br />
PUBLIC HOSPITAL SYSTEM IN THAT STATE, MORE THAN 10 PER CENT OF THESE<br />
AUSTRALIANS WERE DEVOID OF HEALTH PAYMENT COVERAGE. To USE OBSOLUTE<br />
FIGURES, THE REPORT ESTIMATES THAT 1.225,000 AUSTRALIANS AGED<br />
AND OVER WERE NOT PROTECTED. IF WE BEAR IN MIND THAT NEARLY<br />
PER CENT OF AUSTRALIANS ARE AGED UNDER 15, WE-CAN CONFIDENTLY<br />
ESTIMATE THAT WELL OVER 1h MILLION AUSTRALIANS ARE NOT COVERED FOR<br />
THE COST OF HOSPITAL AND MEDICAL TREATMENT. </p>
<p>-4-<br />
WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE? THE BUREAU'S REPORT CONTAINS FIGURES<br />
WHICH THROW UP SOME INTERESTING ANSWERS TO THIS QUESTION, MIGRANTS<br />
HAVE LESS PROTECTION THAN PEOPLE BORN IN AUSTRALIA, AND AMONG<br />
MIGRANTS, THE WORST OFF ARE THOSE WHO HAVE NOT * BEEN IN AUSTRALIA<br />
FOR VERY LONG; AND SOME MIGRANT GROUPS FARE LESS WELL THAN OTHERS,<br />
THE FIGURES ALSO INDICATE A DISPARITY BETWEEN INCOME GROUPS; LOW<br />
INCOME EARNERS ARE LESS LIKELY TO BE PROTECTED THAN THE WEALTHY,<br />
IN OTHER WORDS, THE CLASSIC PATTERN OF INEQUALITY AND. ENTRENCHEMENT<br />
OF PRIVILEGE WHICH ANY SOCIAL SECURITY APPROACH MUST CONTEND WITH<br />
IS TO BE FOUND IN OUR HEALTH SYSTEM,<br />
SOME OF THE FIGURES THAT INDICATE THESE CONCLUSIONS ARE<br />
WORTH QUOTING. ONLY 83,3 PER CENT OF PEOPLE BORN OUTSIDE AUSTRALIA<br />
WERE COVERED, COMAPRED WITH 87,6 PER CENT OF THOSE BORN IN<br />
AUSTRALIA, OF PEOPLE WHO ARRIVED IN AUSTRALIA BETWEEN JANUARY 1971<br />
AND AUGUST 1972, WHEN THE SURVEY WAS CONDUCTED, ONLY 68 PER CENT<br />
WERE COVERED, OF THOSE WHO ARRIVED BETWEEN 1967 AND 1970 THE FIGURE<br />
IS 77,2 PER CENT, MORE THAN 53,000 GREEK MIGRANTS OR 37.5 PER CENT<br />
WERE UNPROTECTED: ABOUT 52,000 ITALIAN MIGRANTS OR 19.1 PER CENT<br />
WERE WITHOUT COVERAGE, IF A GREEK MIGRANT ARRIVED IN AUSTRALIA<br />
BETWEEN 1967 AND 1970 THERE WAS ONLY A 1O PER CENT CHANCE THAT HE<br />
HAD BENEFITED FROM HEALTH EXPENDITURE ASSISTANCE SCHEME, </p>
<p>NOW LET US TURN TO THE DISADVANTAGES BETWEEN VA-,, 6US ! NCOME<br />
GROUPS. THE REPORT ESTIMATES THAT 92.4 PER CENT OF PROFESSIONAL,<br />
TECHNICAL AND RELATED WORKERS AND 91.5 PER CENT. OF ADMINISTRATIVEO<br />
EXECUTIVE AND MANAGERIAL WORKERS BENEFITED FROM ASSISTANCE SCHEMES.<br />
IN CONTRAST, THESE BENEFITS APPLY-' TO ONLY 68.7 PER CENT OF SOME<br />
GROUPS OF LABOURERS, 78.7 PER CENT OF OTHER GROUPS OF LABOURERS1<br />
TRADESMEN, AND PRODUCTION PROCESS WORKERS, 7717 PER CENT Or-CONSTRUCTION<br />
WORKERS AND 81.5 PER CENT OF MINERS, QUARRYMEN AND RELATED WORKERSI<br />
PEOPLE IN RURAL INDUSTRIES ALSO SUFFER BY COMPARISON WITH OTHER<br />
AUSTRALIANS; ONLY 82.9 PER CENT OF FARMERS, FISHERMEN, TIMBER<br />
GETTERS AND THE LIKE ARE PROTECTED.<br />
IT IS ABSURD THAT IN A COUNTRY AS WEALTHY AS OURS<br />
DISCRIMINATION OF THIS KIND.-AGAINST NEW ARRIVALS'AND LOW INCOME<br />
EARNERS SHOULD EXIST. THOMAS JEFFERSON SAID IN 1787 THAT " WITHOUT<br />
HEALTH THERE IS NO HAPPINESS. AN ATTENTION TO HEAL-7H, THEN, SHOULD<br />
TAKE THE PLACE OF EVERY OTHER PROJECT" IT SEEMS THAT AUSTRALIAN<br />
GOVERNMENTS HAVE BEEN PREPARED TO CONDONE A GREATER MEASURE OF<br />
UNHAPPINESS AMONG OUR DISADVANTAGED THAN AMONG THOSE WHO DERIVE* SO<br />
MANY OTHER BENEFITS FROM OUR SOCIETY$<br />
AUSTRALIA'S PRESENT PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE SYSTEM IS<br />
CLEARLY TO BLAME FOR THIS SITUATION. DISADVANTAGED PEOPLE ARE<br />
DISCOURAGED FROM BELONGING TO PRIVATE HEALTH FUNDS BECAUSE<br />
CONTRIBUTIONS TO THEM ARE IN NO WAY RELATED TO A PERSON IS ABILITY<br />
TO PAY; CONTRIBUTIONS INVOLVE FLAT RATES OF PAYMENT. IN FACT, THERE<br />
IS DISCRIMINATION IN REVERSE BECAUSE OF OUR SYSTEM OF TAX DEDUCTIONS$<br />
9 t s/ 6 </p>
<p>-6-<br />
A TAX DEDUCTION IS WORTH MORE TO A HIGH-INCOME EARNER THAN TO<br />
SOMEONE ON A LOWER INCOME. THUS, WHEN THE HIGH-INCOME EARNER CLAIMS<br />
A TAX DEDUCTION FOR A HEALTH FUND CONTRIBUTION HE GAINS MORE FROM IT<br />
THAN DOES A POORER MAN. THIS MEANS HIS HEALTH INSURANCE ENDS UP<br />
BEING CHEAPER. FOR EXAMPLE, IN NEW SOUTH WALES A MAN WITH A WIFE<br />
AND TWO CHILDREN ON ABOUT $ 70 A WEEK PAYS $ 81-A YEAR IN PUBLIC WARD<br />
HOSPITAL COVERAGE AND MEDICAL INSURANCE AFTER TAX CONCESSIONS.<br />
HOWEVE~ R, A MAN WITH THE SAME NUMBER OF DEPENDANTS ON $ 400 A WEEK<br />
ONLY PAYS $ 54I FOR MEDICAL INSURANCE AND ER. LYAIE WARD COVERAGE AFTER<br />
HE HAS GAINED HIS TAX CONCESSIONS0 AND TO REPEAT A. POINT I HAVE<br />
OFTEN MADE IN THIS CONTEXT, IPAY LESS FOR HEALTH INSURANCE THAN<br />
DOES MY CAR DRIVER.<br />
TO ADD TO THIS INJUSTICE, A PERSON WHO CANNOT AFFORD<br />
HEALTH INSURANCE OR WHO DOES NOT QUALIFY FOR ANY ASSISTANCE SCHEME<br />
SUFFERS A FURTHER PENALTY. FOR THE COMMONWEALTH SUBSIDIES FOR MEDI. CAL<br />
CHARGES ARE ONLY PAID TO PEOPLE WHO ARE INSURED AND, IF THE UNINSURlED<br />
PERSON GOES INTO HOSPITAL, HE ATTRACTS A PALTRY SUBSIDY OF 80 CENTS<br />
A DAY FOR HIS ACCOMMODATION. CLEARLY, PAST GOVERNMENT PRACTICE HAS<br />
BEEN TO TRY TO FORCE PEOPLE INTO JOINING PRIVATE THE SO-CALLED<br />
/ IVOLUNTARY" 1 HEALTH INSURANCE FUNDS WHETHER THEY FIND THE RATES<br />
EXCESSIVE OR NOT. 17 </p>
<p>I THE PRESENT HEALTH SCHEME HAS OTHER SUBSTANTIAL DEFICIENCIES<br />
APART FROM INJUSTICE AND INEQUALITY, IT HAS ONLY BEEN SAVED FROM<br />
SERIOUS FINANCIAL TROUBLE BY MASSIVE GOVERNMENT SUBSIDIES. SUBSIDIES<br />
FOR MEDICAL AND HOSPITAL BENEFITS ROSE FROM $ 80,000,000 IN 1969 TO<br />
$ 200,000,000 IN 1972, IF WE LOOK AT TOTAL AUSTRALIAN MEDICAL COSTS,<br />
WE FIND THAT THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT PAID FOR ABOUT 54 PER CENT<br />
DIRECTLY AND INDIRECTLY ( THROUGH TAXATION) IN 1969, IN 1972-73 THE<br />
GOVERNMENT CONTRIBUTED 68 PER CENT. ABOUT $ 203,000,000 WAS PAID<br />
BY DIRECT SUBSIDY AND $ 61,000,000 AS TAXATION CONCESSIONS, THIS MEANS<br />
THAT TWO DOLLARS IN EVERY THREE EARNED BY DOCTORS. COMES FROM THE<br />
AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT,<br />
THE PRESENT SCHEME HAS ALSO BECOME UNNECESSARILY EXPENSIVE<br />
AND WASTEFUL, LARGE SUMS OF MONEY ARE KEPT USELESSLY IDLE IN THE<br />
RESERVE HOLDINGS OF THE PRIVATE FUNDS; IN 1971-72 THEY AMOUNTED TO<br />
$ 124,000,000 OR THE EQUIVALENT OF 42 PER CENT OF THAT YEAR'S<br />
CONTRIBUTIONS, THERE IS UNNECESSARY DUPLICATION OF SERVICES BECAUSE<br />
OF THE EXISTENCE OF 81 MEDICAL AND' 90 HOSPITAL INSURANCE ORGANISATIONS<br />
OPERATING THROUGHOUT AUSTRALIA, COMPETITION FOR MEMBERS, WASTEFUL<br />
ADVERTISING AND COMMISSION RATES ALL CONTRIBUTE TO UNDULY HIGH<br />
OPERATING COSTS FOR THESE FUNDS, AT PRESENT THESE COSTS ACCOUNT FOR<br />
AN AVERAGE OF ABOUT 11 PER CENT OF CONTRIBUTIONS FOR ALL FUNDS AND<br />
AN AVERAGE OF 15 PER CENT FOR MEDICAL FUNDS, </p>
<p>-8-<br />
THE FAILINGS OF AUSTRALIA' S HEALTH SYSTEM ARE NOT, OF COURSE,<br />
CONFINED TO INSURANCE. GRAVE INADEQUACIES HAVE DEVELOPED IN THE<br />
PROVISION OF HEALTH SERVICES. AGAIN WE FIND THE SPECTRE OF<br />
INEQUALITY ARISES, FACILITIES HAVE NOT KEPT PACE WITH CHANGES IN<br />
THE NATURE OF OUR SOCIETY, HOSPITALS, DOCTORS AND OTHER SERVICES<br />
ARE SPREAD UNEVENLY AND UNFAIRLY, THERE IS * A TENDENCY FOR DOCTORS<br />
TO LIVE IN MORE AFFLUENT SUBURBS BECAUSE OF THEIR FINANCIAL ABILITY<br />
TO DO so, AND THERE HAS BEEN A TENDENCY FOR HOSPITALS TO BE<br />
LOCATED NEAR WHERE DOCTORS LIVE AND PRACTICE. MY COLLEAGUE THE<br />
MINISTER FOR SOCIAL SECURITY MR BILL HAYDEN, HAS POINTED OUT THAT<br />
IN SYDNEY, FOR EXAMPLE, THE CITY'S SEVEN TEACHING HOSPITALS ARE<br />
LOCATED WITHIN AN EIGHT-MILE RADIUS OF THE G. P. O. AND FIVE OF THEM<br />
ARE WITHIN A FOUR-MILE RADIUS. YET THE GREAT MAJORITY OF SYDNEY'S<br />
POPULATION LIVES A CONSIDERABLE DISTANCE OUTSIDE THESE PARAMETERS.<br />
IT IS OBVI-OUSLY WRONG TO DEPRIVE MOST OF A CITY'S POPULATION OF<br />
READY ACCESS TO THE BEST HOSPITAL FACILITIES.<br />
THE MAJOR PROBLEM, HOWEVER, WHICH CONFRONTS US IN THIS<br />
FIELD IS THE GROWING COST OF HEALTH SERVICES. AT PRESENT THEY COST<br />
AUSTRALIA MORE THAN $ 2,000,000,000 OR ABOUT 5.3 PER CENT OF GROSS<br />
DOMESTIC PRODUCT. BUT THEIR COST IS INCREASING DRAMATICALLY WHEN<br />
COMPARED WITH THE COST OF OTHER SERVICES. HEALTH SERVICES ARE<br />
ENORMOUSLY DEMANDING IN TERMS OF MANPOWER. THE SORT OF LABOUR~ SAVINGS<br />
THAT HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE IN OTHER INDUSTRIES HAVE NOT BEEN ATTAINED.<br />
16/ 9 </p>
<p>-9-<br />
* FOR EXAMPLE, THE SELLING OF GROCERIES AND ALLIED COMMODITIES HAS<br />
BEEN REVOLUTIONISED IN RECENT YEARS BY THE DEVELOPMENT OF SUPERMARKETS,<br />
WHICH OVERALL ARE LESS DEMANDING OF LABOUR THAN THE TYPE OF STORES<br />
THAT THEY HAVE TO A GREAT EXTENT REPLACED. THAT SORT OF MANPOWER<br />
RATIONALISATION HAS NOT BEEN POSSIBLE WITH HEALTH SERVICES,<br />
PARTICULARLY AS COMMUNITY EXPECTATIONS HAVE RISEN AND AS NEW AND<br />
MORE COMPLICATED MEDICAL PROCEDURES HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED. THE RESULT<br />
IS THAT IT HAS BEEN ESTIMATED THAT, AT THE PRESENT RATE, HEALTH<br />
COSTS WILL DOUBLE EVERY FIVE OR SIX YEARS IN AUSTRALIA, ACCORDING<br />
TO THIS ESTIMATE, OUR EXPENDITURE ON HEALTH SERVICES COULD BE MORE<br />
THAN 12 PER CENT OF GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT BY THE YE* AR 2000 ONLY<br />
26 YEARS FROM NOW. THAT IS, IF NOTHING IS DONE TO ENSURE GREATER<br />
EFFICIENCY IN OUR HEALTH SPENDING.<br />
ICAN DEMONSTRATE THE PROBLEM THAT CONFRONTS GOVERNMENTS<br />
AND CITIZENS ALIKE BY ANALYSING THE CURRENT PLIGHT OF PUBLIC<br />
HOSPITALS HERE IN WESTERN AUSTRALIA. THE OPERATING COSTS OF PUBLIC<br />
HOSPITALS IN THIS STATE IN 1974-75 ARE EXPECTED TO BE MORE THAN<br />
DOUBLE THE COSTS IN 1970-71 WHEN THE LAST INCREASE IN FEES OCCURRED;<br />
THEY ARE EXPECTED TO RISE FROM $ 46 MILLION TO NEARLY $ 95 MILLION.<br />
THE SHARE OF THE COSTS THAT COMES FROM STATE GOVERNMENT SUBSIDIES IS<br />
EXPECTED TO RISE IN THE SAME PERIOD FROM 59 PER CENT To 67 PER CENT.<br />
THIS TREND CAN ONLY BE ARRESTED BY A LARGE INCREASE IN PUBLIC<br />
HOSPITAL FEES OR BY GREATER ASSISTANCE FROM THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT,<br />
SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER ASSISTANCE FROM THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT WOULD<br />
FLOW FROM THE FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS UNDER OUR PROPOSED HEALTH<br />
INSURANCE PROGRAM. OUR OPPONENTS IN THE SENATE, HOWEVER, WERE ABLE<br />
TO USE THEIR NUMBERS IN DECEMBER TO HINDER THIS HAPPENING. </p>
<p>THERE CAN BE NO QUESTION THAT TWO THINGS NEED TO HAPPEN<br />
TO CONTROL THESE TRENDS AND ACHIEVE THE GREATER EFFICIENCY AND GREATER<br />
EQUALITY THAT ARE NEEDED IN THE PROVISION OF HEALTH SERVICES IN<br />
AUSTRALI'A. WE MUST ACCEPT THE NEED FOR NATIONAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR<br />
HEALTH, AS IN EDUCATION, AND WE -MUST OVERHAUL OUR HEALTH INSURANCE<br />
SCHEME. THE HISTORY OF MOVES TOWARDS NATI'ONAL RESPONSIBILITY IN<br />
HEALTH IS A RECENT ONE. AN AMENDMENT TO THE CONSTITUTION, CARRIED<br />
BY REFERENDUM IN 1946, GAVE THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT THE POWER TO<br />
PROVIDE FOR / IPHARMACEUTICAL, SICKNESS AND HOSPITAL BENEFITS, ( AND)<br />
MEDICAL AND DENTAL SERVICES . HOWEVER, SINCE THEN THE BENEFITS OF<br />
COMMONWEALTH INVOLVEMENT HAVE LARGELY BEEN FELT IN THE AREA OF MEDICAL<br />
AND PHARMACEUTICAL COSTS. THE MEDICAL BENEFIT SCHEME STARTED IN<br />
19C53 AND I HAVE ALREADY POINTED OUT HOW COMMONWEALTH SUBSIDIES<br />
UNDER IT HAVE GROWN DRAMATICALLY, IN NO SMALL PART DUE TO ITS<br />
INEFFICIENCIES. A PHARMACEUTICAL BENEFITS ACT WAS PASSED BY THE<br />
NATIONAL PARLIAMENT IN 1947. THIS ACT HAD LITTLE SUCCESS AND WAS<br />
SUBSEQUENTLY AMENDED UNTIL THE INTRODUCTION OF THE PRESENT FORM OF<br />
THE PHARMACEUTICAL BENEFITS SCHEME UNDER THE NATIONAL HEALTH ACT<br />
IN 1959. THE TOTAL COST OF PROVIDING BENEFITS UNDER THIS SCHEME,<br />
INCLUDING PATIENT CONTRIBUTIONS ON PRESCRIPTIONS, WAS $ 226.3 MILLION<br />
IN 1972-73. THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT HAS INDEED ACCEPTED A NATIONAL<br />
RESPONSIBILITY IN BOTH THE MEDICAL AND PHARMACEUTICAL AREA ALTHOUGH<br />
WHETHER ITS MONEY HAS BEEN WELL SPENT IS ANOTHER MATTER. / 11 </p>
<p>-11-<br />
THE HISTORY OF AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT INVOLVEMENT IN HOSPITALS<br />
IS IN SHARP CONTRAST WITH THE EXPERIENCE IN OTHER AREAS. THE LABOR<br />
GOVERNMENT INTRODUCED THE HOSPITALS BENEFITS ACT IN 19145 AND THIS<br />
PROVIDED A BENEFIT OF 60 CENTS A DAY FOR ALL HOSPITAL PATIENTS.<br />
THIS FIGURE MIGHT SEEM LAUGHABLE NOW, BUT AT THE TIME THE AVERAGE<br />
WE COST IN AUSTRALIA WAS ONLY $ 1.40 A DAY. THUS THIS INITIAL<br />
COMMITMENT AMOUNJTED To 43 PER CENT OF DAILY OPERATING COSTS IN<br />
HOSPITALS. THE LIBERAL/ COUNTRY PARTY GOVERNMENT REPLACED THE LABOR<br />
SCHEME WITH THE PRESENT HOSPITAL BENEFIT SCHEME IN 1952. THIS<br />
PROVIDED A COMMONWEALTH SUBSIDY OF 80 CENTS A, DAY PLUS 140 CENTS A<br />
DAY FOR INSURED PATIENTS. STILL, IN THE CONTEXT OF THE TIME., THIS<br />
WAS A SUBSTANTIAL SUBSIDY.<br />
CONTRARY TO WHAT ONE MIGHT EXPECT, THE AUSTRALIAN<br />
GOVERNMENT' S INVOLVEMENT IN PAYING FOR THE RUNNING OF HOSPITALS<br />
HAS SUBSTANTIALLY DECLINED SINCE THEN. IT NOW PAYS A SUBSIDY OF<br />
ONLY $ 2 A DAY FOR HOSPITAL PATIENTS, ALTHOUGH THERE ARE NATURALLY<br />
PTHER BENEFITS WHICH DERIVE FROM TAXATION CONCESSIONS. IT IS<br />
ESTIMATED THAT IN 19714-75 THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT WILL HAVE TO<br />
PAY ONLY $ 165 MILLION TOWARDS THE OPERATING COSTS OF PUBLIC HOSPITALS.<br />
THIS COMPARES WITH AN ESTIMATED EXPENDITURE OF $ 5140 MILLION BY<br />
STATE GOVERNMENTS AND $ 2140 MILLION BY INSURED AND UNINSURED PATIENTS.<br />
IT IS NO WONDER THAT SO MANY OF OUR HOSPITALS ARE INADEQUATE. i / 12 </p>
<p>-12-<br />
IT IS TIME THAT THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT ASSUMED A MUCH<br />
GREATER ROLE IN THE FINANCING OF HEALTH SERVICES, IT IS NO LONGER<br />
POSSIBLE FOR THESE SERVICES TO BE FINANCED IN THE FRAGMENTED MANNER<br />
WHICH HAS APPLIED UNTIL NOW. No ONE WOULD EXPECT THAT ANY MAN,<br />
HOWEVER WEALTHY, COULD AFFORD TO PAY BY HIMSELF FOR ALL THE EQUIPMENT<br />
AND MANPOWER NECESSARY FOR HIM TO RECEIVE PROPER TREATMENT FOR A<br />
MAJOR ILLNESS, NO ONE WOULD EXPECT ANY DOCTOR, HOWEVER WEALTHY, TO<br />
BE ABLE TO PROVIDE BY HIMSELF ALL THE'FACILITIES AND STAFF NEEDED<br />
TO TREAT THE RANGE OF ILLNESSES AND INJURIES HE WOULD ENCOUNTER<br />
TODAY. WE ARE ALL DEPENDENT ON THE AVAILABILITY OF COMMUNITY<br />
FACILITIES. I THINK I HAVE DEMONSTRATED THAT THESE FACILITIES ARE<br />
INADEQUATE AND ARE UNEQUALLY AVAILABLE AT PRESENT. IT IS ONLY BY<br />
THE ASSUMPTION OF A NATIONAL RESPONSIBILITY IN HEALTH THAT WE CAN<br />
OVERCOME THESE INADEQUACIES,<br />
DR EVERINGHAM TOLD YOU ON WEDNESDAY OF THE DEVELOPMENTS<br />
THAT HAVE TAKEN PLACE IN THE AREA NOW COVERED BY THE HOSPITAL AND<br />
HEALTH SERVICES COMMISSION. AS HE TOLD YOU, ITS AIM IS THE<br />
" PROVISION OF HIGH QUALITY, READILY ACCESSIBLE, REASONABLY<br />
COMPREHENSIVE, CO-ORDINATED AND EFFICIENT HEALTH AND RELATED WELFARE<br />
SERVICES AT LOCAL, REGIONAL, STATE AND NATIONAL LEVELS", WE HAVE<br />
ALREADY ALLOCATED $ 4.5 MILLION FOR 1973-74 TO MEET URGENT NEEDS<br />
FOR ADDITIONAL HOSPITALS IN SYDNEY, MELBOURNE, BRISBANE. SIGNIFICANTLY,<br />
$ 4 MILLION OF THIS HAS BEEN ALLOCATED TOWARDS THE COST OF PLANNING<br />
AND COMMENCEMENT OF CONSTRUCTION OF A MAJOR HOSPITAL AT WESTMEAD<br />
IN THE WESTERN SUBURBS OF SYDNEY MUCH MORE A CENTRE OF POPULATION<br />
FOR THAT CITY THAN THE G. P. O. WE HAVE ALSO ALLOCATED $ 10 MILLION </p>
<p>-13-<br />
IN THIS FINANCIAL YEAR TO ASSIST STATES AND ELIGIBLE ORGANISATIONS<br />
TO MEET THE CAPITAL AND OPERATING COSTS OF REGIONALLY ORGANISED,<br />
COMMUNITY-BASED HEALTH SERVICES, COMMUNITY HEALTH FACILITIES,<br />
PROVIDED AT CENTRES AND THROUGH DOMICILIARY SERVICES, OFFER A GREAT<br />
OPPORTUNITY FOR COMBATING THE UNEVEN DISTRIBUTION OF DOCTORS AND<br />
OTHER HEALTH WORKERS IN OUR COMMUNITY, IN ADDITION, WE HAVE PROVIDED<br />
MILLION TO ASSIST STATES TO DEVELOP COMMUNITY-BASED MENTAL<br />
HEALTH, ALCOHOLIC AND DRUG-DEPENDENCY SERVICES,<br />
OUR MAJOR FRUSTRATION IN THE LAST YEAR HAS BEEN IN OUR<br />
ATTEMPTS TO OVERHAUL THE PRESENT HEALTH INSURANCE SYSTEM AND THE<br />
FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS THAT FLOW FROM IT, IF OPPOSITION TO OUR<br />
HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM CONTINUES TO PREVENT ITS IMPLEMENTATION<br />
THIS WILL BE VIEWED BY FUTURE GENERATIONS AS A TRAGEDY OF GREAT<br />
PROPORTIONS, THE PROGRAM WOULD OVERCOME THE SERIOUS PROBLEMS THAT<br />
EXIST UNDER THE PRESENT SYSTEM, FOR A START, IT WOULD AUTOMATICALLY<br />
COVER EVERYONE IN AUSTRALIA, IRRESPECTIVE OF THEIR MEANS OR THEIR<br />
BACKGROUND. FOR MIGRANTS, THIS WOULD MEAN THAT, VIRTUALLY FROM THE<br />
MOMENT THEY STEPPED OFF THE BOAT OR THE AIRCRAFT THAT BROUGHT THEM<br />
TO AUSTRALIA, THEY WOULD BE PROTECTED AGAINST HEALTH COSTS, IT<br />
WOULD BE FINANCED IN THE MOST EQUITABLE MANNER AS THE PAYMENTS TO<br />
BE MET BY INDIVIDUALS WOULD BE BASED ON THEIR-CAPACITY TO PAY, THE<br />
PROPOSED LEVY OF 1.35 PER CENT ON TAXABLE INCOME WOULD PROVE CHEAPER<br />
FOR THE GREAT MAJORITY OF AUSTRALIANS, ,/ 14 </p>
<p>-14-<br />
FOR THEIR CONTRIBUTIONS, AUSTRALIANS WOULD RECEIVE A<br />
COMPREHENSIVE RANGE OF MEDICAL AND HOSPITAL TREATMENT, IF A DOCTOR<br />
SENDS HIS BILL DIRECT TO THE PROPOSED HEALTH INSURANCE COMMISSION,<br />
HIS PATIENT WILL NOT HAVE TO PAY ANYTHING FOR MEDICAL TREATMENT,<br />
EVEN IF THE DOCTOR SENDS HIS BILL TO HIS PATIENT, THE COMMISSION<br />
WILL PAY AT LEAST 85 PER CENT OF THE SCHEDULED FEE, AND IN NO CASE,<br />
WHERE THE SCHEDULED FEE IS CHARGEDI WOULD THE PATIENT HAVE TO PAY<br />
MORE THAN $ 5 FOR ANY MEDICAL SERVICES, To DISMISS IMMEDIATELY ONE<br />
PHONY ISSUE THAT HAS BEEN RAISED BY OUR OPPONENTS, THESE ARRANGEMENTS<br />
WOULD APPLY TO SERVICES PROVIDED BY ANY DOCTOR THAT ANY PATIENT<br />
CHOSE TO CONSULT, FOR HOSPITAL TREATMENTI EVERYONE WOULD BE<br />
ENTITLED TO FREE STANDARD WARD TREATMENT; ADMISSION TO THIESE WARDS<br />
WOULD NOT BE RESTRICTED TO PEOPLE WHO SATISFY THE SAVAGE MEANS<br />
TESTS WHICH APPLY IN SOME STATES AT PRESENT, THE PROGRAM WOULD<br />
ACHIEVE THIS GOAL WITHOUT DESTROYING THE VIABILITY AND INDEPENDENCE<br />
OF RELIGIOUS, CHARITABLE AND COMMUNITY HOSPITALS, PATIENTS IN<br />
PRIVATE WARDS OF PUBLIC HOSPITALS OR IN PRIVATE HOSPITALS WOULD<br />
ATTRACT A BED SUBSIDY OF $ 16 A DAY FROM THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT,<br />
A CONSIDERABLE IMPROVEMENT ON THE $ 2 A DAY WHICH IS CURRENTLY PAID.<br />
THE GOVERNMENT AIMS TO ENSURE THAT PRIVATE INSURANCE IS AVAILABLE<br />
AT REASONABLE COST TO COVER ANY EXTRA CHARGES FACED BY PRIVATE<br />
PATIENTS, </p>
<p>ONE OF THE GREAT AND CONTINUING BENEFITS THAT WOULD FLOW<br />
FROM THE HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM WOULD BE IN THE FINANCING OF PUBLIC<br />
HOSPITALS. UNDER BILATERAL. AGREEMENTS WITH EACH STATE, THE AUSTRALIAN<br />
GOVERNMENT WOULD BE PREPARED TO MEET 50 PER CENT OF THE NET OPERATING<br />
COSTS OF PUBLIC HOSPITALS. PUBLIC HOSPITALS IN ALL STATES WOULD<br />
BENEFIT FROM THESE ARRANGEMENTS. THE TOTAL GAIN TO STATE GOVERNMENTS<br />
IN 1974-75 WOULD BE $ 80 MILLION. IN WESTERN AUSTRALIA, TO REFER<br />
TO MY EARLIER EXAMPLE, THE STATE WOULD GAIN AN EXTRA $ 9 MILLION<br />
FROM THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT.<br />
THE HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM, COMBINED WITH THE WORK OF<br />
THE HOSPITALS AND HEALTH SERVICES COMMISSION, WOULD PROVIDE THE<br />
MACHINERY TO ENABLE A CLOSER SCRUTINY OF THE USE OF OUR RESOURCES<br />
FOR HEALTH SERVICES AND GREATER EFFICIENCY. TO GIVE A MINOR EXAMPLE,<br />
THE OPERATING COSTS OF THE HEALTH INSURANCE COMMISSION WOULD BE ONLY<br />
ABOUT 6 PER CENT OF CONTRIBUTIONS COMPARED TO THE 11 PER CENT<br />
CURRENTLY SPENT BY PRIVATE HEALTH FUNDS.<br />
SOME OF YOU MAY HAVE WONDERED WHY, IN AN ADDRESS " A SOCIAL<br />
SERVICE APPROACH To HEALTH", I HAVE MENTIONED SO FREQUENTLY. THE<br />
WORD EFFICIENCY. THE REASON IS SIMPLE. WE CANNOT ALLOW HEALTH<br />
COSTS IN AUSTRALIA TO RISE UNCONTROLLABLY. AT THE SAME TIME WE<br />
ARE DETERMINED TO PROVIDE ADEQUATE HEALTH SERVICES FOR ALL AUSTRALIANS.<br />
WE MUST THEREFORE ENSURE THAT EVERY DOLLAR WE SPEND IS SPENT WISELY.<br />
WE MUST ENSURE THAT WASTEFUL EXPENDITURE IS AVOIDED IN AREAS OF<br />
PLENTY SO THAT THE MONEY SAVED CAN BE DEVOTED TO AREAS OF NEED. / 116 </p>
<p>-16-<br />
As I ASSUME YOU ALL KNOW, OUR PLANS HAVE FOUNDERED, AT<br />
LEAST TEMPORARILY, ON THE ROCK OF THE SENATE, THE GOVERNMENT IS<br />
NOW CONSIDERING ITS POSITION IN RELATION TO THE HEALTH INSURANCE<br />
PROGRAM. M HAYDEN IS LEAVING AUSTRALIA IN JUST OVE( A WELK<br />
EXAMINE HEALTH SYSTEMS OVERSEAS, PARTICULARLY THE CANADIAN AND<br />
AMERICAN FEDERATIONS. THIS DOES NOT MEAN THAT WE HAVE ABANDONED<br />
OUR LEGISLATION. BUT WE MUST LOOK AT ALTERNATIVE SYSTEMS OF<br />
FINANCING HEALTH SERVICES, PARTICULARLY PUBLIC HOSPITALS, TO ENSURE<br />
THAT WE MEET OUR NATIONAL RESPONSIBILITY. SINCE THE 1946 REFERENDUM<br />
THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT HAS HAD THE RIGHT AND DUTY TO PROVIDE<br />
MEDICAL SERVICES, UNLESS THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT THE PRESENT<br />
GOVERNMENT AND FUTURE GOVERNMENTS ACCEPT THIS RESPONSIBILITY,<br />
WE WILL NEVER SATISFY THE OBJECTIVES OF A SOCIAL SERVICE APPROACH<br />
TO HEALTH IN THIS COUNTRY. UNLESS WE ACCEPT OUR NATIONAL<br />
RESPONSIBILITY, INEQUALITY, PRIVILEGE AND INADEQUACIES WILL CONTINUE<br />
TO CHARACTERISE OUR HEALTH SYSTEM. </p>
