PRIME MINISTER1<br />
* TBNS JPT or U= fWVIW WITH W= AL = M~ D LDr TomeO 18 sunMER, 1990.<br />
E &amp; E 0-PROF 4EJY<br />
in I'm ta. 1king to the Pri xr Minister, Bob Hawks about our bid.<br />
PM: 1 I'm not being brash about it Rmnald, but z mtU say that since Ive<br />
beenl , all the reactions I've got are very positive. Tho hasn't been any<br />
knaokih9j of Malbou=, a and thares been a rooognition of the very fftrM9<br />
intrin~ ic irrits of the Mlbourns canditaturs. I<br />
MADONALDi Wll could we perhaps put out in front what are the strongest points<br />
you be . ive mvlbouna has and Australia bas a~ minst the other candidates?<br />
F~ i rt think the intrinsic muxitu go to the quality of the facilities. Elame<br />
of thaj thirteexi major sporting corVlexes = xe ready, we hmv a stadiumo a nujor<br />
stacin which will take a hw~ dred and two thoum-An people already in place<br />
which . a bigqr than any other candidate city has.. We have the centrality of<br />
the fabilitias, all the great mrajority of th) e facilities are within sixc<br />
kñ 1cxntres of the centre of the city, we have an *=~ 1lent village pxuposal,<br />
wehaysa all the infrastruture which is necessary, like c~ mT~ micat ions,<br />
transport and security. We have a sport-nW natñ M " n M'lbourne the<br />
sporti 1-rddest population, so you're going to have great local anthuian.<br />
An 14vel of govsz~ amnt, Fbdered, State and MBIubourna City Council totlly<br />
= miitedand across the political spactrm. W&amp; also hmv security,<br />
I nean Australia ia Just about the mrot secuxre country in the world and * v have<br />
an id~ al anvirowent, clean atmosphere, particularly at that tims of the yeaw<br />
it Ias n idea]. atmiosphere so if you look at all those intrinsice I think that<br />
M lbo ' 4r~ hag a tronger case than any othr.<br />
wat about in the spirit of. the gae moving around to different<br />
saJt of ths world and the faot timt its ' aonly been the southern hemisphere<br />
once l~ ora in the last hundred years. Ho'&amp; w improtant do you think that hias been?<br />
PM artainly it' ' a mtter that' I bsen rai4 W positively with TMe by a fludb=<br />
of mrr~ ers of the comittee. I didn't push that point original3ly, I was going<br />
o oto it, but a tni. esr of them apontaneously raised it. z think they<br />
feel ha with ahundred years of n nOlyTpicaas it will be in 1996, for in<br />
a h=~ r years only to have been to the BouthXT-hemisphere once, would be a<br />
pretty significant imrbalance. / 2 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
MACDa~ You've also indicated that this is an Australia-wid* effort.<br />
We've got SaLlyann Atkinson from~ Brisbane and all the otbers, r~ r John mmwon,<br />
8o it covers political banner. too. Will the benefits though, cneto<br />
Autialia am a whole or just to Victoria or MaThourns?<br />
PM: Ch Oeartainly to Australia as a whole. I believe that Autralia as is<br />
whob owes a great debt of gratitude to the peorple and the organisations of<br />
Jblurns for the way in which they have ozxymised this bid, it's been firstc1&amp;<br />
as But reciprocal3ly, Melbourne owes a debt of gratitude to ths whole of<br />
Aunt ia for teway inwhich theyhave abhind thebid. As I'vesaid<br />
bf, that ' s typified for instance by Sallyanne Atkinson who bets camu here.<br />
and s really working vary hard and has been working very hard, But that'sa<br />
typi of the way Australia has said, this is an Australian bid and not just<br />
Nilbourns, and it will be to the bensf it of the whole of Australia as well as<br />
just t itra<br />
MACD4A~ sWhat about those who perhaps are still unconvinced about Victoria's<br />
ability to afford it first of al. 1, and secondly the benefits flowing right<br />
thraiagout te ooimuity?<br />
PMt Okay, let ne go to each of those points in turn. of course Melbourne<br />
and wtralia can afford it. When you are making assesanuntis of these kinds<br />
yoU'y got to look at nett benefita. True it is that thsre'll be a cost to<br />
both the Victorian Govarnrrant and the Aust ralian Govrflnut, but there'll be<br />
great benefits will flow = nd in nett tanm Victoria and Australia will be<br />
sign 4f icantly better off. Australians, not only in enterprises but indivi dual i<br />
in t ' e whola of Australia will banefit because when you have what will bo tons<br />
oE UousufldB of people ceming to malbouzrne for the Olyrrpicas if we wine<br />
then fyou will " et the rmtipliar effects in the eoonary of a very conuiderable<br />
expwiditure of iruney. tsut they will also camu back, Australia h8a 90JL so nuch<br />
V" i1 is attractive and it's such a secure place, that on~ ce people have = noT<br />
and taated the dalights of Australia and when they've seen the range of what'sa<br />
avai1Able they'll want to cam back.<br />
M. DTNALDs I spoke ea~ rlie~ r today to Clive Lloyd and it's rather ironic<br />
that Ih-is now 1 eaei ng a second contest. against Australia, repzusenting or<br />
bein part of the delegat ion representing Manchester anld of course captaininag<br />
the ljt Tndies against Australia. He spoke well of Australia, but he<br />
did ~ losay that no oountry really loses if they're not selected.<br />
th benefits of even chLlenging remain with the country. Do you believe<br />
that' true?<br />
PMi I think that ' s true to an extent, but in life second ' s never as good as<br />
firs 4. But it is true, Australia will have been benefited by the qualitY<br />
of i~ s presentation. </p>
<p>-3-<br />
M=* MD: Now what about a place like Manchster and certainly let's talk<br />
abour Atlanta, as on* of the strong ohallenges. Do you believe that<br />
it ' s logical for acmeware like Atlanta to be considered again so soon<br />
afte Los Angeles?<br />
PM. On~ e of the things that'sa inprevseci me about trA way the Melbourne<br />
re sentatives aw4 tileir supporters have put their cuse is it's been very<br />
potiive, and I've tried to do exactly the s" e thing nvslf. I'm not hmr<br />
to ockXAtlanta, let ma say in fact that i th Atlntahas VISyILdT<br />
Hay g said that, I think that it would be unfortunate if, an I-say,<br />
wG9 into 1996, on&amp; hundred years of modern Oyrrpics and at that stage It had<br />
only been once in the southern hwmiphere, that would be an kJdalance.<br />
That's not said against Atlanta, I repeat that, but I think that desonU<br />
woul be unfortunate.<br />
MXIQDi I spokce also to Debbie Flintoff-K( ing and her wmtional owT1itrrant<br />
is ite substantial and yet Greg Nornn is not an athlete who's going to be<br />
in t Ganus is also suppotivs. * Just aj word about the athletes and their<br />
cont ibution.<br />
P'a They've been guperb. You irantion those two, Debbie is ma~ gnificent,<br />
Gregq been bri I Ii ant, he went out and played golf on, Sunday mning with<br />
a nura of them~ &amp; An I think he said he was prepared to miss a few putts.<br />
So f ) r a professional like Greg, greater Ioe bath -no man than this.<br />
And ) ne other sportesren who perhaps hbaan It got -the mmn profile of<br />
expo 3ure in this, but who I respect very uch, ia M~ ray Roe, who I been<br />
livi g in the Unrited States for so long but still regards himself * as<br />
an A 1tralian and wants -to back to Australia.-He'Is been superbj the way<br />
baes been rioving around and arguing our ca0..<br />
NACD6, WLDt Airight, just-a last queStion Prime Minister, and thanks for<br />
spending the tin-a with us<br />
PM: 1itr-a. p1easure.<br />
INALDi but you're going to be the main person in this<br />
pres mtation, you're going to have forty-five mainutais in front of a jury<br />
as A. were. How irr~ rtant is it, and is it one of the greater tirrma whaft<br />
YOU'V been Put under pressure?<br />
PM I don't feel under pressure, and I say that for these rsasons.<br />
Cne, we've 9ot a good case. Whn you're under pressure-, as if you've got oars<br />
doub~ a about your casa, but I fael so confident of the case.<br />
And bf course I ' won't be speaking for that sort period of t im. I'll speak<br />
for about four minutes and then vary, very briefly a seondx tira. I will be<br />
surrounded by a Mrat team, fromn John Ral~ ph as Cain, right through<br />
they have been superb, so that gives you a feeling of confidence. ./ 4 </p>
<p>-4-<br />
And thidl, i will have had the opportunity by thon of rmemtng a Large<br />
n of the Trbars of the Cdmnitte end I-reupeo them, so I feel it'll be<br />
two-ay cminioation rather than a pioe of advocacy,<br />
Mar~ fr~ Lj Aright, well think you a Troh Prim Minñ ter,<br />
and vewih you well.<br />
iTr ek you very rnuch indeed Rnald. </p>
