HOST: Prime Minister, it now seems certain this disaster is going to get much worse before it gets better. How much help can you provide to Queensland? Will the army be sent in large numbers?</p>
<p>PM: Our Australian Defence Force personnel are already out on the ground. They have been working with Queensland across this emerging flood crisis and we have had helicopters in the air today assisting with search and rescue work.</p>
<p>I've certainly said to the Premier of Queensland that anything she and the people of Queensland need from our Australian Defence Force will be provided to help Queenslanders as they face this grim and rapidly evolving crisis.</p>
<p>HOST: Prime Minister, like many of us, as an individual, how helpless do you feel locking at the pictures of such unbelievable destruction?</p>
<p>I've been shocked by the images and obviously very, very saddened to hear that nine Australians have lost their lives, including some children and I can understand that there are many families who are frightened, anxiously waiting for news about what has happened to their loved ones and at the same time people are still bracing for flood waters.</p>
<p>We are going to be working with through the Defence Force but also through making available emergency payments. There is a number that people can ring, 180 22 66 and we have got more than 1,000 Centrelink staff focused on flood work. Mark, this is a very grim situation now and Queensland is going to need us to stand shoulder to shoulder with Queenslanders over months and months and months of recovery and we will be there doing just that. I'm sure that's how all Australians feel tonight.</p>
<p>HOST: Prime Minister, speaking of shoulder to shoulder, are you intending to visit the disaster zone?</p>
<p>PM: I will be travelling to Brisbane this evening, later tonight, so I will be there on the ground tomorrow.</p>
<p>HOST: Prime Minister, thanks for your time.</p>
