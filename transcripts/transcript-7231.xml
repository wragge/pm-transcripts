ADELAIDE -5 OCTOBER 1987<br />

Woody Allen has described a nightmare in which, at the point<br />
of death, with his whole life apparently flashing before his<br />
eyes in a split second, he suddenly realises that it is not<br />
his life at all which he is reviewing, but somebody else's.<br />
Let me place it firmly on the record now, that if I have to<br />
relive someone else's life in my last moments, I want it to<br />
be Don Bradman's.<br />
For, like Richie Benaud, I belong to that generation of<br />
Australians which grew up with the Don as their hero of<br />
heroes. As I shall go on to discuss, the Bradman legend is<br />
based on much more than mere statistics. But the figures<br />
bear some recountiftg.<br />
In 1929, the year I was born, he set a record for that time<br />
of 1690 runs in an Australian season at an average of 94.<br />
The following year, he put England to the sword on their<br />
home turf to the tune of 974 runs at an average of 139 in<br />
five tests. This is still a world record.<br />
As we all know, these prodigious scoring feats by our<br />
champion led the old enemy in 1932-33 to resort to bodyline,<br />
cricket's equivalent of the poisoned apple. I would have<br />
been about three at the time but feel sure that I would have<br />
shared the national sense of outrage. Although Bradman's<br />
mortality was, temporarily at any rate, re-established by<br />
Jardine, Larwood and Co., he nevertheless registered an<br />
average of " only" 56 and a half, a performance which most<br />
other batsmen would be happy to settle for in any series. 0 01 i<br />
I I </p>
<p>2.<br />
And with bodyline properly banned, Don continued to carry<br />
all before him, finishing with the staggering first class<br />
figures of just over 28,000 runs at 95 and just under 7,000<br />
in Tests at the tantalising but tremendous 99.94. When it<br />
is remembered that, in 1948 at the age of 40, Don scored<br />
500 runs at 72 in a Test series against England, we can only<br />
lament his loss to the first-class game during the years of<br />
the Second World War and speculate on what additional<br />
records he might have set.<br />
As a general note on his run-scoring ability, I can mention<br />
a thoughtful and kind letter which Don wrote to me in<br />
response to my greet~ ings on his 75th birthday. He commented<br />
that this anniversary had led him to realise that he had<br />
never scored 75 in k first class match.<br />
At first, I found this a little surprising. But then I<br />
thought, not really -,~ with Don you might look for 175 as a<br />
start, 275 if he was trying, and 375 if the circumstances<br />
really required it.<br />
It was not merely his extraordinary run-scoring feats but<br />
his manner of achieving them which made Bradman a hero in<br />
his own country and a household name wherever cricket is<br />
played. He was, quite simply, a wonderfully entertaining<br />
batsman, who attracted hundreds of thousands of fans to see<br />
him around the wo rld. 6<br />
There was no lamenting any lack of bright cricket in the<br />
Bradman era. For the opposition, it tended to be not so<br />
much bright as blinding. The Australians won their matches<br />
in the 1930' s by tremendous batting, led by the great man<br />
himself, supported by the likes of Bill Ponsford, Stan<br />
McCabe and Bill Woodfull. This gave those superb spinners,<br />
Clarrie Grimmett and Bill O'Reilly, the chance to bowl the<br />
other side out twice.<br />
In Don's brief'post-war career, the same batting recipe<br />
applied, this time in the form of players like Arthur<br />
Morris, Sid Barnes, Lindsay Hassett, Neil Harvey, with the<br />
bowling damage done by the speed and fire of Ray Lindwall,<br />
Keith Miller and Bill Johnston.<br />
And it should be remembered that Bradman towered over an era<br />
of batting giants. Apart from the great Australian players<br />
I have mentioned, English teams he played against included<br />
Jack Hobbs, Herbert Sutcliffe, Wally Hammond,<br />
Maurice Leyland, Len Hutton and Denis Compton.<br />
If I have talked so far of Bradman the batting legend, it is<br />
only right that I should give equal weight to Bradman the<br />
captain, and representative of his country. He was a<br />
dedicated and, of course, outstandingly successful leader,<br />
whose performances placed Australia at the pinnacle of world<br />
cricket. His deipeanour, and that of the teams which played<br />
under him, was unfailingly sportsmanlike and professional<br />
I use the word advisedly because it is worth remembering<br />
that remuneration for the players of that time consisted<br />
only of limited out of pocket expenses. 0 0I1 </p>
<p>in an era when communications were much less developed than<br />
they have become since, and in which the old British Empire<br />
played a bigger part in Australia's external interests than<br />
it now does, the international image of Australia was very<br />
much that of Bradman. He unfailingly did his country proud,<br />
as a player and a man. Later, as an administrator, he<br />
performed outstanding services for Australian and<br />
international cricket.<br />
Which brings me to the superb Bradman Albums, whose<br />
publication we are celebrating today. The highs and the<br />
very few lows of Don's career are well-known to many of<br />
us. But those facts are Vividly brought to life by this<br />
priceless collection of personal memorabilia cuttings,<br />
letters, diary extracts, ' jhotographs. These two volumes can<br />
only add lustre to the brilliant Bradman legend.<br />
Among the very first entries is a newspaper account of one<br />
of my favourite Bradman stories. In his autobiography,<br />
my Cricketing Life, Don refers to the fact that he first<br />
began to keep a scrap-book of newspaper cuttings when he<br />
started to play for Bowral as a seventeen year old.<br />
He writes: " The next cuttings relate the extraordinary tale of a<br />
match between Bowral and moss Vale. The match lasted<br />
six Saturdays. Our captain was my uncle, George<br />
Whatman, and when he won the toss he sent me in first<br />
wicket. At ' stumps', as we call close of play in<br />
Australia, ( Don must have put that in for<br />
Godfrey Evans' benefit) I was 80, not out.<br />
Next Saturday came and I went on batting. At the finish<br />
that day the Bowral score was 475 for one wicket. I was<br />
279, still in, and Uncle George was about a hundred. To<br />
cut a long story short, I was caught when I was exactly<br />
300; my uncle made 220, and we won by an innings."<br />
And there, on page 13 of the Albums, is the scoreboard of<br />
Bowral's epic innings of 9 for 672 declared, which includes<br />
as its highlights:<br />
Don Bradman C. Prigg by Ryder 300<br />
G. Whatman b. S. Tickner 227<br />
Th'e only relief for the Moss Vale bowlers comes with<br />
V. Bradman b. Aynsley 1<br />
and, " Dick Whatman did not bat owing to a broken toe."<br />
Among other 300' s recordeo1 in these pages are those he<br />
scored in successive Test series in England in 1930 and<br />
1934. It is no wonder that a copy of a poster of the London<br />
' Star' of 20 August 1930 reproduced here, reads simply, and<br />
with an enormous sense of relief, " He's Out" ( the Don had<br />
just scored 232 in the Fifth Test). 0 0 1 i </p>
<p>At the other end of the scale are the few but famous ducksbowled<br />
first ball in the Melbourne bodyline test by<br />
Bill Bowes, who sadly died the other day ( Don got 103 not<br />
out in the second innings); bowled second ball by Eric<br />
Hollies in his final innings at the Oval in 1948, a delivery<br />
which ensured immortality for Hollies and at the same time<br />
averted the divine wrath that would have undoubtedly<br />
accompanied a Test average of 100.<br />
As one who has always been alive to the parallels of cricket<br />
and politics, I was fascinated by the press cuttings from<br />
the period December 1936 January 1937 alleging divisions<br />
in the Australian team and lack of loyalty to Bradman as<br />
captain. We all know where that sort of thing can lead.<br />
In this case, history records that Don spiritedly denied the<br />
allegations, stuck resolutely by his players and led<br />
Australia from a desperate position 2-nil down to a<br />
brilliant 3-2 victory. That is the stuff heroes are made<br />
of. And there is no more heroic story than that of the Leeds<br />
Test in 1948, when Australia was set 400 to win in under six<br />
hours on the last day on a worn pitch and got them with<br />
seven wickets and fifteen minutes to spare, thanks to a<br />
stand of 300 between Arthur Morris and Don. How many teams<br />
already 2-nil up and determined to go through a tour4-<br />
unbeaten would have gone for the runs, let alone have got,<br />
them at 70 an hour?,<br />
It is no wonder that, in the " Bradman Album", Don describes<br />
that tour as the pinnacle of his cricketing life and<br />
comments that Australia's victory at Leeds and his own part<br />
in it surpass all other moments of sporting satisfaction.<br />
And may I also say what a thrill it is to see so many great<br />
cricketers frcom 1948 here tonight and to take this<br />
opportunity to offer a personal salute to them.<br />
Kevin Weldon and the team at Rigby Publishers deserve our<br />
heartiest congratulations on realising this splendid<br />
project. And it is particularly pleasing that the proceeds<br />
from tonight's occasion will go to the Crippled Children's<br />
Society. I would like to end my remarks by referring once more to the<br />
character of Bradman the man and Bradman the cricketer the<br />
man they want to build statues of in India, the man whose<br />
interviews with Norman May.-are eagerly awaited 40 years<br />
after he finished playing, the man who so generously and<br />
graciously led Australia's cricketing fraternity in a<br />
tribute to Les Favell earlier this year. </p>
<p>And I can do no better than use Don's own words from the<br />
Introduction to the Bradman Albums:<br />
" In retrospect, and surveying the broad canvas, I<br />
suppose more than anything else I look back and say I am<br />
grateful that as the son of simple country parents, and<br />
without the benefit of wealth, power or influence, but<br />
with only the talents bestowed upon me by nature, I was<br />
able to occupy the highest posts the Australian cricket<br />
world had to offer. As a result I was given the<br />
opportunity for much of that period to impart my<br />
interpretation of the character of this wonderful game<br />
which has meant so much to cricket lovers everywhere.<br />
In so doing, I am happy in the knowledge that I did not<br />
betray the responsibility., entrusted to me and I was<br />
enabled, I hope, to enhance the best traditions of the<br />
sport."<br />
Don, and I am sure I speak for all of us here when I say<br />
this, you most certainly did. 001 i 5 3, </p>
