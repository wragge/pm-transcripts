Prime Minister Julia Gillard today paid tribute to Australian rugby league legend Artie Beetson.</p>
<p>Mr Beetson broke new ground as the first Indigenous Australian to captain a national side in any sport.</p>
<p>His brilliance on the field remains seared into the memory of rugby league fans, and his lengthy contribution to Queensland and Australia as a player and coach were honoured with an Order of Australia in 1987.</p>
<p>Mr Beetson will be remembered as one of Australia's greatest ever players in an iconic period for his sport.</p>
<p>He was also a tireless worker for Indigenous Australians as a member of the Former Origin Greats, inspiring young Australians to finish school and move into jobs.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister extended her deep sympathies to Mr Beetson's family, friends, and the Australian rugby league community. </p>
