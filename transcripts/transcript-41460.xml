    <content><![CDATA[<p>I welcome this morning’s announcement from Clarence House confirming the visit of Their Royal Highnesses The Prince of Wales and The Duchess of Cornwall to Australia from 4 April.</p>
<p>The tour is an opportunity for Their Royal Highnesses to share in an important moment for our nation, the opening of the Commonwealth Games on the Gold Coast.</p>
<p>The Prince of Wales and The Duchess of Cornwall will visit Brisbane, before travelling to the Gold Coast where His Royal Highness will represent Her Majesty The Queen at the Games.</p>
<p>The Prince of Wales will continue to other parts of Queensland and then on to the Northern Territory, concluding the tour on 10 April.</p>
<p>This will be the 16th time The Prince of Wales has honoured us with a visit, and the third time for The Duchess of Cornwall.</p>
<p>It will be a privilege and a pleasure to once again showcase our nation’s diverse urban and regional communities, and I am sure Their Royal Highnesses will receive a very warm welcome from the Australian people.</p>
<p>Lucy and I look forward to welcoming Their Royal Highnesses back to Australia in April.</p>
