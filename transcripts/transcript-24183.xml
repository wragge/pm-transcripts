    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Liberal Party has dealt with the spill motion and now this matter is behind us.</p>
<p>We are absolutely determined to work for you, the people, who elected us.</p>
<p>We want to end the disunity and the uncertainty which destroyed two Labor governments, and give you the good government that you deserve.</p>
<p>We think that when you elect a government, when you elect a prime minister, you deserve to keep that government and that prime minister until you have a chance to change your mind.</p>
<p>So, the focus now is once more on jobs, families, a stronger economy and a secure nation.</p>
<p>We do face many challenges.</p>
<p>At heart, we are a highly successful country, justifiably proud of what we've achieved.</p>
<p>In essence, we are a strong economy with so much creativity and dynamism, and the challenge for government is to work with you, not against you.</p>
<p>I love this country, and I will do my best to help our country to succeed.</p>
