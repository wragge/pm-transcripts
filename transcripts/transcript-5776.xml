PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA SATURDAY, 20 MIARCH 1982<br />
AFGHANISTAN DAY<br />
Australia will commemorate Sunday, 21 March as. Afghanistan Day,<br />
to recognise the continuing plight of the people of Afghanistan.<br />
In doing so, Australia will be joining a number of countries,<br />
including members of the Islamic Conference, European Parliament<br />
and the European Community.<br />
It is now more than two years since tile Soviet Union invaded<br />
Afghanistan, overthrew the government, and took military control<br />
of the country. It installed Babrak Karmal as head of a new<br />
illegal regime, which has not secured wide international<br />
recognition. Australia has not recognised and will not recognise<br />
or support that regime. Soviet armed forces, now numbering<br />
around 90,000-95,000, still occupy Afghanistan.. They show no<br />
signs of withdrawing. They continue to carry out harsh<br />
repressive action against the Afghanistan people, including<br />
bombing of cities and villages, destruction of crops and<br />
livestock, and the detention of thousands of citizens. These<br />
Soviet military actions have precipitated one of the largest<br />
single refugee problems in the world. Around three and a half<br />
million Afghans have been driven into refuge in Pakistan and<br />
in Iran. The agony of Afghanistan must not be forgotten.<br />
By its invasion and continued military presence In Af ghanis tan,<br />
the USSR has violated the nost elementary laws of international<br />
behaviour. It has deprived Afghanistan of its sovereign, indep endent and<br />
non-aligned status. It has flouted the United Nations charter<br />
and all the international conventions which prohibit the use of<br />
force except in self-defence, and prohibit foreign intervention<br />
in another country's affairs. The Soviet Union has consistently<br />
ignored repeated calls by the intLernational community for<br />
withdrawal of foreign forces from Afghanistan. Above all, the<br />
USSR's continued intervention in Afghanistan projects political<br />
uncertainty and instability into the sub-continent and beyond.<br />
Because of the Soviet Union's disregard for the accepted norms<br />
of international behaviour, Australia has made it clear that our<br />
own relations with Soviet Union cannot be divorced f'rom-,<br />
Soviet activities in Afghlanistan. This is why Australia has cut<br />
back co-operation and exchanges with the USSR. / 2 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
There can be no end to the fighting and suffering, and no<br />
political solution, until the Soviet troops leave Afghanistan.<br />
A political settlement needs to be found on the following basis:<br />
withdrawal of foreign troops;<br />
full respect for the independence, sovereignty and<br />
non-aligned status of Afghanistan, and<br />
strict observance of the principles of non-intervention<br />
and non-interference.<br />
A background paper on Afghanistan, prepared by the Department<br />
of Foreign Affairs is attached. o0o---</p>
<p>AFGHANISTAN<br />
Background Over two years ago, on 27 December 1979, the<br />
Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan, overthrew the communist<br />
government of Hafizullah Amin and took military control of<br />
the country. It installed Babrak Karmal as head of a new<br />
and illegal regime, which has not secured wide international<br />
recognition. Soviet armed forces, now<br />
numbering around 90-95,000, still occupy Afghanistan.<br />
They show no signs of withdrawing. They continue to<br />
attack the Afghan people, bombing cities and villages,<br />
destroying crops and livestock, and keeping thousands<br />
of citizens prisoner. These Soviet military actions<br />
have precipitated one of the largest single refugee<br />
problems in the world. Around three and a half million<br />
Afghans have been forced to seek refuge in Pakistan and<br />
in Iran. Within Afghanistan the Mujahideen continue to be<br />
militarily active throughout the country, with growing<br />
evidence of unity between the various groups. The<br />
intensification of the Parcham-Khalq rivalry w. ithin the<br />
Afghan Communist Party has continued, although Moscow<br />
remains committed to Babrak Karmal and therefore to the<br />
Parcham faction. Karmal recently appointed a new<br />
Parchamite Prime Minister, Sultan Ali Keshtmand. The<br />
Babrak Karmal regime has not won popular support, its<br />
administration does not extend beyond the major cities<br />
and towns, and it is totally dependent on Soviet military<br />
support. There is no end in sight to the continuing<br />
resistance by Mujahideen groups to the Soviet military<br />
presence. </p>
<p>Military situation Fighting continues in all provinces within<br />
Afghanistan; tension and conflict continue to increase in<br />
the towns especially in Herat and Kandahar; and the Afghan<br />
Army now reduced by purges, casualties and defections to a<br />
force of about 25-30,000, no longer plays a primary role.<br />
Soviet forces, which now total around 90-95,000, with a<br />
further 26,000 across the border in the USSR bear the<br />
brunt of much of the serious fighting against insurgent<br />
groups, but have not been. able to inflict crippling losses<br />
on them. Although the total forces have only marginally<br />
increased, there have been qualitative changes in the type<br />
of Soviet forces deployed in Afghanistan and the military<br />
equipment which they have brought with them.<br />
Despite superior Soviet fire power and complete<br />
control of the skies, the insurgent groups, who number at<br />
any one time from 30,000 to 50,000 fighting men in groups<br />
of anything from 24 to 2-3,000, continue to fight well.<br />
The insurgents are now better equipped, partly because of<br />
weapons given to them by defecting Afghan troops, partly<br />
because of weapons they have captured and weaponry being<br />
supplied by outside sources.<br />
Political infighting, between the ruling Parcham<br />
faction of the People's Democratic Party and the former<br />
dominant Khalq faction, has also meant that military units<br />
supporting the Khalqis are less inclined to fight. As a<br />
result the Soviet Union has systematically withdrawn much<br />
of the mcdern equipment which it had supplied to the<br />
Afghanistan Army, especially anti-aircraft weapons, so<br />
that defecting Afghan units cannot give them to the<br />
insurgents. ThoseAfghan units still considered to be<br />
loyal and still involved in fighting suffer from poor<br />
morale and lack of food and other supplies, especially<br />
petroleum products, and they are resentful of their Soviet<br />
commanders. Recent reports indicate a lessening of Soviet </p>
<p>attempts to increase control of territory and suggest that<br />
the Soviet forces are limiting their role to consolidating<br />
their hold on the major towns, communication centres and<br />
important airfields. In particular Soviet/ Afghan forces<br />
have had to fight hard to hold control over the cities of<br />
Kandahar and Herat.<br />
The Karma regime, conscious that the army has<br />
been reduced from a total of 100,000 to around 25-30,000<br />
men has made continuous efforts to conscript more men into<br />
the army often by force. These efforts have largely<br />
failed or been matched by desertions and have had the<br />
counter-effect of swelling the numbers of the Mujahideen.<br />
Effect on Pakistan<br />
Pakistan feels itself under pressure from the<br />
Soviet troops on its border with Afghanistan, and from the<br />
approximately 2.5million Afghan refugees in Pakistan.<br />
The Pakistan Government is concerned at the possibility of<br />
Soviet troops entering its territory in " hot pursuit" of<br />
the Mujahideen: already there have been incidents of<br />
helicopter gunships and aircraft entering Pakistan and<br />
firing on ground targets. The USSR has commented that a<br />
state of " undeclared war" exists between Afghanistan and<br />
Pakistan. Pakistan has reached agreement with the United<br />
States on a JUS3 billion military and economic package<br />
spread over five years. Approximately half of the total<br />
w ill be used to acquire new armaments and the United<br />
States hopes thereby to strengthen Pakistan's resistance<br />
to Soviet pressures. Pakistan continues to obtain<br />
financial and other support from its West Asian<br />
neighbours, especially Saudi Arabia. </p>
<p>International Developments and Response<br />
By its invasion of Afghanistan the international<br />
image of the Soviet Union has been badly damaged,<br />
especially in its relations with the non-aligned<br />
countries, in particular the Islamic countries. Almost<br />
all major international bodies and associations have<br />
called for the withdrawal of foreign forces and for steps<br />
to be implemented that would allow Afghanistan to<br />
determine its own future free from outside interference<br />
and to allow it to regain its non-aligned status.<br />
The most important forum in which the Soviet<br />
Union has come under pressure is the United Nations.<br />
Following the veto by the Soviet Union on 7<br />
January 1980 of a Resolution in the UN Security Council,<br />
the question of Afghanistan was transferred to an<br />
emergency session of the 34th General Assembly, which, on<br />
14 January 1980, adopted by 104 votes to 18, with 18<br />
abstentions, a Resolution calling for " the immediate,<br />
unconditional and total withdrawal of the foreign troops<br />
from Afghanistan in order to enable its people to<br />
determine their own form of government and choose their<br />
economic, political and social systems free from outside<br />
intervention, subversion, coercion or constraint of any<br />
kind whatsoever". The Resolution, sponsored by 17<br />
non-aligned States, called on the Security Council to<br />
consider ways and means which could assist in its<br />
implementation. On 19 February 1980 the Australian House-of<br />
Representatives condemned the invasion of Afghanistan by<br />
the Soviet Union inter alia as a gross violation of the UN<br />
charter; referred to the January 1980 UN General Assembly<br />
Resolution; and called for an immediate unconditional and<br />
total withdrawal of Soviet troops. </p>
<p>At the 35th session of the General Assembly,<br />
which began on 16 September 1980, an item was inscribed<br />
concerning " The Situation in Afghanistan and its<br />
Implications for International Peace and Security". The<br />
Soviet Union's lack of response to the earlier call for<br />
withdrawal was sharply criticised, and a new Resolution,<br />
drafted principally by the Islamic Conference countries,<br />
repeated the demand.<br />
The main elements of the Resolution were<br />
described by the Foreign Minister of Pakistan during the<br />
debate on Afghanistan in the General Assembly on 17<br />
November 1980: " first, the preservation of the<br />
sovereignty, territorial integrity, political independence<br />
and non-aligned character of Afghanistan; secondly, the<br />
right of the Afghan people to determine their form of<br />
government and to choose their economic, political and<br />
social system free from outside intervention, subversion,<br />
coercion or constraint of any kind whatsoever; thirdly,<br />
the immediate withdrawal of the foreign troops from<br />
Afghanistan; and fourthly, the creation of the-necessary<br />
conditions which would enable the Afghan refugees to<br />
return voluntarily to their homes in safety and honour".<br />
The crux of a political solution, he said, was the<br />
immediate withdrawal of foreign troops from Afghan<br />
territory: " Obviously, what is implied is nothing other<br />
than a total withdrawal of Soviet troops". The Pakistan<br />
Foreign Minister also warned:<br />
" No less ominous for the world order is the<br />
contention that military intervention is<br />
justified in the exercise of the right of<br />
individual and collective defence against an<br />
imaginary threat. Nor can the invasion of a<br />
small non-aligned country like Afghanistan be<br />
rationalised on the basis . of geo-strategic<br />
considerations or doctrines. Furthermore, it<br />
must be acknowledged that despite the injection </p>
<p>of a formidable military force the resistance of<br />
the Afghan people has not only continued but<br />
acquired new dimensions."<br />
These views were echoed by a very large majority<br />
of UN member States who, on 20 November 1980 voted in<br />
support of the Resolution by 111 votes to 22, with 12<br />
abstentions. On 18 November 1981, the UN General Assembly<br />
adopted a Resolution reaffirming the Afghan people's right<br />
to choose their own form of government free from outside<br />
intervention or constraint and again calling for the<br />
immediate withdrawal of foreign troops. This Resolution,<br />
No. 36/ 34, was approved by 116 votes to 23, with 12<br />
abstentions. This compares with the vote of 104 in favour<br />
of a similar but shorter Resolution in January 1980 ( at<br />
the Assembly's Emergency Session following the Soviet<br />
invasion of Afghanistan in December 1979) and the 111 in<br />
favour of the Resolution at least year's 35th General<br />
Assembly. The Soviet Union's refusal to heed the<br />
Assembly's recommendations, its maintenance of some 85,000<br />
troops in Afghanistan during 1981, the continuing popular<br />
resistance to the Soviet-imposed Babrak Karmal regime and<br />
international concern about the continuing refugee problem<br />
contributed to this sustained support for the General<br />
Assembly resolution in 1981. The Soviet Permanent<br />
Representative to the UN tried to dissuade the Assembly<br />
from inscribing an agenda item on the " so-called" question<br />
of the situation in Afghanistan, but he was defeated, and<br />
the subject was raised by many speakers in the general<br />
debate as well as in discussion of the Resolution itself<br />
in mid-November. After recognising the importance of initiatives<br />
by the Islamic and non-aligned countries in finding a<br />
political solution for Afghanistan, the 1981 Resolution: </p>
<p>" Reiterates that the preservation of the<br />
sovereignty, territorial integrity,<br />
political independence and non-aligned<br />
character of Afghanistan is essential for a<br />
peaceful solution of the problem;<br />
reaffirms the right of the Afghan people to<br />
determine their own form of government and<br />
to choose their economic, political and<br />
social system free from outside<br />
intervention, subversion, coercion or<br />
constraint of any kind whatsoever;<br />
calls for the immediate ' withdrawal of the<br />
foreign troops from Afghanistan;<br />
calls upon all parties concerned to work for<br />
the urgent achievement, of a political<br />
solution, in accordance with the provisions<br />
of the previous Resolution, and the creation<br />
of necessary conditions which could enable<br />
the Afghan refugees to return voluntarily to<br />
their homes in safety and honour;<br />
renews its appeal to all States and national<br />
and international organisations to continue<br />
to extend humanitarian relief assistance,<br />
with a view to alleviating the hardship of<br />
the Afghan refugees, in co-ordination with<br />
the United Nations High Commission for<br />
Refugees."<br />
It also asks the UN Secretary-General to continue his<br />
efforts to solve the problem of Afghanistan and promote a<br />
political solution there, and to keep the UN member States<br />
informed of progress. </p>
<p>8.<br />
Australia has given full support to all three<br />
Resolutions and has welcomed the efforts of the UN<br />
Secretary-General to find a solution. Australia endorses<br />
the appcintment by Secretary-General de Cuellar of his<br />
personal representative on Afghanistan, Mr D. Cordovez of<br />
Equador. ( Mr de Cuellar himself occupied the position of<br />
personal representative on Afghanistan to the former<br />
Secretary-General of the UN, Mr Waldheim, from February<br />
1980). Australia supports the efforts of the UN<br />
Secretary-General's personal representative to negotiate a<br />
political solution to the Afghanistan problem.<br />
The Sbviet Union has also been criticised by such<br />
organisations as the UN Human Rights Commission, the<br />
Islamic Conference ( on three occasions, the most important<br />
being on ? 1 May 1980), the Foreign Ministers of the<br />
European Community, the Foreign Ministers of the ASEAN<br />
countries, at CHOGRM II in New Delhi in 1981 and at the<br />
Melbourne CHOGM in October 1981, by the<br />
Inter-Pzrliamentary Union, and by the February 1981 NAM<br />
Foreign Ministers Meeting in New Delhi.<br />
Despite the overwhelming condemnation of the<br />
Soviet Union by the international community there appears<br />
to be little shift in the attitude of either of the Soviet<br />
Union or the Afghan regime. This was made clear when a<br />
proposal put forward by the UK Foreign Minister,<br />
Lord Carrington with the support of the EC countries on<br />
June 1981 was rejected by the Soviet Union as<br />
unrealistic and unacceptable. The UK/ EC proposal is for a<br />
two stage conference: Stage one would seek international<br />
arrangements to create conditions in which<br />
Afghanistan's independence and non-alignment </p>
<p>9.<br />
can be assured. It would be attended by the<br />
permanent members of the Security Council,<br />
Pakistan, India, Iran and the Secretaries<br />
General of the UN and the Islamic Conference<br />
or their representatives.<br />
Stage two would include representatives of<br />
the Afghan people. It would try to reach<br />
agreement on the international arrangements<br />
proposed at the first stage.<br />
Subsequently on 24 August 1981, the Karmal regime<br />
released its latest proposal regarding a political<br />
solution. The new proposal no longer insisted , upon<br />
separate bilateral talks with Pakistan and Iran and would<br />
enable tripartite talks to take place. In addition the<br />
Karmal government no longer objects to the UN<br />
Secretary-General or his representative taking part in<br />
either bilateral or tripartite talks. These concessions<br />
appear to be designed to soften international criticism of<br />
the Soviet Union and Afghanistan at the UN and-to increase<br />
pressure on Pakistan to begin negotiations. The proposals<br />
were released shortly after the second visit by the then<br />
UN Secretary-General's personal representative Perez de<br />
Cuellar, to Kabul and Islamabad. Reaction by key<br />
countries such as Pakistan, the United States etc. has not<br />
been favourable, as the proposal carries with it the<br />
implication that the Babrak government would gain some<br />
degree of legitimacy under the cover of negotiations. The<br />
proposal also does not address itself to the main issues<br />
namely the withdrawal of Soviet forces before negotiations<br />
can begin. It also continues to lay the blame on " foreign<br />
interference" from Pakistan and Iran. </p>
<p>Subsequently both Pakistan and Afghanistan<br />
presented views to each other through the office of the<br />
Secretary-General in New York, but the exchange did not<br />
get far. It is not clear whether these " proximity talks"<br />
will resume. Iran is now pursuing its own proposal, which<br />
calls for Soviet forces to be replaced by an Islamic force<br />
( including Iranian and Pakistani elements) and the<br />
creation of a National Assembly to agree on a political<br />
basis for the future of the country. The National<br />
Assembly would include representatives from the<br />
Mujahideen. It is not clear how Iran would negotiate its<br />
proposal with the Soviet Union and Afghanistan,, in view of<br />
its present position of not discussing its views with<br />
either of them.<br />
At the Melbourne CHOGM in Oc, tober 1981, the<br />
coipmunique item on Afghanistan reflected the earlier<br />
strong language of UN and NAM meetings. It said:<br />
Heads of Government expressed grave concern<br />
at the situation in and around Afghanistan<br />
and its implications both for the region's<br />
peace and stability and for international<br />
security. Although there were differing<br />
perceptions about the developments leading<br />
to the present situation, Heads of<br />
Government were united in calling urgently<br />
for a political settlement on the basisof<br />
the withdrawal zf foreign troops and full<br />
respect for the independence, sovereignty,<br />
and non-aligned status of Afghanistan and<br />
strict observance of the principles of<br />
non-intervention and non-interference. They<br />
affirmed the right of Afghan refugees to </p>
<p>11,<br />
return to their homes in safety and honour.<br />
They urged all concerned to work towards a<br />
negotiated settlement which would leave the<br />
Afghan people free to determine their own<br />
future.<br />
Refugees The situation in Afghanistan has generated a<br />
significant outflow of refugees primarily to Pakistan and<br />
Iran. There are an estimated 2.5 million refugees in<br />
Pakistan and about 1 million in Iran.<br />
International organisations including the United<br />
Nations High Commissioner for Refugees ( UNHCR), the World<br />
Food Progr: mme ( WFP), and the International Committee of<br />
the Red Cross ( ICRC), have been active in meeting the<br />
basic needs of the refugees.<br />
Australia is keenly aware of the special<br />
difficulties which Pakistan is facing as a result of the<br />
inflow of refugees into its territory. To ease the burden<br />
of coping with these difficulties Australia has provided<br />
assistance totalling approximately IA12 million to date in<br />
the form of direct relief aid to the refugees. In 1981/ 82<br />
Australia is supplying 25,000 tonnes of wheat, 300 tonnes<br />
of high protein biscuits, and 40 tonnes of sugar through<br />
the UNHCR and the WFP.<br />
In addition, Australia provides economic<br />
assistance to Pakistan in the form of food aid, project<br />
assistance, and technical cooperation and training. The<br />
total value of such assistance in 1980/ 81 and 1981/ 82 is<br />
approximately $ A11.5 million. </p>
<p>12.<br />
Post-Afghanistan Measures Against the Soviet Union<br />
In its condemnation of the Soviet invasion. of<br />
Afghanistan the Government imposed a series of measures<br />
designed to curtail Australia's bilateral relations with<br />
the Soviet Union. These measures include:-<br />
MEASURES I<br />
a) Suspension of bilateral scientific exchange<br />
b) Soviet research vessels refused permission<br />
to operate in Australian waters<br />

e) Suspension of regular officials talks at<br />
Foreign Ministry level<br />
f) Suspension of fisheries co-operation<br />
g) Suspension of Soviet proposals in aviation,<br />
including the denial to Aeroflot of access<br />
to Australia<br />
h) Suspension of meetings of the bilateral<br />
Mixed Commission on Trade and Economic<br />
Co-operation<br />
i) Suspension of official visits between<br />
Australia and the Soviet Union by Ministers<br />

exporters to the Soviet Union 14 April 1980<br />
p) Banning Soviet cruise ships from using<br />
Australian ports 31 May 1980<br />
By its continuing occupation of Afghanistan, its<br />
disregard of the views of many countries, and its refusal<br />
to negotiate for a just solution, the Soviet Union has not<br />
given the international community any cause to discontinue<br />
its strong condemnation of what has occurred in<br />
Afghanistan. -If anything events in Poland have served<br />
only to reinforce the need to maintain its present<br />
approach to the USSR. In these circumstances the<br />
Government is not prepared to conduct normal bilateral<br />
relations with the Soviet Union and has made its position<br />
clear to the Soviet authorities. When in April 1981, the<br />
United States decided to lift its partial grains embargo<br />
for domestic political reasons this effectively removed<br />
the basis for Australian participation in the partial<br />
embargo. This decision on grain sales in no way<br />
represented any retreat from the Government's strong<br />
condemnation of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. Al<br />
the other measures remain firmly in place.<br />
The Australian Government has implemented its<br />
sanctions in consultation with other western governments.<br />
There has been no change in the perception by western<br />
governments of Soviet intervention in Afghan. Although<br />
international condemnation and retaliatory measures have<br />
not so far caused the Soviet Union to change its policies<br />
towards Afghanistan, the Soviet Union has clearly suffered<br />
in terms of loss of esteem in the eyes of third-world<br />
countries ( especially Islamic and Non-Aligned states), and<br />
the more hardened posture by western groups on such<br />
strategic issues as NATO defence preparedness, with<br />
o </p>
<p>14.<br />
corresponding constraints on its activity e. g. with<br />
respect to Poland. The international community has<br />
therefore sound reasons for persisting with its opposition<br />
to the Soviet presence in Afghanistan in the hope that<br />
Soviet withdrawal will eventually be procured. </p>
