PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR PRESS 18 JUNE 1976<br />
DEATH OF LORD CASEY<br />
IT WAS WITH DEEP AND PERSONAL REGRET THAT I<br />
LEARNT TODAY OF THE DEATH OF LORD CASEY IN MELBOURNE. HE<br />
WAS ONE OF AUSTRALIA'S GREAT STATESMEN. HE NOT ONLY SERV ED<br />
HIS COUNTRY ABLY IN MANY CAPACITIES, BUT ALSO THE BRITISH<br />
COMMONWEALTH WITH EQUAL DISTINCTION. HE WAS HELD IN HIGH<br />
REGARD AND RESPECT AROUND THE WORLD.<br />
HE BROUGHT TO THE HIGH OFFICES THAT HE HELD,<br />
A SENSE OF PURPOSE ANDi DEDICATION, IDEALISM, AND INTEGRITY.<br />
HE BROUGHT A QUIET SENSE OF DIGNITY TO THE ' AUSTRALIAN.<br />
POLITICAL ARENA. BOTH AUSTRALIA AND THE COMMONWEALTH ARE<br />
THE POORER BY HIS DEPARTURE FROM PUBLIC'OFFICE.<br />
R. G. CASEY, BEFORE THE SECOND WORLD WAR, BEGAN<br />
AUSTRALIA'S DIPLOMATIC REPRESENTATION ABROAD. LATER, IT<br />
WAS VERY MUCH HIS OWN PERSONAL INITIATIVE THAT LED TO OUR<br />
CLOSE AND WARM LINKS WITH MANY OF THE COUNTRIES OF SOUTH<br />
EAST ASIA. THE INITIATIVES OF LORD CASEY IN THESE DIRECTIONS<br />
HAVE NOT BEEN FULLY OR ADEQUATELY RECOGNISED. HE WAS A<br />
MODEST MAN, AND IT WAS LEFT TO OTHERS TO POINT TO HIS<br />
ACHIEVEMENTS, AND TO THE GROUND WORK THAT HE, AS MINISTER<br />
FOR EXTERNAL AFFAIRS, SO ABLY LAID. </p>
