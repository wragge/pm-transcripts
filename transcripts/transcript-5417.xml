FOR MEDIA SATURDAY AUGUST 16 1980<br />
ADDRESS TO TASM4ANIAN STATE COUNCIL OF THE<br />
LIBERAL PARTY, DEVONPORT<br />
I welcome the chance to be with you again on this. important<br />
occasion and in this important year. I sense that the spirit<br />
at work here today is one of genuine pride Tasmanian pride<br />
in the-productive partnership that has developed between the<br />
Commonwealth Government and Tasmanians, and pride as Liberals<br />
in what L1iiberalism has achieved for all Australians in the<br />
last five years. And isn't that pride justi. ed?<br />
Five years ago Tasmanians expressed, along with most Australians,<br />
their faith in Liberalism. Now, in Tasmania, as in the rest<br />
of Australia, we are sharing in the successes of that faith.<br />
When have we ever seen such Federal Government support for<br />
Tasmania? When has there been such concern for Tasmanian<br />
initiatives and Tasmania's potential? Has any government<br />
ever done as much?<br />
I am not talking about an election time concern. I am talking<br />
about a continuing, all the year round, commitment. I am<br />
talking about a commitment which is confirmed by the record.<br />
Let us look at the results. one of our first objectives in<br />
government was to increase the freedom of tie States to mazke<br />
their own decisions; to give them the ability to set thieir<br />
own priorities. For Tasmania, the result has been a 92%<br />
increase, since 1975/ 76, in the provision of untied general<br />
revenue funds. Or in real terms, an increase of over<br />
Strong as our commitment is to the States, we have a stronger<br />
commitment to the speci al needs of the smaller States.<br />
Total per capita payments to Tasmania this financial year<br />
will be over $ 1100 compared with $ 662 for Victoria and $ 670<br />
for New South Wales. Our justification for this is straighitforward.<br />
Australia is more than our densely populated capital cities.<br />
Australia is more than mainland Australia. The security,<br />
and the well-being of Australians depends on balanced<br />
development, for all Australia, of all its potential, of<br />
all its capacity. Isn't that the commitment that I made<br />
for the Liberal Party in the Bass by-election? it is<br />
because of this commitment that I agreed with Mr. Lowe<br />
to the importation of a floating dock yesterday. </p>
<p>-2<br />
It is our belief, as a government, that Tasmania should continUE<br />
to receive from the Commonwealth the support that is necessary<br />
to enable it to participate to the full in Australia's programme<br />
of national. development. That is what led us, soon after we<br />
came to office, to commission Sir Bede Callaghan to enquire<br />
into the structure of industry and employment in Tasmania.<br />
Aplan of action was presented to the Govern.-ment in 1977<br />
and we have acted comprehensively upon it. Our actions<br />
have resulted in financial assistance of over $ 3 million<br />
in special support, grants and loan funds for industrial<br />
development in areas which have a special identification<br />
with Tasmania. Included in this was almost $ 1 million for<br />
six projects under the Commonwealth Regional Development<br />
Programme. You will remember that through this programme,<br />
we offered special support to upgrade the convention facilities<br />
for the Launceston Albert Hall; provided one loan of over<br />
$ 300, 000 for a holdiay village at Stewart's Bay; and another<br />
of over million to M. T. N. Industries at Launceston.<br />
No one-would deny the justification of support for these<br />
projects. But do you know what the Labor Party in Canberra<br />
tried to do? Because the programme was administered a<br />
Tasmanian, Kevin Newman, the Labor Party implied that<br />
the 1oa~ ns should not have gone to Tasmania. What absurdity<br />
is that?<br />
I doubt if Tasmanians will forget Labor's indifference to<br />
small States. This indifference is a matter of public record.<br />
We have a constitution specifically designed to protect the<br />
small States; to give equal representation to the small States<br />
intheSenar-e; to provide that referenda can only be passed by<br />
a majority of people in a majority of States. But what does<br />
the Labor Party want to do? They intend to destroy the powers<br />
of the Senate. They intend to change the constitution to<br />
enable future referenda to be passed by a majority of<br />
the people, not a majority of States. The protection of<br />
the small States would be abandoned. Victoria and<br />
New South Wales alone would be able to alter the constitution.<br />
Where would that place Tasmania then? What voice would<br />
Tasmanians have in the government of Australia?<br />
You can have the vigorous, hard-working Liberal members<br />
that we have now representing Tasmania, but under the<br />
Labor proposal, they could talk and still achieve nothing.<br />
Yet how much have they achieved over the last five years?<br />
Let us not forget that Mr. Batt betrayed this State by<br />
supporting those proposals. And Mr. Hayden supports those<br />
proposals. And Mr. Hawke only recently said that we should<br />
abolish State governments; that, " We must have one government<br />
with unquestioned powers..." At least in wanting more<br />
power, Labor politicians are consistent. How can Doug Lowe<br />
remain a member of that party? My government will have no<br />
part in this. We will havenopart in turning this great<br />
federation of Australian States into a Canberra monopoly. </p>
<p>-3<br />
A recent decision of great importance to Tasmania was the<br />
agreement by the Government, in April, to relocate the<br />
C. S. I. R. O. Fisheries and oceanography Divrision in Hobart.<br />
This will result'in the construction of a $ 25 million marine<br />
science centre incorporating the C. S. I. R. O. marine science<br />
laboratories. It will involve the building of a multi-purpose<br />
research vessel, to be based in Hobart, at a cost of $ 9 million.<br />
Parallel to this, I opened, earlier this year, the Australian<br />
Maritime College at Launceston. By 1984, it will be providing<br />
facilities for approximately nine hundred people to undertake<br />
courses designed to promote excellence in our maritime industry.<br />
These initiatives will go a long way towards establishing<br />
Tasmania as the maritime centre for Australia. They complement<br />
the decisions already taken to transfer the Antarctic Division<br />
of the Department of Science and Environment to Hobart at<br />
a cost of $ 10 million. And only recently the Convention on<br />
the Corfservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources selected<br />
Hobart as the site for its headquarters. This followed strong support<br />
by the Commonwealth Government and represents further proof<br />
of our active commitment to Tasmania's development.<br />
I welcome the co-operation of the Tasmanian Government in<br />
these matters, for theee decisions will convert Tasmania<br />
into a major maritime and Antarctic research centre for the<br />
Southern hemisphere.<br />
We-have done many other things to help this State. Construction<br />
starts on the second Hobart bridge this year and the Commonwealth<br />
will meet all the costs. The freight equalisation scheme continues<br />
and by the end of this year, the Commonwealth will have<br />
committed $ 120 million to the programme. And every dollar<br />
of this will be of direct benefit to Tasmanian industries.<br />
To further confirm our assistance to Tasmania, the Government<br />
recently gave approval to both domestic airlines to operate<br />
the Hobart/ Christchurch link. This service is expected to<br />
commence in early November.<br />
All of this is but a sketch of a long catalogue of initiatives<br />
that we have taken in support of Tasmania. Can anyone<br />
think of a single initiative of the Labor government?<br />
Of course, we can all remember that time when Mr. Whitlam<br />
promised the people of Georgetown a roof over a swimming<br />
pool that did not exist.<br />
Under Liberalism, Tasmania has ceased to be just an<br />
Outpost. Tasmania has gone international. And having been<br />
part of this development, the Government is determined<br />
to continue its initiatives. We do not need to make<br />
Whitlam-like promises which come to nothing. We have<br />
delivered the goods in Tasmania. </p>
<p>.4<br />
The runs are on the board. And the message for Tasmanians<br />
* in the decade ahead is: " Let us make it a not-out Liberal.<br />
innings". Of course, the benefits for Tasmania would have been<br />
impossible withiout the successful fight we have waged<br />
against the Labor economic disorder that we inherited. We<br />
took over a bankrupt company, a company in receivership.<br />
And I1 make no apology for the fact that it has been a long7<br />
hard grind in building the strength of the Australian economy<br />
to its present point.<br />
In 1975, inflation reached 17%, disrupting economic stability,<br />
destroying-confidence and crippling investment and economic<br />
growth. What is particularly pleasing is that in spite of<br />
this, we have been able to achieve so much. Of fundamental<br />
importance, many of our industries are competitive again<br />
in world markets; our relative cost structure is back to<br />
the level of the early 701s; private sector employment is<br />
rising; domestic-business confidence is high; and the<br />
confidence of overseas investors in Australia has fully<br />
recovered.<br />
And of continuing importance to all Australians,. our<br />
farms are doing wel~ l again. Lower inflation has greatly<br />
helped; costs have been contained. Government support and<br />
special incentives have helped to bring life and vitality<br />
to Australian farms once more.<br />
These are key achievements and I cannot stress too strongly<br />
the contrast between our strength now and the depressed<br />
economic environment which was overtaking us five years ago.<br />
It is true that there were expectations which we held in 1.975<br />
and : again in 1977 which may not have been fuly achieved. But we<br />
have had little help from overseas events. Indeed, many<br />
overseas events have made the task more difficult. Who would<br />
have envisaged back in 1977 that, this year, inflation would<br />
rise to over 20% in Britain; to nearly 15% in the United States?<br />
Who would have envisaged so little growth in the world economy?<br />
Who would have envisaged interest rates going to 20% in the<br />
United States? And who would have predicted the extent of<br />
further increases in the price of oil, bringing a new bout<br />
of inflation to the whole of the industrialised world?<br />
None of this has been assisted by the number of strikes that<br />
occur, often for frivolous and unreasonable causes. And none<br />
of it has been helped by the extent of the Arbitration<br />
_____ Commission's decisions. All this has meant that there have<br />
been occasions when we have had to adjust our course and<br />
work -all the harder. But we have never sat back and said<br />
that circumstances were too difficult. All along, includinig<br />
the Budget to be introduced next Tuesday night, the Government<br />
has placed responsibility-first-. Because, if we fail at that,<br />
we fail in our obligation to all Austral. ian people. Because<br />
we have had the courage to take the hard line when it was<br />
needed, under our management, the economy has performed<br />
remarkably well, and much better than many of our overseas<br />
competitors. What we have achieved, we have achieved by<br />
ourselves, on our own account.. In that, all Australians<br />
can take a real measure of pride.<br />
Our inflation rate though higher still than we had hoped<br />
is nevertheless well below the O. E. C. D. average. While in the<br />
last 12 months our inf lation rate has increased by less than<br />
in the U. S. it rose by nearly in Japan by over </p>
<p>and, in the U. K. by over 11%.<br />
This relative strength is the reason why the prospects<br />
just ahead of us are bright indeed. Australia in the<br />
. is a different country; a country with different attitudes;<br />
a different view of itself; and with a well founded optimism<br />
for the future.<br />
The faith and confidence we have in ourselves as Australians,<br />
and in Australia as a nation, have been reborn. And this<br />
faith is shared by Tasmanian investors. Firm and prospective<br />
investment in mining, resources and manufacturing in this region<br />
along include: a $ 27 million project by Aberfoyle and Taringo<br />
Mining and Exploration at Que River.<br />
an $ 18 million expansion programme for Renisons near<br />
a $ 13 million project by E. Z. Industries at<br />
Roseberry a $ 50 million programme of A. P. P. M. to convert their<br />
boilers from oil to coal and wood,<br />
a proposed $ 60 million installation by A. P. P. M.<br />
at Wesley Vale next year,<br />
and in manufacturing, Repco are undertaking a $ 5 million expansion<br />
at Launceston, and<br />
Goliath Cement, not far from here at Railton,<br />
are involved in a $ 22 million conversion and<br />
expansion programme.<br />
The results of the Government's policies are best summed up.<br />
in the 1979 annual report of a very significant Tasmanian<br />
firm A. P. P. M. The report argued clearly that the company's<br />
increased profitability was attributable to the more competitive<br />
cost of its product. It went on, significant part of the<br />
credit for this achievement must be given to Federal Government<br />
industrial policy particularly that which is designed to<br />
assist Tasmania. Subsidies paid under the Tasmanian Freight<br />
Equalisation Assistance Scheme, export incentives, research<br />
and development grants... all helped to contain costs...<br />
to keep our sales prices down.., to increase the volume of<br />
sales but the important effect to enable an<br />
increase in machine utilisation which then provided more<br />
jobs and prosperity."<br />
All of this highlights a record of achievement in Tasmania<br />
in which the Government has worked closely with all Tasmanian<br />
members. what projects could anyone name that were standing<br />
ready to go in 1975 at the end of the Labor years: the cupboard<br />
was indeed bare. M Hayden said a year ago that the<br />
would be a decade of despair. Hie said a couple~ of weeks ago / 6-</p>
<p>-6<br />
that the 80' s would be a dead-end decade. That kind of<br />
pessimism and gloom Irave nio plaice 3kn Australia. They<br />
demonstrate clearly that the Labor Party has no capacity<br />
to offer national leadership; no capacity for national<br />
inspiration.<br />
our achievements in the last five years must be the source<br />
of our inspiration for what we can achieve in the years ahead.<br />
The capacity of Liberalism to harness initiative and<br />
cultivate the creativity of all Australians has been proven,<br />
And because of -this, significant indicators point to accelerating<br />
national recovery. It is on our capacity to secure sustainable<br />
economic growth that we base our claim for goverment in the<br />
801s. For it is only from economic growth that a government<br />
can provide the hospitals, the roads, the schools and the<br />
essential help to those people in the community who, through<br />
no fault of their own, genuinely need our assistance.<br />
It is because of our improved economic health that, as a nation,<br />
we have been able to achieve significant reforms especially<br />
in our assistance to families, to the aged and to the handicapped.<br />
The introduction of the family allowance is a major initiative<br />
redirecting help to mothers, especially those from low<br />
income or pensioner families. It has been a particular<br />
benefit to over 300,000 families with 800,000 children<br />
who had received little or no help under the previous<br />
system. We have also acted to increase help for families<br />
in the taxation area. Since coming to office, we have doubled<br />
the income tax rebate for single income families; while<br />
the sole parent rebate has more than doubled. In the same<br />
time, we have extended the eligibility for the supporting<br />
parent benefit to include supporting fathers. It is the<br />
Government's view that there must be dignity for those who<br />
are old or who suffer from some disadvantage. Nowhere is<br />
our commitment to the aged and the handicapped more in<br />
evidence than in this part of Tasmania. In this financial year in this<br />
area, our commitment to the elderly will result in,<br />
over $ 400,000 for the Melaleuca Homes for the<br />
Aged, here in Devonport,<br />
over $ 400,000 for the Eliza Purdon Home for the<br />
Aged, not far from here,<br />
almost $ 300,000 for the Karingall Home for the<br />
Aged, also here in Devonport,<br />
and, almost $ 50,000 for four self-contained units<br />
at the Port Sorrell Retirement Homes.<br />
It is the Government's belief that handicapped people must<br />
be provided with the opportunities they deserve to develop<br />
their skills, their talents, their self-esteem and their<br />
confidence. In this region alone our commitment to the<br />
handicapped will result in<br />
$ 190,000 for the North West Coast Disabled Citizen<br />
Association for the purchase of a sheltered workshop<br />
in Burnie / 7 </p>
<p>7<br />
and two projects, also in Burnie, conducted by the<br />
Multihandicapped Association of Tasmania which will<br />
attract over $ 300,000 in Commonwealth support next<br />
financial year.<br />
And . that is just in this area.<br />
The same commitment is at work throughout Tasmania and the<br />
whole Australian community. It is part of our belief that<br />
Australia as a nation cannot advance unless all members of<br />
the community have the opportunity to share in the benefits<br />
of our growing wealth. But that wealth must first be<br />
generated so that we can improve on the kind of programmes<br />
I have outlined. And that is why the Government is dedicated<br />
to co-ordinated national development. / 8 </p>
<p>-8-<br />
What Mr. Hayden and Labor still don't understand is that whatever<br />
the Government spends must first be taken from the people.<br />
Governments have no resources of their own. But that does<br />
not worry the Labor Party. Indeed, Mr. Hayden has argued<br />
that one of his answers to the challenge of the 80' s is to<br />
. spend public money. Mr. Hayden described this spending as,<br />
" the biggest social reform you can carry out iii this country.."<br />
This is one reform to which Mr. Hayden is dedicated.<br />
In about five areas alone, Labor are already commi-tted to<br />
$ 2,000 million additional expenditure, if they<br />
ever won government. In fact, almost unbelievably, Labor has<br />
so far pro,', rosed a total of about 300 separate spending<br />
commitments. This week, as Mr. Hayden added to these spending<br />
commitments, he also promised to control the proliferation of<br />
statutory authorities. But what he did not tell Tasmanians<br />
was ' that his party is committed, by its platform to the<br />
establishment of over 50 new statutory authorities, councils<br />
and c6mmittees. Peter Rae won't like that.<br />
Certainly, Mr. Hayden's notion of restraint is different from ours.<br />
Perhaps it was because of this massive expenditure programme that<br />
Mr. Hayden also said a Labor government would " opt for<br />
long-term economic planning, not on a yearly basis, but looking<br />
three to five years ahead".<br />
We know why he wants a budget every five years, and it has got<br />
nothing to so with long-term economic planning. Recently,<br />
one of the Labor Party's most successful administrators,<br />
the former Lord Mayor of Brisbane, Mr. Clem Jones, said,<br />
" It is recognised, that Bill Hayden has admitted he cannot<br />
read a balance sheet".<br />
That is the reason why he wants a five yearly budget. It gives<br />
him five years to learn what the red and black figures mean.<br />
Predictably, Mr. Hayden did not tell us while he was in<br />
Tasmania where the money was coming from. But we should<br />
remember his warning to us that, " I have committed my<br />
organisation to a capital gains tax, a resources rental<br />
tax, a levy on domestic oil producers,' a number of initiatives<br />
in the tax area and other measures of that nature"<br />
What are these " other measures"? One of his colleagues<br />
gives us some insight. Mr. Willis has said that it is<br />
" wrong" that we do not have ' some form of tax on capital,<br />
be it death duties, capital gains tax, wealth tax, or perhaps<br />
some kind of combination of those, or all three".<br />
Someone remarked the other day, that Mr. Hayden would tax<br />
the patience of a saint, just to keep the support of the<br />
Socialist left. Because, indisputably, Mr. Hayden is a<br />
prisoner of the militant Socialist left of the Labor Party.<br />
And all Australians know that on many occasions, inside<br />
Parliament and out of it, supporters of the Socialist left<br />
have sought to explain away the Soviet Union's aggressive<br />
and expansionist behaviour. </p>
<p>9-<br />
At a time of almost universal concern about the deteriorating<br />
international strategic situation, brought about by Russian<br />
expansion, the Labor Party have as a leader a man whose support<br />
depends upon the sections in his party who apologise for<br />
Soviet behaviour.<br />
Mr. Hayden's behaviour and his views, on a wide range of<br />
important issues, are out of step with the best interests<br />
of Australians and. their aspirations in the decade ahead.<br />
it is because of this; it is because of Labor's inability<br />
to inspire confidence or trust that our responsibility to<br />
Australia and its future is even greater. Because the good<br />
government of Australia depends entirely on the strength of<br />
Liberalism. It is that proven strength that has enabled us to enter the<br />
with much to be thankful for. But this is not the time to squander<br />
hard won gains. Instead, it is the time to use our energy and<br />
our initiative to build upon our achievements with all the<br />
strength and vigour at our command.<br />
This is the challenge. * I ask you all to join with me in<br />
dedicating yourselves to meet this challenge. I ask you<br />
all to join with me in making Liberalism the driving force<br />
behind all Australians in the next decade and beyond.,<br />
I ask all of you to help us build the security of thisnation;<br />
to help us build a better future for our children;<br />
to help us respond to the great trust that has been placed<br />
in us by the majority of the people of Australia.<br />
This is the most challenging task of all. But it is also<br />
the most rewarding. I have rno doubt that with the organisation.<br />
and support the Tasmanian division of the Liberal Party, our<br />
goals will be met. And I look forward to you all dedicating<br />
yourselves comprehensively to the challenges in the months<br />
ahead and pDursuing them single-mindedly; with energy, commitment<br />
and success. </p>
