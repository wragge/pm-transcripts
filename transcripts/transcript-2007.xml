PRESS ! NTERVIEW GIVEN BY THE PRIME MINISTER,<br />
MR JOHN GORTON AT BRISBANE AIRPORT 3 MARCH 1969<br />
Q.<br />
PM: VQ PM:<br />
PM:<br />
~ Q. PM: Mr Prime Minister, this morning's bombing of the<br />
Russian Embassy in Canberra. Can you tell us a little bit about<br />
that and what happened?<br />
i can't tell you about that. I left Canberra quite early<br />
and I haven't had anything which T can significantly say about that<br />
at alf. Mr Prime Minister, thejapanese document affair<br />
which is going on at the moment. Do you feel the Austra~ an<br />
Security Service should lose a littie bi t of its autonomy-and have<br />
to answer to the Government?<br />
No. The. Australian Security Service does answer to the<br />
Government. Of course it answers to the Government. But this<br />
appears to me to be an attempt to denigrate the Australian Security<br />
Service by the Left Wing of the Australian Labor Party baase you<br />
will notice that there is a whole series of questions by L-Et Wingers<br />
on the Notice Paper Is there poison gas in the Security Service?<br />
Did they follow somebody who came here from some other couriry..<br />
questions of this kind, all without foundation. Now, they ask these<br />
knowing that the policy of all governments since Chifley's time has<br />
been neither to confirm nor to deny allegations that are made for<br />
obvious reasons. If you say somebody was or wasn't wolking for<br />
Security, they ask about somebody else, and then they ask about<br />
somebody else, and negative information is j ust as good as positi ye,<br />
so the policy is to say nothing in these matters. Bi. it does seem<br />
to me to have overtones of an organised attemptby Left Wingers to<br />
try and denigrate the Australian Security Service.<br />
is it pure politicking at this stage?<br />
1 believe it is.<br />
When can we expect an election can you give us an idea?<br />
No, but I am rot expecting one next month.<br />
Mr Prime Minister, the alleged American Base near<br />
Alice Springs has been denied by a lot of people in high places.<br />
Would you care to comment on it now that it has apparently been proved<br />
to exist there? / 2 fli </p>

05 I would refer you to the comment made in the House<br />
of Representatives by the Minister for Defence in reply to a question<br />
by the Opposition. They asked him ab out military affairs and other<br />
things, and the Minister for Defence said, quite properly, that there<br />
must be information which is not to be publicly provided.<br />
Mr Gorton, do you mind if I re-ask the question<br />
concerning the Russian Embassy. How much damage was caused there<br />
and what do you know abD ut it?<br />
No. ' r<br />
S 614IJ oz-<br />
PM: Well, i know very little about it at all yet. I don't<br />
know what damage was caused there or any of the circumstances<br />
about it whatever. We left quite early this morning, and I have had<br />
'
On the home front in Qiueensiand. Most of the State<br />
is covered with drought at present. The Premier has said he has<br />
made or is making approaches. to you for special drought aid or more<br />
drought aid. What consideration have you given to this at this stage?<br />
PM: I don't recollect any special approaches made by the<br />
Premier. They will have come in and been passed on to the Treasurer,<br />
but in detail I can't give you any answer to that.<br />
Reverting to this bombing of the Russian Embassy<br />
this morning. Any reports would have come in to my own Department,<br />
but I have nothing at all except the most sketchy information. For<br />
all I know it didn't even happen, I have just very sketchy<br />
Q. Should it prove to be true, Sir, do you see this as<br />
an upsurge of violence in this country?<br />
PM: I would most certainly hope not. Should it proxe to<br />
be true ai-d prove to be serious well, it is serious even if it is on<br />
a minor scale, of course. It is thoroughly and utterly reprehensible:<br />
I would certainly hope that there is not an upsurge of viblence in<br />
this country from any quarter.<br />
Q. Mr Prime Minister, another qu~ stion on the home<br />
front. Qu. eensland has applied for special aid for the Central<br />
Queensland Powerhouse, Is there anything you can tell us about this? </p>
