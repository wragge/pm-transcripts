    <content><![CDATA[<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>Are you there, Prime Minister?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Good morning, how are you?</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>Thanks for joining us. Well, how accurately does The Australian</p>
<p>   newspaper report that story today?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I can't help you on that, Howard. All I can say is that it's</p>
<p>   a great plan that will give Australia a much better economic future.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>Okay, but where is it at at the moment? Can you tell us that?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh, we're well down the track and it will be released soon.</p>
<p>   It's involved a lot of work. There are a few more internal</p>
<p>   government processes to be gone through. But I am very enthusiastic.</p>
<p>   It is a great plan for Australia's economic future. It's</p>
<p>   a new tax system. That's what we're offering the Australian</p>
<p>   public, a better one, one that will make us more competitive, one</p>
<p>   that will lift our living standards, one that will generate jobs</p>
<p>   and one that will attract investment.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>Okay, but it has been approved by Cabinet now, has it?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, we've gone through Cabinet. And, Howard, I'm not</p>
<p>   going to go through the details of the processes. I will talk...</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>No, but don't you think we're entitled to know when we're</p>
<p>   going to see it.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>You will have it out quite soon. I'm not going to tell you</p>
<p>   when because I'm not absolutely certain of the precise day</p>
<p>   but it is very close. And I can't help you any more than that</p>
<p>   and I think that's perfectly reasonable because I do have to</p>
<p>   respect the processes of the party. It has to be approved by my</p>
<p>   colleagues and I respect their views and I intend to consult them</p>
<p>   and until that has taken place, I can't say any more.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>But how much of a say will they have in it? When you say your colleagues,</p>
<p>   I take it...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>My colleagues have been involved a great deal in this and...</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>This is the backbench as well.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, the backbench have been expressing views about taxation now</p>
<p>   for a long time. Howard, this package tackles something that should</p>
<p>   have been done years ago. Labor had 13...</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>Well, no one was game to do it. I mean...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, of course they're not. Nobody's been game to do</p>
<p>   it. Labor had 13 years to fix the tax system and all we're</p>
<p>   getting now from Mr Beazley is blind, negative opposition. Mr Beazley</p>
<p>   is against a lot of things, he stands for nothing. He doesn't</p>
<p>   believe in reforming our tax system. He'd abolish our work-for-the-dole</p>
<p>   system. He'd abolish our youth allowance system. Both of those</p>
<p>   schemes have instilled a work ethic in young Australians. Mr Beazley</p>
<p>   is great at destroying and spoiling and opposing but he doesn't</p>
<p>   stand for any change and reform for Australia's future.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>Yeah, okay. But, again, you say it's coming soon. Is it days</p>
<p>   or is it weeks or is it months? Can you tell us that?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, it's certainly not months.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>It's somewhere between days and weeks. Well, you asked me</p>
<p>   Howard, I mean...</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>Well, we feel as though we're being treated like mushrooms.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, no, we're not. No, with great respect, people are not</p>
<p>   being treated like mushrooms. I'm telling you the truth. There</p>
<p>   are certain further processes to be gone through and when they've</p>
<p>   been gone through the package, the plan, will be announced. I can't</p>
<p>   be any more forthright than that.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>Now, there's something that really worried me when I looked</p>
<p>   at that report today.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Which report?</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>In The Australian. Something worried me and would worry</p>
<p>   most Australians and that's if our mortgages were subject to</p>
<p>   a GST, our mortgage repayments. Will they, can you just tell me</p>
<p>   that?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, Howard, I'm not going to say yes or no to any individual</p>
<p>   items. I'm not going to say that. But as you mentioned mortgages,</p>
<p>   as you mention mortgages let me remind you that under the present</p>
<p>   Government housing interest rates are lower than they have been</p>
<p>   for 30 years.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>We know that, but we don't want them to go up again. We don't</p>
<p>   want our repayments to go up again.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, Howard, do you think that I would want to undo all of that</p>
<p>   good work?</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>Unless you wanted to be voted out of office.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I don't want to be voted out of office. Nobody who believes</p>
<p>   that he's got something to contribute to the country wants</p>
<p>   that to happen. But we have delivered the lowest housing interest</p>
<p>   rates for 30 years - $300 a month off the average loan in Australia.</p>
<p>   Now, that is a fantastic economic achievement and it's because</p>
<p>   we got rid of Mr Beazley's $10.5 billion deficit. That made</p>
<p>   quite a contribution towards achieving that goal.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>Now, have you made provision for quarantining people on fixed incomes</p>
<p>   like pensioners and those on the dole?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I can assure you that there will be adequate protection, adequate</p>
<p>   protection, for low-income people, including people on benefits</p>
<p>   and people on low fixed incomes from private sources.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>Can you guarantee they won't be worse off?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>We will guarantee them full protection.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>They won't be worse off?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>That's right.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>All right. Now, what about that guarantee - I think which you first</p>
<p>   gave on this programme Â that whatever the GST rate's</p>
<p>   going to be, or whatever you call it, that it won't go up?</p>
<p>   I mean, how can you guarantee that for all time?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, Howard, you just wait and have a look at what's in the</p>
<p>   plan. And I believe that when people see what we are providing in</p>
<p>   relation to that, they will believe that the rate I've announced</p>
<p>   is the rate they will experience.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>Are you going to call it a goods and services tax?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I think most people will call it that no matter what we might choose</p>
<p>   to call it.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, but...ridiculous to change the name, surely. We</p>
<p>   know what it is.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, look, the truth is that this is not a plan to introduce a</p>
<p>   new tax. It is a plan to change Australia's tax system forever</p>
<p>   in favour of a tax system that will deliver us a more prosperous</p>
<p>   21st Century. It is about the future, this tax system.</p>
<p>   It is about tackling something that should have been done years</p>
<p>   ago. The Labor Party, of course, they'll oppose it. They'll</p>
<p>   just say, no. They'll spoil. They'll run a fear-mongering</p>
<p>   campaign. They'll invent stories.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>Well, it worked last time.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, but are we a better country as a result?</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, of course we're not a better country as a result. In the</p>
<p>   end you've got a responsibility in public life to argue for</p>
<p>   what you believe is right, not what you might believe is politically</p>
<p>   popular and expedient in the short-term. Now, I know there are people</p>
<p>   saying to me that it's unwise to be going down the course that</p>
<p>   I'm going. I think the course I've adopted is good for</p>
<p>   Australia and that's why I'm following it. And I don't</p>
<p>   care how much of a fear campaign Mr Beazley and Mrs Hanson and other</p>
<p>   people run against it. I expect that and we've factored that</p>
<p>   in.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>Would you agree that last time around, when John Hewson was trying</p>
<p>   to sell it, that his sales team let him down Â his sales team</p>
<p>   being the members of Parliament, they didn't understand it</p>
<p>   properly?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Howard, what happened then is interesting history. I'm interested</p>
<p>   in what is going to happen over the next few weeks and months.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>Yeah, but I want to know what you've learnt from that.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I've learnt a lot. And I think the best way that you'll</p>
<p>   find out what I've learnt is how I handle the explanation of</p>
<p>   this plan that will give Australia a far more secure and a far more</p>
<p>   competitive economic future.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>But is it going to be only you selling it? I mean, what confidence</p>
<p>   do you have in the other members of your team to sell it?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh, a lot, a lot. Peter Costello will obviously be very heavily</p>
<p>   involved, as will John Fahey, as will Peter Reith, Tim Fischer,</p>
<p>   John Anderson, all members of the Cabinet, naturally the Treasurer,</p>
<p>   after myself, more so than others. But everybody will be involved.</p>
<p>   The backbench will be involved. I believe there'll be...</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>Does that worry you?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, it enthuses me. Because when all of the details are known to</p>
<p>   everybody in the party they will all see the wisdom and the strength</p>
<p>   and the foresight that is involved in this plan. This plan is about</p>
<p>   setting up Australia for the 21st Century. I mean, we</p>
<p>   cannot go on forever with a taxation system locked in the 1930s,</p>
<p>   40s or 50s. We have got to have enough faith and confidence in our</p>
<p>   own ability to know what is good for our country to embrace a reform</p>
<p>   like this. And I believe the Australian people will listen to what</p>
<p>   is in the plan. They'll hear our explanations. They'll</p>
<p>   give it a fair go. The Labor Party, of course, will blind them with</p>
<p>   fear. I mean, the fear-mongering campaign's already started.</p>
<p>   But in the end the Australian people have enormous commonsense.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>Well, the polls out today say it's about 50/50 at the moment.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, there are polls all the time. If it's 50/50 at the moment,</p>
<p>   that's not a bad start because Â that's not a bad</p>
<p>   start because all the people have had so far is a diet of fear and</p>
<p>   negative reaction from Mr Beazley.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>But don't you get the impression that Australia in 1998 has</p>
<p>   lost a bit of that sort of get up and go pioneering spirit that</p>
<p>   we haven't embraced something like this</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, one of the reasons why it has is that we have a backward</p>
<p>   tax system. We have a tax system that doesn't encourage people</p>
<p>   to work hard. We have a tax system that slugs exporters. We have</p>
<p>   a tax system which is confusing and illogical. We have a tax system</p>
<p>   that discourages savings. In a word, our tax system is holding us</p>
<p>   back.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>We have a pretty greedy government in Canberra these days too,</p>
<p>   would you agree?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Less greedy than the one it replaced, far less greedy. I mean,</p>
<p>   we are spending less. We've kept taxes down. We've honoured</p>
<p>   in full our commitment not to raise any taxes, honoured that in</p>
<p>   full. We've delivered on all of our own taxation promises and</p>
<p>   we've cut Mr Beazley's deficit. I mean, Mr Beazley left</p>
<p>   us with a deficit of $10.5 billion a year - $95 billion in aggregate</p>
<p>   over the previous seven or eight years. We have turned that into</p>
<p>   a prospective surplus this current year of about $2.5 billion. Now,</p>
<p>   that is a fantastic achievement and one of the results of that is</p>
<p>   that we have much lower housing interest rates. Mr Beazley would</p>
<p>   change all of that if he got back. He'd go back into a big</p>
<p>   deficit, big spending approach.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>Well, the other issue to talk about then too in this regard is</p>
<p>   tax sharing arrangements between the Federal Government and the</p>
<p>   States. And Richard Court, who runs a regular segment on my programme,</p>
<p>   as you know, he promised me, he said: when I get the Prime Minister,</p>
<p>   John Howard, here, for last weekend, I'm going to get into</p>
<p>   his ear over the Federal/State tax sharing arrangement. And that's</p>
<p>   got to be part of this new package. Is it going to be?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I said, when I laid down the five principles, that one of</p>
<p>   them would be to address the imbalance in Commonwealth/State financial</p>
<p>   relations. And I believe that what we are proposing in that area</p>
<p>   is fair and forward-looking.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>It doesn't sound like you give them much ground.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I've had a discussion with the Premier about it, in</p>
<p>   general terms - he hasn't had a full briefing on the details,</p>
<p>   that will come later. But I believe what we are proposing is very</p>
<p>   fair and it will be seen by people who want a reinvigoration of</p>
<p>   Commonwealth/State financial relations, who want genuine reform</p>
<p>   in that area, those people will see what we are proposing as very</p>
<p>   fair indeed, very fair.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>I'm talking with the Prime Minister now. The United Stated</p>
<p>   Secretary of State, Madeleine Albright's due, is it today in</p>
<p>   Australia?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Mrs Albright, I understand, she is arriving late tonight, yes.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>Okay. Now, she's had a shot, before she got here, about One</p>
<p>   Nation's isolationist policies, and you won't mind that,</p>
<p>   but given the level of protection her government affords the rural</p>
<p>   sector against our imports, isn't that a bit hypocritical?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I don't know that I would interpret what she said as</p>
<p>   being an intervention in Australian domestic politics. I don't</p>
<p>   think...</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>The question was thrown at her, she had to answer it.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>But put that aside. We are obviously unhappy about some of the</p>
<p>   protectionist policies of the Americans, in agriculture.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>Are you going to tackle her over that?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, that issue will come up, yes, it will come up. I will go</p>
<p>   to the discussions in a constructive way. But I want to make it</p>
<p>   very plain for all Australians to hear that we remain very unhappy</p>
<p>   with the way in which agricultural exports are discriminated against</p>
<p>   by the major trading blocks and that's the United State and</p>
<p>   the Europeans. Now, the Europeans are worse in this respect than</p>
<p>   the United States but the United States are not reluctant to use</p>
<p>   their enormous muscle to sell, at very low prices, into markets</p>
<p>   that have been the possession of Australia for a long time.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>It's nice to have friends like that, isn't it?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I mean, you can speak plainly to your friends Â the</p>
<p>   United States has no better ally than Australia. Australia has been</p>
<p>   a very strong, but at times critical, but always reliable and candid</p>
<p>   ally of the United States and that gives us the right to speak bluntly</p>
<p>   and plainly when Australian interests are being hurt. And Australian</p>
<p>   farmers are the least subsidised, most efficient in the world and</p>
<p>   it is an insult to them when, despite that efficiency and lack of</p>
<p>   subsidy, they find other countries with enormous financial muscle</p>
<p>   pushing them out of third world markets. And I won't be reluctant</p>
<p>   to raise that issue. I've raised it before in personal discussions</p>
<p>   with President Clinton and I received certain assurances from President</p>
<p>   Clinton in response to those earlier discussions and I will naturally</p>
<p>   remind my American friends, in a courteous way, of those assurances</p>
<p>   in our discussions.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>All right. Just before you go, too, were you disappointed to leave</p>
<p>   our State with no commitment from the State branch to put One Nation</p>
<p>   last on the ÂHow to Vote' cards for the Federal election?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I believe that the Western Australian division will make the right</p>
<p>   decision and do the right thing in relation to that. I discussed</p>
<p>   the matter with both the Party President, David Johnston and also</p>
<p>   the Premier.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>Why won't they commit?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Howard, well, I think the Liberal Party should decide these things</p>
<p>   in its time, in the right way and not when nominated by the Labor</p>
<p>   Party. The people who are running around Australia saying you've</p>
<p>   got to say now, you've got to say now what you're going</p>
<p>   to do, is the Labor Party.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>Yeah but you said now, you made your decision.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, Howard, the decision was always one for each State Division.</p>
<p>   And I said all along that it would be a matter for each State Division.</p>
<p>   And I know the Liberal Party well enough to know that the way the</p>
<p>   organisation gets the right result is to be allowed to do it in</p>
<p>   its own way, in its own time. Public lectures from Federal leaders</p>
<p>   to State organisations are often counterproductive. Now, you've</p>
<p>   seen all the other State Divisions make a decision in a particular</p>
<p>   direction. I have every confidence that the decision taken by the</p>
<p>   Western Australian branch will be in the best interests of the Liberal</p>
<p>   Party and also in the best interest of Australia. And, frankly,</p>
<p>   they will take that decision, as they should, in their own time,</p>
<p>   not when Mr Beazley and the members of the Labor Party say they</p>
<p>   should take...</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>Well, I think they're just waiting for you to announce the</p>
<p>   election, aren't they?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, what you've got to...</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>Do it now!</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, no, I don't know when the election will be except some</p>
<p>   time between now and when it's due and that's not until</p>
<p>   March or April of next year. I am in no hurry. Let me make it plain.</p>
<p>   I mean, I haven't said that I want to have an election by a</p>
<p>   particular date. I have said that the tax plan will be on view for</p>
<p>   inspection, examination, explanation and debate for an adequate</p>
<p>   amount of time before there's an election. Now, that remains</p>
<p>   my intention. I do not intend to announce the plan and then go to</p>
<p>   the Governor General the following day. That would be an insult</p>
<p>   to my fellow Australians and I've got no intention of doing</p>
<p>   that.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>Must leave you there, Prime Minister, but thanks for joining us</p>
<p>   and we'll talk to you again in about three weeks time.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>There's no election between now and then, is there?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I can guarantee you that.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>Talk to you again later.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>[ends] </p>
<p>   .</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
