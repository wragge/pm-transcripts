PRIME MINISTER<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING, MP<br />
COMMONWEALTH DAY 1993<br />
Commonwealth Day is an occasion to reflect on the continuing relevance to Australia and<br />
the international community of the Commonwealth of Nations..<br />
This year Commonwealth Day has taken as its theme the importance of human values, It<br />
is appropriate that it should do so. The Commonwealth brings together 50 countries<br />
representing a quarter of the world's population. Its special character and enduring<br />
stre'ngth lie in the mutual respect held by Commonwealth member states for human<br />
values, and for each other's sovereignty, traditions and culture. Respect for democracy<br />
and the rule of law, for fundamental human rights, and for good governance are important<br />
principles uniting the peoples of the Commonwealth in their diversity.<br />
At their most recent-meeting in Harare, Zimbabwe in 1991, Commonwealth Heads of<br />
Government reaffirmed that the Commonwealth's principles, including its human values,<br />
were as relevant as ever before. In Cyprus~ in October this year, Heads of Government<br />
will again have these values in mind when considering the way forward for the<br />
Commonwealth into the 1990s. The commitments by the Heads oi Government, will, I<br />
am confident, enable the Commonwealth to remain relevant to its member states for now<br />
and well into the future.<br />
