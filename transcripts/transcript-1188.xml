    <content><![CDATA[<p>THE C. B. ALEXANDER PRESBYTERIAN AGRICULTURAL COLLEGE<br />OFFICIAL OPENING<br />TOCAL, N. S. YJ. 6TH NOVEMBER. 1965<br />Speech by the Prime Minister, Sir Robert Menzies</p>
<p><br />Sell, Sir and Ladies and Gentlemen</p>
<p><br />This is a rather terrifying sort of an occasionÂ because it says in the book of the words....." the Prime MinisterÂ shall deliver an address" and I must say that sounds ratherÂ formidable. But before I proceed to deliver an address, IÂ would like to add a supplementary note about the presence of theÂ Moderator-General. You have been quite rightly informed that we are<br />the only country in the worId that runs to the luxury of a<br />Moderator-General. The Head of the Church of Scotland is the<br />Moderator and thereby, Sir, hangs a tale. I tell it because I<br />notice you are down to preach a sermon later on, and this little<br />story may improve you. Laughter)</p>
<p><br />One of the Moderators of the Church of Scotland,<br />4vatt Anderson, whom a number of you will remember told me<br />that he was preaching at Craithie church as part of his annual<br />duty to the late King George VI in this little church near<br />Balmoral, and cn the wa across afterwards to have lunch, the<br />King was very complimenary. He said. " Moderator, that is the<br />best sermon 1 have heard for years and years" and the Moderator,<br />somewhat pleased with this Royal approval said, " Vell, thank<br />you Sir, thank you very much. " Yes," said King George VI,<br />' I Aad the watch on you and it took twelve minutes onlyl<br />( Laughter) Now, Sir, I don't iknow whether there is any moral<br />in that, but I leave it toyou for what it is worth.<br />Although I m bound to say that I am no great<br />believer in the brevity of sermons, I think it depends on the<br />sermon, iyself. I remember one of the shortest sermons I listened<br />to in my life was delivered by the late celebrated and highly<br />contentious Larry Rentoul in Melbourne, and it took forty-five<br />minutes forty-Tive minutes and even at my young age, I<br />enjoyed it. Now this, I think is a wonderful occasion. ' Jhat<br />has been done here already just staggers me. The vision of the<br />great benefactor who brought this about has been matched by the<br />vision and imagination of those who designed this college who<br />have furnished it with buildings, who have laid down the lines for<br />its future. Now this is a wonderful hall that we are in. The<br />buildings themselves,( I have just Lad a quick glance at them, are<br />charming in design, and this is good because I am one of those who<br />believes that when generation after generation of boys goes to<br />a place of learning whether it is an agricultural college or a<br />university or whatever it may be it is a good thing for them<br />to have memories of beauty to take with them during their lives.<br />This is one of the civilising things in life, to see beauty and<br />to recollect beauty in years to come and that is why, Sir, I am<br />so delighted with the way in which this great task has been<br />attacked and so far accomplished.</p>
<p><br />Now this is an agricultural college. In one of theÂ notes that was sent to me, a rather useful phrase, I thought,Â occurred, and that was that the idea was to bridge the gap betweenÂ knowledge and application and this is something I want to talk<br />about for a little while, just in a conversational fashion, notÂ by way of an address. We have lived or many of us have lived throughÂ a remarkable period of development in Australian rural industries,Â starting from a time when you just took what nature appeared toÂ provide and made the most of it, and if it was poor country, wellÂ it was poor country. I was born in a place called the MalleeÂ at a time when the Melbourne headlines regularly said, " Is theÂ Mallee worth saving?" and it was understandable. It was a lightÂ sandy loam, had a very sketchy rainfall, sometimes a completeÂ black-out in a drought sometimed 12, 14 inches of rain, and IÂ can remember as a boy the first agricultural scientist comingÂ up into the district and going out on to a property and havingÂ a ring of farmers around him and explaining to them about a strangeÂ thing called superphosphate. They had never heard of superphosphates, and I'm thereÂ like a small you know, ears pricked up listening to all<br />this. And he explained that on that soil in that sort of<br />climate, in that kind of rainfall he thou ght they would all do<br />better by going in for rotation of crops which was itself rather<br />a novelty in those days, and also using a dressing of superphosphate<br />which he put down at one hundredweight to the acre. Well,<br />even from the rear view that I had of the farmers present, you<br />could tell that they weren't very much impressed by this.<br />" We've never used this stuff before"... " What does it cost?"<br />( These were the days before the superphosphates<br />bounty.) ? Laughter) " What does it And<br />finally all of them ignored the advice except three three of<br />the best farmers in the area and even they were cautious enough<br />to say, " Well, we'll try hall a hundred weight" and when after<br />the next harvest it turned out that the ha got three bushels<br />to the acre more than any of their neighbours, the first round<br />of the battle for superphosphates had been won. You see, it<br />takes time doesn't it? Because we are tremendously conservative<br />by instinct about these things.<br />Now it is tremendously important, indeed it is<br />vital, that all those old conservative ideas should disappear in<br />the case of the rural industries and for a very good reason.<br />The international solvency of Australia, our balance of trade,<br />our balance of payments, aepends primarily on the volume of our<br />exports, and the volume and value of our exports depends primarily,<br />as to a vast percentage, on the products of the land whether in<br />cattle or sheep or cereals or watever the product may be. We<br />have done rather well in the last few years, remarkably well,<br />all things considered but we can't hope to avoid balance of<br />payments troubles, and I don't want to become too technical<br />about those, unless we can maintairn and steadily increase the<br />value of our exports from this country. The solvency of masses<br />of people who know nothing about the and will depend on it.<br />And in the second place, as time goes on, as we<br />have long since reached a period of full employment, you have<br />pressures on the economy you have pressures on resources<br />abour is not easy to get, labour may have to be paid more because<br />it is scarce all this is highly intelligible. It comes back<br />to the man on the land who, for the most part takes the price<br />that the world will give him but pays the cost that internal<br />affairs in Australia require him to meet, and his one hope of<br />meeting these thin-s and of growing and prospering is to increase<br />his own skill, technically, in terms of management, steadily year<br />/ 3</p>
<p>3<br />by year. Australia needs above all people today, highly<br />pteroapilnee dw hfoa rmtehrisn kapheo plea nwyhboo dayr ec ann otb e ofa tfhaartm erh aap py roiutp woerfe<br />a sort of fool's business, people who know the skills that<br />are required in animal husbandry, in cultivation, in whatever<br />it may be, because these will be the guarantee in the future<br />of the steady improvement of the skil s of the techniques<br />needed to meet these great problems, these two great problems<br />to which I have referred.<br />The matter perhaps could be put in another way.<br />.1e have in Australia some of the most remarkable research<br />institutes in the world. The CSIRO is deservedly world<br />famouL for the work that it does, and there is other work<br />being done in various places, including the universities<br />pure science, applied science. Now all of this, of course, is<br />tremendously important, but for years now, quite a number of<br />us have been troubled about the Tact that there is too big an<br />interval between the result of the research work and its<br />ap , lication on the farm. There has been a gap what is called<br />in another sense a deficiency of extension services, and<br />this is important because time counts. It's all very well<br />for somebody in CSIRO to make a great discovery which in the<br />field of animal husbandry for example, could have great<br />results and then find that it's a year or two years before<br />that filters through to the man who is actually conducting<br />the operations on the spot, and when I enquire why, why do<br />we have this delay, all too frequently the answer is that<br />you can't have an unskilled man interpreting the results of<br />research to a farmer. The interpreter himself must possess<br />skill, he must know what he is talking about, and the<br />wonderful thing to me is that in this place, when you get<br />fully going, you will have 120 young men coming through<br />here, acquiring skills which will make them the most effective<br />interpreters in the world of the results of scientific<br />research and applied scientific research to the problems on<br />the spot of the man on the farm, so that you are helping in<br />a very material way to supply a great national need.<br />Now all that, you see, is on the text that you<br />provided me with the gap between knowledge and application,<br />and it is because of the reasons that I have given by way of<br />elaborating that, that I regard it as a very great honour to<br />come here a great privilege to be here in the early days of<br />a place wAich will inevitably become not only great in<br />itself but famous over the country, and if I hadn't felt that<br />it was an honour I still would have had to come because my<br />colleague, Alan Pairhall told me to and if I may betray a<br />political secret to you if you want our Ministers to work<br />Tor you, you occasionally have to work for them. So here I<br />am, and ef course in particular if I may say so, delighted<br />to see my old friend, the Moderator Fred McKay. I always<br />remember with great interest that when my daughter was about<br />to be married, we said to her: " Now is there anybody you<br />would like to bring in addition to the local Minister? Is<br />there anybody you would like to have at your wedding?"<br />She said, " Yes I'd like Fred McKay" and down he came and has<br />a very honoured place in our house and in our minds.<br />Now Sir, I don't think that I want to say any more<br />than that. I've run well over the twelve minutes that I<br />mentioned in that exhilarating story of mine. I've told you<br />e a / 4</p>
<p>4<br />why I'm glad to be here and I've tried to tell you in<br />a very few words why I think this is one of the most<br />important things that I would have looked at this year<br />of great present interest of great future importance<br />to the nation, and in particular, I hope and know, of<br />great importance to the individuals of whom at the moment<br />we see the first fifteen who will come through here, who<br />will be made good citizens as well as good farmers<br />good farmers as well as good students and good practical<br />people of a scientific bent. This is to the good of<br />Australia and it will do me a world of gcod to be able<br />to remember it.<br />I declare is this right? I'm never too sure<br />about this bit I declare this College open.<br />o1 44</p>
