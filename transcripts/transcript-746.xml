SEVENTH ANNUAL MEATWORKS CONVENTION<br />
HELD AT CASINO, N. S. W.<br />
MAY, 1961<br />
Speech by the Prima Ministpr, the Rt. Hon. Sir Robert Menzies<br />
Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen<br />
I speak here tonight under a certain disadvantage<br />
because I have to make a speech about the Seventh Annual Meatworks<br />
Convention and I am not a meatworker, norindeed in any<br />
non-human sense do I drive any cattle ( Laughter) and I am up<br />
here with an acknowledged Australian expert who has just spoken<br />
to you, but I will try to survive this handicap.<br />
Before I begin to survive it, I must tell you that<br />
.1 looked at this pamphlet, somewhat ambiguously colured orange<br />
on one side and yellow on the other ( Laughter), to have a look<br />
at what you were going to discuss, and at once I felt at home<br />
" Country Meatworks Effluent" ( Laughter). Nothing could make a<br />
chap like me feel more at home instantly ( Laughter). " The<br />
Tallow House" that awakens echoes in my mind. Then, of<br />
course, remembering some of the debates in which I have taken<br />
a hand " A Meat-cutting Demonstration" ( Laughter). And<br />
remembering division lists and divisions in Parliament " Belt<br />
Conveyors for Handling Meat" ( Laughter). Really, I must say,<br />
Sir, that in the whole of my public life I have never known such<br />
superb tact exhibited well in advance in the selection of The<br />
topic. Now, as you have already been told, and I will<br />
repeat it because that is one of the habits of my trade, this<br />
is your Seventh Annual Meatworks Convention and the spons: ors,<br />
the Country Meatworks Association, are twenty-one today, so<br />
that this is at one and the same time, a relatively recent<br />
organisation and a relatively experienced one. You really stand<br />
in a very happy stage of your development and your work, and<br />
I know what your purposes are I think I know. You want to<br />
bring people together from the various country meatworks all<br />
over the State executive people and so on, and let them get<br />
to know each other and let them get to learn something from<br />
each other bocauso wb. nll hnve something tG. o . learn from other<br />
people, poolingour kiowledgea and"-. iap* oving our: technical<br />
officioncy 0<br />
It is the improvement of technical efficiency that<br />
I want to talk to you about not at undue length but for some<br />
little time. You will be surprised looking at my youthful<br />
appearance, that I first went into Parliament in the State<br />
Parliament of Victoria thirty-five years ago, I just almost<br />
whisper that. Thirty-five years ago. And thirty-five years<br />
ago in my own State, the one thing that you could get a heated<br />
argument about instantly was inland killing establishments,<br />
because we had about three and they were all broke ( Laughter),<br />
and whatever government was in office they had to go along to<br />
it and say " What about a little subsidy?" I learned at that<br />
time that they were not financially successful because they<br />
didntt have a long enough killing season, they didn't have a<br />
sufficient variety of commodities to be handled they had all<br />
the disabilities of long-distance transport to the principal<br />
markets, they had the problem of an extra handling. / 2 </p>
<p>-2<br />
So all the wise men including myself, no doubt at that stage,<br />
who had ambitions to be wise said, " This is hopeless. You<br />
cannot have establishmnents of this kind except at the main ports."<br />
Now, Sir, I think you will agree with me that this was alr:', ost a<br />
received doctrine at that time, thirty-five years ago having a<br />
quick look at you before the lifetime of a considerable number<br />
of you. And yet here you are celebrating your twenty-fivst<br />
anniversary and celebrating it in an atmosphere of high confidence<br />
and remarkable achievement. This, I think, deserves to h-ave a<br />
chap~ lter of its own in Australian history the thing which was<br />
thought to be doomed a failure by sceptical people has now proved<br />
itself a magnificent success.<br />
It hasn't done that by accident. Times have changed,<br />
of course. Our production is a long way up. There is a mu--h<br />
greater through-put. Excport markets have been opened in tho most<br />
remarkable fashion. We have better markets at home and abrcad and<br />
we, indodd have much bettor thansport than we had at the time<br />
that I am talking about. All those things have added togeti-ier to<br />
produce the foundation for what you are doing, but only the<br />
foundation, because no system of this kind can succeed unless<br />
you have individuals in government, if you like, scientific<br />
people, experts in the service of government, individuals in the<br />
induistry looking after the managerial side of the industry, and<br />
indi1 viduals who are in themselves producers in the industry. All<br />
these people must get together if you are to achieve success,<br />
the kind of success that you have so far obtained,<br />
I want to elaborate that. One of our problemns<br />
in Australia is that we have never quite got to understan', the<br />
system of government under which we live. We know, donli; we,<br />
that we have a Federal Constitution. There are some peopLe who<br />
can remember the great battles in the 90' s of the last century<br />
to introduce it " one people, ono flag, one destiny" t.-jese<br />
old slogans come back into the mind. So we became 62 yea-s ago,<br />
a nation a nation which embraced within itself six separcate<br />
States with limited powers, just as the new national ParlJament<br />
had limited powers but of a wider, national character, And<br />
beneath those, we have had the local governing system in Australia,<br />
a system with a proud history and a remarkable record of service<br />
to the people. But here we are Commonwealth, State, local<br />
government, the individual. There are very many people to be<br />
found in Australia who, whatever the problem may be and whatever<br />
the power of the Commonwealth ma: y be it may be non-existent on<br />
that point always speak first of going to the Commonwealth.<br />
This troubles me because I am a federalist. I believe in States.<br />
I believe in the distribution of power but as I have had<br />
occasion to say before today, if we drift into the habit of<br />
mind of saying that everything is, in financial terms, a<br />
Commonwealth responsibility then the day will come when the<br />
people will say, " Well if the Commonwealth the central government,<br />
the central parliament are to have all. the financial<br />
responsibility then perhaps they ought to have all power."<br />
This is a great danger, but it can happen. Therefore I want to<br />
put it to you that if we are to have this federal system of<br />
ours working properly, we must begin by understanding tho<br />
individual responsibility of each arm of government what is<br />
its responsibility, what is its power? What is the power of<br />
the State? What is its responsibility? What is the powerV of<br />
some local authority or some statutory body? It sounds liJke<br />
a lawyer's exercise, but it isntt. It is the very essenco of<br />
understanding our own country and its problem. 0000" 00~~ / 3 </p>
<p>-3<br />
Of course, the answer to it is not to be standing<br />
off fighting about various things: " That's your business<br />
that's my business thatts your business that's my<br />
business." The answer is to establish a system of co-operation<br />
so that each of us, each form of government will bring its own<br />
power, its own authority to the common pool, in order to<br />
achieve a common social result. Now I hope you don't think<br />
I am being academic about this. I'm not. Vv been trying<br />
to run a federal system for more years than anybody else in<br />
the world and this is the kind of thing that constantly comes<br />
up into my mind. We must have a system of co-operation.<br />
Let us apply this, Mr. President, to this great<br />
organisation and the kind of thing that you are engaged in.<br />
You can't hope to produce the development in the meat industry<br />
tlhat you want and that we want unless, year by yea~ r, there are<br />
people engaged in research in the laboratoy on the farm or<br />
wherever it may be, and unless there are other people who take<br />
t; he results of the scientific research and who take them to<br />
the man on the land who must put thom into practice if the<br />
results are to be achieved,<br />
Finally, we must have the man on the land wil-1ling<br />
to receive this information and to put it into effect. Now<br />
this sounds very simple, I venture to say it has prov-rI in<br />
practice to be an amazingly difficult thing: scientifi.:<br />
research, extension services and a willingness to receive<br />
them and to practice them.<br />
Sir, I remember when I was a boy of about twelve<br />
I suppose, being up in the bush in the north-west of Victoria<br />
in the wheat country in which at that time there was a<br />
deficiency of scientific knowledge and application it was<br />
marginal country with a somewhat dubious rainfall. I remember<br />
going out as a youngster and standing behind a ring of good,<br />
solid farmers in the district. On a little mound in the<br />
middle was a notable agricultural scientist from the Vict,' orian<br />
Department of Agriculture and he was standing there he was<br />
a most practical chap and he was talking to them about when<br />
they ought to burn their stubble and when they ought to harrow<br />
and that thoy would all do well in this particular sandy loam<br />
in that area by putting a hundredweight of super on to their<br />
ground. They looked at each other I could see them. Little<br />
pitchers occasionally have long ears I didntt miss much<br />
that day. You could almost hear them saying to each other,<br />
" Well. I've never done that before. What is this stuff,<br />
anyhow? And what does it cost?" The scientist was magnificent.<br />
He was practical and convincing. I was twelve years old.<br />
He made me understand it crystal-clear, but of course I didn't<br />
have a farm to put the super on. ( Laughter) There were three<br />
farmers in the district who were first-class men, reco,-iised to<br />
be the best farmers and they were persuaded but not com-pletely.<br />
So they said, " Well, you know, it's a bit of an experirient.<br />
What did he say a hundredweight. dell we'll try a half a<br />
hundredweight." ( Laughter) And they useA half a hundredweight<br />
of super and in that country with that soil and that rainfall,<br />
when the harvest came in they were all three bushels to the<br />
acre better off than their neighbours. Of course, the news got<br />
around and within three or four years, everybody was using super<br />
and not being frightfully afraid to use a hundredweight and<br />
some bold spirits were using a hundredweight and a half.<br />
Now I merely tell you this little story because<br />
this is, in a small compass and in a small boy's memory, the<br />
0 0 0 0 1100 </p>
<p>whole problem of extension services somebody at the middle to<br />
discover it; somebody on the scientific side to be competent<br />
to analyse soils to discover what the deficiencies are, to<br />
discover what ail must be given to that soil, and then otiier<br />
people who can take this precious, carefully-garnered scientific<br />
information and make it available to the people, and thirdly<br />
the man on the land willing to receive it. You see, my l~ ittle<br />
story has a moral in it because most of them weren't willing<br />
to receive it, This calls for immense skill on the part of the<br />
man who is running the extension service. He must have a clear<br />
mind and a persuasive tongue and he must be backed by the<br />
research work done here or here or here,<br />
Now, Sir, I venture to say that this has a complete<br />
application to the meat industry. I remember that before the<br />
war, I wont over to England. I was then Attorney-General, but<br />
a sort of useful rouseabout chap, you see. I went a couple of<br />
times to argue about what? to argue about meat, the excport of<br />
meat to the United Kingdom and we gave an awful lot of attention~<br />
in taiose days to freight advantages that the Argentines had<br />
you know, shipping freights and distances of voyage and these<br />
were very important. But perhaps at that time we were not<br />
giving enough attention to how you were to im~ prove your breeds<br />
of cattle and accelerate their periods of maturity not only<br />
by the genetics of the cattle industry but by developing pastures,<br />
by producing appropriate legumes in particular parts of Australia.<br />
These things were almost in their embryonic stage. These are the<br />
things that have been worked on; these are the things til-at have<br />
produced such an enormous development in the meat industr-y that<br />
writh the slightest push, you would supplant wheat and flour as<br />
the second-greatest export from Australia.<br />
Sir, I think this is a groat work and I wish it<br />
well, We have discussed it a great deal in my Cabinet w~ ith<br />
my colleagues, indeed we have one or two papers coming up in<br />
the lift at this very moment on it. I, myself, have had long<br />
discussions with the Chairman of the C. S. I. R. O0 Sir Frederick<br />
White, who is tremendously keen on this not only in connection<br />
with extension services in the primary Industries but also in<br />
the secondary industries.<br />
You know it is a remarkablo thing in our country,<br />
but we produce scientists of the first rank we needntt be<br />
apologising for the native intelligence or the capacity for<br />
scholarship of the Australian young man or woman. This is quite<br />
clear. C. S. I. R. 0. and other bodies of a corresponding kind<br />
conduct research into rural problems into manufacturing<br />
problems. C. S. I. R. 0. researches inio wool, on which I opened<br />
a new institute that they have created in Geelong only the other<br />
day, operate both ways,<br />
If wool is to be sold and if the woolgrower is to<br />
continue to have an expanding market at a competent price which<br />
is, of course, an entirely different matter but if he is to<br />
have that then wool must sell itself around the world. I know4<br />
there will be people to sell it but it must sell itself, it<br />
must have a quality which commends it to the hundreds arid<br />
hundreds of millions of people around the world who want to be<br />
clad and kept warm, Therefore the C. S. I. R. 0. has done the most<br />
remarkable series of research jobs into shrinkage, into<br />
crea ' sing, into moth-proofing, into all these things whica<br />
affect the sale of wool and, happily in the case of that<br />
industry they have in quite recent times been able to establish<br />
a compleie communion of spirit and of understanding with the<br />
S 0 060009.15 </p>
<p>wool industry. Sir ' Uilliam Gunn and Mr. Vines and these other<br />
leaders in this field are now absolutely in touch, mentally and<br />
physically, with the C. S. I. R. O. and the result is that the work<br />
they do in that field can go oui.<br />
But there are other people concerned. What about<br />
the manufacturer? He can't conduct research into wool, He may<br />
do it in a very trifling way but he can't conduct the great<br />
researches into wool, into ail these aspects of it and therefore<br />
ho is one of the people to whom the extension service must go.<br />
C. S. I. R. O. do a lot of industrial research work. They produce<br />
ideas. They find there is a litt'. le difficulty in bridging the<br />
gap between whathppens in their labs. and what happens in the<br />
factory. Therefore believe me, we all have to go out and sell<br />
this idea of extension of scientific research into the ultimate<br />
field of action, whether it is a factory, or a farm. This is,<br />
I think, of tremendous importance. And It is because, Sir, I know<br />
how warmly you agree with this general approach that I have<br />
ventured to say something about it to this great and very important<br />
convention tonight, Very important, because you come from all<br />
over the State. Very important because in tho vary nature of<br />
your occupation, you are in a position to influence the mindsevery<br />
one of you of scores of people and perhaps hundreds of<br />
W peopla. i am a species of Prime Minister and I have been<br />
there a long time and there are those who say that I am notA<br />
improving with age ( Laughter) and no doubt they are quite :. ight.<br />
I wouldn't dare to dispute it but at least I have been thure<br />
long enough to have some pretty clear idea of the problems of my<br />
country4' This is my country and it is yours and I want to help<br />
to solve its problems because, like you or some of you, I have<br />
children and grandchildren and look to the future. Now, this<br />
being so, what do ixre do about all this. We have at the moment<br />
I repeat something in a different form that I said this afternoonin<br />
this country an enormous period of development going on.<br />
I am not going to make a party political speech there are some<br />
who think it should do better and some who think it couldn't,<br />
but, anyhow, we have had an enormous period of development and<br />
W welre having it and in the course of this time thanks to the<br />
policy instituted by Mr. Calwell when he was Minister for<br />
Immigration, and pursued by us we have had a great order of<br />
immigration into Australia. I saw this morning in the newspaper,<br />
which perhaps was right ( Laughter) that we have now had two<br />
million post-war mi grant s. All I know is that the rate of<br />
increase in our population in Australia is quite formidable, quite<br />
formidable. W~~ hea ve a bigger percentage net increase from bth<br />
natural increase and immigration than Japan has at the present<br />
time and as I took the opportunity of saying to the American<br />
Congress on the last occasion that I was invited to address it,<br />
we are receiving more migrants into Australia, per thousand of<br />
our own existing population, than America did in the heyday of<br />
her immigration after the Civil War. It's worth remembering that.<br />
You cantt have this enormous increase in population,<br />
with all the demands that it sets up without having certai n<br />
results. One of them quite obviously is that if you are ' going<br />
to have migrants, they must have work to do, and if they are to<br />
have work to do, it is oqttally obvious that a mere fraction of<br />
thorn can hope to find it on the land, on fars, for reasons that<br />
I needntt discuss with you. Therefore, you must have manufacturing<br />
industries and tertiary industries, servicer transport and the<br />
like,, And all this is good. All this puts a tremendous<br />
pressure on the resources of the country. All of this means that<br />

you have to develop new things, whether they are a vast affair<br />
like the Snowy Mountains or whether they are beef roads in<br />
Queensland or coal-ports or something somewhere else, You<br />
must keep on developing the resources of the country and<br />
this takes a lot of money and all of these things adled together<br />
put a great pressure on the currency of the country. A<br />
great pressure. Unless it is watched, it can become an inflationary<br />
pressure and produce a rise in costs all round. Thatts why<br />
every government has to say to itself, at least once a week<br />
and indeed, I say it to myself more frequently " Our<br />
international solvency depends on what we can sell to tho<br />
world to match what we buy from the world." What we soll to<br />
the world, although there has been a very healthy increase in<br />
manufacturing exports is still predominantly the product of<br />
the farm and the station. Because that is so, one of tLa<br />
conditions of our international solvency and with it cur<br />
prospects of future development, is that the cost level. should<br />
be hept as stable as possible.<br />
Now, everybody will agree that this is a great<br />
problem. So it is. You don't solve that problem merely by<br />
thinking in terms of wages or arbitration systems. You will<br />
help to solve it very materially by increasing productivity<br />
which means that the overheads are spread over a much greater<br />
turnover; increasing efficiency in the means of production,<br />
increasing efficiency in the means of handling, because these<br />
are elements which counter cost increases and which enable these<br />
great industries to continue to stand on their own feet and<br />
look confidently to their own future.<br />
And by that route again, I come back to what I<br />
was saying to you efficiency efficiency is not something<br />
you read about in a book, not something you necessarily achieve<br />
by practising yoga exercises in the morning which I don't.<br />
( Laughter) Efficiency for thlis purpose is something whW. ch<br />
derives from increasing knowledge of the problems of the<br />
industry, increasing knowledge of the scientific aspects of the<br />
industry, whether they are biological or physical or whatever<br />
they may be; increasing efficiency in the treatment of the<br />
product, the handling of the product, in the marketing of the<br />
product. Sir, I hope that nobody supposes that when your<br />
organisation has a convention people just come along because<br />
they are going to have a picnic and meet each other and have a<br />
good time because I hope they will have all those but I am<br />
perfectly certain behind all this is your determination that in<br />
spite of the eccentricities of politicians and there are some<br />
occasionally ( laughter), you are firmly determined that your<br />
industry is-going to become more effective in itself more<br />
efficient in itself and therefore meet the problem ol~ its growth<br />
and of its costs. Sir, that is, I think what I wanted to say to you.<br />
I think it is a great compliment Zo be asked to come up hiere,<br />
Ifm going back afterwards, I hope. We haye a Cabinet meeting<br />
in the morning. Lifets just one long routine, you knows<br />
( laughter) in politics, but if the boys look at me in the<br />
morning and say, " You know, you've got a bit of a { 7leam<br />
in the eye this morning " 1 1 will refer them to you ( Laughiter)<br />
and attribute all credit to you. Thank you very much for having<br />
listened to me thank you very much for having invited me,,<br />
wish you well and, for once, I mgigt0eebrwa<br />
stood up to do I am going to declare the Convention open. </p>
