    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Australian Government will seek a commitment from States and Territories to deliver newborn Hearing Screening for all Australian babies from 1 January 2011. </p>
<p>Presently, only 75 per cent of newborns are screened. This varies from over 95 per cent in some States and Territories to less than 40 per cent in others.</p>
<p>Our children deserve better than this.</p>
<p>About 500 children every year are born with a moderate to profound permanent hearing impairment. However, many of these children are not identified until months or even years after birth.</p>
<p>Hearing screening involves a simple, non-invasive test that is relatively quick and easy to perform.</p>
<p>Early detection and treatment of a hearing impairment can be vitally important in a child's ability to develop language skills, in their later education and their employment prospects.</p>
<p>Children whose hearing impairment is detected in the first days of life can be fitted with a hearing device from as early as three months.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister will call on Premiers and Chief Ministers at the forthcoming Council of Australian Governments meeting to fast-track the introduction of universal and standardised newborn hearing screening.</p>
<p>This Government is committed to improving the health of our future generations, and ensuring that every child has the opportunity to reach their full potential.</p>
<p>With the Government's $60 billion in public hospital funding to begin flowing to States and Territories from 1 July 2009, this is one of the improvements that Australians can expect to receive.</p>
