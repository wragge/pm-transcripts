NATIONAL BROADCAST AND PRESS CONFERENCE<br />
ON DARWIN DISASTER, SYDNEY, 30 DECEMBER 1974<br />
PRIME MINISTER:...... will have the responsibility for looking<br />
after-the people of Darwin, most of whom, of course, have been<br />
now evacuated from the city. And the Minister for the<br />
Northern Territory, Dr. Rex Patterson, will have prime responsibility<br />
for the reconstruction of the city. As you know, it<br />
had already been decided that there should be a payment of<br />
special benefits to families which were evacuated from Darwin<br />
for the two weeks after they left, that there should be free<br />
accommodation in hostels for those few weeks. We have now<br />
decided that the special benefits, $ 31.00 per week and $ 5.50<br />
per child will also be paid for the first two weeks also<br />
free of means test for the wives and children who have remained<br />
in Darwin and we have also decided that special benefits will be<br />
paid for women who have been evacuated for Darwin after the<br />
first two weeks for a further month. Mr. Hayden will be<br />
responsible for the general question of the movement, and<br />
the return of the evacuees and former residents. As you know<br />
the Government has undertaken the expense of evacuation and will<br />
undertake the expense for return. And Mr. Hayden will look<br />
aftex the we! lfare of the evacuees and the former cititens<br />
while they are still away from Darwin.<br />
To deal with the reconstruction of the city, its been<br />
essential to create some new structure. The existing<br />
Departments and instrumentalities, both those which are<br />
Federal Departments and instrumentalities and those which were<br />
set up in the Territory itself, are obviously unable to cope<br />
with the new situation, the most serious natural disaster ev. cr<br />
to strick Australia. We have decided to establ. sc a Par-,: 1n<br />
Reconstruction Commission, It will be composed of representatives,<br />
of the Department of the Northern Territory, of Urban and<br />
Regional Development and Housing and Construction, of nominees<br />
of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly and the<br />
Darwin City Council and there will be a Chairman, I~ m very<br />
happy and proud to announce that Sir Leslie Thiess has accepted<br />
the Chairmanship of the Commission. It will be established by<br />
Statute as soon as the Parliament reassembles on the 11<br />
February. We would hope for the co-operation of both sides of </p>
<p>-2-<br />
in seeing that the legislation is passed promptly. It will<br />
be essential that the legislation take effect early, so that<br />
plans and performance can go ahead for the new city without<br />
any delay at all. We are appointing the members of the<br />
Commission as an interim commission forethwith. Dr. Patterson<br />
is in~ touch this afternoon with both the Legislative Assembly<br />
and the City Council asking them to appoint their nominees<br />
the Ministers concerned, Dr. Patterson himself, Mr. Uren,<br />
Mr. Johnson, are appointing the nominees of their Departments<br />
forthwith. and Sir Leslie Thiess has accepted as I have mentioned<br />
to you, the appointment. He is one of Australia's great<br />
achievers. You remember when a quarter of a century ago the<br />
Snowy Mountains Hydro-Electric Authority was established,<br />
the only people who were able to fulfill the contracts which<br />
the Authority was le~ tting were overseas companies, Americans,<br />
British, French, Norweigen, and consortions of such companies.<br />
And at last Sir Leslie Thiess, in that world-wide competition<br />
secured contracts and carried out some of the largest of the<br />
operations on the Snowy. He has, of course, been a pioneer,<br />
in the North, in very many areas, discovering, developing the<br />
natural resources of our country. He's harness skilled from<br />
all around the world, he has lead consortions of Australian as<br />
well as overseas companied in that respect. I believe that<br />
there is no man in Australia who would be better fitted to<br />
bring together the whole strain of Departmental and representative<br />
people who will be involved in reconstructing this city,<br />
planning-and achieving this new gateway to Australia. * And he is<br />
a very great man in the engineering and the management field<br />
and a man who has the respect of everybody in Australia and<br />
particularly in the North. He's done very many great things in<br />
his life. This will be one of the greatest.<br />
Now until the Act is passed. early next month, the<br />
interim Commission can be advisory only, but nevertheless, we<br />
expect that all the bodies concerned, the National and the<br />
Territories instrumentalities and Departments will co-operated<br />
with getting the plans underway very quickly indeed. </p>
<p>-3-<br />
It will be necessary of course to have regard to<br />
, the whole use of the land in the Darwin metropolitan area.<br />
The Commission will have in its Charter the best use that<br />
can b6 made of the land of the public buildings, which in<br />
general are still standing, in sound condition, and also<br />
the type of new domestic construction which is required.<br />
It's too glib to say, as some people have, that the houses<br />
in Darwin were gerry-built. They wereno more gerry-built<br />
than the houses in any other Australian capital. Unfortunately<br />
however they were not appropriate to a cyclonic coast and<br />
so therefore we rely on the experience of many authorities<br />
as the CSIRO building research unit, there is the faculty<br />
of engineering in the James Cook University,* and there aremany<br />
professional organisations which have offered their<br />
services in planning the new Darwin, to see that it is a<br />
place where people can go back and resume their lives with<br />
confidence. The Commission, the Reconstruction Commission, the<br />
Darwin Reconstruction Commission, we expect will be established<br />
for a period of five years. We want to give confidence to<br />
* people who have lived in Darwin and-to those who are iminded<br />
* to work-and live there, that this job will be seen throughto<br />
completion, but we also want to give confidence that. we<br />
expect the job will be able to be fully and satisfactorily and<br />
6o~ undily achieved within a reasonable space of time.<br />
There has been a very great deal-of public support<br />
for vairious appeals. The Australian Government will naturally<br />
accepL its proper responsibility in rehabilitation of the<br />
families and reconstruction of the structures. Fortunately<br />
most of them were insured. They were covered by normal insurance<br />
policies, by contrast with the situation at the time of the<br />
Brisbane floods, whe'n mozt of tfi. private structures were not<br />
covered by insurance. There have been a very great number of<br />
contributions, Lord Mayors, Premiers appeals and the whole<br />
range of charitable, voluntary organisations * in Australia. </p>
<p>-4-<br />
I should imagine that there has never been an appeal which<br />
has drawn supportfrom so many regions in Australia as well<br />
as the whole garnet of voluntary organisation. To give<br />
the first instance which came to my notice between midday<br />
on Thursday and 11 p. m. on Friday, the citizens of Alice<br />
Springs, about 13,000 in number contributed $ 105,000 in a<br />
radio appeal. If that is repeated throughout Australia<br />
then the people of Darwin will know directly and promptly<br />
the feelings that their fellow citizens throughout the<br />
nation have for their plight. The Minister for Northern<br />
Territory, Dr. Patterson has been asked to co-ordinate the<br />
various appeals. There are many foreign countries which<br />
have contributed, some European, large nations, some quite small<br />
African nations. Throughout our neighborhood, all the island<br />
states in the Indian ocean and the South Pacific have sent us<br />
messages. Now the Cabinet was particularly wanting to place on<br />
record its appreciation of the Natural Disasters Organisation<br />
under Major-General Alan Stretton. He's a major-General,<br />
because hes career hitherto has been in the Armed Forces, but<br />
he is Ddrwin'in a civilian capacity. There is not martial<br />
law in Darwin, the whole of the organisation in that city has,,<br />
been on civilian lines but the authority is exercised by civilian<br />
police and all the citizens of Darwin who remain there have<br />
contributed towards the rehabilitation of families the<br />
reconstruction of the city. It's a great civilian effQrt.<br />
Now the Natural Disasters Organisation was only authorised<br />
last February. It came into operation on the 21 October. This<br />
is been it's baptisimal fire, and I believe that all Australians<br />
can be proud indeed of the way that this organisation under the<br />
Director-General, Major-General Stretton has responded. This<br />
disaster happened on Christman Day in the most remote part of<br />
Australia and relief was under way in record. time. Over 7,000<br />
people were evacuated by air alone at the height of the<br />
evacuation exercise and we want to place on record the<br />
improvisation, the tireless efforts of the Armed Forces and of the<br />
airlines, Qantas, Ansett and TAA have never carried so many<br />
people in such difficult conditions. And many of you will have<br />
seen, as : I did at Mascot, and at Adelaid, the way they were </p>
<p>received on arrival by Government Departments and by the<br />
whole range of volunteer organisations. So the Cabinet<br />
wanted to record its appreciation which we believe is<br />
shared by the whole Australian people, at the performance in<br />
extraordinarily remote difficult conditions of Australia's<br />
newly established Natural Disasters Organisation.<br />
Are there any questions you wish to ask me about the<br />
Darwin situation?<br />
QUESTION: Yourvisit to the airport yesterday was obviously<br />
well recieved. And provided comfort to the refugees who were<br />
there. In view of the fact don't you think that in time of<br />
distress your continued presence in Australia would. be moreappreciated<br />
by the-refugees and Australians-generally than a<br />
return to Europe?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No I do not. I've told you the Ministers<br />
who will have prime responsibility in these matters. I have<br />
committments on behalf of the nation with seven governments<br />
in Europe and two in Asia. Obviously I should honour those<br />
conmmittments. The arrangments have now been made for<br />
Australia and the evacuees from Darwin by air have nearly all"<br />
arrived now. They' re in good hands.<br />
QUESTION: Could not your Foreign Minister handly that work<br />
equally as well?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: As I have said before there are many things<br />
that can only-be done at the level of Head of Government, that<br />
is understood in every other country, it should be understood<br />
in Australia.<br />
QUESTION: Prime Minister, are you aware that there has been<br />
some breakdown in the services and the handling of people when<br />
they have actually been arriving in places like . Sydney, for<br />
instance, baggage has come in unlabled, there's been a suff it<br />
of funds which has be en operating, in fact overlaping one another,<br />
we' ye also had the situation of too many goods being demanded and<br />
accommodation probably knocked back by people who were originally </p>
<p>-6-<br />
prepared to offer it. Do you think in the light of that there<br />
. should be some sort of post mortem in the operation, not from<br />
Darwin where it seems to have been excellent, but in the<br />
capital cities themselves?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:* I believe your questions would give a completly<br />
wrong impression. I saw hundreds of people in. Sydney, at<br />
Mascot yesterday, I saw many scores, some hundreds at Adelaide<br />
on Saturday night and my impression was that the people<br />
waiting for relatives and friends and the people who were<br />
arriving were very pleased indeed with the arrangements which<br />
had been made by the airlines, by the Departments and by the<br />
Civil Voluntary Organisations. it was a remarkably effective<br />
effort at co-ordination.<br />
QUESTION: Prime Minister, Sir has it been determined yet whether<br />
Darwin will be built in situe or, making use of existing<br />
infra structure or will the town be built elsewhere. Will some<br />
of the northern suburbs be bulldozed as Dr. Patterson is<br />
reported to have suggested. Have any important decisions along<br />
these lines been decided yet?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: In general terms Darwin will be reconstructured<br />
where it i's. The particular places where installations or<br />
suburbs will be built or rebuilt iill of course be left to the'<br />
Darwin Reconstruction Commission. There is a very valuable<br />
infra structure in Darwin. The public buildings are basically<br />
quite sound, they can be restored quite promptly. It still<br />
has to be ascertained how many people will want to live in<br />
Darwiin and also it has to be ascertained in what areas they can<br />
be most appropriately housed. So in general terms Darwin will<br />
be reconstructured where it is. After all it is a big port, it<br />
is a big airport and everywhere in the tropics people like to<br />
live on the coast. It's true that you don't get cyclones 100<br />
kilometres from the coast, but people don't like the climate<br />
100 kilometres from the coast. So Darwin, as a general area<br />
will be reconstructured. No question about thAt, but of course<br />
I wouldn't I specify which suburbs will be rebuilt or which<br />
new suburbs would be built. That will be decided, 1 ~ u2hupe<br />
after proper consideration by this representative Reconstruction </p>
<p>-7-<br />
Commission which we're establishing within the next couple of<br />
days in an interim form and which I hope will become a<br />
Statutory body in the middle of February.<br />
QUESTION: Prime Minister, quite apart from the location of<br />
Darwin, will the decision on what kind of city Darwin will<br />
be in the future, be a matter for the Government or for this<br />
newly constituted authority?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well, it will be finally of course to the<br />
Government like all these decisions, but it will be on the<br />
advice, after investigation and report by the Darwin<br />
Reconstruction Commission.<br />
QUESTION: Will any attempt be made to repopulate Darwin t o the<br />
extent that it was prior to the cylcone, Does the Government<br />
regard the population of Darwin previously to have been adequate<br />
in excess,-or what size.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well, this is a matter for people themselves<br />
to decide.. Nobody can be made to leave Darwin or to go to Darwin<br />
3or to go back to Darwin, That is for people themselves to<br />
decide. one of the things I would imagine to be ascertained<br />
is how many of the people who have left Darwin want to go back.<br />
I found some yesterday quite determed to go back they love<br />
the place. There are others who, somewhat fewer in number it<br />
seemed to me, who would not go back.<br />
QUESTION: One of the persons who I talked to in Darwin who<br />
was sticking with his house, said that he didn't want to leave<br />
until such time as he was assured or had some information that<br />
the Government and his insurance company would help him rebuild<br />
it. The insurance companies, we were told in Darwin yesterday,<br />
have agreed that they're going to pay out on these claims<br />
on the normal claims, but have you had any information as to<br />
whether they are under strain in meeting the size of the claims<br />
that will be made from Darwin, the insurance companies that is?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I have no doubt whatever that-the insurance<br />
companie will honour the contracts which householders and </p>
<p>-8-<br />
business people have with them. I would also expect that all-<br />
' the insurance companies would be in a financial position to<br />
meet the claims. After all within the last year the Government<br />
has passed legislation guaranteeing the soundness of insurance<br />
such as there has been for the last 30 years, guaranteeing the<br />
soundness of banks. So that nobody should be in any doubt that<br />
hisinsurance company will honour the claim. The Minister for<br />
Repatriation and Compensation. Senator Wheeldon is investigating<br />
the whole of this matter. It i's of interest, of course,<br />
that in Darwin there were a very great number of people who<br />
were injured who under the law as it stands, including all the<br />
forms of compulsory insurance that there are inAustralia for<br />
third-party insurance on the roads, or workers compensation<br />
insurance in shops and factories, all those people that in<br />
Darwin wouldn't have been covered thatway,. this was a natural<br />
disaster. Senator Wheeldon says you can't sue a cyclone,<br />
but under the legislation which he's introduced in the Senate<br />
it's gone through the House of Representatives already as you<br />
know, the National Compensation Bill, anybody who is injured<br />
in Darwin, for any cause whatever would be assured of a proper<br />
income as long as he remained injured. This is a very clear<br />
example of the necessity of having a National Compensation<br />
Scheme. QUESTION; Did Cabinet receive an estimate of the total cost of<br />
Government assistance to Darwin.<br />
PRIME MINISTER : No none whatever, there will two Bills brought<br />
before Parliament when it meets on the 11 February. One will be<br />
to-establishthis Darwin Reconstruction Commission. The other<br />
will be to made a special appropriation for all the expenses<br />
of one kind or another for the remainder bf this financial year<br />
for Darwin. and some of these matters will be expenses for<br />
personal propoerty, some will be for social service payments,<br />
as many of these payments are being made on more generous<br />
conditions that apply at the moment, without means tests, and<br />
so on. And all the matters which the Government will have to<br />
finance will be in that appropriation Bill and I would expect<br />
that within the four weeks the Cabinet we'll be having thenA,<br />
all those amounts will be quantified for the remainder of this </p>
<p>-9-<br />
financial year. So there was not an estimate made today<br />
-but arrangements were made for the estimates all to be in<br />
hand within four weeks. and there will be an appropriation<br />
Bill Introduced to meet all those expenses.<br />
QUESTION; Will the people of Darwin be allowed to go back and<br />
rebuild as soon as they feel they are able to, or will they<br />
need prior permission from the Reconstruction Authority?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: The Reconstruction Commission will clearly<br />
have the responsbility where it is best to have houses, what<br />
sort of houses. It would be quite irresponsible to allow<br />
people to build houses of the type which didn't withstand the<br />
cyclone and it would be no comfort to some people to rebuild<br />
in areas which may be developed for other purposes. Clearly<br />
the whole question of the use of land is one of the things<br />
which will have to be scrutinised and determinied much more<br />
carefully than in the past.<br />
QUESTION; Will that include the timetable for the people<br />
to be allowed back into the area?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I'm only concerned with where the houses wo~ ild<br />
be built. After all nobody can be prevented from going anywhere<br />
in Australia. Nobody can be compelled to go anywhere in Australia.<br />
There are at the moment-, for the next week or so, some<br />
limitati ons on movrement into Darwin because theairfield can't take<br />
all the movements required of it. Incidentally, I should have<br />
mentioned to you that Major-General Stretton and the Natural<br />
Disasters Organisation will hand over their responsibilities on<br />
Thursday. The Governor-General will be up there at that time<br />
I expect and the Department of the Northern Territory will<br />
resume its normal role in administering the city.<br />
QUESTION; Are you aware that politics has entered into this<br />
situation with your Minister for the Media, Senator McClelland<br />
refusing to co-operate in helping TV commercial networks get<br />
film back to Sydney, becau . se quote" They opposed! his change of<br />
Media control in the Senate" </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER: I don't believe this. I brought some films<br />
back yesterday, the previous night, on Saturday night, for<br />
various commercial things and Senator McClelland was<br />
up there, and so also was the Head of his Department and the<br />
head of the ABC. I don't appreciate aspertions being made<br />
about my Ministers like this. I have no reason to believe<br />
th allogation you make has any foundation whatever.<br />
QUESTION; Does the answer to the question before the last,<br />
about the appropriation this year, mean the the Government<br />
intends to finance the rehabilitation of Darwin without<br />
cutting back other programmes?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: At this stage welfare payments, I wouldn't<br />
think there's any justrification for cutting back on<br />
expenditure. After all no expenditures were cut back on the<br />
Queensland floods. There may later clearly have to be some<br />
postponement of other structural expenditure, for instance<br />
there's a limited number of town planners available and one<br />
then has to determine the priority for their services. But<br />
the immediate matters, the matters which I was stating would<br />
be in thz Appropriation Bill introduced on 11 Februrary are<br />
of the welfare character. Now just because you have to make<br />
unexpected payments to people who have to be evacuated from<br />
Darwin or who are homeless in Darwin, is no excuse clearly for<br />
reducing welfare payments for which Parliament has already<br />
made provision.<br />
QUESTION: Mr. Prime Minister, at a different political level<br />
from the one raised earlier, to what extent do the Government's<br />
plans to reconstruct Darwin and rehabilitate its citizens<br />
depend upon the aquiscence of the Opposition on matters such<br />
as Senator Wheeldon's Compensation Bill, the establishment of<br />
-it1!. rities etc.' Have you been in touch with Mr. Snedden and<br />
Senator Withers for instance? Have they indicated that they are<br />
quite wLiling to go ahead with...<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I don't believe that either have expressed a<br />
view about the National Compensation Bill. I won't assume<br />
they';; ,-oe IL. It's been referred unamimously by the<br />
J I t r </p>
<p>-11<br />
Senate to a Senate Conmmittee I think the arguments for the<br />
National Compensation Bill are overwhelming, not the least<br />
of the arguments is the fact that so many people as the law<br />
stands now everywhere in Australia have no compensation<br />
at all for injuries which they suffer in events such as this.<br />
Now if the Bill was already in then people would be entitled<br />
to this compensation forethwith, you wouldn't have to make any<br />
special provision whatever.<br />
QUESTION: Surely it's going to take some time for the Darwin<br />
Reconstruction Commission to get down to the nitty-gritty of<br />
actually building houses. What temporary arrangements are you<br />
making for accommodation for the people who want to stay in<br />
Darwin? PRIME MINISTER: There are some buildingsthere such as motels<br />
which can be fairly quickly habitable. But I would think that<br />
this Commission will produce results as quickly as is possible<br />
to do so. There are a great number of people who have to<br />
contribute to its deliberations and Sir Leslie Thiess will get<br />
them working together quickly and effectively. </p>
