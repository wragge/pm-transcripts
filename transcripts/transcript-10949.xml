<p>Ladies and gentlemen, it's an enormous delight for me to be here</p>
<p> tonight. And as I watched the names and I saw the people who comprise</p>
<p> the Australian Hall of Fame tonight it was really a fast-forward of</p>
<p> my years and years of watching sport and being excited and inspired</p>
<p> and entertained by the achievements of the men and women of Australian</p>
<p> sport.</p>
<p>I comprise the great bulk of Australian sports lovers. The performance</p>
<p> of people here tonight who are part of the Hall of Fame could only</p>
<p> ever be in our dreams. But we have shared their lives. We have shared</p>
<p> their achievements. For me sport has always been a very important</p>
<p> part of my life and a very important part of our country.</p>
<p>Sport binds Australians together like nothing else. Sport inspires</p>
<p> Australians like nothing else. And the achievements of our men and</p>
<p> women in sport are part of the Australian achievement and a part of</p>
<p> the Australian legend.</p>
<p>My earliest recollections of sport, of course, as a boy growing up</p>
<p> in Sydney, surrounded by names in cricket like Ray Lindwall and Keith</p>
<p> Miller - I saw the great Sir Donald play but once in his last appearance</p>
<p> at the Sydney Cricket Ground - Frank Sedgman and Ken McGregor in tennis,</p>
<p> as a resident of Sydney and a follower of rugby league, Clive Churchill,</p>
<p> the great little master who played for South Sydney. And so the list</p>
<p> goes on. And all through my life sport has been a very important part.</p>
<p>But to all of us sport is something that brings out what we think</p>
<p> are the best qualities about being an Australian. They are qualities</p>
<p> of commitment. They are qualities of loyalty. They are qualities of</p>
<p> mateship and they are qualities of achievement. There's nothing</p>
<p> that excites Australians quite so much as the thrill of a sporting</p>
<p> contest and the thrill of an Australian victory and an Australian</p>
<p> achievement.</p>
<p>We could spend all night recalling the great moments that we have</p>
<p> shared in sport, the exaltation that we have enjoyed about the achievement</p>
<p> of individual men and women in sport representing our country. And</p>
<p> the feat seems to go on and it seems to get better. We had the wonderful</p>
<p> experience of Atlanta. We've had the wonderful experience of</p>
<p> the Commonwealth Games at Kuala Lumpur. We're at the beginning</p>
<p> of a marvellous Ashes tour. We've just had, of course, marvellous</p>
<p> grand finals in Australian Rules and rugby league. We've just</p>
<p> had a great Wallabies success in defeating the French. And so the</p>
<p> list goes on. And, of course, here in the city of Melbourne, which</p>
<p> Greg Norman tells me has the best golf courses in the world, Australia</p>
<p> is going to host the President's Cup in a few weeks time.</p>
<p>And it is appropriate that this gathering here tonight should be in</p>
<p> the city of Melbourne. I don't know a city in the world that</p>
<p> does its sports men and women as proudly as does the city of Melbourne.</p>
<p> And the facilities here and the great sporting arena of the Melbourne</p>
<p> Cricket Ground and of Flemington Racecourse and of so many other of</p>
<p> the great facilities here are a reminder of just how we honour and</p>
<p> revere our sports men and women and our achievements.</p>
<p>But, ladies and gentlemen, tonight is an opportunity to honour the</p>
<p> men and women of Australian sport. It's an opportunity to recall</p>
<p> the achievements of our past greats. It's an opportunity to honour</p>
<p> our current achievements. It's an opportunity to celebrate the</p>
<p> tradition of Australian sport and all that it has meant to us and</p>
<p> all that it continues to mean to our nation. The way in which it brings</p>
<p> us together, it dissolves the barriers of politics and the barriers</p>
<p> of different backgrounds and unites us all in entertainment, in achieving,</p>
<p> in excelling and, above all, that great thrill we always get when</p>
<p> an Australian succeeds, an Australian is a world champion or an Australian</p>
<p> team wins the match or the contest.</p>
<p>On behalf of your fellow Australians can I say to all of those great</p>
<p> sports men and women of Australia, and every sporting discipline is</p>
<p> represented here tonight, thank you for the enjoyment you've</p>
<p> given to us. Thank you for the inspiration you continue to be to the</p>
<p> young of Australia. And thank you for living out the Australian dream</p>
<p> and the Australian ideal in such a magnificent way. Thank you.</p>
