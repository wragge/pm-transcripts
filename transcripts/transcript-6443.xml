    <content><![CDATA[<p>Statement by the Prime Minister </p>
<p>Letters Patent Relating to the Office of Governor-General. </p>
<p>In October 1900 the Queen issued Letters Patent and royal instructions relating to the Office of Governor-General in anticipation of the creation of the Commonwealth of Australia on 1 January, 1901. </p>
<p>In recent years, there has been a growing recognition that the Letters Patent no longer made adequate provision in the light of modern Australian needs. More importantly, the then solicitor-general, in 1975, advised that, having regard to the express terms of the Constitution relating to the Governor-General and the course of Australia's Constitutional development since Federation, no place remained for the instructions to the Governor-General. </p>
<p>The solicitor-general's advice made it plain that the only proper course was for the instructions to be revoked. Work was therefore begun on a revision of the Letters Patent to bring that document into line with modern needs, incorporating any provision from the instructions that was appropriate. </p>
<p>The work was begun under the previous labor government. It continued almost to completion under the Fraser government, and has now been brought to finality by this government. Her Majesty the Queen of Australia, acting on my advice as her Prime Minister, made new Letters Patent on 21 august 1984 relating to the Office of Governor-General. </p>
<p>The title of the new Letters Patent reflects two things. The Letters Patent issued in 1900 purported to constitute-the Office of Governor-General and Commander-in-Chief in and over the Commonwealth of Australia. However, the Office of Governor-General is constituted by section 2 of the Constitution and does not need the support of Letters Patent for its existence. Also, the title Commander-in-chief in and over the Commonwealth is not supported by the 'Constitution. </p>
<p>While section 68 vests a function of command in the Governor-General in relation to the naval and military forces of the Commonwealth, that function may only be exercised on advice, and in any event does not create the status of Commander-in-Chief in and over the Commonwealth. While the new style and title of the Governor-General will therefore not include such a reference, the Governor-General will continue to use the title adopted in recent years of "Commander-in-Chief of the Defence Force" for ceremonial purposes connected with the armed forces. </p>
<p>The new Letters Patent extend the provision for the appointment of administrators to take account of the realities of life in the late 20th century. The former Letters Patent were silent as to the person or persons who might request the holder of a dormant Commission from the Queen to assume the administration of the Government. This had to be gleaned from the dormant Commissions themselves. The new Letters Patent do not attempt to change the circumstances in which an administrator may act; they do, however, extend the category of persons who may make the necessary request. Previously, that function was confined by the dormant Commissions to the Governor-General and the Prime Minister, but the new document makes provision for the situation where neither of them is available to make a request. In addition, it will no longer be necessary for an administrator, on every occasion on which he assumes office, to take the Oaths of Allegiance and Office.<br />
The oaths will be administered only on the first assumption of office, thus greatly simplifying the arrangements required when the services of an administrator are needed. </p>
<p>While the Royal Instructions of 1900 required that the commissions of Governors-General should be published, they did not specify the means of publication. By comparison, the new Letters Patent require that the Letters Patent themselves, the Commissions of Governors-General and Administrators and Instruments of Appointment of deputies be published in the Commonwealth Gazette. This new provision is consistent with current attitudes regarding access to official information, particularly in relation to key Constitutional documents. </p>
<p>I believe honourable members will agree that the new Letters Patent achieve the objective of modernising the administrative arrangements of the Office of Governor-General and, at the same time, clarify His Excellency's position under the Constitution. I would emphasize that the new Letters Patent do not in any way affect the position of Her Majesty as Queen of Australia or diminish in any way the Constitutional powers of the Governor-General. </p>
<p>Finally, I can assure honourable members and the citizens of Australia that the Letters Patent recently issued by Her Majesty on my advice do not represent a step in the direction of a republic. They recognize Australia's independent status, and they do so in a manner entirely consistent with the continuing role of Her Majesty as Queen  of Australia. </p>
