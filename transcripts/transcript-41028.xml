    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Turnbull Government is throwing the full might of the Australian Federal Police’s forensic and intelligence capabilities behind efforts to stop gang-related violence in Victoria.</p>
<p>Victorians, like all Australians, deserve to feel safe to go about their daily lives without fear or intimidation. Plainly, the status quo is not enough.</p>
<p>These street gangs and criminals rely heavily on the illegal drug trade to make a profit, with no regard for the pain and damage they leave in their wake.</p>
<p>To crack down on these violent gangs, the Australian Federal Police (AFP) will now provide Victoria Police with additional assistance in the fight against street crime.</p>
<p>This is part of the Coalition Government’s additional $321.4 million investment in the AFP that we announced in this year’s Budget, the largest single funding increase for the AFP’s domestic policing capabilities in more than a decade.</p>
<p>This funding will unlock greater access for Victoria Police to the AFP’s world-leading forensic, intelligence and high-tech crime fighting capabilities and expertise.</p>
<p>Together, Victoria Police and the AFP will be able to identify, catch and prosecute these violent criminals faster than ever before.  It includes measures such as:</p>
<ul><li>A dedicated AFP out-posted intelligence officer to support Victorian anti-gang investigations;</li>
<li>Advanced forensic examination capabilities and criminal intelligence mapping to support investigations; and</li>
<li>Direct access to the AFP’s National Forensic Rapid Lab to fast-track evidence collection and analysis to better target criminal gangs.</li>
</ul><p>The Prime Minister, the Hon Malcolm Turnbull MP, and Justice Minister The Hon Michael Keenan made the announcement during a visit to AFP headquarters in Melbourne.</p>
<p>This will work hand-in-hand with the multi-agency National Anti-Gangs Squad, which received $3 million in additional Federal funding last year to allow them to continue their work until June 2019.</p>
<p>This investment will assist police to track down and arrest violent offenders and disrupt their criminal behaviour.</p>
<p>The Coalition Government will not waver in the fight to protect our nation and our way of life.</p>
