CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
INTERNATIONAL METALWORKERS' FEDERATION<br />
ASIAN REGIONAL CONFERENCE<br />
SYDNEY 25 JANUARY 1989<br />
It is a pleasure indeed to address the Asian Regional<br />
Conference of the International Metalworkers' Federation and<br />
to welcome its delegates to Australia.<br />
You are welcome for many reasons.<br />
The international trade union movement of which you are a<br />
significant part has played a leading role in protecting and<br />
advancing the interests of the men and women who make up the<br />
workforce of the global economy.<br />
In our region, trade unionism has been an important force<br />
for decency and the equitable sharing of the fruits of our<br />
massive economic growth. No doubt one of the challenges you<br />
will be discussing is ensuring trade unions in the region<br />
keep pace with the economic growth.<br />
Internationally the trade union movement has been at the<br />
forefront of many of the crucial struggles being waged for<br />
human rights and the rights of trade unionism including,<br />
not least, in Poland and South Africa.<br />
Fortunately, Australia does not have to tackle domestically<br />
the question of fundamental human and trade union rights.<br />
Our most pressing concerns have been economic issues.<br />
Within Australia, at a time of unique pressures on the<br />
Australian economy, the trade union movement has been an<br />
essential partner of the Government I lead in equipping the<br />
Australian economy for the future.<br />
As a result of this intimate partnership, Australia is<br />
better able to face the challenges of competing efficiently<br />
on the world's markets. In particular, the partnership has<br />
created job opportunities for almost one and a quarter<br />
million Australians who would otherwise be unemployed. </p>
<p>Australia has a rich trade union heritage. Australian<br />
workers in the middle of the last century created one of the<br />
first, and one of the most successful, trade union movements<br />
in the world. Among its early pioneering achievements in<br />
improving the wages and conditions of Australian workers was<br />
the famous landmark victory, won in this city and in<br />
Melbourne, of the eight hour day.<br />
During the 1890s, an era when the Australian economy saw<br />
boom and bust, strike and lockout, Australian workers made<br />
the historic decision to advance their goals through<br />
political as well as industrial means. And so they founded<br />
one of the world's first labour parties the Australian<br />
Labor Party.<br />
It is as leader of that Party, as a proud and committed<br />
trade unionist, and as Prime minister of my country that I<br />
welcome you to this country and to this city. I am sure<br />
that you will find in Australia a positive and constructive<br />
atmosphere for the deliberations you will be undertaking.<br />
My friends,<br />
You are meeting at a time of great change in the Australian<br />
economy and in the economies of our region.<br />
The significance of the Asian-Pacific economies for world<br />
economic growth has become a well known international theme.<br />
This is hardly surprising given that the region accounts for<br />
around 40 per cent of world output, some 35 per cent of<br />
the world's exports, and is home for some 15 per cent of our<br />
planet's population. Those figures exclude China, and of<br />
course the transformation underway in that vast country<br />
offers even greater opportunities for growth in the future.<br />
In recent years, economic growth in a number of<br />
Asian-Pacific countries has grown some two to three times<br />
faster than the average for OECD countries.<br />
Trans-Atlantic trade has now been outstripped by the<br />
movement of goods and services around the Asian-Pacific<br />
region.<br />
The economic importance of the region for Australia has long<br />
been apparent although it is true to say that for many<br />
years we were simply not equipped to take advantage of the<br />
opportunities that lay before us.<br />
Indeed, when my Government came to office in 1983, we<br />
inherited an economic crisis that was, in large part, the<br />
result of a failure to equip ourselves to compete in the<br />
world's markets, we had developed neither the flexible<br />
institutions and industries, nor the outward looking<br />
attitudes that are necessary if we are to contribute<br />
competitively to the economic dynamism of the region. </p>
<p>We had become accustomed to our over-valued and unresponsive<br />
exchange rate; our antiquated financial system; an<br />
over-protected and inward looking manufacturing sector; a<br />
wages system which perpetuated inflationary pressures; an<br />
industrial relations system locked into expensive and futile<br />
confrontation; and an education system failing to meet the<br />
needs of our most potentially productive workers.<br />
Today, Australians can look back on more than half a decade<br />
of systematic reform in each of these areas. We have<br />
floated the dollar, deregulated the financial system, cut<br />
protection, addressed the needs of some industries directly<br />
with industry plans, created a new era of industrial<br />
relations co-operation and are fundamentally reforming the<br />
education and training system.<br />
I do not recite these facts to pat myself or my Government<br />
on the back or for that matter to try to pretend that the<br />
reform process is complete.<br />
My purpose today is not to list the end products of our<br />
reform program but rather to discuss the equally important<br />
and, for an international trade union audience, the more<br />
relevant methods we have adopted to achieve those goals.<br />
Most fundamentally, I want to show what can be achieved when<br />
Governments and trade unions work together in the interests<br />
of all their constituents and members.<br />
For I believe the methods and procedures we have pioneered<br />
in Australia serve as a distinguished international model in<br />
these times of economic uncertainty.<br />
The principal element of our strategy for economic reform<br />
and reconstruction has been the Prices and Incomes Accord<br />
which was agreed between the Australian Council of Trade<br />
Unions and the then Labor Party Opposition prior to the 1983<br />
elections. The Accord was based on the realisation by both the union<br />
movement and the Labor Party that the economic problems<br />
facing the nation could not be solved in the old ways of<br />
confrontation and division but required instead a concerted<br />
effort to build a new and productive national consensus.<br />
We have been able to act upon the great truth of industrial<br />
relations and, indeed, of economic management in general.<br />
Where sectional interests are pursued, sectional gains may<br />
result. But whatever these gains, they will be fewer than<br />
the gains that flow from a consensus approach where national<br />
priorities are set and pursued on a co-operative basis.<br />
The Accord has allowed us to embark on a strategy which has<br />
produced economic achievements of fundamental and lasting<br />
importance not only to trade unionists but to all<br />
Australians. </p>
<p>Nowhere is this better illustrated than in our record of job<br />
creation. More than 1.2 million jobs have been created in<br />
the Australian economy between April 1983 and December 1988.<br />
This is a rate of job growth about twice the OECD average.<br />
This tremendous achievement was the direct result of the<br />
conscious decision by the trade union movement, through the<br />
Accord, to accept wage restraint.<br />
It would have been easy for trade unions in 1983, faced with<br />
the crisis of recession, vanishing job opportunities, bleak<br />
investment prospects and confrontationist industrial<br />
relations policies, to have pursued their traditional<br />
priority of assisting its employed members through campaigns<br />
for wage increases.<br />
But it is to their lasting credit that they eschewed that<br />
traditional, but in that case profoundly inappropriate,<br />
policy and instead applied themselves to the essential<br />
national task of increasing economic competitiveness and<br />
creating new jobs for those without them.<br />
This has been achieved while industrial confrontation, which<br />
under the previous Government caused so much bitterness at<br />
home and so much damage to our reputation abroad, has fallen<br />
by nearly 60 per cent.<br />
At the same time, an integral part of the Accord was the<br />
recognition that real wage restraint should be compensated<br />
through real increases in the social wage. My Government is<br />
proud that its social justice record is second to none.<br />
Through major increases in Government assistance for low<br />
income families, real increases in pensions and benefits,<br />
reforms of the education system, the restoration and<br />
improvement of Medibank, and assistance for first home<br />
buyers, we have significantly eased the burden of restraint<br />
on those who are most in need in our community.<br />
Underpinning all this have been our reforms of the taxation<br />
system, which have ensured that those who benefit from the<br />
returns to capital pay their fair share of the tax burden,<br />
and that other forms of non-wage income no longer escape<br />
taxation. As a consequence, we have been able to reduce<br />
taxation for ordinary wage and salary earners. Over the<br />
next couple of months we will be negotiating, with the trade<br />
union movement, a wage/ tax trade off which will deliver<br />
substantial tax relief targetted in the first instance to<br />
low and middle income earners.<br />
Let me add a further point that is too often overlooked,<br />
especially by our political opponents. Real wages have<br />
fallen, causing job growth, dampening inflation andcFoosting<br />
our international competitiveness. But real disposable<br />
income has risen indeed it has risen by 6.7 per cent per<br />
head since T Ãµ TTT This has come about mainly because many<br />
more people have jobs, and benefit levels have increased. </p>
<p>In other words, the Accord has ensured that where sacrifices<br />
have been necessary, they have been shared equitably, and<br />
when, as has inevitably happened, those sacrifices have<br />
borne fruit, their benefits have been shared equitably.<br />
Constructive government-union relations in Australia are now<br />
a fact of life. They are an essential element of a wider<br />
network of nation-wide consultations involving business and<br />
community groups which are essential to the resolution of<br />
the important issues of economic management.<br />
Such processes have helped create, in Australia, a community<br />
more prepared to accept change, including changes which<br />
sometimes, on the face of it, may seem to run counter to the<br />
immediate interests of some of its members. Where this has<br />
happened, such as in our reductions of industry assistance,<br />
those who are suffering personal loss in the interest of<br />
greater community gain have been compensated.<br />
This consultative approach has laid the foundations for<br />
Australia to undertake the difficult but utterly essential<br />
task of economic reconstruction.<br />
For too long in the easy decades after the Second World War,<br />
Australia was content to earn a relatively high standard of<br />
living through reliance on seemingly limitless production of<br />
those abiding features of the Australian physical and<br />
economic landscape: wool, wheat, meat and minerals.<br />
We did not attempt seriously to diversify our economy into<br />
manufactures and services, preferring to rely instead on<br />
building walls of protection behind which inefficient local<br />
producers could cater for the basic needs of our small<br />
domestic market.<br />
Such policies were called, paradoxically, industry<br />
assistance schemes. In fact of course they provided<br />
anything but assistance to an economy that should have been<br />
trying to compete on world markets instead of shirking the<br />
challenge. Their legacy was a less flexible economy, too reliant on<br />
protection and regulation, too insulated from the dynamism<br />
of the regional and global economies and, as we experienced<br />
in 1985-86, too vulnerable to the fluctuations that bedevil<br />
commoditiy markets.<br />
The creation of a more competitive, self reliant economy<br />
will depend on a commitment, by the whole community, to<br />
reform those policies that impeded adjustment.<br />
While Australia's exports of manufactured goods as a share<br />
of total exports are far below that in world trade<br />
generally, signs abound that the Australian economy is being<br />
successfully restructured. </p>
<p>6.<br />
In our last two completed financial years, 1986-87 and<br />
1987-88, manufactured exports increased by 32.5 per cent and<br />
9.4 per cent, and services exports grew by 9.4 per cent and<br />
13.9 per cent.<br />
Business investment is now growing strongly, recording<br />
13.7 per cent growth in 1987-88, with the 12 per cent growth<br />
expected in new business investment in 1988-9 being<br />
consistent with the latest available ABS investment<br />
expectations data.<br />
Not surprisingly, our domestic political opponents, under<br />
whose administration in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s these<br />
fundamental restructuring problems were ignored or<br />
exacerbated, seek to misrepresent the magnitude of the<br />
changes that are underway.<br />
One particular line of attack of late has been to cite<br />
Australia's allegedly low productivity. Their so called<br />
' labour productivity' figures are derived by simply dividing<br />
the economy's output by the number of employees. But with<br />
Australia's rapid rate of employment growth, we are at last<br />
using our capital stock more extensively. When this<br />
happens, ' labour productivity' is very low, but of course<br />
' capital productivity' is high. There are major<br />
difficulties in accurately measuring capital, so ' capital<br />
productivity' is rarely cited.<br />
Further productivity gains will follow our comprehensive<br />
program of micro-economic reforms.<br />
When you compare the eight years in power of the<br />
conservatives with the achievements in micro reform under<br />
Labor, the hypocrisy of the Oppositions's alleged concern<br />
about productivity becomes even clearer.<br />
Why didn't they deregulate the financial system, lower<br />
tariffs, end the two-airline policy, lessen regulation in<br />
communications, lower crippling marginal tax rates, improve<br />
education retention and free up unnecessary controls on<br />
Government Business Enterprises?<br />
With the same drive that is transforming Australia's<br />
industrial base, the partnership between the Labor<br />
Government, the trade union movement and employers is now<br />
being harnessed to another fundamental task: award<br />
restructuring.<br />
What better proof could be sought that Australians have<br />
indeed learned to work constructively together than their<br />
determination to make a success of award restructuring?<br />
And what better evidence of the advantages of this consensus<br />
approach could be sought than the productivity gains that<br />
will result from this process. </p>
<p>Put simply, award restructuring is a process which, at the<br />
end of the day, will help create a more flexible, better<br />
trained and more appropriately paid workforce.<br />
In the key Metal Industry Award, for example, there are<br />
currently 348 separate classifications of work. This will<br />
be reduced to some eight or nine skill levels. So for the<br />
170,000 workers employed under this award, there will be<br />
established clear career paths that offer the incentive of<br />
promotion, on the basis of relevant, specific and accredited<br />
training in new skills, to employment that is more enriching<br />
both in the sense of job satisfaction and in its literal<br />
meaning of being better remunerated.<br />
In this audience in particular, I pay unqualified tribute to<br />
both the employers and the unions in the metal industry who<br />
have already advanced a long way down the path of<br />
negotiating these changes.<br />
Both the Metal Trades Industry Association and the metal<br />
industry unions have released detailed proposals for a new,<br />
restructured award and it is pleasing to note the<br />
considerable amount of common ground between them.<br />
Their lead is being followed in other industries, giving<br />
real momentum to this crucial task.<br />
Award restructuring is not some fiddle by the so-called<br />
Industrial Relations Club to provide an under-the-counter<br />
pretext for wage increases.<br />
The National Wage Case decision of August last year made<br />
wage increases conditional on fundamental reviews of awards.<br />
It is a fundamental change in the structure and operation of<br />
awards which will yield real increases in productivity.<br />
The increases will in some cases be immediate, and in some<br />
cases take longer. But in all cases they will be enduring.<br />
And in all cases they are being achieved, not through<br />
confrontationist tactics in which everyone is the loser, but<br />
through sensible and constructive negotiations in which<br />
everyone, in the industry and in the economy more generally,<br />
is the winner.<br />
My friends,<br />
I have spoken today largely about the Australian economy and<br />
the vital role of Australian trade unionists in managing our<br />
economy. I am of course proud of that role and I pay unqualified<br />
tribute to the leaders of the Australian trade union<br />
movement for their vision and hard work not only on behalf<br />
of their members, but on behalf of all Australians. </p>
<p>The example of the constructive Government union<br />
relationship in this country provides an instructive case<br />
study for comparable nations that are seeking to improve the<br />
well-being of their citizens through sustainable long term<br />
prosperity. In other words trade unions have the capacity and the<br />
responsibility not only to ensure the equitable sharing of<br />
prosperity within a community but to generate that<br />
prosperity in the first place.<br />
That is why we must never slacken our efforts to see the<br />
spread of free trade unionism throughout the region a<br />
confident, compassionate and effective trade union movement<br />
that can help in the vital international task of building a<br />
safer and a more peaceful world. </p>
