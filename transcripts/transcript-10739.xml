    <content><![CDATA[<p>E&amp;OE....................................................</p>
<p>McCLUSKY: </p>
<p>Here's Prime Minister John Howard. A very good morning to</p>
<p>   you.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Good morning, nice to speak to you.</p>
<p>McCLUSKY:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, can I ask you, your endorsement yesterday of the</p>
<p>   eastern seaboard plan, a lot of people I think in Adelaide have</p>
<p>   seen, not quite as a snub, but perhaps don't understand the</p>
<p>   rationale behind it. What was your rationale for endorsing it?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I think the reaction particularly from the Adelaide Advertiser</p>
<p>   this morning is very strange. That paper and others seem to have</p>
<p>   forgotten that the Federal Government has pledged $100 million to</p>
<p>   support the Darwin to Alice Springs railway. We haven't pledged</p>
<p>   any money to support the inland rail network. That is an entirely</p>
<p>   private sector-sponsored proposal and it's been around for</p>
<p>   quite a long time.</p>
<p>McCLUSKY:</p>
<p>It has.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>It didn't suddenly materialised out of thin air over the last</p>
<p>   few days. In fact the group which includes representatives of people</p>
<p>   who have had both Labor and Coalition affiliations in the past was</p>
<p>   put together several years ago. Ultimately these things will be</p>
<p>   determined by customers and by investors and in any event there's</p>
<p>   a complementarity between, the two mesh in together. The Tennant</p>
<p>   Creek to Darwin leg of the Darwin to Alice Springs railway will</p>
<p>   be in common with this other network if the latter comes to fruition</p>
<p>   so, can I just say to anybody who thinks that in some way what the</p>
<p>   Federal Government has done by, as it were generally sponsoring</p>
<p>   this latest proposal that that's a snub to South Australia,</p>
<p>   that is quite wrong. We've put dollars into, $100 million,</p>
<p>   and I'm in fact the first Prime Minister of Australia to pledge</p>
<p>   Federal Government money and to really deliver on that pledge.</p>
<p>McCLUSKY:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, can I ask you though in terms of timing, as you say</p>
<p>   this is not a new proposal. It has been around. We've spoken</p>
<p>   to Everald Compton too over a number of times. But in terms of timing,</p>
<p>   I mean the Bob Katters of the world and certainly the Opposition</p>
<p>   is saying that this is simply a matter, a knee jerk reaction to</p>
<p>   the strengths of the One Nation showing in the recent Queensland</p>
<p>   State election. Is that a fair comment?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No it's not. It's completely wrong. And I gather from</p>
<p>   the reaction of Senator Bolkus that Mr Beazley and the Labor Party</p>
<p>   are opposed to the latest proposal. I mean obviously they are because</p>
<p>   Mr Bolkus who's the Shadow Minister, I heard him on the radio</p>
<p>   slamming the latest proposal saying it was crazy, saying it was</p>
<p>   wrong, therefore I take it that the Australia Labor Party is against</p>
<p>   the proposal that was announced yesterday. It is against private</p>
<p>   sector investors and the Australian public supporting a proposal</p>
<p>   that would build a rail network right through Australia. Now that's</p>
<p>   a very interesting declaration from the Labor Party and they can't</p>
<p>   have it both ways.</p>
<p>McCLUSKY:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, is it therefore coincidental that this does obviously</p>
<p>   run through those very sensitive seats where One Nation had a very</p>
<p>   strong showing?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Absolutely because it was always intended that it run through those</p>
<p>   seats. Well I'm sorry, I mean let's just get it straight.</p>
<p>   This proposal has been around for several years.</p>
<p>McCLUSKY:</p>
<p>It has.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>And you yourself have just admitted that you know that and you</p>
<p>   acknowledge that and it has always been the case that it would run</p>
<p>   through these areas. A new route for the railway hasn't been</p>
<p>   invented in the ten days that have followed the Queensland election</p>
<p>   if that is the point that you are getting at.</p>
<p>McCLUSKY:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, can I ask you then, given that it has been around for</p>
<p>   a while, is there any reason why you would not endorsed this earlier?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Because the agreement that was signed between the Board that was</p>
<p>   sponsoring the proposal and the company that is willing to put together</p>
<p>   the consortium was only signed on Monday, on Friday of last week</p>
<p>   and that had nothing whatever to do with the timing of the Queensland</p>
<p>   election. What happened was that the Board reached an agreement</p>
<p>   and then as Mr Compton said on radio this morning, he then came</p>
<p>   along and said would I mind announcing it on behalf of the Board</p>
<p>   and I was quite happy to do so. Now I had absolutely no control,</p>
<p>   or no influence, over the timing of that agreement. </p>
<p>Could I just say that I think it's a terrific idea and I cannot</p>
<p>   understand the negative reaction of the Australia Labor Party. I</p>
<p>   mean here we have the possibility that you will have built through</p>
<p>   Australia a network that could revitalise regional areas of Australia.</p>
<p>   It could generate tens of thousands of jobs throughout Australia.</p>
<p>   And what is the reaction of the Labor Party? It's against it.</p>
<p>   Now Mr Beazley cannot have it both ways. He cannot allow Senator</p>
<p>   Bolkus, the most senior member of the Labor Party from South Australia,</p>
<p>   a member of his Shadow Cabinet, one of his closest confidants, slamming</p>
<p>   the proposal and then he himself saying well, if it comes out we'll</p>
<p>   be in favour of it. Mr Beazley doesn't want the jobs that this</p>
<p>   project might generate in regional Australia. His South Australian</p>
<p>   henchman, Senator Bolkus, has said so. I'm amazed at that.</p>
<p>   I mean this project is still subject to a feasibility study. Whether</p>
<p>   it comes off will depend entirely on the results of that but for</p>
<p>   the Labor Party to be against it beggars belief.</p>
<p>McCLUSKY:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, can I ask you though? I mean obviously the crucial question</p>
<p>   is and very simply, is there room for two rail links? Can both of</p>
<p>   them be viable and do you have any preference?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well that would be decided by the investors and the public. It</p>
<p>   won't be decided by me. Governments aren't very good at</p>
<p>   making commercial decisions. Look at what happened in South Australia</p>
<p>   with your State Bank. </p>
<p>McCLUSKY:</p>
<p>No doubt about that.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well that is precisely my point and that is where Mr Beazley and</p>
<p>   Senator Bolkus are wrong because it is for the investors of South</p>
<p>   Australia, not only South Australia but Australia to make that decision.</p>
<p>   As far as we're concerned we have put $100 million into the</p>
<p>   Darwin to Alice Springs railway. I'm the first Prime Minister</p>
<p>   to seriously commit myself to building the Darwin to Alice Springs</p>
<p>   railway, that remains our position. We will continue all of the</p>
<p>   support that we have pledged in the past. Any suggestion that yesterday's</p>
<p>   announcement negates that is wrong. I mean we've put $100 million</p>
<p>   into Darwin...</p>
<p> McCLUSKY:</p>
<p>We appreciate that.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>...and we haven't put anything into the other one yet Mr Beazley</p>
<p>   and Senator Bolkus and others are running around you know, with</p>
<p>   their doom saying, we don't like this. I mean, they really</p>
<p>   should be a bit more positive about Australia's future. </p>
<p>McCLUSKY:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, can I ask you though, does it rankle with you that now</p>
<p>   every move you make, every announcement you make will somehow be</p>
<p>   thrown or discussed in the light of a reaction to One Nation? Is</p>
<p>   that the position you now find yourself in?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well that is the attitude that some people in the media have taken.</p>
<p>   I watched the ABC television news last night for example, and the</p>
<p>   reaction from that was just quite extraordinary. I don't think</p>
<p>   it's the reaction of the Australian public. The Australian</p>
<p>   public has a deep hunger for national development projects. There</p>
<p>   is a deep yearning in the hearts of all Australians to see this</p>
<p>   vast nation of ours developed.</p>
<p>McCLUSKY:</p>
<p>So at the moment you're a bit damned if you do and damned</p>
<p>   if you don't by the sounds of it.</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I don't really care in the end what the reaction of some</p>
<p>   sections of the media is. I know what is good for Australia. I believe</p>
<p>   in the Darwin to Alice Springs railway. That's why the Government</p>
<p>   that I lead committed $100 million towards it, something that no</p>
<p>   other Government since Federation has been willing to do and I am</p>
<p>   also encouraging this other project. Now whether it comes off will</p>
<p>   be determined by the investing public of Australia. It will be determined</p>
<p>   by the feasibility study but let's have a go. Let's not</p>
<p>   be so negative. Let's not, like Mr Beazley and Senator Bolkus,</p>
<p>   throw a bucket of cold water on every idea that comes up from visionary</p>
<p>   Australians to try and develop the regional areas of this country.</p>
<p>PILKINGTON:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, any election date as yet? I know you get asked</p>
<p>   the question 150 times a day...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>You won't do any better than anybody else I am sorry.</p>
<p>McCLUSKY:</p>
<p>Well I suppose we can try. Mr Howard, as you say, I suppose the</p>
<p>   big difference here is it is simply a matter of....</p>
<p>PILKINGTON:</p>
<p>No, the Prime Minister is saying no, he hasn't made up his</p>
<p>   mind on an election date yet.</p>
<p>McCLUSKY:</p>
<p>Of course they have. The big difference here, of course, is that</p>
<p>   you have made a financial commitment to the Adelaide-to-Darwin link.</p>
<p>   There is not at this stage a financial commitment from the Federal</p>
<p>   Government. Is there likely to be a financial commitment to the</p>
<p>   other project?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well we haven't been asked for one. I have made a financial</p>
<p>   commitment on behalf of the Government to Darwin-to-Alice Springs</p>
<p>   and it is very well advanced and I hope it comes off but that is</p>
<p>   ultimately for the groups. It's ultimately for those who are</p>
<p>   going to make the investment decisions but nobody will be able to</p>
<p>   say that the Government, the Coalition Government wasn't willing</p>
<p>   to put its money where its mouth has been and where the mouths of</p>
<p>   many other Federal politicians have been. We've put the money</p>
<p>   up. No Prime Minister before me was willing to do that.</p>
<p>McCLUSKY:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, I know you are very busy.....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, it's all right.</p>
<p> McCLUSKY:</p>
<p>And I know our time is limited. Can I ask you though have you been</p>
<p>   surprised by the strength of this reaction to Pauline Hanson and</p>
<p>   that one name that I am sure must haunt just about every politician</p>
<p>   of the two major parties?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Their vote in Queensland was bigger than I expected. I understand</p>
<p>   the reasons why it has happened and I sympathise with the concerns</p>
<p>   of many of the people who have voted for the One Nation Party. I</p>
<p>   don't agree with One Nation's policies. I don't agree</p>
<p>   with the way in which on some issues they play to bigotry and prejudice</p>
<p>   and that is wrong and I will oppose that very strongly. And I don't</p>
<p>   believe that their economic solutions will help, they will make</p>
<p>   things worse. The idea that you would print money, for example,</p>
<p>   would send inflation up and if you have high inflation the value</p>
<p>   of savings held by retired people in particular will be reduced.</p>
<p>   So I say to retired Australians who might be seduced by some of</p>
<p>   One Nation's policies, that particular policy will destroy</p>
<p>   the value of your savings.</p>
<p>McCLUSKY:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, does it concern you though because it seems that this</p>
<p>   very strong swing to Pauline Hanson and One Nation really rides</p>
<p>   on the back of a concern that the Australian public is saying our</p>
<p>   politicians aren't listening to us, they don't understand</p>
<p>   us. Do you think that's fair? I mean the perception is that</p>
<p>   our politicians are not sympathetic to the average working man and</p>
<p>   woman.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>There is some element of truth in the proposition that the strong</p>
<p>   support One Nation got was a reaction against existing political</p>
<p>   parties. I accept that. Of course in time One Nation will be seen</p>
<p>   as it is, as another political party and the novelty of One Nation</p>
<p>   will wear off and the transient appeal of them being so called non-politicians,</p>
<p>   which they are not, will also wear off. I think there is a message</p>
<p>   and I accept that and there are some of the things about the conduct</p>
<p>   of Federal politics that the public doesn't like. I think the</p>
<p>   confrontational style turns a lot of people off. </p>
<p>McCLUSKY:</p>
<p>They see it as arrogance too, I think.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well the perception is important. I am not an arrogant person and</p>
<p>   I don't believe a lot of people in Federal politics are arrogant.</p>
<p>   And I say that in all charity on both sides but of course I, as</p>
<p>   Prime Minister and leader of the Liberal Party, I listen. I also</p>
<p>   stand by what I believe in. And the worst thing to do in the wake</p>
<p>   of the Queensland election is to change all of your policies because</p>
<p>   that will only strengthen the hand of One Nation. You've got</p>
<p>   to have the willingness and the strength to say: yes, I'll</p>
<p>   listen on this, I'll change that but I am not going to alter</p>
<p>   the course that I believe is good for Australia. And that is the</p>
<p>   response that I have given and I'll continue to give.</p>
<p>McCLUSKY:</p>
<p>So Mr Howard, in a nutshell I suppose, the headline ÂPM on</p>
<p>   the Wrong Track' is not right then?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Absolutely. The Prime Minister is absolutely on track in respect</p>
<p>   of both of these great projects and I finish by saying that I am</p>
<p>   the first Prime Minister since Federation to commit the dollars</p>
<p>   of the Australian tax payer to the construction of the Darwin-to-Alice</p>
<p>   Springs railway and that commitment remains rock solid. But I am</p>
<p>   also, unlike Mr Beazley, willing to entertain other visionary projects</p>
<p>   that would bring tens of thousands of jobs to rural and regional</p>
<p>   Australia.</p>
<p>PILKINGTON:</p>
<p>All right Prime Minister, nice to have you on the number one morning</p>
<p>   talkshow in Adelaide. Thank you for your time.</p>
<p>McCLUSKY:</p>
<p>And hopefully we will chat again.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Thanks a lot.</p>
