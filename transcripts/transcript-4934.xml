HEADS OF GOVERNMENT M4EETING<br />
JAMAICA DECEMBER 28-29<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER OF AUSTRALIA<br />
THE RT. HON. MALCOLM FRASER, M. P.<br />
This meeting, bringing together delegates from the<br />
continents of North and South America, Europe, Africa and<br />
Australia was convened at the initiative of Mr Michael Manley,<br />
' Prime minister of Jamaica.<br />
As well as Mr Manley and myself, it was attended by the<br />
Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany, Helmut Schmidt,<br />
President Perez of Venezuela, President Obasanjo of Nigeria,<br />
' and Prime Ministers Pierre Trudeau of Canada and<br />
Odvar Nordli of Norway.<br />
The Conference arose from a commitment to focussing on<br />
North-South problems and exploring how international<br />
cooperation to resolve them might be furthered.<br />
It set aside the formalities of structured agenda, and<br />
prepared speeches. The emphasis was on informality and<br />
frankness which generated a friendly and forthright atmosphere<br />
for wide-ranging discussion on the world economic environment.<br />
The initial session was devoted to an exmination of the<br />
underlying causes of the malaise preventing the improvement<br />
of world economic conditions and more productive economic<br />
relations between developing and developed countries.<br />
The discussions revealed several important and useful<br />
areas of agreement on the nature of world economic problems<br />
and the objectives that had to be reached in relation to them.<br />
All participants agreed on the central importance of overcoming<br />
inflation and concurred that a successful attack on this<br />
fundamental enemy would stimulate economic growth. ./ 2 </p>
<p>There was also a significant degree of agreement on<br />
objectives, an agreement which left behind the traditional<br />
differences between developed and developing countries.<br />
The Conference agreed that there was a need to provide<br />
more open markets and fair and equitable opportunities<br />
for trade. There was also a widespread recognition of<br />
the problems of developing economies, particularly those<br />
dependent for income on one or two commodities and<br />
receiving inadequate export income.<br />
The discussion produced agreement on the need to have it<br />
generally accepted that effective remedial measures required<br />
a step by step approach which would bring about the<br />
interdependent market growth in developed and developing<br />
countries.<br />
A significant outcome of the Conference was the general<br />
agreement on establishing a Common Fund to finance international<br />
commodity stabilisation, and the emergence of a broad<br />
agreement on a Fund's possible structure and financing.<br />
It was also recognised that the Fund's effectiveness<br />
will be very significantly affected by the international<br />
economic environment in which it is introduced. The benefit the<br />
Fund can bring could well depend on national economic<br />
policies being directed towards the expansion of trade<br />
and markets, which was essential to world economic growth.<br />
Ultimately the key element in achieving this objective was<br />
a sustained and successful attack on world inflation. </p>
