PRIME MINISTIER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING, MP<br />
PRESS CONFERENCE, PARLIAMENT HOUSE, 14 OCTOBER 1993<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
This morning I met with Aboriginal leaders and oul: lined the Government's<br />
position on the core principles which are informing the Government's<br />
proposed legislation on Mabo and its response to the High Court decision.<br />
Over the past few days I have also discussed in general terms the<br />
Governments approach with other major groups, including mining interests<br />
and the States. And as a consequence I will be taking the proposals to<br />
Cabinet on Monday. The central requirement in thi-i is as always, as it has<br />
always been, and that is to find a balance, not a compromise of the spirit and<br />
substance of the High Court judgement, which was lo recognise Native Title<br />
and address the historic and continuing injustice experienced by Aboriginal<br />
Australians, yet equally not a compromise which ignores contemporary<br />
realities and the rights, interest and attachment to this land shared by all<br />
Australians. We need legislation which strikes a balance, which takes account of<br />
Australia's past and Australia's potential. When the Commonwealth<br />
Government entered the Mabo discussions it was with a conviction that the<br />
vast majority of Australians want a country which is both prosperous and just.<br />
A year later I am all the more convinced and I am confident that we are about<br />
to deliver legislation consistent with that ambition.<br />
The principles I will be taking to the Cabinet on Monday will largely mirror the<br />
detailed outline the Government made available on 2 September. Following<br />
Cabinet the drafting of the Bill will then proceed. I am not in a position to<br />
provide details now, but on the key issues let me say this, the processes of<br />
the Bill will be consistent with the Racial Discrimination Act, existing grants of<br />
interest will be validated and be secure, and the States and Territories will<br />
continue to have the capacity to manage the land if they meet the standards<br />
of the Commonwealth Bill. In other words, not only a just outcome for<br />
Aboriginal interests, but one which recognises the role of the States in land<br />
management and economic certainty. All major interest groups in the course<br />
of these discussions made concessions, all have ultimately recognised the<br />
great significance of the issues involved and that they demand a national<br />
response. We are looking for solutions to the problems which have beset<br />
them for 200 years, that is the Aboriginal people of Ihis country, and continue </p>
<p>to beset them. No legislation will alone be the solution, nor will any one<br />
interest be completely happy. This of course, none of us believed was ever<br />
possible. But the proposed legislation will lay the basis for solutions to be<br />
developed and above all for creating the essential environment of<br />
cooperation and good will on which progress towards all our goals will<br />
ultimately depend.<br />
I am happy to take questions from you.<br />
J: Prime Minister, to what extent will Native Title be extinguished under<br />
this new arrangement?<br />
PM: No more or less extent than under the outline of the Bill.<br />
J . of where all titles, except mining titles, would have extinguished<br />
Native Title, will that situation prevail?<br />
PM: You will have to wait until you see the outline again. But the thing is<br />
no more or less than was outlined in the outline.<br />
J: Prime Minister, how would you characterise your discussions with the<br />
Aborigines today?<br />
PM: Well I thought they were very fruitful, that is fruitful in terms of the<br />
attitude of the Aboriginal representatives to the points, they had sent<br />
me a collation of their points of agreement or disagreement on some of<br />
the measures. I had been over those in the last couple of days and<br />
was able to then handle those points off one at a time through a fairly<br />
substantial checklist. Now, we are going back tomorrow to have a<br />
further discussion, tomorrow morning some time I think, just to finalise<br />
some of the points we really didn.' t have time to finalise today.<br />
J the situation on Friday, and the situation now?<br />
PMVI Well in terms of the substance I think the Racial Discrimination Act,<br />
that is the Government's clarity about the fact that we can have, if you<br />
like, even greater certainty of titles down the route we are heading,<br />
while embracing the Racial Discrimination Act rather than overriding it,<br />
that is the key point. The other points of substance, there are other<br />
points of substance, one is that we are going to give them the right to<br />
select jurisdictions between the Federal Court and the State Courts for<br />
the hearing of Native Title, but not for the economic use of Native Title<br />
land, that will remain exclusively with the States. And beyond that<br />
there are changes, but the general thrust of the Bill is as of last week,<br />
beyond those couple of core issues. Now, it depends what you call<br />
core, obviously Aboriginal people might have a different view of some<br />
of these points, but I think what I call core issues they are probably two<br />
of the three or four main points, and there are other points. But there<br />
is a very clear intention on the part of the Government in the Bill that<br />
questions of economic land use and the efficiency of decision making </p>
<p>in this area be that which is left to the primacy of the States as they are<br />
now, as it is now with land management. But Aboriginal people want<br />
protections in respect of Native Title and the preservation of Native<br />
Title and they don't want to see any opportunities for any State to<br />
override Native Title and hence their con.: ern about the Racial<br />
Discrimination Act, a concern which we have rret.<br />
J: ( inaudible)<br />
PM: No, only cooperating States. So, if a State doesn't establish the<br />
mechanisms in this Bill and reflect that in the State, then the<br />
designated tribunals to operate in a non-cooperating State will be<br />
exclusively the Commonwealth Tribunals for the land, that is for Native<br />
Title and land use. But if a State is a complying State and they fashion<br />
their processes instrumentalities, their tribunals in accordance with the<br />
law as drafted in this Bill, well then they will have the prerogative over<br />
land management. Now, Western Australia, in my view, would be<br />
advised to become a cooperating State, in which case their tribunals<br />
will determine the economic use questions, ' 3ut only in terms of the<br />
outline laid down in this Commonwealth Bill.<br />
J: Mr Keating, explain how you have been able to reach the Aboriginal<br />
negotiators, that you can deal with their concens about the RDA. How<br />
have you been able to give greater certainty to title without overriding<br />
the RDA?<br />
PM: Well that's our advice, that the title is entirely certain under the<br />
methodology which the Government has now proposed. What the<br />
Racial Discrimination Act is, is an act against discrimination against<br />
peoples of a class or race. But it has a provision in it where one can<br />
discriminate in favour of peoples in a class or race so as to bring them<br />
up to a level of equality of opportunity with the rest of the population or<br />
community. These are called the special measure provisions. Now, I<br />
told the Cabinet two weeks ago that we were in the course of<br />
examining the special measure provisions and we have been, but of<br />
course we are also in discussion at the same time with the States<br />
trying to agree words on the Racial Discrimination Act. Now, we came<br />
to the view late last week that the words the States wished us to agree<br />
were too broad, that they not only would hava permitted the validation<br />
of past grants but may also have opened up Ihe option of States being<br />
able to do things prospectively without the sanction of the Racial<br />
Discrimination Act. Now, as a consequence of that it was a matter of<br />
us deciding how we could embrace the RDA, how we could embrace it,<br />
and at the same time validate. No doubt you will have heard some<br />
views about advices and things about the special measures and how<br />
they might work. Well they are not the special measures and the<br />
approach is not, as many people have spoken about it, it is the special<br />
measure provisions of the Racial Discrimination Act but cast in a<br />
different way, but in a way which would work. </p>
<p>J: ( inaudible)<br />
PM: Look, Tom ( Burton) 1 don't want to go through the whole Bill. Look, I<br />
don't want to obfuscate about it, but I am not here either to be<br />
shadowing the Parliamentary draftsman. There has to be a group of<br />
measures which are in fact special in their variety which undoubtedly<br />
taken as a group advance the interest of persons within a class or<br />
race.<br />
J: Can you describe some of them?<br />
PM. Well I can. They are basically the access to tribunals to hear and<br />
award native title and by the facilitation of that process, the nonextinguishment<br />
of native title, the extinguishment of native title which<br />
would otherwise go on with land grants in the interim. In other words,<br />
if these matters were heard in the courts then States would just go on<br />
routinely issuing grants of interests over native title and extinguishing<br />
hand over fist.<br />
So the tribunals, the choice of jurisdictions between the Federal court<br />
and the State Supreme court streams for the hearing of native title; the<br />
iright to negotiate over land; that is a real right of negotiation followed<br />
by a tribunal arbitral process which the Bill provides; the condition of<br />
just terms for extinguishment of native title, that is a Commonwealth<br />
Constitutional requirement which we will require the States to meet,<br />
even though they are not required to meet it; protections beyond the<br />
common law; the designation and funding of particular Aboriginal<br />
organisations which have been the empowerment through which the<br />
empowerment of Aboriginal people has generally come and a package<br />
of measures which also deal with extending opportunity to those<br />
Aboriginal people unable or unlikely to be advantaged by the Mabo<br />
decision as a result of their dispossession. I am talking of such things<br />
as a major land fund which would go on to a revolving fund which<br />
would go on buying land for time in memoriam.<br />
All of those things amount to and can I say many other elements to<br />
that, but I mean this is in the broad, all of these things amount to a<br />
series of special measures which are no doubt there for the<br />
advancement of Aboriginal people.<br />
J: When you talk about the rights to negotiate in relation to land under<br />
those special measures, are you talking about negotiating over land on<br />
which there are other grants already issued and are you going to allow<br />
at the end of it that that's the retrospective procedure of fairness?<br />
PM Look, I'm not into<br />
J, You said on Friday.. </p>
<p>PM: I know what I said to you and you asked ma a whole lot Of legal<br />
questions at the last press conference.<br />
J: But, you said on Friday that there would be..<br />
PM: I am not going to oblige you now any more than I was then.<br />
J: Prime Minister, does this mean that native Aile will coexist with all<br />
other forms of title except freehold title that is, not be extinguished?<br />
PM: You will have to wait until you see the Bill again, but the general thread<br />
of the legislation as you saw it in the presentation, this is the point I<br />
make to you and the presentation will still be there,<br />
J: Prime Minister, do you stand by your statement of 17 June, where you<br />
said " where freehold or leasehold has been dispensed in the past the<br />
High Court has held that the native title has been extinguished". Do<br />
you stand by that statement now?<br />
PM. No, what do you mean stand by the statemente<br />
J: Well, you made the statement.<br />
PM: It is not a statement, it is a description of what : he High Court said.<br />
J: Do you still agree with that description, you gave it?<br />
PM: That is the extremity of the High Court's power. The High Court's<br />
judgement said to take these principles to their logical end point, a<br />
valid grant of these varieties extinguishes niative title. But we are<br />
saying in our Bill, we give the Aboriginal people if you like, a legislative<br />
advantage over that over the common law position by protecting<br />
native title where it would otherwise be extinguished.<br />
J1 So it is not going to be extinguished?<br />
PM: Again, Peter ( Gill) please don't try on me tricky questions and tricky<br />
points. Please. Do me at least the favour of understanding exactly..<br />
me understanding exactly what you are about<br />
J ( inaudible)<br />
PM: Please don't be any certainty will come with the Bill not with your<br />
column, dear fellow. Now, I know you are all entitled to have a big<br />
head about your columns but, the fact is arid no doubt you are well<br />
read. But, you may not be as well informed a~ s you are well read. Let<br />
me just make this point to you. The High Court has said in its decision<br />
that the valid issue of a grant or interest in land over freehold or<br />
leasehold title can extinguish native title. The question is, should it<br />
extinguish native title? Do you understanci? That is point I made. </p>
<p>Should it extinguish native title? And we are saying in some cases.<br />
yes, and in some cases, no. And that is in the outline on 2<br />
September.<br />
J: ( inaudible) on Friday you talked about setting up a system of<br />
tribunals around the country to determine these issues.<br />
PM. Sorry Amanda ( Buckley) I wasn't quite with you.<br />
J: I was just trying to work out what part these tribunals you mentioned<br />
just before in your list of points, what part they play?<br />
PMV: Let me explain to you. The Aboriginal community can trot along to the<br />
High Court and mount land claims. Now, this will be a cumbersome,<br />
time consuming process and while it is happening States will be<br />
issuing land grants and extinguishing native title. So we want a<br />
process which is fair, expeditious, and where there is certainty. So we<br />
will set up a tribunal to hear and award native title. That will be a<br />
branch of the courts of the States the Supreme Courts most likely or<br />
the Federal Court of Australia. This will obviate the need to trot land<br />
claims along to the High Court or to the Federal Court.<br />
J: So you are calling these tribunals, but they are in fact of the court<br />
system?<br />
PMV. They are courts. But then parallel to that there is a tribunal. This was<br />
all revealed in the outline of 2 September. What the tribunal says, the<br />
tribunals are there for having had native title awarded and someone<br />
wants an economic use over it, be it mining or pasture or tourism or<br />
what have you, those tribunals then will sit in an arbitral judgement<br />
upon them in the event that the proponent of the economic use doesn't<br />
get to a point of agreement with the native title holder. So, there is a<br />
process of notification, a process of consultation; 2 process of<br />
negotiation:, and in the event that fails a process of arbitration. That<br />
will happen in the economic use tribunals which will be set up only in<br />
the states not in the Commonwealth jurisdiction. But there will be a<br />
Commonwealth tribunal for Commonwealth lands that is the ACT and<br />
Jervis Bay etc. But that same tribunal will apply in a State that doesn't<br />
comply<br />
J: Western Australia.<br />
PM-Well, any State.<br />
J-Prime Minister, what is going to be the cut off date for validating<br />
leases?'<br />
PMV: That is a matter for negotiation. It is more likely to be the end of the<br />
year, end of this year. </p>
<p>I Prime Minister, are you telling us that you aire finally arrived at a<br />
position that you believe settles, as far as possible, the concerns of the<br />
Aborigines and your concerns the concerns of the Commonwealth<br />
Government?<br />
PM: I What I have done here today is to meet the Aboriginal people, to take<br />
on board their comments on the draft and their points of objection to<br />
see whether we could meet them and where wi) could meet them, say<br />
so, where not say so, say why and indicate to them that we will be<br />
presenting a Bill that has the following featues outlined to them<br />
saying we hope you can support this Bill. We believe that this Bill<br />
covers off the twin objectives of equity and justice for Aboriginal people<br />
and provides a workable system of land management for the economy<br />
and society. That draft outline which I will now take to Cabinet,<br />
Cabinet will consider and when Cabinet has completed its<br />
consideration, we'll then go to drafting. We will then introduce it.<br />
J: Are you confident the Aborigines..<br />
PM. I am confident that the Bill is everything I say it is and that it can pass<br />
through both Houses of this Parliament.<br />
J: Do you think you might introduce the Bill this waek in Parliament, next<br />
week in Parliament?<br />
PM: No, the Bill is weeks and weeks away. The Elill is weeks away, the<br />
drafting of it it is a huge, mammoth drafting. Trhis is a major piece of<br />
law, this is a major drafting task and because even if one changes<br />
some of these obviously for some of the sections they will remain<br />
largely unchanged and drafted as of now. But because many of things<br />
are changing and will have then consequential impacts upon other<br />
sections of the Bill it really requires each time you change this Bill in<br />
anything other than a marginal way, it means that the whole outline is<br />
essentially re-drafted.<br />
J: Where are the States now in terms of the changes that you have made<br />
to this legislation?<br />
PM: I have spoken to State Premiers over the last couple of days and last<br />
week about this. I think they want in the end to be able to sensibly<br />
manage land. I think they want a national system and when we get<br />
down to a finer drafting and they can see that draft I think they will be<br />
convinced of the fact that this is a fair and de.-ent piece of law from<br />
which ever direction it is viewed. This may not be the view of some<br />
States who have now not been in the process of negotiations to date,<br />
but that I hope, is where they will end up.<br />
J* Prime Minister, in the broad can you just tell us what form of<br />
entitlement will and wont be extinguished by nalive title? </p>
<p>PM: I'd just send you back to the outline Glenn ( Milne). I told you before<br />
and you will have to wait to see in which way the outline has changed.<br />
But by and large it will be pretty much as the outline.<br />
J: So Prime Minister, this is the Government's final word on this package<br />
that you taking to Cabinet on Monday, there is no hope for any of the<br />
PM. Once it goes through the Cabinet it will be into drafting.<br />
J: Would it be right to say that up until last week you thought you would<br />
get the Federal Opposition on side eventually and then realising that<br />
they weren't going to come on side you made these changes?<br />
P M: I think Mr Reith's appointment was there to spike the passage of the<br />
Bill. And he has made that pretty clear hasn't he.<br />
J: So that is the reason for the change is it?<br />
PM: No, the fact is we have the amenity within the Commonwealth<br />
Parliament in terms of its Constitutional power to establish all of these<br />
procedures. We want to do this co-operatively with the States, we<br />
need them to make land management work. But we also need their<br />
support for it I think. We would like their support for it. That didn't shift<br />
the West Australian Premiers position I might add and it hasn't shifted<br />
the Federal Opposition's position as far as I understand.<br />
J. Would you recall Parliament if necessary to ensure the legislation is<br />
passed?<br />
PM: I don't think there is any need to..<br />
J: In your advice, is there any question that the Commonwealth's<br />
constitutional powers to deal with laws affecting race override the<br />
States constitutional powers on land management?<br />
PM. I I am not here to be giving you legal opinions, but we have a clear<br />
power under the race power of 1967 and we have also powers in<br />
relation to the external affairs and the convention. The Commonwealth<br />
has got adequate constitutional power here.<br />
J: You don't think this could be challenged?<br />
PM. That's up to you you ring around the Premiers and their advisers and<br />
see what they say, </p>
