The Prime Minister today condemned Monday's terrorist attack on Moscow's Domodedovo airport.</p>
<p>This brutal attack appears to have killed many and injured more, and the thoughts of Australians are with the families of all those who have suffered as a result of this act.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister offered Australia's condolences to the people of Russia, and to the many nations likely to have been touched by this appalling and indiscriminate act of violence.</p>
<p>The Australian Government condemns all acts of terrorism as cowardly attacks upon innocent people, and will continue to work with its neighbours and with the international community against the perpetrators of terrorist acts.</p>
<p>Australian consular officials in Moscow are urgently seeking to determine if any Australians have been hurt in this attack.</p>
<p>Australians concerned about relatives can contact the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade's consular hotline on 1300 555 135. </p>
