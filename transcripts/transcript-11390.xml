<p>  SUBJECTS: Australian economy, communication services, banks, health services,</p>
<p>   education facilities, Centenary of Federation.</p>
<p>  Mr Chairman, Kay and Bill, ladies and gentlemen.</p>
<p>  This is a great occasion for me. I can't think of anything more quintessentially</p>
<p>   Australian than to be addressing a gathering in a World War I memorial hall</p>
<p>   of people who are the backbone of the Australian bush. It started to rain</p>
<p>   after a long period of drought and quite properly the Federal Government</p>
<p>   accepts all due praise for that. And the odd flaw in the roofing arrangements</p>
<p>   have been exposed but so what. What a delightful way to discover you've</p>
<p>   got a leaking roof.</p>
<p>  I gather the rain has been very welcome and, of course, it's a reminder</p>
<p>   to those Australians like myself who have grown up in the cities of just</p>
<p>   how difficult and how precarious and how challenging life in the bush can</p>
<p>   really be.</p>
<p>  I have followed a deliberate policy as Prime Minister of going on regular</p>
<p>   visits to the smaller population centres of the country. It's terribly easy</p>
<p>   in this place and this country if you don't live in one of the big cities</p>
<p>   it's terribly easy to think that the people who are elected at the time</p>
<p>   of Parliament only worry about the big smoke and they ignore the rest of</p>
<p>   the country. And I can understand why people feel that way. And on occasions</p>
<p>   they have had reasons to feel that way. And I have been extremely conscious</p>
<p>   of that and I have set out from day one not to allow that to happen. And</p>
<p>   I have meticulously ensured that there's always a fair amount of space in</p>
<p>   my calendar for visits of this kind.</p>
<p>  And I know that this is a particularly difficult part of the country because</p>
<p>   it's gone through long periods with very, very low rainfall and Bill is</p>
<p>   right I am constantly reminded of it. We talk regularly, very regularly</p>
<p>   and it is always, sort of, starts with [inaudible]. He never misses. And</p>
<p>   he does it so very well and I say 'well you had some in Junee' and he says</p>
<p>   'oh yeah, that was about three years ago'. [Inaudible] I mean, I was musing</p>
<p>   a few minutes ago that if the rains keeps coming and you can persuade the</p>
<p>   Russian army to start buying great coats again and a few of those other</p>
<p>   things that are needed to provide some extra boost to the wool industry</p>
<p>   it would be terrific.</p>
<p>  Now, we have tried as a Government to create better economic circumstances</p>
<p>   for the whole country and we have. And I am very proud of the fact that</p>
<p>   nationally the Australian economy is very strong and the country is in good</p>
<p>   shape. But the paradox of all of that is that side by side with the national</p>
<p>   prosperity you have a lot of areas of the country that are not fully sharing</p>
<p>   that through no fault of their own. And parts of the bush are very much</p>
<p>   in that. It's not their fault, it's not your fault. You can't control commodity</p>
<p>   prices, you can't control the weather, you can't control the vagaries of</p>
<p>   people's purchasing habits.</p>
<p>  But we as a Government can make sure that your interest rates are lower</p>
<p>   and they are a lot lower now than they used to be. I know you would like</p>
<p>   to see them even lower. We can bring in a taxation system which will start</p>
<p>   next year that will make diesel fuel cheaper and that's important for the</p>
<p>   bush and will take a lot off costs of exports and that's very important</p>
<p>   to the bush as well. We can have other measures that provide particular</p>
<p>   assistance. And I'd have to say that I was very impressed with Claughton</p>
<p>   House that I visited and I know how important that kind of facility is to</p>
<p>   the people who live in rural Australia. We take for granted in the city</p>
<p>   that you just turn up to the local school at no cost and present yourself</p>
<p>   and that's it and then you come home after school's out in the afternoon.</p>
<p>   A different world here and I understand that and I know how important facilities</p>
<p>   of that kind are to you people.</p>
<p>  So today is very much a listening and visiting exercise that I hope the</p>
<p>   fact that I have come, I hope the fact that I have brought with me my two</p>
<p>   parliamentary colleagues both of whom are doing a terrific job representing</p>
<p>   your interests in Canberra. And Kay is a new member and I commend her very</p>
<p>   warmly to you. She is a great, a very energetic member. And she is the member</p>
<p>   for Riverina I think. I was about to say Eden-Monaro and then I looked [inaudible].</p>
<p>   And she is very energetic and that is very important. And she represents</p>
<p>   a very diverse electorate and it's not easy representing a big diverse electorate.</p>
<p>   And, of course, Bill is an old mate of mine as you all know and he is doing</p>
<p>   an absolutely fantastic job representing the entire State and bringing a</p>
<p>   particular rural perspective.</p>
<p>  So you are in no way forgotten, you loom very large and very importantly</p>
<p>   in our concerns. The Australian bush is part and parcel of the Australian</p>
<p>   story and the Australian achievement. Without the bush Australia wouldn't</p>
<p>   be recognisable as the country that I grew up in and love so very much.</p>
<p>   So that's why it's very important not only economically and socially but</p>
<p>   also as far as preserving our national [inaudible]. It's so tremendously</p>
<p>   important to make sure that your concerns are fully understood and fully</p>
<p>   responded to.</p>
<p>  Your hospitality here at Booligal as well as the hospitality that I have</p>
<p>   received in Hay has been absolutely marvellous and, of course, country people</p>
<p>   are renowned for their kindness and their hospitality.</p>
<p>  It's very important, the chairman mentioned and mobile phones, it is very</p>
<p>   important that as the benefits of information technology flow through they</p>
<p>   flow to the entire community and not just the people who live in the big</p>
<p>   population centres. And one of the things that we are endeavouring to do</p>
<p>   through the progressive sale of bits of Telstra is to make certain that</p>
<p>   out of the proceeds of those sales we will provide additional communication</p>
<p>   services to people who live in country Australia. Provide them with better</p>
<p>   quality mobile phone services or some mobile phone services in those areas,</p>
<p>   and this is apparently one of them, where they don't exist. And that's an</p>
<p>   important priority of ours. Provide people with faster access to the Internet.</p>
<p>   Provide people with regional transaction centres and we are going to start</p>
<p>   opening those in different parts of rural Australia over the next few months.</p>
<p>   Which aggregate under one roof some basic services that have disappeared</p>
<p>   from country towns.</p>
<p>  I was asked earlier what I thought was the attitude of the banks towards</p>
<p>   closing their country networks. I have to say to you that the banks of Australia</p>
<p>   are a lot more sensitive and conscious now of the backlash in the bush about</p>
<p>   closure of banks than was the case two or three years ago. I think people</p>
<p>   in rural Australia have done a very good job of driving that point home</p>
<p>   and can I say on your behalf we've also done a job of doing exactly the</p>
<p>   same thing.</p>
<p>  I speak to the chief executives of the major banks and the chairmen of major</p>
<p>   banks from time to time and on no occasion do I miss an opportunity, appropriately</p>
<p>   not overbearingly but appropriately, of reminding them of just how important</p>
<p>   it is to the character of our country to preserve essential services in</p>
<p>   the bush.</p>
<p>  I also know how important doctors are in a small community and I know how</p>
<p>   hard it is to get them. Michael Wooldridge and John Anderson went on a rural</p>
<p>   tour a few months ago and listened to the concern people had about the lack</p>
<p>   of medical services and the lack of doctors in the bush. And I think we</p>
<p>   have started to lay the foundations through a number of proposals to turn</p>
<p>   that situation around over a period of years. It wont' be easy but I think</p>
<p>   we've had a bit of a breakthrough in a number of areas and we are going</p>
<p>   to start to see an improvement.</p>
<p>  I am also conscious of the difficulties of maintaining education facilities</p>
<p>   and you told me of the fact that the school in this district is slated for</p>
<p>   closure. And as you rightly mention, Mr Chairman, that is not a direct responsibility</p>
<p>   of the Federal Government but that doesn't mean to say we are insensitive</p>
<p>   to those sorts of things. We can't guarantee, no government State, federal,</p>
<p>   Liberal, Labor, of any political complexion, can guarantee every service</p>
<p>   that every person wants in every community in Australia. And I think country</p>
<p>   people are entitled to say that things have gone far enough in relation</p>
<p>   to many of their basic services and they are entitled to say we want the</p>
<p>   drift arrested and we want it turned around and we want [inaudible] in a</p>
<p>   number of areas. And we are endeavouring to do that and endeavouring to</p>
<p>   respond to it in different ways some of which I have touched on today.</p>
<p>  So I hope you can see my visit as that of a Prime Minister who cares about</p>
<p>   the Australian bush and the people who live in it. As somebody who hopes</p>
<p>   by his presence to engage you and listen to you, to respond to your concerns</p>
<p>   where you can and where you can't to say so quite openly. And above all</p>
<p>   to remind people all around this country that as we come to celebrate 100</p>
<p>   years of federation we have a colossal Australian achievement to be very</p>
<p>   proud of. And that the people of rural Australia have made a massive contribution</p>
<p>   to how we think of ourselves as Australians and how the rest of the world</p>
<p>   sees us as Australians. And that is a very, very important thing for me</p>
<p>   as I know it is for both of my colleagues. Thank you very much indeed for</p>
<p>   your hospitality, it really has been very nice to be amongst you.</p>
