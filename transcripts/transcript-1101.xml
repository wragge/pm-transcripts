FOR PRESS: P. M. No, 1+ g0! 1962~._<br />
PREMIERS' CONFERENCE<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister. the Rt. Hon. Sir Robert Menzies.<br />
It should be understood that todayts meeting with<br />
the Premiers was recognised by all of us as a preliminary meetings<br />
We will assemble again on June 1st to arrive at definite<br />
conclusions about the agreement which is to succeed the last one<br />
made in 1959 to regulate the financial assistance arrangements<br />
which have operated since that time.<br />
Today's meeting was, therefore, exploratory. The<br />
Commonwealth welcomed it because we thought it most desirable that<br />
we should be put in possession of the views of the various State<br />
Premiers both critical and constructive, so that we might have an<br />
opportunity of giving them proper study before June.<br />
I would like to repeat what I said in the Conference,<br />
i. e. that I have never known a better meeting, Every contribution<br />
was thoughtful extremely well-prepared and lucid, Nobody resorted<br />
to Party political arguments. Everybody felt that we were<br />
disoussing problems of great importance not only to the States but to<br />
the Commonwealth-problems which we would all wish to solve in a<br />
co-operative fashiion, due regard being paid to the reasonable needs<br />
of the Commonwealth which, as we pointed out are not diminishing,<br />
This was, I thought, recognised all round. tiobody would deny that<br />
having regard to such rapidly growing items as defence expenditure<br />
and the limitations of the current loan market, the Commonwealth<br />
Government has quite a budgetary task ahead of itc Similarly, in<br />
a growing community, the States have great responsibilities and<br />
have a natural eagerness for progress.<br />
We have agreed to meet again at the beginning of June.<br />
I have indicated to the States that some days before June 10 days<br />
if possible we will arrange to have discussions on the official<br />
level between Commonwealth and State Treasury officers. In the<br />
meantime, as I said to the Premiers we will give the most careful<br />
attention to what has been said by Lhem because like them, we<br />
desire to have some sound conclusions arrived a before the<br />
financial year ends, This is the sixth year of the 1959 agreement<br />
and therefore presents the necessary opportunity to consider the<br />
terms and duration of a new agreement.<br />
As I said to the Premiers, in expressing my appreciati. on<br />
of the way in which they had put their respective arguments, I f<br />
cannot attempt to anticipate what our answers may be; but I am sure<br />
that the tone and temper of today's discussions will help us very<br />
considerably. CANBERRA* 22nd April 1965. </p>
