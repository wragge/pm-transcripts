TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING, M P<br />
DOORSTOP, BAN KSTOWN AIRPORT, SYDNEY<br />
FEBRUARY 1994.<br />
J: You must be terrified this morning, with the news that 17 percent of<br />
Labor voters are prepared to vote Liberal under Bronw yn Bishop's<br />
leadership?<br />
PIM: Yes, well, don't believe any of those rinky-dink, one thousand, polls on<br />
the telephone they're just not worth reading. The fact is. the Liberal<br />
Party's in a state of chaos, I think. And, as Four Corners reported last<br />
night, when people are coming out attacking the leader saying they<br />
can't win with him, with Senator Bishop prowling around displaying<br />
herself politically to the rest of the Liberal Party and the country then I<br />
think the Liberal Party has got deep problems. The problem for the<br />
Liberal Party is it doesn't know what it is there for. It's got no policy<br />
framework, they don't know where the society and the country is and<br />
they can't relate to it. That's why they're in the trouble they're in. It isn't<br />
because they have somebody who parts their hair the wrong way, it's<br />
not to do with appearances or political appeal they don't know why<br />
they exist. They've lost the policy threads in this country and they can't<br />
relate any more to Australian society and the Australian community.<br />
J: There would also appear to be a lack of discipline, too?<br />
PM: Well, that comes whenever you get the policy paralysis and the<br />
breakdown and that's what they've got. The Labor Party had the same<br />
thing in the 1950s and 1960s.. They've got it now. They don't<br />
understand the changes in Australia, they are not part of them and it's<br />
because of that that they have the dissension they are having. It's not<br />
about personalities, it's the fact that they don't have any policy<br />
cohesion.<br />
J: How seriously do you take a Bishop-Costello Coalition? </p>
<p>TEL: I. eo. I4, J No. U1 t. UD Q-<br />
2<br />
PM: Well, I think while ever the Liberal Party doesn't know what it's about,<br />
while ever it fals to relate to the community and understand the<br />
changes taking place in Australia, it doesn't matter who they propose to<br />
lead them, they'll be in trouble.<br />
J: Mr Keating, on another matter, do you anticipate any flow through<br />
effects from the worsening trade war between Japan and the US?<br />
PMV: Well, this has been on now for years, this balance of payments problem<br />
between the US and Japan, and no doubt in the working out of this the<br />
US and Japan have got to find accommodations. And they will over<br />
time.<br />
J0 Do you think it will have an effect on Australia?<br />
PM: Japan Is In a recession and that's already having an effect on us. And,<br />
obviously, the more that we can spread economic growth, the more the<br />
GATT round can open up opportunities for growth, the better off we'll all<br />
be Including Japan and the United States.<br />
J: In the past, Australia has taken the position, your government has taken<br />
the position that in a war between Japan and America you would be<br />
Inclined to take Japan's side. Is that still your position?<br />
PMV: No, it was never our position. What we're saying is we won't enter into<br />
bilateral arrangements which are detrimental to Japan. That's a<br />
completely different thing to saying we're taking one side against the<br />
United States. It's for the US and Japan to work that out, we've helped<br />
create a new institution to work it out, within, and that is APEC. APEC<br />
gives the United States and Japan a chance to work it out within an<br />
umbrella organisation, to look at their policy and trade differences. But,<br />
they'll always do it bilaterally as well as in any other framework. There's<br />
a lot of serious thought about this relationship and in terms of their<br />
current-account it's had a problem for years which stems from an<br />
underlying savings imbalance between the two countries. Now, it's<br />
going to take time -to work. this. out. but. it's, working. itself o4t in a sense,<br />
now as the United States is enjoying very rapid growth of exports into<br />
north and south Asia so that the dependency of Japan on the United<br />
States, as a market, Is diminishing and like most problems they tend<br />
naturally to work themselves out.<br />
J: What's your reading of the American position though, do you think the<br />
timing of all this is to take advantage of the political vacuum and crises<br />
that exist In Tokyo at the moment?<br />
PM: No, I don't think so. I think this is just, I think Prime Minister Hosokawa<br />
and his government have had a good relationship with the Clinton<br />
administration. I think this is just a reflection of fundamental underlying<br />
differences, </p>
