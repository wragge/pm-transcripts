PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING MP<br />
DOORSTOP, GRAND HYATT HOTEL, MELBOURNE, 5 OCTOBER 1995<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
J: Mr Howard says Australia doesn't have enough combat capability.<br />
What's your reaction to that?<br />
PM: I would reject any such conclusion by him. We have had probably the<br />
most far-reaching examination of our Defence, with a White Paper in<br />
the 1980s and then the Strategic Review recently. But I notice also<br />
he's saying he won't put any more money into Defence, so what's he<br />
doing, wringing his hands? Well, that's what he's normally doing, of<br />
course.<br />
J: But he said the White paper is a failure?<br />
PM: On what basis would he say that when the serious people in Australian<br />
Defence, and Australian Defence analysis have never concurred in<br />
that view. And if he thinks that, where's his money? I think he will tell<br />
you he's not committing any more funds to Defence.<br />
