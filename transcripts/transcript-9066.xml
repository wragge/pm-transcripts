SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING, MP<br />
OPENING OF THE CONFERENCE ON WOMEN, POWER AND THE<br />
21ST CENTURY<br />
MELBOURNE, 3 DECEMBER 1993<br />
Thank you for the invitation to speak at this very<br />
important conference.<br />
It is really a conference about the great anomaly of<br />
Australian democracy the great flaw in Australian<br />
democracy. This is a country which pioneered women's rights which<br />
delivered to women the vote and thie right to stand for<br />
parliament in 1902, yet whose national parliament in 1993<br />
is overwhelmingly male.<br />
This is a country which prides itself on its democratic<br />
institutions yet in the most important of those<br />
democratic institutions, the nation's parliaments, men<br />
outnumber women 7 to 1, in the House of Representatives<br />
more than 10 to one.<br />
This is a country renowned for its pervasive democratic<br />
spirit and the dictum of the fair go yet, when it comes<br />
to women's parliamentary representation, the record and<br />
the contemporary reality of the party which has always<br />
believed itself the embodiment of these traditions, the<br />
Australian Labor Party, is only marginally better than<br />
the rest.<br />
No doubt the aberration can be explained: but it can't be<br />
justified. There are reasons but we shouldn't call them<br />
excuses. The ruling body of the nation should be representative of<br />
the people it serves. At present it is not.<br />
Parliaments make laws for all the people and its<br />
composition should as far as possible reflect that. At<br />
present it does not.<br />
In fact it is has been calculated, by Kay Setches I<br />
think, that at the present rate of increase it would take </p>
<p>another 60 years to achieve equal representation of men<br />
and women in the Commonwealth Parliament.<br />
In the meantime Australian democracy is the loser. This<br />
is the fundamental point, I believe we all lose.<br />
It is less that women have a right to be there than we<br />
have a need for them to be there. It is less an argument<br />
for women than an argument for the country.<br />
Equal representation of women and men strengthens the<br />
legitimacy of our decision making process. More than<br />
that, it strengthens our capacity to make the right<br />
decisions. At present we are losing a vast pool of talent and<br />
wisdom. We are losing leadership.<br />
We need look no further than Joan Kirner and<br />
Carmen Lawrence for proof of that.<br />
We need Joan Kirner and Carmen Lawrence and many more<br />
like them in the national parliament. We need them in<br />
the debates on economic and social policy, on<br />
unemployment, the workplace, trade, foreign affairs,<br />
arts, Mabo.<br />
We need women involved in the debate about an Australian<br />
republic. We need them in a leading role.<br />
Australia is changing at a quite remarkable rate. It is<br />
being re-fashioned to some extent by economic and<br />
cultural forces beyond our control; but more<br />
substantially, it is being re-shaped by our own efforts<br />
and our own vision. The direction of policy and the<br />
shape of our relationships are changing fundamentally and<br />
very rapidly.<br />
Our relationship with the region has changed dramatically<br />
in the space of a couple of years and that in turn will<br />
change Australia. It will create extraordinary new<br />
opportunities. The implications go well beyond trade<br />
they go to employment, business, education, culture.<br />
There is a generational shift occurring. The experience<br />
of multiculturalism, the fact of global communications,<br />
new technologies, new economic and social imperatives,<br />
and indeed the new status and increasingly prominent role<br />
of women, is shaping a new national identity one, I<br />
hope, which will continue our best traditions while<br />
embracing the new reality of Australia.<br />
Women must be there in all these momentous debates,<br />
asking the questions and helping to find the answers. And<br />
the more they work from the centre of the debate and the<br />
less from the margins, the more their voices are heard in<br />
the nation's parliaments, the more they will be heard in </p>
<p>the wider society and, I have little doubt, the more<br />
parliament will be heard as well.<br />
Now of course if it were enough to just say these things<br />
we could all go home now. It is necessary to say them,<br />
but saying them will not get the barriers down.<br />
Getting the barriers down requires political power and<br />
political will and let mie hasten to say that they are<br />
by no means the same thing. There have been plenty in<br />
our history who have been attracted to power and plenty<br />
have gained it but relatively few I believe have<br />
exercised it as they might have.<br />
Relatively few have actively pursued the necessary<br />
reforms, or seized the opportunities which are presented<br />
to each generation and so some of our old deficiencies<br />
have been passed on.<br />
Now I take some comfort and even some pride from the<br />
fact that in the past ten years we have removed some of<br />
the anomalies relating to women.<br />
If it is true that choice is the prerequisite to the<br />
exercise of power, and the prerequisite to choice is<br />
economic independence, then this Labor Government can<br />
take some pride in its record.<br />
For we have taken not a few major steps in the direction<br />
of economic independence.<br />
Family payments paid directly to women caring for<br />
children was one of them.<br />
The extension of superannuation so that now most women<br />
workers are entitled to coverage is another; and coverage<br />
and benefits will increase substantially over this<br />
decade. The past ten years has seen very significant improvements<br />
in women's access to education.<br />
The number of young women completing year 12 nearly<br />
doubled to 80 per cent.<br />
Enrolments of women in higher education grew by 77<br />
per cent and women now make up more than 50 per cent<br />
of higher education students.<br />
Women are still under-represented in courses such as<br />
engineering and in most apprenticeships and their<br />
employment opportunities are accordingly restricted;<br />
but the Government's reform of vocational education<br />
and training will open up some of these pathways for<br />
women. </p>
<p>We have greatly expanded child-care. As of 1993 child<br />
care in Australia is recognised as a mainstream economic<br />
issue.<br />
Child care is an integral part of the drive to become a<br />
more competitive country.<br />
It is now a commonplace that successful countries are<br />
those with flexible and skilled workforces: it is<br />
therefore common sense that women with skills and work<br />
experience be kept in the workforce.<br />
Our economic growth and our living standards will benefit<br />
from women's participation.<br />
For countless Australian women child care can make<br />
participation possible it can make the choice between<br />
participating and not participating a real one.<br />
As part of its commitment to meet demand for work-related<br />
child care by 2001, by 1996-97 the Government will fund<br />
nearly 300,000 child care places.<br />
From next July we will provide a 30 per cent cash rebate<br />
on the cost of work-related child care, a long overdue<br />
recognition of the costs involved for women earning an<br />
income. These employment, education and child care programs are<br />
all designed to increase life choices for Australian<br />
women, and in doing that they open that much wider the<br />
way to positions of power.<br />
I might also say today that I have advised the Office for<br />
the Status of Women to monitor the implementation of<br />
election commitments of specific relevance to women, in<br />
particular the new child care program.<br />
For all the improvements in women's opportunity, status<br />
and influence, for all the widening of equality and<br />
freedom, there remains the fact of violence against women<br />
violence which strips them of the most fundamental<br />
freedom and denies them power over their lives.<br />
Violence which degrades Australian society and mocks our<br />
belief in democracy and justice.<br />
-As.. a-government . we know that . we cannot expect women<br />
denied freedom from fear to share our faith in this<br />
society: or to believe us when we say we are serious in<br />
our pursuit of social justice if we are not seriously<br />
attempting to eliminate violence against women.<br />
We have acknowledged this in a recent review of our<br />
women's policy advising mechanisms which identified as<br />
priorities women's economic security and the law, with a<br />
particular emphasis on the elimination of violence. </p>
<p>The same review identified as a priority the subject of<br />
today's conference women and public life and their<br />
involvement in decision-making.<br />
This is an issue whose time has well and truly come. The<br />
time has come for companies, businesses, unions, the<br />
bureaucracy, churches, schools and universities, the<br />
courts. And it has come for the Australian Labor Party.<br />
It has come for the Labor Party for all the reasons I<br />
have mentioned because the Labor Party is the party of<br />
social justice, and the party with a vision of Australia<br />
as a great social democracy, and we cannot have these<br />
things unless women are receiving equal justice and<br />
participating equally in the democracy.<br />
In fact the time came long ago: as long ago as the turn<br />
of the century when a campaigner for women's suffrage<br />
wrote, " to sum up all reasons in one it is just."<br />
The numbers speak for themselves. Of the 837 Members of<br />
Parliament in Australia, only 118, or 14 per cent are<br />
women. Of the total number of ALP Members of Parliament<br />
17 per cent are women. In the House of Representatives<br />
there are 13 women or 9 per cent. Of the ALP Members,<br />
11 per cent are women.<br />
The Labor Party should not claim that the underrepresentation<br />
of women is someone else's problem.<br />
Nor can anyone claim, of course, that it is a result of<br />
chance or the merit principle in action.<br />
There is no question that we have to tackle<br />
discrimination both direct and indirect.<br />
Indirect discrimination is likely to be the hardest to<br />
shift because very often it is coming from entrenched<br />
cultural habits and perspectives.<br />
Cultural change is difficult but not impossible. it<br />
seems to me that the starting point is recognition of<br />
necessity. That is what, for instance, drove the change<br />
in our industrial culture in the last decade.<br />
In the ALP we now have to take on the business of equal<br />
representation as a necessity. It has to become part of<br />
Labor Party culture.<br />
We have to take up the battle for hearts and minds on<br />
this, and at the same time pursue the necessary<br />
structural change.<br />
The campaign in the Party under the heading " Half by<br />
2000" is one way of doing this. And I support it.<br />
I support increasing the number of women in all federal<br />
and state caucuses. Whether we reach that goal of 50 per </p>
<p>cent depends on many things, not least of which is our<br />
continuing to win elections.<br />
But the goal is important to indicate what we stand for<br />
and to measure our progress.<br />
If you will permit me to return to a theme of mine I<br />
have always believed that when Labor stops reforming,<br />
Labor will lose power.<br />
It is the old bicycle principle if you lose the<br />
strength or the will to pedal you'll fall over. If we<br />
stop pursuing our social democratic ambitions and our<br />
national ambitions we will stop being the government of<br />
the Commonwealth.<br />
In a speech to the NSW Labor Party earlier this year, I<br />
said to keep up the momentum of reform we had to look at<br />
ourselves. That we had to reform the Party.<br />
The Organisation Review process of discussion and debate<br />
on the future structure of the Party has begun.<br />
And as part of this process, I have asked the National<br />
Secretary, Gary Gray, to report to me before next year's<br />
national conference with specific recommendations on what<br />
changes are necessary to increase the number of women in<br />
state and federal caucuses.<br />
Early next year, I will also be meeting with the state<br />
Labor leaders to pursue the issue.<br />
This is a Government of reform, you can be sure of that.<br />
We are determined to confront those changing realities of<br />
contemporary life at home, in our region and in the<br />
world and create a country which can share in the best<br />
the future has to offer.<br />
I mean more and better jobs, more opportunities for<br />
Australians of this and future generations, more security<br />
for all Australians.<br />
At the same time, as we take up the challenge of<br />
contemporary change we are determined to do all we can to<br />
solve those problems which governments have neglected for<br />
generations. We do these things because it is consistent with the<br />
Labor Party's commitment to social justice. We also do<br />
them because it makes sense.<br />
It makes sense, for instance, to deliver justice to<br />
indigenous Australians because this country will gain in<br />
respect and self-esteem, and in time it will gain from<br />
bringing into the mainstream people whose talents and<br />
energy have until now been wasted on the margins. </p>
<p>Equally, it makes sense to ensure that the half of the<br />
population who are women are in no sense left on the<br />
margins the margins of society, the margins of justice,<br />
or the margins of our representative institutions.<br />
Every time we expand Australian democracy, every time we<br />
extend the limits of freedom and justice, every time we<br />
include in all the reaches of our national life all the<br />
people of Australia, we make it stronger.<br />
When we talk about women sharing power in Australia it is<br />
a sufficient argument to say that it is " just" but it<br />
is an irrefutable argument to say that it is both just<br />
and, because it is in the interests of Australia, also<br />
very wise.<br />
Thank you for having me here. It is now my pleasure and<br />
privilege to declare this conference open. </p>
