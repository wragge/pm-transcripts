SPEECH BlY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
AT THE HANDOVER CEREMONY Or THE YOUNG ENDEAVOUR<br />
SYDNEY MONDAY 25 JAUARY, 1988<br />
I thank you, Sir John Leahy, for your generous remarks.<br />
And I am delighted to respond to your invitation to accept,<br />
on behalf of the government and people of Australia, this<br />
magnificent Bicentennial gift from the government and people<br />
of the United Kingdom.<br />
This ship the YugEndeavour bears a name imperishably<br />
linked with CpanCook's great voyage of discovery.<br />
And the name itself expresses a great deal of our aspirations<br />
for our country..<br />
This magnificent gift is a fitting tribute to the maritime<br />
history of our two countries.<br />
It is a timely reminder of the sea links that were for so<br />
many years the only lines of communication between Australia<br />
and the rest of the world.<br />
The Young Endeavour will enable the Australian government to<br />
provieteyutof Australia with an opportunity to<br />
experience an adventure under sail.<br />
We have created the Young Endeavour Youth Scheme to<br />
administer and manage an exciting program.<br />
The Youth scheme will allocate berths to the States and<br />
Territories who will select the young people to fill the<br />
berths. There will be an equal number of places for young men and<br />
women. Steps will be taken to ensure disadvantaged youth are well<br />
represented and there will be special arrangements for<br />
disabled youth. 00408t9 </p>
<p>The Royal Australian Navy will operate the ship and in a<br />
normal year of operations it is intended to carry out 23<br />
ten-day voyages with an embarked youth crew of 24.<br />
It is with pleasure that I announce today that the first<br />
chairman of the Board of Management will be Mr Malcolm<br />
Kinnaicd of South Australia.<br />
Mr Kinnaird brings to the position a wealth of experience<br />
both in the business community and in the world of sailing.<br />
The Young Endeavour" Youth scheme will be an ongoing legacy of<br />
our Bicentennial Year.<br />
The government and people of Australia express gratitude to<br />
the government and people of Britain for their generosity.<br />
We pay tribute to the devotion and skills of the shipyard<br />
workers who built and fitted out the Young Endeavour.<br />
And I also extend out thanks and congratulations to the joint<br />
British and Australian crew which sailed the ship safely to<br />
our shores.<br />
I am delighted to have this opportunity to reiterate, in<br />
person, the thanks I'have already expressed to Sir Peter<br />
Gadsden, for the efforts of the Britain-Australia<br />
Bicentennial Committee.<br />
And to thank personally today Mr Arthur Weller and members of<br />
the Britain-Australia Bicentennial Schooner Trust.<br />
This gift is only part of Britain's enthusiastic<br />
participation in the Bicentenary a fitting tribute to a<br />
deep, unbroken relationship of 200 years.<br />
S. T. S. Young Endeavour now enters service in Australia, a<br />
reminder of our maritime background but more importantly a<br />
testament to the enduring friendship between our two<br />
countries. 0 0 40<br />

AUSTRALIA DAY<br />
SYDNEY OPERA HOUSE<br />
26 jAkIuARY 1908<br />
Your Excellencies<br />
Your Royal Highnesses<br />
Premiers of the States of the Commonwealth of Australia<br />
Distinguished Guests<br />
Ladies and gentlemern<br />
we begin these celebrations in no spirit of boastfulness or<br />
national self-glorification.<br />
This is a day of commemoration.<br />
Even more important, it is a day of commitment.<br />
Commemoration of the past commitment to the future.<br />
But, my fellow Australians, today I use the word " commitment"<br />
in a special sense.<br />
For, our commitment to Australia is, in a very real way# the<br />
quality which best defines what it means to be an Australian<br />
in 1988.<br />
For, let us ask ourselveso on this day of all days:<br />
what is it that links us, in our generation, with the<br />
generations which have gone before?<br />
It is not only the fact that, for the past 200 years, and to<br />
this day, we have been a nation of Immigrants.<br />
It is not only the fact that we share together this vast<br />
continent as our homeland.<br />
it is not only the shared inheritance of all that has been<br />
built here, and achieved here, over the past 200 years.<br />
And it is not only the common bond of institutions,<br />
standards, language and culture. 00409.1 </p>
<p>2.<br />
Indeed, in today's Australia, our very diversity is an ever<br />
growing source of the richness, vitality and strength of our<br />
comumuni ty.<br />
it is true that all these things I have mentioned go to shape<br />
the Australian character and define the Australian identity.<br />
Yet beyond them, there remains one vital factor in the ansiwer<br />
to the question; Who is an Australian?<br />
And that factor is: A commitment to Australia and its<br />
future. It is that common commitment which binds the Australian-born<br />
of the seventh or eighth generation and all those of their<br />
fellow-Australians born in any of the 130 countries from<br />
which our people are drawn.<br />
in Australia, there is no hierarchy of descents there must be<br />
no privilege of origin.<br />
The commitment is all.<br />
The commitment to Australia is the one thing needful to be a<br />
true Australian.<br />
Today, at ' this historic place and at this historic hour, let<br />
us renew that commitment, our commitment to Australia and<br />
Australia's cause the cause of freedom, fairness, justice<br />
and peace. 004092 </p>
