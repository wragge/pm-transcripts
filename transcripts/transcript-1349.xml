Press Statement by The Rt. Hon J. McEwen, Acting Prime Minister<br />
and Minister for Trade and Industry<br />
Mr. McEwen today commended the decision of Lines in the<br />
U. K./ Continent Conference to further rationalize their service in<br />
this trade. " Any reduction in transit time for goods, with a consequent<br />
holding back of shipping costs, could only benefit the competitive<br />
position of Australian exports in Australia's most important market<br />
area", Mr. McEwen said.<br />
The Minister also cited the decision as an example of the<br />
benefits of a closed conference system which worked in close co-operation<br />
with a representative shipper body, assisted by Government resea j<br />
and analysis. In this case, " Mr. McEwen said," negotiations between the<br />
Shipping Lines and the Shippers were greatly assisted by the initiative<br />
of the Department of Trade Industry, which produced its " computer study"<br />
in 1964. This study, designed and implemented by the Department of Trade<br />
Industry and the Bureau of Census and Statistics, not only measured the<br />
possible savings of such an operation, but also established the feasibility<br />
cf scheduling the Conference fleet on a rationalized basis so as to lift<br />
all available cargoes on a regular basis".<br />
He anticipated that the implementation of the scheme would call<br />
for the fullest co-operation from alL bodies engaged in liner cargo<br />
shipping. He said that Australian exporters should welcome these new<br />
efforts to contain the rising costs of overseas shipping, while recognisin,<br />
that some adjustments to their traditional arrangements might be<br />
necessary. Mr. McEwen also expressed his belief that this was the first<br />
occasion that this technique had been used to ensure a co-operative<br />
attack on conference shipping costs under normal commercial conditions.<br />
" Clearly, Australian exporters to other areas and shipping lines<br />
servicing those exporters will be watching this new move to improve<br />
conference efficiency with keen interest," the Minister concluded.<br />
