PRIME MINISTER<br />
OR PRESS LOCAL GOVERNMENT DEPUTATION<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, the Rt. Hon. William M~ cMahon,<br />
CH, MP<br />
The Prime minister, Mr McMahon, today received a<br />
deputation from the Australian Council of Local Government Associations<br />
comprising the President of the Australian Council of Local Government<br />
Associations, Councillor A. A. Mills ( Western Australia) the<br />
Past and incoming President, Councillor H. G. Behan, CMG, MBE<br />
( Queensland) and the Secretary of the Association, Mr N. T. G. Miles.<br />
The deputation was introduced to the Prime Minister<br />
by the Hon. Bob Katter, Minister for the Army and Chairman of the<br />
Canberra Committee on Local Government, and Senator G. Davidson,<br />
Secretary of the Canberra Committee.<br />
The Prime Minister told the deputation that he was<br />
impressed by moves in the United States to restore more authority<br />
to government at the grass roots level.<br />
As life in the cities became increasingly complex<br />
and populations grew, local government authorities would have to<br />
play an increasir4y larger part in improving the quality of life,<br />
particularly with regard to recreational, sporting and cultural<br />
matters, in addition to other traditional responsibilities.<br />
The Prime Minister expressed his specific concern<br />
for the problems of local government, particularly in relation to<br />
their prestige, authority and responsibility.<br />
The Prime Minister recalled that at the recent Loan<br />
Council meeting, the limit on local government borrowings without<br />
the approval of the Loan Council had been raised from $ 300,000<br />
to $ 400,000. This was a recent and clear indication of the<br />
Federal Government's concern for local government and it was hoped<br />
that this liberalisation would improve the range of local government<br />
activities. The Prime Minister also indicated to the deputation that<br />
he would like to see local government represented at the forthcoming<br />
Constitutional convention. He confirmed that he would strongly<br />
support the attendance of local government authorities at the<br />
proposed Constitutional convention. / 2 </p>
<p>Councillor Mills, on behalf of the Australian Council,<br />
expressed appreciation that the Prime Minister had been able to<br />
meet the deputation at short notice. It was the first time in more<br />
than two decades that national representatives of local government<br />
had been received by the Prime Minister.<br />
While the deputation recognised that state Governments had<br />
the responsibility for local governments, it nevertheless felt that<br />
the Prime Minister should himself be aware of the tremendous<br />
pressure on local government for increases in services and amenities.<br />
Councillor Mills informed the Prime Minister that the<br />
Australian Council was nreparinq a pamphlet setting out the current<br />
requirements of local government. When this was complete, it would<br />
be personally presented to every canditate in the coming Federal<br />
elections by Mayors and Shire Presidents.<br />
Councillor Mills emphasised that, while the Australian<br />
Council was a non-political body, it believed it was necessary that<br />
its message be understood by all sections of opinion.<br />
Councillor Mills also emphasised that the deputation did not<br />
in any way seek to infrinqe on procedural matters prior to a.<br />
Constitutional convention, but it believed it should take the<br />
opportunity to express its fundamental views when meeting the Prime<br />
M-inister. Councillor Mills said the deputation had been impressed<br />
by the fact that during the discussions, the Prime Minister himself,<br />
had taken the initiative in expressing his specific concern for<br />
the problems of local government.<br />
Mr. Katter said at the conclusion of the discussion he<br />
hoped that now that a dialogue had been opened, it would introduce<br />
a new era of too level contact between the Federal Government and<br />
local government.<br />
