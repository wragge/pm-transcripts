PRIME MINISTER<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING, MP<br />
JTUSTICE WOOD EXPOSES JOHN FAHEY<br />
The interim report of the by Mr Justice James Wood, the Police Royal Commissioner<br />
in New South Wales, provides ample reason why John Fahey, the former Premier of<br />
New South Wales, should not be elected to the House of Representatives.<br />
As Premier, John Fahey did everything possible to prevent the Royal Commission from<br />
being established. When the former independent UP in New South Wales, John<br />
Hatton, proposed it, John Fahey's line was that the Independent Commission Against<br />
Corruption ( ICAC), was the best equipped body to deal with corrupt police.<br />
As yesterday's Sydney Morning Herald reports, Mr Fahey told the New South Wales<br />
Parliament in May 1994 that the Police Service should be allowed to get on with the<br />
job. He said that it was " not in the best interests of this State" to suggest that endemic<br />
corruption existed in the New South Wales police force.<br />
Mr Justice Wood's interim report proves precisely the opposite endemic corruption<br />
does exist in the New South Wales police and ICAC has failed to prevent it.<br />
John Fahey's successor as leader of the Coalition in New South Wales, Peter Collins,<br />
has endorsed the Royal Commissioner's interim findings.<br />
John Fahey is a failed Premier of New South Wales.-The Liberal Party is doing no<br />
favours to the people of Mlacarthur by seeking to send this faure to Canberra.<br />
