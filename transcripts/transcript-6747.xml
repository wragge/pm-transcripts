J.,,_ ASTRA1(<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 27 September 1985<br />
My attention has been drawn to a statement issued by the<br />
Leader of the Opposition which claims that I " wilfully<br />
misled" the Parliament in the tabling on 19 September of<br />
some documents relating to the Australian Bicentennial<br />
Authority. At their most generous interpretation, the~ claims are<br />
extraordinarily inisconceived, and at worst, they are<br />
deliberately misrepresentative of the situation as the<br />
Leader of the Opposition knows it.<br />
It was never claimed that the documents which I tabled were<br />
exhaustive. I did not claim so. In fact, it is clear<br />
from my statement to the House that they related only to<br />
correspondence between myself and Mr Reid and departmental<br />
advice regarding authority for the settlement.<br />
As for the record ( 5f the conversation which I had with Mr<br />
Reid on 15 August, that document aas tlhc. subj. 2t of<br />
consultation with the Leader of the Opposition in the<br />
Chamber subsequent to tabling, because it had been tabled in<br />
error. This consultation related to the deletion of a<br />
segment of the record relating to a personal matter. The<br />
Leader of the Opposition agreed with the deletion, as. tbe<br />
media is aware.<br />
He understood it was tabled in error, yet now accuses me of<br />
wilfully misleading the Parliament by omitting to table a<br />
second page of the relevant document.<br />
If the document was tabled in error in the first place, it<br />
can hardly be a deliberate omission to fail to table the<br />
second page.<br />
The Leader of the Opposition also claims that the " omitted"<br />
section " recorded ( my) instruction to Mr Reid to secure Dr<br />
Armstrong's resignation". What that section reiterated was<br />
that all of the views expressed regarding Dr Armstrong could<br />
a YJ </p>
<p>not be put aside, and so the matter should be looked at,<br />
with very serious consideration being given to finding a<br />
replacement. This is entirely consistent with the text of<br />
my detailed answer in the House of that day.<br />
Furthermore, nothing of what I said on 15 August to Mr Reid<br />
can in any way be seen as an " instruction" 6As I said in my<br />
press release of 11 September and in the Parliament, I<br />
simply did not have the power to " instruct" the Chairman of<br />
the Authority in this matter. Mr Reid accepted this at all<br />
points in our discussions. That has been one of the central<br />
problems with this matter, because the previous coalition<br />
government estabjished the Authot-ity deliberately at arm's<br />
length from the responsible minister, severely inhibiting<br />
the control that the minister is able to exercise over it.<br />
I have tried at all times to handle the whole subject of<br />
Australia's bicentenary celebrations in a bipartisan<br />
fashion. That is why I discussed the matter at length with<br />
the Leader of the Opposition, and it is why I arranged for<br />
the Leader of the Opposition to discuss the matter freely<br />
himself with Mr Reid as then Chairman of the Authority.<br />
The Leader of the Opposition's own handling of this matter<br />
has been shabby and cheap. It is certainly unbecoming of<br />
one who sets himself up so asserti., ely and sanctimoniously<br />
as " honest".<br />
I attach the complete record of conversation, except for the<br />
deletion agreed to by the Leader of the Opposition on 19<br />
September. </p>

RECORD OF COhKVERSATION BETWEEN PRIME MINISTER AND<br />
CHAIRMAN OF ABA, MR JOHN REID, ON 15 AUGUST, 1985.<br />
The Prime Minister said that he had received a number of<br />
expressions of concern regarding the performance of<br />
Dr David Armstrong, the Chief Executive of the ABA, and<br />
indeed there had been a unaminity of view regarding his<br />
inadequacies in this position. It had been put to him<br />
that the prospects of success for the Bicentenary<br />
celebrations were likely to be substantially compromised<br />
if Dr Armstrong remained as Chief Executive.<br />
Mr Reid put forward his reasons for believing that<br />
Dr Armstrong should be retained. At the same time he<br />
acknowledged problems, in Dr Armstrong's performance,<br />
including a rather informal style of administration<br />
inappropriate to the ABA, and a basic shyness, which<br />
tended towards aggressiveness and was reflected in the.<br />
use of throw-away lines in Board meetings. Mr Reid said<br />
that he had already spoken to Dr Armstrong as a number<br />
of questions had previously been raised about his<br />
peformance. As a result he felt that Dr Armstrong's<br />
administrative style had imoroved, Essentially<br />
Mr Reid felt that the interests of the ABA and the<br />
Bicentenary would be prejudiced if Dr Armstrong was<br />
replaced. He also could not support the idea of putting<br />
in a " minder" for Dr Armstrong. Mr Reid said that from<br />
the end of 1985 he himself would be virtually a<br />
full-time Chairman, making it easier to address the<br />
problem. IN CONFIDENCE </p>
<p>The Prime Minister said that while he respected<br />
Mr Reid's defence, he could not put aside all of the<br />
views put to him concerning Dr Armstrong, and so he<br />
would want the matter to be looked at, with very serious<br />
consideration being given to the question of finding a<br />
replacement. Mr Reid promised to get back to the<br />
Prime Minister on this matter by the following Monday,<br />
19 Aug4st.<br />
