STRICT EMBARGO UNTIL DELIVERY o-<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR PRESS 30 MARCH 1978<br />
1978 SIR ROBERT MENZIES LECTURE<br />
I am honoured by the invitation you have extended to me to<br />
deliver this inaugural lecture in recognition of one of my<br />
most distinguished predecessors in office.<br />
I congratulate the Monash University Liberal Club for their<br />
initiative in establishing this Annual Lecture.<br />
I am sure, over the years, it will add significantly to<br />
discussion of great national issues, and thus to the ability<br />
of this University to be a forum for the free exchange of<br />
ideas. The free. exchange of ideas in an atmosphere of tolerance and<br />
a critical openness to different views and perspectives is<br />
the ultimate rationale of a university. It is this openness<br />
to ideas that has made it possible for universities to<br />
contribute to social progress.<br />
As with all the great institutions of a liberal democracy<br />
the freedom the university offers will on occasion be abused<br />
by a minority of authoritarians.<br />
Authoritarians who seek to impose their views on others not<br />
by the weight of argument, but by disruption, by violence,<br />
and by denying the freedom of others to speak.<br />
These minorities who seek to silence others by their actions<br />
corrode the very foundations of the university. They threaten<br />
what is the only basis of the university as an intellectual<br />
community, a common commitment to freedom. " Freedom to<br />
learn, freedom to teach, freedom to enquire, freedom to<br />
express." I am reminded of an earlier occasion on which I was invited<br />
to deliver a formal address at a Victorian university.<br />
The occasion was the 1971 Alfred Deakin Lecture at the<br />
University of Melbourne. I recall that I was introduced by<br />
Sir Robert himself. / 2 </p>
<p>Hie spoke that night, with the rare corm-bination of insight,<br />
eloquence and wit for which lie is renoi-med, of the importance<br />
of a continuift-4-arnd vital debate on the principles of the<br />
great liberal traaition of which we are the inheritors.<br />
This was a debate which he had in large partreviived in<br />
this country in the 1940' s through his weekly radio talks<br />
to the nation during the dark years of war, and after the<br />
war in a series of-speeches defining the spirit of liberalism.<br />
it was not only Sir Robert's singular achievement at that<br />
tinie-tG-lead the formnation of the Ausatralian Liberal Party,_<br />
he also instilled in the new Party a coherent, rational and<br />
relevant liberal philosophy. A philosophy w~ hich continues<br />
to sustain and guide the Liberal Party to this day.<br />
one of its basic credos the credo that guided M4enzies from<br />
his-earliest years, the credo to which he returned -time and<br />
time again is the Rule of Law, and justice under law.<br />
The principle of the Rule of Law formed the basis of an<br />
essay by Sir Robert Menzies which, as far as I am aware,<br />
was the first of~ bis major writings to be published.<br />
This was the Bowen Prize Essay writfe-by Sir Robert in 1917,.<br />
his final year as a 2aw student, and entitled nThe Rule of'<br />
Law Duri~ ng the war".<br />
Sir Robert was later to define the relationship between the<br />
Rule of Law and freedom in a memorable passage in one of.<br />
his wartime radio talks. The security. provided by the-iule<br />
of Law, Sir Robert said, is such security as your<br />
opponents being in a majority may concede you; it is not<br />
something precariously dependent on the whim of a mob;<br />
it is that security to which a mnan maay confidently and<br />
calmly appeal even though every man's hand may be against<br />
him; the&amp; TM-w's greatest benefits are for the minority man<br />
the individual..."<br />
Tonil1it I wish to speak of the Rule of Law and in particular<br />
the threat posed to it by the increasing emergence of terrorist<br />
violence. The doctrine that we have knovm-since Dicey as the Rule of.<br />
Law, is, no doubt, familiar t,% o most of you.<br />
it received its first expression in the historic document we<br />
know as the Hagna Carta in 1215, which remains part of the<br />
law o-f-Australia. to this day.<br />
A king sought to extort money contrary to the Law and was<br />
compe3:+ ed by his barons to enter into an historic undertaking,<br />
guaranteeing freedom under the Law, and the due administration*<br />
of justice. / 3 </p>
<p>So fundamental is this doctument that it is Worth recalling<br />
the words of two mnemrable passages from it:-<br />
" No man shall be taken, disseizei, outlawed, banished, or in<br />
any way destroyed, nor will we proceed against him or<br />
prosecute him, except by the lawful judgemnent of his peers<br />
and by the law of the land",, and " To none will we sell, to<br />
no one will we delay or deny right or justice".<br />
The antithesis of the Rule of Law is on the one hand<br />
-arbitrary authoritarian power; overnm~ ent above the Law;<br />
and, on the other hand, anarchy, the arbitrary defiance by<br />
citizens of the LaW.<br />
The Rule of Law, in which justice is impartially administered*<br />
and enforced is an e-sential prerequisite of individual<br />
freedora.<br />
Witbout it, there is licence only for the powerfor few to<br />
impose their will on the mah-y.<br />
There is a paradox~ in the proposition that freedom<br />
involves some-t~ onstraints, but it is only -m-apparent paradox.-<br />
our freedom can only be real if we are protected by the Law<br />
from others -v~ elating our liberty.<br />
E. ven in liberal democracies there is an irreducible mninimui<br />
of constraint--without which society cannot-fm ction.<br />
The Law imposes certaini restraints and obligations on each<br />
of us., for the enhancement of the-liberty of -our fell~ ow<br />
members of society and of ourselves.<br />
It _ isLthe protection which the law-affords us, both from<br />
our neighbours and our rulers, that enables the very best<br />
features of our open society to flouxish. The Rule of'Law<br />
__ confers freedom it does-not diminish it.<br />
The words of Magna Carta have ruled the life of our Socie ty.<br />
It is still tha.. jistinctive mark of our system that counsel<br />
may interrupt the business of the court with the words<br />
" Your Honour, I have a matter involving the liberty of the<br />
subject". The principle of the Rule of Law is also fundamental to<br />
American democr-y. it is sumnarized in the fourteenth<br />
amendment to the U. S. constitution, which provides that no<br />
State shall "~ deprive any person of life, liberty or property<br />
without due process of law, nor deny to any person within<br />
its jurisdictio n the equal protection of the laws".<br />
It is the Rule of Law, sumumed up in the twin principles of<br />
" due process" and-" equal protection" that have formed the<br />
basis of some of the greatest advances in civil rights and<br />
liberties in that country. 4 </p>
<p>4.<br />
Throughout this century, scholars have repeatedly drawn<br />
attention to the concerted attacks which have been made on<br />
the Rule of Law.<br />
As a doctrine, the Rule of Law is of course, anathema to<br />
the traditional enemies of democracy, and to the host of<br />
others who have aligned themselves against the open society.<br />
But within Liberal democracies, the Rule of Law has also<br />
faced stern challenges from other quarters.<br />
For the first half of this century, the attack of the<br />
Rule of Law was seen to come from what one writer has<br />
termed, the " Omnipotence of Government".<br />
Greater government intervention in all aspects of society's<br />
affairs has compelled a fundamental change in the-role of<br />
the individual and Parliament.<br />
The sheer weight of administration has forced Pari* aent<br />
to delegate more and more effective power to bureaucrats who<br />
are not responsible to the electorate, and who sometimes<br />
appear to exercise such power in an arbitrary manne-.-<br />
In a memorable statement, Lord Chief J. stice Hewart in 1929<br />
denounced this development as the " new despotism".--<br />
In his view, a monolithic bureaucracy armed with wideranging<br />
and loosely defined powers to affect the rights of<br />
individual citizens undermined the Rule of Law and subverted<br />
basic democratic principles.<br />
The essay Sir Robert Menzies published in 1917 was, in fact,<br />
a study of the many infringements of the Rule of Law by an<br />
all-powerful government during the First World War.--<br />
He conceded that such measures as internment without trial,<br />
press censorship, compulsory acquisition without compensation<br />
and retrospective acts of indemnity, might be justified in<br />
wartime for the defence of the realm if they were temporary<br />
and unavoidable.<br />
But he foresaw the great danger to society if such measures<br />
continued after hostilities had ended.<br />
This was a theme he was to take up again for he was to fight<br />
strongly, and, in the end successfully, against the continuation<br />
in peacetime of special regulatory measures imposed during<br />
the Second World War. The challenge of arbitrary bureaucratic<br />
power to our liberal ideals has not lessened, but governments<br />
are now taking firmer action to protect the individual<br />
citizen against its worst excesses.<br />
In the past three years, the Commonwealth Government has<br />
reformed federal administrative law in an endeavour to enhance<br />
the rights of individuals adversely affected by bureaucratic<br />
decisions. The Administrative Appeals Tribunal has commenced<br />
operations. The Commonwealth Ombudsman has now been at<br />
work for almost a year. Legislation was passed last year<br />
to simplify procedures for judicial review of administratIve<br />
decisions. And a Security Appeals Tribunal is to be established. </p>
<p>An Ad-inistrative Review Council has been. set up to keep<br />
under continuing review-the adequacy of existing proc. Pdares<br />
which provide citizens with redress for genuine grievances..<br />
In recent years, the threat to the Rule of Law in liberalsocieties<br />
has been seen to come from another quarter. It<br />
has been claimed that such societies may suffer not so much<br />
from the omnipotence of government, as from the threat of<br />
government impotence.<br />
We all know a liberal demnoacy such as ours can only<br />
function effectively if there is tolerance a-nd respect for<br />
others; a preference for moderation and restraint, for<br />
reasonable deciej~ ons, arrived at by reasonablQ... eas,.. a<br />
willingness to abide by the Law.<br />
The effectiveness of the law, and thus the pr~ otection of<br />
Liberty can be underminea by a widespread acceptance of the<br />
view -that an individual is entitled to disobey any law-he<br />
finds disagreeable.<br />
There are situations in totalitarian societies where conscience<br />
and* hxnnanitS
authorization of cierociae during the S -cond World War is an;: Z-.<br />
obvious example.<br />
But the attitude that one can pick and chose which Laws to<br />
comtply with in a dem~ ocratic society based on freedom and<br />
respect for the individual: where procedures do ex. ist for<br />
the peaceful repeal or arendr--nt of laws is corrosive of<br />
the very liberal ideal~ s on which such a society is founded.<br />
should a general attitude 6-fdisregard for the law grow to<br />
a sufficient extent, the ultimate result could be the total<br />
breakdown of the Rule of Law and the collapse of democratic<br />
government; the collapse of-T-eedom; the collapse of civil<br />
liberties.<br />
-The opponents of the open sortety are only too well aware<br />
of this possibility. But it is the modern political terrorist,<br />
whose barbarity has once again been so manifest in recent<br />
-weeks in turope and the Middre-East, who has become the most<br />
sinister practitioner of a new tyranny.<br />
Hie sees texror as a mst potent method of-precipitating the<br />
collapse of liberal society. He resorts to violence to gain<br />
political ends by fostering fear, anxiety and disorientation.<br />
His methods have always been a source of-the deepest concern<br />
to civilized society. The threat of souial dissolution which<br />
terrorism has engendered the potential of terrorism to turn<br />
society into a war of all against all, has bie-n recognized<br />
by governments throughout history. But it is open liberal<br />
societies societies based on the Rule of Law, the concern<br />
for individual rights, freedom of association.. and communication<br />
that have a peculiar vulnerability to terrorism.<br />
The reason for this is very clear they are-the very antithes.: is<br />
of authoritarian and totalitarian regimes that maintain<br />
themselves by rigidly controlling their society and repressing<br />
any sign5 of dissent. Paradoxically social-a-nd technological<br />
progress has provided political terrorists with unprecedented<br />
opportunities for disruption. </p>
<p>The 1sixtlias-f and ' seventies" have seen the revival and<br />
proliferation of small, fanatic terrorist elements<br />
dedicated to blackmrail aiid violence, seekiriq to strike at<br />
the 1heart ol-open societies.<br />
in the last five years alone the world has seen 1,800 major<br />
acts of tefr-6ri&amp;-n arouind the world involving 152 deaths,<br />
551 injuries, 363 kidnappings, $ 146 million in ransom and<br />
$ 92 million in bom~ b aamages,<br />
During 1976 more incidents of international terrorism were<br />
recorded than in any previous year and although most<br />
incidents oft-nternational terrorism have so far occurred<br />
in Western Biirope, the Middle East, or L" atin Am'erica our<br />
region h~ as, not escaped.<br />
In the last four years we have seen the asault by Japanese<br />
R~ ed Army terrorists on the oil refinery at Singapore, the<br />
seizure of the-Israeli Embassy in Bangkok, the seizure of<br />
the Aierican Consulate in X( uala Ltumpur, the hi-jacking or'<br />
a Japanese aircraft from Bombay to Dacca and a series of<br />
attacks and t! 1 eats against diplomiats in the region,<br />
incluaing some in Australia.<br />
The tragic ev-t which occurred ouitside the Sydney Hilton<br />
Hotel on 13 February is of a pattern with these acts of<br />
international terrorism, But while this was, without doubt,<br />
the most appal-lingj incident of its kind in our history,<br />
violence is by no means a new phenomenon in this country.<br />
If we are wil-l-ng to see reality as it is and not as we would<br />
like it to be we have to recognise that the history of our<br />
ownm society is rtot free of violent acts.<br />
In the last fifteen years there have been more than forty<br />
incidents involving the use of explosives.<br />
Preliminary assessments for 1977 are that international* act' 9<br />
of terrorism continued at a very high level and the latest<br />
studies of internations-Lterrorismf disclose some especially.<br />
disturbing trends.<br />
The number of terrorist groups continue to multiply. These<br />
relkatively small trained, mobile violent b-odies have no<br />
shortage of arms, training facilities or finances.<br />
They have dex~ e-Ybped world-wide links whichrmit them to<br />
cooperate in planning and executing terrorist outrages and<br />
technological progress, the revolution in commu~ unication, jet.<br />
transport and weaponry have provided these groups with<br />
unprecedented opporttinities for disruption.<br />
it is clear that political terrorism will xemvain with us and<br />
may come to pose ever nore serious threats to our open society,<br />
our values and way of life.<br />
There are many varieties of terrorists. There are terrorists<br />
of the left and of the right. There are terrorists attracted<br />
by-the act of violence as an end in itself. / 7 </p>
<p>Their grotesque aestheticism is exemplified by a Nineteenth<br />
Century French anarchist, who askedc -of what imnportance are<br />
the victims when the gesture is so beautiful?"<br />
There are the terrorists who resort tLLo terror not merely<br />
for its symbolic or dramatic effect but to achieve-a<br />
atm... For inistance, to qai" n publicity, to obtain<br />
money or the release of prisoners, or to secure the<br />
recoqition of a nationalist or separatist qrievarrce.<br />
There are some who resort to tCerror as a means of bringing<br />
about violent and revoluitionary chartge in society<br />
This kind of terrorist hopes to discredit legitimate<br />
governments by using terror to destroy the fundamentalconsensus<br />
between government and people on which open societies<br />
depend. indeed, Carlos marighela, a leader of the modern urban guerrilla<br />
vftovement, openly declared that the rolq of the terrorist-was<br />
to make life " unbearable" for ordinary~ people so 1that-th . y<br />
would tu-rn against their governments.<br />
All varieties of t%. errorists are to be condemned. Terrorism<br />
constiti~ es a systematic ass-aulton the most fundamental<br />
Mh m hn i gt Sthe<br />
right to live in a physically secure environment an&amp; tlh&amp;<br />
right to hold contrary views.<br />
Just as + the'tyrannies throughout history h + ave sought by--every means<br />
to impose their unrestricted will on the people. Political<br />
terrorists seek to impose their will on societies by all forms<br />
of blacloail, intf. imidation, and violence.<br />
Terrorists reject the right of others to hold contrary views.,<br />
reject the political and democratic methods of solving differences<br />
and conflicts; reject the Rule of Law and the social and legal<br />
codes which regulate political conflict and provide the<br />
structure for political orderi reject the politics of toleranrce<br />
and democracy.<br />
They reject the means by which open societies rule themselves<br />
through election, representation, discussion, debate,<br />
negotiation and consensus. The terrorist is an extremist<br />
obsessed by his own ideas, ready to use arty Tmeanst-impervious<br />
to moral scrutiny, criticism or restraint.<br />
Hie draws no distinction between targets and victims. There are<br />
neither innocents nor neutrals. In his eyes no one is tztlea<br />
to personal security, pctrsonal liberty or to any other form. of<br />
civil right, </p>
<p>It is tragic that the twisted world xziew advanced by<br />
terrori-Et-sometimes enjoys the tacit approval of some<br />
intellectual circles. So much so that these circles axe<br />
disposed, in pursuing the vanities of intellectual fashion,<br />
to condone the cd6Thrupt, to forgive the unforgiveable..<br />
The transparent myths manufactured by terrorists and the<br />
-apologists for their crimes against humanity are readily<br />
exposed and discredited. They assert, for instance, that<br />
terrorists are " sincere idealists". " Idenlists" who take<br />
the law into t8-heifi7on hands? Who commit acts of horrific<br />
violence? Who exploit brutality and humnan suffering?<br />
As Paul Jitmr son has remfarked: " No political cau. se if worth<br />
the abandoning of elementary morality..."; " Terrorism is.<br />
always and in every circumsbance wrong, it is intrinsically<br />
*-rng, it is the antithesis of political idealism".<br />
Again, they assert that the terrorist represents anfd acts on<br />
behalf of " the people". This assertion is false. The*<br />
truth is that democratic anxd open soci~ ties have been the<br />
prime targets for terrorist attacks.<br />
It is the tolerance and open i4nstitutions of democratic<br />
societies which actually provide the terrorists viith the best:<br />
opportunity-and the freedcom to launch their attacks.<br />
There will always be differences and conflicts in any society;<br />
sorme genui-nz--and some generation or manipulated by the enemies<br />
of open societies and free governments-But democratic and<br />
open societies allow for the representation of grievances.<br />
They do not . Merely recognize the right to dissent and the<br />
obligation to correct injustices bit are com ittea to the<br />
protection of peaceful dissent and the right to advocate social<br />
and political eforns.<br />
Disaffected elements and politically and culturally alienated<br />
groups who allege that " the system"' and our form of government<br />
are intolerable, unjust and repressive have every rigbt to,<br />
use the many legitimate and lawful procedures available to them<br />
to bring aboutChanqes in society. They do not have the right<br />
to take the law into their own hands-.<br />
Terrorist groflps are elitist minorities, lacking any political<br />
legitimacy or public support. Their-resort. to terror is<br />
conclusive proof of this.<br />
How should we in Australia respond to this new ' tyranny?<br />
Relative to some other countries, the plague of~ te-rrorism has<br />
not yet become,_ and hopefully will never become, part of our<br />
everyday life. .19 </p>
<p>Y~ t we would be worse than naive to think it impossible.<br />
There is no reason in our history to suggest that we are<br />
immune. Clearly we mrm-r never be caught off our gsd<br />
We m~ ust first and foremost take whatever measures are<br />
necessary to protect our citizens; to expose our citizens to<br />
dangers to their lives-, their liberty arnd their rights is<br />
an unthinkable and unacceptable option. Moreover, the<br />
inability of a democratic government to protect its citizens<br />
would not only lead to--their loss of faith in dantocrzcy buat<br />
it would unleash authoritarian forces and the very liberal<br />
ideals which the terrorists abhor would be the first victims.<br />
A government must fully perform the duty it owes its citizens<br />
to protect their lives. At the same time, governments must<br />
respond with conscience-en towards those who rejec-b--the<br />
society's valjes and seek the society's destruction.<br />
Our reactio -ns must alway--e guided by reason, good co"-science,<br />
and an ever-present i. nderstandingj of the values of Australian<br />
society.<br />
This governm~ ent has acted and will continue to act in ways<br />
which will both be effective and accord with the civil<br />
liberties which are fundamental to Australian society.-wbich<br />
are at t'-he heart of liberalism.<br />
The basic judgemnents of the-Royal. Corm~ issiofl on Intelligence<br />
and Security have been accepted and are being acted upon.<br />
Last month I outlined to thje Parliament several other . imnediate.<br />
actions which are being taken to improve security and improve<br />
coordination between the Commonwealth and the states in<br />
security matters.<br />
Mr. Justice Hope is to undert-ake a further enquiry on e3, isting<br />
protective security mieasures.<br />
Any legislation the Governument introduces, as a consequence of<br />
-the Hopep Enquiry or otherwise, will strike thebalance between<br />
-the need to respond decisire~ y to the threat of terrorigm--nd'-<br />
the imperative of -sustaining the democratic freedoms we hold<br />
-paraLM0O1rt. one of the terms of referenice of the Enquiry by Mr. Justice<br />
Hope, who is a former President of the Australian Council of<br />
Civil Liber-ties, is f" the overall balancing of the interests<br />
of security and the rights -orprivate citizens".<br />
There is also a clear need for the closest international<br />
cooperation to rid the world-of this political texrorismn.-Such<br />
collaboration may take many forms: pooling intelligence,<br />
denial of sanctuaries, cutiAng off sources of funds, tighter<br />
controls on shipments of expITodives and greater cooperationin<br />
monitoring the movements of suspects. </p>
<p>Australia is a party to all rajo Tternational conventionR<br />
designed to combat terrorism. Last year Aluttralia. gave effect<br />
to the latest of these which rendered acts against<br />
internationally protected persons, including visiting heads of<br />
government, ministers of state and foreign diplomats a<br />
special criminal offence.<br />
Australia has supported the International Atomic Energy<br />
Agency's proposal for a convention aimed at strengthening<br />
measures against any crimes invol~ v-xhg nuclear material or<br />
facilities. We are supporting a pro-pUal by' the Federal Republic of<br />
Germany for an international convention on the taking of<br />
hostages. At the recent Commonwealth Iesads of Government<br />
Regional Meeting in Sydney, the twelve heads of government<br />
agreed to collaborate more closely to counter toxrorism in<br />
our region.<br />
Ladies and Gentlemen, it is therefore -wlth total conviction<br />
that I state on behalf of the Government that: we will not<br />
appease those elements in-the national or international<br />
Coxñ amunity who conspire, by acts of terrorism to deny our<br />
people their rights, self-xespect and dignity; we will not<br />
siivcumb to the tyranny of self -appointed and unelected<br />
minorities who seek to inflict their will on the great majority<br />
of our people by intimidation, violence anid terrorism; we.<br />
wI-Ll not permit Australia to be-used as a haven for tezxrorist<br />
groups to plan and conduct operationp abroad.<br />
Terrorism anid the threat it poses to the Rule of Law, is not<br />
merely a problem for the Governmrent or the Police or the Army<br />
it-is* a problemnfor' society as a whole.'<br />
our free and open societies have demonstrated a great<br />
resistance to assaults against them. They enjoy one profound<br />
advantage over dictatorial regimeD; the unqualified support<br />
of the overwhelming majority of the people and their rejection<br />
of violence and terrorism.<br />
Th-ere Is perhaps no more potent deterrent to terrorist activities,<br />
and no more potent guarantee of detection of the perpetrators of<br />
terrorist outrages tha. the wholehearted and concerted.<br />
defe-Tiination of individual citizens to assist the Government<br />
in its implacable opposition to terrorists and all their works.<br />
