_ lB ' BP4 3FING FOR HEADS OF B UREAUX,<br />
PARLIAMENTARY PRESS GALLERY,<br />
C ANB'ER R A 1 APRIL, 1968<br />
PRIME MINISTER : You have all had copies of the statement, so there is<br />
no point in reading it over to you, so here I am. What would you<br />
like to ask about it?<br />
Q : Can you tell us what lay behind the President's<br />
statement. Any official or unofficial advice as to why he made<br />
this decision?<br />
PM: Nothing other than would appear on the surface of it<br />
that hie does hope that this will lead Hanoi to start entering into<br />
peace negotiations.<br />
Q. Is there anything to indicate that Hanoi might?<br />
PM: Nothing that I have seen, but It is after all, quite a<br />
gesture on the part of the United States.<br />
Q. At what stage were you informed, Sir, of the US plans<br />
for de-escalation?<br />
PM: Yesterday.<br />
Q. After you returned from New Zealand.<br />
PM: Yes. They were trying to get In touch with New Zealand<br />
but they missed me.<br />
Q. Did you see a full draft of this speech yesterday, Sir?<br />
PM: No, the State Department just sent out all the significant<br />
points that were to be covered but not the draft of the speech. No.<br />
Q. Did that Include his decision not to seek re-election?<br />
PM: Nc.<br />
Q. You learnt of this today?<br />
PM: Yes.<br />
Q. What Is your reaction to that, Sir?<br />
PM: Well I have got a brief statement that I have written<br />
out, but it is not yet typed, but I could have it typed and circulated.<br />
Here it is do hnot think it proper to comment on the decision<br />
taken by President Johnson not to seek re-election, other than<br />
to say that we in Australia will always remember with gratitude<br />
the warmth and special consideration which he has shown to us<br />
during his Presidency. e/ 2 </p>
<p>-2<br />
PM. ( Contd.) " He has had to bear immense burdens and make<br />
momentous decisions and carry the responsibility for<br />
those decisions and I believe he has made them<br />
on the basis of what he sincerely believed to be right,<br />
and to the ultimate benefit of freedomr Inside the United<br />
States and outside that country. He Is a great man.<br />
Q. You are satisfied, Mr Prime Minister, that this<br />
decision will hold and he won't go back on it?<br />
PM: On reading the words that he used, It seems to me<br />
that they come as close as it is possible to come to the words<br />
the previous American President used who was It Sherman, I<br />
think " I won't run, and if I am elected, I won't serve". It<br />
seemed to me that<br />
Q. It's final?<br />
PM: Well, I can only go on the words that he used, but<br />
they seemed to me to be very final words<br />
Q. Except for the reason he gave. The one reason<br />
I heard he gave was that he was so busy conduct ing the war In<br />
Viet Nam that he didn't have time to run an election campaign,<br />
which did seem to leave the door open a little bit for a draught.<br />
( Interjection) He said at a press conference afterwards it was<br />
on our four o'clock news that the decision was Irrevocable.<br />
PM: I can't comment other than on the words that he<br />
used and they seem to me to be perfectly finite words.<br />
Q. Mr Prime Minister, in your statement, you point<br />
out where this statement of President Johnson's is consistent with<br />
past American statements. In fact, this Is an entirely different<br />
break In policy as far as we are concerned. ' They have virtually<br />
unconditionally elected to cease the bombing. Did this particular<br />
move catch you by surprise or were -you -expecting, ttfrom -the<br />
political winds?<br />
PM: Now, let's analyse a little what you say bef ore I<br />
answer it, if you don't mind....<br />
Q. To put it more Simply, Sir, were you advised in<br />
advance of this major change of policy?<br />
PM: I was told yesterday of the points that were covered<br />
in the President's speech of today. If you will have read the text<br />
of the President's speech, he presents this as an advance on his<br />
San Antonio speech. In the San Antonio speech, he said: " We are<br />
prepared to stop the bombing of North Viet Nam as soon as we<br />
have an indication that North Viet Nam will enter into negotiations<br />
as a result". He has gone further than that, one step further than<br />
that by now saying, " Well, we will stop the bombing of most of<br />
North Viet Nam, even though we haven't got a previous indication<br />
that Hanoi will enter into peace negotiations, but we call on Ho<br />
Chi Minh to respond to this, and we call on the Co-Chairmen to<br />
ask Hanoi to respond to it. It is a further step. / 3 </p>
<p>-3<br />
Q. You wouldn'tcalLit a-major--change, then?<br />
PMK Well, I can only present to you the position as it Is<br />
offered -to. Hanoi in the initial statement: " We will stop bombing<br />
altogether as soon as you give us an indication that if we do, we<br />
will enter into ngtais. Then that statement shortly<br />
afterwards is expanded by another statement saying, " Of couirse, if<br />
we do this and we expect to enter into peace negotiations, we don't<br />
expect the North to take military advantage of it in a great build-up."<br />
But It would be reasonable to expect them to maintain the forces they<br />
have got there. This is a further step forward in that he is now not<br />
ceasing bombing, but ceasing bombing on a considerable area....<br />
Q. Less ruthless, shall we say?<br />
PM: Well, it Is closer to the battle area and more designed<br />
obviously to hinder flows of men and materials directly to the North<br />
where the fighting is taking place. B ut he is taking that extra step.<br />
Q. He also says, Sir, just to sort of get back to this<br />
. rhis is the first step in a series of de-escalating the war"...<br />
PM: He says It may be the first step In a series of<br />
de-escalations<br />
Q. We don't have the full text...<br />
PM and he hopes it will be the firs t step.<br />
Q. But it is a step towards de-escalation. This is the<br />
important break I was talking about. There have been a series of<br />
escalations military escalations and this is the first positive and<br />
recognis able military de-escalation as distinct from statements of<br />
what we would do or could do. They are actually doing something.<br />
Did that particular act ion take you by surprise?<br />
PM: You are claiming that previous bombing pauses which<br />
have taken place are not to be described as de-escalatlons because<br />
you know that America has stopped previously, and you wouldn't<br />
regard that as being a de-escalation?<br />
Q. They didn't call It that at the time.<br />
PM: No, but they did stop it. I think you should read the<br />
actual text of the statement which is that he hopes that this will lead<br />
to rapid peace talks and that they in turn will lead to increased<br />
de-escalation.<br />
Q : On this point this Is " Iffy" of course If nothing<br />
happened quickly, would you want the bombing to start again, because<br />
you say " We must all hope that this response is forthcoming quickly"<br />
PM: Well we hope -the response is forthcoming quickly<br />
because we hope that the peace talks will begin which is what we<br />
constantly wanted.<br />
Q. If nothing happens? / 4 </p>
<p>-4-<br />
PM: Well, I wouldn't know.<br />
Q. Will this make any difference to the talks ANZUS<br />
and SEATO are having?<br />
PM: I would think not. I would think It would have no<br />
bearing on them at all.<br />
Q. Sir, have you had any impression from America<br />
that if this doesn't lead to de-escalation, it doesn't work out the<br />
way the President hoped, it will resume bombing?<br />
PM: I have only got the text of the President's speech<br />
and the points which vare covered, and they don't extend into that<br />
area.<br />
Q. Sir, the request In the past to be kept Informed of<br />
any major change in policy in Viet Nam and the fact that your two<br />
Ministers on Tuesday and Thursday were obviously placed in the<br />
position that they went right on a limb on the thing, are there<br />
going to be any approaches that we be Informed of these things in<br />
the future?<br />
PM: Well, I think we have consistently made it clear,<br />
Indeed as late as the Governor-General's Spe~ ech, where it was<br />
said in unequivocal language that we would support any moves which<br />
were designed to lead to the opening of peace talks, and we expect<br />
those peace talks to lead to a real peace which, indeed, is clear.<br />
By " Peace", I ne an a just and enduring peace, and self-determination<br />
for the Vietnamese a real peace Indeed, the President's<br />
statement this time indicates that thisis what is being desired, and<br />
not something which he describes in his statement as a fake peace.<br />
Well we have consistently indicated that we wculd support those<br />
kinds of moves, and I think this is a move along that path.<br />
Q. Mr Prime Minister, doesn't it seem that the close<br />
consultation that we have always been told this Government has with<br />
the American Government wasn't in evidence this time?<br />
PM: I told you when we were informed of the points<br />
which were to be covered in the American speech, they weren't<br />
discussed with us before that time; but as I have pointed out, we<br />
have made it perfectly clear that we were prepared to support<br />
efforts to reach a genuine peace. This is a step further than the<br />
San Antonio speech. It is a step further. The San Antonio speech<br />
was speaking of ceasing bombing altogether, which I think you<br />
mentioned. This one mentions ceasing bombing in the highly<br />
populated areas, the food-producing areas, but retains it on the<br />
approaches to the military field, and it is therefore a cessation<br />
of bombing on significant areas of Viet Nam well, I have put<br />
it in this statement.<br />
Q. Prime Minister, are you likely to discuss this<br />
directly by telephone or any other way with Mr Johnson to get<br />
to his reasoning? You have indicated you only have the text<br />
of his speech as we have probably had it. </p>
<p>PM: Yes, well...<br />
Q. beic.. I thought you would probably-viant to know the reasons<br />
PM: Well the reasoning behind it, I think, appears quite<br />
clearly in the speech itself. Hle does hope that this will lead to a<br />
reaction from Hanoi, and that it will lead to the opening of peace<br />
talks. He expresses in his speech the hope that he will get a<br />
reaction from Hanoi in response to this gesture and that then the<br />
question could be open for discussion as to whether the areas that<br />
were being still to be bombed for military purposes could be<br />
also taken away from bombing, provided certain arrangements were<br />
made. And this Is the de-escalation of which you were talking...<br />
Q. Do you feel there is a necessity to ring him or to<br />
get our Ambassador in Washington to give you a background report<br />
or briefing on this?<br />
PM: Well I don't think it is necessary because I think the<br />
indication is there. When the State Department people told me the<br />
points that were to be covered, they indicated to me that this was<br />
a hope in the hope that this sort of thing would follow.<br />
Q. I presume you will discuss it with Dean Rusk during<br />
your talks with him later in the week, anyway?<br />
PM: I wouldn't necessarily say that I would or that I<br />
wouldnt. I will be discussing a whole range of matters with Dean<br />
Rusk.<br />
Q. You will have some background material from our<br />
Embassy in Washington, Sir, won't you, be fore tomorrow's<br />
Parliament?<br />
PM: Well, we have had some background material from<br />
Waller. You can't go much further, I don't think, than what I have<br />
told you. That is the background material and the background thinking<br />
to It.<br />
Q. What about the President's health? Do you know<br />
anything about that?<br />
PM: No, but Waller's views were the same as mine<br />
there was a question I was asked earlier as to the definiteness of<br />
this announcement of not standing and Waller's views were that<br />
he believed it was quite definite. Since then, there has been another<br />
thing I understand.<br />
Q. Sir, there are two alternatives in this either the<br />
North Vietnamese have indicated something or the Americans have<br />
made a definite change. You have indicated that this is a new step.<br />
PM: I indicated they had gwle one step further. Yes.<br />
Q. It's about stix weelG since I think Mr Rusk finally<br />
rejected the last Vietnamese statement.... / 6 </p>
<p>-6-<br />
PM: I don't know which one you are talking about, John.<br />
Q. It's about six weeks. Now, what is the new factor as<br />
you see it in the last six weeks which has influenced the president to<br />
make this, what we see as a new step?<br />
PM: I'm sorry, John, I don't know the statement of Rusk that<br />
you are talking about, but It was, I think, last August that the San<br />
Antonio steech was<br />
Q. Yes, then late in December, North Vietnamese<br />
Foreign Minister said something If you stop bombing, we'll talk.<br />
PM: Did he?<br />
Q. And it took until 14th February to investigate it and say<br />
that it wasn't bona fide. Now, in the six weeks sinco, we have a new<br />
factor to make a new step?<br />
PM: I don't have any information I haven't been given any<br />
by the External Affairs Department that the North Vietnamese have<br />
ever made the statement You stop bombing and we will talk.<br />
Rather I thought the statements had been Unless bombing is stopped,<br />
we won't talk.<br />
Q. Sir, you have indicated that you are quite happy with this.<br />
Some of your Ministers in the past have stro: ngly opposed any such move<br />
on the grounds....... as recently as last Thursday, the Defence<br />
Minister, Mr Fairhall, talking about bombir' North Viet Nam at large<br />
said that the only thing that made North Vic : am as a whole different<br />
from the demilitarized zone or Laos and Cambodia which were safe<br />
havens for the North Viet Nam troops, was tbh-bombing at large of<br />
North Viet Nam Have you discussed this them? Are their<br />
feelings still the same? Are they still opposed to this?<br />
PM: I haven't discussed the statement with Mr Fairhall.<br />
If you look at practically everything I have said on this matter, either<br />
in the Higgins by-election or in radio and television appearances, " Four<br />
Corners" and things of this kind, or indeed . gain, in the Governor-<br />
General's speech, or in New Zealand, you i'll see a consistent thread,<br />
I think, that we don't to destroy North Viet N'm, we don't want to<br />
destroy the North Vietnamese Government. V'e see the value of bombing<br />
as to try and hamper and hinder the flow of r. oops and materials from the<br />
North to the South and this is the significa:; we attach to it. Well that<br />
again, as this statement indicates, is now, to be sought to be done<br />
by bombing a smaller area than it was bc: That is still designed to<br />
try to prevent and we never claimed it di: l prev. ent but to make it<br />
difficult, to hamper the flow of men and m--' ri. ls, while at the same time<br />
freeing the large areas further north the danger of attack in<br />
the hope that that will lead to a postive respornco from Hanoi. Then it<br />
could go step by step if that happened. I think that was the reasoning<br />
behind it.<br />
Q. Sir, could you tell me, since you were informed yesterday,<br />
which Ministers have you discussed this with? Have you talked to Mr<br />
Hasluck? / 7 </p>
<p>-7-<br />
PM: Well, I have been incable communication with Mr Hasluck<br />
In New Zealand. I had a word with Gordon Freeth, the acting Minister<br />
here, and with a number of officials, and with the Deputy Prime Minister.<br />
Q. Have you spoke n to any other R1ime Ministers like Mr<br />
Holyoake?<br />
PM: No.<br />
Q. Sir, how soon do you expect a positive response from<br />
Hanoi? What would you call a reasonable thing?<br />
PM: I couldn't guess. I wouldn't guess.<br />
Q. Mr Prime Minister how big do you see this move?<br />
PMo: f whether NortIh t hViniekt iNt aomug hist tpor ebpea raebdle toto sbtea rrte tgaalkrdinegd oars nao tr. eal test<br />
Q. Would you go further than that?<br />
FM: I think that is a pretty big thing, isn't it?<br />
Q. Do you think there have been steps to peace on an equal<br />
scale?<br />
PM: I think perhaps that this is the greatest concession the<br />
Americans have made. There have been concessions, but following on<br />
from the thing held out at San Antonio, and the President's speech itself,<br />
when you read it all in with the S2an Antonio one, this is a further concession<br />
than was offered in the San Antonio speech.<br />
Q. Mr Prime Minister, could you illuminate the section of<br />
the President's statement on troops? Could you call his attitude now one<br />
of having a holding operation?<br />
PM: No, I don't think I would. I think he has indicated a resolve<br />
to continue the struggle, and indeed, a resolve to build up the South<br />
Vietnamese armed forces, and expect them with the equipment which the<br />
United States will provide, to take an even bigger part to provide some<br />
reinforcements from the United States itself, and to continue the struggle<br />
I have forgotten the words he used, but the resolve is completely unweakened.<br />
Q. This is directly related to the Tet offensive?<br />
PM: I have seen no indication of it. I car only tell you what<br />
I have been told and what I believe to be the reason behind it. I think<br />
the reason behind it is All right. Vie will make this further concession.<br />
We will go this extra mile.<br />
Q. Do you think the New Hampshire primaries may have had<br />
anything to do with it?<br />
PM: VWell, would they have anything to do with it if he wasn't<br />
go to stand for President again? </p>
<p>-UQ.<br />
Does this leave you in the position that you need to<br />
clarify your thinking on the thing. Cbviously, yours consiLsted of a<br />
series of impressions as you have told us today.<br />
PM: My thinking of a series of impressions on what?<br />
Q. On his official statement and the slight background<br />
given to you by the State Department. Will this speed up any intention<br />
on your part to go to the States to talk with him and his authorities?<br />
Or will you rely on Mr Rusk here?<br />
PM: Well, I will be talkdng to Mr Rusk here. I was proposing<br />
to go to the States quite soon for a rush trip, but they will be engaged in<br />
all kinds of various political activities. Now that President Johnson has<br />
indicated that he will not be standing again, I will have to consider whether<br />
it might not better to do it later.<br />
-Could you indicate when you say'soon Sir, what your<br />
original plans were?<br />
PM: Well, they were rretty tentative.<br />
Q. You will wait for a new President, then?<br />
PM: Well, this Is the sort of thing I said I would have to take<br />
Into consideration. I want to think about it.<br />
Q. Otherwise It could be a trip which<br />
PM: Well, there are all sorts of considerations<br />
Q. In view of the fact that this very latest step was taken<br />
without consultation with the Australian Government, despite assurances<br />
we had in 1966 after the Honolulu Conference, can we take this as<br />
official acknowledgment now that the war has passed out of our hands<br />
without even going through the pretence of influencing the course of the<br />
war here?<br />
PM: Well, I suppose anybody is at liberty to take ar. ything<br />
at any time in any way they like. Rre you asking me the way I take it<br />
or you asking me the way you can take it?<br />
Q. The Government.<br />
PM: Well, let me make these points. This is not anything<br />
which in any way requires any increased contributions from Austrdlia.<br />
This is not something which requires Australia to make some additional<br />
effort at all. In those kind of circumstances, I have no doubt whatever<br />
that full consultations would take place. I don't expect them to take<br />
place in other circumstances..... if anyone wants to interpret that....<br />
This is a further attempt and a further step to see whether they can<br />
bring about talks while continuing the struggle in South Viet Nam, wie ther<br />
they can bring about talks leading to a genuine peace. Vie have<br />
consistently Said that we would support such attempts. / 9 </p>
<p>C.<br />
Q. Have we said what we think is a genuine peace?<br />
PM: Yes, we have. I can't remember the words, but a just<br />
and enduring peace that really gives the people of South Viet Nam the<br />
opportunity to make freedom cf choice. That is it by and large. You<br />
will find this firm statement in the Governor-General's Cpeech, I think<br />
Q. On this point of consultation Mr Prime Minister, are<br />
you then satisfied with the lack of consultation and warning that the<br />
Australian Government was given?<br />
PM: I thought I had answered that before in the last question,<br />
indicating that we would support moves leading towards it ( peace). In<br />
the Governor-General's Speech, we said we seek a just and lasting<br />
peace based on those objectives. 1 will read you the whole passage,<br />
because it ties in with something you said, Frhnk<br />
" My Government believes that the South Vietnamese<br />
people should retain the elementary right to determine their own<br />
future in their own way and will, besides the effective military<br />
assistance it is rendering to this end, continue to provide economic<br />
and civil aid n South Viet Iam.<br />
In doing this, my Government desires neither the<br />
destruction of North Viet Nam, nor the overthrow of the Government<br />
of North Viet Nam but merely the cessation of aggression against<br />
the people of South Viet Nam so that those people may, by the<br />
exercise of a franchise they have shown they know how to exercise<br />
even under the most difficult and dangerous circumstances, choose<br />
their own form of government. We seek a just and lasting peace<br />
based on these objectives. We have supported and will support<br />
every effort for negotiation off such a peace. 4<br />
Q. Even in the better conditions of peace, as we state them,<br />
what are the pre-conditions as you see them for. peace. talks? VWhat are<br />
the pre-conditions before we get into talks? Are there any?<br />
PM: Well, I imagine a pre-condition is that the Government<br />
of North Viet Nam indicates that they are prepared to enter into peace<br />
talks.<br />
Q. A cease-fire?<br />
PM: This seems to be the objective, doesn't it? I mean, this<br />
is the objective, to enter into peace talks. This has been, all the time.<br />
The United Ctates has been saying, " Well, we'll try this. V-e'll try<br />
that to see vwhether it results in an indication that the North Vietnamese<br />
will begin to talk" Not necessarily before the fighting finishes, but<br />
begin to talk,.<br />
Q. The diplomatic pressure is obviously on them now. There<br />
will be some sort of an answer, apparently. * If we presume-there will<br />
be some sort of an answer, I am looking for a minimum pre-condition<br />
that we would regard as acceptable. Just a willingness to enter talks?<br />
PM: Well, this is what..<br />
Q. ' Will we be taking any diplomatic initiative to urge Britain<br />
to follow the Fresident's request to call a meeting, to get moving? </p>
<p>10<br />
PM: To call Britain and . Russia to get on to Ho Chi Minh?<br />
Q. Are we going to press Britain along on this?<br />
PM: I wouldn't comment on that at this stage.<br />
Q. What is the difference between this bombing pause and the<br />
previous bomb.: ing pause? This has been presented as a dramatic move by<br />
the US. It has been presented in rather dramatic circumstances with<br />
rather dramatic surrounds. But is it essentially any different from the<br />
previous bombing pauses?<br />
PM: Well, I think one has to make one's own mind up about this,<br />
but previously, there have been sort of bombing pauses this is not presented<br />
as a bombing pause essentially but there have been bombing pauses in<br />
the sort of hope that we would see what happened. Now, the -next step was<br />
that the President I am sorry to go over the same ground again made<br />
the Sja n Aintonio speech in which he said, " We'll stop bombing if you will<br />
start talking and not take great military advantage of our stopping bombing"<br />
and that didn't seem to elicit any response. Then a number of people around<br />
the world said, " W~ ell, give it a go anyway. Stop the bombing and we think<br />
they will probably talk if you do. Give them an opportunity to talk. They<br />
said they wouldn't talk if you didn't. This is a stopping of bombing except<br />
for the direct military support which is needed, Well, as I said before, it<br />
will test whether this does lead to indications of their willingness to enter<br />
into talks.<br />
Q. This also has an element of tick-tacking involved in it. " We'll<br />
do this and expect some gesture on your part and we will do something<br />
else. This wasn't apparent in the earlier bombing pauses.<br />
PM: This word " tick-aing" what do you nie an by that? I think it is<br />
a sort of indication. All right. Here's a real gesture. Does it elicit<br />
any response? If it elicits a response, then we can talk about the next<br />
step downwards, at the same time as we are talking about how to achieve<br />
a just and enduriug peace. The whole thing, I think, is now waiting to<br />
see what sort of a response it elicits.<br />
0. just on this point of consultations, Sir. Is the point you are making<br />
because we have said we support any steps towards peace, there is no need<br />
for the United States to come to us and say " We are going to do this because<br />
we see this as a step towards peace"?<br />
PM: W~ ell, I was endeavouring to indicate that the United StateE;<br />
in relation to all the things we have said about supporting steps towards<br />
peace and supporting the previous San Antonio speech of the President,<br />
might have thought it was essential fcr long-term prior consultations had<br />
there been any alteration the other way, had there been any alt eration in<br />
continuing their resolve on the ground in South Viet Nam, altering their<br />
approach there, which there is no indication of at all.<br />
Q. It is just that in the reassessment that went on, one would have thought<br />
they would have said to the other nations fighting " What are your views<br />
as to the conduct of the war and how It is going?" before they made the<br />
unilateral decision. </p>
<p>11<br />
Q. Particularly in the light of the fact that our Government, the<br />
Australian Government has consistently claimed that one of the motives<br />
in bombing was to save Australian lives.<br />
PM ' Well, the bombing is still going on in the areas where there is<br />
a military build-up put it this way, the bottlenecks, the trails along<br />
which men and munitions have been flowing down to the scuth, and that<br />
is why the same approach you have just said, quite properly, is the<br />
Australian Government's approach, is why the American President said<br />
" I couldn't in all conscience prevent that part of the bombing" because it<br />
would tend to help our people being killed.<br />
Q. Sir, in the last paragraph of your 1tment today you talked about<br />
not leaving allied troops at too great a~~ sa vttntage. Isn't this an admission<br />
that the cessation that is being allowed will do just that?<br />
PM: 171111 do just what?<br />
Q. Leave our troops at some disadvantage...<br />
PM: Oh. You read out my statement which said this is not leaving our<br />
troops at too great , isadvant age and then suggested my statement was<br />
saying it did just that, that it did leave them at too great a military<br />
disadvantage. It doesn't. But clearly there would be some military loss<br />
because you are not bombing arms factories, barracks and roads and<br />
bridges fuirther north, so there would be some diminution of t he effort<br />
in that direction, and that, I think, indicates that this is a real gesture<br />
on the part ofe the United States.<br />
Q. W~ ould it seem, Sir, if this gesture does succeed, even more Australian<br />
lives will be saved?<br />
PM: You mean if it moves step by step long term, and you reach the<br />
logical goal of having a real peace which gives them a chanc well you<br />
don't have people killed when you reach a real peace.<br />
Q. You don't see it in any way what the Americans have done about<br />
bombing as a public admission that their bombing policy has failed?<br />
PM: I don't think it is a public admission at all. I think it is-a genuine<br />
attempt, as the President has said, to make this movp in the hope that it<br />
will lead to Hanoi entering into these talks whereas previously and this<br />
is the significant change that we've been talking about, he has said we<br />
would like an indication of entering Into peace talks before wie make the<br />
next move. Now that is a significant change indeed.<br />
Q. Do you propose a debate on any stctement you might make on this<br />
to the Houce?<br />
PM: I don't believe I would be proposing a debate. I will probably make<br />
a statement to Parliament, but then it is open to debate....<br />
Q. You will make a further statement tomorrow?<br />
PM: I think dia t would be the reasonable thing to do.<br />
Q. The way will then be open for the Opposition to reply? </p>
<p>-12-<br />
PM: V. 7eli, there could be a debate on this. Yes.<br />
Q. Has the Foreign Affairs debate finished?<br />
PM: Wlell, I have been away. I haven't caught up with it. V/ e only<br />
got back yesterday afternoon. I had to do a little work yesterday after<br />
we got back and I haven't had time to get round to<br />
Q. It was adjourned, Sir, on the motion of Mr Giles.<br />
Q: VWIll you have an early " Cabinet meeting to present this to Cabinet?<br />
PM: VTell, we will be having a Cabinet tomorrow in the normal way,<br />
but what this would call for is not a Cabinet discussion?<br />
Q. Sir, personally, do you feel optimistic about the outcome of<br />
this<br />
PM: Oh, I am not going to speculate on the future. S-or-. y, I just can't<br />
speculate on this one<br />
Q. Can you s ay anything now a-bout the Fill1? R emember you were<br />
asked yesterday and you said<br />
PM: No, I'm sorry I can't. But Mr Fairhall is coming up here. He<br />
will probably be able to say something about it. He has indicated to me<br />
that he will be getting reports from the United States authorities on<br />
whatever it was that happened. Nobody seems to be quite sure yet what<br />
it was. Thank you. </p>
