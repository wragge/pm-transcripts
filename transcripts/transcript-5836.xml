FOR MEDIA WEDNESDAY, 17 JUNE 1982<br />
ADDRESS TO ROTARY CLUB DINNER, CAMDEN<br />
It has been a busy day, but it has been an enjoyable one<br />
in a wonderful part of Australia. I am delighted that<br />
you have asked me to speak to you in this combined dinnermeeting,<br />
because Rotarians epitomise so much of what is good<br />
in Australia, so much of what makes all of us I believe,<br />
very proud to be Australian. It not only promotes goodwill<br />
within its own communities, but what Rotarians do helps to<br />
build a nation, to improve on its own community, but then that<br />
reaches out beyond the boundaries of Australia to try and<br />
extend understanding and goodwill with people from other<br />
countries. There are Rotary exchange students here this evening,<br />
and the programes that Rotary pursues year by year are of<br />
enormous value and I would like to thank you for the work that<br />
you do.<br />
I would like to speak for a few moments about where Australia<br />
is going, about some of the problems that we have within the<br />
Australian economy, some of the concerns that we have for<br />
Australian security, About one or two of the things that we<br />
sometimes do to damage ourselves when we do not work together<br />
well enough and when we spend perhaps too much time arguing<br />
about different directions or ways of doing things instead<br />
of getting on with the job of building Australia up.<br />
Over recent years we have had some success in economic terms.<br />
We have moved very much against the international tide-we<br />
know we have! problems here of employment and inflation<br />
but this economy has been growing. The real household<br />
disposable incomes of Australian families have been rising<br />
and it is possible to draw some comparisons between the sorts<br />
of things that have been happening here, in the United States<br />
or in Europe. The motor industry in the last 12 months has<br />
had an all time record year in Australia. In the United States<br />
it has had -just about the worst year it has ever had, because instead<br />
of producing what they regard as normal, something like 14 or<br />
million automobiles, they have produced about 8 million<br />
automobiles.. You start to measure the difference in terms<br />
of the number of people employed, the level of unemployment<br />
in Detroit, and. obviously the harm that does is enormous.<br />
It not only affects the United States or the autombile<br />
workers, a 41reat deal less steel is needed, Iess coal and less<br />
iron ore are needed, so a reduction of that size in one industry<br />
alone is enough to affect the international markets of coal and<br />
iron ore. rhat starts to affect us and this region which is<br />
very dependent upon coal for much of its employment and its<br />
well-being. ./ 2 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
In Europe we find that unemployment in a number of countries<br />
is around 10% and up to 12%. In the OECD countries unemployment<br />
is forecast, and it will indeed, reach 30 million people this<br />
year. The prospects of, that level of unemployment coming down<br />
rapidly in a short time are not with us. It shows how the<br />
world changes, as I mentioned earlier that if you asked the<br />
major Western world leaders 10 or 15 years ago: " could<br />
unemployment ever again reach 30 million people amongst<br />
advanced Western counties, industrialised countries?", they<br />
would have said: " no, it cannot happen, we know much better<br />
how to run our economies than that. It is not possible."<br />
Well, unfortunately, it is not only possible, but it has<br />
in fact happened. One of the things that concerns me very<br />
considerably is the fact that I do not really see at this<br />
point the kind of action being taken on the world stage that<br />
is going to get substantial growth back into those major<br />
economies which are so important if world trade is to grow<br />
and expand. That is very important for us because 30% of what<br />
Australia produces of Australia's Gross Domestic Product, to<br />
use economist jargon, is represented by trade, and we live by<br />
what we can sell to markets overseas. Again in this part of-<br />
New South Wales you feel the effects of that in reduced demands<br />
for coal, -ard greater difficulties for coal companies and it<br />
is all part of the world scene.<br />
In six of the seven major economies over the last 12 months<br />
they have in fact produced less than they had the year before<br />
in the last recorded figures. in the United States, Canada,<br />
Japan, Britain, France and Germany. That is not very<br />
encouraging because we all want better living standards, people<br />
want more do'llars, more real dollars not inflated dollars in<br />
their pockets so that they can do more for themselves and their<br />
families. Most people want governments to do more whether it<br />
roads, schools or hospitals, or other kinds of services or<br />
in better directed welfare for needy or elderly people, and tha~ t<br />
can only come out of what a nation produces. Governinnent's<br />
do not have some bountiful chest that they can dip into, all<br />
goverment's can do unfortunately, is to dip into people's pockEts.<br />
Wle are told everyday that Ine do too much of that, ' and I notice!<br />
a few ' hear hear's' around the table. I agree that government's<br />
dip too much into my pockets and everyone elses, but the services<br />
that people expect from governments have to be paid for and if<br />
governments don't take from people, there is no way else it cart<br />
be paid. Local government wants more from us, I hope they<br />
do not ask t: hat 2% of income tax to be increased because I do<br />
not think that we could afford to increase it. State governments<br />
will want* more from us. We will be having a meeting with<br />
Premiers in a short time, I hope it can be an amicable, friendl~ y<br />
meeting and I am going to do my best.<br />
There was an occasion when one Premier said interest rates are<br />
too high I move that we move interest rates down We said<br />
that is fine, we will move that interest rates come down 2%<br />
but how are we apoing to put it into affect. Do you think you<br />
are going to get any money for your electricity authority?<br />
Do you think you will be able to raise any money for your<br />
semi-governent authorities at all? If we just move the<br />
Government rate down, other people have to follow, but they<br />
might not follow, they might send their money overseas, or they ./ 3 </p>
<p>-3-<br />
might lend it to private enterprise and you might end up with<br />
no money at all. Well there were not any other Premiers<br />
who thought that you could just move that interest rates come<br />
down 2% and who really believed that that would happen. I<br />
suppose these are stories out of school, but on one occasion<br />
I asked Premiers whether they thought that high interest rates w~ ere<br />
caused by the demand for funds or by a bunch of crooks out on<br />
the market. Obviously if it was going to be a bunch of crooks<br />
out on the market we should be taking some action to stop it.<br />
But the answer I got was a silence, because they know it was<br />
demand and if you want to reduce demand it might mean less<br />
money for Premiers. In the kindest possible way I have never<br />
yet met a Premier who did not believe that the Commonwealth ought<br />
to provide more money for everything which a State does. We<br />
have not got any money that we do not take from you and I much<br />
prefer to have a situation in which the Premiers-had to ask.<br />
you quite directly instead of through me or through John Howard.<br />
If I could establish that kind of system I would love to do<br />
it, I think it would be a much better one and the Commonwealth<br />
could just stand aside and say to the Premiers: " well you<br />
go to it with your own citizens", and the results might be quite<br />
different.<br />
We are concerned about the state of the world economy and as<br />
a result of that we did propose a number of things which we<br />
believe the major economies could do, could set a lead, at<br />
the meeting that was recently held in Versailles. There were<br />
some things in the communique which pleased us, they condemned<br />
protectionism, they said that we had to get economies moving<br />
and growing again. I do not really believe that that conference<br />
achieved as much as anyone would have wanted, but there will be<br />
a GATT-Ministerial meeting held later this year which will be<br />
very important we believe, in determining whether world trade<br />
starts growing again or not.<br />
The things that we suggested at the meeting I do not believe,<br />
should have been all that difficult. We had suggested that all<br />
countries commit themselves to no further increases in<br />
protection, to just leave it where'it is as a first step. Now<br />
that would be a difficult thing to do, one country by itself, but<br />
if the major economies were prepared to do it other countries<br />
would be able to follow.<br />
We had also suggested that there ought to be steady reductions<br />
in protecticon over the next five years by a formula, by a set<br />
amount to bE! agreed. Again that is not sanethir'ig ' that any one<br />
country acting alone ccid but it is something that countries<br />
acting in concert would be able to encompass. We had also<br />
suggested that export subsidies should, over a period, be<br />
abolished, because I think one of the silliest things of all is<br />
that one countries start subsidising its exports, and therefore:<br />
another country can give their own exporters an equal go when the<br />
first country starts subsidising its exports, and it is just<br />
a competitive subsidy business. It really is wasted resources<br />
which could be better used in other ways. If nobody was subsid~ ising<br />
their exports, nobody would need to subsidise their exports, the<br />
people that could do it best would be able to be successful. / 4 </p>
<p>-4-<br />
My Government: believes that a country like Australia could.<br />
do * these sorts of things, if the major economics also were,<br />
but we also believe very firmly that we cannot and could not<br />
take unilate: eal action. There are sometimes economic writers<br />
w'ho say: " iet doesn't matter what countries overseas do,<br />
protection in Australia is too high and it must<br />
come down." Well that is all very well, but there is not much<br />
point in brin2ging protection down in this country which in<br />
the very difficult world trading conditions we are now facing,<br />
it certainly means that more overseas-made goods could come into<br />
Australia, some of them at dumpted prices whichare very<br />
difficult to prove because in many cases of marginal costing<br />
and all the rest, there are some countries that are prepared<br />
to export to keep their factories or steel industries operating<br />
even if they are selling at a loss, and it is not always easy<br />
to prove the dumping proposition.<br />
If a country like Australia acted alone to reduce whatever<br />
protection we had, and did it in an environment where we<br />
were not going to get better access to markets overseas for<br />
the things we could do best, then that is just like stripping<br />
yourself naked in the middle of the street, it really is,<br />
and I think it would be the utmost foolishness because we<br />
have hard and fast quantitative restrictions against maybe<br />
30%-35% of our exports and there is no way we can export<br />
more of those things to the countries that have those restrictions<br />
against us unless they lift those quantitative barriers.<br />
Only six weeks ago<br />
our market in the United States for sugar was cut from<br />
admittedly a record of 800,000 tonnes last year to something<br />
between 150,000 and 200,000 tonnes in this coming year.<br />
That is a pretty fair reduction. The Administration opposed. it<br />
but it went through Congress nonetheless, and I am told that<br />
there are a hundred protection bills before the United States<br />
Congress. I have not got any doubt'at all that there would<br />
be more than. one that would affect Australia's exports to the<br />
United States and the imbalance in our trade with the United States<br />
on a pro-rata per capita basis is much worse than their<br />
imbalance with Japan. I have been watching the arguments they<br />
have been using against Japan to try and get a better balance<br />
between those two because we can turn the arguments around<br />
and use them all against the United States, and that. is a country<br />
that is friEndly to Australia. So the trade scene is difficult,<br />
the Government has to argue for access to markets around the<br />
world. We have to do what we can to be competitive, and this is,<br />
where we sometimes do much more damage than we should to ourselves.<br />
Two years ago we would have been pretty competitive on the<br />
world scene, but the economy was gxowing fast, employment was<br />
rising strongly, it had risen up to 400,000 over three years.<br />
There was not another industrial country that. could point to<br />
the same record. So everyone immediately starts to want a<br />
piece of this action, it means that wages can be higher, work<br />
less and have reduced hours and enjoy it all. As a result<br />
of that we have a situation where wages in the last year<br />
have gone up something like 15%-20% in real terms, and on </p>
<p>some figures by more than that. We have a situation where<br />
people are now in many industries working less, but because<br />
there has been real recession overseas, they have been getting wrage<br />
settlements of around and they have become more competitive<br />
and we are finding that there are more imported goods coming<br />
into the country and we are finding it much harder to sell<br />
Australian goods overseas.<br />
The industrial disputes, the wages difficulties that we have<br />
had over the last 12 months have really made it difficult and<br />
the people that are going to be hurt are the people who do<br />
not have jobs or the people who are going to lose jobs.<br />
There are many manufacturing industries in this country right at<br />
the very moment, there have been for the last 2 months, there are<br />
one or two who talk about it, and others just gc, about doing it,<br />
they have their unprofitable lines of production and they<br />
rub them out and every time they do that it means that they<br />
employ some less. The national wage case was helpful, it<br />
gave no further general increase w. hich gives us some time to<br />
digest the excessive increases of last year.<br />
In industrial relations there are far too many disputes and<br />
I spoke earlier today about the problems in the coal industry<br />
and the harm', it does Australia as a reliable supplier to<br />
markets over-seas. But in industry after industry, there have<br />
been industrial disruption and difficulty and I do not think<br />
that there i~ s any one cause of it. Ian Macphee is working<br />
very hard to establish a better climate. There will be a<br />
tripartite conf erence between the ACTU, employers organisations<br />
and governments in two or three weeks time in Canberra and I<br />
hope that out of that there ? will emerge a firm understanding<br />
that these are not groups that are competitive in terms of<br />
their re~ l interests, they are groups that are complementary<br />
in terms of their real interests.<br />
People are not going to be employed unless businesses can make<br />
prof its and if businesses are making losses, then it is not a time!<br />
to be pressing: for higher and higher wages because that would<br />
lead to more unemployment. If the trade union movement really<br />
understands where its real interests lie they would be wanting<br />
industry in Australia to make more and more profits, because<br />
the more profitable Australian industry is the better wages<br />
they can pay and the more people they can employ. What we needl<br />
to understand in this country to a much greater extent, is that<br />
as Australians we have complementary interests, our real<br />
interests are not competitive at all. We need to build'on<br />
Australia's strength in the skills that we have. We have<br />
vast natural resources, rural resources, capacities in<br />
manufacturing, but the real resources ace the resources of<br />
Australian people who now come from nearly every continent<br />
and nearly eavery',. nation around the world.<br />
I can recall sometime last year I gave a reception in Sydney<br />
for ethnic leaders in and around<br />
Sydney and over 50 nations were represented. Now for those<br />
of us who can, and I can, . just remember back before the world<br />
war, that would not have happened, it could not have<br />
happened, we were not that kind of nation. We were narrower,<br />
smaller, our population had come from very few countries at </p>
<p>-6-<br />
that time., very much Ango-Saxon, but now we are very much<br />
a multi-cultural society with people born in every continent<br />
of every natiLon and I believe, we are a better and I hope<br />
a wiser and maore tolerant society, as a consequence.<br />
We live in an uncertain world. Britain's experience in the<br />
Falklands shows that very clearly. Nobody believed, nobody<br />
had predicted that the ArgentinOe military leadership would<br />
invade the Falklands which had been under the British flag<br />
for about 140-150 years. While the purpose of foreign<br />
policy and the purpose of defence policy is to operate in<br />
concert to make sure that dangers do not arise, I do not<br />
believe that anyone can guarantee that events cannot occur<br />
that might cause real difficulty.<br />
That means two things. It means that we-need to do what we<br />
can on our own account to improve our own defences to make<br />
sure that we have the best and most modern equipment which<br />
is possible for our defence forces. I am delighted to see<br />
that the retiring Chairman of the Chief of Defence Force<br />
Staff, Admiral Synott, said on his retirement, that we have<br />
the best equipped and the best trained force that we had<br />
ever had in peacetime. I believe that to be an accurate<br />
statement. I mentioned -earlier today that Jim Killen made a statement<br />
three or four weeks ago and every newspaper in the country<br />
had massive headlines defence spending slashed. They<br />
did this because-we brought forward, to the newspapers nind<br />
but they had not understood, that we had brought forward<br />
two major items in the defence program the purchase of<br />
Invincible, -which Ihope the British will still want to sellit<br />
has been a very effective ship and the Harriers have also<br />
been very effective in the Falklands in giving support for<br />
the army and also the purchase of another squadron of maritime<br />
reconnaissance aircraft to get in on the current United States<br />
production run, because if we had not done that, we would have<br />
had to pay a lot more for the same aircraft at some later<br />
point. Bringing forward two major items of equipment which<br />
together would total several hundred million dollars, we<br />
obviously have to increase the vote enormously now, or reshape<br />
other expenditures and expenditures were reshcheduled. So<br />
the papers came out and said defence spending cut well<br />
in fact it was up 19% in money terms, 9%-10% in real terms<br />
and if anyone went along to their employer and said I have<br />
just had a 19% increase in wages and I regard that as a cut and<br />
I am therefore very discontented, I do not think they would<br />
get much of a. response from their employer. That is part of the<br />
problems of communication that Governments are told they always<br />
have. We not only need to do what we can on our own account, we<br />
also need to. be a reliable ally, because I really do believe<br />
that the vast majority of Australians are a committed nation,<br />
committed to democracy, committed to a free way of life,<br />
committed to a free and open society, which we believe creates<br />
the best country in the world to live in and to br'ing up our<br />
children and families. If we do belisve in these things </p>
<p>-7-<br />
then we have to work, as I believe, with our traditional<br />
friLends and allies, whether it is with Britain with whom there<br />
are no formal links because the roots of tradition and f riendship?<br />
are sufficiently strong, or with the United States where<br />
there is a formal alliance which canmits usto consult in time<br />
of danger, but which commits us also inth-e normal course of<br />
events to do what we can separately and jointly, acting<br />
together to prevent a time of danger ever arising.<br />
I hope you won't regard me as being too political if I say<br />
something Iwastold that I could and should be provocative<br />
tonight to say something about ships, because one of the<br />
things that has happened over the last 10 years is that we<br />
have had over 500 visits from United States, United Kingdom<br />
and some French Naval ships. Now these are all nuclear<br />
weapon states, they are all within the Western Alliance.<br />
The United States, is with New Zealand with us, in ANZUS,<br />
and it is not possible to say which of those ships are going<br />
to be carrying nuclear weapons and which are not because<br />
that would obviously be enormously important information for<br />
any potential enemy. Enormously important information for the<br />
Soviet Union and they would give their eye teeth to have that<br />
kind of information, to be able to pinpoint which British<br />
which American and French ships were carrying nuclear weapons<br />
and which were not. Therefore, they just don't say, and they<br />
won't say. I. If an Australian Government is to come along<br />
and say we will only have the ships in our harbours and ports<br />
that don't carry nuclear weapons, then in those circumstances<br />
there would be no ships from those countries visiting our<br />
ports. They need access to our ports for replenishment, for<br />
repair, for rest and recuperation for sailors who have been<br />
on patrol for upwards of six months at a time in the Indian<br />
Ocean.-If in peacetime we can say to friends and allies:<br />
" I am sorry you cannot even visit our ports", then I think<br />
we would be a pretty lousy ally, and I think we would be<br />
regarded as a lousy ally and we would not have an Alliance.<br />
It is worth noting in spite of a lot of-the talk that has gone on<br />
that up until recently there has been a great deal of bipatrtisanship<br />
in relation to this policy because of the 500 visits that I<br />
mentioned, it large number of them occurred when Mr Whitlam was<br />
Prime Minist~ er. He accepted obsolutely the principle which<br />
I have just enunciated and we also say that a large number<br />
of those ships have also visited Sydney Harbour during the<br />
time Mr Wran has been Premier, and neither I nor Mr Wran<br />
has known which of those ships has had nuclear weapons on<br />
board and which have not. I regret that this element of<br />
bipartisanship in Australia's defence and foreign policy is<br />
under threat right at the present time.<br />
There is one other thing that I would like to say. Australia<br />
is a relatively small nation of 15 million, but in so many<br />
areas Australians have reached the very top in their professions,<br />
and skills. Whether it is in the arts, opera or in ballet,<br />
medical research or in the various sports in which Australians<br />
have done so well in many forums around the world. There. are<br />
many of our countrymen who have done great things in which<br />
we can take great pride. Australians have always sought to do 18 </p>
<p>-8-<br />
the very best in their own particular field of endeavour. This<br />
is-something which I believe gives us all great cause for pride<br />
in being Australian.<br />
I would like to thank all of you as Rotarians and friends<br />
of Rotarians for what you are doing to build a better<br />
Australia, for what you are doing to build up your own<br />
communities. 3ecause it is those kind of actions, the kinds of<br />
ideals that Rkotary has, that makes this country what it is,<br />
which makes this country as I very fervently believe, the best<br />
country in the world. </p>
