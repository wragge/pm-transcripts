PRIME MIISTER<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING, MPD<br />
LAUNCHING CEREMONY FOR SUBMARINE COLLINS, PORT ADELAIDE,<br />
SATURDAY, 28 AUGUST 1993 PLEASE CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY<br />
Todays launching ceremony of the submarine COLLINS represents the<br />
culmination of a commitment made by this Government in the mid-eighties not<br />
only to Australia's defence, but also to Australia's defence industry.<br />
The submarine project went much further than a decision we made to replace<br />
the ageing Oberon class submarines: it is the first part of a determination to reestablish<br />
Australia's shipbuilding industry.<br />
The second part of that commitment was to build in Australia the ANZAC class of<br />
ships for the Royal Australian Navy.<br />
And I am pleased to say that that project is also proceeding on schedule. The<br />
submarine project was ambitious, and not without significant risks.<br />
COLLINS is the first submarine to be built in Australia.<br />
A whole range of new and diverse technologies for Australia had to be set up<br />
from scratch: the production of high-strength micro-alloy steel; high-technology<br />
welding; new construction methods; micro-electronics; visual and electronic<br />
optical equipment; and the manufacture of lenses and submarine periscopes.<br />
The Australian Submarine CorporatiorrtASC) was awarded the prime contract in<br />
1987. The decision to select an Australian prime contractor reflected the Government's<br />
confidence in Australian capabilities and the Government's commitment to the<br />
-polivyoft-a ~ tlr-i, ldiittju~ iJ~~ vndUstry.<br />
The fulfilment of this vision has been a tall order for Australia's manufacturing<br />
industry at a time of great change.<br />

It has been an enormous challenge for management, the workforce, and their<br />
unions. I am pleased to say that the companies and people concerned have met that<br />
challenge. The result is a new defence industry culture which is now looking for<br />
opportunities elsewhere.<br />
I pay tribute to the Australian Submarine Corporation's ability to so effectively<br />
pull this very complex project together.<br />
ASC has successfully ensured that the submarine construction is on schedule,<br />
on cost, and meets or exceeds all performance criteria on quality, Australian<br />
industry involvement, employment opportunities, and technology transfer.<br />
ASC is exceeding its Australian industry involvement goal of 45% for the combat<br />
system work and 70% for the balance of the contract.<br />
Of the contract price of about $ 4 billion, more than $ 3 billion will be returned to<br />
Australian industry.<br />
Put simply, ASC has built the most advanced conventional ly-powered submarine<br />
in the world, and a lot of people deserve credit and congratulations.<br />
Among many other things the success of the project represents a major<br />
industrial relations achievement. Before work commenced management and<br />
unions negotiated a three-union on-site workforce.<br />
And more recently, they have negotiated a two-year Enterprise Agreement<br />
based on productivity improvements.<br />
The workers, their unions and management are to be congratulated on their<br />
example to Australian industry.<br />
We should also credit the South Australiao government's foresight in. backing<br />
the project.<br />
It goes without saying that their initiative has brought great benefits to the people<br />
of South Australia.<br />
The Corporation's fabrication and assembly work, together with component<br />
manufacture by South Australian industry, accounts for an injection of $ 1.6<br />
billion into the South Australian economy over a period of 14 years. 13415 </p>

Over 1000 new jobs have been created at the Australian Submarine the<br />
Corporation. m<br />
And several thousand other Australians have gained work through sub-Th<br />
contracts. oul inc<br />
The ASC, of course, has not done this alone, as the presence of distinguished inc<br />
representatives from Sweden and elsewhere testifies. Thi<br />
The Australian Government has appreciated the strong support of the Swedish O<br />
Government and the assistance provided by the Royal Swedish Navy to thece<br />
project. Their support exemplifies the cooperation that can be achieved between two S<br />
countries in a joint venture. Without this level of cooperation, I doubt that we<br />
could have achieved todays success. pe<br />
Minister Bjork, Au! to r<br />
I would like to express to you Australia's most sincere appreciation for the strong<br />
support provided by your government in ensuring the success of this project. Bul<br />
I am sure that you are as proud of Kockums' performance as we are proud of theca<br />
Australian Submarine Corporation. An(<br />
We look forward to continued close cooperation as we both seek to reap the full<br />
benefits in the international market place. It is<br />
Adr<br />
The construction of this submarine is an outstanding example of what can be<br />
achieved when Australia embarks on truly international joint ventures. Thi<br />
The multinational character of the project demonstrates that, in cooperation With n<br />
other countries, Australia is able to develop major new high-technology industry Bot<br />
capabilities. of i<br />
I am pleased to see here today the Ambassadors, High Commissioners, military Sir<br />
officers and officials of the many countries involved in the project. a<br />
in t'<br />
I am pleased also to see representatives of the East Asian region with which we i<br />
seek closer defence ties. Sir<br />
Australia wants to develop defence industry relations with our neighbours. A he Witt<br />
1346 </p>
<p>I believe that such cooperation will assist the countries in our region to support<br />
their own security and defence needs, as well as assisting Australia in<br />
maintaining its industry skills.<br />
The Collins class submarines increase our confidence in our ability to defend<br />
ourselves, and illustrate how, through joint cooperation ventures Australian<br />
industry can contribute to the security needs of our neighbours, and help<br />
increase regional security and stability.<br />
These shipbuilding projects, and other defence acquisition programs, such as<br />
Over the Horizon Radar and high-technology communications programs, are<br />
clear evidence that Australia's industry and technological base is diversifying.<br />
Shipbuilding involves the entire spectrum of technology-based skills and<br />
capabilities including project management, information and communication<br />
systems, electronics, software, electro-optics, integrated logistics support and<br />
perhaps most importantly, customer service.<br />
Australia's defence industry may never be totally self-sufficient. It will continue<br />
to rely to a certain extent on overseas technology.<br />
But there is no question that Australia has developed specific skills and<br />
capabilities that are world class and internationally competitive.<br />
And I believe that these skills and experience will enable us to assist regional<br />
countries in their defence needs.<br />
It is fitting that the first submarine, and the class title, take their name from Vice<br />
Admiral Sir John Collins.<br />
This is the first time that Australian naval vessels have been named after officers<br />
and sailors who have served their country and their navy with great distinction.<br />
Both the submarines and the their namesakes represent the highest standards<br />
of Australian professionalism.<br />
Sir John Collins entered the Royal Australian Naval College in 1913 when he<br />
was 14 years of age and from where he began a along and distinguished career<br />
in the Royal Australian Navy.<br />
Sir John Collins saw service in both the First and Second World Wars.<br />
As Captain of HMAS SYDNEY in the Second World War in the Mediterranean,<br />
he engaged two Italian light cruisers, sinking one and forcing the second to<br />
withdraw damaged. 1347 </p>
<p>During the Pacific War, Sir John Collins returned to help in the defence of<br />
Australia. As Commander of the Australian Squadron, he attended the surrender of Japan<br />
in September 1945.<br />
He was later promoted to Vice Admiral, and created a Knight Commander of the<br />
Order of the British Empire.<br />
Sir John Collins served Australia marvellously well, and I am sure HMAS Collins Inpo<br />
will too. not h<br />
Australia can develop the most advanced technology and manufacture This:<br />
technologically complex equipment, on time, within cost, and to world-class<br />
standards for quality. Ther, unem,<br />
The challenge of the future is to ensure that this new defence industry capability . exci<br />
is maintained and further developed for the benefit of Australia and regionalBu<br />
countries. . geari uneur<br />
I congratulate the Australian Submarine Corporation and the people who built<br />
HMAS Collins; the Swedish company, Kockums; Rockwell Systems Australia; all<br />
other sub-contractors; suppliers and the Navy.<br />
You have all done a superb job and I know all Australians would want me to<br />
extend their warmest congratulations.<br />
Thank you.<br />
