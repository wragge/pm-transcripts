STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING, MP<br />
OPENING OF THE MEKONG RIVER FRIENDSHIP BRIDGE, 8 APRIL 1994<br />
It is my great pleasure to present to the government and peoples of Thailand and , aos,<br />
the Mekong River Friendship Bridge a gift from Australia.<br />
We ask you to think of this bridge as a symbol of our friendship.<br />
We hope that it will also stand as a landmark in a new era of relations between the<br />
countries which border the Mekong.<br />
Above all, we hope that it will help to bring to people on either side of the river greater<br />
prosperity. We are very proud that the skills and technology which built this bridge were<br />
Australian. Not merely because it is a great bridge, but because it is a bridge to strengthen the<br />
traditional bonds between the Lao and Thai people.<br />
Because it will create daily contact between them.<br />
Because it will encourage cooperation between them.<br />
Because it will encourage trade, promote development, boost commerce and raise the<br />
general level of prosperity.<br />
The Friendship Bridge creates the first road link between Thailand and Laos in history.<br />
It provides Laos with road access to the port of Bangkok. It provides Thailand with<br />
road access to Vietnam.<br />
It establishes a land transport corridor from Singapore to Beijing, thus linking the<br />
dynamic economics of South-last Asia and southern China. </p>
<p>In these ways the opening of the Friendship Bridge is a real and symbolic contribution<br />
to the development of Laos and Thailand and the region.<br />
There could be no more practical demonstration of the common interests uniting the<br />
countries of Asia than this bridge across the Mekong.<br />
As the centrepiece of a new infrastructure famework spanning the region, it will help<br />
attract development investment and encourage economic development and growth.<br />
It will complement the economic reform now underway in Laos and elsewhere in the<br />
region. It is also a skills and technology bridge.<br />
Fewer than twenty Australians were employed on this project, while about 500 Thai<br />
and Lao workers learned skills in such areas as environmental technology and<br />
engineering and construction techniques.<br />
This in itself is a source of satisfaction for us and another demonstration of the real<br />
and lasting benefits to be had from Australia's partnership with the countries of region.<br />
It is a partnership which we want to strengthen and develop. Australia wants to play a<br />
positive and creative role in South-East Asia and through projects like this one we are<br />
proving that we can.<br />
Before concluding I must congratulate the Australian companies involved:<br />
Maunsell Sinclair Knight which did the preparatory investigation and design<br />
arid -upervised the construction phase.<br />
And John Holland Engineering and Construction, the construction contractor.<br />
I have no doubt that for the people associated with both these companies this is a very<br />
proud day.<br />
And today we should also remember the role played by my predecessor, Bob lHawke<br />
who, in 1989, saw the potential of this project and gave it every support.<br />
When people from Thailand and Laos cross this bridge I hope they will remember the<br />
Australian part in building it, and be assured that they have in Australia a good<br />
neighbour, friend and partner.<br />
Australia hopes that you see in this bridge the way to a better future.<br />
And we hope you sec that we are part of that future.<br />
We hope you sec in the Mekong River Friendship Bridge the potential for many other<br />
rewarding projects and a relationship with Australia that grows ever deeper and<br />
broader. </p>
