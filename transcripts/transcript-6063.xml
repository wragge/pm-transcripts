ATTACHED IS A COPY OF THE LETTER I FORWARDED TO THE<br />
TASMANIAN PREMIER, MR GRAY, ON FRIDAY 18 -MARCH<br />

Hon Robin Gray,<br />
Premier of T.-smania1 JS9<br />
Parliament Hlouse<br />

My dear Premier<br />
As Prime Minister, I and my Government confirm our<br />
endeavours to reconcile differences in the community<br />
and to negotiate rational settlements on matters<br />
uoon which there are differences. One such matter<br />
affecting both your Government and mine is the<br />
question of the Gordon below Franklin Dam.<br />
During the election period in my address to a public<br />
meeting in Launceston on llth February, I stated:<br />
" My Party has a very clear view about this<br />
issue. Simply stated, it is that the<br />
Franklin Dam should not be built anrid, when<br />
we are elected to government on March 5, we<br />
will ensure that our commitment is carried<br />
out".<br />
In my private conversation with you, my Party's<br />
position was clearly put, as it was when I gave our<br />
policy speech at the Opera House on 16th February.<br />
Through that period and since, we have made it very<br />
clear that the Federal Labor Government is totally<br />
committed to achieving that position.<br />
C, We believe the issue is one of national significance<br />
and that we have a very clear mandate to put our<br />
policy into effect.<br />
In achieving that objective, we repeat our commitment<br />
to: ensure the long term energy needs of Tasmania<br />
are met; </p>

Sa n a c cmec n t. 7. u othr i y.<br />
We recqest your co-operation in cpening up discussions<br />
to determine the way in which can best tocjether<br />
achieve these objectives.<br />
We will give appropriate assistance to absorb the<br />
existing workforce into other programs which can be<br />
rapidly undertaken.<br />
In suggesting such alternative short term transitionary<br />
employment for the current construction workforce,<br />
we would clearly be guided by your Government in<br />
terms of the most appropriate program.<br />
We do suggest that the workforce and contractors should<br />
be almost immediately absorbed in such projects as:-<br />
speeding up the construction of the Pieman Scheme;<br />
continuation of the work on the Crotty Road and<br />
extension to Kelly's Basin;<br />
upgrading of work on the Zeehan-Strahan Road;<br />
refurbishing of the Murchison Highway where<br />
needed; a commencement on one or all of the proposed water<br />
conservation programs at Warners Creek, Coal River<br />
and Cascades Dam;<br />
reafforestation programs already planned for the<br />
0-West Coast; and<br />
upgrading of access to and facilities in National<br />
Parks, including staffing of these areas.<br />
We understand that the West and North West Coast<br />
Councils have submitted public works programs in<br />
recent years which have not been funded due to lack<br />
of capital. Such programs could also be the basis of<br />
discussion. </p>
<p>3<br />
Thn! e r'sucgjestions are not meant to be c:-: haustive, nor<br />
do they nireclude the need for long term permanent<br />
employment and econoic dcveiloiment as mentioned above,<br />
but are nut for ward as a basis for discussion to<br />
cover the transitionriary period.<br />
WVe would appreciate your early consideration and response<br />
to our request to negotiaticns as outlined above, and<br />
for such a resnonse to be available to me no later than<br />
Monday, March 28th, 1983.<br />
It is my view and the view of my Government that our<br />
differences can be resolved that alternative energy<br />
sources can be guaranteed, and alternative employment<br />
created to protect those affected by cancelling this<br />
project. We seek your co-oneration in reconciling the differences<br />
over this issue in the national interest.<br />
Yours sincerely<br />
ti)<br />
R. J. L. Hawke </p>
