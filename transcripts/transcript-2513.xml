FOR PRESS: PM No<br />
PREMIERS' CONFERENCE<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, Mr William McMahon<br />
On 17 December last I announced that I had suggested<br />
to the Premiers that the next Premiers' Conference should be<br />
held about mid-February as, by then, all parties would be in a<br />
better position to assess the impact on the economy of the<br />
measures that had already been taken.<br />
I have now received the agreement of all Premiers<br />
to the Conference taking place in Canberra on Monday, 14<br />
February, and continuing, if necessary, on Tuesday,<br />
February, 1972.<br />
Canberra 14 January 1972 </p>
