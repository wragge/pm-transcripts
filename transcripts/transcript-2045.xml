SECOND VISIT TO THE U. S. 1969<br />
WASH INGTON<br />
ARRIVAL STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER,<br />
MR. JOHN GORTON 6 MAY 1969<br />
I am glad to be here on a second visit to Washington<br />
within a space of only a few weeks, and glad that this visit is made<br />
in happier circumstances than the last.<br />
I return for fuller consultations on matters opened up<br />
on my last visit but postponed because of the period of mourning.<br />
I now look forward to resuming my discussions with<br />
the President and with the Secretaries of State and Defence and feel<br />
these meetings will be more fruitful as a result of preliminary talks<br />
last month. I hope to be told Mr. Nixon's latest assessment of<br />
Vietnam and the Paris talks, and to discuss with him the general<br />
problem of world security particularly as it affects Australia's<br />
regional interest in the South East Asian area. 1 hope also to discuss<br />
matters concerned with our common defence.<br />
I am also meeting merubers of the Senate Foreign<br />
Relations Committee at the invitation of Senator Fu lbright. This is<br />
an opportunity I warmly appreciate.<br />
My visit to Washington is not to deal with any one<br />
specific subject. I regard it, rather, as a practical expression of<br />
the close, frank and continuing relationship between two good friends<br />
Australia and the United States.<br />
Our two countries share many common objectives.<br />
We both want a world where nations big and small can live in<br />
independence and security, develop their standards of living, and<br />
share in an expanding world economy. In this world of change we<br />
want change to occur peacefully and to be of a kind designed to lead<br />
to better lives for all men. We can and must work together to help<br />
achieve this. </p>
