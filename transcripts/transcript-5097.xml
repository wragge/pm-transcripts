FOR MEDIA 7 JULY 1979<br />
AUSTRALIA/ UNITED KINGDOM NUCLEAR SAFEGUARDS AGREEMENT<br />
The Prime Minister, Malcolm Fraser, said that he was pleased<br />
that, at last, an Australia/ United Kingdom Nuclear Safeguards<br />
Agreement could become a reality following the announcement<br />
of formal agreement by the European Commission.<br />
Australia and the United Kingdom had attempted to meet<br />
earlier the objections of the European Commission<br />
concerning legal issues. These issues were not concerned<br />
with safeguards or safety measures. However, at no stage<br />
was Australia prepared to compromise on our own stringent<br />
safeguards requirements.<br />
Mr. Fraser said that in his discussions with the<br />
British Prime Minister in Canberra last weekend, he had<br />
emphasised the importance of an Australia/ United Kingdom<br />
agreement and was grateful that, as a result of these<br />
discussions, Mrs. Thatcher had personally intervened<br />
with the President of the European Commission, Mr. Jenkins.<br />
The announcement of the Australia/ United Kingdom Agreement,<br />
coming immediately after the signing of the Australia/ United States<br />
Nuclear Safeguards Agreement in Canberra, is one of<br />
major significance, further demonstrating Australia's<br />
commitment to non-proliferation objectives and the avoidance<br />
of the misuse of nuclear materials.<br />
Mr. Fraser said that in his statement to Parliament on<br />
August 1977, he had emphasised that Australia had an<br />
international responsibility to provide energy to an energy<br />
deficient world. At a time of severe worldwide energy and<br />
fuel shortages, supply of Australian uranium under new<br />
contracts could take place when these safeguards agreements<br />
were in place.<br />
Mr. Fraser said that it was now time for significant<br />
progress to be made in the negotiation of an Australia/ Euratom<br />
Nuclear Safeguards Agreement and he looked forward to<br />
co-operation between the European Community and Australia<br />
in this regard. 000---</p>
