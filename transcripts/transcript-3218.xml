A ) TIRAI A<br />
PRIME MINISTER PRESS RELEASE NO. 233<br />
22nd April 1974<br />
THE OPPOSITION PROMISES<br />
Australians will not be fooled by the extravagant Liberal tax cut<br />
promises. They have been through it all before.<br />
Voters still remember the promise to cut income tax in the Liberal<br />
policy speech for the 1969 elections.<br />
This promise was allegedly fulfilled in the 1970 Budget with in<br />
income tax cut of $ 290 million.<br />
In the same Budget, however, indirect taxes and charges were<br />
increased by $ 240 million.<br />
Seventy per cent of Australian families were worse off because<br />
of the direct and immediate consequences of that Budget, and the<br />
poorer the family was, the worse it was affected.<br />
Only the top 30% of income earners benefited on balance from the<br />
Liberal decisions.<br />
Liberal promises in this area tend to be totally illusory, and in<br />
the present instance, threaten devastating consequences for the<br />
Australian economy.<br />
Voters in 1969 had not been promised increased duties on petrol,<br />
cigarettes and wine, nor higher postal charges, nor increased sales<br />
taxes across a wide variety of goods including all cosmetics<br />
and consumer durables.<br />
A further imposition was an increase in company income tax which<br />
was immediately passed on in prices.<br />
This year we are promised a tax cut three times the size of that<br />
in the 1969 policy speech. The Liberals have carefully avoided<br />
any undertakings that a repetition of the 1969 promise will not<br />
take place this year. 2/ </p>

Australians will not be fooled a second time by Liberal thimble<br />
and pea trick promises.<br />
At a time of inflation, the only way the Liberals could pay for<br />
their $ 600 million income tax cut would be by again savagely<br />
increasing indirect taxes on cigarettes, petrol, beer, postal<br />
charges, cosmetics and consumer durables. This is what they did<br />
in 1970 when they tried to fulfil the income tax cut promises of<br />
their 1969 policy speech.<br />
This is what they would have to do again in 1974.<br />
In an attempt to conceal the inflationary effect of their income<br />
tax cut promise and to distort its objective as a mere electoral<br />
bribe, Opposition spokesmen have suggested that a tax cut would<br />
moderate wage demands.<br />
I am unaware of any economist who has suggested that such an<br />
effect would flow automatically from a tax cut.<br />
However, some have argued that it should be one of a number of<br />
measures in a prices and incomes policy.<br />
Mr. Snedden has not suggested any other measures.<br />
Indeed, the effect on wage demands of such a tax cut would be<br />
more than offset by the huge increases in indirect taxes which<br />
are the hidden slug.<br />
These unannounced policies would affect wage earners much more<br />
severely than any other section of the community.<br />
A Liberal Budget would clearly provide an extraordinary stimulus<br />
to inflation. Mr. Snedden will obviously have to deny any intention<br />
to increase indirect taxes, but Australians will remember what<br />
happened in 1970.<br />
This is the way of Liberal promises; what they give with one<br />
hand they will take with the other.<br />
What they did in 1970 they would have to do again in 1974. </p>
