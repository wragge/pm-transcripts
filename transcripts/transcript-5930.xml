EMBARGO 10: 15 am<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA WEDNESDAY, 6 OCTOBER-1982<br />
OPENING OF DARWIN PATROL BOAT BASE<br />
The opening of ' this base is a significant event. We are all<br />
delighted, Your Majesty, that you are able to perform the task.<br />
In recent years your Australian Government has added<br />
considerably to the effectiveness of the Australian Defence<br />
( j Force. Major new equipment are being introduced into that<br />
Force, and the numbers of our reserves have expanded.<br />
This base is part of that expansion. It will add very<br />
significantly to the effectiveness of the new Fremantle Class<br />
Patrol Boat and reduce the need to visit Cairns for refitting.<br />
Today, the minister for Defence, Ian Sinclair, will be<br />
announcing that a new Royal Australian Naval Reserve Port<br />
Division is to be established in Darwin, the first new port<br />
division to be created in over 30 years.<br />
The defences in our north will be further strengthened by the<br />
stationing of the FA/ 18 fighters in Darwin or in Tindal, a<br />
little to the south.<br />
In Townsville, we have set up the Operational Deployment Force<br />
which is designed to be able to mobilise, at very short notice,<br />
to respond to those threats to our security which might appear<br />
without warning. In addition, Darwin is the headquarters of<br />
the Norforce, the small, well-equipped, highly mobile force<br />
designed for strategic surveillance and reconnaissance in<br />
northern Australia.<br />
All the arrangements are now complete for work to go ahead at<br />
the RAAF facility at Derby South, which will give the RAAF's<br />
operational flexibility in northern Australian an enormous boost.<br />
The range and endurance of our strike force and our fighters<br />
will be even greater with the acquisition of an in-flight<br />
refuelling capability which Cabinet ' agreed to recently. We<br />
are also looking at the development of another naval patrol<br />
boat facility near Port Hedland, and new ships have entered<br />
the service. The strength and capability, of the Australian<br />
Defence Force is greater than it has ever been in-peacetime. </p>
<p>-2-<br />
I would like to take this opportunity, Your Majesty, to say<br />
how much we all admire the determination of the British<br />
Government to protect the Falklands and the skill of the British<br />
armed forces in that campaign. The manner in which the United<br />
Kingdom forces mounted a very considerable task group, and<br />
undertook effective operations 8,000 miles from Britain so<br />
successfully, has won the admiration of all of us.<br />
It has done much more than that. It also reminds us that<br />
we live in an unpredictable and unsettled world. The best guarantors<br />
of the security and the peace that we all want are effective<br />
defence forces to undertake our separate national responsibilities,<br />
and proper alliances between like minded nations.<br />
Our forces maintain their traditional links with those<br />
of the United Kingdom. We have the five power defence<br />
arrangements which involve Australia, New Zealand, Malaysia,<br />
Singapore and the United Kingdom. The ANZUS Alliance with<br />
the United States is also critical for the defence of our<br />
region. But these arrangements do much more than simply provide for<br />
the defence of the region. They make their own effective<br />
contribution to the broad Western Alliance and to the defence<br />
of the free world.<br />
Your Majesty, we all welcome you here very warmly. I have<br />
very great pleasure in asking you to declare this patrol<br />
base open. o0o---</p>
