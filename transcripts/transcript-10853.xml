    <content><![CDATA[<p>I announce today that the Federal Government will link the war widows'</p>
<p> pension to the recently legislated benchmark of 25% of male total</p>
<p> average weekly earnings (MTAWE).</p>
<p>This goes beyond the Government's previous decision to index</p>
<p> age and service pensions at 25 % of MTAWE and recognises that the</p>
<p> war widows' pension is special compensation for the loss of the</p>
<p> family breadwinner.</p>
<p>As a result, the war widows' pension will increase by $6.80 to</p>
<p> $378.60 per fortnight, effective immediately. It is tax free and non-means</p>
<p> tested.</p>
<p>Almost 100,000 war widows and war widowers will receive their first</p>
<p> increased pension payment on April 9.</p>
<p>The Federal Government will spend $168 million over four years to</p>
<p> deliver the increase.</p>
<p>Australia sent its young soldiers overseas on service with the solemn</p>
<p> undertaking that in the event of the war causing their death, their</p>
<p> widow and family would be cared for.</p>
<p>That undertaking has been honoured since 1914 by the payment of war</p>
<p> widows' pension.</p>
<p>My announcement today reinforces the Government's commitment</p>
<p> to care for those who deserve special recognition for their personal</p>
<p> sacrifice. It also highlights our commitment to protect the living</p>
<p> standards and financial security of older Australians.</p>
