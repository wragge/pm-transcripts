PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 19 NOVEMBER 1984<br />
SPEECH NOTES FOR THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
PUBLIC RALLY COLLIE WESTERN AUSTRALIA<br />
OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS COLLIE WILL BE PLAYING A MUCH MORE<br />
PROMINENT ROLE IN AUSTRALIA'S NATIONAL RECONSTRUCTION, TO<br />
THE ENORMOUS ADVANTAGE OF THE PEOPLE OF THIS TOWN, THIS REGION,<br />
THIS STATE AND AUSTRALIA.<br />
ONE REMARKABLE FEATURE ABOUT THE STRONG AUSTRALIAN ECONOMIC<br />
RECOVERY SINCE MID-1983 IS THAT THE AUSTRALIAN ECONOMY HAS<br />
HAD RECORD GROWTH DESPITE SUBDUED PERFORMANCE FROM THE<br />
RESOURCESSECTOR. WE HAVE HAD STRONG GROWTH IN RURAL PRODUCTION; IN PRIVATE<br />
SERVICES, LED BY THE GOVERNMENT'S INNOVATIVE AND INTENSIVE<br />
PROMOTION OF TOURISM; IN GOVERNMENT SERVICESj IN HOUSING<br />
AND IN MANUFACTURING.<br />
BUT SINCE THE COLLAPSE OF THE DISASTROUSLY MANAGED ORESOURCES<br />
BOOM" OF THE LATE COALITION YEARS, INVESTMENT IN THE RESOURCES<br />
SECTOR HAS BEEN DEPRESSED. THIS HAS DRAGGED DOWN THOSE PARTS<br />
OF THE MANUFACTURING SECTOR WHICH SUPPLY RESOURCE PROJECTS,<br />
MOST NOTABLY HEAVY ENGINEERING. a s/ 2. </p>
<p>19,4 07: 27 PERTH PRIME MINISTER OFFICE ( 09) 32'; 23672.2<br />

FROM NEXT YEAR, AUSTRALIAN ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE WILL BE BOOSTED<br />
BY RESOURCE INVESTMENT RETURNING TO STRONG GROWTH.<br />
OVER THE PAST THREE MONTHS, MAJOR RESOURCES DEVELOPMENTS TO THE<br />
VALUE OF ABOUT $ 15 BILLION HAVE MOVED FROM BEING GOOD IDEAS TO<br />
BEING CONSIDERED BY THEIR PRIVATE SPONSORS AS CERTAIN TO PROCEED<br />
THROUGH 1985.<br />
To PUT THIS FUGURE IN PERSPECTIVE TOTAL PRIVATE GROSS FIXED<br />
CAPITAL EXPENDITURE ( INCLUDING ALL PRIVATE BUSINESS INVESTMENT AND<br />
HOUSING) IN AUSTRALIA IN 1983-84 WAS $ 23 BILLION.<br />
THIS NEW RESOURCE INVESTMENT WILL BE ON TOP CF INVESTMENT THAT IS<br />
GROWING STRONGLY IN OTHER SECTORS OF THE ECONOMY. IT IS CLEAR FROM<br />
RECENT SURVEYS OF INVESTMENT AND INVESTMENT EXPECTATIONS THAT THE<br />
BUDGET ESTIMATE OF 5 PER CENT REAL GROWTH IN PRIVATE INVESTMENT<br />
WILL BE EASILY EXCEEDED. THIS STRONG MOMENTUM OF GROWTH IN<br />
NON-RESOURCE INVESTMENT THROUGH 198L4-85 WILL CONTINUE IN 1985-86.<br />
SEVERAL OF THESE HAVE ALREADY BEEN THE SUBJECT OF RECENT PUBLIC<br />
ANNOUNCEMENTS: DEVELOPMENT OF PREVIOUSLY DISCOVERED OIL FIELDS<br />
IN BASS STRAIT WHICH HAVE BECOME COMMERCIALLY VIABLE UNDER THE<br />
TAXATION POLICIES OF THIS GOVERNMENT; THE PORTLAND ALUMINIUM<br />
SMELTER IN VICTORIA; AND OF SPECIAL INTEREST TO COLLIE AND THE<br />
SOUTHWEST REGION OF WESTERN AUSTRALIA, THE SYNTHETIC RUTILE PLANT<br />
AT CAPEL.<br />
AND, ON. OTHER EXCITING PROJECTS RECENT NEWS HAS TURNED POSSIBILITIES<br />
INTO PROJECTS WHICH THE RELEVANT INVESTORS CONSIDER TO BE CERTAIN, </p>
<p>Nuv 1I-',&amp; 04 07: 28 PERTH PHTME MINISTER OFFICF ( O9. I32 j,. 367<br />

ON THE BASIS OF INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO THE GOVERNMENT, I<br />
AM ABLE TO SAY THAT THREE ADDITIONAL MAJOR RESOURCE INVESTMENTS<br />
IN WESTERN AUSTRALIA WHICH HAVE BEEN THE SUBJECT OF CONSIDERABLE<br />
PUBLIC DISCUSSION HAVE JOINED THE LIST OF NEW PROJECTS WHICH<br />
ARE CONSIDERED CERTAIN TO PROCEED THROUGH 1985.<br />
WORK IS PROCEEDING AT* AN EXTRAORDINARILY RAPID RATE ON THE<br />
COMPLETION OF THE FEASIBILITY STUDY FOR THE JOINT VENTURE<br />
WITH CHINA ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN IRON ORE MINE AT CHANNAR<br />
IN THE PILBARA, THE PARTIES ARE PROCEEDING ON THE BASIS<br />
THAT WORK WILL COMMENCE IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF NEXT YEAR<br />
ON THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE FIRST NEW IRON ORE MINE SINCE THE<br />
FIRST PHASE OF PILBARA DEVELOPMENT ENDED IN THE EARLY 1970s.<br />
THE NORTHWEST SHELF LNG SCHEME HAS BEEN THE SUBJECT OF TALK<br />
AND SPECULATION FOR OVER A DECADE. I CAN NOW TELL YOU WITHOUT<br />
EQUIVOCATION THAT THIS IMMENSE PROJECT'S TIME HA S COME. THIS<br />
WAS CONFIRMED WHEN ARRANGEMENTS WERE COMPLETED A FEW DAYS AGO<br />
FOR THE INTRODUCTION OF THE JAPANESE FIRMS MITSUI AND<br />
MITSUBIS HI AS ONE SIXTH PARTNERS. FORMAL. AGREEMENT ON MAJOR<br />
CLAUSES OF TtIE SALES AND PURCHASE ARRANGEMENTS ARE ON TARGET<br />
FOR THE END OF THIS YEAR. PRE-DESIGN ACTIVITY IS PROCEEDING<br />
TOWARDS THE COMMENCEMENT OF WORK DURING 1985, AFTER FINALISATION<br />
OF FORMAL APPROVALS AND COMPLETION OF FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS@ Os s/ 4. </p>
<p>ov .19,4 07: 29 PERTH PRIME MI. ISTER OFFICE ( 09) 3252:-67 .04<br />

THE LNG PHASE AT NORTHWEST SHELF IS BY FAR THE LARGEST<br />
PROJECT EVER TO HAVE BEEN UNDERTAKEN IN AUSTRALIA, ON<br />
ITS OWN IT REPRESENTS A MAJOR INCREASE IN PRJlVATE INVESTMENT<br />
AND TOTAL ECONOMIC ACTIVITY IN AUSTRALIA.<br />
OF SPECIAL IMPORTANCE TO COLLIE AND THIS REGION, I AM<br />
ALSO ABLE TO CONFIRM THAT THE CONSTRUCTION OF A PROJECT<br />
THAT WILL INCLUDE A NEW POWER STATION AT COLLIE AND AN<br />
ASSOCIATED ALUMINIUM SMELTER NEARBY WILL PROCEED IN 1985.<br />
TOTAL INVESTMENT WILL EXCEED $ 1.2 BILLION OVER A SIX YEAR<br />
PERIOD. TIlE FINAL FEASIBILITY STUDY FOR THIS DEVELOPMENT IS WELL<br />
ADVANCED AND ALL OF THE PARTIES ASSOCIATED WITH THE PROJECT<br />
ARE CONFIDENT THAT IT WILL GO AHEAD. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT<br />
HAS BEEN MONITORING THE LEVEL OF AUSTRALIAN CONTROL AND<br />
OWNERSHIP, AND IS SATISFIED THAT POTENTIAL AUSTRALIAN<br />
PARTICIPANTS ARE BEING PROVIDED WITH OPPORTUNITIES FOR<br />
MAXIMUM FEASIBLE AUSTRALIAN OWNERSHIP. 4 4/ 59 </p>
<p>13v 19, 84 U : 9 pERTH E t11IS T R OFF IC E 0*<br />
THE SMELTER WILL AT FIRST OPERATE ON SURPLUS POWER FROM THE<br />
STATE GRID, SWITCHING TO SUPPLY FROM A NEW POWER STATION HERE<br />
AT COLLIE WHEN IT BECOMES OPERATIONAL IN 1991. THE ONSITE<br />
POWER STAT ION CONSTRUCTION WORKFORCE WILL PEAK AT ABOUT 800.<br />
THIS WILL OCCUR AFTER THE SMELTER'S CONSTRUCTION HAS PEAKED,<br />
ENSURING A HIGH AVERAGE LEVEL OF CONSTRUCTION EMPLOYMENT<br />
BETWEEN THE TWO PARTS OF THE PROJECT FOR MO0RE THAN FIVE YEARS.<br />
ABOUT 250 DIRECT POSITIONS WILL HE CREATED IN THE POWER STATION'S<br />
CONTINUING OPERATIONS.<br />
WHEN THE NEW, FULLY COAL-FIRED POWER STATION BECOMES OPERATIONAL,<br />
THE PROJECT WILL ALSO GREATLY EXPAND PERMANENT EMPLOYMENT IN THE<br />
COLLIE COALFIELDS. EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES IN THE COAL INDUSTRY<br />
WILL, OF COURSE, EXPAND IN ADVANCE OF COAL PRODUCTION, THROUGH<br />
INVESTMENT IN THE REMOVAL OF OVERBURDEN AND OTHERWISE IN<br />
PREPARATORY EXPANSION OF CAPACITY.<br />
APART FROM THIS DIRECT EMPLOYMENT, THERE WILL BE SUBSTANTIAL<br />
EXPANSION OF GENERAL BUSINESS AND EMPLOYMENT ACTIVITY IN<br />
COLLIE, BUNBURY AND THE SURROUNDING REGION. THERE WILL ALSO BE<br />
SUBSTANTIAL OPPORTUNITIES WHICH THE WESTERN AUSTRALIAN<br />
AND AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENTS WILL MAXIMISE WITHIN COMMERCIALLY<br />
REASONABLE LIMITS FOR SALE OF AUSTRALIAN ENGINEERING PRODUCTS<br />
AND SERVICES. ABOUT ONE HALF OF TOTAL INVESTMENT EXPENDITURE IS<br />
EXPECTED, TO BE ON WESTERN AUSTRALIAN WAGES, MATERIALS AND SERVICEr<br />
AND ABOUT ONE FIFTH ON ENGINEERING AND OTHER GOODS AND SERVICES<br />
FROM ELSEWHERE IN AuSTRALIA. 16 </p>

IDO NOT NEED TO SPELL OUT FOR YOU THE HUGE BENEFICIAL<br />
IMPACT OF THIS DEVELOPMENT ON THE ECONOMY OF TH~ IS REGION.<br />
IT WILL BE IN ADDITION To THE BENEFITS FROM THE SYNTHETIC<br />
RUTILE PLANT TO BE ESTABLISHED NEARBY AT CAPEL, WHICH WILL<br />
PROVIDE 200 NEW JOBS DURING THE CONSTRUCTION PHASE,<br />
PERMANENT JOBS, AND SUBSTANTIAL DEMAND FOR ELECTRICITY AND<br />
COLLIE COAL.<br />
IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN STATE AND FEDERAL LABOR POLICY TO<br />
ENCOURAGE THE PROCESSING OF AUSTRALIAN RESOURCES IN<br />
AUSTRALIA, WITH THE COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT'S ACTIVE TRADE<br />
POLICYj FOCUSSING ESPECIALLY ON OPPORTUNITIES IN THE DYNAMIC<br />
WESTERN PACIFIC REGION; WITH LOWER INFLATION AND INFLATIONARY<br />
EXPECTATIONS; WITH A REALISTIC FLOATING EXCHANGE RATE; WITH THE<br />
STEADY PROGRESS WE ARE MAKING IN IMPROVING INTERNATIONAL<br />
COMPETITIVENESS; AND WITH INCREASING CONFIDENCE THAT STABLE<br />
ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND MODERATE INTEREST RATES WILL BE MAINTAINED<br />
OVER THE LONG PERIOD REQUIRED TO BRING LARGE PROCESSING PROJECTS<br />
TO FRUITION, THIS GOAL IS BECOMING A REALITY.<br />
THE CAPEL AND COLLIE PROJECTS ARE ONLY A BEGINNING OF A NEW~<br />
ERA OF EXPANSION IN WESTERN AUSTRALIAN MINERAL. S PROCESSING.<br />
SEVERAL OTHER MAJOR PROJECTS ARE AT AN ADVANCED STAGE OF<br />
NEGOTIATION. CHINA HAS INDICATED ITS WILLINGNESS TO PURCHASE<br />
THE WHOLE OF THE OUTPUT OF THE KwINANA BLAST FURNACE SHOULD<br />
THE FURNACE, AND THE LINKED IRON ORE MINE AT KOOLYANOBBING<br />
BE'RE-OPENED. NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN BHP AND CHINA ON ARRANGEMENTS<br />
FOR LONG-TERM CONTRACTS WILL CONTINUE EARLY IN THE NEW YEAR UPON<br />
COMPLETION OF FURTHER TECHNICAL WORK RELATED 1TO COST OF PRODUCi ION.<br />
BHP IS OPTIMISTIC ABOUT A FAVOURABLE OUTCOME. </p>
<p>i :. RTH PRIE INISTER OFFICE ( 09) 325 3 u*,<br />
7.<br />
NEGOTIATIONS ARE ALSO ADVANCED ON TWO MAJOR MINERAL SANDS<br />
PROCESSING DEVELOPMENTS NEAR GERALDTON, ONE OF MONAZITE<br />
AND ONE UPGRADING ILMENITE TO SYNTHETIC RUTILE, AND AN<br />
AMMONIA/ UREA PLANT AT A LOCATION YET TO BE! DECIDED IN THE<br />
SOUTHWEST OF WESTERN AUSTRALIA.<br />
GIVEN THE EXPECTED CONTINUATION OF STRONG GROWTH IN OTHER<br />
SECTORS OF THE ECONOMY, ALL OF. THIS ADDS UP TO AN UNPRECEDENTED<br />
ERA OF ECONOMIC EXPANSION AND PROSPERITY IN COLLIE AND THE<br />
SOUTHWEST REGION, AND IN THE WHOLE WESTERN AUSTRALIAN ECONOMY,<br />
IT ALSO REPRESENTS A SUBSTANTIAL CONTRIBUTION TO THE ECONOMIC<br />
RECONSTRUCTION OF AUSTRALIA, ALONG LINES THAT PROVIDE SECURE<br />
JOBS BASED ON MAKING EFFECTIVE USE OF AUSTRALIA'S COMPETITIVE<br />
ADVANTAGES IN INTERNATIONAL TRADE. IT REPRESENTS A SUBSTANTIAL<br />
CONTRIBUTION TO THE RESTORATION OF THE FORTUNES OF AUSTRALIA'S<br />
TROUBLED HEAVY ENGINEERING INDUSTRY.<br />
THESE MAJOR NEW DEVELOPMENTS ALL OF THEM COMING WITHIN<br />
REACH ONLY IN THESE LAST FEW MONTHS SINCE WORK ON THE CURRENT<br />
BUDGET WASCOMPLETED ARE A REWARD FOR THE PROGRESS THAT<br />
HAS BEEN MADE IN IMPROVNG AUSTRALIAN COMPETITIVENESS AND<br />
RE-ESTABLISHING STABLE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. THESE NEW<br />
DEVELOPMENTS HAVE BEEN ASSISTED SIGNIFICANTLY BY THE BUSINESS<br />
TAXATION INITIATIVES ANNOUNCED IN THE BUDGET, INCLUDING THE<br />
PROVISIONS FOR GROUP TAXATION, MORE RAPID DEPRECIATION OF<br />
INCOME-EARNING BUILDINGS, AND THE ONE-YEAR PARTIAL EXTENSION<br />
OF THE INVESTMENT ALLOWANCE. </p>
<p>Aeov 19, e4 107K' 5, PERTH PRIME MIN. STEt. O1* jrICE 3_<br />
8.<br />
BUT LET ME MAKE ONE POINT CLEAR: THIS GOVERNMENT DOES NOT<br />
LOOK TO EXPANSION IN THE RESOURCES SECTOR ALONE FOR MAINTAINING<br />
STRONG GROWTH IN THE AUSTRALIAN ECONOMY.<br />
WE ARE SEEKING TO PROMOTE STRONG PERFORMANCE ACROSS ALL SECTORS,<br />
AND NOT A LOP-SIDED RESOURCES BOOM.<br />
IT WAS THE HEIGHT OF FOOLISHNESS FOR THE LIBERAL AND -NATIONAL<br />
PARTIES IN GOVERNMENT TO BELIEVE THAT STRONG GROWTH IN ONE SECTOR<br />
COULD SOLVE THE PROBLEMS THAT THEY HAD CREATED FOR AUSTRALIA.<br />
ONE IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF THE RESOURCE SECTOR, COAL MINING ON THE<br />
EAST COAST, WILL BE A MAJOR FOCUS OF CONCERN FOR THE NEW LABOR<br />
GOVERNMENT AS WE ADDRESS PROBLEMS ARISING FROM THE OVER-CAPACITY<br />
ESTABLISHED IN THE SO-CALLED RESOURCES BOOM, WHICH WILL CONTINUE<br />
FOR SOME TIME DESPITE EXTRAORDINARILY STRONG GROWTH IN PRODUCTION<br />
AND EXPORT VOLUMES.<br />
WE ARE SEEKING WELL-BALANCED GROWTH IN AUSTRALIA, WITH ALL<br />
SECTORS CONTRlBUTING THEIR PARTICULAR STRENGTHS.<br />
FROM NEXT YEAR, WITH THE RESOURCES SECTOR AGAIN CONTRIBUTING<br />
STRONGLY TO GROWTH IN THE ECONOMY, WE ARE SU1PERBLY PLACED TO<br />
MAINTAIN THE POSITION THAT WE HAVE ESTABLISHED FOR OURSELVES<br />
SINCE MID-1983,. AMONGST THE FRONTRUNNERS OF THE WORLD' S ADVANCED<br />
ECONOMI ES. </p>
