FOR PRESS: P. M. No. 17/ 1968<br />
VISIT BY CAMBODIAN FOR'S IGN MINISTER<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, Senator John Gorton<br />
The Foreign Minister of Cambodia, His Highness Prince<br />
Norodom Phurissara, will shortly make an official visit to Australia.<br />
He will be accompanied by his wife. Detailed arrangements are still<br />
being made, but the Prince will be a guest of the Australian Governent<br />
and it is likely that he will arrive in Australia towards the end of<br />
February. I am very pleased that hie is making this visit. It will<br />
be recalled that Prince Phurissara paid a visit to Australia In December<br />
as the Cambodian Government's representative at the Memorial Service<br />
for the late Prime Minister. This greatly appreciated gesture by the<br />
Cambodian Government provided the opportunity for useful discussions.<br />
Further discussions covering a wide range of matters of interest to the<br />
two Governments will now be possible.<br />
I hope that on this occasion the Prince will also be able<br />
to see something of Australia, its people, development and way of life.<br />
CANBERRA, 1st February, 1963. </p>
