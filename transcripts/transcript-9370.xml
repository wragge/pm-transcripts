TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING MP<br />
ADDRESS TO THE 1994 SUPERMARKET SHOW. DARLING HARBOUR, SYDNEY,<br />
MONDAY, 3 OCTOBER 1994<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
Thank you very much Jim Fleming. distinguished guests and ladles and gentlemen.<br />
Well, it Is a very groot plooure Indeed to come to the 1004 Supermarkot Show. My<br />
contact with supermarkets Is fairly thin these days, but I occasionally dash in to buy<br />
something mostly something for my children but. one Is always been Impressed with<br />
the competition and the quality of the things which are sold In Australian supermarkets and<br />
the way they are presented, the nature of the stores, and it comes as really no surprise to<br />
me at all that the Australian Supermarket Industry in presentation, in competition, in<br />
pricing, as Jim Fleming remarked in turn-over, ranks up there with the best in the world.<br />
In fact. I'm sure some in Australia would believe better than any in the world. And, this has<br />
been a good thing for the Australian consumer and again, as Jim Fleming remarked, a<br />
good thing In restrainlng the prices In Australia and restraining Inflation because this Is a<br />
very large Industry which turns over something like $ 17 billion a year and it has a decided<br />
Impact on the standard of living of Australians the way they live and the quality of the<br />
things they bury.<br />
So, we have got much in this country to celebrate, I think, in the way in which our retail<br />
sectors have developed over time and its, I think, a wonderful thing that the Australian<br />
Retail Institute has developed this Supermarket Show so that the Industry can get togothor<br />
and look at trends and discuss changes and we can also invite colleagues from around the<br />
world including. of course, the Asia Pacific area where now Australian retailers and<br />
wholesalers are starting to do business, and to try to make those connections and<br />
underwrite some of the things we might do together.<br />
I think that those of you, particularly from abroad, would have some idea of the perhaps<br />
quiet sense of confidence that Australians currently enjoy about themselves, about their<br />
country and about our economy. We were the first western country out of the world<br />
recession. We are now growing somewhere between four and five per cent and as a<br />
consequence we are seeing now a lift in employment and prosperity resuming once more.<br />
By contrast, most of the western economies are growing at the moment on an average of<br />
per cent. So. Australia's growth Is nearly double that of comparable countries and as a<br />
consequence there Is a feeling of confidence about the place and Investment Is starting to<br />
pick up again and wo are ltaiting to sco a long run, low Infltiounary recoveoy ahead of us<br />
through the 1990s. And, I think, this is very encouraging for Australians that this position is </p>
<p>here because we have changed much about Australia In the last 10 years. Ten years ago<br />
this was a very Inward looking economy with a ring fence, bound by tariffs, with a<br />
managed exchange rate, wilt a scleiowUi; fnancial market, with a government budgetary<br />
policy which was out of sorts with private Investment in this country and as a consequence<br />
we were growing at a very small rate and we had very low omployment growth and high<br />
unemployment Today we have still got high unemployment, but It Is off a massive level of participation In<br />
the work force. If we had the same number of people looking for work today as we had in<br />
1984 we would have unemployment at under 6 per cent. But now, because there are so<br />
many people looking for work, particularly women with an enormous increase In the<br />
participation rate for women we still have relatively high unemployment, but we are now<br />
starting to see tremendous employment growth. In fact. over the last year we have had<br />
employment growth of about four per cent.<br />
This, I think, matters a great deal to greta because evory year the Government has<br />
been in office real household disposable income has risen because there are more people<br />
In households In work. So, while there has been a change in relative wages over the<br />
decade, the relative price of labour tias changed and been reduced. The number of<br />
people in households working has risen so that there was a very strong growth In<br />
household disposable income over the decade and that has driven retail sales and it has<br />
driven consumption which in turn has driven Investment And, I think, if one looks to the<br />
growth of the supermarket Industry through the 1980s and early 1990s one finds that what<br />
is the driving force behind it not simply population growth but the workforce growth and<br />
the rise In household disposable income which has come with It thats resuming again<br />
with, as I say, four per cent employment growth this year. So, we are going to start to scc<br />
again a fairly strong pick up in household disposable Income during the period.<br />
The other thing I think that Is worth saying to our partners from abroad Is that by and large<br />
the Australian economy is in size just under the combined GDP of the ASEAN economies.<br />
A couple of years ago we wore about the somo. I think the AS. economies together<br />
are slightly now ahead of Australia. That Is, In Australian dollars at aboLt $ 410 billion of<br />
product. So. when you get an economy of this sl7a growing at four or five per cent one is<br />
creating thu equivalent of $ 15 to $ 20 billion of extra value, extra wealth every year and that<br />
is driving a tremendous amount of investment and consumption In this counly. ILit lw one<br />
the reasons why there Is no substitute for growth for employment and there is no substitute<br />
for growth for wealth and why, I think, the retail sectors have done very well and why, I<br />
think, it is a good place to do busine. ss. In this country we have a corporate tax rate of 33<br />
per cent about the same as Singapore, but this Is not a city state. This is a nation<br />
continent with a very sophisticated level of public services and to provide that with a<br />
corporate rate of 33 per cent is really at the leading edge of tax rates around the world for<br />
corporations. As well as that, as domestic share holders will know, we have In this country a system of<br />
full dividend Imputation. That is, we don't tax dividends twice, we do not classically tax<br />
company income. So, we give our shareholders a tax credit for the company tax paid<br />
when they rocolvo a dividend In their hands. This, along with vast acceleration and<br />
appreciation makes this just about, In western world terms, the finest corporate tax system </p>
<p>In the western world and certainly comparabla to any country which is even near<br />
comparable with Australia In the Asia Pacific.<br />
So, all these things, I think, are bull points for growth and for the future and we have, as<br />
Jim Fleming said, been able to provide Australian consumors with high quality goods at<br />
very fine margins. I mean, a few years ago one would have to go to speciality shops to<br />
find sophisticated foods and pay a very high margin on them. Today you would expect to<br />
find these In supermarkets and that Is because, I think, of the ambition, thU aubitiuus<br />
attitude of supermarket proprietors In this country and food wholesalers and retailers, that<br />
they want to stock those Items and deal In them. And this, of course, improves the spico of<br />
life for Australians and the food they consume and, of course, it guarantees them these<br />
products at much finer prices and thinner margins.<br />
So, retailing has done a lot for Australia, but competition here is very Intense and one of<br />
the by-products of that Intonsity is, I think, it has distractcd some of the major companies<br />
from looking at the Asia Pacific in particular or further afield to North American and West<br />
European markets. As a consequence. I think, we are missing opporhinities now in this<br />
part of the world partlcularly. Yuu nutic heur we have had a substantial history of<br />
mergers and acquisitions In retailing now over an extended period of time. In fact we have<br />
the heaviest retailing sector companios In the world. Companies like Colcs-Myer and<br />
Woolw [ ths have unprecedented market shares in world terms. I think Coles-Myer has<br />
something like ten times the size of market penetration as say a comparahln, the first<br />
comparable US corporatiun. So, Lhre Is a very heavy concentration and the Government<br />
has made It fairly clear to the major retailers, competition is one thing, but attempts at sort<br />
of monopolisation of tho market in the end dont do any of us any good.<br />
So, In a sense punching each others eyes out for another one per cent of market share Is<br />
rairly counter productive when one can open themselves up to retailing in China, in<br />
Vietnam, in the established markets like Singapore and Thailand wlere Ausltalian retail<br />
capacity and rotailing skills can really lay down the foundations for the retailing sectors of<br />
countries and regions.<br />
So. I'd say that the Government would be urging Australian retailing and wholesaling<br />
companies to go abroad and to find opportunities and relieve Uteumselvus arnd the Trac<br />
Practices Commission of the burden of reminding them that large market shares are fine,<br />
but to go beyond that essentially establishes a real tyranny for food supplors and clothing<br />
suppliers and others who have to deal with very large quasl-monopoly businesses.<br />
Now, I am delighted we au starting to see this trend. We have seen Davids' Holdings<br />
John David Is here this morning go to the Asia Pacific area into co-operative ventures, in<br />
Singapore in Indonesia and In other places. And, it is this sort of outward view that while<br />
the Australian economy is growing quite fast In western world terms, in terms of population<br />
growth we will still have modest popuilatin and a modest absolute size to our consumer<br />
markeutt copared with the growth in population In some of the countries I have mentioned<br />
and, of course, the absolute size and rise of Incomes in those markets. So, the markut<br />
opportunities abound vory cloce to Australia whore it Is possible to ship food stuffs chilled<br />
not frozen, perishables things which years ago we couldn't consider and where we can<br />
establish the style of retailing or it not establish it certainly amend and change and adapt<br />
the style of retailing In those markets. And. I think, this Is a very important thing and I </p>
<p>certainly congratulate those companies that have gone out there and have taken those<br />
first steps to establish real market and growth opportunities for themselves, realising that<br />
to stay In Australia and try to take over another wholesaler or another retailer, to have<br />
another argument about competition policy, to fuither cunsrain the options of<br />
manufacturers, to squeezo further wholesalers from the business and in the case of the<br />
retail mergers Is by and large a pretty counter-productive activity.<br />
So, I hope that our retailing sectors will now really understand that they have developod<br />
here something really competitive and really good and that they can lake It out as a<br />
product. That their systems, their warchousing, their retailing, they can take out as a<br />
product to the Asia Pacificare Indeed, they can then buy market share In other countries<br />
or develop buslne. sss in other countries, say in North America and Europe, where<br />
retailing Is no more a developed art than it Is In this country.<br />
So, at any rato, we arc told that there Is $ 160 billion of growth In Asia In food a lot of it<br />
western foods and there is a great opportunity here and a great opportunity exists, not<br />
just to retailers but, for our food Industries In particular the Agri-Foods business and It is<br />
woith, I tliik, noting that growth In Australian high value food exports currently exceed 18<br />
per cent a year and the Industry looks set to pass our Agri-Food Council's target of $ 7<br />
billion of high value food exports by the Year 2000. So, there Is a tremendous, I think,<br />
chance to sell what Australia does best, that Is high quality food, foods with disease free<br />
status which Is fairly unique In this part of the world and to capitalise on tho food<br />
technologies which Australia does well. So, there Is no rason. I think, why we would<br />
leave the growth of these products and the growth of retail to the Sogos or Makros or<br />
Park'n Shops or any of these other people, we have got to be out thera basically doing<br />
these things ourselves.<br />
Now. In terms of our own Industry, retailing acrrmnts for a very great number of<br />
employcos, I think in the orde or hal a million plus people, and it Is continuing to adapt<br />
and change and the Government has now sought to try to change the training agenda so<br />
that retailing can pick up and train young people and actually pick them up from school<br />
and train them while they are at school. A couple of weeks ago at a shopping mall in<br />
Gosford I launched the Australian Student Traineeship Foundation which is letting young<br />
people in years 11 and 12 pick up TAFE training technical and urther education,<br />
vocational training while at school to give them accreditation in a TAFE coursesoey<br />
can also do on-the job training while they are In their school years. So, wo can start to<br />
stream young people In years 11 and 12 into vocational education and Into work and work<br />
experience. And, the kny change In all of this is that In vocational education the<br />
Government wants to see Industry essentially shaping the training agenda. Once it was<br />
true In this country that In our vocational education, In TAFE as we call it. technical and<br />
further education, the product of the system was the product divined by the suppliers or the<br />
education themselves formerly trades people or spoclaliscd people who were thon<br />
teaching what they knew to their student bodies and that was the product which Industry<br />
then took. What we are trying to do is to get industry to decide what product they want and<br />
then change the training profile of thu vocaional educational Instltutns to give them the<br />
kind of trainees and people with the ss they nood and this Is whlum, I think, the<br />
Involvement of let's say In retailing, the rotall sector in vocational education and in the<br />
student foundation traineeships is, I think, going to be a very Important dovelopment in<br />
Australia.<br />
L </p>
<p>Now. we have now developed a body called NE-XF l and NETTFORCE is to seek<br />
the development of trainltig comrpanles In particular sectors of Australian industry. So. In<br />
the metals Industry there will be a training company. In tie ritail industry there will be a<br />
training company. In other induotrlcs, In the motor car Industry, there will be a training<br />
company. That will mean that any company In that sector can actually go to tho company<br />
which it owns shares In and be advised and directed how It can best train young<br />
Australians for their own purposes, for the purposes of that Industry or that particular<br />
business. This comes as an initiative from the White Paper called ' Wurking NaUton' that I<br />
had the pleasure of Introducing some months ago and, I think, we will see with<br />
NETTFORCE and I know there is already a retail training company establishcd that we<br />
will start to see some real progress In companies seeking then advice and direction for<br />
their own training nueds from their very own Industry training company.<br />
Now, in this you know tho Government has been committed to the long-term unemployed<br />
In the White Paper Working Nation'. And this has two very important things about it. The<br />
first thing IS we are saying as a society we won't have an underclass. If the Americans<br />
want an undeiclass they can have one. If the British want an underclass they can have<br />
one. But, we won't have one. We are not going to have a section of the community drop<br />
off and find thomselves living on charity or living In the streets or on sub-poverty Incomes.<br />
And the other thing about It Is why should just a proportion of the workforco carry the butt<br />
of Structural adjustment or in the past. the recession? Why shouldn't we get them back<br />
Into thU labour market? Why should the new jobs only go to those new entrants to the<br />
workforce? And, we are having a great deal of success. We have got a program here as<br />
many of you know colled JOBSTART which Is a Government subsidised labour maiket<br />
program. Last year 150,000 people got jobs under JOBSTART, 70 per cent of them were<br />
long-term unamployed and the retention rate, that is the rate of retention by businocscs<br />
after the subsidy finishes Is exceptionally high indeed. So, we are s. oing now In this last<br />
year more long-term unemployed people picked up Uhan we have evor seen. certainly In<br />
the last 10 or 15 years.<br />
In the past three years nearly a quarter of a million in this country with a workforco of just<br />
on eight million, this Is a big number nearly a quarter of a million long term unemployed<br />
people have bccn hired by employeis Uthuugh JOBSTART subsidies alone. And, as you<br />
know we have introduced as part of Working Nation' a new training wage which is set<br />
between $ 125 and $ 333 and payable to all unemployed people and new entrants to the<br />
labour force. Together with JOBSTART the training wage means an employer con receive<br />
subsidies ranging from $ 5.000 to for taking on a long-term unemployed person.<br />
So, that Is $ 100-$ 160 a week subsidy If an employer takes on a long-term unemplnyed<br />
person. By doing this, by changing the nature of TAPE, by getting the balance right between<br />
tertiary education and vocational education as we see that four per cent employment<br />
growth we want to be pulling up tho long-term unemployed with it because, I think, the<br />
other thing that people have got to understand In ite Industy, and this Is Including<br />
retailing, and that is skills formation in this recovery Is not going to come from migration. It<br />
Is going to come from our own labour market So, to avoid bottlenecks and wage<br />
pressures as the recovery continues to strengthen we have to have a greater complement<br />
of trained people coming In to the labour market and that has tn come. amongst other </p>
<p>places, from the body of 300,000 odd of long-term unemployed people. But, the whole<br />
focus or traineeships and training Is there because the Government and it is worth<br />
recalling this ten years ago only three children In ten completed secondary school In this<br />
country. Last year that was eight in ten and the Government has now added 65 per cent<br />
of extra places to univorsities since 1985. So. we now have not just a very high retention<br />
rate In secondary schools, but we have also provided the university places for those<br />
students as they leave. So. our proportion of university places to tha school aged<br />
secondary population Is as high as any In the wurld. The weakness In Australian<br />
education has boon the Cindcrclla status of vocational education TATE. That is why In<br />
' One Nation' in 1992 I announced the formation of the Australian National Training<br />
Authority which has a national system of TAFE and where we are trying to develop TAFE<br />
Into a national system to bring vocational education up to equal status with the universities.<br />
So, a student has a real choice, that is, an accredited nation wide certlficate of status from<br />
TAFE or a tertiary education and a tertiary degree.<br />
In this way, we will be able to meet the training needs of Australia as we continue to<br />
produce elaborately transformed products and elaborately transformed exports be they in<br />
manufacturing or in food or ulucliunics or whereever It Is we will need a trained workforce.<br />
One of Australia's great comparative advantages is education. There is only one other<br />
country In the Asia Pacific with an education systom like Australia and that is Japan and<br />
we should play to our comparative advantage and our comparative strengths by making<br />
certain that the output of our education system kicks along product innovation In this<br />
county and allows us to sell exports competitively to the rest of the world.<br />
So, this, I think, Is an important thing for the country, for the economy, for the workforce<br />
and for retailing because retailing is such a large employer and the skills changos are<br />
going to need to be there to koop it at the forefront of ratailing techniques and abilities<br />
throughout the balance of this decade.<br />
So, perhaps let me wind up on thcoo points. To say firstly thank you very much for inviting<br />
me to come. I think it is a very good thing that the Supermarket Show exists, that people<br />
can actually exchange views, talk about developments In their Industry whore matters of<br />
moment can be discussed, but It Is a particularly Important opportunity, I think, for<br />
International visitors to come to Australia and to get to know our retailers and our<br />
wholosalers and our diotributors in the various sectors and to see what opportunities they<br />
can take and also our manufacturers, to see what products can come from Australia and<br />
go on the shelves of supermarkets in thA region In which we live. This, I think, is very<br />
Important to us.<br />
I'd like to underline again just how competitive our supermarket and retail industry In this<br />
country is and just again make the point, as Jim Fleming did, this Is a bull point for lower<br />
prices and for restraining Inflation. We have got inflation now at somowhore between<br />
and 2 per cent and we want to keep low Inflation very much in the torafrnnt of our mind In<br />
terms of economic policy and prices in relailing Is an Important component and will always<br />
be an important component of that And, the other thing is we will continue to wuik on<br />
training and finally the Government will continue to encourage the development of an<br />
outward looking retail sector as these rapidly growing markets in Asia emerge and where<br />
we can obviously see or see obviously our capacity to participate in thnse markets and not<br />
simply to participate, but In actually slaping them and shaping their fUture. </p>
<p>7<br />
So. perhaps Ict me finish by congratutadng the Australia ' n S&amp; perrrkt Institute once<br />
again for this veiy Impressive superiuiarkel show and I look torward With some substangal<br />
relish to the exhibits and to meeting somne of you who make this industry tkk.<br />
Thiank you very much Indeed.<br />
