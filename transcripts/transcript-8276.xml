SPEECH FOR THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
OPENING OF NOMURA COURT<br />
AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL GALLERY<br />
CANBERRA 27 MARCH 1991<br />
This function marks a very significant date in the<br />
development of the Australian National Gallery: the opening<br />
of Nomura Court, the permanent home for the Gallery's<br />
magnificent collection of Asian art.<br />
Nomura Court has been made possible by a generous donation<br />
to the ANG Foundation by Nomura Securities Company Ltd, one<br />
of the world's leading investment banks.<br />
want to express, on behalf of the Australian National<br />
Gallery, the Australian Government and the Australian<br />
people, our collective and heartfelt gratitude for this<br />
superb gift : by Nomura.<br />
In particular I want to thank the President of Nomura<br />
Securities, Mr Tabuchi, who has travelled from Japan to be<br />
here for this opening, for his generous support and<br />
encouragement for this venture.<br />
It needs to be emphasised that the gift by Nomura is the<br />
largest single donation ever made to the ANG and the only<br />
donation to ' be made for a construction project.<br />
As a result of this unprecedented generosity, Australians<br />
will for the first time be able adequately to appreciate the<br />
Gallery's Asian art collection a collection that has been<br />
assembled over a number of years, and which is still<br />
. growing,-but-which. has so far-either been in storage or<br />
dispersed in displays elsewhere in the Gallery.<br />
With this consolidated and coherent display area, an<br />
exciting future lies ahead for Asian art at the ANG.<br />
Nomura Court, and the collection it now holds, demonstrate<br />
in a tangible way Australia's growing involvement in the<br />
Asia-Pacific region, our increasing enmeshment in the<br />
dynamic economies of the region, and our determination to </p>
<p>strengthen the links between, and our understanding of, the<br />
peoples and cultures of the region.<br />
The ANG itself is working to establish closer links of<br />
co-operation and exchange with other national cultural<br />
institutions in the region.<br />
At the same time, Nomura Court testifies to the depth and<br />
strength of the relationship between Australia and Japan,<br />
reflecting the close and enduring links between our two<br />
countries and the confidence with which we look forward to<br />
the future as constructive partners and friends.<br />
Australia's relationship with Japan has long been<br />
underscored by the strength of our trade and commercial<br />
ties. Japan is by far Australia's largest trading partner,<br />
taking over 25% of our exports.<br />
But our relationship is a much richer and more diverse one<br />
than this. Australia and Japan are becoming closer as<br />
countries because Australians and Japanese are becoming<br />
closer as people.<br />
In 1990 more visitors came to Australia from Japan than from<br />
any other country and by the year 2000 it is estimated<br />
that a million and a half Japanese visitors will come each<br />
year to Australia.<br />
So it is very heartening, and very proper, that we should<br />
see here in the Australian National Gallery this proof of<br />
the deep and diverse friendship between Australia and Japan.<br />
In every respect this new gallery accords with the ANG's<br />
goal of providing greater access for all Australians to a<br />
world class national collection, and to do so on the basis<br />
of secure and broad based financial support.<br />
The Federal Government, of course, has been the major<br />
financial supporter of the ANG from its earliest days well<br />
before the opening of this building in 1982 to its<br />
operation today as a nationally and internationally renowned<br />
art institution.<br />
We will continue to play our part in the ANG's future.<br />
At the same time there is an ever-present need for the<br />
private sector to play a role in supporting our national<br />
. cultural-. institutions, including the ANG, for the benefit of<br />
the whole community.<br />
The Nomura donation is a magnificent example of the kind of<br />
support which the private sector can provide and as art<br />
prices and other costs rise, this sponsorship will become<br />
even more necessary.<br />
Let me in closing congratulate everyone involved in the<br />
Nomura Court project here at the Gallery; the professional </p>
<p>3<br />
work of the entire ANG staff, led by Betty Churcher, is<br />
readily apparent tonight.<br />
In particular, let me pay tribute to the Council of the ANG,<br />
and not least to its former Chairman, Gough Whitlam, whose<br />
long-held desire, and long-sustained efforts, on behalf of<br />
this project are today brought to a triumphant conclusion.<br />
It now gives me much pleasure to declare Nomura Court open. </p>
