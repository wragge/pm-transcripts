STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
THE RIGHT HONOU ALo. 3I ROBI: T iMEvNZIZS<br />
IN THE HOUSE OF T1LP1ESENTATIVES<br />
ACADEMIC SALARIES<br />
Honourable members will recall that last year,<br />
when announcing the Government's programme of aid for<br />
universities during the 1964-66 triennium, I foreshadowed<br />
the establishment of an Inquiry to advise the Government on<br />
the levels of academic salaries which could appropriately be<br />
adopted by the Coionwrealth for the purpose of calculating<br />
recurrent grants for universities.<br />
We have now reached certain decisions about this<br />
Inquiry. It will be conducted by Mr. Justice Eggleston of<br />
the Commonwealth Industrial Court and of the Supreme Courts<br />
of the A. C. T. and Norfolk Island.<br />
The Government will appoint two assessors whose<br />
function will be to assist the Inquiry with expert advice and<br />
analysis based on a special knowledge of universities and<br />
government interests in the subject. I have written to the<br />
Chairman of the Vice-Chancellors Committee and to the President<br />
of the Federation of Australian University Staff Associations,<br />
inviting them to submit jointly a panel of three names for<br />
the Government to consider when appointing the assessor with<br />
special knowledge of the universities interest. The other<br />
assessor will be a person with experience in government service.<br />
The terms of reference of the Inquiry are<br />
To advise the Government on the standard<br />
salary or range of salaries for a professor and the<br />
standard salary range for a reader or associate<br />
professor which the Inquiry considers should be<br />
adopted as a measure of academic salaries to be<br />
used by the Australian Universities Commission<br />
for the purpose of recommending grants to be<br />
made to universities, including the Australian<br />
National University, for recurrent expenditure.<br />
It is our intention that the Inquiry should<br />
proceed in an atmosphere of informality and without being<br />
given a statutory basis. It will thus dispense with sworn<br />
evidence, verbatim records and public hearings. Actual procedure<br />
will be a matter for decision and announcement by Mr. Justice<br />
Eggleston. In due course, the Inquiry will be comnnunicating<br />
with interested parties to invite them to submit views in writing.<br />
I would remind honourable members that the Commonwealth<br />
fully accepts that salaries paid in a State university<br />
are, and must remain, ultimately a matter for that university<br />
and its State Government. The basic purpose of the present<br />
Inquiry is to provide guidance for the Commonwealth and, as<br />
already announced, its findings will be applied retrospectively<br />
to 1st January, 1964 in relation to recurrent grants offered<br />
by the Commonwealth to States for their universities. The<br />
Commonwealth will also adopt the findings as a basis for its<br />
recurrent grants to the Australian National University from the<br />
same date. </p>
