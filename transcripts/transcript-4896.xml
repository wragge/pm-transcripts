PRESS OFFICE TRANSCRIPT<br />
Channel 7 6.30 p. m. news broadcast.<br />
PRIME MINISTER AND MR HAWKE ON INDUSTRIAL DISPUTES.<br />
Roger Climpson:<br />
Prime Minister Fraser indicated today that the Government will<br />
take a much tougher line in future in industrial disputes.<br />
Addressing the Wool and Meat Producers Federation in Canberra,<br />
he referred to the recent move to de-register the T. W. U. during<br />
the threatened nation-wide petrol strike.<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
There are always discussions, and if you wait for one lot of<br />
discussions to end they will say you mustn't do it now because<br />
there are more discussions scheduled for three days time. In<br />
any case, those provisions of the law take some time to<br />
implement. In the case of de-registration maybe two or three<br />
weeks, it could be even longer. And we determined-in that<br />
circumstance that we weren't going to wait for the results of<br />
any discussions, but we were going to act under the provisions<br />
of the law and of the powers available under the Commonwealth<br />
and that didn't pre-empt the results of any discussions. They<br />
can go on and hopefully achieve the result, but at the same<br />
time we believe the Australian community and many working men<br />
and women in Australia have paid too high a price for the<br />
disputes that have occurred and in this particular instance<br />
would certainly have paid a very high price indeed if the<br />
dispute had continued.<br />
Bob Hawke:<br />
Well one can obviously understand this beleaguered Prime Minister<br />
who on every available electoral test that arises now has been<br />
rejected by the Australian electorate, and rightly is being<br />
rejected. You can understand that he is pursuing the only path<br />
that he has ever indicated that he knows, and that is ' let's<br />
have a union bash'. I think that the Australian people, as<br />
proven in the electoral results, are heartily sick and tired<br />
of this confrontationist approach of the Prime Minister.<br />
