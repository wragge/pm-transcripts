E RGY PRIME MINISTER<br />
CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
POINT NEPEAN HANDOVER CEREMONY<br />
PT. NEPEAN 18 SEPTEMBER 1988<br />
ed s Premier John Cain,<br />
Joan Kirner,. Minister for Conservation,<br />
and Forests and Lands,<br />
Distinguished Guests,<br />
Ladies and Gentlemen.<br />
in For the past one hundred and eleven years the people of<br />
Victoria have been unable to enjoy the magnificent landscape<br />
of Point Nepean because this spectacular piece of Victoria's<br />
natural environment has been devoted to defence purposes<br />
rather than to recreation.<br />
In 1877 the land was gazetted to allow the Army to build<br />
fortifications here.<br />
Those were the days when the fleet of the Russian navy was<br />
expected any day to appear through the Heads. Forts were<br />
built here and at Queenscliff, Williamstown and elsewhere in<br />
Y. Port Phillip so that during the 1890s, the era of marvellous<br />
Melbourne, it was claimed that Port Phillip was the most<br />
fltry heavily defended port in the British Empire south of the<br />
equator. Upon Federation in 1901 the Commonwealth acquired the land<br />
and Point Nepean came ultimately to be devoted to the Army<br />
officer Cadet School.<br />
Now that the cadets have been transferred to Canberra the<br />
land has at last been freed up so that with the exception<br />
of the parcel being retained for the Army School of Healththis<br />
land can be returned to the people of Victoria.<br />
So it is a very great pleasure to be here and to hand over<br />
this land to the people of Victoria and to join with my<br />
friend and colleague, John Cain, in opening Point Nepean<br />
Park. Point Nepean Park is a project in which the Commonwealth and<br />
Victorian Governments have co-operated closely and well to<br />
provide the public with access to a beautiful part of<br />
Australia's natural heritage. 2067 </p>
<p>This is an important site in the history of this State and<br />
of this nation especially because of the unique role it<br />
played in the First and Second World Wars.<br />
Point Nepean fortress was operated and staffed from 1892<br />
until the end of the Second World War. But only two angry<br />
shots were ever fired from these six inch guns the first<br />
Australian shots of both world War I and World War II were<br />
fired from Point Nepean.<br />
Gun Barrel number 1489 fired the first shot of World War I<br />
to prevent the German steamer Pfalz leaving the bay on<br />
August 1914.<br />
Gun Barrel number 1317 fired the first Allied shot of<br />
World War II as a warning shot at a Bass Strait trader which<br />
had failed to identify itself.<br />
It is my pleasure to announce that these historically<br />
significant guns will be given by the Commonwealth on<br />
permanent loan to Victoria.<br />
These guns, which belong to the Department of Defence and<br />
have for years been located at the entrance to this<br />
property, will be relocated to a site very close to their<br />
original emplacements. The guns were restored by cadets at<br />
the former Officer Cadet School and will provide visitors<br />
with an authentic experience of the historic Fort Nepean.<br />
Point Nepean Park also includes Cheviot Beach from which the<br />
former Prime Minister Harold Holt disappeared while swimming<br />
in 1967. As part of the restoration work, the memorial to<br />
Harold Holt will be relocated from the beach to Cheviot<br />
Hill.<br />
Apart from its historical value, this area is also justly<br />
famous for its spectacular rugged landscape. This is an<br />
area of virtually undisturbed coastal vegetation. It is the<br />
habitat for some unique species of flora and fauna, and is<br />
the only known breeding site of the Dominican Gull. It<br />
looks now much as it must have looked to the Aboriginal<br />
inhabitants of this area when they first saw Lt. John Murray<br />
sail through the Heads in 1802 in the Lady Nelson.<br />
My Government has always placed strong emphasis on joint<br />
conservation activities with State and Territory<br />
Governments. It is encouraging that Victoria gives such<br />
high priority to the protection and preservation of the<br />
natural environment so that it can be enjoyed by all<br />
Australians. Local residents may be the principal beneficiaries of this<br />
new Park they are already lucky because of the tremendous<br />
natural attractions of the Mornington Peninsula but Point<br />
Nepean Park will without doubt attract visitors from the<br />
rest of the State and the rest of Australia.<br />
2068 I </p>
<p>For all these reasons, it is very appropriate that Point<br />
Nepean Park is one of the major projects in the<br />
Commonwealth-State Bicentennial Commemorative Program.<br />
Under the Program the Commonwealth and the States are<br />
jointly funding lasting, accessible and practical legacies<br />
of the Bicentenary.<br />
Victoria has undertaken a number of innovative projects<br />
which provide better access to the State's natural<br />
environment. Walking and cycling tracks have been<br />
established and upgraded along Melbourne's waterways, and<br />
tracks in the alpine region and along the routes of the<br />
explorers, Major Mitchell and Baldwin Spencer, have also<br />
been developed.<br />
I congratulate the Victorian Government for developing such<br />
innovative projects under the Commonwealth-State<br />
Bicentennial Commemorative Program.<br />
I am very happy to be here today to hand over to the Premier<br />
and the people of Victoria the Commonwealth land for the<br />
Point Nepean Park. 2069 </p>
