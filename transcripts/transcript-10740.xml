    <content><![CDATA[<p>E&amp;OE....................................................................................................</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>I notice you've taken up golf and I'm organising a game</p>
<p>   that I'd like you to attend, are you available on either October</p>
<p>   3, 10 or 17?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, can I check? I have received a few dinner invitations for</p>
<p>   the night of the 17th of October, largely from interviewers</p>
<p>   like you who are asking the same question in a similar form.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>Oh, we'll go back to the club house afterwards, don't</p>
<p>   worry about that.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Okay. I'll get my diary secretary to come back to you, Howard.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>Would you play golf on an election date?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Probably not, that might be looking a little too laid back. </p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>So one of those dates will be out, will it?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, that doesn't mean that at all. I'm just answering</p>
<p>   in a generic fashion.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>Okay, I'm sort of just wiping out weekends here. Would you</p>
<p>   consider going to a poll on the long weekend?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Howard, I'm not ruling any weekend out other than the weekend</p>
<p>   of the grand finals.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>Because the voters of New South Wales, Tasmania and the ACT wouldn't</p>
<p>   be too pleased about you going to an election on October the 3rd,</p>
<p>   would they, because a lot of them are going to be away?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, it's all hypothetical.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>I know it is, but I mean...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>We are wasting a lot of time on a hypothetical question.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>All right, well are you prepared then Â let's get to</p>
<p>   the tax package because that's what you are doing...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Are you prepared to sign a legally binding contract with the Australian</p>
<p>   electorate that you will honour all aspects of your tax package</p>
<p>   if your Government is re-elected?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Look, I am making a commitment before the Australian public. They</p>
<p>   can vote for it or they can vote against it. In the end that is</p>
<p>   the ultimate that any political figure can do. And you can play</p>
<p>   around with signing documents, I mean, I saw Bob Carr talk about</p>
<p>   signing things in blood. I mean, those sort of things are gimmicks.</p>
<p>   In the end people listen to what you say, they make an assessment</p>
<p>   of whether what you are saying is credible and whether you are credible.</p>
<p>   Now, I put myself on the line, when the election comes, to the Australian</p>
<p>   people and it is for each individual Australian to decide whether</p>
<p>   he or she will support the plan I'm putting forward. It is</p>
<p>   not going to be advanced or diminished by these silly little gimmicks.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>I know that but if you want the Australian public to trust you,</p>
<p>   and there is a problem between the electorate and politicians on</p>
<p>   that spectrum, on trust, why wouldn't you sign a document like</p>
<p>   that?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Howard, I don't think trust is advanced by gimmicks. I think</p>
<p>   trust is advanced by what you do compared with what you say. Now,</p>
<p>   one thing I will say to the Australian people about this tax plan,</p>
<p>   among many things, and that is that it is big, we are in a sense</p>
<p>   asking them to accept the good as well as the not so good. We're</p>
<p>   saying you can't have the good bits without the hard bits.</p>
<p>   We're not just offering a lazy tax bribe before the election.</p>
<p>   We are saying to the Australian people, unless we are prepared to</p>
<p>   reform the system to repair the cracked foundations of the Australian</p>
<p>   taxation system by bringing in a goods and services tax, getting</p>
<p>   rid of all those wholesale sales taxes and a whole lot of State</p>
<p>   taxes, you cannot have permanent tax relief. Mr Beazley is opting</p>
<p>   the easy...</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>Okay, but how can there be bad news when you say everybody's</p>
<p>   going to be a winner?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I'm not saying there's bad news for individuals, what</p>
<p>   I'm saying is there are hard bits in it because the hard bits</p>
<p>   are the change.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>Everybody's going to have more money in their pockets, which</p>
<p>   is what you're suggesting, why would anybody be unhappy with</p>
<p>   it or is that not true, are there going to be some...?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, it is, it is true.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>Everybody will have more money in their pocket.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Hang on, there is one qualification I've always made to that</p>
<p>   and that is the tax cheats will be worse off. I heard this morning,</p>
<p>   for example, in Mr Beazley's plan or promise on Thursday, there</p>
<p>   won't be anything in it for pensioners and self-funded retirees.</p>
<p>   And his explanation for that is that he's not going to introduce</p>
<p>   a GST so he doesn't have to give them anything extra. Well,</p>
<p>   I would say to those pensioners who are listening to this programme</p>
<p>   that not only are we compensating you in our plan for the full cost</p>
<p>   effect of the GST, but we are also adding a 1.5% real increase in</p>
<p>   your pension on top of the cost increase under the GST. Mr Beazley's</p>
<p>   unwilling to do that. Mr Beazley expects you to believe that he</p>
<p>   won't, after the next election, do what he did after the 1993</p>
<p>   election, promise you tax cuts, oppose the GST and when he wins,</p>
<p>   put up all the indirect taxes and not give you any compensation.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>Okay, so you're saying we can't trust that side...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I'm asking you to look at their record. I'm asking</p>
<p>   you to look at their...I mean, I'm not asking you on the</p>
<p>   basis of what he is now saying, but I'm asking you on the basis</p>
<p>   of what he did. He was the Deputy Prime Minister to Mr Keating that</p>
<p>   promised the L-A-W law tax cuts. He opposed a GST. He won the 1993</p>
<p>   election and as soon as he got in he took away the tax cuts, and</p>
<p>   to rub insult into injury, particularly to pensioners, he increased</p>
<p>   every indirect tax rate, every single one. He gave them no compensation.</p>
<p>   And one of the most respected tax academics in Australia, Neil Warren,</p>
<p>   said that was Labor's GST and what was worse he'd have</p>
<p>   no compensation.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>All right, what are we going to do about your side if you get in</p>
<p>   and then you break some of the promises Â we'd have to</p>
<p>   wait another three years to do something about it?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, we won't be. </p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>Promise...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Look, we won't be. Look at the...I mean, look, Howard,</p>
<p>   it stands for reason...</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>Yeah but Asia could turn down even further. I mean, the prices</p>
<p>   could get worse. You might have a lot less money than you predicted.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, that is all the more reason why people should support our</p>
<p>   plan. See, a government that comes along and says to you, look,</p>
<p>   you can have all of these goodies without making any change, you</p>
<p>   can have all the lolly without the vegetables, you can paint the</p>
<p>   house a nice new colour without doing anything about the cracking</p>
<p>   foundations Â I mean, what is wrong with the Beazley approach</p>
<p>   is that he does not accept that the system needs change. Everybody</p>
<p>   knows that the present system is falling over on its legs.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>Okay, Prime Minister.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>And we've got to change it for the better.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>I don't think you have to convince too many people of that,</p>
<p>   but when you announced the tax package...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I'm encouraged to hear that. I think I have, over the</p>
<p>   weeks and months ahead, to go all around Australia explaining that</p>
<p>   you can't have the good bits, you can't have the easy</p>
<p>   bits without doing some of the hard bits.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>Well, we're prepared for a bit of pain but we'd like</p>
<p>   to be a bit better off too.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Of course and you will be.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>Okay, but a few little cracks are starting appear because when</p>
<p>   you announced the tax package the Treasurer said education will</p>
<p>   be GST free. Now, that's not true, is it, what about computers,</p>
<p>   school stationery, uniforms, are they going to be GST free?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, the situation is that the...</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>They're part of education.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, well, hang on, no, look, the provision of education services</p>
<p>   are free of the GST and that has been defined in the package. But</p>
<p>   obviously if you have to buy uniforms, that's not part of that</p>
<p>   exclusion but, of course, bear in mind that the people who are buying</p>
<p>   those uniforms will be better off under the plan because of the</p>
<p>   personal income tax cuts. An average family will be between $40</p>
<p>   and $50 a week better off as a result of the tax plan. And don't</p>
<p>   assume that you are putting 10% on top of everything else. I mean,</p>
<p>   at the present time you've got all these hidden taxes. I mean,</p>
<p>   did you know that pet food was taxed at 22%, toothpaste, shampoo,</p>
<p>   soap and other powders, wheel barrows, lawn mowers, ladders, garden</p>
<p>   equipment, children's toys...</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>I've got the full list...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I mean, I think people should be aware of this. I mean, they're</p>
<p>   carrying on about Â I mean, at the present time Mr Beazley</p>
<p>   is defending a tax system that imposes a 22% tax, a 22% tax on children's</p>
<p>   toys.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>Wholesale tax, yeah.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes, a wholesale tax Â umbrellas, hand bags and luggage. And</p>
<p>   at 32% you've got clocks, watches, TV sets, video recorders.</p>
<p>   And at 12% you've got things like Cadbury's family blocks</p>
<p>   and Peters Natural Ice Cream. I mean, that is almost unbelievable.</p>
<p>   Now, okay, that has been there for 40 or 50 years and what we want</p>
<p>   to do is to sweep all of those higgledy-piggledy, uneven taxes away</p>
<p>   and replace them with a single rate tax of 10%. And that's</p>
<p>   why the price of many things will come down while the price of others</p>
<p>   will go up and the average price increase will be about 1.9%.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>Okay, what about charities, they are also supposed to be quarantined</p>
<p>   from the tax. Will the clothes they sell to the poor be free of</p>
<p>   GST?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, it's subject to two considerations. There's the</p>
<p>   total turnover and if it's below a certain level, well, it's</p>
<p>   not in the system. And also there's a test of whether it is</p>
<p>   in commercial competition. See, our view is that the straight charitable</p>
<p>   activity should be free of the GST, and that is the position, but</p>
<p>   where you have the situation that, for example...</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>St Vincent de Paul.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>...well, a church or an agency may be conducting something which</p>
<p>   is in straight out competition with somebody in small business,</p>
<p>   there is an argument, once it goes over a certain level of turnover,</p>
<p>   there is an argument that that should be within the system. And</p>
<p>   I think that is a defensible argument.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>Okay, so you haven't really made up your mind about that yet.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>We have made up our mind. I've just stated what the principle</p>
<p>   is. The straight charitable activities are completely free of GST</p>
<p>   but where there is a commercial component over a certain level then</p>
<p>   it's part of the system and why shouldn't it be?</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>So the St Vincent de Paul's shop would charge a GST.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, it depends on what arrangements they make and what the turnover</p>
<p>   of each outlet will be. If it's below a certain level, it's</p>
<p>   not caught. If it's above a certain level and it's in</p>
<p>   commercial competition then it would be.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>Is there any compelling reason to go back to Parliament next week?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, Parliament is scheduled to meet and that's all I'm</p>
<p>   saying.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>Tim Fischer has said there's really no business that necessitates</p>
<p>   going back there.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, Parliament is scheduled to meet and I'm not saying any</p>
<p>   more on that and there's really nothing to be gained by further</p>
<p>   questions on it.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>Okay, are you worried about the Government being exposed to further</p>
<p>   criticism in Parliament over the $10 million plus taxpayer funded</p>
<p>   commercial campaign on the tax package?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Absolutely not. We've been told by the law offices, we've</p>
<p>   been told by the Department of Finance and Treasury that it is completely</p>
<p>   in order.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>Why didn't you subject it to the Auditor-General before you</p>
<p>   actually put it on?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Because there was no need for us to do it because we got legal</p>
<p>   advice that it was completely in order.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>Didn't you say you would run it pass the Auditor-General in</p>
<p>   1995?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, no, no, what we did, Howard, was this. We got advice before</p>
<p>   we embarked on it from the law offices and from the Department of</p>
<p>   Treasury and the Department of Finance. I mean, we are being attacked</p>
<p>   by a Labor government who ran those Bill Hunter ads. Remember Bill</p>
<p>   Hunter?</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>Mmm.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I mean, on Working Nation. Those things were running right</p>
<p>   up until the calling of the last election and some of them actually</p>
<p>   ran after the election had been called, perhaps not those particular</p>
<p>   ads, but some others certainly did.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>Did you attack that at the time?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>We are completely satisfied that this is a perfectly legal operation.</p>
<p>   People are saying to us they want information, it's a new plan</p>
<p>   and they want information. The thing that appeals to people most</p>
<p>   about this plan is not so much how it affects them, they think it</p>
<p>   is good for the country.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>All right, the Prime Minister's here and he's agreed</p>
<p>   to talk with you. If you want to give him a call, 9221 1233. We</p>
<p>   will return momentarily.</p>
<p>[COMMERCIAL BREAK]</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>The Prime Minister's in town and he's with us here in</p>
<p>   the studio taking your calls Â 9221 1233. Neil, you're</p>
<p>   the first cab off the rank, good morning.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>By gee, that's about the first time this has happened, Howard,</p>
<p>   I must have been sleeping in all those other times I could have</p>
<p>   been on.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>Well, the Prime Minister's a good sleeper, we've just</p>
<p>   found that out this morning.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>Yeah, well, he's come back over to God's country over</p>
<p>   here, Howard, so I'd just like to pass on and say welcome back</p>
<p>   to the West, Prime Minister.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Thank you, I'm a regular visitor.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>Yeah. Prime Minister, I'm a voter who's been looking</p>
<p>   at what the benefits are of this tax package as to my family. You</p>
<p>   have explained in recent media releases about where the reduction</p>
<p>   or where the implementation of a tax benefit is to families. I just</p>
<p>   would like to ask you, as the Prime Minister, that Mr Beazley has</p>
<p>   said that he's proposing a $50 to $60 a week tax cut to low</p>
<p>   and middle income earners, could you explain to me where Mr Beazley</p>
<p>   proposes to get this money to continue on with the cuts?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I won't know the full extent of his promise until I</p>
<p>   hear it but let's assume it's roughly what's been</p>
<p>   in the papers. The answer is, I can't explain to you how it</p>
<p>   will be sustainable. The difference between Mr Beazley and myself</p>
<p>   on this issue is that we are honest enough to say to the public</p>
<p>   that you can't have tax benefits without tax reform. You can't</p>
<p>   insult the intelligence of the Australian people and say, we can</p>
<p>   give you all these goodies without fundamentally fixing the system.</p>
<p>   I mean, you've got to believe in fairies at the bottom of the</p>
<p>   garden to believe that with a system as ramshackle as Australia,</p>
<p>   just a personal tax bribe of $50 or $60 even is going to last, is</p>
<p>   going to be believable. I mean, we are offering personal tax cuts</p>
<p>   in the order of $40 to $50 for many average Australian families</p>
<p>   but it is built on the sure foundation of lasting tax reform. I</p>
<p>   mean, we're honest enough to fix the system. Mr Beazley knows</p>
<p>   the system is rotten, 80% of the Australian people know the system</p>
<p>   is rotten. We are prepared to fix the system as well as offer tax</p>
<p>   cuts. Mr Beazley is trying to kid you that you can have the tax</p>
<p>   cuts without fixing the system. He said that in '93 and he</p>
<p>   dishonoured the commitment when he got in. He increased every indirect</p>
<p>   tax he could lay his hands on, gave the pensioners no compensation</p>
<p>   and he's going to do it again.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>Ron, hello.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>Good morning.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>Good morning, the Prime Minister's listening, Ron.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>Oh, good morning, Howard, and good morning, Prime Minister.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Good morning.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, I'm on a superannuation pension and my tax</p>
<p>   rates are going to come down to a 17% rate. What I'd like to</p>
<p>   know is, I'm on the Commonwealth Assistance Scheme, will I</p>
<p>   eligible for that bonus for self-funded retirees?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh yes, oh yes.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>Oh great.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, there are actually about ten individual things that</p>
<p>   benefit self-funded retirees and pensioners. You've got the</p>
<p>   4% increase in the pension. You get a $250 increase in the tax rebate</p>
<p>   for aged people, if I can put it that way, of $350 for a couple.</p>
<p>   If you're on the pension, you get a 2.5% increase in the income</p>
<p>   test free area and if you are on a pension then there's a reduction</p>
<p>   in the taper rate from 50% to 40% - that's the rate in which</p>
<p>   your pension disappears as your private income rises. As you've</p>
<p>   already indicated, you get the personal tax cut. You get a $1000</p>
<p>   savings bonus for all people over the age of 60 and then you get</p>
<p>   an additional $2000 savings bonus for self-funded retirees of pensionable</p>
<p>   age if their income is either below $20,000 or phasing out between</p>
<p>   $20,000 and $30,000. If you happen to own any shares and you're</p>
<p>   getting dividends which are franked to the tune of 36 cents in the</p>
<p>   dollar, that's the company tax rate, and your tax rate currently</p>
<p>   is only 20 cents in the dollar, you can get, for the first time,</p>
<p>   a refund of that 16 cents from the tax man. If you've got private</p>
<p>   health insurance you get 30% of the cost of that back from the tax</p>
<p>   man, irrespective of your income, and for a lot of self-funded retirees,</p>
<p>   the abolition of provisional tax. The abolition of provisional tax</p>
<p>   is something people like.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>Hello, Andy.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>Yes, Howard, and Mr Premier.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>No, Mr Howard.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>The Prime Minister said that you get 30% on Medibank Private or</p>
<p>   MBF.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes or any private health insurance premium.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>That's the highest [inaudible] for a start.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Sorry?</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>I've been paying for the last 40 years.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes, so have I.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
