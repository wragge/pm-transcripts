PRIME MINISTER]<br />
FOR, MEDIA TUESDAY, 13 OCTOBER, 11981<br />
CONDOLENCE MOTION FOR THE HON. PATRICK JOHN KENNELLJY<br />
Mr. Speaker, I move: " that this House expresses its deep<br />
regret at the death on 12 October of the Hon. Patrick John Kennelly,<br />
a Senator from Victoria from 1953 to 1971 and Deputy Leader of.<br />
the Opposition in the Senate from 1956 to 1967, places on record<br />
its appreciation of his long and meritorious public service<br />
and tenders its profound sympathy to his widow and family in<br />
their bereavement".<br />
Pat Kennelly had a lifetime association with the Labor movement.<br />
Before entering Commonwealth Parliament, he served for fourt~ een<br />
years in the Victorian Legislative Council as Member for<br />
Melbourne West, eventually becoming leader of his Party in<br />
that Chamber.<br />
From 1945 to 1947 he was the Commissioner of Public Works and<br />
Minister in Charge of Electrical Undertakings in the Labor<br />
Government. In 1945 he became the Federal Secretary of the<br />
Australian Labor Party, a position he retained for eight years.<br />
In 1953 he was elected to-the Senate.<br />
During his 18 years as a* ehatr. he served on several<br />
Parliamentary Committees including the Committee of Disputed<br />
Returns and Qualificatioris, and the Joint Committee on<br />
Constitutional Review. He was also temporary Chairman of<br />
Committees from 1968.<br />
Senator Kennelly was Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the<br />
Senate from 1956 to 1967. Pat Kennelly served his nation, his<br />
State, the Senate, and the Labor movement with distinction.<br />
He was unstinting in his support for his Labor ideals and a<br />
vigorous defender of his Party's policies.<br />
When I entered Parliament in 195E1?,-Pat Kennell~ y had already<br />
won wide respect for his politica,. 1 skills. While Pat Kennel. ly<br />
served in the Senate and I in the House of Representatives, I<br />
remember him as embodying many of the qualities of the<br />
old-time Labor movement.<br />
He will be remembered as one of the most influential, dedicated<br />
and colouful figures in the history of the Labor Party.<br />
