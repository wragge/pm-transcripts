VISIT TO SOUTH EAST ASIA 1968<br />
DJAKARTA<br />
ARRIVAL STATEMENT MADE BY THE PRIME MINISTER,<br />
MR. JCHN GORTON 13 JUNE 1968<br />
I am happy to have this opportunity to visit the Republic of<br />
Indonesia on my first trip to South East Asia since becoming Prime Minister<br />
of Australia. My wife and I have been greatly looking forward to this visit<br />
and are grateful to the Government of Indonesia for its kind invitation.<br />
Although the association between our two countries is short<br />
when measured in terms of history, dating only from your independence<br />
Iit has been an association which has laid a foundation of friendship<br />
and co-operation. We in Australia, contiguous to Asia and part of the Asian<br />
and Pacific region, look to the forging of an enduring relationship with our<br />
closest South East Asian neighbour, We in Australia are deeply aware of<br />
the new world of independent nations in this region. It is in this region we<br />
feel that in friendly co-operation with our neighbours we can make our<br />
contribution to stability and progress.<br />
As a friend and neighbour, Australia has enjoyed fruitful<br />
relationships with Indonesia in fields of practical co-operation. Your Stutsr<br />
have attended our universities and technical institutions and Australians<br />
have worked alongside Indonesians on projects ranging from road building<br />
in East Nusa Tenggara to the installation of an aerial communicat ions network<br />
spanning the vast area of the Archipelago of the Republic. Our firm support<br />
of your present rehabilitation programme is assured.<br />
I am looking forward to discussions with your President and<br />
his Ministers on the many matters of mutual interest. It is my hope that<br />
our two Governments will expand their areas of co-operation in the future<br />
and that the range of personal and cultural contacts between our people will<br />
widen over the coming years.<br />
I hope also during this visit to see more of your country and<br />
people. My wife, who stayed in your country for a period of six weeks in<br />
1966, has insisted that I see something of the natural beauty of Indonesia<br />
and experience the warmth and hospitality of the Indonesian people. This<br />
we will do. After my period of official meetings and discussions here in<br />
Djakarta, we are also going to visit Bandung and Bali. </p>
