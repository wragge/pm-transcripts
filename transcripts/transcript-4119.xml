EMBARCOED: AG AI ' ISA DELIVERY<br />
FOR PRESS MAY 16,1976/<br />
ELECTORAL TALK<br />
Australia has aunique opportunity to again take its<br />
place as a country with one of the healthiest economies<br />
arnd highest living standards in the world.<br />
We have vast potential. We have unrivalled natural resources,<br />
a skilled workforce, stable democratic government, strong<br />
currency, and a broad manufacturing base.<br />
Against this we have severe inflation, which hits us hard<br />
at home and abroad.<br />
Japan, the United States of America, France, West Germanysome<br />
of our major trading partners all have beaten<br />
inflation. In some cases their inflation rates run at less<br />
than half of ours.<br />
Why do we still lag behind our trading partners in the control<br />
of inflation?<br />
There is not one single reason.. However, there is no doubt<br />
that excess wage demands are the main cause of inflation today.<br />
Wages make up the-vast majority of cost in any enterprise<br />
whether it be a corner milk bar, an insurance company,<br />
a car manufacturer or even a lcague football team.<br />
All Australians know that money wages have gone up dramatically<br />
ever-the past few years. / 2<br />

Australians generally have had more money to spend or to<br />
save.<br />
That money has not just materialised from a giant cash<br />
register. It has come from someories pocket.<br />
Normally, wage increases can be financed by growth and<br />
productivity. Recently, there has been no growth.<br />
So these increases have simply had to come from someone's<br />
hip pocket at the expense of jobs.<br />
Most Australians work for ani employer. They get their<br />
fortnightly pay packet from him. If his business is not<br />
growing, he has less money to pay for all the wage increases..<br />
Sooner or later there is not enough to go around and people<br />
loose their jobs.<br />
Some argue that prices have gone up too, and that the employer<br />
is able to maintain his profit level. The plain fact is that<br />
prices, have not gone up as much as wages.<br />
This means-that profits are down. In many cases profits have<br />
even turned to losses and companies have gone broke.<br />
What is the solution? First, the employer the man who<br />
takes risk with capital to make profit so he can employ more<br />
and better trained people must be given a fair go at<br />
recovering this profit.<br />
One way of doing this is to reign in his greatest costthat<br />
is, wages. / 3 </p>

The Government has strongly argued this principle before<br />
the Arbitration Commission.<br />
We want to index the minimum wage. This protects<br />
everyone from increases in the basic cost of living.<br />
It gives relief to cost pressures on employers and takes,<br />
the pressure off price rises. It hits directly at the/<br />
core of inflation. It gives us a real chance to beat<br />
inflation"'<br />
Excessive wage increases lead to higher costs which<br />
: leads to higher prices and then to continuing inflation. At the<br />
same time this leads to loss of profit and eventually<br />
to unemployment.<br />
So constantly increasing wages are a vital factor'in the<br />
inflation disease.<br />
That is why the Government has argued for a modification<br />
in wage indexation.<br />
The Government is concerned about justice to all wage earners.<br />
The Government is concerned about relations between<br />
employers and employees. We want to increase national<br />
productivity. We will fail if there is unrest in the workforce.<br />
We want industrial peace, and wage justice to workers.<br />
It is precisely for these reasons that we have sought<br />
to slow down the rate of wage increases.<br />
I feel sure that all wage earners would rather have a<br />
lower rate of inflation in 12 months time at the price of<br />
illusory money wage increases which do nothing more than<br />
perpetuate existing rates of inflation.<br />
At the same time, all those who have lost their jobs in~ recent<br />
years will have a much better chance of getting them back.<br />
And all those who may have lost their jobs in the next 12<br />
/ 14 </p>
<p>It<br />
4.<br />
months. will have a much better chance of keeping them.<br />
The Government is determined to reduce inflation. We are<br />
determined to keep our word to the electorate who gave us<br />
a massive mandate to beat inflation and unemployment. I/<br />
We have pursued a consistent strategy to carry out our mandate.<br />
Already, we have halted the massive growth of government that<br />
took place over the past three years. We have made savings<br />
: in administration and have cut out a great deal of waste.<br />
The task is an on-going one.<br />
The Government will do what it must, but it is also a task<br />
for the whole nation, for businessmen, employers, employees,<br />
trade unions and for everyone in this community. to recognise<br />
the national obligation, we all have-to get Australia moving<br />
again.<br />
We have given businessmen, manufacturers, farmers producers<br />
of the nation's real wealth the incentive to expand and<br />
start producing again.<br />
We have set the wheels turning for a soundly based, strong<br />
economic recovery. Already, there are encouraging signs<br />
that our policies are starting to take effect.<br />
We will not waiver or be distracted in our determination to<br />
' turn Australia's great potential into reality. </p>
