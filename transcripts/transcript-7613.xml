PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 24 MAY 1989<br />
Today, the Hon. Rabbie Namaliu, Prime Minister of Papua New<br />
Guinea and I signed a Treaty on Development Cooperation<br />
between our two countries. This Treaty sets out the<br />
arrangements relating to future development cooperation<br />
between Australia end Papua New Guinea. The Treaty has<br />
been framed in the context of the Joint Declaration of<br />
Principles which our two countries signed in December 1987,<br />
and which we agreed should guide the development of<br />
relations between us. Under the terms of the Treaty,<br />
Australia will provide Papua New Guinea with assistance<br />
totalling $ 1.5 billion over the next five years.<br />
In reaching agreement on our future aid program, Prime<br />
Minister Namaliu and I have agreed that as revenue from<br />
Papua New Guinea's mineral resource developments begins to<br />
increase in the mid-1990s it will be possible, and indeed<br />
desirable, for Australia eventually to phase out direct<br />
budget support. This is expected to occur by the year<br />
2005, and sooner if this can be achieved. Concomitantly,<br />
our annual project aid grants will increase modestly in<br />
accordance with Papua New Guinea's capacity to absorb such<br />
aid.<br />
While the total financial outlays will remain for some time<br />
the biggest single item in Australia's Aid Program ( 29 per<br />
cent in 1988/ 89), the amounts on which Prime Minister<br />
Namaliu and I have reached agreement represent a decline of<br />
16 per cent in real terms in the total level of aid to PNG<br />
over the next five years. For this period, budget support<br />
is expected to fall from 15 to 10 per cent of PNG'e total<br />
budget revenues, compared to 27 per cent in the early<br />
19809. The new aid levels should also be viewed in the context of<br />
Australia's favourable trade balance with PNG. In 1988,<br />
Australian exports to PNG, our closest neighbour, amounted<br />
to $ 776 million, compared with PNG exports to Australia of<br />
$ 100 million. In addition PNG, where over 15,000<br />
Australians live, ranks as a major destination for<br />
Australian investment overseas. The new Treaty opens the<br />
way for the introduction of more commelcially-related<br />
assistance from which the two countries would derive mutual<br />
benefit. rI0A7&amp;" k<br />
