The Commonwealth Government will contribute $100,000 to The Bradman Memorial Fund.</p>
<p>The Bradman Memorial Fund was announced earlier this week by Sir Donald Bradman's family and will be administered through the Bradman Foundation at Bowral.</p>
<p>As Mr John Bradman has indicated, all donations will be dedicated to the promotion and encouragement of cricket in disadvantaged communities including Indigenous communities.</p>
<p>The establishment of this fund for the purpose of giving people from disadvantaged backgrounds an opportunity to participate in playing cricket will be a fitting and practical memorial to the life of Sir Donald Bradman.</p>
