PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR PRESS 24 OCTOBER 1977<br />
ADDRESS AT BOOK LAUNCHING OF " AUSTRALIAN JEWS OF TODAY,<br />
AND THE PART THEY HAVE PLAYED"!, SYDNEY<br />
I am delighted to be here today to launch Rabbi Brasch's latest<br />
book, because it provides one of the best opportunities I have<br />
had to pay tribute to the contribution that Australian Jews<br />
and the Australian Jewish comununity have made to our country.<br />
In Rabbi Brasch's thirty four biographies, people excelling in<br />
almost every field of endeavour are represented, including<br />
the military, the arts, sports, commnerce and industry, medicine<br />
and the law. The biographies show clearly the richness, diversity<br />
and significance of the contribution that Australian Jews have<br />
made to Australian-society. They also give an insight into the<br />
diversity of the Jewish experience itself.<br />
The families of some of the people Rabbi Brasch writes about have<br />
lived in Australia for many generation others have come to<br />
Australia more recently. They have come from all parts of the<br />
world, sometimes fleeing from evil or oppressive regimes.<br />
Australia has offered them, as it has offered people from all<br />
nations, the freedom and opportunity to achieve and create,<br />
to rise to the top of their professions and occupations, freedom<br />
and opportunity to retain their. traditional and their religious<br />
and cultural identities. At a time when freedom and opportunity is<br />
still denied to so many people in so many things, when religious,<br />
racial and cultural oppressionr is still in existence, the<br />
freedom and opportunity Australia has to offer is important.<br />
The Australians about whom Rabbi Brasch writes have taken the<br />
opportunity Australia offers and by doing so they have enhanced<br />
all our lives. They have protected Australia as is shown by<br />
Major General Paul Cullens' outstanding career. The have made<br />
Australia laugh at a,, tLtewhen laughter was a very scarce and<br />
precious commodity. Roy Rene Mo is still looked upon as<br />
dpitoinising Australian humour. They have cured the sick and<br />
advanced medical research. They have enriched Australia's culture<br />
and strengthened our commerce and industry. They have gained<br />
Australia international reputation in sport. / 2 </p>
<p>1I F.. F. I am particularly glad that Lionel Van Praag was the sportsman<br />
Rabbi Brasch chose to include in his book. It is all too often<br />
that motorcyclists are overlooked and Lionel Van Praag was<br />
one of the world's greatest speed-way racers.<br />
Rabbi Brasch's book was well advanced before it was announced<br />
that Sir Zelman Cowen would be Australia's next Governor General,<br />
but the inclusion of his biography in this volume was inevitable.<br />
Rabbi Brasch well brings out Sir Zelman's outstanding personal and<br />
intellectual qualities. Sir Zelman a past Rhodes Scholar<br />
has had a remarkable career in academic life, administration and<br />
the law, and he has-been actively involved in the arts and<br />
community affairs. Amongst. the many books he has written, is<br />
a biography of the first Australian born and the first Jewish<br />
Governor General of Australia, Sir Isaac Isaccs.<br />
Sir Zelman will be an excellent successor in that office.<br />
The-Australian Jews the . Rabbi writes about have made an<br />
outstanding contribution to our country, as has the Jewish community<br />
as whole. The Jewish community has. been a major force in our<br />
society, establishing a network of institutions, synagogues, schoolswelfare<br />
organisations which have-been-of inestimable value to the<br />
quality of our nation's life, which has made Australia a better<br />
place in which to live.<br />
The Jewish community's commitment to preserving its cultural,<br />
linguistic and religious heritage, while participating in<br />
Australian society,-has-enhanced Australian pluralism.<br />
Rabbi Brasch who has-served the Temple Emanuel as its chief Minister<br />
for almost 30 years, has played a great part in the shaping<br />
Sof the Australian Jewish community. And I pay tribute to the<br />
work he has done for the benefit of his congregation, community<br />
and country. It is only fitting that he should have written this<br />
book on great Australian Jewish figures. He comments that many<br />
more people deserve to. be written about, and seems to promise<br />
us a sequeL.<br />
I very much hope. that this is a promise and it is my very great<br />
pleasure. t-launch"' Australian. Jews of Today, and the Part They<br />
Have Played".<br />
