PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING MP<br />
DOORSTOP, UNIVERSITY OF MELBOURNE, FRIDAY, 5 AUGUST 1994<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
J: Prime Minister, what are your comments on Mr Downer's statements<br />
on land rights over the past twenty four hours?<br />
PM: Well, despite all the comic fumbling, as entertaining as that has been,<br />
the harsh reality is that at the end of it, what does it mean for<br />
Aboriginal people? What he says he will do is that he will repeal a<br />
Commonwealth Native Title Act and replace it with some other act<br />
which is confected between himself and the States and in the case of<br />
the Northern Territory, that he will rewrite the Northern Territory Land<br />
Rights Act which must mean that the unfettered right of the veto which<br />
Aboriginal people now have would be taken away. That's what it<br />
means. So, people may be amused by the fumbling and the stumbling, but the<br />
hardness underneath it is he would repeal the Commonwealth's Native<br />
Title legislation and has not resiled from that. Will replace it with<br />
something that he puts together with the States while at the same time<br />
knocking around the unfettered veto that Aboriginal people enjoy<br />
under the NT Land Rights Act. That's the hard news of it. And, of<br />
course, when he was pressed about why he had made all these<br />
policies stumbles he then said ' I was pretty tired and pretty emotional<br />
and I made a slip'. Well, when you hear me say that you can write me<br />
off. Say ' that's the end of Keating. He said all these things, just write<br />
him out of the action.' I mean, I would be ashamed to say something<br />
like that. But, the thing about Mr Downer is he doesn't express any<br />
such sense of shame about not knowing his work, but in stumbling<br />
through it, keeping the thread of the hard message in tact. And, that<br />
is, in the end there will be less rights for Aboriginal people.<br />
J: Do you write him off now as Opposition Leader?<br />
PM: No, no, I don't write anyone off in this game. No, no. </p>
<p>J: But, can you understand that he might have been a little bit overcome<br />
being actually out there with the communities and going to a<br />
corroboree and things like that?<br />
PM: You either know your work and have your principles set or you don't.<br />
The fact is he went out there after having said on the week-end he<br />
would repeal the Native Title Act which provides a title to Aboriginal<br />
people who have a traditional association with the land. Now, there<br />
can be only one point in that. That is to deny them land. You see, the<br />
old Liberal refrain, they get out there talking about health and<br />
education and/ or not and/ or but, or land. And, the truth is it is<br />
health, education and land. They want to say it's health, education or<br />
land and that's where, I think, the callousness of Mr Downer's view<br />
emerges.<br />
J: Do you think he has learnt anything from the trip?<br />
PM: Well, I think, he has probably learned that you need to have a defined<br />
position about where you see the rights of indigenous Australians.<br />
How you see their role in society in this country, their role in the social<br />
compact that we have, the unwritten one we have. And, Mr Downer<br />
regresses back to those views held by the conservative rednecked<br />
part of his party.<br />
J: a complete lack of understanding?<br />
PM: Well, I don't think it's a lack of understanding. I think it is a callous<br />
disregard of their interests. I think he understands what it means. I<br />
mean, if you go and say to an Aboriginal person, ' you now enjoy a right<br />
under the Native Title Act which you may not in the future enjoy when<br />
we repeal it or you have a right of say over development on your land<br />
in the Northern Territory which we will take away.' I mean, he<br />
understands that.<br />
J: Mr Keating, have you actually visited the Aboriginal communities<br />
yourself?<br />
PM: I have visited Aboriginal communities over the years in various parts of<br />
coastal New South Wales and western New South Wales, but more<br />
than that I put my money where my heart is in the years I was<br />
Treasurer and Prime Minister. Last, of course, with the response to<br />
the Deaths in Custody Royal Commission where we made an<br />
enormous further contribution to funding for Aboriginal people. Now,<br />
that's what it is about. I mean, it is about knowing where your values<br />
are and where your principles are and putting them into effect.<br />
J: Prime Minister, Justice French's remarks suggest a prima-facie case<br />
that the Mabo law, the Native Title Act is somewhat flawed. </p>
<p>3<br />
PM: No, look, if you look through the property law of Australia get the<br />
property law of Victoria out or of New South Wales it will be a<br />
massive set of volumes. Writing a large piece of property and cultural<br />
law from a clean sheet of paper, which is what we did with Mabo, was<br />
an enormous undertaking. Like any major piece of law it will change<br />
over time and need to be fine tuned, but the principles won't change<br />
and the Government won't entertain changing the principles. So, for<br />
those who are working in the system, working with it, we'll listen to<br />
what they have to say, but I'm sure nobody working in it will want to<br />
change its principles. And, were anyone working in it recommend to<br />
the Government that it's principles should be changed well, of course,<br />
the Government would resist such a change. Thank you.<br />
