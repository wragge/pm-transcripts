E OE PROOF COPY<br />
PH: I' 1 just say a few words about this tor you. I<br />
tti what we've just seen here, you followed me<br />
axo d this TAFS college, is the value of vocational<br />
eau tion. That is, teaching basic skills to people<br />
a t er in securing employment or in the traineaeships<br />
wich you saw, people who have employment but who<br />
ae getting further training to be of more value to<br />
a mployer and as well as that those who are just<br />
d i trade certificate courses as well. So we've<br />
6( sort of the three streams those who are<br />
g9t ing basic support, that is learning basic<br />
sli Is, those who are adding to skills for work<br />
t e recurrently doing and those who are getting<br />
t a e training certificates and of course there are<br />
1 v -in facilities here as well. The capital for<br />
t i building behind me is supplied by the<br />
aonwealth. The capital for the new building<br />
t a es school will be supplied by the Commonwealth,<br />
te machines you saw in the printing office, the<br />
p 1 ting graphics division was supplied by the<br />
C onwealth. fo vocational education is important<br />
ad that's why we've now developed a National<br />
T aning Authority so that we can grow this system<br />
add grow it in a way which has consistency of<br />
qa ity and application across the country and<br />
t a ' s why it was such a vast reform.<br />
J: One of the significant visits I thought during that<br />
to u was an inapection of Aboriginal designed<br />
A s ralian flags with the Olympic Games. Do you </p>
<p>4. Pug. 92 18: 23 No. 03t P. 02/..<br />
2<br />
t ink this will be the last Olympic's when we'll se<br />
the resent flag!<br />
PMH: I I't know, but we'll wish the graphic artists<br />
we11, I'm sure we'll see many more designs.<br />
J: T is some concern that Tasmania Is not going to<br />
g n adequate share of the funding under your<br />
Y t Package or under ' One Nation'.<br />
PM: T nia will always get Its share. Z made the<br />
in earlier today that fiscal equalisation Is<br />
e red; that the out-lying regions from the larger<br />
st ais of NSW and Victoria have been given funding<br />
tc give their communities levels of services they<br />
migh not themselves otherwise afford. When I was<br />
Te aurer I supported equalisation for eight years,<br />
I t ll1 support It and similarly I support a fair<br />
st rlng of any Commonwealth program.<br />
J: Mi Kating, can you give any guarantees that the<br />
Mq I are levy won't be increased before the next<br />
e cion?<br />
PM: I' ot here to discuss budget changes at curb-side<br />
dc tops.<br />
3: Tc row you are going to Burnie, the Company<br />
y at rday held a press conference and blamed the<br />
r uctions in tariffs as one of the reasons they'll<br />
hve to cut jobs.<br />
PM: I don't think there is any basis for that. If the<br />
Copl y rRm s to b4t moe provctive thst's flt", If<br />
te have an investment program, apparently another<br />
$ 2 0-30 million I'm told, the Company is itself today<br />
a r ncing a new project in NSW indeed, not in<br />
T a nia but still expanding the business. But<br />
here, if they want to make the business more<br />
piductive and competitive and they believe they<br />
mist do that by greater output for fewer people<br />
piov ded that the transition is handled with the<br />
Wri s, with the staff, either by natural attrition<br />
o suitable redundancy arrangements well that's<br />
hew t should be. They should discuss these things<br />
wit the unions and with the workforce.<br />
J: Bit Is It reasonable for them to walk out of<br />
ne otiations on productivity with unions which Is,<br />
well they haven't walked out, but in the midst of<br />
ne otiations to then announce 400 jobs are going?<br />
PM: I'B ot in a position to be familiar with the<br />
clrn t state of their negotiations or arrangements.<br />
T I sCompany did not have a tip top reputation for<br />
Ird trial relations and I just hope it can improve<br />
i self. TEL: </p>

PM: I dol<br />

3: Mr K<br />
Gove the in 3<br />
a ing, do you think the Victorian Government is<br />
M ng the intent of the law by allowing those or<br />
Sucing those New Zealand commercials?<br />
i' know, I mean a law is a law and no doubt If<br />
ie flouts it someone else will blow the whistle.<br />
la ing with resource security, what's your<br />
: nent doing about resource security, I mean if<br />
o lition did vote it down in the Senate you are<br />
rnment, what Is your Government doing about<br />
it ih the mean time?<br />
PM: What very legi<br />
Nat I<br />
J: Will<br />
PM@ And putt POO6 a you asking me? We put up a Bill which is a<br />
i ternally consistent, competent piece of<br />
i1 tion which we couldn't get the Liberal and<br />
rn Il Parties to agree with.<br />
y u revive it before the next election?<br />
it this stage we don't have any intention of<br />
Lnr it back because the Senate has made its<br />
: 1 n clear.<br />
Mr Meeting, Mr Hewson has called for you to back an<br />
apo2oy to New Zealand, are you going to do that?<br />
PM: LooK<br />
evelz Mr Hewson makes strident calls on the hour<br />
hour, you could just ignore most of them.<br />
J: Do gol endorse though the sentiments of those ads?<br />
PM; I hive<br />

PM: No, not pro,<br />
J: Can Sup sus n't seen them. If there is any matter in<br />
t here it is between the Victorian Government<br />
yone who takes exception to the ads.<br />
of projects perhaps it could be said are<br />
in mining and as well as for-e y are riding<br />
ource security.<br />
mining. The mining industry is a bit smarter<br />
he forestry inductries I think in this<br />
t. They don't want the Federal Department of<br />
niment lamouring all over them and they have<br />
called for resource security in these<br />
ts. Medicare levy you said that you wouldn't<br />
s Budget changes out in the street, does that<br />
t is a Budget change?<br />
I was asked about Budget changes and I said<br />
prepared to discuss Budget changes or any<br />
pective likely, rumoured, written about. I'm<br />
Ijust ask you then about the meeting you're<br />
0o ed to be having as part of the ecologically<br />

the t! n to pull out of that meeting because they<br />
sa t atrhe commendations that have gone off the<br />
ra 1 because of Intervention by State and Federal<br />
bu e ucrats. Are you concerned that they may think<br />
so<br />
PM: I oj' 41t think so, the ACF's a grown up organIstion<br />
t t knows what the tooing and froing is In any of<br />
th 8 sorts of things and they found themselves able<br />
to d al with the bureaucracy and the political<br />
pa t es quiite effectively over the lost couple of<br />
yr<br />
J: Yeit rday APPM for some reason mentioned freight<br />
eq 6 isatio-nof that as a threat to their business<br />
as tO whether it would continue or not. Have they<br />
got ny worries about that?<br />
PM: I Po~' t think you ' could ever do a Tasmanian press<br />
c farenco or a doorstop and I haven't done one<br />
WIlth~ utusomeone asking we about freight equalisatlon,,<br />
S ~ could just give you the sort of prize for the<br />
d* nd say no we're not thinicing about freight<br />
e sT on<br />
J: M i0* ating, what went through your mind when you saw<br />
ti ian with the chain saw this morning7<br />
PM: St 0' Id something have gone through my mind? No, he<br />
wcs~ ouncing around and someone told me there wera.<br />
nc Ilades In it, Is that right? I don't know.<br />
J: TMe burning question Is when will you bowl against<br />
Adziw Denton?<br />
PM: Ililke to play my own weight, I don't want to do any<br />
thilg with Andrew.<br />
3: Tal)~ ing about games, what do you think of our<br />
pr ormance with the 23 medals now at theLOlIip~ ca.<br />
How do you feel?<br />
PM: I tt~ ink it is a great tribute to Australian sport,<br />
t; Oports men and women, to dedication, to endurance<br />
ad'also I think Commonwealth funding hae helpe.<br />
W4 pent $ 11 mifllion on-the preparation of the team<br />
I vosted this year in something which I think has<br />
rtainly helped the Australian Olympic Team prepare<br />
Is~ 1f and It's a tribute to them all that they<br />
cm do so well In the face of the worlds best<br />
3: Th State Government I* planning changes to the<br />
ind~ strial relations act here which the opposition<br />
a yo is similar to those plans that Dr . Howson has<br />
f r Australia generally </p>
<p>TEL: 4. Aug. 92 18: 23 No .030 P. 05/ 0.<br />
PM: 1' Vrry, 1ve missed the first part of your<br />
J! T first part of the question woe that the State<br />
GO etmment Is planning changes to the industrial<br />
To ations act which &amp; llowscontracts witho~ tuEn.<br />
-n olveme-n Do you think that is the right way to<br />
go fr Australia?<br />
PM: I oft't know that they're planning that. I don't<br />
th nk, look we have come so far through a proceSs of<br />
Co SUltation and consensus in Australia In economic<br />
ity change and in Industrial relations. The<br />
p of the pudding was In the eating, I think in<br />
t 980s we had decelerating inflation even though<br />
W had high economic growth and we've now got<br />
tent Inflation which shows that the wage claims<br />
h a, been entirely moderate. I think average weekly<br />
Ing$ for the year was around three per cent so<br />
tIdea that this sort of straw man proposition<br />
t t'thers's something wrong with unions and pay<br />
r es when In fact we're looking at an inflation<br />
r e of 1.5 per cent and we've got a wage share In<br />
t ' economy at around 1960s levels, what are they<br />
t king about? To inject such rancour as we saw<br />
a mouth or so ago at Burnie and to the Industrial<br />
r lapiens system of Australia will do nobody any<br />
g The thing GOvernments have to do is talk to<br />
ple anid people who want to be In Government but<br />
n t take the responsibilities of Government of<br />
d c~. ssing complex Issues with interest groups<br />
Uld not bother, leave it to the rest of us who do<br />
w t to talk to them to run the place. And if they<br />
d ' t want to talk to people and engage unions or<br />
plioyees about matters of industrial relations or<br />
w geis or conditions, It they think they can simply<br />
d it by trying to throw people out under common law<br />
c ntracts and take benefits away that have taken a<br />
c nt~ ory to put together well You'll have Industrial<br />
d $ harmony and we can do Without that.<br />
J: it t~ is a message you are going to be taking to App1I<br />
t m~ row?<br />
PM: Wi11 it's a message I made last night, it's a<br />
sgeI'd give any where. The thing Is this sort<br />
a strident -It's a very funny thing about Dr<br />
If Wson and people like him, they want to run the<br />
vernment but they don't want the Government doing<br />
Ythiing. They want to be in Government but don'It<br />
at Wi but they don't want the thing to do anything.<br />
Tt ey want to step back and let the sort of meyham of<br />
t1 a market take place where the worst excesses and<br />
iras tincts of People will have free reign. </p>
<p>TEL: 4. Aug. 92 18: 23 No. 030 P. 06/ C<br />
V<br />
J: Are ypu going to have any specific advice to APPM<br />
co lidering its industrial relations problems?<br />
PM; No.<br />
3: Mr Ketilng, how do you rate Joan Kirner's chances at<br />
the pblls?<br />
PM: Well, how do you? I don't know, I will wait and<br />
see. It's not far away the election) one way or the<br />
otler, October is not that far off.<br />
3: 1 hink what he was asking was why have you chosen<br />
to gJ to Burnlie tomorrow to speak to APPM workers?<br />
PM We 1 I'm down here and I think that I have every<br />
re son to visit Burnie as any other place and the<br />
di pdte is now over, the place is now starting to<br />
ti iover again and I thought that was a reasonable<br />
th n4 to do.<br />
J: ndustrial relations system a major difference<br />
be wden yourself and the Liberals?<br />
PM: Ab olutely, look Dr Hewson's got one policy with two<br />
pr ngs, he wants to lift prices and cut wages. Lift<br />
pr ces with the consumption tax by 15 per cent and<br />
cu wages. That's his policy, he thinks that will<br />
ch ge Australia. The fact is that the wage share<br />
in Avstralla is not high. The profit share has been<br />
ve -yhigh and will be high again as soon as some<br />
vo uRe coMes back in the market. There is no need<br />
to g6 slashing wages, we will not improve<br />
Au tralle's prospects by ripping away at people's<br />
wa t or trying to give them a peasant wage economy.<br />
Th s is not a sensible thing to do.<br />
J: Is New Zeland doing better than us<br />
PM: W ell its immaterial whether they're doing better<br />
than us. The fact of the matter is we had in the<br />
19O a lot of growth in this country and a lot of<br />
eloyment, many countries didn't and we've got to<br />
g back to that growth and back to that employment<br />
a the way toA it will be always with a consensus,<br />
getting the business community end the unions<br />
t gether and not this silly sort of sterile view<br />
t at you can stand back and let people just have<br />
teix wages cut, award conditions thrown away and in<br />
t at sort of injustice people will accept it and<br />
t en do sensible things in the economy, they won't.<br />
J: Gtting back to your visit to Burnie tomorrow, you<br />
a e going under fairly unusual circumstances in that<br />
B rnie has been in the lime light, your visit is<br />
g ig to be seen as quite significant. Why are you<br />
g9 ing there?<br />
PM: I'd I k to think whenever I visit anywhere it's<br />
significant, and if I didn't think that you wouldn't<br />
be h rel would you.<br />
