FOR PRESS: PM No. 86/ 1972<br />
AUSTRALIAN INVESTMENT OVERSEAS<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, the Rt.<br />
Hon. William lcMahon, CH, MP<br />
The Prime Minister, Mr. McMahon, said today that the<br />
Government is undertaking an extensive review of its policy on the<br />
promotion of direct Australian investment in neighbouring countries.<br />
Mr. McNallon said that during his recent visit to Malaysia,<br />
Singapore and Indonesia, he had discussed with the Heads of States<br />
of those countries ways of furthering cemmercial relations between<br />
them and Australia. It was clear from these discussions that<br />
these countries would like to receive more joint investments by<br />
Australian firms. Mr. rYcMahon had assured those countries of his<br />
own desire to see increased Australian investments in the region.<br />
Mr. McMahon said that the Australian Government fully<br />
recognised the mutual benefits accruing from direct Australian<br />
investment in these countries. Such investments, involving the use<br />
of Australian technical know-how and managerial skills, were an<br />
important means by which Australia can contribute to the<br />
development and growth of other countries, particularly those in its<br />
neighbouring regions. Moreover, such investments were an important<br />
way of promoting Australia's own commercial and other interests.<br />
Mr. McMahon added that, under existing policy, exchange<br />
control approval is readily given for direct investments overseas<br />
which involve-a significant measure of Australian managerial<br />
participation in the overseas enterprise and the export of<br />
managerial and technical skills. Approval is also readily given for<br />
all types of investment which promote Australian exports or protect<br />
existing Australian investments abroad.<br />
Against this background, Mr. McMahon had requested the<br />
Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade and Industry, Mr.<br />
Anthony, and the Treasurer, Mr. Snedden to put in hand an<br />
examination of possible measures which the Australian Government<br />
might take to facilitate increased direct investment overseas by<br />
Australian residents in neighbouring countries. </p>
<p>Mr. McMahon said that the examination would include the roles that<br />
double-tax agreements and bilateral investment guarantee agreements<br />
could play in facilitating worthwhile Australian investment overseas.<br />
In conj unction with this examination, an official<br />
Australian investment survey mission, comprising members of the<br />
Export Development Council, representatives of Australian banks,<br />
and senior officials of the Departments of Trade and Industry and<br />
Treasury, will visit Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia in the near<br />
future. Mr. McMahon said that the main purpose of the Mission will<br />
be to discuss with relevant investment authorities in Malaysia,<br />
Singapore and Indonesia the possibility of greater direct investment<br />
by Australians in local enterprises, particularly those in<br />
preferred areas of activity. In addition, the Mission will<br />
investigate the desirability of establishing Australian Business<br />
Co-operation Committees with Malaysia and Singapore along the lines<br />
of the recently-formed Australia/ Indonesia Business Co-operation<br />
Committee. The establishment of such committees could assist in a<br />
very practical way to promote better commercial relations within<br />
the region. Mr. McMahon said that the Mission will report to the<br />
Government on its return to Australia and will also conduct<br />
seminars and arrange by other suitable means to inform senior<br />
Australian businessmen of the investment opportunities available<br />
in the countries visited.<br />
