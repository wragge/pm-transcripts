PREMIERS' CONFERENCE<br />
/ 4x~ n Oeni' g Statement by the Prime Minister 14 FEBRUARY 1972<br />
IT IS OPPORTUNE THAT WE SHOULD MEET HERE TODAY FOR A<br />
WIDE-RANGING DISCUSSION ABOUT THE AUSTRALIAN ECONOMY AND YOUR STATE<br />
FINANCES. THE TIMING HAS NOT COME ABOUT BY CHANCE. WHEN THE<br />
COMMIONWEALTH ACTED-IN A NUMBER OF WAYS LAST NOVEMBER TO ASSIST DEMAND<br />
AND MAINTAIN GROWTH IN THE ECONOMY, WE HAD IN MIND THAT IT WOULD BE<br />
APPROPRIATE TO REVIEW THE POSITION AGAIN ABOUT THIS TIME TO STAND<br />
OFF FOR A LITTLE AND THEN HAVE ANOTHER LOOK AT THE TRENDS.<br />
THE DATE WHICH WE THEN SUGGESTED WAS CHOSEN WITH THAT<br />
CONSIDERATION VERY MUCH IN MIND. THE APPROPRIATE TIMING OF THESE<br />
DISCUSSIONS THUS RESULTS RATHER FROM POSITIVE FORETHOUGHT, CONSISTENT<br />
WITH THE ASSURANCES OF THE TREASURER AND MYSELF TO KEEP THE ECONOMY<br />
UNDER REVIEW, AND AS PART OF THAT PROCESS.<br />
WITH THIS TIMETABLE IN MIND, WE IN THE COMMONWEALTH<br />
UNDERTOOK LAST WEEK A COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW OF THE ECONOMY.<br />
AS A CONSEQUENCE OF THAT REVIEW WE HAVE COME TO CERTAIN<br />
BROAD CONCLUSIONS. BEFORE FINALLY MAKING OUR DECISIONS OR SOME<br />
OF THEM WE WANT TO HAVE THE BENEFIT OF YOUR VIEWS IN PREMIERS'<br />
CONFERENCE. WE SHALL, NO DOUBT, FIND OURSELVES IN BROAD AGREEMENT<br />
WITH SOME OF THE VIEWS THAT SOME OF YOU WILL PUT TO US AND IN<br />
DISAGREEMENT WITH OTHERS. THAT IS IN THE NATURE OF CONFERENCES<br />
AND NONE OF US SHOULD FIND IT IN ANY WAY SURPRISING. .0 ./ 2 </p>
<p>-2<br />
OVER THE PAST FEW MCNTHS THE GOVERNMENT HAS MADE<br />
SEVERAL CONSIDERED ADJUSTMENTS TO POLICY TO MAINTAIN AS FAR AS<br />
POSSIBLE OUR OBJECTIVES: THE MAINTENANCE OF ECONOMIC GROWTH WHICH<br />
IS ESSENTIAL AMONG OTHER THINGS TO OUR PURPOSE OF MAINTAINING A<br />
HIGH LEVEL OF EMPLOYMENT; AND THE CONTROL OF INFLATION,<br />
IN THE LIGHT OF OUR DELIBERATIONS I WILL ANNOUNCE SOME<br />
FURTHER ADJUSTMENTS WITHIN THIS BROAD POLICY FRAMEWORK.<br />
I WANT, AS AN INTRODUCTION,, TO SAY SOMETHING ABOUT THE<br />
CURRENT AND PROSPECTIVE ECONOMIC SITUATION AS WE SEE ITol<br />
WE HAVE BEEN DISTURBED BY WHAT WE BELIEVE TO BE THE<br />
EXCESSIVELY GLOOMY VIEWS BEING PUT ABOUT RECENTLY REGARDING<br />
CURRENT AND PROSPECTIVE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS0 ACCORDINGLY9 WE HAVE<br />
GIVEN THOSE VIEWS THE MOST CLOSE AND CAREFUL EXAMINATION. WE HAVE<br />
COME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THESE EXTREME VIEWS ARE SIMPLY NOT<br />
SUPPORTED BY THE FACTS. I SAY THAT BECAUSE WE MUST GUARD AGAINST<br />
BEING OVER-INFLUENCED BY SUCH VIEWS.<br />
REASONED CRITICISM IS ALWAYS WELCOME,-AND IT IS<br />
IMPORTANT THAT WE SHOULD BE AWARE OF AND UNDERSTAND SUCH<br />
CRITICISMS. BUT THE MORE OMINOUS OF THESE STATEMENTS CAN HAVE;<br />
IN SOME DEGRIE., A SELF-FULFILLING CHARACTER IF THE COMMUNITY<br />
TAKES THEM SERIOUSLYA<br />
PUBLIC CONFIDENCE CAN BE VERY SENSITIVE, FOR THAT<br />
REASON. IT IS I THINK THE DUTY OF ALL OF US TO EXAMINE THOSE<br />
AREAS OF THE ECONOMY WHICH COME WITHIN OUR RESPECTIVE<br />
JURISDICTION AND TO ASK OURSELVES ARE THINGS REALLY AS BAD<br />
AS SOME ARE CLAIMING THEM TO BE? 0 0 0 0Å“. </p>
<p>-3<br />
WE THINK THAT THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION IS CLEARLY IN<br />
THE NEGATIVE. THAT BEING SO, THOSE WHO SO SHRILLY VOICE THlE OPPOSITE<br />
OPINION BEAR A HEAVY RESPONSIBILITY TO THEIR FELLO CITIZElNS.<br />
THE ECONOMY HAS BEEN GROWING STEADILY. THE GOVERNMENT<br />
IS RESOLVED TO SEE GROWTH CONTINUE. WE HAVE NOT THE SLIGHTEST<br />
INTENTION OF COUNTENANCING ANY OTHER OUTCOME. IT IS A TRAVESTY OF<br />
OUR VIEWS TO SUGGEST OTHERWISE.<br />
THERE ARE, IN FACT, CLEAR ELEMENTS OF STRENGTH IN THE<br />
ECONOMY WHICH WOULD, EVEN IF NO FURTHER ACTION WERE TAKEN NOW,<br />
ENSURE CONTINUED GROWTH IN THE MONTHS AHEAD.<br />
IT FOLLOWS THAT ANY MEASURES NOW TO BE TAKEN AN]) I<br />
HAVE ALREADY SAID THAT WE PROPOSE SOME WILL BE DESIGNED TO<br />
STIMULATE THAT GROWTH.<br />
CERTAINLY THE ECONOMY IS NO LONGER IN THE STRAINED<br />
CONDITION OF A YEAR OR MORE AGO. LT WAS, IN'DEED, A BASIC AIM OF<br />
OUR ECONOMIC POLICY THEN TO MODERATE THAT CONDITION. IF WE WERE<br />
TO AVERT THE THREAT OFA SELF-PERPETUATING WAGE-PRICE SPIRAL, THAT<br />
WAS A NECESSARY PRE-CONDITION AND~ OF COURSE IT REMAINS SO. FOR IT<br />
REMAINS TRUE THAT THE MOST DIFFICULT TASK, AND ONE WHICH IS STILL<br />
BEFORE US, IS TO QUELL INFLATION.<br />
BUT THAT IS NOT TO SAY THAT WE CAN TURN AWAY FROM OUR<br />
OTHER HIGH OBJECTIVE, NAMELY, TO MAINTAIN THE MOMENTUM OF ECONOMIC<br />
GROWTH, WITH ALL THAT MEANS FOR EMPLOYMENT. o/ 4 </p>
<p>-4<br />
HERE ALSO WE HAVE PROBLEMS, INCLUDhING THE RURAL RECESSION<br />
AND RESULTING RURAL UNEMPLOYMENT, WHICH WE HAVE ALREADY TAKEN STEPS<br />
TO MEET AND WHICH WE SHALL DO MORE ABOUT IN ACCORDANCE WITH DECISIONS<br />
WHICH I WILL MENTION LATER.<br />
THESE FURTHER STEPS ARE IN LINE WITH THE FLEXIBLE APPROACH<br />
THE GOVERNMENT HAD ADOPTED IN DEALING WITH PARTICULAR TRENDJS AS<br />
THEY EMERGE. THEY REPRESENT A FURTHER MEASURED RESPONSE DESIGNED<br />
TO MEET PARTICULAR PROBLEMS, WHILST MAINTAINING OUR COUNTERINFLATI<br />
ONARY STANCE.<br />
HERE I PAUSE TO LOOK MORE CLOSELY AT THE PROBLEM OF COST<br />
AND PRICE ESCALATION. ONE DOES NOT HAVE TO SEARCH FAR TO FIND THE MAJOR FACTOR<br />
PUSHING COSTS AND PRICES ALONG AT THE PRESENT UNACCEPTABLE AND INDEED<br />
DANGEROUS RATE. IT MUST SURELY NOW BE CLEAR TO EVERYONE THAT THE<br />
VERY RAPID INCREASE IN WAGE AND SALARY COSTS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT<br />
FORCE WHICH HAS CHARACTERISED RECENT PERIODS OF~ COST AND PRICE INCREASES.<br />
WE ARE, OF COURSE, AWARE THAT THERE ARE OTHER FACTORS; BUT WE SHOULD<br />
NOT ALLOW THEIR EXISTENCE TO DIVERT OUR ATTENTION FROM WHAT IS CLEARLY<br />
FAR AND AWAY THE MOST IMPORTANT CAUSE.<br />
IN THIS FIELD, THE COMMONYEALTH HAS VIGOROUSLY PUT TO THE<br />
ARBITRATION COMMISSION ITS VIEW THAT EXCESSIVE WAGE INCREASES IN THES<br />
CURRENT CIRCUMSTANCES ARE VERY MUCH AGAINST THE COMMUNITY'S BEST<br />
INTEREST. IN SOME DECISIONS TOWARDS THE END OF 1971 IT APPEARED THAT<br />
THE COMMISSION HAD TAKEN COGNIZANCE OF THE EFFECTS OF ITS DETERMINATIONS<br />
ON THE ECONOMY IN GENERAL. THERE HAS ALSO BEEN SOME WELCOME REDUCTION<br />
IN THE RATE OF INCREASE IN OVER-AWARD PAYMENTS. </p>
<p>5<br />
NOTWITHSTANDING THESE MODERATELY HOPEFUL SIGNS.. THERE<br />
ARE STILL EXTREMELY SERIOUS UPWARD PRESSURES ON THE WAGES FRONT<br />
PARTICULARLY ON AWARD. WAGES, I WILL HAVE MORE TO SAY ABOUT THIS<br />
MATTER LATER115 REDUCING THE IMPACT OF INFLATION IS~, AS I SAID, ONLY<br />
PART OF OUR TOTAL OBJECTIVE,.<br />
IN RELATION TO OUR GROWTH OBJECTIVE-THERE ARE SOME<br />
FLAT ELEMENTS IN THE ECONOMY. THERE IS THE DEPRESSED SITUATION<br />
IN SOME OF OUR RURAL INDUSTRIES AND THERE IS THE SUBDUED GROWTH<br />
OF CONSUMER EXPENDITURE,-THERE IS ALSO EVIDENCE TO SUGGEST SOME<br />
PROSPECTIVE LEVELLING OFF IN CERTAIN AREAS OF PRIVATE INVESTMENT<br />
EXPENDITURE,. FOR EXAMPLE, IN THE FIELD OF NON-DWELLING CONSTRUCTION!<br />
AS THE ECONOMY HAS COME OFF THE BOIL THERE HAS TOO,.<br />
BEEN A RISE IN UNEMPLOYMENT -A RISE WHICH SHOULD NOT BE JUDGED,~<br />
HOWEVER BY COMPARISON WITH THE VERY LOW LEVEL OF UNEMPLOYMENT<br />
WHICH HAD BEEN REACHED IN 1970.<br />
A GOOD DEAL HAS BEEN SAID IN RECENT MONTHS ABOUT THIS<br />
LATTER ASPECT OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS AND I THINK IT IMPORTANT<br />
THEREFORE THAT I SHOULD SAY SOMETHING ABOUT IT.<br />
IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THE CURRENT ( END-JANUARY)<br />
LEVEL OF UNEMPLOYMENT, AT 1. 62 PER CENT OF THE WORK-FORCE IN<br />
SEASONALLY-ADJUSTED TERMS, IS LITTLE DIFFERENT FROM THE LONG -TERM<br />
AVERAGE OF 1.4 PER CENT EXPERIENCED IN THIS COUYNTRY; AN]) THAT<br />
LONG-TERM AVERAGE IS REMARKABLY LOW COMPARED WITH THE EXPERIENCE<br />
OF MOST ADVANCED WESTERN NATIONS, </p>
<p>-6<br />
CERTAINLY, THE UNEMPLOYMENT SITUATION IS MUCH CLOSER TO THE<br />
LONG-TERM NORM THAN IS THE CASE WITH PRICES, WHERE THE CURRENT RATE<br />
OF PRICE INCREASE ABOVE 7 PER CENT PER YEAR CONTRASTS WITH OUR<br />
EXPERIENCE THROUGH THE 1960' s OF SOME 2--3 PER CENT PER YEAR.<br />
SECONDLY, I POINT OUT THAT THE TREND OF UNEMPLOYMENT HAS<br />
VIRTUALLY FLATTENED OUT IN RECENT MONTHS. IN SEASONALLY-ADJUSTED<br />
TERMS, IT HAS-INCHED UPWARDS DURING THE PAST FEW MONTHS FROM ITS<br />
LEVEL OF 1 .53 PER CENT AT END-SEPTEMBER TO 1 .62 PER CENT AT ENDJANUARY<br />
THAT IS, A RISE OF LESS THAN 0.1 PER CENT OVER FOUR MONTHS.<br />
ANY BALANCED APPRAISAL OF OUR PRESENT ECONOMIC CONDITION<br />
AND PROSPECTS MUST HAVE REGARD TO THESE POINTS. WHAT I WANT TO<br />
STRESS IS THAT IT IS WHOLLY CONSISTENT WITH OUR OBJECTIVE OF<br />
MAINTAINING STEADY GROWTH IN THE ECONOMY THAT WE SHOULD MAINTAIN A<br />
HIGH LEVEL OF EMPLOYMENT.<br />
IT WAS, INDEED, WITH THAT IN MIND THAT THE GOVERNMENT<br />
LAST NOVEMBER AND DECEMBER TOOK A NUMBER OF STEPS STEPS WHICH<br />
I SHALL NOT DETAIL AT THIS POINT BUT WHICH, AS YOU KNOW, INCLUDhED THE<br />
ARRANGEMENT FOR-GRANTS TO THE STATES FOR THE RELIEF OF UNEMPLOYMENT<br />
AS WELL AS A NUMBER OF OTHER ACTIONS.<br />
SUBSEQUENTLY, AS PART OF THE THOROUGHGOING REVIEW OF THE<br />
ECONOMY WHICH HAS BEEN PROCEEDING SINCE ABOUT MID-JANUARY, WE MOVED,<br />
WITH YOUR APPROVAL, TO EFFECT FURTHER SHARP REDUCTIONS IN INTEREST<br />
RATES ON GOVERNMENT SECURITIES. AT THE SAME TIME, AND IN PART AS<br />
A CONSEQIJENCE, WE MOVED ALSO TO HAVE SIGNIFICANT REDUCTIONS MADE IN<br />
TRADING BANK LENDING AND DEPOSIT RATES. THESE LATTER MOVES WERE,<br />
IN EFFECT, FRUITS OF THE REVIEW WHICH COMMENCED SOME WEEKS AGO. </p>
<p>7<br />
BEFORE ANNOUNCING WHAT WE NOW HAVE IN MIND AS A FOLLOWUP<br />
TO THOSE RECENT AND EARLIER ACTIONS; IT MAY BE WORTHWHILE FIRST<br />
TO LOOK BRIEFLY AT SOME PARTICULhAR ASPECTS OF THE CURRENT ECONOMIC<br />
SITUATION AND THE REASONS FOR THE CHANGES WE INTEND TO MAKE,<br />
NON-METROPOLITAN UNEMPLOYMENT<br />
ONE IMPORTANT ASPECT OF THE CURRENT LABOUR MARKET<br />
RESULTS FROM THE EXTRAORDINARILY DIFFICULT SITUATION WHICH IS<br />
CONFRONTING SOME OF OUR RURAL INDUSTRIES. THE GRANTS WHICH WE<br />
INTRODUCED LAST DECEMBER FOR RELIEF OF NON-METROPOLITAN<br />
UNEMPLOYMENT HAVE. IT IS TRUE, ALREADY HAD A USEFUL IMPACT ON<br />
THIS ELEMENT IN THE SITUATION.<br />
THESE GRANTS ARE DESIGNED) TO FINANCE ADDITIONAL LABOURINTENSIVE<br />
ACTIVITIES OF A PRODUCTIVE KIND BY STATE, SEMI-GOVERNMENT<br />
AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT AUTHORITIES IN ORDER TO PROVIDE EMPLOYMENT<br />
OPPORTUNITIES IN NON-METROPOLITAN AREAS, AS SUCH,-THEY HAVE<br />
ALREADY PERMITTED MUCH URGENT AND USEFUL WORK TO BE UNDERTAKEN<br />
AND HAVE MADE A SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTION TOWARDS THE STRUCTURAL<br />
PROBLEM OF NON-METROPOLITAN UNEMPLOYMENT THAT [ S INVOLVED,,<br />
IN THE LIGHT OF EXPERIENCE WITH THIS SCHEME, THE<br />
GOVERNMENT BELIEVES THAT MORE COULD NOW BE DONE IN THIS AREA.<br />
WE THEREFORE PROPOSE9 SUBJECT TO YOUR AGREEMENT, THAT THE MONTHLY<br />
RATE OF EXPENDITURES.. UNDER THE SCHEME BE*' TNCREASED,<br />
AT PRESENT2~ THE GRANTS ARE SET AT $ 2,25 MILLION PER<br />
MONTH,, WE BELIEVE THAT THIS AMOUNT COULD BE INCREASED; EFFECTIVE<br />
AS FROM TODAY,. TO A RATE OF $ 4 MILLION PER MONTH. IN THE BALANCE<br />
OF THIS FINANCIAL YEAR AND SUBJECT TO REVIEW IN JUNE THE<br />
ADDITIONAL FUNDS INVOLVED WOULD AMOUNT TO $ 7.75 MILLION. v/ </p>
<p>8-<br />
IN TERMS OF IMPACT ON THE ECONOMY, A CLEARER IMPRESSION<br />
IS CREATED IF WE THINK IN TERMS OF AN ANNUAL RATE OF INCREASED<br />
SPENDING OF $ 21 MILLION PER ANNUM' BRINGING THE ANNUAL RATE OF<br />
SPENDING UNDER THE SCHEME, AS REVISED, TO $ 48 MILLION PER ANNUM IN ALL,<br />
IN REACHING OUR DECISION, LA ST DECEMBER, TO OFFER THESE<br />
FUNDS FOR NON -METROPOLITAN EMPLOYMENT PURPOSES, WE WERE OF COURSE<br />
VERY CONSCIOUS OF THE PARTICULAR PROBLEMS AND SOCIAL COSTS OF UNEMPLOYMENT<br />
IN RURAL AREAS, WHERE AVENUES FOR NEW EMPLOYMENT ARE OFTEN VERY<br />
LIMITED. UNEMPLOYMENT, HOWEVER, CAN AND DOES BRING HARDSHIP WHEREVER<br />
IT OCCURS. THIS IS THE REASON WHY THE GOVERNMENT HAS, OVER THE YEARS,<br />
PAID BENEFITS TO ELIGIBLE UNEMPLOYED. IT IS SOME TIME SINCE THE RATE<br />
OF THIS BENEFIT WAS INCREASED. FOR THAT AND OTHER REASONS WE THINK<br />
THE TIME OPPORTUNE TO CHANGE THE RATE. WE HAVE DECIDED TO INCREASE<br />
THE ADULT* RATE FOR UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFIT, AND ASSOCIATED SHORT TERM<br />
SICKNESS AND SPECIAL BENEFITS, FROM $ 10 PER WEEK TO $ 17 PER WEEK.<br />
JUNIOR RATES FOR 16-17 YEAR OLDS AND FOR 18-20 YEAR OLDS WILL BE<br />
INCREASED RESPECTIVELY BY $ 3 AND $ 5 PER WEEK.<br />
WE WILL BRING FORWARD LEGISLATION TO THE PARLIAMENT To GIVE<br />
EFFECT TO THESE INCREASES AS A MATTER OF URGENCY.<br />
SOME MEASURES, SUCH AS THE NON-METROPOLITAN EMPLOYMENT<br />
GRANTS, HAVE A DIRECT INFLUENCE UPON DEMAND FOR GOODS AND SERVICES,<br />
INCLUDING LABOUR. BUT BROADER MEASURES WHICH SHOULD INFLUENCE CONFIDENCE<br />
AND ACTIVITY WILL ALSO BE OF BENEFIT. THE GOVERNM4ENT HAS ACCORDINGLY<br />
DECIDED THAT ADDITIONAL MEASURES OF THIS BROADER KIND ARE NOW<br />
DESIRABLE. </p>
<p>9-<br />
INVESTMENT ALLOWANCE<br />
WE HAVE HAD IT PUT TO US FROM MANY QUARTERS IN RECENT<br />
WEEKS THAT THE SINGLE MEASURE MOST LIKELY TO BOOST CONFIDENCE AND<br />
ACTIVITY ON THE PART OF INDUSTRY, AND MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY IN<br />
PARTICULAR, IS THE RESTORATION OF THE SPECIAL IN-VESTMENT ALLOWANCE<br />
FOR MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY.<br />
THIS WAS, YOU WILL RECALL, SUSPENDED TWELVE MONTHS AGO.<br />
ALTHOUGH THE MAJOR DETERMINANT OF IN-VESTMENT EXPENDITURE MUST, OF<br />
COURSE, BE THE EXPECTED GROWTH OF DEMAND RELATIVE TO EXISTING<br />
PRODUCTIVE CAPACITY, WE ARE PERSUADED OF THE FORCE OF THE VIEW I HAVE<br />
STATED ABOUT THE INFLUENCE OF THE INVESTMENT ALLOWANCE IN BOOSTING<br />
CONFIDENCE. ACCORDINGLY, THE GOVERNMENT HAS DECIDED TO RESTORE THE<br />
SPECIAL INVESTMENT ALLOWANCE ON NEW INVESTMENT IN MANUFACTURING<br />
PLANT AND EQUIPMENT AS FROM THIS DAY, IN THE FORM IN WHICH IT<br />
PREVIOUSLY EXISTED. ON THE BASIS OF THE VIEWS THAT HAVE BEEN PUT<br />
TO US, THIS STEP CAN BE EXPECTED TO STIMULATE ACTIVITY ACROSS A WIDE<br />
SPECTRUM OF AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRY.<br />
THE TREASURER WILL MAKE A FURTHER STATEMENT ON THIS SUBJECT,<br />
IN A MORE DETAILED FORM LATER TODAY.<br />
THE MEASURES WHICH I HAVE JUST ANNOUNCED, TAKEN TOGETHER<br />
WITH THE MONETARY MEASURES WE ANNOUNCED LAST WEEK AND THE ACTIONS<br />
WE-TOOK LATE LAST YEAR, WILL WORK BOTH DIRECTLY AND INDIRECTLY TO<br />
ENCOURAGE ACTIVITY IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR.<br />
PUBLIC SECTOR FOR OUR PART, WE THINK THIS IS APPROPRIATE. BUT THERE<br />
IS CLEARLY ALSO A CASE FOR SOME MEASURED ADJUSTMENT TO DEVELOPING<br />
CIRCUMS'" ANCES IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR. </p>
<p>10<br />
PUBLIC AUTHORITY EXPENDITURE OVERALL IS PRESENTLY ONE OF<br />
THE STRONG POINTS IN THE ECONOMY. IN REAL TERMS, THE OVERALL POSITION<br />
IS ONE OF STRONGER GROWTH THAN LAST YEAR. WITHIN THIS OVERALL PICTURE,<br />
TOTAL PUBLIC AUTHORITY CAPITAL EXPENDITURE IS GROWING MORE SLOWLY<br />
THAN CURRENT EXPENDITURE. THIS FOLLOWS A PERIOD WHEN, IN 1970-71 THlE<br />
IMPACT OF RAPIDLY-ESCALATING WAGE COSTS ON STATE BUDGETS WAS SUCH<br />
THAT, DESPITE CONSIDERABLE SPECIAL ASSISTANCE FROM THE COMMONWEALTH,<br />
A NUMBER OF IMPORTANT STATE WORKS HAD TO BE DEFERRED.<br />
SIMILARLY, THE WORKS ACTIVITIES OF CERTAIN OF THE STATE<br />
SEMI-GOVERNMENTAL AND LOCAL AUTHORITIES HAVE ALSO HAD TO BE CURTAILED<br />
AND WE ARE AWARE, FROM THE DIRECT REPRESENTATIONS COMING FORWARD TO<br />
U31IN THAT FIELD, THAT SOME RELAXATION THERE WOULD BE WIDELY<br />
WELCOMED. IN THIS RESPECT I MENTION THAT THE SEMI-GOVERNMENTAL<br />
AUTHORITIES HAVE BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL IN THEIR LOAN-RAISING ACTIVITIES<br />
IN THIS FINANCIAL YEAR TO DATE.<br />
WORKS AND HOUSING AND SEMI-GOVERNMENT BORROWING PROGRAMMES<br />
IN THE LIGHT OF OUR OVERALL OBJECTIVES, WE BELIEVE THERE<br />
IS NOW A CASE FOR SUITABLE INCREASES BOTH IN THE STATES' WORKS AND<br />
HOUSING AND THE SEMI-GOVERNMENT BORROWING PROGRAMMES. ANY INCREASE<br />
IN THE WORKS AND HOUSING PROGRAMME TO WHICH WE MIGHT AGREE WOULD,,<br />
OF COURSE,* INVOLVE THE COMMONWEALTH IN TAKING UP PART OF SUCH<br />
INCREASE, 24.4 PER CENT TO BE PRECISE, IN THE FORM OF INTERESTFREE<br />
CAPITAL GRANTS.<br />
IN PROPOSING TO INCREASE THESE BORROWING PROGRAMMES, WE<br />
SEEK YOUR ASSURANCE THAT THE ADDITIONAL FUNDS SHOULD, SO FAR AS<br />
IS PRACTICABLE WITHOUT LOSS OF EFFICIENCY AND EFFECTIVENESS, BE<br />
UTILISED QUICKLY, HAVING IN MIND WHAT I BELIEVE TO BE OUR COMMON<br />
OBJECTIVES RELATING TO EMPLOYMENT. / 11 </p>
<p>11<br />
AS WE UNDERSTAND IT, YOU HAVE NO LACK OF TASKS TO BE<br />
DONE, PARTICULARLY IN YOUR URBAN AREAS. HOUSING, SCHOOLS, WATER<br />
SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE ALL THESE, WE KNOW, AND OTHERS, PROVIDE<br />
OP'OORTUNITIES FOR EXPENDITURES OF THE KIND WE HAVE IN MIND.<br />
STATE REVENUE BUDGETS PROSPECTIVE POSITIONS<br />
SOME PREMIERS MAY WISH TO REFER NOT ONLY TO THEIR LOAN<br />
PROGRAMMES BUT ALSO TO THEIR PROSPECTIVE REVENUE BUDGETS FOR<br />
1971-72. I TAKE THE OPPORTUNITY OF INFORMING YOU THAT, SINCE THE<br />
COMMONWEALTH BUDGET ESTIMATES WERE FRAMED, THERE HAVE BEEN REVISIONS<br />
TO ELEMENTS OF THE FORMULA DETERMINING THE FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE<br />
GRANTS TO BE PAID TO THE STATES IN 1971-72.<br />
THESE REVISIONS WILL RESULT, ON PRESENT FIGURING, IN AN<br />
INCREASE IN THE AMOUNT STATES WILL RECEIVE BY WAY OF GENERAL REVENUE<br />
ASSISTANCE IN THIS FINANCIAL YEAR. WHILE THESE ESTIMATES, LIKE<br />
OTHERS MADE AT THIS TIME OF THE FINANCIAL YEAR, CAN ONLY BE BEST<br />
GUESSES, WE PRESENTLY CALCULATE THE INCREASE IN-VOLVED AS OF THE<br />
ORDER OF $ 20 MILLION.<br />
IN THINKING ABOUT THIS MATTER MORE GENERALLY, WE HAVE<br />
IN MIND THE UNCERTAINTIES WHICH SURROUND OUR OWN BUDGET-ESTIMATING<br />
PROCEDURES EVEN AT THIS TIME OF THE FINANCIAL YEAR. WE EXPECT THAT<br />
SIMILAR UNCERTAINTIES ALSO EXIST IN THE CASE OF STATE BUDGETS.<br />
FOR THAT REASON, OUR OWN VIEW HAS NORMALLY BEEN THAT THESE<br />
MATTERS ARE MORE APPROPRIATELY SUBJECTS FOR DISCUSSION AT THE<br />
REGULAR JUNE PREMIERS' CONFERENCE THAN AT A CONFERENCE SUCH AS THIS<br />
TODAY, CONVENED AS IT HAS BEEN PRINCIPALLY TO DISCUSS THE ECONOMIC<br />
SITUATION. / 12 </p>
<p>12<br />
THIS IS NOT TO BE TAKEN AS IMPLYING THAT THERE CANNOT<br />
BE DISCUSSION. WE SHALL LISTEN CAREFULLY TO ANYTHING THAT YOU<br />
MAY'CARE TO PUT ON THIS POINT JUST AS YOU WILL, I AM SURE,<br />
CONSIDER THE VIEWS WE HAVE AS TO WHETHER ACTION IN THIS AREA IS<br />
NOW APPROPRIATE. THE MEASURES I HAVE ANNOUNCED AND THOSE THE GOVERNMENT<br />
HAD PREVIOSLY TAKEN IN RECENT MONTHS ARE DESIGNED TO DE~ AL WITH<br />
SPECIFIC PROBLEMS WHILE AT THE SAME TIME PROVIDING A STIMULUS TO<br />
THE ECONOMY IN LINE WITH OUR CONTINUING OBJECTIVE OF MAINTAINING<br />
ITS GROWTH ' MOMENTUM.<br />
BUT I MUST EMPHASISE THAT THERE IS A FINE LINE BETWEEN<br />
ACTION DESIGNED TO THAT END AND ACTION WHICH WILL TILT THE BALANCE<br />
TOO FAR, RESULTING IN THE LOSS OF SUCH HARD-WON SUCCESS AS HAS SO<br />
FAR BEEN ACHIEVED IN CONTAINING INFLATION.<br />
THE MEASURES WE HAVE CHOSEN, AND THEIR EXTENT, ARE<br />
DESIGNED TO MAINTAIN THE BALANCE. IN THIS RESPECT WE HAVE A<br />
NARROW PATH TO TREAD: WE MUST TREAD IT.<br />
INFLATI ON HAVING ACTED TO STIMUIATE ACTIVITY AND EMPLOYMENT, WE<br />
MUST CONTINUE TO SEEK ANOTHER OBJECTIVE THE CONTROL OF<br />
INFLATION. FOR THE EFFECTS OF INFLATION ARE INSIDIOUS. IT IS<br />
NOT MERELY AN ECONOMIC PROBLEM, BUT ALSO A SOCIAL ONE. o / 13 </p>
<p>13<br />
I HAVE ALREADY MENTI ONED) THE COMMONWEALTH'S<br />
INTERVENTION IN ARBITRATION COMMISSION AWARD HEARINGS. IN RECENT<br />
TIMES THAT INTERVENTION HAS. IN RECOGNITION OF THE INCREASING<br />
GRAVITY OF THE PROBLEM OF WAGE-INDUCED INFLATION,; BEEN MORE<br />
FREQUENT AND MORE VIGOROUS THAN FOR MANY YEARS PAST,<br />
I INSTANCE AS EXAMPLES THE'CARPENTERS CASE, THE ANNUAL<br />
LEAVE CASE AND THE BANK OFFICIALS' CASE. I ADD THAT WE WILL; OF<br />
COURSE,. BE MAKING VERY STRONG REPRESENTATIONS TO THE COMMISSION<br />
IN THE NATIONAL WAGE CASE WHICH HAS BEEN LISTED TO RESUME NEXT<br />
WEEK. IT HARDLY NEEDS SAYING THAT THE OUTCOME OF THAT CASE WILL<br />
BE OF GREAT IMPORTANCE TO YOUR OWN BUDGETS AND WILL HAVE A CRUCIAL<br />
IMPACT ON COSTS AND PRICES IN THE FUTURE.,<br />
WE HAVE BEEN URGING PIVATE EMPLOYERS TO RESIST<br />
EXTRAVAGANT CLAIMS FOR INCREASED WAGES AND IMPROVED CONDITIONS<br />
MADE UPON THEM,. AND WHICH CAN CIY RESULT IN FURTHER PRESSURE<br />
UPON THEM TO RAISE PRICES IN ORDER TO CARRY THEIR INCREASED COST<br />
STRUCTURE, WE RECOGNISE, HOWEVER, THAT VE CANNOT HOPE TO EXERCISE<br />
A SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE IN THAT WAY IF THERE IS ANY WIDESPREAD<br />
FEELING AMONG BUSINESSMEN THAT WE ARE NOT; IN FACT, EXERCISING<br />
RESTRAINT WITHIN TH-E AREAS OPEN TO OUR DIRECT INFLUENCE THE PUBLIC<br />
SERVICE AND THE VARIOUS COMMONWEALTH STATUTORY BODIES.<br />
THE COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC SERVICE BOARD HAS, IN FACT:, A<br />
FIRM POLICY OF NEITHER LEADING THE WAY IN ITS DETERMINATIONS ON<br />
WAGES AND CONDITIONS OF SERVICE NOR LAGGING SO FAR BEHIND THAT<br />
RECRUITMENT TO AND THE EFFICIENCY OF THE SERVICE BEGINS TO SUFFER,. </p>
<p>14<br />
I WISH TO UNDERLINE THAT POLICY.<br />
AT THIS TIME, HOWEVER, WE HAVE A PARTICULAR SITUATION<br />
REL; ATING TO THE WHITE COLLAR AREA WHICH GIVES CAUSE FOR VERY<br />
SERI'OUS CONCERN NOT MERELY TO THE COMMONWEALTH BUT I THINK TO ALL<br />
OF US HERE TODAY.<br />
IN ONE STATE, ADMINISTRATIVE AND CLERICAL OFFICERS WITHIN<br />
THE PUBLIC SERVICE AN]) THE STATUTORY AUTHORITIES HAVE BEEN GRANTED<br />
AN INCREASE OF 9 PER CENT IN WAGE RATES.<br />
I AM NOT CONCERNED TO-CANVASS THE CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH<br />
THAT INCREASE CAME ABOUT, ALTHOUGH I NOTE AND WELCOME THE SUBSEQUENT<br />
ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE PREMIER OF VICTORIA THAT HE PROPOSES A RADICAL<br />
OVERHAUL OF THE WAGE-FIXING MACHINERY IN HIS STATE DESIGNED TO<br />
ENSUR~ E THAT SUCH A CHAIN OF CIRCUMSTANCES COULD NOT OCCUR IN<br />
FUTURE. WE SHOULD BE GLAD TO HEAR FURTHER FROM HIM ON THAT MATTER<br />
SHOULD HE SO DESIRE.<br />
WHAT I AM CONCERNED ABOUT NOW IS TO ENSURE THAT THE<br />
INCREASE IS " QUARANTINED" TO THAT PARTICULAR STATE, AS FAR AS OUR<br />
OWN ACTIONS AN]) POLICIES MAY MAKE THAT POSSIBLE AND THAT THIS<br />
INCREASE DOES NOT SPREAD GENERALLY TO WHITE COLLAR WORKERS THROUGHOUT<br />
-TH1E ECONOMY. SHOULD WE FAIL IN THAT RESPECT, THE CONSEQUENCES ARE<br />
CLEAR. STATE BUDGETS WILL ONCE AGAIN BE UNHINGED, PUBLIC AUTHORITIES<br />
AT ALL LEVELS WILL BE FORCED ONCE AGAIN TO CONSIDER RAISING THEIR<br />
CHARGES TO MPEET THEIR INCREASED COSTS, AND THE INFLATIONARY SPIRAL<br />
WILL BE GIVEN A NEW AND SERIOUS TWIST. SUCH AN OUTCOME WILL OBVIOUSLY<br />
BE DAMAGING TO THE BEST INTERESTS OF THIS COUNTRY. </p>
<p>15<br />
I THEREFORE TELL YOU NOW THAT THE COMMONWEALTH PROPOSES TO<br />
TAKE WHATEVER ACTION IT CAN TO CONTAIN THE FLOW-ON OF THE 9 PER<br />
CENT INCREASE TO WHICH I HAVE REFERRED IN THE AREA OF THE COMMONWEALTH<br />
PUBLIC SERVICE OR COMMONWEALTH INSTRUMENTALITIES. WITHIN THE<br />
PROVISIONS OF THE PUBLIC SERVICE ARBITRATION ACT, WE WILL PUT OUR<br />
CASE RELATING TO SUCH INCREASES AT APPROPRIATE STAGES OF THE ARBITRAL<br />
PROCESS. WE WILL ALSO INTERVENE, WHENEVER THE OPPORTUNITY IS OPEN<br />
TO US, AGAINST CLAIMS OF A LIKE KIND IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR.<br />
THIS IS A SERIOUS DECISION, AN) NOT ONE THAT WE HAVE<br />
TAKEN LIGHTLY. NEVERTHELESS, WE BELIEVE IT TO BE NECESSARY IF THE<br />
UPWARD THRUST TO THE GENERAL LEVEL OF WAGl COSTS IS TO BE BLUNTED AND<br />
IF ANY REAL PROGRESS IS TO BE MADE IN THE BATTLE AGAINST COSTINFLATION.<br />
IT IS CLEAR, HOWEVER, THAT THE PROSPECT OF ACHIEVING THOSE<br />
OBJECTIVES WILL BE VERY MUCH ENHANCED IF A UNITED FRONT IS TAKEN<br />
TOWARDS THEM BY THE PUBLIC SECTOR AS A WHOLE. TO ACHIEVE THIS<br />
OBJECTIVE, I INVITE THE PREMIERS TO JOIN WITH THE COMMONWEALTH HERE<br />
TODAY IN EXPRESSING THEIR DETERMINATION ALSO TO RESIST THESE " NEW ROUND"<br />
CLAIMS WITHIN THE AREAS OF THEIR OWN PUBLIC SERVICES AND STATUTORY BODIES.<br />
WE REGARD THIS AS A MATTER OF HIGH NATIONAL IMPORTANCE.<br />
WE SIMPLY CANNOT STAND ASIDE AND PASSIVELY ALLOW THE<br />
EVENTS THAT HAVE ALREADY OCCURRED IN VICTORIA ( AND WHICH OF COURSE<br />
CANNOT NOW BE UNDONE) TO BE MULTIPLIED ELSEWHERE WITHIN THE ECONOMY.<br />
THIS, GENTLEMEN, IS THE PROGRAMME WHICH WE PUT TO YOU<br />
TODAY FOR* DISCUSSION AND ON WHIChf WE INVITE YOUR VIEWS. </p>
