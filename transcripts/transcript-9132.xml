MARGARIT FLETCHER PRESENTER:<br />
But right now, as you probably just heard before, at fairly<br />
late notice so we couldn't give you too much warning, on<br />
the line is the Prime Minister of Australia, Paul Keating.<br />
Prime Minister, welcome to you.<br />
PAUL KEATING PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Hello Margaret. Nice to be here.<br />
FLETCHER:<br />
Well, it's nice to welcome you back to 3AW, ' cause you've<br />
been a bit quiet on the media in Melbourne. You<br />
haven't been on 3AW, I think, since the election?<br />

waste my time arguing with people who've made their<br />
years ago.<br />
F LETCHER:<br />
Well, I suppose in fairness, that there are issues that have<br />
got to be taken up in a critical sense. I mean, if we could<br />
start on one, and that's the so-called sports rorts, Ros<br />
Kelly affair. And for the life of me, I'm intrigued as to<br />
why she's still therc.<br />
KEATING: Well, do you know much about the issue? I mean, what's<br />
happened herc is that there's a programme to provide<br />
grants to small sporting clubs. This is your amateur<br />
sporting clubs who can't put enough money together for a<br />
netball court or a basketball court, or refurbishing a green<br />
on a bowling club, or this sort of thing.<br />
Now, what the Opposition are saying, they're saying we<br />
we're not alleging fraud here, we're not alleging any<br />
corruption here. They've made that clear. They don't<br />
like the choices of Mrs Kelly, in respect of these<br />
particular grants. Now, what she's made clear is, that in<br />
Labor electorates, you're more likely to find an absence<br />
of these kind of facilities, and she's argued that case. But<br />
nobody's said, no one has argued, that this money hasn't<br />
been spent properly, because one of the criteria in this,<br />
Margaret, is that the money is first expended by the<br />
proponents and then reimbursed by the Commonwealth.<br />
So it's got to be spent first, before we actually pay it.<br />
Now so the charge against Mrs Kelly is that the Liberal Rehame Australia<br />

on what basis did you choose it, and she said I've chosen<br />
it myself, as a minister.<br />
FLETCHER: On the white board.<br />
KEATING: Well, it doesn't matter how you do it. I mean, you<br />
see, because none of them as only now, John Howard<br />
and Andrew Peacock have held a ministerial job; the<br />
only ones who have held a ministerial job. There is<br />
there's no one held down a big job. They don't know<br />
what a minister's life is like. And a minister makes, you<br />
know, up to, you know, thirty, forty, some of the times,<br />
you know, decisions like that a day.<br />

that's the job.<br />

draft parliamentary inquiry results say that all their<br />
questioning according to The Financial Review's ( sic)<br />
ministerial compctence and damning her role is totally<br />
inadequate. I mean, I'm not suggesting fraud either, but<br />
you would know the perception is also something in<br />

3AW, at one stage. We just sort of it's so outrageous.<br />
Well, the point is if you've got to make a decision as a<br />
minister see, this idea that a minister has<br />
recommendations from a department which says box A,<br />
tick if you agree; box B, tick if you don't agree; and box<br />
B, maybe, and the minister sits up there like some kind of<br />
dummy that just ticks one box or another, and if they<br />
don't have a piece of paper recommending that therefore<br />
they're not administering properly, no anyone who<br />
thinks that, knows nothing about the Government of the<br />

everybody's I mean pork barrelling has been part of<br />
politics forever. It's just the way that she's gone about it,<br />
and apparently making decisions on the run to up<br />
programmes. 1 also know of programmes that were rated<br />
in those categories that didn't get the money when she<br />
should ( sic), but again I would get back to the fact that<br />
this is not going to away. I mean, the Opposition won't<br />
let it go. Isn't it better to cut your losses.<br />
K EAkTING:<br />
Oh well, it's case of so, in other words, if the<br />
Opposition keep asking questions, we have a minister<br />
resign. Now, what if they ask another minister a series of<br />
questions about some matter, and if gets past two weeks<br />
of questions, we say, well that minister better resign too.<br />
I mean, I don't remember I mean, John Howard was<br />
up there yesterday with all the fury in the world, saying<br />
Mrs Kelly should resign. I don't remember him resigning<br />
when the McCabe Lanfranchi report came down in<br />
Victoria, about the criminal evasion of the tax system. He<br />
just sat there as it he were glued to the seat with araldyte.<br />
So I mean, frankly, you've got to be around here a long<br />
time to see a big issue and that was the biggest the<br />
biggest scandal in public administration in the post-war<br />
years was the evasion of the bottom-of-the-harbour<br />
schemes in the 1980s. And you've got Mr Howard up<br />
here saying to Ros Kelly, who's handing money to a band<br />
hail, that she should resign and he said this morning,<br />
and never come back for life. In other words, resign<br />

colourful. KEAT1NG: characters. I mean, you know. So, what you've got to<br />
do is separate out here a lot of the hyperbole from the<br />
value of the programmes. And wha...<br />
FLETCHER: The public perception still is, Prime Minister, that she is<br />
incompetent, that she has not done this in what we would<br />
see as a businesslike way. It's thirty million dollars. And<br />
I would have thought that it's damaging you and your<br />
party. I mean, I would have thought that there would be<br />
a lot of people in within the Government who would<br />
be very uneasy about Ros Kelly. It won't go away.<br />

questions. FLETCHER:,-But they will keep asking them.<br />

from this report of findings, are in fact the report's<br />

FLETCHER: But you see what I'm saying. It's obvious that the as<br />
you say, the Opposition's going to go on. Therefore, the<br />
issue won't go away. In a public sense, we're looking at<br />
this brawling going on, and I would have thought, in a<br />
political sense, it would be just as easy to chop.<br />
KEATING: Well okay, but let's you chop people when they have<br />
actually done something which is either there's always<br />
questions about magnitude; forn and substance,<br />
magnitude. Now, if there was fraud here, if there was<br />
some obvious problem of that dimension, that becomes a<br />
you know, a much more obvious matter. But this is<br />
not the case here. See, nobody, even the opponents<br />

see what it has to say.<br />
FLETCHER: Okay. Well, we'll move onto another subject perhaps,<br />
and that is question time this afternoon, and the changes<br />
in the rules there. Again, I would talk as a voter; and it<br />
really annoys me that you're rostering people and that<br />
question time has moved, and even the ABC's putting on<br />
the kid's programmes in front of question time.<br />
KEATILG: the ABC. That's nothing to do with me.<br />
FLETCHER: No, I know it's up to the ABC. But it's because of the<br />
time changes, etcetera. I mean, we don't I wonder<br />
about the accountability now. What chance have we, as a<br />
public, have to there a lot of people who listen to<br />
question time, or who watch question time. They won't<br />
have that opportunity, and nor will you be there very<br />
often. KEATING: I'll be there two days a week. I'll be there this afternoon,<br />
as I was on Monday afternoon.<br />
FLETCHIER: But that's a it's such I mean question time is the one<br />
time when the Opposition gets a chance to question the<br />
government. </p>
<p>R E H A M E<br />
KEATING: And they now get a better chance, in a sense, because<br />
they'll have a smaller group of ministers each day<br />
FLETCHER: You're not seriously telling me this.<br />
KEATING: Yes, if you actually<br />
FLETCHER: ( Laughs).<br />
KEATING: See well, you're you may be a question time<br />
listener, but you're not a question time watcher, here.<br />
Now, let me tell you what's happened here over the years.<br />
When I first came here, twenty-five years ago, an ordinary<br />
backbench member could ask a minister a matter about<br />
his or her electorate, and matters of substance. Now, all<br />
the questions are picked by the Opposition Whip, with<br />
the Lleader of the Opposition, for maximum political<br />
effect. An ordinary backbench member gets no question<br />
and no chance to ask a question. And ninety per cent of<br />
the answers arc given by three or four ministers.<br />
So in other words, largely, the Government goes<br />
unscrutinised and, largely, backbench members can'l. raise<br />
electorate or other policy issues in their own right.<br />
In other words, what's happened with question time, it's<br />
become a very stylised leader-to-leader, first two or three Rehams Australia<br />

bench, on either side, contest. And therefore, I believe,<br />
it's not serving accountability well, it's not serving<br />
information well, and it's not serving the public debate<br />
well. FLTCHER: Well surely there are some rules and regulations that<br />
could be changed to improve question time, rather than<br />
take the main players out of it.<br />
KEATING: Well, I don't I mean see, to be accountable to for<br />
the Government to be accountable twice a week on each<br />
sitting week, is a lot of accountability, particularly when<br />
on every other day, ministers are present. So for four<br />
days a week and remember in this. arrangement, we're<br />
giving the Opposition an extra sitting day each week so,<br />
instead of three days and four days, it's four days and<br />
four days and a second chamber for further debate,<br />
where we can elucidate things. That is, where people<br />
may wish to speak in committee stages on bills, can now<br />
go to a second chamber, where that time would be<br />
truncated in the House of Representatives.<br />
The reform, overall I mean, if you were able to see the<br />
first half an hour of question time yesterday, I think you<br />
would have seen question time working well. For<br />

KEATING: Well, but understand what the Government is. The<br />
Government is the business of the country.<br />
Accountability in Parliament important is another<br />
thing. It's a matter of how one exercises the<br />
opportunities of that accountability. The track record is I<br />
used to get one question a week from the leader of the<br />
Opposition over the last year. One a week. So now, I<br />
got more in tact, I got more questions on the first day,<br />
on Monday. And yesterday, for instance, Mr Beazley,<br />
who's Minister for Finance, was getting questioned about<br />
genuine Finance Department issues, which he would<br />
never have got in the old format.<br />
So the the new format's working quite well. In fact,<br />
the Opposition's claiming yesterday, it's because Mrs Kelly<br />
was in there on Tuesday in the new format, that they<br />
were able to ask the question that they did.<br />

1 mean, after all, take the mother of parliaments in<br />
Britain; the Prime Minister goes to question time twice a<br />
week and ministers are asked questions at other times.<br />
It's exactly what we're doing hcre.<br />

KEATIXGIt's become a stale tradition, and not an interesting one.<br />
And one where, what you're getting is basically a<br />
twenty-second clip on the fourth item of the commercial<br />
news services, which doesn't take most of us anywhere.<br />
FLETCHER; Well as I said, we'll agree to disagree, ' cause I know<br />
you're just out of time. I did say that at quarter to one,<br />
we would free up your time. But I just wanted to ask, on<br />
the Russian spies, could you tell me why we don't know<br />
what happened there? Why it's only now that we've<br />
found out?<br />
KEATTNG;<br />
This is with the US, you mean?<br />
FLETCHER: With the five Russians.<br />
expelled from Australia. No, it was the Russians being<br />
KEATING: Well, I'm not sure 1 can be as informative about this as<br />
you might like me to be. I think we might take that one<br />
on notice. Well, 1 mean, 1 can talk to you about that<br />
again. FLETCHER:<br />
Okay. Well, I thank you<br />
you won't leave it as long<br />
on 3AW. for your time, and I hope that<br />
next time that you'll come back<br />

KEATING: No. Well, I'm look, I'm quite happy. Let me I've<br />
got no superstitions about 3AW. But it's got to be in the<br />
news and information business. It can't be in the political<br />
pamphleteering business.<br />
FLETCI TER:<br />
But, you see, I had lots to talk to you about today, but<br />
we're out of time now.<br />
KEATING: You and I are not on the breakfast programme, or the<br />
mid-morning programme.<br />
FLETCHER: All right. Well, will you come back on my programme?<br />
KEATING:<br />
Well, I think I will.<br />
LETCHER:<br />
Good. Well, that'd be lovely, Prime Minister. And I've<br />
got a number of things to talk to you about.<br />

Thank you. Thank you for your time.<br />

perhaps, which is really more than I can say, in a personal<br />
sense, than about Ros Kelly.<br />
But nevertheless, the Prime Minister has said he'll come<br />
back on the programme. Next time, we might ask more<br />
things, like the jobs situation and the levy, etecctera. I<br />
didn't get a chance to ask him about the Opposition, but<br />
my undertaking was that we would have the Prime<br />
Minister for quarter of an hour, and therefore that's what<br />
we'vc done.<br />
But nevertheless, hopefully the Prime Minister will be<br />
back on the programme very soon.<br />
