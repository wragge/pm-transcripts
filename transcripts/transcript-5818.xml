-Ay<br />
FOR MEDIA SATURDAY, 15 MAY 1982_<br />
FEDERAL COUNCIL<br />
I would like to thank my colleague Prime Minister Ratu Mara<br />
for coming here and being our guest of honour okt this<br />
occasion. He has been a good friend of Australia and relations<br />
between Fiji and Australia have grown closer and closer over<br />
recent times.<br />
I will be' saying a little more about John Atwill this<br />
evening. Seven years of presidency is a long time, it is<br />
a record. He served this Party faithfully and well. Bob<br />
southeyl6 years on the Federal Executive, earlier on the<br />
Victorian Executive has served theParty very well and over<br />
some very difficult times. Jim Samson, 11 years as Vice-<br />
President and he again has given great service. Jim has<br />
always spoken his mind, as has everyone in this organisation,<br />
but he does it with a bluntness and a forthrightness that<br />
always commands respect.<br />
I would also like to thank Phillip Byhch for being a great servant of<br />
the partyand a great deputy to me over the period of this<br />
Government and John Howard has deserved very much the support<br />
that the Parliamentary Party bestowed on him a<br />
few weeks ago. These are people who have served the Party<br />
well over long periods. They are the kind<br />
of people that make this Party great.<br />
I believe that you would want me to say good luck to Robin<br />
Gray in Tasmania. We expect to hear a little more good<br />
news this evening. He has run a great campaign and he<br />
deserves support and Tasmania deserves release from the<br />
socialist government that has held it back and damaged its<br />
future over recent times. There is somebody else that I believe<br />
that we should send good wishes to and some words of thought<br />
to at this present time.<br />
Margaret Thatcher has been a good friend of this Council.<br />
She has been before us on more than one occasion and I think<br />
in very difficult days for her, it would not hurt to send<br />
from the Council a message of good wishes and of courage. / 2 </p>
<p>-2<br />
We have a great responsibility to proclaim Liberalism, what<br />
it stands for, how it affects the lives and the well-being<br />
of Australians and Australian families. It is not some remote<br />
philosophy that people talk about in the cloisters. Liberalism,<br />
to us, to Australians is a way of life thatgoes out to the<br />
hearts and minds of people. It affects people in their homes<br />
in every part of this land. Under Liberalism Australians have<br />
had and will have a better life than under any other philosophy.<br />
There have been rising living standards. Our policies have<br />
released the energy, the creativity of Australian people.<br />
There has been much achieved and much which Australians can<br />
take pride in.<br />
It is not what we as governments have done, it is what we<br />
through our policies have made possible. It is Australians<br />
who have done the building, it is Australians who have done<br />
the creating. Governments only set the policies and unleash<br />
the energies of the most imaginative and creative people<br />
that the world knows.<br />
I believe that sometimes young Australians don't understand how<br />
much their fathers have in fact achieved over the last<br />
or 30 years, but if they can -think back and look to the measure<br />
of that achievement the rising living standards, the better<br />
homes and houses, better equipment in those houses then they<br />
will see what their fathers have built during their lifetime.<br />
There is much in which they can take pride for that achievement.<br />
As a Liberal Party we have great obligations and great<br />
responsibilities, we have common purposes, a common philosophy.<br />
We obviously don't agree on every item of policy. The purpose<br />
of this Party, of this organisation, of the Party room and<br />
the Party committees is to enable us to talk about our<br />
policies, to see whether adjustments need to be made, to see<br />
whether changing circumstances or the interactions of Australia<br />
and countries overseas require some adjustment, some trimming<br />
of the sails. But we have common purposes, we have a great<br />
obligation to act as one team, as one group committed to one<br />
thing only: not to the advancement of this Party, or to the<br />
people in this Party, but to the advancement of the people<br />
of Australia and to their well-being. That is our purpose.<br />
I believe that since 8 April, which is not a very long while<br />
ago, there is a new reality about the Liberal Party, a reality<br />
of the Liberal Party acting as one team with a common purpose,<br />
a common sense of direction an a total and absolute commitment<br />
to winning that next election and winning seats back that we<br />
lost at the last election.<br />
The revitalised Ministry: Ian Macphee in Industrial Relations,<br />
the appointment has been applauded; Neil Brown, great challenges<br />
ahead of him in Communications with the great technological<br />
changes that are upon us; Jim Killen, to try and re-instil<br />
and re-establish respect for the institution of Parliament<br />
and surely that is very much needed and there is nobody / 3 </p>
<p>-3-<br />
better suited to do it; Ian Viner, to be a voice for industry<br />
to make sure that we can maximnise defence purchases from<br />
Australian industry rather than from overseas; Wal Fife,<br />
Education; Ian Wilson, Aboriginal Affairs; Jim Carlton in<br />
Health; John Hodges in Immigration and Ethnic Affairs. These<br />
are not all the changes, but changes which have been applauded<br />
and the Ministers will be acting in their tasks with great<br />
vigour and with great energy.<br />
I do not want to speak about the Labor Party on this occasion,<br />
except to make one point. We all know that Labor's policies<br />
would be disastrous for Australia. The obligation on us to<br />
make sure that our policies are understood to make sure that<br />
our policies are right, and their merits are understood and<br />
accepted right across Australia rests not just with me and<br />
John Howard and my Parliamentary colleagues, but on all of<br />
you, on every member of the Patty. That is the great<br />
task ahead of us over the next 18 months.<br />
We live at the present time in a somewhat unhappy world.<br />
There are very great difficulties. Last year for the first<br />
time in 20 years world trade actually fell. It has been the<br />
growth of world trade over the last three decades which has<br />
been the engine of the progress; the liberal system of trade<br />
and payments which has made possible the rising living<br />
standards of Australia and of other countries right around the<br />
world. It is not generally understood that there has been<br />
negative growth in the last recorded quarter for industrial<br />
production in 6 of the 7 major countries of the world: in<br />
the United States, where it is not just one quarter but two;<br />
in Germany, Japan, Canada, France and in the United Kingdom<br />
negative growth in all those major countries. And it is not<br />
surprising under those circumstances that unemployment in the<br />
OCED area has risen to nearly 30 million, and is expected to<br />
go beyond 30 million twice the total population of Australia.<br />
The President of the European Commission, when he was out here,<br />
was suggesting that the degree and extent of the economic<br />
hardship and of unemployment could lead to real social instability,<br />
major political instability, in some countries of Europe in<br />
the period ahead of us. I think we sometimes find it hard<br />
to understand what has happened. We get concerned when new<br />
homes starts fell by 12% and we are right to be concerned.<br />
But in the United States the building industry is running<br />
at 35% to 40% of what it was only a short period ago. Instead<br />
of producing 15 million automobiles, the U. S. is producing<br />
about 71 million automobiles: measure that in terms of<br />
hardship and unemployment and damage to an economy.<br />
We have been told that in 6 months time there will be a<br />
recovery. Certain economists have been telling us there<br />
will be a world recovery so often over the last period it's<br />
always six months ahead, it's always around the corner that<br />
I'll believe when 1 see it and I don't believe it can<br />
yet be guaranteed. </p>
<p>-4-<br />
There are somne optimistic signs. In the United -States inflation<br />
has fallen dramatically, and that is certainly a great gain. But<br />
interest rates remain at historically high levels, historically<br />
damaging levels. I think we are all conscious of the damage that<br />
is done when interest rates stay at these high levels for a<br />
prolonged period. It is not just small businesses and<br />
farmers or people who might want to buy a house who are damaged<br />
as a consequence. It is also the great corporations who find<br />
themselves in difficulty if these historically high interest<br />
rates are sustained for too long a period. There is no<br />
universally agreed solution to these particular problems.<br />
The Ministerial Meeting of the OECD, held last week seems to<br />
have run in every direction. There were some promoting policies<br />
that we believe to be right: restraint in expenditure,<br />
bearing down on inflation. But in France they seem to be<br />
taking pride in trebling their deficit, even though they have<br />
14% inflation and it is likely to get much worse under the<br />
policies that they are pursuing. There have been countries<br />
that have said that Germany and Japan should ref late in<br />
other words perhaps damage their economies so that the<br />
weaker economies will have a greater chance of competing..<br />
That hardly seems to be a solution.<br />
Australia is affected by this situation; we find that we<br />
are affected by changes in commodity prices; by the downturn<br />
in trade; and the longer it goes on the more damage there is<br />
likely to be to this nation, the harder it will be for the<br />
Government to insulate Australia from the worst effects of<br />
the world downturn. We need to be conscious of that, conscious<br />
of what we need to do. We need to be particularly careful<br />
that in those areas where we have done so much over the last<br />
12 months we do not damage ourselves as a nation; strikes that<br />
were not necessary; additions to costs and wages, that in the<br />
world environment in which we have to trade and sell, have<br />
been quite unreasonable; and because of shortages and<br />
difficulties in the waterfront, especially in New South Wales<br />
and especially in the coal exporting ports, our reliability<br />
as a trading partner has come into question in certain<br />
quarters. Australians also damage themselves by maybe at this<br />
time last year having had undue optimism, incapable of achievement:<br />
the 1980' s, with the resources boom, where the sky was the limit.<br />
But earlier theis year, with one or two unfortunate economic<br />
statistics, the pendulum swung very much in the other direction<br />
and people seemed to be filled with despair. The truth, of<br />
course., is in between. It was never as good as some seemed<br />
to think, and certainly is not as bad as some people have been<br />
writing over the last few months.<br />
There are great strengths in this economy, and Australia is<br />
marching forward while other countries are shrinking, while<br />
they are not producing more. Australia in .1981 produced<br />
more on revised figures very significant growth indeed.<br />
Investment in 1980/ 81 rose at a 30 year record, up 21% in real<br />
terms; it will be up very much in theis year again somewhere<br />
between 10% and 15%; and while the increase for next year might<br />
not be as great, it is still projected to rise and rise from<br />
a high base. </p>
<p>And the business investment that has taken place in Australia<br />
is establishing a secure base, a strong foundation on which<br />
Australia will be able to build whenever the inevitable<br />
world upturn comes at some point. It will be our factories,<br />
our mines, our people who will be standing ready to take<br />
advantage of those opportunities.<br />
And while in other countries, employment has fallen, in<br />
Australia employment has grown by over 400,000 in the last<br />
three years. The motor industry has had record sales, record<br />
for all times, over the last year and that doesn't get on the<br />
front pages of the newspapers you find it on page 26<br />
in small print if you look hard. In the 1a-3t few weeks,<br />
the interest rates on John Howard's Treasury notes have<br />
come down by 3% or a little better. That doesn't necessarily<br />
get on the front pages either, and I don't write too much<br />
into it. I think we all learn from past predictions, and<br />
I am making none, but at least it is some kind of a pointer.<br />
It is certainly significant. The consumer price index of<br />
1.7% in the March quarter was the lowest quarterly index<br />
since 1979. What does that say to those people who were<br />
suggesting, only a short while ago, that inflation was<br />
running out of control.<br />
And the wage decision that was announced yesterday, while<br />
maybe giving Ian Macphee some difficulties in diplomacy<br />
early in his term of office is certainly the best wage<br />
decision for many years, and maybe the best decision since<br />
we have been in office. Because that decision will give us<br />
breathing time, an opportunity to absorb the increases of<br />
last year which were too high, an opportunity to accommodate<br />
the reductions of hours which came at an unfortunate time.<br />
And that being so, we will be able to maintain and reestablish<br />
Australia's competitive position in the world.<br />
We need to know that our policies are on track. We need to<br />
know and understand that the well-being of Australian<br />
families is being protected and enhanced by those policies.<br />
In the 1980/ 81 year, the after-tax disposable incomes<br />
of Australian households rose by nearly $ 3 billion and<br />
that is a substantial amount. There will be more than a<br />
increase in wages through this year, but even a<br />
increase in wages increases the income of Australian<br />
households by $ 5 billion after tax. That is one of the reasons,<br />
obviously, why some areas of consumer spending are running<br />
high. But the outlook for the future is plainly flatter<br />
than it has been over the last 18 months. Flatter for us,<br />
it is flat, much flatter still for the world. / 6 </p>
<p>-6<br />
We need solutions to be shrinking of world trade; we need<br />
solutions for the problems in the major economies because they are<br />
the engine of growth and progress around the world; and I<br />
believe that we need more than just more of the same. We need<br />
more than just the same suggestions that we need to be restrained<br />
in government spending, to bear down inflation and be responsible<br />
for all those areas that you have heard us talk about so much<br />
over recent years. Those policies are right, and while they can<br />
always be adjusted at the margins, their main thrust is<br />
secure. It is quite plain that for whatever reason whether it is<br />
difficulty with internal politics or whatever a number of<br />
countries around the world have found it difficult to apply<br />
those policies adequately to achieve the advances that are<br />
necessary to lower world unemployment and to achieve a wider<br />
living standard for their own people, to achieve a growth<br />
in world trade.<br />
It is against that background the two meetings that are<br />
going to be held in Europe next month take on a very particular<br />
importance. For six or seven years there has been an economic<br />
summit involving the seven major economies. The next economic<br />
summnit is going to take place at Versailles early in June.<br />
That will be followed by a NATO heads of government meeting in<br />
Bonn a day or two later and that is unusual because NATO heads<br />
of government don't often meet.<br />
I believe that it is not going to be good enough for those<br />
seven major economies to come out with some anodyne communique<br />
which wraps all the difficulties up on cotton wool and pretends<br />
that the world can march on as though nothing had happened.<br />
There is the shadow of those 30 million unemployed in OECD countries<br />
and quite plainly that poses a problem of immense human<br />
proportions. There is-a responsibility on those seven major ecnomies, a<br />
responsibility to give a lead. Some kind of circuit. breaker<br />
is needed. It is worth recording I think, that once before<br />
when there was great -concern once before when there was very<br />
real fear abroad in the world, major leaders were able to come<br />
together with imaginative proposals which led to the<br />
greatest period of growth and progress and of rising living<br />
standards in all countries that the world has ever seen. In<br />
the days just after the World War, world leaders were then<br />
enormously concerned that with the demobilisation of millions of<br />
people, with the transfer from the war time to a peace time<br />
economy, with -the fall off in massive proportions of defence<br />
orders, thatthere would he a reversion to the Depression and to<br />
the unemployment and hardships of the 1930s.<br />
So, they came forward with proposals. With extraordinary<br />
generosity, the Am~ ericans launched the Marshall plan. Through<br />
the Bretton Woods Conference, the formation of the International / 7 </p>
<p>-7<br />
Monetary Fund, and the World Bank, the liberal system of trade<br />
and payments was established. And it led, to the greatest<br />
period of growth and trade, growth in living standards, that<br />
the world has ever seen. It may be some of the same imagination<br />
is needed in present circumstances.<br />
I valued the opportunity that I will have to speak with<br />
President Reagan and Prime Ministers Trudeau and Suzuki<br />
over the next week. I am sorry I am leaving in the middle<br />
of this Council later tonight, but there are some views that<br />
Australia wants to put forward, there are some views that we have,<br />
that we believe may help to act as a circuit breaker in<br />
these circumstances. They have been discussed by the Government<br />
and I will be speaking to 3 of the Heads of Government who will<br />
be at that economic summit.<br />
It is not only economic matters that offer us some concern,<br />
because if countries are arguing about economic directions,<br />
if there is bitterness about high interest rates, or<br />
falling trade or growing protection, it is obviously going to be<br />
much harder to get the unity within the Western Alliance<br />
that is needed at the present time. There have been strains<br />
within that Alliance: how to respond to Afghanistan; how<br />
to respond to the problems of and repression in Poland. And so<br />
often the Alliance talks about the nuts and bolts of military<br />
arrangements without realising without necessarily understanding<br />
that new generations have grown up who knew nothing really of<br />
the reasons why the Alliance was first born. Perhaps there<br />
is a need for Western leaders to argue the need fo r the<br />
Alliance to argue that it needs to be in place so that<br />
free societies can live and breath and create and gb'-about<br />
their business in security.<br />
There are new generations who did not understand, or who were<br />
not part of that earlier history. There are massive peace<br />
movements in Europe who would like to subvert the Alliance and<br />
I have got no doubt at all that,-some part of those movements<br />
are engineered from the Soviet Union. I also have no doubt<br />
that there are well-meaning people within those movements<br />
who want only peace, but who don't understand that you will<br />
not secure peace by unilateral disarmament faced with a<br />
country like the Soviet Union. There is need to expl~ ain, there<br />
is a need to argue. It is not good enough-' to say the truths<br />
are so old I have forgotten how to argue them.<br />
The conjunction of these two sets of meetings the economic<br />
meetina~ which will mean so much for the'living standards of<br />
all of us, alongside the strategic meeting are going to<br />
be of vast importance tothe-whole free world. Quite plainly<br />
their outcomes will affect Australia, just as they will affect<br />
other countries / 8 </p>
<p>-8-<br />
We have to speak very often about economic matters because<br />
economic matters have been paramount in people's minds in<br />
recent years. But in the last 6 years of government there<br />
are many other things that have concerned the Government.<br />
There are many other achievements that we as Liberals need<br />
to remember and to proclaim.<br />
In world affairs within the Commonwealth we fought for<br />
justice against racism, for the rights of ordinary people.<br />
We have co-operated, and sometimes have been a catalyst,<br />
in peacekeeping arrangements and what has happened in<br />
relation to the Sinai is an example of that.<br />
We have accepted an obligation to improve and enhance Australia's<br />
defence capability. How the media can suggest a 19% increase<br />
in defence spending is a cut in defence spending I fail to<br />
understand. I don't know how a journalist would get on if<br />
they went to their editor and said that 19% increase in<br />
salary you gave me is in fact a cut. I don't think it would<br />
be accepted with great credibility.<br />
Our forces have high capability. There has been a rescheduling<br />
of some major purchases, but the forces have high morale and<br />
great capacity. We have co-operated more with South-East<br />
Asia, with Malaysia, with Singapore, with New Zealand under<br />
the five power defence arrangements; and our co-operation<br />
with the United States is deeper than it has ever been.<br />
We have also done much to protect the environment for future<br />
generations. we don't own this country at this-time to exploit<br />
it; we hold it in trust to maintain it, to improve it, our<br />
future generations.<br />
For migrants, for ethnic communities we have established a<br />
range of unequalled services which perhaps should have been<br />
established 10 or 15 years ago. But it was the Galbally<br />
Report, and this Government, that established those services.<br />
There implementation is under review: the government will have<br />
the review in hand shortly and it will act upon it. It was<br />
we who also established as a world first multicultural<br />
television, which has even won some of its critics to its side<br />
since it started operating.<br />
We have established the Australian Institute of Sport and<br />
with the energy that he always shows.. Michael Hodgman might<br />
even get the next challenge round of the Davis Cup to be<br />
played in Canberra at that Institute. That would enable<br />
all Australians to see what we have built in that particular<br />
Institute. It gives opportunities to Australian athletes<br />
to achieve the best training possible in the world and they<br />
will have the opportunity to show how that training pays off<br />
in the Commonwealth Games that will be held, without boycott,<br />
in Brisbane. / 9 </p>
<p>-9-<br />
We have done much to support Australian culture and the arts<br />
the great flag carriers that have taken Australia's name<br />
around the world with pride and with enormous talent. We<br />
also have some of the best medical research teams in the world<br />
that have been backed by sbbstantial increases in funds. We<br />
are supporting centres of excellence in Australian universities.<br />
We have established imaginative programs to assist young people<br />
move from the difficult period of school to work. We have<br />
been supporting excellence, we have been supporting Australians<br />
in their desire and will to achieve throughout the last six<br />
or seven years. We have done much in legal reform: the<br />
Ombudsman; the Human Rights Commission; the changes in<br />
Administrative Law; Freedom of Information legislation and<br />
there are sound reasons for these things. In the days of<br />
growing, large, encroaching bureaucracies it is important to<br />
make sure that ordinary citizens have adequate access to means<br />
of redress when they believe they have been wronged or not<br />
been able to achieve what is rightfully and properly theirs.<br />
We have also announced we are willing to hold a further<br />
Constitutional Convention if the States are willing to<br />
participate in that.<br />
Ladies and Gentlemen, much has been achieved, but there is a<br />
great deal still to do. There will always be difficulties,<br />
always problems before a government, but I believe that what<br />
we have shown we have been able to do over the last six<br />
years gives us the right to claim that whatever the difficulties<br />
are for Australia in the future, we can handle them and meet<br />
the challenge.<br />
In this Council, there will be a new Platform. I hope you will<br />
endorse our Liberal principles and go out to proclaim them.<br />
There are Liberal strengths never to be forgotten; Liberal<br />
achievements to be voiced abroad. Over some recent weeks,<br />
there may have been a certain amount of euphoria in the Labor<br />
Party; well let them have their moment of euphoria, because<br />
it is all they are ever going to have.<br />
Working together, having faith in ourselves, having faith<br />
and good judgement in our policies, and trusting in the<br />
good judgement of the Australian people, we will never fail<br />
them and they will never fail us.<br />
