    <content><![CDATA[<p>On behalf of the Australian Government, I would like to congratulate Mr David Bartlett on his appointment to the Office of Premier of Tasmania.</p>
<p>Mr Bartlett will become Tasmania's 53rd Premier, and I am confident that he will carry out the duties of this office with the passion and dedication of Premiers Lennon and Bacon before him.</p>
<p>Mr Bartlett is a young, bright and creative person dedicated to innovation, business development and information technology.</p>
<p>I have every confidence David Bartlett will make an outstanding Premier for the state of Tasmania.</p>
<p>Mr Bartlett has a young family and represents a new generation of leadership for Tasmania, with a fresh vision to drive the state forward for many years to come.</p>
<p>I wish David, his wife Larissa and their family, all the very best at this exciting time, serving the people of Tasmania in this most important position.</p>
<p>I look forward to working closely with Premier Bartlett into the future.</p>
