TRAN" SCRIPT OF INTER71:-]-MIC14AEL SCHILDDERGER AND PRIME MINISTER,<br />
RADIO 3L0, 8 15? M, 2 N. OVEMBER 1984<br />
The Costigan findings,<br />
P14 Yes.<br />
MS How quickly do you expect some action will ba taken on'<br />
the recommuiendations?<br />
PM Well they will be taken immnediately by the authorit-is to<br />
whom the full report has been passed. That is the National Cl-iu-z<br />
Authority, the director of Public Prosecutions, the Auctralian<br />
Federal Police~, all the relevant. authorities have the matcrial %) nd<br />
have been acting already and will continue to. In the area ok<br />
any executive or legislative action by government you will. aprciat,.<br />
that the covntions operate in this carxetaker period from-tlhe<br />
2Gth Octobor and we can not tksuhaction in that period. Dut<br />
of courac, I have made it clear t hat we expect t! at tho authoritieG<br />
that are relevant in thir. aroa ad %-zose. a dvice gov ,6' Al<br />
to act upon to be working on itz nd to have thuht &amp; dvica' rcady z~ U3z.<br />
The third point I %-; o; ild lieto make hovover is that I have na.' d qu! L'_<br />
cloarl' that ahould tzhe Nat_" o,. al'Crim~ i Authority or the DPP or<br />
thec Fedcral L'o2ic~ e bcve soxn n-atter iwhich go. cs b, yn th poo-<br />

V0, . Cc0ldrc </p>
<p>cont 2 and that is clearly understood. On the 11th October,<br />
at otir ministry mnteti: ng I informed the Ministry of the Conventions<br />
that operated at the time after calling an election and these<br />
bind all Governments. I mean if yie were to start taking act-ions<br />
in other areas the Opposition would be screaming the headlines<br />
that we were breaking theConventions and I don't intend to break<br />
thW;: m. But, having said that, there will be nothing lacking in th. e<br />
way in which we want the AuthoritLes that are in place to act. We<br />
insured that they got all-the information they know our total<br />
commlttment to eradicating organised crime in this country and we:<br />
* will be expecting that as soon as' we have won the election and are<br />
then back in the normal business 6f Covernment that all there<br />
recommendations will be ready for us.<br />
Well thxe Opposition is arguing immediately following the Final<br />
report the tabling of it that thie National Crime Authority does<br />
not have enough. teeth.<br />
well r don't think the Oposition will want to be raising<br />
question of the<br />
their head on thejeostigan commisqion I remind you of what the Leader<br />
of the Opposition and others ware carrying on for weeks and months<br />
before which culmhinated in the bleIck Tuesday the 2nd October fc~ r the<br />
Leader of the Opposition in the HOuse when all the allegations were<br />
Made that this Government was soft on organifned crime. That we had<br />
b~ en trying to close the Royal Cc= ission dow-m. There i3 clearly<br />
a CcZp..' lte. repudiation of all thos;-baseless, m√± achevious allogationa<br />
-t i. n the noport Itself and evc more cpecifically in statezznts by<br />
iczloioncr Cooigan since the releace. og his rv-prt. </p>
<p>MS Prime Mini:; tcr, are there any, name:; in the volumes which<br />
we haven't seen which migfit be of some personal embarrassment to<br />
you or to the Labor Party?<br />
PM Well, I can say no, but 1, having said that, I am not<br />
going to canvass the confidenitial volumnes for the obvious reason~ s<br />
why they are confidential, for two very good reasons. That is<br />
th;-t existing investigations or potential investigations should riot<br />
be in any way prejudiced.<br />
MS Mm~ I asked the question o'bviously because that is what Andrew<br />
Peacock was hoping would be revealed in the Costigan Report.<br />
PM *.. Well, he has behaved in a totally objectionable way in -this<br />
matter which is recognised universally, the , you recall the sorts<br />
of things. I will just remrind you of the sorts of things he said on<br />
* the 3rd of October this was followving his black Tuesday in the<br />
Parliament where by universal judgement he was condemned for his<br />
actions in respect of myself. He then, on the next day on an am.<br />
programm~ e said, " the regretable factor is we are going to the election<br />
campaiign winithout Mr Hawke allowing the Australian people to knowv<br />
what is in the Costigan report. ALustralia is entitl. ed to know the<br />
extent to which this sophisticated network of organised crima iEs<br />
taking over ths country. Yiet the Prime minister is not going to<br />
* allow this to occur. T1fiis. man"# and thatis me ' is trying to<br />
* walk away from telling Australiano just-what. the extent of the t. hreat<br />
Vcn ilt vas lies Eram the very beginang from when he decid~ ed<br />
to ezubark upon this taictic of personal ins inuations and allogatLonz<br />
agrinst ius and the Government. He knew that he was not telling the<br />
truth an~ d he haa boean revealled ncotg in tho Parliament a~ nd in the<br />
Colian for v-what ha Sz.<br />
I: S V n Jndln a th enqiuiry. Would you prge<br />
00VS </p>
<p>con 4<br />
Justice Murphy to stand aside for the time being?<br />
No, it is quite improper for you to be no I don't mean<br />
it is improper for you to ask the question but. it is improper for<br />
that sort of issue to be raised. the question of what happens on the<br />
High Court, Michael, is for the High Court. it is a matter for Sir<br />
Harry Gibbs and his judges. It would be a total breach of the basis<br />
under<br />
I.. upon which Government the Westminster system operates for the<br />
Executive Governutmnt to reek to intrude into the judiciary. our<br />
Westminster system is founded on the division of powers between the<br />
Parliament, the Executive and the ' Judiciary. What has to be donet<br />
as far as the Executive level of Government is that the laws as they<br />
stand should operate. That is whaL is happening, the full proceedings<br />
of the Senate Committee are before' the Director of Public Prosecutions<br />
under the Law and the DPP' is investigating that material, he has<br />
indicated to the Attorney General' that that will take some weeks.<br />
That is how it must standi and fortunately I see'that my frieid<br />
Senator Chipp has indicated'that je how that 1O 1e i respect<br />
Chim for-that, of course, thr4 Liberals can't be cornsistient on anything,<br />
on the first day after this thar was a state~ ment saying thnat it<br />
should be as I have put it, it -, hould be left to run-according to<br />
its normial processes and then they thought they could got 30= 3<br />
mileage and they haveo changed their tune..<br />
I-IS Can I quote you the eainlParty leader, Tan Sincla. ir.<br />
Ilt is for the Primo Y'inistez' to take action to Onsura tha<br />
of the High Court is not sulliod because of the failure oZ on,. of V<br />
former colleagues to a~ ccept ti-ha: very carious ZindlAngs agzain.-t hit<br />
= re..<br />
3. 1 </p>
<p>Well here we have the well known gutter tactics of which<br />
the person you are quoting is the acknowledged master. Guilt<br />
by association, my former colleague. This is one thing<br />
that surprises me about these people is that they are such slow<br />
learners. The Australian Public has repudiated this smear,<br />
guilt by association innuendo tactic, and yet they keep going<br />
on with it. The fact is that the Report that has been made is<br />
a report of a Committee of the Senate, one of the Houses of the<br />
Parliament and it is proper that when the Parliament resumes that<br />
that House of the Parliament con~ iders that report. It will do<br />
so and of course the other House of the Parliament will have to<br />
consider the position as well. Currently, the only right and<br />
proper thing to do is that the L~ w be followed and the Law<br />
requires that the Director of Public Prosecutions considers this<br />
material. He is considering it and it is up to the Director of<br />
Public Prosecutions to make a decision as to whether he believes<br />
on the material, that a prosecution is warranted. That's his<br />
function. The reason why the there is a Director of Public<br />
I' Prosecations under the La is to take these matters out of the<br />
area of political decision.<br />
MS Have you spoken recently to Mr Justice Murphy?<br />
PM No<br />
How long since you have?<br />
Pt! I Sinco thin enquIry has oen under way?<br />
P14 I coul3 check tt but it ; is a long time ago * ontha<br />
I<br />
o, </p>
<p>cont 6<br />
1MS.... can we interupt this briofly for a ne~ w service?<br />
PM Ofcourse.<br />
MS PM recall that he was at a social function I am not sure<br />
how long ago, that may have been a couple of months ago too. It wa s<br />
the farewell in Sydney to the Federal Secretary to the Miscellanio-as<br />
Workers Union, Mr Ray Gietzelt, I had no private conversations with<br />
him there. openly in front of hundreds--of people.<br />
the reason for the question, obviously was whether you<br />
had had any discussions about the; matter, which obviously you haven't.<br />
You talked, ' again in passing though about innuendo in relation to this,<br />
but also perhaps I should get back to the Costigan Royal Commiss ion<br />
here and say that of course is what K( erry Packer is saying is<br />
happening to him.<br />
PM 0.0. Yes# well I made the posi'tion of the Government clear at<br />
the press conference yesterday about the view wie have about the<br />
naming of people of not being cha~ rged even in some cases may<br />
not bei charged, and indicated that in principle the Government was<br />
opposed to that but in the circumstances surroundifig this report<br />
there was no alternative but to publish the report in the form theywere.<br />
But I have made our position clear on thiat and I don't tinrthero<br />
is any point in g6Lng any further on it.<br />
I-IS you have any sy-mpath for 1Kerry. Packer?<br />
PH4... I have sympathy for anyo : e according to the basic principlaG<br />
whaich operate in our society and ' fe2 which~ I have understood th~ at<br />
everyone regards as fundamental that people are innocent u. ntil prcvon4<br />
guilty and that they-should be have the protection that goeo Yith<br />
that principla. I ddn' t -t6hink, owovar, having scr5. d that anc </p>
<p>* cont 7<br />
tha't clear that there is, any purpose or public interest served i~ n<br />
me proceeding any further into what is essentially now a disputation<br />
between Commissioner Costigan, I ' guess, and Mr Packer.<br />
MS Have you talked in recent times to Ke~ rry Packer?<br />
No<br />
MS How long since you have?,<br />
I think again the last time I would-. have seen Kerry Packer<br />
was in the viewing I think of millions of people, I think it was<br />
the occasion when the Bulletin and the Newsweek married as it were,<br />
nestled in together and there was; a public launching of that event<br />
* in Sydney. I was sitting at the pam~ e table, I think at a conservative<br />
estimate 2 or 3 million people would have seen it.<br />
14S Prime Minister, TAX What form exactly will the major<br />
* review that you have undertaken tip carry out, what form will that<br />
take? Pm twell, the matter will beconsidered by EPAC. the Ecn-nomic<br />
Planning Advisory Council. That's the forumiwhich as you know<br />
Michael was established after the:: suxmmit last year, which was lihe<br />
a m~ ini-sumfmit on a statutory basi, the business cowunityv.: Iarcja<br />
and smnall, the trade unions: the farmers the States, Local Governments<br />
and community organisBations in the form of ACOS and consinmr<br />
organisations were all there repro sented... w. have comiueaccd the<br />
ftom last year adthrou-h thi. s yca dicsso abu az<br />
a~ fter the election we vill meet a*, tin in EPAC and will p~.-Ic u,<br />
discussion there as to how they wiould best see the eflla-eme~ nt of<br />
ti debato out into tho coiitunity.: I will be vary utn cj<br />
Tzided by &amp; 11 ' thone comvnity orgV~ nicaiono who X m~ ight eny ! 2v<br />
cz* ch o2 on bahalf cO the o COLTuU&amp; ty that they c </p>
<p>cont.... put in written submissionzs, ptreliminiary writton submissions to<br />
EPAC as to how they see cesirabic chanc'es occurring.<br />
MS You are not thinking of appointing someone in particular<br />
to conduct an enquir-.<br />
PM -No.<br />
MS The Summit<br />
PM The important thinq is the community, we have got to get<br />
the views of the community through their organisations.<br />
MS So the summit therefore, is to be part of the Review.<br />
PM I t will be a culmination. What we will do is through<br />
the EPAC processes we will build up through their and through<br />
other consultations a " white paper" which will bring together<br />
very substantially the view that have been put to government and<br />
that will contain as I see it certain packages which would represent<br />
a distilling of the view of the community as to how they see a twc<br />
system which would be fare, simple and equitable and we would have<br />
the summit ~ or whatever you call it Summit or National Conference,<br />
the word is not important, I think Summit has become well knotm now<br />
but then at that gathering of the people, they would have the<br />
( opportunity of examinhi~ g this " wyhite paper" and I believe that out<br />
of this process will then get what has never been done bafore in<br />
this country a substantiral degree of consensus on What, is the fairest<br />
moot effiecient form of tax system.<br />
You tal] z of consensus, but isn't it faro to say that thet AMU3<br />
will hava the biggest iput?<br />
PH4 N.. lo not only is it not fa~ re, but it is erroneous. The Pos; ition<br />
o f the ZkC'rU io important in thics respco-t and in~ Iprtant Oor<br />
overy aingle paroon in the counit. ry that the impact up-on citisenz Cn<br />

<p>* cont 9<br />
so often understood, but ncvc. rthles s very irMportant is the potentially<br />
inflationary impact of a tax. So that it is very much in interests<br />
of all citizens that if for instance -in an overall tax package theria<br />
was a view that there should he a mfove:-to more indirect taxes if<br />
that were the case, then its important that the trade union rovement, who<br />
on behalf of workers will be making claims for wage increases to c&amp; cver<br />
price increases have an acceptance'of the inner relationship between<br />
that tax change and what they will do in wage claims. Because if<br />
you don't have an acceptance by thbse representatives of the workers<br />
who are going to determine the level of tAage claims about how that<br />
tax should be taken into account the community may suffer from<br />
significant inflationary impact from a decsion in the tax area.<br />
14S Well or the question of this acceptance by' the ACT)<br />
you have the problem with ~&gt; Dolan saying he will not accept<br />
indirect taites in. any form.<br />
PH No, you won't get very far down-thait track. The ACTO IN<br />
a written statement made quite clear uhat there position was and<br />
I b. elieve when you look what the ACT) has done in EPA. C over very<br />
many months now and the discussio~ s that have been held there<br />
including Cliff Dolan and the statement of the officers generally<br />
in the last week or so there will be no problem in being able to<br />
have these dliscussions * with the rAtTU tow'ards the objectiva, to aohie<br />
the objectiv7e I have bzen tallking* about. The P.~ CIU has been verf<br />
very responsiblo in the vperio&amp; oij-ca uwe have been in of f ica in<br />
talking not junt tiith uts but vlth Government arnd on theice icnu~ a.<br />
I cm totally conftdent i.. hat va will ba able to aciiieve. tha obectveo<br />
I. </p>
<p>cont MS Does that mean locking out Cliff Dolan?<br />
PM It doesn't mean locking out Cliff Dolan at all, Cliff<br />
Dolan has been in the discussions.' You ought to understand<br />
that political, economic and social life of this country has never<br />
been and will never be determined by interpretation of one<br />
particular sentence that a man utters at a particular point of time.<br />
MS Are you referring to Cliff. Dolan?<br />
PM Well I am saying that you have" got to take acnenn-of<br />
Cliff's position throughout. Cliff has been on EPAC he has been<br />
a very useful and involved member pf EPAC. I think you will find<br />
that as this thing develops, that Cliff Dolan and all the officers<br />
of the ACTU will be positively, constructively involved in reaching<br />
the objectives I'm talking about.<br />
MS But Cliff Dolan has said that more than once. It's not<br />
just one sentence taken out of context.<br />
PM Well I don't intend to say any more than I have just oaid.<br />
I have the total conviction and I would say the knowledge that a<br />
will not just the government but the whole community, till<br />
have cooperation of the ACTU.<br />
MS Have you talked to Cliff Dolan recently about it?<br />
PM I have tried a couple of times to get Cliff, he wasn't there.<br />
I have spoken to other officers of tho ACTU but I have no concernm<br />
to<br />
about thiso... Cliff is of to Grinova now, the Governing Board of<br />
the ILO you know I know aomethlng about that. He'll ba there for<br />
ocmo tiIE, Z think.<br />
' OUr pleasod about that ate you?<br />
. I<br />
S. o o r </p>
<p>cont 11<br />
PM No, well, I am pleased for Cliff, I know how enjoyable<br />
those meetings are, and constructive.<br />
You are asking the Austral ian people to give you a blank<br />
cheque in regard to tax.<br />
PM No that's absolutely ridiculous.<br />
MS.... Why?<br />
PH Because it's not true and all1 untrue statements are<br />
ridiculous. I-I Well why is that untrue, : you are asking us : to accept....<br />
Did you read the statem~ nt? Perhaps if you read,,,, you<br />
have read the tax statement have you?<br />
KS I have seen t1he report of' that statement<br />
PM I suggest that you read it M~ ichael and you will see tha~ t<br />
M4S Well I know what you are; going to say to me, you are g~ oing<br />

Conservative Goverrnments had been in pcwer there ila6. been no<br />
attempt at a comprehensive atcempt at a review of the taxation<br />
system,<br />
MS.... There are those who would say the Asprey Committee.<br />
PM Yes but was done about it? No I am simply saying<br />
that you have had the Asprey committee Report there are other<br />
people who have been looking at the tax systCem--MatheWS,<br />
but under that period of Conserva tive Governmient as I said in<br />
the Statement what you really had was carrots before elections<br />
and then beating the pecple with sticks after~ wards. So the<br />
blank cheque I am giving is not for myself, X am saying to the<br />
Australian People you through your organisations, through<br />
the Cou ncil of Small Business Organisations or the Chamber of<br />
Commerce, the Confederati-on of Australian industry, the National<br />
F'armers, the Business Council of Australia; the Trade Unions. lets<br />
all together examine the things that need to be done to make this<br />
very complex tas system simpler, ak it fairer and most importantly<br />
. lichael, to ensure that we do what is necessary to'ensure that all<br />
people ob~ y the law, that we absolutely stamp out the tar. avoidance<br />
industry so that all people meet * their obligations, pay Ea:. 1owr<br />
that's not asking for a bla. nk cheque for me. Its the oposite, I'm<br />
saying to the Australian peo~ le its a blank chequ. e to you# I'm<br />
caying its going to be in your hads in a w~ ay itG. nevar bi-on cafra.<br />
Woul . d you ba any bretter of having had tli~ t review beforel<br />

<p>cont 13<br />
is that this process has been going on 4nd in the public minutes of<br />
EPAC Of March of this year we point out. there that this is a long<br />
process, we started it then its got to go on through and after the<br />
election. and that is where all the people were represented. I<br />
the<br />
mean EPAC . Is a mini-summit. It had whole spectrum of the<br />
community represented and their spokespersons there said, this muE. t<br />
go on and what is happening now is therefore no surprise it is a<br />
continuation of what the people's representatives through EPAC said<br />
hazd to happen.<br />
MS What I am putting to you though, wouldn't you be better off<br />
going into an election campaign by being able to say this we will do<br />
and this we won't do.<br />
that would mecrely be a repetition of the way in which the<br />
Conservatives have handles tax before, They've dreamt-up short<br />
term gimmnicks before an election and said, look, this is what we Vill<br />
do, and this is what vie will do. : Now that if) not the way to handle<br />
it. You have got to have a long and detailed analysis with the<br />
Ccommunity' making inputs into thic' process I am not going to yjive the<br />
Australian people the same sor t of contemptuous treatment that tho<br />
Conservatives had.<br />
Look, tha question I am putting to you is that if you had<br />
bZ 3n a2:) 1 to have<br />
gona for 3 years you Could have hfr1 the review and thcn gone in. 4~<br />
positive que'stiofls<br />

have had the election nowi? if tlis icG a complicated wayp 9: anking<br />

0 It~ 0 </p>
<p>1 Corit<br />
MS No because I know what your answer is to that yoj have given<br />
it to me many times about why you want the election now.<br />
PM.... Yes<br />
M4S ut had you gone longer you would have been able to have<br />
the review arid would have been in a better position.<br />
P M Yes, but that's like saying if you were wearing a different<br />
colour suit, you would look different to the-. way you mean<br />
the facts are that the election niust-. be held now. We have to operate<br />
on that basis. I have openly ope rated in that framework in EPAC<br />
The community throught its representatives have zaid yes we want to<br />
follow this process and after the election we will go on with it.<br />
Its quite silly Michael to q~ ay weil if there had been something else<br />
then something else would have followed differently. The<br />
facts are we have started the taxation review process through EPACD<br />
they have acknowledged that there is an election coming up and then<br />
this should go on after the election. I mean they are the facto of<br />
life. Its quite silly to say well if you had been there, for thre<br />
years something else would have been different. Of course it wouald<br />
MS Prime KOinister, will you'be making any other more specific<br />
prom~ isea in your policy speech? in other words any othar cuprises<br />
to come in any area?<br />
PM Oh. there won't be any other new-co~ tittments Michael, : cauce<br />
what the wiat the ' hasic promise that vni'll ba giving tho IAnctrallan<br />
poople is that U73llcoflt. lnue# no only tha policy but the pxocezz oL<br />

<p>cbnt.. an~ d the people have done that. lie are goingj to continue on in<br />
that way to translate these changes that have dramatically<br />
the p-c riod of government to ensure that those changes go on in to<br />
a long term basis to give sustained long t-er-m noninflationary<br />
growth. Thata what the people want thats whay they apprecAte the<br />
Government. There will however, be some new specifics, but not<br />
a large number.<br />
M~ S Just another couple of questions. One specifically here<br />
that I would like to ask on unernpioyment&amp;-. You gave -a promise last<br />
time that during 3 year period you would be able to create 500,000<br />
jobs, you are well ahead of target. How about the next three years<br />
will you make a promise in. that regard, because~ not only will you<br />
have to promise the creation of new jobs presumably but also can<br />
you put a figure on reducing unemploynent? Two different things.<br />
PM Yes, but two related things. The 3 promises that I made<br />
in'the last election have been all: kept or more than kept in thiis<br />
area. I said that we would halt the explosion of unemploymient.<br />
That happened from 10.3% it is now down to less than 9 to 8.8%<br />
K secondly that we would start to crzcate new jobs well that has<br />
happened. There is 260,000 new jobs since the sunit againvt the loss<br />
of 200,000 jobs in the pi~ ecediang 1' 2 months. 1. said that in the f irst<br />
3 years j million new jobs we ara ahead~ of that target. Now I. thinkt<br />
that in the at the t. e of th election policy opaech and in tha<br />
parlod of the election w~ e will try' to give some indication just hou,'<br />
that target has been kept.<br />
-S.. VOU are not going to tell ia -now, obviously.<br />
PM 0, bacauaa I had Q targot pcaiad then in m~ ind~ and 2: ron1<br />
targoto ahaz of targe-t icith -Lhatr thats what tho P'nople n~ ? hee'n<br />
t. o Itnoz,. Zt mwij b that -aM bn able to pus that paxiod out </p>
<p>16 cont<br />
and make some more prcdictior-s but they wiLll not be made unless<br />
I am certain of being able to achieve them. I knew in Feb/ March<br />
of ' 83 that we could produce and would produce the objectives that<br />
I put then. Anything that we put to the people during this election<br />
campaign will be achieveable.<br />
MS is this campaign too lcng?<br />
PM No, I don't think so. I know that there were some people<br />
and within my own party who said who said don't announce the<br />
electon, but I made it guite clear that T wanted to get away from<br />
what had happened under the Conservatives where they had'played<br />
around and said :" Oh there might be an election and there might<br />
not be" Now that is silly,. that sort-of thing. Once I had<br />
made up my mind when it was going to De I thought the people were<br />
entitled to know. The second point I would make is this: That let'o<br />
say that I hadn't said it, that it was going to be the 1st of D-aemher<br />
I think that people would still have conducted themselves, they<br />
had a feeling there was going tobe an election..... it was better for<br />
the conimunity and certainly better for the retail community that,<br />
it be certain. Has Andrew Peacock camqigne. d better than expacted*<br />
PM4 No I said to my poople that I thought in the first week or<br />
so that the Opposition unauld have the advantaga. They maere able!<br />
to raico a-* couple of iosues and T Said to r people w3liv<br />
plenty oZ tim~ e about this... on the tax iocuo, 7 caid Va rill hendle<br />
thia In a way which will b-3 accutatoo right and reacaun. flg. U~<br />
1r3 what ba happened and thzcre Ab no doubt ~ Tnat h~ as cZ_-cc nozi, La<br />
tfhat will dclrzte the cloction the total COXICT-Ez ~ mr<br />
LClc= d~ I. o thot ute </p>
<p>17 cont<br />
their stated dolicies the Australian tax payers will Pay very, very<br />
much more tax, very, very much more tax t%-han. they are now.. They<br />
will be worse of f, they carn't ma ke up their mind. They have<br />
Rr Sinclair saying there will be lower . taxes.. Mr Howard saying there<br />
will be more takies and of course Mr Peacock you know he is not<br />
a Ciant in the economic or fiscal area really not saying anything.<br />
So you have the total Opposition, the projected deputy Prime minister<br />
MLr Sinclair, reduce taxes. Projected Treasurer, saying more taxon<br />
and when you look at what they are saying it. is no surprise that you<br />
have this chaos. That chaos is going to become clearer and clearer<br />
and clearer with each passing day. AS we have got it now the<br />
opposition have reveal~ d. to the people of A~ ustralia that they don't<br />
even know amonqst themselves w-. hat the Economic and Fiscal implications<br />
of their statements are. All that you can put is that there must<br />
be an increase in the budget deficit, there must be an increase : l. n<br />
the level ef taxation there must t~ a a significant increase in in! f. lation.<br />
They are the inevitable results of what the Opposition has said s; o<br />
far. With each day between now and the first of December the bar~ renflCss<br />
and the potential disaster of the oppositions Economic statem-<br />
onts are going to becomne clearer: and clearer to the Australian<br />
People. MS 1Will you win more seats?<br />
I thi~ nk so<br />
I-2 Prime Minister tbank you tor joining me. </p>
