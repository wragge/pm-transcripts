    <content><![CDATA[<p>I am pleased to announce a number of changes to the Ministry that I will recommend to the Governor-General.  These changes will further invigorate the Government and demonstrate the depth of talent available to the Coalition.</p>
<p>I record my gratitude to the Hon Dr David Kemp MP, the Hon Daryl Williams AM QC MP and the Hon Chris Gallus MP who have agreed to step down from the Ministry to make way for these appointments.</p>
<p>Senator the Hon Ian Campbell will become Minister for the Environment and Heritage.  Senator the Hon Helen Coonan will become Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts.</p>
<p>  The Hon Mal Brough MP will become Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer and Mr Jim Lloyd MP will become Minister for Local Government, Territories and Roads.  The Hon Fran Bailey MP will become Minister for Employment Services and Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence.</p>
<p>  Ms Teresa Gambaro MP will become Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence and Mr Bruce Billson MP will become Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  Mr Kerry Bartlett MP will become Chief Government Whip.</p>
<p>I take this opportunity to record my appreciation for David Kemp's contribution to Australian politics and the Liberal Party over a long career, spanning academia, chief of staff to Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser, Director of the Victorian Liberal Party and as a Minister in the employment, education and environment portfolios since 1996.</p>
<p>Daryl Williams was a distinguished barrister before entering politics.  He was one of Australia's longest serving Attorneys-General with a deserved reputation for his forensic mind and sense of fairness that he brought to bear on national legal issues.</p>
<p>Chris Gallus MP has been a very effective grass roots campaigner and as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs she specialised in promoting Australia's interests in the Pacific.  </p>
