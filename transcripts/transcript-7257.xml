    <content><![CDATA[<p>9 DECEMBER 1987</p>
<p>The Government welcomes the agreement that has been reached on intermediate range nuclear forces.</p>
<p><br />The agreement is unique in that it provides for the<br />elimination of a complete class of nuclear weapons.<br />It will be crucial to the prospects for future arms control<br />agreements that this agreement can be fully and effectively<br />verified so that the compliance of the two sides, and their<br />good faith, can be unambiguously demonstrated to each other.<br />In this regard I feel the deepest satisfaction at the role<br />Australia will play in helping to verify Soviet compliance<br />with the terms of the agreement through the operations of<br />the joint defence facilities in Australia.</p>
<p><br />As I stated in the Parliament on 6 June 1984, these<br />facilities contribute to verification of arms limitation<br />arrangements between the US and USSR and are also able to<br />provide information about missile launches.</p>
<p><br />As the INF agreement allows the USSR to destroy some of the<br />missiles covered by the agreement by launching them, and<br />also prohibits the USSR from using those launches for<br />developmental or testing purposes, the ability of the US to<br />monitor this activity including through the joint defence<br />facilities in Australia will be fundamental to the successful implementation and continuing operation of the<br />agreement. The process of verifying the INF agreement, including the<br />important verification function of the joint facilities here<br />in Australia, will provide invaluable experience in relation<br />to verification of a START agreement.</p>
<p><br />The Government urges both the US and USSR to build on the<br />precedent established by the INF Treaty arrangemefits in<br />their * other arms control negotiations, especially in respct<br />of strategic nuclear weapons and chemical weapons. 003255</p>
