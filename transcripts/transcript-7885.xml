PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF DOORSTOP, OAKLEIGH MECHANICS' INSTITUTE<br />
HALL, MELBOURNE, 4 FEBRUARY 1990<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, the by-election, not a good<br />
result in Thomastown.<br />
PM: We said before the election that there'd be a pretty<br />
substantial swing. But they, as I think everyone<br />
acknowledges, they'd been state issues. The real issues<br />
of the federal election are the ones I've been talking<br />
about in here. They are the ones that people will be<br />
voting on. The future of Medicare was not an issue out<br />
in Thomastown but it will be in the federal election.<br />
The question of whether people are going to have a<br />
universal and fair health system or put into Government<br />
people who have lied to the Australian electorate now for<br />
months and months saying they had a health policy ready<br />
and now saying they haven't. All they've got is a<br />
promise of a further bill of something like $ 2.6B that<br />
they'll slap upon the Australian people. Those are the<br />
real issues.<br />
JOURNALIST: But it can't help you, Prime Minister?<br />
PM: Do I look terribly upset?<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you have any fears that the swing will<br />
extend to federally?<br />
PM: No. The answer I've given answers that.<br />
JOURNALIST: Is Mr Hewson looking good as Opposition<br />
Leader?<br />
PM: Well the hurdy gurdy goes on and on, doesn't it.<br />
The hurdy gurdy goes on and on.<br />
JOURNALIST: In the debate against Mr Peacock how do you<br />
think you'll go?<br />
PM: All I've said is at a press conference the other day<br />
" will it be Mr Peacock?"<br />
