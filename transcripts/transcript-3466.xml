PRESS RELEASE<br />
The Prime Minister today continued his campaigning<br />
for State Labor Leader Perc Tucker.<br />
In a crowded schedule, Mr Whitlam attended a Greek<br />
Orthodox Church Service and addressed a gathering at the Greek<br />
Community Centre in South Brisbane. He stressed the Australian<br />
Government's concern at the Cyprus situation, and outlined the<br />
financial and welfare assistance already given by his Government.<br />
Advance Australia Fair signalled his arrival at a<br />
crowded luncheon at the New Melbourne Hotel.<br />
Mr Whitlam reminded the audience of his longstanding<br />
association with Queensland.<br />
" In my concern and affection for Queensland, in my<br />
knowledge of your State and my long-standing association with<br />
it, I yield to no-one, not even Mr Bjelke-Petersen and Sir<br />
Gordon Chalk," he said.<br />
" I came here with no grudge against your Premier,<br />
and for all our disagreements, I bear no lasting animosity<br />
towards his government. I have done my best to work with him<br />
for the good of this State. If I point to failings in his<br />
government's performance I know you will understand I have no<br />
desire to bucket Queensland or its citizens," Mr Whitlam added.<br />
However, he criticised the Premier for not helping<br />
in the fight against inflation.<br />
" As the leader of the national government, I accept<br />
responsibility for the economic management of this country,"<br />
the Prime Minister stated.<br />
" I don't shuffle off that responsibility to Mr Bjelke-<br />
Petersen. At the same time he cannot shuffle off his own<br />
responsibilities to me.<br />
" My own government has used every weapon at its<br />
disposal, every constitutional power it possesses, in the<br />
battle against inflation and unemployment. We will not let<br />
up in that battle.<br />
" Mr Bjelke-Petersen has done nothing. He campaigned<br />
against our referendum to seek greater powers in the fight<br />
against inflation. He refuses to use the powers he already<br />
possesses," Mr Whitlam said.<br />
" If the Queensland Government co-operated with us in<br />
setting up a land commission as the three Liberal States are<br />
doing, we could reduce the price of land for the home buyer.<br />
" If the Queensland Government allowed Australian<br />
National Line ships to operate between Queensland ports it<br />
could cut shipping freights. </p>
<p>2<br />
" If he co-operated with our plan to reduce electricity<br />
costs in Queensland we could check price rises over a vast<br />
range of goods," Mr lhitlam said.<br />
Queensland's housing policy was a disgrace.<br />
" They have done less than anyone for the people most<br />
in need of housing and even less than Labor did in Queensland<br />
in its last year of office 1956-57. That year Labor built<br />
1900 housing commission homes. Last year Mr Bjelke-Petersen<br />
built only 1400 homes and had almost $ 12 million left over<br />
in unspent housing funds from Canberra, despite a 40% population<br />
increase since Labor was last in office in Queensland."<br />
The Prime Minister concluded his address by pointing<br />
out that Queenslanders received a larger slice of the national<br />
expenditure cake than any other Australians.<br />
Queensland had received $ 739 million last financial<br />
year from the Australian Government. This represented 3382.00<br />
per head of population, compared with $ 343.00 per head average<br />
in the other States.<br />
Mr Whitlam attended a function at Redland Bay Hotel<br />
before driving to Surfers Paradise where he has a press conference<br />
tomorrow morning.<br />
