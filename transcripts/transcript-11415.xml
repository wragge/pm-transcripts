<p>Well, thank you very much, Thorry; to Richard Court, the Premier of</p>
<p> Western Australia, Kate Carnell, the Chief Minister of the Australian</p>
<p> Capital Territory, my many Ministerial and Parliamentary colleagues.</p>
<p> And can I also particularly welcome the presence here of my old friend,</p>
<p> Sir Robert Cotton, who was the President of the Liberal Party in the</p>
<p> New South Wales Division when I joined the Party in the late 1950s.</p>
<p> He's a former senior Federal Minister and, of course, Ambassador</p>
<p> to the United States and a member of the Board of the Reserve Bank</p>
<p> and a man who has made an enormous contribution to this country.</p>
<p>Thank you very much, Thorry, for your very kind words of welcome.</p>
<p> I noted with great interest your endorsement of the Minister. I mean,</p>
<p> I now expect when I go to a breakfast and Peter Reith is present some</p>
<p> of the leadership of the trade union movement with thank me for him.</p>
<p> And if somebody from the National Taxpayers is present, somebody will</p>
<p> thank me for Peter Costello well. But, anyway, it's a mark, I</p>
<p> think, of the attempts that Ministers have made to get close to industries</p>
<p> that are important to the future of this country that you should say</p>
<p> that. And can I start my remarks as well as thanking you most warmly</p>
<p> for sponsoring this breakfast.</p>
<p>To repeat, in very unambiguous terms, our strong commitment to your</p>
<p> industry that we do believe you can have a sensible balance between</p>
<p> caring for the environment and protecting jobs in regional Australia.</p>
<p> This idea that somebody's got to lose and somebody's got</p>
<p> to win is wrong. You can get a win-win outcome. We remain very committed</p>
<p> to the Regional Forest Agreement legislation. It will be reintroduced</p>
<p> into the Senate Â– well, it's in there, it will be listed</p>
<p> for debate immediately we go back and we will continue to press very</p>
<p> strongly for its passage, and we believe that will occur. And other</p>
<p> issues that you've raised with me this morning, Mr President,</p>
<p> I'll be very, very happy to pursue.</p>
<p>Yesterday, when I was doing an interview with Neil Mitchell on 3AW</p>
<p> in Melbourne, apropos of something that is being debated at the present</p>
<p> time I made the observation that over the last couple of years there</p>
<p> was probably no political/economic issue that was more heavily debated</p>
<p> or more important and relevant to political debate in this country</p>
<p> than the impact of globalisation on regional communities. The reality</p>
<p> is that we are part of a global economy. We can't avoid that.</p>
<p> We can't get off it. The die was cast several decades ago and</p>
<p> the processes are irreversible. And anybody who runs around Australia</p>
<p> saying that somehow or other we can turn the clock back and somehow</p>
<p> or other we can avoid the implications of globalisation is deluding</p>
<p> themselves and also the people they talk to. But the impact of that</p>
<p> globalisation has to be managed. And your industry is a very important</p>
<p> part of that because it does provide hope and relief to many people</p>
<p> in regional communities. And it's not much good standing on a</p>
<p> truck or a soap box in regional Australia and talking about the glories</p>
<p> of globalisation unless you can translate that into jobs and you can</p>
<p> translate that into hope and inspiration for the people who live in</p>
<p> those communities. So, we're very conscious of the importance</p>
<p> of your industry to that and for the jobs that you provide.</p>
<p>On Monday, ladies and gentlemen, I'll be going on an official</p>
<p> visit to our two, I guess, most important economic partners still</p>
<p> and that is Japan and the United States. And during those visits,</p>
<p> over a period of two weeks, I'll have the opportunity of talking</p>
<p> naturally to the Japanese Prime Minister, Mr Obuchi and President</p>
<p> Clinton, as well as senior people in the American Administration and</p>
<p> the Japanese Government. And it is, that visit, very much about moving</p>
<p> on to the next step of entrenching Australia's strong economic</p>
<p> position in a world which has grown in its respect for the capacity</p>
<p> of this country to successfully manage its domestic economic affairs</p>
<p> and to strongly project itself as a significant middle economic power,</p>
<p> punching well above its weight not only in the region but also around</p>
<p> the world. And one of the things that we must as a country do increasingly</p>
<p> is to concentrate on our areas of strength internationally. And one</p>
<p> of the areas that I want to concentrate on when I'm away is building</p>
<p> the attraction of this country as a world financial centre.</p>
<p>One of the things that's come through very clearly over the last</p>
<p> few years to me is that some of the things for which we were just</p>
<p> about to be criticised by the rest of the world and even by some in</p>
<p> Australia for being rather too stodgy and too conservative are now</p>
<p> seen as some of the great strengths that this country has. Because</p>
<p> what the Asian economic downturn demonstrated was that countries that</p>
<p> had well regulated and transparent banking systems, countries that</p>
<p> had sophisticated, well developed corporate laws, countries that had</p>
<p> a very stable political system, countries that had a very free and</p>
<p> open and tolerant society, they are increasingly the countries that</p>
<p> have done well and survived. And those that haven't have been</p>
<p> a lot less successful.</p>
<p>And when you look at Australia now one of the things that make it</p>
<p> particularly attractive to the rest of the world, of course it has</p>
<p> an unenviable lifestyle and it doesn't matter virtually where</p>
<p> you live, you can pick any one of a number of locations in Australia</p>
<p> and it really does have an unenviable lifestyle, but it has a strong,</p>
<p> stable political system. It, of course, has a very strong economy</p>
<p> but it has a very well developed banking system and it's prudentially</p>
<p> supervised, it's well regulated and people depend on it and they</p>
<p> believe in it. And we don't have what was witnessed in other</p>
<p> parts of the world - we don't have the banking system being used</p>
<p> as a de facto arm of government to look after, in some cases, unfortunately</p>
<p> the friends of that government. We have a financial system that is</p>
<p> strong and stable and at arms length. We have a strong regulatory</p>
<p> and corporate code. And, of course, importantly, as far as the world</p>
<p> of commerce and business is concerned, we speak the English language.</p>
<p> And I don't say that in a trite fashion, but it is very important.</p>
<p> So when you put all of those things together, this is a very attractive</p>
<p> place in which to do business. But that's not enough. You have</p>
<p> to go a bit further. You have to make certain that we have a competitive</p>
<p> economy and particularly we have a competitive financial system and</p>
<p> we have a competitive taxation system.</p>
<p>And last week we really put the last of those building blocks into</p>
<p> place as far as the generality of our taxation system is concerned</p>
<p> through the passage of the Goods and Services Tax legislation. And</p>
<p> we now go on to the next item of business and that is the item of</p>
<p> business taxation reform. And if we do that properly that will be</p>
<p> another reason why Australia should be a world financial centre. It'll</p>
<p> be another reason why there can't be a city in Australia that</p>
<p> doesn't rival and in time surpass Tokyo as being a world financial</p>
<p> centre because the time placement of Australia is ideal for it to</p>
<p> grow in importance as a world financial centre. And if we make certain</p>
<p> that our tax system is competitive, if we make it tax-wise a neutral</p>
<p> choice between investing in the United States and investing in this</p>
<p> country so that other factors come into play for example, then we</p>
<p> have a real prospect of achieving that goal and achieving that dream.</p>
<p> And this is the right time to be taking the decisions that will promote</p>
<p> our prospects as a world financial centre because we are, to use that</p>
<p> jargon, seen by many as the flavour of the month as far as economic</p>
<p> performance is concerned. We've done better than anybody expected.</p>
<p> I guess better than most in this room expected. It certainly surpassed</p>
<p> my more optimistic expectations.</p>
<p>And there is a realisation that because we stared down that Asian</p>
<p> economic downturn that we have a prospect of really ratcheting up</p>
<p> our economic performance just that much more than we ever thought</p>
<p> was possible. But we don't have unlimited time to do that and</p>
<p> we won't be forgiven if we drop the ball on important further</p>
<p> reforms and that is why the GST Legislation was so important. Sure</p>
<p> it wasn't everything everybody wanted but it was the great bulk</p>
<p> of what everybody wanted and it still represents the greatest single</p>
<p> economic reform in a particular area that this country has seen since</p>
<p> the end of World War II. And it will have a lasting impact. It will</p>
<p> make us more competitive. And if we can make certain in our taxation</p>
<p> reforms in the business area we can give ourselves a more competitive</p>
<p> tax system internationally. If we can remove some of the imperfections</p>
<p> in the capital gains tax area, particularly in relation to impact</p>
<p> on venture capital, then we'll be striking very important further</p>
<p> blows towards enhancing this country's reputation.</p>
<p>There's only one other thing that I want to say and that is something</p>
<p> very directly related to the interface of the Liberal Party with the</p>
<p> business community of Australia. There are many people here representing</p>
<p> business organisations and representing individual companies. I'm</p>
<p> very glad that so many of you have come to this Federal Council. This</p>
<p> is the first Federal Council Meeting that has been held in Canberra</p>
<p> since we were returned to government in 1996. And it's very,</p>
<p> very nice to be back in the beautiful winter of Canberra for a Federal</p>
<p> Council Meeting. I reflect on all those cold, wintry meetings we had</p>
<p> when we were in Opposition and they seemed to stretch endlessly into</p>
<p> almost political infinity at various times and we've now, of</p>
<p> course, happily put those years behind us. And we value the links</p>
<p> we have with the business community. We're not owned by the business</p>
<p> community. We're not owned by any section of Australian society.</p>
<p> And one of the proudest things I could say on the 2nd of</p>
<p> March 1996 when we claimed victory is that we didn't represent</p>
<p> one section of the Australian community, we sought to represent the</p>
<p> entire Australian community. But having said that, we value very much</p>
<p> the private enterprise business ethic. It's very important. We</p>
<p> believe in business. We believe in a pro-active investment climate.</p>
<p> We believe in the profit motive, it's honourable. We believe</p>
<p> that business is the foundation of jobs growth and employment. And</p>
<p> we believe in following policies that attract rather than discourage</p>
<p> business investment.</p>
<p>We don't have the nave belief of many of our political opponents</p>
<p> that wealth will somehow always be there. That you'll always,</p>
<p> somehow or other, be able to find it to fund the various things we</p>
<p> want to do in a humane society. So we do regard it as very, very important</p>
<p> to have your understanding. We agree most of the time, not all of</p>
<p> the time, but on every occasion, on every issue, we're very happy</p>
<p> to listen to what you have to say. We enjoy very much your support</p>
<p> and understanding. I thank you most particularly, Thorry, for your</p>
<p> association's sponsorship of this morning's breakfast. It's</p>
<p> a delight to be with you all and I hope you enjoy the rest of the</p>
<p> Council. Thank you.</p>
