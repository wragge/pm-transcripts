JEMBARGO: CHECK AGAIN4ST DELI VERY<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTE-R,<br />
THE RT. HON. HAROLD HOLT IN4 THE<br />
HOUSE CF REPRESENTATIVES<br />
24RD OCTOBER, 1967<br />
CO-,' STING OF V. I. P. FLIGHTS<br />
The House will recall that when making a statement recently<br />
on the V. I. P. flight, I said I would examine the feasibility of some realistic<br />
dissection of costs so that more information could be given to the Parlianentl<br />
and I eXiTessed the view that the Treasury would be the most appropriate<br />
body wihi the necessary expertise and objectivity to conduct such an<br />
examination. I immediately followed this assurance given to the House by<br />
asking my colleagues, the Minister for' Air and the Acting Treasurer, to<br />
have examined the possibility of establishing a realistic basis for the<br />
assessment of costs attributable to V. 1. P. flights and the financial policy<br />
implications of the recovery of such costs by the Department of A ir from<br />
other Depe,-rtments. In the light of the Treasury examination I now make the following<br />
comment. In doing so, I remind Honourable Members that No. 34 Squadron<br />
is an integral part of the R. F. and must be there in time of war to<br />
provide transport and communications services. Currently the flights made<br />
are mainly for the purpose of V. I. P. transport, for training, for air tests,<br />
for ferrying, and for Squadron support. But in a time of emergency, there<br />
would be both a national and a defence requirement for fast, secure and<br />
independent transport and communication, for example, for the carriage<br />
of serv ice-chiefs, for other direct service purposes and for the carriage<br />
of persons directly connected with the defence side of Government. This,<br />
of course, carries with it the need for air crew trained for these services.<br />
I t has been regarded as the function of the Air Force to provide and conduct<br />
this Squadron. Its operations clearly would, in an emergency, be integrated<br />
with other R. A. A. F. tra-nsport arrangements.<br />
In other words, No. 34 Squadron has, prospectively, a full<br />
defence role in dir ect terms and in other ways directly related to the<br />
national defence effort. Having re-gard to this, the capital costs of the<br />
Squadron and certain other charges may be considered pyroperly attributable<br />
to defence appropriations. This is not to deny that V. I. P. transport<br />
requirements have not been allowed for in the re-equipment programme<br />
or that certain f itting out with V. I. P. transport purposes in mind has taken<br />
place. But neither is it to deny the defence support capability. Accordingly,<br />
the Treasury, in its findings, has based its calculations for the costing of<br />
V. 1. P. flights on an extra cost basis.<br />
The Treasury has agreed, with the Department of Air, that<br />
these costs comprise aircraft flying costs, aircraft handling at civil airports<br />
and catering. The aircraft flying costs in turn comprise fuel and oil, tyres,<br />
o xygen, spares and servicing by controctors. / 2 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
This basis means that certain items are eliminated from the<br />
costing on the ground that they would be incurred in any event that is to<br />
say, as a consequence of defence policy provision against a time of<br />
emergency. These items include amortization and interest on the cost of<br />
capital facilities, including aircraft, the pay and allowances and upkeep<br />
of crews and other Squadron personnel, and support provided by Base<br />
Squadron Fairbairn and other R. A. A. F. formations.<br />
On this basis, the Treasury has been able to indicate the cost<br />
of V. I. P. flights for the year 1967/ 68 that is the current financial year.<br />
Its estimate is an amount of approximately $ 45C, CO.. The actual amount<br />
could be somewhat higher this year and will certainly be higher next year<br />
when the more modern aircraft are fully in operation. On the other hand,<br />
there will be gains in efficiency and considerable saving of time in the air<br />
on many flights for Ministers, their staffs and other users. The 1967/ 68<br />
estimate provides for travel by senior service officers to be regarded as<br />
a proper charge to the defence appropriations and not to V. I. P. flights.<br />
Travel by the Defence and Service Ministers, however, is in this<br />
calculation being attributed to V. I. P. flights even though their travel is<br />
in part directly associated with defence and service assignments.<br />
I now move to the question of charging out of costs.<br />
As a general rule, it is not the policy for one Department to<br />
recover from another Department costs of carrying out functions for which<br />
it is responsible except in respect of services provided to or by business<br />
undertakings such as the Postmaster-General. This rule has, I understand,<br />
the general support of the joint Committee of Public Accounts. Treasury<br />
suggests that this policy should be adhered to except in special circumstances.<br />
It goes on to say, however, that if recovery is to be made, it would not<br />
think that the costs should be recovered from every Department involved<br />
but rather that they should be met from a separate appropriation item of<br />
the Prime Minister's Department. This strikes me as being both practical<br />
and sensible. My own Department is the most appropriate in view of<br />
certain of its central responsibilities, and also since it is responsible for<br />
costs relating to visits of Government guests from abroad and for the<br />
travel costs of the Governor-General. The Government has decided to<br />
adopt this procedure. These costs therefore will be charged to the Prime<br />
Minister's Department. Payments from the Prime Minister's Departmert<br />
will thereafter be credited to the relevant appropriations of the Department<br />
of Air. This will have the effect of reducing defence expenditure by the<br />
amount of the payments by the Prime Minister's Department. It is proposed<br />
to institute this procedure in 1967/ 68 with funds initially provided to Prime<br />
Minister's Department from Treasurer's advance pending additional estimates.<br />
Except for service purposes any use of V. I. P. aircraft must be<br />
approved by the Governor-General in respect of his own use of them and<br />
that of his staff and myself or the Minister for Air in respect of all other<br />
use. Similarly passengers must be approved within the same group, that<br />
is by the Governor-General for those in aircraft occupied by him and by<br />
myself or the Minister for Air in relation to all other passengers.<br />
A number of questions which have been asked in the Senate are<br />
also being answered today. This information will be available to Members<br />
of the House of Representatives in Hansard. Some of the detail. sought was<br />
so extensive, that it did not seem appropriate to handle it in that way.<br />
Consequently, the details will be tabled in the Senate, and I propose to<br />
table them here together with the questions and answers which relate to<br />
them. / 3 </p>
<p>-3-<br />
Parliament is entitled to facts, if they can be procured, which<br />
will enable Members to-form a judgment as to the purposes served by<br />
the flight and the manner in which it is being conducted. My concern all<br />
along h,-s been to ensure that the Parliament was not given a misleading<br />
picture because of the type and range of questions. This prompted me to<br />
make my first statement to the House which I have now supplemented. I<br />
wish to add some further comments.<br />
I have stressed more than once that responsibility for the<br />
conduct of the V. I. P. flight rests with the Minister for Air and myself.<br />
I hope this has not been overlooked by its critics. I am no more sensitive<br />
to press and public criticism than most public men. After all, I experience<br />
it on most of the seven days each week for fifty-two weeks of the year. I<br />
do not claim to be a modern Gulliver, but usually I manage to shrug these<br />
criticisms off as Gulliver did the darts of the Lilliputians. But there are<br />
some forms of criticism to which I do react quite strongly. These are<br />
criticisms of an unfair kind which undermine the status and authority of<br />
Parliament, and which belittle whether thoughtlessly or cruelly decent,<br />
conscientious men who serve in the Parliament and in the Ministry.<br />
I have flown the best part of 25C, 000 miles since I became<br />
Prime Minister. I do not fly for the fun of it. Some of it is uncomfortable:<br />
most of it is tiring, and altogether it can be quite exhausting. The best<br />
part of any flight for me is the walk out of the plane down the aircraft<br />
steps. But the V. I. P. flight has enabled me to keep many more official<br />
commitments with organisations and people all around Australia. I have<br />
been able to see a great deal more of the three million square miles of<br />
this continent and of the many projects contributing so much to our<br />
development. In the recent week of Parliamentary recess so-called<br />
I was able to keep official commitments in four capitals. No less<br />
importantly, it has enabled me, as it has many of my colleagues, to devote<br />
time more efficiently to the business of Cabinet and Department.<br />
All this has somehow been conjured up by some as something<br />
improper, inappropriate or unreasonable. There are always to be found<br />
those who seize on any opportunity to demean Members of this Parliament.<br />
SThere have been attempts to paint a picture of Australian<br />
Ministers enjoying V. I. P. flight privileges not matched anywhere else<br />
in the world. This, of course, is absurd. I recall being flown in a<br />
British Government aircraft from Northern Ireland to London fifteen<br />
years ago. When I attended the Finance Ministers meeting at Accra in<br />
Ghana in 1963, my opposite number from Canada arrived in a four-engined<br />
aircraft provided by his Government. During my years as Treasurer, I<br />
was flown by the then Secretary of the United States Treasury, Mr. Douglas<br />
Dillon, in the four-engined aircraft provided for his official use. In my<br />
travels as Prime Minister I have been provided with this courtesy several<br />
times. This has become a matter of course in many other countries. My<br />
colleague, the Minister for External Affairs, has told me that Mr. Paul<br />
Martin, his opposite number in Canada, wishing to speak to him in Ottawa,<br />
sent a jet star aircraft to collect him, and arranged for him to be returned<br />
by the same aircraft after talks had concluded.<br />
As I have said previously, the V. I. P. flight is an adjunct of<br />
modern, efficient Government. Nobody questions the use by the Department<br />
of Civil Aviation of its fleet of seventeen aircraft. The V. I. P. flight<br />
consisted of nine aircraft in 19C5. It is still a flight of nine aircraft. / 4 </p>
<p>-4AV-.<br />
hen replacements were decided upon in 19165, we acted on the best<br />
technic~ 1 service advice available to us to get aircraft as nearly comparable<br />
as could be obtained to thcse which had become obsolescent and to serve<br />
the same purposes that is acan adjunct of modern Government. This<br />
fact seems to have been overlooked by those Senators who question my<br />
use of these aircraft in an election campaign. The business of the Australian<br />
Government does not cease because an election is proceeding. The alrcraft<br />
is a flying office in which my staff and I carry on our work as best we can.<br />
It assists me to return to my Department the more speedily even while an<br />
election campaign is in progress. I am sure that most A--ustralians will see<br />
the uses of the flight sensibly in their proper setting, if the facts are not<br />
distorted for them. </p>
