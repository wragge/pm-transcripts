<p>PRIME MINISTER SIMITIS:</p>
<p>The Australian Prime Minister and I had a very friendly discussion on issues related to our two countries. Australia and Greece have bonds of very close links which are not only historic - a number of young Australians fought by our side here in Greece against Nazism. They have lost their lives in the Battle of Crete and they have fought for our freedom. But over and above these historic bonds, we have social and human bonds. In Australia, a community of 600,000 people – Australians of Greek origin – live, prosper and contribute to the growth of Australia. Therefore we are very happy for this bridge, human live bridge, that exists between our country and Australia. A bridge that offers great opportunities to our country. One of the important issues discussed between us was the European Union, the developments there, the Common Agricultural Policy, and the forthcoming negotiations. The Common Agricultural Policy is a policy that protects agricultural production, farm production. It is of interest to us but at the same time it is a policy that may cause problems to other countries such as Australia. Therefore in the forthcoming negotiations, we should strive to balance the interests of the community farmers with those of farmers from other countries who would like to take part in the trade relations or countries that would like to be present in the European market. Our bilateral economic relations are very good but there is potential for growth. There is… I believe that the Chambers of Commerce and Industry, especially the Greek one, should familiarise the businessmen, Greek and Australian businessmen, with a market. Then we will achieve our potential. Australia will support the Greek candidature for the Security Council in 2005. Mr Howard, the Australian policy and the people of Australia are behind Greece in the issue of the return of the Parthenon marbles. We share a number of views on global issues such as combating terrorism. Australia agrees with our own position in relation to the Cyprus issue. A position that demands respect of UN resolutions. I touched upon the issues of the Balkans, of the situation in the Middle East and our relations with Turkey. There are a number of issues that are of interest to Australia, things that can be dealt with during our Presidency. Fighting illegal migration for instance. During our Presidency in Greece, as we have already stated we';ll take an initiative to promote a view shared within the European Union, an initiative to promote our relations with countries, Asian countries and Australia. This visit is a confirmation of our very good relations, of the friendship between our two countries and our will to widen our friendship and our relations.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER HOWARD:</p>
<p>Well thank you very much Prime Minister. May I say that it is a real delight to be in Greece for the first time as Prime Minister. I first visited your country back in 1964 and have been here on a number of occasions between then and now, but this is the first Prime Ministerial visit. The links between our countries are very close. Most importantly the people to people links are immense. The contribution that Australians of Greek heritage have made to the development of modern Australia has been quite incalculable and has touched every aspect of Australian life – business, politics, the professions, sport. Wherever you go, you find Australians of Greek heritage making an enormous and very beneficial contribution. I thank you for your references to the contribution that Australians made in World War II in fighting side by side with the people of Greece, and I will have an opportunity on the weekend to visit Crete and to personally honour the contribution made by so many in that very tragic battle in 1941. We';ve had a very wide-ranging discussion. We have just witnessed the signing of an agreement to enhance mutual assistance in relation to criminal investigations and that will be of particular benefit to the police forces and the justice authorities of both our countries. We';ve also agreed to accelerate work on achieving a social security agreement between Australia and Greece. This has been around for too long and both of us have agreed to put additional political effort into it and I';m going to especially assign the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Family and Community Services in Australia, Mr Ross Cameron, to see if over the next few months he can';t bring this matter to a head and get it resolved because there is no reason in my view why we shouldn';t have such an agreement, particularly for a country that has provided over the years so many Australian citizens. And I';m hopeful that we can bring that matter to fairly speedy and satisfactory resolution. Can I also say that I was very pleased to receive a written assurance from the Prime Minister in relation to the capacity of Australian companies to bid for future work concerning the Athens Olympic Games in 2004. There have been some difficulties in this area in the past and in relation to the Games, those difficulties have been removed. May I say Prime Minister that our discussion covered not only matters of particular relevance to Australia and Greece, but also the gamut of European and world affairs. And I was particularly interested in your assessment of the situation in the Balkan countries. We continue to share your concern to bring about an ultimately fair resolution of the very difficult situation in Cyprus. Australia continues to be a friend of court, a willing participant in trying to bring about a happy resolution to that very difficult issue. So can I say again that it is a real delight to be Athens. It';s a wonderfully close friendship between our two countries. We admire the contribution through the centuries of the people of this wonderful country to the development of modern civilisation. We appreciate the contribution of Greeks to the building of the modern Australia and we rejoice in the opportunity of expressing at the highest levels of Government the closeness in the relationship between the peoples of our two societies. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister Howard, we';ve been informed that your visit to Piraeus today was cancelled due to security concerns [inaudible]</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER HOWARD: </p>
<p>Well I never talk about security matters. I was given some advice and I took it.</p>
<p> JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr Simitis, according to media reports today, you were briefed on the breakthrough in the investigation against the November 17 group following a series of explosions in Piraeus. Can you tell us anything about those briefings?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER SIMITIS:</p>
<p>I made a declaration and I said in this declaration that the searches are proceeding but we must be very careful about giving information because they are not completed and the Greek police have done a very good job. But we must see the primary results and then we made declarations, give necessary informations. It';s too early. As you know there was a terrorist activity for nearly 30 years in Greece. I hope that we will bring this terrorist activity to an end. But this means that we must be very serious in the way we are handling these matters.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Do you see this group, ‘November 17';, as any threat to the Olympic Games?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER SIMITIS:</p>
<p>In no case. In no case. It could not and it will not. And the Olympic Games will be very secure games. There is no threat at all.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER HOWARD:</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>[ends]</p>
