TRAIA<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 22 FEBRUARY 1991<br />
Australia welcomes the statement of the Soviet spokesman<br />
that Iraq could be prepared to undertake a full and<br />
unconditional withdrawal from Kuwait.<br />
The Soviet statement leaves significant uncertainties about<br />
the timing and mechanics of a cease-fire, arrangements to<br />
monitor Iraqi withdrawal, and whether all aspects of the<br />
proposal would conform fully to UN resolutions.<br />
We note that work to refine the proposals continues between<br />
the Soviet Union and Iraq.<br />
And we note that a UN Security Council meeting to consider<br />
the Soviet proposal is expected soon.<br />
We hope that agreement can be reached on arrangements under<br />
which Iraq will withdraw from Kuwait in full compliance with<br />
UN resolutions. </p>
