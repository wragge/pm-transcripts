STATEMENT TO PARLIAMENT ON THE STAGING OF B-52s THROUGH<br />
AUSTRALIA FOR SEA SURVEILLANCE IN THE INDIAN OCEAN AND<br />
FOR NAVIGATION TRAINING<br />
Honourable Members will recall that negotiations on the staging<br />
of B-52s through Australia were temporarily suspended to allow<br />
tchne newe Administration of President Reagan time to examine and<br />
consider the matter.<br />
I am pleased to inform the House that in the course of his<br />
recent talks in Washington with Secretary of State, Alexander Haig,<br />
the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Tony Street, took this matter<br />
further and was able to bring it to a successful conclusion.<br />
I should lik: e to pay tribute to the Minister for his handling<br />
of this iÃ± p: rtant issue.<br />
Agreeme--. s now been reached between our two Governments on<br />
the terr.-= n conditions which will govern. US Air Force B-52<br />
staging-: 7lign-s through Darwin.<br />
I am t-hing the texts of the Notes exchanged between the<br />
Depart-e.-of Foreign Affairs and the United States Embassy on<br />
11 March 13.1, which constitute this agreement. As Honourable<br />
Members wili note, the agreement provides that:<br />
the B-52 flights shall be for sea surveillance in<br />
Sthe Indian-Ocean area and for navigation training<br />
the agreement of the Australian Government would need<br />
to be obtained before the facilities at RAAF Base,<br />
Darwin could be used in support of any other category<br />
of operations<br />
the B-52 aircraft on surveillance flights will be<br />
supported by KC-135 tanker aircraft for aerial<br />
refuelling and the operations shall consist of periodic<br />
deployments of up to three B-52 and six KC-135 aircraft<br />
Sabout 100 US Air Force personnel and associated<br />
equipment will support the staging operations and some<br />
ofthese may be stationed at RAAF base Darwin<br />
there will be-no change in the status of RAAF base<br />
Darwin as an Australian facility under Australian control.<br />
As the terms of the agreement make abundantly clear,<br />
nothing in the arrangements governing these flights -could<br />
be'regarded as in any way infringing Australian sovereignty<br />
/ 2 </p>
<p>2<br />
the US will provide the Australian Government with<br />
full and timely information about strategic and<br />
operational developments relevatht to the B-52 staging<br />
operations through Darwin.<br />
The House will be aware that US Air Force B-52 airbraft are<br />
currently conducting low-level navigation training over Australia.<br />
As the Minister for Defence stated on 3 February 1980 these<br />
flights originate at Guam, the aircraft carry out navigational.<br />
training over Queensland, and then return to their base-at Guam.<br />
The operations will be an extension of these current operations.<br />
After completing the low-level training exercises, the aircraf&amp; f'<br />
will land at Darwin and refuel. After appropriate crew rest the<br />
aircraft will undertake sea surveillance and navigation training<br />
operations over the Indian Ocean an area of great security<br />
interest to both Australia and the United States. The flights<br />
will then return via Darwin to Guam. As is the case with the<br />
current navigational missions, the flights landing at Darwin<br />
will be unarmed and will carry no bombs.<br />
As there has been much speculation in the media and elsewhere<br />
about this matter, I should like to emphasise that it has been<br />
agreed between the Foreign Minister and the Secretary of State<br />
that the aircraft staging through Darwin under the arrangements<br />
now agreed for surveillance flights and navigation training<br />
will be unarmed and carry no bombs.<br />
As I ha--also told the House the exchange of notes provides<br />
that the tralian Z:; nment's agreement would need to be<br />
obtaia. =; efore the . rAFE facilities could. be used in support of<br />
any other zategory cf operations by the United States. In that<br />
regard e: me state, so that there can be no grounds for au-_ stion<br />
or doub't the basis on which the agreement of the Australi n<br />
governrnent would be given to such other operations. Austcxlia<br />
would need to know, firstly, what the strategic and tactical<br />
objectives are and Australia would need to be in agreement<br />
with these; and second, what weapons are being carried and i~ n<br />
particular whether nuclear weapons are being carried.<br />
The Australian Government has a firm policy that aircraft carrying<br />
nuclear weaponswill not be allowed to fly over or stage through<br />
Australia without its prior knowledge and agreement. Nothing less<br />
than this is consistent with the maintenance of our national<br />
sovereignty. I am particularly pleased that it has been possible to reach<br />
finality on this question so soon in the term of the new<br />
Administration. Australia shares the US determination to take<br />
all steps within its power to deter further Soviet expansionism.<br />
We stand ready to lend our ANZUS partner what assistance we can<br />
in pursuit of our common aims. The provision of staging facilities<br />
at Darwin for these US aircraft will facilitate the surveillance<br />
and'training operations they are carrying out in an area of prime<br />
security concern to Australia. It also affords a further example<br />
of the close practical-co-operation which has been developed<br />
over many years between our two nations.<br />
