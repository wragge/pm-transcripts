    <content><![CDATA[<p>I am pleased to announce Australian Government funding of over $2.7 million for practical assistance to the community of Wadeye, one of Australia's most remote and disadvantaged indigenous communities.</p>
<p>The Australian Government will contribute $2 million towards establishing a new broadband link between Daly River and Wadeye and the communities of Palumpa and Peppimenarti.</p>
<p>The new broadband infrastructure will enable more reliable landline phone connections and faster internet communication from Wadeye.  This will help improve government service delivery and enhance regional economic development.  For example, videoconferencing capability will provide new teaching and learning opportunities for the Wadeye school.  Broadband will assist the development and marketing of small businesses, such as the proposed print-making enterprise.</p>
<p>The Australian Government will provide a further $546,000 over four years to establish a new intensive support playgroup programme in Wadeye.  The playgroup service will help young families across the community with early childhood education, health and parenting assistance.</p>
<p>As part of shared responsibility arrangements with the Australian and Northern Territory Governments, the Wadeye community has established a 'no school no pool' policy under which children's use of the local swimming pool is dependent on their school attendance.  School attendance rates have increased substantially.</p>
<p>Acknowledging the community's strong commitment to improving school attendance, the Australian Government will provide funding of $234,000 to assist the school at Wadeye.  This includes $80,000 to purchase computer equipment for two classrooms, $114,000 over three years for a cultural coordinator to manage the reintegration of children into school, building on the 'no school, no pool' policy, and a $40,000 contribution in 2005 to a joint initiative of the Thamarrurr Regional Council, Mi Patha Takeaway and parents providing healthy morning teas and lunches.</p>
<p>The Australian Government will work closely with the Northern Territory Government to ensure that recurrent funding for the Wadeye school properly caters for the increasing numbers of students attending.</p>
<p>The people of Wadeye have demonstrated their firm resolve to turn their community around, not only working in partnership with government but also by helping themselves.  The measures announced today by the Australian Government signal our continuing commitment to the partnership established with the Wadeye community and the Northern Territory Government under the COAG Trials.  Details of funding:   The Australian Government will provide $2 million to the Local Government Association of the Northern Territory (LGANT) who will work with Telstra Country Wide and the Thamarurr Regional Council to upgrade broadband services to the COAG region of Thamarrurr.</p>
<p> The total value of the project is $4 176 850, of which the Australian Government's Coordinated Communications Infrastructure Fund (CCIF) will provide $2 million, with the balance to be contributed by the project partners.   Funding for the Wadeye Intensive Support Playgroup will be $546,000 over four years ($78,000 in 2004/05 and $156,000 for subsequent three years).   Funding of $154,000 ($114,000 over three years for a cultural coordinator and $40,000 for a nutrition program in 2005) is being provided from the Parent School Partnership Initiative.   Additional funding of $80,000 under the Indigenous Education Strategic Initiatives Programme is being provided to upgrade IT infrastructure and equipment for two classrooms.</p>
