STATEMENT BY' THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON. P. J. KEATING MP<br />
SUMM* ARY OF R. EMARKS TO EPAC TARIFFS<br />
on 12 March 1991 path breaking changes were announced to the<br />
Parliament uphic6 altered forever Australia's dependence on<br />
the tariff.<br />
In greeting these momentous changes I said in the<br />
Parliament: " The package or measures announced today ends forever<br />
Australia's sorry association with the tariff as a<br />
device for industrial development."<br />
I also said at the same time:<br />
" Today's statement completes the program announced in<br />
the Economic Statement of May 1988.<br />
It puts an end to the high tariff culture which did so<br />
much to dimninish Australia's potential in the post-war<br />
period. But the decisions announced today do more than complete<br />
the transition to an open economy."<br />
The 1991 tariff changes completed the process of tariff<br />
adjustment and were not the stepping stone to further<br />
downward adjustment.<br />
As I have alway ' s said, the Government's policy has been to<br />
wean Australian industry of f protection and to make it<br />
competitive with world industry.<br />
And this has been absolutely essential if we are to develop<br />
secure industries capable of generating wealth for Australia<br />
and permanent jobs.<br />
But the Government has always sought industry restructuring<br />
and adjustment rather than industry elimination.<br />
As I said in the Parliament on 17 September 1990, this<br />
Government has never believed in the mindless pursuit of<br />
zero tariffs without regard to the impact that it would have<br />
on industries. </p>
<p>TEL: I~ 9 1 Cj I. Mr Il C F<br />

Ina the House on 17 September 1990 1 said:<br />
" we make decisions about whether we want industries.<br />
For instance, we want a car industry. We know that a<br />
car industry will not function at zero protection<br />
levels, but apparently those opposite believe that at a<br />
zero level of protection a car industry will remain<br />
viable. It will not. The Opposition is really saying<br />
it does not want a car industry.<br />
The car industry Is willing to invest with a tariff phasing<br />
down to 15 per Cent by the year 2000.<br />
Evidence of this is the commencement of the new Toyota car<br />
plant announced a few weeks ago and the decision by GMII to<br />
commence a new paint plant which I attended last week In<br />
Adelaide. Mitsubishi is also commencing a new paint shop in Adelaide.<br />
The key point is that these investments would not have taken<br />
place with a zero tariff and this is the key policy<br />
difference between the Government and the Opposition.<br />
Phasing down tari~ ffs5 to zero on motor vehicles and parts,<br />
such as passenger car tyres, would mean that these<br />
industries could no longer exist in Australia.<br />
The same is true for textiles, clothing and footwear.<br />
With a tariff of 25 per cent in the year 2000 these<br />
industries can adjust and restructure and will continue to<br />
exist. With a zero tariff they will simply disappear.<br />
This is the policy difference between the Government and the<br />
Opposition, and the Opposition should admit it.<br />
This is not to say that the textile, clothing and footwear<br />
and motor vehicle industries will not be competitive in the<br />
year 2000.<br />
At present, textile and clothing imports into most developed<br />
countries including the US, EC ( UK, France, Italy, Germany),<br />
Canada, Sweden and Japan are covered by the multi Fibre<br />
Arrangement ( MFA) which places quantitative restrictions on<br />
imports through Voluntary Restraint Arrangements.<br />
And quantitative restrictions are the ultimate form of<br />
protection extending beyond any tariff.<br />
Notwithstanding what happens under GATT, Australia will end<br />
up with a textile industry more internationally competitive<br />
than all of these countries with the tariff levels decided<br />
in March 1991. </p>
<p>3<br />
The motor vehicle industry around the world is also<br />
protected by voluntary restraints and quotas.<br />
By the year 2000, when the tariff on motor vehicles phases<br />
down to 15 per cent, Australia will also have a motor<br />
vehicle industry which will be competitive and able to hold<br />
itself up in world terms without quantitative restrictions.<br />
