PRESS CONFERENCE: WESTERN SUBURBS LEAGUES CLUB, MEETING<br />
WITH ETHNIC PRESS.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I am delighted to be here supporting Bill Vasseleou and<br />
I would like to make the point that over the last three to<br />
four years the Government has given a very great deal of<br />
attention to ' the needs of migrant families in Australia.<br />
We had the Galbally Inquiry, as you know, into the post-arrival<br />
services available to migrants and we have been implementing<br />
the recommendations of that particular report, which desigcned<br />
across a wide range of service provided by the Federal Government<br />
and y the State Government to improve what was otherwise<br />
available. It is not only a question of some of the basic<br />
servic. es English teaching in schools and matters of that kind<br />
we are also moving to encourage all schools to teach history<br />
and culture of Australia's great migrant communities so that<br />
there will be a much better understanding amongst all Australians.<br />
I think the day has long gone past when it was enough to teach<br />
English history and a bit of Australian history. It is important<br />
for Australians to know the history of Italy and of Greece and<br />
of many other countries from which our migrant communities<br />
have come.<br />
We have also, as you know, established ethnic radio. Ethnic<br />
television is moving forward. The experimental programme<br />
is now being undertaken. That will move onto its own basis<br />
a little bit further on. We are pursuing these policies because<br />
we recognise that there have been deficiencies in the past and<br />
in a multicultural society as Australia has become, it is very<br />
important to make sure that Governments respond to the change<br />
and respond to the diversity that we have amongst us.<br />
I think one of the quite exciting things I have seen in visiting<br />
ethnic radio in both Sydney and Melbourne is when you speak to<br />
all the broadcasters and organisers, how people from say<br />
different countries have come together for the first time. They<br />
are all Australians but they have come from 40 different countries.<br />
The-are responsible for the progra-nes for their own communities,<br />
but they are recognising the common link with Australians.<br />
I th-ink that the programmes that we've developing for Australia's<br />
re. t et-hnic ccrunities are better devised than ever before in<br />
or-s tory. I believe that it is coming to be quite widely<br />
recognised. I don't think I have anything more to say at the<br />
outset. It's over to you for questions.<br />
Question ( Inaudible). My question relates directly to ethnic broadcasting.<br />
Could you tell us please what is the currentattitude of the<br />
Government regarding a possible second frequency for ethnic radio?<br />
/ 2 </p>
<p>-2<br />
Prime Minister<br />
When I visited 2EA the other day this was put to me because<br />
it's difficult to get enough time on one frequency for say,<br />
up to 40 communities. I have spoken to the Minister, Tony Staley,<br />
about this. I can only say that it is under examination.<br />
It's not necessarily an easy question. There is a question of<br />
some degree of equity in other areas where services might not<br />
be available but I can understand the reasons why that request<br />
has been put forward. It is being examined at this moment.<br />
Question Etinic television. I know it's at the moment, it's only under<br />
trial. Will it be run under the same system as ethnic radio?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I think it's too early to say yet. There's a trial service on.<br />
We want everyone to say what they think of it whether they<br />
like it or dislike it, whether it is too tame or too provocative<br />
I don't think anyone will be saying what's been done so far is<br />
too provocative. There is the Ethnic Television Review Panel<br />
whizh wants-to have the views of ethnic communities, and of<br />
everyone for that matter, in what the programme ought to cover;<br />
what sorts of programmes there ought to be and I think we've<br />
got to have a look at that because we really do want the programme<br />
to be one that is going to respond to the needs and to the wishes<br />
of the ethnic communities. It's not something that a few people<br />
from the centre want to dictate. I think we've got to get the<br />
views of those who are interested in watching ethnic television.<br />
I think it's very important therefore that people make sure<br />
their views do get to the Review Panel and to make their views<br />
known. We want that-involvement from the communities and from<br />
other Australians also.<br />
Question<br />
-Aswith all these things, programme times as with radio, and I<br />
believe television, are going to be divided amongst the communities<br />
percentage-wide, according to the number of migrants from each<br />
grcup. Hence, the small groups the minorities like the<br />
Baltic. communities always tend to get very very small time slots<br />
an. unsuitable ones as we have with radio. ( Inaudible), but<br />
with T. V.-I know that a lot of Australians watch the ethnic<br />
procramme as do, of course, almost all the ethnic communities.<br />
T ha-e seen that a lot of the programmes are in English or half<br />
ir ' ish and half the original language, and I was wondering<br />
whether more stress could be put not so much on time given on<br />
a percentage, but the quality of the programme or something which<br />
would provide interest for the entire community. Unless this<br />
aspect was looked at then the smaller minority communities,<br />
as I was told, might only get a quarter of an hour, a half an hour,<br />
every three months. This certainly brings about an inferiority<br />
complex. / 3 </p>
<p>3<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I hope it won't do that. But, I agree with you. I think the<br />
best ethnic television will be television that appeals to all<br />
Australians wherever they cone and however long they have been<br />
here. It's not just a question of having Italian programmes<br />
which only Italians are going to be interested in seeing to<br />
give an example. So, I hope many of the programmes can be<br />
broadbased in the groups of people that they appeal to. But it<br />
is too early yet to make any judgements and it would be quite<br />
wrong for me to make any judgements about what the programmes<br />
ought to be. We want to assess the views of the communities<br />
and of Australians generally and that's the reason why the<br />
pilot programmes are in place so that people can look at them<br />
and judge them say if they like them or say if they don't,<br />
say what they think they ought to be.<br />
Quest ion<br />
( Inaudible) to raise the question of postal rates for<br />
foreign language newspapers. Up until now we didn't get any<br />
( inau.-ible) lowering of the postal rates.<br />
Pri-e Minister<br />
.1 wilñ chase that up for you, but it was my understanding that<br />
the postal rates for a number of newspapers were reduced a couple<br />
of months ago.<br />
Question ( Inaudible) foreign language newspapers.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
There wouldn't have been any distinction. Let me check it.<br />
Question ( Inaudible).<br />
PrLme Minister<br />
Le-t check it up and I will write to you about that, because<br />
ñ 5 adig is that there has been a reduction in postage<br />
rates for a number of periodicals.<br />
expand on the newspaper situation. I have noticed that some<br />
ethnic newspapers carry quite a few Commonwealth and State<br />
Government advertisements, whereas some don't. I was wondering<br />
whether this again is these advertisements are placed on a<br />
percentage basis depending on the circulation of newspapers,<br />
or whether they should be placed in all ethnic newspapers to let<br />
all communities know about Government decisions, especially<br />
regarding social security rules and if that is so, then there<br />
is a communications gap because some of the smaller papers have<br />
them, some haven't and for some of them I know no advertisements<br />
have been sent. / 4<br />
.** a'CTgaww r </p>
<p>4<br />
Przime Minister<br />
I will get a report on that and see how the placing of<br />
advertisements in.-. ethnic newspapers is judged. The Government' s<br />
objective is to have the newspapers placed in such a way that<br />
we get to all communities and to as many people as possible.<br />
But, let me make some inquiries and I will write to you about<br />
that also.<br />
SPrime Minister<br />
One or two of you might be interested in a statement that I think<br />
has been issued in Canberra a short while ago in the names of<br />
myself, Doug Anthony, Sir-Charles Court, and Mr. Petersen.<br />
The statement I think speaks for itself but it is an important<br />
one. It indicates an agreement in relation to export guidelines.<br />
I will be in touch with other Premiers who are also involved<br />
in the export of minerals and N. S. W. of course will be involved<br />
in -* tat. The Chief Minister of the Northern Territory is involved<br />
in exports from the Northern Territory. Other states are<br />
concerned but to a lesser extent. But it is an important statement<br />
becau-se last night we came to an agreement that has resolved<br />
the differences between State and Commonwealth and the agreement<br />
was referred to my Government this morning and to the Queensland<br />
and Western Australian Governments during the course of the day.<br />
In each case the Governments have ratified the agreement.<br />
Question Can you tell us the essence of the agreement?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
The essence of the agreement really is that there will be full<br />
consultation between the States and the Commonwealth on a<br />
cortinuing basis. We will want to keep in touch on market<br />
circumstances in any particular industry any particular<br />
export.-Nobody wants to be using export controls in commercial<br />
Scircumstances, but I think everyone recognised there can be<br />
occasions when Governments need to be involved. That is not<br />
denied by the States. The Commonwealth's power is accepted and<br />
admitted, but I think the main thing that the States want and<br />
it is reasonable-is that if that power is to be used it should<br />
be used in consultation and desirably, obviously, with the<br />
agreemenu of the State and with the agreement of the industry.<br />
The Commonwealth has a reserve position, clearly, but we will<br />
be seeking to act ih agreement and in concert with the States.<br />
We onZunced some time ago that in the present marketing<br />
circ:-. stances there is no need for the export guidelines as such<br />
to remain in relation to iron ore and if there is to be any<br />
introduction or introduction of controls of some kind in that<br />
particular industry that will be in consultation with the<br />
Government of Western Australia. In relation to coal, aluminium<br />
and bau
will having consultations with the States concerned about current<br />
market circumstances and the continued application of the<br />
guidelines. We will be having those consultations against the<br />
background of the whole ( inaudible) agreement that was reached<br />
last night and which will have been published in the press statemen<br />
today. Basically, it I think represents a very sensible </p>
<p>.7 Prime Minister ( continued)<br />
arrangement between Governments. It will resolve differences,<br />
establish a basis for consultation and principles which will<br />
govern that consultation and therefore give very great<br />
security of course to investors in great development projects<br />
in different parts of Australia. I think therefore it's<br />
certainly something the Commonwealth welcomes very greatly<br />
and something that I am sure the States also will welcome.<br />
The document speaks for itself. The details of it are all<br />
there. Question<br />
Mr. Fraser, has Mr. Bjelke Petersen reacted yet about-on<br />
your decision, the Government's decision, on the Great Barrier Reef?<br />
Prime M1inister<br />
I was with him for hours last night and I don't see any<br />
prc--1ems in that area.<br />
Que-stion<br />
Did he mention it?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
No. I think he publicly said that Queensland accepts or lives<br />
with, or whatever, the decision. I don't see differences<br />
there. Prime Minister<br />
Pr. me Minister, from what you've just said ( inaudible) does<br />
that mean there is no need for consultation on iron ore?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
No, if there was to be any application of export controls of<br />
one kind or another in the iron ore industry of course there<br />
W471 be consultation.<br />
Question Pr:*! e Minister<br />
No, it's not envisaged at the moment. I think the marketing<br />
situation is improving. The market is much stronger than it was.<br />
Generally, the market situation in a number of minerals is<br />
improving. Mr. Anthony is also issuing a statement shortly<br />
which will indicate that a very large number of commodities<br />
of lesser importance than the ones I mentioned will be<br />
completely de-controlled. In other words, a large part of the<br />
fabric of control is disappearing. / 6 </p>
<p>6<br />
Prime Minister ( continued)<br />
That is an examination that he set in train as a result<br />
of an examination he set in train many many months ago during<br />
the course of last year.<br />
Question Prime Minister, basically that means that coal and iron ore...<br />
Prime Minister<br />
No, the guidelinesremain in place at the present time on<br />
coal, alumina and bauxite andthere will be discussions with<br />
the Governments concerned about the continuing need for<br />
application of guidelines judged against current market<br />
circ-. mnstances and future prospects.<br />
Question You said that the Government will always retain reserve power<br />
( inaudible).<br />
Prie Minister<br />
I didn't have to say it, that was accepted; that the<br />
constitutional power is the Commonwealth's and that's not<br />
challenged. But the States do press and that is not unreasonable,<br />
because they are involved in development projects. They want<br />
them to go ahead, they want them to maximise investment,<br />
development, for export earnings, just as we, and they have got a<br />
constitutional position-in relation to a number of aspects as<br />
we have in relation to others. It's only reasonable therefore<br />
that Governments should act in consultation and to the maximum<br />
-extent possible by agreement.<br />
Question Are you aware of a situation in Canberra amongst the Hungarians<br />
living there and are being harrassed by the Hungarian<br />
Ambassador. The Canberra Times had reported this some months<br />
age when the Hungarian Ambassador refused to ( inaudible) for<br />
a Hungarian woman who receives the same ( inaudible)...<br />
bl-t nce he is a member of the Committee of the Australian-Hungarian<br />
Club, ( inaudible)...<br />
Pr-i" e Minister<br />
I haven't heard of problems in that area. I would be happy to<br />
make some inquiries for you if I can. I haven't heard of<br />
the problems. I don't think I have had any representations<br />
in relation to it. I will check with my office. I can't guarantee<br />
I have about 2,000 or 3,000 letters into my office a week.<br />
