EXCERPT OF TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW FOR SYDNEY MORNING HERALD<br />
WITH MIKE STEKETEE AND PETER BOWERS 9 December 1986<br />
E 0 E Proof Only<br />
STEKETEE: Is the natural unpopularity that the Treasurer has<br />
suffered, particularly during the difficult economic times,<br />
been aggravated in Paul Keating's case, by the blind spot<br />
over failing to tile his tax return?<br />
PM: The Treasurer has obviously suffered as a result of<br />
that. It is something that he acknowledges that he has<br />
suffered as a result of that. And inevitably, there is some<br />
negative impact for the Government. It would be futile for<br />
either myself or Paul to deny that. He doesn't deny it and<br />
nor do I.<br />
BOWERS: Prime Minister, you have said the Treasurer should<br />
spend more time talking to people in supermarkets, I think.<br />
Do you think it is time that the boy from Bankstown went<br />
home? PM: Let me say this. In terms of where Paul Keating's<br />
commitments are, I think he has been done a terrible<br />
injustice in the assumption that he has lost a commitment to<br />
the traditional Labor electorate. This is one of the great<br />
injustices of Australian politics. And I know from being the<br />
person who has sat there year after year, in the ERC<br />
processes, just how real Paul Keating's commitments are to<br />
the traditional Labor values.. That gets ignored or neglected<br />
because of the extraordinary capacity he has to deal with the<br />
business and the financial community, not only in this<br />
country but internationally. The fact that he has that<br />
capacity, to a hugely demonstrable, degree carries no<br />
implication, and indeed it is not right to say that he has<br />
lost his traditional commitments. Now to assume, therefore,<br />
that he needs to be physically, at some point, to remember<br />
his values, is an unfairness to him. Now I guess,<br />
objectively, it would be the case that it would be easier for<br />
him politically if he were back there. But, of course, the<br />
point he makes is that to do the job of Treasurer of this<br />
country is one which requires, almost more than any other<br />
position, a relativeW~ continual presence in Canberra. The<br />
third point I would make is that no-one knows more than I do<br />
the deep commitment that this man has to his family. And it<br />
is traditionally appropriate for politicians to assert the<br />
closeness that they have the inspiration they from<br />
their-family and it is fair enough for politicians to do<br />
that. I know, from my own personal and intimate knowledge of<br />
the Keating family, how true it is in his case. Those are </p>
<p>the things th ' at are relevant in full answer to your question.<br />
But I acknowl ' edge that in political terms# yes it probably<br />
would be easier for him if he were back there.<br />
BOWERS: wran' s offer of resignation I.. </p>
