PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR PRESS 4 MAY 1977<br />
ADDRESS AT CEREMONY TO HAND OVER CHEQUE TO THE UNESCO APPEAL<br />
TO SAFEGUARD THE ACROPOLIS<br />
It gives me great pleasure to be here today to present Australia's<br />
contribution to the UNESCO Appeal for safeguarding the Acropolis.<br />
The Acropolis and its monuments most notably the Parthenon<br />
is one of the most magnificent achievements of modern civilisation.<br />
It symbolises the Greek contribution to the whole of western<br />
cdivilisation, and is still looked to as the foundation and<br />
inspiration of our architecture. Its ruined buildings remind<br />
us of the supremely influential ideas of the ancient Greeks. in<br />
philosophy, science, history, literature and politics, and of<br />
their galaxy of great men Socrates, Plato, Archimedes,<br />
Thucydides, Pericles and Sophocles to single out only a random<br />
few. It is on these ideas and ideals that western civilisation is<br />
built. While the Acropolis is Greek, it is of incalculable<br />
significance and value to us and to the people of all nations.<br />
Unfortunately, this value has not always been appreciated.<br />
During the seventeenth century, the Acropolis was reduced to<br />
an expanse of ruins by a gunpowder explosion. Restoration of<br />
the Acropolis began in the nineteenth century and has continued<br />
to the present. Now atmospheric pollution is attacking the<br />
Acropolis' stone surfaces, and there is an urgent need for<br />
further restoration.<br />
At last year's UNESCO General Conference, a Resolution cosponsored<br />
by Australia authorised a world wide campaign of<br />
public and private aid in co-operation with the Greek Government<br />
to safeguard the Acropolis.<br />
In Australia, that campaign is getting under way, and I am delighted<br />
to see that Ethnic Radio will be mounting an Acropolis radiothon on<br />
May.<br />
Today we are contributing $ 100,000 to the UNESCO campaign out of<br />
respect for the great contribution classical Greek thought and<br />
culture has made to the world, and the contribution Greeks have<br />
made to the development of our nation. / Greeks </p>
<p>2<br />
Greeks and their children have increased the numbers of<br />
Australians by some 300,000. Their contribution to all<br />
aspects of Australian life has made our society more vital<br />
and diverse.<br />
Australia has gained a great deal from ancient and modern Greece,<br />
from the values of which the Acropolis is a living symbol, and<br />
from the hard work and culture of the Greeks who have become<br />
part of our nation.<br />
It gives me great pleasure to hand over this contribution to<br />
safeguarding one of the world's treasures. </p>
