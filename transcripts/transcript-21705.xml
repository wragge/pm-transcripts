    <content><![CDATA[<p>Thank you very much Mr Ambassador, Mr Imai, distinguished members of the Japanese business community, it is a great pleasure for me and for my colleagues to be present at this important lunch.</p>
<p>In my discussion earlier today with the METI Minister I said that in relations between countries and economic matters old friends were the best friends. And commencing with the landmark Commerce Agreement that was signed between Australia and Japan as far back as 1957 this relationship of ours has been a strong, steady, loyal and consistent one.</p>
<p>In a major speech on Australian foreign policy which I delivered in Sydney only a few weeks ago, I said that Australia had no closer partner in the region than Japan.  I would extend that to say that Australia has no more loyal and valuable customer in the world than Japan.</p>
<p>Many of the members of the Japanese business community here today have themselves made very strong personal commitments to the relationship which have gone beyond their commercial interests and responsibilities.</p>
<p>Mr Imai has made not only a contribution as Chairman of the Japan-Australia Business Cooperation Committee, but he has also agreed to become the Chairman of the Australian-Japan Year of Exchange in 2006 which seeks to further strengthen the ties between our two countries.</p>
<p>I'd also like to acknowledge the contribution of Mr Murofushi to the Australia-Japan Conference Series founded in 2001 and have done much to remind both countries of the ongoing strength and durability of the relationship.</p>
<p>Later today I will have a meeting with and then continue my discussions with the Prime Minister of Japan, Mr Junichiro Koizumi.  Those discussions will not only cover the full extent of our trade and economic relationship, but also the close political and strategic partnership that Australia and Japan now enjoy.</p>
<p>And finally may I say ladies and gentlemen, as I look around the table I see the names of the companies whose leaders are here, I think of the Australian economy over the last 30 or 40 years because so many of these great Japanese enterprises have played a major role in the economic life of my country during my lifetime.</p>
<p>I thank you most warmly for joining me.</p>
