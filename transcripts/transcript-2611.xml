STATE DINNER<br />
DJAKARTA<br />
Speech by the Prime Minister, the Rt Hon.<br />
William McMahon,' CH, MP JUU7E 5, 1972.<br />
Your Excellencies, President Soeharto and MAadamne Soeharto,<br />
Distinguished Guest1-s:<br />
I am honoured and personally delighted to be here with you<br />
tonight among friends. My delight is, however, tinged. with regret<br />
at the unavoidable absence of my wife. But I sDeak for her, too,<br />
when I express our personal friendship for you, Mr. President and<br />
for Madame Soeharto. Your visit to Australia is still fresh in our<br />
memories and I want to convey to you the warmest greetings from her<br />
and from the mnany friends you met in Australia as well as from the<br />
Australian people themselves. 1972 was the year in which you,<br />
Mr. President, by your visit to Australia, gave a powerful stimulus<br />
to enlightened co-operation between our two countries.<br />
Mr. President, I believe our friendship now has firm foundations.<br />
Increasing numbers of Australians share my interest and desire for<br />
closer and direct contact with your large and fascinating country.<br />
Part of this interest arises from our proximity. But much of the<br />
interest arises from a sense of fresh discovery of something<br />
different something that has ancient foundations but-which is, to<br />
many ofr us, refreshingly new. I am sure, too, that in the last few<br />
years you have become increasingly awara of us as a country with<br />
another kind of economy and society.<br />
So we are of interest to each other not just because we are<br />
neighbours, but because we are different and have commonly shared<br />
goals and commonly shared interests. These commonly-shared goals<br />
and interests, I believe, and concerned with<br />
security, stability and peace,<br />
national development,<br />
economic and cultural co-operation and<br />
trade<br />
41r. President I think you will agree that our private<br />
conversations this morning have reinforced this. ./ 2 </p>
<p>From the very first days of your independence we sympathised with,<br />
and supported you struggle. We were among the first to establish<br />
diplomatic relations with your newly independent country: And even<br />
when our relations were at a low point we maintained our embassies<br />
in each other's capitals and continued a dialogue.<br />
Mr. President, I am well aware that you have created stability<br />
and maintained growth in your own country, and have contributed to<br />
the stability and development of the South-East Asian region. I<br />
now assure you that I, along with many other Australians, share a<br />
deep and abiding interest in. your country, its culture and its<br />
future. If two countries with such different cultural, ethnic<br />
geographical and religious backgrounds can build the bridges of<br />
co-operation and goodwill as we have, then Sir, we have a unique,<br />
intimate and mutually rewarding relationship which is an example<br />
that other countries troubled by conflict and tension can follow.<br />
We are both members of a region composed, in a political sense, of<br />
many newly-independent nations. We are both devoted to regional<br />
development and to the concept of which you, Sir, are one of the<br />
architects of national resilience. I speak of national resilience<br />
as the will and the ability of each of us, so far as it is within<br />
our capability, to defend our independence by our own efforts.<br />
I believe, too, 1tr. President, that the Asian theatre will be<br />
profoundly influenced by the changes now occurring in the<br />
relationships among the major powers. President Nixon's visits to<br />
Peking and Moscow have altered the balance away from confrontation,<br />
and towards conciliation and detente. If these trends continue, and<br />
we hope they will, the peoples of South-East Asia can look forward<br />
with some hope to greater prospects of peace, stability and progress<br />
This does not mean that we can relax our efforts to build up our<br />
capability, regional co-operation and, in your own words, regional<br />
resilience. Nor does it mean that in all circumstances we can go<br />
it alone'. The conflict is still raging in Indo-China, and at a<br />
higher level of violence. Other nations in the region are still<br />
confronted with problems of subversion and, in some instances, armed<br />
insurgency. These disturbances make it all the more imperative<br />
that we should work actively and effectively together. As I have<br />
already said, Mr. President, 1972 has been the year of enlightened<br />
co-operation in many fields, including trade, development, cultural<br />
and defence co-operation.<br />
Our trade is growing but we want to ensure that it grows to<br />
our mutual advantage, and we believe it is important to do more to<br />
encourage your exports to Australia. You may recall that we<br />
introduced in 1966 a system of preferential tariff quotas on<br />
manufactured goods imported from developing countries. We were the<br />
first to do so. These quotas have been expanded both in size and<br />
numbers over the years. In fact at the recent UNCTAD conference in<br />
Santiago, we announced that a further 200 items would be added to<br />
the system. I feel that Indonesia has not yet taken up its fair<br />
share of these quotas which are designed to help all developing<br />
countries. / 2 </p>
<p>We are prepared to do whatever possible to provide your<br />
traders with information on market proposals in Australia. I have<br />
asked my colleague, the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for<br />
Trade and Industry, to visit Indonesia for trade talks on these<br />
and other matters, including a review of our trade agreement which<br />
was negotiated initially in 1959. I also expect Mr. Anthony to<br />
discuss investment issues of mutual concern with your ministers.<br />
Then there is economic development. This is a subject to<br />
which your Government attaches the highest priority, and my<br />
Government has been happy to assist in providing technical skills,<br />
know-how and equipment. We have a common interest in the<br />
development of the port of Tjilatjap, and we have been discussing a<br />
new project in animal husbandry of which I will be saying more later<br />
in this visit. This as you know, is a large project indeed.<br />
As I have informed you, Mr. President, my Government plans a<br />
substantial increase in Australian aid over the next three years.<br />
Mr. President, we are also involved in cultural co-operation.<br />
Our two governments signed a cultural agreement four years ago and<br />
there has been a welcome increase in cultural contacts since then:<br />
But more needs to be done. I have proposed, with the agreement<br />
of your Government, to establish a cultural and language centre in<br />
Djakarta. This centre will promote two-way cultural and language<br />
exchanges. And, finally, in the field of defence co-operation, our armed<br />
services are working closely together in a number of projects.<br />
Neither of us wants a military pack of alliance. But there is much<br />
e can do by giving assistance in a practical way and by sharing<br />
experiences and knowledge and co-operating to our joint advantage.<br />
We have arranged to provide sabre jet fighters and accompanying<br />
equipment and technology and flight training, and very substantial<br />
help in equipping an important military airfield at Iswahjudi.<br />
Already your airmen including pilots and technicians are now being<br />
trained in Australia: And we are willing to respond positively to<br />
your wish to strengthen your coastal surveillance capacilities.<br />
There are several other such projects under discussion between us<br />
that I hope to see brought to fruition.<br />
I am now able to say that my Government last week approved<br />
increased financial provision for technical and military<br />
co-operation with Indonesia to enable us to assist in these and<br />
other ways.<br />
Mr. President, I, and the vast majority of Australians, highly<br />
esteem the wise, courageous and unifying leadership you have given<br />
to Indonesia and the energetic role you have played in your<br />
country's development. We are both fortunate that you assumed the<br />
leadership of Indonesia at a moment in its history when your<br />
qualities as a leader were most needed. Since then you have<br />
continued to provide inspiration for your people. You have guided<br />
your country through many difficult years, and have opened up<br />
prospects for a better a much better future.<br />
Mr. President, I now propose the toast to you and to the<br />
continuing friendship of our two countries and our co-operation in<br />
the pursuit of peace and progress for Indonesia Australia and<br />
our friendly neighbours.<br />
