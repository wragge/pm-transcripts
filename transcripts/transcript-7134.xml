FOR ? IEDXA 9 MARCH 1987<br />
Forty nine mamber countries of the Commonwealth celebrate<br />
Commonwealth Day today.<br />
The Common'woalth today represents a quarter of the vyorld~ s<br />
population, a third of its sovereign and independent nations, and<br />
people of al colours and creeds.<br />
Successive Australian Governments have regarded the Commonwealth<br />
as having a valuable role to play in international affairs. The<br />
commonweal Z~ has helped to promote international acceptance of<br />
the princ~ ples of self-determination, non-racialism, human<br />
freedom an-d equality and co-operation between nations in the<br />
service of international understanding, development and world<br />
peace.<br />
Over the post two years the situation in South Africa has been of<br />
particular concern and the Commonwealth has endeavoured to<br />
promote dialogue between whites and blacks and has taken measures<br />
aimed at ending the abhorrent apartheid system.<br />
in a less dramatic but no less important way, it has continued to<br />
provide bot%-h a forum for conzultation and co-operation on a wide<br />
range of economic, social, educational and technical matters of<br />
particular benefit for both developed and developing country<br />
members. The next meeting of the Commonwealth Heads of Government, which<br />
will be hold in Vancouver in October this year, will provide a<br />
further opportunity for Commonwealth leaders to pursue the broad<br />
Commonwealth objectives of international co-operation and<br />
understanding. </p>
