PRESS OFFICE TRANSCRIPTTUSA, 1JLY98<br />
INTERVIEW WITH PETER HARVEY, NATIONAL NINE NETWORK ECONOMY<br />
Question<br />
Prime Minister a lot of people are understandably very concerned.<br />
about interest rates, so much so that the New South Wales<br />
Premier has today,: and I understand the Victorian Premier is<br />
going to bring in, some sort of guarantee scheme to protect<br />
people, they say, from losing their homes. How concerned are<br />
you about the problem that this sort of reaction in political<br />
terms represents?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
We of course, acted to help people who are buying or who want<br />
to buy their homes several months ago. We brought in an<br />
approach that. was going to subsidise the interest payments<br />
first home buyers, one that was going to make a much more<br />
easily attainable subsidy to help pay for part of the deposit.<br />
In addition to that, we offered to the states, quite<br />
significant sums in co-operation with the states to help<br />
families in Ea crisis situation. I mean, the very circumstances<br />
that Mr Wran is talking about has probably been funded in<br />
part with our.. funds, because we said we were going to work<br />
with the states, circumstances where people who are in<br />
emergency difficulties over mortgage repayments will be<br />
given help arnd protection.<br />
Question So this is something that doesn't apply just to New South Wales?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
No, we are providing funds. We said we would go dollar for<br />
dollar with the states over a three year program and we are<br />
obviously concerned at high interest rates and especially if<br />
a family gets damaged in other ways. If somebody loses a job<br />
well that famaily can be in very great difficulty and<br />
Government's need to have arrangements that can provide help.<br />
So if Mr Wran made an announcement yesterday, we were three<br />
or four months ahead of him, but the detailed adminstration<br />
of that kind of personal crisis relief needs to be undertaken<br />
by the states, because they have the machinery, the framework<br />
for that. But we have said that we would provide significant<br />
sums, and we are.<br />
Question But you are obviously keeping a watch on whether it is being done,<br />
are people being protected? Are the states doing what they should? ./ 2<br />
TUESDAY, 13 JULY 1982 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I will need t~ o speak to our own Minister about that because<br />
he had not completed the discussions with all the states in<br />
the last report that I had from him, but because this matter<br />
has come up t-his morning, I will make sure that if the matters<br />
are not concluded with all the states, that they will be<br />
pressed forward as a matter of urgency, because I know they<br />
are important.<br />
Question To protect the family homes, no matter where in Australia?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
No matter where.<br />
Question And this will be a continuing interest from Canberra?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Yes it will.<br />
Question Prime Minister, overall with the state of Australia today, it<br />
is a big question, but broadly, how do you see it?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
We have some problems ahead of us. Now part of that is home<br />
grown, to the extent of wage increases last year and when you<br />
take the hours decisions into account, probably we gave<br />
ourselves a 15% or 20% wage increase. Now when other countries<br />
are settling for 5% or 6% wage increases and when other<br />
countries very often as a result of very real recession,<br />
have been getting their inflation rates down below ours.<br />
obviously their industries are being made more competitive<br />
and ours are being made less comeptitive. There Will be more<br />
imports coming into the country and unfortuntely, they have<br />
been replacing Australian made goods.<br />
The hours decision and the wages decision of last year have<br />
done a great amount of damage indeed, and now we have to work<br />
that through the system and we have to be restrained in our<br />
approach to these matters over the period ahead of us.<br />
It has all been compounded by world recession of a very real<br />
kind. If we have problems in Australia, then visit the United<br />
States, Canada, Britain or France or other countries in Europe<br />
and the problems, the difficulties of unemployment are measurably<br />
very much greater than in Australia. There are not many people<br />
here who know that over the last recorded quarter industrial<br />
production in most of these countries has been falling and<br />
world trade shrank last year for the first time in 20 years. ./ 3 </p>
<p>-3-<br />
( Prime Minister cont.)<br />
That all gets reflected in much lower commodity prices<br />
for our exports, for mining exports, the exports from<br />
primary industries and our manufactureres are now in a<br />
more competitive world. Now the task of the Government as<br />
I see it is to do everything that we possibly can to guide<br />
Australia through a difficult period and to make sure that<br />
when there is a world upturn, Australian industries are<br />
going to be well placed to take advantage of expanding<br />
trade opportunities. But we cannot afford any more loss<br />
of competitiveness, we have to make sure that that sort of<br />
thing does not happen. We are looking at the Industry<br />
Assistance Commission reports and obviously against the<br />
Budget discussions going on over the next couple of weeks<br />
against this total background. There is a very significant<br />
responsibility on Government to come up with the right<br />
answer. Question You are talking in fairly tough terms, does that mean<br />
that measures, such as incomes tax reductions will now have<br />
to be postponted?<br />
Prime MinistE~ r<br />
Well, I do not want to talk about any particular facet or<br />
part of the Budget or what might be in the Budget. But<br />
obviously the situation we are in today is different from<br />
that of 12 months ago on the lead up to that Budget because<br />
then Australi a was growing strongly in economic terms, we<br />
had expectations that that growth would continue. Now<br />
a continuing world recession, the massive downturn in<br />
commodity prices which is putting miners in great difficulty<br />
and there caii be no guarantee that all projects are going<br />
to go ahead. There has been talk in the papers in recent<br />
days about the problems of Alcoa at Portland and I hope very<br />
much that Mr Cain's negotiations with the company can lead<br />
to a continuation of the project. We know the company<br />
isin a cash difficulty and we know the market for aluminium<br />
is very thin, and that is a project that is based entirely<br />
on export orders. -If they cannot get those-export orders<br />
there is obviously a real problem.<br />
So these things are now hitting Australia hard. We have<br />
been told over the last two years there will be an<br />
American upturn in six months. Well we are still being<br />
told there will be an American upturn in six months and<br />
sometime those forecasters are going to have to be right,<br />
but I will believe it when I actually see it, * and we are<br />
not going to see a shift in commodity prices till that<br />
happens. Now the longer this continues the more it<br />
affects Australia because we are a significant trading<br />
nation and a large part of our national income a large<br />
part of the weaUU-being of every Australian family is<br />
dependent on our capadity to sell overseas, and to sell at<br />
a reasonable price. We cannot pretend we'are an island unto<br />
ourselves, we cannot shut out the world outside. 4 </p>
<p>Question The reality is that that translates the things like<br />
the possibi]. ity of taxation reduction.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Well it translates to all sorts of possibilities, unfortunately,<br />
but I am not commenting on any particular item because<br />
we are just beginning the Budget discussions and I don't<br />
want to start speculation about what may or may not be.<br />
Question<br />
Obviously it is something you would like to work for?<br />
Prime Minis-ter<br />
Obviously, nobody likes paying taxes, you don't, I don't<br />
nobody else does. But at the same time, if there are<br />
things that Governments must do, they have to be paid for.<br />
Whether it is education, health, roads or whatever and we<br />
have been, certainly by comparison with other countries<br />
very restrained in our own expenditure over the last six<br />
or seven years. Some people come out and say: " knock a<br />
billion, knock two billion dollars off expenditure,<br />
knock it off welfare or whatever", but then when you chcllenge<br />
them with a harder question: " where in particular would you<br />
reduce expenditure", they say: " that is your job". Well of<br />
course it is but we are not in the business of cutting<br />
expenditures and haven't been in a way that damages the<br />
lives of individual Australians.<br />
Question Mr Hayden and Mr Hawke are both saying the only way for<br />
an Australian Government to behave at the moment is to<br />
generate jobs, to generate business, to spend. They are<br />
saying that only the Labor Party with its links with the<br />
trade union movements, with its links with the labour force,<br />
can get this country out of what they say, is an economic<br />
recession. How do you respond to that, it is a fairly<br />
powerful argument at this time with unemployment at a<br />
record high?<br />
Prime Mini: ster<br />
I don't think that is correct, and I don't believe the track<br />
record of Labor in Government gives any credibility to that c3ai.<br />
I don't know that'it really is a powerful argument because<br />
the Labor Party's approach to economic problems has always<br />
been to spend and to spend up big. They proved that when<br />
they were in Government and Government expenditure went up<br />
by 46% in one year alone which people tend to forget, and<br />
it was that: Labor Government that really began Australia's<br />
economic prbblems. It is worth noting perhaps that there<br />
was Mr Whitlam as Prime Minister and Mr Hayden as Treasurer </p>
<p>and Mr Hawke! as President of the ACTU and as President of the<br />
Labor Party, the three of them together made the biggest<br />
mess of Government in Australia that this country has ever<br />
seen. So I don't think that does much for the credibility<br />
of either Mr Hayden or Mr Hawke. In addition to that, we<br />
have seen the problems that Labor caused in Tasmania<br />
but people probably don't pay ' a great deal of attention<br />
to that, but: the deficit that they were left there would be<br />
equivalent to a New South Wales deficit of $ 400 or $ 500 million,.<br />
We have seen the massive economic nonsense<br />
that Mr Wran has gone on with through five or six years of<br />
total mismanagement in New South Wales and wherever Labor<br />
has had a chance to run a Government is has messed up the<br />
economy which that Government was responsible. Now,<br />
if Mr Hayden is going to come along and say: " all you need<br />
is a Labor cGovernment, which is going to spend a great deal<br />
of money", t: hat is not going to be the answer to Australia's<br />
problems. We need careful management, we need careful<br />
analysis of the difficulties that industry, that people face<br />
and we need a Government that is responsive to those<br />
concerns. Question Will an election campaign, be it early or late, be fought al * ong these<br />
lines, that the'Labor Party be it Hayden or Hawke promising that<br />
they can do better than you with 7 years of difficulties.<br />
Would it worry you fighting an election campaign on those<br />
grounds Prime MinistLer<br />
Whenever it comes, no it wouldn't, because I don't believe<br />
for one moment that people would take a gamble with the<br />
Australian Labor Party in terms of the management of this<br />
country's affairs. The Wran example in New South Wales, the<br />
tinsel, the public relations machine has fallen apart and<br />
the damage that he and his mismanagement, his lack of concern<br />
has done to the state and to the people of New South Wales<br />
is massive indeed. * He has had to put on new taxes and<br />
charges totalling $ 350 million and that is on top of against this<br />
base grant last year of a 17% increase in funds from the<br />
Commonwealth this year and the untied tax reimbursement<br />
grants. Now if a Labor Premier cannot run on a 17% increase<br />
in those untied funds, then obviously there is something<br />
very wrong indeed with Mr Wran's adminstration. I don't<br />
believe Australians would take a risk again. I know<br />
that there earlier had been suggestions that Mr Hayden<br />
was a responsible economic manager, but he was a minister<br />
of a Government that resulted in greater increases in<br />
health costs in Australia than ever before in Australia's<br />
history. Ile was Minister of a Government that increased<br />
expenditurEt by 46% in one year, that led to massive problems.<br />
Now neither Mr HaydennorMr Whitlam had told the people of<br />
Australia that that was what they were going to do before<br />
they got into Government. They kept that all a great<br />
secret. and it is all very well to pretend to be reasonabl" -responsib~ le<br />
when you are in opposition, but it is the test of what you do </p>
<p>-6-<br />
when you arE! in Government that counts and when you put<br />
that test on the Australian Labor Party whether it is<br />
in the Commonwealth or whether it is in the States, they<br />
have failed abysmally.<br />
Question Now you appear quite certain about the result of an election?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Yes. Question No matter when it comes?'<br />
Prime Minis-ter<br />
No matter.<br />
Question Do you rule out an early election?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I can say no more than I always have. Unless there are<br />
very good reasons I believe the Parliament should run its<br />
full term. I still say that. There is no doubt that over<br />
the last two or three weeks at the Labor Party conference<br />
Mr Wran sought to terrify the conference members with the<br />
prospects of an early election because that was the only way<br />
he could belt them into some elements of responsibility.<br />
Question Is he wrong, is Wran wrong?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Well, I think it is rather a poor thing that that is the kind<br />
of weapon he has to use to try and get even a half respontible<br />
answer out of AL~ P conference delegates.<br />
Question But isn't it an option that you keep up your sleeve?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
If the circumstances required it, if the Senate misbehaves.<br />
I am not going to say under no circumstances. * We don't have<br />
a majority in the Senate and I don't know what the Senate<br />
is going to do. So * to -that extent I don't know whether<br />
I would be forced into a position when I would have to call<br />
an election or not. ./ 7 </p>
<p>-7-<br />
Question But it wouldn't worry you even with the Labor Party campaigning<br />
on their economic promises?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
No, because once people start to focus their minds on the<br />
problems, on the sorts of policies that the Labor Party<br />
would put in place. Let's just take a couple of examples.<br />
They want to put on a resource tax. Now our resource<br />
industry is right down on its knees, world prices are falling.<br />
This is often the nature of what happens in that industry<br />
and if they are going to get an additional tax put upon<br />
them then quite plainly there are goi~ ng to be many more<br />
people out cf a job. The press reported the conference<br />
decision on uranium as one which would allow the industry<br />
to continue, but if you read the policy, the resolutions<br />
carefully, t. he commitment to getting rid of the industry<br />
is as firm and as absolute as ever, and Mr Hayden has<br />
reaffirmed that since the conference. They are just saying<br />
instead of putting a knife through the industry thev<br />
are going to phase it out, but they don't even say existing<br />
contracts can be allowed to contine. The phase-out could<br />
be in three months or six months, it could be in three weeks<br />
and still comply with the conference resolution. The<br />
concept of the social wage, the union movement won't buy<br />
that. It has already been condemned by the AMSWU and the<br />
Labor Party seems to be getting closer and closer to that<br />
particular union and to the letadership of that particular<br />
union. Obviously, a Labor Government would be significantly<br />
influenced by the affairs and policies of the Amalgamated<br />
Metal Workers' Union if they were ever in office.. That again<br />
is not something that the people of Australia would want.<br />
People are not going to buy this. There are real problems<br />
ahead and it-would be quite the wrong time to have a. Government:<br />
that'didn't have stable, sensible policies. It would be<br />
quite the wrong time to have a Labor Government that would<br />
clearly be , subject to the dictates of unions like the AMSWU. </p>
