Interview with the Prime Minister.<br />
Reeves; In general terms, how would you rate the governments<br />
performance, over the last two years. Bet ter than you thought.<br />
Whitlam; We have been a very active government. I think we have done<br />
more legislatively and adminstratively in our two years<br />
than our predecosors did in their last 20 years. Of course we have<br />
had ourt frustrations. We would havu likud to havu donu more. But<br />
nevertheless, we in fact are achiving a very great deal of what<br />
we promised.<br />
Reeves. Is there any area of personal satisfaction to you.<br />
Whitlam,' I suppose I would be partocularly pleased at the different<br />
standing that this country has in the world. We were embroiled still,<br />
long after most countries had ceased to be, in this cold war<br />
attitude. Secondly, we had been pointed into a corner in our<br />
region, the same way that Souhh Africa has been in the continent of<br />
Africa. We were seen as a racaist enclave. Now, we have rid ourselves<br />
of those two objectionable situations, the cold war and the racist<br />
attitude. But on top of that we have con ributed very postively to<br />
new programs around the world, human rights, disarmament and trade.<br />
This has given me vory much satisfaction naturally.<br />
Reeves. Foreign affairs is still': obviously, avery great love<br />
of yours.<br />
Whitlam; Oh. yes. Naturally. I think Australia" as a somewhat<br />
isolated country, and a very large trading coun ry, must always be<br />
very much aware of relations between her and other countries.<br />
Reeves. Have any of your Ministers ferformend particularly well<br />
anyone you would like to single out.<br />
Whitlam@' Thisz is always an intidious thhng to answer.<br />
There are many Ministers who were well known before we beome a<br />
government, and who were therefore expected to do well. And they<br />
have. But there were several others who were not so well known<br />
before we became a government. I suppose I could identify some<br />
of them. Fred Daly, as leader of the House of Representatives,<br />
has been suparb Lionel Bowen as the Minister asuisting me,<br />
Ken Wredidt, as Minister for Agriculture and Rex Connor as Ministed<br />
foi Minerals and Energy. All of these have done superbly''' People<br />
were not aware of them two years ago, but they are very great and<br />
effective public figures now.<br />
Reeves. Perhaps an unfair question, but how do you think<br />
you have pefformed as Prime Minister.<br />
Whitlam. This is much more difficult for me to say, but<br />
I would guess , hat most people would concede that I would be the<br />
best available, shall I say.<br />
Reeves. In terms of Prime Ministers over the years. How do you think<br />
you would rate with people like Curtin and Menzies.<br />
Whitlam. I would rather be compared with people like Deakin, by<br />
way of achievements, and Curtin. Menzies, of course, was a superb<br />
tactician and practitioner. But believe the Prime Ministers who<br />
have been most effective in contiibuting to AustraLia has beer.<br />
Deakin and Curtin.<br />
Reeves. Looking to the future, </p>
<p>S 2.<br />
Reeves. Looking to the future, what are your governments main aims<br />
f% r the next 12 months.<br />
Whitlam. We want to continue these programs, and I suppose our<br />
programs fall into two principal categories. One is that there should<br />
be equality of opportunity as far as goveilments can achieve that, and<br />
adcondly, there should be a general enrichment of the quality of<br />
life. What we have wanted to do is to see that what governments have<br />
to do, should be available everywhere in Australia, irrespective of<br />
what people do and irrespective of where they live. We want to see<br />
that everybody shares in the benefits of those programs which<br />
governments, these days, have to initiate and accomplish.<br />
Reeves. o things like inflation and unemployment come as a shock<br />
to you.<br />
Whitlam. Yes, they have. There is no question that unemployment<br />
and inflation are much worse in Australia than anybody expected.<br />
They are throughout the western world. There is not a country with<br />
which we deal that is not hit to a completely unexpected, and<br />
unpredictable extent by these two problems, concurrent problems of<br />
unemployment and inflation. Every country in Western Europe and<br />
the United States, Canadau and Japan and New Zealand, all are suffering<br />
it. We are all infecting each other. We happen to be the countries<br />
whih are most developed in the world, which do most of the trade<br />
in tthe world. We just cant insulate ourselves, none of us-<br />
Reeves. Yesterday, the Party's Federal Secretary, David Coomb, said<br />
that, looking towards the future, some members of the Party were<br />
disullusioned and disinterested in the future of the Labor gover. ment.<br />
Have you felt this as well.<br />
Whitlam. I suppose some of the initial exhilaration has faded. But<br />
I believe that qhen people, who are Labor supporters, Labor members,<br />
come to relfect on what we have done, and the way we have overcome<br />
difficulties at home and abroado and weze were dealing with some of<br />
those abroad which have their inevitable effect on us, but also<br />
domesticly we have been beset by difficulties that nobady previous<br />
government has ever had. There has never been an. opposition which has<br />
been so cantankerous and negative. There has never been a federal<br />
gover ment which has come in for so much abuse,' constant abuse by<br />
so many state governments' But when you looki, despite all this,<br />
we have achieved immense things. Education. health, the facilities<br />
in our citids, the capital and provincial cities, the overseas trade<br />
agreements, we have made an immense improvement in the structure<br />
within which governments have to operate in this country.<br />
Reeves. Could I suggest that some of the abuse has come from members<br />
of en your own Party' or members outside the Parliament.<br />
Whitla. This would be so. I mean, you are a very skilled practitiioner<br />
in the media, and you know if anybody in government says something, the<br />
technique is to go aroun4 and solicit opinions from people who might<br />
not ia be attracted to what it has done. Of course, you can always get<br />
off the cuff criticisms from people. I am sure there are quite a lot<br />
of favorable responses, but they are not publicised" So, it is a fair<br />
enough tednique, but we are all familiar with it.<br />
Reeves. Do you think there are too many nervous nellies belly aching<br />
in the Party about things which the government has not done, or<br />
which people think should have been done.<br />
Whitlam: Yes, there is quite an amount of this. But this is<br />
understandable in politics. The people to whom you so kindly and<br />
gently refer are very often those who have sought office in the </p>
