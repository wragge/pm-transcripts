PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW WITH GREG HUNTING, RADIO 2LM,<br />
LISMORE 16 AUGUST 1990<br />
E OE PROOF ONLY<br />
HUNTING: Mr Hawke, welcome to Lismore and to 2LM.<br />
PM: Thank you very much Greg. Thank you very much indeed.<br />
HUNTING: As I said, the most successful Labor leader and<br />
the second longest serving Prime Minister. Also great<br />
election success at times when the economy's been tough,<br />
high interest rates. It's surprised a lot of people that<br />
you were able to be so successful. What's the secret to Bob<br />
Hawke's success?<br />
PM: Well I don't think any person and perhaps particularly<br />
the person himself can give the right weighting to all the<br />
factors that go into outcomes. I hope that some of my own<br />
abilities are part of the answer Greg. I certainly hope and<br />
think that my capacity to relate to the Australian people is<br />
part of it. But even more importantly than that I think<br />
that the Australian electorate is a different electorate now<br />
than it was say at the beginning of the 80s. I think it's<br />
more sophisticated. I think if you tell them, as I have on<br />
so many occasions, that things are pretty tough, that some<br />
hard decisions have to be taken, that if you're honest with<br />
them and direct I think they'll respond. Therefore there's<br />
a greater necessity for oppositions to government to come up<br />
with not just criticisms of the government that's in, but a<br />
credible alternative. So I think my success and the success<br />
of the Labor Party under my leadership has been a<br />
combination of our abilities, which I think we have plenty,<br />
the weakness of the opposition in not giving credible<br />
alternatives and all of that in the context of an electorate<br />
which I think is getting more sophisticated.<br />
HUNTING: What future goals are there for Bob Hawke? You've<br />
achieved an awful lot in your lifetime? Another term<br />
perhaps? PM: I certainly want to make this fourth term a very<br />
constructive term Greg. There are things to be done which I<br />
think are important for the future of the country and I want<br />
to make it a successful fourth term. I'd like to lead the<br />
Party into the next election to another victory. I think<br />
then, at some stage during that next period, I'd probably<br />
then say it was time to move on. But my real objective Greg<br />
is to try and lay the foundations for a more competitive<br />
Australia to go into the 21st Century, one where people </p>
<p>understand that all of us, and that means individuals, trade<br />
unions, employers, governments, have to be prepared to<br />
forego some of the assumptions of the past which may have<br />
been relevant to an easier period but which are impediments<br />
to becoming more competitive now.<br />
HUNTING: Right. We might move on. One thing we did do<br />
today, we invited listeners to phone in any questions they<br />
may have for you. We have a few. But one that did come up<br />
over and over again, and I guess it's a question that's very<br />
much in your mind too at the moment, is the Middle East<br />
situation. PM: Sure.<br />
HUNTING: It's obviously causing a lot of concern. Could<br />
you just explain the rationale behind that commitment.<br />
PM: Yes Greg. Obviously it will take a little bit of time<br />
to answer, it's a very important question. Let me say this,<br />
that I've said recently. Paradoxically while this is the<br />
most serious decision I've had to take as Prime Minister, in<br />
the end it was not a difficult decision because the issues<br />
are clear. We are entering a new period of international<br />
affairs with the ending of the conflict between the super<br />
powers. That's important because it opens up the<br />
possibilities of an era of peace. But that means that we're<br />
on trial as an international community in terms of our<br />
capacity to make sure that in that new period if there is a<br />
threat to basic principles of civilised international<br />
relationships then we have to be prepared as an<br />
international community that we won't tolerate that.<br />
Now what we witnessed recently was a blatant attempt by a<br />
relatively large power in regard to a small neighbour to say<br />
we're going to invade you, we're going to obliterate you as<br />
a separate identity, we're going to absorb you. Now if the<br />
world was prepared to stand aside and accept that then no<br />
principles of civilised and viable relationships between<br />
nations would be possible. So in those circumstances it was<br />
appropriate that firstly the United Nations made the<br />
decisions in regard to sanctions that it did and then it was<br />
appropriate that there should be a response as well to the<br />
request for assistance that came from Kuwait. I believe<br />
very much Greg that with the tradition that Australia has<br />
had where we have been prepared, if necessary, to fight for<br />
the protection of these principles of civilised<br />
international relationships, that's the tradition of<br />
Australia. That it was not conceivable to me that in this<br />
sort of situation that we shouldn't be placing our forces at<br />
the disposal of this state that had in fact been invaded and<br />
in regard to which there'd been this attempted annexation.<br />
HUNTING: The Iraqis of course have a very poor record on<br />
human rights, the use of chemical weapons, that sort of<br />
thing. PM: Against their own people too. </p>
<p>HUNTING: Exactly. I just wondered whether you might care<br />
to comment on a report out of Canberra this afternoon that<br />
up until two weeks ago Australia had actually approved the<br />
sale of military hardware to Iraq. It's been cancelled<br />
since the United Nations move but it was in fact I think<br />
$ 850,000.<br />
PM: It was just under a million dollars worth of aircraft<br />
spares. We immediately cancelled that. In terms of the<br />
supply of arms that's taken in place in the past to Iraq,<br />
and that was in the context of the Iraq-Iran conflict, this<br />
less than a million dollars is nothing. But nevertheless<br />
HUNTING: It's the principle isn't it?<br />
PM: It's the principle, and it had to be stopped.<br />
HUNTING: Yes, and I just wondered, the justification though<br />
of actually supplying a country that would use chemical<br />
weapons against its own people. That was a fact then and<br />
yet we still approve of the sale of arms<br />
PM: I think that's a legitimate observation.<br />
HUNTING: The same with Pakistan of course. We're selling<br />
jets there.<br />
PM: That situation where they were, it was open for world<br />
wide tender. It wasn't specifically saying we will sell<br />
them to Pakistan. That was the best offer that was made.<br />
But we've made it clear, let me say, that if it became clear<br />
that there was going to be an outbreak of hostilities<br />
between Pakistan and India then we would be reviewing that.<br />
HUNTING: Let's move onto some local issues now. As I<br />
mentioned before we invited people to phone up and you've<br />
got your headphones on there. You might like to have a<br />
listen to a few questions that came our way today.<br />
CALLER: ( inaudible)<br />
PM: We don't want to take over the question of the<br />
education of children. This convention is one that's been,<br />
that we haven't rushed into. We've studied all the<br />
implications of it. We've consulted widely within the<br />
community. Other likeminded nations have made the decision<br />
that it is a sensible thing to do in terms of the protection<br />
of children. In this country of course, being a very<br />
advanced sort of country, it's not an issue where we need so<br />
much the protection of a United Nations convention any more<br />
than, if you take the International Labor Organisation, that<br />
we need the protection of the resolutions and conventions of<br />
the International Labor Organisation. But it is important<br />
that the international community sets standards like this<br />
and that advanced countries like Australia play their part<br />
because there are many countries in the world where what we<br />
take for granted as the basic rights of children are abused<br />
in other countries. So it's a case of Australia by its </p>
<p>example trying to exert an influence elsewhere. We don't<br />
need so much that protection in this country because we've,<br />
over time, come to accept these standards. But it will have<br />
no impact in terms of the basic relationship that exists in<br />
this civilisedi community between the twin responsibilities<br />
of families for their own children and of governments to<br />
provide educational facilities.<br />
CALLER: ( inaudible)<br />
PM: Well in regard to unemployment, let me say, as Greg<br />
said I am now about seven and a half years into this job.<br />
When I came to office unemployment in this country was<br />
horrendous. We'd had the worst recession we'd had in<br />
years. We have changed that by the simple fact, just a<br />
simple stastic which no-one can or does challenge, that in<br />
the period I've been in office we've had a rate of<br />
employment growth which has been twice as fast as the rest<br />
of the industrialised world, twice as fast. And that has<br />
created a situation in which there are many many more<br />
employment opportunities for Australians than there've been<br />
before. I accept the fact, having said that and having<br />
stated that record of which I'm proud, it is the case that<br />
in the last twelve months we've had to slow down the level<br />
of activity in this country to some extent because of a<br />
simple fact. Let me give it to you. That in that previous<br />
year our consumption in this country had increased by eight<br />
per cent and our production by four per cent. And that gap<br />
we were just making up by bringing in imports. We weren't<br />
producing enough to sustain that level of imports. We had<br />
to lower the level of activity and to some extent that will<br />
marginally increase unemployment. If we hadn't done that we<br />
would have, down the track, had a much more unsustainable<br />
economic and employment situation. The second part of your<br />
question went to small business. Let me say this in regard<br />
to that part of your question, that I am very conscious of<br />
the fact that around Australia and particularly in this<br />
area, small businesses are very important in the whole<br />
economic fabric of the community. We in fact, in the period<br />
of the last Parliament, established under Mr Beddall who was<br />
then a backbencher, a committe to report on the question of<br />
small business and what should be done. That brought in a<br />
very detailed report to us and it is interesting that now Mr<br />
Beddall who chaired that committee is the Minister for Small<br />
Business. We've already acted on some of the<br />
recommendations of the report and we'll be considering now<br />
each of those recommendations in the near future. Now, we<br />
are particularly aware of the problem that you referred to<br />
about the tight monetary conditions and the availability of<br />
capital and we are in fact sending a reference to the<br />
Industry Commission to inquire into this question of the<br />
availability of capital which will include, in particular,<br />
an investigation of the requirements of small business.<br />
Having said that in regard to small business in particular<br />
let me make this general observation in regard to interest<br />
rates. I'm not a person who wants to either punish myself<br />
I'm not a masochist and I don't want to punish others<br />
I'm not a sadist. No politician who has the beginnings of </p>
<p>any sense is going to have interest rates for one day higher<br />
than they need be. But we had to reduce this level of<br />
activity so that we could have a sustainable level of<br />
imports and monetary policy had to play its part in that.<br />
This year we've twice reduced the level of interest rates.<br />
We'll reduce them further when we believe it's safe to do<br />
so. HUNTING: Right. We want to move on to some other local<br />
issues too. Of course one big one up here, and I'm sure<br />
you're well aware of it, is roads, the condition of the<br />
Pacific Highway, funding for roads. We have a situation<br />
here where just last year the Lismore City Council was<br />
actually ploughing up bitumen roads, turning them back into<br />
gravel because they say they don't have the funds to<br />
maintain roads. Can we expect any relief in that area?<br />
PM: Well in regard to roads generally we've, in our period<br />
of government, significantly increased in real terms the<br />
amount of funding available for roads. I'm very very<br />
conscious Greg of the concern in this region generally about<br />
the Pacific Highway generally. I hope you'll recall that on<br />
the 14th of May my Minister for Land Transport, Bob Brown,<br />
together with the NSW Minister for Transport announced a<br />
package, a joint package of Commonwealth and NSW funding for<br />
the Pacific Highway which will see about $ 3 million expended<br />
over the next three years. In terms of comparisons that<br />
would represent about a trebling of the amount spent over<br />
the previous three years. We will use that money to address<br />
the most pressing needs to have extra overtaking lanes and<br />
to straighten out dangerous bends and curves. In the wider<br />
sense we've got the $ 100 million blackspot program. Part of<br />
that will be relevant here. And even more broadly than that<br />
we've recently established Greg the Australian, the National<br />
Road Trauma Advisory Council. In setting that up I'm going<br />
to try and draw upon a whole range of expertise available in<br />
this country to make recommendations to us as to the sorts<br />
of things that we should be doing to deal with what are very<br />
real problems.<br />
HUNTING: Part of the complaint also from Local government,<br />
and this is from the Local Government Association, is that<br />
for the third year running, funding, federal grants have<br />
actually dropped in real terms. They're saying this year it<br />
may be a case of people having to pay to use libraries and<br />
again further reduction in road and footpath maintenance.<br />
PM: Let me make these points about funding to Local<br />
government. It has been recognised, and publicly<br />
recognised, by the Australian Local Government Association<br />
that this Government has done more, not just in terms of<br />
funding but also in recognition of the importance of local<br />
government, than has ever been done before. Because I've<br />
always believed that local government is an area which is<br />
too much under-recognised. We get the highlights and the<br />
exposure federally and so do State governments to some<br />
extent. But as far as individuals are concerned, local<br />
government is with them in an everyday sense. We've done </p>
<p>all that we can to try and lift the availability of funds<br />
and their exposure. However, having said that, we have had<br />
as part of the exercise of restraint that's required of<br />
government so that we can free funds up and the savings of<br />
the community for the private sector, we've had to call upon<br />
the State government sector and the Local Government sector<br />
to share the restraint that we've shown. In the last four<br />
years there have been successively four years of real<br />
reductions in Commonwealth outlays on our own expenditures<br />
as we've tried to free up funds for investment by the<br />
private sector. We've had to ask the State government area<br />
and Local government to play some part in that.<br />
HUNTING: Right, also still on Local Government, it's an<br />
issue again that's a bit, if I can say tricky, up here and<br />
it's a question of this $ 200 peak hour landing fee at Sydney<br />
airport. The Mayor of Grafton has suggested that his city<br />
may lose its air services altogether because only small<br />
aircraft operate out of Grafton and when you add $ 200 to the<br />
fare it becomes quite a deal more expensive. Are you going<br />
to stick by that decision for that increase to landing fees.<br />
PM: Yes, but this has got to be seen in the context of the<br />
chaotic congestion of Kingsford-Smith airport. What the<br />
background of this, Greg, is that changes to licensing of<br />
intra-state, within-state commuter services, changes to<br />
those licensing requirements by the NSW government have<br />
simply resulted in a very significant increase, a very<br />
significant increase in the number of peak period communter<br />
services that are using Kingsford-Smith airport. Those<br />
decisions of the NSW government have just added very very<br />
significantly to the congestion of that airport. You have<br />
the situation where the small commuter planes take up as<br />
much time, demand as much resources as a jumbo full of 400<br />
or 500 people. We are not saying to the commuter services<br />
that Kingsford-Smith airport is not available to them.<br />
We've simply got to make a range of decisions which relieve<br />
that congestion which is particularly pressing in the peak<br />
periods. The peak periods are essentially in the morning<br />
between 7 and 9 and the evening between 4.30 and 7.30. Now<br />
if they make arrangements so that they don't congest, go<br />
into that period, then they don't meet this extra charge.<br />
HUNTING: Local business people though do feel that if they<br />
want to go to Sydney or have to go to Sydney for the day<br />
they should be able to go in the morning and come home in<br />
the evening rather than go, as you say, off-peak. It is a<br />
very sore issue in the area for that reason.<br />
PM: I can understand that but I also think that, I mean,<br />
people here look at the issue and say well look, we've got a<br />
great congestion at Kingsford-Smith airport, very very great<br />
congestion, it's important for Australia, and they are part<br />
of the country, it's terribly important for this country<br />
that we free up, as far as we can, operations of that<br />
airport for business reasons and certainly including for<br />
tourist reasons. We simply won't be able to do that if we<br />
say that in those peak periods very small aircraft, or just </p>
<p>relatively a handful of people are going to be able to<br />
increasingly clog up the airport. So we've got to adopt<br />
measures like this and of course what we're doing, as you<br />
know, is looking at the question of the extension of<br />
Kingsford-Smith airport and we're also, when that<br />
environmental study and consideration of that is completed,<br />
that extension may take place. We're also planning for,<br />
into the future, for the growth of a second airport at<br />
Badgerys Creek. But it would be simply irresponsible if we<br />
said well we don't give a damn about this congestion, we'll<br />
muck up the whole of our economy, our economic operations,<br />
by allowing that congestion to get worse and worse. I<br />
understand that creates some inconvenience. It's not done<br />
to create inconvenience but we've got to tackle the larger<br />
problems.<br />
HUNTING: Right. Any timetable on when a decision may be<br />
made on the third runway?<br />
PM: I understand that the processes of the Environmental<br />
Impact Statement are very very well advanced now. We'll be<br />
in a position I can't give you an exact date but it won't<br />
be too long into the future before we're considering that<br />
report.<br />
HUNTING: Fine, ok. Well finally, Mr Hawke, the election<br />
result of the recent federal election here on the North<br />
Coast must have delighted you.<br />
PM: Of course it did Greg. Let me say this, that on the<br />
Thursday night before the election I had some people at<br />
Kirribilli House. After they'd left, Steve Loosley, then<br />
the NSW Secretary of the Party, stayed behind. We were just<br />
having a cup of tea together and he said well we will<br />
deliver Page to you. I said thank you very much. And he<br />
said and let me tell you this he said watch Richmond<br />
very closely. I said you're kidding. He said I'm not. So<br />
I wasn't altogether unforewarned about it but I'm terribly<br />
pleased with the result. Let me, without being overtly or<br />
overly partisan in my comments, I think really these<br />
considerations were relevant. I think really there were<br />
three considerations involved. Firstly I'm not putting<br />
these in order of importance, but I think these three<br />
factors are involved Greg. Firstly there's obviously been a<br />
considerable change in the demography of the two<br />
electorates. They're not just essentially rural-based<br />
operations although those rural operations remain important.<br />
There's been an influx of people with different backgrounds<br />
and subject to different influences and so on, but that's<br />
obviously been one factor. Secondly, and as I say, I don't<br />
want to make because I don't go around the country<br />
bagging my political opponents. If I think they're wrong on<br />
an issue I'll attack them on that. But quite clearly, the<br />
status of the National Party has suffered over recent years<br />
in the northern part of NSW and in Queensland<br />
HUNTING: ICAC in Queensland, yes. </p>
<p>( Ip ends 8<br />
PM: and the National Party candidates suffered from that.<br />
And thirdly, and very importantly, the quality of the<br />
candidates we offered. Here in Richmond Neville Newell was<br />
a fresh face and obviously a man of concern and compassion<br />
and integrity. As in Page we had in Harry there, Harry<br />
Woods, a bloke who was obviously a good candidate. So those<br />
three factors, I can't give you the exact weighting of them.<br />
But I think those three things, plus fourthly the fact that<br />
people while they may not have liked some of the things<br />
we've done thought we could tackle hard issues. How you<br />
weight those four things I don't know, but they were the<br />
things that counted.<br />
BUNTING: Yes, there was a very big, obviously a very big<br />
independent vote too I think. In fact the Labor vote<br />
actually went down as did all the major parties votes in the<br />
area. But it was a very interesting result. Mr Hawke, for<br />
your time this afternoon we thank you very much.<br />
PM: Greg, I've enjoyed it very much. Thank you to you and<br />
to your listeners. </p>
