PRIME MINISTER PRESS STATEMENT NO. 446<br />
11 FEBRUARY 1975<br />
THE LATE MR A. E. MONK, C. M. G.<br />
I was deeply distressed to learn of the death<br />
of Mr Albert Monk. The length, quality and devotion of<br />
his service to the trade union movement were without<br />
parallel in Australia. He served the A. C. T. U as its<br />
president or secretary for 35 years.<br />
His great achievement was to preserve the<br />
solidarity and integrity of the industrial movement in<br />
Australia at a time when ideological conflicts were<br />
dividing it in other countries and threatening to divide<br />
it in Australia. No one understood better the proper<br />
relationship between the industrial and political wings<br />
of the Labor movement and worked harder or more successfully<br />
to maintain harmony and co-operation between them.<br />
Millions of Australian employees are indebted to him.<br />
On behalf of the Government I express my profound sympathy<br />
to his widow and family.<br />
CANBERRA. A. C. T. </p>
