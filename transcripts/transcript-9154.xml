PRIME MINISTER<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
COMMONWEALTH DAY 1994<br />
The strength in diversity that is a unifying feature of the Commonwealth of<br />
Nations is reflected in the theme chosen for this year's Commonwealth Day<br />
Sport.<br />
The Commonwealth Games, to be held in Canada in August, encapsulate<br />
one of the most notable aspects of the Commonwealth the coming together<br />
of people and countries from all continents in a spirit of participation and<br />
healthy competition.<br />
Commonwealth Day 1994 also sees us only a few weeks away from historic<br />
elections in South Africa elections which owe much to the efforts of<br />
Commonwealth countries in maintaining pressure for change.<br />
The significant role of the Commonwealth in encouraging respect for<br />
democracy will be highlighted through a distinguished Commonwealth<br />
observer group, electoral officials, and other personnel assisting with the<br />
South African transition process, including representatives from Australia.<br />
Although Australia's place in the world is changing, the Government<br />
continues to see value in our membership of the Commonwealth of Nations.<br />
We are encouraging the Commonwealth to respond similarly to global<br />
developments to ensure its continuing relevance to member states.<br />
I am looking forward to discussing this and other related issues when I meet<br />
with the Commonwealth Secretary-General, Chief Emeka Anyaoku, during his<br />
official visit to Australia at the end of this month.<br />
