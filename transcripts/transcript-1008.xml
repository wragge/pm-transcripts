FOR PRESS P0M. No 20/ 1964<br />
AIRLINES<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister the Rt. o_ Sir Robert Menzies<br />
The Prime Minister, Sir Robert Menzies, tonight<br />
released his reply to a letter he had received fromra the Premier<br />
of New South Wales, Mr. Renshaw, on Wednesday. The Prime<br />
Minister's reply reads<br />
" Your letter of October 20th seems to overlook<br />
the fact that it is only the commencement o2 your Air<br />
Transport Act, with its particularly harsh penalties,<br />
that can prevent a continuation of existing air services<br />
to Dubbo and Orange.<br />
There is, in the Commonwealth's view, no<br />
reason whatsoever why the existing air services should<br />
not continue while the question of conflicting Commonwealth<br />
and State laws is resolved. Your proposal is<br />
that a change be made pending legal challenge. That<br />
would, of course, be contrary to usual practice which is<br />
to maintain the status quo pending the determination of<br />
any legal issues. Despite what you say about previous judgments<br />
of the High Court and Privy Council, the truth. is that<br />
neither has considered the position as it now stands.<br />
The judgments to which you refer seem to me to have little<br />
bearing on current matters, except that some comments<br />
made in the High Court judgments sipport the view, upon<br />
which the Cormonwealth has acted, that the Commonwealth<br />
has wide powers in this field.<br />
As I see it, your letter attempts to present<br />
the matter in such a form that the blame in the public<br />
mind for any dislocation of air services will fall on the<br />
Common. ealth whereas, in fact, any dislocation of air<br />
services can only result from a decision of your Government<br />
not to defer the commencement of your new Transport<br />
Act. If your Government is determined to let your Act<br />
come into force, and not to allow the status quo to<br />
continue pending the litigation, you will understand that<br />
my Government will have to make it clear to the public<br />
who is responsible for any dislocation of services which<br />
results. R. G. MENZIES<br />
PRIME MINISTER."<br />
CANBERRA, 22nd October, 196-4. </p>
