    <content><![CDATA[<p>Today is a great day for the workers of Australia. The 30-year-low unemployment rate is fresh confirmation of my Government's strong economic record over the past 10 years.</p>
<p>The unemployment rate in May fell to 4.9 per cent, down from 5.1 per cent in April.</p>
<p> This is the first time the unemployment rate has been below five per cent since November 1976. The result is a wonderful symbol of the success of the Government's economic policies.</p>
<p>The fall in the unemployment rate occurred at the same time as the participation rate increased, a clear signal that more and more Australians are confident of finding work.</p>
<p>The number of people employed in May increased by 56,000, all of which was full-time work. Of these new jobs, female employment increased by 38,000.</p>
<p>This brings the total number of new jobs created since March 1996 to more than 1.8 million.</p>
<p>As the Government has consistently said Australia cannot afford to stand still. We can not take our prosperity for granted.</p>
<p>We must continue to embrace reform to keep the economy strong and help more Australians find work.</p>
<p>Last week we had the spectacle of the Australian Labor Party criticising new jobs in the Parliament.</p>
<p>Labor and the trade union movement will continue to run a scare campaign against workplace reform, but my Government will continue to make the right decisions to maintain the strength of the economy.</p>
