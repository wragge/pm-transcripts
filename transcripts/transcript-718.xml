" NO CONFIDENCE" MOTION<br />
Statement in the House of Representatives by the Rt, Hon,<br />
the Prime Minister, Sir Robert Menzies on fednesday, 3rd<br />
April, 1963.<br />
Mr. Speaker, the honourable member for Batman<br />
( Mr. Benson) is a very experienced pilot but he will forgive<br />
me when I say that during his speech I was very much struck<br />
by the fact that he was steering a course that gave the<br />
impression that he was shifting about in a five-knot ebb tide<br />
in the rip of Point Lonsdale. He will understand exactly what<br />
that means. I think he has fallen into the common error of<br />
thinking that referring a matter to the United Nations is in<br />
itself a constructive policy. Time after time it has become<br />
necessary to say that it is not. To go to the United Nations<br />
with a policy is one thing but to fall into the habit of saying<br />
that Cuba, for example, should have gone to the United Nations<br />
or that something else should hcve gone to the United Nations<br />
is not a policy at all. It is a more evasion of national<br />
responsibility and of national decision.<br />
The honourable member permitted himself to comment<br />
adversely he is not the only one to do so on the Opposition<br />
side about President Kennedy's handling of the Cuba incident<br />
and about this Government's instant declaration that we agreed<br />
with what President Kennedy had done. what do honourable members<br />
opposite want us to do? want to witness one of the really<br />
significant events in postwar history, a critical event which,<br />
if it had not been dealt with promptly and strongly by the<br />
President of the U. So, night have altered the whole balance of<br />
power in the worldo When the President of the USo. took in<br />
splendid terms a strong and definite attitude on these matters<br />
honcurable members opposite say, " Oh, it should have gone to the<br />
United Nations." I wonder whether honourable members know what<br />
they mean, Do they mean that the matter should have gone to<br />
the Security Council so that it could have boon neatly vetoed<br />
by the Soviet Union? That would have occupied a certain amount<br />
of time. In the meantime, the Soviet Union would have continued<br />
to put its weapons its missiles into Cuba, building a base<br />
close to the U. S. which could alter the entire balance of power<br />
in the world. Is that what honourable members opposite mean?<br />
No doubt it is. Then they would say: " Now that you come to<br />
mention it, of course the Soviet Union would veto it and so it<br />
would come to nothing. But then you can go to the Assembly and<br />
have a fortnight's debate. You can have all of the Communist<br />
satellites lined up and speech after speech made. All the time<br />
the Communist position in Cuba is being built up until ultimately<br />
the balance of power in the world is upset.<br />
Mr. Speaker these are very serious matters and if<br />
the Opposition's attitude is that the President of the U. S. was<br />
wrong and that we were wrong to be the first people to give our<br />
approval to the U. S, action, then the people of Australia might<br />
know about this. I think they will, and I think they might think<br />
about it. They might v.; onder whether they should entrust not<br />
only their economic affairs but also their security and their<br />
entire future to the people on the other side of this Parliament.<br />
S.. o o / 2 </p>
<p>2-<br />
Noiw., Sir, I speak as some sort of an expert on<br />
this matter. There are two objectives in the " no confidence"<br />
motion I know; I have been at the giving end and at the<br />
receiving end. There are two objectives and one is to put the<br />
Government out. That is an admirable attitude for an Opposition<br />
to have and it has taken an awful long time for this Opposition<br />
to decide on that attitude. But there it is to put the<br />
Government out. The other, of course, is, immediately or<br />
otherwise, to put the Opposition in. This would not be an<br />
unfair analysis to put us out and to put you in.<br />
For the purposes of simplicity I therefore propose<br />
to provide my ovam contribution tonighit into these twro aspects.<br />
I will say something about the first of them. I do not need<br />
to say as much as I otherwise would because later on in this<br />
debate my colleagues the Minister for Trade ( Mr. McEwen) and<br />
the Treasurer ( Mr. Harold Holt) will have admirable opportunities<br />
of dealing in detail with some of these matters. But I will<br />
not entirely let them go by.<br />
I therefore start by saying something about putting<br />
the Government out and the reasons for it. My distinguished<br />
friend the Leader of the Opposition ( 1r. Calwoll) has, of<br />
course, a professional gloom about the Australian econo. y. It<br />
is his duty to be depressed and, if possible, to depress other<br />
people. He therefore gave us a professionally gloomy account<br />
of Australia's present economic condition which was so much<br />
at variance with the facts as to be almost too ludicrous.<br />
I hope it was read overseas by people in other countries.<br />
They would, of course, burst into hilarious laughter, on looking<br />
at their own countries, to be told about this one which is in<br />
a state of economic disaster and depression.<br />
Mr. O'Brien That is not true.<br />
SIR ROBERT MENZIES Of course that is not true. After all,<br />
the Leader of the Opposition was careful to admit from his<br />
attack I will call it an attack all the material factors<br />
in the economic position. I do not recall him saying anything<br />
about the remarkable success of the Government's policy against<br />
inflation. There is laughter on both sides of the Chamber.<br />
I am familiar with all those chaps. They laugh on both sides<br />
of their faces. In one sense, members opposite laugh because<br />
they have always said inflation is silly talk and that it is<br />
a bogey and on the other side they laugh because they are not<br />
very pleased to have to admit in their hearts that the consumer<br />
price index has been stable now for years.<br />
Mr. Ward How does it compare with 1949?<br />
SIR ROBERT MENZIES I always know that I am scoring when<br />
some of you yell. But I do not worry myself about that. I<br />
am not addressing myself to the honourable member for East<br />
Sydney. Whenever I have addressed myself to East Sydney I<br />
have had to have police protection.<br />
We have a stable consumer price index. In other<br />
words, the inflationary processes in this country which were<br />
desperately dangerous a few years ago have been brought under<br />
control. Not a word about that. Not a word about the<br />
remarkable increase in the employment in Australia; not a word<br />
about the remarkable increase in production in Australia. / 3 </p>
<p>-3-<br />
It is all right. Some of the new boys will learn in due course<br />
that a few facts are much more important than some of the<br />
arguments that they present and even they cannot deny that<br />
there has been a most remarkable increase in production in<br />
this country in the last few years and a most remarkable<br />
increase in savings in this country, I go back a little while<br />
and I can remember Mr. Pollard Back to the eighteenth century.<br />
SIR ROBERT MENZIES And it was a very good century. Do you<br />
know why, Sir? Because it was a century of good sense.<br />
Mr. Allan Fraser You are an eighteenth century<br />
Prime Minister.<br />
SIR ROBERT MENZIES " Indeod", says the honourable member,<br />
" an eighteenth century Prime Minister." All I can say is that<br />
at the tail end of the eighteenth century they had some very<br />
good Prime Ministers and he might have been proud to be one<br />
of them. But he has forgotten his history. As I was saying,<br />
there have been increased savings. I can remember the time<br />
when my distinguished opponent, the Leader of the Opposition,<br />
used to say " Look at the way savings have fallen away. This<br />
is a sign that the Government is ineffective." Now, when he<br />
looks and sees that there are record savings, with another<br />
Å“ 2,000,000 in the savings banks he says " That is no good.<br />
This is a sign that people have no confidence in the future."<br />
You cannot satisfy some of these people. He does not say a<br />
word about the development works programme, except in one<br />
respect that I will come to in a minuteo He does not say<br />
a word about the record home building in Australia, an undoubted<br />
undeniable fact. He does not say a word about the record<br />
activity in building construction business construction<br />
in the cities not a word, Ho does not say a word about the<br />
public credit being high both here and overseas. He does not<br />
say a word about interest rates falling. He does not say a<br />
word except a hostile word about investment in this country<br />
from overseas. He does not say a word about the remarkable<br />
and increasing growth in the export of manufactures from<br />
Australia nothing about these. Yet the fact is and<br />
wherever you go you can encounter it that there is an<br />
increasing feeling in this country, oven among those who were<br />
critical, that the Government's policy has been right and<br />
that confidence in this country is building up every week and<br />
every month. Now, Sir having said that because I do not want to<br />
take up too much of my time on it and there will be other people<br />
who can deal with the details of this matter<br />
Mr. Cope You have gone a bit flat.<br />
SIR ROBERT MENZIES I have always noticed that when you are<br />
afriad to listen you make a noiseo Nowr, Sir, in the course of<br />
his speech the Leader of the Opposition was kind enough to<br />
make a glancing reference or two to me. At one stage he said<br />
that I was reported to have told my Federal executive something.<br />
All I can say is that I had never heard of the report until he<br />
mentioned it last night and it was quite untrue. I am sorry<br />
that he should read things from the gossip columns. He also<br />
referred to mo, and this fascinated me because I do not know<br />
whether it was a compliment or a subdued attack, as " the sole<br />
triton of post-war Liberalism". o 14 </p>
<p>4<br />
Mr. OtBrien That was a compliment.<br />
SIR ROBERT MENZIES I suppose he meant to con rey the<br />
impression that I was a triton among the minnows. This, I<br />
think, is overdoing it. Being a triton among the minnows is<br />
supposed to be a compliment to me and an offence to those<br />
who for so many years have been with me in the problems of<br />
this country. All I want to say to the honourable member<br />
he has exposed his flank a little on this is that to be<br />
a triton among the minnows is not half so bad as being a<br />
minnow among the 36 tritons who form the Labour Party and<br />
that is what, by concession, he is. He is the minnow swimming<br />
in and around among the tritons and coming up occasionally<br />
if a fish can listen and listening and diving down again;<br />
the minnow amont the 36 tritons.<br />
Mr. Einfeld What do you<br />
SIR ROBERT MENZIES Thank hoaven you were not one of them;<br />
otherwise there would have beun 35 tritons.<br />
I want to draw attention to just one point about<br />
this devastating " no confidence" motion. There are a dozen<br />
points I could deal with, but I have time to deal with only<br />
one. In a remarkable exercise of reasoning, the Leade:-of<br />
the Opposition conceded what had been done. In fact, he<br />
rehearsed it. He referred to substantial increases in loan<br />
money for State works, including of course housing; Federal<br />
works; selected development projects; special non-repiyable<br />
grants, most of which were in aid of employment; reduction<br />
of income tax; reduced sales tax on motor vehicles, which<br />
has produced the most extraordinary activity in the motor<br />
veiicle industry: increased employment benefit and investment<br />
allowances, le then disclosed the perfect, old-fashioned,<br />
dead-as-the-dodo socialist mind by saying, " Not one of those<br />
measures was designed to help the ordinary wage earners of<br />
this country." I hope that everybody in Australia will read<br />
that and ponder on it. Apparently, if we increase loan<br />
moneys, increase State works, increase housing and increase<br />
Federal works, this will be no good to the worker. That is his<br />
proposition. Those activities have nothing to do with the<br />
wage earner. Development projects such as Mt. Isa, the<br />
lostern Australian Railway or coal loading equipment at<br />
Gladstone and other ports, are no good to the wage earner.<br />
How odd that is. I always thought these things ware done by<br />
having people work on the job and being paid for it and by<br />
buying materials and having people paid to produce hem.<br />
But the Leader of the Opposition says, " No, they are no good."<br />
He referred to the reduced sales tax on motor vehicles. I<br />
ask you, Sir. Here we had an industry that had sustained a<br />
considerable reduction of production as a result of the<br />
policies we found neces3ary and the reduced sales tax together<br />
with the general restoration of industrial help has enabled it<br />
to employ thousands and thousands more people, not only<br />
directly but indirectly. The leader of the socialist party<br />
stands up and says 0000<br />
Mr. O'Brien Not socialist.<br />
SIR ROBERT MENZIES Is it not that any longer? Ohft He<br />
stands up and says that none of these things is any good to<br />
tha wage earner. I leave it at that because I want to say<br />
something about some other matters. So far I have said only<br />
a little on the matter of putting the Government out. Now </p>
<p>I would like to say something aboub the problem of putting<br />
the Opposition in, which is the other object of the exercise.<br />
If Labour is to go in, I think it is essential thatrot only<br />
we but also the people of Australia should know where they<br />
stand on the great issues confronting this countryo I have<br />
already explained that they do not quite know where they stand<br />
even on matters on which they attack us. But where do they<br />
stand on the matters on which I propose to attack them? They<br />
are putting themselves forward, as the alternative Government.<br />
Apparently they do so very confidently more confident today<br />
than they will be in a month's time; more confident in a<br />
month's time than they will be in a year's time. They know.<br />
They are not so silly as all that. However, they are putting<br />
themselves forward as the new Government. Now, Sir, what<br />
kind of a Government would this Labour Government be?<br />
Mr. Costa A good one,<br />
SIR ROBERT MENZIES If you are in it, I will be delighted.<br />
But what kind of a government would it be? The government, of<br />
course, would be the tired spokesman of 36 outsiders, none<br />
of them elected by the Australian people and any nineteen of<br />
them able to control the minds and the voices of a Labour<br />
government. As the honourable member for Higinbotham ( Mr.<br />
Chipp) said this afternoon, this is what is called democracy.<br />
It may have been different in the days when Labour had strong<br />
leaders, but it is not today when Labour has leaders who bow<br />
in the corridors and who wait for their orders and who then<br />
proceed as best they can to carry out their orders. In other<br />
words, the country is not being offered by Labour a government<br />
of people who will attack problems, exercise their own<br />
judgments and stand by their judgment, but people who will<br />
look around the corner and say to these obscure nonentities<br />
who give them their orders, " Please, what is it we are allowed<br />
to do. That is as clear as a pikestaff, and if it needed to<br />
be made clear, my honourable friend with his deputy leader<br />
made it clear at the last Federal Conference of the Australian<br />
Labour Party. A more humiliating spectacle could hardly be<br />
imaginedl Mro Pollard That is not what you said to Bry,<br />
You said, " Do it or else" o<br />
SIR ROBERT MENZIES: That was a Prime Minister; he was the<br />
leader. He was not a Prime Minister who had to go away to<br />
36 people and say, " Ploase oblige me by telling meo"<br />
Mr. Allan Fraser You are a one-man government.<br />
SIR ROBERT MENZIES The honourable member for Eden Monaro<br />
keeps muttering about a one-man government. If I am the Prime<br />
Minister of this country, I am the Prime Minister because the<br />
people have elected my supporters, who have chosen me. There<br />
is no parallel on my side of politics to this outside control<br />
by a group of 36, or any other number you care to choose,<br />
completely irresponsible people to whom the so-called leaders<br />
of the country would have to make their obeisance.<br />
The next comment I make about the Australian Labour<br />
Party, which wants to come in, is: Where does it stand on<br />
Malaya? After all, this country is a pretty remote country<br />
in the world. This country, as the whole of experience has<br />
shown, cannot in great emergencies be its own solo defender.<br />
It must do its best, but it cannot be its own sole defender. / 6 </p>
<p>6<br />
!: 1e have all found that time after time, and therefore we have<br />
a lively interest in what goes on<br />
Mr. Uren Who did you<br />
SIR ROBERT MENZIES If you do not mind I know your views<br />
are so far left of mine that I see them in a sunset haze.<br />
I know the honourable member is a little touchy on this, because<br />
it is he who has said it has been quoted that there is<br />
nothing to fear from Communist China, it has no ambitions.<br />
It is like Hitler; it has no territorial ambitions. It is<br />
not pressing on South-East Asia. That is the view of the<br />
honourable member for Reid, but who accepts it? Who, looking<br />
at what goes on in South-East Asia, could believe such sorry<br />
nonsense for half a minute. It is important, therefore, to<br />
know where Labour stands on Malaya, which happens to be a<br />
British country and a country of the Commonwealth of Nations<br />
not so very far to our north, friendly and loyal.<br />
The last decision they made and I cannot discover<br />
that it has ever be-n altered is that the Australian<br />
components of the Commonwealth Strategic Reserve in Malaya<br />
should be withdrawn. Now, I will be delighted to know whether<br />
that is still true. Apparently it is, A great silence falls<br />
over the ranks of the Labour Party. So, let it be observed by<br />
everybody concerned that by their silence they admit that that<br />
is still their policy. They will be given an opportunity<br />
overnight to find out from what is the chapts name?<br />
Chamberlain. But after all, the last authentic remark on this<br />
issue was made by the honourable member for Parkes ( Mr. Haylen)<br />
and as a front-bencher and as a loyal observer of the Constitution<br />
of the Labour Party what Lh said must be right. It must<br />
be official. He said, " We on this side of the chamber are<br />
assailed for saying that our troops ought to get out of Malaya.<br />
What has Malaya to do with us?"<br />
This is the Labour PartyJ What has Malaya to do with<br />
usl In other words, we cannot, says the Labour Party care<br />
less what happens in Malaya, Wo cannot care less if Malaya<br />
is over-run by the Communists. And, indeed, they had the<br />
non-aggressive Chinese Communists conducting activities of<br />
insurgency in Malaya and it was one of the honours of our<br />
battalion in Malaya from time to time to take part in resisting<br />
these people and in tracking them down. But the Labour Party<br />
says, " What has Malaya got to do with us?"<br />
Take their attitude towards the creation of Malaysia,<br />
This is very well described in that splendid newspaper, the<br />
Melbourne " Age" cnly this morning in a leading article. I<br />
will undertake to read a few lines from what the newspaper<br />
said because it puts it to perfection. It said, speaking<br />
about the Labour Party and its policy, now handed out in<br />
writing in W. A. by the boss weeks afterwards<br />
It believes in effective " decolonization"<br />
It is extraordinary how loft-wingwrs love these long words.<br />
Effective decolonization. The article continues<br />
of the three northern Borneo territories, but<br />
it passes no judgment on the proposal for incorporating<br />
British Borneo in Malaysia."<br />
And that is true Not a word about it. Silence. The Leader<br />
0** e 0 / 7 </p>
<p>7-<br />
of the Opposition incautiously said recently, when he was a<br />
free man that he thought it was a good idea, But now now.<br />
Nothing but silence now on that front. The " Age" article<br />
continues " The Partyts attitude towards Malaysia appears to<br />
the outsider to be mere double talk, and its<br />
failure to recognize the importance of the Commonwealth<br />
Strategic Reserve suggests a refusal to face<br />
facts."<br />
Then the " Age" goes on, charitably I think, to say<br />
" Flexibility is a useful quality in strange ways but<br />
it does not mean evading or postponing decisions.<br />
What the conference failed to give was a clearly<br />
formulated and presented foreign policy for a party<br />
which is Australia's alternative government."<br />
And then, with a superb but delicate touch of irony, the " Age"<br />
article concludes " Its Parliamentary leaders were entitled to expect<br />
more"<br />
I think this is gorgeous. I really think this is the finest<br />
journalistic sentence I have read this year<br />
" Normally the people expect the Parliamentary leaders<br />
of a great party to give a lead, to expound ideas in<br />
the partyto take decisions on policy."<br />
Then the " Age" with all its charity, says in the final paragraph<br />
" What a pity because the Parliamentary leaders of<br />
the Labour Party are not as other men. They have to<br />
be given something by Chamberlain and company and<br />
really it is very disappointing that they were not<br />
given more."<br />
This, Sir, I think. is not only a piece of delicate irony but in<br />
its fashion quite superb.<br />
Now, Sir, my time goes on and therefore I pass on to<br />
the next thing on which I am curious about the Labour Party's<br />
attitude. The Labour Party, this prospective government, the<br />
one that wants to come into office<br />
Mi. Einfeld Inevitably,<br />
SIR ROBERT MENZIES I do not object, my dear fellow, to your<br />
cheering yourself up in this fashion, I would in your position.<br />
Personally I wish you well. I think you would make a very good<br />
whatever-it-is. The Labour Party wants to have a nuclear-free<br />
zone south of the equator. May I take it that that is still<br />
Labour Party policy?<br />
Mr. Einfeld Hear! Hear.<br />
SIR ROBERT MENZIES Thank you very much. I knew that if I<br />
were nice to you, you would respond. This is still the Labour<br />
Party's policy. Of course, this idea of having an area south<br />
of the equator and round the world in which no nuclear weapons<br />
can be deployed sounds very attractive and a lot of Labour .6.0./ 8 </p>

the other people of the southern hemisphecre to agree to it<br />

Mr. Einfeld No.<br />

any timre, Mr. O'Brien T1 will be very simplpe, too, aCO* OS0/ </p>
<p>-9-<br />
SIR ROBERT MENZIES Yes, it will be very simple. I quite<br />
agree. The truth of the matter is that the Labour Party has<br />
to give up trying to have it both ways. You advocate a<br />
nuclear-free zone south of the equator, because this pleases<br />
your Communist supporters, and then, in the next breath, to<br />
satisfy your right-wingers, who are sensible and decent people,<br />
you say, " That does not mean what it says". What in the name<br />
of fortune does it mean?<br />
Perhaps the honourable member for the Australian<br />
Capital Territory ( Mr. J, R. Fraser) who is interjecting, might<br />
devote some of his attention to writing a powerful article for<br />
the " Canberra Times", explaining that this does not mean that<br />
nuclear weapons cannot be deployed from Australian territory,<br />
even though Australia is under attack, Mr, Speaker, if you<br />
can hear me over the gutter noises of East Sydney, I just want<br />
to say that the attitude of the Labour Party's conference to<br />
the North West Cape installation is of a piece with the<br />
isolationism exhibited in that party's attitude cowards a<br />
nuclear-free zone. It is a natural corollary. Opposition<br />
members now say, I think, that by a vote of nineteen to seventeen<br />
they got something through which disappointed us. I hope they<br />
have all read what they got through.<br />
You know, Sir, there is a very odd thing about this<br />
last Labour Party conference. On the matter of North West<br />
Cape a matter of immediate and vital importance to the<br />
people of Australia no written document was handed out at<br />
all, Did honourable members notice that? On the contrary, the<br />
master naturally not the Leader of the Opposition came out<br />
and read to the press, quite quickly, from a piece of paper.<br />
That is all they have ever had. I thought at the time, " This<br />
is pretty good, because this will always give them the<br />
opportunity of saying that they ewre misreported and that that<br />
was not what they decided." The other day, in the fastnesses<br />
of Perth Mr. Harding What is wrong with Perth?<br />
SIR ROBERT MENZIES Nothing, It is one of the finest cities<br />
in Australia. I have always had an ambition to live there. I<br />
am thinking of that quite seriously. All I can say is that in<br />
the fastnesses of Porth the master produced, in writing, the<br />
decisions that the conference had made. There was nothing in<br />
the document about North 1est Cape. Of course, Sir, the whole<br />
basis of this thing is that the Labour Party has gone back,<br />
after a much better interlude at one time to its isolationist<br />
attitude towards the problems of the world. It wants to say<br />
to the Unitea States, " Certainly we do not mind your spending<br />
on a radio communications station. That is very nice.<br />
Thank you very much, do not mind your using it for naval<br />
communications in time of peace as long as we are the joint<br />
owners and managers, although we will not pay for it. But if<br />
the occasion occurs when you really need naval communications<br />
more than at any other time, then, although you are our<br />
associate in ANZUS and SEATO and we know, as people of common<br />
sense, that you and your friendship are vital to us, we want<br />
you to understand that you cannot use the station urdss the<br />
Australian Government of the day happens to say that you can,"<br />
I have heard a lot of people saying that the establishment<br />
of this station is an invasion of our sovereignty. Our<br />
sovereignty has been invaded before, as the Labour Government 0 00 0 0 </p>
<p>10<br />
of the past well knows I suppose it was an invasion of<br />
our sovereignty when all the forces in Australia were put<br />
under a foreign command. Nobody complained about that,<br />
It was a jolly good cause. Is it not a fact also that this<br />
technical sovereignty of ours was so far invaded that members<br />
of the American forces, although they were in Austlalia and<br />
might commit crimes in Australia, were removed from the<br />
jurisdiction of the Australian courts and placed under<br />
American jurisdiction? I am not complaining about that.<br />
I would have done exactly the same thing under the same<br />
circumstances. But this, we are now told, is the kind of<br />
thing that is an invasion of our sovereignty. The Labour<br />
Party of those days understood pretty wel that to subtract<br />
from your own sovereignty by exercising it in favour of a<br />
friend is much more important than losing it all to an<br />
enemy. Mr, McGuren Who criticised the Government?<br />
SIR ROBERT MENZIES 1 do not know. I did not. If it is<br />
any comfort, I say to you now that that was right. Why do<br />
you now say it was wrong? have heard all this cackle<br />
about sovereignty and we lhave heard it said that we must<br />
not allow the AJericans to come in here and have rights,<br />
Finally, Sir, with three minutes to go<br />
Mr. Armitage Economic issues?<br />
SIR ROBERT MENZIES No. I am dealing with issues which you<br />
detest but which will determine in the minds of the Australian<br />
people whether you will get an opportunity to ruin this<br />
country. Apart from paying lip-service to the United Nations,<br />
where does the Labour Party stand? Why, it was only in 195<br />
that Dr. Evatt proposed to save 40M from the defence vote,<br />
so he obviously thought that it was much too much. The<br />
hcnourable member for Reid ( M r. Uren) pithily expressing<br />
himself in 1960, said, "' DisarmS" In October, 1960, in the<br />
same debate, the honourable member for Lalor ( Mr. o ollard)<br />
said that a police force, pending the arrival of the United<br />
Nations, was all that we needed. The honourable member for<br />
Lao is a gallant and distinguished member of this Parliament,<br />
Ho is an old friend of mine, But he was exhibiting a point<br />
of view on this matter, In October, 1960, the honourable<br />
member for Yarra ( Mr, Cairns) said that we should supply<br />
troops to the United Nations and nowhere olseo<br />
Now, Sir, how do you sum it all up? Here is a<br />
party that wants to be put into office, It is dubious and,<br />
indeed, isolationist in its attitude to defence. It has a<br />
dangerous attitude towards a nuclear-free zone. It has an<br />
unreal and evasive attitude on Malaya. It is divided on the<br />
reality of our association with the United States, as<br />
exemplified by the North-West Cape installation, Above all<br />
things it has a dismal position as the humble but obedient<br />
servanG as the lackey, I think that is the Communist<br />
expression of the outside body now famous in history as<br />
the 36o </p>
