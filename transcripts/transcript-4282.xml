ijjU~ rA~~ Ni O. F. 76/ 255 L<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR PRESS T. a t\ 29 NOVEMBER 1976<br />
SOUTH AUSTRALIAN CHAMBER OF COMMERCE<br />
I am very pleased to be here tonight to discuss with y~ ou some<br />
of the major issues confronting Australia, and the Government's<br />
approach to these issues.<br />
In the light of yesterday's set of economic measures, this is<br />
a particularly appropriate time to discuss the Government's<br />
approach. I should, however, say at the outset that the<br />
central task facing all of us achieving a soundly based<br />
economic recovery is not something that the Government can<br />
achieve alone. It is a task which we all must share. We all<br />
have an interest in economic recovery. lie all have the ability<br />
to make some contribution to achieving that end.<br />
The Government has constantly said and I repeat our top<br />
priority is the defeat of inflation.<br />
In order to achieve this objective, the Government must pursue<br />
its economic policies in a balanced way a way which is equitable<br />
in its impact across the community. All the objectives that<br />
Australians share are linked to defeating inflation. Increasing<br />
employment opportunities, reducing interest rates, acting to<br />
assist the disadvantaged in our society they are all<br />
dependent on our ability to cope with inflation.<br />
In achieving this, the Government must give proper attention<br />
to all four arms of economic policy the budgetary, monetary,<br />
external and wages policy.<br />
Tonight, I would like-to outline how this Government has used<br />
the four arms of economic policy in pursuing economic recovery.<br />
the maintenance of the balance between the various<br />
arms was the premise underlying yesterday's measures.<br />
To adequately understand our approach it is necessary to understand<br />
what happened under the Government preceding us.<br />
1-</p>
<p>The roots of Australia's economic problems the severe<br />
inflation, unemployment, high interest rates and a record<br />
deficit derived from the role assumed by Government in<br />
the economy between 1973/ 75. In these years, the Government<br />
operated on the basis of fundamentally misconceived ideas<br />
about the role and capacity of Government in economic policy.<br />
TI-ese misconceptiors gave rise to a number of important<br />
consequences between 1973/ 75:<br />
For a time, rational budgetary policy<br />
dissolved.<br />
wages and prices policies were pursued<br />
which had disastrous consequences for<br />
business profits and employment opportunities.<br />
Concurrently, monetary and external policies<br />
being implemented had the effect of disturbing<br />
the economic environment.<br />
On the budgetary side:<br />
In 1973/ 74 the groundwork was laid for a massive<br />
expansion in Government expenditure at a time when<br />
private demand pressures were becoming excessive.<br />
1974/ 75 saw an effort to counter unemployment by<br />
greater public spending. There was an increase<br />
of 46% in Federal Government spending.<br />
This accelerated inflation and unemployment rose by some<br />
180,000.<br />
On the wages side:<br />
The Government encouraged large increases in wages.<br />
The wages share of G. D. P. rose substantially<br />
while the profits share fell.<br />
Inevitably high unemployment and inflation resulted.<br />
On the monetary side:<br />
The excessive growth of Government spending fed<br />
into excessive liquidity<br />
Consequently, excessive weight had to be placed<br />
on monetary policy which led to a credit squeeze.<br />
This was however followed by a resurgence of<br />
monetary growth.<br />
On the external side:<br />
Attempts were made to offset inflationary pressures sustained<br />
by the Government's domestic policy.<br />
2-</p>
<p>The 25% across the board tariff cut partly<br />
intended to counter inflationary pressures<br />
again served to promote instability,<br />
uncertainty and unemployment.<br />
The result of these errors, misconceptions, and compounded<br />
imbalances was that this Government, on being elected to<br />
power, was faced by:<br />
the greatest unemployment since the Great<br />
Depression, an actual decline in the Gross Domestic Product,<br />
a depression in company profit's share of<br />
national income,<br />
a desperate situation in the farming sector,<br />
a decline in real business fixed investment<br />
to its lowest level in three years,<br />
a CPI that was fourteen percent higher than it<br />
had been a year before and showing no substantive<br />
indications of declining,<br />
we were also faced by an overvalued currency which<br />
placed great b, rdens on particular groups in the<br />
community manufacturers, primary industry and<br />
import competing industries.<br />
In this situation, we had to establish a balance between<br />
the various arms of policy in order to create the conditions<br />
for a return to sustained economic growth. One could have<br />
made a case for devaluation a year ago. We did not act<br />
because the other arms of policy had to be brought to bear<br />
on inflation. The Government maintained the exchange rate<br />
and tightened the other arms of policy. We pursued stringent<br />
budgetary, monetary and wages policies. The Government cut<br />
spending, moved to control the growth in the money supply and<br />
argued strenuously for wage restraint.<br />
Yesterday, we moved to maintain the balance between the<br />
different arms of policy by alleviating the pressure which<br />
had built up on the external side of policy and making the<br />
necessary supporting adjustments in the other arms of policy.<br />
External Policy<br />
It has been widely, indeed almost universally recognised,<br />
that our currency has been overvalued for a considerable time.<br />
Some of those who recognised this fact nevertheless argued<br />
that the imbalance should be maintained indefinitely to<br />
lighten the burden on the other arms of policy in the fight<br />
against inflation. -3 </p>
<p>Unfortunatelv, those putting this view have not always<br />
recognised that the imbalance has placed a very severe<br />
burden on our manufacturing, exporting and import competing<br />
sectors. The Government has always recognised the dangers<br />
inherent in the declining competitive position of Australian<br />
industry. Recent events have nade an improvement in our competitive<br />
position more difficult to achieve-and have placed too heavy<br />
a burden on some parts of the Australian community and too<br />
heavy a pressure on the external arm of policy.<br />
The Arbitration Commaission's decision to pass<br />
the full CPI increase for the September quarter<br />
into wages threatened a further exaggeration of<br />
Australia's internal costs and hence our move to<br />
a more competitive international position.<br />
The maintenance of unrealistic wages<br />
levels has placed Australia's import<br />
and export competing industries at risk.<br />
It has also delayed the emergency of<br />
employment opportunities.<br />
It has not been sufficiently recognised<br />
that continuing to run an overvalued<br />
exchange rate has been unfair to employees<br />
and those seeking work because the capacity<br />
of industry to provide jobs has been<br />
inhibited.<br />
Uncertainty about the exchange rate resulting from<br />
the decline in Australia's competitiveness has been<br />
impeding the implementation of new investment<br />
proposals and has resulted in a continuing decline<br />
in Australia's international reserves a decline<br />
hastened by the irresponsible statements of some<br />
members of the Opposition.<br />
In the last twelve months, despite substantial<br />
overseas borrowing by the Government, our<br />
international reserves fell by $ 1100 million.<br />
The loss of reserves accelerated in the last<br />
few months, declining by $ 269 million in<br />
October and $ 260 million to the 2",! nh of<br />
the month. 4 </p>
<p>The prospect was for an unacceptable outflow of capital in<br />
December and early January.<br />
Last Thursday the Government's official advisers jointly presented<br />
two options to handle this situation:<br />
Further international borrowings,<br />
if around $ 1000 million; or<br />
Devaluation.<br />
The Government could not accept a situation where uncertainty<br />
and speculation would be sustained. Devaluation was therefore<br />
the only responsible option open to it. The size of the move<br />
mayl1ave caught people by surprise. This is perhaps because<br />
insufficient account has been taken of the impact of rising<br />
domestic costs on our competitive position in international<br />
trade. The Government wanted a figure that would end that<br />
uncertainty.<br />
Coupled with other policies, we believe this decision will<br />
lead to a strengthening in our international trading position.<br />
We have introduced a flexibly administered exchange rate.<br />
This is not a floating rate subject to daily fluctuation,<br />
but it is nevertheless a rate subject to short term movement<br />
in accordance with administrative decision.<br />
I am confident that the step we have taken will greatly<br />
enhance the processes of economic recovery.<br />
Australia's mining, rural and manufacturing industries will<br />
be significantly assisted by the decision, and employment<br />
opportunities will be increased. These effects, however,<br />
will not be long sustained if appropriate action is not<br />
taken with respect to the other arms of policy budgetary,<br />
monetary and wages policy.<br />
on the budgetary side<br />
We have this year budgetted for a reduction in the rate of<br />
growth of Government spending from 23% to 11%.<br />
Significant personal and company tax reforms have been introduced<br />
and a range of incentives h.: i-e been offered to encourage private<br />
investment. The deficit has been significantly reduced and equally, or<br />
perhaps more importantly, its structure has been altered.<br />
The deficit reflects measures to assist individuals and<br />
businesses, not a Government's desire to aggradise to itself<br />
more and more of the nation's resources. </p>
<p>In fact, if this Government had not introduced tax<br />
reforms and incentives for business, the deficit would<br />
have been $ 1.4 billion.<br />
As a result of yesterday's decision, it is imperative that the<br />
Government take further steps to control Government expenditure<br />
in order to avoid placing too great a pressure on the monetary<br />
arm of policy. Government expenditure will be reviewed with the<br />
object of making savings by deferring expenditure for next year,<br />
any proposals for increases in particular programmes above the<br />
real levels of outlay in 1976/ 77 will be regarded as new<br />
proposals. The Government will in all areas exercise an even more<br />
stringent control over its own expenditures. Governments<br />
cannot spend their way out of recession and unemployment in<br />
times of high inflation. The attempt to do so merely<br />
exacerbates underlying economic problems.<br />
If the Labor Government taught us no other valuable lessons,<br />
it did teach us this one.<br />
In 1974/ 75 Government expenditures increased by 46% while the<br />
deficit rose by almost $ 2,300 million. In 1975/ 76 expenditure<br />
increased by a further 23% and the deficit to $ 3,585 millionand<br />
it would have been greater if it hadn't been for the<br />
measures we took.<br />
During this period, prices increased by more than 30%, yet<br />
there was a negligible growth in real output, and unemployment<br />
increased by over 180,000.. Relaxation of the budgetary arm<br />
would mean a higher deficit and cause problems with financing it.<br />
We have experienced the consequences of that. Mr. Wran<br />
unfortunately does not appear to have learnt from the<br />
experience. His so-called plan for economic recovery<br />
is a recipe for repeating the disastrous mistakes of the<br />
Federal Labor Government.<br />
In monetary policy<br />
The Government is committed to achieving an appropriate rate<br />
of growth in the money supply.<br />
Action is being taken to prevent devaluation<br />
producing an inflationary growth in the money<br />
supply.<br />
Official interest rates have been increased.<br />
The Government will closely monitor the volume<br />
of lending by financial institutions to ensure<br />
that it promotes a sound and non-inflationary<br />
economic recovery. -6 </p>
<p>These measures cannot be construed as a squeeze on credit<br />
and it is not intended that they will reduce the money<br />
available for worthwhile projects.<br />
On the wages side<br />
The Government has in all forums consistently argued that wage<br />
restraint is an essential element in economic recovery. All the<br />
parties involved in wage determination have a great responsibility<br />
with respect to the economic well-being of Australia. The<br />
present situation demands wage restraint.<br />
The relationship between unemployment and excessive wage demands<br />
is clear at the present time, one man' s wage increase is<br />
purchased at the cost of his workmate's job. I believe that<br />
only a few people have failed to grasp this fact Mr. Hawke<br />
apzpears to be one of them.<br />
Last week he stated that wage increases would not be<br />
inflationary but would boost consumer confidence and help<br />
economic recovery. Nothing could be further from the truth.<br />
Wage increases in this context are counter productive they<br />
fuel inflation, increase unemployment and reduce spending.<br />
Again we can turn to the experience of the late Labor Government.<br />
In 1974, between the March and December quarters, average earnings<br />
increased by 24%, in real terms by 10%. What happened<br />
consumption went up by less than inflation went up by 13%.<br />
The wage increases accelerated inflation, accelerating inflation<br />
increased consumer uncertainty, consumers spent less, and<br />
unemployment rose.<br />
So much for Mr. Hawke's attempts at economics.<br />
Unless inflation is wound down, unless wage demands are moderated,<br />
there can be no rapid return to economic prosperity.<br />
In the two quarters preceding th is one, the decisions of<br />
arbitration commission not to pass the ful. CPI increase into<br />
wages made a significant contribution to the fight against<br />
inflation. By contrast, the Commission's September quarter national wage<br />
decision to pass on the full 2.2% was a blow to economic recovery.<br />
It adversely affected the winding down of inflation, the<br />
possibility of improvement in employment opportunities, and<br />
Australia's ability to compete internationally.<br />
The Commission itself noted the depre: ssed state of the economy,<br />
the poor state of the rural industry, and the problems facing<br />
Australia in the area of international trade.<br />
-7 </p>
<p>Nonetheless, it went ahead and passed on the full 2.2%<br />
CPI increase into wages.<br />
The Commission apparently believed they had to choose between<br />
industry chaos or economic dislocation. There is no doubt<br />
that their choice has worsened the chances of economic recovery.<br />
There is great doubt that it will affect the industrial<br />
relations situation.<br />
I greatly regret that the threats of a number of union leaders<br />
to cause further disruption have been taken to depict the view<br />
of the majority of trade union members, and that admitted economic<br />
commonsense has been set to one side.<br />
What does this say for Australia?<br />
Those in leading positions in every sphere of life, in every<br />
institution should apply what they know to be commonsense<br />
not pander to the extremist statements of a vocal minority<br />
who are actively seeking to undermine economic recovery for<br />
their own partisan purposes.<br />
The Arbitration Commission's decision was one of the factors<br />
that had to be considered in our decision to devalue. P~ Anly<br />
it contributed to a decline in Australia's international<br />
position which could not be sustained in the long run. We<br />
simply cannot maintain a situation in which the rate of<br />
increases in Australia' s wages bill outstrips that of its<br />
major trading partners.<br />
In the last six years, wages in Australia's manufacturing<br />
industry increased 130% compared with 53% in the US and<br />
in West Germany. It is only common sense that the country cannot<br />
continue to pay higher and higher wages that greatly exceed productivity<br />
increases without this leading to higher inflation and<br />
increased unemployment.<br />
It is only common sense that Australia is harmed by the level of<br />
industrial disputation frequently motivated by purely politic: .1<br />
considerations. The OECD's figures show that in 1975 Australia<br />
had the world's third worznL record in industrial disputes. This<br />
year, if Medibank stoppayj:-are excluded, our record is better,<br />
but industrial disputes are still far too numerous.<br />
The vast majority of union members do, I believe, recognise<br />
the irresponsibility of the minority of extremist union bosses.<br />
Some of these men are quite explicitly seeking to destroy our<br />
social and economic system. Others are attempting to squeeze<br />
the last drop of advantage to themselves, regardless of the<br />
consequences for the economy as a whole.<br />
-8 </p>
<p>These men have no difficulty in mouthing the words of<br />
social responsibility while they systematically drive more<br />
and more of their fellow unionists into unemployment.<br />
The wilful damage these men have wreaked on the community,<br />
their lack of concern for the people who were their workmates<br />
before they became members of an irresponsible and oligarchic<br />
union elite is breathtaking.<br />
The Government intends to maintain its strong opposition to<br />
wage and salary increases which cannot be justified by<br />
economic conditions, and to the disruptive activities of<br />
a few irresponsible militant union leaders. I believe<br />
that in taking these stands, we have the support of the<br />
Australian people and of rank and file unionists.<br />
The union movement shares a responsibility to advance<br />
Australia's economic recovery, not wilfully or carelessly<br />
undermine it.<br />
And our secret ballot legislation has given the reasonable<br />
rank and file unionists a means by which he can exact<br />
responsible action from his union leaders.<br />
9 </p>
<p>The measures we have taken are the ones appropriate to the economic<br />
situation, but they cannot work overnight. A persistent and<br />
balanced utilisation of all the arms of economic policy is<br />
necessary. We intend that Australia should have this.<br />
In this connection, I would like to turn to certain administrative<br />
changes which will strengthen the Government's capacities in<br />
the area of economic policy making.<br />
The establishment of a new department of finance to take over the<br />
existing financial management and control activities of the<br />
Treasury, will allow the Treasury Department to concentrate its<br />
efforts on broad economic policy analysis and advice.<br />
In conjunction with this change, those parts of the Department<br />
of the Prime Minister and Cabinet responsible for the evaluation<br />
of the effectiveness of government programmes, advice to<br />
the government on forward programming, and priority setting and<br />
the strategic planning of government initiatives, will be greatly<br />
strengthened. These steps will lead to greater emphasis being placed on longer<br />
term policies by the Government's advisers.<br />
The Government has initiated other changes too that will improve<br />
the quality of economic advice available to it.<br />
A bureau of industry economics has been established to carry out<br />
research work needed to assist the Government in the formation<br />
of industry policy. It will also assist the I. A. C. by making<br />
submissions on the results of the research where this is relevant<br />
to the Commission's inquiries. The establishment of the bureau<br />
will fill a major gap in the Government's research facilities.<br />
The new Department of Productivity will encourage innovation and<br />
the exploitation of new techniques of all kinds.<br />
Wce have taken the significant step of establishing a new Department<br />
for a very special reason. Productivity until now has been a<br />
responsibility of other ministries and inevitably it has tended<br />
to take second place.<br />
A separate ministry will for the first time focus attention on this<br />
crucial subject.<br />
The new ministry will draw together elements of Commonwealth<br />
Government activities directed towards productivity improvement and<br />
stimulate and coordinate the activities of other Commonwealth<br />
Departments and authorise towards this end.<br />
The new Department will also take over all those elements of the<br />
Government's administration that relate to the working<br />
environment, human, organisational, social and physical. </p>
<p>-11-<br />
The dec~ sion of this weekend can be of great advantage to the<br />
community. rtie competitive position of manufacturing industry competing with<br />
imported goods will be strengthened, and the benefits of this will<br />
flow on to all those dependent on a vigorous manufacturing sector.<br />
The disastrously depressed farming sector, the gravity of whose<br />
position is often under estimated will obtain an improved<br />
position in world markets.<br />
Investment projects which have been deferred can now get under<br />
way with their job and income creating potential.<br />
Mining and exporting industries generally, which make such<br />
an important contribution to Australia's prospertiy will now<br />
have their position considerably strengthened.<br />
The prosperity of these sectors is vital to us all, and the flow<br />
on benefits will spur recovery provided that they are not<br />
frittered away. Balance between the various arms of policy<br />
budgetary, monetary, external and wages policy has been<br />
maintained by what we have done. They must be kept in balance<br />
by each section of the community accepting its fair responsibility<br />
in the fight against inflation.<br />
The fight against inflation is a battle to which everyone must<br />
expect to make a contribution. It cannot be won if the burdens<br />
are distributed inequitably across the community. Equally it<br />
will not be won if there is not an end of the selfish pursuit of<br />
advantage by different groups in the community.<br />
The fight we are involved in now is not a fight for one group,<br />
one section of the community. It is nothing less than a fight<br />
for Australia's future in which every Australian l-ust be involved.<br />
Let us have a commitment by every Australian to make a personal<br />
contribution to getting Australia back to full economic health.<br />
Australia has a government committed to a strong private sector<br />
as the foundation of a decent life for all Australians. Business<br />
must be prepared to commit resources to the future of this<br />
country, knowing that it will get full and equiable consideration<br />
in Government policy.<br />
Trade union members must be prepared to see that their officials<br />
act responsibly and reflect the broad recognition of the need<br />
for restraint in wage and salary demands. Every Australian can<br />
make a contribution by a personal comnr: tment to make Australia<br />
once more a country of which they can proud. Unless there<br />
is such a commitment, we will watch a country with enormous<br />
potential waste itself in the destructive pursuit of personal<br />
and sectional advantage.<br />
On the night of the Federal Election last year, I said that<br />
we were determined to a government for all Australians.<br />
The economic policy we are pursuint reflects that determination.<br />
Now is the time for us all to work together to build the kind of<br />
country we all wi-'-t Australia to be.<br />
By recognising our common interests as a community, as a nation,<br />
we can realise Australia's unsurpassed potential and create a<br />
society which our children will be proud of. An Australia which<br />
rewards industry and enterprise, which can alleviate pockets<br />
of disadvantage and poverty, and which offers to all ts<br />
citizens the meaningful opportunity to pursue the things they<br />
value in the ways they desire. </p>
