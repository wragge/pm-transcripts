CONFEiNCE WITH FARME_-S' ORGANISATIONS<br />
Statement by the grime Minister, lt. Hon. R. G. Menzies<br />
This morning the Prime Minister and several of his<br />
Cabinet colleagues met representatives of the National Farmers'<br />
Union of Australia and the Australian Primary Producers' Union.<br />
The National Farmers' Union was represented by Mr. A. F. Havard,<br />
President, Mr. L. H. Heaslip, Australian Wool Meat Producers'<br />
Federation; Mr. J. P. Cass, Australian Wheatgrowers' Federation;<br />
Mr. C. S. J. Conroy, Australian Dairy Farmers' Federation; Mr, T.<br />
L. Bull, Australian Woolgrowers' Graziers' Council; Mr. R. H.<br />
Belcher, Australian Cane Growers' Council; and Mr. A. S. Norquay,<br />
Secretary. The Australian Primary Producers' Union was<br />
represented by Mr. S. Donelan, President; and Messrs J.<br />
Heffernan and I. T. Serjeant.<br />
The representatives of the National Farmers' Union told<br />
the Ministers present that the Government's economic measures in<br />
remedying boom conditions in 1960-61 had generally been<br />
appreciated by prirmary producers. While, naturally, a recovery<br />
to better employment levels was earnestly hoped for, the farming<br />
industries were somewhat apprehensive of the possibility of<br />
injudicious remedies re-introducing the unhealthy conditions<br />
from which the economy had escaped only with some difficulty.<br />
The National Farmers' Union representatives reminded<br />
the Government that Australian export producers were unable to<br />
pass on rising production costs because their overseas markets<br />
faced world competition. However, more exporting was necessary<br />
in order to strengthen the balance of payments and finance<br />
imports necessary for the expanding economy.<br />
The National Farmers' Union said that the economy<br />
would be strengthened by<br />
encouraging increased use of fertilisers by granting a<br />
subsidy<br />
arranging for the supply of bank finance under more<br />
appropriate condi. tions, possibly a 10-year ucirm<br />
ensuring that Australian industries received protection<br />
only after reference to the Tariff . ro) ard and not by<br />
quantitative import restriccic..<br />
avoiding the possibility of costly rr.: r-' y declining the<br />
use of anticipatory duties based 1. osn timation, and<br />
reducing the magnitude of transpor-i .7 xaminring the<br />
possibility of securing a unifor-rice n.:<br />
exploring the practicability of .: L. kii g c: pcial provision<br />
for capital charges on State raiW: , y systems, The<br />
National Farmers' Union said tha only implementing<br />
such a proposal could costs be r-; uced a ride<br />
front<br />
an inquiry by independent authorities into the question of<br />
what policies need to be pursued over the next ten years<br />
that will most closely achieve high living standards and<br />
full employment. </p>
<p>4 I 22,<br />
Representatives of the Australian Primary Producers'<br />
Union expressed agreement with the broad views put to Ministers<br />
by representatives of the National Farmers' Union. In<br />
particular, they stressed that a sound e: ternal economy is the<br />
first essential because internal prosperity and expansion depend<br />
mainly upon ability to export, and so to pay for all essentials<br />
for the maintenance of Australian industry and for development<br />
and expansion. They also stressed the need for a net inflow of<br />
oversea capital for long-term investment.<br />
The Australian Primary Producers' Union also emphadLsed<br />
that Australia's ability to export is closely related to the<br />
level of internal production costs, transport charges, the<br />
maintenance of a sound domestic market and our continued<br />
willingness and abil. ity to buy from countries which buy our<br />
exports. The Australian Primary Producers' Union also recommended<br />
the reduci ion of those taxes ihich have a multiplier effect on<br />
costs throughout dndustry.<br />
At the ccnclusion of the meeting Mir. Menzias said that<br />
this had been a most useful and valuable occasion. He told the<br />
representatives of both Unions that the suggestions they had<br />
proposed would be carefully considered.<br />
