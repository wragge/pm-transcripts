SPEECH BY THE PRIMI MINISTER, THE RT. HON.<br />
R. G. ENZS T THE SECOND FREEDOM RALLY<br />
ON NOVa _ o.<br />
Sir, I didn't quite like that last little bit because it<br />
made me sound so dreadfully old. ( Laughter) At a meeting<br />
of this kind I assure you i feel quite boyish.<br />
Like you I greatly enjoyed the very powerful and<br />
eloquent speech made by Senator iMcManus, who has consistently<br />
stood, for as long as I've known him, where he has stood<br />
tonight in his speech. ( Applaue)<br />
One other preliminary observation perhaps you will<br />
allow me to make, and it is this. Many of you, all of you,<br />
directly or indirectly, have come from countrie" now in a<br />
state of bondage, but once the homes of scme of the greatest<br />
leaders of freedom in history.<br />
This is one of the most terrible facts of modern<br />
times that great nations, familiar with freedom, by having<br />
struggled to win it, by having produced great men and women<br />
who have been its expositors, and its protectors, should now<br />
find themselves what we call, politely, the ' satellites" Of<br />
the Soviet Union; what, in fact, we ought to call the slaves<br />
of the Soviet Union. ( appiause)<br />
Now, to me there is always a ;: gct thrill about<br />
speaking to people rwho find themselves in your case. Because<br />
having come out of the ' house of bondage' you now have the<br />
indescribable joy to yourselves of living in a free country.<br />
And some-thing of that emotion was in your minds, I<br />
believe, certain1y in mine, . hen, at the very beginning of<br />
this meoting, the choir sang t. ho National Anthem. Never in my<br />
life have I heard it so wr. ll sung. ( Applause)<br />
I don't propose co make an unduly long speech to you.<br />
Some of the things that are in your mxnds, and in mine, some of<br />
the things that have been touched on this afternoon by the<br />
Senator, engaged the attention of the repesentatives of 98<br />
nations quite recently in eNo York. And on the occasion of<br />
that meeting, speaking on behal f of . ustralia; speaking, I<br />
think, on behalf of every non-Communist inhabitant of<br />
Australia ( Applause) I took the opportunity of speaking direct<br />
to an audience which included the Soviet Union, and included<br />
the satellite loaders.<br />
But, I just first of all give you one little view of<br />
those proceedings which shows what utter humbug is involved in<br />
the claim of the So-. iet Union that thes captive nations are,<br />
in reality, willing, and free and join with the Soviet Union<br />
of their own choice.<br />
The leader of the Soviet Union is a rather remarkable<br />
man. ( Laughter) Ho has a technique all of nis o. wn, One of<br />
the techniques is to applaud very violently when a good<br />
Communist sentiment is uttered by scioebody. And in order<br />
that his satollites, in order that thosu h umble, obedient<br />
servants, who ha eo eeon foisted on to your old and historic<br />
nations, should know when to come in at the right time, he<br />
always used to start clapping with his hands up. And they all<br />
looked, took the cue. and then you could pick them all out,<br />
applauding violen ly.<br />
if, on th. cther hand, he wanted to donounce </p>
<p>something that was being said by a person who expressed free<br />
sentiments, he would beat on the desk, sometimes with both<br />
fists and sometimes with a shoo. ( Laughter) And the moment<br />
that began they would all be looking around, they would see,<br />
they would get the cue then they would all begin to boat on<br />
the desk. ( Laughter)<br />
None of them used a shoe except him, because,<br />
naturally, in a slave community it is only the mater who can<br />
afford decent shoes. ( Applause)<br />
Now, Sir, it has always been prominently in my own<br />
mind that there is a good deal of nonsense, a good deal of<br />
confusion of thought, if one may put it quite kindly, about<br />
the position of the captive nations.<br />
Khrushchev's great exercise, so he said at New York.<br />
was to forward the cause of disarmament. Because, according<br />
to him, if his ideas on disarmament were accepted, then oeaco<br />
would come to the world. A very beguiling sentiment, that.<br />
But so untrue! Disarmament is one thing, and we should all wish,<br />
some day, to soe it guaranteed and honoured. But it is a<br />
great mistake to believe that the existence of armis is the<br />
cause of tension in the world. It is the result of tension<br />
in the world, not the cause, is the Senator has pointed out<br />
so accurately, you might arrive at agreements on maters of<br />
that kind, but if, at the end of it all, the Soviet Union is<br />
loft with its booty, is left with its enslaved ccmaniunities,<br />
then peace will have come about on a basis of perpetuated<br />
injustice. * ind a peace of that kind is not peace at .11.<br />
( Applause) If the Soviet Union wants peace, if it want" to<br />
remove the causes of tension, then its first task at home.<br />
It's first task is to set free the people whom it has enslaved.<br />
( Applause) Somebody, of course, may say, with a good deal of<br />
cynical truth perhaps, that fine words won't set these people<br />
free. You may say: " How are we to go about helping them to<br />
recover their freedom?".<br />
And on that I want to say that the most powerful<br />
weapon will be the opinion of honest decent men and rwonen all<br />
over the world. Don't let us fall into the error of thinking<br />
that by waving a wand, a Communist dictator can strike out of<br />
the hearts and minds of people their passion for f2eedom.<br />
They may control them with their beliefs; they may control<br />
them with threats and cormands. But freedom is not such a<br />
fragile plant. Freedom dies hard. And there are rmillions of<br />
people in ] urope today whose passion for freedom is not<br />
destroyed by the presence of a Comimunist Commissar. ( Applause)<br />
On the contrary, their passion for freedom will grow<br />
the more they see the symbols of enslavery.<br />
I am an i,-nsnse believer in the spirit of ;-Ian. The<br />
spirit of man is the greatest and r. ost powerful thing in<br />
creation. And you don't put it down in a year or two. You<br />
don't put it down in a generation or two. You don't out it<br />
down by laws or comands or by force.<br />
Does anybody suppose, anybody who is of -ay own race<br />
suppose, that we would knuckle down in perpetuity to some<br />
foreign master? Of course not. </p>
<p>3.<br />
This spirit is the most powerful thing in the world<br />
and I think it is a wonderful idea that every year you should<br />
have a Rally of this kind. Keep on having Rallies of this<br />
kind. ( Applause) Because the very fact that in one city<br />
in Australia thousands of people can come together to offer<br />
oncouragemont, mutual encouragement and encouragement to those<br />
who are far distant from us, will have its effect,<br />
These things get past the Iron Curtain; these<br />
things filter around the world; these things will help to keep<br />
the flame of the spirit burning bright in our friends in these<br />
captive countries. A reference has been made already, and I propose to<br />
make one myself to the hypocrisy of the current Cornmunist<br />
attack on " Inperialisn" and " Colonialism".<br />
I wonder if I might just to show that I didn't<br />
think of this just this afternoon impose on you one or two<br />
very short passages from a speech I made at the United Nations,<br />
a speech which the great Khrushchev himself described to me<br />
afterwards in conversation as " very sharp".( Laughter)<br />
( Applause) I said, among other things, this:<br />
" There are some who have so far misunderstood the<br />
spirit of the United N-tions as to resort to open or veiled<br />
threats, blatant and, in some instances, lying propaganda,<br />
a clearly expressed desire to divide and conquer. They<br />
should learn that ' threatened men live long' and that free<br />
nations, however small, are not susceptible to bullying".<br />
( Applause) I then said:<br />
" I'll permit myself the luxury of developing this<br />
theme. In his opening speech, Mr. Khrushchev made his<br />
usual great play about " colonialism". is Mr. Macmillan<br />
reminded us, the answer to much of his story is to be found<br />
in the presence in this Assembly of many new nations, once<br />
colonies and now independent".<br />
( None of them, mark you, colonies of a Communist<br />
power). " Mr. Khrushchev said among other things" and I quote<br />
these rwords, they are an exercise in humbug " nations who<br />
oppress other nations cannot themselves be free. ( Laughter)<br />
Every free ( and I'm still quoting him) nation should help<br />
the peoples still oppressed to win freedom and independence'.'<br />
( Applause) This was the only point on which this old chap seems<br />
to be on our side, ( Laughter) ' Every free nation should help<br />
the peoples still oppressed to win freedom and independence'.<br />
., nd I said myself,<br />
" This was, in one sense nost encouraging obseovation.<br />
It made me wonder whether we were perhaps about to see the<br />
beginning of the era in which the nations of Europe, which<br />
were once independent, and are now under Soviet Communist<br />
control, were going to receive the blessings themselves of<br />
independence. ( Applause)<br />
". hat a glorious vista of freedom would be opened up<br />
by such a policy. How much it would do to relieve the<br />
causes of tension, and promote peace. I venture to say that<br />
it is an act of complete hypocrisy for a Communist leader to<br />
denounce colonialism, as if it were evil characteristic<br />
, D </p>
<p>of the Western powers, when the facts are that the greatest<br />
colonial power now existing in the wrorld is the Soviet<br />
Union itself". ( Applause)<br />
Sir, it's a very ill business to quote yourself, but<br />
having quoted that, you will see that we have here almost the<br />
beginnings of a new and terrifying political alliance between<br />
Senator McManus and myself. ( Laughter, Applause)<br />
Now, Sir, I thought, and I still think, that the two<br />
objects of Communist strategy as disclosed at the United<br />
Nations itself are these.<br />
First of all they want to keep under their control<br />
the nations they already have stolen. And they want to keep<br />
them without saying anything about it. They don't want other<br />
people to discuss it. They want this taken as something that<br />
has been done and that can't be undone; something that has<br />
got respectable as the years go by. They just want everybody<br />
to assume that " Well, there it is; it's there. -nd it can't<br />
be changed". The statesmen of the Ueste. n world will do very<br />
badly for the future of the world if they over allow the<br />
Communist powers to forgot that they are the slave masters<br />
if they ever allow the world to forgot that there can be no<br />
true peace in the world until these people have been set free.<br />
But that is the first object of the strategy.<br />
And the second object of the strategy is to deal<br />
with the new nations. This is something of the highest<br />
possible order of impertinonce. There are new nations there<br />
were a dozen of them this year at Now York, a large number of<br />
then from , frica. as these new nations come along,<br />
having once been colonies, having been granted independence,<br />
having under the enlightoned policies which have been<br />
practised in the Jostern w-orld, cone to be their own nrsters<br />
to chose their own form of Government, the Soviet tactic is to<br />
say to them, day after day, speech after speech, with<br />
terrifying reiteration, " You must be bitter; you must preserve<br />
your bitterness; you must go on hating colonialism" which to<br />
then is a mere matter of past history.<br />
This attempt to emoiJtter then, is of cou-, se, clearly<br />
an attempt to put them into that frame of mind in which they<br />
will be ready to receive the Cormunist doctrine, in which they<br />
will begin to blame everybody else for all their troubles and<br />
therefore be very very willing to say to the Soviet Union,<br />
" Thank you so much; you've been very sympathetic; you've<br />
nade us feel very bitter. Now you, no doubt, will be the<br />
people to help us". And then they step in with their " loaded"<br />
assistance. That is one way of doing it.<br />
. nother way and this was practised very<br />
considerably there was to adopt threatening attitudes. It<br />
was almost strange, weird, to ne, to be sitting there,<br />
listening to some of these terrible tub-thumping perforances,<br />
and laughing at them, as we have the habit of doing in<br />
Australia. We are not very responsive to tub-thumpers. And<br />
we would be sitting there laughing at these ridiculous antics.<br />
But I could see other deleoates from new nations who<br />
looked interested, who looked occasionally inpressed, and<br />
sometimes who looked a little apprehensive as to whether they<br />
could afford to disagro with people of such strength and<br />
violence. But that's the Soviet technique at the present time. </p>
<p>I an happy to toll you that I don't think that, by<br />
and large, those tactics succceded at all. i don't think that<br />
Khrushchev understands the J. stern nind. I don't think that,<br />
for all practical purposes, he is a Europe: n in his outlook.<br />
He doesn't understand the . Jostern nind, moaning by that the<br />
mind of all the people, or most of the people in the nations<br />
from which you como, and in our own nation, and in all the<br />
great powers of the Jedst.<br />
The best proof of that to me was that here and here<br />
and here, as one went around, one got the immediate reaction<br />
of a lot of these represontatives, ' After all they have come<br />
to froedom; they have cone to independence; they have a<br />
proper pride in it.' They feel the dignity of freedom; they<br />
feel the dignity of being in a country, the master of your own<br />
system of Government. And they are not so impressed by<br />
undignified rabble-rousing shouting and thumping as Khrushchev<br />
appears to imagine. I venture to say that psychologically,<br />
on the wholo, he lost ground with the now nations by his<br />
antics at New York last month. And I hope that is true. I<br />
believe it is true.<br />
Now I said something a little while ago about<br />
" woolly-minded" people. There are two groups of nations,<br />
small nations, in the world in whom we are bound to have a<br />
brotherly and continuing interest. One I've already referred<br />
to you represent them here today the captive nations.<br />
But the other group is those nations on the fringes<br />
of Cormunism of Communist power who are at risk at this<br />
very moment, who are liable at any time to find Communist<br />
infiltration, Co-mmunist aggression, probing by thom, stirring<br />
up Communist disorders inside the country, undermining the<br />
Governnont, undermining respect for the law,<br />
. nd these countries are in a state of danger and we<br />
must never forget them.<br />
In South-East . sia, look at them, Laos, Cambodia,<br />
South Vietnam, South K'. rea, Formosa. And yet I've heard people<br />
who would profess to be quite thoughtful and respctable<br />
people, blithely say that if you should establish some terms of<br />
peace with Communist China by handing over Formosa to them,<br />
that would be a price worth paying for peace,<br />
Did you ever hear such utter iruddlo-huadod nonsense?<br />
If you can hand over one country because it is small, well you<br />
can hand over another one because it is small. . Jo could go on<br />
retreating and retreating and retreating before this<br />
Communist advance until there is no free country left between<br />
Australia and the..( Applause)<br />
Now, Sir, we have been speaking this afternoon<br />
about Communis. m, because C:: mmunisn is the enemy. People seem<br />
to think, or sol.. e people do, that you can meet Communism by a<br />
sort of reasoned logical 3rgument.<br />
This is not a matter for logical argument. You just<br />
cn. msider how the captive nations in Europe bucame captive<br />
nations. Jhy when the second world war began it was, in<br />
the view of the Communists in Australia who are the mere<br />
faithful echos of the Comunists of Moscow, an Imperialist war,<br />
when they did their best in Australia to sabotage it.<br />
r. d at that time, with a friendly Germany the Soviet<br />
Union picked up two or three powers. It ensconsed itself in<br />
the Baltic States. It gathered in a few sl,.-ve cuntrios under<br />
the guise of the friend of Hitler's Ger:. any. </p>
<p>6.<br />
But when Hitler i-oved into Russia to attack then,<br />
then of course the war became a respectable one; they wore<br />
our groat allies. And when the Iwar was over, as our friends,<br />
they picked up a few nore European countries. ( Applause)<br />
Now, that, ladios and gontlenon, is what we call<br />
pure opportunismi. They are not working on a theory. They are<br />
looking for practical results, And they will go wherevor they<br />
can get a practical result and use any Athod, or any<br />
association that is calculated to produce it,<br />
œ. nd thorooro one of our perennial tasks is to watch<br />
Conrunisio, to chock Cor.' unism, to put it down, so far as we<br />
can, rherever we find it. ( spplausc)<br />
It is a very trite saying that Covnunism is the<br />
encimy of individual freoodon, Lot rino repeat to you frodon<br />
is not someathing that you got by ict of Parliaiiont. Froodomn<br />
is not somothing that you get as . a group of people. Freoodon<br />
is individual, I an-a free m-an; or I a, not You are a<br />
frooee an, or a froee woan; or you are not. And Comrmlunism has<br />
no patience with individual froadon,<br />
Of course they are able to show the world how clover<br />
they aro, how technologically advancod they are, as indeed<br />
they are, by putting Sputniks into orbit, d in. all these<br />
strange things. Of course they can do it. Because they have<br />
conplet control of every man and wonan in their boundaries.<br />
And if they want to direct their scientists to got on with<br />
these warliko, or thre:. tning, activities, they will.<br />
Ihile wo, who enjoy the blessings of froodom, and<br />
have done so for so long in . ustrali, in the United States of<br />
miierica, in Groat Britain, have developed science for the<br />
bonofit of mankind, in riodicine, in halth, in comnunictions,<br />
in a thousand different ways on a scale that the Soviet Union<br />
has never droamnt of. ( Applause)<br />
Commnunisn is therefore the enomy of individual<br />
freodomn. It is the eneomy of the law. There is nothing that so<br />
turns m y stomnach as to read, either a Comunnunist or a fellow<br />
traveller of whom there are mnany, talking about the law,<br />
claiing sonothing about the law, invoking the law. I wonder<br />
how much a lan can invoke the law in the Soviet Union, I<br />
wonder : rhat'the rights of the ordinary individual may be in<br />
Commzunist China. I've said somthing, to you about science controlled<br />
science, slave science if you like, and the science of froee<br />
men. But abovo all those things, and I think we find a great<br />
common ground, above all these things Comnunis.: is the clear<br />
enomy of religion, of religious faith.<br />
Now what sort of world w'. juld it be if Comm--unisu,<br />
through somo fault of ours, through su:_ o laxity on our part,<br />
through some folly or idlenoss on our pcmt, achieved its<br />
aimbition of conquering the world?<br />
Sworld without religion a world in wvhich the<br />
faith of our f::. Athols is proscribed and struck down by people<br />
who are the m1ost blatant mat:. lists.<br />
That is not somoathin that we can contlnplato. But<br />
there again my great con'fort is this, That just as froodon is<br />
not easily boaten out of the hoart of man, s-is faith not<br />
easily beaten out ofhim, You cannot take thousands, nillions,<br />
hundreds of nillions of people who have a faith of their own,<br />
and destroy it, meorely by ordor or conand. </p>
<p>I coi. e-back all tho tioto the fact that under some<br />
circuustanco s thoso people, if they carry their ag, ;; rossion to<br />
the point of a. rms, woul d havo tl be 1meti by ari-s, lbhatovor tho<br />
disastor m-i~ dht bo.<br />
But in te eaimone of the groat uarantcos<br />
that have ag. ainst their at-L-rossion is that we prosorve in<br />
our hoarts and i-inds an entl-usiastic faith, a7n enthusiastic<br />
bolic-f, a missionary fooling of freedom,. That is vihat you arc<br />
here today to rjncw. ( Applause))<br />
Sir, it is a very -roat privili., o for mec to be hare.<br />
I said to the Lord 1iayer just bofore I up that five<br />
e'cl3ckI on Saturday afternojon s., emeid a rathelr odd tii-je for a<br />

only time-, L tha-t suited you" t( A1* pplause)<br />
., nd so, Sir, before I sit down, I apelo:-, iso to you.<br />
But I also propose before I sit do3wn to thank you for a m--ost<br />
: aioiu-orablo experience. Nothin. but uod can coinci of the<br />
rafroshi-ont of spirit, the m-utual Dncour-, 1,, 2--ont, that a<br />
