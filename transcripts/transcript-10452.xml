22 August 1997 ADDRESS BY THE PRIME MUNISTER<br />
THE HON. JOHN HOWARD MP<br />
' ro THE TASMANIAN LIBERAL PARTY STATE COUNCIL DINNER<br />
COUJNTRY CLUB CASINO, LAUNCESTON</p>
<p>E&amp; OE<br />
Thank you very much Tony, to Bill Gatenby, the President of the Tasmanian Division of  the Liberal Party, Tony Staley, the Federal President of the Party, . Jocelyn Newman,<br />
Warwick Smith, my other Parliamentary colleagues, both State and Federal, to Robyn<br />
Gray and Ray Groom, two former Tasmanian Premiers, ladies and gentlemen.<br />
It is again a great pleasure to be back addressing the Tasmanian Division. I was thinking<br />
before I got up to speak that I have spoken at this dinner and to various gatherings like<br />
this in many capacities over the years.<br />
I have spoken to it as Opposition Leader, this is the second time I have addressed this<br />
dinner as Prime Minister, on earlier occasions I spoke to it as Treasurer and I think on<br />
occasions I have been allowed in to speak to it when I have not carried any particular<br />
moniker at all, other than a member of Federal Parliament. And, over the years I have<br />
developed some very close personal associations with many people in the Tasmanian<br />
Division. And, I want to say at the outset tonight, how much I appreciate on a personal level, the<br />
tremendous loyalty, understanding and support that the rank and file members of the<br />
Liberal Party in Tasmania have given me, particularly over the last seventeen months.<br />
It's sometimes not easy to be an open supporter of a political party and I think it does all<br />
of us well on occasions like this to remember that it's you and people like you around<br />
Tasmania and around Australia who have really kept the Liberal Party going. You have<br />
kept the Liberal Party going during its difficult years, as well as being able to share the<br />
relative success and share the delight that we now hold power at both a State and a<br />
Federal level.<br />
And, in terms of the history of Liberal Party right at the moment, enjoying as we do,<br />
power at a national level and power at a State and Territorial level in every part of </p>

Australia other than NSW, it represents one of the high points in the 52 year existence of<br />
the Liberal Party of Australia.<br />
But, can I say that a man who epitomnises that commitment, that willingness to give his all<br />
to something that he believes in, that we all believe in, is of course your retiring State<br />
President, Bill Gatenby. And can I say to you Bill, that you have given enormous support<br />
and substance, and fibre, and leadership to the Liberal Party, here in Tasmania, over the<br />
last three and a half years.<br />
We would not have done as well as we have done here, Federally, we would not have<br />
retained the authority in difficult circumstances that we have at a State level, without your<br />
leadership. I admire the fact that with quite meagre resources, most of the time, in very<br />
very difficult circumstances, politically, from opposition for a large part of the time at a<br />
Federal level, and in challenging circumstances at a State level, you have kept the Liberal<br />
Party flag flying here.<br />
You have preserved a representative Liberal Party that reflects the grass roots of the<br />
Tasmainian people and one of the great strengths I have always noticed at the Tasmanian<br />
Division of the Liberal Party, is that, it seemed to me to be a more faithful representation<br />
of the people of the State than perhaps some of the other divisions of the Liberal Party<br />
around the country.<br />
So, can I say, can I wish you and Margo every happiness in the future. I am delighted that<br />
you'll continue as Federal Vice-President of the Liberal Party and that I'll continue to have<br />
your advice and your counsel and your support on the National Executive of the Party.<br />
You have been a great and faithful servant of the Liberal Party here in Tasmania and<br />
around Australia and all of us are massively in your debt on that account.<br />
So ladies and gentleman, could I also say how very pleased I am to have had the<br />
opportunity before tonight's dinner to talk at length about issues of fundamental<br />
importance to the future of Tasmania and fundamental to the relationship between the<br />
Federal Government and State Government, with Tony Rundle, your Premier.<br />
Tasmania does face some enormous challenges. The Nixon Report has highlighted some<br />
of the realities facing the state of Tasmania and I want to compliment Tony Rundle on the<br />
courageous leadership that he has displayed in the wake of that Report.<br />
I feel a sense of great understanding and great sympathy with his position. There comes a<br />
time in the life of a politician, the life of a State or the life of a country where it's really a<br />
question of what is the point of continuing to occupy positions unless you are prepared to<br />
take a chance and to take a risk and to strike out a courageous position.<br />
And, one of the things that influenced me in the decision that I took ten days ago to<br />
recommend that my Cabinet ( that we enthusiastically embrace the cause of taxation<br />
reform), was the fundamental belief that the Australian nation needs a new taxation system<br />
to take it into the 21 st Century. </p>

And in similar vein, your Premier has Said that the people of Tasmania and the State of<br />
Tasmania need new Constitutional and economnic arrangements to take it into the<br />
21st century. And rather than recoil defensively into despair and despondency, what your<br />
Premier has done is to show a lead, to stamnp his authority on the debate about the<br />
direction of your State.<br />
And, I wish him well, I congratulate him in his vigour. I hope the referendum that he<br />
proposes is resoundingly supported and speaking on behalf the Federal government, I will<br />
do everything that I reasonably can to assist in developing, and helping, and promoting<br />
and nurturing the future of Tasmania and the future of the Tasmanian people.<br />
We are, as we have been reminded about half way through our first term in office.<br />
It's appropriate, therefore, to take stock of what has happened and also to try and project<br />
forwar-d a little to what is going to happen over the next eighteen months. And over the<br />
last seventeen months we have very much been in the process of repairing the foundations<br />
of attending to those things that have been left neglected for a long period of<br />
time. it's worth reminding the Australian people that we inherited an unemployment rate<br />
of It's worth reminding the Australian people that for 13 years the Labor Party ran<br />
this country, for 13 years they had the opportunity to fix the tax system, for 13 years they<br />
had the opportunity to reduce unemployment, for 13 years they had the opportunity to<br />
give this country a viable industry policy, for 13 years they had the opportunity to put this<br />
country into the black, but when we came into office in March of last year, none of those<br />
things had been attended to.<br />
If ever there were a group of people who are utterly disqualified from commenting<br />
critically on the level of unemployment in Australia, it is the members of the Labor Party<br />
front bench in Canberra, at the present tine.<br />
Over the last 17 months we have repaired the foundations, we have addressed the things<br />
that needed to be addressed. We inherited an underlying budget deficit of $ 10.5 billion<br />
and by the end of our first term we will have converted that to a surplus of $ 1.6 billion.<br />
In 1995 the national debt of this country was about 20% of our annual wealth generation<br />
By the year 2000 we will have cut that in half According to the OECD, we will<br />
have a growth rate in 1997 and 1998 which is faster than the average of the G7, that is the<br />
major 7 industrialised countries.<br />
We inherited levels of interest rates which over the last 17 months have been reduced by<br />
percentage points. We have in Peter Costello's phrase, the lowest housing interest<br />
rates since man first walked on the moon in 1969. We have delivered all of the<br />
fundamental promises we made in the area of industrial relations, in the area of small<br />
business, in the area of the environment, despite the best efforts of the Labor Party and the<br />
Australian Democrats and the Australian Greens to frustrate our environmental<br />
programme. We are now in the process of generating, through the National Heritage<br />
Trust of Australia, the largest ever capital expenditure on environmental re-generation in<br />
the history of post World War 11 Australia-</p>

We have achieved the one third sale of Telstra. which is the largest privatisation so far in<br />
Australia's history. We have delivered on our ommiitment to self funded retirees. From<br />
the 1 st of July this year, we have delivered on our commitment in relation to private health<br />
insurance rebates. In other words, if you look back over the last 17 months, and it's very<br />
important that all of us as Liberals remember this, because sometimes we are our own<br />
worst enemies in selling and proclaiming our own achievements.<br />
Sometimes we are to reluctant to talk about what we have achieved. Sometimes, we too<br />
readily succumb to the criticism of our opponents and the propaganda of our media critics<br />
and sometimes we lose sight of what has been achieved over that last 17 months.<br />
And there's an old adage in life tbat if you don't tell the world what you have done,<br />
nobody else is going to do so.<br />
It's tremendously important that all members of the Liberal Party understand the extent to<br />
which we have kept faith with the commitments that we have made to the Australian<br />
people. How we have delivered our industrial relations programme; how we have put the<br />
country back in the black; how we have reduced interest rates We have retired debt<br />
this year alone we'll repay five and a half billion dollars of Mr Keating's debts. And to<br />
take a deficit of $ 10.5 billion and turn it into a surplus of $ 1.6 billion, in the space of<br />
3 years, is a remarkable achievement. And as I had the great pleasure of saying to both<br />
British and American audiences a couple of months ago when I was in those two<br />
countries, that if you applied the criteria of the Mastricht Treaty for membership of the<br />
European Monetary Union, Luxembourg and Australia are the only two countries at<br />
present that would qualify' to join that august assembly. And I was very quick to point<br />
out, of course, that Australia has absolutely no desire whatever to be associated with the<br />
European Monetary Union.<br />
I mean, I have spent a large part of my political life denigrating, quite rightly and with<br />
some passion, the rotten anti-Australian policies of the European Economic Union, that<br />
have done immense damage to the agricultural industries of Australia, and represent one of<br />
the high watermarks of world trading hypocrisy. If ever a group of nations has preached<br />
the theory of free trade but practiced protection to demented lengths, it's the European<br />
Union. Ladies and gentlemen, that is the past 17 months and it has been a period of rebuilding the<br />
foundations. It has been a period of attending to those things that have been left<br />
unattended. It's involved some unpopular decisions, it's attracted its share of criticism.<br />
But we are now entering phase two. Phase two is very much about realising the potential<br />
of this nation as we move into the 2 1st century. Phase two is very much about building<br />
structures that will take this country into the 21 st century. Phase two is very much about<br />
conquering the most challenging art of modern government and that is, to choose between<br />
preserving those things about your society, about your institutions and about your way of<br />
life that ought to be preserved because they are good, they are better than the alternatives<br />
and they enshrine the values that you believe in. Preserving them in one hand, and yet<br />
with the other hand throwing out those structures and those institutions and those<br />
practices that are no longer serving the best interests of your society and the best interests<br />
of yoar nation. </p>

Tony Rundle and Hill Gatenby were quite Correct tonight to talk about the fact that we are<br />
challenged by change. The world is changing very rapidly. The information technology<br />
revolution is the greatest transformation that the world has seen since the industrial<br />
revolution. It is sweeping through the world in a way and at a pace that few in this room<br />
would have thought possible even a few years ago. I mean this afternoon I received a<br />
minute from the head of my department saying that they are for the first time examining<br />
proposals for the use of the electronic information systems of the Commonwealth for the<br />
distribution of Cabinet documents and Cabinet minutes and over the next few months that<br />
will become common place practice. It's just a contemporary example that landed, not on<br />
my desk but on my hotel bed as I unlocked the weekend bag, of the sort of changes that<br />
are being bought about by the information technology revolution. So anybody who says<br />
that we can resist change and anybody who thinks we can hop off the global economy and<br />
somehow or other repair to a quiet patch undisturbed by what is happening now and what<br />
has happened over the last 10 or 20 years is absolutely deluding themselves.<br />
Of course we must change. And the great challenge is to change those things that must be<br />
changed because of those forces that I've just mentioned. But at the same time, hanging<br />
on to those fundamental Australian values, hanging on to that great egalitarism of the<br />
Australian community, hanging on to our tolerance, remembering the great capacity of this<br />
country particularly after World War 11 to absorb millions of people from around the<br />
world and to build this great harmonious, tolerant Australian nation, is one of the great<br />
achievements of the Australian story. The way in which we were able to absorb people<br />
from all around the world and to build a nation of tolerance and harmony and also to<br />
preserve the Federal system This is a big country You can't run it other than through a<br />
decentralised Federal system of government and the idea that all wisdom resides in one<br />
particular part of Australia of course, as your State President said, is absolute nonsense.<br />
I am, as I often say, a passionate nationalist. I am not a centralist, but I am a nationalist.<br />
A nationalist is somebody who believes that decisions should always be taken with a view<br />
to the national benefit. A centralist is somebody who always believes the national benefit<br />
is to be found in the decision being taken in the centre of the nation. I think there's a very,<br />
very imnportant difference and I think true Federalism and a true co-operative struicture<br />
between the Federal government and the State governments of Australia is to be found in<br />
a system of government whereby we always take decisions which best express the national<br />
interest. And in many cases they can only be taken in a spirit of co-operation and harmony and<br />
partnershp between the Federal government and the State Government. At the moment,<br />
the Premier and I, and our respective Ministers, are engaged in debate and discussion<br />
about the regional forest arrangements, to be concluded between the Federal government<br />
and th~ e State government.<br />
And, the purpose of those arrangements is to build a stable, predictable agreement<br />
between the two governments, involving the industry and other community groups, that<br />
will give certainty, and security and jobs again, over the next 20 years. </p>

Achieving that is not easy, but there is great goodwill on the part of both governments,<br />
and I know the importance of the forest industry to the people of Tasmania. And I know<br />
the history of the debate between the forest industry and others in Tasmania over the last<br />
few years and it is my determination and the determination of the Tasmanian government<br />
to see that an intelligent, and lasting, and far sighted agreement between the two<br />
governments is reached. And one that above everything else, will give security and<br />
predictability to the people who are employed in the industry and invest in the industry,<br />
and will also recognise the special and unique national conservation values of the State of<br />
Tasmania. But, ladies and gentlemen, I mentioned a moment ago that ten days ago we embarked at a<br />
Federal level, upon a great debate, I called it, and some of my media critics derided the<br />
reference, I called a great adventure and this is the adventure of fuhndamiental taxation<br />
reform.<br />
We have reformed and changed, and made more modern, the industrial relations system of<br />
Australia. We've got the budget in order; we've reduced our debt, we're embarked upon<br />
a vigorous program of privatisation; we have a strong and positive competition policy<br />
throughout Australia. But the one great, neglected, unrepaired, ramshackle of the<br />
Australian economy, is our taxation system.<br />
And, there is not a man or woman in this audience who doesn't know that we need<br />
fundamental reform to Aujstralia's taxation system. And if I were addressing a Labor<br />
Party dinner, I would be able to make the same claim, without any fear of contradiction.<br />
And the people who have performed the most pathetically of all in this debate about<br />
taxation reform, have been Kim Beazley and Gareth Evans,<br />
Kim Beazley started off by saying, well I'm interested in taxation reform but you can't talk<br />
about having a broad-based indirect tax as part of it. Rather like saying, I want to have a<br />
game of football as long as there is no opposing side.<br />
Gareth Evans said you don't need to reform the Australian taxation system, he said all you<br />
have got to do is have a bit more growth. Well can I say Gareth, where was your growth<br />
over the last 13 years? And, fie said, al you have got to do is have a little bit of growth<br />
and you do a little bit of fiddlig at the margin.<br />
And now the latest contribution from Mr Beazley is, he says I'm in favour of taxation<br />
reform, as long as it involves soaking the rich whatever that may mean, or whoever<br />
they may comprise.<br />
Can I say that by contrast, we have committed ourselves to a program of taxation reform<br />
that will deliver a fairer taxation system, a modern taxation system, that will take this<br />
country into the 21st Century, A taxation system that will reform the indirect tax base.<br />
One that will involve reductions in personal income tax. One that does not involve an<br />
increase in the overall taxation burden. And one that will include the difficulties of<br />
Commonwealth/ State financial relations. </p>

Now 1. think the most important area of unfinished economic business in this country is the<br />
challenge of taxation reform. It is not something that stands alone, it's not an academic<br />
exercise that is irrelevant to the general health of the economy. A better taxation system<br />
means stronger economic growth and stronger economic growth means lower<br />
unemployment. The idea that you can look at the challenge of unemployment without looking at such a<br />
fuindamental artery of the Australian economy as the taxation system, is quite unrealistic.<br />
All of us know, if we are honest with ourselves, that we have addressed this issue in the<br />
past. Some of you may say, why are you raising it now? Some of you may say why are<br />
you raising it now, some of you may say, you can't go to an election proposing taxation<br />
reform. Does anybody seriously imagine that I could have gone to the next election as Prime<br />
Mnister of this country and said no, we're not going to do anything about taxation<br />
reform?<br />
There comes a point in public life and politics, if you are really serious about doing<br />
something good for the nation, and doing something good for your country, you have to<br />
deya bit of conventional political wisdom. You have to ignore what some of the advisers<br />
tell you. You have to say to people, the future of this country is worth taking a few<br />
personal risks for and that is in reality what is involved.<br />
I don't underestimate the challenges. I know that the Labor Party will run the most<br />
negative, the most misrepresenting, the most dishonest, the most scurrilous fear campaign<br />
in relation to taxation reform that anybody could imagine.<br />
But you all know, that if we are to be faithful to the huge mandate that we were given at<br />
the last election, you all know that one of our great responsibilities is to tackle areas of<br />
fundamental economic reform. And we can't seriously be on the playing field, we can't<br />
seriously be part of the team and we certainly can't be a world class team unless we are<br />
willing to address the weaknesses in the Australian taxation system. There are many, and<br />
you'll be hearing more of them from me and from Peter Costello and our colleagues, over<br />
the next few months but just let me tell you one, or two of them.<br />
In 1955, which admittedly is a long time ago, if you paid the top marginal rate of income<br />
tax you had to be earning seventeen times average weekly earnings. By 1979 that had<br />
fallen to something like seven times average weekly earnings it has now fallen to one and<br />
a half times average weekly earnings. And it gives you an idea of the way in which the<br />
progressive taxation system has become such a clog, not on very wealthy people, but has<br />
become a clog on the aspirations of average, middle class Australians.<br />
All of you will be aware, and you will certainly become more aware over the next few<br />
months, of the extent to which the current indirect taxation system affects the purchase<br />
price that you pay for so many basic daily goods that you purchase for your every day<br />
needs. </p>

A~ UG 23 ' 97 15: 45 P1<br />
When you bear the fear campaign about an extra cent or a Y per cent broad-based indirect<br />
tax, just remember the 22 per cent that you are paying on toothpaste, just remember what<br />
you are paying on orange concentrate and remember that you can buy caviar without any<br />
wholesale sales tax. And you think of some of those anomalies and some of those<br />
contradictions, then you have an idea of why this system is so far out of date and why this<br />
system is in need of fundamental repair.<br />
Ladiesl and gentlemen, can I say to all of you that being in government is good. Doing<br />
good things in government is even better. Being in opposition is absolutely awful and<br />
never to be lightly embraced or contemplated. At the end of the day though what we exist<br />
for as a political movement, what we exist to do is to implement the values of our party<br />
which are an expression of the hopes and the aspirations of the Australian people.<br />
One of the great strengths of the Liberal Party of Australia is that it isn't owned by<br />
anybody, it isn't owned by any one section of the Australian community. And one of the<br />
greatest feelings that I had on the evening of the 2nd March last year was to know that the<br />
only obligation I carried into office as Prime Minister of Australa was an obligation to do<br />
my level best to improve the lot of the great mass of the Australian people. I didn't go<br />
into office feeling that I had to deliver a particular promise to a particular person, or to a<br />
particular group of people. I went into office knowing that in my heart that if I did the<br />
right thing by the great majority of the Australian people, then I would have fulfilled the<br />
mandate that they so generously gave to me and my colleagues.<br />
We have tried hard over the last 17 months to do that. We have another 18 odd months<br />
before the next election. We are moving to that second stage which is to realise the<br />
potential of this country as it moves into the 2 1st century.<br />
We've copped our share of criticism that's politics, it's all part of the process. It was<br />
never a particularly generous or a particularly giving activity, as many in this room know<br />
just as well as I do. But if we are serious about building a better Australia, if we are<br />
serious about making certain that his country prospers, survives and thrives into the 2 1st<br />
century, we must continue to have the courage to take risks. We must continue to have<br />
the courage to strike out for reform, we must have the foresight and the wisdom to hang<br />
on to those things that are worth preserving while throwing out those things that are no<br />
longer serving the national interest.<br />
But it is a great enterprise, a great partnership and can I simply conclude by saying that<br />
everything that I have achieved in public life I owe to the great party to which we all<br />
belong. I would never have been a member of Parliament if I hadn't been the endorsed<br />
Liberal candidate for Bennelong, I would never have been leader of the Liberal Party of<br />
Australia if I hadn't been a member of Parliament of the Liberal Party of Australia and I<br />
would never have achieved the tremendous honour of being Prime Minister of Australia<br />
had it not been for the Liberal Party of Australia. So gathering here tonight, I feel very<br />
much one of you. That all of us together over the years have shared a great journey and a<br />
great experience and a great opportunity to work together for a cause to make our<br />
country, to make our State and to make our world a better place in which to live. </p>
<p>Fax from AUG 4 11<br />

We ought to preserve that sense of idealism and commitment that Liberals over the years<br />
have always had. It is a great Party, it's got great values, it's got great resilience, it's got<br />
great decency and we should never lose sight of that fact and we should never be reluctant<br />
to proclaim it to the rest of the Australian people. 23/ 88/ 97 16: 18 Pg:<br />
