PRESS OFFICE TRANSCRIPT 15 DECEMBER 1978<br />
Interview with Laurie Power on Side Steps of<br />
Parliament House<br />
Question<br />
Mr. Fraser, the last year has been a fairly tough one,<br />
economically and for employment. What are the prospects<br />
for the coming year?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
The prospects for activity, economic activity, I believe<br />
are much better indeed because the benefits flowing<br />
through from lower inflation, more stable cost base,<br />
is really starting to have an impact. I've been<br />
given indications on a subjective way, not statistical<br />
yet, but many firms have had a better time over the<br />
few months and are looking forward to 1979 with more<br />
optimisim and enthusiasm than they have had for<br />
many years.<br />
The BHP domestic production, steel production for<br />
domestic sort of purposes, is up very very significantly<br />
over the same period last year. That is as a result of<br />
a better situation in many Australian industries.<br />
Coming on top of that, the Australian farming community<br />
are facing better times than they have for a very long<br />
while. You've got all the major components: bumper<br />
wheat harvest and good prices. Sheep, beef, meat prices,<br />
are all good and that's coupled with a good season<br />
right around Australia. Farmers who for many years have<br />
had to button up are getting the benefit of these things<br />
with a more stable cost base and they will be getting<br />
on with deferred maintenance, replacing worn out equipment,<br />
repairing buildings renewing fencing.<br />
That will flow through to country towns, to the industries<br />
that service the great rural communities and rural<br />
industries and that, therefore, will provide a lift which<br />
I think our official forecasters often underestimate<br />
the impact of the rural community on Australia.<br />
So all of this means a much better outlook in terms of<br />
activity and that is good for Australia.<br />
I continue to be worried about employment and especially<br />
so in the face of the last wage decision because I don't<br />
want to see a situation develop in which, in a sense, there are<br />
two communities within Australia a prosperous section<br />
and then a group because of the price of labour is alhost<br />
permanently priced out of work. / 2 </p>
<p>-2<br />
Prime minister ( continued)<br />
Now, the price of labour: if you have a factory and<br />
you are producing something and you can't sell it all,<br />
you try and reduce the price if you can so you will<br />
sell more of whatever you are producing. But when<br />
people come to the price of labour, something which<br />
af fects the livelihood and the well-being of people,<br />
they don't react that way. They say " well, let's<br />
put up the price of labour even more". That plainly<br />
is going to make it harder to see that the jobs are<br />
created. It will provide a greater stimulus to people<br />
to go to mabhines that can replace labour. The 4 percent<br />
wage decision showed no appreciation or understanding<br />
of that.<br />
Question<br />
And that's the concern that's brought about the review<br />
of the wage fixing structure?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
It has yes. I have written to the Premiers about this<br />
because they have their own wage-fixing Tribunals.<br />
They often leap-frog the Commonwealth Tribunal.<br />
There is a very serious case in the oil industry in<br />
New South Wales where a State Tribunal gave a judgement<br />
three or four days after a Commonwealth judgement and<br />
destroyed the stability created by the Commonwealth<br />
judgement. Now these things are serious. They are an<br />
aspect of the problem. If we are to get to a better<br />
resolution of it, the States are certainly involved.<br />
The surveys show that overwhelmingly, the working men<br />
and women of Australia in Australian factories understand<br />
what I am saying. They also show that they agree with<br />
what I am saying. That they know that unreasonable<br />
wage increases do harm to their colleagues and to the<br />
bloke down the street who can't get a job. What we don't<br />
have in this country is a trade union leadership that<br />
will recognize, that will lead, will act with responsibility.<br />
I suppose there is some irony in this.<br />
You've got a Liberal Prime Minister in Australia who has<br />
these problems with his trade union leadership. You have<br />
a Labor Piime Mifiister in the United Kingdom who has<br />
exactly the same problems with their trade union leadership.<br />
But the view of the British Labor Government and of-my<br />
government, is virtually identical in relation to the<br />
consequences that flow from unreasonable wage decisions<br />
that takes jobs away from people.<br />
We ought to be prepared to show our concern, all of us,<br />
as a total community, in recognising that we all have a<br />
responsibility. 000---</p>
