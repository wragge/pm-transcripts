PRESS, R DO AMND TELEVISION COiNFERENCE GIVE BY THE PRIIE MINISTER,<br />
THE RIGHT HONOURABLE R. G. MENZIES IN CANBERRA<br />
ON SUNDAY, 2. TH1 JUNE, 1962, AT 3 P. M.<br />
QUESTION: PRIME MINISTER: Mr, Menzies, what do you consider were the positive gains<br />
of yeur mission as far as the Comrmon Market negotiations<br />
were concerned?<br />
Separately? The United Kingdom and the United States?<br />
The great advantage in the United Kingdom was, I think,<br />
th have discussions with the Prime Minister and the<br />
other Senior Ministers, and to learn as far as I could<br />
the strength of feeling that might exist; on what lines<br />
it went, and, of course, to remind them quite vigorously<br />
of our own interest in the matter, and the things that we<br />
regarded as important. I was following on on a visit by<br />
Mr. Mc Ewer, in which he had, with great command of all the<br />
details, discussed various commodities very closely and<br />
it wasn't rry business to endeavour to repeat that, because,<br />
quite frankly, I couldn't do it as well. He had been in<br />
the United States for similar reasons. vihat I wanted to<br />
do was to get into the broad a little if I may use that<br />
expression to try to form some political impressions<br />
and some political judgments. I think my broad<br />
impression in the United Kingdom was that it would be a<br />
mistake to think that there is a unanimous mind. There<br />
isn't. Various Ministers have various degrees of emphasis<br />
in their own minds, but I think there is, broadly, a<br />
considerable belief not by any means universally held<br />
that there is political merit in Great Britain going into<br />
Europe political merit from the point of view of<br />
strengthening Europe, of helping to keep Europe outwardlooking<br />
on the problems of the world and that, therefore,<br />
Great Britain inside ur. ope can exercise a degree of<br />
influence in the free world which she could not perhaps<br />
exercise outside Europe. That, broadly, is a view I<br />
think which is pretty broadly held in Great Britain on,<br />
both sides of Parliament. There are large minority<br />
groups, of course, on both sides on that matter. On the<br />
economic aspects of the thing, opinions are quite divided.<br />
There are those who think that economically it is vital<br />
for Great Britain to go into a European free trade area.<br />
I am using that, not in the old sense of the rather<br />
abortive attempt to forn; one earlier, but into the uropear<br />
Economic Community. There are others who think tc<br />
argument there is no better than 50/ 50, and there are<br />
some who believe that Great Britain will encounter some<br />
risks by exposing herself to the custom-free entry of<br />
commodities from Europe. It is not for me to say what<br />
the majority view may be. I thought when I was there a<br />
pretty broad view was fairly expressed by Mr. Gaitskell,<br />
when he said, in an excellent debate in the House of<br />
( bmmons, that he was not prepared to form a judgment of<br />
the value of the propcsed move until he knew what the<br />
price was arid that he himself would suspend his judgment<br />
until these negotiations, which have been gi. ing on with<br />
the Six, clarify themselves to a point where the price<br />
can be reasonably assessed. And that, I would have<br />
thought, represented a not uncommon view in London.<br />
It is an entirely practical approach to the matter.<br />
Against that hsi. tancy of judgment, I think that it is<br />
fair to say th , t there is a considerable volume of opinion<br />
which is impress. d by the political advantages that<br />
I have just referred to. In the case of the United </p>
<p>2.<br />
States, I really. wan-ted. Jo_. find-out, in my own fashion, whether the<br />
United States was, first of all, strongly persuaded, and when I say<br />
the United States I mean the A-dministration whether it was strongly<br />
persuaded of the political value of Great Britain being in Europe,<br />
and, secondly, whether it had a sort of dogma. in its mind against<br />
the Commonwealth special relationship and that it would be disposed<br />
to use pressure to give it fillip and it could to produce a<br />
bargaining result which was unfavourable to us. Now that is what<br />
I wanted to find out. I came to this conclusion after talks with<br />
the President and with all the senior 1d;: iinistrative people concerned<br />
that the approach of the United States is broader than that. I don't<br />
doubt for one moment that the Administration would like to see Great<br />
Britain in Europe. I think that what the President said in a<br />
communique which we issued, and in which he expressed his strong<br />
belief in the importance of the Commonwealth as a source of stability<br />
and strength to the free world, is quite right. was very greatly<br />
impressed by his lively and friendly interest in tne Commnonwealth,<br />
and, indeed, by his knovledge f it, what it stood for. I was also<br />
impressed by this, that he and his I was going to say " Ministers",<br />
I'll use che Australian term he and his Ministers, do not want to<br />
see the price fo-the Commonwealth too high. They recognise that we<br />
have interests. They recognise that, like themselves, we want to<br />
grow, want to develoo our business and want to have the best possible<br />
access to the expanded European Common Market. Indeed, one of the<br />
things that was said to me quite frequently in the course of<br />
discussions was, ' Well., look, after all, if Great Britain goes into<br />
the Common Market, you and w will be outside of it. iTe will both<br />
want to have access to that Market to the best possible extent. We<br />
will both want to have the European Common 1Market trading policies<br />
so as to enable us and you to expand our business. And, therefore,<br />
we have much in common. And, far from being dogmatic about the<br />
matter, they exhibited complete willingness to discuss with us,<br />
commodity by commodity with our experts, ways and means of achieving<br />
that broad result. I thought that was very helpful, and, in<br />
consequence, we arranged that I. Vesterman, who is in London, to go<br />
over and continue, in the light of my own talks, some of these<br />
discussions. Well, in both of those respects, or in all of those<br />
respects, in both of those countries, I thought some usefulness was<br />
achieved by the visit. Don't take me as overplaying this business,<br />
because nobody can tell until the end result comes out.<br />
Q. Before you went to London in this room at a Press Conference you<br />
made reference to the political aspect of the Common Market. I am<br />
just wondering whether or not the Queen's visit to Australia may be<br />
related in some way to that.<br />
P. M. Well, I have been reading, only today since I got up, some highlyengaging<br />
theories about the FDyal Visit being associated with the<br />
Common Market. Well, it's picturesque, and I don't want to deny<br />
people the pleasure of their own ideas, but it's quite untrue.<br />
As a aatter of fact, I duscussed with Her Majesty over a year ago the<br />
possibility of a Royal Visit. At that time I had in mind this<br />
year, 1962. At that time, the Common Market discussion hadn't in<br />
any way reached the headlines as it has since. Her Majesty told me<br />
that there were great difficulties about 1962, but she had hopes of<br />
doing it in 1965. But we allowed it to rest there, because I knew<br />
I wo" ld have further opportunities of discussing the details. As a<br />
Inatter of fact, my first discussion with the Queen on the question of<br />
a R! oyal Visit preceded this time any of my discussions on the Common<br />
Market. In my very first t. alk witi her we discussed it. To see in<br />
this some Machiavellian technique by which the Crown is going to<br />
soften the blow for us is, I t. ink, quite unreal. The Queen was -rury<br />
keen on coming here when I discussed it over a year ago. She is<br />
still very keen. Indeed, the one mistake I appear to have made abou' </p>
<p>the matter was that, instead of reserving the announcement of the<br />
Royal Visit until I got home, which I suppose would have been good<br />
politics, I said to the PCalze, " Will, just lot it go when you are<br />
ready," And, of course, I have only realised todo. y that I almost<br />
killed my own 2tory about the colmmiMi uo with Mr. Kennedy. But it<br />
shows how stupid you can boe or I can be, anyway. But, don't think<br />
of this visit by Her Majesty as some rmonouuvre by which she tempers the<br />
wind to the prospectively shorn lamb. Trine two things are not related.<br />
The Queen likes this country and she is looking forward to coning here.<br />
Q. In your discussions with the Queen, was it made clear by you that this<br />
tour should be a very inforlmal. one?<br />
P. M. We agreed about that as I say, it was well over a year ago. My<br />
view on that, and Her ! Majesty shares it, is that if each Royal Visit<br />
becomes a full dress journey State by State, locality by locality,<br />
then it will beco1me pretty tedious and will becomne, inevitably, pretty<br />
rare. You can't go in for that kind of thing very frequently. le<br />
have been trying for soie time now to try to achiive the result of a<br />
special visi'U for a special purpose. Prince Philip has been here<br />
already once for the Olympic ( Imes, a special visit, Princess<br />
, lexandra was here; she didn't go to all the States, the Queen<br />
Mother was here; Prince Philip comes out towards the end of this<br />
Syear to open the Coironwealth Games he'll come to C:. nberra, no<br />
doubt, bit it won't be a Continent-wide tour. On this occasion,<br />
the Queen, I think, would like to visit each State, but not just as a<br />
sort of State visit in which people are arguing about, i4hy don't you<br />
come to our town, because you went tu a-. nothr town last time?"<br />
But perhaps some particular occurrence in a State will attract a<br />
Royal 11sit, ie arc going into that this wee-k to see what can be<br />
worked out. But a visit which is directed to occasions, and not<br />
simply to localities, is the type of visit that I had in mind, and<br />
I know that that is what she would like. And if we can do that, then<br />
I think we may hnvu more visits by numbers of the Royal Family on a<br />
simpler, shortor basis, than we would have if they were all on an<br />
elaborate basis. I think the people of Australia will appreciate<br />
that and ricsponci to it,<br />
Q. It has been suggested that one of the ieribers of the Royal Faiily may<br />
comne out with the Royal couple. Can you corLu-ent on that?<br />
P. I. Nao, I can't. ve don't know about that yet.<br />
Q. Con you give us some idea of the date of the arrival in Canberra of<br />
the menibers of the Royal Tour. It has been suggested as February<br />
P. M. iell, the intes that I was discussing when I wrs in London have been<br />
altered since, because I think that they decided that they would like<br />
to make it a little earlier, so I no a. uthority on the date. But<br />
the Canberra date the fifty years Canbcrra date is what, March 12th.<br />
Yes. w1ell I would think thAt that would probably be about it. I l<br />
reminded. that the Australian dates will proably be abcut imid-February<br />
to mid-March and that would cover the period of this Canberra event.<br />
Q. Do you know which order the tour will take? Khich order of States?<br />
P. M. On no.<br />
Q. You hLav no idea of those things?<br />
P. MI. Those are the things that now have to be worked out.<br />
Q. iill Her Majesty take part in n opening of Parlianment?<br />
P.! v. Don't ask me any of that. These things have all to be worked on,<br />
vqhether you can have : n ounirg of Parlilament between the middle of<br />
February and the middle ofk i.. arch depunds on many circumstances.<br />
Q. 4ill you announce the a ppointrient of Minister in charge of the Haal<br />
Tcur soon? </p>
<p>PoM., Yes fairly soon If I decide to have one. I mean the method<br />
of running this tour has y:, t to be worked cut, I have had some<br />
rjrelimi-nary discussions btit T wouldn't take i for granted tha<br />
the old technique will Accessarily apply.<br />
Qo In saying that, do you mean that is because the tour will<br />
be more informal than on previous occasions?<br />
P. M Well, no. For other reasons, But I : ill deal with those<br />
when we are in a position to announce what the arrangements<br />
are,<br />
Q. In other words, we should not take for granted that there<br />
will be a Minister in charge?<br />
P. M. No, not for granted. I don't say there won't be, but don't<br />
take it for granted, and don't embarrass the prospective<br />
Ministers by offering them knighthoods in advance.<br />
Qo Will you be in a position soon to announce the name of the<br />
Director of the Royal Visit? Have you anyone in mind at<br />
this stage?<br />
P. M. I have nobody in mind at present, but I have a specification<br />
in mind, that's all. Naturally, we will announce all these<br />
things just as soon as we can, Whether it is in a week's<br />
time or a fortnight, I just don't know.<br />
QO Has any planning at all been undertaken at this stage?<br />
P. Mo Only in a very general way as the result of cables. But<br />
it can't be undertaken in detail till I have a chance of<br />
discussing with my own people here the kind of talks that<br />
I had with the Queen and with the Prince.<br />
Qa How long do you think it will be before you are in a<br />
position to announce at alcast a preliminary itinerary?<br />
PoM, Oh, I would hope oh, an itinerary I don't know. Look,<br />
as soon as I am in a position to announce % what m. rhinury<br />
there is, the general idea, I will do so-Ttihre will be<br />
no ttco: i . Lbuer mysterious abo-n but the order of<br />
events well, that may t-ir-a few weeks to work out.<br />
I don't know.<br />
Qo Coming back to the Common Market, do you now regard it as<br />
inevitaole that Britain will enter the European Common<br />
Market?<br />
PM, No, I don't think that could be regarded as a certainty.<br />
Q. Any particular roeson for that?<br />
P. Mo Well, I think I have, Just after I arrived in London, I<br />
had a talk with Mr. Marshall of New Zealand, and we made<br />
a statement which I thought was fairly commonplace, but<br />
we woke up the next day to find ourselves famous. But<br />
the gist of what we were saying was this There had just<br />
been announced on the very day that I flew in to England,<br />
a tentative agreement between the United Kingdom and the<br />
Six on hard manufactures, as they are classified. And<br />
this agreement amounted to this, that the existing<br />
preferences enjoyed by the Commonwcalth countries into<br />
Great Britain would be phased out by 1970, 1970 being the<br />
date on which the Common Market becomes, under the terms<br />
of the treaty, completely established. They would be<br />
phased out by two stops a'-nd then disappear in 1970. This<br />
has been called " The Procipice Solution" in various quarters,<br />
and that's not a bad description. We felt very strongly<br />
that if that principle was applied down the line to matters<br />
of greater importance to us, such as temperat, foodstuffs,<br />
through all these cormmodities, so that it became the<br />
established practice that the conditions of Great Britain<br />
going into the Coron-Market were that by 1970 all our </p>
<p>( c( ontcL0<br />
P. M.<br />
P. M.<br />
P. oi. preferences, right down the line, disappeared. We felt that<br />
if that happened that would be disastrous and that would give<br />
rise to most violent protests or. the part of the Commonwealth<br />
countries:, An. I am sure i. t would.' If Great Britain, in<br />
the negotiations, can do no better than that. as the<br />
negotiations proc-ad, so that in September, the position is<br />
that the best you c?, n get is the 1970 termination, then,<br />
I for one, think there is great doubt as to whether the<br />
United Kingdom Government would go, or whether the House<br />
of Commons would approve going in. Very great doubt.<br />
Decause, you see, that would present the problem, the<br />
dilemma in its most acute form. You now choose, as from<br />
1970, your special relations with the Commonwealth or your<br />
new relations with Europe. And this is a pretty stark<br />
choice. And I don't know it is anybody's guess but<br />
I would doubt, myself, very strongly, whether under those<br />
circumstances Great Britain would go in. And, indeed, you<br />
have probably seen the communiou's. It refers to the fact<br />
that I said to the President that it would be a grave<br />
misfortune if, after the negotiations, it turned out that<br />
the conditions laid down for Eritain's entry were unacceptable<br />
to Commonwealth countries on the grounds that they damaged<br />
Commonwealth trade and expansion. This, in reality, is<br />
one of the key things I wanted to put to the Amnecan<br />
Administration " If you w. ant to have Groat Britain in<br />
Europe, then don't allow your influence to make the price<br />
an unpayable one" o<br />
But sir, isn't it almost cert-in thtthe Six and America<br />
will seek to make the price reasonable?<br />
I come back, fooling that they probably will. I don't<br />
assume that the Six are goin to play this game too hard.<br />
I happen to believe that what was put to thom first of all<br />
by my colleague, Mr. Mcewen. and then by Dr. Westerman, at<br />
the Brussels conforence has had some effect on their minds.<br />
It certainly has affected some of them. You can't lump<br />
them altogether) because the French view is not necessarily<br />
the some as the Italian view.<br />
Following that up, do you got the impression that America<br />
is willing to lower her tariffs so that we could perhaps sell<br />
more on the Anmerican market, and, on the other side, the<br />
Six and America will agree to some kind of international<br />
agreement on bulk commodities?<br />
The President of the United States has, as you know,<br />
promulgated a law giving him a discretionary power in<br />
relation to tariffs within certain limits in the course of<br />
making trade treaties. He undoubtedly attaches great<br />
importance to this and thinks that, arrmd with the new<br />
powers, it nay be possible to make agreements and arrangements<br />
with the Six then the Seven perhaps which would<br />
tend to encourage trade from outside to inside the Cornrion<br />
Market area, which, of course, would help us. But how<br />
that will work out I don't know. All I know is that the<br />
American Administration attaches importance to it and it<br />
looks as if the Congress will accept it.<br />
Do you think that the terns will be clear by the tine The<br />
Prime Ministers meet in Sept,.-mbr?<br />
I think they'll be clear and unclear, Let me put it this<br />
way. When I went over, one of the reasons I went was that<br />
I was afraid that Juno and July might be the months of<br />
decision and it was better to be there when ninds were being<br />
formed. than to b, there \ whjn minds had been formed.<br />
I'mr not sure now, At that tine, thought that by the<br />
n aa 9 </p>
<p>P. M. end of Ju&amp; ly, thie package ,-,-ould be fairly tied up. Flut<br />
( orLtdj now I [ have doubts. Pr3a thr think the negot-iatis nr<br />
be complete Jlhen we mect in Sept. ember<br />
Q. Does that mean<br />
PQWI4eC~ lw~~ i oet et-me sey, what I want to say. I<br />
rather think that the negotiations -4ill not be complete.<br />
I may be wrong, but there w. ill have been a s-tfficient number<br />
of negotiations, on a sufficient number of comm-jodities, to<br />
give us the broad shnape of what is going on. It may be<br />
that tthe September conference will thecrefore de~ al withi<br />
something which is nct complete but wh-ich is suiCficiently<br />
formed to enable us to offer useful opir:. ions.<br />
So you see no need -to postpone the SeDptemter conference?<br />
P. M. I don't think so, no.<br />
Q. ~ Has ' the Eritishi Government given any undertaking to bring<br />
thlese mnatters to tht-e Septemirber conformee for discussion<br />
and decision rather than as a corilete pack.-age?<br />
P. M. 0 h, yes, that is somothing that is completely established.<br />

P. M. Look: What are you reading this TO me for? I did not<br />
hear it. You knowr my attitude on these matters. Years<br />
and years ago when I was a boy I was prepared to comment<br />
on what some man was supposed to have said. I grew out<br />
of that years ago.<br />
Qo Sir, in your discussions with Mr. Macmillan, did the<br />
question of Britain's preferences in the Australian<br />
market arise at all?<br />
P. M. No, not specifically,<br />
Q. The impression seems to be growing that yjur efforts on<br />
behalf of Australia could put you in the position where you<br />
could be used up as a champion by those who are opposed to<br />
Britain entering the Common Market. Could you comment on<br />
the dangers of that?<br />
P. M. I would not agree with that comment at all. I merely<br />
happen to have put as clearly as I could our own views on<br />
these matters, I thought very mildly and, I hope, clearly.<br />
Q. Would you say, sir, that you have the support of any other<br />
Commonwealth countries apart from New Zealand in the general<br />
line of thinking about the strength of the Commonwealth<br />
and so on?<br />
P. Mo I would have thought the views I have been uttering on<br />
this matter would have general acceptance in the Commonwealth.<br />
In fact, I would be surprised to know they<br />
were violently opposed by any British Minister.<br />
Q. While you were away, Mr. Townley has been in Indonesia<br />
and a certain controversy has arisen because he either<br />
wore an Indonesian uniform or somenthing close to it.<br />
Have you any comment to make?<br />
P. M. No comment, No comment at all,<br />
Qo Do you intend to ask him for an explanation?<br />
P. M. No comment.<br />
Qt Did you discuss with the Canadians while in London any<br />
combined Commonwealth attitude?<br />
P. M. I had some valuable discussions with Mr. George Drew, the<br />
Canadian High Commissioner, but it wasn't possible to<br />
have discussions on the political level because of the<br />
Canadian election,<br />
Q. You have no intention, have you, sir, of trying to got<br />
a cohesive Commonwealth attitude to the Common Market?<br />
PM., Wll, if you nean by that, do I intend to set out on some<br />
campaign with other people, no. I am a great believer<br />
in speaking for my own self, and the Government here.<br />
Q. Australia, then, is looking after its own interests?<br />
P. M. We identify our own interests with the interests of the<br />
Commonwealth. I dcline to believe that they are<br />

P. M. I think that's a mnatter on whiichi you engage in concrete<br />

PbMt Well, no, I think it is full of doubts. We might be<br />
kicked out i~ n August, and that would rather put me out of<br />
the running. I ihtstep under a bus. But subject to<br />
those accidents, politic. al arid physical. yes, I intend<br />
to bc there.<br />
Q. Wil ' Mr. McEwen also go?<br />
P. M, i iope so. Thiatls my present intention.<br />
9. Can you give us any lcte,, r information about the ',, lst New<br />
Guinea situation following yorur discussions abroad?<br />
P. M. 1No5 the impression of U Thant, wbvom I saw--in !, ow York, is<br />
that thec parties -11J. 1 resumce their conferenco, under the<br />
chaicmeanShiu of Ambssador Kionkor and if tliat is so,<br />
wol" J. we hcopce so,,, oo d will result.<br />
9. Did yNou discorn anly hardenillog in British or Ame,. rican<br />
attituides to t-uc west New Guinea sit-uation as the result<br />
of paratroope being dropped by Indonesia?<br />
P. M I think1 there'Is breCIi gr, 3atc -esentmnitn both places-against<br />
thei continuedI -se of force, and I have no doubt that that<br />
has boen conve yod by botha adLniri stra Lions.<br />
9. Did you see Lord Giadwyn whe n you weac in London?<br />
P. M. 1NT .<br />
Q On South East Asia in viewTv of the new agreoment with<br />
t'ne new Gov-r-imnt in Laos do you consider that AustraliaTs<br />
coritnitment in Thailand will need to continue?<br />
PIM. I think that would be&amp; rusing it a good deal. It is quite<br />
true t'nat an arrangement has boon made in Laos, but it<br />
remains to be s(. en that -i-t sottlos down in-to some-" thing that<br />
is durable, We all hope, it uill; but theo essence of it<br />
is that the. re should a neutral anrd independent, Laos not<br />
interfered wish by poopl( c from-z cutside. A-nd, as it has<br />
lackled any stability of groveirnment fo.-r some timne for a<br />
long time, I thinkE thant we r all h-, oping that t~ iu now<br />
arrang: cmAc nt will work., If it does , Jork1, and Laos in fact<br />
becomels a proet-ty sce. ttle-d community, thcrn it may be tkiat theL<br />
pot nti-al throat -to Tiha-iland as a SEATO country will<br />
diminishi and th-at, o1 cokirs wl be taken into account,<br />
a. 0 Q 2 00 LU/ i </p>
<p>Oo Coming back to Indonesia, Sir Garfield Ba. rwick will be<br />
there is a few days, I think. Will he indicate quite<br />
plainly to the Indonesians that we also resent their<br />
activities in Dutch New Guinea?<br />
P. M. Well, I've no doubt that he will. He can speak for himself.<br />
I spoke for myself in answer to a question on this matter<br />
in Washington.<br />
Q. One more question on South East Asia, This row between<br />
the Philippines, or what looks like becoming a row, and<br />
Britain, over the future of British North Borneo, which<br />
is more or less pledged to the Federation of Malaysia.<br />
What is going to be the future of SEATO if SEATO partners<br />
are warring among themselves? Have you any comment on<br />
this?<br />
P. M. No. You must work that out for yourself.<br />
Qo Will you be making a statement early in the Budget Session<br />
on your trip abroad?<br />
P. M. Yes.<br />
Qo For a debate?<br />
P. M. Yes.<br />
Q. Mr. Menzies, while you were away, Mr. McEwen asked the<br />
Americans to " get out of our hair" on the issue of<br />
preferendes. After your visit to America, do you think<br />
that they are likely to take a more conciliatory or<br />
constructive attitude towards getting out of our hair?<br />
P. M. Look, I'm not here to be using phrases. One of the<br />
things I was discussing in the United States, and I hope<br />
it will be allowed to remain there, is that we are not<br />
going to argue about words or about dongas or these ideas.<br />
We agree to disagree about those things. What we want to<br />
do is to have some constructive, co-operative discussions<br />
with each other to see what result we can got. And all<br />
that I Lave to say on that matter is, with the authority<br />
of the President, said in the communique. The greatest<br />
disservice that you could do to Australia on this matter<br />
is to take this, which is a useful document, and try to<br />
tear it up by harking back to other arguments, I'm not<br />
going to. </p>
