PRIME MINISTER 1<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON PJ. KEATING, MP<br />
OPENING OF BORDER CONTROL FACILITY, LAOS, 6 APRIL 1994<br />
On behalf of the Government and people of Australia I am very pleased to hand over<br />
this Border Control Facility to the Government and people of Laos.<br />
If the Mekong Friendship Bridge which will be opened next Friday is the door to the<br />
development of Laos and surrounding regions, this building is the key.<br />
This is the place where immigration, customs, police, bankin&amp; and postal services from<br />
the Government of Laos will facilitate the movement Of people and goods across these<br />
borders. It will be an introduction to Laos for many visitors.<br />
Like the Friendship Bridge, which it will complement, the Border Control Facility is a<br />
very tangible expression of cooperation and friendship between Australia and Laos.<br />
Australian companies designed and built it, drawing on traditional Lao design and on<br />
Lao technical and other assistance.<br />
It is a model of the best sort of development cooperation, because it involved not just<br />
the provision of infrastructure from outside, but also training for Lao customs and<br />
immigration staff'-some of them through sponsored overseas study teams.<br />
And today, specialists from the Australian Broadcasting Corporation are assisting the<br />
Lao television'and radio crews to ' cover this event as part of a five year regionaJ<br />
pro-ram Australia is sponsoring.<br />
Last September nothing existed on this site. Transfield Construction has completed<br />
the building since then, on cost and on schedule,<br />
Today we congratulate all those, both Lao and Australian, who have been involved.<br />
It is a splendid tribute to the expertise of Australian companies, and I hope it will<br />
encourage others to invest in the region. </p>
<p>TEL: 6. Apr. 94 15: 01 No. Olb F. UZ/ uz<br />

It is also a reminder of the friendship and good will which exists between our two<br />
countries. On Australia's side those who deserve credit include Maunsell Sinclair Knight, the<br />
project's consultant engineers; John Holland Construction, who were responsibile for<br />
creating the earth platform from paddy fields; Gauard Shelton, the supervising<br />
architects, and of course Transfield,<br />
All of these companies provide a first rate example of what Australian businesses have<br />
to offer in the development of infrastructure in South-East Asia.<br />
Of course, it is not only in engineering and construction that Australian companies<br />
offer expertise.<br />
In mining, power generation, telecommunications and in education and training<br />
Australians are active in Laos.<br />
Some 50 Australian companies are now operating here and many of them, I am pleased<br />
to say, are represented here today.<br />
The signature of the Australia-Laos Investment Promotion and Protection Agreement<br />
which Prime Minister Khamtay and I have just witnessed will give added confidence to<br />
potential investors from Australia.<br />
I welcome that. and the opportunities for further economic cooperation between<br />
Australia and Laos which are now being opened up.<br />
Mr Prime Minister, I welcome also the new opportunities which this Border Control<br />
Facility will bring to the people of Laos. and I hope it will remind all who pass through<br />
it of the enduring friendship between our two countries.<br />
And now it gives me great pleasure to declare this Border Control Facility officially<br />
open. </p>
