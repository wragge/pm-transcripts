Press Statement No. 504<br />
23 May 1975,<br />
GREAT BARRIER REEF PETROLEUM DRILLING<br />
ROYAL COMMISSIONS<br />
The Prime Minister, Mr. E. G. Whitlan, Q. C.,<br />
announced today that the Australian Government had taken<br />
decisions on the recommendations of the Report of the<br />
Great Barrier Reef Petroleum Drilling Royal Commissions.<br />
The Government agreed with the stand of the<br />
Chairman of the Commissions on the principal -term<br />
of reference ( No 3) that no drilling should be<br />
permitted in the area of the Reef until such time as<br />
reliable scientific information is available on the<br />
effects of oil on the Reef and its organisms.<br />
Mr Whitlam said that he would be writing to the<br />
Premier of Queensland immediately, seeking the<br />
support of the Queensland Government in this decision.<br />
The Commissions were appointed on 5 May 1970<br />
and their Report was presented to the two'Governments<br />
on 1 November 1974.<br />
The remaining terms of reference were<br />
largely subsidiary to No 3 and dealt with the risk of<br />
leaks during drilling: the probable effects of leaks;<br />
probable benefits of drilling; and appropriate<br />
safety precautions.<br />
CANBERRA, A. C. T. </p>
