SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, MR E. G. WHITL. AM, M. P. f<br />
AT THE INAUGURATION OF THE ANGLO-AUSTRALIAN TELESCOPE.-<br />
SIDING SPRING, NSW.<br />
WEDNESDAY, 16 OCTOBER, 1974<br />
THERE COULD BE NO MORE FITTING SYMBOL OF THE<br />
ANGLO-AUSTRALIAN RELATIONSHIP THAN THIS TELESCOPES IT<br />
COMMEMORATES A SPIRIT OF SCIENTIFIC ENDEAVOUR -AND A<br />
HISTORY OF ASTRONOMICAL RESEARCH -THAT BEGAN WITH COOK'S<br />
FIRST VOYAGE TO THE SOUTH SEAS. THE ASTRONOMERS OF THE<br />
ROYAL. SOCIETY IN THE LATE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY SET OUT TO<br />
OBSERVE THE TRANSIT OF VENUS. COOK FINISHED UP CHARTING<br />
THE EAST COAST OF AUSTRALIA. ASTRONOMERS WHO IN SUCH<br />
MATTERS, AS IN ALL THINGS, TAKE THE LONG VIEW WILL..<br />
DOUBTLESS CONTINUE TO ARGUE WHICH OF THESE PHENOMENA WAS.<br />
MORE IMPORTANT. THE FACT REMAINS THAT THE COLONISATION OF*<br />
AUSTRALIA By EUROPEANS HAD ITS ORIGINS IN AN<br />
ASTRONOMICAL PROJECT. TRADE FOLLOWED THE FLAG, BUT THE<br />
FLAG FOLLOWED THE TELESCOPE. IT MAY NOT BE TOO ROMANTIC<br />
TO SUGGEST THAT THE TELESCOPE ON THE ENDEAVOUR WAS AS<br />
POTENT A SYMBOI OF BRITAIN.' S IMPERIAL GREATNESS AS<br />
NELSON'S TELESCOPE ON THE VICTORY. MORE THAN TWO CENTURIES<br />
AFTER COOK'S VOYAGE, BRITISH AND AUSTRALIAN ASTRONOMERS<br />
CAN NOW PURSUE THEIR OBSERVATIONS OF THE SOUTHERN SKIES<br />
WITH THIS NEW ANGLO-AUSTRALIAN TELESCOPE THIS BRILLIANT<br />
EXAMPLE OF ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY AND PRECISION ENGINEERING<br />
WHICH WE SEE BEFORE US. om./ 2 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
I COMMEND PROFESSOR HOYLE'S VIEW. THAT " A-TELESCOPE<br />
IS A GOOD EXAMPLE OF THE THINGS WHICH OUR CIVILIZATION<br />
DOES WELL". ITIS A GOOD EXAMPLE OF THE'THINGS WHICH<br />
A TRUE CIVILIZATION ALONE CAN DO. ASTRONOMY IS ONE OF<br />
THE FEW SCIENTIFIC PURSUITS CERTAIN BRANCHES OF<br />
MATHEMATICS, CERTAIN BRANCHES OF. THEORETICAL NUCLEAR<br />
PHYSICS ARE OTHERS WHICH EXIST FOR-NO OTHER PURPOSE<br />
THAN THE PURE SEARCH FOR KNOWLEDGE. No ONE DOUBTS THAT<br />
ASTRONOMY HAS ITS PRACTICAL USES, GOVERNMENTS ARE<br />
FREQUENTLY REMINDED OF THEM BY ASTRONOMERS THEMSELVES.-<br />
NEVERTHELESS, THE TRUE GLORY OF ASTRONOMY LIES IN THE<br />
VALUE IT PLACES ON KNOWLEDGE FOR ITS OWN SAKE KNOWLEDGE<br />
OF AN ABSOLUTE AND FUNDAMENTAL KIND. No CIVILIZATION<br />
CAN REMAIN INDIFFERENT TO THE ORIGINS OF THE EARTH OR<br />
ITS PLACE IN THE COSMOS.<br />
ASTRONOMY IS RICH IN THEORIES BUT SOMEWHAT<br />
DEFICIENT IN PRACTICAL RESULTS. IN THAT RESPECT IT CAN<br />
BE LIKENED TO ECONOMICS. IN ITS ATTEMPT TO PROVIDE<br />
ANSWERS TO THE ULTIMATE QUESTIONS ABOUT MAN'S ENVIRONMENT<br />
AND HIS PLACE IN REALITY, IT CAN BE LIKENED TO RELIGION.<br />
IT IS NO ACCIDENT THAT THE HIGH PRIESTS OF ASTRONOMY<br />
CONDUCT THEIR NOCTURNAL RITES IN REMOTE TEMPLES ON<br />
INACCESSIBLE MOUNTAINTOPS. SO I THINK THERE IS AN<br />
EXCELLENT CASE FOR GOVERNMENT SUPPORT FOR ASTRONOMY, JUST<br />
AS WE GIVE STATE AID TO OTHER RELIGIOUS ENTERPRISES. WE<br />
ARE NOT ALONE IN THIS. THE AMERICANS, A PRAGMATIC AND<br />
HARD-HEADED PEOPLE, HAVE PROVIDED VAST PUBLIC FUNDS FOR<br />
/ 3 </p>
<p>-3-<br />
A SPACE PROGRAM WHOSE ULTIMATE PURPOSE IS TO ADD<br />
TO MAN'S KNOWLEDGE OF THE COSMOS AND HIS PLACE<br />
WITHIN IT. I WOULD NOT WISH TO JUSTIFY THE<br />
SCALE OF THAT EXPENDITURE, BUT I APPROVE<br />
WHOLEHEARIEDLY THE PURPOSES BEHIND IT.<br />
GOVERNMENT SUPPORT FOR ASTRONOMY HAS A<br />
LONG HISTORY. IT CAN BE TRACED FROM THE ANCIENT<br />
CIVILIZATIONS TO THE PRESENT DAY, FROM THE<br />
EGYPTIANS, THE PERSIANS, COPERNICUS, GALILEO,<br />
NEWTON AND KEPLER, TO THE PLATFORM OF THE<br />
AUSTRALIAN LABOR PARTY. OUR POLICY ON SCIENCE<br />
PLEDGES " PARTICULAR SUPPORT TO AREAS IN<br />
WHICH AUSTRALIA CAN MAKE A SPECIAL CONTRIBUTION,<br />
INCLUDING ASTRONOMY... </p>
<p>r -4-<br />
IN THE EIGHTEENTH AND NINETEENTH CENTURIES ASTRONOMY WAS<br />
RECOGNISED FOR ITS IMPORTANCE TO NAVIGATION AND<br />
CARTOGRAPHY. IT WAS SUFFICIENTLY IMPORTANT AT THE TIME<br />
OF FEDERATION FOR THE FOUNDING FATHERS TO MAKE SPECIFIC<br />
PROVISION IN THE AUSTRALIAN CONSTITUTION FOR THE PARLIAMENT<br />
TO MAKE LAWS WITH RESPECT TO ASTRONOMICAL OBSERVATIONS<br />
TWO SUCH LAWS HAVE BEEN MADE: IN 1930, WHEN PARLIAMENT<br />
ESTABLISHED THE COMMONWEALTH SOLAR OBSERVATORY, AND<br />
IN 1970 WHEN IT PASSED LEGISLATION SETTING UP THE AGREEMENT<br />
FOR THIS TELESCOPE AT SIDING SPRING. IT IS APPROPRIATE<br />
THAT THE STUDY OF THE LAWS OF THE PLANETS AND STARS SHOULD*<br />
BE MENTIONED IN THE AUSTRALIAN CONSTITUTION A DOCUMENT AS<br />
TIMELESS. AND IMMUTABLE AS THE HEAVENLY BODIES THEMSELVES.<br />
THE PRESENT AUSTRALIAN COMMITMENT TO ASTRONOMY<br />
IS EXTENSIVE. THE AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL UNIVERSI-TY OPERATES<br />
MAJOR OPTICAL TELESCOPES AT MOUNT STROMbLO AND HERE AT<br />
SIDING SPRING. MAJOR RADIO TELESCOPES ARE OPERATED BY THE<br />
C. S. I. R. 0. AND BY SYDNEY UNIVERSITY. THE UNIVERSITY OF<br />
TASMANIA HAS A GROWING INVOLVEMENT IN ASTRONOMY AND THERE<br />
ARE STATE GOVERNMENT OBSERVATORIES IN SYDNEY AND PERTH.<br />
THE AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL UNIVERSITY ASTRONOMERS HAVE GAINED<br />
A WORLD-WIDE REPUTATION FOR THEIR WORK ON THE STRUCTURE AND<br />
EVOLUTION OF GALAXIES, STELLAR STRUCTURE AND THE CHEMICAL<br />
COMPOSITION OF STARS. RADIO ASTRONOMERS IN C. S. I. R. 0. AND<br />
SYDNEY UNIVERSITY HAVE MADE IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTIONS TO<br />
QUASAR ASTRONOMY AND TO THE STUDY OF THE STRUCTURE AND<br />
EVOLUTION OF THE. UNIVERSE. </p>
<p>GROUPS WORKING WITH THE PARKES RADIO TELESCOPE HAVE<br />
RECENTLY DISCOVERED MANY DIFFERENT SPECIES OF ORGANIC<br />
MOLECULES IN THE GAS CLOUDS OF INTERSTELLAR* SPACE. THESE<br />
DISCOVERIES MAY THROW LIGHT ON THE PROCESSES THAT LED TO<br />
THE EXISTENCE OF LIFE ON EARTH. ASTRONOMERS AT SYDNEY<br />
UNIVERSITY HAVE PERFORMED WORK OF FUNDAMENTAL SIGNIFICANCE<br />
IN THE MEASUREMENT OF THE SIZES OF STELLAR OBJECTS.<br />
THE BUDGET LAST MONTH PROVIDED A GRANT TO ENABLE A STUDY<br />
OF A NEW INSIRUMENT TO EXTEND THIS WORKS<br />
ASTRONOMY FOR MANY YEARS HAS ENJOYED A WIDE MEASURE<br />
OF INTERNATIONAL CO-OPERATION BOTH AT THE INSTITUTIONAL<br />
AND THE INDIVIDUAL LEVEL AND AUSTRALIAN ASTRONOMY HAS<br />
BENEFITED FROM THIS. AUSTRALIA AND BRITAIN ARE SHARING<br />
EQUALLY THE CAPITAL COST OF THIS TELESCOPE, AMOUNTING TO<br />
$ 16 MI. LLION AND THE ESTIMATED ANNUAL OPERATING COST OF<br />
$ 1.3 MILLION. MANY OF THE ASTRONOMICAL FACILITIES IN<br />
AUSTRALIA WERE-BUILT WITH FUNDS CONTRIBUTED PARTLY FROM<br />
ABROAD AND Vt4NY OF THE ASTRONOMERS WORKING IN AUSTRALIA<br />
WERE BORN OVERSEAS. SOME ARE HERE AS VI'ITORS AND SOME<br />
ARE'PERMANENT RESIDENTS. THEY CONE FROi' A VARIETY OF<br />
-OUNTRIES INCLUDING SRI LANKA, INDIA, KOREA, THE PEOPLE'S<br />
REPUbL-C OF CHINA, ISRAEL, POLAND, THE UNITED KINGDOM,<br />
GERMANY, ' FW ZEALAND AND SWEDEN. THE DIRECTOR<br />
OF THIS TELESCOPE, DR E. J. WAMPLER, ! S AN AMERTCAN CITIZEN<br />
AND TWO OF THE THREE AUSTRALIAN MEMBERS ON THE AAT BOARD,<br />
DR WILD AND PROFESSOR STREET, WERE BORN IN THE UNITED KINGDOM.<br />
THERE ARE MANY AUSTRALIAN ASTRONOMERS WORKING OVERSEAS. </p>
<p>I AM. PROUD TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH THE INAUGURATION<br />
OF THIS TELESCOPE.. I AM PROUD THAT MY GOVERNMENT, IS<br />
CONTRIBUTING TO ITS COST.. ITS BEAUTY, ITS POWER, ITS<br />
PRECISION REFLECT THE HIGHEST CREDIT ON ALL'WHO DESIGNED<br />
AND BUILT IT. THOSE WHO USE IT, LIKE POLITICANS, WILL<br />
SIT THROUGH THE LONG REACHES OF THE NIGHT. YOU WILL<br />
CONTRIBUTE TO MAN'S UNDERSTANDING OF THE EARTH AND THE<br />
UNIVERSE. THE QUESTIONS YOU ASK ARE OF'TRANSCENDENTAL<br />
IMPORTANCE TO OUR KNOWLEDGE OF OURSELVES AND OUR SURROUNDINGS.<br />
IT MAY WELL BE THAT THE ULTIMATE ANSWERS YOU SEEK WILL<br />
ALWAYS ELUDE YOU; THAT IN THE LAST RESORT THE MYSTERIES YOU<br />
ATTEMPT TO UNRAVEL WILL REMAIN IN THE PHILOSOPHER'S COURT.<br />
FOR ALL THAT, IT IS GOOD TO REFLECT THAT HERE IN THIS<br />
BUILDING AND IN OTHERS LIKE IT, AMONG YOU AND YOUR<br />
COLLEAGUES, SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH IN ITS PUREST, MOST<br />
PEACEFUL AND MOST DISINTERESTED FORM WILL GO FORWARD FOR<br />
THE ENRICHMENT OF OUR UNDERSTANDING AND FOR THE BENEFIT<br />
OF FUTURE GENERATIONS.<br />
