    <content><![CDATA[<p>I express my thanks to Senator Ian Macdonald for the work he has done as a Minister in my Government since October 1998 and prior to that as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Environment and Heritage.</p>
<p> Senator Macdonald held the portfolios of Regional Services, Territories and Local Government and in recent years Fisheries, Forestry and Conservation.</p>
<p> He has had a long and very successful ministerial career.  I am particularly grateful for the loyalty and dedication he has brought to his role as a member of the team.</p>
<p> Ian Macdonald brought energy and skill to both of his portfolios. He especially understood the complexity of forestry policy. His advice to me, a little over a year ago, in relation to the Tasmanian forests was both balanced and prescient.</p>
<p> He recently handled the difficult task of promoting restructuring of the fishing industry, designed to place it on a more sustainable basis. This involved complex negotiations with many varied interests which he conducted with both patience and understanding.</p>
<p>Senator Macdonald also worked in close partnership with his federal ministerial colleagues to protect Australia's agriculture and environment through a series of valuable natural resource management initiatives.</p>
<p> Since entering parliament in 1990 Senator Macdonald has been a vigorous advocate for the people of Queensland and a hard worker for the Liberal cause in north Queensland. I know that he will continue to represent the people of his state with energy and commitment.</p>
