FOR PRESS RETIREM" ENT FROM THE SENATE BY SENAITOR<br />
SIR WILIANM SPOONER,, KCMG, M<br />
The following is an exchange of letters today<br />
between the Prime Minister, Sir Robert Menzies and Sir<br />
William Spooner<br />
" My dear Prime Minister,<br />
I refer to the various discussions we have<br />
had since I resigned from the Cabinet concerning<br />
my position in the Senate.<br />
At these discussions I expressed the view<br />
that when the time was opportune, I would like to<br />
retire from the Senate and you have been good enough<br />
to understand my desire to do this.<br />
For my part, I think it logical that having<br />
retired from the Cabinet I should make way for<br />
someone else with a political future to have the<br />
opportunity to obtain the benefits of that treining<br />
and experience in the Parliament which is necessary<br />
in politics, Naturally I regret leaving political life<br />
which has been so interesting and where I have made<br />
so many friends. I take pride in the fact that I<br />
know that the long personal friendship which you and<br />
I have enjoyed will continue.<br />
As you can imagine, I have given the matter<br />
a lot of thought. As a result, I am quite firm in<br />
my own personal desire to retire altogether from<br />
politics. That indeed, this being sog I feel it is<br />
proper that I should,<br />
I hope that you will not see any difficulties<br />
in the way of my now doing that which I would like to<br />
do. Yours sincerely,<br />
H. SPOONER </p>

" My dear Bill,<br />
Thank~ you for your letter of today. I fully<br />
understand and respect the reasons which have led<br />
you to your decision to retire from the Senate,<br />
I share your regret at leaving political life and<br />
I warmly reciprocate your references to the long<br />
friendship which you and I have both politically<br />
and personally enjoyed.<br />
You can look back with pride on the work<br />
which you hcve done for our country over so many<br />
years. No man could have devoted his talents to<br />
public service with greater fidelity and zeal,<br />
I have greatly admired your immense capacity for<br />
work and the thoroughness with which you have<br />
examined and directed the affairs of your various<br />
Depa rtments, I will greatly miss my constant contoct<br />
with you. Indeed your departure from the legislative<br />
scene leaves rfle with a genuine sense of loss.<br />
However your reasons for your decision do you great<br />
honour, I do not know who will succeed you but he<br />
will certainly inherit from you a great tradition<br />
and a fine example.<br />
With my warm regards, Yours sincerely,<br />
R. G. M~' ENZIES.<br />
CA N MRA,<br />
Th-th July, 1965. </p>
