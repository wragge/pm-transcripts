ELECTORATE TALK<br />
There is now a better understanding amongst most Australians of<br />
the difficulties facing many primary producers.<br />
In many cases prices have stayed at low levels while costs have<br />
risen sharply over the last five years. Thus it has become<br />
necessary for the Commonwealth Government to give greater<br />
assistance to primary industry. The present Government has taken<br />
positive action to assist primary producers.<br />
In the wool industry, the Government has substantially increased<br />
the reserve price and at the same time established that price for<br />
a minimum of two years, thus giving a long term stability to the<br />
industry that it has not had for many years. Particularly as a<br />
. resul. t-of that_,. and.. asa. result of the live sheep export to the<br />
Middle East, prices of sheep are also much higher than they have<br />
been for a long while.<br />
For dairy farmers we introduced substantial underwriting to<br />
enable higher interim payments to be made. We reintroduced the<br />
superphosphate bounty on a reliable basis and we have u~ aintained<br />
the nitrogen fertiliser bounty for an important and significant<br />
industry.<br />
A number of measures have been introduced to assist the cattle<br />
industry.* We abolished the Meat Export Levy. We have introduced<br />
a rural adjustment scheme with improved provisions, and assistance<br />
for farm build-up, debt reconstruction and rehabilitation, and<br />
assistance will also be provided for farm improvements, carry-on<br />
finance and household support.<br />
In the first Budget, we introduced the Income Equalisation Deposit<br />
Scheme. I believe it is one of the most far reaching reforms for<br />
rural producers, and has provided substantial assistance to farmers,<br />
helping them to cope with the problem of fluctuating incomes. It<br />
is interesting to note that this scheme was condemned outright by<br />
Labor. In the last Budget, the Government announced that it would set up<br />
a National Rural Bank. It will be a statutory body established<br />
by legislation which will be introduced this session. The Treasurer<br />
and Minister for Primary Industry are now working on precise details<br />
as to how the Bank will operate. The Bank will make sure that<br />
farmers get better access to finance and on terms which meet their<br />
special needs. it will work alongside existing trading banks.<br />
/ most of </p>

Most of Australia's rural industries rely heavily on export sales.<br />
Some 90% of wool clip, 75% sugar, 65% wheat and 55% beef and veal<br />
products are exported. In these circumstances, our agriculture is<br />
highly vulnerable to fluctuations in world markets, and the protectionist<br />
policies adopted by some importing countries. We have been<br />
endeavouring in every possible way to secure improved access to<br />
overseas markets for our primary products. For instance, we have<br />
worked hard to protect the beef market in Japan.<br />
The total Japanese imports of beef from all countries in 1973 was at<br />
a peak 127,000 tonnes Australia's share of that-market was around<br />
In February 1974, Japan closed their market to beef. This<br />
uncertainty of 1974 early 1975 was clearly unsatisfactory for<br />
Australian producers. That-market has now been reopened and from<br />
June 1976-June 1977 Japan imported 85,000 tonnes.<br />
In Kuala Lumpur recently I talked with the Japanese Prime Minister<br />
Mr. Fukuda, and agreed that officials from both countries should meet<br />
to try to establish a greater certainty and stability for the market<br />
of Australian producers. I am pleased that the first round of these<br />
talks will take place in Tokyo later this month.<br />
The Labor Government not only temporarily lost access to the Japanese<br />
market, they virtually lost access to the markets in the European<br />
Community. Now, for the first time, an Australian Government has taken the<br />
question of the European Community seriously.<br />
The EEC, with 260 million people, 40% of the world's trade and the<br />
wealthiest grouping of countries the world has seen, greatly inhibits<br />
access by agriculture exporting countries. And this is why I have<br />
appointed John Howard as Minister for Special Trade Negotiations to<br />
deal with European Trade. He will be leaving shortly on his first<br />
round of talks with the European Community.<br />
There has beensrre trade success in other areas. The sale earlier<br />
this year of 3 million tonnes of wheat to China is the largest ever<br />
negotiated. Australia has made further inroads into Middle East<br />
markets for lamb and the volume of cheese sold to Japan has continued<br />
to increase.<br />
In this coming week, the Treasurer will announce major improvements to<br />
the tax averaging schemes for farmers.<br />
The Government is implementing aspects of an IAC Report relating to<br />
averaging for farmers. The Government has decided that the present<br />
ceiling of $ 16,000 on tax averaging should be abolished. There will<br />
be no ceiling for farmers in the future. At the same time, we are<br />
making substantial changes in tax averaging that will greatly assist<br />
primary industry. The Treasurer will announce details during the<br />
course of this week.<br />
Further, the Government will examine other proposals designed to<br />
relieve the difficulties of the beef industry. Once decisions are<br />
taken, there will be no delay in their announcement.<br />
The Australian community needs to understand that those who depend<br />
entirely on beef for a living are in a very difficult position. / I am </p>
<p>3<br />
I am convinced however that in the long term there are good<br />
prospects for the beef industry. I am also convinced that<br />
sufficient assistance should be given to industry to carry<br />
on through the present difficulty.<br />
The present Governmenthas a solid record of assistance to the<br />
farmer. I do not want to dwell on the past, but Labor established<br />
the Coombs task force that destroyed the fabric of support that<br />
had been built over many years. Further, it abolished the superphosphate<br />
subsidy. It greatly put up costs through inflation.<br />
It sought to reduce the reserve price of wool. It had no understanding<br />
or sympathy for the farming community.<br />
Compare that record with our record of proposals to assist the<br />
wool, dairy and beef industries.<br />
In the next few days, further substantial measures will be<br />
announced to help the beef industry.<br />
Compare their record with the establishment of the Income<br />
Equalisation Deposits, the establishment of the National Rural<br />
Bank and the provision of the averaging for income tax, together<br />
with measures for the beef industry, which will be introduced<br />
this week. </p>
