PRESS* OFFICE TRANSCRIPT FRIDAYI 29 JUJNE 1979<br />
DOORSTOP INTERVIEW WITH PRIME MINISTER<br />
Question Mr. Fraser, the States' reaction to the Loan Council and.<br />
the Premiers Conference so far has been quite angry. How<br />
do you react in turn?<br />
Prime Mi'n-Is er<br />
I think the States' attitude is,. in a sense, predictable.<br />
One of the things that hasn't come through I think so far is<br />
the massive increas * e in general revenue grants of $ 644 million<br />
between 13% and 14%. Now, that's an increase that's committed<br />
by statute, by agreement with the Premiers, with the States, and<br />
that. of course flows through to them-That's $ 644 million which<br />
goes into a lot of their recurrent expenditure; can be used<br />
exactly as they want. It's much much more than enough to cover<br />
inflation. That means that if there is any shortfall in direct<br />
housing funds, or direct loan funds, it is for the States to make<br />
it up out of the $ 644 million, which is a very large amount of'<br />
money indeed. So if any Premier goes away from the Conference<br />
ultimately saying the reduction in housing funds or direct loan<br />
funds is going to be bad for the construction industry, for the<br />
building industry or for employment, that will be that Premier's<br />
own direct decision. Beca ' use the reductions are nothing like<br />
as great as the increase of $ 644 million which the States can use<br />
entirely and absolutely-as they themselves determine.<br />
Question Mr. Howard yesterday gave a very broad hint that if the States<br />
want more money they can raise it themselves. Now, the interpre:--on<br />
into that is that you want them to raise their own taxes.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
No. We don't want them to raise their own income tax. But,<br />
over the last couple of years a number of States, I think all of<br />
them, have said we, ' the Commonwealth, ought to cut taxes. We,<br />
the Commonwealth, ought to get interest rates down. But now the* 1<br />
are having to recognise that their urging of us to get our income<br />
taxes down has consequences for them. It has consequences for<br />
the funds we can make available for the States. Quite plainly,<br />
we are not in the-business of putting up taxes to make more<br />
money available to the States. We are not urging the States to<br />
put up taxes. What I am saying is that the States can get a<br />
proper balance into their own programmes by transferring general<br />
revenue funds some of that $ 644 million which they can spend<br />
entirely a's they themselves determine., We don't try and say<br />
you've got to spend it this way, you've got to spend it that way.<br />
They can spend it exactly as they like. I would hope very much<br />
that they do transfer substantial sums into the capital works<br />
area, I really would. / 2 </p>
<p>2-<br />
Question_ Nevertheless sir, a lot of the Premiers are saying that ini,<br />
real terms in the overall package, they are worse off.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
In real terms in the overall package they would be slightly<br />
worse off, yes. But that doesn't alter the fact that they can<br />
transfer those funds. A 13% increase $ 644 million in general<br />
revenue funds is a very very large amount indeed and I am sure<br />
you\; ogidr e wih tat. Now, what. the States are trying to<br />
concentrate on is the reductions in the loan area and in the<br />
housing area and they are saying " this is a terrible-thing".<br />
What they are not saying is that they can make up that shortfall<br />
overwhelmingly by a transfer from those general purpose funds<br />
and put it into the construction area if they themselves determine<br />
to do so.' It's only in very recent times that there has been<br />
any restraint at all on the growth of State Public Services and<br />
over the last three years we have had the most rigorous restraint<br />
on our own expenditures. You will find that States have all<br />
brought in Budgets which have introduced many new programmes,<br />
additional expenditure commitments, and at the same time, tax cuts.<br />
I am not saying they are wrong to do that, but being able to do it:<br />
in Budget after Budget does not indicate any particular stringency<br />
on the State Budgets. If you look at the growth of revenue funds<br />
over the last three or four years and these again are the funds<br />
they can use any way they like the growth has been very very<br />
large indeed. Much much more than enough to cover inflation and<br />
give them additional surplus funds that they can spend any way<br />
they like. In the major semi-government programme, the expansion<br />
in the that programme over the last four to five years has also<br />
been very great. That's why we are holding the programme this<br />
year. Governments have been trying to raise too much money on<br />
the markets and that has had a pressure in the capital market<br />
which I think has been an unhealthy one.<br />
Question_ Some of'the Premiers also said, sir, there have been no real<br />
negotiations here. It has just been a matter of you laying down<br />
what they are going to get and that's it.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
We hoped three years ago that it would be possible to come to a<br />
genuine negotiation on some of these major matters of concern to<br />
the States and to the Commonwealth. But unfortunately the nature<br />
of this conference makes it very difficult to achieve that on<br />
financial matters. In the industrial relations area and in the<br />
energy area, we had a useful and constructive discussion yesterday.<br />
But when it comes to money, they are all wanting money from the<br />
Commonwealt'i. But none of them is-going to say7-if any State<br />
ever was prepared to say, this is too much, I would then say a<br />
genuine negotiation is-possible. But no State has ever been<br />
prepared to say that. Every State is'always ready to say, this<br />
is not enough. That doesn't create a negotiation. To have a<br />
negotiation it's got to be possible for both parties to be<br />
on either side of the argument. The States have always been on<br />
one side of the argument: " Look, Mr. Commonwealth, it's not </p>
<p>-3<br />
Prime Minister ( continued)<br />
enough, you are being too mean. We want more dollars from you".<br />
That mean more dollars from you as taxpayers. That gets back<br />
to the taxes we have to raise. We are not inthat business. The<br />
general thrust has been to try and get taxes down. The States<br />
have supported us in that. ' But now, when there is some prospect<br />
of being faced with the consequences of that, -they don't like<br />
it too much.<br />
Question But nevertheless, because you have been unwilling to negotiate<br />
on money matters, at least one Premier said this conference has<br />
been a waste of time.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Well, I don't think it's been a waste of time. There have been<br />
some very useful discussions on a number of matters. But again,<br />
let me only say -that if I could see any State being on either<br />
side of the financial argument, then I could accept that there<br />
could be a proper negotiation. But when you have a situation thaz<br />
no matter what sum the Commonwealth starts with, no matter what<br />
we offer, the States say " that's not enough, the Commonwealth's<br />
mean", well, that doesn't create the possibility of a negotiaticn.<br />
I think that's one of the very unfortunate circumstances of the<br />
Premiers Conference: one of the reasons of course, why in our<br />
general philosphy we believe that the States ought to be respons--ble<br />
for raising more of their own revenue and responsible for<br />
determining how that revenue is spent because a State Goverrn'<br />
can never be truly responsible if it gets a very large amount of<br />
its funds from the Cornmowealth and then goes back to its own<br />
State and says " look, I'm sorry, I'd love to do this but I<br />
can't because the Commonwealth hasn't given me enough money."<br />
Unfortunately I think every State from time to time wants to<br />
hide behind the back of the Commonwealth in that particular way.<br />
Question Do you have any comment on the industrial stoppages at the moment-;<br />
Telecom and the Victorian transport strike?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
The transport strike I think is very much in the State jurisdict-on.<br />
I had some discussions with Mr. Staley and Mr. Viner last night<br />
about the Telecom dispute. Ministers will be discussing that<br />
again today. It is a very serious one indeed. Again, it is a<br />
question of employees, members of the trade union, not being<br />
prepared to accept arbitration. I think in Victoria they are<br />
striking against an arbitrated decision. People have got short<br />
memories. . The. arbitration system in Australia was established<br />
because, f a long while ago , the country tore itself apart with<br />
industrial disputes and those in charge of our nation's affairs said<br />
there must be a better way. So the arbitration system was devised;<br />
an impartial third party, the umpire, to determine what should<br />
happen when there is a dispute between employer and employee. / 4 </p>
<p>-4<br />
Prime Minister ( continued)<br />
Broadly, the system has served Australia well. But it will<br />
only continue to do that if both employers and employees<br />
accept the umpire's verdict, both when it suits them and when<br />
they don't like it,. so much. This is the greatest protection<br />
to employees. They don't have -to lose wages through time lost<br />
which they often never make up no matter what happens at the end<br />
of the dispute. The trade union leaders who continually<br />
advocate industrial action--the AMSWU who had their own national<br />
stoppage in support of wage claims--is utterly destructive of<br />
Ln: 2. own irsof their industrv's interests and of<br />
Australia's interests. In the discussions that we had with the<br />
Premiers yesterday, there was a very genuine desire on the part<br />
of all Premiers and on the Commonwealth, to discuss these matters<br />
together in great detail with our Employment and Industrial Relations<br />
Ministers and Attorneys-General. Discussions also with the<br />
peak councils of employers and of the trade union movement to<br />
try arnd sort out some of the difficulties and try and move Australia<br />
onto a better path. Again, it will take a degree of goodwill and<br />
a real desire, on the part of all of us, to have -this nation<br />
move forward. I appreciated very much the spirit of the Premiers,<br />
of all parties yesterday in that particular discussion, because<br />
their earlier knee-jerk reaction hadn't been entirely favourable<br />
to the Commonwealth suggestion. That disappeared yesterday. against<br />
the importance of the national considerations that confront the<br />
Premiers and the Commonwealth.<br />
Question Did you see the Telecom dispute, then, as an example of the need<br />
for this particular conference you were seeking?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I do. But what we've set in train with the States, is a longer<br />
term matter; to look at the very fundamentals of our industrial.<br />
framework to see whether changes are necessary, without any<br />
pre-conditions or pre-ideas about what those changes might be.<br />
Question Do you think those changes would remove such problems as with<br />
the Telecom dispute.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I think in the Telecom dispute it is a question of members in the<br />
trade union movement being prepared to accept an umpire's verdict.<br />
How we establish that mood throughout the Australian community<br />
is very difficult to judge.... But I know that all Premiers and the<br />
Commonwealth are determined to try and achieve o real advance. </p>
<p>5<br />
Question In the meantime, is the Federal Government going to make<br />
any initiatives on this dispute?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
The Ministers will be meeting on the Telecom dispute during<br />
the course of the day. 000---</p>
