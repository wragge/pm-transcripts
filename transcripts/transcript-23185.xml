    <content><![CDATA[<p>Christmas is such a wonderful time of the year.</p>
<p>Itâs a time to reflect, to count our blessings and to give thanks for all the good things we enjoy.</p>
<p>We are a good and generous people â and I hope this Christmas we will remember everyone who is doing it tough and lend a hand where we can.</p>
<p>This Christmas I pay tribute to everyone whoâs away from family because of their service to our country and our communities.</p>
<p>Across our country and overseas, members of our armed forces are serving our country and our values â so I thank them for what theyâve done for all of us.</p>
<p>On Christmas Day, like every day, our hospitals, our police stations and our fire brigades are ready and working.Â  So I thank the nurses, the doctors, the police, the firies and the emergency services personnel who are missing Christmas lunch or Christmas dinner because theyâre keeping our communities safe. We all hope you have a quiet day.</p>
<p>And I also pay tribute to those working for charities today to ensure that everyone whoâs less fortunate enjoys their Christmas meal too.</p>
<p>From my family to yours, I wish you a happy, a peaceful and a safe Christmas.</p>
<p>25 December 2013</p>
