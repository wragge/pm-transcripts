PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING, MP<br />
DEPARTURE DOORSTOP, RAAF BASE FAIRBAIRN,<br />
SUNDAY 20 JUNE 1993<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
J: Prime Minister, Tim Fischer says you are going to split the nation over<br />
Mabo. Is that a real threat?<br />
PM: Look, a little bit of restraint on Mr Fischers part would go a long way.<br />
That Is, he Is supposed to be a national leader not somebody rousing a<br />
National Party conference. Last Friday I wrote to the Premiers and the<br />
letter contaIns a number of gestures which encourages the development<br />
of a co-operative arrangement between the Commonwealth and the<br />
States. Some Premiers have seen that and others have not or have not<br />
wanted to, but that is the import of it and I am quite sure as<br />
Commonwealth officials speak to State officials while I'm away, when I<br />
return, I think, I will be able to open up a dialogue with some of the<br />
Premiers.<br />
J: What Is on the top of your agenda on this trip Mr Keating?<br />
PM: For Korea and China, Korea Is a large trading partner of Australia<br />
basically economic issues. China is now attracting substantial<br />
Investment from Australia, it Is about the third or fourth largest economy<br />
In the world and it is growing rapidly. So, largely ecoomIc Issues, trade<br />
Issues, questions such as APEC and general foreign policy and political<br />
issues.<br />
J: How Important Is trade between China and Australia?<br />
PM: It Is -important now, but It will become more Important. It Is already<br />
growing quite rapidy and the Chinese economy Is, as I say, about the<br />
third or fourth largest In the world and growing at 7 or 8 per cent a yewr.<br />
4w It Is very important to Australia In trade terms and also In Investment<br />
terms. r </p>
<p>N' 2<br />
J: Will you be raising the Issue of human rights with Premier U! Peng?<br />
PM: I will take the opportunity of expressing Australia's views about such<br />
matters, we always have and I will be again.<br />
J: Can human rights get In the way of trade issues though If there Is a<br />
problem there?<br />
PM: China Is a major country and a major country has to be dealt with on a<br />
breadth of issues and that is what I will be doing.<br />
J: You are not doing any sightseeing at all by looking at the itinerary..<br />
PM: Well, It Is three days in each place and it is pretty full of official<br />
engagements. I hope to make the best of It, cover as much ground as I<br />
can In the time I have got available which is a week. But again, for~ two<br />
countries it Is enough.<br />
ends </p>
