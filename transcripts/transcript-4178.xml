FOR PRESS 4 July 1976<br />
JAKARTA<br />
I have instructed our Ambassador in'Jakarta to pass a<br />
message to President So. e--harto in which I repeated<br />
to him the great importance which I attach to Australia's<br />
relations with Indonesia and assured him of the respect<br />
I have for him personally and for his leadership of Indonesia.<br />
I took this step because of possible misunderstandings arising out<br />
of press reports, some of them inaccurate, which referred to<br />
my recent talks in Peking.<br />
The Ambassador saw President Soeharto on Saturday morning.<br />
As well as handing over my personal message to the President<br />
he gave some background to the President on the brief<br />
references to Indonesia and South East Asia in my talks<br />
with the Chinese Premier in Peking.<br />
Pre sident Soeharto asked the Ambassador to -convey<br />
to me his warmest regards and his appreciation that the<br />
m isunderstandings resulting from reports in the press on<br />
this matter had now been dispelled.<br />
The President told the Ambassador that Indonesia also attached<br />
great importance to its relations with Australia.<br />
I am looking forward to a full exchange of views with.<br />
President Soeharto when I visit Indonesia at a mutually<br />
convenient time, probably next October.<br />
