    <content><![CDATA[<p>I am pleased to announce that His Royal Highness the Prince of Orange and Her Royal Highness Princess MÂ xima of the Netherlands will visit Australia from 23-28 October 2006.</p>
<p>Their visit helps to mark 400 years of relations between our two countries and will conclude a year of commemorative activities, including the successful visit to Australia earlier this year by the Prime Minister of the Netherlands, the Hon. Dr Jan Peter Balkenende.</p>
<p>The royal couple will visit Canberra, the Northern Territory, Tasmania and Sydney before flying to New Zealand.</p>
<p>The first recorded Europeans to set foot on Australian soil arrived in March 1606 on board the Duyfken, a Dutch East India Company ship under the command of Captain Willem Janszoon.</p>
<p>Australia's relations with The Netherlands are close and continuing to develop. Two-way trade between the two nations is now worth more than $3 billion and each year more than 60,000 Australians visit The Netherlands.</p>
