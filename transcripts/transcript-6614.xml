EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERYJ~~~ PRIMES MAINISTE<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW WITH MAX WALSH 10 APRIL 1985<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
WALSH: Prime Minister, the latest reports suggest the<br />
Australian dollar is climbing up off the floor. Is this<br />
due, in part, to official intervention in the interest rate<br />
PM: It is very difficult in this area of the value of the<br />
dollar to attach weights, Max, to' all the factors involved.<br />
Simply, let me say this, that when we abandoned the monetary<br />
targets, for what we believed at the time were good and<br />
suff'icient reasons. I think there was some perception in<br />
the markot that this was goingy to mean somne weakening in<br />
monetary policy to the extent that that perception was there<br />
that would have been one factor perhaps to what happened to<br />
the value of the dollar. I think it has become increasingly<br />
evident in recent days that there has not been any weakening<br />
Of. monetary policy and that therefore this may now be<br />
reflected as you suggest in the value of the dollar. But I<br />
guess there are a number of factors. You are dealing with a<br />
very, I think, irrational sort of market these issues.<br />
WALSH: Are you surprised that this second fall of the<br />
Australian dollar, ) bviously at one stage the<br />
fundamentals suggest there should be a fall. Are you<br />
surprised?<br />
PM: That it went further?<br />
WALSH: Yes.<br />
PM: Yes, I think we were all surprised, and a little bit<br />
concerned Max, that it went beyond what I think..<br />
indicated it was appropriate. But I think the community<br />
will appreciate the-fact that the Government hasn't panicked<br />
about this. And we haven't panicked, Max, I think for what<br />
you would regard as good reasons, and that is that the<br />
fundamentals of the economy are strong. And further<br />
evidence has come out this morning, and the reports show the<br />
continuing strength. There is no doubt that the Australian<br />
economy, through this financial year ' 84-185, is going to do<br />
even better than the quite optimistic forecasts that vieze<br />
put forward at Budget time. I think that is becoming more </p>
<p>and more obvious and it will reflect it.<br />
WALSH: B ut whtn the exchange rate behaves, as you put it,<br />
in a way adverse to that which the fundamentals suggest,<br />
that suggests there is a lack of confidence on the part of<br />
the market.<br />
PM: That is one of the reasons. And I think<br />
WALSH: Can I put to you in that case just a number of the<br />
reasons that have been advanced that there is a lack of<br />
confidence. First is * of course that you have alleged to<br />
have lost control of monetary policy, now that is not<br />
the case as demonstrated by the way in which interest rates<br />
. have moved. And in fact interest rates have moved up in<br />
Australia quite severely and substantially of late.<br />
PWM: TherWeA has obLeehnw naS mioviceeo nHupwha curfds,: e afly edrs. rmRo meeBsa aecnrtkvio<br />
in the market place.<br />
PM: There has obviously been a degree of action there--n the<br />
market place, yes.<br />
WALSH: The second area where there has been some concern<br />
that you have perhaps lost control of your own economic<br />
policy by the actions of the Caucus.<br />
PM: Well, that is of course unfounded. I mean, you are<br />
right in putting forward..<br />
WALSH: these are the arguments being advanced. And you<br />
know that that followed the defeat in Caucus of Senator<br />
Walsh's suggestion perhaps tertiary fees should be<br />
reintroduced. It was seen as Caucus flexing its muscles in<br />
the budgetary making prccess. Now, it was also be-en<br />
suggested that you should issue an economic statement to<br />
reassure people this is not true.-Is there any prospect of<br />
yotfdoinC this?<br />
PM: Well, let's get the perspectives in the order in which<br />
they seem right. Paul Keating and _ 7have been at the<br />
forefront of the Government's economic policies from the day<br />
we came into office and we remain in that position, have<br />
always had the view that it would be possibly appropriate to<br />
make certain announcements on the budget issues prior to the<br />
budget so that we could get the full year revenue benefits<br />
of an announcement being made and operative before the<br />
commencement of the new financial year. So there were very<br />
sound reasons for doing that. So if we do make such a<br />
statement or a series of statements, which is very possible,<br />
then it will not just be for reassurance or stroking<br />
considerations, stroking the market. Although I accept that<br />
r. flfl , fl </p>
<p>it could be an important part of strengthening the market<br />
perceptions about our dire. ction:-of economric policy. But<br />
there will be intrinsic reasons why it ii-akes good sense to<br />
make some statements, statement or statements, prior to the<br />
budget. WALSH: So that would of course be before Parliament rose,<br />
it rises about mid-May. But another area where I believe<br />
there is some concern, is the whole debate about tax reform<br />
and the proposed summit, and the belief that the Government<br />
PM: On that, I don't want to avoid Could I just make<br />
one point in regard to the area that you have just appeared<br />
* to lead. I want to assert as strongly as I possibly can<br />
that the appropriate processes of giving effect to our<br />
budgetary strategy, our general economic management and our<br />
fiscal approach is firmly within Government control. It is<br />
true that there was that incident in regard to the idea that<br />
Peter Walsh had in regard to tertiary fees. It is<br />
unfortunate, I think, that the ERC, Expenditure Review<br />
Committee, was not able to deal with that fully and that<br />
there was a discussion and a decision in the Caucus. That<br />
was somewhat unfortunate. But I can understand that there<br />
was some concerns about this issue. But I want to make it<br />
quite clear that the Government is firmly in control of<br />
budgetary policy and I want to if I may use the<br />
opportunity of your program, to assert that the Government's<br />
commitment to the trilogy and to reducing the budget<br />
deficit is still in place and will be achieved.<br />
WALSH: If I could just take up on what you said there, you<br />
used the word unfortunate to describe the process by which<br />
Caucus prevented it from being considered first by the ERC.<br />
Can you stop that from happening in the future?<br />
PM: I believe that that is not a thing Ithat will be<br />
repeated.<br />
WALSH: Do you feel that your Caucus colleagues are aware of<br />
the disquiet that that is likely to cause in the monetary<br />
markets, that sort of behaviour?<br />
PM: I think that they recognise the difficulties if that<br />
were to become a practice and it won't become a practice.<br />
WALSH: Now another area which is vainly exercising the mind<br />
of the money market,-especially I suspect the people<br />
overseas, is the entire debate on the methods being<br />
approached to tax reform. It does appear as though the<br />
Government has a number of views on this, that there are<br />
people in the Cabinet with quite diverse views. And would<br />
you accept that it wouldn't be surprising if people abroad<br />
hearing a Labor Government in Australia talking of tax </p>
<p>reform to be a wee bit apprehenisive?<br />
PM: No, -I would be surprised if r-ational decision-makers in<br />
the market were upset by the process because after all the<br />
realities are, not only for Australia, but for any western<br />
country, where you are approaching reform of your fiscal<br />
system. Firstly, that there are going to be widely diverse<br />
views within the community and within any government as to<br />
all the elements of reform package. That is perfectly<br />
natural, it is what happened in every other country where<br />
they have considered tax reform. May I say both before the<br />
event, and after having just been to Canada, you know the<br />
value to approach this in the early 80' s of substantial tax<br />
reform. I had arguments about it beforehand and I certainly<br />
had a lot of arguments about it since. So that is a normal<br />
thing. The second thing to say, is that when you are<br />
talking about tax reform there is a range of considerations<br />
you have to take into account. You have to take into<br />
account economic efficiency conisiderations. You have to<br />
take into account equity considerations and one of the<br />
unfortunate facts of democratic life is, and also I guess<br />
one of the beauties of democratic life, that you can't<br />
always meekly reconcile considerations of economic<br />
efficiency and of equity. And what is happening, openly in<br />
this country, is that the debate is going on. The mind of<br />
the Government is not closed. The summit is not going to be<br />
a charade. By the time we go there there will have been<br />
distributed widely in the community, particularly the<br />
participants, a white paper which will set out essentially<br />
two things, Max, the inadequacies of the existing system,<br />
and a range of packages which will be directed to making<br />
people think about alternative ways of how we can have a<br />
better tax system. We will not go there with our mind<br />
finally made up. We will want to get the benefit of the<br />
input of people. Now that seems to me, Max, to be a process<br />
which should be welcomed, because it is more likely out of<br />
that process that you are going to get a system which is<br />
economically as efficient as possible, but also matches<br />
community concerns because ultimately what the Australian<br />
community must want and what international people interested<br />
in Australia must want, is to see the emergence of a system<br />
which has as much community support as you can possibly get.<br />
WALSH: It has been suggested that you are going rather cool<br />
on the idea of a major tax reforms?<br />
PM: Well, I have noticed over the years media<br />
interpretation of Hawke's position, they have been wrong<br />
much more often than they have been right. I don't think<br />
they are changing their habits on this occasion.<br />
WALSH: Well, would you think the strong prima facie case<br />
still exists for a shift away from direct taxes to indirect<br />
taxes? </p>
<p>PM: I have always said that in regard Lo what this<br />
Government,. or for that matter an-government, should do<br />
about tax reform, is that they have gct to have a mix of<br />
considerations of economic efficiency and equity and public<br />
acceptibility. It is a nonsense to create a situation which<br />
is not going to have general acceptibility because you will<br />
create chaos, confusion and uncertainty within your economic<br />
and social community. And so I say that there are<br />
arguments, I don't in any sense resile from the arguments<br />
that there are for a substantial lessening of the direct tax<br />
burden. And if you are.-going to do that, we have roughly<br />
given levels of expenditure, then you have got to have<br />
revenue to meet that requirement. Now you have also got to<br />
be sure, Max, that if you move that way that you can have<br />
adequate compensation mechanisms for those who will be<br />
adversely affected by the regressive, potential regressive,<br />
of a change to indirect tax. And we have got to be<br />
satisfied that we can for all significant sections have<br />
adequate protection mechanisms. So all those things have<br />
got to be taken into account.<br />
WALSH: When would you expect that the Australian electorate<br />
would have a fairly clear idea of your intentions,<br />
immediately at the conclusion of the summit?<br />
PM: Not immediately. I wouldn't think immediately at the<br />
conclusion of the summit, but in the not too distant future<br />
after that because you have got to then move from the stage<br />
of public discussion and the government informing itsel. f as<br />
to what is appropriate, you have then got to move to the<br />
stage of getting legislation iLn place to give effect to<br />
changes. So I would think in a relatively short time after<br />
the summit we would be starting to do that.<br />
WALSH: Prime Minister, if I could just return to that<br />
central theme I was stating. The areas of concern perhaps<br />
undermining confidence in the Australian dollar. Perhaps<br />
the most difficult and delicate is your relationship, ' Che<br />
Government's relationship with the ACTU and the Prices and<br />
Incomes Accord. As your former Secretary of the Treasurer,<br />
John Stone, pointed out, as others have, that the commitment<br />
of the Accord to indexing wages combined with a depreciating<br />
dollar threatens an inflationary spiral. Do you concede<br />
that that relationship exists in theory at least?<br />
PM: Yes, sure. But let me make these points Yo u<br />
mentioned commentators, you mentioned one in particular.<br />
Many of those commentators, including the one in particular<br />
that you mentioned, when we came to office and we talked<br />
about the concept of the Accord, were full of scepticism and<br />
and derision. The facts show that their scepticism and<br />
derision have been not only ill-founded but totally wrong<br />
because the Accord has been of central importance in<br />
producing the very magnificent economic performance that we<br />
-r. t . Z~ tL3C~ Z~ fl~ La? </p>
<p>have witnessed in this country. I don't think there is a<br />
commentator now within Australia or externally whc disputes<br />
that fact.. Now, within the processes of the Accord there<br />
are, by definition, provisions for consultation between the<br />
Government and the Trade Union movement. We have made it<br />
clear that the Government is prepared to adapt its economic<br />
policies to meet the requirements of the existing and<br />
foreseeable economic situation. That is how we have<br />
operated to this point, that is how we will operate into the<br />
future. Now, by the time the first question arises, that is<br />
the September case for the 6 monthly indexation, you will<br />
then have the March and the June quarters. Now, obviously<br />
very little impact in the March quarter of th. e devaluation<br />
processes, some in June. Now we will be monitoring this as<br />
we go up to Septem~ ber and it would be quite illogical and<br />
politics-and bad economic management in April to say in<br />
respect of September exactly what you are going to do<br />
because you need to know as far as you can what has been the<br />
impact of the devaluation on the CPI movements that will be<br />
an issue then. Let me say this, Max, that I think according<br />
to my own reasoning and the discussions I have had with our<br />
advisers that I believe that by then it will be of very<br />
small dimension. It may be that as you go into the later<br />
period, in the next year it will be a further six months,<br />
that it would be of greater dimension, and that you would<br />
feel more pressure to adjust your position to meet that. I<br />
simply wai-d to make this statcment unequivocally to the<br />
business community, the financial markets of Australia, this<br />
Government in 1985 and beyond will continue the policy that<br />
it has very successfully followed through the first two<br />
years of Government and that is that we will make the<br />
decisions which are necessary to ensure the economic welfare<br />
of the community. We are not going to preside over a<br />
situation where the unquestioned benefits to the Australian<br />
economy of the devaluation that has taken place, and that is<br />
those benefits that we remind viewers are not simply the<br />
obvious one for farmers and miners in the export markets,<br />
but they. are very considerable benefits for Australian<br />
manufacturing industry. It should lead to a significant<br />
increase in activity. We are not going to allow those<br />
bene'fits to be dissipated by inappropriate decisions in<br />
other areas of policy.<br />
WALSH: I don't think I do Mr Crean, the Vice President of<br />
the ACTJ, an injustice when I say that he is quoted as<br />
saying virtually that the indexation factor in the Accord in<br />
non-negotiable, and you say it is.<br />
PM: WellI I say that the appropriate economic policy stance<br />
of Government is something under the Accord which is<br />
recognised as being necessary for the government to be<br />
taking into account, that is by definition, but also<br />
something which it is appropriate for government to discuss<br />
with the trade union movement at any given time. We will do<br />
A. ~. v^ CW T </p>
<p>that. No only in regard, may I sey, i i regard to<br />
indexation, if we adjudge ! t necessary. But let me just<br />
parentheti-cally make this point, don't let th~ e market, the<br />
financial market or the economic community of Australia,<br />
make the mistaken assumption that it is indexation which<br />
alone impose a problem in regard to wage movements. If you<br />
didn't have wage indexation, it is arguable beyond rebuttal,<br />
that if you had the free market situation, the movement in<br />
wages would be very, very much higher than with indexation.<br />
So what has got to be done is to balance the benefits that<br />
the Accord and indexation, at the same time take into<br />
account as we will, the deleterious effects there may be in<br />
certain circumstances by not going too far. The alternative<br />
which would be much higher wage movements in the absence of<br />
indexation. Now the other area of course in which we will<br />
take into account economic requirements and including the<br />
impact of devaluation, is in regard to the productivity<br />
case. I think there is a perception out there in the<br />
market, Max, that there is a productivity case coming up<br />
later this year which is going to lead to some-three per<br />
cent increase in labour costs out of that productivity case.<br />
I don't believe that that will happen and certainly the<br />
position of the Government will be that any improvement in<br />
conditions associated with the processing of a productivity<br />
type case approach before the Commission will need to be<br />
phased in over time so that it corresponds with the<br />
emergence of the actual productivity. You can't be talking<br />
about in 1985 giving some increases on productivity grounds<br />
to productivity which occurred in the past.<br />
WALSH: Now you hope and expect that when all your arguments<br />
as presented here today are understood by a rational market<br />
that the present position of the Australian dollar will<br />
improvie vis-a-vis the American dollar?<br />
PM: While I don't regard myself as being the determinate<br />
person as to what happens in the market..<br />
WALSH: I was suggesting that they understood and appreciate<br />
the arguments<br />
PM: Yes, I do say this, that if they do understand all the<br />
arguments that I have put then there would be an even<br />
further improvement. it is coming up again. But I believe<br />
that the fundamentals of the Australian economy are stronger<br />
than virtually any other economy in the wt.' rld. There is<br />
more solid reason for continuing optimism about the<br />
performance of the Australian economy than just about<br />
anywhere else. If you look at the fundamentals of growth<br />
and employment and inflation and of economic strigency in<br />
policy making and the constraints imposed upon itself by<br />
Government, I think we can compare ourselves more than<br />
favourably with just about any other economy in the world. </p>
<p>WALSH: Prime Minister, just on a disconnected subject. The<br />
visit next week of the Secretary of the Communist Party of<br />
C~ iina, Miu. Yaobanq, it is being reported that there will be<br />
no breakthrojugh in your proposed iron and steel plan with<br />
China where they supply iron ore from us<br />
PM: This is another example of where the media again, for<br />
reasons which I don't comprehend, either does not understand<br />
or doesn't wish to understand..<br />
WALSH: If you could just tell me the actual situation.<br />
PM: The situation is quite clear that in the 12 months<br />
since my meeting and discussions with Premier Zhao in<br />
Beijing, February of last year, there has been enormous<br />
* progress. Now what we are talking about in particular in<br />
regard to* Western Australia are two negotiations. One in<br />
regard to the opening of the joint venture at Channar, that<br />
is the iron ore, which I want you to understand and I think<br />
you understand, will be China's first joint venture outside<br />
of China. Now they are determined and in my view perfectly<br />
understandably, they are determined that this is not just to<br />
be seen as the finalisation of that venture, but it will be<br />
looked at by them and by others as some sort of model, and<br />
it will be examined very-closely in regard to other possible<br />
joint ventures. So they are determined that out of ' the<br />
multitude, the hundreds of details that are involved in such<br />
a complex negotiation, that it be done to their<br />
satisfaction-Equally, at our end, the Australian<br />
enterprise has got to make sure that its interests are<br />
protected. Now, most of the negotiations have been<br />
finalised. From the interests of both sides and we are<br />
quite relaxed about this, totally relaxed, we believe that<br />
it should be finalised in a way which is to their mut'. a1<br />
satisfaction. That will occur.<br />
WALSH: It will be consum'~ ted. The second one, however, is<br />
the reopening of the Kwii'ana.<br />
PM: The reopening of Kwinana. I make a lot of the same<br />
comments there that,'<br />
WALSH: With the same degree of confidence?<br />
PM: I think with the same degree of confidence. I believe<br />
that it is clearly going to be a venture that is in the<br />
interests of both China and of Australia in general and the<br />
company in particular.<br />
WALSH: But it won't be a joint venture now?<br />
PM: That's not a, well it was never t alked about as a joint<br />
venture in the sense that Channar is. But equally Max there<br />
are a great deal, the majority of the issues have been W </p>
<p>settled. There are still some that h-iven't. * Now it is much<br />
more sensible, and I think the Chinese more than any other<br />
nation have a good sense of time perspec. tives, it is much<br />
more sensible that you work something out which is going to<br />
be certain of satisfaction to both sides over the long<br />
period of time for which it will be operated. I am more<br />
than relaxed about the relationship between us and more than<br />
relaxed with I am certain of the consummation of a number of<br />
deals, not merely in the iron and steel industry, but<br />
agriculture. We are going to have an enormously fruitful<br />
relationship with China, with almost a quarter of the<br />
world's population, rising standards of living, a revolution<br />
in their approach to economic policy making which is opening<br />
them up to the West. And there is no country, I have said<br />
this before and I will repeat it here, there is no country<br />
in the world which has a better relationship with China<br />
than, I believe, than Australia. And we, and they, will<br />
benefit from that.<br />
WALSH: Prime Minister, thanks very much.<br />
PM: Thank you very much Max. </p>
