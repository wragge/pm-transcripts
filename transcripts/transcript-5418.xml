PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA AUGUST 17 1980<br />
ELECTORATE TALK<br />
Local governments and local authorities throughout Australia<br />
know now that they will benefit this year from a substantial<br />
increase in Commonwealth funds. The Commonwealth's<br />
undertaking to raise the proportion of personal income tax<br />
collected going to local government to 2% has now<br />
been fully implemented. As a result, the current allocation<br />
for 1980/ 81 has gone up by more than 35% to more than<br />
$ 300 million.<br />
At least 30% of these funds are to be distributed to all<br />
councils on a per capita basis with the balance being allocated<br />
by individual State grants commissions on a needs basis.<br />
As well as this flow of income tax funds to local government<br />
in untied grants, there has been a significant shift in the<br />
Commonwealth's arrangements for funding roads. over the<br />
past five years, the proportion of funds allocated for local<br />
road funding has risen from 18% to 24% this year.<br />
Income tax sharing with local government was introduced by the<br />
Federal Government five years ago when the level of assistance<br />
under the Labor government was about $ 80 million. Under the<br />
Commonwealth's revenue sharing arrangements this jumped to<br />
$ 140 million in 1976/ 77, and it has been moving up consistently<br />
ever since. With the current $ 300 million, local government<br />
will have received more than $ 1,000 million in untied grants<br />
in the five years of tax sharing.<br />
The Commonwealth Government has thus given local government<br />
a substantial and rapidly growing source of funds. It has<br />
done this because in such a vast country as Australia, local<br />
government is essential for the development of community<br />
identity. Local governments are often the driving force<br />
behind community spirit, enabling aresponse to be made to<br />
the community's needs which would not be possible from a<br />
remote bureaucracy in a capital city or in Canberra.<br />
The Commonwealth Government does not have a constitutional<br />
responsibility for local government, but it does have a<br />
strong philosophical commitment to giving Australians the<br />
maximum possible control over their own affairs. Decisions<br />
about water, sewerage, local roads and bridges are properly<br />
made by local government. The smaller the local government is, ./ 2<br />

the more say the people in that community have over these<br />
decisions, the results of which affect them on a day to day<br />
basis. The best solution to local problems is local action,<br />
based on local understanding.<br />
While the Commonwealth is moving ahead to take the decision<br />
making process as close as possible to the community, in<br />
New South Wales the Labor government is pursuing a policy<br />
which is exactly the opposite. In the past week, visiting<br />
several shires in New South Wales, I found increasing<br />
resentment of the programme of amalgamrations which is being<br />
forced on local and shire councils in that State.<br />
The arguments for merging local government into regional<br />
governments can be beguiling large authorities would be<br />
financially stronger and more efficient, according to<br />
these arguments. However, the arguments are false. The<br />
financial strength of local government is now assured<br />
because of the Commonwealth's personal income tax revenue<br />
sharing.<br />
The question of efficiency is one for the communities themselves<br />
to resolve. If councils want to combine in the interests of<br />
efficiency, then that is fine. But if the people of a community<br />
wish to retain their own shire, even if it is small and<br />
somewhat less efficient, then that also is their own right,<br />
and that is how it should remain.<br />
Forcing amalgamations on local councils against the wishes<br />
of the people of a community is a bad principle which<br />
defeats the purpose of local government. A previous<br />
Labor government in Canberra proposed a similar scheme<br />
for amalgamating local councils into a series of regions.<br />
The purpose was to undermine the State governments and<br />
reduce their authority.<br />
Both then and now these amalgamations, when they are not<br />
voluntary, are at the expense of the rights of citizens<br />
to make the decisions affecting their lives to the maximum<br />
extent possible. If a community wants its local government<br />
to remain small, then that is the community's right. </p>
