    <content><![CDATA[<p>I acknowledge and thank Senator Chris Back for his eight years of dedicated service representing the people of Western Australia.</p>
<p>Senator Back was an indefatigable advocate for the West, particularly ensuring the agricultural, agribusiness and resources sectors had a strong voice in the senate. I thank him for his tireless committee work and representation of rural and regional Australia.</p>
<p>Members and senators are volunteers to parliament while their families are conscripts. Senator Back’s decision to put his family first should be commended.</p>
<p>I wish Senator Back and his family the very best for the future.  </p>
