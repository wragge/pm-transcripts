PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA FRIDAY, 27 MAR~ CH 1981'<br />
' SPERCfl ON THE ' OCCASION OF TH2Z HANDING-OVER OF THW ITALIANk<br />
-EARTHQUAKE APPEAL CHEQUE,<br />
' Mr ChAirMan, Your Excellency, Your Grace,, Mr Premier t,<br />
Paxijamentary Colleagues, other distinguished guests,.. ladies<br />
gentlemen.<br />
~ Lstk er" a eathquake-in'Southern Italy was one ofth<br />
~' worst natural disasters to occur in the w ter wol this<br />
cetr. The extent of the tragedy was immense:* 3,000<br />
people lost their lives, many thousands were injured,<br />
~ qatrof a million people were renaie aT iblebs. The<br />
ipact 6f the devastation wasicompounded by the fact that it<br />
-v ame with the onset of the full severity of winter. The<br />
magnitude of the disaster, the loseof 1i a~-nd -the--hardship<br />
faced by the survivors touched people everywhere, and aid * came<br />
from many countries throughout the world.<br />
Australians always respond quickly and generously tocalfo<br />
-assistance, and there was never any doubt that we would, play<br />
our poart . in the international effort to assist Italy. " But<br />
~ ere was' a depth and quality of respunse from all sections9-<br />
of' the community which revealed a very important element of<br />
t. he* chsaater of our society.<br />
Australians of Italian origin responded magnificently and the,<br />
.,. rest ' of the comunity did more than just provide ' financial<br />
assistance to another of the world's disaster areas. There was<br />
a feeling that we had all been affected because a signfiet<br />
gopin our nation had suffered a great hurt.<br />
The -arthquake was a disaster-that-tovchernot only Auistraliams<br />
of Italian origin but all of us, of whatever background.. -The<br />
natin'srespontse was akin to the sharing that occurs<br />
wth44_ a-. famil1y, when one member of that family is goin<br />
through a tine of Borrow.<br />
I. believe that this response ' Shows yet again that Australia<br />
i~ s T~ gof age -as a multicultural society. Today# we<br />
: recognise the fact that Australians can retain a particular<br />
affection for the country from which they or their parents<br />
originally migrated and still, be Australians in the fullest and<br />
A beist sense of the word. And,' we are increasingly seengr that'<br />
it also provides a further foundation for the cohiesion and<br />
j unity of our country based4 on-shared feelings and concerns. </p>
<p>if 2.<br />
: This is tellingly illustrated by a small event F~~<br />
Victorian off ice of the earthquake appeal. An old l1ady,<br />
dressed in black, arrived carrying two collection tins,<br />
filled with donations.. The vo~ u~ eer-staff begaato speak*<br />
with her in Italian and soon discovered that the lady spoke<br />
no English and no Italian. She was Greek'.<br />
I have no Youbt. that the appeal organisers. have many other<br />
incidents demonstrating the way in which our society. worked<br />
together.-Collections were arranged at, spr rke, tetcrer<br />
anid schools; companies. and unions, large and small, contributed<br />
Aixertl-y to.. the appeal; executives and shop stewards<br />
Worked together-to assist collections at. the workplace;<br />
F. churches of all denominations took up collections among<br />
their congregations; and entertainers and performers: of.<br />
clibYe-bf Iamahl, John Farnham.. the Australian<br />
I Opera and the Melbourne Theatre Company donated their'.<br />
services free-of-charge to the appeal.<br />
Aside from monetary contributions, State and Territory,<br />
Governments provided manpower and premises to the various.<br />
state Appeal Committees. Here in Victoria, government<br />
premises were. immediately made available on a 24-hour basis<br />
following the earthqua1~ e.<br />

~ L. The Commonwealth Government made an initial donation of'<br />
half a million dollars. We agreed to match dollar-for-dollax<br />
the grants made by the State and Territory Governments and<br />
we made. donations to the appeal--tax-eductible--<br />
The Commonwealth has also facilitated the issuing of visas<br />
for intending migrants from-tha-eartbanake area... A senior<br />
officer from the Australian Institute of Multicultural.<br />
Affairs worked as the Secretary of the National Committee<br />
and staff from my own department, the Department of. Irmagratfion<br />
and. Ethnic Af fairs and from7E-eAu sraian E-ia-s y in Rome<br />
haemaintained an advisory role and provided assistance to<br />
the National Committee.<br />
It is no easy task to organise this wide range of activities<br />
and contributions and the splendid organisation and drive<br />
provided by the appeal commiittees At. ationaI. and state<br />
levels deserves the higliest recognition.<br />
In Victoria, the State Comittee was made up of over<br />
people, drawn from clubs.-.-cni-sUtTcm, inbarest -groups,<br />
chambers of comxnerce, political parties, the clergy, student<br />
groups, businesses. This Committee worked together, in<br />
xin Ison and . co-operation. Its members fanned out into the<br />
suburbs, the factories,. the clubs, the churches. -; Z<br />

<p>S The example of Victoria is paralleled in othe taer , where<br />
telethons were organised, telephone ring-ins and doorknock<br />
appeals took place and a host of othear-. actimiÃ±.Ã± ea<br />
were arranged to raise funds.<br />
6 V. 1RO All this reflects not only the human concern that naturall<br />
follows such a disaster. it also deosrtes tbit Eiire<br />
are no barriers when a coimunity, comprising differentgroups<br />
and a variety of interests, is united in purpose-..<br />
To achieve the magnificent result,. which. is evident in the.<br />
figures, has taken the effort and concern of hundreds of<br />
peOPleiiwhohave-ualuntaxily-devoted their time and effort<br />
to the appeal and the contributions of hundreds of thousandis<br />
-of Australians of many backgrounds.<br />
The total amount raised in Australia will be over $ 4 -millionr,<br />
with the figure in Victoria close to $ 1h million. This<br />
* money will be spent on the construction_ of kindergartens<br />
and homes for the elderly. , The use of funds for -projects<br />
of lasting and identifiable value was adopted very successaLlly<br />
following the earthquake in the F~ riuli region of 1976. 1<br />
-am confident that the national comittee will ensure that<br />
the money raised in Australia will be appropriately spent.<br />
Ladies and. gentlemen, let us hope that. the wounds inflicted<br />
tpnthe Italian nation by events beyond human control will<br />
-soon be -healod -and-let -us-recognise and build upon two<br />
legacies which the tragedy has left.<br />
-Thei first is a strengthened bond of friendship between the<br />
peoples of Italy and Australia. We have responded at a<br />
time of need and our assistance will provide practical<br />
projects whose daily use will serve as a reminder of the<br />
links between our two countries.<br />
e-socm--rofound, legacy is that we have demonstrated that<br />
we are a nation in which there is unity in+ diversity. -We<br />
have shown that when it counts we are able to work together<br />
i. Jn R port the-particular concerns of a -part of our<br />
community. This is a quality of which we can be justly<br />
proud, and it is a sign of national maturity. There can be:<br />
no doubt that it is a quality on which we can rely to tackle<br />
any fasw Iich iialia * May face in the years to come.<br />
It has been xny honour to serve as the patron of this most<br />
impertant--appeal;.--Thank you.<br />
