TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW WITH MARK DAY -19 SEPTEMBER 1985<br />
DAY: Mr Hawke, welcome.<br />
PM: Thank you very much, Mark.<br />
DAY:: The reverse to that question is can you sell them?<br />
PM: Yes, I believe we can, Mark, because the guiding principle<br />
of this tax reform package is fairness and equity. The ordinary<br />
Australia), the ordinary viewer, the honest taxpayer has been<br />
paying far too much tax because the tax rates have been pitched<br />
at too high a level. Very largely that has been because of the<br />
existence of avenues for avoidance which have been utilised by<br />
high income earners. That meant they hadn't been paying the tax<br />
that they should have been and so what we have done is<br />
substantially to reduce the rates of tax that will be paid by<br />
your ordinary Australians. And that's what they want.<br />
DAY: you talk about fairness. We all know that the greedy<br />
system have been able to either pay no tax or very<br />
little tax. Now by dropping the top rate from 60 to 50q, are<br />
those greedy going to say ' OK, I am willing to pay half'...<br />
PM: No, no, what you missed there with that question Marl-, frthat<br />
if that's all we did then the question would have som~ e<br />
validity. But at the same time we have closed off the rort areas.<br />
We have already done an enormous amount in finally putting to e<br />
the papcr scheme Now we have gone to the areas of avoidan~ ce s3<br />
that as you close those areas of avoidance, that means tP~ at te<br />
will. be brought into the tax system. And it is appropriatec<br />
fair to reduce the rates not simply for the sort of consitrat--' cr-.<br />
you have been talking about but for fairness. People ought to be<br />
able to feel as far as possible that when~ they earn that e:: tr~ a<br />
dollar, they are going to be able to keep a substantial o: c. 7<br />
it. Because if I could just put a couple of statistics to you<br />
Mark, which are very important to, I think, your viewers.<br />
In the early days, the beginning of the 70' s, the top rate wu<br />
cut in at a person who was on about ?'-1l0,000. But because c:-f2&amp;<br />
has happened, that top rate of 60 is cutting in at $ 35,0U0.<br />
that is just autotnate whole ste. It is tce-rrib1v<br />
for the ordinary middle A7ustr, 1ian out thnre.<br />
DAY: But you have lowered the rate, the tax scales stay h<br />
same, your top tax rate will still come in at 1 times .' rc<br />
weekly earnings. </p>
<p>PM: Yes, you see it is going to be a very very significant lowering<br />
of'the rate. I mean it is a very great difference to paying 6Q( in<br />
that marginal dollar and coming down to The other important<br />
consideration Mark, in bringing the top tax rate down to 49 is that<br />
the existence of that margin above the company tax rate meant that<br />
there was an enormous incentive which was exploited by people, not<br />
to pay tax because if they could incorporate themselves in one way<br />
or another, they pay the 49 and not the top tax rate. Now, having<br />
your top tax rate at the same as the company rate, that incentive<br />
for avoidance by incorporation is going to be taken away.<br />
DAY: Do you agree that if you get this wrong that it could cost<br />
you office?<br />
PM: Well, I just don't look at it in simple terms like that of just<br />
one thing. I have always......<br />
DAY: Before this whole debate got going you said you wanted broad<br />
community support.<br />
PM: That's right, I did. I believe very sincerely, and if I could<br />
conclude the answer I was going to give which would have got us there<br />
much quicker Mark, I am saying that I have a great faith in the<br />
Australian people. I don't think they decide just on one issue. They<br />
look at ithe things that government do as part of their whole approach<br />
to government. They have seen Mark, that since we have been in<br />
government we have turned this economy around from the worst recession<br />
in 50 years to one where now we are growing and doing better than any<br />
other economy in the world. Now I have told them and the Government<br />
has told them that we have also got to reform the tax system if we<br />
are going to look after the future economic development of Australia<br />
and have fairness and equity. So they are going to, when we come to<br />
the next election, say ' Alright, sure, what's this Government done<br />
about tax'. They are going to make a judgment on it. I believe on tax<br />
itself, they will vote in our favour, though I also believe that they<br />
will look at it on the basis of the economic record with which we will<br />
be going to the people. And it will be an outstandingly good record.<br />
DAY: You have to date enjoyed pretty broad support from the business<br />
community. Are you worried that it might cost you that support because<br />
you have added to the cost of business, not only with the rise in<br />
company tax, but also the imposition of the perks tax on business<br />
rather than<br />
PM: Well let me make a couple of points very quickly about that,<br />
Mark. When we came to office, company profits and the share of<br />
company profits had come down to disastrously low historical levels,<br />
about-. 12% of the national income. Now under our economic policies<br />
that has moved up to historically high levels. That has meant under<br />
our economic policies that the profits of companies have increased<br />
by several billion dollars. That percentage going up from 12% of the<br />
national income and going up to over 15% has meant an enormous increase<br />
in profits. Now we don't object to that. In fact, our whole policy<br />
approach has been to restore that profit level, to lift it up, because<br />
unless companies are profitLabie and Call inrvOe-t thiey don" t employ and<br />
that change has been very significant. Now, what will be taking<br />
from companies is very easily accommodatabie in this enormous increase<br />
in profitability. But I also believe that the business community will </p>
<p>3.<br />
look at this as a whole. It is true that they will have this burden<br />
in the fringe benefit area imposed upon them. But we have given them<br />
something that for 30 years conservative governments would not give<br />
them. They have been crying out with justification against the double<br />
taxation of dividends. Now, we have given them that. We have given them<br />
that at a cost of about $ 250 million. I think that the business<br />
community like yourordinary Australian taxpayer is going to look at this<br />
as a whole and the business community is going to say well there are<br />
a lot of benefits in this for us.<br />
DAY: And in spite of goodbye free lunches, Mr Hawke, goodbye we are<br />
out of time. Thanks very much for coming along.<br />
PM: Thank you very much indeed Mark. </p>
