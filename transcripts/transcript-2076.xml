" 1THIS WEEK"<br />
TELEVISION INTERVIEW GIVEN BY THE PRIME<br />
MINISTER, MR. JOHN GORTON, AT HSV-7,<br />
MELBOURNE<br />
( Recorded on 4 July for replay on 6 July 1969)<br />
Interviewers: Geoff Raymond<br />
John Boland<br />
Q. Well, Mr. Prime Minister, we will be dividing our<br />
questions into more or less two parts. I will be starting off with<br />
foreign affairs and then John will come in, particularly on domestic<br />
affairs. But first of all, I would like to make one broad-based question<br />
on Asia. How do you see our role in Asia today?<br />
PM. Asia is an awfully large geographical conception which<br />
embraces Pakistan, India and Vietnam and Thailand and the * Philippinesa<br />
terrifically wide variety of countries and I think that is rather too<br />
wide a question, but perhaps you mean our near North?<br />
Q. I was perhaps making it too broad. I will narrow it<br />
down. First of all, Malaysia<br />
PM. Yes, Malaysia/ Singapore, the area to our near north....<br />
Q. Malaysia / Singapore, definitely there in view of Britain's<br />
withdrawal and our increasing involvement in Singapore.... perhaps<br />
Malaysia's attitude towards us?<br />
PM. Well, I would answer that question as to how I saw our<br />
role there. And I see it this way. I see it in the need to show a r~ aT<br />
involvement in the area and a willingness to participate and help in all<br />
kinds of ways to give economic help, to give technical help, to assist<br />
with development, to try and open trade channels and also to be prepared<br />
to show that we are interested in helping to counter any military attack<br />
which may be launched on the area. Up until the present and perhaps<br />
still for a short time Britain has been responsible for the defence of<br />
Malaysia and Singapore and has accepted fully that responsibility herself<br />
as a major power and has looked to assistance from Malaysia, from<br />
Singapore, from ourselves, from New Zealand. Now, we can't accept<br />
responsibility for the defence of the area and look for assistance. Rather<br />
must the area defend itself and look to assistance from us and from New<br />
Zealand. There is a change in emphasis there. / 2 </p>
<p>-2<br />
Q. In specific terms, Sir, how would you see Malaysia.<br />
helping itself. You once made reference very recently to. Malayawas<br />
that deliberate?<br />
PM. Oh yes, that was quite deliberate. There were tw<br />
references that were made, one was that our troops were stationed<br />
in Malaya and in Singapore. In fact the reason for saying that was<br />
our troops are stationed in Malaya and Singapore.<br />
Q. . In the peninsula of Malaya as distinct from Malaysia,<br />
the divided nation geographically?<br />
PM. Yes, that's right. One could get into kind of semantic<br />
problems over-this but I am sure that if anybody said which we<br />
didn't and won't our troops are stationed in Sabah, nobody would<br />
have been under any misapprehension as to the geographical area they<br />
were in. But they aren't. They are in Malaya. Or, if you prefer to<br />
put it in another way they are in the Malayan Peninsula, which is<br />
made up of nine states, which is called West Malaysia, but which in<br />
fact is a geographical area which everybody knows to be a geographical<br />
area.<br />
Q. Do you think the Asian leaders, Prime Minister, were<br />
upset by that division that you made?<br />
PM. I think that perhaps the Malaysians themselves sawa<br />
distinction between the use of the word " Malaya" or the use of the<br />
words " the peninsula of Malaya" which I made in the February statement<br />
in Parliament, and took the view that Malaysia is a country and an<br />
entity and why should one use " Malaya" or the " peninsula of Malaya"<br />
or the " nine states which make up the peninsula of Malaya". But I<br />
was talking about the nine states which make up the peninsula of Malaya.<br />
Q. You don't think it fractured our relationships in any<br />
way with....<br />
PM. I don't thinkc it has fractured our relationships in any<br />
way. I think it has made our position clearer, or as clear as it should<br />
be.<br />
Q. The possibility of continuing racial riots and conflict in<br />
Malaya once again, mcst of it has been confined to the Malayan<br />
Peninsula do they complicate our relations there?<br />
PM. I don't think they complicate our relations but I think<br />
they must be a worry to all concerned. I don't see them at this stage<br />
being a threat to the Peninsula of Malaya or to the Malaysian Government.<br />
but the fact that they can take place, after a period of time when there<br />
appeared to be multi-racialism accepted on all sides, does I think<br />
o. / 3 </p>
<p>-3<br />
PM. raise a question mark in one's mind. Because if this<br />
( contd.) country of Malaysia is to be for the future viable, strong, growing,<br />
happy, getting more prosperous, getting more capacity to defend itself,<br />
then I think all the people in that area need to be working together for<br />
a common purpose. And if racial or communal not communist but<br />
communal strife comes into that, then this must cause disturbances<br />
one mould much prefer not to have.<br />
Q. Well, with our continuing involvement in the area, can<br />
we remain divorced or are we intended to remain divorced from this<br />
internal conflict?<br />
PM. We are going to remain divorced from it period.<br />
Q. And this refers, of course, to Singapore -as well?<br />
PM. Yes, but....<br />
Q. In the event of conflict between Malaysia and Singapore<br />
which is not a real possibility at this moment?<br />
PM. I wouldn't regard that as being something which arises<br />
at all.<br />
Q. Are you satisfied with our relationship with Indonesia<br />
and the particular situation there? Do you think they are well disposed<br />
towards us now?<br />
PM. I am quite sure that they are well disposed towards us<br />
and I believe that the present government is really trying to successfully<br />
accomplish the first task before them and which they see as the first<br />
task before them. And that is to increase their economic growth,<br />
increase their efficiency in production and try to see that the results<br />
of that economic growth and that efficiency are enjoyed by the peasants<br />
and the people and the workmen, the people down the line. I am sure<br />
they are trying to do that. I am sure they are well disposed towards us.<br />
Q. Can we afford to do more for these countries in aid, do<br />
you feel? I think you referred during the week to them helping themselves.<br />
Now isn't this the best way for them to help themselves to get as much<br />
aid as they can? Do you think we are giving them enough?<br />
PM. I think without doubt that the answer in the long term to<br />
any problems that might arise there is the economic answer. The<br />
answer is providing prosperity for the peoples that are living there and<br />
work opportunities and so forth, and that aid provides this. Having said<br />
that, I think that it is necessary that there should be, in the confused<br />
conditions of the world, that there should be a military shield to allow<br />
/ 4 </p>
<p>-4<br />
PM. this development to take place behind it, and we are providing aid. It<br />
( contd.) must always be a point of argument as to whether we are providing<br />
enough or could provide a little more. I think our aid to that area has<br />
gone up by 50 per cent in the last five years and certainly it has been<br />
doubled our aid to Indonesia itself has been doubled. It is still not an<br />
enormous amount but it is moving up.<br />
Q. Can we afford more?<br />
PM. Well, it depends on your judgments of priorities as<br />
between what we. as to how our resources should be apportioned<br />
because there are many calls on them. There is this call for aid.<br />
There is the great drain fbr New Guinea's development, for example,<br />
which is taking $ 100 million a year from Australian taxpayers. There<br />
is our requirement for roads and schools and hospitals and defence<br />
and all the other matters. So it is a matter of apportionment.<br />
Q. How long can self-government for New Guinea remain<br />
delayed? And also, perhaps we can go on to what are the views of the<br />
Government on New Qiinea as an eighth State of hustralia, or complete<br />
self-government without the Commonwealth of Australia?<br />
PM. Which was the seventh State?<br />
Q. Sorry' We'l11 leave the Northern Territory out of it.<br />
PM. All right. No, I don't see New Guinea and Papua becoming<br />
an eighth State of Australia and I think in the Governor-General's speech<br />
at the Opening of the first Parliament in which I was Prime Minister, this<br />
was made perfectly clear and spelt out that we do not see this as one of<br />
the possibilities. We see Papua/ New Guinea as an independent self<br />
governing state in its own right, and we are seeking to develop it towards<br />
that end. At the moment, they are greatly dependent on us economically.<br />
For every three dollars of public money spent in New Guinea, Australian<br />
taxpayers provide two. But you also asked me how long before they<br />
become self-governing and independent. We have made it clear that<br />
they can become self-governing and independent as soon as a method is<br />
devised of finding out -Lh at they do want to become self -governing and<br />
independent; and when they do that they can.<br />
Q. What do you think is holding this back?<br />
PM. Well, I think that it is partly that a very great number<br />
of peoples in Papua and New Guinea, particularly in the inland areas<br />
and in the highland areas, do not at this stage want to be completely<br />
self-governing and independent, but steps, of course, have been taken.<br />
There has been the House of Assembly up there, which is elected. </p>
<p>PM. There are seven Ministers who are not Ministers in our own sense<br />
( contd.) it's no use pretending they are but who are associated with the various<br />
arms of government and getting experience in government and in public<br />
service procedures and how to run a country. Arid when there is a real<br />
demand throughout the whole of the area for self-government, then as<br />
far as we are concerned, we would be quite happy for them to have it.<br />
Q. Getting closer to Australia now, Mr. Prime Minister,<br />
what is the. how do you see Australia's defence looming uip? From<br />
this week it would look very clearly that we seem to be getting closer to<br />
this original concept which I think you were interested in twelve months<br />
ago in Fortress Australia-type defence. Now, how can we help<br />
ourselves in this field and do you think we are ultimately getting back<br />
to that concept?<br />
PM. I have never used I have never ever publicly used<br />
the term " Fortress Australia". I just wanted to make that clear. But<br />
I think it would be true to say that we would need to think of how the<br />
mainland of Australia itself would be defended, what forces were needed<br />
to defend it, what allies were needed to make that defence without<br />
question successful. But we also need, as I said in the beginning, to<br />
show a preparedness and a readiness to try and help, particularly in<br />
Malaysia and Singapore, against external attack should that come. So<br />
our defence thinking would be that we should demonstrate our willingness<br />
to help not to take over the defence but to help and assist in the<br />
defence of these areas. We think this is best shown by stationing forces<br />
in the area ( rather than by some alternate scheme of popping them in<br />
and out on a sort of now -you -s ee-them-now-you -don't jack-in-the-box<br />
approach which is logistically absurd and psychologically stupid), and<br />
at the same time build up our own defence forces in Australia.<br />
Q. How much do you think we can still rely on our allies?<br />
PM. I believe that we can rely on the ANZLJS Treaty completely<br />
for the defence of the Australian mainland, or for New Zealand for that<br />
matter but I am speaking of Australia now and I have no doubt that<br />
Great Britain too, should we be subject to attack ( I don't see this looming)<br />
but should we be subject to attea, that Great Britain would also without<br />
question have forces out here to help us.<br />
Q. In time do you think? It's a long way away.<br />
PM. Oh, I think so. If we haven't of our own resources<br />
suff icient def ence capacity to defend an island. invading armies<br />
have to cross a sea to get here, they have to land at particular points<br />
such as Sydney or Melbourne. It's not much good them landing on some<br />
mangrove-covered coast in the Gulf of Carpentaria or somewhere that<br />
achieves nothing. If we haven't got the capacity to do that and I think<br />
/ 6 </p>
<p>6-<br />
PM. we have and will have then we are not providing sufficient defences<br />
( contd.) for ourselves. But I believe we are. As far as the United States forces<br />
under ANZUS are concerned, their fleets are close and their naval<br />
capacity to help us would take very little time to get h-' re indeed, and<br />
their air capacity to help us would also be almost immediately available.<br />
Q. This is still getting pretty close to the Fortress Australiatype<br />
concept, isn't it?<br />
PM. No, it's not. I don't think it is because the Fortress<br />
Australia-type concept as it has been interpreted by people is Don't<br />
do anything at all outside Australia. You are asking me and I have<br />
been talking to you about what one does in the event of an attack on<br />
Australia itself and I am not saying indeed I have said the reverse<br />
I am not saying that we should do nothing outside Australia, that we<br />
should not station our Air Force units at Butterworth, which Is in<br />
Malaya, or that we should not station our troops in Singapore or that<br />
we should not engage in exercises with the British and the Malaysian<br />
and the Singaporean troops.<br />
Q. Would we still have the capacity to buy the time we would<br />
need, Sir, without the F-Ill<br />
PM. Well, I think so. The F-i11 was conceived as a<br />
comparatively long-range strike bomber. I don't think that is really<br />
relevant to<br />
Q. It hasn't changed the defence thinking at all, the fact that<br />
it looks as though there is going to be a great delay if ever F -ill1s will<br />
be helping us?<br />
PM. No, I think of course, it's nice if you have bombers<br />
in being but insofar as defence is concerned, I don't believe this would<br />
affect the time that would be required, and this was what you asked<br />
me for us to be able to defend ourselves should we be attacked.<br />
Q. Will we ever have these F -ll11s?<br />
PM. We will have them if they meet our specifications and<br />
last as long as we expected them to last when we bought them and will<br />
meet the tests that we expected them to meet when we bought them.<br />
Q. On this very question, you mentioned tests. You have,<br />
particularly, quite a personal part in seeing that this 16, 000 hours<br />
test takes place with the F-ill. Now, in view of the fact that up to<br />
date 8, 000 hours have been achieved and it has shown very big flaws,<br />
can we take the attitude that at 16, 000 hours the aircraft is not going<br />
to completely break up, but is it necessary to persist, to go ahead<br />
with the 16, 000 hours test when half -way through it has shown flaws? / 7 </p>
<p>-7<br />
PM. Well, we think it is necessary for it to be tested to<br />
16, 000 hours before we would be prepared to take it.<br />
Q. Are you happy with the test to date?<br />
PM. Well, it hasn't reached 16, 000 hours or anywhere near it.<br />
Q. It hasn't reached 8, 000 hours without failing so far, so<br />
how could it possibly reach..<br />
PM. Well, I suppose it would be possible to imagine it<br />
reaching 16, 000 hours if they discovered the cause Of the break-ups<br />
earlier and remedied them or if they had some other wing carry-through<br />
box or if they down-graded the actual performance of the plane in the<br />
air. There are a great number of permutations and combinations on<br />
this. But the original understanding when we entered into the arrangements<br />
for buying these planes many years ago was they would be tested to<br />
16, 000 hours. Now, on my last visit to Washington, it was confirmed<br />
that it was reasonable and right for us to expect them to be tested to<br />
that level before we took delivery.<br />
Q. Have you looked at an alternative aircraft if this F Ill<br />
is not successful?<br />
PM. I know that the Air Force as a matter of ordinary<br />
prudence and natural routine have for quite some time been assessing<br />
a variety of aircraft for a variety of purposes.<br />
Q. Have you got any idea at this stage what type of aircraft<br />
they are looking at?<br />
PM. Oh, they are looking at a lot of different types.<br />
Q. American?<br />
PM. Yes.<br />
Q. Would you say that the cost already I think we have<br />
spent $ 50 million on this project<br />
PM. Which project the F-Ill1?<br />
Q. Yes.<br />
PM. Oh, rather more than that! / 8 </p>
<p>Q. Well,_ -was conservative. Whatever we have spent in<br />
excess nf is there any way in your talks with the American<br />
Defence chiefs and the American Government that we can recoup some<br />
of that on say, another aircraft, or can that be used to..<br />
PM. What we would need to do before talking about that at all<br />
would be to get much more detailed technical assessments from our own<br />
people who are over there as to the course of the tests and what happened<br />
at the tests. We would want much more technical advice from the<br />
engineering side of our air force as to the way the plane would operate,<br />
and what we could expect before we reached a situation where we<br />
would be in a position to start talking about what might happen if we<br />
didn't take the aeroplane.<br />
Q. Do you think they are amenable to the suggestion that this<br />
million or in excess of that can be used?<br />
PM. I don't think I can add anything to what I have just said in<br />
answer to your last question.<br />
Q. Before we leave the subject of defence, Sir, we would<br />
have to at this stage bring Vietnam in. The possibility of 200, 000<br />
American troops being home in time for Christmas. Is it envisaged that<br />
Australia will scale down or phase out her commitments in the Phuoc<br />
Tuy province or in Vietnam generally on par with the American effort?<br />
PM. I think that the suggestion of phasing down the Australian<br />
contribution of infantrymen and artillerymen and people driving tanks<br />
which is somewhere around 8, 000 not quite 8, 000 men I think the<br />
suggestion of phasing that down is scarcely tenable. The force was built<br />
up to three battalions with its artillery and with its tanks because that<br />
was a viable force. You could have two battalions in the field and one<br />
resting and that gave you much much more capacity than if you only had<br />
two battalions there because you could only have one in the field and one<br />
resting. Although it may mathematically sound as if it is only twice as<br />
good, in fact it is better than twice as good. So you would be very<br />
very much cutting down the military capacity of the force there and of<br />
course, I would think you would be increasing the danger to the ones that<br />
remained there if you didn't have a self-contained viable force. So the<br />
question would rather be, if it arose, whether we should have troops<br />
ground troops there or whether we should not. You are asking me<br />
hypothetical questions of if the Americans do this or get down that<br />
far, would we<br />
Q. Would we scale down comparably, that was really the<br />
question. / 9 </p>
<p>9-<br />
PM., I think not scale down. I think a time would have to<br />
tom~ e-1 doWforesee it but it would have to come when if there was<br />
a great and . continuing American withdrawal, we would have to decide<br />
whether we left troops there or not. But that hasn't arrived and I don't<br />
know where the idea of withdrawal of 200, 03 American troops by<br />
Christmas came about<br />
Q. It has been mentioned, Sir, in some quarters. If the<br />
Australians were to be withdrawn, it seemed to me I was over there<br />
fairly recently it might be somewhat of a vacuum left, more so than<br />
the Americans because there are no South Vietnamese units working<br />
with the Australians at all. In fact at Nui Dat and environs there,<br />
South Viet namese the ARVN the Army of the Republic of Vietnam<br />
was completely absent. This would pose a difficulty, surely, in us<br />
withdrawing from that area. We are not involved with the South<br />
Vietnamese.<br />
PM. Yes, but that wouldn't prevent the South Vietnamese<br />
units relieving, presumably. I know they are not there. They are not<br />
working now, but if the theory is and it is a theory that the South<br />
Vietnamese will take over where a battalion of American Marines were,<br />
and if it is withdrawn, then a South Vietnamese battalion will take that<br />
over, then again it would be possible for this to happen in Phuoc Tuy.<br />
But we are talking about something which is entirely hypothetical at<br />
the moment.<br />
Q. It is possible, though, that there could be a lessening-down<br />
of our commitment there. If the American commitment is as big as<br />
200, 000, is it possible to see some Australian troops coming home by<br />
Christmas time?<br />
PM. I don't see that happening for the reasons which I gave in<br />
the House and I think on a television interview somewhere else. All I<br />
would say would be that clearly if there ever was a stage reached where<br />
there was an-American withdrawal which was going to go on and on and<br />
on, then at some stage it would be necessary for us to see whether we<br />
could stay there. But that hasn't arisen and I don't see it arising in<br />
the time you are talking of.<br />
Q. Sir, of the British Commonwealth troops in Vietnam<br />
we have only got the Australians and New Zealanders, the rest have<br />
not come to the party, if one could use the expression there are<br />
racial tensions through the Commonwealth, a great divisive element<br />
it seems to me is the Commonwealth a tenable and viabl e proposition? </p>
<p>10<br />
PM. Yes, I think it's a tenable proposition I'm just trying<br />
to work out what you have in your mmnd when you ask me if it is a viable<br />
proposition.<br />
Q. As a power in wo-rld politics.....<br />
PM. It's not a power in world politics now. I don't think you<br />
could regard the Commonwealth as a power in world politics. I'm<br />
sure nobody would take the attitude for instance, that Stalin took about<br />
the Pope " How many divisions has a Pope got?" -I'm sure nobody<br />
says " How many divisions has a Commonwealth got?". I viouldn't<br />
regard it as a military power in world politics nor, really, as a<br />
cohesive power in influencing matters which might be discussed in the<br />
United Nations or somewhere, because people from the Commonwealth<br />
take different attitudes and different points of view. It is not cohesive<br />
in that way. I think it has advantages but they are not advantages which<br />
could be described as making it a power in any sense.<br />
Q. Are there any advantages to Australia's continuing to<br />
belong to it?<br />
PM. I think there are advantages which are difficult to<br />
describe in a finite way. I think there are advantages for opportunities<br />
to have some kind of a link say, with India or with Malaysia or with<br />
other countries which are within the Commonwealth, but it is not<br />
something you can spell out. It is not something you can put your<br />
finger on. I think there are advantages. I think it is useful, for<br />
example I think it was useful at the laF-Prime Minister's Conference<br />
in London for so many Prime Ministers from so many different countries<br />
and so many different races to be able to sit downi around a table and<br />
discuss matters and pull no punches, be polite to each other but have<br />
different points of view quite clearly put in an atmosphere which is<br />
sui generis. I think it has got that kind of advantage. I couldn't ever<br />
say '" This is the value of it'' or '' That is the value of I think there<br />
is something there.<br />
Q. This raise,, a very interesting point, Prime Minister.<br />
What is its future? What is the future for the Commonwealth? How<br />
do you see that?<br />
PM. I think I would like to wait and see what the future brings.<br />
Q. To get back to Australia again you have often been<br />
it has often been suggested that you sort of indicate a Pres idential-type<br />
Prime Ministership. Do you think that Australia will ever become a<br />
republic and do you think that the Prime Ministership is ever likely<br />
to become more of a Presidential operation? / 11 </p>
<p>11<br />
PM. A Prime Ministership can't become a Presidential<br />
operation. The only way that we could have a President would be If<br />
we departcd completely from the British type of Parliamentary<br />
government which we have, because a President is elected for a fixed<br />
term of years. It doesn't matter whether he is defeated in the Parliament<br />
or not. He still stays there and Congress I'm taking the<br />
United States as an example Congress can pass a law or not pass a<br />
law; it makes no difference, the President still remains there. And,<br />
of course, the great difference between that and the British system of<br />
Parliamentary government is that if a Prime Minister and his<br />
Government are defeated by the House of Representatives or the Senate<br />
or the House of Representatives particularly, then it is necessary for<br />
him to resign and have another election. So the two things are quite<br />
distinct and you couldn't have a Presidential system if you kept to the<br />
present British Parliamentary system.<br />
Q. What about going part of the way, Sir the Australian<br />
flag, the Australian Naticnal Anthem Australian as such,<br />
PM. I like the Australian flag the way it is. I sec no problem<br />
in having the Union Jack in the corner. After all, it is not the British<br />
flag. It is the Australian flag. That there happens to be in the corner<br />
of it a Union Jack is perhaps a reminder of the continuing history of<br />
large numbers of our people and perhaps a reminder of history in<br />
which Australians have taken part in war and in peace. So I think we<br />
have got an Australian flag and I don't really understand those who want<br />
to take away a part of it. I don't see that it makes any difference, that<br />
it would be any more an Australian flag. While we are a constitutional<br />
monarchy, our National Anthem must be God Save The Queen, but I<br />
would like, as you know, to see a distinctive Australian song. I know<br />
some people would like it to bQ " Advance Australia Fair", I wouldn't<br />
particularly. I am not really enamoured of this bom-bah-bom thing....<br />
Q. Are you still a " Waltzing Matilda" man?<br />
PM. Yes, I'm afraid I am! I like the tune.<br />
Q. What about Mick Jagger as Ned Kelly<br />
PM. I knew you were going to ask that! I don't know Mr.<br />
Jagger or very much about him, but fr-om the pictures of him that I<br />
have seen all I can say is that he doesn't quite match up with the<br />
mental picture I had of Ned K( elly.<br />
Q. Would you like to subsidise a film made here in reply,<br />
Sir, perhaps with Chips Rafferty as Robin Hood, do you think?<br />
PM. Who would you have as Maid Marian? / 12 </p>
<p>12<br />
Q. Prime Minister, on the question of your leadership,<br />
there have been many criticisms, and some quite severe. Have any<br />
of these really hurt you? H-ow do you feel personally about these?<br />
PM. I don't tink any of them have hurt me personally.<br />
But some of them I thought were rather odd, particularly the sort of<br />
nonsenses about being a dictator and telling the Cabinet what to do and<br />
making them do things, not putting things before them, not having<br />
Cabinet decisions. These criticisms are so way out and so stupid.<br />
The approach seems to be that if something that a critic doesn't like<br />
happens, then this is me overriding the Cabinet. If something they<br />
do like happens, then this is the Cabinet against my bitter opposition.<br />
You can't really have it both ways. As an example, there is a lot of<br />
nonsense about having dragooned the Cabinet and not told them anything<br />
about going into overseas shipping. Well, we had about five Cabinet<br />
meetings on that and sent Jack McEwen abroad with instructions from<br />
the Cabinet on the sort of agreement he should try to make.<br />
Q. What about Mr. St. John's attacks were you upset<br />
about those?<br />
PM. Well mainly upset about the sort of ridiculous attacks<br />
along these lines. Hie began to be worried when I said I never intended<br />
to have an election. I think this was one of the things, which was<br />
something that has never appeared in the transcript of anything I ha,, ve<br />
said. But you don't really mind if somebody twists facts and twists the<br />
truth in that way. As I say, none of them hurt me personally but some<br />
of them seemed to be a little odd.<br />
Q. Sir, on a personal note, do you enjoy being Prime<br />
Minister?<br />
PM. Yes, from time to time.<br />
Q. What do you find the most arduous part of it?<br />
PM. I think when the House is sitting is the most arduous time<br />
because you have your ordinary work going on, you also have to be in to<br />
answer Questions and be prepared to answer Questions, you have to<br />
make speeches in the House, and a great number of Members of<br />
Parliament want to come in to see you and talk to you about their own<br />
problems, which they should. But it all adds up to a lot of time in a<br />
working day.<br />
Q. just one final question. We should ask you this one.<br />
Commonwealth/ State relations. Do you see them improving? / 13 </p>
<p>13-<br />
PM. Well, I see them-improving in the sense that the States<br />
are getting larger amounts of money each year under the formula<br />
process and the Loan Council borrowings are also going up. But there<br />
is, and I think always will be a natural area of argument between a<br />
State government and a Commonwealth government no matter what<br />
party happens to be State or Commonwealth. There will always be<br />
areas of argument because a State can always say, " Well, we can't do<br />
this because the Commonwealth won't give us enough money", and<br />
this can be applied to anything. And a Commonwealth has always got to<br />
take account of the general call on resources in the community and<br />
whether giving more money would give more things or just lead to<br />
inflation. This is potting the thing very much; a potted answer but<br />
that is all there is time for.<br />
Q. Well, thank you very much indeed, Mr. Prime Minister.<br />
We would like to have you for a lot more but I believe t ime is just<br />
about taken up now. Perhaps you will return to us sometime?<br />
PM. Yes, thank you. </p>
