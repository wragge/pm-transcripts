<p>E&amp;OE.............</p>
<p>  SATTLER:</p>
<p>  Good morning, Prime Minister.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Good morning, Howard.</p>
<p>  SATTLER:</p>
<p>  Thanks for joining us on the programme.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  It's a great pleasure to be with you as always.</p>
<p>  SATTLER:</p>
<p>  You must be salivating at the prospect tomorrow of a no vote.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  I don't know that the result can be taken for granted either way. I'm not</p>
<p>   salivating. I take the view that whatever decision is made by the Australian</p>
<p>   people it will be the right decision.</p>
<p>  SATTLER:</p>
<p>  How will you feel if your side wins?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  I advocate a no vote because I don't believe Australia will be better off</p>
<p>   under the model put forward. That's why I'm voting no.</p>
<p>  SATTLER:</p>
<p>  Or any republican model put forward.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well, I think there are enormous benefits in the present system but the</p>
<p>   only republican model on offer is the one that we're voting on tomorrow</p>
<p>   so that is an academic question. I certainly don't favour a directly elected</p>
<p>   presidency if that is what you have in mind.</p>
<p>  SATTLER:</p>
<p>  That's what Peter Reith and others have in mind.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Yes, I know that, well I don't. I mean, my argument is a very simple one</p>
<p>   and it's a very respectable one and it's a very pro-Australian one and that</p>
<p>   is that we now have a very safe, stable, workable system and I am unconvinced</p>
<p>   that the model on offer will make it better and, in some respects, in a</p>
<p>   difficult time it will make it worse and less predictable and less secure.</p>
<p>   That's why I'm voting no.</p>
<p>  SATTLER:</p>
<p>  Okay, so you don't like tomorrow's model and you don't like the direct election</p>
<p>   model so really you just like the monarchist model, don't you, I mean, let's</p>
<p>   be honest about it?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  I think the present arrangement, and I respect your view to the contrary</p>
<p>   and the views of my other fellow Australians who have a different view,</p>
<p>   I think the system of government we have developed in this country over</p>
<p>   a long period of time delivers better than any alternative I know at the</p>
<p>   moment the sort of stability and security that I think all of us want.</p>
<p>  SATTLER:</p>
<p>  But does that mean that you've outsmarted the pro-republicans or they've</p>
<p>   outsmarted themselves? Because I think you would concede that most Australians,</p>
<p>   if it was a straight question - do you want Australia to be a republic or</p>
<p>   do you want us to retain the links with the monarchy without going into</p>
<p>   the model question - most Australians would opt for a republic.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  But, Howard, well, I'm not trying to be smart about this. If I had have</p>
<p>   been smart about this as you put it I would have said one thing and done</p>
<p>   another. But I have been utterly transparent and consistent. I've always</p>
<p>   expressed my support for the current system. I've always said that, nonetheless,</p>
<p>   I would have a convention and I would allow the clear view that came out</p>
<p>   of that convention to be put to the Australian people.</p>
<p>  SATTLER:</p>
<p>  Yeah, I know that, but the polls are showing only nine percent of people</p>
<p>   do support us retaining our links with the monarchy but they just don't</p>
<p>   like the model tomorrow most of the people are going to vote.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well, 45 percent of people in that same poll said that they were voting</p>
<p>   no because they like the current system. I mean, there's a whole combination</p>
<p>   of reasons why people vote in different ways but you can't change a constitution</p>
<p>   in abstract. You can't say, well, we'd like to sort of go down that path</p>
<p>   without knowing exactly what's involved. What people are being asked to</p>
<p>   do tomorrow is to vote in a republican proposal which will allow in a way</p>
<p>   unknown in any republican constitution in the world a Prime Minister to</p>
<p>   dismiss, without notice, without justification and without appeal, the Head</p>
<p>   of State.</p>
<p>  SATTLER:</p>
<p>  Would you have more or less power to sack the Head of State if the model</p>
<p>   was accepted tomorrow compared with the powers you have now?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  I believe in effect there'd be fewer constraints on me if the model is accepted</p>
<p>   tomorrow.</p>
<p>  SATTLER:</p>
<p>  But you can sack the Governor-General now, can't you?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well, it's never happened in 100 years.</p>
<p>  SATTLER:</p>
<p>  So who's to say that you or any other Prime Minister would want to sack</p>
<p>   the President?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well, I think the experience of the last 100 years has got to be instructive</p>
<p>   in getting a proper answer to that question.</p>
<p>  SATTLER:</p>
<p>  Yeah, but I'm just talking about, you know, in a hypothetical situation,</p>
<p>   the powers that you have. Now, under the model proposed I would suggest</p>
<p>   that you'd less powers than you've got now to sack the Head of State.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well, I don't agree with that. To start with, you can do it in writing without</p>
<p>   notice. The requirement of a 30-day approval by the House of Representatives</p>
<p>   doesn't amount to a lot because the majority party in the House of Representatives</p>
<p>   is not going to repudiate their Prime Minister. And even Gough Whitlam who's</p>
<p>   an ardent republican acknowledged in the wake of 1975 that the idea that</p>
<p>   he could have instantaneously dismissed the Governor-General without some</p>
<p>   delay which itself affects the dynamic of any dispute between the Prime</p>
<p>   Minister and the Governor-General was the reality.</p>
<p>  SATTLER:</p>
<p>  Direct electionists like Peter Reith think if the no vote wins on the weekend,</p>
<p>   on Monday they can pretty well instantly start another campaign for direct</p>
<p>   election. Are they wasting their time while you are the Prime Minister and</p>
<p>   your Government's in office?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well, our position on this is that if the referendum is carried on Saturday</p>
<p>   then we'll naturally get about implementing the decision of the Australian</p>
<p>   people. There won't, in those circumstances, be any possibility in my view</p>
<p>   of another referendum for a direct election. So, the yes and more argument</p>
<p>   which is being put by Mr Beazley is flawed, it won't happen, because if</p>
<p>   the republic gets up there'll be sufficient members of Parliament on both</p>
<p>   sides of the House to combine to oppose ever putting a referendum on a direct</p>
<p>   election. On the other hand, if a no vote gets up my view is that the issue</p>
<p>   will not come back in a hurry. I can't say that it will never come back.</p>
<p>  SATTLER:</p>
<p>  Peter Costello in the studio said he thought - I mean, history showed, he</p>
<p>   said, that we only had one every eleven years and it would be at least as</p>
<p>   long as that before another one.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  I don't presume to try and deal in years and I don't think anybody can,</p>
<p>   with respect. And Peter and I, of course, under the free vote arrangement</p>
<p>   we have within the Liberal Party on this issue are speaking from opposite</p>
<p>   points of view.</p>
<p>  SATTLER:</p>
<p>  Sure, and isn't that a good thing that we can all speak about this sort</p>
<p>   of thing.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Exactly. I mean, I think the Liberal Party has displayed immense maturity</p>
<p>   and sophistication in allowing this. The Labor Party won't. If the polls</p>
<p>   are to be believed a significant chunk of the Labor support base is going</p>
<p>   to vote no tomorrow. Now, where is that expressed in the views of the members</p>
<p>   of the Parliamentary Labor Party? But that is a matter for Mr Beazley. Getting</p>
<p>   back to the point at issue, particularly to people who are listening to</p>
<p>   this programme who are undecided, this is a totally independent country.</p>
<p>   It is a country with an utterly distinct, clear, national identity and clear</p>
<p>   national character. We are not arguing about Australia's independence. We</p>
<p>   are arguing about what is the best arrangement to handle political crisis</p>
<p>   and constitutional difficulty. And we've shown over the last 100 years we</p>
<p>   have a system that does that very effectively.</p>
<p>  SATTLER:</p>
<p>  If we're totally independent why are we hosting the Sovereign next year?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well, there's absolutely no reason why, even republicans say, there's no</p>
<p>   reason why she shouldn't come to this country.</p>
<p>  SATTLER:</p>
<p>  But it's because she's our Sovereign, isn't it?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Of course she is, she is the Queen of Australia, but that doesn't affect</p>
<p>   our legal and political independence. Let me throw that back at you - if</p>
<p>   we weren't completely independent we wouldn't be having a referendum tomorrow.</p>
<p>   I mean, the reason we are having the referendum tomorrow and the reason</p>
<p>   why it is open to the Australian people to alter the Constitution is that</p>
<p>   we are a sovereign, independent people. I mean, this argument about independence</p>
<p>   is the weakest argument of all.</p>
<p>  SATTLER:</p>
<p>  But do we have to formally advise her we are holding this referendum?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  No.</p>
<p>  SATTLER:</p>
<p>  How did she find out?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well, there's no legal requirement that she be formally advised.</p>
<p>  SATTLER:</p>
<p>  But did you formally advise her?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well, I haven't.</p>
<p>  SATTLER:</p>
<p>  Did the Governor-General?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  I mean, I've not had any direct discussion with her of any kind about the</p>
<p>   referendum. I mean, of course she's aware it's on, naturally she is, but</p>
<p>   that's not the point. The point is that the decision is being taken tomorrow</p>
<p>   by the Australian people to decide our future. Now, if we weren't fully</p>
<p>   independent we wouldn't be, quote, allowed to take that decision. I mean,</p>
<p>   this argument about independence is the weakest of all. Naturally the Queen</p>
<p>   - the whole world knows about the process - naturally there.</p>
<p>  SATTLER:</p>
<p>  So there's just one more small step.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  She's aware - well, you see your argument falls down on the proposition.</p>
<p>   I mean, if we were independent, if we weren't completely independent there</p>
<p>   wouldn't be - I mean, I just don't know how people can sustain this independence</p>
<p>   argument. We are voting tomorrow as 12 million Australians at voting age</p>
<p>   to decide the future of our constitution. Whatever decision we make goes.</p>
<p>  SATTLER:</p>
<p>  And to retain the links with the British Royal family or otherwise.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well, we are taking a decision and we can decide what we do with it. Surely</p>
<p>   that is the ultimate hallmark of an utterly independent country, a capacity</p>
<p>   to fashion and design our future.</p>
<p>  SATTLER:</p>
<p>  I also heard you say this morning in another medium that Australia will</p>
<p>   remain a decent country if we remain a monarchy. Are you saying we won't</p>
<p>   if we are a republic?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  No, I did not say - I mean, what I said, Australia will remain a good and</p>
<p>   decent country no matter what the outcome. I've said that.</p>
<p>  SATTLER:</p>
<p>  I heard you say if we remain a monarchy.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well, Howard.</p>
<p>  SATTLER:</p>
<p>  So whatever, even if we're a republic.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Let me make it clear, let me make this clear. We are a good and decent country</p>
<p>   now. We will be a good and decent country on Sunday and all of next week</p>
<p>   and all the weeks.</p>
<p>  SATTLER:</p>
<p>  Whatever the result.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Of course but, don't chop me off, we will have a more stable and safe constitution</p>
<p>   at a time of political difficulty and constitutional crisis if we stay with</p>
<p>   the present system.</p>
<p>  SATTLER:</p>
<p>We haven't got a crisis.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well you only have a crisis once in a while and that is the real test of</p>
<p>   a constitution.</p>
<p>  SATTLER:</p>
<p>  Sure.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Any old constitution will do if it's calm weather. But it's when you start</p>
<p>   having a few difficulties that you need one that we know on the basis of</p>
<p>   a hundred years experience has worked extremely well. But look, the goodness</p>
<p>   and decency of the Australian people is unrelated to a constitutional reform.</p>
<p>  SATTLER:</p>
<p>  I did hear you also warn voters against people on the yes side promising</p>
<p>   a new nirvana if the republic gets up. I haven't heard anybody say that.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>That is implicit in..I mean..</p>
<p>  SATTLER:</p>
<p>No one has said it.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well hang on, hang on. People are running around saying you know, you'll</p>
<p>   feel so much better. I mean, look, whatever the result is there'll be some</p>
<p>   people pleased and some people disappointed. But I have absolutely no doubt</p>
<p>   that whatever the result Australians will as always work together in a very</p>
<p>   sensible cooperative fashion from Sunday onwards no matter the result is.</p>
<p>  SATTLER:</p>
<p>All right. Well we better defer to our listeners. We'll take a short break,</p>
<p>   and there is a commercial coming up for the yes committee. Don't blame me</p>
<p>   but we'll take some calls shortly okay. Thank you very much.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Okay.</p>
<p>  [commercial break]</p>
<p>  SATTLER:</p>
<p>  One day out from the referendum on the republic. The Prime Minister's my</p>
<p>   guest talking to me from his office in Canberra.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Sydney.</p>
<p>  SATTLER:</p>
<p>  Oh you're in Sydney. Sorry. I'd want to get out of Canberra too. Sydney's</p>
<p>   much better. Here's some sad news - you're a cricket devotee as we know</p>
<p>   and I'm sure you've got the Test Match probably on in the office some where</p>
<p>   there. But Malcolm Marshall, who's the former West Indies' great cricketer,</p>
<p>   he got 376 wickets in 81 matches, has died at aged 41 of cancer. Can you</p>
<p>   believe it?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Very sad. He was a great cricketer.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>  You had him as a guest at The Lodge at one stage [inaudible]?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  I did yes. Well I wasn't Prime Minister then, Malcolm Fraser was. But it</p>
<p>   was in the 70s. Very very sad indeed. The cricket world will be very upset</p>
<p>   about that. It's very [inaudible].</p>
<p>  SATTLER:</p>
<p>  All right. Jacqueline's on the line, wants to talk to you. Hello Jacqueline,</p>
<p>   the Prime Minister's listening.</p>
<p>  CALLER:</p>
<p>  Good morning Prime Minister, and good morning Howard.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  I want to go three very quick questions but first I want to congratulate</p>
<p>   the Prime Minister on getting the process going because no matter what's</p>
<p>   happened, we will have all learnt an awful lot about this. I'm a yes voter</p>
<p>   and I want to ask - are you the only Prime Minister in Australia's history</p>
<p>   to vote against his own bill for a referendum? Two..and campaign against</p>
<p>   it? And two - why didn't you support us in the yes campaign and go down</p>
<p>   in history as the creator of the republican Commonwealth of Australia? And</p>
<p>   if monarchy is so good, why not an Australian monarchy? Maybe a branch of</p>
<p>   the Windsors or maybe your own family.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Oh dear.</p>
<p>  SATTLER:</p>
<p>  Prince Howard.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Jacqueline, the answer to the first question is I could be the first Prime</p>
<p>   Minister to have done that. Can I turn the proposition on its head and say</p>
<p>   that I'm the first Prime Minister perhaps to recognise that while I have</p>
<p>   a view about something it may not be held as strongly by my fellow Australians</p>
<p>   and they have a right to express their opinion. And I think a Prime Minister</p>
<p>   that's willing to put something to a vote while he personally doesn't support</p>
<p>   it is somebody who respects the ultimate authority and sovereignty and commonsense</p>
<p>   of the Australian people. Whatever result comes out of tomorrow will be</p>
<p>   the right result because the customer's always right in a democracy and</p>
<p>   the Australian people usually get these things right. And I will accept</p>
<p>   and act upon and observe the result whatever it may be. The second question</p>
<p>   you asked me is why didn't I campaign for it. Well I didn't campaign for</p>
<p>   it because I don't believe in it. I believe for the reasons I've been outlining</p>
<p>   over the past few minutes that our present system will not be made better</p>
<p>   by this particular model. I think our present system is extremely good.</p>
<p>   As to the third question - no I've never thought that made any particular</p>
<p>   sense at all. I think the present arrangement whereby the Governor-General</p>
<p>   has evolved into being effectively Australia's head of state, he exercises</p>
<p>   all the powers given to him under the constitution. This is a completely</p>
<p>   utterly freestanding independent country. I think that is the preferable</p>
<p>   arrangement. Certainly preferable to the alternative that's being put up</p>
<p>   tomorrow that does have a powerful capricious removal of the president which</p>
<p>   can't be found in any republican constitution in the world.</p>
<p>  SATTLER:</p>
<p>  All right. Trent's your next caller Prime Minister. Hello Trent.</p>
<p>  CALLER:</p>
<p>  Oh high. [inaudible] Prime Minister, I'm only 16 and I can't vote but I</p>
<p>   reckon we should become a republic. And I'd just like you to clear something</p>
<p>   up for me. The new segment 126 which states that this constitution and all</p>
<p>   laws made under it by Parliament shall be binding on the courts and people</p>
<p>   of every State and of every part of the Commonwealth not withstanding any</p>
<p>   of the laws of any State. Isn't it already the same as segment 109 which</p>
<p>   states that the laws of the Commonwealth prevail over State laws anyway?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well I'd just have to look at the two of them. I don't carry it around in</p>
<p>   my head. But certainly as I understand it there's no intention of altering</p>
<p>   the provision that says that where there is a conflict between the Commonwealth</p>
<p>   law and the State law the Commonwealth law prevails. I'm not.I don't think</p>
<p>   there's any fundamental conflict between those two things. But quite frankly</p>
<p>   Trent I'd need to look at those two provisions myself before I gave some</p>
<p>   kind of refined legal opinion. But the provisions...</p>
<p>  SATTLER:</p>
<p>  Daryl Williams says there's nothing to fear there. That's what..</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I'm not quite sure frankly what the point is. But as far as I am concerned,</p>
<p>   there are clear, unarguable weaknesses in the republican model and those</p>
<p>   relate particularly to the dismissal procedures. I think the other weakness</p>
<p>   of the republican model is that because you have got this public nomination</p>
<p>   process some quality people won't through fear of embarrassment make themselves</p>
<p>   available. And the pool of talent from which future presidents might be</p>
<p>   drawn will not be as deep as that from which past governor-generals have</p>
<p>   been taken.</p>
<p>  SATTLER:</p>
<p>  All right. Very quickly to Annette's call. Hello Annette.</p>
<p>  CALLER:</p>
<p>  Oh, hello. Good morning Prime Minister.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Good morning.</p>
<p>  CALLER:</p>
<p>  I would like to say that I wish there were more politicians like Tim Fischer</p>
<p>   who lacks the hypocrisy of people like yourself, who says that both.the</p>
<p>   model is okay. And he is absolutely ashamed at the way his colleagues are</p>
<p>   canvassing this issue and that the voting is quite clear. It's whether you</p>
<p>   want a monarchy or not. But I think all this fear campaign of saying the</p>
<p>   model is flawed is very, very hypocritical.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well, I guess you're in favour of the yes case are you?</p>
<p>  CALLER:</p>
<p>  I am.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well, I mean, fair enough, I mean, that's your right.</p>
<p>  CALLER:</p>
<p>  But I just find the hypocrisy.I think, fine, if you want to argue for a</p>
<p>   monarchy do so.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well, if you want to argue as I have done for the present system and also</p>
<p>   find consistent with that some flaws in the alternative there is nothing</p>
<p>   hypocritical about that. I mean, I know some people on the yes side find</p>
<p>   some of the arguments about the weaknesses of the model uncomfortable but</p>
<p>   there is an assumption on the part of the "yes" case that there</p>
<p>   is really no respectable argument in favour of the status quo. I mean, the</p>
<p>   thing I have found most difficult to accept about this whole campaign is</p>
<p>   the starting point of so many of the republicans and that is that the idea</p>
<p>   that anybody could possibly support the status quo is absurd. Now, a lot</p>
<p>   of people support it not through any particular nostalgia about the monarchy</p>
<p>   or anything like that, they support it simply because they know it works</p>
<p>   and they know that it's helped to deliver to this country 200 years of stability</p>
<p>   and.</p>
<p>  SATTLER:</p>
<p>  You don't think we can evolve any further, Prime Minister?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well, look, I don't think going to this model will make.</p>
<p>  SATTLER:</p>
<p>  I mean, we have evolved in the past 98 years haven't we?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  I beg your pardon?</p>
<p>  SATTLER:</p>
<p>  We have evolved in the last 98 years.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Of course we have. Look, every country goes on evolving. But what we are</p>
<p>   being asked to do tomorrow is vote for something that, in my view, my respectful</p>
