DJAKARTA<br />
SY E72C H BY FR ZSL" DE11' FP SUHA RTC AT DINNER GIVEN 2 4 JUR 1968<br />
BY THE PRIME MINISTER, MR. JOHN GORTON 14 JUNE 1968<br />
Your Excellency Prime Minister Gorton and Madame Gorton, Your Excellencies,<br />
Ladies and Gentlemen, Honourable Guests:-<br />
After having been in the capital of Djakarta for a few days, Your<br />
IExcellency Prime Minister Gorton and Madame Gorton are going to visit some<br />
areas of Indonesia. I am convinced that this visit to the other areas will be<br />
very useful: Your Excellency will then be able to kcnow better the Indonesian<br />
people, and their culture: you will know each other better from heart to heart:<br />
you will better understand their everyday problems and their efforts to overcome<br />
them. Above everything else Your Excellency and your party will even more<br />
enjoy the friendly atmosphere as is the wish of the Indonesian people. I am sure<br />
that you will feel all these thingg even better, because among your party there<br />
is somebody for whom it will be easier to understand them, namely Madame<br />
Gorton who speaks indonesian fluently.<br />
It is indeed an honour, it is even very moving for the Indonesian<br />
people that this time outside the Malay race we have a State guest who is well<br />
versed in our language and who has a thorough knowledge of the Indonesian culture.<br />
I feel that Mrs. Gorton's fluency and her knowledge of the Indonesian language<br />
are a manifestation of the friendly feelings and the understanding of the Australian<br />
people about the Indonesian people.<br />
In the last two years these bonds of friendship have become even<br />
more visible: an exchange of visits among officials and leaders of our two nations<br />
have taken place, also among private persons. Indonesia has also received<br />
financial, and technical help and other forms of assistance which are very useful<br />
for us and which we value very highly. But much more important than material<br />
help are the deeper foundations as I see them, foundations which are manifestations<br />
of an understanding from Australia about the problems which are being faced by<br />
the Indonesian people at present. Indeed the Indonesian nation is at present<br />
focussing her attention and her ability to bring about economic stability, and on<br />
the basis of this economic stability we will soon begin with development in the<br />
truest sense of the word. We fully realise that in developing Indonesia's economy<br />
emphasis must be laid upon the mobilisation of our own forces. However, we<br />
are also fully aware of all the limitations which are still binding us: so that<br />
foreign assistance and co-operation have a considerable influence in accelerating<br />
efforts by the Indonesian nation in developing their economic potentialities.<br />
I sincerely appreciate the fact that Your Excellency during this<br />
visit has been able better to understand the problems which we are facing. This<br />
understanding can be seen very clearly during our discussions which I held with<br />
Your Excellency this afternoon, especially with regard to relations between our<br />
two nations and Indonesia's efforts to improve her economic facilities. The open<br />
discussions and heart-to-heart talks held between us concerning international<br />
problems in general and about Asia in particular are indeed very useful. Cur<br />
exchange of thoughts have convinced me that the future of the friendship between<br />
our two nations is extremely hopeful and that it contains many useful<br />
possibilities for both parties. / 2 </p>
<p>2.<br />
With regard to relations between nations in the world at present,<br />
I get the impression that an exchange of visits between leaders of nations is<br />
extremely useful for strengthening the bonds of friendship, because mutual visits<br />
bring mutual understanding. It is mutual understanding and mutual esteem that<br />
are absolute requisites for the realisation of everlasting peace in the world. With<br />
this general picture in mind I believe that Your Excellency would agree with me<br />
that your visit to Indonesia this time is truly of great significance for Australia<br />
and Indonesia, The results of this visit will become a firm foundation for future<br />
friendly relations and co-operation between our two nations and, let us hope<br />
that it will be a positive contribution towards the stabilisation of our area.<br />
Your Excellency Prime Minister Gorton and Madame Gorton,<br />
tomorrow Your Excellency and Madame and your party will leave Djakarta to<br />
continue your trip to various areas of Indonesia, after which you will be leaving<br />
our country. My wife and I very much regret not to be able to accompany you on<br />
your further trip in Indonesia. However, I believe that this will not in the least<br />
reduce the value of your observation trip. Therefore, I shall avail myself of<br />
this opportunity to wish you a happy journey.<br />
During your visi t we feel that Your Excellency has succeeded in<br />
creating a friendly atmosphere towards the Indonesian people: we also hope that<br />
when leaving Indonesia Your Excellency will take home with you the friendly<br />
feelings of the Indonesian people. On behalf of the people of Indonesia and on<br />
my own behalf, through Your Excellency, I wish to send friendly greetings to<br />
the Australian people. At the end, allow me to invite Your Excellency, Your Excellencies,<br />
ladies and gentlemen, and all honourable guests to raise your glasses and to<br />
drink to the prosperity of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth 11 and to the health of<br />
Your Excellency and Madame Gorton and your party and to the prosperity and<br />
progress of the Australian people.<br />
Thank you. </p>
