The Prime Ministerâs Literary Awards celebrate the contribution of Australian literature to our cultural and intellectual life.</p>
<p>Tonight's Awards recognise excellence in Australian fiction, poetry, non-fiction, young adult fiction and childrenâs fiction.</p>
<p>They also recognise excellence in Australian history.</p>
<p>More than 500 books were entered into the 2014 Prime Ministerâs Literary Awards.</p>
<p>In addition to tonight's awards, the Government announces the formation of a new Book Council of Australia to promote Australian writing nationally and internationally and encourage and promote reading.</p>
<p>Books are vital to our culture and to our identity.</p>
<p>This new body will ensure Australiaâs literary sector and its writers are strongly supported.</p>
<p>It will strengthen the sectorâs capacity to respond to rapid change brought by new technologies.</p>
<p>Members of the new Book Council of Australia will be drawn from a wide range of literary and industry organisations.</p>
<p>We congratulate each of the winners and to all the shortlisted writers on their outstanding achievement.</p>
