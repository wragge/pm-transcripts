PRIME MCNISTER PRESS STATE'ENT NO. 492<br />
9 APRIL 1975<br />
INTER-STATE COMMISSION ( QUEENSLAND RELEASE ONLY)<br />
The Prime Minister, Mr Whitlam, today dismissed suggestions<br />
that the establishment of an Inter-State Commission might affect<br />
transport costs in Queensland.<br />
He rejected claims by the Queensland Premier that the<br />
Inter-State Commission could result in increased rail<br />
freights. He denied that industries in North Queensland would<br />
be disadvantaged. " The Inter-State Commission is certainly not a plot to<br />
take-over Queensland's railways," Mr Whitlam said.<br />
" Mr Bjelke-Petersen knows full well that there can be no<br />
take-over of State railways any State railways by the<br />
Commonwealth acting alone.<br />
" Section 51 of the Constitution provides for the consent<br />
of the State, on terms which are satisfactory to both parties,"<br />
he said. Mr Whitlan said the revival of the Inter-State Commission<br />
had been supported by many non-Labor politicians, in particular,<br />
Queensland's. Mr Killen.<br />
As recently as March 11 this year, Mr Killen had supported<br />
the idea in a speech to the Brisbane Press Club, the Prime<br />
Minister said.<br />
Mr Whitlam pointed out that the Inter-State Commission<br />
had been written into the original Constitution in 1901.<br />
" In terms of our federal system which the Queensland<br />
Premier is usually so anxious to defend, there could be nothing<br />
more legitimate that the revival of the Inter-State Commission,"<br />
he said. </p>
