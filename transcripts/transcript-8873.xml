STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING, MP<br />
REMARKS AT DINNER IN HONOUR OF PRIME MINISTER VO VAN ICIET<br />
PARLIAMENT HOUSE, 27 MAY 1993<br />
Embargo 8.30 pm<br />
Prime Minister, on behalf of the Australian Government<br />
and people it is my pleasure to welcome you on this<br />
historic visit.<br />
Our two countries have enjoyed diplomatic relations for<br />
twenty years, but this is the first time a head of<br />
government from the Socialist Republic of Vietnam has<br />
come to Australia.<br />
Let me say you are very welcome.<br />
Those twenty years have seen the growth of cooperation<br />
and understanding on a broad range of issues, both<br />
bilateral and multilateral.<br />
In the past few years we have seen frequent ministerial<br />
and official-level visits, cultural and scientific<br />
exchanges, and the implementation of a number of<br />
development assistance programs in education, health and<br />
resources. In recent years our commercial relations have begun to<br />
grow strongly.<br />
Between 1990 and 1992 two-way trade has grown from<br />
$ 42 million to $ 252 million.<br />
Representati-ves-of a -number -of.-Australian companies<br />
operating in Vietnam have joined us for dinner this<br />
evening. We are delighted that BHP will play a major role in the<br />
Dai Hung oilfield project.<br />
Other Australian companies are actively involved in areas<br />
such as coal processing, telecommunications and banking. Q00 2/ 005 </p>

We can look with great confidence to the future of our<br />
relationship. This morning we witnessed the signing of a Memorandum of<br />
Understanding on Development Cooperation covering a total<br />
of $ 100 million economic assistance over a four-year<br />
period. This should be taken as another manifestation of our<br />
friendship and maturing relationship.<br />
Prime Minister, when we reflect on the history of the<br />
Australia-Vietnam relationship, we see proof of our<br />
capacity to change.<br />
Proof that we can let old wounds heal, so that future<br />
generations will not inherit them and pay the price of<br />
past animosities.<br />
The war which so ravaged Vietnam also left an indelible<br />
mark on this country.<br />
Today, in Australia, we do not debate the rights and<br />
wrongs of our engagement in Vietnam so much as the ways<br />
in which those who fought there, and the families of<br />
those who died there, can be compensated and assisted.<br />
Prime Minister, the Asia-Pacific region now faces a very<br />
promising future.<br />
Your country has embarked on a program to reform and open<br />
up the Vietnamese economy to the outside world.<br />
So, in quite fundamental ways, have we.<br />
As a result, we now find a great many complementary<br />
interests and considerable scope for expanding our<br />
commercial relationship.<br />
In our discussions this morning, I explained that,<br />
although Australia is a medium-sized economy, we have in<br />
many industrial sectors technologies of world-class<br />
standard. Australian companies are well placed to help Vietnam's<br />
development in sectors such as transportation,<br />
telecommunications, infrastructure, minerals and energy,<br />
woollen textiles and services.<br />
I was glad that today we were also able to witness the<br />
signing of a Memorandum of Understanding on bilateral air<br />
services. I am confident we will soon be in a position to establish<br />
regular air services. </p>

Direct scheduled flights between Vietnam and Australia<br />
will assist business and tourist links, and help develop<br />
contact between our two peoples, not least, Vietnamese<br />
Australians and their families in Vietnam.<br />
Prime Minister, as you are aware Australia is now home to<br />
135,000 people of Vietnamese origin.<br />
Vietnamese Australians have already made a very<br />
considerable contribution to our national life.<br />
In the multicultural environment of this country, they<br />
have built strong and purposeful communities, and<br />
participate increasingly in our political life.<br />
We believe that in due course the Vietnamese community in<br />
Australia will become one of the main conduits of our<br />
relationship with Vietnam.<br />
I appreciated very much the frank and constructive<br />
discussion we had this morning about the Vietnamese<br />
community in Australia.<br />
I-warmly welcome your commitment towards reconciliation<br />
with our local Vietnamese community and your willingness<br />
to receive an Australian delegation to learn more at<br />
first hand about human rights and other conditions in<br />
Vietnam. This gesture is greatly appreciated by the Australian<br />
Government and public.<br />
For our part, let me say that the Australian Government<br />
will do all in its power to encourage more harmonious and<br />
constructive relations between Vietnam and the Vietnamese<br />
community in Australia.<br />
Prime Minister, the timing of your visit to Australia is<br />
auspicious In that it coincides with the heartening news<br />
we have received this week about the high turn-out of<br />
voters in the United Nations-sponsored elections in<br />
Cambodia. Both Vietnam and Australia played important roles in the<br />
preceding Cambodia peace process.<br />
We share an earnest hope that the long-suffering people<br />
of Cambodia might finally be able to enjoy peace and a<br />
better -way -of -1ife.<br />
Prime Minister, we should like your visit to Australia to<br />
define a new phase in Australia-Vietnam relations.<br />
Not only are both sides keen to expand our bilateral<br />
commercial relations, but we recognise the scope for<br />
fruitful cooperation between our countries in the wider<br />
Asia-Pacific region. IA 0041000 </p>
<p>02/ 06 ' 93 09: 07' OS 273 2923<br />
I am also sure that the human links between our countries<br />
will become a vital source of strength to us both.<br />
I believe we have every reason for confidence that our<br />
relationship will flourish and endure.<br />
I should now like to invite the Leader of the Opposition<br />
to join me in welcoming you to Australia.<br />
