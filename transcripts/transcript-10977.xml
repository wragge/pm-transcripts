    <content><![CDATA[<p>E&amp;OE...............................................................................................................................</p>
<p>Thank you very much Andrea, other distinguished guests, ladies</p>
<p>   and gentlemen and can I invite you all to put your hands together</p>
<p>   for the band for the tremendous rendition of our national anthem.</p>
<p>May I say how delighted I am to be here at the RSL Club, to thank</p>
<p>   all of you for coming along this morning. I just want to say a very</p>
<p>   small number of things about what the Government believes in, why</p>
<p>   I am here. I want to commend to you the tremendously energetic job</p>
<p>   that Andrea West is doing as your local member and then I would</p>
<p>   like the opportunity to meet you over a cup of tea to hear what</p>
<p>   you have got to say to me and to respond to your questions.</p>
<p>The Government that I have the privilege of leading was elected</p>
<p>   about two-and-a- quarter years ago. We have taken a large number</p>
<p>   of decisions over that time. I am very happy to say that over the</p>
<p>   last week we have been able to resolve an issue that produced differences</p>
<p>   of opinion within the Australian community and that's the issue</p>
<p>   of Native Title. And the reason why it took a long time for us to</p>
<p>   resolve it earlier was that the Government was standing up for one</p>
<p>   very simple principle, and that is that all sections of the Australian</p>
<p>   community should be treated equally.</p>
<p>The reason why we couldn't get it through the Senate originally</p>
<p>   was that the Senate wanted to treat one section of the community</p>
<p>   more favourably than others. And we held out against that and in</p>
<p>   the end Senator Harradine and I were able to reach an agreement.</p>
<p>   And I think all Australians are relieved that that agreement has</p>
<p>   been reached and the issue has been put behind us. We want to treat</p>
<p>   everybody fairly but we want to treat everybody equally. I have</p>
<p>   never believed that there should be special privileges for one section</p>
<p>   of the Australian community that are denied to other sections of</p>
<p>   the Australian community.</p>
<p>And I am delighted, as Prime Minister, that that issue is now behind</p>
<p>   us and we can move the focus of national attention in Australia</p>
<p>   onto issues that I believe are of ongoing concern to Australians</p>
<p>   in their everyday life. Issues related to interest rates, making</p>
<p>   our taxation system fairer, and we will be having a great deal to</p>
<p>   say about that not too long from now. And can I say that when the</p>
<p>   taxation plan comes out it will address what I find the growing</p>
<p>   concern of Australians to be, and that is that our existing system</p>
<p>   is no longer fair : that people in the middle feel they are being</p>
<p>   squeezed, they feel that they are contributing more than their fair</p>
<p>   share, and they believe that the system ought to be changed. And</p>
<p>   we are going to change it to make it fairer. And I know that there</p>
<p>   are some people saying to us, "don't touch that it's</p>
<p>   too hard". Well, I wasn't elected to my present position</p>
<p>   to leave things alone because they were too hard. I was elected</p>
<p>   to my present position because the majority of the Australian people</p>
<p>   two-and-a-quarter years ago decided they wanted it and they put</p>
<p>   me there to do things for the good of Australia.</p>
<p>And the reason that I am standing up for a reformed taxation system</p>
<p>   is that I really, genuinely believe in all my being that this country</p>
<p>   needs a better, fairer taxation system. The easy option would be</p>
<p>   to say it's too hard, it's too unpopular, the opposition</p>
<p>   will campaign against it, the media will criticise it, some people</p>
<p>   might get upset by it. But that is not what you are elected to do</p>
<p>   in public life, you are elected to argue for and advocate those</p>
<p>   things that are good for Australia.</p>
<p>There are things about Australia at the present time that I don't</p>
<p>   want to change because those things are good and valuable and they</p>
<p>   are things that I have always held very dear as an Australian. And</p>
<p>   I am a great believer in public life that you have got to chose</p>
<p>   between the things that should be preserved and never changed and</p>
<p>   the things that ought to be changed because they are no longer operating</p>
<p>   effectively and fairly.</p>
<p>And one of the things that we ought to hang on to, of course, is</p>
<p>   this beautiful flag that is behind me. Now, I know there are some</p>
<p>   people that have criticised me. They have criticised me for years</p>
<p>   for sticking up for the flag. They have said I am old-fashioned,</p>
<p>   they have said I am ought of touch. Well, I stick up for the flag</p>
<p>   because I believe it is something that binds all of us together,</p>
<p>   it is a reminder of our history, but it is also a reminder of how</p>
<p>   special and unique we are as Australians, because of the presence</p>
<p>   of the Southern Cross and the Federation Star. And I will always</p>
<p>   stand up for things from our past that are worth preserving. But</p>
<p>   there are some things from our past that are no longer keeping us</p>
<p>   together and are no longer serving Australia well. And they're</p>
<p>   the sort of things that you should seek to change.</p>
<p>In other words, you hang onto those things that should be kept</p>
<p>   and preserved with all your passion and all your might, but you</p>
<p>   also at the same time you argue to change and improve the things</p>
<p>   that need to be made better. And one of the things that does need</p>
<p>   to be made better in Australia is we do need a fairer taxation system.</p>
<p>   And I can promise you that when it comes out it will be fairer than</p>
<p>   the present one. It will protect people on fixed incomes. It will</p>
<p>   protect people on the pension and it will be particularly beneficial</p>
<p>   for Australian families. And that will be coming out before too</p>
<p>   long. And I think the Australian community will give the Government</p>
<p>   marks for having a go and having the guts to try and reform an unfair,</p>
<p>   malfunctioning system. And that's the one that we have at the</p>
<p>   present time. And the Coalition is very committed to that.</p>
<p>The other thing that I wanted to say to you this morning, is that</p>
<p>   a gathering like this is a wonderful reminder of one of the special</p>
<p>   characteristics that Australians have and that is that they have</p>
<p>   a great sense of community and a great sense of volunteer effort.</p>
<p>I have just been to the leisure centre and it's one of those</p>
<p>   organisations that I don't think I can think of a duplicate</p>
<p>   anywhere in Australia. It's entirely run by volunteers and</p>
<p>   it has been operating for about twenty years or more. It receives</p>
<p>   no direct assistance from any government or semi-government organisation.</p>
<p>   And it's a remarkable demonstration of that great volunteer</p>
<p>   community spirit within the Australian community. Voluntarism rather</p>
<p>   than dying in Australia is getting stronger every year. And one</p>
<p>   of the things that inspires me more as an Australian than anything</p>
<p>   else, is the way in which we all come together to work for the community</p>
<p>   good when that is needed. And certainly when there are the challenges</p>
<p>   of disasters and catastrophes Australians work together like in</p>
<p>   no other circumstances. And it's a remarkable element of the</p>
<p>   Australian character.</p>
<p>And this morning, I know, is gathered representatives of all sections</p>
<p>   of the community here in the electorate of Bowman, and particularly</p>
<p>   in this district. And I am delighted that Andrea has been able to</p>
<p>   bring you together because it is an opportunity for me to hear what</p>
<p>   you have got to say, to receive some advice. I always receive advice,</p>
<p>   I try and listen to the good advice and the other advice I also</p>
<p>   listen to that as well. But part of interacting in politics is for</p>
<p>   those who are privileged enough to hold elected office to move around</p>
<p>   and to meet Australians. And I am often asked what is the best part</p>
<p>   of being Prime Minister. And my answer is unhesitantly always, that</p>
<p>   the best part of being Prime Minister is the opportunity it gives</p>
<p>   you to meet different sections of the Australian community in different</p>
<p>   parts of our country. And no one group is the same. No one RSL club</p>
<p>   in Australia is the same as another. And no one leagues club in</p>
<p>   Australia is the same as another. No one Senior Citizens' centre</p>
<p>   is the same. No one section of the Australian community is the same</p>
<p>   as another. And although we are a very united, cohesive people,</p>
<p>   we have our own regional characteristics. I am always conscious</p>
<p>   of that as I move around, and therefore it is always a stimulation</p>
<p>   and a pleasure to have the opportunity of meeting different sections</p>
<p>   of the Australian community, and that's what I want to do this</p>
<p>   morning.</p>
<p>The last thing that I want to say to you, ladies and gentlemen,</p>
<p>   is that all of us as Australians are effected by the overall strength</p>
<p>   of the Australian economy. I haven't come here to give a long</p>
<p>   economics lecture, but I have come to say one thing about the Australian</p>
<p>   economy, and that is that it is facing a lot of challenge at the</p>
<p>   moment because of what is happening in Asian-Pacific region. The</p>
<p>   "melt down" as they call it in Asia , is the worst economic</p>
<p>   set of circumstances to face those countries since the end of World</p>
<p>   War II. And until about a year ago everybody was talking very optimistically</p>
<p>   about economic growth in countries like Malaysia and Singapore and</p>
<p>   Korea and Hong Kong and Japan. But in the last year so much of that</p>
<p>   has changed and it does represent a challenge to Australia.</p>
<p>And I am very pleased that over the last two-and-a-quarter years</p>
<p>   we have been able to get the Australian budget back into balance.</p>
<p>   If we hadn't done that we would be effected a lot worse by</p>
<p>   what is happening in Asia. I am very pleased that we have been able</p>
<p>   to get interest rates down and get inflation down and to reduce</p>
<p>   a lot of the debt that the Australian Government had two to three</p>
<p>   years ago because in doing that we have made ourselves stronger</p>
<p>   and we have given ourselves better protection against the downturn</p>
<p>   in Asia. We now sell more than fifty percent of our goods and services</p>
<p>   to the Asian-Pacific region and it is inevitable, therefore, that</p>
<p>   if you have a downturn there that will effect us. And therefore</p>
<p>   it is all the more important that we should take action to protect</p>
<p>   ourselves against that downturn. And I know that some people wonder</p>
<p>   why it is that we gave some help to Indonesia and Korea and a to</p>
<p>   Thailand when their economies got into trouble. We lent them some</p>
<p>   money, we didn't give it to them. And we expect to get it back.</p>
<p>   But we did it because those countries are important to us. They</p>
<p>   buy goods and services from us. And if they don't buy goods</p>
<p>   and services from us well we won't be as prosperous. I think</p>
<p>   it is very important that that be understood. It is very important</p>
<p>   that we realise that if you help a country that trades with you,</p>
<p>   that country is stronger and better able to buy your goods and services.</p>
<p>We now live in a world, whether we like it or not, that is interconnected.</p>
<p>   No country has the option of saying, we're going to put up</p>
<p>   a barrier, go away, we don't want to have anything to do with</p>
<p>   the rest of the world. We can't operate like that. We want</p>
<p>   to sell goods overseas, if we want to sell goods overseas then we</p>
<p>   have got to be willing to buy some of the goods and services that</p>
<p>   other countries offer. It's difficult on occasions, and I know</p>
<p>   that sometimes it's easier to say, well if imports are coming</p>
<p>   in, let's shut them out. But in the end that won't work.</p>
<p>   Because if we shut somebody else's goods out, they're</p>
<p>   going to shut ours out. And that's going to hurt us a lot more</p>
<p>   than it hurts them. And that is one of the issues that Australia</p>
<p>   has to face . And we've taken a lot of protective action over</p>
<p>   the last two-and-quarter years to give the Australian economy an</p>
<p>   inner strength that if it didn't have, it would have more adversely</p>
<p>   effected by what has occurred.</p>
<p>And the very last thing I do want to say again, is that I am delighted</p>
<p>   to be on a stage with Andrea who has been your member since March</p>
<p>   of 1996, and Andrea I can assure you, is a very hard working member</p>
<p>   for the electorate of Bowman in the </p>
<p>Federal Parliament. She's a very persistent pursuer of Ministers.</p>
<p>   She is a very constant advocate of the interests of this part of</p>
<p>   Brisbane in the Party Room. And she is a person that pursues very,</p>
<p>   very vigorously on behalf of the community of Bowman and the community</p>
<p>   that she represents within the Brisbane area in the Federal Parliament,</p>
<p>   she pursues those interests very, very vigorously. And I very, very</p>
<p>   warmly commend her to you and I congratulate her on the vigorous</p>
<p>   job that she has done in representing your interests in the Federal</p>
<p>   Parliament.</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, as always it is a great pleasure to be in</p>
<p>   Queensland, to be in Brisbane. Thank you for coming along this morning,</p>
<p>   and I would be very happy to meet all of you over a cup of tea.</p>
<p>   Thank you very much.</p>
