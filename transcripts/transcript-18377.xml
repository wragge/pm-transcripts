Prime Minister Julia Gillard today announced that clean-up and recovery grants of up to $25,000 will be provided to communities in Queensland inundated by recent floods.</p>
<p>Primary producers, small businesses and not-for-profit organisations in the local government areas (LGAs) of Balonne, Barcaldine, Blackall-Tambo, Maranoa, Murweh and Paroo will be eligible for the grants of up to $25,000.</p>
<p>This is in addition to emergency assistance provided to families and individuals in Balonne, Barcaldine, Blackall-Tambo, Central Highlands, Murweh, Maranoa Shires, previously announced by the Prime Minister.</p>
<p>The grants and other emergency assistance will be jointly funded by the Australian and Queensland governments under the Natural Disaster Relief and Recovery Arrangements (NDRRA).</p>
<p>In addition to this NDRRA assistance, the Prime Minister yesterday announced that the Australian Government Disaster Recovery Payment (AGDRP) of $1000 per adult and $400 per child has been made available through Centrelink to eligible people who have been impacted by flooding in disaster declared areas.</p>
<p>In Queensland, these areas include the shires of Balonne, Barcaldine, Blackall Tambo, Maranoa, Murweh and Paroo.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister acknowledged that many flood affected regions have only partially recovered from the previous flood events of 2011 and 2010, and that prompt financial assistance is required to help communities get back on their feet.</p>
<p>The grants also recognise the important role that small businesses, primary producers and not-for-profits play in delivering services and supporting community recovery following a disaster.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister also announced that the Australian Government would provide $2 million to the Queensland Premier's Disaster Relief Appeal, matching the state government's contribution.</p>
<p>The Australian Government is committed to assisting the people of Queensland to get back on their feet.  The Government stood by Queenslanders in their efforts to respond to last summer's devastating events, and it will do so again.</p>
<p>The Australian Government continues to work closely with the Queensland Government to deliver assistance to flood affected communities.</p>
<p>More information about disaster grants and assistance, including advice on how to apply, is available from the Disaster Assist website at <a href="http://www.disasterassist.gov.au">www.disasterassist.gov.au</a>.  </p>
