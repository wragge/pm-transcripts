    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Rudd Government will fast track its nation-building agenda to help shield Australians from the global financial crisis.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Kevin Rudd today announced that the Government will accelerate the implementation of the Government's three nation building funds.</p>
<p>Ministers will bring forward interim Infrastructure Reports to December 2008 so that work can commence in 2009 on projects in the key areas of:</p>
<p>     *  Education and Research;</p>
<p>     * Health and Hospitals; and</p>
<p>     * Transport and Communications.</p>
<p>The Rudd Government is taking decisive action to sustain growth and protect Australians from the fall-out from the global financial crisis.</p>
<p>That is why the Rudd Government's $10.4 billion Economic Security Strategy will strengthen the national economy and support Australian households during the global financial crisis.</p>
<p>To fast-track these projects, the Government will be seeking referral of the legislation for the Nation Building Funds to a Senate Committee this week.</p>
<p>The Government calls on the Opposition to make sure that there are no obstacles to the implementation of this commitment.</p>
<p>Further today, the Government committed to:</p>
<p>     * Speed up the implementation of the Government's Nation Building Funds, so that projects can be funded as early as possible.</p>
<p>     * Accelerate the establishment of boards for the Health and Hospitals Fund and the Education Investment Fund.</p>
<p>Today's announcement builds on the Rudd Government's recent decision to ask Infrastructure Australia to produce an interim report on the National Infrastructure Priority List by December 2008.</p>
<p>Fast-tracking the nation-building agenda can secure economic activity in the short term and expand growth potential in the medium to long term.</p>
<p>The Rudd Government has already commenced the first funding round of the Education Investment Fund, receiving some 14 submissions for new research facilities and capital expenditure in Australia's universities.</p>
<p>The Government has already committed more than $26 billion to its three new funds:</p>
<p>     * $12.6 billion towards the Building Australia Fund for transport and communications infrastructure;</p>
<p>     * $8.7 billion towards the Education Investment Fund for education infrastructure; and</p>
<p>     * $5.0 billion towards the Health and Hospitals Fund, for health infrastructure.</p>
