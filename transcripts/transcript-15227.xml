<p>Hello there,</p>
<p>Recently there have been suggestions that Federal Government intervention in traditional areas of state responsibility is a power grab by Canberra.</p>
<p>Let me make it clear, my government only intervenes in those areas where state or territory governments have not fulfilled their obligations and local communities feel let down, or where a co-operative approach having been patiently tried has clearly failed.</p>
<p>We intervened in the Northern Territory to help indigenous people because the Northern Territory Government had not met its responsibilities.  This intervention will clearly benefit the Aboriginal community.</p>
<p>The historic $10 billion plan to save the Murray-Darling Basin was conceived because the cooperative approach between the Commonwealth and the Murray-Darling Basin states had failed.  The states had repeatedly ignored the water-use caps voluntarily imposed under that co-operative arrangement.</p>
<p>We had tried the co-operative approach for years but it simply hadn't worked.</p>
<p>The Australian people are not especially concerned about theories of governance when it comes to the delivery of basic services such as health and education.</p>
<p>They want good outcomes and are not particularly fussed about which level of government delivers those outcomes.</p>
<p>Overwhelmingly they want more rather than less Commonwealth involvement especially where a state government has not delivered an adequate service.</p>
<p>In this spirit I will visit Devonport in northern Tasmania today to announce Federal Government funding to keep open a public hospital which services a community of some 70,000 people.  This is not something the Commonwealth has normally done in past, but action was needed.</p>
<p>The Tasmanian government has announced plans to downgrade the existing hospital which has left the local community deeply unhappy.</p>
<p>The Commonwealth's true role in this case is one of direct intervention to help the local community.</p>
<p>Thanks a lot for listening.   </p>
