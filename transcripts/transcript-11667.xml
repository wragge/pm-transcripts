<p>PRIME MINISTER</p>
<p>Your Excellency, the Governor General, Sir William Deane and Lady Deane,</p>
<p> the Lord Mayor of Sydney, Frank Sartor, Major General Peter Cosgrove and</p>
<p> my ministerial and parliamentary colleagues, ladies and gentlemen.</p>
<p>Today is an opportunity in a very public fashion for a group of Australians</p>
<p> to express their thanks, their gratitude and their respect to the men</p>
<p> and women of the Australian Defence Force as well as the men and women</p>
<p> of the Australian Federal Police for the remarkable job that they did</p>
<p> in bringing peace, stability and freedom to the people of East Timor.</p>
<p>In doing what they did, they followed in a great Australian military</p>
<p> tradition. A tradition that does not seek to impose the will of this country</p>
<p> on others, but rather to defend what is right and to uphold the opportunity</p>
<p> of people to live in freedom and in peace. And I have to say ladies and</p>
<p> gentlemen that of all of the great privileges that have come my way as</p>
<p> prime minister of this great country of ours, none has been more moving</p>
<p> and more important than the opportunity I had to say goodbye to the men</p>
<p> and women who were going to East Timor, understandably feeling a sense</p>
<p> of trepidation and concern about the future, but nonetheless determined</p>
<p> and resolved in a quiet professional way to do their duty by their profession</p>
<p> and by their country. And then the further opportunity, ladies and gentlemen</p>
<p> to visit them in Dili and elsewhere in East Timor, to see the magnificent</p>
<p> way in which they interacted with the people of East Timor and the quiet</p>
<p> professionalism that they were displaying.</p>
<p>So can I say on behalf of everybody gathered, to the men and women who</p>
<p> served Australia so well, who went abroad not in the name of one particular</p>
<p> point of view in Australia, but went abroad in the name of Australia representing</p>
<p> all of us to do a duty, to pursue a mission, to protect the people and</p>
<p> to bring peace in accordance with the great traditions for which Australia</p>
<p> stands.</p>
<p>To you Major General Cosgrove, for your splendid inspiring command, you</p>
<p> have won the respect and the affection of the entire nation. To Superintendent</p>
<p> Alan Blake, and Superintendent Donovan of the Australian Federal Police,</p>
<p> you should also feel very content and proud of the tremendous role that</p>
<p> you discharged in great danger and in accordance with the best traditions</p>
<p> of the professional police force to which you belong.</p>
<p>This is a proud day, not only for the people of Sydney, but also for</p>
<p> the people of Australia. We say thank you to the men and women of our</p>
<p> forces for a magnificent job done in our name which has brought great</p>
<p> credit to you and through you great credit to our nation.</p>
<p>[Ends]</p>
