ELECTORATE TALK<br />
I want -0 -: refly talk with you about the Federal Government's<br />
cormmite= n r o enhancing the position of Australians as individuals.<br />
The Goverr= e-nt has made a number of significant and often little<br />
noticed reforms to improve the position of individual men and<br />
women. Although the attention of the public and the media has<br />
generally focused on economic matters, our reforms in these areas<br />
are of equal importance to this Government.<br />
We have a basic commitment to creating the kind of situation where<br />
Australians can realise their own capacities and potential to the<br />
full. Our approach differs greatly from our political opponents.<br />
We seek to increase the capacity of people to make their own<br />
decisions to choose. We do not seek to increase thepower of<br />
Government. We seek to give meaningful and effective assistance<br />
to the disadvantaged in the community and not just to throw<br />
money at a problem and hope for some instant solution. Society<br />
simply does not work that way. In the final analysis, it is<br />
individual people who require help and care.<br />
Our record in these matters stands up well under scrutiny. Let us<br />
first look at the question of civil liberty. We have acted on a<br />
number of fronts. A Human Rights Commission will be established<br />
by 1 July this year. Its broad purpose is to promote individual<br />
richts and to make sure that our laws are in line with the United<br />
Nations international covenant on civil and political rights.<br />
We will introduce a Freedom of Information Bill that will give as<br />
a basic and fundamental right access to certain categories of<br />
Government information. It is designed to loosen up the flow of<br />
information from Government to the people.<br />
The Federal Government has also decided to implement the report<br />
of the Law Reform Commission on criminal investigation. This is a<br />
particularly important advance in civil liberties for people<br />
detained for questioning or arrested and charged with a federal<br />
criminal offence.<br />
The Gover--e t is currently negotiating with the States so that<br />
legal aid is provided in the most effective manner possible. We<br />
believe to be a fundamental right. In these times of budgetary<br />
restrair.-, -he funds we made available to this serviced increased by<br />
nearly cS -l -on. / Abori cinal </p>
<p>2<br />
Abori ina Land RP-ghts legislation to the Northern Territory has been<br />
passed a most si--ificant advance for the aborigi nal people. Our<br />
predecessors spoke about Aboriginal Land Rights, but we acted.<br />
There have also ee references to the Law Reform Commission on the<br />
protection of pri-vac; the law of defamation; and investigation into<br />
the possibil ity f plying aboriginal customary law in criminal matters<br />
to aborigines livincg nthe traditional manner.<br />
All in all, this is an impressive list that demonstrates our commitment<br />
to maintaining _--redom and dignity of the individual. It also<br />
demonstrates, of = zcuse, our capacity to act effectively in carrying<br />
out our policies.<br />
Let me now talk about our approach and our actions in assisting the<br />
disadvantaged. As I mentioned earlier, we are determined to provide<br />
assistance to those most in need in a way that does not make people<br />
more dependent on government. Our wish is to make people more independer<br />
to enhance their self-respect and dignity, and not to destroy it. We<br />
realise that quite often Government bureaucracies are unable to provide<br />
the kind of personal aid necessary. We therefore place great emphasis<br />
on the work of voluntary organisations. There is no doubt that they can<br />
bring a personal and highly effective approach to the formidable task of<br />
dispensing social welfare programmes. They frequently become aware of<br />
the need for assistance long before a Government Department itself. That<br />
is one important reason why we want close association with voluntary<br />
organisations so we can quickly know of emerging needs and changes in<br />
direction that may be required. Our actions in this area reflect our<br />
commitment. The indexation of pensions, for instance, automatically retains their<br />
real value. The family allowance scheme is of incalculable benefit to<br />
300,000 Australian familities who got virtually no benefit from the old<br />
system of tax deductions merely because their incomes were too low.<br />
There has been a re-orientation of child care programmes to give childre.<br />
of working mothers and single parent children adequate care. In this<br />
often controversial area, what we are seeking to do is simply provide<br />
the circumstances in which children are properly cared for. Also,<br />
Senator Guilfoyle, as Minister for Social Security, has been reviewing<br />
the administration of her Department to improve its capacity to assist<br />
individuals. We have set up a committee of experts from various Governm-<br />
Departments that provide over-the-counter service to see if improvements<br />
can be made in the effectiveness of this service. This is not a critici:<br />
of public servants, but a genuine desire to make sure that welfare<br />
services are dispensed with the greatest possible degree of concern<br />
and sensitivity.<br />
The Government has also initiated two significant experimental programme.<br />
within migrant communities. Migrant resource centres have been set up i-<br />
Sydney and Melbourne to see if we can get a more effective contact with<br />
migrants and can get a better delivery of Government services to migrant.<br />
I emphasise the programmes are experimental, but I believe they are well<br />
worth while and I am sure we will learn much from them.<br />
Our Housing Vouzher experiment scheme that enables people eligible for<br />
assistance to chccse their own housing is another example of our conce<br />
for individual freedom and choice. Throughout this year, the Governmen<br />
will continue = sly this approach to individual liberty and to those<br />
in need. We wi~ continue to seek to enhance the potential of<br />
Australians as rec. le. </p>
