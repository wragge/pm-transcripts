SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
OPENING OF THE 18TH GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE<br />
INTERNATIONAL UNION FOR THE CONSERVATION OF<br />
NATURE AND NATURAL RESOURCES<br />
PERTH 28 NOVEMBER 1990<br />
Your Royal Highness<br />
Premier Lawrence<br />
Distinguished international guests<br />
Ladies and gentlemen<br />
Australia is proud to host the 18th General Assembly of the<br />
IUCN.<br />
We do so aware of the responsibility we bear as stewards<br />
of the Australian continent and as active participants in<br />
the global environmental movement.<br />
This is indeed a heavy responsibility fiizt, because ours<br />
is an ancient, huge and extraordinary land mass that<br />
shelters and nourishes unique species of plants and animals.<br />
It is a laboratory for scientists, a magnet for tourists and<br />
above all a priceless part of the heritage of the world.<br />
Seod ours is a special responsibility because of the<br />
unique histor-y of human habitation on this continent.<br />
For at least .40,000 years, the Australian Aboriginal people<br />
exercised exclusive stewardship of this continent, acting<br />
out their belief not that they owned the land but that the<br />
land owned them.<br />
If conservation means deep spiritual respect for the land,<br />
and identification with it; if conservation requires an<br />
accurate understanding of the place of humankind in the<br />
grand scheme -of creation; if conservation means taking from<br />
the land today without compromising your children's rights<br />
to fulfil their needs tomorrow, then the Australian<br />
Aborigines were perhaps the world's first conservationists.<br />
For them, land care was literally a way of life. </p>
<p>It is only in relatively recent times the last two hundred<br />
years that this continent has undergone the impact of<br />
Western settlement.<br />
But those two centuries are of course the two centuries<br />
since the Industrial Revolution.<br />
In that time, prosperity and quality of life has been<br />
created for some but certainly not all of the world's<br />
growing population. And those incomplete gains have been<br />
achieved only through the progressive conquest of the<br />
world's natural environment by farming, mining, the growth<br />
of cities, the spread of industry.<br />
Soils have been degraded; seas and rivers and lakes have<br />
been polluted; huge parts of the world's tree cover has been<br />
obliterated; the fragile Arctic and Antarctic environments<br />
have been damaged.<br />
The Australian continent may seem to European or Asian eyes<br />
one that is vast, timeless, empty and untouched.<br />
Relatively speaking, it is. But no-one can ignore the fact<br />
and Australians do not ignore it that even here, much of<br />
the landscape bears the mark of human activity that has<br />
wrought permanent environmental change and, not<br />
infrequently, degradation.<br />
That brings me to the third way in which Australians bear a<br />
special responsibility.<br />
We are the only people whose nation occupies an entire<br />
continent. So the physical integrity of the Australian land<br />
mass is duplicated precisely by the political integrity of<br />
the Australian nation.<br />
This means that what Australians decide to do to preserve<br />
the environment of this large continent, or to destroy it,<br />
assumes real and lasting significance.<br />
At the same time, as a modern society and open economy,<br />
Australians understand the vital dynamic of global<br />
interdependence.<br />
We know that the prosperity of all nations is determined by<br />
the economic decisions of each nation a vivid example of<br />
which is provided by the tragic impasse in the current GATT<br />
negotiations. And we know too that the environmental well being of the<br />
globe is equally a shared responsibility.<br />
Australians are exposed as are we all to the danger of<br />
global warming and of ozone depletion. Australians share the<br />
loss we all experience when a living species ceases to exist<br />
somewhere in the world. </p>
<p>So Australians are coming to recognise, as are we all, the<br />
dilemma of modern life:<br />
We still face the pressing need to feed the people<br />
of the world and to create policies that provide<br />
the opportunity for growth and prosperity.<br />
But in the long term, such economic development is<br />
sustainable only if it is ecologically sustainable<br />
otherwise the gains made by this generation are<br />
achieved only at the expense of those who are as<br />
yet unborn.<br />
So for all these reasons, Australians are acutely aware of<br />
our responsibility to care for and to protect the unique<br />
landscape that is our national home.<br />
And in particular, we are endeavouring to show the way<br />
forward towards implementing a viable and effective process<br />
of ecologically sustainable development.<br />
We have established working groups that are examining the<br />
Australian economy, sector by sector agriculture,<br />
forestry, fisheries, mining, manufacturing, energy use and<br />
distribution, transport and tourism.<br />
This way, by careful study and broad community<br />
participation, we are endeavouring to ensure that our<br />
quality of life is maintained for now and for the future.<br />
And we have also established the Resource Assessment<br />
Commission, an independent advisory body that conducts<br />
enquiries into complex resource use issues such as<br />
forestry and coastal zones so that more informed and<br />
integrated decisions can be taken.<br />
We are working too, with the Australian States, to develop a<br />
national environment agreement to rationalise our processes<br />
and to ensure better environmental protection.<br />
Australia is also at the forefront of international<br />
environmental action. We are leading the way in the<br />
reduction of emissions of all greenhouse gases.<br />
We will have eliminated consumption of ozone-depleting<br />
substances by 1998 considerably faster than urged by the<br />
Montreal Protocol.<br />
And Australia has taken the lead, with France, in urging a<br />
total permanent international ban on mining in Antarctica.<br />
As we meet today, the parties to the Antarctic Treaty System<br />
are in conference in Chile and it is my profound hope that<br />
they will take the next steps towards our goal of protecting<br />
this fragile and precious environment.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen, </p>
<p>Australia's achievement is measured simply, if not<br />
comprehensively in our commitment to the World Heritage<br />
List, in the creation and maintenance of which the IUCN has<br />
played such a valuable and respected role.<br />
I record with pleasure the judgement of the IUCN that<br />
" Australia has done more to implement the World Heritage<br />
Convention than any other single country".<br />
Australia has eight sites of outstanding universal values of<br />
culture and nature which have been inscribed on the World<br />
Heritage List.<br />
Tropical, arid and temperate ecosystems marine and<br />
terrestrial are represented by the Great Barrier Reef,<br />
Uluru and Kakadu, the forests of Queensland's Wet Tropics,<br />
and of north-east New South Wales, South-west Tasmania, the<br />
Willandra Lakes Region and the Lord Howe Island group.<br />
Our recent nomination of Shark Bay, six hundred kilometres<br />
to our north on the coast of Western Australia, and of the<br />
sub-Antarctic Macdonald and Heard Islands will add to our<br />
distinguished World Heritage record.<br />
And as a further step, I am pleased to announce that<br />
agreement has been reached between the Commonwealth and<br />
Queensland Governments on joint management arrangements for<br />
the Wet Tropics World Heritage Area.<br />
This Management Scheme provides a mechanism for successful<br />
cooperative management of the area. It incorporates joint<br />
funding, consideration of local community interests and<br />
professional scientific advice through two advisory<br />
committees, a professionally staffed Management Agency, a<br />
joint Management Authority and a Ministerial Council.<br />
Through this Scheme, Australia will meet its international<br />
duty to protect this vital part of the world's heritage.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen,<br />
I say none of this in a spirit of complacency, or to pretend<br />
that countries, Australia included, need do no more to<br />
safeguard our global environment.<br />
We have indeed a long way to go. My Government is very<br />
conscious of Australia's responsibility to help maintain the<br />
international momentum on a number of other environmental<br />
issues. The loss of the world's biological diversity is one such<br />
issue. </p>
<p>You will all be aware of the statistics. The five million<br />
species estimated to have evolved over billions of years;<br />
the risk of losing one-quarter of these over the next 20 or<br />
years; the destruction of rainforests, the loss of<br />
genetic diversity, the loss of potential pharmaceuticals and<br />
new food crops.<br />
While some nations may be benefiting in the short-term from<br />
the activities which are leading to such losses, there can<br />
be no winners in the long-term.<br />
Australia believes that the development and negotiation of<br />
an international biodiversity convention is a matter of<br />
great urgency.<br />
At the last General Assembly of the IUCN, a resolution was<br />
passed calling for the establishment of a global<br />
representative system of marine protected areas.<br />
Australia has gone some way towards achieving this goal<br />
through the establishment of the Great Barrier Reef Marine<br />
Park and other significant Australian marine reserves such<br />
as Ningaloo Marine Park, just north of Shark Bay.<br />
There is, however, a number of other areas in Australian<br />
waters which contribute greatly to the world's biodiversity<br />
and would be valuable additions to a marine reserve system<br />
such as that proposed by the IUCN.<br />
I am, therefore, pleased to announce that the Australian<br />
Government has decided to work towards the expansion of<br />
Australia's marine reserve system. In association with State<br />
and Territory Governments, we will investigate the<br />
establishment of a national, representative system of marine<br />
protected areas for Australia that will protect these areas,<br />
while permitting appropriate uses and promoting public<br />
education. Ladies and gentlemen,<br />
I trust that you will not leave Australia without having<br />
taken the opportunity to appreciate both Australia's<br />
magnificent natural environment and the actions we are<br />
taking to preserve it.<br />
Australians are proud of both.<br />
And I trust that this General Assembly and the continuing<br />
work of the IUCN will help show us and other nations the<br />
way forward.<br />
Since its foundation in 1948, the IUCN has become a highly<br />
respected conservation organisation, forming close and<br />
valuable working relationships with government and<br />
non-government agencies alike. It has also maintained an<br />
important international focus upon the world's environmental<br />
problems. </p>
<p>6<br />
The key to the organisation's success has, in part, been the<br />
expertise it has been able to draw upon from its membership.<br />
It is this expertise, assembled here today, which is<br />
required for the complex issues to be considered over the<br />
coming week. The challenge will be to do more to integrate<br />
economic considerations into many of these issues.<br />
Your meeting indeed comes at a critical time in the<br />
evolution of international affairs. The events that we have<br />
witnessed of late the transformation of superpower<br />
relations and the revolutions of eastern Europe will<br />
ensure the historians of the future see our times as marking<br />
irreversible change. The overthrow of totalitarian rule in<br />
eastern Europe has not only changed the political landscape,<br />
bringing both freedom and democracy to millions; it also<br />
offers hope that as these people shape their economic<br />
destinies in this new order the past decades of<br />
environmental devastation can now be reversed.<br />
We must not overlook of course the persistence of<br />
substantial regional problems not least of course the<br />
potential for conflict in the Gulf. However the balance<br />
sheet is surely positive and must surely give us renewed<br />
confidence in the capacity of international forums such as<br />
yours to achieve lasting and beneficial change.<br />
I wish you all a productive and informative week and hope<br />
that it provides a solid foundation for your work in coming<br />
years. I I .4 2, </p>
