4JAUSTRALIA<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR PRESS 16 MAY 1978<br />
LOAN COUNCIL ARRANGEMENTS. FOR INFRASTRUCTURE FINANCING<br />
The Prime Minister announced today that he had again written to<br />
State Premiers on the adoption by the Australian Loan Council<br />
of guidelines for the Council's consideration of proposals for<br />
special additions to the semi-government borrowing programme and<br />
for overseas borrowings by statutory authorities.<br />
Mr Fraser said in earlier statements on this subject on<br />
Margch and 26 March he indicated the Commonwealth's willingness<br />
to adopt the new guidelines while at the same time ensuring that<br />
they are consistent with the Commmonwealth's responsibility for<br />
national economic and financial management.<br />
To this end, the Commonwealth had proposed that the voting rules<br />
on proposals put to the Loan Council for consideration under the<br />
guidelines should be a simple majority including the Commonwealth.<br />
This had not been acceptable to some of the Premiers.<br />
In this context, the Premier of Western Australia has put forward a<br />
helpful proposal to the effect that the States could accept the<br />
guidelines, with the voting rules proposed by the Commonwealth,<br />
on the understanding that these arrangements could be reviewed<br />
in three years time.<br />
The Prime Minister said he had indicated to the Premiers that the<br />
Commonwealth would be happy to have the guidelines adopted without<br />
further delay on such a basis, and had invited them to respond<br />
quickly on this proposal.<br />
A number of Premiers have suggested projects which they wish to<br />
have considered by the Loan Council under the proposed guidelines.<br />
Mr Fraser said he had invited them to bring forward for Loan Council<br />
consideration formal proposals in conformity with the requirements<br />
of the guidelines.<br />
The adoption of the guidelines will represet a major advance<br />
in Commonwealth/ State financial arrangements.<br />
The cooperative implementation of them will help to facilitate the<br />
provision, in a coordi rated manner throughout Australia, of<br />
infrastructure investment necessary for sound national economic<br />
development. </p>
