SPEECH NOTES FROM THE PRIME MINISTER'S ADDRESS TO THE<br />
AUSTRALIAN DELEGATES TO THE WOMEN LEADERS FORUM, 14 JULY<br />
1994 " The Forum is built on the recognition of two dynamic trends: first, the<br />
opening up of Australia to new commercial and trade links with the Asia-<br />
Pacific region, with the enormous opportunities foi; growth and employment.<br />
And second, the move of many more women into business and management,<br />
with the benefits for Australia of their talents and resources."<br />
" The fact is women have not been a firm part of most of Australia's trade<br />
missions. Yours is a unique trade mission, which capitalises on the expertise<br />
and contribution of business women to developing new commercial and trade<br />
links. If we are to project a contemporary image of Australia's business<br />
capacities, then it must be an accurate one and must include leading women<br />
executives." " An important aim of the Forum is to achieve greater recognition of the talents<br />
of Australian women recognition by governments, the media, the community,<br />
and business both in Australia and in the region. If Australia is to have<br />
internationally competitive, high quality management in the future, we must<br />
harness the talents of women in business."<br />
" The Forum is an exciting initiative. It is an example of the entrepreneurship<br />
that Australia needs to take full advantage of the recovery and the<br />
opportunities opening up in the Asia Pacific. It deserve9 to succeed. I have<br />
no doubt that it will achieve signifcant advantages both for your corporations<br />
and for Australia."<br />
" I wish the Forum every success and congratulate Georgina Carnegie,<br />
Telstra and the other corporate sponsors on your vision in conceiving,<br />
organising and supporting the Forum."<br />
