PRIME MINISTER INTERVIEWED: DOORSTOP, CANBERRA<br />
Question<br />
What sort of Budget can we expect tonight?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
A very responsible one.<br />
Question Can you give any indication of what the taxpayers ( inaudible).<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I don't think I can give any indication, and I don't think<br />
you would expect me to, in spite of events of yesterday.<br />
But it will be a responsible Budget, and it will be a fair<br />
Budget. -I hope it will acclaimed as a good one for Australia<br />
because that is what it is.<br />
Question Prime Minister, are you happy to have Mr. Sinclair back with<br />
you in Cabinet so soon after he was cleared of charges in<br />
Sydney. Prime Minister<br />
Yes, very happy indeed. I had made that plain. I will be<br />
glad to see him in Cabinet. I am not too sure that the Opposition<br />
will like to see him as Leader of the House, because after all<br />
the things that they have said which have now been proved by<br />
the courts to be quite false. 000---4'<br />
