    <content><![CDATA[<p>  I warmly welcome the decision by the Secretary-General of the United Nations,<br />
   Mr Kofi Annan, to appoint General de los Santos of the Philippines as commander<br />
   of the UN peacekeeping operation in East Timor.</p>
<p>  The peacekeepers will replace the Australian-led multinational force, INTERFET,<br />
   which has largely restored peace and security in East Timor under the outstanding<br />
   leadership of Major-General Peter Cosgrove.</p>
<p>  Australia will continue to play a major role. I am very pleased that Australia<br />
   has been asked to provide a deputy commander to General de los Santos. Major-General<br />
   Mike Smith has been chosen to fill this position.</p>
<p>  Australia's troop commitment to East Timor will fall with the changeover<br />
   from INTERFET to the peacekeeping operation. But our contribution will remain<br />
   significant.</p>
<p>  Our contribution will involve more than 1500 soldiers, including a battalion<br />
   group, headquarters staff and a medical element. We have also offered 400<br />
   soldiers in a logistics team to help with the transition from INTERFET to<br />
   the UN force.</p>
<p>  We look forward to continuing our close cooperation with the United Nations<br />
   and all those working in East Timor.</p>
