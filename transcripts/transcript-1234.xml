<p>Statement by the Prime Minister, Sir Robert Menzies</p>
<p>I have sent the following message today to the Australian High Commissioner in Nigeria :-</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">" I had a very warm regard for Sir Abubakar as a man whose company I always enjoyed at conferences of Prime Ministers. I also had a great respect for him as a leader clear minded, sagacious, tolerant and just.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">"His death has come as a great shock to many of us who had come to believe that the principle of constitutional government and of peaceful rule were especially illustrated in Nigeria.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">I would like to extend to the Nigerian people my most profound hopes for a happier future."</p>
<p>CANBERRA, 24th January, 1966.</p>
